(cid:129) Prognostic risk factors for recurrence were in order of strength of evidence:
(cid:129) 1st: childhood maltreatment, residual symptoms and history of prior episodes
(cid:129) 2nd: comorbid anxiety, rumination, neuroticism and age of onset
(cid:129) Some also may be prescriptive but evidence for such eﬀects was limited
(cid:129) Neurocognitive and neuroendocrine factors were identiﬁed as potential risk factors
(cid:129) A conceptual framework considering the risk factors and mechanisms was developed.

Purpose: To review and synthesise prognostic indices that predict subsequent risk, prescriptive indices that
moderate treatment response, and mechanisms that underlie each with respect to relapse and recurrence of
depression in adults.
Results and conclusions: Childhood maltreatment, post-treatment residual symptoms, and a history of recurrence
emerged as strong prognostic indicators of risk and each could be used prescriptively to indicate who beneﬁts
most from continued or prophylactic treatment. Targeting prognostic indices or their “down-stream” con-
sequences will be particularly beneﬁcial because each is either a cause or a consequence of the causal me-
chanisms underlying risk of recurrence. The cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie the prognostic in-
dices are likely addressed by the eﬀects of treatments that are moderated by the prescriptive factors. For
example, psychosocial interventions that target the consequences of childhood maltreatment, extending phar-
macotherapy or adapting psychological therapies to deal with residual symptoms, or using cognitive or mind-
fulness-based therapies for those with prior histories of recurrence. Future research that focuses on under-
standing causal pathways that link childhood maltreatment, or cognitive diatheses, to dysfunction in the
neocortical and limbic pathways that process aﬀective information and facilitate cognitive control, might result
in more enduring eﬀects of treatments for depression.

1. Introduction

Depression has the highest disease burden worldwide in terms of
life-years lost to disability (Prince et al., 2007). It is highly prevalent,
results in signiﬁcant functional impairment, and increases the risk of
suicide and comorbid physical health problems (Judd, 1997; Kessler &
Wang, 2009). Recurrence is common in major depression; in non-clin-
ical cohorts a third of all persons who have at least one episode will
have another (Eaton et al., 2008) and the same is true for over three-

quarters of patients in clinical samples (Mueller et al., 1999). The mean
number of episodes per suﬀerer is approximately four, with a mean
duration of approximately 14–17 weeks per episode if mild in severity
or 23 weeks if severe (Kessler et al., 2003). While depression tradi-
tionally has been seen as an episodic disorder with good inter-morbid
functioning (Angst, Kupfer, & Rosenbaum, 1996), it is now thought by
many to follow a “relapsing-remitting” course with debilitating sub-
syndromal symptoms occurring between discrete episodes (e.g. Burcusa
& Iacono, 2007).

1.1. Diﬀerentiating remission from recovery and relapse from recurrence

Current convention in the literature is to distinguish between re-
sponse (better but not fully well) and remission (fully asymptomatic but
still in episode) and each from recovery (the resolution of the under-
lying episode) (Frank et al., 1991). A further distinction is made be-
tween relapse (the return of symptoms associated with the remitted
episode) and recurrence (the onset of a new episode following recovery)
(Rush et al., 2006). Whether these distinctions hold in fact is still not
clear but they do guide medication practice as patients are routinely
kept on antidepressants (ADM) for up-to a year after reaching remission
in order to forestall relapse (Reimherr et al., 1998). What will become
clear in the review to follow is that they rarely guide the empirical
literature.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) appears to have an enduring
eﬀect that reduces risk for relapse to the same extent as continuation
ADM (Cuijpers et al., 2013) and that enduring eﬀect may extend to the
prevention of recurrence among recovered patients (Dobson et al.,
2008; Hollon et al., 2005). Adding CBT as ADMs are tapered oﬀ has also
been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent relapse or recurrence
(Guidi, Tomba, & Fava, 2015). Even so, current practice is evolving in
the direction of keeping patients with a history of recurrent or chronic
depression on maintenance medication indeﬁnitely in an attempt to
delay or prevent subsequent recurrence (e.g. Thase, 2006). This is de-
spite the suggestion that use of ADM may itself be a factor contributing
to the risk of relapse or recurrence (Andrews, Kornstein, Halberstadt,
Gardner, & Neale, 2011; Andrews, Thomson, Amstadter, & Neale, 2012;
Fava, 2003). It is unclear whether factors other than the duration of
remission diﬀerentiates those at risk for relapse from those at risk for
recurrence (Farb, Irving, Anderson, & Segal, 2015). For that reason we
attempt to diﬀerentiate between the two in the empirical literature.

1.2. Prognostic versus prescriptive designs and questions

Given that there are diﬀerent treatment strategies that can be ap-
plied and diﬀerent durations of treatment, the question becomes whe-
ther we can identify i) prognostic factors that indicate which patients
are at greater risk of relapse or recurrence, and ii) prescriptive factors
(moderators) that predict diﬀerential response to diﬀerent treatments
thought to help forestall or prevent relapse or recurrence (Fournier
et al., 2009). Prognostic indices are best detected when treatment is
held constant, ignored, or better still (from the perspective of science)
not provided at all and individual diﬀerences are allowed to vary. Co-
hort designs are best suited to answering this question since treatment
is not controlled (with those samples that receive the least treatment
closest to the “state of nature”, and most informative with respect to
what factors best predict relapse or recurrence.

Prescriptive designs involve the superimposition of some type of
controlled treatment on top of the natural course and their proper in-
terpretation involves testing for patient-by-treatment interactions, but
even in controlled trials prognostic indices can be identiﬁed too.
Within-condition comparisons among patients tells you who is most at
risk (prognostic) whereas comparisons between conditions within the
same kind of patients tells you what treatment works best for a given
kind of patient (prescriptive). The diﬀerences in these study designs
allow each to answer diﬀerent albeit overlapping questions. As we shall
see, reviews of the empirical literature are not always clear about which
type of question is being addressed.

For a fuller explanation of prognostic compared to prescriptive in-

dices see Supplementary Fig. 1.

1.3. Consensus on risk factors for relapse and recurrence

The “consensus view” as deﬁned by Campbell's Dictionary of
Psychiatry (2009) and conﬁrmed in individual studies (e.g. Lin et al.,
1998) is that two factors inﬂuence risk for both relapse and recurrence:

1) residual depressive symptoms at the end of acute treatment, and 2) a
prior history of recurrence. It has also been suggested that subsequent
episodes become increasingly autonomous from stressful life events
(Campbell, 2009), that a lack of social support and social health pro-
blems may contribute to risk of relapse (Paykel & Priest, 1992), and that
neuroticism and age of ﬁrst onset are risk factors for recurrence (Gelder,
Lopez-Ibor, & Andreasen, 2000). Nonetheless, despite more than half a
century of active research into the nature and treatment of depression,
we are still unable to predict with conﬁdence who will relapse or recur
following treatment termination (Beckerman & Corbett, 2010; Hughes
& Cohen, 2009).

One diﬃculty in identifying more eﬀective approaches to pre-
venting relapse or recurrence is a lack of clarity about what it is that
confers risk for each (e.g. Burcusa & Iacono, 2007). A number of studies
have been hampered by methodological problems or inconsistencies
(Monroe & Harkness, 2011). Early studies did not deﬁne relapse and
recurrence consistently or failed to distinguish between them altogether
(Beshai, Dobson, Bockting, & Quigley, 2011). The majority of more
recent studies now follow the conventions set by Frank et al. (1991) and
elaborated by Rush et al. (2006), but it is likely that the 8 weeks of
continuous remission required by Frank was far too short and that even
the 4 month criteria set by Rush may also be too short (Kessler et al.,
2003). To the extent that this is true, many apparent “recurrences”
would actually be “relapses”, making it harder to detect indices that
predict diﬀerential risk between the two phenomena. In addition, many
studies fail to discriminate patients in their ﬁrst episode from those with
a history of multiple previous depressive episodes. Epidemiological
studies suggest that as many as half of all people who have an episode
of depression will never have another (Eaton et al., 2008) and diﬀer-
ences in the case mix across studies can lead to spurious conclusions
(Monroe & Harkness, 2011). Studies in clinical samples that suggest
that up to 80% of patients will have a recurrence (e.g. Mueller et al.,
1999) likely oversample exactly the kinds of chronicity and recurrence
that lead people to seek treatment in the ﬁrst place. Further, the di-
agnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is likely causally hetero-
geneous. For example, it is given to those who experience prolonged
periods of sadness as a reaction to a life event in one-oﬀ episodes that
frequently remit spontaneously, and to those with chronic, sometimes
decades-long episodes that are unresponsive to multiple treatments
(Baldessarini et al., 2017; Lorenzo-Luaces, 2015). Such heterogeneity
necessarily aﬀects the ability to identify prognostic or prescriptive in-
dices.

Given the methodological diﬃculties identiﬁed, it is not surprising
that the ﬁeld has struggled to determine what predicts risk for relapse
and recurrence, whether the risk factors for each are the same or dif-
ferent, whether they are universal to all depression or only particular
sub-types, which factors might be prognostic and which prescriptive,
and what the mechanisms are by which the risk factors operate (Kazdin,
2007). This review therefore aimed to summarise and synthesise ﬁnd-
ings from studies that have reported on prognostic and prescriptive risk
factors for relapse or recurrence, or that explored the mechanisms un-
derlying the action of each, and how that evidence can guide both
clinical practice and future research.

Scoping searches conducted to consider the feasibility of a meta-
review of systematic reviews revealed that there were only a handful of
systematic reviews of the risk factors for depressive relapse or recur-
rence, that each was based on only a small number of primary studies,
and that very few were reviews of cohort studies. Therefore, it seemed
likely that such a meta-review would only elucidate prescriptive eﬀects
on risk of relapse or recurrence and not allow us to investigate prog-
nostic eﬀects. Since our aim was to investigate both types of eﬀect a
novel approach was indicated. We adopted a phased approach, starting
with a meta-review in order to qualitatively synthesise information
across a broad literature, looking at all major types of psychiatric and
psychological treatment for depression, and including cohorts of de-
pressed participants in all community and health settings. Such meta-

reviews are beholden not only to the quality of the primary studies
included but also to the quality of the reviews in which they are in-
cluded. However, they are considered to be of particular value when
they describe the completeness (or incompleteness) of a literature, and
by working at the level of reviews rather than individual studies can
often generate syntheses in greater depth and with greater richness than
reviews of primary studies (Francke, Smit, de Veer, & Mistiaen, 2008).
This was the starting point for the present article and it led to reviews of
studies that had not been included in earlier systematic reviews but
themselves might contribute to our understanding of the factors that
predict and the mechanisms that determine risk for relapse or recur-
rence. After a description of the general methods used in each of the
phases of this overall review, the four phases are presented as four
individual studies (Study 1–4), followed by a general discussion to
summarise ﬁndings across the phases. We hoped that bringing together
results like this would inform a new conceptual framework that could
highlight novel ways of tackling this problem.

2. General methods

Four systematic reviews were conducted and are reported in ac-
cordance with the preferred reporting method for systematic reviews
(PRISMA) (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaﬀ, & Altman, 2009).

2.1. Search strategy

For Studies 1–3 reviews/studies were identiﬁed by using a combi-
nation of keyword and subject heading searches on the following bib-
liographic databases then applying diﬀerent inclusion and exclusion
criteria: Cochrane Database of Reviews (searched on 8th May 2017),
Embase 1947 to 2017 Week 19, Ovid MEDLINE 1946 to May Week 1
2017, Prospero (searched on 8th May 2017), PsycEXTRA 1908 to May
8, 2017, and PsycINFO 1806 to May Week 1 2017.

For Study 4 the primary studies were again identiﬁed using a
combination of keyword and subject heading searches on the following
databases: CAB Global Health Archive 1910 to 1972, Cochrane
CENTRAL Trial Register (searched on 8th May 2017), Embase 1947 to
2017 Week 19, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts 1970 to May
2017, Ovid MEDLINE 1946 to May Week 1 2017, PsycEXTRA 1908 to
May 8th 2017, and PsycINFO 1806 to May Week 1 2017.

For each study databases were searched individually and results
were combined before removing duplicates. Search terms included
variations of phrases such as “depression” or “major depression” or
“major depressive episode” or “MDD” or “unipolar depression” or
“depressive episode”, and “relapse” or “recurrence”, and searches were
run in the relevant databases to include terms relevant to the type of
article to be reviewed. Appendix A lists the searches conducted and
results.

2.2. Study selection

All search results were reviewed by the lead author (JB) who read
study titles to remove any clearly non-relevant articles based on the
inclusion and exclusion criteria of each of the four phases listed below.
The remaining abstracts were read and judged as relevant, possibly
relevant, or deﬁnitely not relevant to each of the four phases based on
their speciﬁc inclusion and exclusion criteria. All reviews/studies
deemed to be possibly relevant were read in full and independently
judged against inclusion and exclusion criteria of the individual phase
by two reviewers (JB and AU). Disputes were resolved by consensus and
consultation when necessary with a third reviewer (SP). Hand searches
of the references from all the included reviews/studies were conducted
to identify studies missed in the bibliographic searches. Relevant re-
views/studies were processed as detailed above.

2.3. General inclusion and exclusion criteria

Reviews/studies were included if: 1) they provided data on at least
one explanatory factor for relapse or recurrence of depression; 2) stu-
dies (standalone or considered in a review) had some longitudinal
measurement of depressive symptoms and either a clinical interview to
determine status of onset, remission, recovery, relapse, or recurrence,
or used well validated interviewer-rated or self-report measure(s) of
depressive symptoms; 3) they reviewed studies of adults, or included
participants aged 18 years or older; and 5) were peer-reviewed journal
articles published in English.

Reviews/studies were excluded if: 1) they provided no data on ex-
planatory factors associated with relapse or recurrence of depression; 2)
they reviewed or studied populations with bipolar disorder, psychotic
depression, seasonal aﬀective disorder, depression secondary to organic
brain disorders, or if they focussed on relapse or recurrence of other
conditions (such as drug or alcohol misuse disorders) comorbid with
depression; 3) they reviewed or studied children or adolescents younger
than 18 only, including studies of the impact of parental depression on
children, or studies focused solely on older adults aged 65 and above or
factors relevant only to geriatric populations; 5) they were not peer-
reviewed journal articles; and 6) if they were not published in the
English language.

Table 1 describes the research questions addressed, type of studies
reviewed, speciﬁc inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality rating
systems used for each review in the four studies in this article.

2.4. Data extraction

For Studies 1–4 data on the main results of relevance to relapse or
recurrence were extracted from each review/study. In Studies 1 and 3
terms used for
data on the search strategy, databases searched,
searching,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as methods of
quantitative synthesis (where applicable) were extracted from each
included review, and data on the primary studies included in the re-
view. For Study 2 data were extracted on the setting and sample in-
cluded; the methods used to diagnose depression at baseline, on any
relevant treatment given or measured, to capture relapse and recur-
rence, and how these were deﬁned; the baseline (and if relevant, end of
treatment) characteristics of the sample, and the number of participants
reaching remission and recovery. For Study 4 information relevant to
the methods of participant recruitment; inclusion and exclusion criteria;
how depressive status or symptoms were determined at baseline; the
participants; the experimental interventions or means of neuroimaging;
the comparisons drawn between or within groups of participants; and
the outcomes reported and the means by which these were recorded.
For each Study of this review extracted data were used to build a matrix
such that every proposed factor could be considered from the per-
spective of each included review/study, in order to consider the con-
sistency of ﬁndings across the reviewed literature. In addition, in Study
2 data were synthesised in meta-analyses (described in detail in the
method section for Study 2). In the matrix for each Study the strength of
association between given risk factors and relapse or recurrence as re-
ported in each reviewed article was entered into the relevant matrix cell
in a “box score” approach. The overall strength of associations were
based on our judgement after taking into consideration: the size of the
eﬀect reported in the review/study; the number of reviews/studies and
sample sizes of the studies; the degree of agreement between the re-
viewed reviews/studies; how well the article was set up to investigate
the eﬀect; how well the article dealt with problems of bias; and the
overall quality of the article. The strength of evidence was then given a
rating from inconclusive (~) to very strong (+++) if positively as-
sociated with relapse or recurrence (if negatively associated factors
were reversed so that they could be considered as risk factors rather
than protective factors), or === if no association was found. These
ratings approximately match the four categories in the column labelled

“meaning” in the “Rating Study Quality” displayed in Table 2. The
matrix tables display the consistency of the ﬁndings in the literature
reviewed and the strength of evidence for each, but are not informed by
or informative for quantitative analyses, so one cannot sum down the
columns in the matrices to get an overall eﬀect.

2.5. Rating study quality

Two reviewers (JB and AU) provided independent quality ratings
for all included reviews/studies (Cohen's Kappa = 0.76 across all four
studies) with disputes resolved by consensus or by consultation with a
third reviewer (SP). Diﬀerent quality rating systems were used in each
of the four Studies in accordance with the type of primary studies re-
viewed in each. Details of the methods are given below.

3. Study 1 – meta-review of systematic reviews

3.1. Aim

The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia
(NHMRC) suggests that the greatest level of evidence for the prognosis
or etiology of disorders comes from systematic reviews of prospective
cohort studies, with the next greatest level of evidence coming from
systematic reviews of retrospective cohort studies or randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs), and then pseudo-randomised trials, non-rando-
mised trials, and case-control studies (Coleman et al., 2005). The aim of
Study 1 was to conduct a meta-review of systematic reviews that re-
ported on prognostic or prescriptive risk factors for relapse or recur-
rence of depression in adults, to consider the completeness of the lit-
erature, and to highlight how any gaps might be addressed in future
reviews and primary studies.

3.2. Methods

For the purpose of this review the description of the key features
given by the Cochrane Collaboration was used to deﬁne systematic
reviews as studies that: “seek to collate all evidence that ﬁts pre-spe-
ciﬁed eligibility criteria in order to address a speciﬁc research question”
(Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Higgins
& Green, 2008, p.3).

3.2.1. Data extraction

In addition to the procedure and details described in the General
Methods (above) for this meta-review data were extracted from each
review on whether the results related only to relapse, only to recur-
rence, to both undiﬀerentiated, or to both separately. These judgements
were made by comparing the methods and results of the primary studies
in each of the reviews against the Frank et al. (1991) and Rush et al.
(2006) deﬁnitions of relapse and recurrence, so the judgement was
made irrespective of whether or not the authors of the primary studies
or the reviews they were included in discussed the results as related to
“relapse” or “recurrence”. Supplementary Table 1 provides details for
each study and Appendix B details the information on which those
judgements were based.

3.2.2. Rating study quality

We used “a measurement tool to assess the methodological quality
of systematic reviews” (AMSTAR) to judge the quality of the included
reviews (Shea et al., 2007). In order to bring a common structure to the
interpretation of the AMSTAR quality ratings, we also used the cate-
gories suggested by Guyatt and colleagues in the GRADE rating system
(Guyatt et al., 2008), and considered additional criteria from PRISMA
(Moher et al., 2009) and the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook (Higgins &
Green, 2008). Each study ﬁt into one of the following:

blind to allocation, and dealt appropriately with biases in methods and interpretation of results
More AMSTAR items were answered yes than no or if many more were answered yes than no
but not meeting additional criteria of High Quality outlined above.
More of the AMSTAR items were answered no than yes

Very few or none of the AMSTAR items were answered yes

3.3. Results

Ten systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and were included in

the present meta-review (see Supplementary Fig. 2).

3.3.1. Characteristics of included reviews

(Berwian, Walter,

Seifritz, & Huys,

Of the ten included systematic reviews, three reviewed cohort stu-
dies (Hardeveld, Spijker, De Graaf, Nolen, & Beekman, 2010; Hughes &
Cohen, 2009; Kok et al., 2013), two reviewed psychotherapy RCTs in-
tended to prevent relapse or recurrence (Beshai et al., 2011; Clarke,
Mayo-Wilson, Kenny, & Pilling, 2015), two reviewed continuation
pharmacotherapy
2017;
Gueorguieva, Chekroud, & Krystal, 2017), one reviewed both RCTs and
quasi-randomised controlled trials of any psychological relapse pre-
vention treatment (Feng et al., 2012), one reviewed RCTs and pseudo-
RCTs with Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) (Bourgon & Kellner, 2000),
and one reviewed both cohort studies and clinical trials of either
pharmacological or non-pharmacological relapse prevention treatments
(Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012). Two articles reviewed studies of chil-
dren or adolescents as well as studies of adults; details pertaining only
to primary studies of adults 18 or over were used for the present review.
Full details of the methods adopted by each included review can be
found in Appendix B. Details of the primary studies included in each
review, the participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes,
along with the main results in relation to prognostic and prescriptive
factors associated or not associated with relapse or recurrence are
outlined in Supplementary Table 1.

by Feng et al. (2012) was rated as high quality there were some con-
cerns in the reporting of results and a conﬂation of studies assessing
CBT delivered one-to-one (not in a group) with studies in which the
primary intervention was behavioural activation (BA), interpersonal
psychotherapy (IPT), or mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT).

3.3.4. Prognostic indicators (see Supplementary Table 1 and Table 3 for
details)
3.3.4.1. Residual symptoms. The evidence for residual symptoms post-
treatment being associated with greater risk of relapse or recurrence
was based on ﬁve reviews that together included 116 diﬀerent studies,
with 14,486 patients, and found high levels of agreement among the
studies. Four of the ﬁve reviews primarily included RCTs [three of
psychological therapies (Beshai et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2015; Feng
et al., 2012) and one of continuation ADM (Gueorguieva et al., 2017)]
with the ﬁfth reviewing only cohort studies (Hardeveld et al., 2010). In
the latter review the authors reported that four cohorts found residual
symptoms to be related to recurrence but three did not. Looking more
those primary studies it became clear that one was
closely at
misclassiﬁed (Melartin et al., 2004, OR(95%CI) = 2.14(1.06–4.31),
the second was a cohort in which only ﬁve participants had residual
symptoms so the eﬀect could not be adequately assessed (Ilardi,
Craighead, & Evans, 1997), and the third showed a trend towards an
eﬀect but had a very small sample in which just 19 had residual
symptoms (Kennedy & Paykel, 2004, n = 59). On the whole, there was
strong evidence that residual symptoms are prognostic for subsequent
relapse and recurrence.

3.3.2. Review and study quality

Quality judgements were made at the level of the review, not of the
primary studies included in each review. Only three of the included
reviews reported on the quality of the studies reviewed therein: Clarke
et al. (2015) reported that the majority of the 29 studies they reviewed
were of “low quality”; Feng et al. (2012) reported that the 32 studies
they reviewed were all of “good quality”; and Kok et al. (2013) reported
that the four studies they reviewed were of “low-to-moderate quality”.

3.3.3. Quality of reviewed studies

Of the ten reviews included three were judged to be of high quality
(See Supplementary Table 2) (Clarke et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2012;
Nanni et al., 2012), three were rated moderate (Berwian et al., 2017;
Hardeveld et al., 2010; Kok et al., 2013), three were rated low (Bourgon
& Kellner, 2000; Gueorguieva et al., 2017; Hughes & Cohen, 2009) and
one was rated very-low (Beshai et al., 2011).

These ratings tell us about the quality of the reporting by the
AMSTAR, PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines and therefore are primarily
about the methods for dealing with bias and adherence to reporting
guidelines, not the quality of the reviews in relation to the research
questions of this meta-review. The reviews which best investigated the
questions of prognostic eﬀects for relapse or recurrence were Hardeveld
et al. (2010), and Nanni et al. (2012), the review that best investigated
prescriptive eﬀects was that of Berwian et al. (2017) who only in-
vestigated in the context of ADM discontinuation. Although the review

3.3.4.2. Previous depressive episodes. One review of RCTs (Clarke et al.,
2015) commented that the number of prior episodes was associated
with the risk of recurrence, and another suggested that there was some
limited evidence for a prognostic eﬀect (Beshai et al., 2011). The best
placed review to assess this eﬀect (Hardeveld et al., 2010) reviewed ten
articles from ﬁve diﬀerent cohort studies that found a prognostic
association between having history of any previous episodes and an
elevated odds of relapse or recurrence (from the diﬀerent cohorts
n = 1250) [this includes one study the authors reported as having not
found the eﬀect but the reported odds ratio for recurrence was OR
(95%CI) = 1.34(1.01–1.77): Holma, Holma, Melartin, Rytsälä, &
Isometsä, 2008]. The review also found six other articles from ﬁve
cohorts that did not ﬁnd evidence of this association (from the diﬀerent
cohorts n = 571) (Hardeveld et al., 2010). One of these found a trend
OR(95%CI)
towards
=1.12(0.98–1.28)], two others were unable to adequately address
the question as one was a very small cohort with high rates of prior
episodes and little variability across the groups (Ilardi et al., 1997), and
another was a very small cohort with only 14 people with prior
episodes (Kennedy & Paykel, 2004). Interestingly, a review of four
ADM discontinuation RCTs using the individual patient data from those
studies (n = 1462) found no prognostic eﬀect of a history of prior
episodes across the dataset, irrespective of the number of prior episodes
(Gueorguieva et al., 2017). Approximately two thirds of the sample
were on continuation medications so this ﬁnding might be considered

to be less close to the “state of nature” and so less informative of the
prognostic nature of having a history of previous recurrences than the
information provided from the review of cohort studies. Overall then,
prior depressive episodes appear to be prognostic for relapse or
recurrence.

3.3.4.3. Severity of depression. There was some evidence that a more
severe last depressive episode was prognostically associated with worse
odds of recurrence although this was rarely assessed in the included
reviews and there was conﬂicting evidence with some studies ﬁnding
an eﬀect and others not. In one review the eﬀect was found in ﬁve
cohorts but not in three other cohorts with no apparent pattern
emerging to explain the disparity in ﬁndings (Hardeveld et al., 2010).
A second review reported no prognostic eﬀect (Hughes & Cohen, 2009)
though was focussed on those receiving long-term ADM and included
three cohorts also assessed in the other review. So, the evidence here is
suggestive but not conclusive of the severity of depression being
prognostic for relapse or recurrence.

3.3.4.4. Duration of depression. The evidence for the duration of
depression as a prognostic indicator of recurrence was diﬃcult to
assess as only two reviews (and few primary studies within them)
investigated this. One reported that a longer duration of depression was
associated with greater odds of recurrence in one large cohort but not in
four smaller cohorts (Hardeveld et al., 2010) and a second review also
suggested that overall there might be a lack of eﬀect (Hughes & Cohen,
2009).

3.3.4.5. Age of initial onset. Younger age of initial onset was reported in
one review to be a risk factor in three cohorts but not in four others
(Hardeveld et al., 2010), there was no apparent pattern to explain why
some cohorts found the eﬀect and others did not. So, the evidence for a
prognostic eﬀect was inconclusive.

3.3.4.6. Neuroticism. Only one review considered the association
between neuroticism and recurrence (Hardeveld et al., 2010). In that
review higher neuroticism was said to be associated with a greater odds
of recurrence in one cohort (Gopinath, Katon, Russo, & Ludman, 2007,
n = 386) but not in two articles from a second cohort. However, one of
these articles did ﬁnd an association between higher neuroticism and
OR
recurrence
(95%CI) = 1.11(1.02–1.21)] and the other from a smaller sample of
the same cohort found a trend towards an association [Holma et al.,
2008: OR(95%CI) = 1.09(0.99–1.20)]. So, although neuroticism was
only assessed in two cohorts, both appear to have found some evidence
that higher neuroticism was associated with increased probability of
recurrence.

3.3.4.7. Demographics. Demographic
socio-
economic status and civil status were not found to be associated with
the odds of recurrence in one review of naturalistic cohort studies
(Hardeveld et al., 2010). Female sex was associated with a higher
probability of recurrence (within patients discontinuing ADM) in one
review (Gueorguieva et al., 2017) but not in four other reviews (Beshai
et al., 2011; Bourgon & Kellner, 2000; Hardeveld et al., 2010; Hughes &
Cohen, 2009). So, there appears to be little evidence of prognostic
indication by demographic factors.

3.3.4.8. Others

3.3.4.8.1. Childhood maltreatment. There was strong evidence for a
prognostic eﬀect of childhood maltreatment (deﬁned as physical, sexual
or emotional abuse; family conﬂict or violence; or neglect) coming from
a single high quality review (Nanni et al., 2012) in which a meta-
analysis found a greater odds of recurrence for those with a history of
childhood maltreatment compared to those without such histories OR
(95%CI) = 2.27(1.80–2.87). All but one of the primary studies found

(combined n = 6838). The evidence here is strongly

3.3.4.8.2. Time with clinical response. There was good evidence for
an association between shorter periods of time between starting ADM
and reaching “clinical response”, and higher odds of subsequent relapse
(for details see Supplementary Table 1) (Gueorguieva et al., 2017).

3.3.4.8.3. Family history of depression. Family history of depression
was assessed in just one review which found it was not associated with
recurrence in ﬁve cohorts (including large community samples and
small outpatient and inpatient samples), though it was associated with
increased risk of recurrence in one small cohort (with a predominantly
inpatient sample) (Hardeveld et al., 2010). Somewhat surprisingly, the
evidence here provides little support for a prognostic eﬀect of family
history.

3.3.4.8.4. Comorbidities. Overall

there was some evidence that
psychiatric comorbidities are associated with increased risk of
recurrence. One review found that having psychiatric comorbidities
was associated with greater risk in three cohorts but not in three others
(Hardeveld et al., 2010). However, of these three reported to have not
found an eﬀect one found that comorbid personality disorder diagnoses
were associated with relapse (p < .01: Ilardi et al., 1997), and another
had only 32 relapses and just 5% with the comorbidity of interest so
could not adequately assess the eﬀect (Kanai et al., 2003). Another
review suggested there was some limited evidence for an increased risk
of recurrence in patients with comorbid psychiatric or physical
disorders (Clarke et al., 2015). A third review which focussed solely
on depression among those with comorbid physical health problems
found no prognostic eﬀect of such conditions on recurrence (Kok et al.,
2013). Delusional symptoms were found to have a prognostic eﬀect in
studies of ECT treated patients though this was only assessed in one
review and was based on just three relatively small primary studies
(combined n = 226). Overall, there was some limited evidence for
prognostic indication depending on the nature of the comorbidity.

3.3.4.8.5. Psychosocial

impairment and coping style. There were
suggested links between psychosocial impairment and higher odds of
recurrence in one review (Hardeveld et al., 2010). This was based on
ﬁndings from the only two cohort studies to assess the eﬀect. Poor
coping skills were also associated with higher odds of recurrence
(Hardeveld et al., 2010). This was assessed in one primary study as
lower self-eﬃcacy (Gopinath et al., 2007), and in another as lower self-
esteem and mastery (Conradi, de Jonge, & Ormel, 2008). Avoidant
coping style and daily hassles/life events were found to have prognostic
eﬀects on recurrence in one very low quality review (Beshai et al.,
2011), although this was based on just two primary studies. The
evidence was sparse but largely supportive of prognostic eﬀects.

3.3.4.8.6. Stress. The role of environmental stressors as prognostic
indices were discussed in several reviews but rarely assessed directly.
Higher levels of interpersonal stress were found to be associated with
greater probability of relapse although this was assessed in just two
primary studies in (Beshai et al., 2011). So, the evidence was sparse but
somewhat supportive of a prognostic eﬀect.

3.3.4.8.7. Cognitive biases. The presence of

cognitive biases,
particularly rumination, was found to be associated with greater odds
of relapse although the evidence for these associations was limited due
to few primary studies assessing the eﬀects (Beshai et al., 2011). Again,
the evidence was sparse but supportive of prognostic indication.

3.3.5. Prescriptive factors (see Supplementary Table 1 and Table 3 for
details)
3.3.5.1. Residual symptoms. Considering the primary studies assessed in
one review (Beshai et al., 2011) there was some limited evidence that
residual symptoms may moderate the eﬀects of treatment as patients
discontinuing CBT did not experience the same increased risk of
recurrence as those discontinuing ADM (e.g. Paykel et al., 1999).
Several studies modiﬁed the CBT delivered to focus speciﬁcally on
reducing residual symptoms (e.g. Fava, Rafanelli, Grandi, Canestrari, &

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

in the CBT or combination CBT and ADM arms of their trials relative to
the ADM monotherapy or placebo arms, though some studies did not
ﬁnd that
signiﬁcance. No
prescriptive eﬀect was found ADM discontinuation studies (Berwian
et al., 2017). On the whole, residual symptoms appear to moderate the
diﬀerential eﬀects of CBT over ADM.

3.3.5.2. Previous depressive episodes. There was inconclusive evidence
regarding moderation by previous episodes of the eﬀect of CBT or other
psychotherapies in comparison to ADM or treatment as usual (TAU) on
the risk of relapse or recurrence (Feng et al., 2012). A review of ADM
discontinuation studies found no moderating eﬀect (Berwian et al.,
2017). In contrast a review of psychological therapy studies (Beshai
et al., 2011) presented some evidence of a prescriptive eﬀect of
previous episodes
therapy
ameliorated the increased risk of recurrence relative to the passive/
TAU comparison condition. This occurred when considering histories of
three or more episodes compared to less than three in two small MBCT
trials, and ﬁve or more compared to less than ﬁve episodes in one study
of CBT (see Supplementary Materials Fig. 3 for a graphical
representation of these eﬀects). So, although widely accepted as a
prescriptive index in the ﬁeld, the quality of evidence to support this
eﬀect is relatively weak.

3.3.5.3. Demographics. Sex did not moderate the eﬀect of ADM
treatments in ﬁve primary studies reviewed by Berwian et al. (2017).
No prescriptive eﬀects were found in ADM discontinuation trials for
age, race or ethnicity (Berwian et al., 2017). On the whole, the evidence
is largely unsupportive of a prescriptive eﬀect by demographic factors.

3.3.5.4.1. Childhood maltreatment. The

of
childhood maltreatment was very rarely assessed. One RCT assessed
in one review (Clarke et al., 2015) found that those with more severe
childhood maltreatment were less likely to relapse if treated with MBCT
relative to TAU, but not less likely to relapse if treated with MBCT
compared to clinical psychoeducation, and there was no diﬀerence in
the likelihood of relapse between the treatment groups for those with
less severe childhood maltreatment (Williams et al., 2014). So, there is
limited evidence of prescription.

3.3.5.4.2. Comorbidities. Berwian et al. (2017) found higher rates of
relapse in patients with most types of comorbid anxiety symptoms that
discontinued ADM compared to those on continuation ADM in one
primary study, although phobic anxiety and somatic anxiety symptoms
interact with treatment eﬀects. Patients with delusional
did not
symptoms were less likely to relapse if treated with ECT and ADM
compared to ADM alone in three studies reviewed by Bourgon and
Kellner (2000). On the whole,
there is minimal evidence of a
prescriptive eﬀect.

3.3.5.4.3. Coping style. Avoidant coping style and daily hassles were
found to have a prescriptive eﬀect in two successive reports from the
same study with diﬀerent lengths of follow-up (Bockting et al., 2006;
Bockting, Spinhoven, Wouters, Koeter, & Schene, 2009) included in one
review (Beshai et al., 2011). These studies suggested a three-way
interaction with avoidant coping, treatment allocation and a history
of multiple prior episodes such that a history of more prior episodes
reduced the eﬀect of avoidant coping style on risk of recurrence in the
TAU group, however this history was associated with an increased
eﬀect of avoidant coping on recurrence in the preventive CBT plus TAU
group. Further, reporting more daily hassles was associated with
recurrence in the TAU group but not in the preventive CBT plus TAU
group, and unusually, reporting more negative life events between
16 years of age and the index depressive episode was associated with
higher odds of recurrence in the preventive CBT plus TAU group but not
in the TAU group (Beshai et al., 2011). However, the randomised

20

groups diﬀered signiﬁcantly both in the number or prior episodes and
levels of self-reported daily hassles making this ﬁnding diﬃcult to
interpret. Overall, there is some limited evidence of a prescriptive eﬀect
but it is far from conclusive.

3.3.5.4.4. Rumination. Two primary studies in one review found
that patients with high levels of rumination were less likely to have a
recurrence if treated with CBT or MBCT compared to ADM or TAU
(Beshai et al., 2011). The evidence is sparse but suggestive of a
prescriptive role for rumination.

Table 3 presents the matrix of factors associated with relapse or

recurrence examined in the included reviews.

3.4. Discussion

Study 1 was a meta-review of systematic reviews and found that two
prognostic factors were consistently associated with relapse or recur-
rence, with strong evidence: childhood maltreatment and residual
symptoms of depression post-treatment. Childhood maltreatment was
considered in only a single review but one that was of such quality and
included multiple large and high quality studies that the evidence it
provided was compelling (Nanni et al., 2011). The notion that residual
symptoms predict subsequent relapse and recurrence is wholly con-
sistent with “conventional wisdom” and the extant literature. There was
some suggestion that both factors may act as prescriptive factors that
moderate treatment eﬀects, although childhood maltreatment was only
assessed in one primary study reported in a single review (Clarke et al.,
2015) and residual symptoms was only assessed in a handful of primary
studies in two reviews (Beshai et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2012). So, we
have less conﬁdence with respect to each as prescriptive indices com-
pared to their prognostic status.

A history of prior depressive episodes also appeared to be prog-
nostic, as it was associated with greater risk of relapse or recurrence in
three of the four reviews in which it was assessed (Beshai et al., 2011;
Clarke et al., 2015; Hardeveld et al., 2010), but the evidence was nei-
ther as strong nor as consistent as it was for childhood maltreatment or
residual symptoms, and in one instance it was only prognostic among
patients who were free from residual symptoms (Judd et al., 1998). A
history of prior episodes may also be prescriptive with respect to MBCT
and CBT: a prescriptive eﬀect was found in the ﬁrst two MBCT RCTs,
both of which were conducted in small samples by the same research
group, but this eﬀect has not been replicated since because patients
with less than three episodes are now routinely excluded from those
trials. Similarly, one study has shown in a post hoc analysis that CBT's
enduring eﬀect (relative to TAU) was only evident among patients with
ﬁve or more episodes, but this ﬁnding has yet to be replicated (Bockting
et al., 2005). A review of ADM discontinuation studies found no pre-
scriptive eﬀect (Berwian et al., 2017). Therefore, while a history of
prior episodes appears to be prognostic and may well be prescriptive,
the certainty with which this eﬀect has been accepted in the ﬁeld ap-
pears to be somewhat overstated.

Despite the widespread acceptance of the distinction between re-
lapse and recurrence virtually none of the reviews included in this
meta-review distinguished between them. The only one that did sug-
gested that residual symptoms had a prognostic eﬀect on relapse but
not on recurrence (Beshai et al., 2011). This hypothesis is plausible and
suggests that it might be worthwhile to keep the distinction between
the two phenomena in subsequent research. However, due to the lack of
separation between the two in the reviewed literature we now refer to
relapse only when results are relevant only to relapse, and to recurrence
when they might be relevant to either or both.

Other relevant ﬁndings could highlight diﬀerential mechanisms of
recurrence for those who have received diﬀerent modes of treatment.
Patients with comorbid anxiety were particularly likely to relapse if
they discontinued ADM (Berwian et al., 2017) and there was evidence
of a prognostic eﬀect of psychiatric comorbidities (including anxiety
disorders) on the risk of recurrence (Clarke et al., 2015; Hardeveld

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

et al., 2010). Somewhat surprisingly given its status in the “conven-
tional wisdom”, only one review considered the eﬀect of neuroticism on
recurrence and this was based on just three primary studies from two
cohorts (Hardeveld et al., 2010). Re-assessment of the primary studies
suggested consistent evidence that higher neuroticism is associated
with greater risk for recurrence. Age of initial depressive onset, dura-
tion of depression, and severity of the last depressive episode were not
found to have prescriptive eﬀects on recurrence in those discontinuing
ADM (Berwian et al., 2017), although a more severe index episode
maybe a prognostic indicator of greater odds of recurrence (Hardeveld
et al., 2010). There was some limited evidence for a prognostic eﬀect of
chronic interpersonal stress being associated with greater risk of relapse
(Beshai et al., 2011), and both prognostic and prescriptive eﬀects such
that those experiencing high levels of stress day-to-day responded
better to CBT than to TAU (Beshai et al., 2011). There was some evi-
dence of a prognostic eﬀect of medication resistance pre-treatment on
relapse for those treated with ECT (Bourgon & Kellner, 2000). Physical
illness comorbid to depression was not prognostic for recurrence (Kok
et al., 2013). Certain groups of factors related to cognitive information
processing and cognitive biases, particularly rumination were asso-
ciated with greater risk for recurrence prognostically and with better
outcomes prescriptively for those with high levels of rumination from
CBT and MBCT relative to TAU or ADM, but with very few studies as-
sessing these eﬀects (Beshai et al., 2011).

This meta-review had several limitations. It relied on the quality of
the reviews studied rather than the quality of the primary studies re-
viewed therein, and by reporting results from published reviews of
published studies might be even more aﬀected by publication bias than
a systematic review of primary studies. This meta-review was focussed
on highlighting the completeness of the literature, identifying where
gaps in the literature lie and formulating suggestions of how such gaps
might be ﬁlled, so it was beyond its scope to perform meta-analyses of
primary studies. Nonetheless, during the process of this meta-review it
became clear that there were inconsistencies and errors in the reporting
of eﬀects in certain reviews that required a reassessment of the primary
studies. Several of these “misclassiﬁcations” were due to consideration
of multivariate not univariate eﬀects. As the included reviews diﬀered
in the extent to which they relied on univariate or multivariate asso-
ciations, we considered univariate eﬀects only to avoid any incon-
sistencies.

There was a lack of consistent reporting on moderators of treat-
ments. However, given the likely insuﬃcient statistical power in many
RCTs to investigate patient-by-treatment interactions a meta-analysis
based on individual patient data (IPDMA) is indicated (Bower et al.,
2013). One such IPDMA was included here but was limited to dis-
continuation of just two types of ADM in four primary studies. There
was also a lack of reviews that adequately assessed the prognostic ef-
fects of many risk factors, particularly in untreated samples, and re-
cently two large cohort studies have published new articles reporting
prognostic eﬀects on recurrence. So, a further review of appropriate
cohort studies, including a meta-analysis of the prognostic eﬀects of
apparent risk factors is indicated to better address the question of risk
factors for recurrence; this will be the focus of Study 2.

The two factors found to be most consistently associated with re-
currence prognostically give rise to further questions: whether or not
they diﬀerentially impact risk for relapse compared to recurrence is
unclear; the type and intensity of both residual symptoms and child-
hood maltreatment suﬃcient to increase the risk of recurrence has yet
to be determined. It is also unclear from the literature whether the
absence of one or both factors is suﬃcient to remove the risk of re-
currence altogether. Similarly, the less consistently found prognostic
eﬀect of previous episodes is also non-speciﬁc, it is unclear whether or
not there is a linear or non-linear eﬀect, and whether there is a ceiling
to this. It is also unclear if the type of episode suﬀered in each recur-
rence aﬀects the prognosis, and how treatments (whether the same
continued over time or diﬀerent treatments trialled singularly or in

combination) diﬀerentially impact prognosis in patients with particular
numbers of previous episodes. There were several factors suggested to
be associated with recurrence that have the potential to help elucidate
mechanisms and so could guide research into eﬀective prevention
strategies, but there were very few primary studies assessing these ef-
fects. It may be that other thematic reviews focussed speciﬁcally on
these factors, may provide further information on the mechanisms and
help guide thinking about how to address this issue. This will be the
focus of Study 3, but ﬁrst we turn to consideration of studies that might
help better understand the prognostic eﬀect of previous depressive
episodes and other factors on the risk of recurrence.

4. Study 2 – systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies

4.1. Aim

Prospective cohort studies that follow depressed patients for years
across the course of treatment while tracking outcomes like remission
and recovery are particularly well suited to investigate prognostic risk
factors for recurrence of depression. They are especially suited to
consider whether there are diﬀerential risk factors for relapse versus
recurrence (for example, whether number of prior episodes predicts
recurrence but not relapse). The aim of Study 2 was therefore to review
prospective cohort studies of adults with depression.

4.2. Methods

We used the same searches and procedures that we used in Study 1
but applied a diﬀerent set of inclusion and exclusion criteria (see
Table 1) to identify cohort studies reporting on prognostic factors as-
sociated with relapse or recurrence of depression and to extract their
data for both qualitative and quantitative syntheses.

4.2.1. Quality ratings

Quality ratings were made based on the GRACE checklist (Dreyer,
Velentgas, Westrich, & Dubois, 2014), details of which can be found in
the Supplementary Materials preceding Table 3.

4.2.2. Quantitative synthesis

Meta-analyses were conducted for each prognostic index using
Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.3 (http://ims.cochrane.org/
revman) (Cochrane, 2008) with studies grouped based on whether or
not they reported on the risk factor of interest. If more than one study
from the same cohort and using the same sample (rather than diﬀerent
subsamples) reported on the risk factor only the study with the highest
sample size was chosen with others from the same cohort excluded from
the given analysis. When suﬃcient data were provided in the published
articles or any online supplementary materials accompanying the arti-
cles these were entered into the meta-analyses or information from
these sources was used to derive the appropriate measure of eﬀect for
each study. When this was not possible authors were contacted for
unpublished data from their studies. As discussed above we chose to use
univariate, unadjusted measures of eﬀect. The measures of eﬀect were
entered into random eﬀects meta-analyses using the generic inverse
variance method (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986) to derive summary odds
ratios or hazard ratios and their 95% conﬁdence intervals. If both an
odds ratio and hazard ratio were given for the same risk factor in a
minimum of two studies from diﬀerent cohorts, separate meta-analyses
were conducted for each measure of eﬀect.

Heterogeneity was assessed using the tau-squared statistic and risk-
of-bias judgements were made using the GRACE quality ratings as de-
scribed above. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.
Statistical adjustments for potential reporting bias were not made given
the small number of studies included in each meta-analysis and the lack
of evidence for the direction of any potential publication or reporting
bias on the eﬀect of the given risk factors. However, sensitivity analyses

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

were planned such that low quality studies would be removed and if
two studies from the same cohort used diﬀerent means of deﬁning or
measuring the risk factor of interest the one excluded from the primary
analysis would replace the other study from the same cohort, in order to
consider the consistency of the ﬁndings. Further sensitivity analyses
were planned to remove studies that reported only multivariate data to
consider the unadjusted eﬀects of the risk factors on recurrence.

4.3. Results

Twelve studies were identiﬁed as meeting inclusion criteria from
the bibliographic database searches and were included in the present
review (see Supplementary Fig. 4).

4.3.1. Characteristics of included studies

Of the twelve reviewed articles six were from the Netherlands Study
of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) and a further three were from the
Collaborative Depression Study (CDS), so although the individual stu-
dies sometimes drew diﬀerent subsamples or included diﬀerent periods
of follow-up there were only ﬁve separate cohorts represented in the
articles reviewed (see Table 4 and Supplementary Table 3 for details).
The cohorts were drawn from populations in only two countries, the
USA [CDS, NESARC and the Group Health Cooperative (GHC: Gopinath
et al. (2007) study] and the Netherlands (NESDA and NEMESIS). The
USA cohorts tended to draw on more severely impaired clinical popu-
lations that required participants to be seeking or to have sought
treatment, with high rates of inpatient care in the CDS and participants
at high risk of recurrence due to their clinical presentations in the GHC
study. In contrast, the Dutch cohorts included community samples of
depressed people not seeking or receiving treatment, and drew more
from primary care than specialist care centres. Both NESDA and CDS
limited their study populations in terms of ethnicity either indirectly as
in NESDA by requiring all participants to be able to speak ﬂuently in
Dutch or directly as in CDS which only recruited white English speaking
American adults. All studies excluded participants at baseline if they
had diagnoses of Bipolar disorder or psychotic conditions though some
of the CDS studies kept participants in the cohort if their episodes were
reclassiﬁed later as Bipolar or Schizoaﬀective. The CDS cohort stands
apart from the others by having up to 15 years of completed follow-up
compared to no more than six years for the other cohorts. Only the GHC
study controlled treatment (it was a cohort formed from an RCT that
found no main eﬀect for treatment) and the CDS measured ADM or ECT
received weekly but did not control treatment. None of the studies
measured any psychological therapies received either historically or
during follow-up.

4.3.2. Study quality

Study quality was assessed using the GRACE checklist (Dreyer et al.,
2014), no overall quality descriptions were assigned unlike the quality
ratings of the systematic reviews included in Study 1 above, see Sup-
plementary Table 4 for details.

4.3.3. Qualitative synthesis (see Supplementary Table 6).
4.3.3.1. Childhood maltreatment. A prognostic eﬀect of a history of
childhood maltreatment being associated with greater odds of
recurrence was endorsed by all ﬁve of the studies across four cohorts
to have assessed this (Gopinath et al., 2007; Hardeveld et al., 2013a;
Hardeveld et al., 2014; Hardeveld et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014).

4.3.3.2. Residual symptoms. All studies that assessed the eﬀect of
residual symptoms found evidence of an association with increased
risk of recurrence.

4.3.3.3. Previous depressive episodes. Seven studies across four cohorts
found evidence of a prognostic eﬀect of previous depressive episodes on
the odds or hazard of recurrence. Three of these compared any previous

episodes to none (Hardeveld et al., 2013a NEMESIS; Hardeveld et al.,
2013b NESDA; Hardeveld et al., 2014 NESDA), two from the CDS
reported an increase in risk with each consecutive episode (Mueller
et al., 1999; Solomon et al., 2000), one measured a history of three or
more compared to less than three episodes (Gopinath et al., 2007 GHC),
and one measured a history of four or more compared to less than four
episodes (Judd et al., 1998 CDS). Two studies did not ﬁnd an
association between the odds of recurrence and having two or three
compared to just one previous episodes (not compared to zero previous
episodes). One only assessed the eﬀect in participants that had been in
remission for at least six months (Spinhoven, Drost, de Rooij, van
Hemert, & Penninx, 2016) and the other found that the variable was
still important in a predictive model of recurrence (Wang et al., 2014).
Further, when calculating the odds ratios for previous episodes from the
study by Mueller et al. (1999) there was a considerable diﬀerence
between the comparison of any or no previous episodes, two compared
to one previous episode, and of at least three compared to less than
three previous episodes (see Supplementary Table 5). In addition, two
of the CDS studies reported that the eﬀect was impacted by a third
factor. In one CDS study those without residual symptoms were at only
a modestly increased risk of recurrence if they had a history of four or
more episodes (Judd et al., 1998), and in another those with ﬁve or
more depression free years were not at increased risk of recurrence even
if they had a history of multiple previous episodes (Mueller et al.,
1999). Unpublished data from the authors of the Spinhoven et al.
(2016) NESDA study support this latter ﬁnding as comparing any to no
previous episodes was associated with a considerably higher odds of
recurrence than restricting this comparison to cohort members that had
been in remission for at least six months; the eﬀect estimate was
reduced by approximately 27%. So, it appears that the prognostic eﬀect
of prior episodes on recurrence is strongest when comparing any to no
prior episodes, in the absence of residual symptoms, and when the
period of recovery is less than ﬁve years. In the converse of these
conditions the prognostic eﬀect is either considerably weaker or absent
altogether. Further,

4.3.3.4. Severity of depression. More severe symptoms of depression at
the start of an episode were associated with greater probability of
recurrence in GHC, NEMESIS, and NESDA but not in CDS.

4.3.3.5. Duration of depression. A longer duration of the index episode
was associated with greater odds of recurrence in CDS as was longer
duration of the longest ever past depressive episode in GHC, but the
percentage of months with depression in the past year was not
associated with recurrence in NESDA.

4.3.3.6. Age of initial onset. Only two cohorts assessed age of onset, one
found that a younger age of ﬁrst onset was associated with shorter time
to recurrence (NEMESIS), and there was a borderline eﬀect for this in
NESDA.

4.3.3.7. Family history of depression. Findings were inconsistent with
respect to family history of depression; it predicted increased risk for
recurrence in NESARC but not in GHC or NESDA.

4.3.3.8. Neuroticism. Higher neuroticism predicted recurrence in GHC
(as reported in Study 1 above). In NEMESIS and one NESDA study there
were small univariate but not multivariate eﬀects (Hardeveld et al.,
2013a NEMESIS; Spinhoven et al., 2016 NESDA) and another NESDA
study found no univariate association between neuroticism and the
hazard of recurrence (Hardeveld et al., 2013b).

4.3.3.9. Demographics. Younger age at baseline was associated with

25

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

greater likelihood of recurrence in NEMESIS but not in CDS, NESARC or
NESDA. Marital status, race and gender predicted recurrence in
NESARC but not in two diﬀerent samples of the NESDA cohort
(Hardeveld et al., 2014; Spinhoven et al., 2016).

4.3.3.10. Comorbidities. A recent history of anxiety disorders (in
NESDA and NESARC) and symptoms of fear or panic (GHC) were
associated with greater odds of recurrence, although unlike other
anxiety disorders comorbid panic disorder was not associated with
recurrence in those that had been in remission for at least six months
(NESDA: Spinhoven et al., 2016). Comorbid anxiety disorders were not
related to greater speed of recurrence in NEMESIS (Hardeveld et al.,
2013a). There was some evidence of an association with increased risk
of recurrence for: multiple physical symptoms (NESDA: Dijkstra-
Kersten et al., 2017), chronic pain grade, the total number of chronic
pain locations and particularly neck, chest, or abdominal pain (NESDA:
Gerrits et al., 2014); comorbid physical health problems (NESDA); and
avoidant personality disorder (NESARC).

4.3.3.11. Others

4.3.3.11.1. ADM medication. Adherence was associated with lower
odds of recurrence in the one study to assess this (GHC), being on ADM
was not associated with recurrence in CDS but was in NESDA. Given
that the latter study sampled predominantly from community settings
this could suggest that being on ADM was a proxy for risk of recurrence
in that only those most at risk were given ADM.

Other factors found to be associated with increased risk of recur-
rence but only assessed in a single cohort were: rumination, worry,
experiential avoidance, psychosocial diﬃculties (all NESDA); lower
self-eﬃcacy (GHC); elevated cortisol awakening response (NESDA); and
physical, racial and sexual abuse in adulthood (NESARC).

4.3.3.11.2. Quantitative syntheses. There were suﬃcient data from
the reviewed studies on eight prognostic risk factors to combine in
meta-analyses (Fig. 1). The data for each factor were sometimes
reported as odds ratios and other times as hazard ratios (only number
of prior episodes was reported using both). Greater heterogeneity was
observed among studies evaluating previous depressive episodes,
residual symptoms, neuroticism and age at baseline, with very little
heterogeneity in studies evaluating childhood maltreatment, family
history of depression, and age at ﬁrst onset. On the basis of the
the presence of residual depressive
combined summary statistics,
symptoms, a history of childhood maltreatment, a history of previous
episodes (when comparing any to zero previous episodes and when
comparing more than three to less than three previous episodes), a
younger age at ﬁrst depressive onset, and past or present comorbid
likelihood of
anxiety disorders were associated with a greater
recurrence. A history of two compared to one, or three or more
compared to one previous depressive episode, higher neuroticism, a
family history of depression, and younger age at baseline were not
signiﬁcant risk factors. Summary statistics could not be calculated for
baseline symptom severity as measures of eﬀect were diﬀerent across
the studies, no measures of eﬀect were reported or calculable for
duration of the index episode, and although two studies reported
hazard ratios for being on ADM they were from the same sample so
were not combined.

4.3.3.11.3. Sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses were conducted
for all of the analyses involving data from the NESARC cohort which
included more than one other study, as only multivariable results were
published in Wang et al. (2014) and all other studies reported
univariate results for each factor. No sensitivity analyses were
performed removing studies based on their GRACE quality ratings as
there would have been insuﬃcient data to quantitatively synthesise
results across
the remaining studies. Sensitivity analyses were
conducted to assess: 1) The odds of recurrence for two compared to
one previous episode deleting data from the NESARC cohort (Wang
et al., 2014), this resulted in an OR(95%CI) = 1.05(0.62–1.79), that

direction of the summary estimate [OR(95%CI) = 1.45(1.22–1.72)],
compared to [OR(95%C) = 1.50(1.27–1.77)] in the primary analysis.

4.4. Discussion

Study 2 was in general agreement with Study 1 in that the strongest
evidence for prognostic risk factors for recurrence to depression ap-
peared to be for childhood maltreatment and residual depressive
symptoms. Recurrent patients with a history of prior episodes were
clearly at elevated risk compared to patients in their ﬁrst episode, but
risk did not appear to increase much with each successive episode; it
remained relatively static. Risk was thought to increase as a function of
an increasing number of episodes in the CDS (Mueller et al., 1999;
Solomon et al., 2000) and those ﬁndings largely deﬁned the consensus
in the ﬁeld. However, as shown in Supplementary Materials Figs. 3a-3e
only slightly higher percentages of participants had another recurrence
with each subsequent episode observed prospectively, and with each
further prior episode pre-baseline, and these recurrences occurred in-
creasingly quickly. The increase in percentages after the ﬁrst recurrence
was largest in going from one to two recurrences or prior episodes, with
small increases beyond that. In addition, the odds of having a recur-
rence did not increase signiﬁcantly when comparing each additional
prior episode to one fewer prior episode, or each subsequent episode
measured prospectively, suggesting a monotonic function with dimin-
ishing increments with each episode. Only CDS gave suﬃcient data to
consider these eﬀects as the other studies dichotomized on the number
of prior episodes, likely due to sample size. Overall, it appears that risk
increases with each successive episode but by far the largest increment
is associated with the increment from zero (not recurrent) to one or
more prior episodes (recurrent) and that subsequent increments asso-
ciated with successive episodes are modest at best and decline in
magnitude. In addition, a history of prior recurrence was most prog-
nostic among patients who were in full remission (residual symptoms
trumps recurrence) (Judd et al., 1998) and not among patients re-
covered for at least ﬁve years (Mueller et al., 1999).

Family history of depression and age at baseline were not associated
with increased likelihood of recurrence. There was some support for a
prognostic eﬀect of neuroticism although the ﬁndings were inconsistent
across the reviewed studies. Unlike in Study 1, age of ﬁrst onset was
found to be associated with a marginal increase in the hazard of re-
currence, and it seems likely that increased severity of the index de-
pressive episode and longer durations of depression are also associated
with increased risk of recurrence. A recent or lifetime history of co-
morbid anxiety disorders was associated with increased probability of
recurrence although there was not universal agreement on which dis-
orders and symptoms are associated with recurrence. There was some

evidence that the following were also associated with greater prob-
ability of recurrence, albeit with evidence from only one cohort for
each: avoidant personality disorder; a high degree of fear or panic
symptoms; rumination; worry; experiential avoidance; multiple phy-
sical symptoms; chronic pain (grade, number of locations and overall
and various speciﬁc locations) and other comorbid physical health
problems; psychosocial diﬃculties; lower self-eﬃcacy; racial, physical
or sexual abuse in adulthood; and higher cortisol response.

There were virtually no data on relapse as all the reviewed studies
measured recurrences in terms of the Rush et al. (2006) deﬁnitions.
Therefore there was no way to investigate the hypothesis that multiple
previous episodes might be a risk factor for recurrence not relapse. The
reviewed cohort studies found very good evidence for residual symp-
toms as a risk factor for recurrence and it is likely that this is relevant to
both relapse (as found in Study 1) and recurrence, contrary to the hy-
pothesis that residual symptoms are only relevant to relapse and prior
episodes only relevant to recurrence.

The ﬁndings on previous episodes of depression add weight to the
ﬁndings of Study 1 above in that overall the prognostic eﬀect appears to
be strongest when comparing any to no previous episodes but that there
is some inconsistency beyond that, with only modest support for a
linear increase in the risk as the number of episodes increase (for more
detail see Supplementary Discussion).

A number of other factors were also found to predict risk of recur-
rence. Not adhering to the ADM treatment regime or not being in re-
ceipt of ADM was associated with greater risk of recurrence in the
clinical samples when medication use was closely monitored, though

28

being prescribed ADM was associated with a greater hazard of recur-
rence in a mixed community and clinical setting sample, perhaps re-
presenting a proxy for risk in this setting. This ﬁts with clinical lore on
the importance of continuation and maintenance ADM and their role in
treatment oﬀered by specialised mental health services. Finding a
prognostic eﬀect for chronic pain was somewhat at odds with the
ﬁndings from Study 1 although the study reviewed here oﬀered greater
speciﬁcity on the eﬀects by considering types, degrees and locations of
pain, which might explain the discrepancy. Some of the ﬁndings from
the cohort studies were more contradictory to the ﬁndings of Study 1 in
that there was some evidence to suggest that younger age of initial
depressive onset, and severity of the index episode, were associated
with greater odds of recurrence. There was also some evidence that
female sex, and the duration of episodes were associated with recur-
rence but the evidence was not consistent and could have been due to a
lack of appropriate adjustment for potential Type I errors.

throughout

Overall, only twelve articles from ﬁve diﬀerent cohorts met our
inclusion criteria. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 many other arti-
cles were considered including those from well-known large-scale co-
hort studies but most did not have continuous measurement of symp-
toms
some were based on children and
adolescents rather than adults, and others did not report risk factors for
recurrence. So, the included studies only drew samples from the USA
and the Netherlands and most restricted the ethnicity of their samples
either directly or indirectly. This opens up our ﬁndings to potential
problems of generalisability to the wider population of people at risk of
recurrence, and to potential biases associated with publication and

follow-up,

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

reporting. Inspection of the funnel plots suggested relatively robust
ﬁndings but it is likely that whatever publication and reporting biases
exist would have pulled results towards the null. This might perhaps
have resulted in fewer prognostic indicators being found or less strong
support for those that were found.

There were only three factors consistently found to have a prog-
nostic eﬀect on the risk of recurrence across all cohorts in which they
were studied but all have somewhat limited clinical utility as a patient's
history is unmodiﬁable and many studies have shown that it is not
possible for all patients to remit to the point of being asymptomatic
(e.g. Paykel, 2008). Factors such as cortisol response, rumination and
experiential avoidance assessed here and others such as cognitive and
information processing biases indicated as potentially prognostic for
recurrence in Study 1, might have greater clinical utility as they are
potentially modiﬁable; they might also have a mechanistic role in the
action of the risk factors highlighted here. We could not have in-
vestigated such things from the articles reviewed in Studies 1 and 2 thus
far. In order to broaden the consideration of the literature on the re-
ported eﬀects of potentially modiﬁable risk factors and reported me-
chanisms of action, we would need to consider a diﬀerent but related
literature. This is the focus for the next phase of the review, Study 3.

5. Study 3 – meta-review of non-systematic reviews

5.1. Aim

There was limited evidence derived from systematic reviews and
cohort studies of potentially modiﬁable risk factors for recurrence of
depression. However, a number of other potential risk factors were
described that might be modiﬁable and merit further consideration. The
aim therefore was to consider the literature on those potentially mod-
iﬁable risk factors and consider mechanisms of action proposed in the
literature. There were relatively few systematic reviews that focussed
on identifying risk factors and mechanisms for recurrence but a large
number of non-systematic reviews that did so but as they were non-
systematic did not meet inclusion criteria for Study 1. So, in our third
study, we undertook a meta-review of the non-systematic reviews re-
porting on risk factors for recurrence of depression or the mechanisms
by which risk factors might have their eﬀect.

5.2. Methods

We used the same searches and procedure for identiﬁcation of stu-
dies conducted for Study 1 but applied a diﬀerent set of inclusion and
exclusion criteria as detailed in the General Methods (above).

5.2.1. Quality ratings

Since they do not typically report any speciﬁc methods for con-
ducting the review it is reasonable to assume that against any existing
quality rating criteria for systematic reviews all would be judged as of
very low quality.

5.3. Results

Twenty-seven non-systematic reviews were identiﬁed as meeting
inclusion criteria and were included in the present study (see
Supplementary Fig. 7). The primary studies included in each of the non-
systematic reviews were checked against those reviewed in the sys-
tematic reviews in Study 1 to ensure that they were able to contribute
knowledge beyond those ﬁndings. Of the 1598 studies included in all 27
non-systematic reviews, only 30 were included in reviews in both Study
1 and Study 3. None of the 27 non-systematic reviews included more
than two articles reviewed in Study 1.

5.3.1. Characteristics of the included reviews

Given the lack of a standardised format of reporting results for

qualitative reviews data extracted from each study diﬀered and de-
termining whether or not the eﬀects reported were prognostic or pre-
scriptive (and if prescriptive what the interactions suggest) was not
always possible (see Supplementary Table 8). All of the included studies
reviewed clinical trials, cohort studies, experimental studies, or neu-
roimaging studies, with 15 of the 27 including more than one type of
study. Several of the included studies also reviewed case-control stu-
dies, cross-sectional studies, quasi-experimental studies, or animal
studies.

5.3.2. Matrix of
recurrence

factors associated/not associated with relapse or

Details of the factors associated with recurrence in each of the in-
cluded reviews along with any proposed mechanism of action can be
found in Table 4. Many of the reviews reported on factors adding
weight to some of the ﬁndings that had little or inconsistent evidence
from Study 1. Risk factors associated with greater odds of recurrence
were: the presence of cognitive biases (eight reviews); stressful life
events (nine reviews); and rumination (six reviews). However, a
number of factors not identiﬁed in Study 1 were also associated with an
increased risk of recurrence: the presence of information processing
the hypothalamic pituitary
biases (ten reviews); dysregulation of
adrenal (HPA) axis (ﬁve reviews); and dysregulation of rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep (four reviews).

5.3.3. Mechanisms of action

There were some common themes among the proposed mechanisms
of action, including: the suggestion that cognitive biases were triggered
by a change in mood (becoming dysphoric); that there is a learned
association between the depressed state and the biases, as they occur
together; and that biases may trigger rumination by the diﬀerential
im-
processing of negatively and positively valenced information,
pacting the ability to recognise positive social cues, and privileging
depressogenic attributions. Such processes might further engage de-
pressive thinking that in turn might increase depressive symptoms and
eventually trigger a recurrence. These processes are associated with
limbic and neocortical reactivity to mood changes, especially dysre-
gulation of the HPA axis and inﬂammatory responses that may act as
diathesis for depressive onset, and are themselves associated with ge-
netic alterations as more distal risk factors. Dysregulated REM sleep
also interferes with the ability to process emotionally valenced in-
formation and regulate aﬀect, and is particularly aﬀected by alterations
in a number of REM sleep related genetic mechanisms.

5.4. Discussion

The twenty-seven non-systematic reviews provided some continuity
with what was found in Studies 1 and 2 above. The reviews point to
stressful life events, cognitive and information processing biases, and
ruminative thinking, in producing changes in mood. They also high-
lighted greater reactivity in the neocortical and limbic pathways and
dysregulation of the HPA axis as more directly related to recurrence.
There were suggestions that a number of genetic factors might act
prognostically, potentially further “up-stream” by giving rise to an
underlying diathesis for recurrent depression and potentially impacting
upon other factors, including those related to hippocampal volume,
brain maturation, REM sleep, and HPA axis dysregulation. There were
also some potentially prescriptive eﬀects highlighted including stressful
life events, rumination, cognitive and information processing biases,
and cognitive reactivity all of which might be more amenable to change
with psychological therapies, whereas dysregulation of REM sleep
might be more usefully treated with ADM. In addition, a prescriptive
eﬀective of childhood maltreatment such that treatment with MBCT
lowered the elevated risk of recurrence relative to treatment with TAU.
A number of genetic factors were highlighted as having potentially
prescriptive eﬀects, and mechanisms considered such that variants that

29

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

lead to greater HPA axis dysregulation or REM sleep dysregulation
might respond diﬀerentially to ADM compared to its absence in a
manner not needed by low risk patients without such genetic variants.
Given that the reviews were non-systematic, these indications must be
treated with caution.

Some investigators have reconceptualised models of depression to
consider relationships between cognitive and information processing
biases and the onset of depressive symptoms that suggest mechanistic
links between a number of the risk factors considered above (e.g.
Disner, Beevers, Haigh, & Beck, 2011; Roiser, Elliot, & Sahakian, 2012).
The “cognitive neuropsychological” model of depression (e.g. Roiser
et al., 2012) proposes that negative aﬀective biases result in changes in
monoamine transmission and that this gives rise to negative belief
systems that subsequently result in the signature features of a depres-
sive episode: anhedonia and dysphoria (Roiser et al., 2012). Such biases
rely on both “bottom-up processes” (triggered by emotionally salient
stimuli like stressful life events), and “top-down processes” (cognitive
mechanisms needed to inhibit reactions to emotionally salient but task-
irrelevant information are sub-optimal in depression) (e.g. Castaneda
et al., 2008; Roiser et al., 2012). These authors also suggested that
evidence for the mechanisms proposed in the “cognitive neuropsycho-
logical model” of depression will be best delivered by neuroimaging
studies or studies utilising an experimental paradigm to manipulate
mood, cognitive processing, or information processing (Roiser et al.,
2012). Given the ﬁndings of this meta-review, whereby potentially
important risk factors and mechanisms for recurrence of depression
have been alluded to but not assessed with suﬃcient depth in the lit-
erature, the ﬁnal phase of this review focuses on reviewing these types
of studies to better elucidate potential mechanisms of action.

6. Study 4 – systematic review of experimental & neuroimaging
studies

6.1. Aim

The ﬁnal study aimed to review neuroimaging and experimental
studies to further investigate factors proposed to be associated with
recurrence of depression in adults and to investigate potential me-
chanisms of action for those factors highlighted in Studies 1–3 above.

6.2. Methods

A systematic review was conducted of experimental and neuroi-
maging studies using the same search terms as for the previous three
studies and including further bibliographic databases as detailed in the
General Methods section above and in Table 1.

6.2.1. Quality ratings

Study quality was assessed with criteria proposed by Kmet, Lee, and
Cook (2004), using a 14-item rating scale where each item questions
how the study was conducted or reported, e.g. “Design evident and
appropriate to answer study question?” Each item has four possible
responses “yes”, “partial”, “no”, or “n/a”; items are given a score of two
if the answer is “yes”, one if the answer is “partial”, and zero if the
answer is either “no” or “n/a”. A summary score is then calculated by
summing the score from the 14 items and dividing it by 28 minus the
number of not-applicable items multiplied by two, to derive a total
score of between zero and one. Since no grading of study quality was
suggested by the authors (Kmet et al., 2004), GRADE categories (Guyatt
et al., 2008) were used as described above in Study 1. The following
was used to guide judgements of overall study quality, studies scoring
between: 0 and 0.25 were considered to be very low quality; 0.26 and
0.50 low quality; 0.51 and 0.75, or studies scoring above 0.75 but
scoring 0 on the sample size item or not scoring 2 on items related to
using appropriate outcome measures, conducting appropriate analyses,
and supporting conclusions from the data, were considered moderate

quality; studies that met these criteria and scored 0.76 or above they
were high quality.

Information extracted on factors thought to predict depressive re-
currence, along with any proposed mechanisms of action, was used to
build a matrix as in Studies 1–3 above.

6.3. Results

Twenty studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed (see

Supplementary Fig. 8).

6.3.1. Characteristics of the included studies

Fourteen of the twenty studies utilised experimental paradigms to
manipulate cognitive processing or induce sad mood via inductions
such as sombre music or tryptophan depletion. Three studies included
only neuroimaging, ﬁve included neuroimaging and an experimental
task such as the Stroop Colour-Word Task, and two were quasi-ex-
perimental with laboratory-based measurements of cognitive informa-
tion processing but no experimental manipulation [e.g. Risch et al.,
2010 used an Implicit Association Test to measure the association be-
tween implicit self-esteem and recurrent depressive episodes but did
not manipulate self-esteem), see Supplementary Table 8 for details].

6.3.2. Study quality

Nine of the included studies were judged to be of high quality, ten of
moderate quality and one of low quality (see Supplementary Table 9).

6.3.3. Factors associated with risk of relapse or recurrence

Several factors were associated with an increased risk of relapse or
recurrence, with good evidence from high quality experimental or
neuroimaging studies, although most of the studies investigated factors
associated with recurrence only and not relapse. Five high quality and
seven moderate quality studies found that cognitive and information-
processing biases were associated with an increased risk of relapse (one
study) and recurrence (11 studies). There was good evidence that
cognitive reactivity is associated with an increased risk of recurrence
from two high, three moderate, and one low quality study. One high
and another moderate quality study found that HPA axis dysregulation
was associated with an increased risk of recurrence. The neuroimaging
studies reported good evidence of dysregulation in areas related to
emotional or information processing and recurrence, in particular hy-
poactivity in neocortical and limbic areas (particularly the dmPFC and
rACC) (Nixon et al., 2013), reduced hippocampal volume (Arnone et al.,
2012; Kronmuller et al., 2008), and reduced grey matter volume in the
right anterior cingulate and right inferior frontal gyrus (Serra-Blasco
et al., 2016), see Table 5 and Supplementary Table 8 for details.

6.3.4. Mechanisms of action

Speciﬁc mechanisms of action were proposed in ﬁve studies (Chen
et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Lythe et al., 2015; Nixon et al., 2013;
Segal et al., 2006). Although the authors of the remaining studies did
not propose speciﬁc mechanisms there was some consistency across the
studies. Taken together the reviewed studies suggested a role for dys-
function in the neural networks responsible for information processing
or aﬀective and cognitive processing in response to stress. The results of
some studies suggested this might be inﬂuenced by dysfunction in the
HPA axis or other inﬂammatory responses, and changes in mood that
prevent appropriate reappraisals of negative experiences. Other studies
found that rumination prolonged negative mood and prevented uti-
lising social cues and social support, thus conferring greater risk of
recurrence.

6.4. Discussion

The ﬁnding that cognitive and information processing biases are
associated with an increased risk of recurrence from Studies 1, 2 and 3

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

above was further supported by the ﬁndings from the 20 studies in the
present review. HPA axis dysfunction, stressful life events, and greater
aﬀective reactivity were also associated with an increased risk of re-
currence. There was evidence of an increased risk of recurrence with
hypoactivity and morphological alterations in neocortical and limbic
regions and the proposed mechanism suggesting that these neurological
factors are associated with the cognitive and information processing
biases which themselves impact the ability to manage stress or changes
in mood, therefore providing support for the mechanisms alluded to in
Study 3 above.

7. General discussion

This series of reviews found strong evidence for three factors asso-
ciated with an increased risk of relapse and recurrence in depression: a
history of childhood maltreatment; residual depressive symptoms at the
end of treatment; and a history of recurrence. There was little evidence
that risk increased in a linear fashion as a function of the number of
prior episodes. Moreover, residual symptoms and duration of recovery
both play a moderating role such that a history of recurrence is mostly
prognostic only among patients in full remission (patients with residual
symptoms are at elevated risk regardless) and patients who sustain
recovery for ﬁve or more years move to low risk status. Younger age of
ﬁrst onset, greater severity of the index episode and high neuroticism
appear to be prognostic of recurrence but were not universally found to
be so in the literature. There was good evidence that having a comorbid
anxiety disorder is prognostic for risk and the same is true for high
levels of comorbid anxiety symptoms even sans diagnosis. Both rumi-
nation and cognitive biases were prognostic for subsequent recurrence,
as were aﬀective and information processing biases; attentional and
cognitive control; cognitive and aﬀective reactivity; dysregulation of
REM sleep; dysregulation of certain neuroendocrine functions and
dysfunction and morphological changes in associated neocortical and
limbic regions. Some studies reported that the duration of the index
episode was associated with greater risk of recurrence but others found
no such eﬀect. There was very limited and inconsistent evidence that
family history of depression is prognostic of recurrence. Only one of the
nearly seventy studies we reviewed looked at risk for relapse and re-
currence separately. This was both surprising and disconcerting given
the importance placed on the distinction and the implications that it has
for treatment.

There was some evidence that childhood maltreatment, residual
symptoms, and a history of recurrence all moderated the eﬀects of
treatment relative to controls, usually by virtue of reducing risk for
those at higher risk on these factors if allocated to an active treatment
group, down to a similar level to those low on the factors regardless of
treatment. Whether they moderate diﬀerential response among dif-
ferent speciﬁc active treatments remains to be seen. A number of other
factors were found to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence
as moderators of the eﬀects of psychological, somatic or pharmacolo-
gical treatments, these include rumination, cognitive and information
processing biases, cognitive reactivity, and dysregulation of REM sleep
in general;
interpersonal stress in psychosocial relapse prevention
treatments; medication resistance and DST reactivity for those treated
with ECT; and comorbid anxiety symptoms, somatic pain, and a shorter
time in response for those discontinuing ADM. On the basis of these
ﬁndings we developed a conceptual framework that can be utilised to
guide future research into relapse and recurrence.

7.1. Interpretation

That residual symptoms and a history of recurrence predict sub-
sequent risk ﬁts with the “consensus view” of recurrence, but the in-
clusion of childhood maltreatment is something new and suggests the
operation of novel mechanisms, discussed below and illustrated in
Fig. 2. The evidence was not conclusive that each successive episode

was associated with an increment in risk although there were several
mitigating factors that might explain this deﬁcit. The biggest problem is
that few studies reported risk as a function of number of prior episodes
but instead dichotomized at some point along the continuum in a
manner that makes it hard to test. Examination of the data from the one
study that did examine risk as a function of speciﬁc number of episodes
showed that there is an incremental eﬀect, that is largely monotonic in
nature but of decreasing magnitude. Residual symptoms and duration
of recovery both moderated that relationship such that a history of
recurrence was only prognostic among those in full remission and less
than ﬁve years in recovery. It is also possible that perceived or actual
risk drove more and longer treatment in a fashion that could have
masked such a relationship.

Causal processes unfold over time and some of our prognostic in-
dices may be more distal and others more proximal to the actual re-
currence. If this is the case, more proximal “down-stream” factors like
residual symptoms might be better predictors of subsequent recurrence
than more distal “up-stream” factors such as a history of recurrence,
this might explain why the strength of the eﬀect for previous episodes
was found to be less than that for residual symptoms. It is also possible
that all three factors are proxies for another underlying factor such as a
neurobiological diathesis for recurrence, and so although the number of
previous episodes has been considered to have a linear association with
recurrence this may not best reﬂect the nature of any such underlying
diathesis. If there is such a diathesis it would seem likely that it eﬀects
whether depressed patients end up with ruminative thinking patterns,
information processing and cognitive biases that give rise to a negative
self-concept once in recovery, as these appear to be related to a greater
risk of recurrence. Negative self-concept has itself been related to
multiple previous episodes (e.g. Elgersma, Glashouwer, Bockting,
Penninx, & de Jong, 2013). It also is possible that the risk of recurrence
related to having previous episodes is not static over time, and that the
cohorts that have found evidence of an eﬀect of multiple compared to
just one previous episode on recurrence might have captured diﬀerent
points in time when the risk may be diﬀerent. Considering the results of
the National Comorbidity Survey the 12-month prevalence of MDD
decreased with increasing age (Kessler et al., 2003), and when ex-
amining non-clinical samples from childhood onwards in the Oregon
Adolescent Depression Project there were more ﬁrst onsets at ages
13–18 than in adulthood and a peak of recurrences in the 18–24 year
old group which had lessened in the 24–30 year old group (Rohde,
Lewinsohn, Klein, Seeley, & Gau, 2013). The cohort followed in the CDS
was about half a decade younger than the cohorts followed in the other
studies (GHC, NEMESIS, NESARC and NESDA) and it is possible then
that multiple previous episodes is a better predictor of subsequent re-
currence for younger adults that no longer remains predictive if they
survive without recurrences into middle adulthood. This would be
consistent with the limited evidence from Study 2 that younger age of
onset is predictive of a marginal increase in the speed of recurrence. We
are not able to determine which if any of these reasons is correct, but
given the “consensus view” that the number of previous episodes is
important over and above simply having a history of recurrence, it
would have implications for the timing and optimal amount of treat-
ment. It is worth investigating whether increased risk is associated with
the number of episodes (if it is, it might either be because simply going
through a depressive episode increases subsequent risk or because risk
remains static, but high risk individuals have more episodes), particu-
larly when controlling for some of the issues that may have biased or
confounded the studies reporting this eﬀect (discussed in detail in
above).

Also of note was the inconsistent evidence for an association be-
tween neuroticism and increased risk of relapse or recurrence, which
although not part of the “consensus view” in the same way as history of
recurrence, has been reported to increase the risk of recurrence in many
studies in the past (e.g. Bos, Bouhuys, Geerts, Van Os, & Ormel, 2007).
Overall, across the four studies of this review it would appear as though

there is support for neuroticism as a prognostic indicator of recurrence
but the inconsistency in the ﬁndings is somewhat surprising; why it
should be associated with a greater odds of recurrence but not a greater
hazard of recurrence is puzzling and not explicable by any mechanism
considered in this review. It is more likely that this is an artifact of the
diﬀerent measures of neuroticism and diﬀerent samples used in the
studies that reported diﬀerent indices (hazards and odds of recurrence).
In the two studies from the same cohort (discussed in Study 1) the null
ﬁnding regarding the hazard of recurrence was close to reaching sig-
niﬁcance despite using a smaller subset than used in the study that
reported the odds of recurrence by neuroticism.

In Studies 1 and 2 we found good evidence that a recent history of
comorbid anxiety disorders or elevated symptoms of anxiety, and ru-
mination are also prognostic indicators of recurrence. Several of the
factors found to be associated with higher risk of recurrence in Studies 1
and 2 have yet to be replicated. These include chronic pain and multiple
physical symptoms, cognitive biases, cognitive reactivity to stress or
changes in mood, rumination, interpersonal stress, and a higher cortisol
awakening response. Further, Study 1 highlighted a number of pre-
scriptive factors that modiﬁed the risk of recurrence relative to the
eﬀects of certain treatments among patients that have residual symp-
toms the treatment used to achieve partial remission matters; dis-
continuing CBT may not lead to the same increased risk of recurrence as
discontinuing ADM does if the patient has residual symptoms. In ad-
dition in two small trials of MBCT a history of three or more previous
episodes was prescriptive such that those with this history did better
with MBCT than they did with ADM, and in one trial of CBT this pattern
occurred for those with ﬁve or more compared to less than ﬁve previous

episodes. However, as something cannot be prescriptive without being
prognostic at least in one of the treatment groups, and as these ﬁndings
were not supported by much of the rest of the reviewed literature this
suggested prescriptive eﬀect is worth further consideration. It could be
due to chance, a number of biases in those studies reporting the eﬀect
or a number of potentially alternative explanations, or it could point to
a “critical-mass” of previous episodes rather than a linear increase in
risk with each additional episode that could potentially be in keeping
with the ﬁndings of Study 2 here. However, we could not determine
which if any of these applies. There was also the suggestion of a pre-
scriptive eﬀect of childhood maltreatment with less bad outcomes for
those with such histories in MBCT relative to TAU. Study 3 oﬀered
further support to these factors and highlighted several others such as:
genetic vulnerabilities particularly relating to neurogenesis and REM
sleep; information processing biases; inﬂammatory responses/markers
particularly dysregulation of the HPA axis and C-reactive protein levels;
and REM sleep dysregulation. However, the studies reviewed were of
very low quality by virtue of being non-systematic and so their con-
clusions were considered with caution. Study 4 showed that there is
evidence for the associations between the cognitive, information pro-
cessing and aﬀective biases, and recurrence of depression considered in
Studies 1, 2 and 3. In addition it suggested that these biases may be
associated with dysregulation of neuroendocrine/inﬂammatory re-
sponses such as the HPA axis, reduced neuroplasticity and volumetric
changes particularly in limbic areas, and dysregulation of the neural
systems responsible for information processing and emotional proces-
sing (recognising emotions from facial expressions).

Studies 3 and 4 investigated mechanisms concerning the nature of

34

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

the relationships between risk factors and recurrence. These were
considered all together and used to inform the development of the
conceptual framework of relapse and recurrence of depression shown in
Fig. 2. Risk factors with strong evidence from Studies 1 and 2 were
given greater importance in the model than those identiﬁed in Studies 3
and 4 due to the higher quality of evidence from these types of studies
(Coleman et al., 2005). Potential mechanisms illustrated in the con-
ceptual framework were taken from related themes of proposed me-
chanisms in Studies 3 and 4, and were expressed in the model more
directly if the mechanism was explicitly tested in studies reviewed in
Study 4, rather than mechanisms proposed or alluded to but without
being directly tested in that way in Study 3.

The conceptual framework points to a focus in several domains: 1)
What population we might study to better understand prognostic in-
dices of recurrence of depression and the prescriptive steps that can be
taken to reduce that risk; 2) How research eﬀorts might better elucidate
the mechanisms driving recurrence and therefore how to potentially
prevent these outcomes; 3) How clinicians might modify their treat-
ments in lieu of more accurate prognostic indicators of recurrence; and
4) How treatments might interact with risk factors and mechanisms to
eﬀect risk for recurrence.

7.1.1. Clinical implications

From the conceptual framework clinicians might consider keeping
patients in treatment longer in an attempt to get them to the point of
full remission (minimal residual symptoms); targeting eﬀorts at pre-
vention to those not able to achieve full remission, those with a history
of childhood maltreatment, and those with a history of any prior re-
currences. In addition, longer and additional types of treatment might
be oﬀered to those whose ﬁrst depressive onset occurred at a younger
age, those with problems with rumination, those with a recent history
of or current comorbid anxiety disorders or high levels of anxiety
symptoms, and those with REM sleep dysregulation, with the latter two
indicating the consideration of ADM. The ﬁndings of these reviews
suggest that residual depressive symptoms might be a prescriptive
factor, modifying the eﬀects of treatments with CBT or continuation
ADM relative to ADM withdrawal. This raises the question of whether
combination therapy for those not treated to complete remission par-
ticularly adding psychological therapy after completing a course of
ADM, might help protect against or delay a recurrence. This has been
trialled successfully by adding CBT as ADMs are discontinued (Guidi
et al., 2015) and could be considered as a particularly protective option
given the suggestion that long term ADM use can in some patients
become a contributing factor in increasing risk for recurrence (Fava,
2003). These ﬁndings underscore the importance of assessing for a
history of childhood maltreatment and adding adjunctive psychological
interventions speciﬁcally targeting its residual eﬀects. Such interven-
tions might take the form of compassion-focussed work to target shame-
based diﬃculties and self-blame, cognitive behavioural interventions
targeting low self-esteem, trauma focussed interventions (if appro-
priate), or interpersonal interventions targeted at relational diﬃculties.
Further questions raised by this review centre around whether adding
interventions targeted at chronic pain, rumination, worry, cognitive
reactivity, interpersonal diﬃculties, sleep hygiene, and cognitive and
attentional control could also help reduce the risk of recurrence. Fi-
nally, we would encourage clinicians to assume that the number of
prior episodes is a useful index of future risk; the existing literature is
not as conclusive as we expected it to be, but that is more a lack of
supportive evidence than any clear indication that it is not so. It may be
that a history of recurrence or family history of depression are less
important than presence of residual symptoms or a history of childhood
trauma or it could be that the impact of all these factors is summative
and need to be considered.

7.1.2. Research implications

residual symptoms post-treatment; a history of childhood maltreat-
ment; a history of recurrence, comorbid or recent anxiety disorders; or
problems with rumination might be studied to enrich our under-
standing of the mechanisms underpinning relapse and recurrence. In
particular, greater focus might be given to investigating eﬀects of
childhood maltreatment on the neocortical and limbic pathways that
control processing of aﬀective information or cognitive control, and
outcomes of acute phase treatment for depression. Eﬀorts to further
develop our understanding of the mechanisms underlying relapse and
recurrence might include tests of information processing, cognitive and
aﬀective reactivity to stress or changes in mood and they might include
biological tests of inﬂammatory markers such as HPA axis regulation, C-
reactive protein expression or cortisol upon waking. Further, in neu-
roimaging studies they might particularly focus on neocortical and
limbic regions of interest involved in functions such as those above and
those involved in attentional or cognitive control. There are useful
examples of how future studies might be set up to best investigate these
factors. For example Lythe et al. (2015) included functional neuroi-
maging of people with remitted depression, recurrent depression and
stable depression, and had 14 months of follow-up to capture re-
currences. Another example is Watkins and Baracaia (2002) who used a
cross-sectional comparison having randomly allocated currently de-
pressed, recovered depressed and never depressed people to their ex-
perimental paradigm and controlled for treatment. In addition, the
conceptual framework suggests that as the identiﬁed mechanisms be-
come better elucidated, they become targets for intervention.

Finally, to better consider the eﬀect of increasing episodes, neuro-
ticism, age of onset, and duration and severity of depression on risk for
recurrence the best way to investigate this would be with a large-scale
prospective cohort study that: i) samples populations prior to ﬁrst onset
depression or which seeks to conﬁrm past experiences of depression
with corroborating evidence such as medical records or conﬁrmed
treatment history not just retrospective self-reports, and if sampling
populations with depression at baseline the study should stratify to
ensure representative samples from community, primary, secondary/
specialist and inpatient care settings; ii) contains a long-term follow-up;
iii) charts the course of symptom changes over the full follow-up period
(with the CIDI or LIFE interviews with life-chart analyses for example),
with clinical events conﬁrmed by appropriate clinicians or by corro-
borating evidence from medical records, so capturing all possible re-
iv) records all depression treatments over
lapses and recurrences;
follow-up either directly or through data linkage with health records or
national health surveillance systems or registers; and v) uses propensity
score matching or other methods to control for some of the selection
biases involved in treatment (who is treated, with what, at what dose,
and how long for). It would also be helpful if cohorts were developed
outside the USA or the Netherlands and included ethnically diverse
populations representative of the population of adults with depression
at large.

7.2. Limitations

There are several limitations to the approach taken in this paper.
Study 1 was limited by a paucity of systematic reviews of risk factors of
relapse and recurrence to depression, and in particular systematic re-
views that had a stated aim to identify or consider the relative strengths
of diﬀerent risk factors. The reviews included in Study 1 were equally
limited by a paucity of primary studies investigating risk factors as their
primary objective. The included reviews that attempted to do this were
of low or very low quality and so the results from these reviews were
necessarily treated with caution. Nonetheless, we were able to support
the “consensus view” (e.g. Campbell, 2009; Lin et al., 1998; Paykel &
Priest, 1992) with regard to residual symptoms, and to a lesser degree
than expected with regards to a history or previous episodes, and
propose the addition of childhood maltreatment.

From the conceptual framework we can speculate that those with:

Study 2 was limited by the small number of cohorts using

35

J.E.J. Buckman et al.

Clinical Psychology Review 64 (2018) 13–38

continuous measurement of symptoms over follow-up and robust
measures of conﬁrming relapses or recurrences, so all the reviewed
studies were from cohorts in the USA or the Netherlands. We limited
our inclusion criteria to studies of adults only; coupled with the in-
sistence on the continuous measurement of symptoms over follow-up,
this led to the exclusion of a number of big cohort studies. Were our
inclusion criteria less strict in this regard we would have been better
placed to investigate the eﬀects of increasing numbers of episodes, age
at baseline, and age of onset on the risk for recurrence.

Studies 1 and 3 were limited by the lack of reporting on the quality
of the studies reviewed in each reviewed article. While we judged the
quality of the reviews, it may be the case that some of the lower quality
reviews included high quality primary studies and therefore the ﬁnd-
ings from these may have eﬀectively been “downgraded” by the quality
criteria being applied at the level of the review and not at the level of
the included studies. Further, the reviews included in Studies 1 and 3
did not include a number of studies relevant to the present review. As a
part of the systematic review process, a large number of cohort studies
(not meeting inclusion criteria for Study 2), RCTs and case control
studies were identiﬁed that reported on risk factors for relapse or re-
currence but these studies were not included in the reviews which made
up Studies 1 and 3. That these studies were not included does not mean
that they were “missed”, instead they may just not have met the in-
clusion criteria of those reviews given that the aims of those reviews
were generally not focussed on speciﬁcally identifying risk factors for
relapse and recurrence of depression. While there were a number of
areas of agreement and themes coming out of our qualitative syntheses
of the four phases of this article, we were not able to combine results
across our four studies and were only able to conduct quantitative
synthesise on the data from the cohorts reviewed in Study 2. The “box
score” type method used to develop the matrices in each of the four
studies did not allow for sophisticated statistical testing or adjustments
for potential sources of bias, so we were unable to consider the impact
of publication bias on the results reported.

In addition, the individual studies included in the reviews in Studies
1 and 3 primarily used the Frank et al. (1991) deﬁnitions of relapse and
recurrence, but this may have led to a degree of bias in the results as
they tend to compare people who do not relapse or experience recur-
rence over the study period with people that do relapse or recur,
without separating out those that have had multiple previous episodes
from those that have had their ﬁrst lifetime episode. It is therefore
likely that they under-sampled those who only have a single lifetime
episode (Monroe & Harkness, 2011).

Finally, despite relatively longstanding data on cognitive and in-
formation processing biases and their association with relapse and re-
currence, there are signiﬁcant diﬃculties in translating knowledge of
these risk factors to the consulting room. Assessing for these biases in
brief and non-invasive ways requires technologies not available to the
majority of clinicians. Studies attempting to address this particular issue
by using wearable technology are being set up (e.g. Remote Assessment
of Disease and Relapse – Central Nervous System: “Innovative
Medicines Initiative”, n. d.), though it is too early to determine whether
or not they are indeed helpful to this end.

8. Conclusion

Taken together these four reviews suggest that: 1) childhood mal-
treatment, residual symptoms, history of recurrence, a history or cur-
rent comorbid anxiety disorders, and rumination are prognostic in-
dicators of recurrence; 2) these may also all be prescriptive risk factors
too but the evidence for each is limited; 3) higher neuroticism and
earlier age of onset appear to be prognostic risk factors but were less
well supported by the literature; 4) longer duration and greater severity
of depression may be prognostic risk factors but there was a lack of
agreement in the reviewed literature; 5) there are a number of factors
that have not previously been systematically reviewed that may be

targeted in psychological interventions (information processing and
cognitive biases, reactions to stress or changes in mood, attentional or
cognitive control) or pharmacological interventions (comorbid anxiety
symptoms, and REM sleep dysregulation) aimed at prevention. The four
reviews have identiﬁed several potential mechanisms for the action of
such risk factors and have proposed potential inter-relationships be-
tween these factors to form a conceptual framework that may help
guide clinicians and future research into relapse and recurrence of de-
pression.
