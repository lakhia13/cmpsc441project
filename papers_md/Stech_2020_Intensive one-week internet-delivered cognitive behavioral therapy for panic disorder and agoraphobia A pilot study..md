This is the first pilot study to explore the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of intensive cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia delivered via the internet. Ten participants who
met DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (6 males; mean age = 43.40, SD = 15.25) completed
The Intensive Panic Program: a six-lesson exposure-based CBT program, delivered online over seven days.
Clinician support was provided via phone and email. All 10 participants completed the program (100% ad-
herence) and high levels of satisfaction were reported. We found large and significant reductions in panic
symptom severity at post-treatment (d = 1.40), which were maintained at two-month follow-up. We also found
large reductions in agoraphobic avoidance (d = 0.92) and functional impairment (d = 1.04) at follow-up, and
days out of role were halved. On average, 132 min (SD = 42, range: 47–183) of clinician time was spent per
participant during the treatment week. The results provide promising preliminary evidence for the feasibility
and acceptability of internet-delivered intensive CBT for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia. A larger, rando-
mized control trial is now needed to evaluate the efficacy of this program compared to a control group and to
explore long-term outcomes.

1. Introduction

Approximately 3.5% of the population will meet criteria for panic
disorder during their lifetime, and 2.5% will meet criteria for agor-
aphobia (Kessler et al., 2012; McEvoy et al., 2011). Panic disorder is
associated with substantial impairment in functioning, lower quality of
life and increased health service utilization (Barrera and Norton, 2009;
Bystritsky et al., 2010); and the presence of agoraphobic avoidance is
accompanied by increased disability (Barrera and Norton, 2009;
Bystritsky et al., 2010).

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most empirically sup-
ported psychological intervention for panic disorder with or without
agoraphobia (Pompoli et al., 2016), and the first-line treatment re-
commended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE, 2019). Intensive delivery of CBT may be appropriate for some
people with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia (NICE, 2019).
‘Intensive’ or ‘massed’ CBT is characterized by prolonged therapy

sessions over a very short period of time, such as several consecutive
days. Patients receive a similar total number of hours of therapy to
standard CBT, but in a shorter time frame. Exposure techniques are
often emphasized during intensive CBT, since exposure is a potent
therapeutic component (Pompoli et al., 2018; Sánchez-Meca et al.,
2010) and is amenable to massed implementation as it can easily be
practiced several times in one session or day. Intensive CBT can facil-
itate faster reduction in symptoms and return to usual activities, which
is important at an individual and societal level (Jónsson et al., 2015;
Knuts et al., 2015). The intensive format may also capitalize on patient
motivation and therapeutic momentum, reduce drop out, or be pre-
ferred by some patients who are balancing work, study or childcare
responsibilities (Jónsson et al., 2015).

A growing body of research suggests that it is feasible to deliver CBT
for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia in an intensive time frame
(2–10 days), and that substantial reductions in symptoms can be
achieved. In the earliest study, Foa et al. (1980) explored the short-term

outcomes for agoraphobia when exposure sessions were delivered over
10 consecutive days versus 10 weekly sessions. In a small sample of 11
participants, both groups reported significant change, with results fa-
voring massed delivery for reduction in avoidance. In a follow-up study,
Chambless (1990) compared the longer-term effects of 10 daily ex-
posure sessions versus 10 weekly exposure sessions for agoraphobia.
Although the sample was small (N = 19), the results were promising,
with equivalent outcomes found for both conditions at post-treatment
and six-month follow-up. In more recent research using a larger sample
(N = 96), Knuts et al. (2015) explored intensive exposure therapy
delivered over five days for agoraphobia with comorbid panic disorder
and found large reductions in agoraphobia symptom severity that were
maintained at three-month follow-up. These outcomes were compar-
able to individuals who received 12 bi-weekly sessions over six weeks
(Knuts et al., 2015).

Past research has also demonstrated promising outcomes for in-
tensive CBT on panic disorder symptoms. Deacon and Abramowitz
(2006) explored the feasibility of two days of intensive CBT for panic
disorder, with or without comorbid agoraphobia. The small open pilot
study (N = 10), revealed large reductions (d = 1.73) in panic disorder
symptoms from pre-treatment to one-month follow-up (Deacon and
Abramowitz, 2006). In a larger open pilot study (N = 40), Bitran et al.
(2008) reported large reductions (partial η2 = 0.90) in panic symptom
severity following an eight day intensive CBT program. These effects
were sustained at follow-up one to six months later.

Despite these encouraging findings for intensive CBT, the clinician
time required for a single patient in one week may not be feasible in
most clinical settings. The aforementioned studies involved nine to 23 h
of clinician contact per participant. To increase efficiency and cost-ef-
fectiveness of intensive CBT for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia,
several studies have explored group delivery with favorable results
(Austin et al., 2008; Bohni et al., 2009; Evans et al., 1991; Lamplugh
et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2015). However, these studies still involved a
substantial amount of therapist contact (12–26 h) during treatment,
and often required multiple therapists to be present, which can be
impractical and prohibitively expensive.

Several additional factors limit access to intensive CBT, delivered in
individual or group settings. Intensive CBT is typically offered in select
specialist services located in urban centers (e.g., university clinics or
outpatient clinics at large hospitals; e.g., Bitran et al., 2008; Deacon and
Abramowitz, 2006). Patients often travel interstate to access intensive
therapy (Bitran et al., 2008), incurring travel and accommodation costs
in addition to paying for therapy and the lost income associated with
time away from work or other responsibilities. Rural and remote re-
sidents are likely to be most disadvantaged by these factors. Ad-
ditionally, traveling long distances and staying in unfamiliar accom-
modation may be unrealistic for patients with moderate to severe
agoraphobia. Novel delivery methods are needed to overcome these
barriers to intensive CBT.

Although CBT has traditionally been delivered via face-to-face
therapy sessions, there is now a large body of research supporting the
efficacy and effectiveness of internet-delivered CBT for panic disorder
with and without agoraphobia (Andrews et al., 2018; Olthuis et al.,
2015; Stech et al., 2019). Internet-delivered CBT is structured as an
online course, typically involving 6–11 modules delivered over a two to
four month period (Stech et al., 2019). It covers the key techniques
included in face-to-face CBT, such as psychoeducation, cognitive re-
structuring, interoceptive exposure and in-situ exposure.

To the authors' knowledge, there have been no past studies evalu-
ating internet-delivered CBT for any anxiety disorder in an intensive
format. To our knowledge, the shortest duration of any internet-deliv-
ered CBT protocol for an anxiety disorder is four weeks (Schröder et al.,
2017). For example, Andersson et al. (2009, 2013) developed an in-
ternet-delivered CBT program for spider phobia and another for snake
phobia, with weekly modules that focused exclusively on exposure,
without any arousal reduction strategies or cognitive restructuring.

Across two randomized controlled trials (N = 30 per trial), the pro-
grams were each compared to Öst's One Session Treatment (Andersson
et al., 2009, 2013). The internet-delivered CBT programs demonstrated
similar outcomes to One Session Treatment on almost all measures,
with large and significant reductions in phobic avoidance and fear at
post-treatment and one year follow-up (Andersson et al., 2009, 2013).
These studies provide preliminary evidence to suggest that exposure-
based CBT can be successfully delivered via the internet in one month,
but it is unclear if exposure-based internet CBT can be delivered in a
shorter timeframe.

Delivering intensive CBT remotely - via an online course supported
by clinician phone calls – may increase access to intensive CBT, by
reaching people across the country and eliminating costs associated
with travel. Delivering the key concepts via online modules could limit
clinician contact to answering questions and refining implementation of
techniques. Past research on CBT for panic disorder has demonstrated
that therapist time can be reduced by half without negatively impacting
outcomes if patients are assigned self-guided therapeutic materials be-
tween contacts (Botella and García-Palacios, 1999). Such task sharing
may be an alternative method of increasing efficiency and cost-effec-
tiveness of intensive CBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia. There-
fore, we developed a novel internet-delivered intensive CBT program
for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, designed to be delivered over
seven days. We focused on exposure-based strategies within the pro-
gram, in line with past research of face-to-face intensive CBT for panic
disorder and/or agoraphobia and due to evidence that exposure-based
CBT can be delivered via in the internet with good outcomes
(Andersson et al., 2009, 2013).

The primary aim of the current study was to explore the feasibility
and acceptability of our internet-delivered intensive CBT program for
panic disorder and/or agoraphobia. As a secondary aim, we sought to
evaluate the degree of symptom reduction and functional improvement
participants experienced at one-week post-treatment and two-month
follow-up. We hypothesized that the program would be feasible and
acceptable to participants; measured by completion rate, time spent by
participants on the program, treatment satisfaction and qualitative re-
ports of side effects. We also sought to examine feasibility in terms of
clinician time spent supporting participants through the treatment
week. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that moderate to
large reductions in panic/agoraphobic symptom severity and im-
provement in functional impairment would be observed from pre-
treatment to post-treatment and maintained at two-month follow-up.

2. Method

2.1. Design

We used an open pilot trial design. The trial was prospectively re-
gistered via the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12618001501235) and was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Australia (HREC/
18/SVH/170).

2.2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria

To be eligible for the study, participants needed to: a) be at least
18 years of age; b) live in Australia; c) meet DSM-5 criteria for panic
disorder or agoraphobia; d) be fluent in English; e) have access to a
phone and a computer with internet; and f) be under the care of a
General Practitioner (GP). Being under the care of a GP was initially
defined as having attended an appointment with the GP within three
months prior to application; however, to reduce barriers to participa-
tion, this criterion was later amended to simply providing the GP's
contact details.

Applicants were excluded due to: a) self-reported diagnosis of bi-
polar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia; b) current self-reported

2

Internet Interventions 20 (2020) 100315

substance dependence; c) current use of benzodiazepines on a daily
basis; d) severe depressive symptoms, indicated by a score > 23 on the
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); e) current suicidality (active
ideation indicating current suicidal intent or suicide plan); f) change in
psychotropic medication in the 8 weeks prior to application; g) current
participation in CBT; or h) subclinical panic symptoms, indicated by a
score of < 5 on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale – Self Report (PDSS-
SR).

2.3. Procedure

Participants were recruited across Australia between November
2018 to May 2019 via advertisements on social media and online
support networks, media coverage of the study, and flyers in local
health services. Individuals provided informed consent and applied for
the study via the Virtual Clinic website (www.virtualclinic.org.au). The
online screening assessment included demographic details, symptom
and treatment history, the PHQ-9, and the PDSS-SR. Potentially eligible
applicants were contacted for a phone interview, which included a di-
agnostic interview, risk assessment, and discussion about what to ex-
pect during the program. Excluded participants were directed to al-
ternative services.

Due to the overlap between panic symptoms and several medical
conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, anemia, heart arrhythmia), some pre-
cautionary measures were taken to ensure participants' safety. Once
participants were accepted into the trial, we notified their GP of their
participation by letter. Participants who had not had a medical review
of their panic symptoms were encouraged to visit their GP prior to
commencing the intervention.

Participants were assessed at pre-treatment (prior to Lesson 1), post-
treatment (one-week after the final lesson), and two months follow-up
(8 weeks after the final lesson).

2.4. Measures

2.4.1. Diagnostic interview
2.4.1.1. The anxiety disorders interview schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5;
Brown and Barlow, 2014). To assess for the highest prevalence mood
and anxiety related disorders, the following modules of the ADIS-5 were
administered in abbreviated form: panic disorder, agoraphobia, social
anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive
disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder and major
depressive disorder. The assessments were conducted by a Masters-
level Provisional Psychologist (ES) trained in the administration of the
ADIS-5. Any diagnostic uncertainties were clarified through discussion
with the supervising Clinical Psychologist (JN). Previous research by
our group on the interrater reliability of these ADIS-5 modules found
kappa estimates of 0.93 for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and
generalized anxiety disorder, 0.80 for major depressive disorder, and
0.60 for obsessive-compulsive disorder (Newby et al., 2017).

2.4.2. Primary clinical outcome measures
2.4.2.1. Panic disorder severity scale – self-report form (PDSS-SR). The
PDSS-SR measures panic disorder symptom severity over the past week
(Houck et al., 2002). It has good test-retest reliability (ICC over
2 days = 0.83), is sensitive to change following CBT, and correlates
strongly with the interviewer-administered PDSS (Houck et al., 2002).
A score of eight or more is indicative of clinical levels of symptoms
(Shear et al., 2001). The scale had excellent internal reliability in the
current sample (Cronbach's ∝ = 0.88 at pre-treatment).

2.4.2.2. Mobility inventory – avoidance when alone subscale (MI-
AAL). The Mobility Inventory assesses
severity of agoraphobic
avoidance (Chambless et al., 1985). To reduce the burden on
participants, we administered the Avoidance when Alone subscale
only, which has stronger psychometric properties than the Avoidance

when Accompanied subscale (Chambless et al., 2011). The MI-AAL
subscale has shown excellent test-retest reliability (e.g., r = 0.90 over
eight days), excellent internal reliability (Cronbach's ∝ ≥ 0.94), and is
sensitive to change following CBT (Chambless et al., 1985, 2011). The
suggested clinical threshold for the MI-AAL is 1.61 (Chambless et al.,
2011).

2.4.3. Secondary clinical outcome measures
2.4.3.1. Patient health questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 measures
depression symptom severity in the preceding two weeks, with an
established clinical threshold of ≥10 (Kroenke et al., 2001) . The scale
had good internal reliability in the current sample (Cronbach's ∝ =
0.88 at pre-treatment). Additionally, item 9 of the Beck Depression
Inventory – Second Edition (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) was administered to
monitor suicidal thoughts and intent throughout the trial.

2.4.3.2. Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). The WSAS (Mundt
et al., 2002) measures functional impairment across five domains. It has
good test-retest reliability (r = 0.73 over two weeks) and is sensitive to
change following treatment (Mataix-Cols et al., 2005; Mundt et al.,
2002). The WSAS had excellent internal reliability in the current
sample (Cronbach's ∝ = 0.91 at pre-treatment).

2.4.3.3. Days out of role (DOR). Based on two questions from the World
Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (Buist-Bouwman
et al., 2008; Slade et al., 2009), participants were asked how many days
in the past four weeks they were completely unable to work or carry out
their normal activities (full days out of role) and how many days they
had to cut down their usual activities (partial days out of role), due to
panic and/or anxiety. As in previous research, partial and full days out
of role were summed prior to analysis (Slade et al., 2009).

2.4.4. Feasibility and acceptability measures
2.4.4.1. Credibility and expectancy. The perceived credibility and
expected benefit of the program was assessed using the first two
questions of the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (Devilly and
Borkovec, 2000).

2.4.4.2. Adherence and engagement. Adherence was measured as the
number of lessons completed within the treatment week. Before each
lesson, participants were also asked how many minutes they spent
reading the materials from the previous lesson and completing the
assigned activities.

2.4.4.3. Lesson by lesson feedback. Before each lesson, participants were
asked to write brief details of any difficulties or adverse events they
experienced due to the program, and for feedback about the previous
lesson.

2.4.4.4. Treatment satisfaction questionnaire. Based on previous studies
(e.g., Newby et al., 2016), participants were asked to rate overall
satisfaction with the program (1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied),
satisfaction with the tempo (Much too little time/A bit too little time/
Exactly the right amount of time/A bit too much time), how logical the
program was (1 = not very to 10 = very), their confidence that the
program was successful in teaching them skills to manage panic and
anxiety (1 = not very to 10 = very), and their confidence in
recommending the program to a friend with similar symptoms
(1 = not very to 10 = very). They were also asked an open-ended
question for brief details of any wanted or unwanted effects (i.e., side
effects) they experienced due to the program.

2.5. Intervention

The Intensive Panic Program consisted of six online lessons delivered
over seven days. The program was adapted from the Panic Program

3

Internet Interventions 20 (2020) 100315

developed at the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression,
researched in previous efficacy and effectiveness studies (Allen et al.,
2016; Wims et al., 2008, 2010), and disseminated via the THIS WAY UP
online platform (www.thiswayup.org.au).1 The concepts for each lesson
were introduced via an illustrated comic, followed by a Lesson Sum-
mary with more detailed information, worksheets, and an action plan
for the rest of the day. The program included extra resources such as
frequently asked questions and lists of exposure ideas; as well as four
video demonstrations, which were a novel element of The Intensive
Panic Program. The videos modelled therapist-guided interoceptive and
in-situ exposure, similar to the exposure modelling videos included in
the studies by Andersson et al. (2009, 2013). These extra resources
were included to ensure participants had immediate access to clarifying
information if needed, so their progression was not delayed.

The program focused on exposure-based techniques for overcoming
panic disorder, and did not include controlled breathing, cognitive re-
structuring or coping statements that were in previous versions of the
program. Instead, the four lessons between psychoeducation (Lesson 1)
and relapse prevention (Lesson 6) focused on exposure: interoceptive
exercises in Lesson 2, in-situ exposure in Lesson 3, troubleshooting
obstacles to exposure in Lesson 4, and advanced exposure (combining
interoceptive and in-situ tasks, and exposure for social concerns) in
Lesson 5. Although it was explained that habituation was likely to
occur, an inhibitory learning rationale was emphasized. Participants
were encouraged to wait for strong body sensations to pass in time,
without relying on arousal reduction strategies. See Table 1 for more
detail about the content of the program.

We took several steps to prepare participants for the intervention.
During the phone interview, we advised participants that the program
involved reading material and implementing practical tasks, and would
take a total of three to four hours per day. We also informed partici-
pants that the program would require exposing themselves to feared
sensations and situations, in a structured and supported manner. We
advised participants that the program would be tiring and therefore
encouraged them to take leave from work or other responsibilities
during the treatment week. Participants were also encouraged to plan
ahead for the demands of the treatment week by limiting their other
commitments, asking loved ones for support and identifying restorative
activities to engage in. Participants who were agreeable to these con-
ditions were then asked to elect a preferred week to complete the
program. For example, one participant waited until they were on a
break from university, while another scheduled the treatment for when
their in-laws could stay with them to assist with childcare. If there was a
delay between the phone interview and chosen week, we contacted
participants on the Thursday or Friday prior to commencement, to
confirm they remained willing and able to start the program.

2.6. Clinician support

Clinical support was provided by ES, a Masters-level Provisional
Psychologist, and JN, supervising Clinical Psychologist. Typically, three
check-in phone calls were scheduled for the treatment week, and shared
between ES and JN based on availability. The first call was scheduled
for Monday (Day 1 of treatment) to refine participants' goals and ensure
a thorough understanding of the cognitive-behavioral formulation. The
second call was scheduled for Tuesday (Day 2) to review the inter-
oceptive assessment and troubleshoot any barriers to commencing in-
teroceptive exposure. The third call was scheduled for Thursday (Day 4)
to review progress with in-situ exposure and plan tasks for the re-
mainder of the week. Participants were advised that additional clinical
support was available ad-hoc during business hours (Monday to Friday,

1 See the Supplementary material for a table that summarizes how the current
intervention differed from past studies by our group on internet CBT for panic
disorder delivered over eight weeks.

9 am to 5 pm) throughout the treatment week. The clinicians also
monitored participants Virtual Clinic profiles each day from Monday to
Friday, to ensure participants followed the set schedule of one new
lesson each day. No clinician support was available on Saturday and
Sunday of the treatment week, however we scheduled generic SMS
prompts for those mornings to encourage participants to continue with
the program. We emailed participants on the following Monday (Day 8)
and offered a phone call to debrief any tasks completed over the
weekend. We advised participants that they could request booster calls
during the two-month follow-up period.

Additionally, participants received automated emails from the
Virtual Clinic platform (e.g., to prompt them to start the program or
complete questionnaires, and to congratulate them on completing each
lesson).

2.7. Data analysis

All analyses were conducted in Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS version 25 (IBM SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
One-way repeated measures ANOVAs with planned contrasts were used
to investigate change in symptom measures from pre-treatment to post-
treatment and follow-up. Paired samples t-tests were used to investigate
reductions in functional impairment measures, which were only ad-
ministered at pre-treatment and follow-up. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were
calculated to determine the magnitude of change for each measure, by
dividing the difference between means by the standard deviation of the
difference. Reliable change on the PDSS-SR from pre- to post-treatment
and pre-treatment to follow-up was calculated following the procedures
outlined by Jacobson and Truax (1991). We used test-retest reliability
estimates of 0.81 from Houck et al. (2002) and SD of 6.54 derived from
the current sample at pre-treatment. ‘Recovered’ status was defined as
exhibiting reliable improvement and being within the normative range
(< 8) on the PDSS-SR.

3. Results

3.1. Participant characteristics

Fig. 1 summarizes participant flow through the study. A total of 67
individuals started an online application for the study. Out of these 67
individuals, 20 did not complete their online application, and a further
19 were not eligible to proceed to the telephone interview. The most
common reasons for ineligibility were that they were taking benzo-
diazepines on a daily basis or were currently receiving CBT. During the
telephone interview, seven participants chose to transfer to a study of
spaced internet-delivered CBT for panic disorder; three stated they
would prefer spaced intervention due to other time commitments, one
felt spaced CBT would allow more time for consolidation of gains, and
three decided they would prefer a more gradual approach after learning
about what the program involved.

The final sample included 10 adults (four females), aged between 21
and 68 years (M = 43.40, SD = 15.25). Four participants met criteria
for panic disorder, one met criteria for agoraphobia, and five met cri-
teria for panic disorder with comorbid agoraphobia. Five participants
met criteria for an additional disorder (generalized anxiety dis-
order = 3, major depressive disorder = 1, social anxiety disorder = 1).
The mean score on the PDSS-SR at application was 15.40 (SD = 4.43),
which is in the severe range (Furukawa et al., 2009). Duration of
symptoms ranged from less than six months to > 10 years, with eight
participants reporting symptom duration longer than two years. No
participants were regularly taking psychoactive medication. One par-
ticipant was using benzodiazepine medication as needed and receiving
monthly supportive counselling. Five participants reported previous use
of medication for anxiety and/or depression, and seven reported pre-
vious participation in psychotherapy (five had previous experience with
CBT).

Internet Interventions 20 (2020) 100315

Fig. 1. Participant flow diagram. *Four participants were excluded at the online screening stage for multiple reasons.

All participants were born in Australia and spoke English at home.
They lived in four states of Australia; six in urban/central areas and four
in regional areas. The majority of participants were married or in a
relationship (n = 8), one participant was single/never married, and one
was separated. The sample was well educated. Four participants were
university students with additional responsibilities (e.g., stay-at-home
parent, part-time paid work), three were employed full-time, two were
employed part-time, and one was retired. All participants took full or
partial leave from their work/education to complete the program.

3.2. Credibility and expectancy

Immediately prior to Lesson 1, the mean rating for how logical the
course seemed was 7.10 (SD = 1.37, range = 5–9), on a scale from
1 = not at all to 9 = very. The mean rating for how successful parti-
cipants anticipated the program would be in reducing their symptoms
of panic and anxiety was 6.50 (SD = 1.08, range = 5–8), using the
same scale.

Internet Interventions 20 (2020) 100315

Fig. 2. Number of minutes of clinician contact per participant in each stage of the intervention.

3.3. Adherence

3.6. Clinical outcome measures

All 10 participants completed the six lessons (100% completion
rate). One participant (P8) encountered significant technical issues that
prohibited them accessing lessons later in the treatment week, causing
their completion to be delayed by one day.

3.4. Engagement with program

Across the treatment week, participants reported spending an
average of 69 to 104 min reading the lesson materials each day, and
between 48 and 142 min each day practicing the skills taught. As the
week progressed, average time spent reading the materials decreased
and average time spent practicing the skills increased, which matched
the intended shift in emphasis of the program throughout the week
from learning about the theoretical model, to focusing on exposure
practice. However, there was substantial variance between participants,
with time spent reading the lesson materials ranging from 20 to
180 min per lesson and time spent practicing the skills ranging from 0
to 300 min (or 15–300 min, excluding P8) per lesson.

3.5. Clinician contact

Following acceptance into the trial, an average of 17 min (SD = 8)
of clinician time was spent per participant prior to the treatment week
(e.g. sending the GP letter and brief contact to confirm if the participant
planned to proceed). On average, the clinicians spent a total of 132 min
(SD = 42) talking on the phone with participants, reading and re-
sponding to emails and scheduling text messages during the program
(including check-in on Day 8). Clinician contact during the treatment
week primarily focused on answering questions, checking progress,
planning and reviewing exposure hierarchies, and encouraging parti-
cipants. On average, an additional 32 min (SD = 25) of clinician con-
tact occurred per participant during the post-treatment and follow-up
periods. This contact included prompting participants via text and
email to complete questionnaires, providing feedback on questionnaire
scores via email and responding to any subsequent email replies from
participants. Only one participant (P2) requested a booster call during
the two-month follow-up period. Fig. 2 summarizes the clinician time
per participant at each time point.

Table 2 summarizes the outcome measure results and statistics. On
the primary outcome measures, there was a significant and large re-
duction in panic symptom severity (PDSS-SR) from pre- to post-treat-
ment (d = 1.40), and pre-treatment to follow-up (d = 1.67). We also
found a significant overall reduction in agoraphobic avoidance (MI-
AAL), of large magnitude (d = 0.83 from pre- to post-treatment).2
Reductions in panic disorder and agoraphobia symptom severity were
maintained from post-treatment to follow-up. For the secondary out-
come measures, we found a moderate reduction in depression symptom
severity (PHQ-9), which did not reach statistical significance (at post-
treatment, d = 0.53, 95%CI: −0.19, 1.24). Nine of 10 participants
reported nil suicidal ideation throughout the study. One participant
reported suicidal ideation (without intent) at pre-treatment (BDI-II item
9 = 1), which reduced to 0 at post-treatment and two-month follow-up.
From pre-treatment to follow-up, a moderate and significant reduction
in functional impairment (WSAS) was observed (d = 1.04), and number
of days out of role was more than halved (d = 1.05): from 13.2 to 4.8
full or partial days out of role, on average.

Fig. 3 shows the change in panic symptom scores for each in-
dividual. Overall, six participants improved from pre- to post-treatment
and remained improved at follow up (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P10), with five
showing reliable change. An additional two participants displayed re-
liable improvement from pre- to post-treatment, but their symptoms
increased slightly from post-treatment to follow-up (P2, P6). Two par-
ticipants met recovered status at post-treatment (P1 and P2) and three
participants met recovered status at two-month follow-up (P4, P5, P7).
P8 was an outlier: their panic symptoms appeared to resolve between
application and pre-treatment, going from the severe to normal range.
However, P8's PHQ-9 scores remained in the severe range throughout.
P9's scores on the PDSS-SR dropped from the moderate to normal range
from application to pre-treatment; however, their comments to the
clinicians during the treatment week indicated ongoing fear and
avoidance of panic at a clinical level.

3.7. Treatment satisfaction

Three participants reported they were very satisfied with the

2 P8 answered 0 (does not apply) to all items on the MI-AAL at each time point,
making their overall scores invalid. Therefore, we excluded P8 from all analysis
of the MI-AAL.

program, six participants reported they were mostly satisfied, and one
(P8) selected the neutral response option. Eight participants reported
the scope of the program was exactly right in relation to the time allo-
cated, and two participants (P2, P10) indicated there was a bit too little
time. Overall, participants rated the program as logical (M = 8.6,
SD = 1.43), reported high levels of confidence that it successfully
taught techniques to manage panic and anxiety (M = 7.8, SD = 1.14)
and confidence in recommending the program to a friend with similar
symptoms (M = 8.5, SD = 1.35).

3.8. Lesson by lesson feedback

3.8.1. Negative side effects

Two participants reported fatigue in the latter part of the treatment
week. For example: “[I'm] feeling tired, flat (definitely not depression like).
Feel like the program requires constant focus even at subconscious level.”
(P5, Day 4); “I am finding the exercises tiring, tough and draining but feel
like I am starting to chip away at things I was afraid of through exposure.”
(P3, Day 7). Seven participants reported an increase in anxiety between
pre- to post-treatment, usually related to increased attention on panic
symptoms and graded exposure, but that this anxiety resolved fairly
quickly. For example: “…[I] had some panic symptoms which I was able to
control fairly quickly” (P7, Day 4); “I am waking up having panic at-
tacks…” (P3, Day 5); “I experienced a panic attack yesterday (morning). I
also experienced a very mild attack later in the day; it went away very
quickly.” (P9, Day 5). Additionally, one participant reported that the
abrupt ending of the treatment week prompted anxiety: “Because the
program was delivered in intensive mode, the absence of new lessons made
me mildly anxious for first couple of days.” (P5, Post). Two other parti-
cipants also commented on the timing of the program: “I would've liked
the program to go longer. While the key learnings were done in a week, I feel
like they weren't cemented in which allows for a relapse. People doing a
seven-day treatment plan have to be extremely committed to continuing it
after the week” (P2, Post); “I think the one-week program could potentially
be stretched out into two weeks for optimal timing…” (P10, Post).

3.8.2. Positive side effects

Many participants reported that overall the program was empow-
ering, and the most helpful strategy was learning to ‘ride the wave’ of
anxiety. For example: “My anxiety and panic has reduced to almost zero.
Even when faced with triggers, I am still able to ride the wave. I have done a
huge number of things without panic that I haven't done with panic or fear of
panic for years.” (P2, Post); “[I've experienced] better coping with situations
that provoke panic attack by riding the ‘panic wave’” (P5, Post); “[I'm]
feeling more confident to do things I was avoiding, and more hopeful of being
able to manage/overcome panic and anxiety” (P6, Post); “I am pleased that
I haven't used diazepam for anxiety/panic since starting the program. I am
also happy that I am able to endure situations more, knowing that the
symptoms will pass.” (P9, Post).

4. Discussion

This study explored the feasibility and acceptability of an internet-
delivered intensive CBT program in a sample of 10 participants with a
DSM-5 diagnosis of panic disorder and/or agoraphobia. To our
knowledge, this was the first attempt to condense internet-delivered
CBT for any anxiety disorder into an intensive one-week format.

The first aim was to evaluate the program's acceptability and fea-
sibility. All 10 participants completed the six-lesson program in one
week. Engagement was high during the treatment week, with partici-
pants spending an average of 2.5 to 3.5 h per day reading the program
materials and practicing the skills taught. Additionally, nine of the 10
participants reported they were mostly or very satisfied with the pro-
gram. Regarding side effects, seven of 10 participants reported an in-
crease in anxiety between pre-treatment to one-week post-treatment,
which was usually related to increased attention on panic symptoms or

commencing graded exposure, although they reported that this anxiety
resolved quickly. Some participants also reported fatigue during the
treatment week. However, almost all participants reported finding the
program empowering or beneficial. Therefore, it may be helpful to
prepare individuals that they may experience a temporary increase in
anxiety during internet-delivered intensive CBT, but that overall the
program will likely be an empowering and helpful experience.

Secondly, the results showed that on average the participants ex-
perienced positive outcomes during their internet-delivered intensive
CBT program for panic disorder/agoraphobia. We found a large and
significant overall reduction in panic symptom severity between pre-
and post-treatment (d = 1.40), which was maintained at two-month
follow-up. We also found large and significant reductions in agor-
aphobic avoidance (d = 0.92) and functional impairment (d = 1.04)
from pre-treatment to follow-up. Importantly, days out of role were
more than halved, which may indicate a considerable increase in par-
ticipants' productivity. We did not find a significant change in depres-
sion; however, the mean PHQ-9 score at pre-treatment was in the mild
range and below clinical threshold, suggesting there was less room for
improvement.

The clinical outcomes of the current study were consistent with
previous research on intensive face-to-face CBT for panic disorder and/
or agoraphobia delivered over five to eight days (Bitran et al., 2008;
Knuts et al., 2015; Lamplugh et al., 2008). However, in the current
study, each participant had an average of 2.2 h of clinician contact
during the treatment week, which is substantially lower than previous
studies of face-to-face intensive CBT delivered individually (23 h in
Knuts et al., 2015; approximately 20 h in Bitran et al., 2008) or in a
group format (20 h in Lamplugh et al., 2008, with 5 participants per
group). The current results suggest that participants undergoing in-
ternet-delivered intensive exposure-based CBT can experience sub-
stantial and rapid improvements in panic and agoraphobia symptoms,
with relatively little clinician time required compared with face-to-face
alternatives, although they await replication.

Typically, participants received three clinician support calls during
the treatment week: on Day 1 (Monday), Day 2 (Tuesday) and Day 4
(Thursday). This schedule was chosen for pragmatic reasons related to
the clinicians' other commitments. However, in future we would change
the third scheduled call from Day 4 (Thursday) to Day 3 (Wednesday).
Participants often did not commence in-situ exposure on Day 3 because
they were waiting until opportunities for exposure arose naturally and
needed to be coached in creating opportunities for in-situ exposure. For
example, visiting a shopping mall multiple times in one day, for the
purpose of exposing oneself to an enclosed and busy environment.
Additionally, although three participants commented that tapered
clinician contact would be helpful, only one participant asked for a
phone call during the follow-up period. Including scheduled calls as part
of the standard protocol may increase uptake of booster calls, and help
participants feel more confident about maintaining their gains.

The delivery format of this intervention - an automated online
course supported by clinician phone calls - may facilitate dissemination
of intensive CBT and integration into usual care settings. From our lo-
cation in Sydney, we were able to reach people across Australia, in-
cluding in rural areas. Participants stayed in their own homes during
the treatment week, thereby eliminating travel and accommodation
costs or the need to arrange overnight childcare. By task sharing with
an automated online course, the clinicians were able to supervise up to
three people per week through the program whilst maintaining a busy
workload of other clinical and research responsibilities. Additionally,
the primary clinician (ES) was only available three days per week for
most of the study, so clinical support for most participants was shared
with another clinician (JN). This arrangement appeared acceptable to
participants and was easy to coordinate between the clinicians.
Delivering intensive CBT via the internet offered increased flexibility
for both participants and clinicians.

Importantly, condensing internet-delivered CBT for panic disorder

into an intensive one-week timeframe did not require new technology.
The format of the lessons was the same as in our previous studies and
we used our existing web platform to deliver the online lessons to
participants. The major modifications relative to our group's past stu-
dies of internet-delivered CBT for panic disorder were: focusing on
exposure therapy techniques, which are amenable to massed im-
plementation; preparing participants during the assessment interview
for what was involved in the treatment week; encouraging participants
to complete 3–4 h of therapy activities per day rather than per week; and
arranging scheduled and more frequent support calls during the pro-
gram (see Supplementary Material for full summary of adaptations re-
lative to our past studies). Therefore, it may be possible for other ex-
isting clinics that provide internet-delivered CBT to explore intensive
delivery of their programs.

This study takes a step towards increasing treatment options for
patients pursuing internet-delivered CBT for panic disorder. The 10
participants who completed the program were motivated to complete
intensive internet-delivered CBT for various reasons. For example, they
wanted to achieve faster reductions in symptoms and impairment, or
they felt it would be easier to stay motivated and prioritise the program
over the short timeframe, compared to a two month period in con-
ventional internet-delivered CBT. As mentioned earlier, one participant
completed the program during a break in university classes, when they
had less demands on their time for a brief period. However, a con-
ventional timeframe for internet-delivered CBT was preferred by seven
people who applied to this study. They chose to take part in a separate
study of a spaced internet-delivered CBT program, because work or
other commitments prevented them from taking part in the intensive
study, or because they indicated preference for a more gradual treat-
ment approach. Future research should explore user preferences for
internet-delivered CBT in greater depth so that treatments can be tai-
lored to match personal preferences.

4.1. Limitations

The findings from this study need to be interpreted in light of sev-
eral limitations. The most significant limitation is the lack of control
group, which precludes the conclusion that outcomes were solely due to
the intervention rather than the passage of time, regression to the mean,
or non-specific therapeutic factors (e.g., therapeutic alliance). Future
studies should employ a waitlist control or psychological control (e.g.,
relaxation) to delineate the specific effects of the program. Secondly,
the study relied exclusively on self-report measures and would have
benefitted from blind clinician diagnostic assessments at follow-up.
Thirdly, only 10 individuals took part in the program, out of 67 who
started an application. The relatively small proportion of people in-
cluded in the final sample may limit the generalizability of the findings.
Of the 67 individuals, 30% did not progress because they did not
complete their application, and it is not clear why those participants did
not proceed with their application. Additionally, 14 participants were
excluded as they were receiving concurrent treatment (current CBT,
recent change in medication, or daily use of benzodiazepines). It re-
mains unclear how these treatment factors would impact internet-de-
livered intensive CBT for panic disorder, and future studies could ex-
amine whether providing the intensive program as an adjunct to
existing treatment facilitates faster recovery. The final sample was
small, well-educated and self-motivated to apply for an internet-deliv-
ered intensive CBT program, and five had prior experience with CBT.
Although these factors limit the generalizability of the findings, the
eligibility criteria were deliberately inclusive to approximate usual care
settings, where individuals are often non-responders to prior treatment,
use benzodiazepines as-needed, and have comorbid anxiety and de-
pressive disorders. Individuals were not excluded from our study due to
these reasons. Finally, the follow-up period was only two months.
Future studies should explore the longer-term effects of internet-deliv-
ered intensive CBT, and compare outcomes to standard internet-

10

delivered CBT protocols delivered over a longer time-frame (e.g.,
8–10 weeks).

4.2. Conclusions

This pilot study demonstrates that internet-delivered intensive CBT
for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia is feasible, acceptable to parti-
cipants, and associated with large improvements in symptom severity
and functional impairment. The intervention was time efficient, with
both rapid gains reported by participants and substantially less clinician
time required than previous intensive CBT interventions. Delivering
intensive CBT via the internet enabled us to reach people across the
country and eliminated travel for participants. Further research is
needed to evaluate The Intensive Panic Program in a larger sample with a
longer follow-up period to explore the generalizability and durability of
the findings. Comparison to a control condition and conventional
‘spaced’ internet-delivered CBT over several months is also needed, to
establish the relative efficacy of the program and understand which
groups of patients are most suitable for intensive treatment. This in-
novative internet-delivered format has great potential to increase access
to intensive CBT and thereby expand the treatment options available to
patients.
