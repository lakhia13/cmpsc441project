Compassion apps for better mental health:
qualitative review

Eva de Krijger, Ernst T. Bohlmeijer, Elbert Geuze and Saskia M. Kelders

Background

There is increasing empirical evidence for the positive mental
health effects of compassion-based interventions. Although
numerous smartphone apps offering compassion-based inter-
ventions (‘compassion apps’) are now available for the general
public, the quality of these apps has not yet been reviewed.
A qualitative review of existing compassion apps serves as a
crucial first step toward testing the efficacy of these apps, by
identifying good-quality compassion apps that might be worth
the investment of a scientific trial.

Aims

based interventions, and acceptable to good overall quality. The
other 16 apps failed to meet one or both of these criteria.

Conclusions

Good-quality compassion apps are available, but many of the
available apps fail to meet certain quality criteria. In particular,
many apps failed to offer sufficient relevant and correct infor-
mation, or failed to offer this information in an entertaining and
interesting way. It is recommended that future compassion apps
are based on a clear definition of compassion, offer evidence-
and theory-based exercises and implement tools for increasing
engagement.

The current study focuses on reviewing the quality of existing
compassion apps.

Keywords

Method

Existing compassion apps were identified through searches in
the Google Play Store and App Store. The 24 included apps were
reviewed on their quality by using the Mobile App Rating Scale,
and on their consistency with current evidence by comparing
them to existing and studied compassion-based interventions.

Results

Of the 24 included apps, eight were identified that met the cri-
teria of being consistent with existing and studied compassion-

Common mental disorders, such as mood, anxiety and substance
use disorders, are estimated to affect one in five people each year,1
and mental disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide.2
In addition, it has been suggested that there is an even larger
group of people without a mental disorder but who experience a
low level of mental well-being.3 This reduced mental well-being is
related to similar problems in functioning as when common
mental disorders are present.3 To improve mental health, there is
a need for interventions that help to improve mental health as a
complete state, ensuring the absence of mental disorders and the
presence of a high level of mental well-being.4

Mental health and compassion

With regard to improving mental health, a concept that has been
receiving increasing attention is compassion.5–10 Compassion can
be defined as adaptive responding to physical, mental or emotional
pain or unease.9,11 This includes pain or unease experienced by
other people as well as one’s own pain or unease.9 Thus compassion
can be directed at other people in an effort to relieve their pain or
unease, but it can also be a way of responding to oneself, and
one’s own personal pain or discomfort.9 Compassion has been
defined in multiple ways, and a review performed by Strauss et al
in 201611 aims to bring all those definitions together by defining
compassion as ‘a cognitive, affective and behavioral process consist-
ing of five elements: (1) recognizing suffering, (2) understanding the
universality of suffering in human experience, (3) feeling empathy
for the person suffering and connecting with the distress, (4) toler-
ating uncomfortable feelings aroused in response to the suffering
person, so remaining open to and accepting of the person suffering
and (5) motivation to act to alleviate suffering’.

There is increasing empirical evidence that demonstrates a sig-
nificant association between compassion and mental health.5–10 On
the one hand, compassion has been shown to be negatively related
to the occurrence of mental illness5–7 and to factors that are related
to mental illness, like self-criticism, rumination, neurotic perfec-
tionism and thought suppression.9 On the other hand, there is
also a growing body of research that shows positive relationships
between compassion and mental well-being, in terms of subjective
well-being, life satisfaction, social connectedness, emotional intelli-
gence and adaptive emotion regulation strategies.8–10

Furthermore,

it has been shown that compassion can be
enhanced by offering compassion-based interventions, and that
these interventions yield significant positive effects on mental
health.12,13 Compassion-based interventions are often offered in a
face-to-face format, with a therapist or trainer delivering the inter-
vention to an individual or a group of people. A review performed
by Kirby in 2016 describes six empirically supported interventions
that focus on the cultivation of compassion, such as compassion-
focused therapy and mindful self-compassion.14 These interven-
tions focus on improving mental health through the cultivation of
compassion, and all contain exercises that are explicitly focused
on cultivating compassion, such as compassion meditations or prac-
ticing compassionate responses to suffering in daily life. In addition
to these face-to-face formats, a more recent study offered support
for the efficacy of a guided self-help compassion intervention,15 sug-
gesting that face-to-face contact is not a prerequisite for the effect-
iveness of compassion-based interventions. From this point of view,
huge potential may also lie in the emergence of smartphone appli-
cations that offer compassion-based interventions, or ‘compassion
apps’.

Potential of compassion apps

With smartphone ownership rates fast increasing all over the
world,16 offering compassion-based interventions via smartphone
applications has the potential to reach an increasingly large group
of people. An important advantage that compassion apps may
offer is that they are available to support compassion practice
anytime, anywhere. Thereby enabling more frequent practice.
This is important because with regard to compassion-based inter-
ventions, a greater level of practice has been shown to be associated
with a greater level of compassion.17 Furthermore, like other mental
health apps, compassion apps have the potential to lower financial
costs of mental healthcare,18,19 and to reach people who want to
improve their mental health but do not use in-person mental
health services because of barriers to care, such as time, distance,
financial costs and stigma.20

With regard to the efficacy of mental health apps in general,
recent reviews show favourable results for those apps that have
been studied with either a pre–post test design or a randomised
controlled trial.21–23 However, these same reviews identify the
issue that these types of studies are rare, and that the majority
of available mental health apps therefore seem to lack scientific
evidence regarding their efficacy.21–23 The review by Donker
et al in 2013 identified only eight studies associated with five dif-
ferent apps; at the time, more than 3000 mental health apps were
available to download.21 With regard to those apps that have not
been scientifically studied, many have been shown to offer content
that is not in line with existing guidelines or evidence-based prac-
tice.24,25 Some mental health apps have even been shown to offer
advice that might be harmful, such as suggesting the use of alcohol
as a solution for stress-based problems.26 Furthermore, mental
health apps might differ in their overall quality, both in the
quality of the content and the quality of the technology used to
deliver the content. A mental health app that offers high-quality
content that is in line with evidence-based practice, but does
this with low-quality technology that negatively affects the app’s
attractiveness, ease of use or functionality, may have little effect
on level of mental health.27,28

The existence of low-quality mental health apps that either fail
to follow evidence-based practice or are of low technical quality
poses risks for the general public.29 Especially because it has been
suggested that users are not able to discern high-quality apps
from lower-quality apps.25 Users might rely on an app’s description
to assess its quality, but it has been shown that description of apps
can be misleading, with certain apps claiming to provide effective
mental health strategies but actually failing to do so.30 Users have
furthermore been shown to rely on app ratings in selecting and
adopting mental health apps,31 but it has been shown that iTunes
star ratings, for example, are only moderately related to an objective
measure of health app quality.32 Risks of using a low-quality mental
health app might consist of not gaining any improvement, which in
turn might discourage users in seeking help for their mental health
issues altogether, or worsening of mental health status because of
harmful advice.29 It is, therefore, important to gain information
on the quality of currently available mental health apps. Such infor-
mation can also serve a purpose for mental health professionals in
determining which apps to use and/or recommend as an addition
to the treatments they offer.

Recent studies have focused on reviewing the quality of mind-
fulness apps.33–35 However, to the best of our knowledge, the
quality of compassion apps has not yet been reviewed. Therefore,
the current study aims to be the first study that focuses on qualita-
tively reviewing existing compassion apps, with regard to their
overall quality and specifically the extent to which they are in line
with evidence-based practice.

Method

Search strategy

To achieve the objectives of the study, we systematically identified
apps in the Android Google Play Store and Apple App Store that
claim to focus on improving compassion and/or entail a consider-
able number of exercises (at least four) that are focused on improv-
ing compassion. Searches for apps were performed on 15 January
2022 for the Android Google Play Store and 16 January 2022 for
the Apple App Store. For the search in the Google Play Store, the
Google Play Store was entered online via a computer, and the
search in the App Store was performed on an iPad (2019 seventh
generation,
iOS 15.7) with the filter set to apps available for
iPhone. The search terms ‘compassion’, ‘compassie’ (Dutch for com-
passion) and ‘mededogen’ (a Dutch synonym for compassion) were
used. It was a deliberated decision to use only these three search
terms, instead of adding related constructs such as ‘kindness’ or
‘empathy’, because it was the intention to specifically identify
apps that claim to focus on improving compassion. Compassion
has been argued to be similar to, but broader than, constructs
such as kindness and empathy, in the sense that it encompasses
more than just kindness or empathy.36

The resulting apps were screened by checking both titles and
descriptions on the following inclusion criteria: (a) the app is in
either English or Dutch and (b) the description states that the app
offers a framework to improve compassion, or (c) compassion is
mentioned as one of the topics that can be worked on with the
app. This was done by one researcher. Apps that met the first two
inclusion criteria were included regardless of the content they
offered. Apps that were in English or Dutch and mentioned com-
passion as a topic that could be worked on in the app, but did not
state that it offered a framework to improve compassion, were
downloaded and assessed to check their content regarding the fol-
lowing inclusion and exclusion criteria.

(a) Inclusion criterium: the app contains at least four exercises that
are presented as exercises that help to improve compassion.
(b) Exclusion criterium: the content of the app is presented as
content that helps to improve ‘compassion fatigue’ or ‘compas-
sion satisfaction’ instead of compassion.

(c) Exclusion criterium: (part of) the app is inaccessible, and this
makes it impossible to check whether the app meets the inclu-
sion criterium above.

This was done by two independent researchers, and differences in
opinion were discussed to reach consensus. In this selection
process we did not reference the content of the app to any definition
of compassion; apps were included when the app content was pre-
sented as content that helps to improve compassion, regardless of
the definition of compassion that was offered by the app.

Measures

The included apps were reviewed with regard to their quality by
using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS).32 The MARS is a 23-
item scale for classifying and rating the quality of mobile health
apps. The 23 items are subdivided into four objective quality sub-
scales
functionality, aesthetics and information
quality) and one subjective quality subscale. Items are scored on a
five-point scale (1, inadequate; 2, poor; 3, acceptable; 4, good; 5,
excellent). The MARS is scored by calculating the mean scores for
the four objective quality subscales, and the total mean score of
these four scales. For the current study, we chose not to score the
subjective quality scale. We feel that this scale is less relevant for

Criterium for consistency with
evidence base

The content of the app is consistent with
the content of existing and studied
compassion-based interventions, in
the sense that it is consistent with
the concept of compassion as being
a way of responding to suffering, by
turning the user’s attention toward it
instead of shutting it out and by
responding with kindness, care and/
or support

the current study because it concerns our subjective experience of
the apps. The MARS has demonstrated excellent internal consist-
ency (Cronbach’s α = 0.90) for the total score, and very high internal
consistencies (Cronbach’s α = 0.80–0.89, median 0.85) and fair to
excellent interrater reliabilities (intraclass correlation coefficient
0.50–0.80, median 0.65) for the subscales.32

The MARS includes an item on evidence base (‘has the app been
trialed/tested?’), which has to be verified in published scientific lit-
erature. This item is part of the information subscale of the MARS.
We scored this item based on a search in Google Scholar, with the
name of the app followed by ‘app’ as a search term (e.g. Imagine
Clarity app). Next, at least the first page of results was screened
by checking titles and first sentences of the abstracts for these
search terms. When this search led to articles that referred to the
app that was searched for, the search was continued until a full
page of results did not show any results that referred to the app.
Since it has been shown that the majority of available mental
health apps have not been scientifically tested,21–23 the included
apps were also rated with regard to the extent that they are consistent
with existing and studied compassion-based interventions. This was
done separately from the scoring of the MARS, using the coding
scheme shown in Table 1. The coding scheme was based on a
review by Kirby in 2016, in which compassion-focused therapy,
mindful self-compassion, compassion cultivation training, cognitively
based compassion training and cultivating emotional balance were
identified as existing and studied compassion-based interventions.14

Procedure

The included apps from the Google Play Store were reviewed in
Android 11 with a Samsung Galaxy A32 5G, and the apps from
the App Store were reviewed in iOS 15.4.1 with an iPhone 11.
Two independent researchers were involved in reviewing the apps
(E.d.K. and S.M.K.). As recommended by the developers of the
MARS, both researchers completed a training exercise. This training
exercise consists of rating a mental health app, after which the
researchers discuss their ratings of this app to reach a mutual under-
standing of the meaning of the items. Each app was passively tested
(i.e. installed without actively opening it) for a minimum of 2 weeks,
and actively tested for a minimum of 30 min, by at least one of the
two raters. The passive testing time of 2 weeks was taken into
account to check the amount and content of reminders/prompts.

A total of 70% of the apps were tested and reviewed on 16 items
of the MARS by both researchers. We chose to have part of the apps
scored by two researchers to be able to calculate interrater reliability,
and this also enabled us to determine certain rules of interpretation
for the MARS items based on two different perspectives. An intra-
class correlation of 0.82 indicated good interrater reliability. After
determining the intraclass correlation, the two researchers discussed
the differences in scores and, based on this discussion, determined
certain rules of interpretation for the MARS items (included in

Supplementary Appendix 1 available at https://doi.org/10.1192/
bjo.2023.537). These rules of interpretation were than used by one
researcher (E.d.K.) to determine the final scores of the apps, and
the scores of the remaining apps. As a consequence, the apps have
been scored by one researcher, but these scores are based on the per-
spectives of two researchers that have both individually studied a
large part of the apps extensively.

An exception was made for items 5, 15 and 16 of the MARS and
‘consistency with evidence base’ (Table 2). These items were scored
by a single researcher (E.d.K.) for all of the apps. This was decided
because to score these items precisely, we had one of the researchers
listen to all of the audio and video fragments included in the apps.
This researcher worked with specific rules of interpretation for these
three items of the MARS (included in Supplementary Appendix 1).

Results

Selection of apps for review

from religious or charity organisations

The search led to a total of 412 apps (Google Play Store n = 250,
Apple App Store n = 162), of which 24 apps could be included. A
total of 321 apps were excluded because the title or description
did not meet the inclusion criteria with regard to suggesting a
for example,
focus on improving compassion. These were,
apps
that used the
term compassion in their title but described aims other than
improving compassion. A total of 30 apps were excluded after
download because although compassion was mentioned in the
description as one of the topics that could be worked on with the
app, the content did not demonstrate any, or only few, exercises
that were presented as exercises that help to improve compassion.
These were, for example, apps that offered only one exercise to
improve compassion, with the rest of the app focusing on mindful-
ness or other meditation practices. Of the 24 included apps, one
appeared in the search results of both app stores and 23 appeared
in the search results of only one of the app stores (either iOS or
Android). These 23 apps were manually searched for in the other
app store, to check for availability in the other app store. See
Fig. 1 for a detailed overview of the selection process. Additional
information about the 24 included apps (developer,
link, cost,
etc.) is included in Supplementary Appendix 2.

App quality rating

The 24 included apps were reviewed on their quality with the
MARS. Table 2 demonstrates the scores on the MARS. The
quality mean score of the MARS was calculated as a mean, but in
this section, we present the median scores across all apps. The 24
reviewed compassion apps show a median quality mean score of
3.54 (s.d. = 0.58) on a scale ranging from 1 to 5. The apps demon-
strated the highest median score for functionality, with a median
score of 4.5 (s.d. = 0.47). This reflects that most apps were free of
major technical problems and easy to use. The apps demonstrated
a median score of 3.1 (s.d. = 1.05) on engagement. A score of 4 or
higher on engagement, which is described as good to excellent,
was given to only five apps (21%). In fact, 11 apps (46%) had a
score that was lower than 3 on engagement, and a score of 3 is
described as acceptable by the developers of the MARS.32 This
reflects the fact 46% of the reviewed apps failed to offer their
content in a well-targeted, entertaining and interesting way, with
options for customisation and interactivity. The apps demonstrated
the lowest median score for information, with a score of 3 (s.d. =
0.51). A score of 4 on information, which is described as ‘good’,
was given to only three apps (13%). The 21 apps that received a
score lower than 4 varied in the quality of the information that

was offered, from not offering any information on compassion at all,
to offering good-quality information on compassion but mixing the
information with information on many different concepts to the
point where the definition of what compassion entails remained
hard to grasp.

Evidence base

None of the 24 apps that were reviewed have been studied in
randomised controlled trials. We did find a study protocol for
a randomised controlled trial focusing on the effectiveness of the
app ‘Insight Timer’ in reducing anxiety and improving well-being
during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was estimated to be
completed April 2021,37 but the results of this trial have not been
published yet.

Two apps (8%) have been trialled in studies that are not rando-
mised controlled trials: ‘Insight Timer – Meditation App’38–40 and
‘Petit BamBou: Meditatie’.34 These studies included three pilot
studies in which respectively college students,38 military nurse prac-
titioners39 and neurological patients40 were instructed to use the app
‘Insight Timer’ for a certain period of time. Positive outcomes were
reported in terms of significant decreases in state and trait anxiety,38
improvement in levels of burn-out and stress in 75% of the partici-
pants39 and lower pain scores compared with matched controls.40
The app ‘Petit BamBou: Meditatie’ was rated by Nunes et al on its
quality as one of the available mindfulness apps for children, and
it received the highest rating of the apps that were studied.34 For
each of these studies, the apps were employed or reviewed as ‘mind-
fulness apps’. These studies did not focus (specifically) on the sec-
tions of
included compassion exercises, and
compassion was not one of the outcomes that was measured.

these apps that

Consistency with evidence base

In addition to checking the evidence base of the apps, we also rated
the apps on the extent to which they are consistent with existing and
studied compassion based interventions. The results are demon-
strated in the last column of Table 2. A total of nine apps received

an ‘yes’ on this rating because their content was rated as being con-
sistent with the content of existing and studied compassion based
interventions. The remaining 15 apps received a ‘no’ because they
failed to meet this criterium. These apps claim to provide a frame-
work for improving compassion in the description of the app, but do
so in a way that is not consistent with existing and studied compas-
sion based interventions. In fact, seven apps (29%) failed to even
mention the concept of compassion in the app itself, despite the
descriptions of these apps stating that they provided frameworks
for improving compassion. An example is the app ‘16Guidelines
for a Happy Life’, which offers information and exercises to practice
with 16 guidelines for life, including ‘kindness’, ‘generosity’ and
‘gratitude’, but compassion is not mentioned anywhere within the
app. Another example is the app ‘Yoga For Kids – Kids Fitness’,
which states in the description that it ‘fosters cooperation and com-
passion in your children’, but offers instructions on yoga poses
without mentioning compassion anywhere. The other eight apps
(33%) did mention compassion, but provided little or no informa-
tion on what it entails and how to improve it, or misrepresented
compassion. Compassion was misrepresented in two ways: (a) by
presenting content that was focused on the cultivation of love, kind-
ness and care in general, whereas compassion is defined as love,
kindness and care specifically in response to suffering;11 and (b)
by presenting content that focuses on compassion as the opposite
of self-centeredness.

Top-rated apps
The highest rated app, ‘The Self Compassion App’ (quality mean
score of 4.54), is the only app included in this review that solely
focused on improving compassion. It contains a step-by-step
course that consists of 27 succeeding sessions. Each session is a com-
bination of theory (that is either available as written text or as an
audio fragment) and exercise, that help users work with difficult
thoughts and emotions with techniques from compassion-focused
therapy. The ‘Self Compassion App’ stands out with the high
quality of the information that it offers and the engaging way in

which this information is offered. It contains different options for
customisation and different interactive features (such as a measure-
ment of heart rate variability).

The second-highest rated app, ‘Imagine Clarity’ (quality mean
score of 4.35), contains different meditation courses and one of
them is presented as a course that is focused on improving compas-
sion. This course is called ‘the dynamics of altruistic love’ and con-
tains a total of seven 20-min meditations. These meditations are
focused on building feelings of love, compassion and joy for every-
one without partiality. The mediations offer users the experience of
simply observing difficult emotions or situations instead of turning
their attention away from them, and to allow themselves to be
touched by what they observe and look at it from the perspective
of wanting all human beings to be happy and free of suffering.
Similar to the ‘Self Compassion App’, ‘Imagine Clarity’ stands out
with the high quality of the information that it offers. Compared
with ‘The Self Compassion App’, ‘Imagine Clarity’ received mark-
edly lower scores for engagement, because it contains little or no
options for customisation or interactivity. On the other hand,
‘Imagine Clarity’ received higher scores on ‘aesthetics’, because it
offers graphics that score high on attractiveness and a profes-
sional-looking layout.

The third-highest rated app, ‘Insight Timer – Meditation App’
(quality mean score of 4.24), contains a great amount of meditation
courses and practices, and among these are different compassion
practices and different courses that at least touch upon compassion
as a subject. The current review was focused on a Dutch course
called ‘Making friends with yourself’, which is described as a
10-day course that teaches users to have more compassion for
themselves and treat themselves with more kindness, and, as a
consequence, experience less stress and be more resilient. Each of
the 10 days consists of a meditation practice that focuses either on
mindfulness, noticing the good, taking care of oneself, gratitude
or the practice of self-compassion. The meditation practice is fol-
lowed by a multiple choice question that encourages users to
reflect on how the material that was presented relates to them,
such as ‘Where in your body do you notice what you are feeling
most easily?’.
‘Insight Timer – Meditation App’ scores lower
on information compared with ‘The Self Compassion App’ and
‘Imagine Clarity’, because the section that was reviewed also
focuses on many different concepts (‘noticing the good’, gratitude
and forgiveness). These are separate concepts and not part of
what compassion entails,11 but this is not explained within the
app, which might lead to confusion on the definition of compassion.

The app does, however, contain a great number of exercises and
courses that offer relevant and correct information on what compas-
sion entails and how to improve it. In addition, ‘Insight Timer –
Meditation App’ also stands out with the engaging way in which
the content is offered by offering numerous options for connecting
with other users and teachers. For example, it shows the number of
people that are using the app when you are, if you give permission it
connects you to colleagues that also use this app and you can join
live classes or ‘classrooms’ to ask questions.

Discussion

Smartphone applications that offer compassion-based interven-
tions, or ‘compassion apps’, are available for the general public,
but to the best of our knowledge, these apps have not previously
been reviewed on their quality. The current study therefore
focused on qualitatively reviewing existing compassion apps. The
search for compassion apps led to the inclusion of 24 apps. These
24 apps were reviewed on both the extent to which they are consist-
ent with existing and studied compassion-based interventions, and
their overall quality, which included ratings on engagement, func-
tionality, aesthetics and information. Through these ratings, eight
compassion apps were identified that, with regard to their
content, are consistent with existing and studied compassion-
based interventions, and were scored as acceptable to good with
regard to their overall quality. Compared with mindfulness apps,
which have also been qualitatively reviewed, this score is rather
low: a review performed by Mani et al identified 23 mindfulness
apps, 20 of which were scored as acceptable to good with regard
to their overall quality.33

Furthermore, 11 of the 24 apps were scored below acceptable (a
score of 3) on the engagement subscale. This result is deemed
important because it has been shown that the effectiveness of com-
passion-based interventions depends on the amount of practice: a
greater level of formal compassion practice is associated with
higher levels of compassion.17 Therefore, less-engaging apps, even
when they offer strong or evidence-based content, might be less
effective in improving compassion because they might fail to stimu-
late repeated practice. Engagement has been identified as an issue
with regard to digital behaviour change interventions in general,
but it has also been shown that it is possible to influence the level
of engagement.28,41 For example, a review performed by Kelders
et al showed that it is possible to use technology to improve adher-
ence with regard to web-based interventions.28

Randomised controlled trials with the 24 included apps have not
been published in scientific literature to date. Two apps have been
trialled in studies that are not randomised controlled trials, and
demonstrated positive outcomes in these studies.34,38–40 However,
these studies did not (specifically) focus on the sections of these
apps that included compassion exercises, but rather focused on
these apps as mindfulness apps. The scarce scientific evidence
base for compassion apps is in line with an earlier review that
showed a lack of scientific evidence for mental health apps in
general.21

In addition to checking the evidence base of the apps, the apps
were also reviewed on the extent to which they are consistent with
existing and studied compassion-based interventions. These reviews
demonstrate that 15 of the 24 available compassion apps claim to
provide a framework to improve compassion, but each app does
so in a (completely) different way than evidence-based compassion
interventions normally do. Some of these apps claim to provide a
framework for improving compassion in the description of the
app in the app store, but do not even mention compassion within
the app itself. These results are in line with studies demonstrating

6

that many mental health apps, that have not been scientifically
studied, offer content that is not in line with existing guidelines
or evidence-based practice.24,25 Since the frameworks that these
15 apps offer to improve compassion have not been tested, there
is no support that applying the offered exercises will actually lead
to an improvement in compassion. The fact that 15 of the 24 avail-
able compassion apps offer content that is not in line with evidence-
based practice poses a risk for users, as has been suggested for the
existence of low-quality mental health apps in general.29 This is
especially true because users might not be able to discern high-
quality from low-quality compassion apps, as has been suggested
for mental health apps as a whole.25

Another important observation is that from the nine apps that
were reviewed as being consistent with evidence-based interven-
tions, six apps were scored below good (a score of 4) on the infor-
mation subscale. Some apps failed to offer a clear definition of
what compassion entails, and other apps mixed the information
on compassion with information on many different concepts to
the point where the definition of what compassion entails remained
hard to grasp. This observation is deemed important because, with
regard to face-to-face compassion-based interventions, it has been
shown that the effectiveness of these interventions is influenced by
the extent to which the recipients understand the concept of compas-
sion.42 Therefore, apps that offer sound content, but fail to clearly
bring across a definition of compassion, might be less effective.

Given the potential of mental health apps in general, and com-
passion apps in particular, we would recommend performing scien-
tific trials to test the efficacy of compassion apps. The results of the
current review could serve as a first step toward performing scien-
tific trials with compassion apps, by identifying good-quality com-
passion apps that might be worth the investment of a scientific trial.
In the meantime, the results of the current review could serve as a
guide for healthcare professionals looking for good-quality compas-
sion apps to recommend to patients. Furthermore, the current
review identifies major areas for improvement for the future devel-
opment of compassion apps: offering interventions that are based
on studied frameworks for improving compassion, offering a clear
definition of compassion and increasing engagement. Finally, the
results of the current review, and the notion that users are unable
to tell high-quality apps from low-quality apps,25 underlines the
importance of a system that supports potential users in judging
existing mental health apps on their quality. In this regard, we
would like
such as
‘Psyberguide’ and ‘VicHealth’. These online libraries assist users
in their selection of a high-quality mental health app, and we
believe that it would be beneficial for these libraries to gain publicity
among mental health app users.

Recommendations for health professionals

Interventions that focus on improving compassion help to cultivate
a mindful and caring way of responding to pain or difficulty. Instead
of either shutting out painful feelings or thoughts or losing oneself in
distress over them, people are taught skills to become aware of pain
or difficulty and use their innate capacity for love and care to slow
down their bodies and feel grounded, and to act in a way that is
focused on resolving or relieving suffering. As such, the eight com-
passion apps in the current review that were identified as meeting
the various criteria for sufficient quality (see the top eight apps in
Table 2) can be relevant for a wide variety of patients. This includes
both those with and without a clinical mental health diagnosis, since
compassion interventions have been shown to be relevant both in
clinical populations and community samples. These compassion
apps may be particularly useful for people that experience high
levels of shame or self-criticism, or more generally, people that

Compassion apps for mental health

want to develop a kinder way of relating to themselves, especially at
those moments when life gets difficult, such as in situations of
failure or loss.

Limitations

For the current review, the decision was made to include all apps
that claim to offer a framework to improve compassion, and to
review their quality with the MARS, even when the apps turned
out to offer little or no information on the subject of compassion.32
The MARS includes ratings on different quality domains (engage-
ment, functionality, aesthetics and information), which are com-
bined to calculate a quality mean score. As a result of this
procedure, in which a mean is calculated without giving extra
weight to certain quality aspects, combined with our inclusion cri-
teria, certain apps received a high-quality mean score (e.g.
‘16Guidelines for a Happy Life’ and ‘Piku – Calm Kids’) despite
not mentioning compassion within the app. We have tried to over-
come this limitation by including a rating on consistency with evi-
dence base. We have chosen to base this rating on the extent to
which the content of the apps was consistent with existing compas-
sion-based interventions that, according to an earlier review, have
been scientifically studied.14 However, this review also concludes
that the empirical evaluation of compassion-based interventions is
still in its infancy, and much more research is needed to test the
effectiveness of these interventions. This should be kept in mind
with regard to the conclusions of the current review as well. The
quality of compassion apps could be rated more precisely if data
becomes available on the effectiveness of different individual com-
ponents of compassion-based interventions.

Finally, it was a considered decision to focus specifically on apps
that use the term ‘compassion’ in their description. First, because it
was the intention to focus specifically on apps that claim to focus on
improving compassion, and compassion has been argued to be
similar to but broader than constructs such as kindness and
empathy.36 Second, this decision was influenced by the fact that,
for the Apple App Store, running a search with different search
terms is not possible. The search should than be repeated for each
search term separately. However, because of this decision, we
might have missed compassion apps that describe their content
with different terminology. The results and conclusions of this
review are therefore limited to compassion apps that use the term
‘compassion’ to describe their content.

In conclusion, compassion for oneself and others has been
shown to positively affect mental health in the context of suffer-
ing.5–10 Compassion apps may be supportive in developing compas-
sion skills and applying compassion in daily life. Based on this
review, currently eight of the 24 included apps meet the various cri-
teria for sufficient quality. However, the effects of these apps, or the
sections of these apps that contain compassion exercises, have not
been studied in trials. So, at present, there is no knowledge about
their efficacy with regard to improving compassion. It is therefore
highly recommended that future research focuses on evaluating
the impact of good-quality apps. In addition, we feel that the field
of mobile mental health would profit from further research on
what constitutes good-quality apps, or determining that factors
that affect the efficacy of mobile mental health apps. Many of the
apps did not meet the criteria for sufficient quality that were set
for the current review. Many apps failed to offer a clear definition
of compassion, or to offer exercises that are evidence and theory
based. Furthermore, several apps failed to stimulate repeated use
by increasing engagement. It is therefore recommended that com-
passion apps are developed that offer a clear definition of compas-
sion, offer evidence- and theory-based exercises and implement
tools for increasing engagement.
