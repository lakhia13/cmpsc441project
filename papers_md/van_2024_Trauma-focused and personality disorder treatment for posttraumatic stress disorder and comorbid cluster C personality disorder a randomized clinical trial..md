ABSTRACT
Background:  Posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  associated  with  high  rates  of  cluster  C 
personality  disorders  (PD),  which  may  negatively  affect  PTSD  treatment.  It  is  unknown 
whether  concurrent  treatment  for  PTSD  and  comorbid  PD  leads  to  superior  treatment 
effects, compared to standard trauma-focused treatment.
Objective:  The  objective  was  to  test  the  efficacy  of  adding  personality  disorder  treatment 
(group  schema  therapy;  GST)  to  individual  trauma-focused  treatment  (imagery  rescripting; 
ImRs).
Method:  A  two-arm  randomized  clinical  trial  (1:1  allocation  ratio)  was  conducted  between 
2018  and  2023  at  two  sites  of  a  mental  health  institution  in  the  Netherlands.  Raters  were 
blind  to  treatment  allocation.  Adult  outpatients  with  PTSD  and  comorbid  cluster  C 
personality  disorders  were  randomized  to  receive  either  ImRs (12–18  sessions)  or  ImRs + GST 
(12–18  ImRs + 52–58  GST).  The  main  outcome  was  PTSD  severity  one  year  after  start  of 
treatment measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5.
Results: Of 130 patients (mean [SD] age = 40.6 [11.2], 110 [85%] females), 66 were assigned to 
ImRs and 64 to ImRs + GST. At 12 months, there were large decreases in PTSD severity (dImRs =  
2.42,  95%CI = 1.97–2.87;  dImRs + GST = 2.44,  95%CI = 1.99–2.90),  but  there  was  no  significant 
difference  between  conditions 
in 
personality  disorder  symptoms  and  all  other  secondary  outcomes  were  observed  in  both 
conditions.  There  were  no  significant  differences  between  conditions  on  any  of  the 
secondary outcomes at 12 months.
Conclusion:  The  more 
intensive  concurrent  trauma-focused  and  personality  disorder 
treatment  (ImRs + GST)  was  not  superior  to  trauma-focused  treatment  alone  (ImRs)  for 
patients  with  PTSD  and  comorbid  CPD.  This  suggests  that  trauma-focused  treatment  is  the 
preferred  primary  treatment  in  patients  presenting  with  both  internalizing  personality 
disorder and PTSD, reserving the stepping up to more intensive psychotherapy aimed at the 
personality disorder as a second line of treatment.

Tratamiento centrado en el trauma y trastorno de personalidad para el 
trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  y  el  trastorno  de  personalidad 
comórbido del cluster C:  un ensayo clínico  aleatorizado  

Antecedentes:  El  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  (TEPT)  está  asociado  con  altas  tasas  de 
trastornos  de  la  personalidad  (TP)  del  cluster  C,  lo  que  puede  afectar  negativamente  el 
tratamiento  del  TEPT.  Se  desconoce  si  el  tratamiento  concurrente  para  el  TEPT  y  el  TP 
comórbido  conduce  a  mejores  resultados  del  tratamiento,  en  comparación  con  el 
tratamiento estándar centrado en el trauma.
Objetivo:  El objetivo fue probar la eficacia de agregar un tratamiento para el trastorno de la 
personalidad  (terapia  de  esquemas  grupal;  TEG)  al  tratamiento  individual  centrado  en  el 
trauma (reescritura de imágenes; RI).
Método: Se llevó a cabo un ensayo clínico aleatorizado de dos brazos (relación de asignación 
1:1) entre 2018–2023 en dos sitios de una institución de salud mental en los Países Bajos. Los 
evaluadores  desconocían  la  asignación  del  tratamiento.  Los  pacientes  ambulatorios  adultos 
con  TEPT  y  trastornos  de  la  personalidad  del  cluster  C  comórbidos  fueron  asignados

aleatoriamente para recibir RI (12–18 sesiones) o RI + TEG (12–18 RI + 52–58 TEG). El resultado 
principal  fue  la  gravedad  del  TEPT  un  año  después  del  inicio  del  tratamiento,  medida  con  la 
Escala de TEPT Administrada por el Clínico para el DSM-5.
Resultados:  De  130  pacientes  (edad  media  [DE] = 40,6  [11,2],  110  [85%]  mujeres),  66  fueron 
asignados  a  RI  y  64  a  RI + TEG.  A  los  12  meses,  hubo  grandes  disminuciones  en  la  gravedad 
del  TEPT  (dRI = 2,42, 
IC  del  95% = 1,97–2,87;  dRI + TEG = 2,44,  IC  del  95% = 1,99–2,90), 
pero  no  hubo  diferencias  significativas  entre  las  condiciones  (d = 0,02,  IC  del  95% = −0,33– 
0,36,  p = ,944).  Se observaron  reducciones  en los  síntomas del  trastorno de  la  personalidad  y 
en  todos  los  demás  resultados  secundarios  en  ambas  condiciones.  No  hubo  diferencias 
significativas entre las condiciones en ninguno de los resultados secundarios a los 12 meses.
Conclusión: El tratamiento concurrente más intensivo centrado en el trauma y el trastorno de 
la personalidad (RI + TEG) no fue superior al tratamiento centrado sólo en el trauma (RI) para 
pacientes con TEPT y TPC comórbido. Esto sugiere que el tratamiento centrado en el trauma 
es  el  tratamiento  primario  de  referencia  en  pacientes  que  presentan  tanto  trastorno  de  la 
personalidad  internalizante  como  TEPT,  reservando  la  intensificación  a  una  psicoterapia  más 
intensiva dirigida al trastorno de la personalidad como segunda línea de tratamiento.

1.  Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (American Psy-
chiatric  Association,  2013)  is  associated  with  high 
rates of comorbid personality disorders (PD) (Friborg 
et  al.,  2013).  Meta-analytical  evidence  suggests  that 
comorbid  PD  significantly  attenuates  the  reduction 
of  PTSD  symptoms  after  PTSD  treatment,  although 
effect sizes are still large for patients with and without 
PD (Snoek et al., 2021). The authors propose that the 
integration  of  PTSD-  and  PD-specific  interventions 
could  enhance  treatment  effects,  in  line  with  earlier 
recommendations  by  Rizvi  and  Harned  to  move 
away from single-disorder treatment and concurrently 
treat comorbid disorders to reflect clinical realities and 
enhance treatment outcomes (Rizvi & Harned, 2013). 
This raises the question whether concurrent treatment 
of comorbid PD alongside PTSD treatment may lead 
to  superior  treatment  outcomes,  compared  to  stan-
dard 
is 
known  about  the  optimal  treatment  for  those  with 
PTSD  and  PD  and  no  evidence-based  guideline  for 
concurrent  treatment  exists.  Some  have  argued  for 
trauma-focused  treatment  in  most  if  not  all  cases  of 
comorbidity  (van  Minnen  et  al.,  2012),  while  others 
have  argued  for  an  integrated  (Ingenhoven,  2015) 
approach.

treatment  (TFT).  Little 

trauma-focused 

Nearly  all  research  on  PTSD  and  PD  comorbidity 
has  focused  on  borderline  PD  (Harned,  2014).  How-
ever, cluster C PD (CPD, i.e. avoidant, obsessive-com-
pulsive  and  dependent  PD)  comorbidity  rates  are 
among  the  highest  in  PTSD.  Friborg  and  colleagues 
report  a  mean  weighted  proportion  of  .63  for  CPD 
comorbidity  based  on  199  cases,  with  .23,  .08,  and 
.20 for avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive 
PD based on 1076 cases, respectively. For comparison, 
the  mean  weighted  proportion  of  borderline  PD  was 
.22  based  on  1401  cases  (Friborg  et  al.,  2013).  More-
over,  CPD  are  associated  with  high  levels  of  impair-
ment,  economic  costs, 
interpersonal  problems, 
suicidality,  all-cause  mortality  and  low  quality  of  life 

(de  Reus  &  Emmelkamp,  2012;  Disney,  2013;  Lampe 
&  Malhi,  2018).  Yet,  they  are  underrecognized  and 
poorly studied, although some evidence suggests that 
schema therapy  is effective  (Bamelis  et  al., 2014) and 
more  research  is  currently  being  conducted  (Baljé 
et  al.,  2016;  Daniëls  et  al.,  2023;  Groot  et  al.,  2022). 
From  a  clinical  perspective,  the  pervasive  behavioral 
and experiential avoidance, passivity, control mechan-
isms,  and  hypersensitivity  to  rejection  and  criticism 
exhibited  by  patients  with  CPD  may  complicate 
PTSD  treatment,  in  which  exposure  to  fear-eliciting 
stimuli is an important element. For  example, avoid-
ance of fear-eliciting stimuli may result in difficulties 
in building a strong patient-therapist working alliance, 
suboptimal treatment engagement and poor treatment 
attendance. Indeed,  higher levels of  in-session  avoid-
ance behavior predicted higher dropout rates in cogni-
tive  processing  therapy  for  PTSD  (Shayani  et  al., 
2023).  These  findings  are  important  because  attach-
ment style is highly relevant to assessment and treat-
ment. For example, it is more difficult for a therapist 
to establish and maintain a relationship with an indi-
vidual who is distrustful of others, who is hypersensi-
tive  to  criticism  and  rejection,  and  who  relies  on 
avoidant  coping  strategies.  This  may  lead  to  attenu-
ated  treatment  effects  and  higher  dropout  rates. 
Thus,  the  concurrent  addition  of  schema  therapy  to 
TFT,  which  is  aimed  at  breaking  through  such  long- 
standing  maladaptive  mechanisms,  may  increase  the 
effectiveness of TFT.

We present the first randomized clinical trial (RCT) 
directly comparing stand-alone TFT with and without 
personality disorder treatment in a sample of patients 
with PTSD and comorbid CPD. Specifically, we tested 
whether  individually  delivered,  PTSD-focused  ima-
gery rescripting (ImRs, not to be confused with ima-
gery  rehearsal 
therapy,  a  cognitive  behavioral 
approach  to  treating  nightmares)  (Krakow  &  Zadra, 
2006)  combined  with  group  schema  therapy  (GST) 
was  more  effective  than  stand-alone  ImRs.  While 

ImRs  is  currently  not  included  among  the  first-line 
recommended  psychological  interventions  for  PTSD 
in most guidelines, ImRs has been shown to be an evi-
dence-based,  effective  and  tolerable  treatment  for 
PTSD, specifically childhood-related PTSD (Boterho-
ven de Haan et al., 2020; Raabe et al., 2022). Addition-
ally, ImRs is commonly utilized in schema therapy to 
address  various  adverse  experiences  linked  to  PD 
pathology,  and  its  application  aligns  well  with  the 
principles of schema therapy. Opting for ImRs along-
side GST eliminates the necessity for patients to fam-
iliarize themselves with an extra therapeutic technique 
and  its  underlying  rationale,  thereby  streamlining 
their  involvement  in  both  ImRs  and  GST  simul-
taneously. Finally, GST has been shown to be effective 
in  treating  CPD  (Arntz  et  al.,  2022;  Jacob  &  Arntz, 
2013;  Rameckers  et  al.,  2021).  Therefore,  based  on 
the  attenuated  PTSD  treatment  effects  in  the  case  of 
PD comorbidity, and the recommendations to concur-
rently treat comorbidity, our primary hypothesis was 
that PTSD symptom severity reductions would be lar-
ger  after  concurrent  ImRs + GST  compared  to  ImRs 
only.  Further,  it  was  hypothesized  that  concurrent 
ImRs + GST  would  outperform  ImRs  on  a  range  of 
secondary outcome variables: self-report PTSD sever-
ity,  CPD  symptoms,  quality  of  life,  functioning,  gen-
eral  psychiatric 
treatment 
response,  PTSD  remission  and  dropout.  The  current 
study is part of a project in which the effect of adding 
PD treatment to TFT is investigated in CPD and bor-
derline PD in two distinct RCTs (Snoek et al., 2020).

2.  Methods

2.1.  Study  design

A single-blinded RCT with two arms was conducted at 
two  sites  of  the  Sinai  Center,  a  mental  health  insti-
tution specialized in PTSD treatment in The Nether-
lands.  The  present  study  was  registered  under 
NCT03833531  on  ClinicalTrials.gov  and  approved 
by  the  regional  Medical  Ethics Committee  (reference 
number 2017.335) and the study design has been pub-
lished elsewhere (van den End et al., 2021). The study 
was conducted in accordance with the Dutch Medical 
Research  Involving  Human  Subjects  Act.  There  were 
some deviations to the original research protocol, for 
example due to measures taken by the Dutch govern-
ment  in  response  to  the  2020  COVID-19  pandemic 
(see supporting information).

2.2.  Patients

Patients  were  eligible  for  the  study  if  they  were  aged 
18–65 years and had a primary diagnosis of post-trau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) according to DSM-5 cri-
teria  diagnosed  during  the  regular  intake  procedure.

In  addition,  at  least  three  symptoms  of  avoidant  PD, 
four symptoms of dependent PD, or three symptoms 
of obsessive-compulsive PD were required. The reason 
for including patients with a subthreshold number of 
symptoms for any particular CPD was the recognition 
that some patients do not meet the full diagnostic cri-
teria for a specific CPD, but satisfy the general criteria 
for PD and exhibit symptoms from various categories 
of CPD (often diagnosed as other specified personality 
disorder or mixed personality disorder). Finally, in the 
case of psychotropic medication use, a stable regimen 
for at least three weeks was required. Exclusion criteria 
were current psychosis, severe aggression, treatment- 
interfering substance and eating disorders or somatic 
problems,  IQ < 70,  and  insufficient  mastery  of  the 
Dutch language.

2.3.  Randomization  and  blinding

Patients were randomized to one of two conditions by 
computerized  block  randomization  (allocation  ratio 
1:1, n = 6 per block) after screening for inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria  and  obtaining  informed  consent. 
In the case of both CPD and borderline PD comorbid-
ity during the screening phase, patients were given the 
choice  to  participate  in  one  of  two  trials.  The  other 
trial  compared  eye  movement  desensitization  and 
reprocessing  with  versus  without  dialectical  behavior 
therapy for patients with PTSD and comorbid border-
line PD. Sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes con-
taining  the  allocation  information  were  prepared  by 
an  independent  administrative  assistant  unfamiliar 
with the  study and  opened  together with  the patient. 
Assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Blinding 
patients  and  therapists  was  not  possible  for  these 
psychological treatments.

evidence-based  trauma-focused  therapy  and  com-
pleted  at  least  100 h  of  accredited  training  in  cogni-
tive–behavioral 
ImRs 
therapists  received  training  from  an  expert  in  ImRs 
and  all  schema  therapists  completed  at  least  25 h  of 
accredited  schema  therapy  training.  To  ensure  treat-
ment  fidelity  in  addition  to  formal  adherence  and 
competence  analysis,  therapists  were  required  to 
attend  biweekly  supervision  sessions  by  experienced 
ImRs  and/or  schema  therapists  in  which  audiotaped 
(ImRs)  and  videotaped  (ST)  material  was  discussed. 
Some  therapists  provided  both  GST  and  ImRs  but 
they  did  not  provide  ImRs  to  patients  for  whom 
they served as GST therapist.

assistants  who  attended  weekly  meetings  in  which 
audiotaped  material  was  scored  and  discussed  to 
ensure interrater reliability. Questionnaires were pro-
vided digitally.

2.4.2.  Treatments  and  timing  of  measurements
Patients in the ImRs + GST condition started with four 
pre-treatment  sessions.  In  these  sessions,  the  schema 
mode case conceptualization was created. T0 immedi-
ately followed the pre-treatment. GST started after T0 
and ImRs was introduced for patients in this condition 
after  approximately  six  weeks  (up  to  a  maximum  of 
three  months  depending  on  therapist  availability). 
Patients  in  the  ImRs  only  condition  received  12–18 
weekly  sessions  of  ImRs  starting  after  T0.  For  both 
conditions, T1 followed three months after T0. More-
over,  T2  was  linked  to  the  end  of  trauma-focused 
treatment  in  both  conditions.  T3,  T4  and  T5  took 
place  3,  6  and  9  months  after  T2,  respectively.  See 
Figure  S1  in  the  supporting  information  for  a  visual 
representation  of  the  study  design  and  timing  of 
measurements.

ImRs  is  a  standalone  intervention  for  PTSD.  It  is 
aimed  at  changing  emotional  and  cognitive  aspects 
of aversive memories by changing the course of events 
within the traumatic memory by using imagination. A 
detailed  description  of  the  ImRs  procedure  has  been 
published  elsewhere  (van  den  End  et  al.,  2021).  The 
ImRs  protocol  was  based  on  the  protocol  used  in  a 
previous study on ImRs and consisted of a minimum 
of twelve and a maximum of 18 75 min individual ses-
sions (Raabe et al., 2015). After 12 sessiTreatment was 
prolonged with a maximum of six sessions when indi-
cated by a multidisciplinary team based on symptom 
severity,  patient  preference  and  therapist  judgment. 
Clinicians  were  instructed  to  complete  treatment 
within six months.

Schema therapy is aimed at identifying and meet-
ing core emotional needs that have not been met in 
early life (i.e. secure attachment, autonomy, freedom 
to express, spontaneity and play, and realistic limits) 
(Young et al., 2003). The GST procedure was prere-
gistered (van den End et al., 2021) and the protocol 
was  based  on  existing  manuals  (Farrell  et  al.,  2014; 
Vreeswijk et al., 2012), and consisted of four individ-
ual  pre-treatment  sessions  (45 min)  and  40  weekly 
GST  sessions  (90 min).  The  goal  of  the  pre-treat-
ment  sessions  was  to  acquaint  patients  with  the 
schema  and  schema  mode  concepts  and  to  make 
an  individualized  caseconceptualization  according 
to  schema  therapy  principles  for  every  individual 
group  member.  Additionally,  12–18 
sessions 
(75 min)  of  group  schema  therapy  were  added  in 
2–3 blocks divided over a year in which experiential 
components  of  the  GST  protocol  were  emphasized. 
These  blocks  were  denoted  as  schema-focused  psy-
chomotor  therapy  in  the  original  research  protocol 

to  emphasize  the  experiential  focus  of  these  group 
schema therapy sessions. To be sure, these experien-
tial  GST  blocks  consisted  of  evidence-based  GST 
interventions,  such  as  chair  work,  mode  awareness 
exercises,  and  imagery  work.  Finally,  patients  were 
offered  three  optional  individual  booster  sessions 
posttreatment  (i.e.  schema  therapy  or  ImRs).  The 
GST protocol did not contain ImRs sessions target-
ing  PTSD  A-criterion  traumata.  Treatment  proto-
cols are available upon request.

Protocol adherence and therapist competence were 
rated  by  three  independent,  graduate-level  research 
assistants  who  were  trained  in  the  use  of  the  rating 
instruments  by  the  first  author.  A  random  selection 
of  audiotaped  ImRs  sessions  was  rated  with  the 
ImRs Therapist Adherence and Competence Protocol 
(Raabe et  al.,  2015).  Sessions  were  rated  on the  pres-
ence and quality of 37 elements of ImRs and averaged, 
resulting 
in  an  adherence  (number  of  present 
elements)  and  competence  (1 = not  provided  accord-
ing  to  the  protocol  to  4 = intervention  was  provided 
well  by  the  therapist)  score.  GST  delivery  was  rated 
with  the  Group  Schema  Therapy  Rating  Scale  – 
Revised (Zarbock et al, 2014) by averaging adherence 
(number  of  present  elements)  and  competence  (0 =  
very poor to 6 = excellent) scores for 28 items on gen-
eral therapist behavior, limited reparenting, group cli-
mate, structure, and therapist team quality.

2.5.  Outcomes

A  range  of  clinical  and  demographic  variables  were 
assessed at baseline, including psychiatric comorbidity 
(Structured  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-5  Disorders: 
Clinician Version; First et al., 2016) childhood trauma 
(Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire;  Bernstein  et  al., 
2003) potentially traumatic events (Life Event Check-
list-5; Weathers et al., 2013) depression severity (Bech 
Depression  Inventory-II;  Beck  et  al.,  1996)  emotion 
regulation  difficulties  (Difficulties  in  Emotion  Regu-
lation Scale; Gratz & Roemer, 2008) and  dissociation 
(Dissociative  Experiences  Scale-II) 
(Carlson  & 
Putnam, 1993). All outcome variables were pre-regis-
tered (van den End & Thomaes, 2018).

Information on psychometric properties and Cron-
bach’s alpha values for the primary and secondary out-
comes  can  be  found  in  the  supporting  information. 
The  primary  outcome  variable  was  PTSD  severity  at 
T4  (6  months  after  ImRs)  measured  with  the  Clini-
cian-Administered  PTSD  Scale  for  DSM-5  (CAPS-5) 
(Weathers  et  al.,  2018).  The  CAPS-5  is  a  structured 
diagnostic  interview  assessing  the  occurrence  and 
severity of 20 PTSD symptoms in four symptom clus-
ters (B, C, D and E) on a 5-point scale, resulting in a 
total score ranging from 0 to 80. The CAPS-5 is widely 
regarded  as  the  gold  standard  to  assess  the  occurrence 
and severity of PTSD in adults. Secondarily, self-reported 

PTSD symptom severity was measured with the PTSD 
Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item questionnaire 
(total score range 0–80) (Blevins et al., 2015).

CPD  symptoms  were  assessed  with  the  Structured 
Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-5  Personality  Disorders 
(SCID-5-PD)  (Arntz  et  al.,  2017).  To  allow  the  effect 
of  therapy  to  be  reflected  in  the  scoring,  a  symptom 
was scored as absent at T4 if the symptom was not pre-
sent in the past 6 months. Quality of life, functioning 
and  general  psychiatric  symptom  severity  were 
measured  with  the  EuroQol  visual  analogue  scale 
(EQ  VAS,  a  1-item  self-report  scale  ranging  from  0 
to  100)  (Herdman  et  al.,  2011)  the  World  Health 
Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-
DAS 2.0, a 36-item self-report questionnaire resulting 
in an averaged score ranging from 1 to 5; Üstün et al., 
2010)  and  the  Outcome  Questionnaire-45  (OQ-45,  a 
in  a 
45-item  self-report  questionnaire  resulting 
summed  score  ranging  from  0  to  180;  de  Jong  et  al., 
2007)  respectively.  Treatment  response  was  pre- 
registered  as  a  PTSD  severity  reduction  of  baseline 
SDpooled ≥ 1.0. PTSD remission was defined as failure 
to reach the DSM-5 PTSD criteria threshold at T4 in 
the  original  study  design.  However,  due  to  con-
straints  in  the  number  of  variables  that  we  were 
able  to  include  to  achieve  a  stable  multiple  imputa-
tion  model  (see  statistical  analysis),  we  defined 
PTSD  remission  as  a  CAPS-5  total  score  below  12 
points  (the  minimally  required  score  to  satisfy  the 
diagnostic  threshold)  at  T4.  We  included  PTSD 
remission  defined  by  the  DSM-5  algorithm  for  the 
nonimputed dataset (see statistical analysis). Finally, 
treatment completion was defined as >8 (75%) ImRs 
sessions attended.

2.6.  Statistical  analysis

All  analyses  were  performed  in  SPSS  version  23.  A 
sample  of  n = 126  patients  was  required  to  demon-
strate  a  significant  and  medium  (Cohen,  1988)  effect 
size difference (Cohen’s d or equivalent = 0.5) between 
conditions (van den End et al., 2021). The main ana-
lyses  were  intention-to-treat  analyses.  Missing  data 
were handled by performing multiple imputation (50 
imputations)  using  fully  conditional  specification 
(Collins et al., 2001; Huque et al., 2018).

Continuous  outcomes  were  analyzed  with  linear 
mixed  models  with  age,  baseline  outcome  score  (all 
centered), sex, treatment, time, baseline outcome scor-
e*time  interaction  and,  finally,  treatment*time  inter-
action  as  fixed  effects.  The  inclusion  of  covariates 
may  validly  increase  the  precision  of  the  estimates 
but  increases  the  risk  of  overfitting  the  statistical 
model.  We  chose  to  limit  the  number  of  covariates 
in our analysis to these three covariates based on the 
literature. For transparency, we reported whether ana-
lyses of the primary and secondary outcomes without

controlling for covariates altered the findings. The pri-
mary outcome was analyzed with a random intercept 
for  subject  and  a  scaled  identity  structure  for  the 
repeated  part  (Twisk,  2013).  Secondary  outcomes 
were analyzed similarly, depending on model conver-
gence.  Effect  sizes  were  calculated  following  the  for-
mula  provided  by  Hedges  and  Olkin  (Hedges  & 
Olkin,  1985)  using  estimated  marginal  means  of  the 
linear mixed models per outcome. The baseline pooled 
standard  deviation  was  derived  from  the  standard 
error of the estimated marginal means. The threshold 
for  statistical  significance  was  set  at  α ≤ .05  (two- 
tailed). Binary outcomes were analyzed with general-
ized linear models using a binomial distribution with 
a  logit  link.  Age,  sex,  condition,  and  baseline  CAPS- 
5 scores were entered as fixed effects. For the analysis 
of PTSD remission, we analyzed remission defined as 
CAPS-5  total  score < 12  in  the  imputed  dataset,  as 
constraints in the number of variables in the multiple 
imputation  model  prevented  imputation  on  an item- 
level  basis.  We  performed  an  additional  analysis  of 
remission  defined  as  failure  to  reach  the  DSM-5 
PTSD  threshold  in  the  nonimputed  dataset.  In 
addition to the intention-to-treat analysis for the pri-
mary  outcome,  three  sensitivity  analyses  were  per-
formed  following  the  linear  mixed  model  approach: 
with a non-imputed dataset, excluding TFT non-com-
pleters  and  excluding  those  with  subclinical  CPD  at 
baseline.

3. Results

A total of 130 patients participated between June 2018 
and May 2023 and were randomized to either individ-
ual ImRs (n = 66) or concurrent ImRs + GST (n = 64). 
See  Figure  1 for  the  CONSORT  flowchart.  Table  1
shows  that  the  sample  consisted  of  predominantly 
Dutch,  female  participants,  and  a  minority  was  cur-
rently  employed.  Almost  everyone  received  prior 
psychological  treatment.  Patients  had  been  exposed 
to high rates of sexual and physical violence, and the 
majority  reported  childhood  trauma.  Avoidant  PD 
was  the  most  common  CPD,  followed  by  obsessive- 
compulsive  PD.  For  those  with  subclinical  CPD 
(16%)  the  mean  number  of  CPD  symptoms  was  M 
(SD) = 4.05 (1.32), and M (SD) = 6.55 (2.58) symptoms 
of  any  PD.  Therapist  competence  was  high  for  both 
ImRs  (14  ratings,  M = 3.92,  SD = 0.07)  and  GST  (11 
ratings, M = 4.59,  SD = 0.58). Overall protocol adher-
ence  was  satisfactory,  with  M  (SD) = 27.93  (3.10)  out 
of  37  elements  present  in  ImRs  and  M  (SD) = 23.2 
(2.18) out of 28 elements present in GST.

ImRs noncompletion (<9 sessions ImRs) was n (%) =  
25  (37.9%)  in  the  ImRs  only  condition  and  n  (%) = 24 
(37.5%) in ImRs + GST. Patients attended M (SD) = 9.3 
(6.2) sessions. Of 49 non-completers, ten were classified 
as responders at T4 in the non-imputed dataset. When

excluding  early  responders  (i.e.  those  whose  CAPS-5 
score  reduction  was  >1  pooled  baseline  SD  but  with 
<75%  of  TFT  sessions  attended),  a  series  of  post-hoc 
independent  samples 
tests 
revealed that noncompletion was associated with PCL- 
5  (n = 106,  p = .027,  mean  difference = 7.47),  but  not 
with  OQ-45,  CAPS-5,  age,  and  sex  (all  ps > .10).  GST 
noncompletion  was  n  (%) = 31  (48.4%)  and  the  mean 
number  of  attended  GST  sessions  was  M  (SD) = 33.3 
(18.7).

See Tables 2 and 3 for the results of the analyses test-
ing the primary and secondary hypotheses. Figure 2 dis-
plays the symptom change over time for each condition 
on the CAPS-5, PCL-5, and SCID-5-P CPD symptoms. 
Additional figures and statistics of all the non-imputed 
and  imputed  analyses  can  be  found  in  Tables  S1–S27 
and  Figure  S2.  First,  there  was  a  large  reduction  in 
CAPS-5  total  scores  in  both  conditions  at  the  primary 
endpoint  T4  (dImRs = 2.42,  95%  CI = 1.97–2.87;  dImRs +  
GST = 2.44,  95%CI = 1.99–2.90)  as  well  as  at  T2  (ImRs: 
dImRs = 1.77,  95%  CI = 1.37–2.18;  dImRs + GST = 1.69, 
95%CI = 1.29–2.09).  The  effect  of  time  was  significant 
at  T4  (p < .0001)  and  at  T2  (p < .0001).  There  was  no 
difference  between  ImRs  and  ImRs + GST  on  the  pri-
mary outcome at T4 (d = 0.02, 95%CI = −0.33–0.36) or 
T2  (d = 0.08;  95%  CI = −0.26–0.43).  Both  T0–T2  (B =  
0.15,  SE = 2.12,  p = .944)  and  T0–T4  (B = −0.81,  SE =  

2.10, p = .698) estimates from the condition*time inter-
action  term  were  not  significant.  Analysis  of  the  non- 
imputed data, treatment completers, analysis after exclu-
sion of subclinical CPD cases, and analysis without con-
trolling for covariates did not change the results in terms 
of significance and effect size.

Second, there was a large and significant reduction 
in  CPD  symptoms  in  both  conditions  (dImRs = 2.90, 
95%  CI = 2.41–3.39;  dImRs + GST = 3.04,  95%  CI =  
2.53–3.54;  p < .0001).  The  condition*time  interaction 
was  not  significant  (p = .600).  Because  of  the  low 
reliability of the CPD scale, we conducted a post-hoc 
analysis  of  avoidant  and  obsessive-compulsive  PDs 
separately  (but  not  dependent,  as  only  several  cases 
of this PD were included). The results of these analyses 
did not diverge from the composite CPD scale analy-
sis. Other secondary outcome analyses yielded similar 
results.  Main  effects  of  time  were  significant  (ps  
< .0001) and their respective effect sizes were medium 
(WHODAS,  EQ-VAS)  to  large  (OQ-45,  PCL-5).  No 
significant  condition*time  interactions  were  found 
for 
treatment 
response  and  PTSD  remission  (for  both  the  CAPS-5 
total  score  <12  in  the  imputed  and  the  DSM-5 
threshold  definitions  of  PTSD  remission)  at  T4,  and 
PCL-5,  OQ-45,  WHODAS  and  EQ-VAS  at  any  of 
the  time  points.  Two  exceptions  were  the  OQ-45  at 

treatment  noncompletion  at  T2,

(27.7%) in the imputed data. When the DSM-5 criteria 
for PTSD were applied to the nonimputed data, PTSD 
remission was achieved for n (%) = 18 (26.1%) at T4. 
Most patients (n [%] = 53 [77.9%] for the nonimputed 
sample,  n  [%] = 112  [86%]  for  the  imputed  sample) 
were  classified  as  treatment  responders  at  T4.  Two 
patients showed significant symptom worsening. Fur-
thermore,  ImRs  completion  was  not  associated  with 
the  condition  (p = .993).  Finally,  CAPS-5  total  scores 
at any time point were not associated with treatment 
completion in any condition.

There  were  three  serious  adverse  events  (SAE)  in 
the study period. SAE were documented and reported 
by  the  principal  investigator  (KT)  following  pro-
cedures  in  accordance  with  the  Dutch  Medical 
Research Involving Human Subjects Act. One patient 
in the ImRs + GST condition was hospitalized due to 
medical problems not related to the study (myocardial 
infarction).  One  patient  in  the  ImRs  condition  was 
admitted  to  inpatient  treatment  for  4  weeks  due  to 
increased  suicidality.  ImRs  treatment  resumed  after 
discharge. Lastly, one patient in the ImRs + GST con-
dition was briefly hospitalized after ingesting gamma- 
hydroxybutyric acid during the pre-treatment schema 
therapy phase, before starting ImRs.

4.  Discussion

To our knowledge, the present study is the first RCT 
directly  comparing  the  addition  of  PD  treatment 

(GST)  to  trauma-focused  treatment  (ImRs) 
for 
patients  with  PTSD  and  comorbid  CPD.  Strikingly, 
no  differences  between  conditions  were  found  for 
any of the primary and secondary outcome measures 
at  the  primary  endpoint.  Large  reductions  in  PTSD 
severity,  general  psychiatric  symptom  severity,  CPD 
symptoms and moderate improvements in health sta-
tus  and  general  functioning  were  observed  in  both 
conditions.  In  addition,  some  evidence  in  this  RCT 
suggests that the PTSD symptom reduction is specific 
to  ImRs,  because  self-reported  PTSD  symptoms  and 
general  psychiatric  symptom  severity  tended  to 
decrease  only  after  the  introduction  of  ImRs  in  the 
ImRs + GST  condition.  What  makes  these  findings 
particularly  noteworthy  is  that  patients  in  the  ImRs  
+ GST condition received a significantly higher dosage 
of psychotherapy compared to those in the ImRs only 
condition. Moreover, the higher dosage of psychother-
apy was specifically designed to address the pervasive 
and persistent avoidance, passivity, and control mech-
anisms associated with CPD. Although our study was 
originally  designed  and  powered  to  demonstrate  the 
superiority  of  one  treatment  over  the  other,  the  fact 
that  there  were  no  significant  differences  in  any  of 
the outcomes and that the absolute size of the differ-
ences was close to zero, despite the substantial differ-
ence  in  psychotherapy  dosage,  raises  the  suggestion 
that standalone ImRs might be equivalent to ImRs +  
GST.

Although no causal conclusion pertaining to ImRs 
can be drawn from the current study due to the lack of 
a control group for ImRs, the wide-ranging reduction 
in  symptoms  may  be  understood  from  the  hypoth-
esized working mechanism of ImRs. It has been pro-
posed  that  ImRs  works  through  revaluation  of 
memory  representations  of  early  adverse  experiences 
(Arntz,  2012;  Brockman  &  Calvert,  2017).  Changing 
the meaning of these memory representations, which 
are  often  laden  with  feelings  of  self-blame,  shame, 
fear,  anger  and/or  disgust,  can  be  expected  to  have 
profound effects on the sequelae of these early adverse 
experiences, including PTSD and personality disorder

most  personality  disorders  in  both  conditions.  This 
result  is  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  ImRs 
would  be  effective  in  treating  PD  (Arntz,  2011),  and 
findings that comorbid PD status significantly changes 
in response to other trauma-focused treatments, such 
as prolonged exposure and eye movement desensitiza-
tion and reprocessing (De Jongh et al., 2020; Kolthof 
et al., 2022; Markowitz et al., 2015). Whether the pre-
sent  results are  replicated in  patients  with  PTSD and 
comorbid  borderline  PD  is  currently  being  tested  in 
a parallel RCT (Snoek et al., 2020).

Treatment  noncompletion  in  the  present  study 
was  approximately  twice  as  high  as  reported  in  a 
meta-analysis  on  dropout  rates  in  trauma-focused 
treatments  (Lewis  et  al.,  2020),  although  estimates 
of  treatment  noncompletion  in  the  literature  are 
highly  heterogeneous  (Schottenbauer  et  al.,  2008). 
Low  dropout  rates  for  ImRs  were  found  in  recent 
trials  (Boterhoven  de  Haan  et  al.,  2020;  Raabe  et  al., 
2022),  but  this  finding  does  not  seem  to  generalize 
to  patients  with  PTSD  and  comorbid  CPD. 

Addressing  the  pervasive  and  persistent  avoidance, 
passivity  and  control  behavior  present  in  CPD  by 
adding  GST  to  ImRs  did  not  reduce  dropout  rates. 
An  alternative  explanation  of  high  dropout  rates 
may  be  that  they  may  be  associated  with  the  effects 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the rela-
tive  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  dropout 
rates  could  not  be  assessed.

The present study possesses notable strengths. First, 
the  study  was  adequately  powered  to  detect  medium 
differences  between  conditions.  Second,  the  present

rating  scale  are  not  applicable  in  every  session  (e.g. 
item  6  of  the  GSTRS  ‘therapist  self-discloses  in  an 
appropriate  manner  that  serves  the  therapy  process’) 
and  were  thus  rated  as  absent.  However,  this  does 
not  imply  lower quality  adherence. Finally,  the  study 
was  performed  with  a  sample  representative  of 
patients  encountered  in  a  naturalistic  setting  in 
terms  of  high  symptom  and  comorbidity  levels  and 
extensive trauma histories.

However, some limitations apply. First, no control 
group  was  included  to  compare  imagery  rescripting 
with.  As  a  result,  the  symptom  reductions  cannot 
be  causally  attributed  to  ImRs.  However,  the  large 
within-condition effect sizes are comparable to recent 
trials  on  ImRs  for  PTSD,  adding  to  the  growing  evi-
dence base showing ImRs can be as effective as other 
trauma-focused  treatments  (Boterhoven  de  Haan 
et  al.,  2020;  Raabe  et  al.,  2022).  Second,  treatment 
and  measurement  noncompletion  may  have 
impacted  the  results,  although  ImRs  completion 
rates  were  equal  for  the  two  conditions  and  analyses 
suggest  that  noncompletion  did  not  bias  the  results. 
self-reported  PTSD 
Lower  baseline 

scores  on 

symptoms  and  general  psychiatric  symptom  severity 
were  associated  with 
treatment  noncompletion, 
which  may  indicate  that  patients  with  lower  baseline 
scores  need  fewer  treatment  sessions.  Third,  we 
specifically  tested  a  group  schema  therapy  format. 
Thus, our findings may not be generalized to individ-
ual  schema  therapy.  We  chose  for  a  group  format  to 
facilitate the surfacing of interpersonal problems that 
are  believed  to  be  central  to  (cluster-C)  personality 
disorders,  although  we  readily  admit  that  there  is 
no  definitive  empirical  evidence  supporting  this 
choice.  Conversely,  group  therapy  may  have  intro-
duced  significant  additional  stress  and  anxiety  in 
this  patient  population,  compared  to  an  individual 
ST  format.  Indeed,  there  may  be  a  differential  effect 
for  ST  format.  For  example,  Arntz  and  colleagues 
recently  found  that  predominantly  GST  was  less 
effective  than  combined  individual  and  group  ST  in 
treatment  of  borderline  PD  (Arntz  et  al.,  2022), 
although  direct  comparisons  between  GST  and  indi-
vidual  ST  formats  for  CPD  are  lacking.  Moreover, 
meta-analytical  evidence  on  group  versus  individual 
psychotherapy  formats  indicates  that  therapy  format 
does  not  predict  outcome  in  general  (Burlingame 
et  al.,  2016).  Relatedly,  GST  group  sizes  were  rela-
tively  small  (i.e. < 6  members)  at  certain  stages  of 
the study due to treatment dropout and group mem-
ber absence, which may have negatively impacted the 
presumed  therapeutic  effects  of  group  dynamics, 
although,  again,  therapy  format  has  not  been  found 
to  be  a  significant  predictor  of  outcome  in  general. 
Future  studies  may  test  the  differential  effects  of 
therapy  format  in  CPD  patients.  Fourth,  PD  change 
after  treatment was  measured  by  conducting a  struc-
tured  interview  developed  to  assess  the  presence  of 
symptoms  since  at  least  early  adulthood.  Future 
studies  should  incorporate  dimensional  measures  of 
personality  functioning,  for  example  by  using  the 
Avoidant  Personality  Disorder  Severity 
Index, 
which  was  only  recently  validated  (Baljé  et  al., 
2023). Fifth, the treatment duration, dosage and, con-
sequently,  timing  of  measurements,  differed  between 
conditions.  Ideally  (at  least,  in  terms  of  internal  val-
idity) duration and dosage of treatment and the tim-
are  balanced  between 
ing  of  measurements 
conditions.  However,  we  were  specifically  interested 
in  the  added  effect  of  PD  treatment.  In  fact, 
trauma-focused  treatment  can  be  considered  treat-
ment  as  usual  in  the  present  design.  We  believed 
that measuring as close to the end of trauma-focused 
treatment as possible was the best way to assess treat-
ment  effects  in  terms  of  external  validity.  Finally, 
while we included patients from different age groups, 
and  varying  socio-economic  and  cultural  back-
grounds,  the  sample  consisted  predominantly  of 
females,  potentially  limiting  the  generalizability  of 
our  findings  to  males  and  other  genders.

5.  Conclusions and implications

In  conclusion,  PTSD  severity,  general  psychiatric 
symptoms  and  comorbid  PD  symptoms  were  greatly 
reduced at 12 months after starting ImRs in a sample 
of  severely  traumatized  patients  with  PTSD  and 
comorbid  CPD.  Moderate  effects  were  found  for 
health  status  and  general  functioning.  Strikingly,  the 
addition  of  GST  did  not  yield  superior  treatment 
effects  on  any  of  the  predefined  outcomes.  These 
findings carry several important clinical implications. 
Firstly, they suggest that offering concurrent treatment 
programs  for  both  PTSD  and  CPD  as  the  initial 
approach may not be ideal. It may be worthwhile for 
future  research  to  explore  the  advantages  of  using  a 
stepped care model, where trauma-focused treatment 
serves  as  the  first  step  in  addressing comorbid  PTSD 
and  personality  disorder.  Alternatively, 
future 
research  may  test  the  superiority  of  other  PD  treat-
ments  or  treatment  formats  (e.g.  individual)  concur-
rent to trauma-focused treatment.

Secondly, the finding that CPD symptoms are highly 
changeable after a relatively short treatment like ImRs 
has the potential to impact the treatment of personality 
disorders,  which  are  typically  lengthy  and  intensive. 
While  ImRs,  when  integrated  into  schema  therapy, 
has  shown  success  in  treating  personality  disorders, 
standalone  ImRs  may  be  an  effective  PD  treatment. 

Further  studies  with  adequate  control  groups  and 
patients  with  a  primary  diagnosis  of  CPD  and  other 
personality disorders are needed to test this hypothesis.
