- Treatment for SAD

Whether or not your depression seems to be seasonal, it's ok to ask for help at any time. You don't need to wait to see if there's a pattern.

It's likely you'll be offered the same treatments for SAD as for other types of depression.

This page covers:

- How can I access treatment for SAD?

- Talking therapies for SAD

- Medication for SAD

- Other treatments for SAD

- What if I don't feel better?

This page is part of our guide to:

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)

My GP understands my problem and has helped me gain access to counselling.


## How can I access treatment for SAD?


The first step is usually to visit your GP. If you're given a diagnosis of SAD, this will be based on your symptoms repeatedly following a seasonal pattern. It's usually for 2 or more years.

If the seasonal pattern isn't clear yet you can still get help from your GP for symptoms ofdepressionoranxiety.

Our information onhow to get help from your GPexplains how.

I was well into adulthood before I began to recognise a pattern. Initially I noticed that I often took more sick leave from my job in the winter months.


## Talking therapies for SAD


There are many different talking therapies that can be effective in treating depression.

There's more information in our pages ontalking therapies and counselling. They include information on how to access talking therapies, including through the NHS, charities or privately.


## Medication for SAD


You might be offered an antidepressant, either on its own or in combination with talking therapy. This will most commonly be a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). There's more information about SSRIs in our page onantidepressants.

Your GP might recommend you start taking antidepressants a few weeks before the season when your symptoms normally begin.

Our pages ontreatment for depressionandtreatment for anxietyalso have more information.

Medication really helps some of us but isn't right for others. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.

See our pages onthings to consider before taking medicationandyour right to refuse medicationfor more information.

Our pages oncoming off medicationgive guidance on how to come off medication safely.

Some people with winter SAD find it helpful to use a light box. This is a device that gives off strong light. Or a lamp or alarm clock that simulates dawn. This is sometimes called light therapy.

TheNHS doesn't usually provide light therapy. This is because there isn't much evidence to show it works. But some people find it helpful. More research needs to be done to find out why it works for some people but not others.

You can buy light therapy equipment yourself. Unfortunately it tends to be expensive.

There's more about trying light therapy in the NHS's information ontreatment for seasonal affective disorder.

Light therapy might not be suitable for you if you're using other treatments that can make your skin sensitive to light. For example:

- Someantipsychotics

- Some antibiotics

Light therapy might also not be suitable for you if you have an eye condition. Or if your eyes are more sensitive to light. Ask an optician or your GP for advice.

If you decide to try using a light box or lamp, you could discuss this with your doctor. They can advise on whether it's suitable for you to try. It's also a good idea to have regular eye check ups.

Using a light box wasn't perfect but the change was tangible. A real shift. I began to cope better with the dark days and didn't have the all-encompassing desire to get back into bed and stay there.


## Other treatments for SAD


You might also decide to try other treatments alongside, or instead of, talking therapies or medication. These might include:

- Complementary and alternative therapies

- Ecotherapy (nature-based treatments)

- Arts and creative therapies

Your doctor may be able to refer you to some of these. You can also contact yourlocal Mindto find out what's available locally.

I approached my GP and reported my symptoms but, as my antidepressant was increased, this just added another degree of sedation.


## What if I don't feel better?


Your doctor should check how you're doing and whether any treatment is working for you.

Different things work for different people at different times. If a particular medication or talking therapy doesn't work for you, your doctor should be able to suggest an alternative.

If you've tried a range of treatments and none of them have helped, speak to your doctor. They may be able to refer you for additional support.

For more suggestions, see our pages onseeking help for a mental health problem.
