The research and use of psychedelic medicines to treat common mental health disorders has increased substantially in the past 2 decades. At
the same time, knowledge is relatively uncommon among midwives regarding (1) the relative benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy, (2) best
practices associated with the delivery of psychedelic-assisted therapy, and (3) responsible integration of this potentially useful intervention into
mental health treatment plans. The purpose of this review is to describe current applications of psychedelic medicines to treat common mental
health disorders, to describe the current legal status of these medicines used in this context, and to explore the potential for midwifery practice in
this area with further training. This article also addresses the disparities regarding LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC populations in relation to this topic
and their historical exclusion from research and treatment access in this field.

INTRODUCTION

Although Western scientists, clinicians, and individuals have
been using psychedelics for decades, persons from Indige-
nous cultures around the globe have been using psychedelic
plant medicines, such as ayahuasca, psilocybin, and peyote,
for thousands of years.1 These medicines have historically
been used for health and healing and as part of individual and
community cultural and spiritual rituals.2 Throughout hun-
dreds of years of colonization many Indigenous cultures held
on to their longstanding plant medicine practices only to see
them suddenly co-opted by people from Western countries
in the psychedelic renaissance of recent decades.3 In many
ways, this diversion of sacred knowledge parallels the trans-
formation of childbearing from a practice rooted in holistic
healing and empowerment brought to women by midwives
to the current model that often benefits a centralized medical
system.

As a result, midwives have become skilled in negotiat-
ing ways to provide holistic care using intuitive, scientific,
and emotional wisdom in the context of the existing health
care system. Furthermore, midwives study, appreciate, attend,
and facilitate transformations throughout the life span while
aligning themselves with the goals of the patient and creating
safe spaces for human experiences. For this reason, midwives
who complete additional training in psychedelic therapy will
be valuable additions to interprofessional teams that are cur-
rently researching or using these substances for the treatment
of various mental health disorders. The purpose of this review
is to describe current applications of psychedelic medicines to
treat common mental health disorders, to describe the current
legal status of these medicines used in this context, and to ex-
plore the potential for midwifery practice in this area with fur-
ther training. This article also addresses the disparities regard-
ing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, intersex,
and asexual (LGBTQIA+) and Black, Indigenous, and peo-
ple of color (BIPOC) populations in relation to this topic, and
their historical exclusion from research and treatment access
in this field.

MODERN PSYCHEDELIC-ASSISTED THERAPY

Historical Background

In 1957, amateur mycologist Gordon Wasson experienced
psilocybin mushrooms in a traditional healing ceremony with
wise woman Maria Sabina in Mexico. Wasson described the
experience in a Life Magazine cover story, ushering in a new

✦ Psychedelic-assisted therapy has emerged as a promising modality for effectively treating several mental health disorders

and conditions.

✦ Midwives are qualified to participate in many advanced training programs for clinicians interested in a role within the

clinical research setting or within certain clinical practice models that use psychedelic therapies.

✦ Midwives can help educate patients about existing psychedelic treatment options that may be available and provide referrals

when appropriate.

✦ Efforts are needed to include BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other historically marginalized persons in terms of research and

access to care as the field of psychedelic-assisted therapy moves forward.

era of psychedelic exploration in the West.3 During the 1960s,
hundreds of research trials were published on the clinical use
of various psychedelics for treatment of depression and end-
of-life existential distress.4 Although positive outcomes were
typically produced with one or 2 doses of treatment, rather
than the daily dosing commonly used in modern psychophar-
macology (such as with antidepressants), the studies often
did not have the rigor and standards required in contempo-
rary scientific studes.5 However, during this research period,
paradigms of care for the use of psychedelics for mental health
disorders were established that continue to be foundational to
current practice, such as the importance of set and setting, de-
fined as the therapeutic qualities of the health care providers
and environment, and the importance of the preparation pro-
cess before the dosing experience and the subsequent integra-
tion process.6

Because of the public’s reaction to increasing recreational
use of these substances in various contexts and the accompa-
nying societal changes, a swift reclassification of these sub-
stances to Schedule I was observed in the late 1960s to early
1970s. The result was that these medicines were labeled as hav-
ing no medical use and a high potential for abuse; this closed
the door on further research until determined investigators
overcame prohibitive bureaucracy to reopen limited trials in
the 1990s.4

A renaissance in psychedelic research occurred in the
2000s, with rigorous clinical trials demonstrating thera-
peutic effectiveness for certain conditions when provided
with therapeutic support during the preparation, dosing,
and integration (aftercare) processes. The research and use
of psychedelic medicines to treat common mental health
disorders has increased substantially in the past decade.7 For
example, a systematic review on the use of psychedelics for
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and anxiety yielded 7
open-label trials that examined the effectiveness of ayahuasca,
psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although
only 7 studies representing 130 participants met inclusion
criteria, every study demonstrated that “psychedelic ad-
ministration caused statistically significant reductions in
depression and anxiety symptoms.”8(p16) Another systematic
review of 16 articles representing 10 clinical trials examining
serotonergic psychedelics and including single- and double-
blind placebo-controlled randomized trials, open-label trials,
and proof-of-concept trials between 2000 and 2020 showed
“promising early support for therapeutic effects of psychedelic

compounds as adjunct to psychotherapy for mood disorders
and addictions.”9(p102) Current indications for use, efficacy,
adverse effects, and ongoing studies of the most common
psychedelic substances will be discussed in this article.

Terminology

[MDMA]),11

Although many substances may produce what can be de-
scribed as psychedelic, mind-altering, or hallucinogenic
effects, these terms are too broad to describe substance
classification. For the purposes of this article, the most com-
mon categorizations will be used: (1) classical psychedelics
(also sometimes called serotonergic and including LSD,
psilocybin, and ayahuasca),10 (2) entactogens (which include
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
and
(3) dissociatives (such as ketamine).12 Pharmacologically,
psychedelics are known to be a heterogeneous group of
compounds in chemical composition that elicit a range of
subjective effects (Table 1). This article focuses on the specific
medicines that are most common in current clinical trials
and best positioned to become part of clinical practice in the
United States. These include the serotonergic agonist psilo-
cybin, currently under study for refractory mood disorders,
refractory obsessive compulsive disorder, end-of-life anxiety,
and tobacco and alcohol use disorders;11 the phenylethy-
lamine MDMA, currently being studied for the treatment of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD);13 and ketamine and its
enantiomer (mirror-image molecule) esketamine (Spravato),
cyclohexanone compounds used for the treatment of both
TRD and major depressive disorder (MDD).14 Ayahuasca and
LSD will be discussed in less depth, as these substances are not
as likely to become available legally for medical treatments in
the United States in the near future.

Psilocybin

Pharmacology

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring compound in the genus
Psilocybe mushroom and is a prodrug, rapidly dephosphory-
lating into psilocin, which bears a structural similarity to sero-
tonin (5-HT). As such, its primary targets are postsynaptic
5-HT2A receptors, which are densely expressed in key lim-
bic and cortical areas.15–17 Activation of these receptors leads
to downstream inhibition of key information routing hubs

in the brain. This results in decreased activity of the default
mode network (thought to be overstable in depression, which
inhibits the activation of the externally focused task positive
network) and transiently reorganizes the routing of the brain’s
internal communication. This may serve as a reset in a brain
that has become rigidly fixed in a particular behavioral and
emotional phenotype such as that seen in depression.18

Clinical Applications and Research

Psilocybin specifically has been studied for the treatment of
major depression,19,20 TRD,21 end-of-life anxiety,22,23 tobacco
cessation,24 and alcohol cessation.25 Symptoms of depression
in various studies are often immediately and significantly re-
duced after one dose, with effects lasting months and, for
some study participants, years.26 An open-label study using
2 doses of psilocybin 7 days apart (10 mg and then 25 mg)
assessed efficacy of treating TRD with the Quick Inventory
of Depressive Symptomatology, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure
Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the supplementary
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait scale. Depression ratings
significantly improved at the one-week and 3-month post-
treatment points.21 A follow-up study found that the antide-
pressant results remained significant at 6 months after treat-
ment, giving hope that psilocybin could become a useful tool
in treating depression.27 These results are similar to a random-
ized double-blind crossover trial of 51 patients with cancer
who had symptoms of depression and anxiety and were ran-
domized to either very low (placebo-like), low (1 or 3 mg/70
kg), or high (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) dose psilocybin with 5 weeks
between sessions. The largest decreases in observed and self-
reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were seen in
the high-dose group with sustained results for almost 80% of
participants at 6 months.22 Various studies that examined
the effect of psilocybin on mood disorders (including ma-
jor depression, end-of-life anxiety, and TRD) reported a pos-
itive correlation between mystical-type experiences and an-
tidepressant response.28 In one study, mystical experience was
measured on the Pahnke-Richards Mystical Experience Ques-
tionnaire, which measures subjective experiences of (1) inter-
nal unity, (2) external unity, (3) transcendence of time and
space, (4) ineffability and paradoxicality, (5) sense of sacred-
ness, (6) noetic quality, and (7) deeply felt positive mood.
The study included 36 participants, with 67% of participants
in this study describing their psilocybin experience as one
of the most meaningful experiences of their lives.29 Promi-
nent themes in qualitative descriptive accounts of participants’
psilocybin experiences include “exalted feelings of joy, bliss,
and love; embodiment; ineffability; alterations to identity; a
movement from feelings of separateness to interconnected-
ness; experiences of transient psychological distress; the ap-
pearance of loved ones as guiding spirits; and sharing the ex-
perience with loved ones post-treatment.”30(p354) No serious
adverse events have been reported in any trial to date, only
transient, expected side effects (see Table 1). However, in a
study of psilocybin users in the community, 2.6% of partici-
pants self-reported behaving in a physically aggressive or vio-
lent manner, and 2.7% reported receiving medical help.31 This
contrast highlights the importance of the therapeutic envi-
ronment and therapeutic relationship to mitigate or manage
the physical and psychological risks. As a Schedule I drug,
376

psilocybin is not currently available for medical use outside of
clinical trials, but it has been granted a Breakthrough Ther-
apy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), fast-tracking its development and indicating that the
drug treats a serious or life-threatening condition and offers
substantial improvement over available therapies.32 The first
movement toward legal clinical use outside of the research set-
ting in the United States occurred in November 2020 when
the people of Oregon passed Ballot Measure 109, which estab-
lished regulations and rules by the Oregon Health Authority
to implement the use of psilocybin by licensed providers be-
ginning in 2023.33

MDMA

Pharmacology

MDMA is sometimes called an entactogen, as opposed to a
classical psychedelic, for its ability to create feelings of con-
nectedness with oneself and others. MDMA is a potent re-
leaser of presynaptic 5-HT, norepinephrine, prolactin, and
oxytocin.34 MDMA is usually administered orally; its effects
begin 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion, peak at about 90 to
120 minutes, and last for 4 to 6 hours.34 It appears to decrease
the overactivity of the amygdala (the brain’s alarm system)
found in PTSD while increasing activity in the prefrontal cor-
tex, where traumatic memories are examined and recontextu-
alized during the therapeutic process.32

Clinical Applications and Research

MDMA has been demonstrated as an effective treatment
for chronic PTSD when used in tandem with psychother-
apy during dosing sessions.13,35 The pooled results of 6 clin-
ical trials sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) yield the most comprehensive
data on MDMA in the treatment of PTSD to date. These ran-
domized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials completed
between 2004 and 2017 showed that with oral doses of MDMA
(75 mg and 125 mg doses) given in 2 separate 8-hour sessions
one month apart, 72 treatment participants experienced sig-
nificantly reduced PTSD symptoms compared with 31 partic-
ipants who received placebo or control doses of 0 to 40 mg.
PTSD symptoms were reduced and sustained in the long term
by 54.2% in the MDMA dosing groups compared with a 22.6%
improvement in the control group.13 A recent phase 3 trial
demonstrated that 67% of participants in the treatment group
versus 32% participants in the control group with refractory
PTSD no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria after treatment
using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edi-
tion (CAPS-5), the most widely accepted instrument for quan-
tifying PTSD symptoms.36 The studies used a protocol that
included 3 nonmedicine therapy preparatory sessions before
treatment began and 3 to 4 integration sessions after dosing
sessions. Although chronic recreational use of MDMA or ec-
stasy has been associated with deficits in memory, cognitive
processing, sleep, and psychiatric status,37 these deficits have
not been noted in clinical trials, and very few adverse events
have been reported within trials (see Table 1).32 Within the
context of current MAPS-sponsored clinical trials, the follow-

lar disorder 1, current borderline personality disorder, eat-
ing disorder with active purging, pregnancy, and lactation.
MDMA was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation
in 2017 and is currently in phase 3 clinical trials.13

Ketamine

Pharmacology

Ketamine is an analog of phencyclidine and is a glutamate re-
ceptor antagonist, developed in the 1960s for the induction of
anesthesia.14 It is often called a dissociative because of early
reports of side effects noted by patients undergoing anesthe-
sia who experienced unexpected, intense, dissociative or hal-
lucinatory experiences.14 Its mechanism of action is complex,
binding to phencyclidine site 2 in the N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor on glutamatergic neurons, which begins a cascade
of events including brain-derived neurotrophic factor release
and mammalian target of rapamycin disinhibition, leading
to rapid neuronal dendritic growth and branching. It is this
rapid, within hours to days, neurogenesis that is thought to ac-
count for the antidepressant effects of racemic ketamine and
its left stereoisomer, esketamine.38 In the clinical setting, ke-
tamine is most often given intravenously, by intramuscular in-
jections, intranasally (esketamine), or sublingually.

Clinical Applications and Research

Ketamine is a Schedule III drug, and in addition to its use
in anesthesia, it is able to be legally prescribed off-label
for TRD and MDD, providing immediate and dramatic, al-
though short-acting, improvement in symptoms at subanes-
thetic doses.39 In a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled study, 35 patients with TRD were randomized to
one of 3 infusion groups (0.5 mg/kg, n = 12; 0.2 mg/kg,
n = 11; or normal saline, n = 12). The Hamilton Depres-
sion Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression
Rating Scale were completed by participants at 40 and 240
minutes after infusion and then on days 2 to 7 and day 14.
Researchers found that the higher dosing (0.5 mg/kg) led
to a significant reduction in depression and suicidal symp-
toms but not in anxiety distress symptoms. The lower dose
(0.2 mg/kg) did not show a rapid reduction in depression
symptoms and suicidal ideation.40 A systematic review of 6
randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials
completed between 1990 and 2013 with participants diagnosed
with unipolar and bipolar MDD diagnoses showed that ke-
tamine can rapidly improve depressive symptoms both one
day and 7 days after infusion.41 Another systematic review of
28 primary studies demonstrated that a single infusion of ke-
tamine reduced clinical depression symptoms within 24 hours
and that the benefits were sustained for between 6.8 and 30
days for the 4 single-infusion studies that measured relapse
times.42 Esketamine (Spravato), an intranasally administered
enantiomer, or mirror image, of the ketamine molecule, is ap-
proved by the FDA under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy for the treatment of TRD and MDD in patients con-
currently using antidepressant therapies.43

More recent studies have examined the efficacy of ke-
tamine in relation to postpartum depression. One random-
ized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessed rates of
postpartum depression among women with low-risk preg-
nancies who had not received a previous diagnosis of depres-
sion by a psychiatrist. The women received either intravenous
ketamine or placebo (saline) during a scheduled cesarean.
The researchers found significantly higher scores on the Edin-
burgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) among the placebo
group (22.6%) at one week postpartum than among the group
that received 0.25 mg/kg of ketamine (13.1%), with a P value of
.029 and a number of 165 in both groups.44 However, depres-
sive symptoms were not significantly different between the in-
tervention and control groups by 2 weeks postpartum.

Another randomized controlled trial measured EPDS
scores preoperatively and at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively.
Women received either 1 to 2 mg/kg of sodium thiopental and
0.5 mg/kg of ketamine or just 3 to 5 mg/kg of sodium thiopen-
tal to induce anesthesia for their scheduled cesareans.45 De-
pression scores between the intervention and control groups
were not significantly different preoperatively. At 2 weeks
postoperatively, the control group had an increase in the mean
EPDS score to 14.34, although it was not significant, whereas
the intervention group showed a significant decrease in the
mean EPDS scores to 11.82 using a P value less than 0.001. At
4 weeks postoperatively, the control group had a decrease in
EPDS score to a mean of 13.09, which was a significant dif-
ference from the 2-week postoperative mark, but not from
the original EPDS mean scores. The intervention group had
a decreased to a mean score of 10.84, which was significantly
different from the preoperative scores, but not significantly
different compared with the 2-week scores for that group.45
Essentially, although both groups showed significant im-
provements in depression scores at various times, the trend-
ing decrease happened at different points, warranting further
study to examine why.

The dissociative and hallucinatory effects of ketamine
have previously been interpreted as an unpleasant side effect.
However, in recent decades a new approach to the use of ke-
tamine at various doses and modes of administration, in tan-
dem with various types of therapy models, has embraced these
consciousness-altering elements of ketamine as therapeutic.14
Because the use of ketamine to treat depression is an off-
label application, rigorous safety data from clinical trials are
not available. Chronic, frequent abuse of ketamine has been
associated with impairments in memory, aspects of execu-
tive function, reduced psychological well-being, and bladder
cystitis.46 For this reason, some clinicians prefer supervised
in-office dosing of intramuscular or intravenous ketamine as
opposed to oral at-home dosing to reduce the risk of depen-
dence or abuse.12 Esketamine (Spravato) is subject to an FDA-
mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, further
limiting risk of diversion or misuse.

Ayahuasca

Pharmacology

Ayahuasca is used by Indigenous peoples in parts of the
Amazon jungle for certain rituals and therapeutic reasons.

Journal of Midwifery & Women’s Health (cid:2) www.jmwh.org

377

It is a beta-carboline– and dimethyltryptamine-rich hallu-
cinogenic botanical mixture made into a brew by combin-
ing bark of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine—which contains
beta-carboline alkaloids and serves as a monoamine oxi-
dase inhibitor in the gut—and the leaves of the Psychotria
viridis bush. Both of these supply the hallucinogen N,N-
dimethyltryptamine (DMT).47 DMT is both a derivative and
an analog of tryptamine and is structurally similar to psilocy-
bin. It may decrease overstable default mode network activity
and has the potential to treat symptoms of depression and sub-
stance use disorders.48 Like psilocybin and LSD, ayahuasca
also acts as an agonist at the cortical 5-HT receptors. The effect
of ayahuasca typically begins approximately 40 minutes fol-
lowing ingestion, peaks at 60 to 120 minutes, and lasts about
4 hours. Common experiences include visual imagery, nau-
sea and vomiting, contact with the spiritual world, inability to
communicate verbally, and loss of sense of time.47

Clinical Applications

There were 2 systematic review of clinical trials done be-
tween 2016 and 2020 that comprised 9 studies—5 with human
subjects and 4 that were preclinical. Both reviews presented
data to show optimistic results in the reduction of substance
use and anxiety with ayahuasca. However, the reviews in-
cluded studies that were low to moderate in study design qual-
ity because of the limited amount of research on this medicine,
therefore it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions
about efficacy.49 The botanical admixture of ayahuasca and its
status as a sacred Indigenous plant medicine make it unlikely
to become available soon for legal medicinal purposes in the
United States.

LSD

Pharmacology

The psychoactive effects of LSD were accidentally discovered
in 1943 and later studied in the 1950s and 1960s as a psychiatric
drug.50 Like psilocybin, it seems that LSD’s primarily action is
to create effect through agonist activity in the 5-HT2A recep-
tor and possibly the 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors.5 Dosing
is generally between 0.5 and 2 mcg/kg and can cause time dis-
tortion, hallucinations, and increased emotional expression
for up to 12 hours.5

Clinical Applications

A systematic review of LSD studies in psychiatry between 1950
and 2019 described 11 randomized controlled trials and found
mixed results. Although there are historical data to support
that LSD may be useful specifically in the treatment of alcohol
use disorders, the variability of study designs has made it dif-
ficult to interpret the full effects in several studies, including
those looking at anxiety and depression.5 Another issue is the
inability to create double-blind clinical trials because of the
obvious hallucinatory and observable behavioral differences
once LSD is ingested.

Microdosing

Microdosing of psychedelics is the practice of taking a very
small subperceptual dose of a psychedelic, most commonly
psilocybin or LSD, on a frequent basis such as 3 days per week,
with the aim of treating depression or enhancing mood, cre-
ativity, and focus. Popularized by online communities, recent
studies have found significant expectancy effects.51 In a single
randomized, placebo-controlled trial,52 the effects of micro-
doses of psychedelics had no significant difference compared
with placebo. Additionally, Szigeti et al showed that partici-
pants who expected to be taking a microdose but were actually
taking a placebo also experienced benefit, indicating that ex-
pectancy bias likely significantly influenced reported micro-
dosing outcomes.

IMPLICATIONS FOR MIDWIFERY PRACTICE

Midwifery is a profession that requires efficient interper-
sonal communication, humanistic qualities such as compas-
sion, respect, and patience, and the ability to synthesize scien-
tific and evidence-based knowledge into practice. Midwives
who obtain advanced training in psychedelic-assisted ther-
apy are therefore uniquely prepared to contribute to inter-
professional clinical research and treatment. These skills are
considered ideal assets of the therapists, guides (those who
sit with patients as they undergo a medicine session), health
care providers, educators, and advocates who work collabo-
ratively in the field. The precise competencies identified for
psychedelic therapists or guides are (1) an empathic abiding
presence, (2) trust enhancement, (3) spiritual transpersonal
intelligence, (4) knowledge of the physical and psychological
effects of psychedelics, (5) therapist self-awareness and ethical
integrity, and (6) proficiency in complementary modalities.6
Penn et al (2021) made the astute observation that

Nurses are skilled in holding space as patients endure challeng-
ing events in real time and for prolonged periods, whether that
be during childbirth, a sudden illness, an anxiety attack, or the
time surrounding death. This skill translates well to being able to
sit with a patient undergoing a therapeutic psychedelic experi-
ence, allowing space for whatever arises at physical, emotional,
mental, or spiritual levels.(p)

Midwives already have many of these skills and are expe-
rienced in spending long periods of time with woman while
using support skills such as therapeutic touch, interpersonal
communication, and intuition while clients experience enor-
mous life transitions. Midwives are also often the first or
only health care provider to encounter people when they are
experiencing perinatal depression or anxiety, birth trauma,
eating disorders, addiction issues, sexual assault, or general
depression and anxiety. Therefore, with added training, mid-
wives could screen, identify, and refer people for psychedelic-
assisted therapy when appropriate.

Psychedelic-assisted therapy and research are still in the
early phases of evolution, and the role of midwives within
this setting remains entirely undefined. However, midwives
are qualified to enroll in many specialized advanced train-
ing programs to be able to contribute to both research and
clinical aspects of this emerging specialty, attend confer-
ences and continuing education programs, and network with

THE PSYCHEDELIC-ASSISTED THERAPY PROCESS

Effective and safe psychedelic therapy requires extensive
preparation of the participant, all members of the care team,
and the environment in which the therapy will take place.
Much like within the birthing environment, participants’ ex-
periences during psychedelic therapy can be influenced by the

context in which it takes place. This preparation is described
as the set (mindset) and setting (environment) and includes
the intentions, attitudes, and behaviors of those present, as
well as the physical or built environment and how these fac-
tors affect the patient response to psychedelic medicines.6,54
Patients seeking for psychedelic-assisted therapy must
meet criteria either to participate in an authorized clinical
trial, or for ketamine treatment by a licensed clinician. Ke-
tamine treatment options exist within health systems and

in private practices across the United States. At the time
of this writing, there are currently clinical trials examin-
ing MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, psilocybin-facilitated
therapy for major depression (alone or comorbid with Parkin-
son’s disease or cancer diagnosis), obsessive compulsive disor-
der, early dementia, alcohol use disorder, cocaine use disorder,
eating disorders, bipolar 2 disorder, and chronic headaches
(see Table 3). Regardless of the specific medicine used, all
psychedelic-assisted therapy generally follows a similar pro-
cess. The therapist or guide, who may be a health care
provider, clergy member, or other mental health clinician with
advanced training in psychedelic-assisted therapy, first estab-
lishes the set and setting during preparatory sessions with the
participant. During these sessions of varying number and du-
ration, the patient and therapist determine individual patient
intentions, discuss expectations, and review the medicine ses-
sion process. Recent studies such as those that MAPS has con-
ducted have 6 to 8 hours of preparatory sessions in the weeks
before the medicine is administered in order for the patient to
receive the most benefit.55,56

Creating the most beneficial experience for participants
for the actual medicine or dosing session(s) also typically in-
cludes a process whereby the environment is intentionally
arranged so that soft light, natural elements, and music gener-
ate a calm, private, and comfortable ambiance for healing and
self-exploration to take place. The setting can have a signifi-
cant influence on the impact of the medicine experience, cre-
ate an optimal environment for each individual, and limit neg-
ative outcomes.54,57 Although there are obvious stylistic dif-
ference in how health care providers approach set and setting,
the most common features include the use of eyeshades,58 a
couch or other comfortable area to recline on, sheets and blan-
kets that can be layered as needed, visual art, and a musical
playlist that is curated specifically to correlate with the onset,
peak, and recession actions of the medicine being used.55 Mu-
sic plays a critical part of the therapeutic process as it can in-
fluence and enhance the subjective emotional experience of a
participant.59–61

The session typically begins with settling the participant
comfortably into the calm setting, observing initial vital signs,
answering any remaining questions, and reiterating what to

expect and what will be the plan of care for the session. Two
therapists, or guides, typically stay with the patient during the
entire duration of the medicine session and provide support
and monitoring to maintain safety standards and offer en-
couragement and reassurance to the participant. Psychedelic
therapists use a wide array of skills during this phase and may
facilitate commencing a session using guided breathing tech-
niques or reciting rituals or prayers that the participant feels
comfortable with or has requested. Once the medicine has
been administered, support is provided through a broad range
of methods depending on the individual needs of the partic-
ipant and the safety guidelines that are in place. This may
include ongoing measurements of vital signs such as blood
pressure, therapeutic touch as needed and agreed upon be-
forehand, quiet observation and transcribing or using audio
to record anything the participant verbalizes, visual cues to
give reassurance if the participant removes the eyeshades, and
verbal prompts and encouragement for the participant to ex-
plore inward.62

The period directly after the medicine session and in the
weeks following serves as a window during which behavior
and thought patterns can be discussed and examined in what
is called the integration phase.7 Integration of the experience
may take place in a single session shortly after the peak action
of the medicine, over one or more sessions during the days
and weeks following the session, or between multiple sessions
in a treatment plan. The goal of integration is to help partici-
pants process the medicine session and translate that experi-
ence into meaningful life changes. Integration offers feedback,
skills, and activities to promote healing and can consist of var-
ious therapeutic modalities including art, journaling, somatic
practices, and different types of talk therapy.62

PSYCHEDELIC MEDICINE IN THE CONTEXT OF
SOCIAL JUSTICE

Increasing interest in psychedelic medicine research and use
to maximize physical and mental health, treat addiction, heal
trauma, and in end-of-life care has led to the urgent need to
consider numerous ethical and social justice issues. Specifi-
cally, and similarly to the profession of modern midwifery,

380

Volume 67, No. 3, May/June 2022

questions have arisen related to cultural appropriation, In-
digenous rights, and racial, economic, and LGBTQIA+ eq-
uity. Little has been written about the inclusion of LGBTQIA+
persons in psychedelic research or in the possible applica-
tion of psychedelic medicine to address the special health
care needs of these communities. Efforts to increase inclusion
of LGBTQIA+ persons in psychedelic research are needed,
as well as research that centers the potential impact that
psychedelics might have on existing health and social dis-
parities in LGBTQIA+ communities. Similarly, and much
like in midwifery, where the lack of racial and ethnic di-
versity in clinicians and leaders is prevalent,63–65 racial jus-
tice issues in psychedelic medicine are further complicated
by minimal diversity among psychedelic researchers.63 Re-
search also suggests that BIPOC people may have decreased
access to psychedelic care and are underrepresented in clini-
cal trials.63,65 The main socioeconomic barrier to access is that
psychedelic-assisted therapy is not currently covered by insur-
ance and, outside of clinical trials, can cost from hundreds
to thousands of dollars per treatment either for ketamine-
based therapies in the United States or by requiring costly
travel to other countries for care using substances that are
not currently legal here. Additionally, ethical questions exist
regarding cultural appropriation and exclusion of Indigenous
persons in the planning and execution of psychedelic research
and practice3 and the potential for financial exploitation as
these plant medicines gain in popularity and are decriminal-
ized in some regions of the United States.66

CONCLUSION

Psychedelic-assisted therapy has many known and emerg-
ing applications that may benefit patients who receive care
from midwives. These applications include common men-
tal health disorders and conditions like depression, anxiety,
PTSD, and substance use disorders. Midwives should have ba-
sic knowledge of these therapies as an increasing number of
people are using them both within the United States and glob-
ally. Obtaining advanced training to better understand the
pharmacology and physiology and demonstrate proper use of
psychedelic medicines within the health care arena can be of
great benefit to midwives and the patients whom they serve.
