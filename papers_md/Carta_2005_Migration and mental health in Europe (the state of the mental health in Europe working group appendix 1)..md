Abstract
Background: This paper is a part of the work of the group that carried out the report "The state
of the mental health in Europe" (European Commission, DG Health and Consumer Protection,
2004) and deals with the mental health issues related to the migration in Europe.

Methods:  The  paper  tries  to  describe  the  social,  demographical  and  political  context  of  the
emigration in Europe and tries to indicate the needs and (mental) health problems of immigrants.
A review of the literature concerning mental health risk in immigrant is also carried out. The work
also faces the problem of the health policy toward immigrants and the access to health care services
in Europe.

Results: Migration during the 1990s has been high and characterised by new migrations. Some
countries in Europe, that have been traditionally exporters of migrants have shifted to become
importers. Migration has been a key force in the demographic changes of the European population.
The policy of closed borders do not stop migration, but rather seems to set up a new underclass
of so-called "illegals" who are suppressed and highly exploited. In 2000 there were also 392.200
asylum applications.

The reviewed literature among mental health risk in some immigrant groups in Europe concerns:
1) highest rate of schizophrenia; suicide; alcohol and drug abuse; access of psychiatric facilities; risk
of anxiety and depression; mental health of EU immigrants once they returned to their country;
early EU immigrants in today disadvantaged countries; refugees and mental health

Due to the different condition of migration concerning variables as: motivation to migrations (e.g.
settler,  refugees,  gastarbeiters);  distance  for  the  host  culture;  ability  to  develop  mediating
structures; legal residential status it is impossible to consider "migrants" as a homogeneous group
concerning the risk for mental illness. In this sense, psychosocial studies should be undertaken to
identify  those  factors  which  may  under  given  conditions,  imply  an  increased  risk  of  psychiatric
disorders and influence seeking for psychiatric care.

Comments and Remarks: Despite in the migrants some vulnerable groups were identified with
respect to health problems, in many European countries there are migrants who fall outside the
existing  health  and  social  services,  something  which  is  particularly  true  for  asylum  seekers  and
undocumented immigrants. In order to address these deficiencies, it is necessary to provide with
an  adequate  financing  and  a  continuity  of  the  grants  for  research  into  the  multicultural  health
demand. Finally, there is to highlight the importance of adopting an integrated approach to mental
health care that moves away from psychiatric care only.

1. Migration in Europe: the social, demographic 
and political context
Trends in migration in Europe
The number of migrants in the world has more than dou-
ble since 1975, with most living in Europe (56 million),
Asia (50 million) and Northern America (41 million) [1].
In 1990, migrants accounted for over 15% of the popula-
tion  in  52  countries.  Most  of  the  migration  was  from
developing  to  developed  countries,  even  though  migra-
tion within developing countries is also increasing as the
pace  of  economic  growth  and  the  demand  of  labour
between these countries also changes [2].

In Europe, mass migration is not new. During the 20 th
century  Europe  has  experienced  three  major  periods  of
movements:  around  the  time  of  the  First  and  Second
World Wars and during last decade. Migration during the
1990s has been high. It is a period characterised by new
migrations, especially from the Eastern and Central Euro-
pean  countries  and  from  the  Commonwealth  of  Inde-
pendent  States,  but  it  is  the  Balkans  war,  which  has
dominated  these  movements  [3].  Some  countries  in
Europe,  like  Ireland,  Spain,  Italy  or  Portugal,  that  have
been  traditionally  exporters  of  migrants  have  shifted  to
become  importers.  Given  the  growing  economic  and
political cooperation emerging between many European
countries,  competition  for  highly-skilled  labour  will
intensify and the demand of more labour movement will
surely continue to grow as organisms such as the Interna-
tional Organisation for Migration predicts.

The role of migration in European population change is
being debated during recent years as a result of growing
concerns about issues such as demographic ageing, short-
ages of working age populations and payment of pensions
among others [4]. The United Nations Population Divi-
sion  has suggested  that  Europe  might  need  replacement
migration to cope with this potential problems, ranging
from around one to 13 million new immigrants per year
from 2000 to 2050 [5].

Migration  has  been  a  key  force  in  the  demographic
changes of the European population during last decade.
Specifically, the components of population change for the
period  1997–99,  indicate  that  migration  was  the  most

important component in 33 per cent (15 out of 46) of the
countries. 33 countries experienced an increase in popula-
tion during that period, while 13 had a decrease. Of the 33
countries which had an increase in population, 25 had a
net  gain  of  population  through  migration  [3].  The  total
recorded stock of foreign population living in Europe in
1999/2000 was 21.16 million people, constituting a 2.6%
of  the  aggregate  population  in  Europe  [3].  This  figure
might surely have increased during recent years as immi-
gration rates in many countries have not ceased to grow.

Nevertheless, within Europe there exist great differences in
the pattern of migration depending on the countries. This
way,  some experts  have  come  to  distinguish  a Northern
and  a  Southern  model  of  immigration  in  Europe.  The
Northern model would be composed of those Northern
European  countries  (e.g.  United  Kingdom,  Netherlands,
Germany and Sweden among others), which have had a
long  experience  of  immigration  through  history,  and
especially right after Second World War, when arrival of
immigrants  experienced  a  sharp  increase.  The  Southern
model would comprise Southern European countries for
which the immigration phenomenon is relatively recent,
such as Spain or Portugal. While in Spain the percentage
of foreign 'legal' residents sum up to 3.2% of total popu-
lation in 2002, in other European countries this percent-
age fluctuates between 5–10% at this time [5].

The composition of immigration by countries is also very
different. The vast majority of immigrants in Central and
Eastern  Europe  and  Scandinavian  countries  come  from
elsewhere in Europe. Germany's immigration field is also
strongly  European,  and  along  with  Austria  and  Finland
receives a high proportion of its immigrants from Central
and Eastern Europe. In contrast, the Mediterranean coun-
tries,  together  with  UK  and  Netherlands,  attract  a  high
proportion of immigrants beyond Europe. Almost a third
of  UK's  and  Spain's  immigrants  come  from  outside
Europe [3].

Political  and  socio-economic  instability  in  and  around
Europe has significantly increased the number of refugees
and asylum seekers arriving in European countries.

A refugee is "one who flees to a foreign country or power
to  escape  danger  or  persecution"  [6].  Although  the
UNHCR statistics are based on this definition, many agen-
cies reserve the term 'refugee' for those whose application
for asylum under the terms of the Refugee Convention has
been accepted. This is to distinguish them from 'asylum
seekers', who still have to prove their right to asylum, and
'illegal aliens', who may be fleeing from danger or perse-
cution, but have not entered the official asylum procedure
or have been rejected by it.

According to United Nation High Commission for Refu-
gees (UNHCR) in 2000 there were 392.200 asylum appli-
cations  in  Europe.  Northern  European  countries  have
been receiving for a longer period of time a great popula-
tion  of  refugees,  while  countries  from  Southern  Europe
receive a vast majority of economic migration. However,
the low numbers of asylum seekers in Southern European
countries may be misleading owing to the large amount of
refugees that are thought to by-pass the step of applying
for  asylum,  then  getting  the  residence  permit  through
immigration laws or becoming "illegal aliens" [7].

The  presence  of  undocumented  immigrants  is  a  well-
established fact in most European countries. They come or
are "called" into Europe to perform badly paid, physically
and psychologically stressful jobs in highly qualified serv-
ice economies and welfare states. The closure of frontiers
to  new  immigration  has  not  prevented  the  increase  of
"illegal aliens" in Europe. On the contrary, the welfare gap
between  Europe  and  its  neighbouring  countries  makes
such  jobs  more  attractive  for  enterprising  women  and
men  in  the  poorer  and  poorest  regions  of  the  world.
According to the International Labour Office estimates, in
1991  there  were  around  2.6  million  of  undocumented
immigrants  living  in  Europe  [3].  This  is  the  last  official
data  estimated.  Other  sources  nowadays  estimate  the
number of undocumented immigrants in Europe in more
than 3 million [8], finding the largest populations in the
Southern European countries due to their structure, cul-
ture, history and geography [5]. One of the features of this
structure,  present  in  the  South  of  Europe,  is  the  great
expansion of the black economy. Although there is no way
to confirm these numbers, the trend seems to go upward.

Policy and political context of migration in Europe
Trends in migration in Europe commenced to transform a
few decades ago as the result of changes that were taken
place  in  the  economic,  political  and  social  realms.  This
inflection point was described by Massey et al [9] to take
place during the 1970s, when patterns of migration meant
a  rupture  to  those  of  all  past  migration  movements.
Among the new features of these new migrations we find,
on behalf of the immigrants, the fact that they are not sim-
ply looking for an immediate job but also for situations

which give them a higher quality of life, together with bet-
ter future possibilities for themselves and their children;
on behalf of the reception countries, the development of
a  labour  legislation  before  unknown  which  have  given
place  to  a  clear  contradiction  between  legal  and  illegal
work [10]. These trends, which have changed the profile
and  perception  of  international  migration  that  marked
the post war era, have become especially visible during the
1990s. Due to this new model of migration, characterised
for  the  change  into  a  post-industrial  society,  there  is  an
urgent need for the elaboration of policies that respond to
this new global situation.

EU member states have been practicing a policy of closing
borders  throughout  the  1990s,  a  policy  that  have  been
specially hardened during recent years. Different strategies
for restricting the entrance of immigrants have been devel-
oped by the different countries. For example, in Belgium,
Italy and Spain, the states have mixed restrictive immigra-
tion  (e.g.  establishing  a  quota  system  for  work-related
migration) policies with recurrent processes of regularisa-
tion  of  undocumented  immigrants,  while  in  Germany,
the  state  has  opted  for  restricting  immigration  via  the
mechanism of political asylum, ignoring in this way the
increasing number of undocumented immigrants http://
www.freudenbergstiftung.de.

However, the policy of closed borders do not stop migra-
tion, but rather seems to set up a new underclass of so-
called  "illegals"  who  are  –  against  all  declarations  of
human  rights  –  inhumanely  suppressed  and  highly
exploited.  Inconsistency  and  the  lack  of  a  future  vision
have  marked  the  immigration  and  asylum  policies  of
most European countries for the last fifteen years.

The EU is still in its way to elaborate a common policy and
therefore, determine its immigration model. For that the
7th  Conference  of  Minister  responsible  for  Migration
Affairs was held in Helsinki during September 2002. Nev-
ertheless, some sources point to the possible election of a
model  of  (work-related)  quotas,  a  model  that  has  been
widely criticized because of its proved failure up to now.
An  active  and  common  policy  of  immigration  not  only
focused  on  control  but  also  on  integration  policies,  is
needed in Europe, since immigration has never stopped
and will continue.

2. Needs and (mental) health problems of 
immigrants
Among all the changes a human being must face through-
out his live, few are so wide and complex as those which
take  place  during  migration.  Practically  everything  that
surrounds  the  person  who  emigrates  changes.  Aspects
ranging from diet, family and social relations to climate,
language,  culture,  and  status  are  subject  to  change.  The

decision to migrate originates in a perceived lack of pros-
pects that a person has in his own country. Every person
who emigrates experiences affective loss, but is buoyed up
in the hope  of  finding  the first  world  paradise  they  often
know so little about.

The singularity of the migratory experience lies in the fact
that it is a psycho-social process of loss and change, which
is known in the psychiatry of migration as a grief process
[11]. The grief is considered as a type of stress character-
ised by its intensity and length [12]. The process of migra-
tion  has  been  explained  through  a  model  comprised  of
seven  griefs  (losses)  causing  anguish  that  a  person  will
experience  with  time:  family  and  friends,  language,  cul-
ture, homeland, loss of status, loss of contact with the eth-
nic  group,  and  exposure  to  physical  risks.  Furthermore,
the migratory grief process is partial, as the grief's subject
do not really disappear (unlike the grief for the death of a
loved one), and recurrent, as the contact with the country
of  origin  could  revive  the  bonds  [13].  Difficulties  in
expressing grief can cause psychological problems. These
difficulties  are  accentuated  when  migration  is  accom-
plished  under  adverse  conditions.  The  reception  in  the
new  country  is  crucial  for  the  complete  and  successful
elaboration of the grief process.

In the case of refugees, who have to flee their country for
fear  of  being  persecuted,  the  grief  process  is  more  com-
plex. There is the fact that they can not go back to their
country of origin, so that their grief is, in this case, closer
to the experience of loss, than to that of separation. War-
related experiences and occupational status before migra-
tion  have  been  proved  to  be  risks  factors for psychiatric
symptoms among Somali refugees living in the UK [14].
As for every immigrant, the post-migration environment
has been proved to have a considerable influence regard-
less of prior traumatic exposures, being the level of affec-
tive social support in exile an important determinant of
the severity of possible disorders [15].

As a diagnosed condition Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) is by far the most common mental health prob-
lem among refugees and asylum seekers [16], followed by
mood disorders. According to the Medical Foundation in
the UK, the range of psychological problems experienced
by  torture  survivors  can  include:  nightmares,  hallucina-
tions, panic attacks, sexual problems, phobias, difficulty
in trusting others and forming relationships and depres-
sive illness or anxiety [16].

A study carried out in Portugal with asylum seekers and
refugees found that principal sources of stress of this pop-
ulation were connected to traumatic or harrowing experi-
ences  in  the  country  of  origin  due to political  or  family

reasons,  problems  of  communication  (language),  legal
status and work.

In  Spain,  researches  [17-19]  have  been  carried  out  on
mental and psychosomatic disorders in immigrant popu-
lations. These researches found the following factors asso-
ciated  with  the  immigrants'  mental  health:  labour  and
economic instability, cultural and social marginalisation,
family  estrangement,  pressures  to  send  money  to  their
families, racial discrimination and lack of statutory docu-
mentation [20].

In spite of these considerations, which seem to evidence
that it is impossible to consider "migrants" as a homoge-
neous group concerning the risk for mental illness accord-
ing  to  Murphy's  hypothesis  [21],  many  studies  seem  to
confirm that not a generalized psychopathological risk is
present  among  emigrants.  In  this  sense,  psychosocial
studies  should  be  undertaken  to  identify  those  factors
which  may,  under  given  conditions,  imply  an  increased
risk of psychiatric disorders and influence seeking for psy-
chiatric care [22]. Specific migrant situations may be eval-
uated, concerning psychopathological risk and seeking for
psychiatric  care,  in  order  to  variables  as:  motivation  to
migrations  (see  Rack  work  subdividing  settler,  refugees,
gastarbeiters, [23]; distance for the host culture (religion,
language, and so); ability to develop mediating structures
[24]; legal residential status.

The Chronic and Multiple Stress Syndrome (Ulysses 
syndrome)
The  particularly  hard  conditions  of  today's  migration
seem to be propitiating a worsen in the mental health of
the  newcomers.  Current  situations  are  making  of  the
migratory experience, an extremely hard and unbearable
process. Thousands of people are emigrating and suffering
levels of stress, in some cases, inhuman. Examples of this,
it's the situation given in the South of Europe particularly
Spain and Italy, where in recent years, the coasts of Sar-
dinia, Sicily, Southern Spain and the Canary Archipelago
have  registered  a  massive  arrival  of  small,  fragile  crafts
which hundreds of Africans use to get into European ter-
ritory putting their lives in danger [20].

Psychiatrists  from  the  Psycho-pathological  and  Psycho-
social Assistance Service (SAPPIR) team, located in Barce-
lona,  have  described  the  common  symptoms  that  most
immigrants present when attending the centre and have
called  it  Chronic  and  Multiple  Stress  Syndrome  in  immi-
grants  (or  Ulysses  syndrome),  relating  the  risky  and  hard
journey that the immigrants pursue in search of a better
life with the odyssey of the mythical Greek character in his
long  voyage  through  the  Mediterranean.  Immigrants
affected by this syndrome present depressive symptoma-
tology  with  atypical  characteristics,  where  depressive

symptoms are mixed with anxious, somatoform and dis-
sociative symptoms [13]. The development of this condi-
tion occurs progressively as the immigrant encounters the
obstacles  that  take  place  during  the  migration  process:
dangerous journey, distance from their own environment
and family,  difficulties to find a  job, food, housing  and
obtain documents, and the racism suffered in the recep-
tion  country.  The  psychiatrist's  team  propose  that  the
'Chronic and Multiple Stress Syndrome' should constitute an
autonomous category situated in between adjustment dis-
orders and Posttraumatic stress disorder [13].

The growing incidence of this syndrome in many psychi-
atrist  and  psychological  services  across  Europe  have
alerted a group of social scientists and health care profes-
sionals  from  different  countries,  who  have  addressed  to
the EU Parliament, in order to make an urgent call about
the situation which it has been worsening during last five
years [8].

3. Epidemiological studies
The first epidemiological evaluations of psychiatric disor-
ders in immigrants date back to more than seventy years
ago [25]. However, the results obtained  in these  studies
were somewhat limited due to a number of methodolog-
ical  problems  which  have  only  recently  been  overcome
thanks to the introduction of standardized diagnostic cri-
teria and structured interviews and to investigations being
carried  out  on  the  general  population  and  not  only  on
subjects who had been seen by health professionals [26].

Even  so,  currently  in  Europe  epidemiological  studies
which offer information on mental health status of immi-
grants  are  still  very  scant.  Most  studies  carried  out  until
nowadays are clinical and mostly limited to private med-
ical practices,  as  epidemiological  research  offers  by  now
little information. These clinical studies have some limita-
tions due to the use of small and, frequently, biased sam-
ples.

There is little data at our disposal with regard to the level
of psychic and physical health among those who are cul-
turally different owing to inadequate systems of registra-
tion (e.g. lack of the 'nationality' variable). These systems
have recently started to be modified in some countries in
order to provide soon with useful data on the health pro-
file of the newcomers.

Nevertheless,  some  epidemiological  studies  do  exist
although  its  distribution  across  UE  countries  is  very
patchy. For example, while in some countries such as the
United Kingdom, Netherlands and Sweden there are some
data  concerning  the  mental  health  status  of  immigrants
(including in this group asylum seekers and refugees), in
Belgium  there  are  no  nationwide  or  regional  epidemio-

logical  studies  available  on  immigrants,  as  neither,  for
example, in Spain or Portugal.

The following review – clustered by countries – underline
the different trend of research at present time in evolution
in each European country. Some topics as drug consump-
tion in immigrated people and psychiatric health in refu-
gees  were  summarized  in  a  transnational  way.  Some  of
these studies were highlighted in the Council of Europe's
report  on  Health  Conditions  of  migrants  and  refugees  in
Europe [27]. The more relevant research concerning Refu-
gees  from  Balkans  was  from  USA  (Harvard  programme
from  refugees),  it  was  summarized  considering  the  rele-
vance of this health problem for the European Union.

- United Kingdom
(cid:127) Hospital admission rates for schizophrenia are highest
for  people  with  of  Caribbean,  Irish  and  Polish  back-
ground [28-32] with special high incidence in 16–29 year
old  people  of  Caribbean  background.  Also  higher  rates
than the indigenous are found in people from Indian and
Pakistan. Two studies collecting rates of first onset schizo-
phrenia were recently carried out in Trinidad and London
[33], the results confirm that sending countries have low
rates of schizophrenia. Author indicates that the impact of
migration itself produces high stress but rates of schizo-
phrenia are even higher in the second generation, suggest-
ing  that  other  social  factors  may  be  responsible  for  the
increase. Social factors and genetic vulnerability may play
a role considering that only sub groups of migrants show
higher rates of psychosis. A review of the literature about
seventeen  population  based  studies  [34]  proposed  that
the developmental task for formulating the life plan chal-
lenges  the  young  adult's  executive  function  abilities,
which may be weaker in individuals vulnerable to schizo-
phrenia. Formulating the life plan may be made more dif-
ficult by the position of disadvantaged ethnic minorities,
raising  the  risk  for  schizophrenia.  A  more  recent  review
[35] indicates that African-Caribbean population in Eng-
land is at increased risk of both schizophrenia and mania
and the excess of the two psychotic disorders are probably
linked:  African-Caribbean  patients  with  schizophrenia
show  more  affective  symptoms,  and  more  relapsing
course  with  greater  social  disruption  but  fewer  chronic
negative symptoms, than White patients.

(cid:127)  Suicide  rates  of  young  women  immigrants  from  the
Indian subcontinent are consistently higher than those of
their male counterparts and of young women in the indig-
enous populations of the countries to which they immi-
to  be  a
grated 
precipitating factor in many suicides, whereas mental ill-
ness  is  rarely  cited  as  a  cause.  Depression,  Anxiety  and
domestic  violence  may  contribute  to  the  high  rates.

Authors suggest that affective disorders may be underdiag-
nosed in this population.

(cid:127) The issue concerning the lower rate of recognized men-
tal disorders in women of Indian origin was addressed by
a survey of Jacob and coll. carried out in a general practice
setting in West London [38]. Common mental disorders
were  documented  in  30%  of  patients  (similar  in  Indian
women  to  those  in  other  UK  populations),  individuals
with common mental disorders had a higher frequency of
consultation, were less likely to see depression as an indi-
cator  for  medical  intervention  and  were  more  likely  to
withhold some of their concerns from the general practi-
tioner (GP). Incorrect diagnosis by the GP was most likely
to  occur  when  patients  did  not  disclose  all  their  com-
plaints. Authors conclude that differing conceptualisation
of  common  mental  disorders  may  contribute  to  their
under-recognition  in  women  of  Indian  origin.  A  recent
survey  examined  the  contribution  of  Asian  ethnicity  in
rates of practice prescribing for antidepressant and anxio-
lytics medication in 164 general practices in East London
[39]. Results indicate that where the proportion of Asian
patients is high, both antidepressants and anxiolytics pre-
scribing is low. The study confirms that the putative low
rates of non-psychotic disorders attribute to Asian popu-
lation is not a selective feature of access to secondary care
but uncertainty remains as the low rate of antidepressants
and anxiolytics prescription of GP may be due to a lower
prevalence  rate,  or  to  "culture-bound  syndromes"  or  to
practical difficulties in diagnosis and management within
the general practice setting.

(cid:127)  The  alcohol  abuse  among  people  of  Indian  descent  is
reflected in rates of cirrhosis-related mortality, which are
twice  as  high  as  among  English  males  [40].  Drug  abuse
has also been reported as a problem [41].

- The Netherlands
(cid:127) According to UK studies a series of researches conducted
in  the  Netherlands  indicate  that  the  incidence  [42]  and
point prevalence [43] of schizophrenia is increased in sev-
eral  (Morocco,  Suriname  and  Netherlands  Antilles)  but
not  all  (Turkish  and  Western  countries)  immigrants
groups.  The  relative  risk  of  schizophrenia  in  Suriname
born immigrants against Suriname resident born popula-
tion  was  1.46  [42].  Authors  conclusion  is  that  selective
migration  according  to  Odegaard's  selection  hypothesis
cannot solely explain the higher incidence of schizophre-
nia in Surinamese immigrants to the Netherlands.

(cid:127)  Drug  abuse  related  schizophrenia  together  with  psy-
chotic diseases was found not uncommon among some
migrant groups [44], especially migrants from Suriname
and the Antilles. It has been suggested as an explanation
for  the  increased  incidence  of  psychosis  among  some

immigrant  groups.  A  recent  population-based,  first  con-
tact incidence study found misused of illicit substance in:
23% of Dutch, 17% of Moroccans, 27% of Surinames and
30% of Turkish. These results seem to suggest that a higher
rate  of  drug  misuse  is  an  unlikely  explanation  for  the
increased incidence of psychotic disorders among Moroc-
can and Surinamese immigrants in the Netherlands [45].

(cid:127)  In  a  country  where  the  unemployment  rate  among
migrants was almost three times that of the nationals in
1994, the suicide rate among children of immigrants was
considerably higher than that of the national population
[46].

(cid:127) A recent study carried out in randomly selected sample
of Turkish immigrants, found a prevalence rate of "minor"
psychiatric disorders (33.4%, 36.1% in females, 27.9% in
males), higher than those normally found in community
based samples. The results suggest that the expression of
somatic complaints around "tightness" should alert phy-
sicians to further explore symptoms of minor psychiatric
disorders  and  to  examine  sources  of  distress  stemming
from  the  partner  relationship,  the  family,  the  work  and
from the poor housing and financial conditions [47].

(cid:127) A study on service utilisation in women immigrants in
Amsterdam  found  that  Surinamese,  Antillean,  Turkish
and  Moroccan  women  made  considerably  less  use  of
mental  health  care  services  than  native  born  women.
Immigrant women consulted, on the contrary, social work
facilities and women crisis intervention centres nearly 1.5
times more than mental health care services [48]. Explor-
ing the reason for the ethnic difference in services utilisa-
tion  authors  conclude  that  cultural  and  socioeconomic
factors  are  largely  responsible  of  such  a  difference.  The
results imply that a care policy may improve the accessi-
bility  of  mental  health  services  for  immigrant  women.
They  also  suggest  to  employ  more  ethnic  and  bilingual
care  providers.  Cultural  barriers  in  detecting  problem
behaviour in children was explored by a study of Crijnen
and colleagues [49]. Turkish immigrant teachers reported
high levels of anxiety and depression in immigrant Turk-
ish children which go largely undetected by their Dutch
teachers.

(cid:127)  A  community  survey  using  the  standardised  clinical
interview  Present  State  Examination  [24,50]  demon-
strated that Senegaleses travelling salesmen living in Sar-
dinia, whose working conditions facilitate a community
lifestyle, do not appear to be at risk for depression when
compared  to  Sardinian  controls.  Unexpectedly,  higher
rates  of  anxiety  and  depressive  disorders  were  shown  in
the few fellow-countrymen who had managed to obtain a
steady job with regular wages. In the latter case, the onset

of  psychopathological  disorders  was  closely  associated
with the loss of contact with fellow-countrymen. A sample
of Moroccan emigrants employed in similar occupations
was characterised by a higher risk respect to a population
of  Senegalese  salesmen,  and  an  increased  incidence  of
psychopathological episodes in the six months following
their arrival in Sardinia. The authors argued how elements
of cultural cohesion such as those represented by the asso-
ciations of Islamic confraternities may exert strong protec-

(cid:127) A study evaluated the frequency of ICD-10 psychiatric
disorders in a community sample of subjects of Sardinian
origin  resident  in  Paris.  Results  were  compared  to  data
obtained  from  a  sample  of  the  general  Parisian  popula-
tion and from a sample of Sardinians resident in Sardinia
[51]. Migration was shown to be associated with a higher
risk  both  of  anxiety  (as  people  living  in  Sardinia)  and
depressive  disorders  in  the  young  people  (as  Parisians).
The young emigrants and the children of emigrants (2nd
generation  emigrants)  seem  to  be  prone  to  drug-abuse
and bulimia. The presence of a confidential relationship
appears to have a protective effect as shown by the much
higher incidence of depression in emigrants who are wid-
owed, separated or live alone. This suggests the need for
support strategies.

(cid:127) Elderly Sardinian residents who had experienced migra-
tion  are  characterised  by  an  increased  risk  of  dysthymia
[52]. The problems of adjustment of the return migrant,
particularly  in  the  elderly  is  presented  in  some  Italian
papers [53,54]. The focus is on immigration from south-
ern Europe and Turkey toward northern European coun-
tries and on progressive aging of people migrated in the
50s and 60s. Authors affirmed that little is known about
the health of migrants once they return to their country of
origin but the issue represents a very relevant health prob-
lem. A recent community survey found a higher frequency
of  depressive  disorders  in  the  Sardinian  immigrants  in
Argentina [55]. Female (not male) showed a higher risk in
respect to Sardinians resident in Sardinia. Results seem to
suggest  that  previous  emigration  in  a  country  that
decreased dramatically their economical level may predis-
pose  subjects  for  depressivedisorders  comparing  with
their  native  population  and  with  subjects  migrated  in
countries more economically advantaged because the life-
time  rate  of  depressive  episodes  in  the  Sardinian  immi-
grants  in  Paris,  as  reported  in  a  previous  above  cited
research,  was  lower  than  in  Sardinian  immigrants  in
Argentina.  The  study  suggests  the  need  of  systematic
researchers and support for European citizen migrated to
south  America  and  other  economically  disadvantaged
countries.

- Germany
(cid:127) Hansen and coll. [56] attempt to evaluate if the elevated
rate of schizophrenia among migrants has been explained
in part by possible misdiagnosis measuring the extend of
misdiagnosis among Turkish immigrant patients and Ger-
man controls. Three investigators (a researcher of Turkish
origin,  a  German  researcher  and  a  clinician)  evaluated
independently two sample of patients one of Turkish an
one of German origin. The rate of potential misdiagnosis
was higher among migrant, yet not strongly correlated to
poor secondary language proficiency. The same research
group [57] found in a Turkish of schizophrenic patients a
higher rate of depression and hostile excitement than in
German  schizophrenic  patients.  Authors  say  that  such  a
figure may be mainly due to diagnostic differences.

(cid:127) To solve the problems of language and culture barriers
that  raise  problems  for  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic
process, Grube developed a bilingual setting by integrat-
ing a Turkish psychologist who belongs to a counselling
centre into a therapeutic team [58]. Comparing outcome
measures in Turkish patient against non Turkish migrants
as  controls,  results  showed  shorter  periods  of  hospital
treatment for Turkish non-schizophrenic in-patients and
Turkish  schizophrenic  patients  achieve  higher  level  of
rehabilitation. Turkish patients with all kinds of psychiat-
ric diagnoses showed lower ratios of readmission.

(cid:127) A study on psychiatric inpatient in Frankfurt a.M. found
suicidal  attempts  more  frequent  among  the  Mediterra-
nean girls than among their German counterparts [59].

- Sweden and Scandinavian countries
(cid:127)  The  issue  about  increasing  risk  for  schizophrenia  and
severe mental disorders in immigrants was studied by sev-
eral Nordic authors. Hjern and coll [60] found in one of
the first longitudinal studies analysing incidence rates of
first hospital admission, that five and second generation
immigrants  have  an  increased  risk  for  severe  psychiatric
disorders  compared  to  natives.  The  highest  risks  were
found in Finnish first-generation immigrants. First gener-
ation immigrants from refugee countries have lower risk
for alcohol or substance abuse than natives. However the
risk  in  second  second-generation  refugees  is  significant
higher than in natives. First generation immigrants from
refugee countries have the same risk for schizophrenia as
native  while  the  risk  in  second  generation  refugees  is
higher than in natives. A complex model integrating both
the "Goalstriving stress hypothesis" (the level of psycho-
logical stress which derived from a discordance between
the goals to be reached and the degree of aspiration) [61]
and the cited hypothesis of Eaton and Harrison (concern-
ing  executive  function  abilities  and  developmental  task
for  formulating  the  life  plan  challenges  which  may  be
weaker  in  individuals  vulnerable  to  schizophrenia  and

which may be made more difficult by the position of dis-
advantaged  ethnic  minorities,  raising  the  risk  of  schizo-
phrenia) [34] may be taken in account. The role of ethnic
factors  in  the  risk  of  schizophrenia  was  underlined  in  a
study  carried  out  in  Malmo  [62].  This  work  confirmed
that compared with those who were native-born, migrants
had  increased  risk  for  Schizophrenia  like  psychosis.  But
the risk was most markedly increased in immigrants from
East Africa. On the contrary background factors as extreme
duress of migration did not appear contribute strongly to
increasing risk.

(cid:127) Also data from Danish Civil Registration System seem to
confirm  the  association  between  migration  and  schizo-
phrenia both in immigrants to Denmark and among Dan-
ish with a history of foreign residence.

(cid:127) A paper explored structures of illness meaning among
somatizing-Turkish-born migrant women living an a poor
and low status suburb of Stockholm [63]. Migrants com-
municated distress by concrete expression about the body,
emotion,  social  and  life  situation.  Pain  was  prominent
and often lateralised to one side of the body. The use of
traditional expression of distress ranged from open use of
avoidance.  Attribution  wascharacterised  by  verbalising
links of coherence between health and aspect of life. Psy-
chiatric attribution was rarely accepted or valued as tool
for recovery, or as helpful in linking bodily symptoms to
emotional distress. The results of this study point out the
mutual need of exploring meaning in the clinical encoun-
tered  to  help  patients,  particularly  migrant,  make  sense
out of different perspectives of illness and healing.

(cid:127)  Compared  with  Swedish  immigrant  from  Iran,  Chile,
Turkey, Poland Kurdistan (but for this group differences
being  not  significant)  had  an  increased  risk  of  self
reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of
psychotropic drugs. Living alone, poor knowledge of the
Swedish  language,  non  employment,  and  low  sense  of
coherence  were  strong  risk  factor  for  self  reported  long-
standing  psychiatric  illness  and  for  intake  psychotropic
drugs [64]. Country of birth was a significant risk for poor
self  reported  health  and  psychosomatic  complaints  in
women of reproductive age in Sweden. Swedish born (but
not Finnish) women and female refugees reported more
psychosomatic  complaints  in  the  90s  than  in  80s  [65].
Similarly  to  the  cited  study  on  Sardinian  immigrants  to
Paris,  the  results  do  not  appear  to  confirm  the  clinical
findings of "somatization" as a privileged "psychopatho-
logical  course"  in  latin  immigrants  reported  in  the  past
[66].

(cid:127) The alcohol related disorders in immigrants was studied
by a register based work on a national cohort of 1.25 mil-
lion  youth  born  68–79  and  1.5  million  of  adults  born

1929–65  [67].  First  and  second  generation  immigrants
from  Finland  (but  not  from  Southern  and  middle  East
Europe and non European countries) had a higher relative
risk for hospital admission because of an alcohol related
disorder  compared  to  the  Swedish  population.  Authors
say that patterns of alcohol abuse in the country of origin
are  strong  determinants  of  alcohol  related  disorders  in
first generation immigrants. The patterns in second gener-
ation immigrants are influenced by parental countries of
origin as well as pattern in the majority of population. The
Finnish minority and intercountry adoptees are of partic-
ular  concern  in  prevention.  Intecountry  adoptees  have
also a high risk for severe mental health problems, suicide
and suicide attempts [68].

(cid:127) A registry study in the county of Copenhagen indicated
an excess of Mental Retardation in children from ethnic
minorities. The cause are not known and not are aetiolog-
ical factors for Mental Retardation for a great part of the
children.  Consanguinity  is  likely  to  be  a  risk  factor  for
Mental Retardation [69].

- Spain
(cid:127)  Excluding  the  data  from  obstetrics  and  paediatrics,
depressive  disorders  were  the  second  cause  of  medical
consultations in "undocumented" immigrants in the dis-
trict of Usera-Villaverde, Madrid [70]. In a random sample
of  immigrant  psychiatric  patients,  depression  was  more
frequent  than  in  the  control  group  of  native  psychiatric
patients, and alcohol abuse less frequent [71]. Among the
clinical  studies  carried  out  in  Spain,  there  is  the  annual
report of the SAPPIR (Psycho-patological and Psychoso-
cial assistance service for immigrants). The centre focuses
its research by symptoms instead of diagnosis. This is due
to the fact that in most cultures of origin of immigrants
who  visit  the  service,  emotion  is  expressed  through  the
body,  but  without  alexithymia.  This  approach,  which
integrates mind and body, favours that depressive symp-
tomatology come along with/is accompanied by somatic
symptomatology.  According  to  SAPPIR's  research  find-
ings, the most frequent symptomatology in immigrants is
the triad insomnia – fatigue – migraine [72].

- Belgium
(cid:127)  Findings  of  a  study  carried  out  in  Brussels  [73]  con-
formed increased incidence of psychosis in second gener-
ation Moroccan immigrants to Belgium.

- France
(cid:127)  French  papers  on  migration  studied  more  frequently
descriptive psychopathology about interpretative psychol-
ogy than epidemiology. Several authors who had studied
the emigration of Islamic populations in France, indicated
how many individuals were affected by a certain degree of
conflict respect to their migrant situation, with particular

concern  for  the  dispositions  laid  down  by  the  Koran
which prohibit leaving the country of origin for non-reli-
gious reasons [74]. Problems and conflicts concerning the
failure of integration of Moslem French immigrants, par-
ticularly Algerians who chose French nationality in 1962,
has been taken up in 50 case histories reported by Pouget
and coll. [75].

(cid:127) More recently two cross-sectional studies on perceived
health were performed in the Comoro Island and in South
Eastern of Marseille. Immigrants in Marseille have higher
perceived  health  status  than  those  living  in  Comoro
Islands for the dimension of physical, mental and general
health. The perceived health score level of migrated peo-
ple is closed to those reported in France [76].

- Ireland
(cid:127)  Ireland  became  only  recently  a  destination  for  migra-
tion, thus studies about immigration are still rare. One of
the last report about emigration for Ireland, studying atti-
tudes  toward  emigration  found  men  who  contemplated
emigration  reporting  higher  self-esteem  scores,  and
women  contemplating  emigration  reporting  lower  self
esteem scores. Women who contemplated emigration had
higher depression scores than women who did not con-
template  emigration.  This  pattern  was  not  evident  for
men.  The  results  indicate  that  psychologically  women
view the prospect of emigration less positively than men
[77].

(cid:127) These different attitudes toward emigration in men and
women suggest a heuristic hypothesis explaining the dif-
ferent risk in migration (gender determined) shown in the
above mentioned Sardinian studies. That hypothesis can
be taken into account if similar attitudes will be demon-
strated in another catholic but Mediterranean culture. The
study on Sardinian immigrants in Argentina suggests that
emigration to a country which subsequently suffers dra-
matic economic problems may increase risk for depressive
disorders  (but  only  in  women)  which  are  not  found  in
emigrants to economically stable countries. In the survey
on Sardinian immigrants in Paris, only the lifetime rate of
Depressive Episode in young men immigrants in Paris was
higher  than  the  lifetime  rate  of  Depressive  Episode  in
young men Sardinian resident in Sardinia.

(cid:127) It is very important to underline the two different dia-
metrically  opposite  economic  conditions  in  which  the
two migratory waves occurred between Paris and Argen-
tina. Paris offered successful work opportunities but also
a new world based on competition. Even though France is
closer to Sardinia than Argentina there was a risk, specially
for young people, to lose their traditions and family ties
[78].

(cid:127) The hypothesis that arises from the data analysis of the
Sardinian and Irish study is that migrated women, with a
possible more frequent "depressive" coherent interpreta-
tion of self and knowledge [79] may be higher involved
during difficult situations when the family safety is under
the threat of economical instability. Men may be more at
risk in situations of rapid improvement where the com-
petitive  challenge  becomes  pressing  as  the  risk  of  "goal
striving stress" [61].

(cid:127) The hypothesis of men sensitivity to goal striving stress
may be applied to understand the way Ireland with best
European  economic  performance  during  the  period
1980–2000  (the  only  European  country  with  both
increased  mean  income  and  decreased  unemployment
rate) present a suicide male increase around 130%. Dur-
ing the last twenty years period suicides decreased in all
Europe but not in the Irish men, instead, the Irish female
suicide rate decreased.

(cid:127)  Consistent  with  constructivist  cognitive  concepts
[79,80], a "depressive style of knowledge" would imply a
system  whereby  the  individual  explicitly  attempts  to
maintain a coherent image through application of a the-
ory  which  contemplates  a  pessimistic  view  of  the  world
and the future, assuming a sort of "defeat-oriented hyper-
responsibility", tacitly challenging the losses experienced.

(cid:127) Paradoxically depressive attitudes, in face to stress con-
ditions of social change may exert a protective factor if the
"compulsive  self-responsibilisation"  towards  the  newly-
originated  socially  successful  opportunities  may  modu-
late the search of new roles which are able to provide sub-
jects  with  an  adequate  income  and  with  a  sense  of
leadership  whilst  at  the  same  time  to  maintain  a  role
which is more socially accepted and which is perceived as
being more "traditional". Several interesting lines of psy-
chosocial research have in fact hypothesised that the cul-
tural  transmission  tends  to  be  perpetuated  when  the
particular cultural institutions (in this case the social role)
are perceived by the individual (and by the other mem-
bers of the group) as an integral part of the evolving self,
but which at the same time, are able to meet new needs
and  requirements  [81].  The  latter  hypothesis  was  elici-
tated to explain the absence of conflicts and the lower risk
for depression in a sample of women employed as nurses
(a innovative role but that preserve traditional roles) in an
African society in rapid change [82].

- Portugal
(cid:127)  Literature  on  immigration  in  Portugal  is  at  present
inconsistent. Most international papers are still interested
in  immigration  from  Portugal.  The  study  of  Ferron  and
Coll. in Switzerland [83] found in labour migrant adoles-
cents  (from  Portugal,  Spain,  Italy,  Turkey  and  former

behaviour and substance abuse) than Swiss counterpart.

nosis  of  schizophrenia  in  migrants,  authors  think  that
hebephrenic schizophrenia in migrants may besometimes
misdiagnosed as chronic depressive status due to cultural
barriers.

(cid:127) An example of an interdisciplinary approach to provide
a  framework  for  understanding  and  promote  mental
health in the context of cultural diversity in a Canadian
perspective  for  Portuguese  immigrant  is  presented  in  a
paper from James and Prilleltensky [84]. The framework is
not only limited to assessing the needs of individual but
draws on anthropology, philosophy, political science, and
religious studies to understand the social, cultural, moral,
and  religious  domains.  The  need  for  observation  in  the
specific  group  ethnic  model  predicting  depression  in
immigrant women (with specific attention to Portuguese)
in  an  a  flexible,  individualized  approach  to  ethnic
women's  psychology  health  care  is  suggested  by  Franks
and Faux in their Ontario Study [85].

- Greece
(cid:127) More than ten years ago a series of very relevant papers
appears in the international literature about immigration
from  Greece.  Literature  on  immigration  in  Greek  is  at
present inconsistent. The work from Mavreas VR and Beb-
bington PE [86] shows that the rates of psychiatric disor-
ders in two Greek sample (one of which of Greek Cipriots
living in Camberwell, London and the other one living in
Athens) were somewhat higher than those of the Camber-
well population. Greeks reported more symptoms of gen-
eral anxiety  disorders.  This  is  consistent  with the  results
others  researches  and  with  the  Sardinian  immigration
studies in which a higher frequency of anxiety disorders in
the Sardinian sample and of depressive disorders among
Parisians was observed. Mavreas and Bebbington suggest
a  greater  risk  of  anxiety  disorders  in  southern  and  of
depression in northern European countries.

(cid:127) A paper from Fitcher and coll. [87] found significantly
higher GHQ-28 scores for Greeks and Turks adolescents in
their  homeland  as  compared  to  Greek  adolescent  in
Munich. Results seems do not confirm the acculturation
stress hypothesis.

- Austria
(cid:127) A paper describes the behaviour disturbance and emo-
tional  problems  of  Turkish  immigrant  and  Austria  chil-
dren  aged  9  to  13  years  living  in  Vienna,  rated  by  their
parents  and  both  by  Turkish  and  German  teachers.  The
prevalence of behaviour problems did not differ between
the Turkish and Austrian children [88].

(cid:127)  A  paper  presented  at  the  DTGPP  Satellite  Conference,
Ethnicity  &  Mental  Health  in  Europe,  Essen  Germany,
September 2003 [89] deals with the issue of the misdiag-

- Drug abuse
(cid:127) Reports to investigate the reasons for drug abuse among
immigrant youth have been carried out in Sweden [90],
France [91-94] and Germany [95] coming up with similar
conclusions which suggest that drug abuse was a conse-
quence of difficult social integration. A 1996 WHO report
noted that the consumption of tranquillisers and antide-
pressants by young immigrants across Europe is growing.
Alcohol abuse is also reported as an important problem
among immigrants population in Europe.

(cid:127) A recent review of the literature underlined that the asso-
ciation between migration and addiction is very heteroge-
neous.  More  or  less  drug  and  alcohol  dependence  than
native population have been reported in different migra-
tion  phenomena  across  the  world  [96]  As  suggested  in
some above cited studies on alcohol abuse, but probably
not  with  the  same  strong  association,  patterns  of  addic-
tion  abuse  in  the  country  of  origin  are  determinants  of
alcohol  related  disorders  in  first  generation  immigrants.
The  author  of  the  cited  lecture  indicates,  in  spite  of  the
chief  role  of  migration  drug  problems  in  public  debate
and concern, a lack data about alcohol dependence in the
migration population in Europe. The report of the Euro-
pean Union Strategy on Drugs 2000–2004 has no men-
tions  or  suggestions  of  these  specific  problems  in  any
European Union country.

- Refugees and mental health
(cid:127) Recent surveys have shown that two thirds of refugees
experience anxiety and/or depression [97].

(cid:127) Refugees have a high incidence of post traumatic stress
disorder,  depression,  anxiety,  panic  disorder  and  agora-
phobia [98].

(cid:127)  Shortages  of  food,  being  lost  in  war  situation,  being
close  to  death  and  suffering  serious  injury  were  each
related to specific psychiatric symptoms in a community
sample of adult Somali refugees [14].

(cid:127) A relevant work on psychiatric disorders on Bosnian ref-
ugees was performed by the Harvard USA program in Ref-
ugee  Trauma  [99,100]  The  initial  study  reported  a  high
rate of disabling depression and post traumatic stress dis-
order among refugees. Bosnian Refugees followed up ini-
tially found asylum in Croatia in 1996 and now returning
in  Bosnia  or  remained  in  the  Balkans  (70.4%9)  or
migrated in European Union or USA (21.3%), the others
had died (21.3%) or were lost to follow-up [100]. Nearly

50% former Bosnian refugees who remained living in the
Balkan area still present psychiatric symptoms and disa-
bility  3  years  after  initial  assessment.  Depression  was
unremitting,  disabling,  and  potentially  associated  with
premature death in the elderly. About 20% of those did
not have symptoms of psychiatric disorder at starting time
had symptoms at follow-up. Depressed refugees had three
times the risk of dying than non depressed. Refugees who
emigrated  were  more  traumatised,  better  educated  and
had  fewer  health  and  mental  health  problems  than  the
majority who remained in the region.

(cid:127) A recent lecture [46] on global risk and protective factors
in the  development  of  mental disorders  in  refugees  cut-
ting across lines of social class and cultural identity, ana-
lysing a community based study on Iraqui refugees in The
Netherlands,  suggests  that  a  long  asylum  procedure  is
associated  with  psychiatric  disorders.  And  indicates  that
both  policy  makers  and  mental  health  workers  should
take note of this findings.

ESEMeD
The recent Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders
– ESEMeD, a survey carried out in six European countries
(France,  Belgium,  Italy,  Spain,  The  Netherlands,  Ger-
many),  could  mean  an  important  contribution  for  the
study of epidemiology of mental disorders in immigrants
living in Europe. The ESEMeD's sample consisted in a ran-
dom  selection  of  21.425  individuals  from  the  general
population  aged  18  or  older  and  non-institutionalised.
This sample comprises a 6.03% (6.58%weighted) of for-
eign individuals. The study will provide us with highly rel-
evant 
and
comorbidity of mental disorders, and patterns of service
utilization of these populations.

information 

concerning 

prevalence 

The recent Report "The State of Mental Health in Europe"
[101]  compared  the  ESEMED  findings  for  psychological
distress, as measured by the SF-12 questionnaire, for peo-
ple who were born in the country compared to those who
not born in the country. Because of the way the sample
were designed, it was not possible to compare those born
in the country with those not born in the country for Italy.
The country ratios (risk of distress in immigrants against
natives) were: 1.0 in Belgium, 1.2 in The Netherlands, 1.4
in Spain, 4.3 in Germany, 4.7 in France.

4. Health policy toward immigrants: access to 
health care services
Despite  in  the  migrants  groups  vulnerable  populations
were identified with respect to health problems, in many
European  countries  there  are  migrants  who  fall  outside
the existing health and social services, something which is
particularly  true  for  asylum  seekers  and  undocumented
immigrants (due to the fact that most asylum applications

are  refused,  the  division  line  between  both  situations  is
very small). They are usually only entitled to emergency
health services.

For  example,  exclusionary  policies  in  relationship  of
access to health services on behalf of asylum seekers have
been documented in France, where limitations in access
were found for those asylum seekers who are not granted
a work permit, even if they can't work due to ill health or
language barriers [102].

In spite of some states efforts to universalise the right to
access  national  health  care  services,  therefore  including
undocumented  migrants  there  exist  an  important  lack
between  rights  and  accessibility  [20].  Undocumented
immigrants may not access health care services for causes
such as administrative obstacles or fear of being reported
to the police. This action is not in practice nowadays in
most  countries,  but  nevertheless  certain  evidence  of  it
exists. According to the study Easy Scapegoats: Sans Papier
immigrants in Europe [103], the German Law of Foreign-
ers  obligates  public  institutions  to  denounce  undocu-
mented people to the Office of Foreigner's Affairs. Some
hospitals have informed the police while treating undoc-
umented immigrants.

Other  obstacles  immigrants  in  general  may  find  when
attempting to seek for health care in European countries
despite their legal situation are the lack of adequate infor-
mation about the available health care facilities and com-
munication (language) problems. Moreover, in the case of
psychological problems, it may result an obstacle the fact
that mental health problems may lead to stigmatisation of
that group.

Nevertheless, the health care gaps that are being left by the
authorities are being covered by the informal work of doc-
tors  at  the  health  system  and  by  NGO's,  which  provide
with  medical  and,  specially,  mental  health  assistance
together with health promotion and prevention programs
among other services.

5. State of the art in Mental Health Care 
provision
Researches in the field of access to care deal with subjec-
tive and objective barriers. The objective barriers either lie
in the domain of the available information, the structure
of  the  health  care  system,  as  well  as  the  availability  of
treatment modalities. The subjective barriers lie either on
the  side  of  affected  person,  the  treatment  professionals
orhealth  care  planners.  Ethnic  minority  groups,  particu-
larly migrants, are faced with several potential barriers in
the  access  of  care,  resulting  in  a  lower  representation in
mental health services [56].

Taking the above into account, an examination of studies
of mental  health services for  migrants groups in Europe
shows that quality and availability of this provision is very
patchy between countries. For example, a mapping exer-
cise of mental health care in Europe carried out by Watters
[104]  suggested  a  serious  absence  of  mental  health  care
for migrants in Central and Eastern Europe, something of
great  importance  if  we  take  into  account  the  rapid  eco-
nomic and social changes affecting these regions [104].

If well it is true that some countries of Northern Europe
have  a  major  and  longer  experience  in  this realm,  Fern-
ando [106] stresses the necessity of urgent change in the
training  of  professionals,  the  way  mental  health  assess-
ments  are  made  and  the  narrow  eurocentric  nature  of
therapy. It has been reported that, in many cases, psycho-
social problems can mislead the health care staff who are
not familiar with the process and impact of migration on
psychological health [107].

Delivering  of  specific  mental  health  care  services  for
migrants  is  integrated  into  mainstream  mental  health
services, who provide the majority of these, in some coun-
tries  (Netherlands,  United  Kingdom)  even  though  there
exist parallelly specific community services mainly funded
by the government. In other countries, these specific com-
munity services and NGOs are the main providers of men-
tal  health  services  for  these  groups  while  the  national
health  system  adapts  to  the  new  health  needs  in  a  very
slow manner (Spain, Portugal). Nevertheless, even those
countries with a longer experience of migration and where
the bulk of mental health services are being provided by
the statutory sector, denounce the weakness of this provi-
sion. Most important weaknesses are reported next.

On  the  other  hand,  there  exists  a  big  demand  for  the
assistance of interpreters or health agents – who are under
utilised – so that migrants are not force to rely on friends
and  family  members  to  act  as  interpreters,  a  practice
which has been described by the head of one transcultural
psychiatric  unit  as  unethical  and  totally  unacceptable
[104].  However,  immigrants  often  feel  discomforted
because  they  suspect  the  interpreters  to  disclose  private
and  intimate  information  to  others.  Some  health  prob-
lems are difficult to be discussed in presence of an inter-
preter  or  a  member  of  the  family  [108].  Therefore,
research into working with interprets or health agents and
studies  of  the  processes  of  transmission  and  counter-
transmission are also required.

Communication  problems are  especially significant  as a
factor that generates exclusion and have been reported in
all countries studied. Language is the most essential work
instrument of the mental health care provider as the ana-
lytical and therapeutic processes are heavily dependent on
language as a medium. Drawing on recent studies, services
are almost always only available in the majority language
[104,7].  The  Health  for  all,  all  in  health  study  [104]
reported that most migrants surveyed tended to think that
care providers underestimate the language problems and
also say that language difficulties make them more aggres-
sive and paranoid towards the care provider.

The diagnostic process is complicated by the cultural dif-
ferences between the immigrant and the therapist. Diag-
nostic mistakes are more often than with native patients.
It is important to consider the immigrant's ethnic identity
as well  as his  lay models explaining  his illness. Further-
more, his expectations about the treatment must be con-
sidered if the treatment shall be successful. Integration of
immigrants into a developed network of psychiatric care
system may be a useful strategy. Another condition for a
more  effective  psychiatric  care  of  immigrants  is  a  well
foundedtranscultural  psychiatric  training  of  the  profes-
sionals [105].

There is a clear deficiency in training and education prac-
tices  on  the  subject  of  understanding  immigrant  culture
for mental health professionals working with migrants, as
every country makes the demand of this special training.

Shortages in the provision of appropriate training of pro-
fessional groups could be addressed through the involve-
ment  of  service  users  from  migrant  groups,  who  could
help to overcome the problems of racial and cultural ster-
eotyping which have also been reported in many services.

The absence of monitoring and consultation with clients,
which  makes  impossible  for  planners  and  providers  to
evaluate  the suitability of services, are other deficiencies
that characterises mental health provision for migrants in
Europe.

In order to address all these deficiencies, it is necessary to
provide  with  an  adequate  financing  and  a  continuity  of
the  grants  for  research  into  the  multicultural  health
demand.  Most  of  the  projects  accomplished  have  been
characterised for a short-term funding.

Finally, there is to highlight the importance of adopting
an integrated approach to mental health care that moves
away from psychiatric care only, as it has been stressed in
a  recent  report  of  the  WHO  in  collaboration  with  Red
Cross and Red Crescent organisations.
