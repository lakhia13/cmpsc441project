Abstract: Single motherhood and poverty have a signiﬁcant, negative impact on mothers and their
children. When their mothers experience maternal distress, adolescent children have to take up
more instrumental and emotional ﬁlial responsibilities to comfort their mother and adapt to related
changes. Based on 325 mother–child dyads of Chinese single-mother families experiencing economic
disadvantage, this study examined the relationship between maternal distress and adolescent mental
health problems (indexed by anxiety and depression) and the moderating roles of instrumental and
emotional ﬁlial responsibilities. Results indicated that maternal distress was positively associated
with anxiety and depression in adolescent children. In addition, instrumental ﬁlial responsibility
intensiﬁed the associations of maternal distress with adolescent anxiety and depression. Moreover,
the moderating role of emotional ﬁlial responsibility in the predictive relationship between maternal
distress and adolescent anxiety was different in boys and girls. Adolescent girls with more emotional
ﬁlial responsibility reported higher adolescent anxiety than did those who shouldered less emotional
ﬁlial responsibility when their mother exhibited more distress, whereas the relationship between
maternal distress and adolescent anxiety was stable in boys, regardless of emotional ﬁlial respon-
sibility. In short, the present study showed that parentiﬁcation was likely to occur in poor Chinese
single-mother families, and adolescent children who took up a more caregiving role in the family
exhibited poorer mental health. Family counselling and tangible support for single-mother families
experiencing economic disadvantage are urged.

1. Introduction

As divorce rates in many countries have rapidly increased over the past few decades [1],
single parenthood has become a social issue in global and local contexts. In mainland China,
the crude divorce rate (i.e., the number of divorce decrees granted per 1000 persons) had
increased dramatically in the past ten years from 1.85 in 2009 to 3.36 in 2019 [2], pushing
the State to enforce a 30-day cooling-off period for divorce seekers in 2021. Hong Kong
could not escape from the global trend. The crude divorce rate in Hong Kong rose from 1.11
in 1991 to 2.82 in 2019, with a drop to 2.14 in 2020 due to service lockdown because of the
COVID-19 pandemic [3]. The proportion of single parent population to overall population
of parents with children under 18 years old increased from 3.9% in 2001 to 5.9% in 2016.
Among them, 78% are single mothers [4].

Research studies have showed that single mothers are vulnerable to poverty. They face
more difﬁculties for open employment due to child-rearing demand [5]. Even if they are
available for the job market, their work stability, as well as salary are, relatively, lower than
those of single fathers [6]. In 2016, the median monthly household income of single-mother
families in Hong Kong was HKD 13,780 (USD 1778.2), while the corresponding ﬁgure

was HKD 18,000 (USD 2307.7) in single-father families and HKD 25,000 (USD 3205.1) in
Hong Kong as a whole [4]. Obviously, single-mother families are at the edge of the poverty
threshold (i.e., HKD 12,500 (USD 1602.6)). The absence of a husband and concurrent poverty
further create vulnerabilities to single mothers. Chant [7] used the term “feminisation of
poverty” to describe single mothers who are prone to poverty and face great challenges to
uplift their families out of poverty.

1.1. Maternal Distress and Adolescent Mental Health

The Family Stress Model accounts for the relationship between maternal distress and
adolescent internalization and externalization of problems among economically disadvan-
taged families [8]. In the context of poverty, parents feel stressed when they face economic
hardship. Debts and material deprivation bring burdens to parents, which are associated
with distress and anxiety [9–11]. The experience is particularly stressful for single mothers,
when they exhibit additional negative emotions of depression, resentment and abandon-
ment due to the loss of the spousal relationship [12]. Jones et al. [13] identiﬁed several risk
factors in single-mother families, including inadequate income, maternal depression and
disruptive parenting. As the negative emotions of single mothers would spill over to their
children, there is evidence showing that maternal depression was associated with poorer
mental health in their offspring [14,15].

1.2. Adolescent Filial Responsibility as a Moderator

To support mothers in household management and restore family functioning, adoles-
cent children usually take up more responsibilities in the family [16]. Filial responsibility is
the children’s effort to give assistance and support to the family [17,18]. Typically, there
are two types of ﬁlial responsibilities: instrumental and emotional. While instrumental
ﬁlial responsibility refers to the fulﬁlment of household chores and daily caregiving for the
siblings, emotional ﬁlial responsibility is the support for the emotional needs of parents
and siblings [19]. Due to scarce resources, adolescents need to share the household chores
at home and act as the “surrogate parents” of the younger siblings [20]. Moreover, they
may pick up the “junior-partner” role to comfort their mother’s emotions and act as their
mother’s conﬁdants [19]. As such, ﬁlial responsibility may moderate the impact of maternal
distress on adolescent mental health.

In accounting for the moderating roles of ﬁlial responsibility in altering the relationship
between maternal distress and adolescent mental health problems, both Family Systems
Theory [21,22] and Role Identity Theory [23,24] provide diverse answers to this issue.
Parentiﬁcation has long been studied as a clinical phenomenon that describes a process in
which a child assumes a developmentally inappropriate parental role to perform family
responsibilities [22,25,26]. Parentiﬁcation is commonly identiﬁed in single-parent families
(e.g., [19]) and poor families [27,28] when parents face more difﬁculties in managing life
and family stresses. Thus, their adolescent children are obligated to support the family to
maintain proper family functioning. According to Family Systems Theory, parentiﬁcation
involves role reversal that reduces or blurs the intergenerational boundaries, and the
enmeshed relationship suppresses the age-appropriate needs of the children as they need to
fulﬁl the demands of their parents and siblings, which is harmful to their development [22].
In summary, the parentiﬁed children are described as “burdened children” [26] who have
lost their childhood [29]. Parentiﬁcation was found to be linked to adolescent pathologies
such as depression, somatic symptoms, excessive guilt, etc. [26,30].

However, according to Social Identity Theory [31], family responsibilities are con-
sidered normative and necessary for building family solidarity and stability, particularly
among collectivist societies [23,24]. Under this framework, ﬁlial responsibilities promote
adolescent positive psychosocial outcomes by demonstrating family devotion and estab-
lishing connectedness with family members. Indeed, culture plays an indispensable role in
shaping the ecology of family socialization and adolescent development [32]. In Chinese
societies where collectivism, familism and interdependence are emphasized [33], ﬁlial piety

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5363

has become the cardinal rule for intergeneration conduct, which dictates family obligations
of the children to their parents in the Chinese ethical system [34]. Children are socialized
to provide material and psychological support to parents, fulﬁl the parental wishes, bring
pride to the family, and avoid disgrace to the family name [35]. In a study of 432 poor
single-mother families in Hong Kong, Leung and Shek [36] found that higher ﬁlial piety
was associated with better adolescent development. Filial responsibility was also positively
linked to parent–child cohesion [17], which may reduce maternal distress [37]. From this
view, ﬁlial responsibility may serve as a buffer that smooths the association of maternal
distress with adolescent mental health problems.

1.3. Moderation of Adolescent Gender and Age

Typically, girls take up more instrumental and emotional caregiving than do boys [38],
and girls are more sensitive to affective bonding with mothers than boys [39]. Hence, it is
expected that the inﬂuence of ﬁlial responsibilities on adolescent wellbeing and mother–
child relationships will be stronger in girls than boys. Unfortunately, the ﬁndings in this
area are inconclusive. While some studies showed that girls were more negatively affected
in taking up the caregiving roles (e.g., [40]), other studies did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference
across adolescent gender (e.g., [41]).

Moreover, older adolescents request greater autonomy and more space for personal
development and social engagement when they grow up [20,42]. In addition, they are more
likely to take up a larger share of household chores than are their younger siblings [43].
Hence, compared to younger siblings, older siblings may feel disturbed and annoyed when
they spend much of their time and effort in taking care of their family [42], which may lead
to distress.

1.4. The Present Study

The present study examined the moderating roles of instrumental and emotional ﬁlial
responsibilities in the relationship between maternal distress and children’s mental health
(indexed by anxiety and depression) among Chinese single-mother families experiencing
economic disadvantage. There are several research questions:

Research Question 1: What is the relationship between maternal distress and children’s
mental health (indexed by anxiety and depression) among Chinese single-mother families
experiencing economic disadvantage?

Hypotheses 1. It was hypothesized that maternal distress would be positively associated with
anxiety (H1a) and depression (H1b) in adolescent children among Chinese single-mother families
experiencing economic disadvantage.

Research Question 2: Do instrumental and emotional ﬁlial responsibilities moder-
ate the relationship between maternal distress and children’s mental health (indexed by
anxiety and depression) among Chinese single-mother families experiencing economic
disadvantage?

Hypotheses 2a and 2b. Relative to a lower level of instrumental ﬁlial responsibility, the relation-
ship between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety (H2a) and depression (H2b) would be higher
under a higher level of instrumental ﬁlial responsibility.

Hypotheses 2c and 2d. Relative to a lower level of emotional ﬁlial responsibility, the relationship
between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety (H2c) and depression (H2d) would be stronger
under a higher level of emotional ﬁlial responsibility.

Research Question 3: Does adolescent gender moderate: (a) the direct relationship
between maternal distress and children’s mental health problems (indexed by anxiety
and depression), (b) the interactive effect between maternal distress and instrumental
ﬁlial responsibility, and (c) the interactive effect between maternal distress and emo-
tional ﬁlial responsibility among Chinese single-mother families experiencing economic
disadvantage, respectively?

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5363

Hypotheses 3a and 3b. At higher levels of maternal distress, adolescent anxiety (H3a) and
depression (H3b) would be higher for girls than boys.

Hypotheses 3c and 3d. At higher levels of maternal distress and instrumental ﬁlial responsibility,
adolescent anxiety (H3c) and depression (H3d) would be higher for girls than boys.

Hypotheses 3e and 3f. At higher levels of maternal distress and emotional ﬁlial responsibility,
adolescent anxiety (H3e) and depression (H3f) would be higher for girls than boys.

Research Question 4: Does adolescent age moderate: (a) the direct relationship be-
tween maternal distress and children’s mental health (indexed by anxiety and depression),
(b) the interactive effect between maternal distress and instrumental ﬁlial responsibility,
and (c) the interactive effect between maternal distress and emotional ﬁlial responsibility
among Chinese single-mother families experiencing economic disadvantage, respectively?

Hypotheses 4a and 4b. At higher levels of maternal distress, adolescent anxiety (H4a) and
depression (H4b) would be higher for older adolescents than younger adolescents.

Hypotheses 4c and 4d. At higher levels of maternal distress and instrumental ﬁlial responsi-
bility, adolescent anxiety (H4c) and depression (H4d) would be higher for older adolescents than
younger adolescents.

Hypotheses 4e and 4f. At higher levels of maternal distress and emotional ﬁlial responsibil-
ity, adolescent anxiety (H4e) and depression (H4f) would be higher for older adolescents than
younger adolescents.

2. Method
2.1. Participants and Procedure

As single-mother families experiencing economic disadvantage were a “hidden” com-
munity in Hong Kong to avoid social stigmatization [36], and a complete list of single-
mother families was unavailable in Hong Kong, we adopted a purposeful sampling de-
sign in the study. A total of 325 mother–child dyads from poor single-mother families
were recruited as the respondents. There were three criteria in selecting the respondents:
(1) Chinese families facing single motherhood; (2) at least one child aged between 11 and
17; and (3) the monthly household income of the family was lower than the ofﬁcial poverty
threshold, i.e., 50% of the median monthly domestic household income in Hong Kong.
Those families that received intensive counselling services were excluded in the study.

We invited different non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing community
support programs for single-parent families to participate in the study. Finally, six NGOs,
with 19 social service centres across Hong Kong, joined the study. The participants were
members of these social service centres who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Social
workers from the NGOs were given brieﬁngs on the selection of service targets as well as
procedures on data collection.

There were 325 mother–adolescent dyads of single-mother families participating in the
study. From the mothers’ data, the mean age of the mothers was 44.1 (SD = 5.80). Among
them, 222 (68.3%) were divorced, 23 (7.1%) were separated, 45 (13.8%) were widowed and
29 (7.1%) reported other status (e.g., unmarried, lost contact, etc.) (6 participants did not
respond). A high proportion of mothers had a low educational level, with 183 mothers
(56.7%) completing education at junior secondary level or lower, while 113 (34.8%) com-
pleted secondary level and 27 (6.5%) had post-secondary level (2 participants did not
respond). A majority of families received Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA)
(n = 209, 64.3%), which is a means-tested ﬁnancial assistance given to poor families. The
ﬁgures compared favourably with the ofﬁcial statistics of CSSA recipients in Hong Kong [3].
The mean and mode of the number of children in the families was 1.76 (SD = 0.77) and 2,
respectively. Regarding the adolescent sample, there were 184 boys (56.6%) and 141 girls
(43.3%). The mean age of adolescents was 13.5 (SD = 2.10). For educational level, n = 67
(21.3%) studied in primary schools, n = 182 (56.0%) in junior secondary level, and n = 65

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5363

(20.0%) in senior secondary level (n = 11, 3.4% did not respond). A total of 123 (37.8%) were
lone children, and 86 (26.5%) were the eldest children in the family.

Data collection was conducted either in the social service centres or at respondents’
homes, subject to the preference of the respondents. Written informed consent of both
mothers and adolescents was sought. Mothers were invited to ﬁll out the Mother Question-
naire that contained measures of maternal distress and some demographic characteristics
(e.g., age, educational level, number of children, CSSA recipients, etc.), whereas the ado-
lescents were invited to ﬁll out the Adolescent Questionnaire that contained measures of
ﬁlial responsibilities, mental health attributes and some demographic features (gender, age,
educational level, sibling order, etc.) The questionnaire was completed by each participant
separately in a self-administered format. The respondents returned the questionnaire either
by hand (those that completed the questionnaires at social service centres) or by mail in a
sealed envelope provided by the researchers separately. Each respondent would receive
a supermarket coupon of HKD 50 (USD 6.4) as compensation for his/her time and effort.
The study was approved and monitored by the Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee of
an internationally recognized university.

2.2. Measurements
2.2.1. Maternal Distress

The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is a self-report measurement that
assesses one’s global psychological distress [44]. A sample item is “During that month,
how often do you feel nervous?”. Respondents were invited to rate on a 5-point Likert
scale (1 = “All of the time” to 5 = “None of the time”). The K10 has been used with Chinese
adolescents and showed good reliability [45]. Higher scores of the K10 indicate higher
distress. The K10 showed good internal consistency in this study (α = 0.87).

2.2.2. Adolescent Mental Health

Chinese Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-C). Leung et al. [46] translated
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; [47]) into a Chinese version of HADS
(HADS-C) and showed acceptable psychometric properties in a validation study in Hong
Kong [48]. There are two dimensions of HADS-C; a 7-item Anxiety Subscale, and a 7-item
Depression Subscale. A sample item of the Anxiety Subscale reads “I feel tense or ‘wound
up’”, and that of Depression Subscale reads “I have lost interest in my appearance”. Each
item was assessed on a 4-point (0, 1, 2, and 3) Likert scale from “0 = not at all” to “3 = most
of the time”. Higher mean scores in the Anxiety Subscale and Depression Subscale indicate
higher levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. Both subscales showed acceptable
reliability of both time points (Anxiety Subscale: α at T1 and T2 = 0.75 and 0.76; Depression
Subscale: α at T1 and T2 = 0.69 and 0.67).

2.2.3. Adolescent Filial Responsibilities

The original Filial Responsibility Scale for Youth (FRS-Y) was developed by
Jurkovic et al. [49,50], with three subscales: Instrumental Filial Responsibility Subscale
(IFRS), Emotional Filial Responsibility Subscale (EFRS) and Perceived Unfairness Subscales
(PUS). The measurement was translated into Chinese and then back-translated by two
professionals who were ﬂuent in both English and Chinese, and was validated in a sample
of 617 Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong [51]. In this study, we used both the IFRS and
the EFRS. Each item was rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly disagree”
to “Strongly agree”. The sample item of IFRS reads “I often do the laundry in my family”,
and that of EFRS reads “If someone in my family is upset, I try to help in some way”.
Higher mean scores of IFRS and EFRS indicate higher levels of instrumental and emotional
ﬁlial responsibilities, respectively. Both IFRS and EFRS indicated good internal consistency
(IFRS: α = 0.81; EFRS: α = 0.87).

2.3. Data Analysis

Correlational analyses were performed to examine the relationships between mater-
nal distress, ﬁlial responsibilities (instrumental and emotional), adolescent mental health
attributes (anxiety and depression) and various socio-demographic characteristics (adoles-
cent gender and age, mother’s educational level, number of children in the family, sibling
order, etc.).

In addition, we performed hierarchical multiple regression analyses to test the hypothe-
ses. In testing the moderating effect of instrumental ﬁlial responsibility on the relationship
between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety, we ﬁrst entered covariates into the hierar-
chical regression blocks. Then, the predictor (i.e., maternal distress) and the moderator (i.e.,
instrumental ﬁlial responsibility) were added to the regression equation. Next, maternal
distress and instrumental ﬁlial responsibility were mean-centred. The interaction term of
“maternal distress X instrumental ﬁlial responsibility” was computed and added to the
regression equation. If the interaction term was signiﬁcantly related to adolescent anxiety,
the moderating effect was supported. Simple slope analyses [52] were performed and
plotted graphs were used to illustrate the effects of maternal distress on adolescent anxiety
at high levels (1 SD higher than the mean) and low levels (1 SD lower than the mean) of
instrumental ﬁlial responsibility.

To examine whether the main effect of maternal distress and the interactive effect
of instrumental ﬁlial piety and maternal distress on adolescent anxiety varied between
adolescent boys and girls, three interaction terms, “maternal distress X adolescent gen-
der”, “instrumental ﬁlial responsibility X adolescent gender” and “maternal distress X
instrumental ﬁlial responsibility X adolescent gender”, were computed and put into the
regression equation. If the regression of the interaction term “maternal distress X adolescent
gender” on adolescent anxiety was signiﬁcant, the moderating effect of adolescent gender
on the relationship between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety was supported. If
the interaction term “maternal distress X instrumental ﬁlial responsibility X adolescent
gender” on adolescent anxiety was signiﬁcant, the moderating effect of instrumental ﬁlial
responsibility in the relationship between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety across
adolescent gender was supported. To test the moderating of adolescent age, we created two
dummy variables of “younger adolescents” and “older adolescents” using median spilt.
Identical procedures were performed to examine the moderating effects of emotional ﬁlial
responsibility in the relationship between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety and
depression, respectively, and whether the main and interactive effects would be different
according to adolescent gender and age, respectively.

3. Results

For demographic characteristics, correlation analyses showed that mothers’ educa-
tional levels were linked to maternal distress. While boys, older adolescents, earlier-born
children and those with more siblings reported more adolescent instrumental ﬁlial respon-
sibility, older children and later-born children reported more emotional ﬁlial responsibility.
In addition, earlier-born adolescents exhibited greater anxiety than did later-born adoles-
cents. While maternal distress was positively related to adolescent anxiety and depression,
emotional ﬁlial responsibility was negatively associated with adolescent depression. The
correlation matrix for the variables is listed in Table 1.

After controlling for the covariates (adolescent gender and age, sibling birth order,
number of children in the family, and mother’s educational level), maternal distress
marginally predicted adolescent anxiety, with β = 0.11 (p < 0.10) (Table 2). H1a was
marginally supported. Instrumental ﬁlial responsibility moderated the relationship be-
tween maternal distress and adolescent anxiety among single-mother families experiencing
economic disadvantage, with a signiﬁcant standardized regression coefﬁcient of adoles-
cent anxiety by “Maternal distress × Instrumental ﬁlial responsibility” (β = 0.12, p < 0.05;
Table 2). At a higher level of instrumental ﬁlial responsibility, maternal distress was associ-
ated with greater adolescent anxiety, with β = 0.29 (p < 0.01), whereas the association of
maternal distress and adolescent anxiety was non-signiﬁcant at lower levels of instrumental
ﬁlial responsibility (β = −0.03; p > 0.05; Table 3) (Figure 1). H2a was supported. Adolescent
gender and age neither moderate the direct relationship between maternal distress and
adolescent anxiety, nor that regarding instrumental ﬁlial responsibility in the association of
maternal distress with adolescent anxiety (Table 2).

Moreover, instrumental ﬁlial responsibility moderated the relationship between mar-
ital distress and adolescent depression, with a signiﬁcant standardized regression coefﬁ-
cient of “Maternal distress × Instrumental ﬁlial responsibility” on adolescent depression
(β = 0.13, p < 0.05; Table 2). When mothers exhibited greater distress, adolescent children
reported more depressive symptoms when they demonstrated higher levels of instrumental
ﬁlial responsibility (β = 0.32, p < 0.01; Table 3) than those demonstrating lower levels of
instrumental ﬁlial responsibility (β = −0.06; p > 0.05; Table 3) (Figure 2). H2b was sup-

maternal distress and adolescent depression, or instrumental ﬁlial responsibility in the
association of maternal distress with adolescent depression (Table 2).

4. Discussion

This study examined the associations of maternal distress with adolescent mental
health problems in poor Chinese single-mother families in Hong Kong, and the moderating
effects of ﬁlial responsibilities (indexed by instrumental ﬁlial responsibility and emotional
ﬁlial responsibility) in the relationships. The ﬁndings showed some support of the Family
Stress Model that maternal distress was associated with adolescent anxiety and depression
in poor single-mother families [8]. Moreover, instrumental ﬁlial responsibility moderated
the relationship between maternal distress and adolescent anxiety and depression. At
lower levels of maternal distress, adolescent anxiety and depression was at the lowest
level when adolescents performed instrumental ﬁlial responsibility. According to Role
Identity Theory [23], adolescents’ performance of household chores and care-giving to
their siblings demonstrated their commitment towards the family [17]. Their assistance
in housework may ease the workload of mothers and facilitate better family functioning,
which contributes to the positive family adaptation process in the face of single motherhood
and poverty [38].

However, when maternal distress increased, adolescent children performing more
instrumental ﬁlial responsibility exhibited higher levels of anxiety and depression. There
are three possibilities that account for the ﬁndings. First, according to Family Systems
Theory [21], parentiﬁcation involves an enmeshed relationship between mothers and
adolescents [22]. Adolescents who performed more ﬁlial responsibility may be easily
tangled with their mother’s negative emotions, i.e., adolescents who are more ﬁlial may be
more anxious and depressed when they share the grief and pain of their mother. Second,
when mothers exhibit distress, they may ignore the contributions of their children in
performing the ﬁlial roles. The failure of maternal recognition and mattering may increase
adolescent anxiety and depression [53]. Third, an increase of maternal distress may imply
greater demands from mothers and other family members on adolescents’ commitment in
fulﬁlling household chores and caregiving for younger siblings, if mothers fail to fulﬁl their
responsibilities at home. These additional demands further suppress the age-appropriate
needs of the children, which are detrimental to their wellbeing [19,28,29].

The ﬁndings further indicated that emotional ﬁlial responsibility moderated the as-
sociations of maternal distress with adolescent anxiety. Furthermore, the moderating role
of emotional ﬁlial responsibility was found to be different between adolescent boys and
girls. In general, boys were more anxious in single-mother families than were girls. In
Chinese culture, as males take up a dominant role to protect the family [33], the absence of
the father implies that the son needs to shoulder the responsibility to take care of the family
and be involved in the decision-making process (i.e., the surrogate father), which may
create stress and anxiety for adolescent boys. Moreover, the results showed that greater
maternal distress was related to greater anxiety among adolescent girls who perform many
emotional ﬁlial responsibilities. On the other hand, when girls performed less emotional
ﬁlial responsibility, the association of maternal distress with girls’ anxiety was negative.
However, the association of maternal distress and adolescent anxiety was non-signiﬁcant
for boys, regardless of different levels of emotional ﬁlial responsibility. When performing
emotional caregiving duties, girls are highly involved in their mothers’ distress and become
enmeshed in the mother–daughter relationship [39], which may heighten their anxiety
level. In contrast, when girls take up less emotional ﬁlial responsibility, they can have a
better self-differentiation from their mother and get less involved in their mothers’ emotion,
which is better for their wellbeing [54]. For adolescent boys, the association of maternal
distress with adolescent anxiety was invariant regardless of the emotional caregiving they
offer. One possibility is that males are more task-oriented and pay less attention to emotions
in their coping [55], making them less sensitive to maternal distress in fulﬁlling emotional
ﬁlial responsibility. The other possibility is that the “surrogate father” role has been de-
manding for them [56,57]. Hence, an increase in emotional ﬁlial responsibility may not
change the relationship between maternal distress and boys’ wellbeing. As studies on the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5363

12 of 15

father’s role taking of adolescent boys in single-mother families are severely lacking, more
research in this area is suggested.

There are several theoretical and practical implications of the present ﬁndings. First,
the study suggests that parentiﬁcation does happen in single-mother families experienc-
ing economic disadvantage [26,29]. Facing maternal distress, adolescent children taking
up more instrumental and emotional ﬁlial responsibility reported poorer mental health
when compared with those who take up less ﬁlial responsibilities. Though the study was
conducted in the Chinese context, the ﬁndings echo some studies performed in the U.S.
where adolescents displayed more distress and anxiety, more disciplinary problems and
poorer academic performance arising from instrumental and emotional caregiving (30,
58). These ﬁndings alarm researchers and family practitioners regarding the needs and
situations of adolescent children and their mothers in these underprivileged families. As
adolescents need to perform household chores and take care of the emotional needs of
their mother and siblings, over and beyond the age-appropriate developmental tasks that
they can accomplish, this would lead to stress and anxiety. Unfortunately, poor single-
mother families are hidden groups to avoid social labels aligned with single motherhood
and poverty [36]. More resources and services should be given to these families. Family
counselling is necessary to relieve the emotions of mothers and other family members, and
reorganize the family roles and functions so that the adolescent children are not troubled
by these additional family responsibilities. Moreover, more tangible resources such as a
family aide service would be helpful to relieve the burdens of single mothers and children
due to family distress and poverty.

Furthermore, the present study showed that adolescent boys exhibited consistently
high levels of anxiety in poor single mother families, and adolescent girls who performed
more emotional ﬁlial responsibility reported increasing anxiety when their mothers ex-
pressed greater distress. These ﬁndings contribute to the social science literature by high-
lighting gender differences in the interactive effects of emotional caregiving and maternal
distress on adolescent anxiety, which has been inadequately explored in family studies.
Moreover, family scholars and practitioners may need to pay more attention to gender
difference in family roles taken by adolescent children in poor single-mother families and
their relationship with adolescent stress. The sons may need to take up the role of a “surro-
gate father” [56,57], and the daughters may need to provide emotional caregiving to their
distressed mother, which may generate great stress and anxiety for them. Family practi-
tioners and youth workers may need to examine the underlying family roles of adolescents
in the family, and provide appropriate support for the adolescents and their families.

Despite the pioneer ﬁndings in a Chinese context, there are several limitations of the
study. First, as the study is cross-sectional, it has the intrinsic limitation of drawing causal
relationship between the variables. Hence, there is a need to conduct longitudinal studies
in future. Second, non-random sampling via recruitment from social service units was
adopted in the study due to the incomplete list of poor single-mother families, as well as
difﬁculties in identifying these families. As a result, those families that did not receive
social service assistance were excluded in the study. Adolescent children in these families
might be the more vulnerable, as they did not receive any assistance from the community,
and their mental health might be more affected by ﬁlial obligations to take care of their
families. Third, the study was conducted in Hong Kong. Though the ﬁndings support
some studies conducted in Western societies [30,58], there is a need to replicate the study in
other Chinese communities in Mainland China, Taiwan and elsewhere.

5. Conclusions

The present study is pioneering in examining the moderating role of instrumental
and emotional ﬁlial responsibilities in the relationship between maternal distress and
adolescent mental health among Chinese single-mother families experiencing economic
disadvantage. The study revealed that instrumental and emotional ﬁlial responsibilities
intensiﬁed the relationship between maternal distress and poorer adolescent mental health

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5363

in single-mother families experiencing economic disadvantage. Parentiﬁcation may occur
when adolescent children take up more instrumental and emotional ﬁlial responsibilities in
helping their distressed mothers, which was linked to poorer mental health in adolescents.
In response to McLanahan and Sandefur [56]’s questions on “what helps” and “what hurts”
in adolescents growing up in single-mother families, this study provides insightful insights
into the roles of ﬁlial responsibilities in the association of maternal distress and adolescent
wellbeing in Chinese contexts.
