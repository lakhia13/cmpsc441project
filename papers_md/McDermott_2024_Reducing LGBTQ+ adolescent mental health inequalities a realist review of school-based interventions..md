ABSTRACT
Background:  lGBtQ+  young  people  have  elevated  rates  of  poor  mental  health  in  comparison  to  their 
cisgender  heterosexual  peers.  School  environment  is  a  key  risk  factor  and  consistently  associated  with 
negative  mental  health  outcomes  for  lGBtQ+  adolescents.
Aims:  to  examine  how,  why,  for  whom  and  in  what  context  school-based  interventions  prevent  or 
reduce  mental  health  problems  in  lGBtQ+  adolescents.
Methods:  A  realist  review  methodology  was  utilised  and  focused  on  all  types  of  school-based 
interventions  and  study  designs.  A  Youth  Advisory  Group  were  part  of  the  research  team.  Multiple 
search  strategies  were  used  to  locate  relevant  evidence.  Studies  were  subject  to  inclusion  criteria  and 
quality  appraisal,  and  included  studies  were  synthesised  to  produce  a  programme  theory.  Seventeen 
studies  were  included  in  the  review.
Results:  eight  intervention  components  were  necessary  to  address  lGBtQ+  pupils  mental  health: 
affirmative  visual  displays;  external  signposting  to  lGBtQ+  support;  stand-alone  input;  school-based 
lGBtQ  support  groups;  curriculum-based  delivery;  staff  training;  inclusion  policies;  trusted  adult.  Few 
school-based  interventions  for  this  population  group  were  identified.
Conclusions:  the  programme  theory  indicates  that  “to  work”  school-based  interventions  must  have  a 
“whole-school”  approach 
the  dominant  cis-heteronormative  school 
environment and hence the marginalisation, silence, and victimisation that lGBtQ+ pupils can experience.

1.  Introduction

There  are  considerable  mental  health  inequalities  between  les-
bian,  gay,  bisexual,  trans  and  queer/questioning  (LGBTQ+)1 
young people and their cisgender heterosexual peers (McDermott 
et  al.,  2018).  Systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  consistently 
report  a  higher  prevalence  of  depression,  self-harm,  suicidal  ide-
ation  and  attempts,  and  problematic  substance  use  in  LGBTQ+ 
youth  compared  to  cis-heterosexual  youth  (Coker  et  al.,  2010; 
Haas  et  al.,  2011;  Irish  et  al.,  2019;  Marshal  et  al.,  2011;  Saewyc, 
2011).  A  recent  meta-analysis  of  studies  comparing  suicidality 
in  youth  found  that  compared  to  cisgender  and  heterosexual 
youth,  trans  youth  were  six  times,  bisexual  youth  five  times  and 
lesbian  and  gay  (LG)  youth  four  times  more  likely  to  report  a 
history  of  attempted  suicide  (Di  Giacomo  et  al.,  2018).  The 
restrictions  due  to  Covid-19  have  also  had  a  disproportionate 
impact  on  LGBTQ+  young  people’s  mental  health  (Kamal  et  al., 
2021),  and  trans  and  gender  diverse  youth  have  been  more 
effected  by  the  pandemic  than  cis  youth  (Hawke  et  al.,  2021).

School  climate  is  a  leading  predictor  of  students’  emotional 
and  behavioural  outcomes  (Maxwell  et  al.,  2017).  School  cli-
mate  encompasses  all  elements  of  the  school  experience  for 
young  people,  including  quality  of  teaching  and  learning, 
school  community  relationships,  school  organisation,  and  the 
institutional  and  structural  features  of  a  school  environment. 
This  contributes  to  the  quality  of  interactions  for  students, 
teachers  and  parents,  and  reflects  the  norms,  values  and  goals, 
which  represent  the  educational  and  social  objectives  of  the 
school  (Council,  2007).  School  climate  affects  students’  adap-
tive  psychosocial  adjustment  (Brand  et  al.,  2008),  mental 
health  outcomes  (Brand  et  al.,  2003;  Roeser  et  al.,  2000),  and 
self-esteem  (Hudson-Sharp  &  Metcalf,  2016).  Further,  it  has 
been  specifically  associated  with  LGBTQ+  youth’s  experience 
of  mental  health  problems,  such  as  depression  and  suicidality 
(Marraccini  et  al.,  2022;  Peter  et  al.,  2016).  A  scoping  review 
found  that  peer  victimisation,  bullying  and  safety  concerns 
are  prevalent  for  transgender  young  people  within  the  sec-
ondary  schooling  environment  and  these  three  factors  are

related  to  negative  mental  health  outcomes  (Mackie  et  al., 
2021).  Importantly,  a  recent  systematic  review  found  that  pos-
itive  school  climate  reduced  the  risk  of  suicide  and  depressive 
symptoms  for  LGBTQ  students  compared  to  those  not  in  a 
positive  school  climate  (Ancheta  et  al.,  2021).

The  2016  UNESCO  Out  in  the  Open  (UNESCO,  2016) 
report  identified  homophobic,  biphobic,  and  transphobic 
(HBT)  violence  in  schools  as  a  global  problem,  and  young 
people  who  are  perceived  not  to  conform  to  prevailing  sex-
ual  and  gender  norms,  including  those  who  are  LGBTQ+ 
identified,  as  most  vulnerable.  The  report  concluded  that  a 
“comprehensive  approach”  that  involves  the  whole  education 
sector  was  the  most  effective  means  of  addressing  the  issue. 
However,  only  three  countries  had  conducted  a  large-scale 
formal  evaluation  of  interventions  to  tackle  HBT  violence  in 
schools:  the  Netherlands,  USA,  and  the  UK.  In  the  UK  the 
intervention  tackling  HBT  bullying  in  schools  (Mitchell 
et  al.,  2014;  Mitchell  et  al.,  2016)  has  been  evaluated  nation-
ally  (Mitchell  et  al.,  2016).  This  research  remains  one  of  the 
only  evaluations  of  an  intervention  that  addresses  this  issue 
(nationally  and  globally).  A  key  finding  from  the  evaluation 
was  that  for  anti-HBT  bullying  initiatives  to  be  successful 
they  needed  to  be  part  of  a  “whole  school”  approach  (Aiden 
et  al.,  2013).  The  “whole  school”  approach  to  HBT  bullying 
involves  the  entire  school  rather  than  being  limited  to  one 
area  of  activity  (Mitchell  et  al.,  2016).  This  means  moving 
away  from  individually  oriented  approaches  that  focus  on 
punishing  single  actors  (e.g.  bullies),  and  instead  moves  to, 
for  example,  creating  more  inclusive  curricula  and  more  pos-
itive  LGBTQ+  representation.  Formby  (2015)  argues  that  a 
narrow  focus  on  HBT  bullying  does  not  address  the 
multi-levelled  approach  needed  to  challenge  the  dominant 
cis-heteronormative culture of schools and create an LGBTQ+ 
inclusive  environment.  National  policy  both  in  the  UK  and 
US  has  tended  to  have  a  limited  focus  on  HBT-bullying  in 
schools  that  concentrates  on  individual  actors  and  conceals 
the  systemic  and  pervasive  gender  and  sexual  minority 
inequalities  of  the  wider  school  climate  (Gilbert  et  al.,  2018; 
Ringrose  &  Renold,  2010).

Significantly,  the  UK  evaluation  of  the  “whole-school” 
intervention  to  tackle  HBT-bullying  in  schools  did  not  eval-
uate  the  impact  of  the  intervention  on  pupil  mental  health 
(Mitchell  et  al.,  2016).  A  systematic  review  conducted  on 
the  impacts  of  school  climate  and  safe  school  interventions/
programmes  on  LGBTQ+  youth  outcomes  (Black  et  al., 
2012) indicated that effective interventions could be grouped 
according  to  three  common  themes:  (1)  Inclusive  programs 
including  support  groups 
(e.g.  gay-straight  alliances), 
teacher  training  programs,  and  community  or  student 
diversity 
encompassing 
anti-discrimination  policies  for  students  and  faculty,  and 
clear  and  enforceable  anti-harassment  policies;  (3)  A  sup-
portive  environment  constituting  of  safe  school  policies, 
school  board  support  of  inclusive  curriculum,  available  sup-
portive  staff,  inclusive  class  discussions  about  LGBTQ+ 
issues,  and  peer  acceptance.  The  authors  conclude  that  safe 
schools  with  unclear  or  unstable  policy  and  programs 
resulted 
in  more  student  mental  health  problems  e.g. 
depression,  anxiety  (Black  et  al.,  2012).

However,  what  is  clear  from  this  systematic  review  is  that 
the  evidence  is  sparse  and  based  mainly  in  US  and  Canada. 
More  importantly,  the  explanations  for  why  these  interven-
tions  may  improve  LGBTQ+  youth  mental  health  have  been 
approximated  rather  than  investigated  robustly.  This  has 
repercussions  for  developing  interventions  to  tackle  school 
climate  because  we  do  not  know  what  works,  for  whom, 
and  in  what  context.  That  is,  we  do  not  understand  the 
mechanisms  that  underpin  the  impact  of  school  environ-
ment  on  LGBTQ+  youth  mental  health  or  their  relationship 
to  different  contexts,  and  this  restricts  the  transferability  of 
interventions  to  a  variety  of  educational  contexts.  Taking  a 
public  health  approach  to  address  this  paucity  of  evidence, 
this  realist  review  aimed  to  develop  a  theoretical  under-
standing  of  the  processes  through  which 
interventions 
within  educational  settings  may  prevent  or  reduce  LGBTQ+ 
adolescents  mental  health  inequalities.  The  review  had  two 
research questions: (1) What evidence exists that school-based 
interventions  can  prevent  or  reduce  mental  health  problems 
in  LGBTQ+  adolescents?  (2)  How,  why,  for  whom  and  in 
what  context  may  school-based  interventions  prevent  or 
reduce  mental  health  problems  in  LGBTQ+  adolescents?

2.  Methods

The  realist  review  method  is  a  theory  driven  approach  to 
systematic  reviews  that  has  been  developed  for  complex 
social  interventions  where  the  experimental  paradigm  of 
the  randomised  control  trial  may  be  an  inappropriate 
methodology  for  producing  evidence  (Pawson  et  al.,  2005, 
Greenhalgh  et  al.,  2011).  The  realist  review  method  uses 
relevant  theory,  causal  models,  and  empirical  data  to  estab-
lish  how  a  public  health  intervention  causes  particular  out-
comes  in  what  circumstances  and  for  whom.  Therefore,  a 
realist  review  methodology  is  used  to  explain  why  inter-
ventions  have  failed,  as  well  as  why  they  are  successful;  it 
provides  theoretical  explanations  for  “what  works,  for 
whom,  under  what  circumstances,  how  and  why?”  (Wong 
et  al.,  2013).

The  realist  research  tradition  is  premised  upon  an  onto-
logical  perspective  that  social  reality  is  interpretative  and 
social  actors  (human  beings)  evaluate  social  reality  (Pawson 
et  al.,  2005).  From  a  realist  perspective,  to  comprehend  how 
interventions  produce  outcomes,  the  role  of  external  reality 
and  human  action  need  to  be  included  within  research 
designs (Greenhalgh et al., 2011). A realist approach attempts 
to  identify  the  underlying  theories  that  explain  the  patterns 
in  the  way  individuals  make  similar  choices  within  particu-
lar 
intervention  conditions  (demi-regularities).  In  other 
words,  a  realist  perspective  identifies  the  context  within 
which  mechanisms  (underlying  processes)  generate  the  out-
comes  of  interest  (e.g.  mental  health).

The  realist  review  method  is  appropriate  when  consider-
ing  complex  interventions  which  consist  of  many  compo-
nents  and  are  contingent  upon  the  behaviours  and  choices 
of  those  they  seek  to  benefit.  In  addition,  this  method  is 
used  when  there  is  little  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  or 
acceptability  of  interventions  (Coryn  et  al.,  2011)  and/or  the 

770

literature  is  heterogenic  (Harden  et  al.,  2015;  Petticrew, 
2015).  The  realist  review  methodology  follows  the  same  rig-
orous  format  as  aggregative  systematic  reviews  but  the  syn-
thesis  of  the  research  is  focussed  on  theory  generation  and 
specifically  aims  to  broaden  understanding  of  particular 
interventions  rather  than  testing  causal  hypotheses  (Booth 
et  al.,  2011).  The  key  analytic  process  in  a  realist  review 
involves  the  development  of  a  programme  theory  that 
explains  how  and  why  and  in  what  context  the  intervention 
will  produce  its  desired  objectives.  We  followed  the  establish 
seven-step  realist  review  protocol  (Greenhalgh  et  al.,  2011; 
Pawson  et  al.,  2005)  and  publication  standards  (Wong  et  al., 
2013).  The  review  protocol  was  registered  with  PROSPERO 
(McDermott  et  al.,  2019).

2.1.  Scoping  the  literature

The  aim  of  the  scoping  literature  search  was  to  assess  the 
available  published  literature  on  school-based  interventions 
aimed  at  preventing  LGBTQ+  youth  mental  health  prob-
lems.  The  results  indicated  a  sufficient  evidence  base,  high-
lighting  specific  features  consistently  contributing  to  a 
for  LGBTQ+  youth  such  as 
positive  school  climate 
anti-discrimination  policies  (Kull  et  al.,  2016;  Swanson  & 
Gettinger,  2016;  Szalacha,  2003),  gay-straight  alliances 
(McGuire  et  al.,  2010;  Peter  et  al.,  2016;  Szalacha,  2003), 
LGBTQ+  inclusive  curriculum  (Snapp  et  al.,  2015),  and  peer 
and  teacher  support  in  schools  (Kohoulat  et  al.,  2015;  Peter 
et  al.,  2016).

2.2.  Developing  the  initial  theory

Emmel  et  al.  (2018)  highlight  the  importance  of  identifying 
the  right  theories  at  the  start  of  a  realist  project  to  frame 
the  study.  Public  mental  health  interventions  are  complex 
and  there  is  a  plethora  of  possible  theories.  At  the  start  of 
the  review  we  identified,  through  expertise  in  the  research 
team,  six  existing  Middle  Range  Theories  (MRTs)  (Jamal 
et  al.,  2015)  that  explain  why  there  is  elevated  poor  mental 
health  in  LGBTQ+  populations.  These  theories  were  from  a 
range  of  disciplines  and  therefore  had  a  variety  of  perspec-
tives  these  were:  Johnson  (2015)  psychosocial;  Meyer, 
Hatzenbuehler  and  Riggs  &  Treharne  all  psychology 
(Hatzenbuehler,  2009;  Meyer,  2003;  Riggs  &  Treharne, 
2017);  Cover  and  McDermott  &  Roen  both  queer  theory 
(Cover,  2016;  McDermott  &  Roen,  2016).  In  addition,  the 
initial  theory  was  informed  by  the  two  UK  national  reports 
on  the  “whole-school  approach”  to  tackling  HBT  bullying 
in  schools  (Mitchell  et  al.,  2014;  Mitchell  et  al.,  2016).  This 
intervention  was  delivered  to  over  900  schools  in  the  UK. 
The  whole-school  approach  involves  seven  identified  pro-
gramme  elements:  affirmative  visual  displays;  external  sign-
posting to LGBTQ+ support; stand-alone input; school-based 
LGBTQ  support  groups;  curriculum-based  delivery;  staff 
training;  and  inclusion  policies.  The  evaluation  highlighted 
that  these  seven  programme  elements  were  important  to 
ensuring  a  whole-school  approach  to  tackling  anti-HBT 
bullying.

Close  stakeholder  engagement  from  the  outset  is  recom-
mended  in  realist  reviews  (Cooper  et  al.,  2017)  and  five 
young  LGBTQ+  people  (aged  between  15  and  22)  were 
recruited  to  participate  in  a  Youth  Advisory  Group  to  sup-
port  the  research.  The  aim  of  involving  LGBTQ+  young 
people  was  to  help  to  develop  the  initial  theory  and  ensure 
this  was  informed  by  stakeholder  perspectives.  The  young 
people  were  treated  as  full  members  of  the  research  team 
and  were  employed  by  the  University  as  paid  researchers. 
To  develop  the 
initial  theory,  LGBTQ+  young  people 
attended  focus  groups,  and  vignettes  were  used  to  explore 
why  (and  in  what  context)  particular  school-based  inter-
ventions  prevent  or  reduce  mental  health  problems  in 
LGBTQ+  adolescents.  Figure  1  outlines  the  Initial  Theory 
developed  from  the  Middle  Range  Theories,  LGBTQ+ 
Youth  Advisory  Group,  the  empirical  papers  from  the  scop-
ing review and the two national reports of the UK anti-HBT 
bullying  intervention.  This  Initial  Theory  was  then  used  to 
inform  the  realist  review  with  the  expectation  that  it  would 
be  refined  via  the  review  synthesis  process  to  produce  a 
Programme  Theory.

2.3.  Search  strategy

Multiple  search  strategies  were  used  to  locate  relevant  evi-
dence  (including  grey  literature)  from  1999  to  March  2021. 
Good  practice  in  realist  reviews  characterise  searching  for 
literature  as  an  iterative  process  (Pawson  et  al.,  2005; 
Rycroft-Malone  et  al.,  2012).  Researchers  involved  in  the 
search  process  need  to  be  open  to  the  possibility  of  revisit-
ing  searches  as  theoretical  understanding  of  the  interven-
tions  becomes  more  refined.  In  common  with  good  practice 
in  realist  reviews,  the  search  for  evidence  ended  once  theo-
retical  saturation  had  been  achieved  (Pawson  et  al.,  2005). 
This  involved  the  research  team  checking  whether  newly 
identified  evidence  made  a  significant  contribution  to  the 
programme  theory  development  process.

The  start  date  of  the  review  was  January  1999  to  reflect 
the  greater  global  liberalisation  in  legislation,  policy,  and 
practice  regarding  LGBTQ+  populations  that  has  taken  place 
over  the  last  two  decades  (Weeks,  2007).  The  social  and  cul-
tural  context  of  LGBTQ+  people’s  lives  in  the  West  has 
changed  dramatically  in  the  last  20 years  (Weeks,  2007)  and 
therefore  research  before  this  “modern”  era  is  likely  to  be 
less  useful  to  developing  a  theoretical  understanding  of  the 
processes  through  which  interventions  within  contemporary 
educational  settings  may  prevent  or  reduce  LGBTQ+  adoles-
cents  mental  health  inequalities.  For  example  in  the  UK 
there  was  legislation  in  place  that  prohibited  schools  from 
discussing  sexual  orientation  within  an  education  setting 
from  1988  to  2003  (Ellis,  2007)  thus  preventing  interven-
tions  to  improve  LGBTQ+  young  people’s  school  experience. 
Systematic 
for 
peer-reviewed  articles  published  in  both  discipline  specific 
databases  (PubMed,  PsycINFO,  Embase,  ERIC,  CINAHL), 
and  multidisciplinary  databases  (Web  of  Science,  Google 
scholar,  Scopus).  Expert  consultation,  forward  citation  track-
ing,  and  hand-searching  were  utilised  to  supplement  the 

searches  were

electronic  database.  The  search  terms  were  divided  into  five 
main  domain  categories:  (i)  sexual  orientation  and  gender 
identity;  (ii)  age;  (iii)  education;  (iv)  mental  health  and  well-
being;  (v)  intervention  (see  supplemental  Appendix  1  for 
full  search  details).

We  conducted  targeted  searches  of  the  grey  literature 
where  there  might  be  relevant  evidence.  We  searched  using 
key  organisational  websites:  Stonewall,  Educate  &  Celebrate, 
Government  Equality  Office,  Schools  Out,  The  Proud  Trust, 
Government  departments  in  UK,  Canada,  and  USA.  In 
addition,  we  used  Google  to  search  for  literature.  Given  the 
high  number  of  hits  returned  we  used  Google’s  relevancy 
rankings  and  set  a  limit  of  screening  the  first  ten  pages  of 
results.  This  search  was  also  facilitated  by  contacting  subject 
experts  known  in  the  field  and  identified  through  our  iter-
ative  searching.

2.4.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria

Studies  were  eligible  for  inclusion  if  they  were  published  in 
English  and  evaluated:  (i)  changes  to  the  educational  setting; 
(ii)  the  effect  of  the  changes  on  mental  health  outcomes; 
(iii)  LGBTQ+  young  people  (see  Table  1).  Young  people 
aged  10–18 years  were  included,  as  this  review  focussed  on 
adolescents,  and  there  is  a  paucity  of  research  on  these  types 
of  intervention  amongst  younger  age  groups.  The  mental 
health  outcomes  included  direct  measures  of  mental  health 
e.g.  anxiety,  depression  and  suicidality,  measures  associated 
with  mental  health  e.g.  self-esteem,  and  measures  that  are 
important  to  mental  resilience  &  wellbeing  e.g.  coping,

were  applied  by  four  researchers  for  their  eligibility  in  the

discuss  the  application  of  the  criteria,  and  whether  literature

could  contribute  to  building  theories  about  educational 
interventions  and  how  they  may  impact  LGBTQ+  youth 
mental  health  (Pawson  et  al.,  2005).

2.5.  Quality  appraisal

The  appraisal  of  quality  in  realist  reviews  is  conducted  dif-
ferently  from  conventional  systematic  reviews  (Pawson  et  al., 
2005).This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  realist  review  methodology 
rejects  the  “hierarchy  of  evidence”  with  the  randomised  con-
trolled  trial  (RCT)  sitting  at  the  top  because  RCTs  focus  on 
what  works,  and  largely  overlook  the  circumstantial  factors 
influencing  the  effectiveness  of  an  intervention  (Pawson, 
2006;  Pawson  et  al.,  2005).  Realist  appraisal  of  studies  uses 
two  main  criteria  to  decide  whether  the  study  will  be  con-
sidered  in  the  synthesis:  relevance  and  rigour  (Pawson 
et  al.,  2005).

Firstly,  studies  were  assessed  on  their  relevance.  Studies 
were  deemed  eligible  if  they  could  contribute  to  building 
theories  about  educational  interventions  and  how  they  may 
widen or reduce mental health inequalities amongst LGBTQ+ 
youth.  Secondly,  the  methodological  rigour  of  each  individ-
ual  study  was  judged  to  ascertain  whether  it  was  trustworthy 
and  had  sufficient  weight  to  make  a  credible  contribution  to 
developing  the  intervention  theory.  We  adapted  a  previously 
used  realist  review  methodological  appraisal  criteria  (Jagosh 
et  al.,  2011)  that  asked  four  main  questions:  (1)  Does  the 
full-text  paper  describe  the  research  setting?  (2)  Does  the 
full-text  paper  indicate  empirical  research  (i.e.  that  there  is 
some  description  of  methodology,  methods,  data  collection 
and  analysis)?  (3)  Does  the  full-text  paper  describe  LGBTQ+ 
youth  mental  health  outcome  data?  (4)  Does  the  full-text 
paper  describe  an  LGBTQ+  youth  mental  health  interven-
tion  in  an  educational  setting?  These  criteria  were  applied 
by  four  of  the  authors  with  regular  meetings  to  discuss 
decisions.

2.6.  Data  extraction

There  is  no  fixed  method  of  data  extraction  in  realist 
reviews  and  Wong  et  al.  (2013)  suggest  that  an  eclectic  and 
iterative  approach 
to  data  extraction  be  adopted.  We 
designed  a  data  extract  template  and  for  each  included  study 
we  extracted  the  study  details,  intervention  type,  context, 
mechanism,  outcome.  The  data  was  extracted  in  “conversa-
tion”  with  the  Initial  Theory  (Figure  1)  (Dalkin  et  al.,  2015) 
and  we  recorded  reflective  notes  on  the  data  extraction  pro-
cess  in  relation  to  the  main  research  question:  How,  why,  for 
whom  and  in  what  context  may  school-based  interventions 
prevent  or  reduce  mental  health  problems  in  LGBTQ+ 
adolescents?

stage  (Rycroft-Malone  et  al.,  2012)  and  more  recent  publica-
tions  suggest  that  any  appropriately  selected  and  justified 
analytic  techniques  might  be  used  (Wong  et  al.,  2013).  We 
have  therefore  drawn  on  Rycroft-Malone  et  al’s  (2012)  meth-
odological  steps  in  developing  a  programme  theory  and 
Dalkin  et  al.  (2015)  disaggregation  of  the  concept  of  mech-
anism  into  two  parts:  (i)  intervention  resources;  (ii)  partici-
pants’  reasoning.

A  fundamental  building  block  of  realist  explanation  and 
developing  a  programme  theory  is  generating  causal  links 
between  context,  mechanism,  and  outcome  (CMOs).  CMOs 
are  theories  of  causality,  a  realist  approach  argues  that  we 
cannot  observe  causal  patterns  alone  and  theory  (mecha-
nisms)  explain  the  patterns  and  why  there  is  a  relationship. 
We  tabulated  the  CMOs  for  each  of  the  included  papers, 
and  then  integrated  these  with  the  Initial  Theory  we  had 
developed.  We  used  the  six  identified  MRTs  (Cover,  2016; 
Hatzenbuehler,  2009;  Johnson,  2015;  McDermott  &  Roen, 
2016;  Meyer,  2003;  Riggs  &  Treharne,  2017)  to  develop  the 
causal  pathways,  these  theories  were  used  to  deepen  the 
explanations  of  why  each  of  the  intervention  components 
might  reduce  poor  mental  health  in  LGBTQ+  young  peo-
ple.  We  also  ran  a  workshop  with  the  LGBTQ+  Youth 
Advisory  Group  to  enhance  this  thinking.  Through  the 
identification  of  potential  CMOs  we  then  refined  the  Initial 
Theory

school-based  interventions  may  work  to  reduce  LGBTQ+

3.  Results

3.1.  Search  results

The  results  of  the  searches,  screening  and  appraisal  process 
are  displayed  in  the  PRISMA  flow  chart  (Figure  2).  The 
search  criteria  applied  in  electronic  databases  returned 
n = 6597  results,  which  after  duplicates  were  removed  left 
n = 4911  potentially  eligible  articles.  After  title  and  abstract 
screening,  there  were  n = 125  articles  which  were  included 
in  the  next  stage.  The  full-text  screening,  appraisal,  and 
expert  review  process  eliminated  n = 56  articles  in  total,  and 
resulted  in  n = 69  relevant  articles,  n = 15  of  which  were 
empirical  papers  included  in  the  final  realist  synthesis.

Delays  due  to  Covid-19  restrictions  meant  that  in  March 
2021,  additional  searches  were  run  using  Web  of  Science, 
PsycINFO and PubMed databases (September 2019 to March 
2021).  These  searches  returned  n = 76  results,  which  after 
duplicates  were  removed  left  n = 30  articles.  After  title  and 
abstract  screening,  there  were  n = 4  articles  which  were 
screened  at  full-text  with  expert  review,  and  consequently 
n = 2  additional  empirical  papers  were  included  in  the  final 
realist  synthesis.  The  total  number  of  papers  included  from 
the  two  searches  were  n = 17  (see  Table  2).

2.7.  Data  synthesis

The  aim  of  the  data  synthesis  was  to  refine  the  Initial 
Theory  through  realist  synthesis  methods  to  produce  a 
Programme  Theory.  Early  publications  describing  the  realist 
review  process  contain  little  guidance  about  the  synthesis 

3.2.  Study  characteristics

The  majority  of  the  17  empirical  studies  included  (n = 14) 
were  published  from  2013  onwards,  indicating  a  growing 
field  of  research.  None  of  the  studies  were  conducted  in  the

UK,  with  only  one  study  (Netherlands)  based  outside  of 
North  America  (USA  n = 12;  Canada  n = 4).  The  most  fre-
quently  considered  sample  characteristics  were  sexuality,  age 
(range  12–20 years),  gender,  and  ethnicity  e.g.  Latinx,  Pacific 
Island  and  First  Nations  peoples,  but  Asian  ethnicities  were 
less  represented.  Most  included  studies  involved  survey 
questionnaires  (n = 12),  there  were  few  qualitative  designs 
(n = 2),  mixed  methods  (n = 1),  and  pilot  programmes  (n = 2). 
However,  most  of  these  studies  also  drew  on  very  large  sam-
ple  sizes  (e.g.  55,599),  with  data  gathered  using  vali-
dated  tools.

The  interventions  most  frequently  considered  in  the 
(n = 7), 
studies  were  Gay-Straight  Alliances 

included 

followed  by  health-based  programmes  (n = 4).  Some  studies 
explored  GSAs  in  isolation  (n = 3),  whilst  other  interventions 
considered  school  policies  and  climate  (n = 2),  as  well  a 
film-based  intervention  (n = 1).  The  most  frequently  consid-
ered  mental  health  outcome  in  the  included  studies  was  sui-
cidality  (n = 8),  other  outcomes  were  self-esteem  (n = 3)  and 
coping  (n = 2).  Wellbeing,  depression  and  anxiety,  purpose  in 
life,  mastery,  and  sense  of  agency  were  also  measured  in 
some  studies  (see  supplemental  Appendix  2  for  included 
studies  characteristics).

3.3.  Programme  theory

final 

theory 

detailing 

programme 

The 
the 
context-mechanism-outcome  configurations  for  school-based 
interventions  is  outlined  in  Table  3.  Explaining  why  and 
how  an  intervention  may  have  an  impact  on  mental  health 
is  complex  (and  under-researched).  To  help  make  explicit 
and  theorise  “what  changes”  and  “how  it  changes”  as  a 
result  of  an  intervention,  we  developed  Dalkin’s  (2015)  dual 
concept  of  mechanism  –  intervention  resource  and  response 
mechanism  –  and  added  a  new  third  mechanism  factor 
which  we  called  the  “vector  of  change.”  The  inclusion  of  the 
new  concept  of  “vector  of  change”  was  to  capture  the  mul-
tiple  causal  pathways  at  which  a  mental  health  intervention 
may  work  e.g.  psychological,  behavioural,  emotional,  envi-
ronmental,  social.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Programme  Theory  was 
developed  as  a  “whole-school  approach”  but  the  context  in 
which the intervention was delivered was often under-reported 

774

e. McDeRMott et Al.

and  unexamined  in  the  included  empirical  studies.  We 
found  only  three  key  contextual  factors  in  the  included 
studies  that  were  important  to  the  success  of  school-based 
interventions  that  improved  LGBTQ+  young  people’s  mental 
health.  Firstly,  a  positive  baseline  (before  intervention  deliv-
ery)  school  culture  towards  sexual  and  gender  diversity  was 
highlighted.  Secondly,  the  presence  of  a  member  of  educa-
tion  staff  or  pupil  who  “championed”  LGBTQ+  pupil  equal-
ity  and  worked  toward  achieving  a  LGBTQ+  inclusive 
environment. Thirdly, where interventions were implemented 
in  schools  with  national  legal,  policy  and  economic  direc-
tives  that  specifically  addressed  LGBTQ+  equality,  they  were 
more  likely  to  be  successful  in  improving  LGBTQ+  pupil 
mental  health  outcomes.

Mechanism 1 in the Programme Theory (Table 3) focused 
on  the  intervention  resources  and  contained  eight  compo-
nents  that  aimed  to  reduce  LGBTQ+  adolescent  poor  mental 
health  burden.  The  original  Initial  Theory  contained  seven 
components,  we  have  added  an  eighth  component,  “a  trusted 
adult  to  talk  to,”  that  the  included  studies  suggested  was 
important  to  reducing  poor  mental  health.  Across  the 

literature  we  reviewed,  there  was  evidence  that  a  combina-
tion  of  these  components  was  most  likely  to  be  successful  in 
reducing  the  poor  mental  health  of  LGBTQ+  young  people.
Mechanism  2  “vectors  of  change”  in  the  Programme 
Theory  addresses  the  multiple  causal  pathways  (psychologi-
cal,  behavioural,  emotional,  environmental,  social)  at  which 
a  particular  mental  health  intervention  component  may 
work.  We  identified  five  vectors  of  change  through  which 
the  intervention  component  may  work:  the  school  environ-
ment  and  culture  becoming  more  LGBTQ+  inclusive;  rela-
tionships  and  interactions  between  individuals  (both  pupil 
to  pupil  and  staff  and  pupil)  becoming  less  hostile  and  more 
connected;  individual  behaviours  and  actions  changing;  indi-
vidual  LGBTQ+  pupils  thoughts  and  beliefs  about  the  self-
improving  e.g.  self-esteem,  positive 
identity  orientation; 
individual  affect,  feelings  &  emotions  becoming  less  prob-
lematic.  The  literature  suggested  that  these  five  vectors  of 
change  may  co-occur.

Mechanism  3  “cognition”  or  “response  mechanism” 
explains  how  the  intervention  effects  the  individual  actor’s 
reasoning  and  response  to  intervention  components.  Here

sustain  actions 

regarding  LGBTQ+ 

we  have 
importance  of  “affirmation”  of 
LGBTQ+  identities  to  improving  self-esteem,  self-acceptance, 
confidence,  and  validation.  “Agency”  as  a  capacity  to  initiate 
and 
status,  and 
“Advocacy”  as  a  process  of  empowerment  to  change  school 
culture.  “Belonging”  to  the  school  and  feeling  included  was 
an  important  factor  in  good  mental  health  for  LGBTQ+ 
pupils  especially 
loneliness. 
Relatedly,  school  connectedness  and  feeling  similar  to  others 
(peers  and  staff)  improved  mental  health.  “Coping”  this  was 
both  individual  coping  with  hostility,  invisibility  or  misgen-
dering but also includes group problem solving. “Recognition” 
of  LGBTQ+  identity,  the  synthesis  suggested,  was  important 
to  validating  LGBTQ+  young  people  within  school.  Feeling 
“safe”  and  without  fear  was  crucial  to  improving  LGBTQ+ 
youth  mental  health.  The  final  mechanism  “usualising”  was 
the  feeling  that  being  LGBTQ+  was  accepted  and  “normal” 
in  school  culture.  In  our  theoretical  development,  it  was  evi-
dent  that  these  cognitive  processes  would  co-occur  and  be 
inter-related.

Overall,  the  evidence  suggested  that  interventions  that 
seek  to  make  the  school  environment  more  inclusive  for 
LGBTQ+  young  people  can  improve  mental  health  outcomes 
by  both  reducing  poor  mental  health  e.g.  suicidal  feelings 
and  depression,  and  increasing  factors  associated  with  good 
mental  health  e.g.  self-esteem  and  coping.  However,  the  lack 
of  evidence  on  the  contextual  factors  in  which  interventions 
are  successfully  delivered  limits  our  understanding  of  how 
inclusivity  in  schools  can  be  promoted.  The  Programme 
Theory  we  have  developed  attempts  to  elucidate  the  under-
pinning  mechanisms  that  explain  how  and  why  these  inter-
ventions may work to improve LGBTQ+ youth mental health.

4.  Discussion

i.e. 

for 

intervention 

This  realist  review  has  developed  a  programme  theory  of 
how,  why,  for  whom  and  in  what  context  school-based 
interventions  prevent  or  reduce  mental  health  problems  in 
LGBTQ+  adolescents.  To  improve  the  mental  health  of 
to  “work” 
the 
LGBTQ+  pupils 
school-based 
interventions  must  address  specifically  the 
marginalisation,  silence,  victimisation,  and  misrecognition 
that  LGBTQ+  pupils  experience  within 
the  dominant 
cis-heteronormative  school  environment.  The  pervasiveness 
of  learning  in  a  school  culture  that  excludes  pupils  whose 
sexual  and  gender  is  at  odds  with  the  dominant  norms  was 
noted  by  many  scholars  whose  work  contributed  to  our 
review.  The  literature  we  engaged  with  suggested  that  to 
change  the  school  environment  to  improve  LGBTQ+  pupils 
mental health requires a multi-level approach (Hatzenbuehler, 
2009;  Saewyc,  2011)  or  in  the  UK,  this  has  been  termed  the 
inclusivity 
whole-school  approach 
(Formby,  2015;  Mitchell  et  al.,  2016;  UNESCO,  2016).

to  LGBTQ+  school 

The  strength  of  the  whole-school  approach  is  that  the 
intervention  aims  to  change  the  school  environment  at  the 
structural,  cultural,  and  individual  level.  This  is  because 
hostility,  discrimination  and  bullying  on  the  basis  of  per-

from  individuals  or  groups  but  rather  reflects  (and  upholds) 
cis-heteronormativity  (dominant  norms  surrounding  gender 
as  a  binary  and  heterosexuality).  Developing  a  LGBTQ+ 
inclusive  school  environment  needs  policies  that  specifically 
tackle  HBT  bullying  and  discrimination  (in  staff  and  pupils), 
and  policies  that  promote  equality  across  gender  and  sexual 
diversity.  It  includes  staff  training  and  support  for  imple-
menting  such  policies  and  an  inclusive  curriculum,  provid-
ing  school  resources  for  LGBTQ+  support  and  activism 
(along  with  allies)  and  ensuring  there  are  school  staff  that 
LGBTQ+  pupils  can  talk  to  and  trust.  This  all  creates  better 
relationships  in  school  between  staff  and  pupils  where  trust, 
care,  belonging,  connection,  and  confidence  can  flourish, 
and  mental  health  can  improve.

Across  the  literature  we  reviewed,  scholars  worldwide 
were  struggling  with  similar  difficulties  in  trying  to  under-
stand  the  problem  and  provide  solutions.  The  background 
for  each  paper  was  the  marginalisation  and  stigmatisation  of 
young  LGBTQ+  lives,  the  impact  that  school  life  had  on 
the  dearth  of  appropriate 
their  mental  health,  and 
school-based  interventions  aimed  at  generating  an  inclusive 
environment  and  improving  mental  health.  Often,  scholars 
noted  the  absence  of  policy  attention  to  the  matter  of 
LGBTQ+  pupils’  difficulties  in  schools.  We  need  more 
research  and  datasets  that  can  examine  how  best  to  address 
the  school  mental  health  of  LGBTQ+  pupils.  Our  realist 
review  exposed  the  limited  evidence  of  the  various  contex-
tual  factors  that  may  be  important  to  the  success  of  inter-
ventions.  For  example,  does  the  ethnic  composition  of  the 
school  matter  (probably  yes)?  Does  religion?  Or  socioeco-
nomic  status?  How  should  interventions  be  delivered  and 
implemented?  When  and  by  who?  Research  of  this  nature 
requires  both  large  datasets  that  better  measure  interven-
tions  and  different  mental  health  outcomes,  but  we  also 
need  qualitative  research  that  explores  how  and  why  school 
culture  can  change,  and  the  contextual  factors  that  impact 
on  the  effectiveness  of  interventions.

The  strength  of  our  realist  review  is  that  it  provides  a  base-
line  theoretical  understanding  for  why  and  how  school-based 
interventions  might  improve  mental  health  for  LGBTQ+  young 
people.  Much  of  the  literature  we  reviewed  had  limited  data  on 
how  the  interventions  may  or  may  not  work,  with  some  notable 
exceptions  such  as  Saewyc  (2011).  A  further  strength  of  the 
Programme  Theory  is  that  it  is  drawn  from  a  synthesis  of 
empirical  data  from  a  range  of  disciplines  (psychology,  public 
health,  sociology,  social  work),  a  national  evaluation  of  a  UK 
anti-bullying 
intervention,  theories  that  explain 
LGBTQ+  youth  mental  health  disparities  and  the  direct  per-
spectives  of  LGBTQ+  young  people.

in  schools 

However,  the  review  is  limited  partially  by  the  limitations 
of  the  empirical  studies  we  were  able  to  locate  (we  acknowl-
edge  our  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  was  limited  by  lan-
guage).  Often  scholars  where  relying  on  already  existing 
data and “matching” this with created variables. Consequently, 
there  was  a  variation  in  the  demographic  characteristics 
reported,  the  terms  used,  and  how  different  groups  are  cat-
egorised.  In  addition,  the  included  studies  lacked  an  inter-
sectional  perspective  on  LGBTQ+  identities;  particularly 
attention  on  the  variation  between  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,

transgender,  and  diverse  gender  identities,  as  well  as  other 
intersectional  characteristics,  such  as  ethnicity,  poverty, 
rurality,  and  disability.  The  use  of  pre-existing  large-scale 
surveys  introduces  a  restrictive  dynamic  to  the  questions 
and  ideas  explored  by  the  studies,  potentially  limiting  the 
granularity  of  detail  available  for  a  realist  review.  This  also 
explains  why  there  was  a  dearth  of  research  on  the  contex-
tual  factors  in  which  interventions  can  be  successfully  deliv-
ered.  As  a  consequence,  there  was  not  adequate  evidence  to 
fully  plot  the  causal  pathways  and  detail  the  generative 
causal  connections.  Realist  reviews  also  have  methodological 
limitations 
the 
theory-orientated  method.  It  is  impossible  to  record  every 
single  decision,  and  a  realist  approach  does  not  comply  with 
the  “reproducibility  principle” 
(Pawson  et  al.,  2004). 
Consequently,  realise  reviews  deliver  tentative  and  fallible 
findings,  and  there  is  “no  certitude”  in  terms  of  recommen-
dations  (Pawson  et  al.,  2004).

Despite  these  limitations,  this  realist  review  provides  the  first 
baseline theoretical understanding for why and how school-based 
interventions  might  improve  mental  health  for  LGBTQ+  young 
people.  This  is  a  starting  point;  it  should  now  be  developed 
through  empirical  refinement  to  improve  understanding  of  the 
contextual  factors  in  which  successful  school-based  interventions 
are  delivered,  and  the  causal  pathways  that  reduce  LGBTQ+ 
pupil  poor  mental  health.  Researchers  should  also  endeavour  to 
explore  early  and  preventative  school-based 
interventions 
amongst  younger  LGBTQ+  groups.

Notes

  1.  We  use  LGBTQ+  to  refer  collectively  to  sexual  minority  and 
gender  diverse  identities  because  of  the  proliferation  of  terms 
used  by  young  people.  References  to  other  research  use  the 
author’s  original  terminology  for  sexuality/gender.
