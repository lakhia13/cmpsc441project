With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world ex-
press panic in various behaviors. This aﬀects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress
of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the
panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The
researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and ac-
tions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both ana-
lyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p = 0.028) in the
Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p = 0.000) also shows on the
Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also con-
ceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indiﬀerence, Annihilation,
Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past
Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection,
Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent re-
gardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients. Lastly, spectrum of panic consequences due to COVID-
19 pandemic were constructed.

1. Introduction

In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19;
previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported to spread from Wuhan,
China that eventually aﬀected 26 countries worldwide (Xu et al., 2020).
It is a person-to-person transmission however, it is still not proven to
come from an asymptomatic carrier with normal chest computed to-
mography ﬁndings (Bai et al., 2020). As of writing, there are already
around 300,000 conﬁrmed cases, around 10,000 deaths and almost
100,000 recovered (World Health Organization, 2020).

With the vast number of people being aﬀected in just a short period
of time, it overwhelms countries that result in being unable to provide
health care, maintain the society of their community, or keeping the
function of the economy. This could cause the disruption of the world
economy, decline of stock markets, scarcity of supplies, worsening
political instability, and governments losing hundreds of billions of
revenues (Miller, 2006).

This kind of global pandemic elicits various reactions from people
depending on cultural orientations. Media communication may appear
either accurate and eﬀective to inform the public. However, it can also
misinform and contribute to unnecessary public panic and result in

undesirable responses (Jones et al., 2010). Real infections diseases have
a vigorous psychological eﬀect that becomes “moral panic” that spreads
globally and is accompanied by a true sense of stigma (Gilman, 2010).
Moral panic is an extreme sense of concern about a threat that is
perceived as destruction to physical safety or culture of the society
(Goode, 2017). It is often used by journalists to describe how politicians
and other media institutions attempt
to incite (McRobbie and
Thornton, 1995). It diﬀers from social anxiety by the level of concern of
safety. Social anxiety deals respectively on the basic issue whereas
moral panic, together with the awareness of industrial risks, were
mostly included in a discourse of safety (Ungar, 2001).

One of the reasons for this panic is that the information from the
experts were not disseminated enough to reach the community at the
lack of information and mis-
right time (Greco, 2005). Likewise,
information, often fueled by exaggerated popular media headlines and
foci, have been shown to reinforce health-related fears and phobias
(Taylor and Asmundson, 2004).

Another study found out that in times of any epidemic, social re-
sponses simultaneously appear as epidemic develops as well as the
awareness of people. This is due to the urge of people to gain rationality
over the problem (Panter-Brick and Fuentes, 2009). Other than

managing the society, it is burdensome to manage public panic since it
is an existential state (Schmidt et al., 2002). Criteria of panic attacks
include the following:: recurrent unexpected panic attacks, persistent
concern about subsequent attacks, worrying about the eﬀects of the
attack such as losing control, having a heart attack, and going crazy
insane, and a signiﬁcant change in behavior that is related to the attacks
(Craske and Barlow, 2007). It could simply be deﬁned as the arousal of
fear appearing at an inappropriate time (Barlow, 2004).

This panic results in egoism such as panic buying, xenophobia and
believing in every news item seen in social media. Crisis is created when
there
(Alalykin-
Izvekov, 2017) that is very evident in the behavior of Filipinos since the
announcement of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. People are always
willing to share its resources within the family but too reluctant to share
it to other people because of the need to secure their individual de-
velopment (Thayer, 2009). This can be seen as people were seen
hoarding basic necessities especially alcohol, toilet paper, and other
supplies (Madarang, 2020). With this, other people are left scarce of the
supplies and now subject to danger. Burks (1966) calls it psychological
egoism. It is a view that all reasonable desires are completely egoistic in
nature.

It is also very evident that people tend to exploit resources in times
of wide distress. Since the start of the COVID-19 scare, the majority of
business establishments took the opportunity to increase prices on the
basic necessities. Fortunately, the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) issued a price freeze to control the suggested retail price of these
basic necessities. However, the creativity of business owners still arose
to take advantage of the situation. Supplies were hoard and were of-
fered online at a much greater price. These acts violate the Consumer
Act or Republic Act (RA) No. 7394 where overpricing is considered as
an unfair sales act that involves taking advantage of consumers in times
of need (Rivas, 2020).

Furthermore, the increasing number of COVID-19 cases emancipate
xenophobic behavior directed to chinese people (Aguilera, 2020).
Chinese nationals have been banned from some restaurants, and cruise
ship operators have declared prohibitions on Chinese nationals from
traveling on their cruise ships (e.g., Evelyn, 2020; Lowen, 2020). There
are 32% of U.S. respondents in the Morning Consult poll accusing the
Chinese government for the spread of COVID-19 into the U.S. The in-
creasing number of infection-related xenophobia has been reported in
many previous epidemics and pandemics, and appears to be an in-
appropriately common response when people are threatened with an

political issues in the country. The reactions were more ignited by the
conﬁrmation bias in which the tendency to interpret information in a
the previously acquired preconceptions
manner
(Miller et al., 2009). The concern from the spread of disease was quickly
turned into an argument of those who agree with the government and
those with the opposition. In addition, the problem with the mis-
information and disinformation also circulates the social media where
more false speculations arise..

An emerging line of research exploring what might be called mis-
information studies is trying to understand how and why fake beliefs
arise during public health crises. Media coverage of the new cor-
onavirus is still unfolding and has not yet been rigorously analyzed. But
a study of two earlier epidemics that arrived just as new reports about
COVID-19 continued to mount reveals the diﬃculty in reversing false
rumors about a health crisis (Stix, 2020).

Panic attack is a distinct episode of anxiety. It is usually char-
acterized by pounding heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath,
feelings of choking, chest pain, nausea, stomach ache, dizziness, de-
realization, depersonalization, feeling of losing control, overwhelming
fear of death, tingling, and chills (Berman, 2009). Living during this
time of pandemic is a new experience to the majority of the population
all over the world. COVID-19 may not be the most lethal but it is one of
the pandemics that paralyzes not only our society but also our psy-
chological well being. Hearing news including the spread of mis-
information all over the places, people experience catastrophic mis-
interpretation of bodily sensations, a distinctive characteristic of panic
disorder (Ohst and Tuschen-Caﬃer, 2018). Previous studies identiﬁed a
wide range of factors that contribute to health anxiety. This includes
dysfunctional illness beliefs, catastrophic misinterpretation, somato-
sensory ampliﬁcation and neuroticism (Bailey and Wells, 2016). Hence,
the rationale of this study is to investigate the consequences of this
panic due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

This study delved into the panic of Filipinos during the COVID-19
pandemic in the Philippines. Speciﬁcally, it focused on psychological
eﬀects such as health anxiety, severity of avoiding the situation that
causes fear or other unpleasant feelings, seeking reassurance about
health. Likewise, the thought, experienced particular feeling and the
action taken after the existence of COVID-19 will also be explored.

2. Methodology

2.1. Research design

On another note,

the ﬁrst conﬁrmed COVID-19 case in the
Philippines was on March 7, 2020. With the rapid growth of cases in the
Philippines, various government agencies released a resolution on
March 12, 2020 regarding the management of COVID-19 situation. It
includes the suspension of classes in all levels, the prohibition of mass
gathering, and ruling on community quarantine (Duque et al., 2020).
This elicited panic responses from the aﬀected areas. The situation was
worsened by the reactions in social media especially in the midst of

This mixed methods study was used to address the panic responses
of Filipinos with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fig. 1 shows the
convergent parallel mixed methods design was utilized where both
qualitative and quantitative data are collected in parallel, analyzed
separately, then merged (Creswell and Clark, 2011). The ﬁrst phase was
to gather data through online form that contains both quantitative and
qualitative questionnaires. For the quantitative part, the Health Anxiety
Inventory (HAI) Short Week was adapted to test the Illness Anxiety on
COVID-19 among Filipinos. There are four sections in the health anxiety

inventory. The main section is composed of symptoms of health anxiety
(hypochondriasis). The second section comprises questions about peo-
ple's attitudes to how awful it would be if they were to develop a
particular illness. This is scored separately and is regarded as a treat-
ment process measure. Ratings of avoidance and reassurance seeking
are also included. The Health Anxiety Inventory main section is scored
on a 0 – 3 basis and the section total is used. For the short version this is
the ﬁrst 14 questions. Four questions regarding usefulness are then
totalled separately. Reassurance and avoidance seeking are simply to-
talled but the “other” items in each are not included in the total
(Salkovskis et al., 2002). Afterwards, the qualitative data that was
gathered through an open-ended question explored the reaction of Fi-
lipinos regarding the spread of COVID-19. The reason for collecting
both qualitative and quantitative data is to corroborate results from the
two forms of data to come up with a better insight on the problem than
what would be gathered by either type of data separately. Thus in the
second phase of the study, the responses were analyzed separately re-
sulting in separate qualitative and quantitative outcomes. Lastly, the
respondents who acquired extreme scores from the quantitative ques-
tionnaires were extracted to diﬀerentiate their panic responses towards
COVID-19.

Due to limitation of social contact and urgency of this study, the
researchers decided to gather data through online forms. The instru-
ments were posted on various social media platforms to gather wider
reach of data for a more generalizable result. The researchers adapted
the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI)-Short Week and included three
open-ended questions:

1. What came to your mind when you knew the existence of COVID-

19?

2. How do you feel when you know the existence of COVID-19?
3. What actions have you done with the knowledge of existence of

COVID-19

2.2. Description of respondents

Researchers gathered both quantitative and qualitative data
through online forms. Respondents were reached through convenience
sampling. A total of 538 responses were analyzed that consisted of 253
(47%) working, 41 (7.6%) non-working and 244 (45.4%) students. The
breakdown of respondents could be due to the access to technology
since working and studying Filipinos have at least a gadget to access
online forms. Another reason could be the non-working respondents do
not appreciate the relevance of answering online forms since they are
prioritizing more their survival.

Furthermore, the average age is 23.82 ranging from 13 to 67 years
old. This also proves that most of the adolescents are active in using
social media and the internet. The exposure to patients with COVID-19
was also surveyed with 7 (1.3%) direct exposure, 391 (72.7%) no ex-
posure and 140 (26.0%) exposure within the community. During the
time of writing, there are still few cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines
and is concentrated in the capital region.

2.3. Data analysis

Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed simulta-
neously from the results gathered in the online platform. Qualitative
data were analyzed with the use of Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences version 21. Mean and Standard Deviation were utilized to
acquire the level of Health Anxiety (symptoms of hypochondriasis, at-
titude to how awful if COVID-19 were developed, avoidance, and re-
assurance seeking) among respondents. Furthermore, to compare the
Health Anxiety between locations (within and outside Metro Manila),
Mann–Whitney U were utilized due to the imbalance of representation
between groups. Kruskal–Wallis Analysis of Variance were also used to
compare the means between exposure (no exposure, exposure within

the community, and with direct exposure). Lastly, an inductive way of
thematic analysis was conducted to extract the themes directed by the
content of the data.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Limitations

The data were gathered through an online survey with a total of 538
responses. Though the sample size was not enough to generalize for the
whole population, the researchers recommend validating the results on
further studies. In addition, the proﬁles of the respondents in terms of
exposure to COVID-19 and location were not equally distributed thus
nonparametric statistical analysis were used. The qualitative data
gathering could have been more thorough through the use of a face-to-
face interview, however, due to the implementation of community
this has not been possible.
quarantine and physical distancing,
Moreover, the online survey only lasted for three days, hence the
continuance of data gathering is advised to explore the changes of
health anxiety across time. Lastly, there are very limited literature and
studies with regards to the eﬀects of COVID-19 to the panic of people
since this is the only pandemic experienced in this generation that
imposed this much safety protocols.

3.2. Quantitative results

The online survey ran for three days gathering a total of 538 re-
sponses. The researchers hypothesized that there is no signiﬁcant dif-
ference on the Health Anxiety between Locations and Exposure. In
general, the level of Health Anxiety in all domains of HAI were mod-
erate. Since the result was tested on the ﬁrst two weeks of the lock-
down, there might have been changes on the levels afterwards. Thus the
researchers left the online survey to further study the changes of Health
Anxiety in relation to the duration of lockdown.

Table 1 shows the level of Illness Anxiety among respondents. It is
very evident that respondents are suﬀering from moderate illness an-
xiety in all aspects: symptoms of hypochondriasis, attitude on acquiring
COVID-19, avoidance, and reassurance seeking behavior. This means
that the level of illness anxiety was not that high that it requires
emergency psychological intervention and not too low that should be
neglected.

Table 2 shows the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in illness anxiety between
locations. Results show that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence on the
symptoms of hypochondriasis, attitude on acquiring COVID, and re-
assurance seeking behavior. However, it reveals that there is a sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in avoidance behavior with respondents residing
inside Metro Manila (M = 29.59, SD=10.26) has less avoidance be-
havior than those living outside Metro Manila (M = 31.76, SD=11.13).
Possible reasons would be the diﬀerences on awareness, education, and
proximity to COVID cases.

Table 3 shows the test of diﬀerence on illness anxiety between ex-
posure to COVID 19. Results show that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in attitude towards acquiring COVID-19, avoidance, and reassurance
behavior. However, it reveals that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
(p<0.00) on symptoms of hypochondriasis. Respondents with direct

contact with COVID-19 patients has higher symptoms (M = 32.29,
SD=7.32), followed by exposure within the community (M = 31.36,
SD=7.02), and lastly, without exposure (M = 27.70, SD=6.61). It can
be inferred that symptoms of hypochondriasis rises as people become in
closer proximity with COVID-19 patients.

The rise of research regarding the psychological eﬀects of COVID-19
focuses on the anxiety, existential crises and interventions in which a
signiﬁcant number came from China. This research is few of the initial
studies exploring the psychological consequences and impact of the
pandemic outside China. A study shows that generalized anxiety dis-
order, depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality were very prevalent
during this pandemic (Huang and Zhao, 2020). Another study shows
that people mostly aﬀected by this pandemic are women, people with
existing psychiatric illness, people living in urban areas and those with
preexisting chronic disease (Özdin and Bayrak Özdin, 2020).
Tan et al. (2020) found out in their study that nonmedical health care
personnel are more prone to develop psychological distress during this
outbreak. Most of these researches focus on the levels of speciﬁc psy-
chological distresses of the pandemic however, none of these explored
on the qualitative eﬀects similar to the results of this study.

Qualitative results

Fig. 2 shows the eﬀect of COVID-19 to the panic among Filipinos.
From the 1993 responses of 538 respondents exploring the feeling,
thinking, and behavior caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the fol-
lowing themes were extracted: Health Consciousness, Optimism, Cau-
tiousness, Protection, Compliance, Composure,
Information Dis-
semination, Worry on self/family/others, Relating to Past Pandemics,
Anxiety, Government Blaming, Shock, Transmission of Virus, Fear,
Sadness, Paranoia, Nihilism, Annihilation, and Indiﬀerence. These
themes were ranked by one hundred (100) experts based on the posi-
tivity and negativity of the themes. The researchers ﬁnalized the fra-
mework to create a spectrum of panic consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic from the most pessimistic to the most optimistic.

3.3. Health consciousness

One eﬀect of COVID-19 is health consciousness. It is deﬁned as a
dominant way of thinking about personal habits from the diet to the
lifestyle one has such as sleeping patterns and exercise. All are done to
maintain or regain health (Nuriddin, 2018).

People became health conscious to boost the immune system – a
way to prevent self from being infected. It is done by simultaneously
checking their health status such as body temperature:

“I often check my health issues and body temperature.”

People also start to eat healthy foods to regain their immune system.
When asked about their behavior after the announcement of arrival of
COVID-19, they responded:

“Eating healthy foods, gaining back my immune system”

According to Ferreira et al. (2017), there are ﬁve levels of health
consciousness: Medically Dependent Health Consciousness,
Illness-
Centered Health Consciousness, Informed Health Consciousness, En-
lightened Health Consciousness, and Transformative Health Con-
sciousness. These responses fall under Illness-Centered Health Con-
sciousness that is deﬁned as only a reaction to illnesses and only takes
for a short period of time to help recover or prevent from having illness.
These behaviors are usually not sustained over time.

Furthermore, this behavior is also done to prevent older people – in

which are more prone from acquiring the disease:

“I sometimes check myself if I am having symptoms because I am afraid
for the elderly that they might get this infectious disease especially my
parents.”

Also included here is the constant sanitation and hygienic practice:

“I try to keep myself safe from the virus by wearing mask everytime I go
outside and sanitizing my hands”

3.4. Optimism

On the other hand, optimism is also seen. It is deﬁned as a personal
attitude that primarily focuses on the most desirable aspects of a si-
tuation. Despite the spread of COVID-19, people still sees the light of
overcoming this by trusting the scientists:

“COVID-19 has instilled fear among many, but scientists all over the
world are there and ready to ﬁght back.”

Also, the hope of resolving this on a short amount of time:

“It will easily be spreaded but it will be addressed in a short period
of time.”

According to a study by Ingledew and Brunning (1999), preventive
health behavior has a positive eﬀect on comparative optimism. Fur-
thermore, optimism is also revealed to be one of the key components of
resilience (Boldor et al., 2012).

3.5. Cautiousness

Moreover, along with health consciousness, people also start to be
cautious on the sanitation of the surroundings. When asked on their
behavior after the awareness of COVID-19, they responded with:

“A little more cautious about the cleanliness of myself and my sur-
roundings.”

“I need to be extra careful and aware of the environment, especially
my health.”

“I try to keep myself safe from the virus by wearing mask everytime
I go outside and sanitizing my hands”

This also includes the government mandate social distancing in
which people are requested to keep at least one meter away from each
other to avoid transmission of COVID-19:

“Wearing face masks, bringing alcohol, trying to go home as soon as
possible, staying away from crowded places, as much as possible.”

“Maintained my hygiene practices, continued staying at home, not
engaging with people who are being loud and irrational about it,
the virus and more tips on how to prevent
learning about

contracting it, and staying calm.”

In addition, upon exposing themselves from COVID-19 prone area,

they voluntarily enter self-quarantine:

“Self-quarantine myself at home and share reliable news about it.”

Also, to avoid further contact with others on the following days,
people starts to buy necessities ahead of time:

“Cleaned and sanitized the whole house where I live. And went
to the groceries to buy and stock canned goods.”

3.6. Protection

Alongside cautiousness, people are also compliant with the in-
dividual protective measures to avoid acquiring COVID-19 such as
wearing face mask and frequent use of alcohol:

“Wearing face masks when going out, washing hands, and using al-
cohol.”

“I take extra precautions to make sure that my family and I are pro-
tected from the virus through proper handwashing.”

“Buy masks - wear it every time I go out. Bought alcohol - use it
every time I touch or hold things in public and wash my hand with
alcohol. I do not touch my face.

Aside from the medical bodies, local government units also released
recommendations on suspension of work and public transportation to
maintain community quarantine and lockdown. Residents of Luzon
especially Metro Manila were also compliant:

“Being extra careful of many things mostly with going out of our
house. I didn't go outside our house when the community quarantine
was announced.”

3.8. Composure

Another positive panic outcome is the composure. It is when people
still remain their sanity and calmness even in times of crisis. Reasons
would be the trust on the experts and current advances on science:

“Staying calm and practicing preventive measures. Remember, we
have modern technology on our side.”

Furthermore, it also helped alleviate the composure of people by
gaining more knowledge regarding COVID-19. Social media has a good
feature on spreading information, however, there is still a threat of
misinformation that leads to widespread panic due to faulty tweets
(Nguyen et al., 2012). Fake news heightens fear among people, how-
ever, reading valid and reliable source makes it easier to maintain
composure:

These protective gears include: face mask, alcohol, aerosol, gloves,
eye protection, and respiratory protections (Department of Health and
Human Services, 2020).

“I was alert at ﬁrst but I was able to maintain my calm and com-
posure. I made myself more vigilant through reading information
about the virus.”

3.7. Compliance

3.9. Information dissemination

Compliance in health psychology is deﬁned as the extent to which
the behavior of people coincides with the medical advice (Davey et al.,
2014). With the continuous eﬀorts of World Health Organization, Phi-
lippine Department of Health and other medical bodies to spread
awareness on how to avoid acquiring COVID-10, people becomes
compliant:

“Follow the preventive measures given by DOH & WHO.”

“Following whatever is being told by a professional health practitioner.”

Amidst the global crisis of COVID-19, the spread of misinformation
is still rampant. Fake news like this instills terror among people espe-
cially with the limitation to go outside to see the wider environment.
Moreover, it catalyzes the panic that is already present within the
community:

“Spread credible info and do my best to help others in any way I can
while making sure I am okay.”

Although proper awareness does not

outcome. A previous study during the Inﬂuenza A (H1N1) shows that
the higher the anxiety people have, the more compliant they will be to
the mandates of national and international authorities (Bults et al.,
2011). Moreover, to a larger scale:

“I share with my family and friends about the precautionary measures
for COVID-19. Also, the news updates regarding the virus and ask them
to take care of their health.”

“Felt scared of the possibilities that may happen.”

“Slightly became anxious of its global infection.”

Some individuals are also equipped with the skill of identifying fake
news from authentic news. This serves as an inhibitor to the spread of
much threatening articles:

“Not spreading fake news, spreading scientiﬁc tips to deal with
covid19, giving masks, and don't panic.”

3.10. Worry on self/family/others

Another theme that has become evident is the worry on acquiring
the COVID-19 for self, family and others. Worry on self mainly focuses
on preventing to infect family members especially those in older age in
which are more vulnerable to COVID-19:

“My mom's wellbeing and vulnerability to the virus.”

“Afraid not only for myself but especially for my family and love
ones.”

“I am thinking that I should not be infected because I have high risk
family members.”

“I often thought that I will cause problems if I ever get infected. I am
not scared of being sick at all, but I can't compromise my family's
health.”

Furthermore, people are also worried about the so-called frontli-
ners. These are the medical professionals that receive and take care of
the patients with COVID-19. They are the most vulnerable due to the
direct and prolonged exposure with those that are infected:

“Indiﬀerent. I focus on my survival all the time. However, it would be
nice if I had the capacity to help other medical professionals.”

Acute stress and media exposure on pandemics were seen to be
associated with greater psychological distress (Thompson et al., 2017).

3.13. Government blaming

With a very controversial line-up of government in the Philippines,
Filipinos often tend to channel their anxiety to the external locus of
control. The validity is unsure, however, respondents provided well-
explained responses regarding this issue. First one is the incompetence
of leaders. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it took the Philippine
government much time to prevent the spread compared to other
countries:

“It immediately made me think about the possible unfortunate
things that could happen if the existence of COVID-19 would already
spread to our country rapidly knowing that we have incompetent
leaders to manage the situation.”

Furthermore, another response says that one of the sources of an-
xiety was the way the government handled it. On a press-conference by
President Duterte, most of the speech were diverted to humor and other
issues than delving to the more immediate problem:

“To be honest, at ﬁrst I was scared upon knowing the existence of
COVID-19 but as I watched how the Philippine government handles
the disease, I've realized that I was only feeling scared because they
suck big time at managing this pandemic. Medical solution not
militar.”

Additionally, aside from the issues of the current government,
poverty and poor public health system and irresponsibility of citizens
was already a long time problem:

“That the public health system in the Philippines is very poor, and
there is minimal chance of recovering from COVID-19. Also, that the
government is unreliable and many Filipino citizens are irrespon-
sible.”

3.11. Relating to past pandemics

3.14. Shock

On a much lighter sense, when respondents were asked about their
thoughts when they knew COVID-19 was spread in the Philippines, they
often relate it to previous pandemics and plague:

Above the panic, worry, and anxiety, people were alarmed with the
outbreak since it is a problem not usually experienced thus results to
disorientation:

“Plague, re-existence of coronavirus.”

“Shocked and kind of afraid for the people.”

People minimizes the scare since the previous pandemics were

It is usually followed by fear and worry:

known to be contained at a short period of time:

“I wasn't shocked because there are similar ailments, like SARS.”

However, there are still some that relates this crisis on a much worse
sense that killed signiﬁcant amount of people:

“I thought it would be similar to the Black Plague that killed millions
of people.”

“Shock and worried about my friends,family and spouse about their
health and my own health”

However, there are still some that overcame their shock and re-

gained their composure:

“Shocked and panic but need to be calm.”

3.12. Anxiety

3.15. Transmission of virus

Since this crisis is diﬀerent from others for being contagious, people

Anxiety also emerged from the responses. It mainly deals on the

are starting to be curious on how it is spread:

excessive worrying about the further eﬀects of COVID-19 to self:

“I felt a bit of anxiety since I am daily exposed outside.”

Showing anxiety in times of pandemic could lead to a positive

“I wondered how contagious this disease is.”

A study shows that pandemics such as this are a good predictor of
sensitivity

contamination

anxiety,

disgust

fears,

and

health

C.J.C. Nicomedes and R.M.A. Avila

(Wheaton et al., 2012):

“I am afraid of catching the disease then unintentionally transmit-
ting it to others.”

Furthermore, the lack of visualization and knowledge of how it is

spread increases the worry of people:

Quite scary knowing that it did spread across countries but I already
knew that it would be pandemic knowing the situation as of now

3.16. Fear

It is very predictable to see fear in situations like this. The pre-
viously mentioned themes were seen to be the source of this emotion.
One source of fear is the scarcity of local government:

“Scary if it reaches the Philippines, because I know we lack re-
sources, budget and healthcare

Another is being infected due to exposure to people while com-

muting:

“Afraid that I might be one of the carriers of the virus since I'm a
commuter and exposed to diﬀerent people all the time, as well as
walking everyday near a chinese columbarium where Chinese
people roam around more often wearing masks.”

Due to fear, some media platforms use fear to advertise preventive
measures to avoid acquiring COVID-19. However, this is found to be
ineﬀective (Walsh, 2020).

3.17. Sadness

Journal of Affective Disorders 276 (2020) 14–22

inﬂuenza, people exposed with the epidemic had higher risk of devel-
oping schizophrenia, paranoid states and other non-organic psychoses

3.19. Nihilism

Nihilism is deﬁned as a condition in which people experience little
meaning, dimensionality, depth, or transcendent bearing in the world,
and where people feel empty or soulless (Fisher and Abram, 2013).
Some of the responses shows this by wishing to acquire COVID-19:

“I wish I had it at some point.”

“I will die this year.”

Furthermore, instead of hoping for positive outcome, some thinks of

losing lives with this COVID-19:

“That many lives will end. Including my loved ones.”

A study shows that widespread of fear elicits dangerous responses

such as nihilistic thoughts and decadent lifestyle (Eckersley, 2008):

“That we were doomed and die out of it like the plague.”

3.20. Annihilation

Above nihilism, some people see this crisis as annihilation.
Annihilation nulliﬁes everything and makes life into nothingness
(Landau, 2017). When asked about what they think upon perception of
COVID-19, some responded:

“Ghost town. End of the world.”

It is also seen as a solution for overpopulation since it kills vast

Another theme that was seen is sadness. It is usually combined with

the hope of ending it soon:

number of human beings:

“A solution for overpopulation.”

“It feels sad to think that it was already pandemic but I hope it'll end
soon.”

This feeling is also due to the awareness of its lethality:

“Sad? Scared? Worried? Because we know that COVID-19 is dan-
gerous and now a lot of people die because of this.”

Furthermore, it is still evident that this feeling is sourced from the

lack of trust with the current government:

“Sad. I knew that our healthcare system is not as advanced com-
pared to other countries. Our government cut our health budget, so I
felt so sad when I heard about the existence of this virus.”

Expression of sadness is very common in times like this. A study
done during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak shows that there are several
tweets pertaining to sadness and is commonly shared by other users
(Chew and Eysenbach, 2010).

3.18. Paranoia

When the number of cases reached more than a hundred, the gov-
ernment mandated the suspension of work and suggested a work from
home scheme. People were obliged to stay indoors and were not al-
lowed to roam around during the community quarantine. However,
despite the safety of this mandate, people still feels unsafe since the
transmission cannot be traced easily:

“When the WFH (work from home) initiative wasn't brought up yet, I
often felt paranoid when I was outside of my home; some of the hospitals
mentioned on DOH's list were near my workplace/home which made me
feel uneasy. I worried about my parents, too, since they're older and have
more chances of seeing fake news on their feeds.”

A study supports this result stating that during the time of 1957

Furthermore, individuals also thinks that it will take away peace

from the world:

“That it will cause chaos around the world and it'll aﬀect human
behavior, mental health etc.”

3.21. Indiﬀerence

Feelings of

Indiﬀerence were also prevalent

to the responses.
Indiﬀerence is a state in which a person wherein the individual stops
giving cease care and/or stops taking action on something happening
around him/her. People who are indiﬀerent can be seen as cold, aloof,
disinterested, unmotivated, and lacking in passion.

This may be the result of the emotional fatigue that came from the
overwhelming anxiety emancipated from the pandemic crisis, this leads
thus leading to Indiﬀerence.
to one's emotions being worn out,
Moreover, the negative thinking and distractions associated with an-
xiety from the current situation can ultimately lead to an apathetic
outlook about a speciﬁc crisis (Abraham, 2018).

“I was actually afraid to think that I would contract COVID-19 be-
cause I have asthma, allergic rhinitis and a compromised immune
system but then again, I've fallen indiﬀerent to what could possibly
happen to me anymore.”

“Nothing, come what may.”

3.22. Comparison between highest and lowest illness anxiety scorer

For the ﬁnal interpretation, the researchers extracted the highest
and lowest scorers from the Health Anxiety Inventory to compare the
thinking, feeling, and behavior among respondents.

According

to Lu (2015), diﬀerent

threats push diﬀerent

psychological triggers Novels and exotic threats live Ebola or avian ﬂu
raise and currently COVID-19, raise anxiety level higher than more
prevalent threats do. This reaction may have to do with our Amygdala
which research suggests that it engaged in detecting novelty as well as
processing fear. Thus, most respondents who neither score high or low
on Illness anxiety, attitude, avoidance or reassurance towards the virus
reported that they feel fear and anxiety:

‘’I got scared, what If I have those virus.’’

‘’It's scary because it's like an invisible enemy.’’

In relation to the overwhelming fear in the air and this is our ﬁrst
social media pandemic. This is the ﬁrst time we've had a pandemic
where the population heavily relies on social media, most people are
trying to make sense of all information they read or watched online,
share this with their family and friends that turns into this over-
abundance of information, a lot which isn't true. The bulk number of
social media users encountered ideologues who distrust science or
troublemakers intent on sowing confusion and distrust. For instance,
some sources spread news about fake cures preventive measures for
COVID-19 such as taking colloidal silver, steroids,acetic acid, essential
oils and even taking cocaine (Guynn, 2020). Consequently, based on
our results respondents who score high and low with attitude and low
with reassurance towards the virus reported that they gave importance
with proper Information Dissemination about COVID 19, they tend to
gather more genuine information about the virus, fact check and report
all sources who spread false informations, to lessen the panic and fear of
their family and community:

“I've researched about the COVID-19 and have made it a point to
share them with my friends and family in the hopes of NOT causing
panic but by reassuring them of the precautions we could take in-
dividually and as a group “

“I read diﬀerent kinds of journals and share news about covid with
reliable sources.”

Moreover, respondents who scored high on Reassurance, Avoidance
and Illness Anxiety and also surprisingly respondents who scored low on
Attitude towards the virus reported that they practice Social Distancing
and increase their Health Consciousness:

also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to
COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with
the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors:
Indiﬀerence, Annihilation, Nihilism,
Fear,
Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating
to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others,
Information
Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness,
Optimism, and Health Consciousness. Lastly, the common theme of
highest scorers on Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI) were Fear, Social
Distancing and Health Consciousness. and Information Dissemination
whereas the lowest scorers show disclosed Indiﬀerence and Nihilism.

“If possible, I'm not going outside our community and keep distance
with people and avoid crowded places.”

References

The overwhelming fear/anxiety that is evident to the extent that it
emancipates panic behavior exhibited through social withdrawal and
isolation even sacriﬁcing their day to day lifestyle and the increase in
health consciousness is noted.

“Minimized going out of the house. Started eating healthy like
eating fruits and vegetables everyday and taking vitamins everyday.
Always wearing a mask when going outside. Always have alcohol
with me. Social distance”

Lastly, respondents who scored high on Attitude and Avoidance re-
port Nihilism. In addition, respondents who score low on Illness Anxiety
exhibit Indiﬀerence towards the virus.

The apocalyptic point of view is manifested, the loss of hope and

inability to see the brighter future decamped:

‘’Ghost town. End of the world. Lose hope.’’

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, the level of Symptoms of Hypochondriasis, Attitude
on Acquiring COVID-19, Avoidance, and Reassurance Seeking of the
Filipinos is moderate. Results also show that there is a signiﬁcant dif-
ference in the Avoidance behavior between residents inside Metro
Manila and Outside Metro Manila. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
