Abstract: Although previous evidence suggests that happiness is lower among individuals with
obesity, research on the correlates of subjective well-being (SWB) is warranted to increase our
knowledge. We aim to explore excess weight (i.e., measured and self-reported body mass index
(BMI)), body image and satisfaction, self-stigma, positivity, and happiness among Spanish adults
with overweight or obesity. We further aim to investigate the predictors of SWB in this sample.
A convenience sample of 100 individuals with excess weight completed self-reports on the study
variables and were weighed and their height measured. On average, the participants reported body
perceptions revealing minor excessive weight, moderate body satisfaction,
low-to-moderate
weight-related stigma, and elevated positivity and happiness. BMI and gender/sex independently
aﬀected these variables, but there were no signiﬁcant interaction eﬀects. Furthermore, individuals
with overweight or obesity with higher body satisfaction and elevated positivity were more likely
to report being happy, independent of their age, gender/sex, weight, and weight-related stigma.
Mediation eﬀects were found for body satisfaction and positivity in the relationship between weight
and happiness. Moreover, positive orientation suppressed the pervasive inﬂuence of stigma on SWB.
Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the key role of body image dimensions and weight-related stigma for happiness
and add support to the relevance of positivity for overall well-being of individuals with excess
weight. These results may inform obesity management actions focused on inclusive aesthetic models,
combating social stigmatization and enhancing positivity for a ﬂourishing and fulﬁlling life.

1. Introduction

Given that body image is now widely recognized as an important public health concern because
of the increasing worldwide incidence of negative body perceptions and body dissatisfaction [1],
it is essential to understand body image issues among individuals with excessive weight. Research on
body image and body satisfaction in individuals with excess weight is extensive [2,3]. Most people
with excess weight perceive themselves as a person with overweight or obesity, even when they do not
have completely accurate perceptions of their weight. In addition, a positive correlation between body
mass index (BMI) and body dissatisfaction has been found. A considerable number of persons with
overweight and obesity are dissatisﬁed with their bodies and wish they were thinner [3–5]. Women with
obesity are signiﬁcantly more dissatisﬁed with their bodies compared to men with obesity [3,5].

Moreover, body weight is associated with psychosocial well-being in individuals with excessive
weight. It has been found that people with obesity experience weight-related prejudice, discrimination,
and stigma in many social areas,
including education, employment and healthcare contexts,
interpersonal and intimate relations, and mass media presentation [6,7]. As a consequence of weight
stigma, they also experience numerous and pervasive outcomes in terms of functioning, quality of life,
and well-being [8,9], including unsuccessful eﬀorts to manage excess weight, weight gain, and obesity
maintenance. Nonetheless, weight-related stigma has been scarcely investigated among Spanish adults
with excess weight (e.g., [10,11]).

Shape–weight concerns, weight-related stigma, and psychological distress have been found to
deﬁne in combination a psychosocial proﬁle of experiences with obesity among individuals with
excessive weight [12]. Besides psychopathological characteristics, unhealthy attitudes and behaviors,
the risk for diseases and eating disorders, weight-loss failure, and diminished quality of life, research on
positive states of well-being and protective factors conﬁguring alternative psychosocial proﬁles is,
unfortunately, scarce.

It has been observed that happiness is diminished among people with excess weight [13–16].
It is well established that subjective well-being (SWB) shows an inverse relationship with BMI [13,14,
17–19]. Moreover, the association between obesity and decreased happiness aﬀects females more than
males [18–21]. Research on the impacts of the obesity epidemic is essential; nonetheless, one relatively
neglected topic in the literature is the relationship of obesity with SWB [13]. There are only a few
studies on the happiness of Spanish individuals with obesity [10,11,22,23]. However, many individuals
with obesity are happy (e.g., [24,25]), and many more pursue the highest hedonic well-being and life
satisfaction as possible.

Positivity [26], a “trait-like basic disposition” characterized by a positive cognitive orientation
towards self, life, and future, lies at the core of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and optimism [27]. As such,
positivity has beneﬁcial eﬀects for optimal human functioning, achievement, and adaptation across life
domains and may act as a protective factor against mental illness. It has been proposed as a dispositional
component of SWB [27,28]. Positivity has not been previously studied among people living with excess
weight. Thus, one of the main contributions of the present study is to oﬀer some pioneer data on
positive orientation in individuals with excess weight and the relationship between positivity and
happiness when considering body satisfaction and weight-related stigma.

In sum, whereas research has been mostly focused on the harmful consequences of obesity for
psychological well-being, our main aim is to contribute by exploring happiness and its correlates
in individuals with excessive weight. Given that body dissatisfaction and self-stigma have been
consistently related to decreased functioning and well-being, we were interested in studying the
possible contribution of positive body image and positivity to SWB. Noteworthy, there is no study,
as far as we know, on positivity in individuals with obesity, and there is a scarcity of research conducted
with Spanish samples on self-stigma. Thus, our ﬁndings are expected to make a relevant contribution
to knowledge on the correlates of obesity. Speciﬁcally, in the present study, we aim to explore excess
weight (i.e., measured and self-reported BMI), body image and satisfaction, self-stigma, positivity,
and happiness among Spanish adults with overweight or obesity. We further aim to investigate

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4186

possible predictors of SWB among this population. We expected to ﬁnd that positive body perceptions,
body satisfaction, and a positive orientation would demonstrate a positive relationship with SWB,
whereas self-stigma would inversely predict the participants’ happiness.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Participants and Procedure

A total of 100 adults from 19 to 57 years old (average age: 42.03 ± 10.74, 60% women), residing in
southern Spain, voluntarily participated in the study. All participants had a BMI ≥ 25 (69% overweight:
45% overweight I, 24% overweight II; 31% obesity: 22% obesity I, 9% obesity II). No diﬀerences
were found for age between women and men, and between participants with overweight and
obesity either (see Table 1). All participants were white and had an average socioeconomic status
(Social class was determined by unifying education level, job status, and income. Following the
deﬁnition by the Health Determinants Taskforce of the Spanish Epidemiology Society, six categories
were established, which were regrouped into three: high (Class I–II), middle (Class III–IV), and low
social classes (Class V–VI) [29]). Recruitment was conducted with a convenient, nonprobabilistic
procedure according to the inclusion criteria (i.e., having overweight or obesity, not suﬀering from
severe physical and mental diseases, being 18–65 years old) in local medical settings.

Speciﬁcally, recruitment was conducted in two primary care consultations among individuals
with obesity, who consulted on weight and health during March 2019. After inviting the individuals
to voluntarily participate and after informing them about a study on well-being and health in adults
with excessive weight, the anonymous nature of the data, and the research participants’ rights,
we obtained their written consent. Then, assessment was conducted in a medical examination room.
First, sociodemographic data and self-reported weight and height were collected in an interview format.
Then, self-reported data on body perceptions, self-stigma, positivity, and happiness were collected.
The order of the questionnaires was counterbalanced to avoid order biases. Finally, objective measures
of weight and height were obtained.

Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the authors’ university (CIEB-2018-1-36).
The procedures used in this study adhere to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975,
revised in 2013.

2.2. Study Variables and Measures

Sociodemographic data were collected from the participants. Based on self-reported weight and
height, we calculated BMI as kg/m2. We also measured weight and height with a mobile anthropometer
(Aicok Weight Scale, mod. CF398BLE, USA), which uses bioelectrical impedance analysis technology
for monitoring multiple physical indexes, including body weight (weight range up to 400 pounds/180 kg
and indexing value accurate to 0.2 pounds/0.1 kg) and BMI. The participants were weighed while erect,
with the arms along the body, in bare feet and light clothes. BMI based on measured weight was
categorized according to international standards on nutritional status in the adult population [30,31],
i.e., <18.5 low weight, 18.5–24.9 normal weight, 25.0–29.9 overweight (25.0–26.9 overweight type I
and 27.0–29.9 overweight type II), and ≥30.0 obesity (30.0–34.9 obesity type I, 35.0–39.9 obesity type II,
and ≥40.0 obesity type III). The accuracy of body weight estimation was calculated as the discrepancy
between objective and subjective BMI. For the analyses, measured BMI was used, unless any other
speciﬁcation is made.

The perceptual component of body image [32] was explored by using silhouettes corresponding to
diﬀerent BMI ranges [33]. A total of 15 male or female body ﬁgures were presented to the individuals
to assess their own perceived bodies (perceived body image, PBI) and ideal body (ideal body image,
IBI) (in both cases, −7 = excessively obese, 0 = excessively thin and ﬂaccid, 7 = excessively muscular).
In addition, the desire to change weight and body appearance was assessed by the PBI-IBI discrepancy
(i.e., negative values indicate a desire for a slimmer and/or more muscular body; positive values
indicate a desire for a heavier and/or less muscular body; a value of 0 indicates the desire to maintain
the same body and appearance). This discrepancy has been widely used as an indicator of body
satisfaction [33–36]. Body dissatisfaction was also assessed by a single face-valid item (“How satisﬁed
are you with your current body weight and appearance?” 1 = extremely dissatisﬁed, 7 = extremely
satisﬁed) [33]. Body satisfaction is considered a key dimension in the evaluative–subjective component
of body image [32].

Stigma and self-stigma associated with excess weight were assessed with the Spanish version [37]
of the 11-item Weight Bias Internalization Scale (M-WBIS) [38]. Weight-related stigma is assessed
with respect to personal competence and self-worth, attractiveness, judgments by others, desire to
change weight, weight-related distress, sexual opportunities, and so forth (1 = completely disagree,
7 = completely agree). Higher scores indicate greater self-stigma (two items are reverse-scored).
Cronbach’s α was 0.83 in the present study.

Positive functioning was assessed with the Spanish version [39] of the 8-item Positivity Scale [40].
Positivity is deﬁned as the tendency to view life and personal experiences with a constructive
perspective, i.e., life satisfaction, personal conﬁdence, self-pride, hope and enthusiasm for future, social
support, and so forth (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree). A global score was obtained
by adding response values and then dividing by the number of items, with higher scores indicating
greater positivity (one item is reverse-scored). Cronbach’s α was 0.87 in the present study.

SWB was self-reported with the Happiness Scale [41]. Only the single-item indicator of current
happiness (“How happy are you at the present, i.e., the last few days or weeks?” 0 = extremely
unhappy, 10 = extremely happy) was used. Single-item indicators of happiness are usually used
in national surveys and individual research [42]. Instead of speciﬁc indicators of satisfaction with
life or hedonic balance (i.e., positive and negative aﬀect) [43], we measured SWB at a “molar” level
by assessing an individual’s summary assessment of their subjective happiness as a more global
psychological phenomenon [1].

2.3. Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses for the current study were conducted using SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA, 2017). The nature and adequacy of the data were checked, and parametric assumptions were
conﬁrmed. In addition to descriptive analysis (mean and standard deviation (M ± SD) for continuous
variables, n and % for categorical variables), we conducted Student’s t-tests for comparisons of
independent samples in order to explore diﬀerences in the study variables due to gender/sex (the term
“gender/sex” is used herein to emphasize the interrelation and intersectionality between the concepts,
and the personal experiences, of both sex and gender) and BMI category (i.e., overweight and obesity).
A correction was adopted for unequal variances of subgroups when appropriate. Cohen’s d eﬀect
2)/2|; for unequal sample
size [44] was calculated (for equal sample sizes: d = |m1
− m2
sizes: d = |m1
− 2)|; m = mean, s = standard deviation),
+ n2
2)/(n1
with d < 0.2 indicating a low eﬀect size, 0.5 indicating a medium eﬀect size, and >0.8 indicating a high
eﬀect size. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to test the eﬀect of the interaction of BMI
category and gender/sex on the study variables, with a calculation of main simple eﬀects [45]. Eta2 was
obtained for indicating eﬀect sizes. Furthermore, bivariate, zero-order Pearson’s correlations among
the study variables were calculated (BMI as a continuous variable). Finally, hierarchical multiple linear
regression analysis was used to examine the predictive validity of body image dimensions, self-stigma,
and positivity on happiness, controlling for age, gender/sex, and BMI (as a continuous variable).

3. Results

3.1. Descriptive Findings and Comparisons by Sex/Gender and BMI Category

On average, the participants perceived their current bodies to be similar to overweight, non-obese
ﬁgures, and they desired a slimmer, nonmuscular body, indicating, on average, an underestimation
of their real weight (i.e., the discrepancy between objective and subjective BMI; Table 1). Their body
satisfaction was moderate-to-high. The participants also reported, on average, low self-stigma,
high positivity, and high happiness. Compared with men, women reported bodies containing higher
fat mass and a thinner ideal appearance, as well as lower body satisfaction and higher weight-related
self-stigma (Table 1). Men and women did not diﬀer in terms of a desire to change their weight
(i.e., PBI-IBI discrepancy), positivity, and SWB. Participants with obesity reported a signiﬁcantly more
negative PBI and a less exigent IBI, corresponding to bodies with overweight; they also reported
a greater desire to change their weight compared to participants with overweight.
In addition,
individuals with obesity showed signiﬁcantly lower body satisfaction, marginally higher self-stigma,
and signiﬁcantly lower happiness. No diﬀerences in positivity were found between individuals with
obesity or with overweight.

3.2. Interaction Eﬀects of Sex/Gender and BMI Category

Two-way ANOVAs were conducted to explore the eﬀect of the interaction of the measured BMI
category and gender/sex on body satisfaction, stigma, positivity, and happiness. The interaction did not
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on body satisfaction (F = 0.232, p = 0.631), stigma (F = 0.187, p = 0.667), positivity
(F = 0.014, p = 0.907), or happiness (F = 3.227, p = 0.076). For both males and females, a higher BMI was
associated with lower body satisfaction, higher self-stigma, lower positivity, and decreased happiness.
The interaction eﬀect was close to signiﬁcance in the case of happiness; appealing diﬀerences were
observed between males and females: while there was a slight decrease in happiness as BMI increased
in men (7.5 vs. 7.3 units for overweight and obesity, respectively), the diﬀerence was 1.6 units between
women with overweight (7.9 units) and those with obesity (6.3 units).

We used hierarchical multiple regression to examine the eﬀect of body satisfaction, self-stigma,
and positivity on SWB while controlling for measured BMI, age, and gender/sex. Demographic variables
were entered in Step 1, body satisfaction was entered in Step 2, self-stigma was entered in Step 3,
and positivity was entered in Step 4. Demographic and anthropometric variables accounted for 4%
of the variance in Step 1 of the regression involving happiness (corr. R2 = 0.04, F = 4.888, p = 0.029);
neither age nor gender/sex signiﬁcantly contributed to the explained variance, and only BMI was
a signiﬁcant predictor (b = −0.22, p = 0.029). Hence, as BMI increases, individuals are less likely to
report being happy. BMI was no longer a signiﬁcant predictor after body satisfaction (b = 0.42, p = 0.000)
was entered in Step 2 (corr. R2 = 0.18, F = 11.745, p = 0.000). When self-stigma was entered into the
equation in Step 3, it produced a signiﬁcant increment in explained variance (corr. R2 = 0.24, F = 11.332,
p = 0.000), and body satisfaction (b = 0.29, p = 0.006) remained a signiﬁcant predictor along with
stigma (b = −0.29, p = 0.004). The ﬁnal model (Table 3) accounted for 33% of the variance in happiness
(corr. R2 = 0.33, F = 13.099, p = 0.000), with body satisfaction (b = 0.25, p = 0.012) and positivity (b = 0.34,
p = 0.000) as signiﬁcant independent predictors of happiness. Thus, individuals with overweight and
obesity with higher positivity traits and body satisfaction are more likely to be happier. It should be
noted, however, that the zero-order correlation between self-stigma and happiness was signiﬁcant,
and it was a signiﬁcant predictor in Step 3, implying that the ﬁnding in Step 4 might be a suppressor
eﬀect of positivity on self-stigma [46]. Thus, the ﬁndings provide support for the idea that the eﬀect of
BMI on happiness is mediated by the addition of a subjective experience of BMI (i.e., body satisfaction)
and positivity disposition, while positivity suppresses the pervasive eﬀects of self-stigma on SWB.

4. Discussion

In the present study, we explore the experiences of excess weight (i.e., BMI), body image perceptual
and evaluative–subjective dimensions, self-stigma, positivity, and happiness in adults with overweight
or obesity, as well as the associations among these variables.

The body perceptions reported by the participants of the present study are in line with other
ﬁndings on individuals with overweight in our nation [33–36]. Compared with men, women reported
signiﬁcantly more negative body self-perceptions, i.e., bodies containing higher fat mass, and a slimmer
ideal appearance, as well as lower body satisfaction [34–36]. Compared with participants with
overweight, participants with obesity reported lower body satisfaction, a signiﬁcantly more negative
PBI and an IBI that did not diﬀer considerably from their own body, i.e., they chose overweight
bodies [34–36]. The interaction between BMI and gender/sex did not have an eﬀect on body perceptions
and satisfaction. For males and females, body dissatisfaction increases as BMI increases by desiring
smaller body sizes [35]. While the desire to change their body (i.e., PBI-IBI discrepancy) did not vary
due to gender/sex [36], individuals with obesity reported a stronger desire for change to reach their
ideal body [34]. In addition, our ﬁndings are in accordance with others showing that women of all ages
value and compare themselves to a thin, lightly toned body while men value slender and muscular,
athletic-type bodies [32]; this is also true for women and men with excessive weight [3].

Self-stigma was low-to-moderate in this sample, paralleling previous ﬁndings on perceived
personal discrimination among Spanish individuals with obesity [10,11,22,23,47]. Women demonstrated
higher weight-related self-stigma compared to men; as others have indicated, women are more
aﬀected by weight stigmatization [7] and group discrimination [23], yet this ﬁnding has not been
previously found among Spanish individuals with obesity seeking or undergoing treatment for weight
loss [10,11,23,47]. While others have not found an inﬂuence of BMI on stigma among individuals with
excess weight [10,11,23], some research exists on the positive relationship between weight and weight
self-stigma [47], and we found that participants with obesity showed marginally higher self-stigma
compared to individuals with overweight. In the present study, the interaction between gender/sex
and BMI did not have an eﬀect on weight-related stigma.

Independent of gender/sex and BMI, the participants showed elevated positivity. As far as we know,
there is no previous research on the relationship between weight, body image, and positivity, and studies
on positive orientation among individuals with obesity are lacking as well. Thus, our ﬁndings on
positivity are novel in body image or obesity research. Furthermore, research conducted with Spanish
samples on the positivity trait is scarce, which is another contribution of this study. Our ﬁndings
on participants’ positivity are comparable to those found with heterogeneous Spanish samples of
university students [40] and adults not aﬀected by severe illnesses [48], although in another study,
adults from the general population demonstrated higher positivity compared to our participants with
obesity [49]. Moreover, others found no diﬀerences in positivity between women and men [39,40,49].
The “positive cognitive triad” on the self, life, and future is an important variable for well-being,
as it makes people capable of facing life in spite of adversity, failure, loss, or serious illness [27].
In Spanish samples, it has been demonstrated to be diﬀerent among individuals being treated for
adjustment disorder or cardiovascular disease compared to the general population; positivity is capable
of predicting the individuals’ illness condition and is associated with adaptive coping and self-eﬃcacy
for negative emotion regulation [48,49]. It also may help individuals to manage their health more
successfully, as patients with cardiovascular disease participating in a rehab program demonstrated
higher positivity than healthy controls [49]. Thus, we encourage researchers to deeply explore positivity
and its outcomes regarding weight control, appearance management, stigma inﬂuence, and overall
well-being of people living with excessive weight.

Participants in the present study reported average happiness that mirrors data from the latest EU
Eurostat [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/] and the Spanish Sociologic Research Center [http://www.cis.es/],
although the levels in this study were 1 point higher compared to the UN Gallop World Pull [50].
Others have found that Spanish individuals with obesity are, on average, happy [11], whereas other
ﬁndings have supported decreased SWB for them [10,22]. Participants with obesity demonstrated
signiﬁcantly lower SWB compared to individuals with overweight [11]. Moreover, although no
gender/sex diﬀerences were established for SWB, diﬀerent trends were observed between males and
females for happiness when BMI was considered: happiness is less impacted by BMI increases among

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4186

men, but women feel considerably unhappier if they get fatter [18,21]. Given that the female participants
in this study also demonstrated lower body satisfaction and higher weight stigma compared to male
participants, this ﬁnding might be derived from the higher relevance imposed on the feminine body
and the internalization of the beauty standards compared to males [32]. Nevertheless, some authors
have not found eﬀects of age, sex, and BMI on psychological well-being (i.e., self-stigma, happiness)
among individuals with obesity [10,11,22,23].

In the present study, participants with lower BMI, higher body satisfaction, suﬀering from lower
stigmatization phenomena, and holding more positive expectations about the self, life, and future
were also more likely to report feeling happier. We also found that body satisfaction and positivity
were independent predictors of happiness when controlling for age, gender/sex and BMI, suggesting
that those individuals with overweight and obesity with better body acceptance and enjoyment and
with greater positive expectations about the self, life, and future were more likely to report that they
were happy. The estimates shown in Table 3 seem to suggest that there is no direct eﬀect of obesity on
well-being. In contrast, the impact of objective weight on SWB was fully mediated by body satisfaction
and positivity. Furthermore, the eﬀect of subjective appreciation of weight and body on happiness
persists even after controlling for BMI and when weight stigma and positivity were introduced as
further regressors, implying that personal body valorisation is associated with some direct psychosocial
eﬀects on well-being. Moreover, the progressive attenuation of the coeﬃcients from Models 1 to 4,
representing the eﬀects of BMI, body satisfaction, and stigma on happiness, suggests that the obesity
eﬀect is partially explained by the relationship between these psychosocial characteristics and positivity.
Notably, our ﬁndings stress that without the contribution of psychological mediators in the
relationship between BMI and happiness, it is hardly understandable, if detectable. Our findings
further reveal that women and men demonstrate the same pattern and that the same mediators
are needed to fully capture the association between BMI and happiness. Nevertheless, while the
combination of these variables accounted for a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in happiness,
two-thirds of the variance remains unexplained, and an avenue for future research is to investigate
other contributors to happiness among individuals with obesity.

In addition, we found that participants with obesity reported lower happiness than participants
with overweight, but BMI was not a signiﬁcant predictor of SWB when other psychosocial variables
were included in the model.
It has been found that BMI is related to decreased happiness only
among individuals with obesity, not among individuals with overweight and normal weight [13,17].
Furthermore, conﬂicting results have been obtained with perceived weight instead of BMI and the
congruency between both indicators [51]. Indeed, BMI alone is not considered to be an adequate
measure of obesity or a suﬃcient predictor of obesity-related health outcomes, as it does not fully capture
the adverse eﬀects of obesity [13]. Thus, it might be more interesting to use corporeal self-perceptions
and body satisfaction rather than objective BMI-based categories [1,51,52]. Our ﬁndings support this
aﬃrmation. Thus, while evidence indicates that SWB is negatively aﬀected by obesity after taking into
account the eﬀect of all other relevant individual-level covariates, more studies are needed to conﬁrm
this pattern, and there are still many issues to be explored regarding this relationship.

Interestingly, we found a suppression eﬀect of positivity on self-stigma when predicting SWB,
since stigma was a signiﬁcant predictor before positivity was introduced to the model. Consequently,
the eﬀect of BMI on happiness was mediated by the addition of the subjective experience of BMI
(i.e., body satisfaction) and the positivity disposition, and the latter suppressed the pervasive eﬀects
of self-stigma on SWB. While BMI has been linked to stigma and rejection [47], others have found
that BMI is unrelated to discrimination among obesity-range individuals [10], so the exact mechanism
through which stigma is linked to weight and possible protective factors against its pervasive eﬀects
should be more deeply explored in future research.

Our ﬁndings have several interesting practical derivations. Along with complete preparation of
professionals in order to successfully attend obesity in its complexity [53] and actions for increasing
awareness of body weight and health issues among the general public and individuals at risk or

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4186

suﬀering from excess weight [54], public campaigns and health policies should foster the promotion
of healthier, positive, and realistic body images [55] and of healthy weight-control strategies for
weight and appearance management [56,57] (e.g., [58]). By listening to people’s experiences and
recognizing body weight as one aspect of human diversity, we can promote inclusion and acceptance
of all individuals, regardless of their body weight, shape, or size, and thus support their health,
well-being, and participation throughout life. Moreover, our ﬁndings can be interpreted under the
umbrella of the criticisms currently directed to the “weight-centered health paradigm” (WCHP),
by which body weight is placed at the heart of the discourses about health, resulting in an enhanced
adipophobicogenic environment and reduced health and quality of life of those living with excessive
weight. This dominant paradigm has resulted in arguments from critical health promotion for
a paradigm shift away from focusing on weight and focusing instead on health and well-being within
a “healthy at every size”, more salutogenic approach [59,60]. In addition, widespread interventions
among the general population, as well as speciﬁcally for the subpopulation with obesity, should
focus on eradicating the ubiquitous social weight stigma and mitigating the deleterious inﬂuence
of self-stigma on well-being [7]. Finally, as Caprara et al. [27] have pointed out, a recommendation
for designing practices “conducive to promoting and sustaining positive orientation as a powerful
driver of individuals’ ﬂourishing” (p. 131) among individuals living with excess weight should be
encouraged, given the mediating eﬀects of positivity for both weight and weight stigma when SWB
is considered.

Despite the contributions of the present study, which included examining the eﬀects of BMI,
several dimensions of body perceptions, weight stigma and, for the ﬁrst time, to the best of our
knowledge, positivity, on the happiness of a sample of men and women with overweight and
obesity, our ﬁndings should be considered in light of several limitations. The sample is limited
and probably not representative of the whole Spanish population. Moreover, the participants
demonstrated, on average, moderate body satisfaction, low self-stigma, high positivity, and high
happiness, possibly over-representing a “positive” subgroup of individuals with obesity or a group
with positive or functional body self-perceptions. Our ﬁndings need to be replicated with broader and
more heterogeneous samples throughout the nation. In addition, the relationship between BMI or
body perceptions and SWB is also aﬀected by several contextual variables, such as the prevalence of
obesity and relative comparisons, social weight norms, and stigmatization social processes [19,20],
as well as contextual sociopolitical and cultural factors [14]. Furthermore, other factors may have
an inﬂuence on the variables explored in the present study, such as physical activity and other
healthy habits, self-perceived health status, education level, employment status, or wealth/social
class (e.g., [13,19,20,34,49]), but we did not explore these factors. Our ﬁndings (i.e., only one-third
of the variance was explained by the model) indicate that there are likely other factors at play in
explaining levels of well-being in people with obesity. Thus, future research should investigate
other determinants of the relationship between anthropometrics, body appreciation, weight-related
sociocultural phenomena, and happiness. Besides, we selected the measurement tools we have used,
but no doubt, there are alternative instruments and approaches to gather data on the phenomena
we have explored. Finally, the descriptive, correlational nature of the study limits the conclusions
to be derived, and future research should adopt other research designs and analytical procedures to
complement our knowledge on the issues explored herein.

5. Conclusions

In summary, the main ﬁndings reported in the present study provide support for the happiness of
adults with overweight and obesity and the relationships of body image dimensions, weight-related
stigma, positivity, and well-being (i.e., happiness) in the context of obesity. While demographics,
BMI, and stigma have limited direct inﬂuence, body satisfaction and, to a greater extent, positivity
accounted for signiﬁcant proportions of the variance in happiness. Moreover, positive orientation
suppressed the pervasive inﬂuence of stigma on SWB. The current study oﬀers new directions for

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4186

the study of SWB in obesity. Future research is required to investigate ways in which weight, body
satisfaction, weight-related stigma, and positivity may interact to aﬀect well-being and functioning
in individuals with excess weight and to explore how accumulated evidence may be used to inform
health interventions for preventing and managing obesity in all its dimensions.
