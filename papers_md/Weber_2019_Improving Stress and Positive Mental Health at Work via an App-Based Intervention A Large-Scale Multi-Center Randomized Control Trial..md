Mobile health interventions (i.e., “apps”) are used to address mental health and are
an increasingly popular method available to both individuals and organizations to
manage workplace stress. However, at present, there is a lack of research on the
effectiveness of mobile health interventions in counteracting or improving stress-related
health problems, particularly in naturalistic, non-clinical settings. This project aimed
at validating a mobile health intervention (which is theoretically grounded in the Job
Demands-Resources Model) in preventing and managing stress at work. Within the
mobile health intervention, employees make an evidence-based, personalized, psycho-
journey to build further resources, and thus, reduce stress. A large-scale
educational
longitudinal randomized control trial, conducted with six European companies over
6 weeks using four measurement points, examined indicators of mental health via
measures of stress, wellbeing, resilience, and sleep. The data were analyzed by means
including both self-report
of hierarchical multilevel models for repeated measures,
measures and user behavior metrics from the app. The results (n = 532) suggest that
using the mobile health intervention (vs. waitlist control group) signiﬁcantly improved
stress and wellbeing over time. Higher engagement in the intervention increased the
beneﬁcial effects. Additionally, use of the sleep tracking function led to an improvement
in sleeping troubles. The intervention had no effects on measures of physical health
or social community at work. Theoretical and practical
implications of these ﬁndings
are discussed, focusing on beneﬁts and challenges of using technological solutions for
organizations to support individuals’ mental health in the workplace.

Stress and Resilience in the Workplace
Workplace stress remains a common yet undertreated condition
(Ebert et al., 2016). If experienced over a prolonged period
in a variety of mental and
of
physical health issues (Joyce et al., 2016), aﬀecting both
the individual and the organization. Concerning the former,
excessive chronic workloads without time to rest can cause
physical exhaustion, stress-related illnesses (Chandola et al.,
2006), and psychological disorders such as depression (Hammen,
2005). As to organizations, this results in high costs. From
2008 to 2017, sickness absence days due to mental ill-health2
increased by 67.5% in Germany (Meyer et al., 2018). In the
United Kingdom, in 2018, the Health and Safety Executive (2017)
reported that stress, depression, and anxiety accounted for 15.4
million working days lost due to ill-health (57% of all days lost).
Similar ﬁgures have been reported for other European countries
(European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2014).

To counterbalance the risks that come with high levels of
work stress, the concept of employee resilience has become
increasingly important. Deﬁnitions of resilience vary, regarding
it either as a rather stable trait that helps individuals to cope
with diﬃculties and to attain good adjustment and development
(e.g., Wagnild and Young, 1993; Schumacher et al., 2005; Ong
et al., 2006), or as a state, suggesting a dynamic process, in
which individuals actively adapt to and recover from major
diﬃculties (e.g., Luthar and Cicchetti, 2000; Connor and
Davidson, 2003; Fergus and Zimmerman, 2005; Windle, 2010).
Taking the perspective that resources to counteract stress are
adaptable, the Job Demands-Resources Model (JDR; Bakker and
Demerouti, 2007; Schaufeli and Taris, 2014) describes stress
as a response to an imbalance between the demands that

1Positive mental health goes beyond the absence of psychopathological symptoms.
It can be deﬁned as the subjective experience of wellbeing and an optimal way
of psychological and social functioning (cf. World Health Organization [WHO],
2018).
2Mental ill-health (or mental health problems) is broadly deﬁned as including
established diagnoses (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, burnout) and work-
related stress symptoms (cf. Harvey et al., 2017).

work places on the individual and the resources a person has
available to deal with those demands. Job demands describe
“physical, social, or organizational aspects of
the job that
require sustained physical or mental eﬀort and are therefore
associated with certain physiological and psychological costs”
(Demerouti et al., 2001, p. 501), for example, work overload,
interpersonal conﬂicts, or job insecurity (Schaufeli and Taris,
2014). Job resources are deﬁned as “those physical, psychological,
social, or organizational aspects of the job that may do any
of the following: (a) be functional in achieving work goals,
(b) reduce job demands at the associated physiological and
psychological costs; and (c) stimulate personal growth and
development” (Demerouti et al., 2001, p. 501), resulting in higher
employee resilience. If demands exceed resources, individuals
experience a mental and physical health impairment process,
leading to decreased energy and exhaustion. If the contrary is
the case, a motivational process takes place, with an increase
in work engagement and positive outcomes such as higher
wellbeing and organizational commitment (e.g., Bakker et al.,
2003; Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004; Xanthopoulou et al., 2007;
Hakanen et al., 2008).

Digital Mental Health Interventions:
Categorization, Scientiﬁc Foundation,
and Validation
In order to tackle problems associated with stress in people’s
everyday lives, the mHealth3 sector, and with it, the availability
of apps claiming to reduce stress,
increase wellbeing, or
improve mental health issues such as depression, is constantly
growing (e.g., Muaremi et al., 2013; Research 2 Guidance,
2017; Statista, 2018). Such mobile health interventions can
be classiﬁed into four categories (Muaremi et al., 2013):
diaries (collection of subjective and aggregated data), guides
(strategies to cope with the problems), relaxations (training
of relaxation skills), and sensor measurements (sensor-based
tracking of problem-associated behavior). Many stress and
wellbeing apps
from more than one of
these categories. Mobile health interventions can provide
personalized feedback and deliver summary statistics or progress
scores, either via the app or transmitted through the app
by a therapist or coach (e.g., Gaggioli and Riva, 2013;
Ly et al., 2014; Heber et al., 2016; Firth et al., 2017).
Research demonstrates that the use of scientiﬁc methods and
foundation positively inﬂuence the outcomes

technologically delivered health interventions and drive
behavior change (e.g., Webb et al., 2010; Donker et al., 2013;
Bolier and Abello, 2014).

Recent research has shown that there is a large discrepancy
between using science to advertise mental health apps versus
evaluating their eﬀectiveness (Larsen et al., 2019). Few of the
many mobile health interventions currently on the market are
scientiﬁcally validated; as such, the quality of mental health apps

devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital
assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices” (World Health Organization

Mobile Health App to Improve Stress

diﬀers widely regarding the level of scientiﬁc evidence (e.g.,
Bolier and Abello, 2014; Nicholas et al., 2015). Meta-analyses
show that online interventions (e.g., internet-delivered cognitive
behavioral therapy) can be equally as eﬀective as traditional face-
to-face interventions in treating psychological disorders (e.g.,
Barak et al., 2008; Carlbring et al., 2018). A comparable level
of research on mental health apps is lacking. In the clinical
domain, some apps have been successfully applied concerning
the diagnosis and treatment of stress-related mental illnesses such
as depression and anxiety (e.g., Watts et al., 2013; Birney et al.,
2016; Ranjbartabar et al., 2016; Firth et al., 2017). Yet, there
remains a need for more rigorous research on the eﬀectiveness of
mobile health interventions as prevention tools for mental health,
particularly in the work context.

reactive measures

Preventative Mental Health Solutions in
the Work Context
Whilst research on digital health interventions in the clinical
domain is rapidly growing (Firth et al., 2017), research on
preventative mental health solutions
in the workplace is
often overlooked. Although workplaces would constitute an
location for preventative programs, most organizations
ideal
implement
targeting the symptoms of
workplace stress (Deloitte, 2017). Previous workplace mobile
health interventions are built on programs traditionally run in
a clinical context, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or
mindfulness based cognitive therapy. They often center around
a ‘virtual coach’ or councilor guiding the user through content.
Some pioneering studies found positive eﬀects for smartphone
interventions on workplace stress, for example, using Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Ly et al., 2014) or CBT
(Joyce et al., 2016). Initial results look promising; however,
characteristics of the target population have to be considered
when transferring tools to support mental health from a clinical
domain to the workplace population (Joyce et al., 2016).

Mobile health interventions provide an opportunity for the
provision of a proactive, preventative approach for employee
mental health (e.g., Tan et al., 2014; Aryana et al., 2018). They
are easily accessible to employees, enabling access to a service
earlier than traditional methods, and therefore, preventing the
onset of more severe mental health problems (Ebert et al., 2016).
A mobile preventative intervention approach may lend itself
to higher levels of personalization than traditional workplace
wellbeing support. Through a digital pathway, employees are able
to take control of their individual journey by completing the
intervention at their own pace, working on content that applies
to them and their personal situation, and choosing a time that
suites them while staying in anonymity (cf. Gaggioli and Riva,
2013; Ebert et al., 2016; Joyce et al., 2016). In sum, this creates
an environment of high opportunity and low demand in which
the desired behavior change can occur, leading to improved
psychological outcomes (cf. Howarth et al., 2018). This may not
only beneﬁt the individual, but also the organization as a whole.
Programs speciﬁcally focusing on work-based problems often
link to daily work routines (e.g., commuting or eating), and
consist of targeted, short, simple, and easy to implement tasks,

providing an opportunity to easily transfer learnings into daily
work life (e.g., Gaggioli and Riva, 2013; Ebert et al., 2016;
Joyce et al., 2016). Mobile health interventions beneﬁt further
when embedded into the work environment, for example, when
downloaded onto an employee’s personal technical equipment
such as their work phone (Howarth et al., 2018; see also
Martinez and Williams, 2010). Smartphones are commonly used
among people of diﬀerent age groups, socio-economic status,
and cultural backgrounds; thus, app-based health interventions
can be made accessible to a broad range of people in
diﬀerent workplaces. Often, users carry their smartphones almost
everywhere and anytime (He and Li, 2013), providing a range
of measurement and intervention opportunities, such as real-
time symptom and activity monitoring, tracking of treatment
progress, provision of personalized feedback and motivational
support, portability and ﬂexibility of use, and the potential
to improve adherence to treatment (Donker et al., 2013).
Furthermore, users may be empowered by the feeling of privacy
and conﬁdentiality of their engagement, if they only interact with
an app on their personal phone, without connections to social
networking sites (Bakker et al., 2016); still, data security policies
need to be ensured.

The Current Research
Taken together, theory and research suggest that mobile health
interventions may help to prevent mental health problems due
to work-related stress, provided the intervention is grounded in
theory, uses evidence-based techniques, and implements various
behavior change strategies (e.g., based on self-monitoring or dual
process theory). There is promise in regards to future science-
backed mobile health interventions, as research in this domain
is on the rise (e.g., Deady et al., 2018). Yet, there is still a lack
of experimental research to validate app-based interventions to
reduce stress at work.
The aim of

to examine whether a
science-based health and wellbeing application, named “Kelaa
Mental Resilience” and provided by Soma Analytics (London,
United Kingdom), drives statistically and functionally signiﬁcant
improvements in validated measures of stress and wellbeing. The
app is a digital tool that focuses on the prevention of mental
ill-health, rather than a treatment thereof. It is theoretically
grounded in the JDR (e.g., Demerouti et al., 2001; Bakker and
Demerouti, 2007). The mobile health interventions has been
developed speciﬁcally for the workplace and oﬀers a combination
of diaries, sensor measurements, and guides (see Muaremi et al.,
2013). Details are provided in the paragraph Kelaa Mental
Resilience App in the section “Materials and Methods.” A previous
version of the app was already shown to be eﬀective for healthcare
workers in a clinical work context based on a small-scale RCT
(Mistretta et al., 2018).

Within the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and
Innovation Program, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal
RCT to assess the intervention impact by comparing health-
related outcomes between the app group and a waitlist control
group. To increase external validity and generalizability of the
ﬁndings, the trial was implemented at various organizations,
oﬀering a broad range of diﬀerent jobs and work environments.

Mobile Health App to Improve Stress

Indicators of stress (cognitive and general), wellbeing, resilience,
and sleeping troubles served as dependent variables (DVs).
Further, we analyzed whether the intervention impact was
inﬂuenced by other factors, such as intensity of engagement with
the app over time or trial site.

Based on the theory and research outlined above, we expected

the following:

Hypothesis 1: Compared to the waitlist control, after using
the app for 4 weeks, participants in the app group will report
(a) lower levels of stress (cognitive and general), (b) higher
levels of wellbeing, (c) higher levels of resilience, and (d)
fewer sleeping troubles.

Hypothesis 2: The observed eﬀects will be more intense
the more the user interacts with the app throughout the
duration of the study.

In addition to the a priori hypotheses, we explored two open
research questions: First, does the app also aﬀect other outcomes
which are more remote to the content of the app, such as social
community at work (i.e., a measure of the organizational climate)
or physical health? And second, will the positive eﬀects of the
app persist after people cease using it? To examine potential
long-term eﬀects, we included a 2-week follow-up measurement
occasion (i.e., a time point after the main part of the study when
participants had stopped using the app).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Kelaa Mental Resilience App
The app, developed as a digital prevention tool, seeks to translate
insights from scientiﬁc research on psychology, sleep medicine,
and neuroscience into an action-based program. It draws on
the tenets of clinical, health, positive, cognitive, biological, and
social psychology to foster recovery and growth. “Kelaa” aims to
reduce stress and increase wellbeing of the user, speciﬁcally in the
workplace. Users learn new behaviors and best practices through
diﬀerent means, for example, based on CBT and mindfulness
based cognitive therapy. The app is designed to implement
lifestyle changes through (1) measuring behavior, cognitions,
and emotions (tracking module) and (2) providing psycho-
educational content (intervention module).

Within the tracking module, users can track their stress,
wellbeing, and resilience via short in-app questionnaires using
validated scientiﬁc measures. The app also uses inbuilt sensors
in smartphones
to provide the
opportunity to measure and track their sleep quality and quantity.
Personalized feedback on questionnaire scores (e.g., what are my
scores? What does this mean for me? What should I do about
this?), as well as detailed feedback on sleep data (e.g., how do I
interpret my sleep charts?), are given within the app.

based content on factors contributing to reduced stress and

these ﬁndings, “Kelaa” oﬀers users the opportunity to choose

which are gradually unlocked. The goals aim to increase
personal resources by providing information, exercises, and
reﬂection. During each daily session, relevant research and
expected beneﬁts are outlined, before users are instructed,
for example,
in speciﬁc stress management and resilience
techniques, while encouraging positive behavior transformation.
The intervention module supports users to reach a variety of
nominated goals. A detailed summary of all goals and sessions
is provided in Table 1.

Participants
An a priori sample size calculation (G∗Power; Faul et al., 2007),
with a conservatively estimated main treatment eﬀect of at
least 5% for all parameters (small eﬀect: Cohen’s d = 0.28,
Cohen’s f = 0.14), assuming a signiﬁcance level (alpha) of 5%,
and a statistical power (1-beta) of 80%, resulted in a required
sample size of N = 561 participants. Participants were recruited
from six diﬀerent European businesses in Germany, England,
and Northern Ireland from the private and public sector. The
complete data set consisted of N = 678 participants. At T1,
n = 621 people completed the questionnaire. The number of
participants dropped to n = 483 at T2, n = 396 at T3, and
n = 363 at T4. A total of n = 301 (44.4%) people completed
all questionnaires at all times, while n = 105 people completed
three (15.5%), n = 99 two (14.6%), and n = 146 (21.5%)
only one out of
four measurement occasions (see section
“Procedure” for details).

As indicated by user metrics of the app, out of the n = 347
participants who were assigned to the app group, n = 137 people
did not use the app at all, and thus, were excluded from the
sample. Further, people in the waitlist control group (n = 331),
who downloaded the app before the end of the trial (n = 9),
were also excluded. All participants who adhered to their assigned
group (i.e., app group with at least one sign-in, waitlist control
group with no app use) were included into the statistical analyses.
The ﬁnal sample consisted of n = 532 participants with n = 210
in the app group and n = 322 in the waitlist control group.
Participants were unevenly distributed across trial sites (n1 = 40,
n2 = 78, n3 = 179, n4 = 61, n5 = 11, n6 = 163). Participants’
age (M = 40.62, SD = 11.19) ranged between 17 and 72 years
(based on n = 485 participants who shared their age). The gender
distribution of the ﬁnal sample was skewed with n = 119 (24.4%)

Procedure
This intervention study was conducted as a randomized control
trial
following a longitudinal experimental design.
Participation was voluntary. Data protection policies (i.e., GDPR)
were strictly followed. Ethics approval was provided through
the European Commission Horizon 2020 Ethics Appraisal
Procedure (European Commission, 2018). Participants were
blind to hypotheses and goals of the study, while HR managers
were blind to each participant’s group assignment. HR managers
had no insight into questionnaire results, app use intensity, or
other personal information.

The trial was conducted from January until September 2018.
Launch days varied between the six companies. After signing up
and giving their informed consent, participants were randomly
assigned to one out of two experimental conditions: app group
vs. waitlist control. The trial was conducted over a period
of 6 weeks. During the recruitment phase, employees were
informed via email and information on a web portal that on
launch day, they would receive an email containing a link to
the ﬁrst of the four assessments. Data was collected online
using the survey software Qualtrics. Participants in the app
group were asked to complete the ﬁrst questionnaire prior
to downloading and engaging with the app. Measurements
(see section “Measures”) of all participants (i.e., app group
and waitlist control group) were taken at baseline (T1, week
0), mid-intervention (T2, week 2), end-intervention (T3, week
4), and two-week follow-up (T4, week 6). Invitations to the
follow-up questionnaires as well as reminders were sent via
email. The time frame to complete each questionnaire was
restricted to seven days. After ﬁnishing T4, all participants were
thanked and fully debriefed. They had the opportunity to provide

feedback on their personal experiences with using the app and to
suggest improvements.
The duration of

the intervention was 4 weeks. Thus,
participants in the app group could complete a maximum of 28
sessions and track a maximum of 28 nights. As people prefer
to receive self-help support materials on a familiar medium
(see Martinez and Williams, 2010), participants were oﬀered
the choice to use the app on their personal or their work
phones at their individual preferences. It was completely left to
the user to what extent s/he wanted to engage with the app.
Push-notiﬁcations were sent out as reminders, yet users had
the option to turn them oﬀ. For the app group, active access
to the interventional module within the app was withdrawn
in order to get an indicator of
during the ﬁnal 2 weeks,
whether and which gains from 4 weeks’ use persisted (T4).
Participants in the waitlist control group received no intervention
and no tracking opportunity for the duration of
the trial
(6 weeks), yet they had unrestricted access to treatment as
usual within their companies. Upon completion of the trial,
participants in the waitlist control group received access to
the “Kelaa” app.

Measures
Participants completed a series of questionnaires at all four
measurement occasions (T1, T2, T3, and T4). At all times,
reliability of the scales was good or excellent, as indicated
by Cronbach’s α (see Table 2 for descriptive statistics). Scales
were presented in the order as below. For each measurement
occasion and scale, participants were instructed to answer the
questions based on their experiences during the past 2 weeks.
For all measures and all times, the mean response scale values
were calculated.

Stress
Self-reported levels of stress were assessed with the two subscales
General Stress (four items, e.g., “How often have you been
stressed?”) and Cognitive Stress (four items, e.g., “How often
have you had problems concentrating?”) from the Copenhagen
Psychosocial Questionnaire – Revised Version (COPSOQ II;

Pejtersen et al., 2010). The items were answered on a ﬁve-point
scale (1 = not at all; 2 = a small part of the time; 3 = part of the
time; 4 = a large part of the time; 5 = all the time). Higher values
indicate more stress.

Wellbeing
Subjective wellbeing was measured with the Warwick-Edinburgh
Mental Wellbeing Scale (Tennant et al., 2007). Seven items (e.g.,
“I’ve been feeling relaxed.”) were answered on a ﬁve-point scale
(1 = none of the time; 2 = rarely; 3 = some of the time; 4 = often;
5 = all of the time). Higher values indicate more wellbeing.

Resilience
We assessed resilience with the 13-item Resilience Scale (RS-
13; Leppert et al., 2008), a short form of the Resilience Scale
(RS-25; Wagnild and Young, 1993). Items (e.g., “I usually
take things in stride.”) were answered on a seven-point scale

(1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Higher values indicate
more resilience.

Social Community at Work
Participants indicated their sense of cooperation and social
community at work with the subscale Social Community at Work
from the COPSOQ II (Pejtersen et al., 2010). Three items (e.g.,
“Do you feel part of a community at your place of work?”)
were answered on a ﬁve-point scale (1 = not at all; 2 = a small
part of the time; 3 = part of the time; 4 = a large part of the
time; 5 = all the time). Higher values indicate more sense of
social community.

Sleeping Troubles
Participants were asked about sleeping troubles with the subscale
Sleeping Troubles from the COPSOQ II (Pejtersen et al., 2010).

were answered on a ﬁve-point scale (1 = not at all; 2 = a
small part of the time; 3 = part of the time; 4 = a large part
of the time; 5 = all the time). Higher values indicate more
sleeping troubles.

Physical Health Impairment
We assessed participants self-reported physical health levels
with the SF-36 Version 2 (Jenkinson et al., 1999). Participants
were asked to indicate their agreement to four items (e.g.,
“Because of your physical health, you were limited in the kind
of work or other activities.”) on a scale from 1 = none of
the time to 5 = all of the time. Higher values indicate worse
physical health.

Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire:
General Health V2.0 (WPAI:GH; Reilly et al., 1993) asked
participants about the impact of health problems on their ability
to work and perform regular activities over the past week. Three
items (i.e., “During the past 7 days, how many hours did you miss
from work because of your health problems?” “. . ., how many
hours did you miss from work because of any other reason, such
as vacation, holidays, time oﬀ to participate in this study?” “. . .,
how many hours did you actually work?”) were provided with
open text ﬁelds. Two items asked for a rating on a bipolar 11-
point scale (e.g., “. . ., how much did your health problems aﬀect
your productivity while you were working?”; 0 = Health problems
had no eﬀect on my work to 10 = Health problems completely
prevented me from working). This scale was not analyzed further
as part of this research, but is reported for transparency reasons.

Statistical Analyses
To obtain the ﬁnal data set, we augmented the self-reported
outcome measures at the four measurement points with the (self-
reported) demographic information at baseline (i.e., age, gender),
trial site, experimental group, and actual user behavior metrics
from the app (i.e., number of daily sessions completed, number
of nights tracked via the sleep tracker). Combining the self-
reported DVs with predictors mirroring actual user behavior is a
particular strength of the methodological approach of this study,
as it eliminates the subjectivity in measuring compliance to the
intervention by introducing an objective, ﬁne-grained measure
of app use intensity.

The data were analyzed by means of multilevel modeling for
repeated measures where measurements (Level 1) are nested
within subjects (Level 2). Compared to repeated measures
ANOVAs, multilevel analyses possess the advantage of being
more robust with respect
to missing data and underlying
variance/co-variance assumptions (Hox, 2010). Additionally,
particularly in the case of the current project, multilevel analyses
potentially allow the addition of “trial site” as Level 3 (i.e.,
measurement occasions within subjects within trial sites). The
recommendation for each level is a minimum number of 30
cases per level (Hox, 2010). However, the study was conducted
at only six trial sites. Thus, we could not include a third
level into our analyses. Instead, the variable was disaggregated
onto Level 2 (see controlled model), in order to assess the

impact of higher order variables. The data were
potential
analyzed using the statistical programing language R (R Core
Team, 2018) in combination with the nlme package (Pinheiro
et al., 2018). Results were replicated with HLM 7 for Windows
(Raudenbush et al., 2011).

Using the notation of Raudenbush et al.

the
foundational, uncontrolled Level 1 model can be written as
follows: within subject i, the outcome measurement OUTCOMEti
at measurement time t depends on a baseline mean and a
treatment eﬀect according to the simple regression model,

(2011),

OUTCOMEti = π0i + π1i TIMEti + eti,

for subject i; eti is a measurement speciﬁc residual assumed to be
independently and normally distributed within subjects. TIME
takes the values 0, 1, and 2, so that the intercept denotes the
baseline outcome.

the hierarchical

Within the framework of

linear model,
the coeﬃcients at Level 1 become outcome variables at Level
2. The intercept and subject speciﬁc treatment eﬀect vary
randomly across subjects (“random intercepts and slopes model”)
according to the regression models,

π0i = β00 + β01 GROUPi + r0i
π1i = β10 + β11 GROUPi + r1i

Here, β00 is the grand mean for the baseline outcome and
β10 is the average treatment eﬀect (for one unit of TIME, i.e., per
2 weeks). GROUPi is a dummy coded treatment contrast, with
a value of 1 for the experimental group and 0 for the control
group. r0i and r1i are subject speciﬁc random eﬀects that are
independent of eti and are assumed to have a bivariate normal
distribution over subjects.

After establishing the basic treatment eﬀect of the intervention
(including T1, T2, and T3), the uncontrolled model was then
extended in three distinct ways:

(a) Controlled model:

factors
potentially
including age (normalized to mean 0), gender (eﬀect
coded: male = −1, female = 1), trial site (eﬀect coded:
trial site 6 = −1) were introduced as additional predictors

confounding

(b) Intensity model: the categorical variable GROUPi was
substituted by the numerical measures of app use intensity:
sessions completed (values 0–28) and nights tracked (values
0–28), and

(c) Follow-up model: the follow-up measurement T4 was

included in a piecewise linear model.

group and time. Results of the multilevel analyses are based on
n = 532 participants (app group: n = 210; waitlist control group:
n = 322) and measurement occasions T1 (baseline), T2 (mid-
intervention), and T3 (post-intervention).4 Detailed results of the
basic treatment eﬀects are displayed in Table 3.

Stress
The results revealed an improvement in the experience of
general stress and cognitive stress with a continuous time-trend
toward experiencing less stress (signiﬁcant time slopes), as well
as a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups over time
(signiﬁcant group∗time interactions). Persons in the app group
experienced a greater decrease in both general and cognitive
stress from T1 to T3 compared to the waitlist control group.

Wellbeing
Similarly, regarding wellbeing, there was a signiﬁcant time-trend
toward reporting more wellbeing over time (signiﬁcant time
slope). Participants in the app group compared to the waitlist
control group reported signiﬁcantly more wellbeing over time
(signiﬁcant group∗time interaction).

Resilience
We could not conﬁrm our hypothesis with respect to resilience.
While there was
time-trend toward
indeed a signiﬁcant
reporting more resilience over time (signiﬁcant time slope), the
diﬀerence between the two groups over time was not signiﬁcant
(group∗time interaction n.s.).

Sleeping Troubles
Self-reported sleeping troubles improved over time with a
signiﬁcant trend toward reporting reduced sleeping troubles
(signiﬁcant time slope). The diﬀerence between the two groups

4Controlled model (see Supplementary Material): All analyses were rerun with
age, gender, and trial site as additional predictors (entered on Level 2). None of
the basic treatment eﬀects changed when we included the control variables. For
the extended models, sample sizes may diﬀer due to selectively missing data as
indicated in the respective tables.

was not signiﬁcant, even though descriptively, the app group
showed a larger improvement (group∗time interaction n.s.).

Intensity Model: Engagement With the
App as a Predictor
We conducted a second set of analyses to examine whether
app use intensity had an inﬂuence on changes in the DVs
over time. We hypothesized that the more interaction with the
app occurs over time, the larger the improvement. Speciﬁcally,
we examined whether the number of completed sessions (see
Table 4) and the number of tracked nights (see Supplementary
Material
for details) on the app predicted changes in the
DVs over time. On average, participants in the app group
completed M = 11.06 sessions (SD = 7.34, range: 1–28)
and tracked M = 3.61 nights (SD = 6.11, range: 0–25).
A substantial number of people in the app group (n = 111,
52.9%) did not track their sleep at all, and n = 22 (10.5%)
only tried once.

Conﬁrming Hypothesis 2, the results revealed that the more
sessions users completed, the less general and cognitive stress
they reported over time (signiﬁcant sessions∗time interactions).
The same applied to self-reported wellbeing: the more sessions
users completed, the larger their increase in wellbeing over time
(signiﬁcant sessions∗time interaction). In case of resilience, the
interaction eﬀect of sessions∗time also became signiﬁcant, while
it had only been trending when experimental group was the
predictor (see basic treatment eﬀects).
Regarding sleeping troubles,

the number of completed
sessions was only
an
improvement, yet descriptively the results pointed in the
expected direction. As the app oﬀers the option to track
sleep, and thus, focus speciﬁcally on creating awareness for
and improving this health-related issue, we included the
number of tracked nights instead of sessions as a predictor for
sleeping troubles. Number of tracked nights turned out to be a
signiﬁcant predictor for the improvement in sleeping troubles
over time (signiﬁcant nights∗time interaction, p < 0.001; see
Supplementary Material for details).

Social Community at Work and Physical
Health Impairment
Regarding the ﬁrst open research question, the results revealed
neither a signiﬁcant
time trend nor an intervention eﬀect
concerning participants’ perception of their social community
at work. The physical health impairment scale was included
as a measure that should be insensitive to the mental health
intervention. Indeed, we did not observe a change in physical
health over time and no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
two groups. Social community at work and physical health
impairment were also not aﬀected by app use intensity (i.e.,
sessions completed or nights tracked). This suggests that only
aspects of persons’ mental health but not their physical health
or perception of organizational climate were directly inﬂuenced
by using the app.

Follow-Up Model: Effects of App Use at
Follow-Up
Our second open research question aimed at examining the
sustainment of eﬀects after people stopped using the app in
comparison to the waitlist control group. Thus, in a third step, we
included the 2-week follow-up measurement occasion (T4) into
our analyses. To analyze a potentially non-linear continuation
into the follow-up trend, we incorporated two diﬀerently coded
time predictors into the hierarchical analyses (time1: 0-1-2-2;
time2: 0-0-0-1); additionally, group and the interaction terms
(time1∗group and time2∗group) served as predictors for the DVs.
The results revealed a signiﬁcant interaction of group and time2
regarding general stress (beta = 0.24, SE = 0.07, p < 0.001) and
wellbeing (beta = −0.15, SE = 0.07, p = 0.02), but not regarding
any of the other DVs (all ps > 0.18). Remarkably, these ﬁndings
indicate that while the eﬀects remained stable in the app group,
the control group signiﬁcantly improved from T3 to T4 (see
Figure 1 and see section “Discussion”).

DISCUSSION

market, and even fewer applications designed for workplace
interventions, which look at both individual mental health and
overall organizational culture change (e.g., Zhao et al., 2016;
Stratton et al., 2017; McKay et al., 2018). This RCT adds to the
sparse research on preventative mental health solutions in the
workplace. It was conducted in a ‘naturalistic environment’, as
it was implemented in diﬀerent work environments, in three
countries, and across disciplines. By executing the trial as an
experimental ﬁeld study, and as such, including a large variety of
workplaces and people, the current research bears high external
validity. Our results are in line with recent research ﬁndings,
suggesting that digital health interventions can improve mental
health-related outcomes in a work context (e.g., Tan et al., 2014;
Mistretta et al., 2018). Yet, they go beyond previous studies, as
this large-scale RCT included multiple workplaces and addressed
both, positive mental health of individuals and indicators of
organizational change. In addition to the core ﬁndings of this
study, we also discuss aspects of user attrition and sustained
engagement as important practical issues to address (cf. Howarth
et al., 2018; see section “Practical implications”).

Regarding individual mental health, the app was shown to
be eﬀective relative to a waitlist control group. Supporting our
hypotheses, the results of this RCT indicate that using the app
improves indicators of stress and wellbeing, and also, to a lesser
extent, resilience. The results further suggest that within the
app group, the positive eﬀects remained stable after a period
of 2 weeks without app usage. As indicated above, resilience
comprises both, a state and a trait component (cf. Windle, 2010).
Due to the fact that the resilience measure used in the current
research also incorporates trait-like aspects, improvements in
resilience likely require more time to develop. Job resources,
as deﬁned in the JDR (Demerouti et al., 2001), can take more
time to accrue than 4 weeks to realize their full potential
in stimulating personal growth. The actual content that users
chose on the app5 (i.e., the goals and sessions they self-selected
and completed within the interventional module), may further
explain the speciﬁc eﬀects on indicators of individual mental
health outcomes (i.e., stress, wellbeing, resilience). Overall,

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that there are only
few scientiﬁcally validated mobile health interventions on the

Mobile Health App to Improve Stress

FIGURE 1 | Development of (A) General Stress (scale 1–5), (B) Cognitive Stress (scale 1–5), (C) Sleeping Troubles (scale 1–5), (D) Wellbeing (scale 1–5), and
(E) Resilience (scale 1–7) over time from T1 to T4 (intervention phase from T1 to T3, follow-up from T3 to T4) depending on experimental group (app group vs.
waitlist control). Error bars represent 95% conﬁdence limits.

we found the app to be eﬀective to improve stress and
wellbeing outcomes of all employees, regardless of their age,
gender, and workplace.

improvement

To observe change processes in the organizations, we also
examined the outcome variable ‘social community at work’
(i.e., a measure of
the organizational climate). Based on
anecdotal evidence from users in previous trials, we assumed
that undergoing a joint wellbeing intervention may create
some “common ground” among employees and increase group
cohesiveness (Mistretta et al., 2018). Yet, no such eﬀects
manifested on the respective scale. However, we observed
in general stress and wellbeing
a signiﬁcant
within the waitlist control group from T3 to T4. Since these
improvements are conﬁned to those outcome variables that
responded to the intervention from T1-T3 (with cognitive stress
trending into a similar direction), but did not materialize on
the social community and physical health impairment scales,
we suggest that it is unlikely that these changes took place
only because of measurement eﬀects. They appear to be neither
random nor spontaneous. While we cannot provide a perfect
explanation for this eﬀect, we argue that eﬀective aspects
of the intervention may have spread across the organization
after the active treatment phase had ended, potentially due to
communication processes within the organizations. Previous

research has shown that positive behavior changes can be
contagious,
for example, by communicating social norms
(Goldstein et al., 2008). The current results are a ﬁrst indicator
that oﬀering a digital health solution in the workplace might
be beneﬁcial not only for those who decide to make use of
it, but also for their colleagues. Certainly, further research is
needed to examine these potential carry-over eﬀects over a
longer time period.

variety of evidence-based interventions that
challenges that employees might face in the work context, and
implements various science-backed behavior change strategies.
Our ﬁndings indicate that more intense use of the interventional
module of the app increased the beneﬁcial eﬀects on stress and
wellbeing, while speciﬁcally using the sleep tracking functionality
can help to reduce sleeping troubles. This highlights the impact
of self-monitoring and connects the study to a body of medical
literature documenting diary-based approaches to tackle sleep
impairment (Carney et al., 2012), in particular in the context
of mHealth (Lorenz and Williams, 2017). Taken together, the
current results support the assumption that building mobile

scientiﬁc methods bears great potential to positively inﬂuence
mental health-related outcomes (cf. Webb et al., 2010; Donker
et al., 2013; Bolier and Abello, 2014).

Practical Implications
Attrition in digital interventions is a challenge. Attrition rates can
spike with up to 64% in motivated, self-selected groups (Howells
et al., 2016); however, they are usually lower in regular working
samples (Payne et al., 2015; Howarth et al., 2018). This is a known
barrier to workplace interventions. Developers of digital mental
health interventions have been recommended to implement a
behavior change plan and an interactive framework to increase
user engagement (Bakker et al., 2016). The Kelaa Mental
Resilience App was developed based on these recommendations.
Yet, we also observed moderate to high rates of non-adherence to
the trial participation guidelines, in particular in the intervention
group. We acknowledge that app-based interventions might not
be suitable for everyone, which might have resulted in a self-
selection mechanism over time. Broadening the scope of the
content within the app while keeping the personalized approach
for each individual might help to make it more applicable for a
larger variety of users’ needs.

Further,

the relatively low compliance in questionnaire
completion and variance of completion rates between trial sites
suggests that company-speciﬁc communication strategies may
play a key role in user engagement. Strategies to make using the
mobile health intervention a more social experience, and thus,
increasing the sense of social community might be beneﬁcial
in intensifying intervention impact (e.g., van Dick and Haslam,
2012). Prevention programs can be targeted universally across an
organization, to individuals at high risk, or to individuals who
show initial symptoms of risk (Cuijpers et al., 2012). Creating and
implementing structured, targeted psychological interventions
is more likely to be eﬀective than generic stress management
trainings (Ebert et al., 2016). In line with previous research,
we suggest that interventions should be targeted at both the
individual and the organization, as the inclusion of team-based
interventions can improve workplace stress (Tan et al., 2014). In
general, the best outcomes may be achieved by providing the right
type of intervention to the respective population, as this ﬁt will
likely inﬂuence the results (see Stratton et al., 2017).

Limitations and Future Research
Directions
Despite our contribution to both research and practice, some
limitations need to be noted. First, our a priori sample
size calculation indicated that we would have needed more
participants (N = 561 vs. n = 532). Further, we acknowledge the
possibility of false positives due to multiple hypotheses testing.
However, the eﬀects that we found were large enough to be
detected with the given sample size. Therefore, we conclude that
the changes in the DVs, which originated from using the app,
were large enough to be meaningful for employees’ experiences
of stress and wellbeing.

Second, the sample was rather heterogeneous, as described
above. The over-representation of female participants as well
as the relatively high educational standard in the sample is

a reﬂection of the respective companies that participated in
the trial. Despite the statistical precautions that were taken
(see controlled model in the online Supplementary Material),
the ﬁndings may not apply to other workplace populations.
We recommend being cautious with over-generalizations
of the ﬁndings.

Third, the scales used to assess the DVs varied in terms
of their sensitivity to change. Thus, some may not have been
sensitive enough to capture smaller changes that occurred, such
as ﬂuctuations in mood. For instance, the scale that was used to
assess resilience targets rather stable (trait-like) features, while
the scales for stress and wellbeing are more sensitive to short-
term changes (states). This might have contributed to the less
clear-cut eﬀects for resilience. In addition, although previous
studies have also shown a positive impact in stress reduction,
these may not necessarily lead to an impact on work-related
outcomes such as absenteeism (Joyce et al., 2016). More research
in this area is needed.

Fourth, we did not conduct the study at enough trial sites,
and we could not recruit suﬃcient participants within each
site to include organization as a third level into our multilevel
analyses. Thus, the questions remain whether we are able to
generalize the ﬁndings across trial sites and whether it was
more eﬀective at certain sites compared to others. The results
of the controlled model suggest that the treatment eﬀect was
present at all sites, regardless of diﬀerences in employees’ stress
and wellbeing baselines (see Supplementary Material). However,
this ﬁnding should not be overgeneralized. Working with larger
datasets by including more trial sites and associated context
variables would allow a data-driven tailoring of the mobile health
intervention to ﬁt the individual needs of each organization
and its employees.

Fifth, due to the personalization, and thus, the large variability
in how people used the app, regarding both the tracking and
the interventional module, we cannot conclude which of the
elements contributed to the app being eﬀective in reducing
stress and increasing wellbeing. In order to identify the best
combination of interventions and the most eﬀective elements
of the app, more data points would be needed. Analyses with
larger data sets, which include detailed information on user
metrics, could lead to more eﬃcient interventions. To gain
more diﬀerentiated insight, we support the call for better ways
to assess the eﬀectiveness of apps for health behavior change
(McKay et al., 2018).

Last, due to the naturalistic nature of the RCT, there was
a range of factors that could not be controlled for, and which
therefore may have inﬂuenced the DVs over and above the
intervention. Thus, at the cost of the high external validity,
our study has rather low internal validity. While participants
in both treatment and control group were instructed not to
discuss contents of the study with members of the other group,
it is diﬃcult to enforce this constraint in practice. Both in the
controlled and uncontrolled model, we witnessed signiﬁcant
eﬀects of time, irrespective of experimental group, for stress,
wellbeing, resilience, and sleeping troubles (signiﬁcant time
slopes). These eﬀects were consistently smaller than the treatment
eﬀects, yet noteworthy. We suspect that they may result from
perceived changes to the organizational context due to the sheer

existence of the intervention. Recruitment eﬀorts within the
organizations, which included advertisements for an ‘innovation
and research project’, likely have signaling eﬀects for employees to

the United Kingdom. All members of the EAB either signaled
“favorable opinion” or “favorable opinion with additional

applicable institutional and national guidelines and regulations.
Data protection policies according to GDPR guidelines were

participants gave their informed consent in written form.

CONCLUSION

This paper presents conclusive evidence that a smartphone-
based health intervention that is grounded in the JDR (Bakker
and Demerouti, 2007) can decrease levels of perceived stress
and sleeping troubles, and improve subjective wellbeing and
resilience after 4 weeks, with sustained results at a 6-week
follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, the current project
oﬀers the ﬁrst large-scale, multi-center RCT using a theoretically
sound smartphone application to manage and reduce stress in
a work context, based on a sample of employees at various
companies. The study therefore contributes to closing the
empirical evidence gap concerning the eﬀectiveness of app-
based interventions to manage stress and positive mental health
at work,
in order to fulﬁll their potential as “enabler[s] of
change” (Stevenson and Farmer, 2017, p. 7). While mental
health professionals in traditional health care have an ethical
obligation to provide patients with theoretically and empirically
sound interventions (e.g., American Psychological Association,
2002; American Counseling Association, 2014), we argue that
organizations should do the same for their employees. To reduce
the costs of ill-health and keep organizations and their employees
thriving, more research on eﬀective solutions to positive mental
health in the workplace is needed.
