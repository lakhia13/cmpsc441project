Objective To illustrate adolescent self-regulation as a foundation for both individual and interpersonal pro-
cesses in adolescent chronic illness self-management. Method Literature review. Results Research has
identified multiple individual (e.g., self-efficacy, coping, and adherence) and interpersonal factors (parental
monitoring and friend support) that are sources of risk and resilience to adolescent chronic illness self-man-
agement. In this article, we highlight literature consistent with the idea that self-regulation (including cogni-
tive, emotional, and behavioral regulation) underlies both individual and interpersonal sources of risk and
resilience across development. Conclusions This self-regulation approach has multiple benefits: A
parsimonious construct for explaining both individual and interpersonal processes that contribute to risk and
resilience for chronic illness self-management, the incorporation of methods used in developmental and
health psychology research, including performance-based, physiological, daily, and ecological momentary
assessment, and a new look to interventions that target self-regulation as a way to improve individual and
interpersonal processes in chronic illness self-management.

Key words

adherence; adolescents; chronic illness; developmental perspectives.

Management of chronic illnesses requires completion of
complex and challenging adherence behaviors for adoles-
cents and their families (Sawyer, Drew, Yeo, & Britto,
2007). Chronic illness self-management involves a self-reg-
ulatory process of completing adherence behaviors in the
context of competing emotions, cognitions, and behaviors
(e.g., testing blood glucose despite feeling hopeless and
planning when to take medications during the school
day). Research supports that self-regulation and chronic
illness self-management are associated in adolescence.
For example, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, better
self-control, emotional processing, and fewer daily self-reg-
ulatory failures are associated with better adherence and
metabolic control (Berg et al., 2014; Hughes, Berg, &
Wiebe, 2012).

Though the importance of self-regulation to managing
a chronic illness in adolescence may appear obvious, re-
search has typically examined self-regulatory processes

separately (e.g., coping, mood, or externalizing behaviors)
and in isolation from interpersonal processes (e.g., family
conflict and peer relationships). In this article, we illustrate
how self-regulation may serve as a foundation for both in-
dividual and interpersonal sources of risk and resilience for
chronic illness self-management and health. Also, we dis-
cuss the benefits of this self-regulation approach to study-
ing adolescent chronic illness self-management and make
recommendations for future research and intervention.

Self-Regulation as a Foundation for
Individual and Interpersonal Processes in
A Chronic Illness Self-Management

Across the life span, the effects of self-regulation on health
and well-being are far reaching (Moffitt et al., 2011).
Self-regulation is defined as the adolescent’s ability to
modulate cognition, emotion, and behavior toward a goal

(Baumeister, Vohs, & Tice, 2007). This includes both in-
dividual (e.g., I will test my blood glucose during class
today) and interpersonal goals (e.g., I will not get into a
battle with my mother over my blood glucose values at
dinner
tonight; Coan, 2011; Vohs, Ciarocco, &
Baumeister, 2004). In healthy individuals, self-regulation
has been linked to health behaviors, self-efficacy, stress and
coping skills, health beliefs, and family processes, many of
the same sources of risk and resilience that are associated
with chronic illness self-management (Blair & Diamond,
2008; Brody & Ge, 2001). Further, better self-regulation
is associated with better academic achievement, interper-
sonal success, physical health and adjustment, and fewer
behavioral and emotional problems (Blair & Diamond,
2008; Finkenauer, Engels, & Baumeister, 2005; Tangney,
Baumeister, & Boone, 2004). These far-reaching effects of
self-regulation on the health and well-being in healthy
individuals are theorized to occur because of the role of
self-regulation as a foundation for both individual and in-
terpersonal processes.

Chronic illness self-management is similarly facilitated
by a variety of
individual and interpersonal processes
(Modi et al., 2012), and we argue that these draw on
self-regulation (see Figure 1). In adolescence, chronic ill-
ness self-management is defined, according to Modi et al.
(2012), as ‘‘the interaction of health behaviors and related
processes that patients and families engage in to care for a
chronic condition’’
(p. e476). Across chronic illness
diagnoses, tasks associated with efficacious chronic illness
self-management are diverse, yet consistently complex and
disruptive to daily living (Sawyer et al., 2007). Adolescents
may engage in such tasks with their family and within other
close relationships (friends, siblings, and romantic part-
ners), as well as with individuals in their community
(e.g., school teachers and coaches) and those within the
health-care system for a collaborative, interpersonal man-
agement process (Martinez, Jocelyn, & Legato, 2011; Modi
et al., 2012).

For an adolescent and family to engage in efficacious
chronic illness self-management, the adolescent needs a
foundation of self-regulation skills. As adolescents set
goals to manage their chronic illness, they must regulate
their cognitions (e.g., thoughts about pain), emotions (e.g.,
embarrassment with managing disease around friends),
and behaviors (e.g., checking blood glucose), toward the
goal of achieving health. For example, adherence, or how
closely a person follows and meets the guidelines of their
prescribed health-care recommendations, is a commonly
studied metric of chronic illness self-management, and
an established mediator of health outcomes in adolescent
chronic illness (Graves, Roberts, Rapoff, & Boyer, 2010).

their capacity to produce a desired result),

Adhering to one’s illness regimen requires an individual to
(i.e., beliefs
have self-efficacy for disease management
about
to
manage stress via effective coping and problem-solving
skills, to have healthier beliefs regarding the chronic illness,
and to have fewer internalizing and externalizing symptoms
(Compas, Jaser, Dunn, & Rodriguez, 2012; Hill-Briggs &
Gemmell, 2007; Sawyer et al., 2007). In healthy children
and adolescents, similar processes, such as internalizing
and externalizing behaviors, health behaviors, and coping
skills, are viewed as developing in conjunction with self-
regulation (Blair & Diamond, 2008; Repetti, Taylor, &
Seeman, 2002). Thus, the consistent relations of these pro-
cesses with each other and chronic illness self-management
can be viewed as all drawing on self-regulation.

In further support of the foundational nature of self-
regulation for chronic illness self-management, there is a
growing body of literature in pediatrics on the association
of neurocognitive processes, such as executive function
and attention, with chronic illness self-management. We
define executive functions as ‘‘cognitive abilities that are
important for organizing information,
for planning and
problem solving, and for orchestrating thought and
action in goal-directed behavior’’ (Blair & Ursache, 2011,
p. 300). Thus, executive functions undergird the volitional
aspects of self-regulation. Research finds that deficits in

Also, adolescent attention—for example, attention to phys-
ical changes in symptoms, in particular, those that cue
adherence behaviors (e.g., wheezing in asthma)—is related
to chronic illness self-management (Compas & Boyer,
2001). These findings support the notion that adolescent

Our conceptualization of self-regulation as a founda-
tion for chronic illness self-management also includes in-
terpersonal processes, such as an adolescent’s ability to use
interpersonal resources (Vohs et al., 2004). Typically, the
interpersonal context in pediatrics is characterized by a
broad array of ways that parents, peers, and health-care
providers influence adolescents’ disease management (sup-
port and monitoring). Evidence for the importance of ad-
olescents’
to these interpersonal
processes comes from work showing that features of pa-
rental involvement, such as parental knowledge, are actu-
ally reflective of how adolescents involve their parents in
diabetes management (Osborn, Berg, Hughes, Pham, &
Wiebe, 2013). Additionally, research in healthy adoles-
cents suggests that many individual self-regulation skills
can be recast as both individual and interpersonal
in
nature. For example, adolescents must regulate their cog-
nitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to unrequested
parental involvement in disease management, a common
source of conflict (Dekovic, 1999). Consistent with this,
healthy adolescents who experience poor self-regulation
increased conflict with their family and peers,
report
along with deficits
in psychosocial health (Hughes,
Crowell, Uyeji, & Coan, 2012). From this perspective, in-
terpersonal processes that affect chronic illness self-
management, such as parental monitoring, adolescent
disclosure, and family conflict, also draw on a foundation
of adolescent self-regulatory skills.

Further, our perspective that adolescent self-regulation
is an individual and interpersonal process, rather than a
process existing only within the self, is supported by re-
search that traces the development of self-regulation in
adolescence and adulthood to early parent–child relation-
ships (Hughes, Crowell et al., 2012). As depicted in
Figure 2, self-regulation is theorized to develop dynami-
cally in coordination with stress regulatory systems (i.e.,
stress reactivity and temperament) and the family social
environment across development (Blair & Raver, 2012;
Lewis, 2000; Repetti et al., 2002; Repetti, Robles, &
Reynolds, 2011). Additionally, in a pediatric population,

the illness

the chronic illness also enters into this coordinated system
and may alter the development of self-regulation or be af-
fected by the preceding developmental history, depending
on when in development
is diagnosed.
Coordination implies that the intricate and transactional
relations of self-regulation, stress regulatory systems, and
the family social environment are best explained as moving
in similar patterns across time, rather than by uni- or bidi-
rectional effects. For example, analogous social and neuro-
biological processes have been found to underlie both early
attachment and the subsequent emotion regulation later in
development (Coan, 2011). At any given snapshot in time,
an individual’s capacity for self-regulation is an outcome of
this coordinated process. Given this coordinative perspec-
tive, self-regulation may be a foundation, and a barometer,
for understanding both individual and interpersonal
sources of risk and resilience for chronic illness self-
management and health in adolescence.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Using this self-regulation perspective toward understand-
ing chronic illness self-management has benefits for
pediatric research. Foremost, this perspective views self-
regulation as underlying both individual and interpersonal
sources of risk and resilience for chronic illness self-
management. Research findings in adolescent chronic ill-
ness self-management often indicate analogous relations
among multiple individual and interpersonal sources of
risk and resilience for chronic illness self-management
(e.g., King et al., 2012). For example, adolescents who
have high negative affect, poor coping skills, as well as
high family and peer conflict struggle to engage in effective
chronic illness self-management. Our self-regulation per-
spective provides a rationale for consistency in these find-
ings: Adolescents who have deficits in self-regulation will
be more likely to have deficits in individual (e.g., self-effi-
cacy, coping, adherence, and psychopathology) and inter-
personal processes

These self-regulatory deficits are likely the result of the co-
ordination of developing self-regulation with the family

self-regulatory processes (e.g., coping and mood)
should be examined together with how individuals
regulate and are regulated by others (e.g., disclo-
sure vs. secrecy to parents; Osborn et al., 2013).
2. Self-regulation research can be conducted in many pe-

diatric populations. Research using this self-
regulation perspective would benefit not only the
study of chronic illness self-management but also
the study of health behaviors (e.g., sexual health
and eating), acute illnesses, and accident/injury
prevention.

3. Expansion of measurement of self-regulation.

Drawing on research on self-regulation from devel-
opmental and health psychology, the measurement
of self-regulation can expand beyond individual
difference metrics that rely heavily on self-report.
A multimethod approach incorporating self-report
as well as physiology and performance measures
of self-regulation may clarify the associations of
self-regulation, stress regulatory systems, and
family/social environments in chronic illness self-
management. This multimethod approach should
also be used in longitudinal studies that examine
these same associations over time. Also, inclusion
of daily and ecological momentary assessments
would illuminate potential differences between ad-
olescents’ trait self-regulatory capacity and actual-
ized daily self-regulation. Such methods may
reveal that in addition to individual differences in
self-regulation, there are day-to-day fluctuations
that arise in daily life (see Berg et al., 2014).

4. Extension of self-regulatory challenges in chronically
ill adolescents to other domains. Given the link be-
tween self-regulation and a broad array of youth
outcomes, it is likely that adolescents who struggle
with self-regulation skills surrounding managing
their chronic illness also struggle to regulate a vari-
ety of life domains (Moffitt et al., 2011). Poor self-
regulation in the context of chronic illness may
extend to other important domains, including aca-
demic achievement and social functioning.

5. Assessment of self-regulation. Given the broad influ-
ence of adolescent self-regulation in chronic illness
self-management, clinicians would benefit from as-
sessing self-regulation in the clinic. Brief self-
report assessments such as the Brief Self-Control
Scale (Finkenauer et al., 2005; Hughes, Berg et al.,
2012), which is used to examine self-regulation in
both healthy and chronic illness samples, may be
useful in conjunction with performance-based
measures (O’Hara & Holmbeck, 2013).

6. Interventions for self-regulation could include both
individual and interpersonal components. As inter-
ventions are developed for self-regulation, targeting
specific self-regulatory skills (e.g., scaffolding effec-
tive emotion regulation through cognitive-
behavioral or stress-reduction interventions) may
have an effect on not only individual but also in-
terpersonal outcomes. Given the developmental
course of self-regulation, interventions for self-reg-
ulation targeted toward early prevention for young
children diagnosed with a chronic illness may be

Topical Review 1095

most beneficial (Blair & Diamond, 2008; Romer,
Duckworth, Sznitman, & Park, 2010). Further, in-
terventions that target developing neurocognitive
processes that undergird self-regulation (e.g., com-
puterized or aerobic interventions for executive
function development) will also be important to
consider (Diamond & Lee, 2011).

The field of pediatric psychology has examined many
sources of individual and interpersonal risk and resilience
for chronic illness self-management. The construct of self-
regulation has the potential to integrate these various fac-
tors and provide parsimony in understanding how to
assess and intervene to improve chronic illness self-
management throughout development.
