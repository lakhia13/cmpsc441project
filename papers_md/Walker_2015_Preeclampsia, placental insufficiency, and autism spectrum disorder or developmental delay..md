Importance—Increasing evidence suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and many 
forms of developmental delay (DD) originate during fetal development. Preeclampsia may trigger 
aberrant neurodevelopment through placental, maternal and fetal physiologic mechanisms.

Objective—To determine whether preeclampsia is associated with ASD and/or DD.

Design, Setting and Participants—The CHildhhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the 
Environment (CHARGE) Study is a population-based case-control investigation of ASD and/or 
DD origins. Children from 20 California counties aged 24-60 months at the time of recruitment, 
and living in catchment areas with a biologic parent fluent in English or Spanish were enrolled 
from January 29, 2003 through April 7, 2011. Children with ASD (n=517) and DD (n=194) were 
recruited through the California Department of Developmental Services, the Medical Investigation 
of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute and referrals. Controls with typical 
development (TD) controls (n=350) were randomly selected from birth records and frequency-
matched on age, sex, and broad geographic region. Physicians diagnosing preeclampsia were 
masked to neurodevelopmental outcome, and those assessing neurodevelopmental function were 
masked to preeclampsia status.

Exposure—Preeclampsia and placental insufficiency were self-reported and abstracted from 
medical records.

Main Outcome Measure—The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Autism 
Diagnostic Interview–Revised were used to confirm ASD, whereas children with DD and TD 
were confirmed by Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and 
were free of autistic symptoms. Hypotheses were formulated before data collection.

Results—Children with ASD were twice as likely to have been exposed in utero to preeclampsia 
as controls with TD after adjustment for maternal educational level, parity, and prepregnancy 
obesity (adjusted odds ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.18-4.68); risk increased with greater preeclampsia 
severity (test for trend p=0.02). Placental insufficiency appeared responsible for the increase in 
DD risk associated with severe preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.06-14.64).

Conclusions and Relevance—Preeclampsia, particularly severe disease, is associated with 
ASD and DD. Faulty placentation manifests in the mother as preeclampsia with vascular damage, 
enhanced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance; in the placenta as oxygen and nutrient 
transfer restriction and oxidative stress; and in the fetus as growth restriction and progressive 
hypoxemia. All are potential mechanisms for neurodevelopmental compromise.

INTRODUCTION

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobehavioral condition identified in 1 in 68 U.S. 
children and is part of a broader group of developmental disabilities that affects 1 in 6 
children.1 In the prevailing etiologic theory for ASD, environmental influences factor 
prominently in mechanisms for neurodevelopmental programming during critical periods in 
genetically-susceptible individuals.2 Physiologic and architectural changes identified in the 
brains of children and adults with ASD indicate that its pathophysiologic mechanism likely 
originates during fetal development.3 Gestational conditions and obstetric complications 
have been linked to ASD, 4-11 but research on mechanisms that might explain the 
associations is still lacking. Neuropathogenic processes in the gestational environment,

including infection,12-14 inflammation,15 oxidative stress,16 fetal hypoxia,17 micronutrient 
insufficiency,18 and metabolic dysfunction,19 have been proposed to play some role in the 
etiology of ASD.

Developmental delay (DD) is a diagnosis applied to young children who have low cognitive 
function in addition to significant limitations in at least 2 other developmental domains.20 
Etiologic paradigms for DD are as diverse as the component conditions, and although 
genetic and congenital causes are implicated in up to 50% of affected children, 
environmental exposures (including antenatal toxin exposure, central nervous system 
infections, hypoxicischemic encephalopathy, cerebral dysgenesis, and early severe 
psychosocial deprivation) likely enhance risk during critical fetal and postnatal periods.21 
Maternal prepregnancy obesity, diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension during 
pregnancy have been associated with DD and specific impairments in visual reception, 
motor skills, receptive and expressive language, adaptive communication and 
socialization.19 Prematurity and fetal growth restriction, both commonly associated with 
severe preeclampsia, are significantly and independently related to DD severity.22

Preeclampsia is a complex multisystem disorder unique to the latter half of pregnancy that 
can lead to severe maternal and fetal morbidity and even mortality. The condition is more 
common in first pregnancies and maternal age extremes,23 and risk appears to be modulated 
considerably by underlying maternal metabolic and cardiovascular health.24 The most 
prominent causal paradigm for preeclampsia is predicated on a model of shallow 
placentation25 marked by hypo-perfusion that reduces concentrations of angiogenic growth 
factors and increases placental debris in the maternal circulation, culminating in a robust 
maternal immune response and damage to the maternal, placental and fetal circulatory 
systems.26 Classic features of preeclampsia include progressive hypertension, edema, and 
proteinuria (though new guidelines no longer require proteinuria for diagnosis),27 and severe 
variants manifest evidence of maternal brain, liver or kidney deterioration and/or placental 
insufficiency, a clinical syndrome characterized by fetal growth restriction, reduced 
amniotic fluid, and suboptimal fetal oxygenation.28 Although placental insufficiency may 
arise without maternal hypertension, failed placental vascular remodeling appears to be a 
unifying mechanism for both conditions.29 Women with preeclampsia are more likely to 
deliver early, either spontaneously or by elective intervention to prevent complications from 
maternal and/or fetal deterioration.26

Preeclampsia has been examined as a risk factor for ASD in multiple investigations with 
mixed results. Seventeen studies of variable quality published before 2007 that examined 
preeclampsia in association with autism had substantial unexplained heterogeneity of effect 
estimates.7 Four large population-based case-control studies8-11 reported statistically 
significant increased adjusted odds of ASD after pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. 
Fetal growth restriction and premature delivery occur more commonly with preeclampsia, 
and are associated with DD22 and ASD.4,5,30,31

The first objective of this study was to examine the association between preeclampsia and 
ASD or DD in a population-based case-control study with confirmed diagnoses. The second 
aim was to explore whether preeclampsia severity and/or placental insufficiency increased

the odds of ASD or DD. Given the co-occurrence of intellectual impairments among many 
individuals with ASD, we included the DD group in our analyses to examine whether 
findings were specific to ASD or rather associated with cognitive delays in general.

METHODS

The CHildhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study is a 
population-based case-control study of children from three groups: children with ASD, 
children with DD without ASD, and children with typical development (TD).32 Children 
with ASD and DD were recruited from lists provided by the California Department of 
Developmental Services; referred from the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental 
Disorders (MIND) Institute, University of California, Davis, local physicians, or regional 
centers that contracted with the California Department of Developmental Services; or self-
referred after public outreach efforts. Population controls were selected randomly from 
California birth files with a male-to-female ratio of 4:1 and frequency-matched for age and 
broad geographic regions within the study catchment areas.

Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 24 to 60 months, (2) residence with at least one biologic 
parent, (3) English or Spanish spoken by at least one parent, (4) birth in California, and (5) 
living within specified catchment areas in California. Children with severe visual, hearing or 
motor impairments that precluded standardized developmental assessment were excluded. 
Participants in this analysis were enrolled between January 29, 2003 through April 7, 2011. 
The institutional review boards at the University of California, Davis, and the University of 
California, Los Angeles, and the State of California Committee for the Protection of Human 
Subjects approved this study, and informed consent was obtained.

We used 2 sources of data to establish our exposure variable and covariates. We abstracted 
diagnoses and supporting information from medical records when available. Records were 
reviewed multiple times by trained staff and inconsistencies were resolved. Mild 
preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension were combined, and severe preeclampsia 
included HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count) syndrome. 
We considered women with preeclampsia to have severe disease if it was documented in 
their record or if they had preeclampsia with evidence of placental insufficiency, a 
composite that involved intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios and/or non-
reassuring fetal test results. In the absence of medical records, we relied on maternal self-
report in a telephone interview conducted in English or Spanish.32 Mothers were asked 
whether a medical professional had told them they had preeclampsia or toxemia during their 
pregnancy. We had self-report data from 1002 participants (94.4%), maternal records 
from823 (77.6%), and data from both in 764 (72.0%); agreementwas substantial (κ = 0.66, 
95% CI, 0.55-0.77).

We examined demographic factors and pregnancy outcomes. All federally, state, or locally 
funded programs, except for military insurance, were included under government payer; 
military programs were categorized as private because they function as employer-sponsored 
health insurances. Maternal factors examined as potential confounders of the associations 
between preeclampsia and child's diagnosis were: periconceptional folic acid intake,18,33

smoking and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use during pregnancy,34-37 
residential air pollution exposure,18,38 and prepregnancy obesity, diabetes or chronic 
hypertension,19,24 were evaluated for their influence as confounders. We merged 
pregestational (types 1 and 2) and gestational diabetes mellitus into a diabetes variable and 
calculated the prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) as maternal self-reported weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters and categorized women as obese (BMI≥ 
30), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), health weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), or underweight 
(BMI<18.5).

Our outcome was child developmental status, categorized as ASD, DD, and TD. Highly 
trained research-reliable health care professionals administered standardized assessments to 
establish developmental diagnosis and functional level. Bilingual, bicultural health care 
professionals evaluated children from Spanish-speaking families. Outcome determination 
has been described previously.19 Briefly, children with a previous ASD diagnosis were 
examined using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the primary caregiver was 
administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised. Diagnostic confirmation required 
scores over established cutoffs on both instruments. Children with DD and population 
controls were screened for ASD using the Social Communication Questionnaire; those with 
scores above the cutoff (score of ≥15) were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule and Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised and reclassified to the 
ASD group if they met the criteria. Adaptive function was evaluated on all children using 
the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and cognitive function was measured with the 
Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Inclusion criteria for the TD group were population 
control with a composite Mullen Scales of Early Learning standard score of 70 or higher, an 
overall Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales score of 70 or higher, and a Social 
Communication Questionnaire score less than15, whereas DD inclusion criteria were a 
Mullen Scales of Early Learning score less than 70 and / or a Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
Scales score less than 70 and a Social Communication Questionnaire score less than 15.

We studied 1061 children from singleton pregnancies with a confirmed diagnosis and 
preeclampsia status (517 children with ASD, 350 children with TD, and 194 children with 
DD). Seven women had 2 index pregnancies, leaving 1054 distinct mothers.

We generated a conceptual framework in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph to guide our 
analysis of underlying causal relationships (eFigure 1). Analyses were performed with SAS 
statistical software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). Box plots were generated with GraphPad 
Prism software, version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc). We screened 
covariates for association with exposure and outcome, using p<0.20 as a threshold for 
selection as a potential confounder.39 Categorical variables were analyzed using likelihood-
ratio Chi-square tests and continuous variables were compared using analysis of variance. 
Multinomial logistic regression models that controlled for maternal factors were developed 
to examine the association between preeclampsia (complete dataset) and preeclampsia 
severity (medical-record subset) with developmental outcomes. We compared these with 
parallel models adjusted for differential self-selection bias by weighting to the inverse 
probability of participation based on maternal educational level, insurance status at delivery, 
and child's recruitment case group. The potential for exposure misclassification was

assessed. Final models were not restricted to mothers with complete data on all covariates 
considered.

RESULTS

No differences were found between children with ASD and population controls with respect 
to race/ethnicity, parity, gestational length, or birthweight extremes (Table 1 and eFigure 2 
in the Supplement). Mothers of children with DD were more likely to be of minority ethnic 
or racial status, not to have received a bachelor's degree, to have had a government payer for 
delivery, to have high parity and to have delivered prematurely. Children with DD were 
born a week earlier compared with children with ASD or TD. Control children were more 
likely to have resided in Northern California, an effect of recruitment efforts. A total of 62 
children with DD (33.2%), 10 children with ASD (2.1%), and none of the children with TD 
had a known chromosomal, genetic or mitochondrial disorder.

As has been reported previously, mothers of children with ASD or DD were less likely than 
mothers of children with TD to have taken periconceptional folic acid supplementation 
(Table 2).18 Other factors previously reported from the CHARGE study (prepregnancy 
obesity, diabetes, and hypertension,19 gestational SSRI use,37 and residence near a freeway 
at delivery18) were more common in this sample of mothers of children with ASD and DD. 
Among those with medical record documentation, 27 (54%) of women with preeclampsia 
received magnesium sulfate during labor for seizure prophylaxis and 5 (0.6%) of women 
without preeclampsia received magnesium sulfate to treat preterm labor (Table 3).

Preeclampsia complicated the gestations of children with ASD more than twice as often as 
those of children with TD (Table 3). Among participants with medical records, mothers of 
children with ASD and DD were significantly more likely to have had placental 
insufficiency, severe preeclampsia or both compared with mothers of children with TD. In 
final models adjusted for confounding by maternal educational level, prepregnancy obesity 
and parity; women with preeclampsia had more than double the risk of having a child with 
ASD compared with women without this condition (adjusted odds ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 
1.18-4.68) (Table 4). Combining placental insufficiency and/or preeclampsia into one 
variable did not appear to confer additional risk in the ASD analysis, although a substantial 
number of women had placental insufficiency without preeclampsia; in contrast, DD was 
substantially more likely when placental compromise was identified. In subset analyses that 
explored cognitive function among children with ASD, preeclampsia was associated with 
low-functioning ASD compared with children with TD; the numbers were too small in the 
high-functioning ASD group for further analyses. Multinomial logistic regression model 
results were not demonstrably affected by most candidate confounders (eTable 1). Weighted 
and unweighted analyses were not materially different, suggesting minimal influence from 
participation (selection) bias.

Comparison of exposure source in various models revealed important distinctions (eTable 
2). Recall bias was evident in the subset of women whose preeclampsia status could be 
determined by both medical record and self-report, with estimated odds 40% higher for ASD 
and 30% higher for DD when preeclampsia was defined using self-report (ignoring the

medical record). These differences suggest that case mothers were overreporting 
preeclampsia in the interview, control mothers were underreporting or a mix of both (i.e., 
differential misclassification).

In models restricted to medical record data, substantial ASD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29; 95% 
CI, 0.97-5.43) and DD risk (adjusted odds ratio, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.06-14.64) was found 
among mothers with severe preeclampsia (Figure). Trend analysis was significant in both 
models, with a dose-response effect in the ASD vs TD comparison (p = 0.02) and a 
threshold effect in the DD vs TD analysis (p = 0.004), likely reflecting the strong influence 
of placental insufficiency in the DD model. These dose-response results must be viewed 
with caution because only 7 of 270 women with children with TD experienced severe 
preeclampsia and/or placental insufficiency.

DISCUSSION

Fetal exposure to preeclampsia was associated significantly with development of ASD in 
children from the CHARGE study, and the association was more robust in those pregnancies 
complicated by severe disease. Preeclampsia was associated with DD primarily in severe 
presentations that involved placental insufficiency.

The literature is inconsistent with respect to preeclampsia and ASD. In older studies 
designed to identify multiple gestational risk factors for ASD, one study4 found no 
association for hypertensive disorders in general, another study5 found no association for 
preeclampsia, and yet another study6 noted that their preeclampsia prevalence of 3.9% 
among cases was consistent with the general population rate. Exposure and outcome 
ascertainment was suboptimal in these analyses, which controlled for a set of intrapartum 
and neonatal factors that may have biased the results. We measured exposures and outcomes 
objectively and our analysis plan assessed covariates according to principles of confounding 
that take into account causal pathways.39 Specifically, because our overarching aim was to 
estimate the total effect on risk for ASD or DD from preeclampsia or the combination of 
preeclampsia and placental insufficiency, it was critical not to adjust for pathway 
intermediates such as preterm birth or low birthweight, both of which commonly result from 
these conditions.4,5,22,30,31

Other population-based epidemiologic studies that had greater statistical power and used 
more objective administrative data sources to identify preeclampsia and neurodevelopmental 
outcome have found an increased risk of ASD among children exposed to preeclampsia, 
with point estimates ranging from 1.24 to 1.85. 8-11 Higher odds in the current study may 
reflect the fact that enhanced ASD risk primarily involved severe preeclampsia and placental 
insufficiency identified from medical records that would not as easily have been captured 
from administrative sources or self-report.

The enhanced odds of DD in women with severe preeclampsia presentations that involved 
placental insufficiency parallels the literature of non-genetic DD causes which now include 
fetal growth restriction and prematurity in addition to classic traumatic insults to the fetal 
brain in the form of hypoxia, infection or toxin exposure.22

There are several mechanisms by which preeclampsia may affect the developing brain. 
Suboptimal uteroplacental perfusion arises from abnormal trophoblast differentiation during 
embryogenesis28 and the effects of vascular compromise progress at a variable rate through 
gestation. Abnormal trophoblast bilayer foldings have been associated with ASD.40

For the fetus, limitations in nutrient and oxygen availability cause progressive oxidative 
stress, prompting syncytiotrophoblast release of proteins into the maternal bloodstream in an 
effort to improve circulation. These proteins promote maternal vascular and immune 
responses that greatly exaggerate baseline systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and 
vascular endothelial changes.24

Although difficult to measure retrospectively and outside the scope of the current 
investigation, acute and chronic fetal hypoxia and resulting oxidative stress have been 
implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and as risks for ASD. Nonspecific 
surrogates, such as low Apgar scores, fetal distress, cesarean delivery, and bleeding during 
pregnancy, have been associated with ASD.41 Umbilical blood pH at birth is a more precise 
measure of acute hypoxia and was weakly associated with ASD in one study.17

An etiologic role for heightened maternal systemic inflammation in autism is highly 
plausible. Fetal exposure to maternal allergies, autoimmune diseases42 and maternal 
infections12-14 have also been associated with ASD. Although direct fetal brain infection is 
possible, untreated maternal fever14 and the proinflammatory milieu accompanying systemic 
infection13 may compromise the placenta and fetal compartments, predisposing patients to 
ASD. Some maternal cytokines, most notably interleukin 6, appear able to cross the placenta 
and enter fetal circulation where they have the potential to modulate neuronal proliferation, 
survival, differentiation and function.

Maternal metabolic dysregulation, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance are 
prominent features of obesity, diabetes and chronic hypertension, which are associated with 
preeclampsia24 and ASD.19 Women with preeclampsia are twice as likely to be obese, and 
increasing obesity prevalence has paralleled the increase in preeclampsia in the United 
States23 Markers of increased insulin resistance are apparent in the first trimesters of 
preeclamptic pregnancies and persist after birth, suggesting baseline maternal metabolic 
derangements not unique to gestation.24 Excess weight and other maternal metabolic 
conditions have been associated with ASD in multiple populations.11,19

There is substantial strength in this case-control study. Our population-based sampling and 
large sample size enabled examination of rare exposures. We explored information bias in 
our exposure extensively by comparing self-report across subsets of the data and validating 
with objective clinical sources. Medical record availability for a large subset of participants 
allowed us to better ascertain mild and severe preeclampsia variants and placental 
insufficiency using confirmatory physical findings and test results; such details are not 
accessed commonly by researchers. Case status was confirmed with rigorous 
neurodevelopmental and behavioral assessment by trained and reliability-tested staff. The 
level of detail obtained by the CHARGE study on predictors, confounders, and outcomes 
enabled a comprehensive exploration of this topic.

CONCLUSIONS

Page 9

We found significant associations between preeclampsia and ASD that increased with 
presentation severity; we also observed a significant association between severe 
preeclampsia and/or placental insufficiency and DD. Although single studies cannot 
establish causality, the cumulative evidence supports efforts to reduce preeclampsia and 
diminish severity to improve neonatal outcomes. Optimization of metabolic health before 
and throughout gestation may improve placental perfusion and should be investigated. 
Maternal administration of low-dose aspirin has shown modest benefit, and use of statins 
shows promise given their ability to diminish angiogenic signaling, endothelial injury, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation pathways implicated in preeclampsia's pathogenesis.43 
Finally, a deeper understanding of these complex etiologic pathways will be of clinical 
utility in managing pregnancies and timing the deliveries of women with preeclampsia.
