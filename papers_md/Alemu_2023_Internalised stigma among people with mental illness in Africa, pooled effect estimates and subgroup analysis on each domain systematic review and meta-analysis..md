Abstract
Background  Internalisation of stigma occurs when people with a stigmatised attribute, such as a mental illness, 
supress negative but accepted societal attitudes. However, as far as is known, there is no comprehensive picture of 
the prevalence of and factors associated with, internalised stigma among people living with mental illness in Africa. 
This systematic review and meta-analysis provide new knowledge by examining the evidence on the prevalence of 
internalised stigma and associated factors among people living with mental illness in Africa.

Methods  Using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and type of study (PICOT) approach, PubMed, 
Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched using a structured search 
comprising terms associated with mental health, mental illness, internalised stigma, and a list of all African countries. 
To evaluate paper quality, the Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Appraisal Checklist was used. Subgroup analysis with 
country and diagnosis was tested using a random-effect model, and bias was checked using a funnel plot and an 
inspection of Egger’s regression test. A p-value, OR and 95% CI was used to demonstrate an association.
Results  The pooled prevalence of internalised stigma was 29.05% (25.42,32.68: I2 = 59.0%, p ≤ 0.001). In the subgroup 
analysis by country, Ethiopia had the highest prevalence of internalised stigma at 31.80(27.76,35.84: I2 = 25.6%, 
p ≤ 0.208), followed by Egypt at 31.26(13.15,49.36: I2 = 81.6%, p ≤ 0.02), and Nigeria at 24.31(17.94,30.67: I2 = 62.8%, 
p ≤ 0.02). Based on domains of internalised stigma, pooled prevalence was stigma resistance: 37.07%, alienation: 
35.85%, experience of discrimination: 31.61%, social withdrawal: 30.81% and stereotype: 26.10%. Experiencing 
psychotic symptoms (1.42(0.45,2.38)), single marital status (2.78(1.49,4.06)), suicidal ideation (2.32(1.14,3.49)), drug 
nonadherence (1.5(-0.84,4.00)), poor social support (6.69(3.53,9.85)), being unemployed (2.68(1.71,3.65)), and being 
unable to read and write (3.56(2.26,4.85)) were identified as risk factors for internalised stigma.

Conclusions  Internalised stigma is common among people suffering from mental illnesses in Africa. This review 
determined that 29% of the sample population had elevated internalised stigma scores, and there were variations 
by country. People experiencing mental illness who have a single marital status, suicidal behaviours, poor social

Introduction
Mental illness affects one in six adults [1], and accounts 
for  11%  of  the  global  burden  of  disease  [2].  Mental  ill-
nesses are defined in this paper as serious psychiatric dis-
orders characterized by “a change in cognition, emotion, 
or  behaviour  that  are  associated  with  distress/or  poor 
performance” [3, 4]. Mental illnesses interfere with daily 
life,  including  education,  work  and  relationships,  and 
negatively affect the quality of life and wellbeing [5]. Peo-
ple with mental illnesses also face substantial challenges 
associated with these illnesses including negative societal 
beliefs regarding mental ill-health [6].

Stigma  towards  mental  illness  is  a  process  of  devalua-
tion and unfavourable stereotypes of individuals who are 
diagnosed with mental illness [7], and refers to negative 
attitudes or behaviors towards an individual on the basis 
of  their  condition  [8–11].  Globally,  people  with  mental 
illness  are  often  stigmatised  because  of  other  people’s 
(lack  of )  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  behaviours  towards 
them.  Importantly,  stigma  can  also  become  internal-
ized, whereby people with mental illness internalize such 
negative  social  attitudes  [12].  Stigma  can  have  signifi-
cant negative impacts on those living with mental illness, 
including  poverty,  victimization,  and  poorer  quality  of 
life [13, 14]. In terms of definitions of internalised stigma, 
the  internalised  stigma  of  mental  illness  scale  (ISMI)  is 
the  most  widely  used  measure  in  research  on  this  topic 
[15].  Measures  include  several  domains  that  help  define 
the scope of internalised stigma, including alienation, ste-
reotype  endorsement,  discriminatory  experience,  social 
withdrawal, and stigma resistance.

In  general,  studies  show  that  internalised  stigma  is 
linked  to  lower  quality  of  life  across  all  World  Health 
Organization  quality  of  life  dimensions  (physical,  psy-
chological,  environmental,  and  social)  (WHOQOL-
Brief ) [16–19]. Furthermore, higher levels of internalised 
stigma are associated with more severe psychiatric symp-
toms,  poor  adherence  to  treatment,  decreased  mental 
health  service  utilization  [20–25],  and  help  seeking  and 
recovery [26]. For example, worldwide, the World Health 
Organization has estimated that 75% of people with men-
tal  illness  do  not  seek  professional  help  [27]  and  inter-
nalised  stigma  is  one  of  the  most  significant  barriers  to 
people  with  mental  illnesses  in  receiving  timely  treat-
ment [28].

The  occurrence  of  internalised  stigma  in  people  with 
mental  illnesses  has  been  found  to  vary  by  geographic 
location  and  country.  For  example,  the  US  study  found 
the  prevalence  of  internalised  stigma  to  be  36%  [29],  in 

Ethiopia  the  prevalence  has  varied  between  28%  and 
84% [30], and in Nepal it is 54% [31–33]. Country varia-
tions have also been found in the domains of internalised 
stigma.  For  example,  a  Poland  study  indicated  that  the 
alienation  domain  had  a  high  score,  while  the  stereo-
type  endorsement  had  the  lowest  [34].  On  the  contrary, 
a study from Ethiopia found that alienation had the high-
est score [35], but a Japanese study indicated high stigma 
resistance and low stereotype endorsement [36]. In addi-
tion,  stigma  appears  to  vary  among  care  settings.  For 
example, 45% of participants receiving community-based 
care  in  India  reported  stigma,  compared  with  34%  of 
those receiving hospital-based care [37].

Stigma also appears to vary with diagnosis. For exam-
ple,  in  Ethiopia,  34%  of  participants  with  a  depressive 
disorder  reported  experiencing  internalised  stigma  [38], 
compared with 84–97% of those with schizophrenia [39, 
40]. Other factors have also been identified as associated 
with  internalised  stigma  including  being  single  [12,  41], 
having an illness greater than or equal to 2 years of dura-
tion [12], history of suicidal attempt [12], non-adherence 
to treatment [12, 32], poor social support, poor quality of 
life [12, 42–45], lower levels of self-esteem [14, 43], lower 
levels of social support and the lack of formal education 
[43, 45, 46].

The  differences  in  prevalence  and  associated  factors 
of stigma observed in different countries may stem from 
differences  in  methodological  approaches,  sample  sizes, 
sample  characteristics,  the  type  of  stigma,  attitudes  to 
mental  illness,  and  study  regions/settings.  This  review 
focused  on  both  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis, 
pooled  effect  estimates  of  different  associated  factors 
based  on  diagnosis  of  mental  disorder,  country,  and 
domains of stigma. The current review and meta-analysis 
answer the following questions:

1.  How common is internalised stigma among those 

who experience mental illness in Africa?

2.  What is the magnitude of internalised stigma by 

domains among people experience mental illness?

3.  What factors contributed to internalised stigma 

among those experience mental illness?

Methods
Protocol registration and publication

This  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  were  regis-
tered  on  the  International  Prospective  Register  of  Sys-
tematic  Reviews  (PROSPERO)  with  the  number  CRD 
42,022,287,525[47].  The  protocol  followed  the  Pre-
ferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and

Meta-Analysis  (PRISMA)  guidelines  for  methodological 
uniformity  of  the  review  process  [48].  The  Meta-analy-
sis  of  Observational  Studies  in  Epidemiology  guidelines 
were also followed [49].

Sources and data search strategy

To  design  the  search  strategy  for  this  systematic  review, 
the  PICOT  approach  (Eriksen  and  Frandsen,  2018)  was 
employed  as  follows  [50]:  The  P  (population  of  inter-
est)  was  made  up  of  people  experiencing  mental  illness 
in Africa. There was no intervention (I) required for this 
review, no comparison (C) or control groups. Finally, the 
internalised  stigma  of  mental  illness  scale  was  used  to 
measure the outcome (O) (ISMI) and all empirical stud-
ies  that  published  primary  data  pertinent  to  the  study 
topics were considered (T) by the type of study. We used 
electronic  and  manual  searches  to  identify  articles  for 
the  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis.  PubMed,  Sco-
pus,  MEDLINE,  PsycINFO,  CINAHL,  ScienceDirect, 
and  Google  Scholar  were  searched  to  access  data,  with 
the  databases  chosen  in  partnership  with  a  university 
research  librarian.  The  key  search  terms  were  ((Stigma 
OR prejud* OR discriminat* OR alienat* OR stereotyp*) 
OR AB (Stigma OR prejud* OR discriminat* OR alienat* 
OR stereotyp*) AND ((Mental N3 (Health OR illness OR 
disorder*)  OR  AB  ((Mental  N3  (Health  OR  illness  OR 
disorder*)). The search was conducted on 23/03/2022.

Inclusion  criteria  Only  correlational  studies  with  the 
same study design were included in the final analysis that 
is  cross-sectional,  reporting  the  prevalence  and  associ-
ated  factors  of  internalised  stigma  in  Africa  and  articles 
were included without restriction by year of publication, 
because there simply were no other designs found in our 
search. Participants in the study had to be living in Africa 
and  experiencing  a  mental  illness  –  diagnosable  condi-
tions  as  per  the  DSM  5.  Papers  had  to  be  published  in 
English and in a peer-reviewed journal no time restriction 
was done on publication year.

Exclusion  criteria  We  excluded  duplicates,  reviews, 
commentaries,  interventional  studies,  and  studies  not 
conducted in an African country. Grey literature was also 
excluded.

Study screening and selection

Initially,  research  papers  obtained  from  the  specified 
databases  were  imported  into  EndNote  X20  and  then 
transferred to Covidence. Duplicates were removed using 
Covidence.  Titles  and  abstracts  were  screened,  followed 
by full texts. In the case where studies were found in data-
bases  but  did  not  have  full  information,  further  details 
were sought from corresponding authors via email.

Quality assessment and risk of bias

The  methodological  quality  of  the  papers  was  assessed 
using  the  Joanna  Briggs  Institute  Critical  Appraisal 
checklist  [51].  The  quality  assessment  scores  were  con-
verted  to  percentages  to  provide  an  overall  score  (0–10: 
poor,11–20:  slight,21–40:  fair,41–60:  moderate,61–80: 
substantial,81–100: perfect). The JBI tool uses the follow-
ing criteria: Was the sample frame appropriate to address 
the  target  population?  Were  study  participants  sampled 
in  an  appropriate  way?  Was  the  sample  size  adequate? 
Were  the  study  subjects  and  the  setting  described  in 
detail?  Was  the  data  analysis  conducted  with  sufficient 
coverage  of  the  identified  sample?  Were  valid  methods 
used  for  the  identification  of  the  condition?  Was  the 
condition  measured  in  a  standard,  reliable  way  for  all 
participants?, Was there appropriate statistical analysis?, 
Was the response rate adequate, and if not, was the low 
response  rate  managed  appropriately?)  which  were  then 
included in the study [52].

Data extraction process

After  eligible  studies  were  identified,  a  Microsoft  Excel 
spreadsheet  with  a  prepared  format  was  used  for  data 
extraction.  Information  was  extracted  as  follows:  author 
name/s,  sample  size  and  response  rate,  year  of  publica-
tion, region of study, and participant characteristics.

Data analysis and publication bias

To explore prevalence of internalised stigma and stigma 
domains  within  the  included  studies,  we  calculated  the 
logarithm  of  prevalence  and  standard  error  of  loga-
rithm  of  prevalence.  Associated  factors,  variables’  odds 
ratios, the logarithm of odds ratio, and standard error of 
the  logarithms  of  odds  ratio  were  computed.  Data  were 
exported  to  Stata  for  analysis.  The  random  analysis-
effects model was used to show summary statistics, and 
heterogeneity  among  studies  was  examined  using  the  I2 
heterogeneity  test  and  Q  test  [53]. The  thresholds  for  I2 
heterogeneity of 25%, 50%, and 75% used to indicate low, 
moderate ,severe heterogeneity respectively [54, 55]. The 
assumption of the random effects model, an estimate of 
random variation across studies was applied. A subgroup 
analysis  and  meta-analysis  were  performed  considering 
the  type  of  mental  illness,  diagnosis  of  disorder,  study 
region,  and  country  of  the  study.  Small  study  bias  was 
examined  via  an  asymmetric  funnel  plot  and  objective 
inspection of Egger’s regression test [56]. Publication bias 
was  declared  if  the  funnel  plot  was  asymmetrical  or  if 
Egger’s regression assumption test result was statistically 
significant (p < 0.05) [57, 58]. The pooled estimate preva-
lence and the pooled effects odds ratio were presented at 
a  95%  confidence  level.  The  results  are  described  using 
narrative synthesis.

Results
Search outcomes  A PRISMA flow diagram was used to 
present the selection processes and reasons for exclusion 
of papers (Fig. 1).
Meta-analysis  of  Observational  Studies  in  Epidemiol-
ogy guidelines [49] and the PRISMA reporting checklist 
were applied in reporting the study findings [48]. A total 
of 40,431 articles were found in the systematic literature 
search.  of  the  available  total,  31,426  articles  were  dupli-
cates, and 8581 were assessed as irrelevant after screen-
ing the titles and abstracts, and they were excluded from 
the  analysis.  In  addition,  404  articles  were  ineligible 
for  reasons  including:  outcomes  not  being  mental  ill-
ness  stigma,  study  setting  out  of  Africa,  or  study  design 
not  meeting  the  eligibility  criteria  (for  example  inter-
ventional  and  qualitative  studies).  A  total  of  20  articles 
were assessed as  eligible and were included  for  analysis. 
Included articles were cross-sectional studies conducted 
in Africa (Table 1).

The quality of the articles was assessed by two review-
ers  (WGA&EMC)  with  the  Joanna  Briggs  Institute 
checklist.  Agreement  between  reviewers  was  reached 
from  moderate  to  perfect  agreement  (80–100%),  only, 

one  article  by  Victor  M,2016  et  al.  [69]  has  8/9  level  of 
agreement. Seventeen papers received quality assessment 
scores of 9/9 (Supplementary Table 1) and a further three 
scored 8/9.

The pooled prevalence of internalised stigma

Twenty  quantitative  studies  with  a  total  of  6265  partici-
pants from five different African countries were included 
for  final  analysis.  In  terms  of  country  of  residence  in 
Africa,  4365  individuals  resided  in  Ethiopia  ,1621  in 
Nigeria,  220  in  Egypt,  31  in  Ghana  and  30  in  Kenya. 
Across the studies, 2474 cases were diagnosed as general 
or unspecified mental illness, 2631 cases were diagnosed 
as  schizophrenia,  82  cases  were  diagnosed  as  psychosis, 
425  cases  were  diagnosed  as  depression,  418  cases  were 
diagnosed as bipolar disorders, and 235 cases were diag-
nosed as other mood disorders.

All the included studies used the “Internalized Stigma 
of  Mental  Illness  Inventory”  to  measure  stigma,  which 
derives  scores  ranging  from  0  to  4,  with  a  cut-off  point 
2.5. Across all studies, the mean internalised stigma score 
ranged  from  2.51  to  4.00  coined  as  having  internalised

stigma and the pooled prevalence of internalised stigma 
was 29.05% (25.42,32.68: I2 = 59.0%, p ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 2).

Subgroup analysis by diagnosis

In  the  sub-analysis  random-effects  model  for  specific 
mental  illness,  the  pooled  prevalence  for  diagnosis 
with  schizophrenia  was  25.08%  (17.97,32.18:  I2 = 69.4%, 
p ≤ 0.006),  diagnosis  with  mental  illnesses  were  30.78% 
(25.85,35.70:  I2 = 39.6%,  P ≤ 0.115),  and  diagnosis  with 
psychosis were 32.87% (19.12,46.62: I2 = 78.9%, p ≤ 0.009) 
and (Fig. 3).

Subgroup analysis by country

When analyzed by region, the highest prevalence of inter-
nalized stigma was found in Ethiopia, 31.80 (27.76,35.84: 
I2 = 25.6%, p ≤ 0.208); Egypt, 31.26(13.15,49.36: I2 = 81.6%, 
I2 = 62.8%, 
p ≤ 0.02);  and  Nigeria,  24.31(17.94,30.67: 
p ≤ 0.02). (Fig. 4).

Publication bias

There was no evidence of publication bias when the fun-
nel plot was examined (Fig. 5). An Egger’s regression test 
confirmed  heterogeneity,  chi-squared = 46.38  (d.f = 19), 
I2 = 59.0%,  Tau-squared(T2) = 39.78,  Test  of  ES = 0: 
z = 15.7.

Results based on domain of stigma  In terms of pooled 
prevalence  for  the  domains  of  stigma,  the  six  stud-
ies  that  measured  stigma  resistance  received  the  high-
est  score  of  37.07(17.92,56.23:  I2 = 98.2%,  p ≤ 0001), 
followed  by  nine  studies  examining  alienation  with  a 
score  of  35.85(26.16,45.54:  I2 = 94.6%,  p ≤ 0001).  Nine 
studies  examining  experience  of  discrimination  scored 
31.61(23.54,39.68: I2 = 92.7%, p ≤ 0.0001), nine studies mea-
suring social withdrawal had a score of 30.81(23.34,38.28: 
I2 = 91.5%,  p ≤ 0.0001)  and  nine  studies  examining  ste-
reotype  had  a  score  of  26.10(16.20,36.01:  I2 = 96.20%, 
p ≤ 0.0001) (Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 and Fig. 10).

Pooled  effect  estimates  of  Factors  We  examined  the 
socio demographic and other factors that predicted inter-
nalised stigma. The individual papers found the following: 
female  gender  [32],  rural  residence  [41],  single  relation-
ship  status  [12,  41],  unemployed  [43,  59,  61],  unable  to 
read and write [43, 45], low income [59], psychotic symp-
toms  [41,  45],  suicidal  behaviour  [12,  41],  greater  than 
two  years  since  diagnosis  [12],  drug  nonadherent  [12, 
32], presence of drug side effect/s [32]; previous hospital 
admission [43], longer duration of follow up [44], low self-
esteem [43], no family support [32], poor social support 
[12, 43–45], poor quality of life [12], and full insight into 
the condition [44] were significantly associated with inter-
nalised stigma.

Fig. 2  Forest plot of pooled prevalence of internalized stigma in Africa 2022 (n = 20)

The  pooled  analysis  for  these  factors  and  where  there 
were  two  or  more  papers,  the  following  outcomes  were 
found. Those who were single were 2.78(1.49,4.06), times 
more likely to report internalised stigma than those who 
were  married  [12,  41].  People  who  unemployed  were 
2.68(1.71,3.65)  more  likely  to  report  internalised  stigma 
than employed participants [43, 44]. There was a signifi-
cant  difference  between  educational  status  on  develop-
ing  internalised  stigma,  and  those  who  were  not  able  to 
read and write were 3.56(2.26,4.85) more likely to report 
internalised stigma than those who were able to read and 
write [43, 45]. See on (Fig. 11).

Pooled effect estimates examining psychotic symptoms 
found that there were no significant differences between 
patients  with  psychotic 
symptoms  1.42(0.45,2.38), 
than  patients  without  psychotic  symptoms  [12,  41]. 
Participants  with  a  history  of  suicidal  ideation  were 
2.32(1.14,3.49)  times  more  likely  to  report  internalised 
stigma when compared to participants who did not have 
suicidal symptoms [12, 41].

There was no significant relationship between patients 
with  drug  nonadherence  and  internalised  stigma  1.5(-
0.84,4.00) as demonstrated by the pooled effect estimate 
[12, 32].

There  was  an  increase  in  stigma  associated  with  poor 
social  support  in  the  pooled  analysis.  Participants  with 
poor  social  support  were  6.69(3.53,9.85)  times  more 
likely the report internalised stigma than people who did 
have good social support [12, 43–45].

Discussion
The major objective of this systematic review and meta-
analysis  was  to  determine  the  prevalence  and  pooled 
effect  estimates  of  internalised  stigma  among  people 
with  a  mental  illness  in  Africa.  Stigma  and  discrimina-
tion continue to be barriers to people in need of mental 
health services, obtaining help and fully recovery [23, 26]. 
Furthermore, there is limited synthesis of research exam-
ining  internalised  stigma  amongst  people  with  a  mental 
illness  in  low  and  middle-income  countries.  In  order  to 
fill  this  gap,  this  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis 
assessed  the  pooled  prevalence,  pooled  effect  esti-
mates and subgroup analysis on domains of internalised 
stigma among African people living with a mental illness. 
Results  presented  were  based  on  study  area  (country), 
type of mental illness, and associated factors.

In  the  current  study,  the  overall  pooled  prevalence 
of  internalised  stigma  was  found  to  be  29%.  This  is 

Alemu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:480  
Page 9 of 19

Fig. 3  Subgroup analysis on prevalence of internalised stigma of mental illness based on diagnosis 2022 (n = 20)

consistent  with  a  previous  meta-analysis  which  found 
31.3% stigma in patients with a severe mental illness [70]. 
However, these figures were higher than an analysis of 15 
different  countries  which  found  a  stigma  prevalence  of 
22.2% in patients with severe mental illnesses [71]. How-
ever,  as  stigma  is  pervasive  across  the  world,  a  previous 
review  found  the  prevalence  of  stigma  among  patients 
with mental illnesses to be 39.7% in South East Asia and 
39% in the Middle East [70]. Subgroup analysis based on 
country of study in the current review found that Ethio-
pia  had  the  highest  pooled  prevalence  of  at  31.80%  fol-
lowed  by  Egypt  which  had  a  prevalence  of  31.26%  and 
Nigeria  with  the  prevalence  of  24.31%.  Studies  about 
stigma of mental illnesses in African countries have been 
carried  out  in  a  limited  number  of  areas.  These  stud-
ies  have  reported  varying  and  high  internalised  stigma 
prevalence  including  Kenya  38%  [69],  Ghana  21%  [69], 
Ethiopia 47% [41], Nigeria 22% [44], and Egypt 23% [60] 
respectively. These differences in the magnitude of inter-
nalised stigma may be related to the level of awareness of 
mental illnesses among individuals with the problem, as 
well  as  variations  with  the  mental  health  workforce  and 
literacy related issues. For instance, the number of mental 
health professionals in Ethiopia is five times less than the 
number of health care professionals globally, indicative of 

fewer health care professionals among low-income coun-
tries [72, 73], for which Ethiopia is not exceptional. This 
may possibly mean that in these countries, patients may 
not  receive  adequate  level  of  education  to  increase  the 
awareness about their illness and may lead to the devel-
opment of self-stigmatisation.

One  of  the  most  significant  findings  from  this  meta-
analysis was the subgroup analysis based on domains of 
internalised  stigma,  this  analysis  provided  scores  as  fol-
lows: stigma resistance 37% (from six studies), alienation 
36%  (from  nine  studies),  experience  of  discrimination 
32% (from nine studies), social withdrawal 31% and ste-
reotype 26% (both from nine studies). These results agree 
with  the  findings  of  other  systematic  review  domains 
conducted  in  Europe,  North  America,  Australia,  and 
Asia,  in  which  scores  were  reported  as  follows:  Alien-
ation  shame  49%,  Stereotype  endorsement  27%,  dis-
crimination 35%, Stigma resistance 52% [74]. However, as 
this reporting was based on a single multi country study 
(Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia) and. There 
was  no  reporting  of  each  domain  of  internalised  stigma 
per  country,  more  research  on  this  topic  needs  to  be 
undertaken  to  show  the  magnitude  of  each  domain  and 
its contribution on stigma in different countries.

In terms of factors associated with internalised sigma, 
none  of  previous  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the 
sociodemographic  variables  had  consistent  significant 
relationship  with  internalised  stigma  [71].  In  contrast, 
the  findings  of  this  review  found  several  sociodemo-
graphic  factors  were  significantly  associated  with  inter-
nalised  stigma.  For  example,  having  a  single  marital 
status was 2.78 times more likely to be stigmatized than 
being married. We also found that those who were unem-
ployed  were  2.68  times  more  likely  to  report  develop-
ing  internalised  stigma  than  employed  participants. The 
lack of resources, poverty, and other economic obstacles 
associated with a lack of employment have been cited as 
stigmatising  factors  and  obstacles  to  mental  health  care 
in  African  countries  [75].  These  factors  have  also  been 
reported  to  contribute  to  internalised  stigma  regard-
ing mental illness [76]. We conclude that the differences 

between our study and the one by Dunn and colleagues 
above  [71],  may  relate  to  the  differences  in  the  number 
of articles included in the review and our focus of study 
which was studies conducted only in African countries.

The  current  study  also  found  that  there  was  a  signifi-
cant  difference  between  those  who  were  educated  and 
those who were not. Patients who developed internalised 
stigma  were  not  able  to  read  and  write,  and  their  likeli-
hood  of  developing  internalised  stigma  was  3.56  time 
more  than  someone  who  was  able  to  read  and  write. 
Education  has  been  linked  to  stigma  on  other  condi-
tions such as infectious diseases [77, 78]. Education may 
affect  stigma  through  a  lack  of  awareness  and  incorrect 
information  about  mental  illness,  contributing  to  inter-
nalised  stigma.  The  relationship  between  education  and 
stigma has been investigated, but causal correlations are 
multifactorial  and  notoriously  difficult  to  demonstrate, 

Alemu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:480  
Page 12 of 19

Fig. 7  Forest plot of pooled prevalence of experience of discrimination of internalised stigma in Africa 2022 (n = 9)

yet  higher  levels  of  education  have  been  linked  to  good 
mental  health  which  may  indicate  that  poor  knowledge 
negatively  contribute  to  mental  health  stigma  [79].  Fur-
ther  studies  have  shown  that  one  of  the  most  obvious 
predictors  of  good  outcomes  in  life,  including  employ-
ment,  wealth,  and  social  status  is  education,  and  as  a 
result, education has a high degree of predictive value for 
better health and wellbeing outcomes [80].

In  terms  of  conditions  and  condition  management, 
previous  systematic  reviews  have  found  that  schizo-
phrenia  was  associated  with  a  high  level  of  self-stigma, 
including  56%  from  studies  of  Europe,  North  America, 
Australia, and Asia [74]. However, in our finding the sub-
group  analysis  showed  that  the  results  of  pooled  preva-
lence  of  stigma  was  not  different  in  each  mental  illness, 
but  participants  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  had 
a  lower  prevalence  of  25%  compared  to  other  diagnoses 

such as psychosis that had an internalised stigma of 32% 
and  Mental  illness  as  diagnosis  internalised  stigma  of 
30%. This stands in contrast to data that indicates stigma 
is  most  severe  for  those  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophre-
nia.  In  this  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  stigma 
of  schizophrenia  was  25.08%  (17.97,32.18)  which  is  low 
when compared to previous research. In previous reviews 
there has been a strong relationship between stigma and 
having psychotic symptoms [71]. However, in this meta-
analysis  there  was  no  significant  association  between 
internalise  stigma  and  presence  of  psychotic  symptoms 
on people with mental illness.

To  date,  little  evidence  has  been  found  associat-
ing  suicidal  symptoms  and  internalised  stigma.  In  this 
meta-analysis,  studies  indicated  a  significant  positive 
correlation  between  suicidal  ideation  and  internalised 
stigma,  where  people  with  a  history  of  suicidal  ideation 

Alemu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:480  
Page 13 of 19

Fig. 8  Forest plot of pooled prevalence of alienation of internalised stigma in Africa 2022 (n = 9)

were  2.32  times  more  likely  to  develop  internalised 
stigma than those who did not [12, 41]. This is consistent 
with  research  around  other  stigmatised  conditions  such 
as  HIV-related  stigma,  and  links  with  suicidal  ideation 
[81, 82].

In the current review there was no difference between 
patients with drug adherence and non-adherence. These 
results  a  contradict  other  studies  which  have  demon-
strated  a  negative  correlation  between  drug  non-adher-
ence  and  internalised  stigma  [70,  71].  Additionally,  a 
study  using  the  meta-analysis  data  around  the  world, 

revealed a weak association between HIV related stigma 
and poor treatment adherence of [83].

In  terms  of  social  support,  this  meta-analysis  findings 
mirror  findings  from  previous  studies  that  have  exam-
ined  the  effect  of  social  support  on  internalised  stigma. 
In  the  pooled  estimate  there  was  an  increase  in  stigma 
associated  with  poor  social  support,  where  those  with 
poor social support were 6.69 times more likely of devel-
oping internalised stigma than people who did have good 
social support. This result is consistent with the research 
showing  a  relationship  between  HIV  stigma,  another

Page 14 of 19

stigmatising condition, and poor social support [81, 83]. 
Social  support  may  provide  greater  emotional  assis-
tance, decrease symptoms associated with mental illness 
[84]  and  improve  emotional  wellbeing,  which  is  crucial 
for  reducing  mental  distress  including  stigma  [85–88]. 
In  contrast,  poor  social  support  from  the  government 
or  family  and  friends  could  be  perceived  by  the  person 
as  discrimination  associated  with  their  illness  [88]  and 
may  lead  to  developing  internalised  stigma.  Qualitative 
research  has  likewise  indicated  that  those  with  mental 
illness  who  do  not  have  good  social  support  experience 
a  solitary  lifestyle,  loneliness  and  feel  stigma  related  to 
mental  health  more  severely  [89].  Isolation  and  mental 

health have been associated with internalised stigma and 
vice versa [90].

Overall,  our  findings  show  high  rates  of  internalised 
stigma,  and  variations  across  countries,  conditions, 
including  sociodemographic  and  other  factors.  It  has 
been  alluded  that  variations  in  cultural  views  on  stigma 
within  countries,  levels  of  poverty  and  access  to  men-
tal  health  services,  may  be  contributory  factors  to  these 
differences [91]. In some countries including Ethiopia, a 
mental  illness  may  not  be  regarded  as  a  life-threatening 
condition  [91,  92].  As  such,  policymakers  and  planners 
and  health  care  providers  may  not  prioritised  mental 
health care and treatment [93, 94]. The lack of awareness

Page 15 of 19

and  priority  setting  can  be  a  significant  determinant  of 
poor mental health outcomes for populations affected by 
these  conditions.  As  such  improving  health  care  access 
by government is an important area for future, including 
outreach  programs  and  mental  health  awareness-rais-
ing  activities  that  could  help  lessen  stigma  and  enhance 
social outcomes for those with severe mental illness [95] 
and  psychoeducational  interventions,  cognitive-behav-
ioural interventions, mainly aimed at modifying self-stig-
matising  beliefs;  interventions  focused  on  the  revelation 
of mental illness [96]. Moreover, building the capacity of 
policy  makers,  health  care  providers  and  strengthening 
the mental healthcare system and governance should be 
a priority in African countries such as Ethiopia and Egypt 

where  internalised  stigma  was  found  to  be  significantly 
high.

Strengths and limitations of the study

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed pooled 
prevalence  in  domains  of  stigma  and  examined  a  range 
of  factors  associated  with  internalised  stigma.  However, 
there  are  certain  limitations  considerations  to  be  aware 
of. First, there are limitations in the literature itself where 
some factors, such as quality of life of participants,  par-
ticipants’  sex,  residency,  duration  of  diagnosis,  previous 
hospital  admission,  patients’  self-esteem,  family  sup-
port,  the  presence  of  drug  side  effects,  longer  duration 
of  follow-up,  insight,  and  participants  income,  were  not

reported  in  adequate  number  to  run  meta-analysis  to 
see whether they had effect on stigma and considered as 
predictors of internalised stigma. Future research should 
consider  the  effects  of  these  influencing  factors  on  the 
prevalence  of  internalised  stigma,  which  could  then  be 
synthesised.  Second,  it  is  possible  that  some  research 
reporting  the  prevalence  of  stigma  were  overlooked  by 
our  search  approach  as  only  English-language  articles 
were included for analysis. Third, some diagnoses includ-
ing mood disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder were 
represented by a single study. As such, it was difficult to 
ascertain  the  difference  from  another  diagnosis.  Fourth, 
we  have  noted  the  issue  of  study  heterogeneity  in  the 
study limitations, factors found to be influencing stigma 
have been explored in several studies but for the pooled 
estimates  for  conditions  with  a  small  number  of  studies 
for pooled effect estimates are female gender, rural resi-
dence, greater than two years since diagnosis, having low 
income, presence of drug side effect/s, previous hospital 
admission, longer duration of follow up, low self-esteem, 
no  family  support,  poor  quality  of  life,  and  having  full 
insight  into  their  condition  are  represented  with  single 
studies.  In  addition,  most  of  the  included  papers  were 
from specific African countries, and only single studies in 
some  from  countries  despite  there  being  no  restrictions 

on the inclusion or language. Given the small number of 
papers we decided to go ahead with the analysis despite 
the heterogeneity levels, but that some of the results need 
to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, because all 
the  studies  included  in  this  review  were  cross-sectional, 
the outcome variable may have been influenced by con-
founding  variables.  The  current  findings  are  based  on 
bivariate cross-sectional data, and as such there are sig-
nificant  limitations  in  drawing  conclusions  about  the 
direction and causality of the association between stigma 
and associated factors from being drawn.

Conclusion
This  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  revealed  that 
almost  one  third  of  patients  with  mental  illness  experi-
ence  internalized  stigma.  Therefore,  we  can  conclude 
that  internalized  stigma  is  common  among  people  suf-
fering  from  mental  illness  in  Africa.  The  pooled  preva-
lence  rate  also  varies  among  domains  of  stigma,  stigma 
resistance,  alienation,  discrimination  experience,  social 
withdrawal,  and  stereotype  are  ranked  from  highest  to 
lowest in terms of internalised stigma. This indicates that 
a person centred approach should be advised for people 
living  with  a  mental  illness.  Several  risk  factors  relating 
to patients and mental illness are contributing for stigma. 

Alemu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:480  
As such, emphasis should be given for patients with sin-
gle marital status, having suicidal behaviour, poor social 
support,  unemployed  status,  and  unable  to  read  and 
write  as  factors  associated  with  a  pooled  effect  estimate 
of  internalised  stigma.  We  recommend  more  represen-
tative  samples  be  used  in  future  research  that  concen-
trates on a more precise diagnosis. Future meta-analysis 
that  focusses  on  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  stud-
ies address stigma and mental illness are also desperately 
needed.
