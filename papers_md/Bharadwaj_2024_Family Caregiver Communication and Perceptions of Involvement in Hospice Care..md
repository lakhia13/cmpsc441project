Abstract

Background: The burden of caregiving for family members is signiﬁcant and becomes particularly challenging
at end of life, with negative effects on mental health, including anxiety and depression. Research has shown
caregivers need better communication with their health care team.
Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between hospice team communication with caregivers and caregiver
involvement in care.
Methods: The purpose of this secondary analysis of data collected from a U.S.-based cluster crossover randomized
trial was to evaluate whether caregiver-centered communication (Caregiver-Centered Communication Ques-
tionnaire) is associated with a caregiver’s perceptions of involvement in care (Perceived Involved in Care Scale). A
block-wise approach was used to estimate linear models, which were created using total scores and subscale scores.
Results: Caregiver-centered communication was positively associated with perceptions of involvement in care.
Conclusion: Skilled communication between hospice clinicians and family caregivers is critical in helping
family members perception they are involved in the care of their loved one. There could be similar beneﬁt in
caregiver-centered communication during cancer treatment as well.

Introduction

The effects of cancer extend beyond the diagnosed

individual. Family members, including spouses or adult
children, are called on to assume the role of caregiving.
Mostly untrained, family caregivers (FCGs) not only assist
with activities of daily living, but also with cancer-speciﬁc
tasks, including pain management, medication administra-
tion, and determining escalation of care.1

Caregiver burden has been well documented. The demands
of caregiving often require caregivers to take leave or quit

their jobs, which can exacerbate the ﬁnancial stress associ-
ated with a cancer diagnosis. In addition, caregiving is as-
sociated with decreased healthy behaviors, such as physical
activity and nutrition, higher risk of heart disease, and in-
creased depression.2,3 The detriments to mental health are
particularly notable for women compared with men and when
caregivers have a low sense of preparedness for the role.4

Caregiving is especially challenging at end of life. Nearly
thirty percent of FCGs of hospice patients report moderate-to-
severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.5–7 As the disease
progresses, caregivers experience poorer psychological health

alongside a decrease in social networks.8,9 In fact, as the
patient nears death, FCG’s psychosocial burden can exceed
that of the dying patient.8 This burden diminishes the FCG’s
ability to provide quality care while increasing the FCG’s own
risk of mortality.10

A framework for caregiver-centered
communication with providers

Given the frail conditions of patients at end of life, family
often becomes the primary contact for the hospice team—
making decisions and handling the day-to-day care plans. For
this reason, unlike the traditional model of patient–provider
communication, caregiver-centered communication often ne-
cessitates a triadic model, involving the hospice team, patient,
and FCG. We have created a revised model of communication
that recognizes the role FCGs play in care management.

Our model for caregiving has been adapted from Epstein
and Street’s model for health communication within health
care teams11 and utilizes principles from Pearlin et al.’s Stress
Process Model.12,13 Social determinants of health, includ-
ing socioeconomic status, lay the background for caregiver
stressors that inﬂuence patient and family care needs. Com-
munication focused on addressing caregiver stressors has ﬁve
functions: fostering relationships to build trust, managing care,
information exchange, recognizing and responding to emotion,
and making decisions. The scientiﬁc premise of this study is
that by addressing these ﬁve communication areas, caregiver
outcomes can be improved, including their involvement in
care.14 Figure 1 illustrates the relationships.

Involvement in care

Patient involvement in care has been associated with im-
proved patient outcomes.15,16 In a survey of patients with
serious mental illnesses, researchers found that patient in-
volvement with care was positively associated with both
patient satisfaction and empowerment.15 In another study,
increased patient involvement was associated with higher
satisfaction with their physician and decreased decisional

conﬂict.16 These studies demonstrate that patient involve-
ment with care is valuable due to its positive association with
patient satisfaction. However, hospice patients are often un-
able to communicate, even with family, thus family must
represent their patients’ wishes and participate in decision
making. While we know that patient involvement is associ-
ated with higher satisfaction and decreased decisional con-
ﬂict, data are lacking for hospice patients or
family
members.15,16 According to Lerman et al., involvement in
care has three constructs: how the hospice team facilitates
caregiver involvement, how the caregiver shares information,
and how the caregiver participates in decision making.17

Despite the growth in hospice caregiving research, re-
search has often focused on caregiver burden as an outcome
rather than involvement in care. If research can identify how
to support caregiver involvement then perhaps burden can be
mediated by the involvement, replacing interactional suf-
fering with collaborative care. Understanding factors that can
increase caregivers’ involvement in care and their perception
of being ‘‘heard’’ and included in decision making is criti-
cal to informing clinical practice that improves the overall
satisfaction with the hospice experience.

Access for Cancer Caregivers to Education
and Support for Shared Decision-Making
intervention

Access for Cancer Caregivers to Education and Support for
Shared Decision-making (ACCESS) was a recently com-
pleted pragmatic crossover cluster randomized controlled
trial for caregivers of hospice patients with cancer. The
ACCESS intervention consisted of two components: (1) web
conferencing for care plan meetings to connect FCGs to the
hospice team, and (2) a professionally facilitated online pri-
vate Facebook group for FCGs. There were three arms,
control, online support (intervention), and online support plus
web conferencing (intervention) with participants randomly
assigned to these groups across seven hospice agencies
(clusters). While the details of recruitment and randomization
are reported elsewhere,14 hospice agencies were randomly

assigned to two of three different arms, crossing over twice
with a 90-day wash out in between. Caregivers consented to
participate and complete standardized measures at baseline
and every 2 weeks for 90 days. The study was approved by
the Washington University Institutional Review Board and
results are noted in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 02929108).

Study purpose and research question

Based on the literature emphasizing the positive effects of
involvement with care and the important role caregivers play
in care, we sought to evaluate whether caregiver-centered
communication is associated with a caregiver’s perceptions
of involvement in care. This article asks two research ques-
tions: (1) Is communication between the hospice team and
caregivers associated with the caregiver’s perception of in-
in care? and (2) which of the functions of
volvement
caregiver-centered communication are associated with the
perception of involvement in care? We hypothesized that the
more positive the caregiver’s perception of caregiver-
centered communication and its functions, the more involved
they would feel in their patient’s care.

Methods

Sample

The outcome and explanatory variables used in our hy-
pothesis testing come from the ﬁrst follow-up after baseline
(completed *14 days poststudy enrollment), which is the
ﬁrst time point in which measures for the explanatory vari-
able were available. We also chose the time point closest to
baseline to prevent possible distortion of the outcome by the
intervention. After removing cases without valid data on the
outcome,17 our effective sample size was n = 93.

Measures

Involvement in care is operationalized using the total score
on the Perceptions of Involvement in Care Scale (PICS). The
original study focused on shared decision making between
caregivers and hospice interdisciplinary teams. In that study,
the PICS subscales measured how the hospice team facili-
tated caregiver behavior and/or the ways caregivers partici-
pated in the care of the patient as well as how active they were
in the shared decision making of the team, both measures of
interest in that study. This instrument originally elicited ob-
served behaviors during interactions between 93 patients and
their physicians,17 and measures how involved in care care-
givers saw themselves. We modiﬁed the question wording to
reﬂect the involvement behaviors of caregivers, rather than
patient, and the hospice team, rather than the physician. Due
to measure modiﬁcation, we assessed reliability using
Cronbach’s alpha and tested the validity using a conﬁrmatory
factor analysis (CFA) with a congeneric factor structure (no
crossloading). Reliability was generally good for the overall
scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82) and the subscales. For the
subscales, Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.78 to 0.90.

For validity, the CFA showed acceptable ﬁt to the data after
allowing correlated measurement errors for ﬁve combinations
of items that were theoretically similar or had similar text,
RMSEA = 0.08, CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.92, SRMR = 0.076.18

The instrument is the sum of 13 items that measure the
behaviors demonstrating involvement in care using a 1–5

Likert-type scale with frequency anchors (1—Never and 5—
All the time). The total score has a range of 13–65. Higher
scores indicate higher involvement in the patient’s care.

interest

The primary explanatory variable of

is the
Caregiver-Centered Communication Questionnaire (CCCQ),
and its constructs represented in ﬁve subscales, which have
been tested previously for reliability and validity.19 The sub-
scales include exchange of information, fostering relationships
with the hospice team, recognizing and responding to emo-
tions, managing care, and decision making. This instrument
measures caregiver perceptions of communication inclusivity
with the hospice team, measured by a sum of 30 items on a 1–5
Likert-type scale with agreement anchors (1—strongly dis-
agree and 5—strongly agree). Higher scores indicate higher
perception of caregiver-centered communication. Guided by
our theoretical model, we also included several demographic
and contextual covariates throughout the modeling process,
including: study arm, age, and a proxy for days in hospice (date
of follow-up minus date of baseline, reﬂecting our goal of
enrolling participants as close to their hospice enrollment date
as possible; effectively referred to as days in study).

The CCCQ measures caregiver perceptions of how the
hospice team spoke with and included caregivers in discus-
sions about the patient, while the PICS measures how the
hospice team facilitated caregiver behavior and/or the ways
caregivers participated in the care of the patient. Table 1
compares the two instrument constructs and questions.

Data analysis

Before testing our hypothesis regarding the relationship
between CCCQ (how the team communicates) and PICS (how
the caregiver perceives involvement), we examined descrip-
tive statistics for all model variables. For continuous variables,
we examined distributions, and for categorical variables, we
examined frequencies. We used a block-wise approach to es-
timating our linear models. The ﬁrst model includes only the
explanatory variable of interest. The second model adds de-
mographic covariates. The third and ﬁnal model includes both
demographic covariates and context covariates. Following
estimation of models using the total score, we estimated
models using each subscale score as the predictor of interest to
determine which speciﬁc components of the CCCQ were as-
sociated with PICS. For model results, we examined the esti-
mates and signiﬁcance of the individual variables as well as the
quality of the overall ﬁt of the model to the data. For the
subscale models, we also compared R2 and Akaike informa-
tion criterion (AIC) to determine which subscale models were
the best ﬁt to the data. We considered p values of <0.05 as
evidence of a relationship between our explanatory variable
and/or covariates and outcome.

We used these estimates and their associated p values to
determine the results of our hypothesis tests as well as any
other practically signiﬁcant ﬁndings. We checked assump-
tions and diagnostics using a scatterplot for residuals and
ﬁtted values, a normal q–q plot, and a scale–location plot.
Case-wise deletion was used for missing data.

Relationship between caregiver-perceived
communication and involvement in the care

Table 3 summarizes the liner regression results for the
PICS and the CCCQ. The model results indicated that CCCQ
score was signiﬁcantly associated with PICS score after ad-
justing for demographic and contextual covariates (b = 0.311,
standard error [SE] = 0.046). The estimates suggest that, on
average, for every 10 points increase in CCCQ, the PICS
score increased by 3 points. This ﬁnding was present in the
results of all three models. Overall, the ﬁnal model demon-
strated a good ﬁt to the data (F = 4.075, p < 0.001) and ex-
plained 48% of the variation in PICS scores (R2 = 0.48).

Associations of the functions of caregiver
communication with caregiver involvement in care

Table 4 summarizes the regression models for the subscale
of the CCCQ with the PICS. For each function of communi-
cation, every CCCQ subscale was signiﬁcantly associated with
PICS score. For exchange of information, a 1-point increase is
increase in PICS (b = 1.803,
associated with a 1.8-point
SE = 0.271). For fostering relationships with the hospice team,
a 1-point increase is associated with a 0.86-point increase in
PICS (b = 0.860, SE = 0.149). For recognizing and responding
to emotions, a 1-point increase is associated with a 1.4-point
increase in PICS (b = 1.417, SE = 0.243). For managing care, a
1-point increase is associated with a 1.8-point increase in PICS
(b = 1.823, SE = 0.379). Finally, for decision making, a 1-point
increase is associated with a 1.2-point
increase in PICS
(b = 1.240, SE = 0.191). In examining the R2 values for the
models, exchange of information and decision making have
the highest values, 0.47 and 0.46, respectively, indicating they
explain a greater amount of variance in PICS than the other
three, and managing care has the lowest value (R2 = 0.35).

The AIC values also indicate that the exchange of infor-
mation (AIC = 585.828)
and decision-making models
(AIC = 587.375) have the best ﬁt to the data compared with
the other three models.

Discussion

This is the ﬁrst known study exploring the linkages between
caregiver-centered communication and caregivers’ perception
of involvement in care in hospice care. Caregiver communi-
cation alone is largely explanatory of caregiver involvement in
care. Although two functions of communication, exchange of
information and decision making were the strongest predictors
and managing care was the weakest predictor; all communi-
cation functions explained at least a moderate amount of
variation in the involvement of care.

The signiﬁcance of the exchange of information predictors
and decision making may be explained by the unique chal-
lenge of navigating cancer care. In a cross-sectional study of
hospice caregivers, including caregivers of both patients with

dementia and patients with cancer, Wittenberg et al. found that
cancer caregivers have a higher unrecognized need for infor-
mation compared with dementia caregivers.20 When presented
with a loved one’s cancer diagnosis, caregivers must often act
quickly to support treatment or symptom management. This
creates a challenge for rapid acquisition of information to fa-
cilitate decision making. However, the information needed to
make these decisions may be unclear to the caregiver.20
Therefore, clear information to guide cancer-related decision
making is valuable to caregivers, and active participation in
exchanging information and decision making with the hospice
team are central to caregivers’ perceptions of inclusion in care.
In contrast, managing care may have had a weaker con-
nection due to the higher importance placed on information
and related decision making. In other words, FCGs may feel
empowered to manage their loved ones’ care and navigate the
system. However, the true barrier to effectively managing
care may be seen as a lack of clear information to guide
communication with providers.

These data suggest that if providers recognize the critical
role of caregivers and address the key drivers of communi-
cation, then caregivers may be more likely to be involved in
care. This involvement should result in not only better patient
care but also more satisﬁed patients and caregivers. The re-
sults present an opportunity for oncology to improve cancer
care long before hospice.

Despite the strengths, the study does have limitations.
Although there were no signiﬁcant differences between study
arms regarding involvement in care, this was not the primary
research question, and thus data were collected after the
initiation of an intervention. Additionally, our sample is not a
large sample, but was enough to detect signiﬁcant results.
This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a
clinical trial; it is not known how different instruments and
the collection of primary data may have changed the results.
The model grounding this study assumes that health care
team communication drives caregiver involvement, however,
we recognize the potential bidirectionality of these con-
structs. This work was meant to be a ﬁrst step in establishing a
relationship between caregiver-centered communication and
involvement in care, and subsequent research should focus on
the causal direction of the relationship, however, this is be-
yond the scope of the current study. Additionally, our sample
(93), although large enough to detect signiﬁcant results, is
speciﬁc to hospice cancer patient caregivers, so may be
limited in generalizability.

Conclusion

In line with others, this research shows the important
role communication plays in end-of-life care.21,22 Quality

associations with caregiver outcomes, which now includes
perceived involvement in care.17 Despite an abundance of
research showing the value of skilled communication between
health care providers and patients, policy mandates such as
required communication training for professionals are still not

more than any cancer provider, and communication from the
beginning is key to their involvement.
