Abstract 
Background:  There is consistency of evidence on the link between school culture and student health. A positive 
school culture has been associated with positive child and youth development, effective risk prevention and health 
promotion efforts, with extensive evidence for the impact on student mental health. Interventions which focus on 
socio‑cultural elements of school life, and which involve students actively in the process, are increasingly understood 
to be important for student mental health promotion. This qualitative study was undertaken in three UK secondary 
schools prior to the implementation of a participative action research study bringing students and staff together to 
identify changes to school culture that might impact student mental health. The aim was to identify how school cul‑
ture is conceptualised by students, parents and staff in three UK secondary schools. A secondary aim was to explore 
which components of school culture were perceived to be most important for student mental health.

Methods:  Across three schools, 27 staff and seven parents participated in in‑depth interviews, and 28 students par‑
ticipated in four focus groups. The Framework Method of thematic analysis was applied.

Results:  Respondents identified elements of school culture that aligned into four dimensions; structure and context, 
organisational and academic, community, and safety and support. There was strong evidence of the interdependence 
of the four dimensions in shaping the culture of a school.

Conclusions:  School staff who seek to shape and improve school culture as a means of promoting student mental 
health may have better results if this interdependence is acknowledged, and improvements are addressed across all 
four dimensions.

Background
Schools  are  key  settings  for  health  promotion,  and  the 
concept  of  a  health  promoting  school  has  been  sup-
ported  globally  [1].  This  holistic  approach  involves  not 
only  health  education  via  the  curriculum  but  also  hav-
ing a school environment and ethos that is conducive to 
health and wellbeing, and by engaging with families and 
the wider community, recognising the importance of this

wider  environment  in  supporting  children  and  young 
people’s  health.  There  is  evidence  of  positive  effects  on 
physical  health  (including  weight,  physical  activity  and 
diet),  and  limited  evidence  for  the  impact  of  the  health 
promoting  school  approach  on  student  mental  health 
[2]. This matters; approximately half of adult mental dis-
orders  begin  during  adolescence  [3],  making  these  early 
years of life a key time at which to intervene to support 
good mental health, and to prevent or reduce later poor 
mental health outcomes.

capacity  for  resilience,  empathy,  and  communication 
skills  and  less  on  school-level  factors  [4–6].  A  system-
atic  review  of  school-based  stress,  anxiety  and  depres-
sion interventions in secondary schools found that while 
those  aimed  at  reducing  anxiety  and  depression  were 
often  successful,  effect-sizes  were  mediated  by  student 
demographics and dosage, and effects were not long last-
ing.  There  was  no  evidence  that  interventions  targeting 
stress  were  effective  [7].  The  limited  impact  of  discreet 
mental health interventions may be because they do not 
address aspects of the school context or system that are 
determinants of poor mental health, or prevent the inter-
vention  becoming  embedded  [8].  Interventions  which 
focus on socio-cultural elements of school life, and which 
involve  students  actively  in  the  process,  are  increas-
ingly understood to be important for student health and 
wellbeing  [9–12].  Mental  health  promotion,  defined  by 
the  World  Health  Organisation  as  actions  to  create  an 
environment  that  supports  mental  health  [13]  is  likely 
to be best achieved in schools that offer a continuum of 
interventions, including a focus on social and emotional 
learning,  and  the  active  involvement  of  students  [14, 
15]. Markham and Aveyard’s theory of health promoting 
schools  proposes  that  health  is  rooted  in  human  func-
tioning, which itself is dependent on essential capacities, 
the most important of which are practical reasoning and 
affiliation  (human  interactions  and  relationships)  [16]. 
These,  alongside  other  (less  essential)  capacities,  make 
autonomy  possible,  and  allow  individuals  to  maxim-
ise  their  health  potential. This  is  further  supported  by  a 
systematic review of theories of how the school environ-
ment  influences  health  which  concludes  that  for  young 
people to make healthy decisions, they must have auton-
omy,  be  able  to  reason,  and  form  relationships.  These 
capacities are better developed in schools where students 
are  engaged,  have  good  relationships  with  teachers,  and 
feel a sense of belonging and participation in the school 
community [17].

The school environment is often termed ‘school culture’ 
or ‘school climate’; both are used in education literature 
but  neither  are  well  defined  and  both  often  encompass 
many differing and nebulous aspects of the school ethos 
and  environment  [12,  18–21].  Some  authors  use  the 
terms interchangeably; conversely they are also described 
as  separate  but  overlapping  concepts  [22].  Van  Houtte 
and  Van  Maele  conclude  that  ‘climate’  is  the  broader  of 
the  two  constructs,  encompassing  infrastructure,  social 
composition,  physical  surroundings  and  culture  itself, 
while  ‘culture’  is  focused  on  the  shared  assumptions, 
beliefs, norms and values within the school [23]. Rudasill 
and colleagues propose a Systems View of School Climate 
(SVSC)  as  a  theoretical  framework  for  school  climate 
research,  itself  heavily  influenced  by  Ecological  Systems 

Theory [24, 25]. They define school climate as “composed 
of the affective and cognitive perceptions regarding social 
interactions, relationships, safety, values, and beliefs held 
by  students,  teachers,  administrators,  and  staff  within 
a  school.”  Wang  and  Degol  reviewed  the  existing  litera-
ture  and  consulted  with  expert  scholars  to  construct  a 
conceptualization  of  school  climate  that  includes  four 
dimensions:  academic  (teaching  and  learning,  leader-
ship,  professional  development);  community  (quality  of 
relationships,  connectedness,  respect  for  diversity,  part-
nerships);  safety  (social  and  emotional  safety,  physical 
safety,  discipline  and  order);  and  institutional  environ-
ment  (environmental  adequacy,  structural  organisation, 
availability  of  resources)  [21].  In  our  study,  we  use  the 
term  culture  rather  than  climate  deliberately;  in  a  UK 
context,  the  term  “culture”  is  far  more  commonly  asso-
ciated  with  school  environment  than  “climate”  [26].  We 
use “culture” to capture the broad sense of shared norms, 
values and relationships specific to each school, and also 
how student feelings of belonging, safety and support are 
impacted  by  the  infrastructure  and  social  composition 
of schools (considered by Van Houtte and Van Maele as 
part of the broader construct of ‘climate’ [23]).

A  positive  school  culture  has  been  associated  with 
positive child and youth development, effective risk pre-
vention and health promotion efforts, with extensive evi-
dence for the impact on student mental health [23]. Two 
evidence  reviews  report  strong  associations  between 
the  student  perceptions  of  the  quality  of  interpersonal 
relationships  within  the  school,  and  school  safety,  and 
student  mental  health  [18,  21].  School  culture  may  be 
particularly  important  to  the  mental  health  of  Lesbian, 
Gay,  Bisexual  and  Transgender  students  who  may  be 
more likely to perceive it less positively and be at greater 
risk of poor mental health, feeling unsafe, and absentee-
ism [27–30].

Given  the  evidence  base  highlighting  the  importance 
of  school  culture  and  active  participation  of  students 
in  school  life  on  mental  health  promotion  [9,  10,  31], 
we  developed  a  participatory  action  research  (PAR) 
approach  [32]  to  understanding  and  improving  school 
culture  in  UK  secondary  schools.  Participatory  Action 
Research seeks to enable action within a specific research 
context by involving study participants as co-researchers. 
Undertaken in three English secondary schools, our study 
involves bringing together a small group of students and 
school staff, facilitated by an external mental health prac-
titioner,  to  develop  a  shared  understanding  of  the  cul-
ture in their own school, and identify changes that might 
impact  student  mental  health.  Participants  consider 
school  culture  and  student  mental  health,  implement 
changes and/or interventions intended to improve both, 
and reflect on whether these changes have had an impact.

This  means  that  participants  are  involved  in  a  cycle  of 
data  collection,  reflection,  and  action  (Act-Observe-
Reflect-Plan  cycles;  [33].  Further  information  about  the 
PAR study is available elsewhere, including the study pro-
tocol [34] and the use of PAR as a research method [34, 
35]. At the launch of the PAR intervention, staff and stu-
dents were asked to reflect on their conceptualisation of 
school culture in order to develop a shared understand-
ing. Alongside this, the research team undertook qualita-
tive  research  in  each  of  the  intervention  schools.  Given 
the differences in the definition and conceptualisation of 
school  culture  identified  in  the  literature,  we  wanted  to 
better understand how it is conceptualised by those most 
closely  impacted  by  it.  The  aim  of  the  current  study  is 
to  identify  how school culture in conceptualised by stu-
dents,  parents  and  staff  in  three  UK  secondary  schools. 
A secondary aim is to explore which elements of school 
culture  are  perceived  to  be  most  important  to  student 
mental health.

Method
This was a qualitative study using semi-structured inter-
views  and  focus  groups  as  the  primary  data  collection 
method. We have followed the Consolidated Criteria for 
Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist [36].

Research team

The  study  research  team  comprised  academics  from 
public  health  centres  at  four  English  universities.  The 
development of data collection tools was led by PJ; data 
collection was led by PJ, LS, and EGT; all of the research 
team were involved in analysis and reporting.

Sampling and recruitment

We  used  a  purposeful  sampling  approach  to  select 
schools  with  variability  in  school  performance  (using 
Ofsted inspection outcomes as a proxy measure for this), 
and  diversity  of  student  intake  across  ethnicity,  and  eli-
gibility  for  free  school  meals.  Three  secondary  schools 
were  recruited  in  October  2020,  one  of  which  agreed 
to  run  two  PAR  intervention  groups.  A  lead  staff  con-
tact  in  each  of  the  schools  supported  the  recruitment 
of  school  staff,  parents,  and  students  to  take  part  in  an 
interview (adults) or focus group (students), prior to the 
PAR  groups  beginning.  We  worked  with  this  contact  to 
identify school staff with insight into school culture and 
student  mental  health  and  wellbeing.  Participants  were 
drawn from the senior management team, teaching staff, 
other  support  staff,  particularly  those  with  responsibil-
ity for student wellbeing (e.g. pastoral support staff, Per-
sonal,  Social,  Health  and  Economic  education  (PSHE) 
lead,  head  of  year,  form  tutor).  For  parent  participants, 
we  asked  for  parents  with  particular  insight  into  the 

school, for example parent governors, parent volunteers, 
or those whose children had required extra pastoral sup-
port or similar. Potential interviewees were sent a Partici-
pant Information Sheet (PIS) that detailed the objectives 
of the study, interview length and summary of topics cov-
ered,  recording  arrangements,  confidentiality,  and  data 
protection  details,  and  use  of  data  for  reporting.  Par-
ticipation  in  interviews  was  voluntary.  A  consent  form 
was sent to participants by email in advance of an online 
interview and consent recorded at the start.

In each participating school, all students in the selected 
year  group  were  invited  to  take  part  in  the  PAR  group. 
School  staff  shared  an  information  sheet  about  the  PAR 
group and encouraged students who wanted to take part 
to  contact  school  staff  and  also  send  a  short  paragraph 
detailing  why  they  wanted  to  take  part  and  what  skills 
and  attributes  they  would  bring  to  the  group.  School 
staff  selected  students  with  guidance  and  support  from 
the  research  team  (prioritising  diversity  across  gender 
and  ethnicity  and  those  students  who  were  not  already 
involved in any student councils or similar in the school). 
Students  who  had  volunteered  to  take  part  in  the  PAR 
intervention,  but  not  selected,  were  asked  if  they  would 
participate in the focus group. An information sheet was 
sent to both students and their carers and consent sought 
from  both  to  participate  (in  one  school,  parents  were 
informed  but  consent  not  sought  as  students  were  aged 
16  years  or  over).  Signed  consent  forms  were  collected 
prior  to  the  focus  group  and  the  researchers  reaffirmed 
that consent was informed and voluntarily given verbally 
at the start of the focus group.

Data collection

Semi-structured  interviews  support  a  structured  and 
flowing  interview  whilst  allowing  some  flexibility  to 
ensure  the  respondent  can  engage  with  the  subject, 
maintaining  more  autonomy  in  how  they  choose  to 
respond  to  the  topic  areas  in  comparison  to  a  more 
structured  survey  method 
(Adams  2015).  Topic 
guides  for  the  interviews  were  developed  following  a 
rapid  review  of  the  research  literature  on  school  cul-
ture  to  develop  a  comprehensive  list  of  components 
that  may  impact  on  student  mental  health,  as  well  as 
potential  mechanisms  through  which  this  may  hap-
pen  (see  Additional  file  1:  Appendix  1).  Interviews 
lasted 30–45 min and guides were used flexibly, using 
prompts  and  probes  where  appropriate.  A  similar 
approach was used to develop the topic guide for stu-
dent focus groups, which included participatory meth-
ods  to  facilitate  a  discussion  about  school  culture. 
Focus groups lasted around 45 min.

Data  collection  took  place  between  December  2020 
and  April  2021,  coinciding  with  school  mitigation

measures  in  place  in  response  to  the  COVID19  pan-
demic.  These  included  social  distancing,  face  masks, 
and  year  group  ‘bubbles’.  Although  schools  were  open 
to  all  students  when  data  collection  began,  they  were 
closed  to  all  but  vulnerable  students  and  those  with 
key worker parents from the beginning of January until 
March 2021. As a result, all data collection with school 
staff  and  parents  took  place  online.  Student  focus 
groups  occurred  after  schools  re-opened  were  a  mix-
ture  of  face  to  face  (3  groups),  and  online  (1  groups) 
depending on what the school allowed.

Analysis

All  data  collection  activity  was  recorded  using  an 
encrypted  digital  recorder  and  transcribed  verbatim. 
We  used  the  Framework  Method  of  thematic  analysis 
[37,  38].  One  of  the  researchers  (PJ)  developed  a  the-
matic  framework  after  reading  several  transcripts  to 
familiarise  herself  with  the  data  and  referring  to  the 
research questions and topic guide to inform an initial 
coding  stage.  This  framework  was  augmented  by  sub-
themes  that  emerged  in  further  transcripts.  A  short 
summary of each subtheme was developed to describe 
the  data  that  it  was  designed  to  capture.  This  initial 
framework  was  shared  with  the  whole  research  team 
and  the  thematic  framework  was  further  refined  until 
the  team  were  confident  that  it  encompassed  all  the 
data in the transcripts, the data within each subtheme 
was  coherent,  and  that  there  were  clear  distinctions 
between  subthemes.  The  final  thematic  framework 
is  included  in  Additional  file  2:  Appendix  2.  PJ  then 
developed  a  matrix  framework,  using  the  subthemes 
as  column  headings  and  participant  transcripts  as 
rows.  The  matrix  cells  were  populated  with  verbatim 
and  summarised  data  from  the  transcripts,  as  well  as 
analytical  notes  made  by  the  researchers  (‘charting’). 
Charting  reliability  was  tested  by  all  six  researchers 
charting  the  same  two  transcripts  independently,  and 
comparing the contents of each cell to ensure that we 
were  applying  the  subthemes  consistently  and  captur-
ing  and  summarising  the  data  consistently  across  all 
team  members.  This  data  management  approach  pro-
duced a data matrix showing data from every respond-
ent  under  each  subtheme,  thus  providing  a  detailed 
and accessible overview of the qualitative dataset. The 
Framework  Method  makes  possible  the  capacity  to 
explore  the  dataset  through  themes  and  subthemes, 
and  also  by  respondent  type.  A  summary  of  the  data 
under  each  subtheme  was  developed  to  inform  the 
next  stage  of  the  analysis,  moving  up  the  analytical 
hierarchy to explore patterns and associations between 
themes in the data [38, 39].

Results
Sample

Information about the sample schools and participants is 
shown in Table 1.

Across  all  three  schools,  27  school  staff  participated 
in an interview for the study. Staff interviewed included 
members  of  the  senior  leadership  teams,  teaching  staff, 
learning  and  support  assistants,  pastoral  support  staff, 
and staff with particular responsibility for the Year group 
which was taking part in PAR in each school. The parent 
sample was comprised of seven parents of students in the 
relevant year groups across the three schools (five moth-
ers, two fathers).

Four student focus groups were held in total; one from 
each  of  the  year  groups  participating  in  PAR  across  the 
three schools. Twenty-eight students took part across the 
four groups; student demographics and online/in school 
data collection method are outlined in Table 2.

The  findings  are  presented  under  four  overarching 
dimensions of school culture that emerged from the data 
and were perceived by respondents to impact on student 
mental  health.  These  are  structure  and  context,  organi-
sational  and  academic,  community,  and  safety  and  sup-
port  (see  Fig.  1).  Anonymised  quotations  are  included 
from a wide range of participants in order to illustrate the 
responses rather than indicate representativeness. Where 
differences  between  participant  groups  were  apparent 
(e.g. parents, school staff and students) we highlight these 
in the findings.

Dimension 1. Structure and context
Local environment and geography

School  staff  noted  the  impact  of  geographical  loca-
tion  on  school  culture,  with  pupils  often  not  living  in 
the  immediate  locality.  This  resulted  in  students  liv-
ing  socially  deprived  areas  attending  a  school  in  an 
affluent  area,  and  vice  versa.  As  a  result  any  sense  of

a school sited within a ‘neighbourhood’ or ‘local com-
munity’  setting  was  depleted.  However  the  impact  of 
the  wider  locality  was  recognised.  Public  events  and 
demonstrations  that  had  occurred  in  the  South-West 
of England in the 12 months preceding the study gen-
erated  publicity  and  awareness  amongst  the  students 
at  all  three  schools,  which  staff  tried  to  reflect  and 
respond to.

“So,  being  in  a  city  centre,  if  there’s  a  protest,  it’s 
on  our  doorstep.  So,  the  student  strikes,  on  our 
doorstep,  Greta  Thunberg,  when  she  came,  on 
our  doorstep,  Black  Lives  Matter  protests,  on  our 
doorstep…[]…So, all these issues, our students are 
even  more  exposed  to,  and,  you  know,  in  shap-
ing  our  culture  at  school,  that’s  what  we’ve  tried 
to move towards. Not just focussing on inclusivity 
and  care,  but  also  in  terms  of  they’re  going  to  be 
engaged and informed citizens.” School B staff 8

Student diversity

Almost all respondents referred to the three schools as 
having a very ethnically diverse student body, bringing 
both opportunities and challenges. Ethnic diversity was 
perceived by most respondents as one of the key influ-
ences over school culture. Parents often spoke of valu-
ing  it  as  a  learning  opportunity  for  their  children,  and 
a source of high cultural capital. Many staff shared this 
view and enjoyed working with such a diverse cohort.

“The cultural mix at [School A] was really impor-
tant  for  me...So  culturally,  I  think  the  diversity  in 
[School A] is amazing and although it brings with 
it  many  challenges,  that  was  a  really  important 
thing for me. That my children could see the strug-
gles.  I  think  it  is  more  of  a  reflection  of  society…
modern  society,  multicultural  society.”  School  A 
parent 1

Many  staff  noted  however  that  while  students  may 
integrate  during  school  hours,  they  often  fell  back  into 
homogenous groups at the end of the school day, reflect-
ing the reality of the wider community.

cubicles, but does mean we are restricted on indoor 
space - not many places where kids can just sit and 
relax  in  social  time…So,  I  think  that  that’s  some-
thing they do struggle with.” School C staff

“This  is  a  diverse  school,  and  the  city  is  sometimes 
perceived to be a diverse melting pot but it is not, it 
is  still  very  segregated.  There  is  a  lot  of  work  to  be 
done between communities.” School C staff 5

There  was  also  diversity  across  the  socio-economic 
status  of  students.  Staff  reflected  on  the  severe  poverty 
faced  by  many  of  their  students,  exacerbated  during  the 
COVID19  pandemic,  and  the  efforts  made  to  ensure 
that  students  were  able  to  access  the  same  educational 
and  wider  opportunities  as  more  affluent  students.  Staff 
also  reported  examples  of  where  ethnicity  and  socio-
economic  status  intersect,  impacting  the  engagement  of 
students and their families with the school.

“For  some  BAME  families,  education  is  the  highest 
priority. For others who are possibly asylum seekers 
or who have not really had an education themselves 
because of issues back home in their own countries, 
education  is  much  further  down  the  list.  You’ve  got 
other  families,  massive  poverty  in  the  families,  and 
so education is the last thing they can think about.” 
School C staff 4

Finally  staff  also  noted  the  influence  of  students  with 
SEND on school culture. Two schools in particular were 
perceived  to  have  a  high  proportion  of  students  with 
SEND,  and  staff  adapted  the  curriculum  and  employed 
additional support staff to ensure the school environment 
and  offer  was  inclusive.  This  included  working  with  all 
students to promote greater awareness and acceptance of 
disability.

Physical environment

Many  staff  spoke  about  the  impact  of  the  physical  envi-
ronment  of  the  school  on  student  interactions  and 
wellbeing,  and  in  particular  the  impact  of  being  quite 
constrained in a small space. Although efforts were made 
to  create  private  and  safe  spaces  during  break  times, 
often  both  the  number  of  people,  and  building  and 
grounds design made it difficult for students to find quiet 
or  perceived  safer  places  to  be.  This  finding  emerged  in 
all schools, despite one being an older, traditional build-
ing  and  two  being  more  recently  rebuilt  to  incorporate 
more light and space.

“Students do struggle with the building sometimes - 
a big long tin, built around previous ideas of super-
vision. So offices are glass, toilets are open, they are 
non-gendered  toilets  which  are  open  aside  from 

Students’  capacity  to  navigate  school  buildings  was 
further  constrained  during  the  pandemic  by  social  dis-
tancing  measures.  Students  were  often  confined  to  one 
classroom all day while teachers moved round the school, 
one-way systems were put in place, and dining areas and 
school  grounds  segregated  by  year  group  to  limit  social 
mixing. Staff perceived this impacted on the school cul-
ture,  making  small  incidents  amongst  students  more 
likely to escalate, and removing teachers’ sense of control 
in classrooms that no longer felt like their own.

“All of a sudden they’re crammed, 30 students, into 
[one]  classroom  [all  day]  and  I  think  that’s  had  a 
negative  influence  on  a  lot  of  students….[]…  As  a 
result  small  things  escalate  fairly  quickly,  which 
isn’t  helping  the  dynamic  within  the  school.  …[]… 
Before,  every  time  I  ever  had  a  class,  I  would  be  at 
the door. I would welcome them into my room, and 
there’s  an  automatic  element  of  control  and  influ-
ence where, if there is something, you can address it 
before  you  come  into  the  room  and  the  room  is  the 
area  of  control.  There  isn’t  that  available  anymore, 
and I thought that that does have an impact.” School

Dimension 2. Organisational and academic
Leadership and management of school culture

The role of the school senior leadership team in shaping 
school  culture  was  mediated  through  their  support  for 
staff,  visibility  and  transparency  to  students,  and  active 
management of school culture. School staff reported that 
having a leadership team that listened to and empowered 
staff  was  important.  This  was  especially  important  dur-
ing the pandemic and related mitigation measures result-
ing in schools being closed to most pupils and a move to 
online  learning,  although  for  some  staff  this  made  the 
leadership  teams  less  visible.  Visibility  to  students  was 
also  seen  as  key  to  promoting  a  welcoming  culture  in 
schools;  availability  and  presence  during  the  school  day 
was frequently mentioned by both staff and students.

“The  senior  leadership  team  are  very  visible  to  stu-
dents.  They’re  out  every  single  lunch  and  break, 
every lesson changeover, they’re very hands-on, and I 
would say that’s probably, I think that’s quite a good 
sign.” School A staff respondent 3

The  importance  of  senior  staff  being  present  and 
welcoming  students  to  school  each  morning  was  also 

Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619 

Page 7 of 18

perceived by student focus group participants as a reason 
for valuing their school.

Culture emerged as a key priority amongst the leader-
ship team in all three schools, which all take a proactive 
stance on leading and shaping it, including having senior 
leaders  responsible  for  it.  Stated  reasons  for  prioritising 
culture included to reflect the needs of a diverse student 
intake  (particularly  across  ethnicity  and  socioeconomic 
status); mitigate the impact of Covid mitigation measures 
on student wellbeing; and in response to the UK national 
government’s push for better mental health provision in 
schools. There was also a sense that newer staff, and staff 
recently promoted to managerial posts, were more likely 
to prioritise culture (and student wellbeing).

“I  am  aware  of  how  important  [mental  health  in 
schools]  is  at  the  moment  from  the  government.” 
School A Parent 1
“It can be alienating, but they [new leadership team] 
spoke a lot about culture - something that people say 
is important, and in general staff are happy…[]...he 
[Principal]  he  would  start  using  these  quotes  from 
people, and one of the ones that always sticks in my 
head  is  ‘culture  eats  strategy  for  breakfast’,  is  one 
he  loved  which,  again,  is  on  culture.”  School  C  staff 
respondent 9

Despite the active management of school culture, there 
were staff in all schools who questioned whether a narra-
tive of prioritising school culture was tokenistic, without 
implementing real changes or having noticeable impact.

Staff composition

School  staff  composition  was  perceived  to  influence  the 
culture  of  the  school,  and  mental  health  of  students, 
through dedicated pastoral and inclusion roles, their eth-
nic  and  gender  diversity  (or  lack  of ),  and  staff  turnover 
rates.

All  three  schools  had  non-teaching  staff  with  roles 
dedicated to supporting student mental health and well-
being,  including  safeguarding  (promoting  child  welfare 
and  protection  from  harm),  pastoral  support,  mental 
health  support  (counsellors),  and  support  and  inclusion 
for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities 
(SEND).  Staff  and  parents  from  two  schools  perceived 
the wellbeing teams as unusually large compared to other 
secondary schools. These staff were especially busy mon-
itoring  and  supporting  students  during  school  closures. 
The  importance  of  staff  dedicated  to  mental  health  and 
wider  wellbeing  support  was  recognized  by  all  stake-
holder groups, including parents.

drop in and they can just go and sit down and say, 
“I’m  having  a  rubbish  day  today.”  Sometimes  that’s 
what  you  need.  You  don’t  always  need  someone  to 
come  up  with  an  answer.  You  just  sometimes  need 
somebody to listen.” School B Parent 1

Beyond  dedicated  non-teaching  staff,  many  school 
respondents  recognised  the  role  that  staff  diversity  had 
in shaping and informing school culture. Respondents in 
all schools were conscious that school staff did not reflect 
the  ethnic  diversity  of  students.  Gender  representation 
across teaching subjects and leadership roles was also of 
concern.  There  was  recognition  amongst  school  teach-
ing  staff  and  leadership  teams  that  students  need  to  see 
ethnic  minority  and  female  role  models  in  all  roles,  and 
effort  is  needed  to  address  this  through  better  recruit-
ment practice.

“It’s  the  best  leadership  team  I’ve  ever  worked  in 
[but]  If  we’re  talking  about  representation  in  there, 
I  am  the  only  non-white  person  in  our  leadership 
team...[]…  It’s  only  really  in  our  pastoral  teams 
where  we  start  to  see  some  diversity.  That’s  a  real 
problem  in  schools  that  I’ve  always  found,  is  that 
any kind of black or ethnic minority staff tend to be 
in  the  pastoral  teams  rather  than  in  the  teaching 
and learning teams.” School C staff 5

Parent respondents highlighted staff turnover and con-
sistency  as  important.  When  staff  consistency  was  low, 
this  had  a  negative  impact  on  students’  wellbeing  and 
school  culture  as  they  struggled  to  build  relationships 
with ever-changing staff. This was particularly important 
to students who needed additional pastoral and/or inclu-
sion support for SEND or mental health reasons, and also 
impacted on parents’ ability to build trust and confidence 
with their child’s key staff contacts in school.

Staff development and training

Few respondents mentioned staff development and train-
ing  as  an  important  aspect  of  school  culture,  although 
some school staff did raise training in specific areas that 
would influence their capacity to support student mental 
health  and  wider  wellbeing  (including  on  safeguarding, 
mental health promotion and prevention, inclusion, and 
support  for  students  with  SEND).  Some  reported  train-
ing  in  new  behaviour  management  policies  specifically 
intended  to  impact  school  culture,  including  restorative 
justice and holistic approaches. In one school effort had 
been  made  to  train  staff  in  anti-discriminatory  practice, 
to  give  them  greater  confidence  in  addressing  diversity-
related issues and supporting students.

“The  fact  that  she  [pastoral  support  lead]  doesn’t 
teach any of them and that they know they can just 

“We need to make sure that, on every bit of our cul-
ture that we want to work on, we have staff that are 

 Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619 

Page 8 of 18

educated in that. I know we’ve done a lot of work on 
this year’s staff feeling scared to broach certain sub-
jects,  especially  with  our  anti-discriminative  prac-
tice… They’re worried about saying the wrong thing 
and being accused of being a racist, or being accused 
of  being  a  homophobe,  or  being  accused  of  saying 
something. There’s  a  real  fear  of  that,  which  I  think 
leads  to  disengagement,  potentially,  from  trying  to 
be an active participant in the change [to school cul-
ture].” School C staff 5.

Curriculum

Respondents  across  all  schools  described  ongoing 
changes  towards  a  more  inclusive,  holistic  curriculum, 
reflective  of  the  diverse  student  body.  The  most  promi-
nent  changes  to  emerge  from  interviews  were  efforts  to 
decolonialise  the  curriculum  across  all  taught  subjects, 
the  inclusion  of  more  content  about  Black  history,  and 
inclusive  and  diverse  content  with  regard  to  gender  and 
sexuality. In one school, changes to the curriculum were 
informed  by  feedback  from  student  Black  and  Minority 
Ethnicity (BAME) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender 
(LGBTQ +)  groups.  Staff  respondents  noted  the  impor-
tance of embedding minority role models across all sub-
ject areas, and not simply providing one-off lessons about 
minority  groups.  The  lack  of  diversity  amongst  staff 
increased the difficulties of delivering a diverse and inclu-
sive curriculum as many reported lacking expert insight, 
knowledge  and  confidence.  There  was  consensus  how-
ever that continuing to work on the curriculum offer was 
likely to facilitate a more supportive school culture.

“So,  we’re  working  at  the  moment  unit  of  work  by 
unit of work by just inputting BAME and female role 
models and careers. So, that it’s not a tokenistic les-
son, it’s actually… it just becomes part of the normal 
conversation at [School C], and no matter what eth-
nic group a pupil is from or what their sexuality is, 
there  should  be,  within  the  curriculum  somewhere, 
role models popping up…, it becomes part of the day 
to day conversation.” School C staff 2

PSHE  education  was  highly  valued  by  both  staff  and 
students  as  an  important  means  of  addressing  diversity, 
inclusion,  and  health.  PSHE  time  was  used  to  deliver 
universal  mental  health  provision  including  education, 
advice,  and  interventions  such  as  meditation  or  mind-
fulness.  Students  reported  that  alongside  Relationships 
and Sex Education (RSE), this helped them to develop an 
understanding of different cultures and to be mindful and 
respectful of them.

“I  think  RSE,  PSHE  are  good  because  they  teach 
about other people’s cultures and I think it is impor-

tant  since  that-  say  if  you  don’t  know  something 
about  another  person’s  culture  you  might  offend 
them.” School C student focus group

For  some  students,  the  opportunity  to  discuss  mental 
health during PHSE was welcomed but could feel token-
istic,  without  enough  time  to  cover  issues  in  depth,  and 
some stigma around discussing mental health remained.

“We had a PSHE assembly quite recently and this is 
going back to the whole ’surface level’ thing, because 
even though the assembly itself was good, it was, like, 
all the students [in year 12] in one Zoom. So, it was 
very  difficult  for  us  to  have  actual,  proper,  discus-
sions. So, it felt quite, "See, we need to have a PSHE 
lesson at some point, therefore we’ll have one big, fat 
assembly, so we can tick that off our quota," instead 
of having smaller groups where people can actually 
discuss  their  problems  and  really  learn.”  School  B 
student focus group

Staff, parents and students all discussed the importance 
of  non-academic  subjects  such  as  Physical  Education 
(PE), Music, Dance and Art, and the ability for students 
to  access  these  formally  through  lessons  and  through 
lunchtime  and  after-school  clubs.  The  noted  benefits  of 
these  include  providing  an  opportunity  for  self-expres-
sion and creativity, a focus on processes rather than out-
comes  (an  important  part  of  mental  health),  and  ‘safe’ 
spaces  to  take  risks  and  use  failures  as  opportunities. 
Staff  perceived  that  having  a  wider  range  of  music,  arts 
and  sports  on  offer  to  students  allowed  them  an  oppor-
tunity  to  find  something  they  enjoy  and  may  excel  in, 
which may be particularly important for the self-esteem 
of less academically able students. Respondents across all 
schools  noted  that  although  schools  make  efforts,  there 
was  still  not  enough  emphasis  on  these  wider  curricu-
lum  areas,  and  this  was  exacerbated  by  the  curtailment 
of after-school and extra-curriculum activities during the 
pandemic.

Teaching and learning

Most respondents’ comments on teaching styles focused 
on  teachers’  attitudes  to  discipline  in  the  classroom. 
Where teachers were perceived as overly strict, students 
and  parents  worried  that  this  had  a  detrimental  effect 
on  student  mental  health.  Some  students  and  parents 
perceived that teachers’ focus on academic performance 
meant they were more likely to overlook student anxiety 
and stress.

“For  some  reason  I  think  [daughter]  overthinks 
things maybe and she second guesses everything she 
does…[]… They’d set the essay and then she’d spend 
another  week  researching  which  she  didn’t  need  to 

Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619 

Page 9 of 18

do. Then she’d start writing the essay by which time 
other  work  was  coming  in,  so  it  got  on  top  of  her….
[]…She  was  scared  of  failing.  She  was  scared  of  let-
ting them down.” School B Parent 1

The  COVID-19  pandemic  may  have  alleviated  this 
problem  and  encouraged  teaching  staff  to  afford  greater 
consideration  of  student  mental  health.  Staff  were 
aware  that  not  all  students  coped  well  with  the  closure 
of schools and move to online teaching and learning for 
extended periods of time alongside the other stressors of 
the pandemic.

Respondents  of  all  types  were  aware  of  the  impact  of 
high  academic  expectations  on  school  culture  and  con-
sequently,  student  mental  health.  In  school  B,  which  is 
known  for  high  academic  standards,  staff  reported  high 
levels  of  anxiety  and  stress-related  disorders  amongst 
students,  including  eating  disorders  and  self-harming 
behaviour.  School  staff  acknowledged  that  expectations 
of high achievement can cause students stress and anxi-
ety,  but  addressing  this  is  challenging  because  it  is  not 
always driven by the school culture but by parents or the 
students themselves.

“I’ve  spent  a  lot  of  time  on  the  phone  with  parents, 
and  sometimes  their  kids  are  having  a  really  tough 
time  and  they  are  ditching  the  distance  learning 
thing. I’m just like, “You know what? Your kid needs 
to  feel  better  and  then  we’ll  look  at  the  learning 
again.” School C staff 3

Academic performance

Pressure on schools to be ‘high performing’ was driven both 
by external regulators and national performance measures 
(Office  for  Standards  in  Education,  Children’s  Services 
and  Skills  (Ofsted);  Progress  8  scores  (progress  a  pupil 
makes  from  the  end  of  primary  school  to  the  end  of  sec-
ondary  school),  and  school  staff’s  ambition  to  equip  indi-
vidual  students  with  the  skills  and  qualifications  for  later 
life.  Respondents  also  noted  the  impact  of  schools’  local 
and  historical  context;  comparisons  with  other  schools  in 
the  area  (e.g.  higher  performing  schools  more  attractive 
to prospective students and parents) and prior status (e.g. 
as  a  grammar  school,  private  school  or  under-performing 
school) also influenced how the schools’ current academic 
performance was perceived by parents and staff. All of this 
influenced how ‘high performance’ was conceptualised. In 
one school, staff and parents describe the school as highly 
academic  with  an  expectation  that  most  students  would 
achieve high academic grades and proceed to higher educa-
tion. In contrast, staff from a school with lower academic 
outcomes  noted  that  they  are  driven  to  maintain  year  on 
year  improvements  in  Progress  8  scores,  (a  ‘value  added’ 
measure)  and  equip  students  for  a  wider  range  of  next 
steps, including further education, and vocational routes.

“It is a very high-end sixth form. So you are working 
with  a  lot  of  young  people  that  want  to  be  doctors, 
vets, quite high-end.” School B staff 4
“We were one of the only schools of our kind, really, 
to see a… I think it for six years, an improvement in 
our  progress  8  scores,  which  I  know  are  not  every-
thing, but actually are quite a good measure for us. 
We’re  an  academy  that  is  massively  based  around 
progress, and equal progress.” School C staff 2

“There  is  a  big,  big  drive  for  students  to  apply  to 
Oxford  or  medicine  degrees,  dentistry,  and  in  my 
experience  this  has  caused  some  significant  men-
tal  health  issues  in  the  students.  It’s  not  neces-
sarily  a  school  issue,  I  would  say  it’s  more  due  to 
the  demographics  of  the  students  that  attend  the 
school.  They  tend  to  come  from  very  supportive 
families, often families that actually want the stu-
dents to attend Oxford or want the students to be 
doctors...  So  there  is  still  this  sort  of  competition 
with their peers and maybe the frustration of not 
meeting expectations that come from the parents.” 
School B staff 6

Dimension 3: Community
Quality of relationships in school

The  quality  of  interactions  and  relationships  with  oth-
ers  in  school  was  perceived  as  another  key  element  of 
school culture important to student mental health. Staff 
respondents  distinguished  between  ‘staff ’  and  ‘student’ 
culture,  though  also  recognized  that  the  relationships 
between  staff  and  students  would  impact  on  the  school 
culture  overall.  Relationships  amongst  staff  were  gener-
ally  described  as  friendly,  supportive  and  collaborative. 
This  was  especially  important  during  the  past  months 
when  school  closures  necessitated  the  move  to  online 
teaching, with repercussions for students through better 
practice, and better support.

“It’s  really  noticeable  that  no  matter  what  depart-
ment  you’re  in,  what  level  of  teaching,  if  you’ve  got 
your head around something that other departments 
or individuals haven’t, people have voluntarily made 
tutorial videos and just sent them to all staff, it’s not 
that you have to go knocking and asking all the time, 
actually  people  are  just  pulling  together  and  trying 
to promote best practice.” School C staff 2

There  was  some  disagreement  over  the  role  of  the 
senior  leadership  team  in  reinforcing  positive  staff  cul-
ture.  Some  respondents  described  working  with  an 

 Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619 

Page 10 of 18

empowering  leadership  team  that  actively  supported 
good staff relationships. For others, leadership influence 
over high workloads, pressure to maintain high academic 
performance, pandemic-related changes and recent staff-
ing  decisions  (including  redundancies)  had  damaged 
relationships amongst staff. There was also some stigma 
around  disclosing  mental  health  concerns,  particularly 
those caused or exacerbated by work pressures, although 
this may be improving.

“Lots  of  people  are  worried  about  the  consequences 
[of disclosing] and they’re worried about having the 
label  of  someone  who  cannot  cope,  there’s  a  lot  of 
that.” School B staff 6

The  quality  of  interactions  between  students  and  staff 
were  perceived  as  highly  influential  over  how  students 
experienced  school  culture,  and  to  their  mental  health. 
There  was  recognition  amongst  school  staff  that  while 
those in pastoral or other support roles would prioritise 
maintaining  good  relationships  with  students,  teaching 
staff  may  differ  in  their  perception  of  their  role;  some 
would focus on teaching and learning only, while others 
would  see  the  creation  of  positive  and  trusting  relation-
ships  with  students  as  important  and  conducive  to  bet-
ter  learning  and  healthy  development.  Other  influences 
on the quality of relationships between staff and students 
included pressure on staff and students to maintain high 
academic standards. Staff willingness to be accessible and 
approachable  to  students  was  also  important,  and  this 
had been adversely been affected by school closures and 
subsequent social distancing measures in place in school.

“Relationships  between  student  and  staff  are  really 
important,  because  if  you  don’t  really  have  a  good 
relationship with your teacher, you may feel uncom-
fortable with asking them for help. It can cause a lot 
of stress if you’re beginning to struggle and you don’t 
get any help.” School B student focus group

Inclusion  and  diversity-related  factors  were  key;  staff 
from  schools  with  a  more  ethnically  diverse  student 
intake  reported  that  the  lack  of  diversity  amongst  staff 
damaged  relationships  with  students  from  minority 
groups. There was also concern that Black and Minority 
Ethnicity  students  were  over-represented  in  disciplinary 
statistics, possibly a result of unconscious bias or preju-
dice from staff.

“In our school, when almost all staff are White and 
then you’ve got an over-representation of Black stu-
dents in our behaviour data, race becomes an issue. 
Not  just  for  the  students,  but  for  parents  as  well. 
That  is  something  we’re  continually  trying  to  over-
come and work on.” School A staff 1

Friendships  with  peers  and  the  quality  of  interactions 
between students in school were also recognized as hav-
ing an important influence on school culture and student 
mental health by all stakeholders. Respondents across all 
schools generally described peer relationships as positive, 
though  there  was  recognition  that  individual  students 
would have different experiences.

“If you have good relationships with other students, 
then  your  mental  health  will  just,  overall,  feel  bet-
ter.  You’ll  have  someone  to  talk  to,  someone  to  rely 
on  and  you’ll  just,  overall,  have  a  better  experience 
at school.” School B student FG

Diversity, particularly ethnic diversity, was seen as very 
influential  over  peer  relationships  by  staff  and  parent 
respondents. As noted earlier, it is valued as a key attrib-
ute of a school and there is an expectation amongst staff 
and parents that students will benefit from relationships 
with peers from different backgrounds. They also report 
that peer support is strong amongst minority groups, and 
students  with  SEND  and  minority  ethnic  groups  look-
ing  out  for  and  supporting  each  other.  However,  where 
problems arise in student relations this is generally attrib-
uted  to  differences  across  ethnicity,  age,  gender  or  dis-
ability  (with  SEND  students  at  particular  disadvantage). 
Respondents  describe  concerns  with  discrimination 
amongst peers in all three schools, which can manifest in 
a  lack  of  integration  during  social  and  break  times,  and 
bullying.

Inclusion

Efforts to promote inclusion were apparent in all schools, 
as  this  was  perceived  to  be  another  key  influence  on 
school  culture  and  student  mental  health.  Across  all 
schools,  respondents  describe  a  diverse  student  intake 
with  regard  to  ethnicity,  socio-economic  status,  geogra-
phy,  and  religion.  This  was  highly  valued;  forming  peer 
relationships across these divides is seen as an opportu-
nity for students to learn from each other and encourage 
acceptance and valuing difference. Staff from all schools 
reported  an  emphasis  on  inclusive  practices,  driven  by 
both  the  need  to  ensure  that  all  students  felt  safe  and 
welcomed  in  school,  and  by  recent  Black  Lives  matters 
protests that have highlighted awareness of prejudice and 
discrimination amongst students.

School  staff  were  conscious  that  for  many  students, 
time  in  such  a  diverse  environment  was  limited,  and 
hence the opportunity to gain the most advantage should 
be optimised.

“We don’t want people to tolerate each other…[]…We 
want to teach you to celebrate, actually, differences, 
and learn from each other and be able to have high 

Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619

cultural capital, based on you’ve got this experience 
to come to this environment every day where you’re 
mixing  with  so  many  different  people  that  maybe, 
once you leave school, you’re not going to be able to 
access.” School A staff 5

Staff  were  keen  to  emphasise  the  activities  under-
taken  promote  inclusion,  such  as  running  groups  for 
under-represented  or  minority  students,  (e.g.  BAME 
and  LGBTQ + students),  increased  pastoral  support  for 
minority  groups,  events/displays  to  celebrate  diversity 
and  difference;  ‘stamping  down’  on  issues  of  intolerance 
and  bullying,  and  the  provision  of  unisex  toilets.  There 
was  some  recognition  of  the  intersectionality  of  race, 
gender and sexuality.

“Quite often, we find that if you belong to a BAME 
community, talking about or being open about your 
sexuality  can  sometimes  be  a  big  no-no…[]…We’ve 
got a lot of children, students from the BAME com-
munity  that  aren’t  out,  but  actually  want  to  go  to 
the LGBTQ club group to learn and talk and debate 
and  discuss  and  learn  more  about  themselves.  So, 
you know, making sure they do that in a safe place.” 
School C staff 4

School  staff  perceived  some  improvements  were  still 
to  be  made,  including  increasing  the  ethnic  diversity  of 
staff,  and  addressing  potential  staff  bias  that  may  result 
in  BAME  groups  being  over-represented  in  disciplinary 
actions. Staff also report increasing incidences of misogy-
nistic  language  and  bullying  amongst  students,  and  this 
may be the next inclusion issue to be targeted. Students 
recognise the work that schools are doing around inclu-
sion  and  value  it,  although  agree  that  there  is  still  some 
progress to be made.

“The  school  discourse  is  specifically-  I  feel  like  the 
school used to be a very majority white school and it 
is slowly integrating and becoming a more culturally 
diverse school. So, I think the school, in itself, is still 
learning  how  to  make  different  cultural  identities 
more  heard,  more  safe,  more  whatever,  but  I  think 
the  school  definitely  has  a  lot  more  to  learn  and  to 
do.” School B student FG

Student voice

Student  voice  and  empowerment  mechanisms  and  the 
success of these varied across the schools and again, were 
impacted  by  the  pandemic  mitigation  measures.  There 
was  consensus  amongst  school  staff  that  the  degree  to 
which students felt listened to was a key aspect of school 
culture  which  would  impact  on  student-staff  relation-
ships and student mental health. All schools had systems 

in  place  for  consultation  with  and  engagement  of  stu-
dents (for example student councils). Staff also reported 
using  surveys  as  a  regular  means  of  monitoring  stu-
dent  health  and  wellbeing  and  gaining  feedback  on  spe-
cific  issues.  There  were  examples  of  student-led  groups, 
for  example  BAME  or  gender  equality  groups,  being 
involved  in  changes  to  the  curriculum  or  school  rules 
that which particularly affected these groups.

School  staff  varied  in  their  perception  of  effectiveness 
of  these  mechanisms,  with  some  reporting  that  school 
leadership  teams  were  responsive  to  student  feedback 
and  willing  to  reflect  student  views.  Student  councils 
and  surveys  had  been  disrupted  during  school  closures, 
although  respondents  across  all  schools  reported  that 
changes  had  been  made  to  practice  (for  example,  how 
online  learning  was  delivered),  as  a  result  of  student 
feedback. This was a minority view however; the major-
ity  of  respondents  perceived  that  student  views  were 
often  ignored  and  had  little  tangible  impact  on  the  how 
the school was run. Some attributed this to a lack of staff 
resource  devoted  to  facilitating  and  supporting  student 
engagement; conversely other staff report that too much 
engagement work is staff-led, rather than student-led.

The overwhelming perception of students and parents 
is  that  school  leadership  teams  are  unwilling  to  engage 
with and reflect student views.

“My  personal  experience  of  school  councils  is  that 
they  are  a  bit  of  a-  we  all  have  a  school  council 
because  we  know  it’s  the  only  thing  to  do  but  actu-
ally  when  it  comes  to  decision  making  they  kind  of 
ignore  it  or  they’ll  steer  the  kids  in  a  direction  they 
want to go.” School A parent 1
’I feel like they try to say that they do a lot [around 
student  voice],  especially  with  student  leaders  and 
stuff, but a lot of the ideas and rules that we might 
want  to  change  get  shut  down  real  quick.’  School  A 
student FG

Parent engagement

Parental  engagement  was  perceived  as  good  across  all 
three schools. Mechanisms included parent forums, par-
ent  teacher  association  (PTA),  email  newsletters  and 
social media groups. School staff also liaised with parents 
of students over specific issues (typically about academic, 
behavioural,  health  or  SEND  support).  The  degree  of 
communication  and  engagement  with  parents  increased 
during  the  pandemic,  as  staff  conducted  additional  and 
regular  welfare  checks  while  most  students  were  not 
attending school in person.

There  was  recognition  that  some  parents  were  more 
willing  and  easier  to  engage  with  than  others;  factors 
influencing  this  include  parents’  motivation  for  their 

 Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619

child’s academic success, concern about student support 
needs,  and  ‘second  generation’  students  whose  parents 
also attended the school. The relationship with some par-
ents could be challenging for school staff, either because 
parents  are  reluctant  to  engage,  may  blame  school  staff 
for their child’s behavioural issues or be critical over the 
perceived  lack  of  support  for  their  child.  Engagement 
was also perceived to vary across socio-demographic sta-
tus  and  ethnicity.  Some  staff  reported  that  higher  earn-
ing families may have greater expectations of their child’s 
academic  success  and  will  seek  out  opportunities  to 
engage  with  school  staff  to  facilitate  this.  In  one  school, 
concerns  about  problematic  disengagement  of  parents 
from  one  particular  community  was  addressed  by  the 
employment of a family support worker to liaise between 
families and schools to help overcome language and cul-
tural barriers.

Most  parents  were  pleased  with  the  level  of  engage-
ment they had with school staff, particularly where their 
child  had  additional  needs  or  existing  mental  health 
issues.  They  report  feeling  listened  to  by  school  staff, 
who  were  quick  to  respond  to  issues  and  make  neces-
sary  changes,  making  parents  feel  like  they  are  working 
together with staff in the child’s best interests.

“I feel they always know who I am, they know, when I 
talk about my children they seem to know everything 
that  I’m  talking  about,  and  they’re  always  quick  to 
respond. They actually take you seriously - they sort 
of  think:  “Well  you’re  the  parent,  you  must  know 
your child so tell us what we can do to help.” And I 
just find that really helpful.” School A parent 3

Students  were  aware  of  parental  communication, 
especially  where  this  was  concerned  with  behaviour  or 
achievement.  Many  appreciated  school  staff  contacting 
their  parents  with  positive  feedback  about  them.  Stu-
dents  were  clear  about  the  links  between  positive  feed-
back  from  the  school,  their  parents,  and  their  mental 
health.

“Keeping in touch with parents is really important - 
I  would  say  keeping  in  touch  with  parents  as  when 
they  tell  your  parents  that  you’ve  been  excellent  it 
raises your self-esteem and makes you feel like your 
parents are proud of you which makes you feel proud 
of yourself.” School C student focus group

Dimension 4: Safety and support
Pastoral support

As  previously  noted,  schools  all  had  designated  staff  for 
student wellbeing and pastoral support.

Most  staff  were  confident  that  students  would  know 
who  to  approach,  usually  a  tutor  or  a  member  of  the 

pastoral  support  team.  Pastoral  staff  report  being  espe-
cially  busy  during  school  closures,  conducting  regular 
welfare  checks  on  all  students,  and  providing  additional 
support  for  those  in  need.  The  pandemic  mitigation 
measures  made  providing  pastoral  support  harder,  by 
limiting in-person contact while schools were closed, and 
use of face masks making communication harder.

“It’s  been  harder  this  year  because  of  closures  and 
mask  wearing  -  there’s  still  a  swathe  of  other  [stu-
dents] that don’t have a connection. You only need a 
strong connection with one staff member to feel like 
you’re supported, valued and have someone that you 
can go to.” School B staff 8

Parents  were  universal  in  their  praise  for  the  pasto-
ral  support  provided  to  their  children,  with  staff  seen 
as  skilled  and  responsive  to  both  student  and  parental 
needs.  Students’  views  were  more  mixed,  with  concerns 
about  anonymity,  embarrassment  about  raising  mental 
health issues in school, unwillingness to approach pasto-
ral  staff  where  they  were  also  teaching  staff,  and  having 
better support systems in peer groups or at home.

“There are pretty much only one or two people that I 
would tell private stuff to, and it definitely isn’t any 
of the teachers.” School A Student focus group

Primary prevention

Most  school  staff  describe  two  main  mechanisms  for 
mental  health  promotion;  speaking  often  about  the 
importance of good mental health, and ensuring students 
in  need  of  support  know  who  to  approach  for  help  and 
guidance  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  Mental  health  is 
addressed  during  assemblies,  as  part  of  the  PHSE  cur-
riculum.  and  in  tutor  time.  School  staff  also  used  these 
opportunities  to  communicate  support  available  to  stu-
dents both within the school from external agencies (via 
face  to  face,  telephone  or  online).  Teaching  staff  also 
have  a  role  in  promoting  good  mental  health  by  having 
an  accessible  ‘open  door’  policy  for  students,  and  being 
aware  of,  and  not  putting  further  pressure  on,  students 
with known mental health issues. Schools also frequently 
used  noticeboards,  websites  and  student  newsletters  to 
communicate about mental health.

“We  do  things  like  toilet  door  campaigns  in  our 
school. The inside of toilet doors are just covered in 
different  posters  and  stuff  like  that.  They’re  unisex 
open-plan  toilets.  So,  we’re  targeting  everyone  with 
everything”. School C staff 4

Respondents often commented on the stigma attached 
to  mental  health  difficulties,  and  like  staff,  students 
may be reluctant to talk about them in school. This was 

Jessiman et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:619 

Page 13 of 18

perceived  as  particularly  true  for  students  from  some 
ethnic  minority  communities.  Staff  believed  that  talk-
ing  often  about  the  important  of  mental  health  would 
encourage  students  to  ask  for  support  if  they  needed 
it.  Some  staff  report  that  as  mental  health  awareness 
increased, students were becoming more likely to report 
issues about themselves, or for other students.

“In terms of preventative support, I want to say the 
kids really have each other’s back. I would say they 
really do. There have been lots of cases in the past of 
friends of students coming to me or going to [Name] 
or  [Name]  to  say,  “So  and  so  is  having  a  panic 
attack,” or, “So and so is having a tough time.” School 
B staff 6

All  schools  had  processes  in  place  to  monitor  student 
mental  health  though  the  degree  to  which  this  was  for-
mally structured varied. One had a range of pre-emptive 
measures  in  place  including  regular  face-to-face  moni-
toring  by  safeguarding  leads  or  tutors,  and  monitoring 
through proxy measures such as attendance and engage-
ment. School staff also mentioned the importance of staff 
communication  to  spot  and  support  students  needing 
support. Student feedback on this was mixed; not all stu-
dents agreed that it is the role of teaching staff to monitor 
student mental health.

levels  of  mental  health  support.  Students  in  all  schools 
were aware of these support systems.

“Someone  that  has  issues  with  mental  health  or 
wellbeing,  they  go  to  their  mentor  and  that  would 
be passed on. Or they could go to the mental health/
SEN support teachers for their issues”. School A focus 
group.

There  were  some  inequalities  in  which  students  are 
more  likely  to  request,  or  be  offered,  targeted  support. 
Staff  respondents  perceived  that  BAME  groups  are 
under-represented  amongst  students  who  access  coun-
selling,  while  white,  middle-class  students  may  be  more 
likely  to  come  forward  and  ask  for  help  with  stress  or 
anxiety. There may also be differences in school support 
provided  that  are  dependent  on  how  the  mental  health 
issue  manifests;  one  parent  noted  that  her  child  may  be 
more  likely  to  receive  support  because  she  is  ‘likeable 
and  polite’  and  hence  perceived  by  school  staff  as  more 
deserving  of  support  than  students  with  mental  health 
needs  that  manifest  themselves  in  more  challenging 
behaviours.

School staff also reported signposting or referring stu-
dents for support from external agencies though waiting 
lists were often long and may have worsened during the 
pandemic.

“I don’t think it’s the teacher’s job to look after peo-
ple’s mental health. I think their job is just to teach.” 
School A student focus group
“There’s a survey asking you how well do you feel out 
of  one  to  ten,  do  you  need  to  talk  to  someone,  how 
is it going, and all these questions….[]…I think that’s 
pretty good because then you can just answer it, even 
though it says your name, no one else is going to see 
it except the teacher which is fine because they’re the 
ones who help you.” School C focus group

Targeted support

Targeted  mental  health  support  was  mainly  comprised 
of  access  to  a  school  counsellor  or  a  mentor.  School 
respondents  often  said  they  would  have  more  targeted 
support  available  but  this  was  unaffordable.  Staff  from 
two schools also mentioned targeted group interventions 
for  anger  management,  stress  and  anxiety,  body  image, 
and  understanding  emotions.  Again  it  was  stated  than 
this would be useful for all students as health promotion 
activities,  but  the  resources  were  not  available.  Other 
barriers to accessing targeted support included pressure 
on curriculum time; staff reported difficulty in removing 
a child from a taught class to take part in a mental health 
intervention.  Learning  support  assistants  (LSA)  for  stu-
dents  with  SEND  were  also  perceived  to  provide  high 

“Because of funding cuts and things, to actually get 
referred  to  CAMHS  [Child  and  Adolescent  Men-
tal  Health  Services]I  think  you  have  to  meet  a  very 
high  threshold  of  maybe  being  a  harm  to  yourself 
or  others  before  you  get  referred.  Where,  earlier  in 
my  teaching  career,  it  was  much  easier  to  get  sup-
port from CAMHS and intervention outside. I think 
some  of  it  now  is  just  that  schools  are  dealing  with 
so  many  mental  health  issues  as  teachers  and  staff 
that,  maybe  at  other  times,  might  have  been  dis-
sipated  to  other  organisations  and  things  like  that. 
I  guess  that’s  been  exacerbated  in  COVID  maybe.” 
School B Staff 1

Parents  mostly  reported  satisfaction  with  the  level  of 
support put in place by schools for their children, many 
of  whom  had  required  targeted  mental  health  support. 
For  some,  there  was  a  preference  to  manage  mental 
health support within the school where possible to ben-
efit from existing trusted relationships, even if this meant 
some delay.

“I  did  ask  for  him  to  be  referred  [to  the  counsellor], 
but  what  was  interesting  is  there’s  a  very,  very  long 
list of people. …[]… I’ll see how long it takes, because 
I will seek it in a different way, privately, if necessary. 
But I think again there’s a sense of safety. I think [Son]

does  trust  the  school,  I’m  not  saying  he  likes  all  the 
teachers or anything, because he doesn’t, but he trusts 
the school. So, I figured if it came through the school, 
it’s joined up; he would feel safer.” School C parent 1

Safeguarding

Safeguarding was prioritised by staff, but did not emerge 
as  a  prominent  element  of  school  culture.  All  schools 
had  designated  safeguarding  leads  and  protocols  in 
place. There  were  some  differences  between  school  staff 
and  students  in  the  understanding  around  safeguarding 
protocols.  Some  believed  that  students  understood  the 
importance of safeguarding, and if disclosures (of risk or 
harm) are made, then staff had a duty of care to act upon 
them.  However  this  had  the  potential  to  damage  trust 
and limit how much students were willing to share with 
school staff.

“The  school  counsellors  have  a  reputation  of  saying 
it’s  confidential  but  then  still  telling  your  parents 
and stuff.”

“Some people just want to talk to the teacher with-
out having any consequences, and they’re not in any 
danger, but then they feel like their information will 
be [shared].” School A student focus group

Bullying

For  many  school  staff,  issues  with  bullying  were  closely 
linked  with  diversity  and  inclusion.  Misogyny,  and  prej-
udice  against  students  with  SEND  were  perceived  to 
be  the  more  pressing  underlying  causes  of  bullying.  As 
such,  many  anti-bullying  initiatives  in  schools  were  also 
inclusion  initiatives,  such  as  support  groups  for  minor-
ity  and  vulnerable  students,  addressing  inclusion  and 
diversity in the curriculum, and celebrating diversity dur-
ing  tutor  time  and  assemblies.  Students  often  perceived 
these  approaches  to  bullying  as  too  simplistic,  and  not 
addressing  the  more  coercive  types  of  behaviour  they 
experienced.

“I  think  there’s  quite  a  lot  of  assemblies  and  stuff, 
but I think it’s not always presented in the right … 
it’s  like  very  stereotypical  bullying…  rather  than 
there’s lots of different types of bullying and some-
times  not  all  of  it  is  covered,  like  manipulative 
people and people who try and get you to do stuff, 
but that’s not [discussed]. Whereas that is actually 
bullying if they’re trying to get you to do stuff….[]…
sometimes if you’re being targeted, you don’t real-
ise that they’re bullying you because it hasn’t been 
shown  in  anything  and  you  haven’t  seen  that  as 
bullying.” School A student focus group

Staff  described  anti-bullying  messages  displayed 
around  the  school,  and  students  were  taught  about 
bystander  apathy  and  to  challenge  bullying  behaviour. 
One  school  had  anonymous  reporting  for  students  to 
report  bullying.  For  many  students  however,  recog-
nizing  and  reporting  bullying  to  school  staff  remained 
problematic.

“I  feel  like  sometimes  yes,  we  go  and  talk  to  the 
teacher  about  it  but  sometimes  some  students 
might feel that peer pressure into not doing it …[]… 
because  they’re  like,  “Don’t  do  this  or  I’ll  do  this  to 
you.” School C Student focus group

Discipline

Staff respondents discussed changes in disciplinary pro-
cedures  over  recent  years,  with  a  shift  away  from  puni-
tive  disciplinary  systems  which  appeared  to  no  longer 
work (or have an even more negative outcome on exist-
ing  behavioural  issues)  towards  restorative  approaches 
and  building  relationships/rapport  between  staff  and 
students.

As  noted,  some  staff  reported  concerns  that  BAME 
students  were  more  likely  to  be  subject  to  discipli-
nary measures, which may be due to real differences in 
behaviour  or,  conscious  or  unconscious  bias  amongst 
(predominantly)  white  staff.  Two  schools  had  adopted 
systems  emphasising  ‘rewards  before  sanctions’;  stu-
dents  could  win  points  through  positive  behaviours. 
Students  with  challenging  and  disruptive  behaviours 
at  risk  of  sanctions  were  also  offered  additional  con-
tact,  monitoring  and  support  from  staff,  to  promote 
positive  relationships.  Staff  reported  some  implemen-
tation  issues,  with  staff  training  on  restorative  jus-
tice  approaches  disrupted  by  the  pandemic,  and  some 
inconsistency in how discipline was applied. Some staff 
perceived  that  students  themselves  have  a  key  role  to 
play  in  maintaining  discipline  and  modelling  good 
behaviour.

“If  a  student  doesn’t  hold  open  a  door  for  someone 
else,  that  is  something  you  pull  them  up  on.  Any 
kind  of  bad  language  you  hear,  whether  it  is  in  a 
classroom or whoever it is directed at, is challenged. 
Uniform is absolutely 100%. Every single member of 
staff challenges it. So then the students become role 
models  for  anyone  coming  in  because  I  think,  par-
ticularly teenagers, although there are lots of excep-
tions to this, but generally speaking they don’t really 
want to stick out too much. They don’t want to be the 
one  who  is  doing  the  role  or  a  different  thing  from 
their peers.” School B staff 2

Discussion
There  are  many  examples  and  conceptualisations  of 
school  culture  in  the  literature  emerging  from  reviews 
of school culture research, and its measurement [12, 20, 
21]. The aim of this study was to identify how school cul-
ture is conceptualised by staff, students and their parents 
in  three  UK  secondary  schools.  It  adds  to  the  literature 
by providing a conceptualisation that is grounded in the 
experience  of  those  within  UK  secondary  schools:  staff, 
students, and their parents.

Respondents from three schools identified elements of 
school culture that align into four dimensions; structure 
and  context,  organisational  and  academic,  community, 
and  safety  and  support.  Structure  and  context  includes 
physical aspects of the school buildings, the geographical 
setting, and  the  diversity of these on  the  student intake, 
particularly  around  ethnicity  and  socio-economic  sta-
tus. The academic and organisational dimension includes 
how culture is led and prioritised by school leaders, peda-
gogical aspects including teaching and learning styles and 
the curriculum, academic performance, and staff compo-
sition.  Community  refers  to  the  quality  of  the  relation-
ships  within  and  across  key  stakeholders  in  any  school; 
students, parents (or carers), and school staff. Safety and 
support  primarily  refers  to  how  schools  support  stu-
dent  emotional  and  psychological  wellbeing,  including 
through the provision of both primary and targeted sup-
port for mental health, although some aspects of physical 
safety (for example, bullying) may also be important.

A  secondary  aim  was  to  explore  which  elements  of 
school  culture  are  perceived  to  be  most  important  to 
student  mental  health.  While  elements  across  all  four 
dimensions have influence, respondents were most likely 
to discuss diversity (across ethnicity, socio-economic sta-
tus,  gender  and  sexuality)  in  both  the  student  and  staff 
population  as  a  key  element  of  school  culture  likely  to 
influence  student  mental  health.  This  is  supported  by  a 
recent study of over 28,000 adolescents in England which 
found gender, ethnicity and deprivation were risk factors 
for  experiencing  mental  health  difficulties  [40].  Other 
elements of school culture that emerged as key influenc-
ers of student mental health were inclusive practice as an 
important element of mental health promotion, pastoral 
support,  the  quality  of  relationships  and  interactions  in 
the  school,  and  student  voice,  although  mechanisms  to 
promote student voice were regarded as unsatisfactory by 
most respondents, particularly students.

This  study  also  demonstrates  how  culture  was  priori-
tised by staff in the participating schools. Senior leaders 
recognised  the  importance  of  culture  and  took  a  proac-
tive stance on leading and shaping it. This was driven by 
their  belief  that  it  will  influence  student  mental  health, 
and  the  UK  Government’s  emphasis  on  the  role  of 

schools in supporting mental health [41]. It is also appar-
ent in our data how school staff were influenced by wider 
events, including the COVID19 pandemic and the subse-
quent impact on mental health, and the Black Lives Mat-
ters protests of 2020. School leaders (and all school staff ) 
reflected on the impact of these events on student men-
tal health and the need to respond and adapt aspects of 
school culture in response.

The  four  dimensions  identified  in  our  study  closely 
align with those identified in Wang and Degol’s concep-
tualisation of school climate [21], though there are some 
differences. Their ‘institutional environment’, referring to 
the physical school building and allocation of resources, 
is replaced in our study with ‘structure and context’. Par-
ticipants in our study placed little emphasis on the quality 
of  the  physical  environment  (school  buildings,  mainte-
nance, cleanliness etc.) although building design did fea-
ture.  Instead,  this  dimension  included  greater  emphasis 
on  contextual  factors  including  the  school’s  geographi-
cal  setting  and  the  diversity  of  the  student  cohort.  In 
particular,  stakeholders  in  our  study  perceived  that  the 
ethnicity,  socio-economic  status  and  to  a  lesser  extent, 
intellectual  disability  (SEND)  characteristics  of  the  stu-
dent  intake  had  a  profound  effect  on  the  culture  of  the 
school and staff efforts to manage it. Unlike other models 
of  school  culture  (or  climate),  which  consider  the  social 
composition of the student body as outside the construct 
of school culture but hugely influential over it [23, 24], in 
our  study  the  social  demographics  of  the  student  intake 
was  one  of  the  defining  features  both  of  the  school  cul-
ture and of efforts to manage and improve it.

How  might  the  dimensions  of  school  culture  as  con-
ceptualised in our study influence student mental health 
promotion?  Wang  and  Degol’s  dimensions  of  commu-
nity  (in  particular,  the  quality  of  interpersonal  relation-
ships within the school) and safety, which largely overlap 
with  those  dimensions  in  our  study,  were  found  to  be 
key  determinants  of  students’  emotional  wellbeing  [21]. 
Much  less  research  has  been  undertaken  on  the  impact 
of  academic  and  organisational  factors  on  psychological 
outcomes  (though  more  has  been  done  on  their  influ-
ence over academic outcomes). Markham and Aveyard’s 
theory of health promoting schools suggests that schools 
can  promote  (or  inhibit)  the  capacities  essential  for 
human functioning, and therefore health, through ‘fram-
ing’ and ‘classification’ [16]. ‘Framing’ refers to pedagogic 
practice, and ‘weak’ framing is that which enhances stu-
dent involvement in their own learning and opportunity 
to  influence  the  curriculum,  thus  increasing  capacity 
for  practical  reasoning.  This  is  reflected  in  our  study 
through  respondents’  accounts  of  curriculum  develop-
ment  and  efforts  to  enhance  student  voice  and  engage-
ment.  ‘Classification’  refers  to  the  boundaries  between

students, their peers, school staff, and the outside world. 
Drawing  on  Bernstein’s  theory  of  cultural  transmission 
[42],  the  authors  advocate  that  strong  boundaries  ‘insu-
late’  students  and  prevent  opportunities  for  both  form-
ing relationships (affiliation) and practical reasoning, the 
two  capacities  most  essential  to  mental  health  optimi-
sation.  In  our  study,  efforts  to  promote  better  relation-
ships  between  peers  and  with  staff,  engage  with  parents 
and  develop  the  curriculum  to  better  reflect  the  wider 
world  and  incorporate  diversity  could  be  interpreted  as 
efforts  to  weaken  these  boundaries  and  hence  promote 
affiliation.

Studies  which  focus  on  the  influence  of  one  aspect 
of  school  culture  on  student  mental  health  are  useful, 
but  may  miss  the  wider  effects  of  school  culture.  The 
boundaries  between  the  four  dimensions  identified  in 
our  study  are  not  distinct,  but  factors  within  each  one 
have influence across all dimensions. Diversity of the stu-
dent intake, in particular ethnicity, is a key factor in the 
structure  and  context  dimension  but  also  hugely  influ-
ential  over  factors  in  the  other  three  dimensions.  It  was 
particularly  salient  to  our  respondents  when  describing 
delivering and adapting the curriculum (including efforts 
to  decolonialize  it),  and  their  concerns  about  staff  com-
position.  Ethnicity  also  influences  community  factors; 
lack  of  minority  representation  amongst  staff  is  seen  to 
damage  relationships  with  BAME  students,  and  drives 
the  emphasis  on  inclusive  practice  evident  in  all  three 
schools. Staff were also cognisant of the influence of eth-
nicity on disciplinary practice, and student perception of 
the equity of this. Another illustration of influence across 
dimensional boundaries is how efforts to create a safe and 
supportive environment influence factors within the aca-
demic  and  organisational  domain,  such  as  staff  training 
on  inclusive  practice  and  the  inclusion  of  mental  health 
in  the  curriculum.  This  study  makes  clear  the  interde-
pendence  of  the  four  dimensions  in  shaping  the  culture 
of a school. School staff who seek to shape and improve 
school  culture  as  a  means  of  promoting  student  mental 
health may have better results if this interdependence is 
acknowledged,  and  improvements  are  addressed  across 
all four dimensions rather than prioritising one or two.

A strength of this study is the inclusion of the student 
voice, and of students across a range of ages and ethnici-
ties. This is unusual in school culture literature. However 
we are limited in the generalisability of our findings given 
that  participants  were  drawn  from  only  three  schools, 
from one geographical area, during a global health emer-
gency. We are also limited by the selection of parents for 
this study, as gatekeeping effects of school staff may have 
resulted  in  the  exclusion  of  parents  with  a  more  criti-
cal  appraisal  of  the  schools.  Further  work  is  required  to 
determine  if  this  conceptual  model  of  school  culture  is 

transferable  to  other  schools  in  different  contexts  (with 
within the UK and beyond).

As the PAR intervention is implemented in our study 
schools,  we  plan  further  research  with  school-based 
participants  to  explore  how  the  active  involvement  of 
students  as  co-researchers  working  to  improve  school 
culture  for  the  benefit  of  student  mental  health  works 
in  practice.  This  methodology  reflects  the  importance 
identified in the literature of active engagement and the 
promotion  of  autonomy  in  health  promoting  schools 
[9,  14,  16,  17].  Studies  are  also  needed  that  identify 
effective  ways  in  which  to  influence  all  the  different 
dimensions of school culture, to ensure safe and inclu-
sive environments that are supportive of and not detri-
mental to student mental health.
