Abstract

Background

Despite greater acceptance of sexual and gender diversity and the scientific consensus that
same-gender attraction, creative gender expression, and transness are not mental ill-
nesses, LGBTQI2+ persons are still commonly told that they can or should change their sex-
ual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression (SOGIE). The aim of this study was to
describe the prevalence of SOGIE conversion efforts, including their sociodemographic cor-
relates, among LGBTQI2+ persons.

Methods

Using community-based sampling, we assessed SOGIE conversion attempts and involve-
ment in conversion services of 3,261 LGBTQI2+ persons aged 18 years and older in Que-
bec, Canada.

Results

A quarter of respondents experienced SOGIE conversion attempts, and fewer than 5%
were involved in conversion services. Over half of those who were involved in SOGIE con-
version services consented to them, but the services’ goals were made clear and explicit to
only 55% and 30% of those who engaged in SO and GIE conversion, respectively. The
results also suggest that family plays a key role in SOGIE conversion attempts and services
utilization, and that indigenous, intersex, transgender, non-binary, and asexual persons,
people of colour, as well as individuals whose sexual orientation is not monosexual (i.e.,
bisexual, pansexual) were more likely to have been exposed to conversion attempts and
involved in conversion services.

Conclusions

This study found that the prevalence of conversion efforts is substantial. Interventions to
protect LGBTQI2+ people from such attempts should focus not only on legal bans, but also
on supporting families who need to be counseled in accepting sexual and gender diversity.
Health professionals need to be adequately trained in LGBTQI2+ affirmative approaches.
Religious therapists should consult with colleagues and undergo supervision to ensure that
their religious beliefs do not interfere with their practice.

Introduction

Despite greater acceptance of sexual and gender diversity and the scientific consensus that
same-gender attraction, creative gender expression, and transness are not mental illnesses, les-
bian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, intersex, two-spirit (LGBTQI2+) persons are still commonly
told that they can or should change their sexual orientation (SO), gender identity (GI), or gen-
der expression (GE). A recent study revealed that two-thirds of youths aged 13–24 years in the
US reported that someone had tried to convince them to change their SOGIE [1]. Such pres-
sures stem from the belief that it is best to be heterosexual and cisgender (i.e., not transgender)
and that people should be changed when they do not conform to cisheterosexist norms. The
concept of SOGIE change efforts has been coined to describe any direction or advice that
intentionally delays or impedes self-acceptance of one’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or
gender expression [2–4]. The 2020 edition of the Canadian Sex Now Survey revealed that
about 20% of sexual minority men (gay, bisexual, transgender, Two-Spirit and queer) have
been exposed to such efforts [5]. The US Transgender Survey found that 14% of respondents
reported lifetime exposure to gender identity conversion efforts [6].

Conversion therapy refers to more sustained, structured, specific interventions aiming at
changing, discouraging, or repressing SOGIE [2–4]. It relies on various techniques, inspired
by psychotherapeutic, medical, or faith-based principles (e.g., talk therapy, aversion therapy,
hormonotherapy, spiritual guidance) and takes place in various contexts ranging from private
or public settings to “gay conversion camps” or religious institutions. Not only are they ineffi-
cient, scientifically unsound, and unethical, but they are also known to have adverse effects on
survivors [6–8]. It is thus unsurprising that most psychological, medical, and sexual health pro-
fessional associations have opposed SO conversion efforts for decades, and most of them are
now adopting similar responses to GIE conversion efforts [9]. In December 2020, a ban on
SOGIE conversion therapies has been adopted in Que´bec. This new law targets practices
intended to “induce persons to change their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender
expression or to repress non-heterosexual sexual behaviour” and applies regardless of age [10].
Violations are subject to heavy fines, professional discipline, and/or victim compensation. Fed-
erally, a criminal ban has been adopted by the Senate [11]. According to this new law, anyone
who advertises, materially benefits from, or causes a person to undergo SOGIE conversion
therapy would be liable to imprisonment for up to five years depending on the offence.

Professional associations’ statements are insufficient, as conversion experiences continue to
be reported. In the US, about 4% of youths aged 13–24 years have undergone SOGI conversion
therapy [7]. In Canada, three large, non-probabilistic studies have documented SOGI conver-
sion experiences: the Sex Now survey 2011–2012 (N = 8,388) revealed that about 3.5% of Cana-
dian sexual minority men (i.e., gay, bisexual, transgender, Two-Spirit and queer) experienced

SO conversion therapy (4.2% in Quebec; [4]), the Sex Now survey 2019–2020 (N = 9,214)
found that 9.9% of participants were exposed to SOGI conversion therapy [3]; and the Trans
Pulse Canada survey (N = 2033) found that 11% of transgender and non-binary people had
experienced conversion therapy [12].

Survivor characteristics

In Canada, men who have sex with men (MSM) who have been exposed to SO or GI conver-
sion efforts or practices were more likely to be gay (compared to bisexual), transgender and
non-binary (compared to cisgender), “out” about their sexual orientation (relative to those
who were not), younger, immigrants, and to earn an annual personal income of less than
$30,000 (compared to those who earn $60,000 or more [3, 4]. The TransPULSE study found
increasing rates of conversion therapy experiences with age [12]. In a US cohort of middle-
aged and older MSM, Meanley et al. [13] found lower exposure to conversion therapy among
MSM with any college education, but higher exposure among participants who enrolled in the
studies post-2001 (compared to those enrolled pre-1987). Among US youths, Green et al. [7]
found a higher prevalence of conversion experiences among gay and lesbian youths (relative to
youths identifying as bisexual or as “something else”) and those from low-income families.

Conversion effort exposure appears to be evenly distributed before and after the age of 18

years. Societal, legal, and cultural homo- or trans-negativity is often endorsed by parents of
LGBTQI2+ youths [14, 15], leading them to seek conversion efforts for their children. Further-
more, these beliefs may lead LGBTQI2+ child(ren) to believe that they would be more
accepted if they were heterosexual and cisgender. Growing up with cultural and parental cishe-
teronormative values is thus likely to influence LGBTQI2+ persons to initiate, be exposed to,
or participate in conversion efforts, whether voluntarily or not.

To explore such societal, legal, or cultural contexts, previous studies have relied on variables

such as race/ethnicity, age cohort, religious affiliation, or family’s support of SOGIE. Salway
et al. [4] found greater SO conversion therapy prevalence among Canadian Indigenous indi-
viduals and other racial minorities (relative to White men), but no differences were found
between age groups. The study found that conversion efforts were far more common among
trans respondents (12.1% versus 3.5%). Salway et al. [3] found that the prevalence of SOGI
conversion therapy practices was higher among younger generations, immigrants, and racial/
ethnic minorities. Meanley et al. [13] found a greater prevalence of these practices among US
middle-aged and older Black MSM (both non-Hispanic and Hispanic) and those of other
racial minority groups (compared to non-Hispanic White men), while Green et al. [7] found a
higher prevalence among Hispanic/Latinx youths. In Ryan et al.’s [8] sample, respondents who
were not born in the US were more likely than those born in the US to report having been
taken to a therapist or religious leader by their parents to change their SO. Hypothesizing the
role of more conservative values, Flores et al. [16] found lower support for banning conversion
therapy among US racial and cultural minority groups. This conclusion supports the finding
that ethnic minority parents report greater levels of homonegativity than ethnic majority
parents [17]. Given the between-country variations in attitudes toward SOGIE, we can expect
variations in exposure to conversion efforts depending on the country of birth.

Youth who underwent SO or SOGI conversion therapy are also more likely to come from
religious families [8] or to have heard their parents (or caregivers) use religion to justify saying
negative things about LGBTQ individuals [7]. Adamson et al. [18] found that, in their world-
wide sample, about one-fourth of respondents who have been exposed to conversion efforts
indicated that they had sought conversion therapy on their own, while the rest of the sample
reported that this decision was beyond their control or made on their behalf by their family,

religious leaders or community, school, or employer. They also found that most practitioners
who led conversion therapy were mental health providers, followed by religious authorities or
their associates.

While LGBTQI2+ people in Canada have been subjected to SOGIE conversion efforts, data

are still scarce as most studies are limited to sexual minority men and specifically to SO con-
version efforts. In Quebec, the only prevalence estimates available come from the Sex Now sur-
vey data, which found conversion therapy rates of 4.2% for SO [4] and 6.8% for SOGI [3]
among Canadian sexual minority men. While little is known about conversion efforts among
other sexual orientation groups (e.g., bisexual and pansexual individuals) and across genders
and gender modalities (i.e., cisgender or transgender), rates of conversion efforts appear higher
among transgender people [3, 4, 12, 19]. Moreover, as asexuality has only been recently recog-
nised as different from sexual desire disorders [20], it is likely that persons describing their sex-
ual orientation as asexual are more likely to have experienced sexual orientation conversion
efforts or to have sought services to help them change. Also, to our knowledge, data on intersex
persons’ experiences with gender identity assignment or modification are also scarce, though
such experiences are likely as intersex variations are treated as a medical condition falling
under sex/gender (re)assignment. Relying on a large, province-wide community-based survey,
the current study describes the prevalence of SOGIE conversion attempts and involvement in
conversion services, as well as their sociodemographic correlates, among LGBTQI2+ persons
in Quebec.

Method
Participant recruitment

Data on SOGIE conversion experiences were collected as part of the Understanding the Inclu-
sion and Exclusion of LGBTQ People (UNIE-LGBTQ) research project, which aimed to docu-
ment events during which LGBTQI2+ people (aged 18 years and older) were demeaned,
rejected and belittled, or deprived of the full extent of their rights in important life domains.
Participants were recruited from September 2019 to August 2020 (before any legal ban on con-
version therapy in Quebec or Canada) through the project’ and community partners’ commu-
nication channels (emails, listservs, the project website, Facebook pages and groups, Twitter,
and LinkedIn), web and printed media, and word of mouth. The survey was administered
online and was available in both French and English. Inclusion criteria were understanding
French or English, being at least 18 years old, self-identify as LGBTQI2+, and live in the prov-
ince of Quebec.

Over 6,000 persons accessed the online questionnaire, of which we retained only those who

provided a valid Quebec postal code or whose IP address was located in the province
(n = 6,095). Participants who did not provide sufficient data to confirm their eligibility or who
did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded (n = 1,115, of which 11 did not consent, 71
were younger than 18, and 85 were not LGBTQI2+). The final sample was composed of 4,980
participants. The present paper is based on the data of the 3,261 respondents who provided
information on their exposure to SOGIE conversion attempts or their involvement in SOGIE
conversion services. This study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board of the
Universite´ du Que´bec à Montre´al (Que´bec, Canada) (Protocol #2775).

Measures

We assessed lifetime involvement in conversion therapy services and lifetime exposure to con-
version attempts. Both were measured separately for SO and GIE, as social attitudes and pro-
fessional guidelines toward sexual diversity and gender diversity are different. The four items

used to assess these constructs, and their response options, are presented in Table 1. The
research team created the survey questions based on the scientific literature and by consulting
experts on conversion therapy and key informants from community-based organizations.

Questions on lifetime involvement in conversion services were introduced by explicitly stat-

ing the aim of such services. Participants were provided with the following instructions: “The
next questions ask about the contacts you may have had with services for which your aim was,
for instance, [see Table 1 for specific wording of the aim for SO and GIE]. These services may
have been provided by health professionals, spiritual or religious guides, or other types of peo-
ple. These services may go by various names, including therapy or treatment (conversion,
reparative, or corrective), special consultations, spiritual processes, healing or deliverance ses-
sions, or other names you may be familiar with. Answer the following questions in relation to
all the services you have been in contact with taken together, whether this was on your own
initiative or upon someone else’s request (parent, partner, spiritual advisor, etc.)”. Contrary to
these organized efforts, conversion attempts refer to any direction or advice to change some-
one’s SOGIE, make them conform to cisheterosexist norms, or to prevent them from becom-
ing gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.

We asked those who were involved in conversion services to provide information on their

most recent experience: their age at the time, and the type of service provider (response
options were: a doctor or psychiatrist; a psychologist; a sexologist; another type of therapist or
psychotherapist; a member of the clergy, of a religious group, or of a church; no recollection of
the person; other). We also inquired about the goals of the services. For SO conversion, the
goals were: “to prevent you from being or becoming gay, lesbian, or bisexual”; “to change your
sexual orientation (e.g., toward heterosexuality)”; and “to change how you express yourself in
your body (your mannerisms, your ways of speaking, moving, walking, dressing, doing your
hair, etc.)”. For GIE conversion, the possible goals were: “to prevent you from being or becom-
ing trans”; “to change your gender identity (e.g., to become cisgender)”; and “to change how
you express your gender identity with your body (your mannerisms, your ways of speaking,
moving, walking, dressing, doing your hair, etc.)”. The four response anchors were dichoto-
mized: not at all (coded 0); a bit (coded 0); somewhat (coded as 1); and a lot (coded as 1).
Respondents also indicated whether they themselves, their parents (or their representatives),

or someone else consented to these services and whether their conversion purposes were
explicit from the beginning (response options: yes; no).

We also explored six potential motivations to seeking conversion services: 1) “I thought it
would be easier for me and for my future if I tried”, 2) “I wanted to become [heterosexual, or
cisgender] or to avoid becoming [gay, lesbian, or bisexual, or trans]”, 3) I was afraid of negative
consequences if I refused to try (e.g., family rejection, refusal of care, termination of treat-
ment), 4) “I felt that my loved ones would be happy if I did it”, 5) “I could not say no to the per-
son or people who suggested it to me”, and 6) “They convinced me it was a good idea to try”.
The response options ranged from 0 (Totally false) to 3 (Totally true).

Additional data on year of birth, intersex variation, sexual orientation, gender modality and

identity, race/ethnicity, education, place of birth, household income, parents’ religious atten-
dance, and perceived parents’ attributed importance to religious upbringing were also
collected.

Data analysis

Descriptive statistics were computed to summarize the sample’s characteristics. Continuous
variables were presented as means and standard deviations, or as medians and intervals
defined by the first and third quartiles. For dichotomous variables, their prevalence and 95%
exact confidence intervals (CI) were calculated [21]. For categorical variables, we presented the
proportion of each category and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated simultaneously for
multinomial proportions [22]. Chi-square or Ficher exact tests were used to compare the dis-
tributions of the lifetime exposure to SOGIE conversion attempts and involvement in conver-
sion services between cisgender LGBQ+ and trans participants. Crude Poisson regression with
a robust error variance [23] was applied to assess the associations between lifetime exposure to
SOGIE conversion attempts or service involvement and participant’s characteristics on the
prevalence ratio (PR) scale. Analyses were performed using STATA 16.1 and SAS 9.4.

Missing data on the outcome variables followed a monotone pattern reflecting sections
order in the online questionnaire, ranging from 34.5% (for conversion services involvement)
to 39.7% (for conversion attempts). For both outcomes, weak associations [24, 25] were found
between the presence of missing data and education (Cramer’s V between 0.12 and 0.13), and
between the missingness in SOGIE conversion services involvement and birth cohort (Cra-
mer’s V = 0.12), suggesting that missing data on the outcome variables were not completely
random. Participants with a university degree and older participants were more likely to have
completed the questionnaire. The percentage of missing values in the analytic sample was
below 9% for most variables included in the present paper but exceeded 10% for two variables
(parental religious attendance and attitudes). Statistical guidelines suggest that bias is neglige-
able with less than 10% missingness [26]. Missing values were not replaced. The significance
level was set at p < 0.05.

Results
Participants

Table 2 presents the sample’s characteristics. While most participants were born after 1980,
multiple birth cohorts were represented. Most participants described their sexual orientation
as gay or lesbian (59%), bisexual (17%), or pansexual (10%). Over 80% of the sample was cis-
gender (43% women, 40% men), and 17% were transgender or non-binary (12% trans men
and non-binary assigned female at birth, 5% trans women and non-binary persons assigned
male at birth). Fourteen persons reported intersex variations. Most of the sample was white
(89%) but included indigenous people (3%) and people of color (8%). Over half of participants

respondents reported that their parents never attended religious services and did not attribute
any importance to religious upbringing.

Lifetime prevalence of SOGIE conversion attempt exposure and
involvement in conversion services

Overall, 26.4% (95% CI, 24.8% to 28.0%) of respondents have experienced lifetime SOGIE con-
version attempts or have been involved in conversion services (see Table 3). Cisgender sexual
minority participants were more likely to have experienced conversion efforts targeting their
SO (20.0%, 95% CI, 18.4 to 21.5) than their GIE (6.2%, 95% CI, 5.3 to 7.2), while trans partici-
pants were more likely to have been targeted for their GIE (41.9, 37.5 to 46.4) rather than their
SO (25.6%, 95% CI, 21.8 to 29.7). Overall, trans participants were more likely to have been
exposed to SOGIE conversion attempts and involved in SOGIE conversion services.

SOGIE conversion attempts

Over two-thirds of respondents identified family members as responsible for the SOGIE con-
version attempts (see Table 4), followed by friends and acquaintances, members of the clergy,
and relationship (ex-)partners. Ten percent or less of participants identified healthcare profes-
sionals as responsible for such efforts. Trans participants were more likely than their cisgender
LGBQ+ counterparts to have experienced GIE conversion attempts by friends or acquain-
tances (28.4%, 95% CI: 22.2% to 35.1% vs 15.3%, 95% CI: 9.8% to 22.2%), relationship (ex-)
partner(s) (22.9%, 95% CI: 17.3% to 29.3% vs 11.1%, 95% CI: 6.5% to 17.4%), and healthcare
professionals (12.9%, 95% CI: 8.6% to 18.4% vs 2.1%, 95% CI: 0.4% to 6.0%).

Table 5 reports sociodemographic correlates of SO and GIE conversion attempts. SO con-
version attempts were more commonly experienced by respondents who were bisexual, pan-
sexual, and asexual (compared to gay/lesbian), transgender (compared to cisgender),
indigenous and racialized (compared to white), and those whose parents were more likely to
attend religious services (compared to never) and to at least somewhat value religious upbring-
ing (compared to not at all). SO conversion attempts were less common among participants
who had a college or university education (compared to less than college), who were born in
Canada (compared to those born abroad), and who reported an annual household income of
over $30,000 CAD (compared to < $30,000 CAD).

GIE conversion attempts were more commonly experienced by participants who were born

in 1981–1990 and after 1990 (compared to those born before 1955), who reported an intersex
variation (compared to endosex respondents), who were bisexual, pansexual, queer, and asex-
ual (compared to gay/lesbian), transgender (compared to cisgender), transmasculine and
transfeminine (compared to cisgender women), indigenous and racialized (compared to
white), and by participants whose parents extremely valued religious upbringing (compared to
not at all). GIE conversion attempts were less commonly experienced by respondents with a
college or university education (compared to less than college) and by those who reported an
annual household income of over $60,000 CAD (compared to < $30,000 CAD).

Involvement in SOGIE conversion services

Regarding SOGIE conversion services’ involvement (see Table 6), respondents born after 1990
reported the lowest prevalence (2.5%, 95% CI 1.8% to 3.4%), with a gradual increase among
older cohorts. Participants born before 1955 were the most likely to have been involved in
these services (11.7%, 95% CI, 7.7% to 17.2%) compared to other age cohorts, as were trans-
gender participants (PR = 1.59, 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.30), cisgender men (PR = 1.62, 1.12 to 2.36)
and transfeminine participants (PR = 3.28, 1.94 to 5.55) compared to cisgender women, indig-
enous (PR = 2.10, 95% CI, 1.10 to 4.03) and racialized participants (PR = 2.08, 95% CI, 1.33–
3.26) compared to white, and those whose parents attended religious services at least 3 times a
year, compared to never, and to value religious upbringing at least somewhat, compared to not
at all).

Regarding the most recent involvement in SOGIE conversion services (Table 7) results
show a wide range in terms of the age at which it took place, with as early as 2 years old and as
late as almost 60 years old (median age = 18 years). Over half of occurrences occurred after
2000, with trans participants being more likely to have experienced such involvement after
2009 (57.1, 95% CI: 36.8 to 75.3) compared to cisgender ones (24.8, 95% CI: 16.0 to 36.3).
Most commonly, the services were provided by healthcare professionals (doctors, psychiatrists,
psychologists, or sexologists), a member of the clergy, another type of professional (e.g., coun-
selors, therapists, teachers, etc.) or, less commonly, by a relative or a family friend. Multiple
service providers were identified, which suggests that multiple persons provided conversion
services, or that some of them occupied multiple functions (e.g., both a healthcare professional
and a member of the clergy, both a sexologist and physician, etc.).

Among cisgender participants, conversion services’ main goals were to make them hetero-
sexual (69.0%) or to prevent them from being gay, lesbian, or bisexual (62.4%). Among trans
participants, the most reported goals were to make them heterosexual (83%), change their gen-
der identity (68.2%) or their gender expression (60.0%), or to prevent them from being or
becoming transgender (65.2%).

Among respondents who were involved in SO conversion services, about 52% consented

themselves, of whom only 55% were clearly aware of the services’ objectives (see Table 8).
About 48% reported that their parents (or a family member) consented on their behalf, with
over 60% of them indicating that the family member(s) did so with clear awareness of the ser-
vices’ objectives. An additional one-fifth of participants who were involved in SO conversion
services reported that someone other than family consented on their behalf, being cognizant of
the services’ objectives in over 80% of cases. The most frequently endorsed reasons for using
such services were that they thought it would be easier for them and for their future if they
tried, and that they could not say no to the person or people who suggested it.

Approximately 56% of respondents having been involved in GIE conversion services con-

sented themselves, 30% of whom were cognizant of these services’ conversion goals. Forty

percent reported that their family consented for them, with clear awareness of the services’
objectives in 40% of cases. One-fifth of the participants who were involved in GIE conversion
services reported that someone other than family consented on their behalf (e.g., physician,
member of the clergy, psychologist, friends, school staff, etc.), close to 63% of whom were
clearly aware of the services’ objectives. The main reasons endorsed for using these services
were to make their lives and futures easier, to please their loved ones, and because they feared
negative consequences in case of refusal (e.g., family rejection, refusal of care, termination of
treatment, etc.).

Discussion

This study is the first to report data on lifetime exposure to various forms of SOGIE conversion
efforts across all gender identities and modalities and sexual orientation groups in Canada. We
used data from a large community-based survey to investigate SOGIE prevalence and corre-
lates among LGBTQI2+ people in the province of Quebec. This study revealed that 4.4% of the
sample used SOGIE conversion services, with higher prevalence rates among trans participants
(PR = 1.59, 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.30). The overall rate of conversion service involvement was close
to those reported for Quebecois MSM in the Canadian Sex Now survey (4.2%, [4]; 6.8%; [3]).
In the current study, conversion services involvement among transgender participants (6.3%)
was lower than that reported in the US Transgender Survey (i.e., 14%; [6]).

SOGIE modification attempts were far more prevalent than conversion services involve-
ment in the current LGBTQI2+ sample (25%), particularly among trans participants who were
about 7 times more likely to report so compared to cisgender participants. In comparison, Sal-
way et al. [5] report a lower prevalence among sexual-minority men (15% in Quebec, 20%
across Canada). Disparities in these estimates may reflect variations in the wording of the phe-
nomenon, such as services involvement, sustained efforts [5], conversion therapy [1, 7, 13],

reparative therapy [7], attempts or efforts [3], treatment or cure [8], or sexual repair/reorienta-
tion [4], as well as geographical variations in the conversion services offered and in the societal
attitudes toward sexual and gender diversity across the US and Canada, and in Quebec more
specifically.

Correlates of conversion services involvement

It should be noted that licensed healthcare providers were responsible for about half of the cur-
rent sample’s most recent conversion experiences, and members of the clergy or of a religious
group, for about one-third. Over half of participants reported having consented to SOGIE con-
version services. These services’ objectives, however, were clear to only 55% of those who
engaged in SO conversion and to 30% of those who engaged in GIE conversion, which sug-
gests that the goal of conversion became known to these participants only once after being
involved in the process. These numbers are higher than those of a previous study that included
participants from over 100 countries and showed that only one-fourth of the sample have
sought conversion services on their own, while the rest of respondents declared that the deci-
sion was largely outside of their control [18].

The results also show that other persons were also involved to varying degrees in these deci-
sions (parents, extended family, religious congregation members, or school personnel, includ-
ing private school personnel, which are assumed to be religious), and that these individuals
were more likely than the participants to have been aware of the services’ conversion goals.
Overall, conversion services involvement among Quebec LGBTQI2+ persons likely resulted
from concerted efforts from their immediate environment. Given that the most frequently
endorsed reasons to consent to or comply with these services were the wish for a better future
and the fear of rejection, it is also likely that these individuals were swayed by ambient hostility
toward sexual and gender diversity, leading them to believe that SOGIE conversion was their
best option. The results further revealed that a high percentage of participants, parents, and
family members were unaware of conversion services’ goals, suggesting that they may involve
deception or manipulation, especially in relation to GIE conversion services. To increase
power when exploring for correlates, we merged participants who reported having accessed
any SO or GIE conversion services. This decision was supported by our finding that response
patterns concerning both services were similar. Contrary to Salway et al. [3] who found a
greater exposure to conversion therapy practices among younger generations of Canadian
MSM, we observed a birth cohort effect regarding the accessing of conversion services, with
older cohorts being more likely than younger ones to report having done so. This pattern may
reflect changes in societal attitudes and professional regulations that oppose SO conversion
practices, and only more recently, GIE conversion practices.

Accessing SOGIE conversion services was also more commonly reported by indigenous
and racialized participants, as well as by those from more religious families. These findings
support those of previous studies, and suggests that these groups may endorse more conserva-
tive values and stricter sexuality and gender norms (often imported from a colonial past; see
Barker [27]), which contribute to create a hostile climate toward sexual and gender diversity
and to increase the likelihood of seeking SOGIE conversion services [15]. While there were no
variations between sexual orientation groups regarding SOGIE conversion services involve-
ment, we found that transgender persons and those assigned male at birth (cisgender, trans-
gender, or non-binary) presented increased risk. This points to a lower threshold for gender
(non-)conformity tolerance toward persons assigned male at birth. Contrary to Salway et al.
[4], low-income participants were not more likely to have been involved in SOGIE conversion
services than those with higher incomes.

Correlates of conversion attempts

While our findings regarding SOGIE conversion attempts also confirm the role of sociocul-
tural context, differences between SO and GIE conversion attempts are noteworthy. While SO
conversion efforts occurred in similar proportions across birth cohorts, GIE attempts were
mainly reported by younger generations. This could reflect socially and politically conservative
reactions to increased consultations regarding GIE variations among younger generations
[28]. Such conversion attempts could also be due to more recent cohorts of non-binary and
transgender persons coming out earlier due to increasing trans visibility, and while still living
in their parents’ homes, which can make them more vulnerable to family pressure and other
cisnormative influences.

Both SO and GIE conversion attempts were more commonly reported by less educated and

lower income participants, while SO conversion attempts more specifically were more com-
mon among those who were from more religious households and who were born outside Can-
ada. These results confirm previous findings about the key role of geographical and
socioeconomic factors in creating a social or family context that is hostile to sexual and gender
diversity. As Salway et al. [4] suggested, it is possible that the association between ethnicity and
racialized status and SO conversion efforts may be at least partially explained by the mediating
effect of socioeconomic factors. Yet, as exposure to SOGIE conversion likely happened before
the income and education level measured at the time of the study, it is more likely that expo-
sure to SOGIE conversion efforts has negatively impacted the socioeconomic trajectory, a
hypothesis that is also suggested by other authors [8].

That SOGIE conversion attempts were more commonly reported by individuals who iden-
tified as other than gay or lesbian can reflect the greater acceptance and recognition of gay and
lesbian persons, while other sexual identities remain misunderstood (e.g., bisexuality and pan-
sexuality) or conceptualized as sexual disorders (e.g., asexuality). Results revealed how cisnor-
mativity can also affect intersex persons, who were more likely than their endosex
counterparts to have been exposed to GIE, but not SO, conversion attempts. Moreover, our
results showed that, compared to their cisgender counterparts, transgender persons were more
exposed to both SO and GIE conversion attempts. Their higher exposure to SO conversion
efforts might reflect how gender (non)conformity is often taken as a sign of non-heterosexual-
ity. Unlike conversion services, there were no significant differences in the rates of conversion
attempts between trans people assigned male and assigned female at birth.

Strengths and limitations

This study is the first to examine exposure to both SO and GIE conversion attempts and con-
version services involvement across multiple sexual orientation groups and gender identities
and modalities in a large sample. Yet, this work also has some limitations. First, its cross-sec-
tional, retrospective design is subject to recall bias and prevents any causal inferences. Second,
as for any self-selected, non-probabilistic sampling, it is likely that the LGBTQI2+ persons
who volunteered to participate are different from those who did not. While we used multiple,
diversified recruitment strategies, the results cannot be generalized beyond the present sample.
Third, as the SOGIE conversion experiences were elicited using non-validated self-reports, our
indicators may not have accurately captured their prevalence.

Despite these weaknesses, this study provides a unique overview of Quebec’s LGBTQI2
+ populations’ SOGIE conversion experiences, including women’s (cisgender and transgen-
der). The results highlight that while conversion services involvement was more common
among older generations, conversion attempts were more common among younger ones. Our
findings also show the increased vulnerability to conversion attempts and service involvement

among participants with religious upbringing, indigenous persons and people of colour, inter-
sex, transgender, non-binary and asexual persons, as well as those who did not have a mono-
sexual sexual orientation (bisexual, pansexual).

To protect LGBTQI2+ persons from such attempts and practices, legal bans on conversion
practices are an important step as they send a strong message about their unethical and harm-
ful nature. However, they will not be insular to faith-based practices and they will be insuffi-
cient to eliminate pressures and practices covertly operating under the guise of exploration.
Professionals’ ongoing commitment is sorely needed, professional associations must expand
their statements regarding sexual orientation and gender identity and expression practices,
and healthcare providers need adequate training in LGBTQI2+ affirmative approaches. Reli-
gious counselors should also address the religious beliefs and cisheterosexist assumptions
underlying their spiritual guidance or clinical practice. Addressing such biases does not imply
deconstructing their religious beliefs, but rather exploring how their faith can impact their
clinical practice [29, 30]. Moreover, as families play a key role in pressuring children into con-
version practices, they need to be supported and counseled in the acceptance of their
LGBTQIA+ children. More studies are needed to better understand parental and family char-
acteristics associated with heterosexism and cissexism.
