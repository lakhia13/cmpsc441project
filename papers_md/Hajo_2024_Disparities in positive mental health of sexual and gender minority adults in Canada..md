Introduction:  The  goal  of  this  study  was  to  examine  potential  disparities  in  positive 
mental health (PMH) among adults in Canada by sexual orientation and gender modality.

Methods: Using 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Annual Component 
data (N = 57 034), we compared mean life satisfaction and the prevalence of high self-
rated mental health (SRMH), happiness and community belonging between heterosexual 
and  sexual  minority  adults,  and  between  cisgender  and  gender  minority  adults.  We 
used 2019 CCHS Rapid Response on PMH data (N = 11 486) to compare the prevalence 
of  high  psychological  well-being  between  heterosexual  and  sexual  minority  adults. 
Linear and logistic regression analyses examined the between-group differences in mean 
life satisfaction and the other PMH outcomes, respectively.

Results: Sexual minority (vs. heterosexual) adults reported lower mean life satisfaction 
(B = −0.7, 95% CI: −0.8, −0.5) and were less likely to report high SRMH (OR = 0.4, 
95%  CI:  0.3,  0.5),  happiness  (OR  =  0.4,  95%  CI:  0.3,  0.5),  community  belonging 
(OR  =  0.6,  95%  CI:  0.5,  0.7)  and  psychological  well-being  (OR  =  0.4,  95%  CI:  0.3, 
0.6). Differences were not always significant for specific sexual minority groups in sex-
stratified  analyses.  Gender  minority  adults  reported  lower  mean  life  satisfaction  and 
were less likely to report high SRMH and happiness than cisgender adults.

Conclusion: Future research could investigate how these PMH disparities arise, risk and 
protective  factors  in  these  populations,  how  other  sociodemographic  factors  interact 
with sexual orientation and gender identity to influence PMH and changes in disparities 
over time.

Keywords: sexual orientation, gender identity, health inequalities, positive mental health,

Highlights

•  We investigated disparities in posi-
tive mental health (PMH) between 
sexual  minority  and  heterosexual 
adults and between gender minor-
ity and cisgender adults in Canada 
in 2019.

•  Mean  life  satisfaction  was  signifi-
cantly  lower  among  sexual  minor-
ity adults than among heterosexual 
adults.

•  Prevalence  of  high  self-rated  men-
tal  health,  happiness,  community 
belonging  and  psychological  well-
being were also significantly lower 
among sexual minority adults than 
among heterosexual adults.

•  Mean  life  satisfaction  and  preva-
lence  of  high  self-rated  mental 
health  and  happiness  were  also 
significantly  lower  among  gender 
minority  adults  than  among  cis-
gender adults.

Introduction

In  2015–2018,  3.2%  of  individuals  in 
Canada aged 15 years and older identified 
as gay, lesbian or bisexual,1 while in 2021, 
0.3%  identified  as  transgender  or  nonbi-
nary.2 Sexual orientation and gender modal-
ity  (i.e.  the  congruence  or  incongruence 
between gender identity and sex assigned 

at birth3) are sociodemographic character-
istics that can have wide-ranging implica-
tions  for  health.4,5  Research  shows  that 
Two-Spirit,  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  trans-
gender, queer, and additional people who 
identify as part of sexual and gender diverse 
communities (2SLGBTQ+)* individuals are 
at  greater  risk  of  negative  psychological 
outcomes  compared  to  their  heterosexual 

and cisgender peers,6,7 includ ing higher prev-
alence  rates  of  depression  and  anxiety 
disorders,  and  of  suicidal  ideation  and 
attempts  among  sexual  minority6,8-10  and 
transgender7 individuals. Non-suicidal self- 
injury is also more prevalent among sexual 
and gender minority (SGM) people.11 Dis-
parities in negative psychological outcomes

population health surveys.12-16

These inequalities are often explained using 
minority stress theory—namely, that SGM 
people experience worse mental health on 
average due to the excess stress caused by 
the  stigma,  prejudice  and  discrimination 
they  face  and  by  the  internalization  of 
negative  societal  attitudes.17,18  Supporting 
this  theory,  stigmatizing  events,  internal-
ized transphobia or homophobia, expecta-
tions of rejection and identity concealment 
have  been  associated  with  negative  psy-
chological  outcomes  among  2SLGBTQ+ 
individuals.19-22

implies 

While  existing  research  may  provide 
insights into the experience of mental ill-
ness  and  distress  in  2SLGBTQ+  popula-
tions,  these  outcomes  do  not  encompass 
all  aspects  of  mental  health.  The  World 
Health  Organization  defines  health  as  “a 
state  of  complete  physical,  mental  and 
social  well-being  and  not  merely  the 
absence  of  disease  or  infirmity.”23  This 
definition 
that  mental  health 
spans beyond mental illness (i.e. ill-being) 
and  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the 
positive  aspects  of  mental  health  (i.e. 
well-being). Based on the dual-continuum 
model  of  mental  health,  positive  mental 
health  (PMH)  and  mental  illness  do  not 
fall  on  opposing  ends  of  a  single  contin-
uum  but  are  distinct  (albeit  related)  con-
structs.24,25 Accordingly, an individual may 
live  with  a  mental  illness,  but  still  have 
relatively  high  PMH.26  Thus,  to  fully 
understand  the  mental  health  of  SGM 
people,  it  is  important  to  also  examine 
their  emotional,  psychological  and  social 
well-being.27  A  focus  on  PMH  can  move 
us beyond traditional biomedical and defi-
cit-based approaches to a more strengths-
based understanding of the men tal health 
of SGM individuals.28

Some  previous  studies  have  investigated 
the overall PMH of sexual minority people 
in  Canada  using  data  from  large  popula-
tion  health  surveys.13,29,30  For  instance, 
analyses  of  data  from  the  2012  Canadian 
Community Health Survey (CCHS) – Mental 
Health indicates that sexual minority indi-
viduals had lower PMH than heterosexual 
individuals,29,30  while  analyses  from  the 
2015  CCHS  only  showed  significant  dis-
parities in PMH among bisexual individu-
als.13  These  studies  examined  PMH  as  a 
single  broad  construct  in  analyses;  how-
ever,  multiple  PMH  outcomes  can  be 

investigated to obtain a more fine-grained 
and  nuanced  understanding  of  different 
aspects of well-being in and between pop-
ulations.31-33  Indeed,  the  Public  Health 
Agency  of  Canada  (PHAC)  monitors  the 
PMH  of  adults  in  Canada  using  five  out-
comes  in  its  Positive  Mental  Health  Sur-
veillance Indicator Framework (PMHSIF): 
self-rated  mental  health  (SRMH),  happi-
ness,  life  satisfaction,  psychological  well-
being and community belonging.31,32

More  generally,  little  is  known  about  the 
PMH  of  gender  minority  individuals  in 
Canada  given  that  questions  distinguish-
ing between sex at birth and gender iden-
tity  only  began  to  be  included  in  more 
recent population health surveys.34

Finally,  there  are  indications  that  some 
PMH outcomes like high SRMH have been 
decreasing  in  prevalence  in  Canada  since 
2015;35 inequalities in PMH outcomes may 
have changed if temporal trends were not 
identical  in  both  2SLGBTQ+  and  non-
2SLGBTQ+ populations. To address these 
gaps, we used more recent data from 2019 
to comprehensively examine disparities in 
PMH by sexual orientation and by gender 
modality  across  PMH  outcomes  from  the 
PMHSIF.31,32

Methods

Data and participants

from 

Data  for  four  out  of  five  PMH  outcomes 
came 
the  2019  CCHS  Annual 
Component,34  which  was  collected  from 
January to December 2019. The fifth PMH 
outcome,  psychological  well-being,  was 
measured  in  the  Rapid  Response  compo-
nent  of  the  2019  CCHS,36  administered  to 
respondents  who  participated  in  January 
to March 2019. Statistics Canada excluded 
from  the  target  population  of  the  2019 
CCHS full-time members of the Canadian 
Armed  Forces  as  well  as  individuals  liv-
ing  on  First  Nations  reserves  and  other 
Indigenous  settlements  in  the  provinces, 
in institutions, in foster care if aged 12 to 
17 years, or in two specific health regions 
in Quebec; less than 3% of individuals in 
Canada aged 12 years and older are repre-
sented in these exclusions. Individuals liv-
ing  in  the  territories  were  excluded  from 
the target population for the Rapid Response 
component; territorial data were collected 
but  unavailable  in  the  2019  Annual 
Component  as  these  data  are  only  repre-
sentative  after  2  years  of  data  collection. 
The  sampling  frame  used  for  the  Labour 

198

Force  Survey  was  also  used  in  the  2019 
CCHS for adults living in the provinces.

Respondents  completed  the  2019  CCHS 
via computer-assisted telephone or in-per-
son  interviews.  The  2019  CCHS  collected 
data  from  individuals  aged  12  years  and 
older,  although  only  those  aged  15  years 
and  older  were  asked  about  their  sexual 
orientation.  Nevertheless,  we  excluded 
youth aged 12 to 17 years from our study 
because  different  measures  are  used  to 
monitor  some  indicators  of  PMH  in  the 
youth  version  of  PMHSIF.32  Moreover,  we 
only had access to data from respondents 
who agreed to share their data with PHAC 
and  Health  Canada.  As  illustrated  in 
Figure  1,  these  restrictions  led  to  sample 
sizes of 57 034 for the Annual Component 
and 11 486 for the Rapid Response.

Measures

Positive mental health outcomes
Of the five PMH outcomes included in the 
adult  PMHSIF,32,33  SRMH,  happiness,  life 
satisfaction and community belonging were 
captured  in  the  Annual  Component.  Psy-
chological  well-being  was  only  measured 
in the Rapid Response. Our coding of high 
PMH  was  based  on  the  cut-offs  used  in 
the PMHSIF.32

SRMH  was  assessed  with  the  question, 
“In  general,  would  you  say  your  mental 
health  is…?”  Response  options  included 
“excellent,” “very good,” “good,” “fair” and 
“poor.” We dichotomously coded individ-
uals  who  responded  “excellent”  or  “very 
good” as having high SRMH. This type of 
question  has  been  recommended  as  a 
measure  of  general  mental  health  status 
by the OECD.25 Responses to this question 
have been associated with a wide range of 
physical and mental health outcomes.37

Happiness  was  assessed  with  the  ques-
tion, “Would you describe yourself as being 
usually...?”  Response  options  included 
“happy and interested in life,” “somewhat 
happy,”  “somewhat  unhappy,”  “unhappy 
with little interest in life” and “so unhappy, 
that  life  is  not  worthwhile.”  We  dichoto-
mously coded individuals who responded 
“happy  and  interested  in  life”  as  having 
high levels of happiness.

Life  satisfaction  was  assessed  with  the 
question, “Using a scale of 0 to 10, where 
0 means ‘very dissatisfied’ and 10 means 
‘very  satisfied,’  how  do  you  feel  about 
your  life  as  a  whole  right  now?”  In  the

which  can  be  considered  part  of  eudai-
monic  well-being  or  the  positive  func-
tioning  component  of  PMH  (along  with 
psychological well-being).27,38

Psychological  well-being  was  measured 
using the six items from the psychological 
well-being  subscale  of  the  Mental  Health 
Continuum—Short  Form.39  Respondents 
were  asked  how  often  in  the  past  month 
they felt (1) that they liked most parts of 
their  personality;  (2)  good  at  managing 
the  responsibilities  of  their  daily  life; 
(3) that they had warm and trusting rela-
tionships  with  others;  (4)  that  they  had 
experiences that challenged them to grow 
and become a better person; (5) confident 
to  think  or  express  their  own  ideas  and 
opinions;  and  (6)  that  their  life  had  a 
sense of direction or meaning to it. These 
questions are designed to measure the six 
components  of  psychological  well-being 
identified  by  Ryff40:  self-acceptance,  envi-
ronmental mastery, positive relations with 
others,  personal  growth,  autonomy  and 
purpose in life. We recoded the following 
response options to represent the number 
of  days  in  the  past  month:  “every  day“ 
(28 days = 7 days per week × 4 weeks); 
“almost every day” (20 days = 5 days per 
week  ×  4  weeks);  “about  2  or  3  times  a 
week” (10 days = 2.5 days per week × 4 
weeks);  “about  once  a  week”  (4  days  = 
1  day  per  week  ×  4  weeks);  “once  or 
twice”  (1.5  days)  and  “never”  (0  days).41 
We  averaged  the  recoded  responses  and 
dichotomously  coded  respondents  with  a 
mean score of 20 or higher as having high 
psychological well-being.

Sexual orientation
Respondents  were  asked,  “What  is  your 
sexual orientation?” Response options were 
“heterosexual,” “homosexual,” “bisexual” 
and  “please  specify.”  Individuals  who 
specified  a  sexual  orientation  that  could 
be classified as one of the existing response 
options  were  recoded  into  that  category 
by  Statistics  Canada.  We  coded  individu-
als  who  identified  as  homosexual  (gay/
lesbian),  bisexual/pansexual  or  another 
sexual orientation as a sexual minority.

current  research  we  treated  this  as  a 
numerical  variable  and  report  on  mean 
life  satisfaction.  Happiness  and  life  satis-
faction  are  core  aspects  of  hedonic  well-
being or the positive feeling component of 
PMH.27,38

Community  belonging  was  assessed  with 
the  question,  “How  would  you  describe 

your sense of belonging to your local com-
munity? Would you say it is…?” Response 
options  included  “very  strong,”  “some-
what strong,” “somewhat weak” and “very 
weak.”  We  dichotomously  coded  individ-
uals who responded “very strong” or “some-
what  strong”  as  having  high  community 
belonging. This question captures the social 
integration  aspect  of  social  well-being, 

Gender modality
Respondents were asked, “What was your 
sex  at  birth?”  Response  options  included 
“male”  and  “female.”  This  was  followed 
by  the  question,  “What  is  your  gender?” 
Response options included “male,” “female” 
and “please specify.” When responses for 
sex at birth and gender were the same, we 
coded  the  individual  as  cisgender;  when 

199

Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada Research, Policy and PracticeVol 44, N° 5, May 2024responses differed, we coded the individ-
ual as a gender minority.

Analysis

Using  Annual  Component  data,  we  esti-
mated mean life satisfaction and the per-
centage  of  high  SRMH,  happiness  and 
community  belonging  by  sexual  orienta-
tion (heterosexual or sexual minority) and 
gender  modality  (cisgender  or  gender 
minority).  We  also  obtained  overall  and 
sex-stratified estimates of these PMH out-
comes for specific sexual minority groups 
(i.e. gay/lesbian and bisexual/pansexual); 
we did not separately report on PMH out-
comes  among  those  who  identified  as 
having another sexual orientation beyond 
heterosexual,  gay/lesbian  or  bisexual/
pan sexual given the difficulty in interpret-
ing  findings  for  such  a  heterogeneous 
group.

We estimated the percentage of high psy-
chological  well-being  using  the  Rapid 
Response  data  for  individuals  by  sexual 
orientation (heterosexual or sexual minor-
ity).  We  also  obtained  overall  and  sex-
stratified  estimates  of  high  psychological 
well-being  for  specific  sexual  minority 
groups (i.e. gay/lesbian and bisexual/pan-
sexual).  The  estimate  of  psychological 
well-being  for  gender  minority  adults  is 
not reported because it was not releasable 
(i.e. coefficient of variation [CV] > 35).

To determine whether the above estimates 
were significantly different, we conducted 
logistic regression analyses for the dichot-
omized PMH outcomes and linear regres-
sion analyses for life satisfaction. We used 
dummy  coding  for  the  linear  regression 
analyses  so  that—similar  to  the  logistic 
regression analyses—“heterosexual adults” 
was the reference group in the sexual ori-
entation  analyses  and  “cisgender  adults” 
was  the  reference  group  in  the  gender 
identity  analyses.  We  interpreted  odds 
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs)  that  did  not  include  1.0  as  statisti-
cally  significant  in  the  logistic  regression 
analyses. We interpreted coefficients with 
95% CIs that did not include zero as sta-
tistically  significant  in  the  linear  regres-
sion analyses.

For  the  overall  comparisons  of  sexual 
minority adults to heterosexual adults, we 
also  statistically  controlled  for  a  number 
of sociodemographic characteristics in fol-
low-up logistic regression analyses for the 
dichotomized  PMH  outcomes  and  linear 

regression  analyses  for  life  satisfaction. 
Covariates included the individual’s sex at 
birth, age group, marital status (married/
common law, single/never married, divorced/ 
widowed/separated),  highest  educational 
attainment (high school or lower, postsec-
ondary),  racialized  background  (yes,  no) 
and household income quintile.

In  line  with  other  analyses,42-44  we  coded 
the age of adults into four groups: young 
adults  (18–34  years),  younger  middle-
aged  adults  (35–49  years),  older  middle-
aged adults (50–64 years) and older adults 
(65+  years).  We  grouped  marital  status 
and  highest  educational  attainment  into 
broad categories following previous analy-
ses45  and  given  the  size  of  the  sexual 
minority  groups.  There  were  minor  dis-
crepancies  in  how  we  coded  racialized 
background due to different derived vari-
ables  provided  by  Statistics  Canada  in 
each  dataset  at  the  time  of  analysis  (see 
the Table 1 notes for more information).

Household income data were obtained by 
Statistics Canada from linked tax records, 
imputations or self-reports. Consistent with 
recommendations  from  Statistics  Canada 
and given that income can have a nonlin-
ear association with PMH outcomes,46 we 
coded  the  household  income  values  into 
quintiles.  We  also  included  place  of  resi-
dence (population centre, rural area) as a 
covariate  in  the  analyses  except  for  the 
one  involving  psychological  well-being 
because it was not provided as a derived 
variable in the Rapid Response dataset by 
Statistics Canada. Population centres were 
defined  by  Statistics  Canada  as  continu-
ously  built-up  areas  with  populations  of 
1000+  and  densities  of  400+  per  km2. 
Due  to  small  sample  sizes,  we  do  not 
report  follow-up  logistic  or  linear  regres-
sion analyses that control for covariates in 
comparisons 
involving  specific  sexual 
minority groups or gender minority adults.

with  caution  due  to  high  sampling  vari-
ability;  estimates  with  CVs  above  35% 
(flagged with an “F”) are suppressed. Analy-
ses  were  conducted  in  SAS  Enterprise 
Guide  version  7.1  (SAS  Institute,  Cary, 
NC, USA).

Results

Based  on  the  Annual  Component  data, 
0.2%E of adults in the Canadian provinces 
in 2019 were a gender minority and 3.9% 
were a sexual minority, with 1.7% identi-
fying  as  gay/lesbian,  2.0%  as  bisexual/
pansexual  and  0.2%  as  another  sexual 
orientation (Table 1).

Sexual orientation and PMH

Sexual  minority  adults  reported  lower 
mean life satisfaction (B = −0.7, 95% CI: 
−0.8, −0.5) and were less likely to report 
high SRMH (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.5), 
high levels of happiness (OR = 0.4, 95% 
CI:  0.3,  0.5),  high  community  belonging 
(OR  =  0.6,  95%  CI:  0.5,  0.7)  and  high 
psychological well-being (OR = 0.4, 95% 
CI:  0.3,  0.6)  than  heterosexual  adults 
(Table  2).  These  differences  were  statisti-
cally  significant  even  after  controlling  for 
covariates.

Overall, gay/lesbian and bisexual/pansex-
ual  adults  reported  significantly  lower 
mean life satisfaction (B = −0.4, 95% CI: 
−0.6,  −0.2;  B  =  −0.9,  95%  CI:  −1.1, 
−0.7, respectively) and were significantly 
less likely to report high SRMH (OR = 0.7, 
95% CI: 0.5, 0.9; OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2, 
0.4, respectively), high levels of happiness 
(OR  =  0.6,  95%  CI:  0.4,  0.8;  OR  =  0.3, 
95% CI: 0.2, 0.4, respectively), high com-
munity  belonging  (OR  =  0.6,  95%  CI: 
0.5,  0.8;  OR  =  0.6,  95%  CI:  0.4,  0.7, 
respectively) and high psychological well-
being (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8E; OR = 
0.5,  95%  CI:  0.3,  0.7,  respectively)  than 
heterosexual adults (Table 3).

All  estimates  were  adjusted  using  sam-
pling weights provided by Statistics Canada 
and  variance  was  estimated  using  the 
bootstrap  resampling  method  with  1000 
replications.  The  sampling  weights  take 
into  account  non-response  during  the 
recruitment  phase  and  non-sharing  of 
data  with  PHAC  and  Health  Canada  by 
respondents.  We  dealt  with  missing  data 
by  using  pairwise  deletion  to  maximize 
the  sample  size  for  each  analysis.  Esti-
mates  with  CVs  between  15%  and  35% 
(flagged with an “E”) should be interpreted 

Significant  differences  across  those  five 
PMH  outcomes  were  observed  for  both 
bisexual  males  and  bisexual  females  in 
the sex-stratified analyses. Gay males were 
significantly  less  likely  than  heterosexual 
males  to  report  high  SRMH  (OR  =  0.7, 
95% CI: 0.5, 0.9) and community belong-

a Percentages were weighted to be representative of the target population.

b  There  were  minor  discrepancies  in  how  we  coded  racialized  background  due  to  different  derived  variables  provided  by 
Statistics Canada in each dataset at the time of analysis. For the Rapid Response, we coded the non-racialized group as just 
including non-Indigenous individuals who only identified as White; if an individual identified as Indigenous or indicated any 
other background besides or in addition to White then we coded them as having a racialized background. For the Annual 
Component, the non-racialized group more broadly included all non-Indigenous non-visible minorities; if an individual iden-
tified as Indigenous or could be classified as a visible minority then we coded them as having a racialized background.

c Estimates for place of residence are not reported for the 2019 CCHS Rapid Response on PMH as Statistics Canada did not 
include a relevant derived variable in that dataset.

d  These  estimates  are  not  reported  because  they  could  be  used  with  the  reported  estimate  to  calculate  the  suppressed 
estimate.

Discussion

This  study  documents  the  PMH  of  SGM 
adults across numerous outcomes in Canada 
in  2019,  and  investigates  disparities  in 
these PMH outcomes compared to hetero-
sexual  and  cisgender  adults.  Overall, 
inequalities in PMH were common. Sexual 
minority  adults  reported  lower  mean  life 
satisfaction  and  were  less  likely  to  report 
high SRMH, high levels of happiness, high 
community  belonging  and  high  psycho-
logical well-being compared to heterosex-
ual  adults.  Similarly,  gender  minority 
adults  had  lower  odds  of  reporting  high 
SRMH  and  high  levels  of  happiness,  and 
tended  to  be  less  satisfied  with  life  than 
cisgender adults.

individuals 

These  inequalities  tended  to  be  relatively 
large in magnitude when compared to dis-
parities  in  PMH  outcomes  previously 
observed 
for  other  sociodemographic 
characteristics.45 For instance, the percent-
age difference in high SRMH was 21.4 for 
sexual  minority  (vs.  heterosexual)  indi-
viduals and 36.0E for gender minority (vs. 
the  current 
cisgender) 
study,  while  the  percentage  difference  in 
high  SRMH  did  not  exceed  14.1  in  2019 
for  comparisons  by  age  group,  racialized 
group membership, immigrant status, house-
hold  income,  place  of  residence,  educa-
tional  attainment,  parental  status,  living 
alone,  marital  status,  official  language 
minority  or  Indigenous  identity  in  previ-
ous analyses.45 Moreover, the difference in 
mean  life  satisfaction  was  0.7  for  sexual 
minority  (vs.  heterosexual)  individuals 
and  1.7  for  gender  minority  (vs.  cisgen-
der)  individuals  in  the  current  study, 
while  the  highest  mean  difference  in  all

Notes: All estimates were weighted. Analyses involving high psychological well-being used data from the 2019 CCHS Rapid Response on PMH, while analyses involving all other PMH out-
comes used data from the 2019 CCHS Annual Component. Adjusted regression analyses included sex, age group, highest education level, racialized background, household income quintile 
and marital status as covariates. Place of residence was also included as a covariate except for the analysis involving high psychological well-being. Due to varying rates of missing data, the 
sample size ranged from 52 929 to 54 280 for the Annual Component analyses and from 10 393 to 10 531 for the Rapid Response analyses. Odds ratios that are bolded have confidence inter-

the  sociodemographic  comparisons  listed 
above  was  0.6  in  2019.45  The  especially 
sizable inequalities in PMH in SGM popu-
lations identify a high priority for mental 
health  promotion  activities,  as  well  as 
other  interventions  aimed  at  addressing 
potential determinants of PMH.47,48

Beyond these overall inequalities, it is also 
important to acknowledge the heterogene-
ity that exists within SGM groups. Although 
PMH  tended  to  be  less  prevalent  among 
SGM individuals compared to heterosexual 
and cisgender individuals, there were still 
large  portions  of  SGM  individuals  who 
reported high levels of PMH. For example, 
high  community  belonging  was  reported 
by the majority of gay, lesbian, bisexual/
pansexual and gender minority individuals. 
Investigations  into  risk  and  protective 

factors  that  distinguish  SGM  individuals 
who report high PMH from those who do 
not could be important for understanding 
and promoting individual and community 
resil ience  in  these  populations.49  For 
instance,  greater  self-compassion  appears 
to  be  a  protective  factor  as  it  has  been 
linked  to  lower  minority  stress  and  better 
well-being  among  SGM  populations.50  In 
contrast, SGM people in Canada are more 
likely to report experiencing violent victim-
ization,51  which  is  a  risk  factor  of  lower 
PMH;31-33  safer  and  more  2SLGBTQ+ 
friendly communities are likely an impor-
tant  social  determinant  for  these  popula-
tions  and  a  potential  target  for  more 
systemic-level interventions.47

There were differences in the consistency 
by  which  inequalities  in  PMH  outcomes 

were observed in this study, with dispari-
ties  between  bisexual/pansexual  versus 
heterosexual adults being the most robust. 
This is in line with previous research find-
ings that the risk of negative psychological 
outcomes  is  often  highest  for  bisexual 
individuals  compared  to  heterosexual  or 
gay/lesbian  individuals.6,8,10,11,52  The  dis-
tinctive  prejudice  and  discrimination  that 
can be experienced by bisexual people has 
been  offered  as  an  explanation  for  their 
heightened  risk,  including  the  negative 
societal  attitudes  about  bisexuality,  the 
invisibility and erasure of bisexual people 
in  wider  society,  and  the  lack  of  affirma-
tive  support  for  bisexual  individuals.52 
Indeed, a recent environmental scan only 
found  one  program  in  Canada  that  was 
exclusively  dedicated  to  addressing  the

research could explore risk and protective 
factors of PMH for gender minority people.

Disparities  in  PMH  also  tended  to  be 
prominent  for  gender  minority  adults. 
Beyond community belonging, only around 
one-third of gender minority adults reported 
high SRMH and high levels of happiness, 
and  they  rated  their  life  satisfaction  1.7 
points lower, on average, than did cisgen-
der  individuals.  These  findings  expand 
previous  research  on  the  prevalence  of 
negative  psychological  outcomes  in  the 
transgender population.7,11 Reducing distal 
stressors (i.e. being the target of transpho-
bic  behaviours)  and  proximal  stressors 
(i.e.  expectations  of  rejection  or  discrimi-
nation,  transgender  identity  concealment 
and  internalized  transphobia)  could  be 
important for mental health promotion, as 
these  experiences  have  been  associated 
with  depression  and  suicidal  ideation 
among gender minority individuals.19 Future 

Strengths and limitations

By  using  data  from  large  population 
health  surveys,  we  were  able  to  investi-
gate  numerous  PMH  outcomes  in  the 
overall SGM populations as well as in spe-
cific  sexual  minority  groups.  The  exami-
nation  of  PMH  among  gender  minority 
individuals is an especially important con-
tribution  as  the  inclusion  of  questions 
asking  about  both  sex  and  gender  is  a 
recent  development  in  Statistics  Canada 
surveys.  In  addition,  our  strengths-based 
focus  on  PMH  allowed  us  to  document 
that—despite  population  disparities—many 
SGM individuals report experiencing well-
being in their lives.

Nevertheless,  there  are  limitations  that 
warrant mention. First, we identified many 
disparities  in  PMH  and  offered  potential 

204

explanations  for  the  results  based  on 
minority  stress 
theory  and  previous 
research, but we did not directly examine 
why the disparities exist. The inequalities 
across  the  PMH  outcomes  persisted  for 
sexual  minority  adults  compared  to  het-
erosexual  adults  when  we  statistically 
controlled  for  various  sociodemographic 
characteristics;  however,  distinct  groups 
were broadly coded into one category for 
some  of  the  covariates  and  only  unad-
justed  regression  analyses  for  PMH  out-
comes  were  reported  for  comparisons 
involving  specific  sexual  minority  groups 
and  gender  minority  adults  due  to  small 
sample sizes. The small sample sizes also 
resulted  in  some  relatively  wide  CIs  and 
likely  affected  the  statistical  power  to 
detect significant differences. In addition, 
the  small  number  of  gender  minority 
adults in the dataset restricted our ability 
to examine specific gender identities (e.g. 
transgender  men,  transgender  women, 
nonbinary individuals). The oversampling 
of  SGM  individuals  in  future  population 
health surveys could allow for more com-
prehensive  examinations  of  specific  SGM 
identities, as well as the disaggregation of 
results  by  other  potentially  important 
sociodemographic  factors.53  For  instance, 
age  breakdowns  could  be  informative; 
experiences of discrimination and dispari-
ties  in  mental  health  have  been  found  to 
vary  across  the  life  course  among  sexual 
minority individuals in other countries.54,55

Self-reported  responses  to  questionnaires 
may  be  subject  to  recall  bias  and  social 
desirability  bias.56  Further,  the  unwilling-
ness of some respondents to disclose their 
sexual  orientation  or  gender  modality 
could have resulted in some misclassifica-
tion.57  While  respondents  were  asked  to 
report  on  their  sexual  identity,  there  are 
other important dimensions of sexual ori-
entation  that  could  have  been  assessed 
(i.e.  sexual  attraction  and  sexual  behav-
iour).53,58  Moreover,  the  survey  question 
on  gender  included  “male”  and  “female” 
as  response  options  instead  of  the  more 
relevant  “man”  and  “woman.”59  Finally, 
we may be missing data from the most at-
risk  SGM  individuals  (e.g.  those  who  are 
experiencing homelessness).60

Conclusion

We  found  that  PMH  tended  to  be  less 
common  among  SGM  adults  than  among 
heterosexual and cisgender adults in 2019. 
Future research could explore the mecha-
nisms  by  which  SGM  people  experience

PMH  in  SGM  populations,  how  PMH 
might depend on the interaction between 
sexual  orientation  and  gender  modality 
with  other  sociodemographic  characteris-
tics,  and  how  the  observed  disparities  in 
PMH may have changed over time.
