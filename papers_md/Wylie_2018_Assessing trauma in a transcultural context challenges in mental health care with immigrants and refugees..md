Abstract

The growing numbers of refugees and immigrants from conflict-prone areas settling
throughout the world bring several challenges for those working in the mental
health care system. Immigrants and refugees of all ages arrive with complex and
nuanced mental health histories of war, torture, and strenuous migration journeys.
Many of the challenges of addressing the health care needs for this growing
population of immigrants and refugees are often unfamiliar, and thus practices to
address these challenges are not yet routine for care providers and health care
organizations. In particular, complex trauma can make mental health assessments
difficult for health care organizations or care providers with limited experience and
training in transcultural or trauma-informed care. Using a transcultural approach can
improve assessment and screening processes, leading to more effective and
high-quality care for immigrant and refugee families experiencing mental health
disorders.
This paper presents findings from an assessment of current mental health
services focusing on current practices and experiences with immigrant and
refugee patients and families. The difficulties in developing shared
understandings about mental health can hinder the therapeutic process;
therefore, it is imperative to ensure an effective assessment right from the
beginning, yet there is limited use of existing cultural formulation tools from the
DSM-IV or DSM-5. The paper outlines current practices, approaches, challenges,
and recommendations shared by mental health care providers and program
leaders in addressing the mental health care needs of immigrants and refugees.
The results from this study demonstrate that there are many challenges and
inconsistencies in providing transcultural, trauma-informed care. Respondents
emphasized the need for a thorough yet flexible and adaptive approach that
allows for an exploration of differences in cultural interpretations of mental
health. Our study concluded that ensuring a mindful, reflexive, transcultural, and
trauma-informed health care workforce, and a learning environment to support
staff with education, resources, and tools will improve the health care
experiences of immigrants and refugees in the mental health care system.

Introduction
The growing numbers of refugees and immigrants from conflict-prone areas settling
throughout the world bring several challenges for those working in the mental health
care system. The high prevalence of stressful and traumatic experiences facing entire
families lead to mental health issues that are different than what health care providers
in countries not affected by war are accustomed to seeing [1, 2]. High numbers of im-
migrants and refugees of all ages have complex and multilayered mental health narra-
tives, experiences of war, torture, and potentially traumatic migration journeys [3, 4].
As Vukčević et al. assert, “In order to ensure adequate psychological support [for refu-
gees and asylum seekers], it is necessary to be aware of their traumatic experiences and
the hardships they are dealing with” [2]. Mental health care providers need skills in
trauma-informed care to meet the needs of people migrating from war-torn areas.

Assessment tools, such as the cultural formulation in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders IV, or DSM-IV [5], provides an important foundation for
the “evaluation of socio-cultural context of illness” [6], to assess this socio-cultural con-
text of war and trauma. Despite the existence of practice guidelines for transcultural
care, such as those outlined in the DSM-IV cultural formulation and in the DSM-5 [7],
this assessment tool is underutilized in clinical settings [6, 8, 9] with care providers ex-
pressing concern with the time burden of such an assessment process [10]. This article
discusses the challenges that mental health care providers working in London Ontario
face with mental health assessments and care with immigrant and refugee patients. It
identifies some of the barriers to using evidence-based models of care and provides rec-
ommendations from health care providers on how to support them to gain these
practice-based skills.

Background
A lack of transcultural care is only one of a range of access barriers in mental health
care that lead to the underutilization of mental health services by immigrants and refu-
gees [11], and these barriers exist both at the individual and system levels [12]. Barriers
on the patient side include “a lack of knowledge of available services, difficulties with
language and communications, and stigma associated with mental health problems and
the use of services” [13]. Barriers from within the health care system include the limited
transcultural knowledge, skills, and practices among care providers, as well as systemic
time constraints that undermine the ability to carry out a fulsome sociocultural
assessment. Complex trauma, such as that resulting from war, displacement and re-
settlement, can make mental health assessments difficult for health care organizations
or care providers with limited experience and training in trauma-informed care, leading
to misunderstandings [14, 15]. Using a transcultural approach, where practices are in-
formed by this more thorough sociocultural assessment, can improve assessment and
screening processes, leading to more effective and culturally appropriate care plans for
immigrant and refugee families experiencing mental health disorders [16].

The recent diasporas of immigrants and refugees from war-torn areas relocating
around the globe are changing demographics in profound ways. The Syrian conflict
starting in 2011 has resulted in the world’s largest refugee crisis in the twenty-first cen-
tury, resulting in 4.9 million Syrians registered as refugees by the end of 2016 [17].
From 2011 to 2016, a reported 29,945 Syrian refugees immigrated to Canada, with

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22

1235 of these Syrian refugees migrating to London, Ontario, census metropolitan area
(CMA). Immigrants born in India were the second largest group of recent arrivals to
settle in London (CMA) with 1000 people. This influx influenced the 16% (47,955) to
20% (78,330) shift to London’s self-claimed visible minority population from 2011 to
2016 respectively. The largest increases are in the Arab and South Asian population,
with an increase from 7715 to 13,735 (56% increase) and 6270 to 12,090 (51% increase)
respectively. Between 2011 and 2016, 11,955 immigrants arrived in London, Ontario,
resulting in a total 83,770 immigrants living in the city by the end of 2016 [18]. The
people who live in London that neither speak English nor French increased from 4923
to 6320 from 2006 to 2016 [18, 19]. Patient profiles reflect the growth in the immigrant
and non-English speakers in the city, including the increase in refugees of war. High
levels of trauma and migration stresses among recently arrived war refugees [20] have
profound significance in mental health care, where services generally are poorly
equipped to meet the complex mental health needs of survivors of war and torture
[11]. Many of the challenges of addressing the health care needs for this growing popu-
lation of immigrants and refugees are therefore new and unfamiliar to care providers
and health care organizations.

In the context of a global diaspora of war refugees, complex trauma poses several
challenges to the provision of mental health services in many countries [16]. In a study
on refugees and internally displaced people, Yeoman and Forman note that “PTSD may
be an overly narrow characterization of traumatic stress across these different cultures”
emphasizing instead experiences of “somatization, anxiety, and depression” [21].
Lewis-Fernandez have similarly noted the importance of understanding sociocultural
contexts, which shape the way trauma is experienced and expressed [6]. Vukčević et al.
reinforce this point, noting that “We should reconsider our familiar models of psycho-
therapy in order to accommodate the possibly different meanings of mental health,
trauma, and support in the refugees’ cultural context” [2]. The difficulties in developing
shared understandings about mental health can hinder the therapeutic process and in-
fluence assessment outcomes. Sundvall et al. emphasize that “there could be differences
in the assessment of the patient based on the clinician’s assumptions and understanding
of cultural factors” [14].

Such challenges highlight the importance of ensuring effective assessments are con-
ducted at the first stages of an individual’s care journey. For health professionals who
are ill equipped or inexperienced in providing care for culturally complex patients,
modifying assessment processes in the context of complex structural and organizational
processes are quite challenging. At the same time, the need to support immigrant and
refugee families through the complexities of mental illness demands that innovative ap-
proaches and improved standards for transcultural and trauma-informed mental health
care are put in place. This paper explores the challenges and recommendations to im-
prove assessment protocols to meet the mental health needs of vulnerable immigrant
and refugee populations with trauma histories.

Community forums were held to identify the challenges experienced by immigrants
and refugees in mental health services in London, Ontario. These forums brought to-
gether people from across community and health care settings, including representa-
tion from immigrant
settlement organizations, community services, educational
institutions, community mental health groups, hospital representatives, and people with

lived experience. An advisory committee was established with over 30 representatives
from community stakeholders and organizations involved in immigrant and refugee
services from both community and hospital mental health services, public health, social
services, child welfare, settlement, education sectors, and additional members with
lived experience. This committee regularly provided feedback on the research findings
and practice recommendations for transcultural mental health care.

A range of gaps in access to culturally appropriate mental health services that meet
the needs of immigrant and refugee communities in the London and Middlesex area of
Southwestern Ontario were identified. Problems such as long waiting times, unavail-
ability of interpreters, lack of trauma-informed care, and poor coordination between
hospital and community-based services were some of the key issues that impeded the
provision of effective, coordinated, and integrated mental health care. In 2013, a quality
improvement process was initiated by an academic health sciences center in London,
Ontario, to improve the mental health outcomes of immigrant and refugee children
and families, through service changes in the hospital as well as enhancing collaboration
between health and social service providers in community-based settings. To identify
broader strategies for system improvement, exploring skills and gaps among health care
providers was an important first step. This paper presents findings from a baseline as-
sessment to gauge the current practices and experiences in providing mental health ser-
vices to immigrant and refugee communities. The study captured a range of
experiences among mental health care staff, aimed at understanding the current chal-
lenges and promising strategies of providing trauma-informed and culturally appropri-
ate mental health care for immigrants and refugees,
from assessments through
treatment and recovery.

Methods
A baseline assessment of mental health services for immigrants and refugees in
London, Ontario, was completed in 2015. The study included semi-structured inter-
views and focus groups with health care providers and managers working within the
continuum of mental health services both in the hospital system and hospital-affiliated
community care settings. Respondents were asked about their experiences working
with immigrant and refugee patients and families in mental health care. Questions in-
cluded details around knowledge, skills, protocols, practices, education, and partner-
ships with community-based services. The purpose of the interviews was to develop a
baseline of current attitudes, knowledge, and skills around culturally sensitive and com-
petent practice within mental health and emergency care and to identify some of the
main challenges that care providers were facing in transcultural mental health care
contexts.

Approval for the study was received by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board of
Western University, and the ethics board of the Lawson Health Research Institute, en-
suring adherence to the guidelines of the Tri-Agency Framework on Responsible Con-
duct of Research. Through a process of stratified purposeful sampling to assess
experiences in providing transcultural mental health care, our respondents included
mental health and emergency department physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, resi-
dents, nurses, social workers, child and family therapists, employment and life skills
counselors, occupational therapists, support staff, and organizational and program

leaders within mental health. A total of 26 qualitative interviews and three focus groups
were completed totaling 40 participants. The interviews examined both positive and
negative experiences with immigrant and refugee patients; knowledge and training re-
garding protocols and services; and recommendations on ways to improve mental
health services for immigrant and refugee patients.

Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded in
to identify thematic nodes and
NVivo, using a grounded theory approach [22]
sub-nodes based on the participant transcripts. There were 15 distinct nodes related to
assessments, ranging from the type of assessment tools, to the challenges of the assess-
ment process with this population. This paper presents and discusses the key findings
from the themes around assessment practices, culminating in recommendations for im-
proved practice based on standards such as the DSM cultural formulations, combined
with local perspectives on strategies for advancing transcultural, trauma-informed men-
tal health care.

Results
The results from this study demonstrate that standards of practice for transcultural
care are not in place across mental health services in London, Ontario, despite the
existence of evidence-based recommendations in the DSM-5. This section outlines
current practices, approaches, challenges, and recommendations shared by mental
health care providers and program leaders in addressing the mental health care
needs of immigrants and refugees.

The inconsistency of current practices for transcultural assessment
Respondents shared that there was no common process guiding transcultural as-
sessments in mental health. Although the DSM-5 provides a valuable framework
for explaining cultural factors in the presentation of mental illness, there are finan-
cial, bureaucratic, ideological, and political barriers to making meaningful changes
including implementing best practice guidelines across a large hospital. Health pro-
viders’ knowledge and practice skills in transcultural care vary widely. Patients also
have varied pathways into mental health care, including the emergency department,
direct admission, and referrals from doctors or community agencies; different as-
sessments are carried out that provide different information. As one occupational
therapist explained, regardless of how a patient accesses mental health services,
background patient information is

Not always sent with the referral. I mean, if they come out of emerg [the Emergency
Department] you don’t get everything. They’re going to focus on immediate crisis
and what have you. Resources in the community might have their own information,
but that’s not necessarily in a hospital chart. If the referral comes from there,
hopefully there would be some appropriate information that would get sent about
the client. That’s, I think, an area that can be really problematic. Often I get clients
that come in and there’s very little information available (HC10).

One of the reasons that there is often limited information on both the health and social
history and beliefs of immigrant or refugee clients is that there are no expectations that

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22

providers use the DSM-5 in their assessments. Care providers select their assessment
process, and many are uncomfortable and unsure of what to ask immigrant and refugee
patients. As one social worker noted,A barrier is people’s fear of being curious around

other people’s belief systems, right and not knowing how to ask those questions
because of their own kind of discomfort with it…people are uncomfortable asking
the questions or even asking people if they identify with a particular culture…What
is your faith?…Just even getting to that comfortable level of asking that question
(HC5).

This discomfort can prevent important issues being explored with clients, especially
when they have a different linguistic, cultural, or religious background than the care
provider.

Respondents noted that there was no mandated cross-cultural assessment tool across
mental health services. Few are familiar with the section on cultural psychiatry in
DSM-5 and the cultural formulation in the DSM-IV, and those who are, felt they
needed to collect more detail for a robust transcultural assessment. There are gaps in
the collection of linguistic or cultural information concerning patients from the emer-
gency department: “There’s not even a little section to ask about do you think there are
any cultural or ethnically relevant aspects to this patient that are worthy to note”
(HC11). Such information in referrals could help providers prepare for the appointment
by booking an interpreter or arranging for religious accommodation. The lack of cul-
turally specific assessment tools was emphasized by a mental health clinician: “Our tool
is what it is; there’s nothing built into that tool to allow for differences; cultural, the
language or religious or dietary differences. Nothing” (FG1).

A reason there is no consistently used transcultural assessment tool in mental health
was attributed to the difficulties in applying the DSM objectively across all situations.
As one psychiatrist stated,

Even if you look at the evolution of DSM, it’s still a very – I mean, the first thing to
remember is that psychiatric illnesses are real, but the ways we understand them are
completely made up. It’s a bunch of people sitting around a table and these are the
criteria to call it schizophrenia. It’s very arbitrary and it is very western based…We
have to remember that unlike other areas of medicine that have more objective
measures, in psychiatry diagnosis and symptomatology is very arbitrary and it’s a
western construct (HC11).

Some providers include cultural and language assessments, but in general, these are
used inconsistently and lack comprehensiveness. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening tool available in many languages; however, it
lacks a transcultural approach. The Breslau screening tool that uses seven questions to
assess PTSD was also mentioned, but it was not widely used (HC10). The O-CAN (On-
tario Common Assessment of Need) was seen as too simplistic: “the last question is: is
cultural issues a part of your life, and the answer is yes or no…And the previous ques-
tion is: is religion an integral part of your life, yes or no?” (FG1). Participants noted that
these yes or no questions from the O-CAN would not elicit the information needed to
inform a culturally appropriate response. Further, it was noted that the appropriate

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 7 of 19

timing of questions should be taken into consideration. One respondent noted,the
client’s past may be such a traumatic experience and they may be so psychotic at the
time, that you’re not really going to get maybe the correct or accurate information
because it may be tied up with their psychosis. And it may be so traumatic
sometimes that bringing that up right now is counterproductive. (FG1).

If patients are in crisis when they meet the provider, questions about trauma may not
be productive until the patient is more stable or a relationship of trust has been devel-
oped with the care provider.

The lack of standardized assessments for transcultural mental health leads care pro-
viders to adapt practices on an ad hoc basis. For some this meant doing a shorter
screening at triage, a brief cognitive assessment (with an interpreter if needed), and de-
termining the religious requirements for either a male or female health care worker
(HL1). One respondent noted the need to tailor the assessment based on cues from the
family, such as delaying questions around sexuality until they had established trust
(HL2). The complexity of assessments with an interpreter also requires adaptation and
adds the potential for misunderstanding. Many respondents spoke of the importance of
training for working with interpreters, although this training was not available to them.
As one program manager in mental health care explained,

So you know, in the emerg [Emergency Department], where I think they use them
[interpreters] quite frequently, you learn by doing and you learn from a more
experienced nurse or whatever. I think it should fan out across the organization
where it might be used less. It’s probably more challenging. There wouldn’t be any
formal training that I’m aware of, no. (HL4)

The level of skills of the care provider and the interpreter, as well as how they work to-
gether can affect the entire assessment process. Despite an overall dearth in training
and formal processes for transcultural assessments, decision-makers and providers rely
on their own knowledge, skills, and intuition, with many emphasizing a generic patient-
centered care approach.

The desire for a narrative approach
All respondents highlighted the need for a more encompassing approach to transcul-
tural assessments. One social worker stated the need for “acquiring kind of thick de-
scriptions of people’s lives, thick understanding of what’s going [on] – what their
history is” (HC5). Knowing the patient story, such as past traumatic experiences, was
necessary to support effective care, as the provider would better understand the basis
of the clients’ mental health state. Provider wanted details not only about their past,
but also about what they are currently dealing with, such as a family break-up or re-
settlement difficulties. As a physician leader in the emergency department explained,

To start with there’s usually a complex history, because most people who have an
easy history don’t have many mental health issues, some do, but most don’t, right. So
there are some complex issues … Then if you layer on top of that the fact that
they’re…not English speaking as a primary language and you layer on that the fact

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 8 of 19

that they’re immigrant and then you layer on the fact that…they’re refugees, the
complexity of that piece of pie is really hard and you know…there’s gonna be lots of
things potentially missed (HL3).

A nurse case manager noted that through exploring personal histories of immigrants
or refugees accessing mental health services:We get a really thorough psycho-social his-
tory on the person. It’s really, really important that we know where is that person
from, what were the events of their life like. In particular, it’s important to focus [on
the ages] between…13 and 30; those are really significant, those are our strongest
memories. And if that person lived through a war during that time that can be sig-
nificant. Or maybe they had really good things happening during that time and we
need to tap into that. But getting to know who the person is, is fundamental in our
care plans (HL1).

As one health care leader described “my approach to assessment is always I want to
have it as a narrative. Like, so put together a story… if they’re somebody from an immi-
grant or refugee population, obviously, that’s going to be a big part of the story, right?”
(HL7). Care providers noted that collecting the story allows them to get to know their
patients, their roots, their work experience, their cultural practices, their religious be-
liefs, and their migration journey, including any potential traumatic experiences (HC10,
HC8, HL7). Knowing this type of information would allow for a patient-led approach
for the care plan, tailored to each client.

An occupational therapist emphasized the value in asking them how they view health
care, as “there is such a difference from culture to culture even in terms of how they
view it [the role of health care] and their needs” (HC10). Others noted the importance
of “trying to get an idea of what things were like in the life that they came from” (HL7)
and are asking immigrant families “what do you imagine your life looking like here?”
(HC8). Respondents noted the importance of getting background information by “doing
your homework…to understand the culture” (HC10). Participants emphasized the value
of getting information from the patient’s support network, but reinforced that the focus
should be on the patient’s current experience “to allow for their own description of
what it is that’s happening to them” (HC5).

Ensuring a comprehensive patient narrative is obtained can be a lengthy process:
“you’re looking for explanations in the current context, which has multiple new vari-
ables…the transition context, and then the pre-transition. And that’s then mapping on
pre-morbid, morbid and current mental health status…No wonder it takes nine hours”
(HC9). An in-depth history helps care providers understand a patient’s strengths and
challenges, but it can be triggering. The patient may be suppressing difficult memories,
“because sometimes again they want to hide that in a sense right, because it’s some-
thing that you know it’s personal to them and can cause memories to occur…But I
think it’s important to understand” (HL3). In addition, health care providers noted the
lack of time as a barrier to a full assessment.

Other care providers highlighted that dealing with historical traumas often has to be
postponed in order to focus on immediate needs and goals. “It may be around safety is-
sues, housing, making sure their children are safe and have food, and all those basics.
With any of my clients, if those basic needs aren’t met, you’re not going to be able to

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 9 of 19

do in-depth other work treatment with them” (HC10). Although many immigrants and
refugees may have deep traumas, they also have tangible immediate challenges in their
adjustment to life in Canada, navigating housing, school for their children, not knowing
where to get information they need to establish themselves (HC14). One emergency de-
partment physician was clear that the assessments for immigrants and refugees, espe-
cially those with limited English skills, needs to first focus on those basics:

To run through a screening checklist: Who’s at home? What are the resources
available to you? Who’s working? Who’s not working? Are there kids? Did you eat
today? What did you eat today? How are you eating? And all of those things as a
screening tool – for me, screening patients is sort of the first thing. Once I screen
them, you very quickly know who you need work on (HC17).

Appreciating cultural differences
Multiple providers emphasized that understandings of mental health are culturally em-
bedded, and that the way we label psychological disorders is culturally biased (HC11,
HC12). As one social worker explained: “with some cultures it would be easy to for in-
stance suggest that this person perhaps is experiencing some form of psychosis, when
in fact culturally that may be very acceptable to have that particular thinking or
thought process” (HC3). Another social worker also echoed this perspective:

I’m trying to be aware that there could be a very different understanding of the
situation than what I’m having and trying to really open the door and allow for that
understanding, to come out, right?…I might say they’re having some auditory
hallucinations, they’re whatever. But to them, ‘I’m hearing the spirits of my ancestors
speak to me.’ You know what I mean? So is that a negative thing to them? (HC5).

An additional respondent noted:Someone who is psychotic from one background

might look quite different than someone who is psychotic from a different
background. So if something doesn’t quite make sense and they don’t look quite the
way we expected them to, to remind yourself that maybe their particular unique
background might be contributing to why they look this particular way (HC11).

The assessment process itself can be a tool to explore cultural interpretations of men-

tal health. As one psychologist shared,

The assessment really is more on trying to get their understanding of those issues
because different cultures have different understandings of mental health issues.
Trying to get those to be appropriate...to bring in as much cultural relevance of that
therapy model in order to try and make it work (HC 12).

A psychiatrist reflected: “over the years I’ve become familiar with certain issues that
tend to crop up in certain cultures and certain patterns tend to repeat. So it’s more that
I just remind myself of that and if I see something that doesn’t quite fit, I see if I can
make sense of it looking at it through that lens” (HC 11). This perspective resonated in
the comments from a social worker:I don’t think there’s anything wrong with allowing

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 10 of 19

some of that knowledge to influence some of the questions that you’re asking, right?
I…have learned about, you know, culture in Iran…that might cue me to ask certain
questions, right? So I don’t think it’s a bad thing to ask to have some of that
knowledge or a little bit of understanding (HC5).

Acknowledging cultural difference is an important beginning for effective transcul-
tural care, yet it is important not to make assumptions based on these cultural differ-
ences. Instead, respondents recommend open-ended questions that allow the patient to
lead the discussion results in more accurate assessments (HC2). The level of accultur-
ation to Canadian society was a key factor in the ability to communicate and articulate
health needs (HL3, HC2). A health care leader shared the story of an immigrant girl
who initially presented for belly pain, but only years later could explain that she was be-
ing sexually abused:

She didn’t have the tools, the skill or the age ‘cause she was an immigrant, she spoke
very little English, was depending on an interpreter to tell me her issues, versus now
where she’s got six years of education, more, you know, more Canadianized for lack
of a better word, right? And a little bit more empowered and now could bring the
issue forward (HL3).

That somatic presentation was noted by some respondents as more common in women
and girls in some cultural groups (HC9).

Understanding the importance of cultural factors in experience and communication
of health concerns should not lead to assumptions about its relevance for everyone
from that cultural group. As a social worker stated, cultural education is important, but
interactions should be focused on exploration:

Just how to ask questions, not specifically that you have to be aware of every cultural
process. Because I find that I get to know a lot about my patients, about asking them
what their interpretation of their culture is. Because, again, it means different things
to different people. So it’s not that I feel I have to be well versed in everything. And I
admit fully when there’s something I don’t know, ‘I have no idea about that,’ ‘Can you
tell me what that is?’ ‘How does your family respond to it?’ (HC15).

Problems can arise when care providers bring culturally based assumptions to the as-
sessment, “maybe not necessarily in a negative way, and not meant to be malicious but
some of those ideas, that people have learned a little bit about a culture and come in
with some assumptions” (HC5). The best way to avoid misunderstandings is to take a
patient-led approach to interpreting cultural meaning, allowing patients and families to
guide the role of culture in their healing process.

Family-based approaches
Family-based care is a valuable approach for mental health treatments with immigrant
and refugee patients. Understanding the experiences that families have been through is
an important beginning for the mental health assessment. Pre-migration experiences
shape family norms and thus need to be understood by care providers. Community

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 11 of 19

service sector and resettlement agencies were identified as facilitators of understanding
the pre-migration experience:

I found it very helpful to have those other representatives from the community there
that were aware of the story and also kind of aware of mental health concerns in that
population. So they could say, ‘Okay, well you know when this family came this was
going on.’ And that was very helpful for us to know;…they could give us some more
kind of narrative around the experience with those family members (HC6).

A social worker noted the need to be aware of family perceptions about mental

health to effectively engage in patient care:

I might be looking for certain cues or flags that tell me what’s not working, right?
Like what, you know, what are some of the family dynamics that are going on here
that might be influencing the situation, being very curious about how people are
understanding this themselves,…how are they understanding themselves and this
experience. How’s the family experiencing this? Because I may look at a person and
think, oh this looks xyz to me, but the family might be sitting beside me going ‘my
child has been taken over by a demon.’ (HC5).

As a psychiatrist explained, “I like to have families involved with the care of patients.
I’m fairly comfortable having family meetings with people from different backgrounds,
and I can tell too they’re comfortable having these meetings” (HC11).

This family-centered approach includes being able to understand how care plans and
therapies impact the family. A social worker explained that it is possible to cause harm
even when one has the best of intentions:

We thought we were pretty progressive when we bought the anatomically black
dolly…But on a bigger scale, we had no sense of what that would be for a family that
comes with a paper bag worth of their worldly goods, and then walks into this rich,
toy, plastic, white, blonde, doll environment and she said to us, ‘now they’re going to
– they’re going to ask me to buy this.’ And that wasn’t at all our intent. But the
damage was done (HC9).

A social worker explained that sometimes the focus is on rebuilding family. A refugee
woman was devastated and depressed when her husband left her not long after moving
to Canada.I did the assessment [of her] family of origin. We - she was able to

reconnect with her cousin. And the cousin, who didn’t see her for 20 years,
somehow was at the time of her life that she was able to help, and that made - I got
a letter from her not long ago that made a big difference…It’s almost like rebuilding
an environment (HC4).

Through this reconnection, the patient was able to strengthen her wellness plan and
shifted her focus to one of hope for the future.

Other providers noted that many immigrant and refugee families experience trauma
that
from a
family-based approach that recognizes “it’s not just the child’s trauma. It’s the child’s

layered, and intergenerational. These realities benefit

is collective,

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 12 of 19

trauma plus the child’s experiences of the mom’s trauma. And then what - how they
got here. And what has happened here” (HC9). The family-based focus for mental
health was seen as crucial to both understanding the context of the patient’s life and
developing a plan to rebuild the family unit to process their collective trauma and fa-
cilitate resilience.

Challenges and complexity of trauma assessments
The experience of trauma is a significant challenge in many immigrant and refugee
families. A social worker spoke to this challenge, noting that families experience trauma
before, during, and after migration. Health care staff may recognize

some of the difficulties and adjustment to culture. But not necessarily the specifics of
how they are going about integrating into the [local] community and finding
connections here. And so I think we often go to those, you know, if we were to look
at everything through a trauma lens we often look for the big T traumas but we
don’t always look at the small t traumas, right? And there are all sorts of, like, little
difficulties when it comes to kind of integrating into the community that I think
we’re not necessarily aware of (HC6).

An emergency department physician noted that sometimes trauma goes unrecognized,
sharing that a patient “had already been screened by a student who hadn’t picked up
any of her previous trauma” (HC17).

Care providers spoke about the need to support patients to process their trauma, but

to approach this with caution:

There’s some danger in that too, in a setting like an emergency department, right. If
somebody’s presenting and they’ve, you know experienced something really horrible
in their life, is the emerge [Emergency Department] the appropriate place to open all
of that up with them? Not necessarily, right. So, to try and get an understanding of
what some of that history is in a way that’s safe for them because if we’re not
keeping them, then we’re sending them back out into the world and we just opened
up the Pandora’s box of things that have happened to them in their life, right? So
trying to understand, get some understanding of their experience. As well, also doing
it in a way that’s safe for them and isn’t going to put them at greater risk than they
may have presented with, right? (HC5).

Providing refugee patients appropriate opportunities to tell their trauma story was seen
as key to the healing process, as long as it is approached carefully. As one psychiatrist
explained:We sat down with her and just part of my routine screening is to open the
door, and say ‘sometimes people experience trauma. If you’ve experienced trauma
and want to talk about it, I’m here.’ Just open the door, very, very non-
confrontational and she just sort of poured her heart out. And I think the term I
usually give it is life retelling, I think that’s the formal term for it. And told me about
how she was a young girl and witnessed – she was quite young at the time, like 17
or 18 – and she’d witnessed her father and mother slaughtered in front of her…I was
definitely the first doctor she had seen in a very long time, if not ever. And I don’t

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 13 of 19

know that anybody had actually opened that door for her, I don’t know. I don’t think
her trauma ended, possibly, until that day. Like the actual trauma, I think maybe that
day was the first day of her healing (HC17).

Care providers need to be able to share clinically relevant information from these pa-
tient trauma stories with the care team, so the patient does not need to keep retelling
their traumatic history. In this coordinated approach, the doctor deferred trauma
screening to other members of the team, “and then feels very comfortable saying, ‘I’m
not going to ask you to tell me the story, but I know something bad has happened to
you and I’m going to ask you a bunch of other questions that relate to that without
talking specifically about that’” (HC9).

The complexity of trauma among refugee populations demonstrates the value of an

interdisciplinary team approach, as one psychiatrist asserted:

There isn’t one person that can - that can do it all. They’re – it’s complex. Usually
the patients present with that profile usually have a traumatic background, it
complicates things…We’ve constantly talked as a team, you know, do they really
need to come and tell their story 50 times? Like, we – we need to find some way to
streamline it, to just get the treatment started instead of, you know, seeing different
– different people. So I really see, you know, a specific…trauma team that has the
cultural sensitivity, but also has the interdisciplinary part. (HC13)

Through recognizing these complex challenges, respondents identified the need for a
trauma-informed coordinated team-based model of care.

Recommendations from respondents
Overall, respondents found assessments with immigrant and refugee populations chal-
lenging for multiple reasons, such as the need to work with interpreters, different per-
ceptions of mental health, complex trauma, and the lack of time for completing the
interview, which takes longer in these situations. In addition to through adopting a flex-
ible, family-centered approach where assessments included rich descriptions, partici-
pants highlighted the need for a standardized mental health assessment process for
immigrant and refugee patients in mental health. They also noted that assessments
could only be effective if an interpreter is available. Respondents from a focus group
asserted: “if we did have some systems in place to assess people better and to get a bet-
ter understanding of where their needs lie and what the huge cultural differences are
through a basic screening process with an interpreter, that would really help” (FG1).
The respondents emphasized the need for a process or tool that integrates the inter-
preter and ensures that care providers are trained in using interpreters.

A consistent approach would reduce unnecessary variation and ensure that im-
portant things do not get missed, either due to care providers’ uncertainty, discom-
fort, or lack of knowledge. The assessment tool could allow staff autonomy and
judgment, while providing support for the specific challenges of immigrants and
refugees. Standardizing assessments would help staff who might not have the train-
ing and experience (FG1), and overall would improve the quality of care for immi-
grant and refugee patients (HC2).

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 14 of 19

There was an equally strong consensus around the need to be flexible and adaptive.
Care providers need to be attuned to potential trauma triggers, and to ensure that the
patient feels ready and safe with the providers and the environment. As a nurse leader
noted about hospital-based care:

This is a very busy area, a very active, you know, environment for them to come
into. Whether there be may be a separate area that is, you know, less stimulus, more
isolated…They feel that if they are going to come into hospital to be assessed that
they would feel more comfortable without the loud overheads going off and
[security]…doing their rounds through there randomly and setting off a lot of the
PTSD stuff (HL1).

staff

Another important recommendation focused on building the knowledge and capacity
of health care
and
organizational capacity also emphasized the value of training in trauma and transcul-
tural informed models of care, interpretation use, and practical forms of interactive
education (HC8, HC6, HC2).

Improving provider knowledge

and organizations.

A mental health care leader emphasized the importance of a flexible patient-centered
approach for improving assessment processes for transcultural, trauma-informed care
with immigrants and refugees:

I guess it’s really about how do we individualise the care plan to this individual and
say okay, we’re all focused on healing this person, how are we going to make this
work? Because we don’t want staff to say cookie cutter, oh, this worked for that last
patient from Somalia, so it’s going to work for this patient, it’s going to work for this
patient. Like it’s not going to work that way…I know our community partners have
said, you know, this is about learning the questions to ask, not just making
assumptions, as you say, but having an awareness that there are ways to get at that
information… I call it being culturally curious, you know, not being afraid to ask.
Not putting your foot in your mouth either, but you know, being curious enough just
to ask a respectful question about how is the best way for me to work with you?...I
see it as just being patient-centred (HL8).

Discussion
Our study has demonstrated many complex issues to consider in the assessment of
mental health disorders in immigrant and refugee families. Although current practices
are inconsistent, respondents emphasized the need for a thorough yet flexible and
adaptive approach that explores differences in cultural interpretations of mental health.
The DSM-IV and DSM-5 provide guidance for practitioners, but their focus on diagno-
ses, while important for psychiatry, may not provide relevant information for providers
in other areas of mental health who do not diagnose, nor have the time for the cultural
formulation assessment. Questions within the DSM documents can provide valuable
guidance, but it does not fit all clinical settings or needs. The DSM-IV and DSM-5
could be used to guide the creation of unit-specific assessments that fit the goals of
those clinicians and clients. As Alacrón has argued, “very few academic or training

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 15 of 19

centers, mainly in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, faced up to the tasks of exploring the
feasibility, usefulness and practical applicability” of the outline for a cultural formula-
tion of the DSM-IV [23]. To ensure a high level of competency and responsiveness to
cultural difference, health care providers need supports and tools to increase their com-
fort in having these difficult conversations [15, 24]. This includes training in the use of
the cultural formulation, as well as time allotted to carry it [10].

Care providers seem unaware of the materials they can access to increase their skills
in transcultural care. As argued by Hebebrand et al., “practitioners may enhance their
cultural competence through relevant knowledge accessible through refugee-specific
websites” [25]. In order to ensure care providers do this preparatory work, organiza-
tions should provide continuing professional development opportunities in transcul-
tural skills. It is possible to improve the comfort of health care workers to engage in
difficult conversations in a culturally competent and responsive manner, through edu-
cation and resources. Unfortunately, research has shown that staff working in a hospital
setting are often not able to get professional development time to participate in such
training [12]. Ferrari et al. note that patients also need to be provided with concrete
recommendations and resources to support their mental health [13].

Improved access to and use of transcultural assessment tools would be valuable in
the context of immigrant and refugee mental health care. Understanding the issues that
shape their mental health could improve the appropriateness of the approaches used.
Knowing the potentials of re-triggering trauma would ensure that care providers are
more sensitive to these issues when taking a narrative history. Indeed, research on cul-
tural formulation by Kirmayer et al. note “the prevalence of dissociative and somato-
form symptoms,
leading to misdiagnoses of psychosis, personality disorder, or
malingering” [26]. Transcultural trauma assessments are more time consuming and
need to be supported organizationally. As Ferrari et al. have noted, “the lack of time to
properly discuss mental health problems with clients” is a barrier in the health care sys-
tem [13].

Another benefit of transcultural training and tools is to develop understandings of
how mental health can be informed by cultural values. As Adeponle et al. demonstrate,
“ethnic differences in psychiatric diagnosis may arise because clinicians attribute and
interpret symptoms differently” [16]. Such assumptions can lead to misdiagnoses, espe-
cially in mental health, leading Sundvall et al. to assert “the need for the assessing clin-
ician to have a broad understanding of variations of risk factors and to avoid the
stereotyped view” [14]. Each client will interpret their mental health framed through
their own unique perspectives; allowing them to explain their experiences can prevent
culturally biased assumptions from providers. As Kirmayer et al. demonstrate, the con-
sequences of cultural misunderstandings can be significant, including “incomplete as-
inadequate or inappropriate treatment, and failed
sessments,
treatment alliances. These problems are costly, both in terms of increased service use
and in terms of poor clinical outcomes” [26]. Choosing appropriate processes for ex-
ploring past trauma is also key in supporting effective assessments and care oriented to
the refugee experience [27, 28].

incorrect diagnoses,

Since the mental health problems of immigrant and refugee patients are often based
in traumas affecting all family members, many studies emphasized the appropriateness
for a family-based approach [1, 29–38]. Supporting the family and understanding their

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22 

Page 16 of 19

collective experience of mental health and trauma is a valuable approach in transcul-
tural care [39]. Multiple studies echo our findings that successful treatment plans are
most effective if families can play a supportive role in the healing process [30, 33, 34].

Weine et al.’s study demonstrates that rapidly changing roles, obligations, and con-
nections of traumatized refugee families in the new country create additional coping
challenges [35]. Solobodin and de Jong’s systematic review concluded that secondary
trauma among immigrants and refugees was common, where “family members are af-
fected not only by the changes experienced by the primary trauma victim but also by
the victim’s transmission of trauma-related experiences, behaviors, emotions, and atti-
tudes” [1]. Cultural norms of male dominance can be a barrier for women accessing
the services they need, so attention needs to be paid to the relationship dynamics to en-
sure all members are safe from abuse within the family [11].

Our respondents noted that the resettlement process itself can be traumatic, a finding
that is reflected in the literature [1, 21, 29, 40]. Families are facing a wide range of diffi-
cult pre- and post-migration experiences that create collective trauma [1, 33, 38, 41].
As Ehntholt and Yule note, “frequently refugees need to discuss practical or present dif-
ficulties rather than past experiences owing to the high levels of social and material ad-
versity under which they are often living” [3]. Thus the mental health care response
should ensure “balancing past trauma with present-day resettlement and acculturative
stressors (e.g., housing, employment, health care)” [24]. This collective trauma adds sig-
nificant complexity to mental health assessments and treatment plans. And since these
traumas can be presented in unfamiliar or subtle ways, not all care providers are able
to correctly assess them among immigrant and refugee patients [42].

Mental health care for immigrant and refugee patients and families is complex and
thus needs an approach that is well informed and supported by an organizational com-
mitment to standards of care. In addition, complex family-based trauma care, as rec-
ommended by Mendenhall and Berge,
requires an interdisciplinary team-based
approach [43]. The skills needed for this team include a wide range of transcultural
practices, including training with the cultural formulation interview and working with
interpreters [10, 26, 39]. Despite wanting flexibility, respondents emphasized the value
of a standardized transcultural mental health assessment process, as seen in a range of
studies [1, 2, 29, 44]. As Adeponle et al. note,

No gold standard method exists for diagnosis in cross-cultural settings. Although in-
vestigators have traditionally advocated for the use of structured interviews and strict
diagnostic criteria as a way to reduce biases that may occur in clinical settings stud-
ies indicate that neither approach yields more accurate diagnosis or eliminates clin-
ician bias [16].

This suggests that any assessment tool needs to support “flexibly tailored, multilevel in-
terventions that are implemented in creative and engaging ways” [24].

Conclusions
The respondents in our study demonstrated that ensuring mindful, reflexive practices
that are transcultural and trauma-informed will go a long way in improving the health
care experiences and healing journeys of immigrants and refugees in the mental health

Wylie et al. Public Health Reviews  (2018) 39:22

care system [24]. Although guidelines exist to inform such a practice in the DSM-5,
some of the requirements, such as a supported learning environment that included
education, resourcing, and standardized tools, are not in place across mental health ser-
vices in London, Ontario. In addition, the complexity of intergenerational and family
trauma highlights the need for using a family-based model of care, which is also poorly
supported through existing models for appointments and billing. Families are collect-
ively facing past and present challenges, ensuring the family as a whole is collectively
embarking on their healing journey builds resilience to support that healing.

This strong endorsement from care providers and community agencies led to the de-
velopment of a transcultural, trauma-informed family-based mental health consultation
service. The next research phase will assess the benefits of this model for improved
health outcomes of immigrant and refugee families experiencing trauma. Intervention
research that
focuses on outcomes is needed to demonstrate effectiveness of a
family-based approach that explores social and cultural determinants of health of im-
migrants and refugees as they resettle into their new lives [11, 27, 44]. This study dem-
onstrates that it is a step in the right direction.
