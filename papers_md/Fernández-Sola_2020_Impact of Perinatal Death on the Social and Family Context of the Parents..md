Abstract: Background: Perinatal death (PD) is a painful experience, with physical, psychological and
social consequences in families. Each year, there are 2.7 million perinatal deaths in the world and
about 2000 in Spain. The aim of this study was to explore, describe and understand the impact of
perinatal death on parents’ social and family life. Methods: A qualitative study based on Gadamer’s
hermeneutic phenomenology was used. In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 mothers and
eight fathers who had suﬀered a perinatal death. Inductive analysis was used to ﬁnd themes based
on the data. Results: Seven sub-themes emerged, and they were grouped into two main themes:
1) perinatal death aﬀects family dynamics, and 2) the social environment of the parents is severely
aﬀected after perinatal death. Conclusions: PD impacts the family dynamics of the parents and their
family, social and work environments. Parents perceive that society trivializes their loss and disallows
or delegitimizes their grief. Implications: Social care, health and education providers should pay
attention to all family members who have suﬀered a PD. The recognition of the loss within the social
and family environment would help the families to cope with their grief.

Keywords: perinatal death; perinatal grief; disenfranchised grief; qualitative research; parents care

1. Introduction

Perinatal death (PD) occurs between the 22nd full week of gestation (or when the baby weighs
500 g) and 7 days after birth [1], and although it has decreased globally [2], about 2% of pregnancies
end in stillbirth [3]. The worldwide PD rate is estimated at around 2.7 million deaths per year [4].
In Europe, the average PD rate is 5.5 deaths for every 1000 births [5] and is lower in Spain with 4.43
deaths for every 1000 births, representing some 2000 aﬀected families each year [6].

PD is one of the most painful experiences for parents [7,8], who have to undergo grieving and
coping processes that include biological, psychological, social and spiritual aspects [9,10]. Grief after
a PD is a normal and individual process with multiple biopsychosocial repercussions [11]. The physical

symptoms include decreased appetite, weight loss [12], insomnia [13], increased chronic diseases,
and decreased quality of life [14]. On a psychological level, parents who suﬀer a PD have a greater
predisposition to suﬀer anxiety, depression [15], post-traumatic stress syndrome [16], and even
an increased risk of suicide [17]. In the family environment, the death of a baby modiﬁes family
relationships [18] and changes the behavior and type of care for older children [19], varying from
overprotection [20] to the distancing of other children and neglect of parental obligations [21]. PD
also aﬀects older siblings who experience feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety and misunderstanding [22].
The couple’s life is also aﬀected as they may become distant from each other, and there is an increase in
the frequency of conﬂicts [23,24].

In Western countries, PD grieving is not fully recognized or socially legitimated [25]; it is not
granted the importance it deserves, and its consequences are underestimated [26]. Parents do not
receive suﬃcient support on a psychological or spiritual level, and even if death occurs before
childbirth [25,27], its invisibility increases the negative repercussions [28]. Within this social context,
a father’s grief is even less recognized [29]. On the one hand, the father is imbued with a social role
of providing physical and emotional support for mothers, rendering his feelings, experiences and
needs invisible [30]; on the other hand, the attachment and bond of a father is considered to be more
rational and less passionate [31] since a mother creates her bond with the fetus from the ﬁrst weeks of
pregnancy and this is reaﬃrmed with fetal movements [32]. However, the risk of dysfunctional grief
and the symptoms of psychological trauma is common in both sexes [33,34], although less studied in
fathers [29].

The theoretical framework used in this research is based on the Worden theory of the tasks
of grieving [35]. Worden deﬁnes grieving as an adaptation process in which the person suﬀering
a loss must complete the following “tasks”: accept the reality of the loss, work through the grieving
for the loss, adapt to an environment in which the deceased baby is not there and ﬁnd a lasting
connection with the deceased baby while continuing a new life. Worden considers seven determining
factors to understand the experience of people suﬀering from a PD process. Among these factors,
great importance is given to social issues and the environment in which the adaptation takes place.
Worden included such environmental factors as “mediator 6: social variables” [36]. Although the
individual implications of perinatal death on the parents [11–18] and the social support available to
survivors [37] have been extensively investigated, there is a lack of research involving fathers [38,39].
Moreover, the impact of PD on the social environment and the extended family has been poorly
investigated [40]. The aim of our study is thus to explore, describe and understand the impact of
perinatal death on parents’ social and family life.

2. Methods

2.1. Study Design

A qualitative study was designed based on the hermeneutical phenomenology of Gadamer,
which highlights the dialogic nature of understanding. For Gadamer, “understanding” is a process in
which the researcher’s viewpoint (“horizon of pre-understanding”) participates in a dialog with the
participants’ horizon of pre-understanding [41,42]. As a result, an understanding of the phenomenon
arises, and this implies a “fusion of horizons” [41] (p. 305).

The Gadamerian-based method developed by Valerie Fleming has been followed in this
study [43]. Firstly, researchers must ensure that the phenomenon they intend to study can be
experienced in the lifeworld. This is the case for perinatal death and its impact on parents’ social
and family life. Secondly, the researchers must clarify their pre-understanding of the phenomenon
(“reﬂexivity”). For Gadamer, it is not possible to exclude the researcher’s previous ideas (prejudice
or pre-understanding) and all understanding emerges from the researcher’s pre-understanding of
a phenomenon. Thus, the researchers’ pre-understanding of the phenomenon has to be clariﬁed
and they must explain how such pre-understanding was used in the investigation [44]. Three of the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

researchers were midwives (M.C.-A., E.H.-S., M.B.C.-F.) who helped us to recruit the sample and carry
out the interviews. Other researchers have experience in qualitative research (C.F.-S., J.M.H.-P., J.G.-M.,
I.M.F.-M.) and have previously researched perinatal death and grief (F.R.J-L., I.M.F.-M.). This helped
them to conduct the study and analysis. One researcher is a native Spaniard who is bilingual in English
(J.M.H.-P.) and helped us in the process of the translation and back-translation of the interviews to
avoid losing their expressiveness.

The study was conducted in the hospitals of Torrevieja and Vinalopó, in Alicante, Spain.
Both belong to the Spanish National Health System (public hospitals) and have an average of
1400 births per year each.

2.2. Participants

In order to recruit participants, the data manager at both hospitals provided the researchers with
the contact information of all the parents who had suﬀered a perinatal death in the last 5 years (n = 63).
Once the researchers checked that the potential participants met the inclusion criteria, one of the
researchers (M.C.-A.) telephoned them to explain the study’s aim and to invite them to participate.
When the potential participants asked for some time to think about the invitation, they were contacted
again two days later. The interviewers made an appointment with those who accepted participation.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: having suﬀered a perinatal loss between the 22nd week of
gestation and the ﬁrst week of life of the baby; the death having occurred between three months and
ﬁve years before the time of the interview; and signing the informed consent form. The exclusion
criteria were as follows: not speaking Spanish or English (8 cases) and refusing to participate in the
study (18 cases). Nine people declined participation because they did not want to talk about the
topic, and another nine said they did not have time to participate. In the end, 21 participants were
interviewed (age range 26–43 years old, SD: 4.76 years). The researchers let the participants decide
where they wanted to be interviewed so that they felt most comfortable. All in-depth interviews
were conducted face-to-face with the participants, who did not have to go back to the hospital where
their babies’ death occurred. The participants did not receive any economic compensation for their
participation. All of the participants were part of either a nuclear family (n = 19) or an extended nuclear
family with grandparents (n = 2). The socio-demographic data of all participants can be seen in Table 1.

2.3. Data Collection

In-depth interviews were carried out by three researchers working as midwives (M.C.-A., E.H.-S.,
M.B.C.-F.) in the hospitals in which the study was conducted. The researchers received training
on how to make the interviews resemble an in-depth conversation and on how to handle painful
situations. They had an interview protocol that contained the aims, ethical issues, and a list of
questions (Table 2). Before commencing with the interviews, the researchers reminded the participants
of the aim of the study and the voluntary nature of their participation. All participants signed an
informed consent. All interviews were recorded for later transcription. The average duration of the
interviews was 45 min. The researchers made notes on nonverbal elements of the communication.
When the researchers considered that data saturation had been reached, the data collection was
ﬁnalized. This decision was made upon the following two criteria: 1) there were no new issues arising
from the participants’ interviews, and 2) the remaining eligible participants did not have diﬀerent
sociodemographic characteristics (for example, single parents). Those who did not participate despite
being eligible and giving consent to participate were sent an email to thank them for their willingness
and to let them know that it was not going to be necessary to interview them.

2.4. Data Analysis

The following steps described by Valerie Fleming [43] were followed in order to understand the
phenomena from the data. Firstly, the researchers (M.C.-A., E.H.-S., M.B.C.-F.) reached a spontaneous
understanding through the dialog with the participants (interviews). In order to do so, the researchers
made notes that were useful in the subsequent transcription and coding process. These notes also helped
to modify some questions or request more details which were not initially included in the interview
protocol. Secondly, the researchers gained an understanding of the studied phenomenon through the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

transcription analysis. All interviews were transcribed (M.C.-A., E.H.-S., M.B.C.-F.) and incorporated
into a Project in ATLAS.ti 8 Software for analysis (C.F.-S., J.M.H.-P., F.R.J.-L., M.B.C.-F.). The transcripts
were read to get a general idea of what the participants said. Then, the transcriptions were re-read line
by line for detailed analysis. Signiﬁcant fragments were selected as citations. The citations were coded
using the ATLAS.ti coding procedures (open coding, coding from a code list, autocoding). The initial
codes were grouped into units of meaning, sub-themes and themes using ATLAS.ti functions such
as grouping codes or creating networks. An example of the coding work that led us from the data
(quotation) to the subject can be seen in Table 3. Thirdly, to increase the rigor of the study (credibility,
reliability), some participants checked the units of meaning, themes, and sub-themes.

The study was approved by the Joint Investigation Commission of the Hospitals of Torrevieja
and Vinalopó (CIVHTV-16-28-12). Participation was voluntary. Following the interview protocol
(see Table 2), information on ethical aspects (i.e., conﬁdentiality, the need to record interviews,
the possibility of not responding or abandoning the interview, anonymity) was provided at the
beginning of the interview. The participants received emotional support during and after the interviews.

3. Results

The data analysis led to 36 units of meaning that were grouped into seven sub-themes.
These sub-themes were grouped into two main themes that helped us to understand how parents who
have suﬀered a PD perceive the impact it has on their social and family environment (Table 4).

3.1. Perinatal Death Aﬀects Family Dynamics

In the context of the nuclear family, parents and siblings who live in the same house suﬀer
the consequences of perinatal death individually. All suﬀer a grieving process after the loss of the
baby. However, there is also an impact of perinatal death on family dynamics as it is impossible to
separate them from the emotional, physical and psychological state of each of its members. This theme
represents the participants’ perceptions of how family dynamics have been aﬀected. It includes the
role of the father, the siblings and the way the couple’s ties have altered.

“( . . . ) Late at night our looks crossed, and he said: ‘Darling I’ve also been remembering’. And I: ‘Yes,
I know you’ve been remembering’. But he doesn’t want to show that something is hurting”.

(P-10)

3.1.1. The Father: The Struggle between Conserving the Stereotypical Protective Role and Succumbing
to Pain

Participants perceive the inﬂuence of social stereotypes in Spain on the distribution of roles
traditionally given to fathers and mothers within a family. According to these stereotypes,
the responsibility for the protection of the family rests on the father, and in the case of a painful situation
such as PD, they are responsible for caring for the mother. Traditionally characterized as strong,
tough and less sensitive, many fathers do not publicly show their feelings. Furthermore, some women
think that men go through a diﬀerent grieving process as they have not gestated the baby and believe
that the bond is less strong than that of women.

“I think that, even if it aﬀects them . . . the feeling is diﬀerent. You [the woman] have experienced
it for a long time, that bond that you have created. As it wasn’t born, they have not felt it and it is
diﬀerent, you have felt it and the man only puts his hand there”.

(P-14, Female)

“At least try to be the stronger, because I thought that, ‘Poof! How can I feel as down as she does . . .
’ Maybe because I am the man (we have) to swallow it and stand on our feet or be a little stronger
or ( . . . ) try to cry apart”.

(P-4, Male)

However, the implicit demand for fathers to be strong raises tensions because men also go through
a grieving process with very deep emotions, thoughts and feelings. Despite trying to hide or disguise
these feelings, everyday life makes it impossible to disguise reality—a reality that reﬂects a suﬀering
similar to that of mothers, and a pain that is diﬃcult to alleviate, to which the fathers have to add
the burden of having to carry both their “weight” and that of their partner. Participants describe the
process by which the father ends up succumbing to pain as “falling apart”:

“He tried to make himself strong, although occasionally I found him crying in the corner, where he
thought I would not see him ( . . . )”

(P-16)

“In the ten years that I’ve been with him I’ve never seen him cry... he tried to become strong and brave,
but he couldn’t, and he fell apart”.

(P-14)

The father participants also perceived the pressure of having to be stronger and ended up rebelling
against this stereotypical requirement. Some no longer showed a frustrated attempt to be stronger
or an inability to maintain appearances. They simply rebel against the stereotype of a strong and
insensitive father:

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

7 of 18

“But supposedly fathers have to be stronger than them. Stronger than them? Shit! That’s not true.
We fathers have our feelings too, you know?”

(P-7)

The father participants noted that there is a lack of support and a certain abandonment of the task of
looking after them. During hospitalization and immediately after PD, both physical and psychological
care was directed towards the mothers. Although one father reported that he felt he was very well
treated, normally they faced an absence or lack of care. This neglect hindered the grieving process and
made the father’s needs invisible while engulfed in the strong emotional pain caused by the experience
of losing and “burying” a baby. The invisibility of the fathers’ grief makes it more diﬃcult for them to
work on the pain they feel after the loss.

“Nobody cared about my husband. Because I was bad and he was more worried about me. So my
husband couldn’t lean on anyone.”

(P-19)

“She was given more attention, when it came to explaining things, when it came to telling things.
Most of the time it was more towards her, ( . . . ) I was invisible to many people. However, I was also
having a hard time.”

(P-20)

3.1.2. The Elder Siblings: Feeling Overprotected or Abandoned

Together with the parents, the elder children in the family are also generally forgotten by the care
system. In general, they do not receive any kind of support and suﬀer the consequences of the grief
that their parents are going through; nobody pays attention to them, and nobody notices whether they
need support in order to understand that they have lost a brother or sister. Some parents’ stories show
excessive protection towards their other children for fear of something happening to them.

“We are more protective and spoil him a little more. For example, before he had to do a job to get
something. But not now. Now he can always easily get something out of me . . . ”

(P-18)

“I already know what it is to lose a child, I have to take more care of them. My daughter tells me:
‘Why do you take so much care of me now?’, and I tell her I’m afraid that something could happen to
her or someone could do something to her; it makes me very scared.”

(P-10)

However, other testimonies are in stark contrast to the idea of overprotection: these statements
show parents who have partly neglected their older children because they were so immersed in their
own grief that they gave up their duties and responsibilities as parents of other children. The pain,
suﬀering and depression which a mother and a father who lose a baby experience can aﬄict them not
only physically and psychologically but also behaviorally, leading to the neglect of other children.

“My children told me, ‘Mommy, you’ve changed a lot, you’ve become indiﬀerent to us, (...)
I
understand your pain and everything, but you’ve put us aside, you only cared about the little girl,
and we need you’. And all that was true.”

(P-2)

“ . . . [My children] sometimes dared not talk to me because I didn’t feel like doing anything. I apologized
to them because I turned away from them and became distant from them. I gave in so much to my
pain, and this was the way of living my grief.”

(P-12)

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

In most cases, parents failed to inform their children of what had happened. They omitted information
and avoided facing the diﬃcult moment of telling their children what had really happened. They told
them nothing in order to protect themselves, to avoid reviving or rekindling the suﬀering, and to protect
their children from this suﬀering and prevent them from feeling pain; on the other hand, some parents
did not explain the situation because they thought the children were not ready to understand what
had happened, postponing the explanations to when their children were older.

“He had a hard time telling our daughter. I remember being there, he told me that ‘Now how do I
explain it to you, how can I tell you?’ But do you know what’s happened? that she hasn’t seen the
baby (...) I haven’t shown her a photo. We chose not to say anything, why make her suﬀer?”

(P-19)

“I didn’t say anything, because I thought she was strong, it was hard for me to tell my daughter things
I’m not sure she’ll be able to understand. She asked me what was wrong with me and I told her that
when I was older I would tell them.”

(P-10)

In the cases in which the children understood what had happened and had been told about it, they went
through a grieving process, which, according to the parents, was very hard for them as parents as they
could see their children were suﬀering. Tears, anxiety, and fear were the common reactions of most
of the children, who had been looking forward to having a baby brother or sister. One father also
said that the brother was trying to keep the dead baby in mind, by remembering, talking about him,
representing him as an angel, or drawing him.

“He always remembered and said: “Mom, and my little brother who is now in heaven? (crying) (...)
and then he reminded me of him, and I tried not to cry, but I saw him so small that we both ended up
crying.”

(P-6)

“My son had a hard time. He got rather depressed. He still says his name today and makes drawings
of his brother with ( . . . ), with his wings and such things.”

(P-3)

In one case, a participant reported self-protective reactions by the siblings, such as thinking about
avoiding a bond with other living siblings in order to prevent suﬀering in case of a new loss.

“It aﬀected him a lot, and he told his little brother, who was in my belly, that he was not going to love
him like he had the other one. I think he didn’t want to become fond of him in case it happened again.”

3.1.3. New Pregnancies Dominated by Fear: Medicalization and Avoidance

Families who tried to have another baby again after losing a child faced a serious challenge.
The new pregnancy brought on feelings of fear, stress and anxiety regarding the possibility of
losing another baby. The thoughts and feelings of the previous experience emerged and rekindled
fears, and instead of being something happy and wonderful for the family, the new pregnancy
became something that overwhelmed them. Behaviors such as the medicalization of the pregnancy
appeared, with continuous pregnancy controls and excessive abuse of emergency services out of fear
of another loss.

“ . . . Even if they told you that everything is going well, every month each time I went to the
ultrasound, well, imagine. I was outside [in the waiting room] and my legs were shaking.”

(P-15)

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

“I went through the next three pregnancies in fear. A pain, [and I went] to the emergency room;
a spot, to the emergency room (...). I went very often, I was very afraid. I was in panic in case I went
through the same thing again.”

(P-16)

Other participants reported that the fear of a repeated painful experience led them to avoid another
pregnancy. Although they recognized that they would like to have another baby or that it could be
positive to experience another pregnancy, the fear of going through the same PD situation was strong,
and they even avoided thinking about it.

“I would like to have a baby sometime, but I don’t want to go through the same thing again. I especially
don’t want my wife to go through it again. I don’t know whether she could take it. So I avoid these
thoughts.”

(P-18)

“It may be positive for me to get pregnant again, but on the other hand I am very scared of going
through that situation again. I don’t want to go through that situation again, it distresses me to think
about it.”

(P-19)

3.1.4. The Strengthening and Weakening of the Couple’s Bond

This diﬃcult experience was able to strengthen the bonds of

the
participants. Some reported what happened as something that they had to live through together.
Others, perceiving the risk to the couple, consciously decided to strengthen their bond; i.e., to stick
together. Thus, athepainful experience ended up strengthening the bond of the couples who decided
to face it together. This was recounted by two participants:

the majority of

“We’ve talked a lot, and I’ve told him: ‘What has happened to us is something that we’ve been through
together’. I have the feeling that it has brought us much closer.”

(P-20, Male)

“We clung more to each other and became stronger. (...) We stuck together, [we think:] ‘do they want
to hurt us? Well, nobody will be able to.’ Because I know this can break a marriage or a family.”

(P-16, Female)

However, in the ﬁrst months after the PD, arguments and disagreements became more frequent.
This seems to be because, according to the participants, each member of the couple faces the pain and
stress of the PD in their own way. Pain, together with almost continuous emotional stress and tension,
triggers quarrels and disagreements.

“We have more arguments than before, many more. Every time when I lose my temper because I am
a little low or depressed or down, we argue.”

(P-4, Male)

“... I have my own character, and we didn’t see it in the same way. And he shouted and said to me:
Stop, don’t carry on! And interrupted me. (...) And I was enraged because I get angry when people
shout at me.”

(P-19, Female)

The couple’s sexual relations also changed. During the grieving process, a lack of sexual desire was
a common point in almost all of those interviewed. This, coupled with the fear of a new pregnancy and
fear of going through the same thing again, made sexual intercourse null or minimal, although over
time this improved.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

“Well... we were doing nothing for a while because I didn’t feel like it, how can you feel like it?
You have your head somewhere else... when you’re sad, who is going to feel like it?”

(P-1)

“At ﬁrst I didn’t want to have sex, I didn’t feel like it, and I thought, what if I got pregnant? I didn’t
feel like anything, I was afraid to go through it again, so I avoided sleeping with him.”

(P-6)

3.2. The Social Environment of the Parents is Severely Aﬀected After Perinatal Death

This section covers three sub-themes that reﬂect how PD aﬀects the parents’ social sphere.
The impact of the loss reaches the members of the extended family as well as work and social
environments. Both seeing other children and the use of stereotyped messages of comfort intensify the
pain. In addition, stereotyped messages are not eﬀective because they denote an intrinsic banalization
of the loss or the disallowance of grief. All this leads to parents avoiding social contact.

“We can’t do anything because there are babies everywhere, pregnant women everywhere . . . And we
get depressed. So you don’t know where to go, and you lock yourself in the house.”

(P-17)

3.2.1. Impact of the Perinatal Death on the Extended Family

The extended family, understood as the network of relatives—especially blood relatives—which
extends beyond the domestic group, suﬀers the impact of the pain of their relatives and the death of
a baby they did not get to know. Participants report receiving condolence and support from their
relatives and that they perceived double pain for the mother/father and for the deceased baby:

“The family called us, and they worried about us, my sister, my aunt (pause) saw that she had hit rock
bottom, and that’s why they called (...). I also imagine that they would be feeling bad. It was their
nephew, and suddenly they don’t have him. They would call me and them (...) I know they had a bad
time.”

(P-7)

“I had never seen my mother (paternal grandmother) so bad, so bad ( . . . ).”

(P-9)

One participant recounted how her mother (the grandmother of the deceased fetus) developed her
own grief for a similar loss decades before when she had no opportunity to experience grief. Losing her
grandchild enabled her to remember her loss and resolve a pending grief.

“My mother lost a daughter and had no chance to grieve. She has grieved for her own daughter
with her granddaughter. She had lost a daughter who had been stillborn thirty-ﬁve years before, and
they didn’t want to teach her to grieve. They buried the baby immediately. So it’s been good for her,
to mourn now.”

(P-13)

3.2.2. Impact on Work: Lose a Child, Lose a Job

Undoubtedly, the work environment of people suﬀering from PD is damaged. People in their
grieving process reported a decrease in their performance at work, causing, in two cases, the loss of
employment. In addition to losing a child, they had to face job loss and its consequences, increasing their
pain, anguish, stress and suﬀering. The pain experienced by the people who lost a baby lowered their
ability to concentrate, and this, together with the deprivation of the quantity and quality of sleep,
explained how their performance worsened.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

11 of 18

“It gave me bad depression, and I lost my job. I lost my job because they had to give me more days oﬀ,
and they told me that they couldn’t wait any longer, and so I lost my job (...) everything combined,
my baby died, and they ﬁred me... It was one problem after another.”

(P-2)

For one father, leaving work was the result of a choice between staying with his partner or going to
work in an unsuitable physical condition, suﬀering from insomnia or a lack of concentration.

“I lost the habit of sleeping, I had to choose, let’s say I had to quit my job to be with my wife. (...) my
wife wanted me to start... that I went to work, right? (...) I was going to work without sleep day after
day and working, so think of it, working without sleep and with my head in another place.”

(P-11)

Other participants presented their work as a means of escape or isolation from other environments
such as parks or family gatherings, where the elements that recall the lost child are present.

“You are looking for your escape routes, either working ( . . . ) You isolate yourself a little from all of
that because what you want is to avoid environments that remind you of your child.”

(P-5)

3.2.3. Social Impact: Between Disenfranchised Grief and the Remembered Pain

Parents who have suﬀered the death of their babies return to their social environment, beyond the
family and work environment, where they must complete the tasks of working through their grief
and adapting to life without the lost baby. In this environment, they may ﬁnd that the attitudes and
responses of their acquaintances to their pain do not recognize or banalize PD. Thus, the pain of the
parents becomes invisible and is minimized with comments including that they had not got to know
their dead baby or that he or she was very small.

“Then people tell you: ‘it’s better that it happened when the baby was three days old and not three
months’, can you believe it? As if it hurt more before or after, you know? People are incredible.”

(P-7)

Participants perceive that it is not socially recognized that the bond with babies begins from the
beginning of pregnancy, rather that this relationship is related to the birth and presence of the newborn
baby in the family. Parents experience grief with suﬀering and are also disenfranchised by the social
environment to which they belong, which makes it diﬃcult for them to express their grief naturally.
Underestimating grief could hamper fathers’ and mothers’ ability to take actions toward a healthy
grief (for example, accepting reality).

“When I talk with friends, family, I try to make the eﬀort, ( . . . ), to talk about my son and that I have
been a father. Although nobody recognizes this, I am sure, I have felt responsible as a father, I have had
the feeling of being a father.”

(P-20)

It can be painful and strange for mothers and fathers that their acquaintances may behave as if nothing
had happened; this is not due to a need for the validation of pain but rather because they interpret the
absence of mention of the loss as not recognizing it. A mother recounted the following:

“I don’t need anyone to validate my grief. But people frequently behave as if nothing had happened to
you. People say that ‘as it was a baby you didn’t know... you know? You didn’t want it’ (pause) and I
said: ‘Let’s see, didn’t you see my belly? ( . . . ) You can’t behave as if, as if nothing had happened.”

(P-13)

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

12 of 18

This non-recognition by the community increases with phrases, comments and actions that, far from
helping parents, cause them increased pain and suﬀering. They hear hurtful phrases that downplay
the death of their baby, increasing or blocking the pain they suﬀer, and unpleasant comments that
undermine the loss by downplaying it or considering that their painful experience is not unique,
or suggesting that another baby will dissipate the pain for the lost baby.

“I was told: ‘Ah, don’t worry, in a year or two you will have another one’. ‘The same thing happened
to my cousin, to my neighbor . . . ’ I don’t care what happened to your cousin or your neighbor! I care
about myself, and what has happened to me hurts.”

(P-8)

Perhaps because of this, the majority of the families in the process of grieving preferred to live alone,
isolated from a community which sometimes failed to understand their pain. Some participants
reported that they isolated themselves for a while, avoiding going out and stayed at home or with
their closest relatives more—they tried to work through the experience alone.

“It makes you shut yourself up a little, that is, go out less, feel like being alone, withdraw a little
(...). It has also isolated us from friends (...). My partner and I shut ourselves up at home more,
inside ourselves.”

(P-4)

Other participants reported that they suﬀered stress by exposing themselves to social situations
that reminded them of their deceased babies. Birthdays, baptisms, walks in the park or meeting
pregnant mothers were situations in which it was common to see children of all ages including babies.
These situations reminded them of their dead baby and were a source of stress for parents. They were
diﬃcult situations that they tried to avoid in an attempt not to increase their suﬀering.

“The horrible birthdays, (sob) but the worst thing is Christmas, when we get together with my
nephews and nieces. (...). Because you see the children and say: ‘Oh no! Our baby could have been
here’”

(P-12)

“Wherever you go... you are reminded, and the child is not there, not there [silence]. It’s not there,
and it’s frustrating (...). So we avoided being in places where there were children. It brought us the
anxiety of remembering again... We had lost ours two months before”

(P-5)

4. Discussion

The aim of this study was to describe and understand the impact of perinatal death on parents’
social and family life. Using Worden’s theoretical framework [35] has allowed us to approach
environmental factors (i.e., social and familiar) that play an important role in the process of adaptation
of those who have suﬀered a loss due to PD. However, our study suggests that the environment is not
only the physical space to which people adapt; the parents’ environment also suﬀers the impact of
the PD and contains elements that can facilitate or obstruct the adaptation process. The results of this
study suggest the need to reinterpret the role of the father, which is traditionally relegated by society
and professionals to a secondary role in relation to the children [28]. In line with other studies [45,46],
we can see that fathers perceive that their pain is undervalued. However, in this study, mothers
also openly acknowledge that fathers fall apart and give up their protective role in order to work
through their grief. In addition, men—culturally recognized as the pillar of support for mothers and
the family [47]—reported that they needed someone who they could ask about their condition or get
emotional support from because, as shown in other studies, they noticed that attention was centered

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

13 of 18

on the mother [47,48]. This may make some fathers feel marginalized from the grieving process [11]
and hinder their socialization, which is needed for a successful grief process [35]. This invisibility of
the father’s grief may be due to the fact that, when pregnant, the woman has a physical connection to
the baby while the father’s link is only mental [49,50]. Health professionals and the community ignore
and disallow the father´s grieving for PD although it has been shown that PD does have repercussions
for fathers [46]. It is necessary to determine the needs of fathers [51,52] and clearly recognize their
grief [38,39,47,53]. Although the sample of fathers in this study as more limited than that of mothers,
our study investigates the experiences and perceptions of both sexes.

PD also impacts siblings, who are sometimes omitted or given incorrect information about what
has happened [54]. In this study, the parents reported that they chose to omit information out of
a sense of protection, although in other cases they decided to wait for the children to mature so that
they could understand what had happened. However, it is necessary that minors can also grieve for
the death of their siblings [55], and this starts from recognizing the loss instead of denying it [35].
Healthcare providers must take into account the siblings’ needs and feelings [56]. When perinatal
death occurs, parents change their way of caring, and this aﬀects their children [57]. Some parents in
this study reported that they were absent and neglected their older children and felt guilty about it.
As has been previously reported, other parents reported that they overprotected their children out of
fear of something happening to them [20,21,58,59].

PD has repercussions in subsequent pregnancies [60], which is a complex situation that requires
health professionals’ support [61]. In some studies, mothers and fathers expressed that a new pregnancy
would decrease their pain and emotional emptiness [19,62]. However, our study participants fear
that a new pregnancy would have a similar outcome and this causes some parents to dismiss that
possibility. In this regard, a new pregnancy without the mother being ready can cause attachment
problems with the next child [25,63]. Participants who did become pregnant after the PD reported
that they went to emergency services more often in the following pregnancies, out of fear and concern
that the PD would recur. Other studies suggest that fear and anguish of a new PD increases visits to
healthcare services [15,64,65].

PD has an important impact on the dynamics of the couple’s relationship [39,66]. Previous studies
show that abortion or PD situations increase disputes between couples [67] and increases the probability
of a divorce [68], especially when one of the couple does not feel the necessary support from their
partner [23]. However, this study suggests that the PD served as a stimulus to strengthen the bond of
the couple (face adversity together) but that it also increased the number of arguments between the
couple. In accordance with other studies in which the sexual life of couples was shown to change after
PD or abortion [69], sexual desire and sexual intercourse decreased according to the participants of
this study.

Perinatal death and grief not only aﬀect the nuclear family but also the extended family and
the parents’ social environment [70]. Grandparents’ expectations and hopes for the arrival of
a new grandchild are jeopardized, which could have consequences that need to be addressed and
understood [71,72]. Grandparents and close family members play a crucial role in social support and
communication with parents [73]. Perinatal grief in grandparents and close relatives is a ﬁeld to be
investigated since this could help mitigate the consequences of PD. Therefore, the design of strategies
to support family members is crucial [74].

The impact of PD extends to the workplace; a study [75] conducted in the UK calculated the
losses linked to absenteeism and the decrease in productivity. In contrast, in this study, participants
reported their own decisions to leave their job as well as cases of being dismissed due to increased
absenteeism. However, an increase in dedication when using work as a refuge was also shown.
The community (social context) of the parents perceives the PD in a totally diﬀerent way from the
parents themselves [76]. The recognition of grief is often avoided and the pain of the parents is silenced,
resulting in a sense of unauthorized grieving [62,77]. This taboo and undervaluation of grief was
perceived by the mothers and fathers in the study when they received comments that trivialized their

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3421

14 of 18

pain. This made this type of grief invisible, increasing the sensation of stigma [78,79]. Some families
reported that there were people who shunned them and avoided talking about the subject, since this
grief is diﬀerent from other types of loss: no ﬂowers are given, no cards are oﬀered, there are no visits
and there are no religious rituals to validate the grief [25]. However, making this problem visible and
raising awareness in society may be important for parents [80,81].

The main limitation of this study is that parents were interviewed while they were grieving
for PD, which includes fetal and postnatal death—two diﬀerent situations that are likely to trigger
diﬀerent responses. However, it was preferred that the inclusion criteria were broad (i.e., PD in general);
furthermore, as few parents suﬀer postnatal death, creating a study solely including such parents
and comparing discourses would be diﬃcult. An additional limitation was that the sample in this
study was mostly made up of parents of Spanish nationality; including other cultural backgrounds
would have extended the generalizability of the data. Although both fathers and mothers were
interviewed, as suggested by other studies [51,52], the sample of fathers was smaller than that of
mothers as some refused to discuss the issue or could not because of work issues. Parents who declined
participation could have provided valuable information that in some cases could have been associated
with a pathological grieving process. The study reﬂects the parents’ perceptions of the impact of
their child’s PD on their social environment. This impact could have included other social actors
such as siblings, grandparents, etc. However, ethical issues (interviewing children) and accessibility
(grandparents, obtaining parental permits) forced us to contemplate these perspectives through the
parents’ perceptions. All participants were part of either a nuclear or an extended nuclear family
(with grandparents)—none of the participants were single parents or couples in non-heterosexual
relationships. Interviewing participants from single-parent families (or any other type of non-normative
families) could have provided complementary results.

5. Conclusions

PD aﬀects family dynamics, including a couple’s relationship, which can be strengthened by
coping with adversity together or weakened by increased arguments or decreased sexual activity.
Siblings and grandparents also suﬀer the consequences of PD in the family. Feelings of abandonment
or overprotection may arise in older siblings and expressions of grief or even an opportunity to resolve
past grief in grandparents.

Regarding their social environment, parents who suﬀer a loss due to PD experience work problems,
a lack of recognition of their grief, the absence of rituals, the trivialization of their loss and the disavowal
or delegitimization of their mourning.

In terms of the practical implications of this study, a family that suﬀers a PD may need
comprehensive care that goes beyond physical or psychological care. Knowing the impact of PD on
family dynamics, as well as the social, family and work environment can be useful for social care
providers, health care professionals (as nursing, midwifery or medicine) and educators. Attention must
be paid not only to mothers but also to fathers, older siblings and the extended family. Policies that
give the deceased fetus or baby the right to be registered and to have an identity or name should
be developed. Religious rites should be oﬀered in hospitals and communities for those parents who
wish to celebrate them. At a community-care level, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists or
psychologists should oﬀer targeted interventions to foster a healthy grief process amongst families
who have suﬀered a perinatal loss. The recognition of the loss by the community would help the
families to work through their grief.
