HIGHLIGHTS
• This pilot study investi-

gated the potential bene-
fits of EMDR for 10 patients 
with misophonia. 

• Three of the seven com-
pleters showed clinical 
improvement in misopho-
nia symptoms within 
a mean of 2.6 sessions. 
• The exploratory nature of 
this study makes further 
research necessary.  

ABSTRACT
Background:  Misophonia  is  a  disorder  in  which  patients  suffer  from  anger  or  disgust  when 
confronted with specific sounds such as loud chewing or breathing, causing avoidance of cue- 
related  situations  resulting  in  significant  functional  impairment.  Though  the  first  treatment 
studies with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) showed promising results, an average of 50% 
of the patients has not improved much clinically.
Objective:  The  aim  of  this  pilot  study  was  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  eye  movement 
desensitization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR)  therapy  as  a  trauma-focused  approach  in  treating 
misophonia symptoms.
Method:  A  sample  of  10  adult  participants  with  misophonia  was  studied  at  the  outpatient 
clinic of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. Participants were either on the waiting 
list for CBT or non-responders to CBT. EMDR was focused on misophonia-related emotionally 
disturbing memories and delivered in a mean of 2.6 sessions of 60–90 minutes. Pre- and post- 
treatment  self-assessed  ratings  of  misophonia  symptoms  (AMISOS-R,  primary  outcome),  of 
general  psychopathology  (SCL-90-R)  and  of  quality  of  life  (SDS)  were  administered.  The  co- 
primary outcome was the Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I).
Results: A paired t-test (n = 8) showed improvement on the primary outcome (−6.14 [MD], 5.34 
[SD])  on  the  AMISOS-R  (P  =  .023).  Three  of  the  eight  patients  showed  clinically  significant 
improvement  measured  with  the  CGI-I.  No  significant  effect  on  secondary  outcomes  was 
found.
Conclusions:  These  preliminary  results  suggest  that  EMDR  therapy  focused  on  emotionally 
disturbing  misophonia-related  memories  can  reduce  misophonia  symptoms.  RCTs  with  suffi-
cient sample sizes are required to firmly establish the value of EMDR therapy for misophonia.

Terapia EMDR para la misofonía: un estudio piloto de series de casos
Antecedentes:  La  misofonía  es  un  trastorno  en  el  que  los  pacientes  sufren  de  rabia 
o  desagrado  cuando  se  enfrentan  a sonidos  específicos  como  la masticación  o  la  respiración 
ruidosa, lo que provoca la evitación de las situaciones relacionadas con el estímulo y da lugar 
a un deterioro funcional significativo. Aunque los primeros estudios de tratamiento con terapia 
cognitivo-conductual  (TCC)  mostraron  resultados  prometedores,  una  media  del  50%  de  los 
pacientes no ha mejorado mucho clínicamente.
Objetivo:  El  objetivo  de  este  estudio  piloto  fue  evaluar  la  eficacia  de  la  terapia  de 
desensibilización  y  reprocesamiento  por  movimientos  oculares  (EMDR)  como  enfoque  cen-
trado en el trauma para tratar los síntomas de la misofonía.
Método:  Se  estudió  una  muestra  de  10  participantes  adultos  con  misofonía  en  la  clínica 
ambulatoria del Centro Médico Académico de Ámsterdam. Los participantes estaban en lista 
de  espera  para  la  TCC  o  no  respondían  a  la  TCC.  La  EMDR  se  centró  en  los  recuerdos 
emocionalmente  perturbadores  relacionados  con  la  misofonía  y  se  aplicó  en  una  media  de 
2,6 sesiones de 60–90 minutos. Se administraron calificaciones autoevaluadas antes y después 
del  tratamiento  de 
los  síntomas  de  misofonía  (AMISOS-R,  resultado  primario),  de 
psicopatología  general  (SCL-90-R)  y  de  calidad  de  vida  (SDS).  El  resultado  co-primario  fue  la 
escala de Mejora de la Impresión Clínica Global (CGI-I).
Resultados:  Una  prueba  t  pareada  (n=8)  mostró  una  mejora  en  el  resultado  primario  (−6,14 
[DM]),  5,34  [DE]  en  la  AMISOS-R  (P=  .023).  Tres  de  los  ocho  pacientes  mostraron  una  mejora 
clínicamente significativa medida con la CGI-I. No se encontró ningún efecto significativo en los 
resultados secundarios.
EMDR para la misofonía Estos resultados preliminares sugieren que la terapia EMDR centrada 
en los recuerdos emocionalmente perturbadores relacionados con la misofonía puede reducir 
los  síntomas  de  ésta.  Se  requieren  ECAs  con  tamaños  de  muestra  suficientes  para  establecer 
firmemente el valour de la terapia EMDR para la misofonía.

1. Background

Misophonia is a disorder in which patients suffer from 
anger or disgust when confronted with specific sounds 
such as loud chewing or breathing, causing avoidance 
of cue-related situations resulting in significant func-
tional  impairments  (Jager  et  al.,  2020a;  Schröder, 
Vulink,  &  Denys,  2013).  Misophonia  patients  can 
often  not  eat,  sleep  or  work  in  company  and  most 
social  and  family  relations  are  negatively  affected. 
Since  the  onset  of  symptoms  is  around  the  age  of  13 
(Jager et al, 2020a; Schröder et al., 2013), misophonia 
patients develop a lifelong coping behaviour of avoid-
ance, like walking away or using music or earplugs to 
camouflage trigger sounds. There is debate about the 
nature of the disorder, other research groups empha-
size  its  audiological  or  neurological  nature.  Recently, 
a Delphi Process study led to an agreement of experts 
of  at  least  80%  on  the  consensus  definition  of  miso-
phonia (Swedo et al., 2021).

Estimates of the incidence of misophonia in adults 
vary (Naylor, Caimino, Scutt, Hoare, & Baguley, 2020; 
Zhou,  Wu,  &  Storch,  2017).  Solid  epidemiological 
studies  are  missing,  also  as  a  consequence  of  the 
ongoing  debate  about  the  definition  of  misophonia. 
(Erfanian, 
Comorbidity 
Kartsonaki,  &  Keshavarz,  2019)  to  72%  (Jager  et  al., 
2020a) of subjects diagnosed with misophonia do not 
report  another  Axis  I  psychiatric  disorder.  Hence, 
misophonia  is  an  impairing  and  common  disorder 
for  which  effective  treatment  is  urgently  needed, 
given the huge impact on family and social relations.

is  relatively 

low:  40% 

The  Amsterdam  University  Medical  Center  of 
Psychiatry,  location  AMC  (Amsterdam  UMC)  has 
developed  the  first  protocoled  treatment  with  cogni-
tive behavioural  therapy (CBT) for  misophonia (Van 
Loon et al., 2019). CBT consists of four main compo-
nents:  task  concentration  exercises,  positive  affect 
labelling,  stimulus  manipulation,  and  arousal  reduc-
tion.  The  first  treatment  studies  with  CBT  showed 
promising 
(Schröder, 
Vulink,  Van  Loon,  &  Denys,  2017)  and  37%  of  the 

respectively,  48% 

results, 

patients (Jager et al., 2020b) showed significant clinical 
improvement  with  CBT  post  treatment.  However, 
CBT  is  ineffective  for  more  than  half  of  misophonia 
patients, who therefore require alternative treatments. 
Except 
for  CBT,  some  data  suggest  Tinnitus 
Retraining  Therapy  offers  an  83%  success  rate  for 
misophonia (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014).

EMDR therapy is an evidence-based psychological 
treatment  that  is  effective  for  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder  (PTSD)  and  its  comorbid  symptoms  (De 
Jongh,  Amann,  Hofmann,  Farrell,  &  Lee,  2019; 
International  Society  of  Traumatic  Stress  Studies 
[ISTSS], 2019; National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence, 2018). In the last decades, the insight that 
unprocessed  traumatic  memories  (not  only  criterion 
A events) play an important role in the development 
and maintenance of a variety of mental health condi-
tions  led  to  the  use  of  EMDR  therapy  as  a  trauma- 
focused treatment for a broader spectrum of disorders 
(Shapiro, 2018). Evidence for its effectiveness for dis-
orders  beyond  PTSD  is  growing,  such  as  for  major 
depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxi-
ety  disorders,  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  sub-
stance  use  disorder,  and  pain  (Matthijssen  et  al., 
2020;  Maxfield,  2019).  In  a  recent  meta-analysis  of 
RCTs  (Cuijpers,  Veen,  Sijbrandij,  Yoder,  &  Cristea, 
2020),  significant  results  were  found  for  EMDR  in 
phobias and test anxiety, but with a high risk of bias. 
Overall,  the  authors  concluded  that  there  is  not 
enough  evidence  for  the  use  of  EMDR  for  mental 
health  problems  other  than  PTSD  (Cuijpers  et  al., 
2020).  More  research  on  EMDR  and  larger  RCTs 
with  clear-cut  results  are  needed,  as  in  the  majority 
of the RCTs EMDR is merely used for comorbid PTSD 
or  as  an  add-on to  treatment-as-usual  (Meyerbröker, 
Emmelkamp, & Merkx, 2019).

The theoretical model behind EMDR, the adaptive 
information  processing  model  (AIP),  suggests  that 
‘dysfunctionally  stored’  memories  may  have  an  atio-
logical  and  maintaining  role  for  a  broad  spectrum  of 
symptoms and problems, not limited to PTSD (Hase, 

Balmaceda, Ostacoli, Liebermann, & Hofmann, 2017; 
Shapiro,  2018).  Desensitization  and  reprocessing  of 
these  disturbing  memories  and  images  with  EMDR 
will result in reduction of the vividness and emotion-
ality of unpleasant mental representations (Gunter & 
Bodner, 2008).

Up  to  date  it  is  unknown  if  there  might  be 
a  connection  between  misophonia  symptoms  and 
related  disturbing  experiences  or  memories.  Only 
one case description found a decrease in misophonia 
symptoms  after  EMDR  treatment  (Vollbehr  &  ten 
Broeke,  2017).  When  relevant  memories  are  found 
a  trauma-focused  approach  such  as  EMDR  therapy 
could reduce misophonia symptoms. This pilot study 
aimed  first  to  identify  relevant  experiences  related  to 
misophonia  symptoms  and  secondly to  reduce miso-
phonia  symptoms  with  EMDR  therapy  for  reproces-
sing  maladaptive  implicit  memories.  Therefore,  with 
this pilot study we assess the feasibility and prelimin-
ary  effectiveness  of  EMDR  in  reducing  misophonia 
symptoms and improving general mental functioning 
and quality of life.

2. Methods

The study site was the outpatient clinic of the depart-
ment  of  psychiatry  of  the  Amsterdam  University 
Medical  Center  (Amsterdam  UMC,  location  AMC, 
the  Netherlands).  All  patients  gave  written  informed 
consent. The study was approved by the AMC medical 
ethics  committee  and  carried  out  in  accordance  with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.1. Participant selection, recruitment, and 
enrolment

A total of 14 patients were selected from September 2015 
to July 2017 from the outpatient clinic at the Amsterdam 
UMC (see Figure 1). All patients were referred by their 
General  Practitioners  for  treatment  of  invalidating

misophonia  symptoms.  All  had  received  a  psychiatric 
assessment  at  our  clinic.  Presence  of  comorbid  Axis 
I  disorders  according  to  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-IV-TR)  diagnostic 
criteria  was  validated  at  baseline  by  the  MINI- 
International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  Plus  (MINI- 
plus)  (Sheehan  et  al.,  1997;  Sheehan  et  al.,  1998;  Van 
Vliet & De Beurs, 2007).

Recruited patients were either on the waiting list for 
treatment  or  non-responders  to  CBT.  Ten  subse-
quently  referred  patients,  who  were  most  recently 
added  to  the  waiting  list,  were  approached  in  order 
of  registration.  Six  were  included,  four  patients  were 
not willing to participate. We also included four non- 
responders;  patients  who  completed  CBT  without 
positive  results  at  the  AMC  in  the  period  of  this 
study and searched for help and further treatment.

Inclusion  criteria  were  diagnosis  of  misophonia 
(Schröder  et  al.,  2013)  and  aged  between  18  and 
65  years.  Exclusion  criteria  were:  previous  EMDR 
treatment for misophonia, the presence of depression 
and  anxiety  disorder  as  a  primary  diagnosis,  bipolar 
disorder, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia or 
any other psychotic disorder, substance-related disor-
der  during  the  past  6  months,  any  structural  central 
nervous system disorder or stroke within the last year, 
currently 
taking  benzodiazepines  or  stimulants, 
patients at risk for suicide and patients with language 
barriers or illiteracy.

2.2. EMDR therapy

The  EMDR  therapy  was  conducted  according  to  the 
standard  eight-phase  protocol  by  Shapiro  using  the 
Dutch  translation  of  the  EMDR  protocol  (De  Jongh 
&  ten  Broeke,  2019;  Shapiro,  2001).  The  standard 
EMDR treatment protocol (Shapiro, 2018) consists of 
the  following  phases:  1.  History  Taking  (including 
discussion  of  the  rationale  for  therapy  and  case  con-
ceptualization/idiographic formulation of the patient’s

difficulties); 2. Preparation (preparation for reproces-
sing  of  target  trauma  memories  and  equipping 
patients  with  strategies  to  better  self-regulate  during 
trauma reprocessing work); 3. Assessment (the identi-
fication  of  a  specific  target  memory/image  as  well  as 
associated negative cognitions, disturbing emotions or 
bodily  sensations;  a  positive  cognition  that  is  prefer-
able  to  the  negative  one  is  also  identified);  4. 
Desensitization and reprocessing (involving the repe-
titive  use  of  bilateral  stimulation,  for  example,  the 
tracking  of  a  moving  object,  while  the  patient  is 
asked to simultaneously focus on the image, the nega-
tive  cognition,  and  the  disturbing  emotion  or  body 
sensation  until  he/she  reports  a  marked  reduction  in 
distress  associated  with 
these  experiences);  5. 
Installation  (in  which  the  patient  is  encouraged  to 
associate the trauma memory with the positive cogni-
tion  previously  identified,  or  a  new  more  adaptive 
positive  cognition);  6.  Body  scan  (designed  to  target 
any  residual  negative/uncomfortable  physical  sensa-
tion  or  bodily  tension  associated  with  the  trauma 
memory);  7.  Closure  (generally  involving  the  use  of 
distress  management  and  tolerance  strategies  before 
the  end  of  the  session);  8.  Re-evaluation  (where  the 
patient  and  therapist  reassess  the  previous  target  to 
evaluate  whether  additional  work  is  necessary  before 
proceeding further with the intervention).

in 

The  memories  EMDR  focused  on  were  identified 
(phase  1)  following  a  standardized  search  strategy 
called time-line path in the first session (first method; 
de Jongh et al., 2010). This strategy is used for a broad 
spectrum  of  symptoms  beyond  PTSD  and  helps  to 
develop  a  case  conceptualization 
terms  of 
a relationship between memories of significant events, 
on  one  hand,  and  clients'  current  symptoms,  on  the 
other hand. It is also suggested for the case conceptua-
lization  for  EMDR  for  misophonia  (Vollbehr  &  ten 
Broeke,  2017).  The  time-line  path  deals  with  symp-
toms whereby memories of the aetiological and aggra-
vating events can be specified on a time line. For this 
pilot study, the main questions of the therapist were: 
‘When did your misophonia symptoms start and when 
did they get worse?’. The events or experiences found 
were  target  memories  for  EMDR  and  processed  with 
EMDR.  The  order  of  targets  was  set;  starting  with 
targets that were related to the onset of the misopho-
nia symptoms and subsequently, the memories of the 
events after which symptoms worsened. For all iden-
tified events a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUD) 
score  was  given  between  0  and  10  (0  meaning  no 
distress  to  10  meaning  highest  distress)  that  was  felt 
when  the  memory  was  kept  in  mind.  Hereafter,  the 
standard  protocol  was  first  applied  to  the  first  target 
memory in time. A substantial reduction in SUD was 
required  to  move  to  the  next  memory.  In  all  the 
following  sessions,  memories  were  processed.  Eye 
movements were applied as a dual-attention stimulus. 

Each EMDR session lasted 60–90 minutes. Treatment 
was ended when the Subjective Units of Distress Scale 
(SUD)  score  was  zero  for  all  indexed  misophonia- 
related  memories  identified  on  the  time-line.  All 
patients  were  equally  involved  in  the  eight  phases  of 
the  standard  protocol.  The  total  number  of  sessions 
varied  across  patients  depending  on  the  number  of 
targets and the speed of desensitization.

The  therapist  was  a  licenced  clinical  psychologist 
(IJ)  with  appropriate  training  (level  II  trained)  in 
EMDR and extensive experience in CBT for obsessive- 
compulsive  and  related  disorders  and  misophonia  in 
particular.

2.3. Assessments

Patients were assessed at baseline (T1), and post treat-
ment  (T2).  At  T2  an  independent  assessor  rated  all 
patients  in  a  clinical  interview.  This  independent 
assessor  was  a  cognitive  behavioural  worker  with 
extensive experience in CBT for misophonia.

2.4. Measures

2.4.1. Primary outcomes
Misophonia  symptoms  were  measured  using  the 
revised  Amsterdam  Misophonia  Scale  (AMISOS-R) 
(Schröder  &  Spape,  2014).  It  consists  of  10  items 
with scores ranging from 0 to 40. Higher scores indi-
cate more severe misophonia; 0–10: normal to subcli-
nical  misophonia;  11–20:  mild  misophonia;  21–30: 
moderate severe misophonia; 31–40: severe to extreme 
misophonia.  (see  supplementary  appendix).  This 
improved  version  of  the  A-MISO-S  (Schröder  et  al., 
2013)  is  in  the  process  of  validation;  Preliminary 
results  of  the  validation  show  reliability  of  the  scale 
was  good  (α  = 
its  validity 
(r = .87, p < .01).

.84),  as  well  as 

The  co-primary  outcome  was  CGI-Improvement 
(CGI-I)  (Guy,  1976)  as  objective  observer  ratings. 
The  CGI-I  consists  of  one  question:  ‘Compared  to 
the  patient’s  condition  at  admission  to  the  project 
this  patient’s  condition  is:  1  =  very  much  improved 
since the initiation of treatment; 2 = much improved; 
3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change from baseline 
(the  initiation  of  treatment);  5  =  minimally  worse; 
6  =  much  worse;  7  =  very  much  worse  since  the 
initiation of treatment.’

Responses  are  defined  by  a  CGI-I  scale  score  <3, 
usually  used  to  define  response  (Bandelow,  Baldwin, 
Dolberg, Andersen, & Stein, 2006). Full response was 
defined by 25% reduction (or more) in the AMISOS-R 
and a CGI-I score <3. Partial response was defined by 
either a 25% reduction (or more) on the AMISOS-R or 
a CGI-I score <3.

2.4.2. Secondary outcomes
General  mental  dysfunction  was  assessed  with  the 
Symptom  Checklist-90-R  (SCL-90-R;  Arrindell  & 
Ettema, 1986; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973). The 
total score is 90 to 450, with higher scores indicating 
more  general  psychopathology.  Quality  of  life  was 
assessed  with  the  Sheehan  Disability  Scale  (SDS; 
Sheehan,  1983).  The  SDS  has  three  domains;  Work, 
Social and Family, and the range per domain is 0 to 10. 
The total score was 0 to 30, with higher scores indicat-
ing more impairment.

2.4.3. Qualitative outcome
The perceived intensity of disturbance or distress of an 
image or an emotional memory being recalled is mea-
sured  with  the  Subjective  Units  of  Distress  (SUD) 
scale.  This  score  is  indexed  on  an  11-point  Likert 
scale,  ranging  from  0  (‘no  disturbance  at  all’)  to  10 
(‘greatest 
level  of  disturbance’)  (Shapiro,  2018). 
Participants  were  requested  to  indicate  the  SUD 
score verbally to the therapist for all identified events 
at the start, during and after EMDR therapy. The SUD 
scores are displayed at Table 4.

The severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms was 
measured on indication (if the presence of these symp-
toms  was  assumed)  with  the  Impact  of  Events  Scale 
(IES;  Brom  &  Kleber,  1985;  Horowitz,  Wilner,  & 
Alvarez,  1979;  van  der  Ploeg,  Mooren,  Kleber,  van 
der  Velden,  &  Brom,  2004).  The  Impact  of  Events 
Scale  has  two  subscales  (avoidance  and  intrusions) 
and  a  total  score  ranging  from  15  to  60,  with  higher 
scores indicating more PTSD symptoms and a cut-off 
score of 33 or more (Creamer, Bell, & Failla, 2003).

2.4.4. Statistical analysis
Since this is a pilot study no formal sample size calcu-
lations  were  performed.  We  tested  the  decrease  in 
symptom  severity  with  a  paired  t-test;  the dependent 
variable was AMISOS-R total score, and independent 
factors  were  assessments  (T1,  T2).  An  additional 
intention-to-treat  analysis  was  performed,  including 
all patients who received EMDR therapy, irrespective 
of whether they completed the therapy. Missing values 
were  hereby  imputed  by  the  last  observation  carried 
forward (LOCF).

All  analyses  were  all  based  on  2-tailed  t-tests.  For 
both co-primary and secondary outcomes P < .05 was 
considered  to  be  statistically  significant.  All  results 
should  be  considered  as  exploratory.  In  all  analyses

Wilk  and  a  visual  check  of  the  histogram.  Data  were 
analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.

3. Results

3.1. Participant  flow and characteristics

A total of 10 patients (9 [90%] female; mean [SD] age, 
35 [14,53] years) were included (Table 1). Mean (SD) 
age  of  onset  was  13.10  (9.75).  Fifty  percent  of  the 
patients  fulfiled  criteria  (measured  with  the  MINI- 
plus)  for  comorbidity  on  Axis  I,  none  of  patients 
suffered  from  comorbid  PTSD,  and  AXIS  II  person-
ality traits were found in 60% of the patients.

In  eight  of  the  10  patients,  misophonia-related 
emotionally disturbing memories were identified; the 
other  two  patients  were  excluded  from  the  study. 
Seven  patients  completed  EMDR-therapy  and  the 
post-treatment  measures.  Only  one  patient  dropped 
out  after  the  first  EMDR  session.  Despite  several 
attempts  to  approach  the  patient,  she  declined  to 
attend  treatment  appointments  and  post-treatment 
measures were missing.

3.2. Primary  outcomes

On  average,  2.6  sessions  of  EMDR  were  provided  to 
each participant (n = 7). A paired t-test for the com-
pleters  showed  significant  improvement  on  the  pri-
mary  outcome  (−6.14  [MD],  5.34  [SD])  on  the 
AMISOS-R  (P  =  .023)  (Tables  2  and  3).  On  average, 
the  AMISOS-R  total  scores  were  reduced  by  20%.  In 
Figure 2 the decrease in AMISOS-R is shown for the 
completers.  An  additional  intention-to-treat  analysis 
showed  the  same  significant  difference  and  direction 
of  the  effect  on  the  AMISOS-R  (−5.37  [MD],  5.40 
[SD], P = .026).

Three patients (#3, #7, #9) were found to be clini-
cally improved, two of them with much improvement 
(CGI-I  <  3).  One  patient  (#4),  who  showed  large 
improvement on the AMISOS-R, was not considered

3.3. Secondary outcomes

No  significant  effect  was  found  on  secondary  out-
comes  (see  Tables  2  and  3).  However,  SCL-90 
mean  scores  decreased  with  33%  and  patients 
reported  fewer  disabilities  in  all  SDS  subscales 
(work, family and social functioning) after EMDR- 
therapy.

In one patient who experienced neglect and aggres-
sion  as  negative  childhood  experiences,  the  IES  was 
administered  pre-  and  post-treatment.  The  scores  of 
23  (pre)  to  3  (post)  were  mild  and  not  indicative  for 
PTSD.  The  difference  in  total  score  between  pre  and 
post  was  large,  but  IES  was  not  used  as  an  outcome 
measure in this study.

3.4. Qualitative  outcomes: misophonia-related 
memories

In  total  14  target  misophonia-related  memories 
were  identified  in  eight  patients,  of  which  seven 
reported  one  or  two  targets  and  one  patient 
reported  three  targets  (for  an  overview  of  the  tar-
gets,  see  Table  4).  The  number  of  EMDR  sessions 
varied  from  1  to  4  sessions  of  60–90  minutes. 
Subjective  Units  of  Distress  (SUD)  Scale  scores  at 
the  start  of  the  EMDR  therapy  varied  from  5  to  10 
and  at  the  end  of  the  therapy  all  SUD  scores  were 
decreased  to  0.  Two  examples  of  target  memories 
are: firstly, as an 11-year-old girl on holiday sharing 
a  tent  with  her  father,  she  had  a  panic  attack  after

hyper  focusing  on  his  snoring  with  the  experience 
she  could  not  escape  from  the  tent  in  the  middle of 
the  night  (negative  cognition:  ‘I  am  powerless’). 
Secondly,  as  a  10-year-old  girl  who  could  not 
grieve  at  her  grandmother’s  funeral,  because  she 
was  so  bothered  by  the  breathing  sound  of  her 
crying  brother  that  she  snubbed  him  and  felt  terri-
ble  about  herself  (negative  cognition:  ‘I  am  a  bad 
person’).

3.5. Adverse events and side effects

No  adverse  events  were  reported.  Three  patients 
showed  misophonia  symptoms  during  EMDR  (e.g. 
expressing  anger  in  reaction  to  the  ticking  of  the 
clock  or  to  breathing  sounds  of  the  therapist).  Other 
mild side effects included fatigue or headaches in three 
patients,  lasting  for  two  days  maximum.  One  patient 
suffered  from  suicidal  ideations  with  intrusions  of 
suicide during EMDR treatment after the first session. 
After the second EMDR session, the suicidal ideations 
disappeared. In the end, this patient (#3) profited most 
of all patients from EMDR.

4. Discussion

This is the first clinical sample study which examines 
the feasibility and effectiveness of EMDR for misopho-
nia  in  eight  patients.  The  results  showed  that  EMDR 
focused on desensitizing emotionally disturbing mem-
ories related to the onset or worsening of misophonia 
symptoms and significantly reduced these symptoms.
Our positive outcome is in line with the results of 
the  case  report  of  Vollbehr  and  ten  Broeke  (2017). 
However, comparisons with their findings is difficult, 
because  pre-  and  post-treatment  assessments  were 

missing  and  extra  targets  were  used  during  EMDR 
therapy. Nevertheless, though no questionnaires were 
administered, Vollbehr and ten Broeke observed alle-
viation  of  symptoms  of  misophonia  without  full 
remission. Their patient was still sensitive to misopho-
nia triggers, but his/her emotional reaction and avoid-
ance  behaviour  diminished  substantially.  Apart  from 
desensitization  of  the  identified  misophonia-related 
target  memories,  their  patient  was  also  instructed  to 
create an extremely inflated image of present triggers 
in  imagination,  after  which  desensitization  of  this 
image  took  place  (Shapiro,  2018).  In  our  study,  no 
present triggers, nor an inflated image of present trig-
gers  were  targeted.  However,  after  having  treated  all 
misophonia-related target memories, the ‘future tem-
plate’  procedure  was  used  (Shapiro,  2018)  to  help 
patients  visualizing  successfully  managing  an  antici-
pated future event with misophonia triggers.

In  our trial,  for two  out  of  10 patients,  no  explicit 
disturbing  misophonia-related  memories  could  be 
identified. For the remaining patients, their memories 
of  the  first  (onset)  misophonic  experience  and/or 
aggravating  experiences  were  treated.  The  nature  of 
these experiences were not evidently traumatic (corre-
sponding to Criterion A of the DSM 5 PTSD criteria; 
American Psychiatric Association, 2013). They may be 
classified as unpleasant and disturbing, as is described 
in  previous  clinical  case  series  (Ferreira,  Harrison,  & 
Fontenelle,  2013;  Johnson  et  al.,  2013).  Target  mem-
ories related to the onset or worsening of misophonia 
in  childhood  consisted  in  our  pilot  of  situations  of 
fierce  arguments  caused  by  their  misophonia,  mala-
daptive coping incidents such as bulimic outrage, sui-
cidal  ideations,  or  panic  attacks  when  misophonia 
triggers  could  not  be  avoided  (feeling  overwhelmed 
and  powerless).  Target  memories  of  the  two  full

responders  were  easier  to  identify  with  the  time-line 
method  and  had  a  higher  level  of  observed  distress 
than  in  the  other  patients.  This  could  be  one  of  the 
reasons  why  EMDR  was  more  successful  in  these 
cases,  as  it  is  known  that  EMDR  is  more  effective 
when the level of disturbance at the start of the session 
is  high  (Littel,  Remijn,  Tinga,  Engelhard,  &  van  den 
Hout, 2017). We did not examine predictors of treat-
ment  outcomes  because  of  the  small  sample,  but  we 
hypothesize that the nature of target memories, parti-
cipant  characteristics  or  type  of  misophonia  symp-
toms  such  as  disgust,  might  predict  treatment 
outcomes. Hypothesizing about a treatment mechan-
ism is beyond the scope of this article.

Since  we  used  only  the  time-line  procedure  to 
identify  the  target-memories  for  EMDR  therapy,  it 
remains  unclear  whether  the  two  patients  without 
target  memories  could  have  benefitted  from  EMDR. 
It would be interesting to add more explicit desensiti-
zation of ‘present triggers’ following desensitization of 
misophonia-related target memories, or use the crea-
tion of an extremely inflated image of present triggers 
(Rijkeboer,  ten  Broeke,  &  Koekbakker,  2016).  We 
advise clinicians working with patients with misopho-
nia to select and desensitize different types of targets, 
such  as  past  traumatic  or  disturbing  events,  present 
triggers (e.g. inflated image), and future targets as well.
Treatment options are still limited for misophonia. 
So far, the only well-studied intervention for misopho-
nia is G-CBT (Jager et al., 2020b; Schröder et al., 2017). 
Compared to the results of the recent RCT of G-CBT, 
EMDR  was  less  effective  with  a  decrease  of  −6.14  vs 
−9.7  points  (G-CBT)  on  the  AMISOS-R  post  treat-
ment,  respectively,  though  an  equal  percentage  of 
patients clinically improved, 38% with EMDR vs 37% 
with G-CBT on the CGI-I post treatment (Jager et al., 
2020b).

G-CBT  and  EMDR  both  have  pros  and  cons. 
G-CBT  as  a  multicomponent  intervention  offers 
more  techniques  from  which  patients  can  profit, 
extensive  psychoeducation,  more  opportunity  to 
practice  under  guidance,  peer  support,  and  sup-
port  of  loved  ones.  The  empirical  level  of  evidence 
is  higher  for  G-CBT  including  a  RCT  with  one 
1-year  follow-up,  no  adverse  events  were  reported 
and  patient’s  acceptability  is  high  (Jager  et  al., 
2020b;  Schröder  et  al.,  2017).  In  this  pilot  study, 
EMDR  therapy  time  was  limited  by  a  mean  of  2.6 
sessions of 1 to 1.5 hours (mean total of 3.9 hours) 
versus 8 (group) sessions of CBT of 3 hours (mean 
total  of  24  hours)  and  could  therefore  be  more 
cost-effective. As  a con,  apart from this case  study, 
there  is  no empirical  evidence  for its  effectivity. So 
far,  indication  to  use  EMDR  was  conditional, 
depending  on  the  presence  of  emotionally  disturb-
ing  target  memories  related  to  the  onset  or  wor-
sening  of  the  symptoms.

Our results suggest as well that EMDR is an attrac-
tive alternative for non-responders to G-CBT. In this 
pilot  study,  patients  on  the  waiting  list  for  G-CBT 
(n  =  6)  and  non-responders  to  G-CBT  (n  =  4)  were 
included.  Patients  from  both  groups  profited  from 
EMDR  (one  patient  waiting  for  CBT  and  2  non- 
responders),  but  no  post-hoc  analyses  could  be  per-
formed  because  of  the  small  sample  size.  We  might 
speculate in which cases EMDR or G-CBT should be 
considered.  First,  EMDR  might  be  preferred  in  cases 
where  clear  and  emotionally  disturbing  target  mem-
ories  for  EMDR  can  be  identified.  Secondly,  when 
therapists  can  not  provide  (G-)CBT  or  patients  are 
reluctant  to  participate  in  group  therapy.  Finally,  if 
patients are in need of a quick fix for example, when 
a  final  exam  in  2  weeks  is  hindered  by  misophonia 
symptoms.

4.1. Limitations and strengths

This is a small case series without a control group and 
therefore  our  study  suffers  from  several  important 
limitations.  The  lack  of  a  control  group  prevents  us 
from assessing the effects of time and of non-specific 
factors  on  misophonia  symptoms.  The  small  sample 
warrants  caution  in  the  generalization  of  the  results. 
There  was  no  follow-up  assessment  since  half  of  the 
patients were on the waiting list for CBT and received 
CBT following EMDR, making it impossible to deter-
mine  whether  treatment  gain  was  maintained  over 
time.  The  inclusion  of  two  subpopulations  can  be 
considered  a 
this  small  sample. 
However, this does resemble clinical practice. All par-
ticipants received EMDR from one therapist, the eva-
luator  was  not  blind  to  treatment  and  treatment 
fidelity measures were not carried out, possibly leading 
to bias. More and larger studies are needed to confirm 
the  effectiveness  of  EMDR  therapy  and  to  determine 
the average number of EMDR sessions needed to sig-
nificantly  reduce  misophonia  symptoms.  Finally, 
because  of  the  small  sample  size,  some  tantalizing 
questions regarding prediction or comparative efficacy 
with CBT could not be answered.

limitation 

in 

On  the  other  hand,  our  study  is  innovative,  and 
the  use  of a  case  series  was  considered appropriate 
given  the  exploratory  nature  of  the  study.  The 
sample  had  baseline  characteristics  comparable  to 
larger  misophonia  samples  (Jager  et  al.,  2020a; 
Rouw  &  Erfanian,  2018), 
leading  to  adequate 
external  validity.  We  used  a  diagnostic  clinical 
interview  to  assess  the  presence  of  disorders,  an 
and 
objective  diagnostic 
a  manualized  treatment.  Data  were  also  analysed 
under  restrictions  of  intention-to-treat  analysis 
and missing values  were  imputed by LOCF,  result-
ing  in  a  conservative  estimation  of  the  effect.

4.2. Conclusions

In  conclusion,  the  results  of  this  study  suggest  that 
EMDR therapy is a promising and time-limited inter-
vention  in  reducing  misophonia  symptoms,  also  in 
patients  who  were  previously  unable  to  benefit  from 
evidence-based treatment (G-CBT). No adverse events 
were reported. Given the limitations due to the study 
design,  the  results  should  be  considered  preliminary. 
The  next  step  would  therefore  be  replication  of  the 
results  in  a  larger  RCT  comparing  EMDR  therapy 
(with  an  extended  target  selection)  with  CBT  and 
a  waiting  list  or  EMDR  therapy  as  an  add-on  inter-
vention to CBT, with a long-term follow-up.
