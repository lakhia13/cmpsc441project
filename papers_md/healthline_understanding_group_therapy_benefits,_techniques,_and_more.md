This article provides an overview of group therapy, including its benefits, what types of conditions it’s best suited for, the different types of groups, and more.


## What are the benefits of group therapy?


First off, group therapy is effective. A2021 articlenotes that 11 analyses of 329 clinical trials involving over 27,000 participants have found that group therapy is just as effective as other treatments formental health conditions.

There are also several unique benefits to group therapy. These are important to be aware of if you’re interested in group therapy as a treatment option.

On a basic level, groups can act as a support network during your therapy journey. For example, groups may:


### Foster feelings of belongingness and acceptance


When you’re living with mental or physical health conditions, it’s easy to feel isolated and alone. Receiving therapy with a group of people experiencing similar things to you can remind you that this isn’t the case.


### Act as a sounding board


People in your group may come from all walks of life and can have a variety of personality types. As a result, you can receive different takes on your situation and input on new ways to deal with challenges.


### Hold you accountable


Group members can hold each other accountable for their actions and how they affect others, helping to promote positive changes and progress.


### Help you embrace different perspectives


Being in a group with different types of people can help you realize that, ultimately, we’re all more similar than we are different.


## What types of conditions are best suited for group therapy?


Group therapymay be helpfulfor the following mental health conditions:

- generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

- post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

- obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

- substance use disorder

- eating disorders

- personality disorders

It’s also possible that you may choose to explore group therapy to help cope withemotional distress. For example, group therapy can be an effective approach for managing emotions likegriefand overwhelmingstress.

Group therapy can also be beneficial for certain medical conditions. For example, it may help address distress in people who’ve beendiagnosed with cancer. It may also aid in managingchronic painas well as the symptoms ofirritable bowel syndrome (IBS).


### When wouldn’t group therapy be recommended?


Sometimes, group therapymaynotbe recommended. This may occur in situations where an individual:

- is very anxious or shy about participating in group sessions

- is experiencing acute mental or emotional distress

- has trouble connecting with and relating to others

- has poor impulse control

- cannot commit to regular group sessions due to their work or life schedule

- is unlikely to comply with the rules or guidelines set out for group therapy


## What are the different types of groups?


When it comes to group therapy, there are a few different group types, as discussed below.


### Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous groups


Homogeneous groups are formed around a specific group of people and typically have a certain focus. To help you get a better idea of this, a few examples are groups for:

- women coping with the effects ofbreast cancerand its treatment

- individuals seeking treatment foralcohol use disorder

- people managinggriefafter losing a loved one

A2021 articlenotes that homogenous groups are more likely to “click” and get to work quickly. This is due to the fact that everyone in the group shares a common situation.

Heterogeneous groups are made up of a variety of different people and may not have as much of a central focus as homogenous groups. In this way, a heterogeneous groupcan help modelwhat we encounter in the outside world.


### Open vs. closed groups


You may start with an open group at any time, meaning that some people will have been in the group longer than others. There may also be an adjustment period as everyone gets to know new group members.

In a closed group, everyone starts at the same time. Closed groups are typically part of a specific treatment plan, such as participating in regular sessions over a defined 8-week period.


### Small vs. large groups


As we mentioned earlier, group therapy typically involves5 to 15 people. There are pros and cons to small versus large groups.

Smaller groups can allow more time for each person in the group, but there may be less variety in experiences and perspectives. Meanwhile, larger groups allow for this, but there may be less time for each person to join the discussion.


## What are the different techniques used for group therapy?
