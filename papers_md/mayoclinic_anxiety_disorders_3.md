You may start by seeing your primary care provider to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. He or she can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment.

However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy).

To help diagnose an anxiety disorder, your mental health provider may:

- Discuss your thoughts, feelings and behaviors when you feel anxious.

- Ask about other mental health problems, such as depression or alcohol or drug misuse, which can happen along with anxiety. This can make a diagnosis more challenging.

The two main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you.

Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety.

CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms.

Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example:

- Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders.

- An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed.

- In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe other types of medications, such as sedatives, also called benzodiazepines, or beta blockers. These medications are for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and are not intended to be used long term.

Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications.

## Lifestyle and home remedies

While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do:

- Keep physically active.Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities.

- Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.These substances can cause or worsen anxiety. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you.

- Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking caffeinated beverages.Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety.

- Use stress management and relaxation techniques.Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety.

- Make sleep a priority.Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor.

- Eat healthy.Healthy eating — such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish — may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed.

## Alternative medicine

Several herbal remedies have been studied as a treatment for anxiety, but more research is needed to understand the risks and benefits. Herbal and dietary supplements aren't monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Some of these supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions.

Before taking herbal remedies or dietary supplements, talk to your doctor to make sure they're safe for you and won't interact with any medications you take.

## Coping and support

To cope with an anxiety disorder, here's what you can do:

- Learn about your disorder.Talk to your doctor or mental health provider. Find out what might be causing your specific condition and what treatments might be best for you. Involve your family and friends and ask for their support.

- Stick to your treatment plan.Take medications as directed. Keep therapy appointments and complete any assignments your therapist may give you. Consistency can make a big difference, especially when it comes to taking your medication.

- Take action.Learn what triggers your anxiety or causes you stress. Practice the strategies you developed with your mental health provider so you're ready to deal with anxious feelings in these situations.

- Keep a journal.Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health provider identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.

- Join an anxiety support group.Remember that you aren't alone. Support groups offer compassion, understanding and shared experiences. The National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America provide information on finding support.

- Learn time management techniques.You can reduce anxiety by learning how to carefully manage your time and energy.

- Socialize.Don't let worries isolate you from loved ones or activities.

- Break the cycle.When you feel anxious, take a brisk walk or delve into a hobby to refocus your mind away from your worries.

## Preparing for your appointment
