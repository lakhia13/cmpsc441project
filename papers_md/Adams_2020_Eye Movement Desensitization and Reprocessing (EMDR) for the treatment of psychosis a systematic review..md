HIGHLIGHTS
(cid:129) EMDR was associated with
reductions in paranoid
thinking, auditory
hallucinations, delusional
and negative symptoms of
psychosis.
(cid:129) EMDR was also associated
with more remissions from
psychotic disorders, and
considerably fewer
readmissions to hospital at
2-year follow-up.

ABSTRACT
Background: Psychosis is a public health concern. There is increasing evidence suggesting
trauma can play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of psychosis. Eye
Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an effective treatment for trauma
and could be a vital addition to the treatment of psychosis.
Objective: To explore the evidence for EMDR as a treatment for psychosis, focussing on the
safety, effectiveness and acceptability of this intervention for this population.
Methods: Four databases (Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE PsychINFO), and the Francine
Shapiro Library were systematically searched, along with grey literature and reference lists
of relevant papers. No date limits were applied as this is an area of emerging evidence.
Studies were screened for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included
studies were quality assessed and data was extracted from the individual studies, and
synthesized using a narrative synthesis approach.
Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria (1 RCT, 2 Pilot studies, 2 Case series and 1 Case
report). Across the studies EMDR was associated with reductions in delusional and negative
symptoms, mental health service and medication use. Evidence for reductions in auditory
hallucinations and paranoid thinking was mixed. No adverse events were reported, although
initial increases in psychotic symptoms were observed in two studies. Average dropout rates
across the studies were comparable to other trauma-focused treatments for PTSD. The
acceptability of EMDR was not adequately measured or reported.
Conclusion: EMDR appears a safe and feasible intervention for people with psychosis. The
evidence is currently insufficient to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of the
intervention for this population. Larger confirmative trials are required to form more robust
conclusions.

Desensibilización y reprocesamiento por movimientos oculares
(EMDR) para el tratamiento de la psicosis: Una revisión sistemática
Antecedentes: La psicosis es un problema de salud pública. Cada vez hay más evidencia
sugiriendo que el trauma puede desempeñar un papel fundamental en el desarrollo
y mantenimiento de la psicosis. La desensibilización y reprocesamiento por movimiento
ocular (EMDR en su sigla en inglés) es un tratamiento efectivo para el trauma y podría ser
una adición vital al tratamiento de la psicosis.
Objetivo: explorar el evidencia de EMDR como tratamiento para la psicosis, enfocándose en
la seguridad, efectividad y aceptabilidad de esta intervención para esta población.
Métodos: Se realizaron búsquedas sistemáticas en cuatro bases de datos (Cochrane,
EMBASE, MEDLINE PsychINFO) y la Biblioteca Francine Shapiro, junto con literatura gris
y listas de referencias de artículos relevantes. No se aplicaron límites de fecha ya que esta es
un área con evidencia emergente. Los estudios se seleccionaron determinando su elegibi-
lidad según los criterios de inclusión y exclusión. Los estudios incluidos fueron evaluados de
acuerdo a su calidad y los datos se extrajeron de los estudios individuales y se sintetizaron
utilizando un enfoque de síntesis narrativa.
Resultados: Seis estudios cumplieron los criterios de inclusión (1 ensayo controlado alea-
torio, 2 estudios piloto, 2 series de casos y 1 informe de caso). En todos los estudios, EMDR
se asoció con reducciones en los síntomas delirantes y negativos, el servicio de salud mental
y el uso de medicamentos. La evidencia de reducciones en las alucinaciones auditivas y el
pensamiento paranoico fue mixta. No se informaron eventos adversos, aunque se obser-
varon aumentos iniciales en los síntomas psicóticos en dos estudios. Las tasas promedio de
abandono en los estudios fueron comparables a otros tratamientos centrados en el trauma
para el TEPT. La aceptabilidad de EMDR no se midió ni informó adecuadamente.
Conclusión: EMDR parece una intervención segura y factible para personas con psicosis. La
evidencia es actualmente insuficiente para determinar la efectividad y la aceptabilidad de la
intervención para esta población. Se requieren ensayos confirmatorios más grandes para
formar conclusiones más sólidas.

眼动脱敏与再加工 (EMDR) 治疗精神病:一项系统综述
背景: 精神病是一个公共卫生问题。越来越多的证据表明, 创伤可以在精神病的发展和维
持中起关键作用。眼动脱敏与再加工 (EMDR) 是一种针对创伤的有效疗法, 可能是精神病
治疗方法的一个重要补充。本综述探究了EMDR作为精神病治疗方法的证据, 重点关注了
此干预措施对精神病群体的安全性, 有效性和可接受性。
目的: 探索 EMDR作为精神病治疗的证据, 重点在于安全性, 有效性和 此干预措施对此人群
的可接受性。
方法: 系统搜索了四个数据库 (Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE 和PsychINFO), Francine Shapiro
图书馆, 以及灰色文献和相关论文的参考文献。没有设置日期限制, 因为这是一个新兴证
据领域。根据入组和排除标准对各研究的资格进行筛选。对纳入的研究进行质量评估, 从
单个研究中提取数据, 并使用叙述性综合法进行综合处理。
结果: 6项研究符合纳入标准 (1项RCT, 2项试点研究, 2项病例研究和1例病例报告) 。在整个研
究中, EMDR与妄想和消极症状, 精神卫生服务和药物使用的减少有关。幻听和偏执思维减少
的证据混杂。尽管在两项研究中观察到精神病性症状最初有所增加, 但未报告不良事件。各
研究的平均流失率与其他PTSD聚焦创伤疗法相当。 EMDR的可接受性没有得到充分的测量
或报告。
结论: EMDR对于精神病患者似乎是一种安全可行的干预措施。当前证据不足以确定对该群
体进行干预的有效性和可接受性。需要更大规模的验证性试验才能得出更可靠的结论。

1. Introduction

symptoms

The prevalence of psychotic
indicates
a potential public health concern (Nuevo et al., 2012). It
is estimated that around one in 150 people will receive
a diagnosis for a psychotic disorder during their lifetime
(Moreno-Kustner, Martin, & Pastor, 2018), and the total
societal cost
for psychosis is anticipated to rise to
£6.5 billion by 2026 (Kings Fund, 2008). The cause of
psychosis is currently unclear and probably multi-
faceted. However, there is increasing evidence indicating
that
trauma experienced during childhood can play
a pivotal role in the development and perpetuation of
psychotic symptoms (Hardy, 2017; Varese et al., 2012).
The literature suggests that exposure to traumatic experi-
ences such as, physical abuse, bullying, sexual abuse, and
neglect may culminate in negative beliefs about the self,
others and the world. These beliefs can lead to viewing the
self as vulnerable, and the perception that ordinary events
are threatening, resulting in psychotic symptoms such as,
paranoia and distorted perceptions of regular stimuli
(Kelleher et al., 2013). Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an effective treatment for
trauma (Shapiro, 1995, 2018), which aims to desensitize
discomfort caused by traumatic experiences and reprocess
them within the individual’s autobiographical memory
which can achieve symptom relief (Hardy, 2017; van der
Vleugel, van den Berg, & Staring, 2012). Increasing evi-
dence acknowledging the relationship between trauma
and psychosis indicates that EMDR could be a vital addi-
tion to the treatment of psychosis (Sin & Spain, 2017;
Valiente-Gomez et al., 2017).

Antipsychotic medication is regarded as the corner-
stone of treatment for psychosis (Jones et al., 2006).
However, it is reported that around 50% of people being
treated with antipsychotic medication continue to experi-
ence distressing psychotic symptoms (Pankey & Hayes,
2003); and non-adherence to antipsychotic medication
owing to intolerable side effects and poor efficacy contri-
butes significantly to relapse and readmission for people

with a psychotic disorder (Haywood et al., 1995). Adding
psychological therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy (CBT), alongside antipsychotic medication is
now common practice, and their addition has demon-
strated their potential as an effective treatment for psycho-
sis (Hazell, Haywood, Cavanagh, & Strauss, 2016; Lutgens,
Gariepy, & Malla, 2017). Although CBT appears to be
beneficial there is limited evidence regarding its clinical
significance over treatment as usual for preventing relapse
for people with psychosis (Jauhar et al., 2014; Morrison
et al., 2018). There is room for future research into the
treatment of the trauma experiences for people with psy-
chosis, such as EMDR, that could be used as an alternative,
or adjunctive, to current treatments.

Recent systematic reviews evaluating a range of
trauma-focussed therapies (TFTs) in people with psy-
chosis provide preliminary support for the usefulness
and safety of TFTs for the treatment of trauma-
associated symptoms of psychosis, and promising
effects for the positive symptoms of psychosis (Brand
& McEnery, 2018; Swan, Keen, Reynolds, & Onwumere,
2017; Sin & Spain, 2017; Valiente-Gomez et al., 2017).
Current literature also suggests that adding TFTs to
treatment for people with a psychotic disorder and co-
morbid PTSD can generate better quality of life, and
reduce costs from shorter hospital admissions than the
current standard treatment for psychosis (de Bont et al.,
2019). Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was
to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of
EMDR as a treatment for people with psychosis.

2. Methods

2.1. Protocol and registration

This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analysis (PRISMA)
guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009),
and the protocol was registered with PROSPERO
(CRD42018106756).

2.2. Literature search

2.4. Quality assessment

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

Four databases were searched from their year of inception
to July 2018: Cochrane, EMBASE via OvidSP, MEDLINE
via OvidSP, PsychINFO via OvidSP. Grey literature was
searched using the Francine Shapiro Library (FSL), and
other Grey literature sites (OpenGrey, www.who.int/trial
search and www.clinicaltrials.gov) were searched for any
unpublished studies, dissertations, or theses to minimize
publication bias (Higgins & Green, 2011). The FSL is
a collection of scholarly articles, conference presenta-
tions, and other relevant writings relating to EMDR.
The final search strategies were developed using key
terms:
and
Reprocessing OR EMDR) AND (Psycho* OR Schizo*
OR Delusion* OR Hallucination*). The full search strat-
egy used for MEDLINE can be seen in the supplementary
material (Table S1). The FSL does not allow for the use of
truncation symbols or multi-term searching, and so all
key terms were searched separately. This topic is in its
infancy as individuals with psychotic disorders are almost
always excluded from studies involving effective trauma
treatments, due to fear of exacerbating their symptoms
(Ronconi, Shiner, & Watts, 2014). Therefore, no date
limits were applied in order to yield a sufficient number
of results.

(Eye Movement

Desensiti*ation

Reference lists of relevant retrieved papers were
screened for additional studies, along with reference
lists within the book ‘EMDR Therapy for Schizophrenia
and other Psychoses’ by Miller (2016). After the searches
were complete a new follow-up paper from one of the
included studies was published and included in the
results (van den Berg et al., 2018).

2.3.

Inclusion criteria

The final selection of papers was based on the follow-
ing inclusion criteria:

● Participants of any age and diagnosed with a psy-
chotic disorder; or mental health disorder where
psychotic features were present and measured.
● Studies using a recognized EMDR protocol.
● Studies using EMDR alone, or in combination

with treatment as usual (TAU).

● Studies reporting the effect of EMDR on psy-

chotic symptoms.

● Studies written in English language at full text.
● Studies conducted using any research design
including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed
methods methodologies, with or without control
groups.

The quality of the studies did not influence the inclusion
criteria, but the strengths and weaknesses of the indivi-
dual studies were drawn upon to inform the discussion.
Due to the variance in study designs, three different
quality assessment tools to aid this process were required
to suit the needs of all the studies included.

The Cochrane ‘Risk of Bias assessment tool’ was used
to determine the methodological quality of the included
clinical trials (Higgins & Green, 2011). Case series and
case reports were assessed using The Joanna Briggs
Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklists for case series
and case reports (Aromataris & Munn, 2017). An over-
all judgement of the methodological quality was made
based on the questions from the checklists that are most
important for the specific cases.

If information was not found in included papers it
was sought from adjoining publications, or by con-
tacting the primary authors. Judgements of quality
were summarized in the results section.

2.5. Data extraction

Data was systematically extracted onto an Excel spread-
sheet tailored to the review question. Data extracted
included: authors, year of publication, country, study
design, study setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria,
sample size, method of randomization, description of
the intervention, fidelity checks, control/comparator
group, outcome measures, length of follow- up, results
and any conclusions drawn. Attempts were made to
contact primary authors to obtain any missing data.
de Bont et al.’s (2016) publication does not report all
the necessary information relating to the trial design.
Therefore, earlier publications reporting the same study
(de Bont et al., 2013a; van den Berg et al., 2015) were
referred to for the relevant information. The extracted
data was tabulated and examined for heterogeneity.

2.6. Data analysis

A Narrative Synthesis was performed following gui-
dance from Petticrew and Roberts (2008). The studies
were described and organized into logical categories
based on the study design. The findings were then
analysed within the individual categories, and then
synthesized across all categories.

3. Results

The decision to include a wide range of designs
including those often considered less rigorous was
based on the need to provide a comprehensive repre-
sentation of this novel area of emerging evidence.

A total of 487 potentially relevant papers were yielded
through searching the four databases
(Cochrane,
EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO), and the Francine
Shapiro Library. No additional relevant papers were

4

identified via reference list, or grey literature searching.
After duplicates were removed, a total of 424 citation and
abstracts were screened simultaneously for relevance. At
this stage, 404 records were excluded leaving 20 papers to
be screened at full-text for inclusion in the review.
Fourteen papers were excluded with reasons detailed in
Figure 1, leaving a total of six papers which met the
inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

3.1. Quality assessment

3.1.1. Quality of the included clinical trials
The overall quality of the three trials is limited (see
Table 1). de Bont et al.’s (2016) Randomized controlled
trial (RCT) is of the highest quality. de Bont et al.’s (2016)
publication does not report all information relating to the
trial design, therefore, earlier publications reporting the
same study were referred to for the quality assessment
(de Bont et al., 2013a; van den Berg et al., 2015).

Only one trial reported a suitable method of rando-
mization (de Bont et al., 2016), and one was an open
trial and did not randomize at all (van den Berg & van
der Gaag, 2012). Only de Bont et al. (2016) reported
a form of allocation concealment. All studies had small
sample sizes with insufficient power for the statistical
tests necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of EMDR.

3.1.2. Quality of case series and case report
The overall quality of McGoldrick, Begum, and
Brown’s (2008) case series and Laugharne, Marshall,
Laugharne, and Hassard’s (2014) four vignettes was
deemed adequate according to the JBI checklist (see
Figure S1 in the supplementary material). However,
neither reported complete inclusion of all people who
were treated, and further selection bias occurred in
both as they only reported cases that they believed
had benefited from EMDR treatment. Kratzer, Heinz,
and Schennach’s (2017) case report is of high quality
according to the JBI checklist (see Figure S2 in the
supplementary material).

3.2. Overview of studies

The six included studies were published between 2008
and 2017 and evaluated EMDR for the psychological
treatment of people with psychotic symptoms. Two
studies were conducted in the UK (McGoldrick et al.,
2008; Laugharne, Marshall, Laugharne, & Hassard,
2014), two in the Netherlands (de Bont et al., 2016;
van den Berg & van der Gaag, 2012), and one in
Germany (Kratzer et al., 2017) and south Korea
(Kim et al., 2010). The study characteristics including
the outcomes can be seen in Table 2.

3.2.1. Study design
The included study designs comprised of an RCT (de
Bont et al., 2016); two case series, both including four
individual cases (McGoldrick et al., 2008; Laugharne
et al., 2014); one single case report (Kratzer et al., 2017)
and two pilot studies, one used an RCT design (Kim
et al., 2010), and the other was an open trial with only
one arm (van den Berg & van der Gaag, 2012).

3.2.2. Sample
A total
sample of 236 adult participants were
included in this review, with 106 of those participants
treated with EMDR and 130 participating within the
control or comparator groups. Sample sizes for the
trials ranged from 27 to 155. Participants had a range
of psychotic disorders across all of the studies includ-
ing: schizophrenia; schizoaffective disorder; delu-
reference
sional
syndrome (ORS), mood disorders including bipolar
disorder with psychotic features, and psychotic dis-
orders otherwise unspecified.

disorders

olfactory

3.2.3. EMDR
Five studies reported using Shapiro’s (2001) standard
eight-phase EMDR protocol for the treatment of psy-
chotic symptoms. The amount of EMDR sessions
varied from one session (McGoldrick et al., 2008
(cases 1 and 4) to 10 sessions (Kratzer et al., 2017).
Only two studies reported treatment fidelity checks to
ensure EMDR was conducted and administered as
intended (de Bont et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2010).
Details of the fidelity checks can be seen in the
supplementary material (Table S2).

The focus of EMDR differed amongst the studies. In
three of the studies EMDR was used to treat Symptoms
of PTSD in participants with a psychotic disorder by
targeting and reprocessing traumatic life experiences
that appeared to have caused the current PTSD (de
Bont et al., 2016; Laugharne et al., 2014; van den Berg
& van der Gaag, 2012). Kratzer et al.’s (2017) study also
evaluated EMDR for the treatment PTSD in a person
with a psychotic disorder, however, they also used
EMDR to specifically reduce psychotic symptoms by
targeting and processing hallucinations associated with
the participants dysfunctional beliefs about the self and
the world. In one study EMDR was used to treat ORS by
targeting the life experiences that triggered the disorder
(McGoldrick et al., 2008). In another study EMDR was
used to treat the acute phase of schizophrenia and the
targets of EMDR were arbitrary and less specific than
the other studies (Kim et al., 2010).

3.2.4. Additional treatment
In all of the studies EMDR was provided alongside
TAU. For the studies with participants based in the
community settings this mainly consisted of psycho-
tropic medications (de Bont et al., 2016; Laugharne

R. ADAMS ET AL.

et al., 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2008; van den Berg &
van der Gaag, 2012). For the studies with participants
based in inpatient settings TAU consisted of psycho-
tropic medication, group therapies such as art and
exercise therapy, mindfulness and individual psy-
chotherapy (Kratzer et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2010).

3.2.5. Outcome measures
Four studies reported outcomes from structured clinical
interviews using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
(PANSS; Kay, Opler, & Fiszbein, 1986) and/or the
Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS; Haddock,
McCarron, Tarrier, & Faragher, 1999). Two studies used
the Greens Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS; Green et al.,
2008), which is a self-report measure used to assess the
severity of a person’s paranoid thoughts.

3.3. Results from clinical trials

two trials

All three trials found an association between EMDR
and a decrease in psychotic symptoms in different
study populations and with different EMDR therapy
objectives. Kim et al. (2010) found all
treatment
groups improved significantly over time on all mea-
sures for people in an acute phase of schizophrenia,
however, EMDR was not shown to be superior to
PMR or TAU at 3- month follow-up. In respect to
psychotic symptoms,
found opposing
results for paranoid thinking according to GPTS
scores and auditory hallucinations according to
AHRS scores. de Bont et al. (2016) found significant
reductions in paranoid thinking, but auditory hallu-
cinations remained unchanged across all groups,
when treating PTSD in people with chronic psychotic
disorders. Whereas, van den Berg and van der Gaag
(2012) found small statistically significant improve-
ments in delusions and auditory hallucinations, but
did not produce a significant effect on paranoid idea-
tion, when treating people with psychosis and
a comorbid PTSD.

de Bont et al. (2016) were able to demonstrate that
EMDR was superior to the waitlist control according
to GPTS scores at post-treatment and 6-month follow-
up. However, both studies with active comparison
groups did not find a significant difference between
the treatment groups (de Bont et al., 2016; Kim et al.,
2010). Participants in the EMDR and PE groups in de
Bont et al.’s (2016) study were significantly associated
with more remissions from psychotic disorders than
the waitlist condition according to SCI-SR-PANSS
scores, however, this was not maintained at 6 or 12-
month follow-up for the EMDR group. Despite no
significant difference between groups for readmission
rates in Kim et al.’s (2010) study, only 18% of partici-
pants in the EMDR group had been readmitted to
hospital at 2-year follow-up, compared with 42% in
the PMR group and 33% in the TAU group.

The average dropout rate for EMDR across all
three trials was 17%, and there was no statistical
difference between groups for attrition in the two
studies using comparison groups (de Bont et al.,
2016; Kim et al., 2010). Participants in Kim et al.’s
(2010) study did not show any exacerbations of any
symptoms due to treatment and no one dropped out
due to a worsening of their condition. In van den
Berg and van der Gaag’s (2012) study, there were
three incidences where participants reported brief
exacerbation of their symptoms due to the EMDR
treatment.

3.4. Results from case series and case report

All cases treated with EMDR in McGoldrick et al.’s
(2008) case series reached complete resolution of
symptoms of ORS which was maintained at follow-
up as long as 10 years (case 1). Kratzer et al.’s (2017)
case report found that the use of EMDR in an inpa-
tient setting for people with psychosis and comorbid
PTSD produced a clinically significant effect on
PANSS- 22 scores, and symptom levels continued to
decrease at 6-month follow-up. Across the case series
and case report EMDR was associated with other
health and well-being benefits including a reduction
in psychotropic medication, improved social and gen-
eral functioning, and a reduction in the use of mental
health services.

Initial

increases in positive psychotic symptoms
were observed in one study (Kratzer et al., 2017). In
Laugharne et al.’s (2014) study one person relapsed
once during a 5-year follow-up (case 2) and one person
relapsed once during a 3-year follow-up after tempora-
rily stopping antipsychotic medication (case 3).

4. Discussion

The use of EMDR was associated with reductions in
delusional and negative symptoms of psychosis (de
Bont et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2010; Kratzer et al., 2017;
Laugharne et al., 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2008; van
den Berg & van der Gaag, 2012), and mixed findings
were associated with auditory hallucinations and
paranoid thinking (de Bont et al., 2016; van den
Berg & van der Gaag, 2012). EMDR was associated
with more remissions from psychotic disorders than
a waitlist condition (de Bont et al., 2016), fewer read-
and
missions
a reduction in the use of mental health services at
follow-up as long as 10 years (McGoldrick et al.,
2008; Laugharne et al., 2014). This review aimed to
evaluate EMDR’s potential as a treatment for psycho-
sis. Theoretically, EMDR should be suitable for any
mental distress with a traumatic antecedent, which
does not need to be of sufficient severity to classify as
PTSD (Shapiro, 1995). There is increasing evidence to

to hospital

al., 2010),

(Kim et

suggest that psychosis often occurs in people with
a significant history of traumas. Although there is
still limited research into the use of EMDR for people
with psychosis, early indications suggest that it has
potential to be a safe and beneficial intervention for
this population (Swan et al., 2017; Sin & Spain, 2017;
Valiente-Gomez et al., 2017).

EMDR appears to be a safe intervention for a range
of mental health conditions (Carletto et al., 2017;
Doering, Ohlmeter, de Jongh, Hofmann, & Bisping,
2013; Hase, Schallmayer, & Sack, 2008), and maybe the
most poignant finding of this review is that EMDR can
also be successfully and safely administered to people
with a psychotic disorder with or without a comorbid
PTSD. Studies included in this review negate long-
standing concerns that
treating trauma in people
with psychosis will inevitably lead to exacerbations in
(Becker,
psychotic symptoms and adverse events
Zayfert, & Anderson, 2004; Gairns, Alvarez-Jimenez,
Hulbert, McGorry, & Bendall, 2015). EMDR did not
lead to any adverse events such as suicide attempts,
the
aggression or hospital admissions in any of
included studies. Two of the studies in this review
reported that there were no adverse events or exacer-
bations of symptoms during or after treatment (Kim
et al., 2010; Laugharne et al., 2014), and EMDR was
associated with significantly less adverse events com-
pared to the wait-list condition in de Bont et al.’s
(2016) study. The studies in this review complement
the existing literature which suggests TFTs including
EMDR are safe to use for people with psychosis, with
some studies finding they appear to reduce the adver-
sities experienced by this population compared to wait
list conditions (de Bont, van Minnen, & de Jongh,
2013b; van den Berg et al., 2016).

Across the studies EMDR was associated with
a statistically and clinically significant decrease in some
positive and negative psychotic symptoms, although
there were contrasting results for paranoid thinking
measured by the GPTS and auditory hallucinations mea-
sured by the AHRS (de Bont et al., 2016; van den Berg &
van der Gaag, 2012). These differences could be
explained by small sample sizes and subsequent lack of
power leading to skewed results (Teare et al., 2014).
Another plausible contributing factor for the inconsis-
tency in paranoid symptoms could be the use of self-
report measures such as the GPTS. These measures are
inevitably prone to response bias in which participants
can consciously or unconsciously affect outcomes lead-
ing to distorted results (Abernethy, 2015).

Sample size and a lack of power is problematic
throughout the included trials preventing smaller
outcome differences from being detected, poten-
tially affecting the outcomes for EMDR (Sabo &
Boone, 2013). Kim et al.’s (2010) study demon-
strates that EMDR was associated with considerably
(18%) at 2-year
fewer readmissions to hospital

follow-up, in comparison to 42% for the attention-
placebo group and 33% for the TAU group. Despite
these percentages being largely in favour of EMDR,
the results were not regarded as statistically signifi-
cant. Both trials using active comparators were
unable to demonstrate that EMDR was superior
despite Kim et al.’s (2010) study showing a larger
effect size for negative symptoms than the PMR
and TAU groups.

Results of the studies with longer follow-up periods
(McGoldrick et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2010) provide pre-
liminary evidence that EMDR could potentially provide
sustained recovery preventing relapse and readmissions
for people with psychosis. The case series in this review
with longer follow-up provide valuable insight into the
wider impacts on EMDR on a person’s life beyond
symptom change that contribute to recovery. Both case
series note a marked improvement in functioning in
most cases with some people returning to full-time
employment (McGoldrick et al., 2008; Laugharne et al.,
2014). They also report a reduction in the use of psychia-
tric medication and mental health service use. Reducing
the use of psychiatric medication could significantly
improve the health, functioning, quality of life and mor-
tality rates of people with psychosis, whereas reduction in
the use of services could generate considerable cost sav-
ings
the NHS (de Lusignan, Chan, Parry,
Dent-Brown, & Kendrick, 2012). These findings should
prompt more rigorous confirmatory trials to include
outcome measures beyond symptom change with ade-
quate follow-up periods, as decreased service use, eco-
nomic impact, and improved functioning are also
indicators of an intervention’s success.

for

The acceptability of an intervention is a necessary
criterion for its overall effectiveness, and is often deter-
mined by dropout rates (Sekhon, Cartwright, & Francis,
2017). The average dropout rate across the three trials was
17% (de Bont et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2010; van den Berg &
van der Gaag, 2012). This mirrors a previous meta-
analysis that found an average dropout rate of 18% for
trauma-focused interventions for the treatment of PTSD
(Imel, Laska, Jakupcak, & Simpson, 2013). Interpreting
the number of dropouts as an indicator of acceptability
may be misleading, as someone may think the interven-
tion is entirely acceptable and terminated treatment pre-
maturely simply because their symptoms resolved; or for
unrelated reasons such as getting a new job making it
difficult to get to appointments (Sekhon et al., 2017).
Future research using large, adequately powered, and
rigorously performed RCTs with substantial follow-up,
which incorporate qualitative methods to capture service
user experiences would contribute to this conversation.

note that the populations and focus of EMDR varied
amongst the studies. Four of the studies were focussed
on evaluating the safety of using EMDR when treating
PTSD in people with a psychotic disorder (de Bont
et al., 2016; Kratzer et al., 2017; Laugharne et al., 2014;
van den Berg & van der Gaag, 2012). For these studies, it
is difficult to tell whether EMDR was directly respon-
sible for the reduction in psychotic symptoms, or
whether it was the reduction in PTSD symptoms that
caused subsequent reductions in psychotic symptoms.
The two studies evaluating EMDR for the treatment of
people with psychosis without a comorbid PTSD were
able provide preliminary findings that EMDR could be
a useful treatment for psychosis, but these studies are of
lower quality (McGoldrick et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2010).
Similar to Swan et al.’s (2017) systematic review of
psychological interventions for post- traumatic stress
symptoms in psychosis, a strength of this review is the
broad search strategy facilitating the inclusion of a variety
of study designs. A broad search strategy ensured that no
potentially relevant studies were missed, and an inclusive
review was produced incorporating all relevant findings
within the current literature irrespective of study design.
However, although its main strength, the broad inclusion
criteria yielded studies which overall are considered poor
quality for evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention.
Three studies were descriptive studies without a control
group and two were pilot studies. Therefore, this review
was unable to produce strong inferences regarding the
effectiveness of EMDR for people with psychosis.

4.2. Conclusion

This systematic review adds to the growing body of
evidence that supports the use of trauma- focused inter-
ventions for individuals experiencing psychosis (Swan
et al., 2017; Sin & Spain, 2017; Valiente-Gomez et al.,
2017). Despite exciting results highlighting the potential
benefits of EMDR for the treatment of psychosis, the lack
of definitive, high-powered RCTs found, limits any con-
clusions on the overall effectiveness. However, this review
found that EMDR did not lead to any adverse events, and
appears a safe and feasible intervention for people both in
a stable and acute phase of psychosis, with or without
a comorbid PTSD. This review also found comparable
dropout rates to existing research evaluating trauma-
focused interventions for individuals with PTSD, indicat-
ing this population is no more likely to terminate EMDR
prematurely than others. However, an adequate evalua-
tion of the acceptability of EMDR for people with psy-
chosis was not possible, as the studies included did not
adequately address this issue.

psychosis, with evidence of some beneficial effects.
Therefore, in practice EMDR could be considered
an appropriate treatment for people with psychosis
who have been exposed to trauma, based on their
individual assessments and clinical needs. It is impor-
tant to note that some of the studies in this review
increases in psychotic symptoms
observed initial
(Kratzer et al., 2017; van den Berg & van der Gaag,
2012). Although some studies have found that EMDR
can be used effectively with this population without
the use of additional stabilizing interventions (Hardy
& van den Berg, 2016; van den Berg et al., 2015,
2016),
increases in symptoms highlight the
need to view EMDR as a protocol rather than just
bilateral stimulation, as there must be sufficient pre-
paration and work on emotional stability before mov-
ing on to bilateral stimulation. This also indicates the
need for a multidisciplinary team to support people
whilst undergoing EMDR in community settings.
Due to the initial increase in psychotic symptoms
observed in Kratzer et al.’s (2017) study, they suggest
administering EMDR in an inpatient setting may be
beneficial, as there would be more support available if
the intervention increases distress that cannot be
adequately managed in the community.

4.4.

Implications for future research

The studies in this review have opened up new areas for
learning and generated hypotheses that more rigorous
trials can evaluate. Larger confirmatory RCTs directly
comparing EMDR with ‘gold standard’ treatments, such
as CBT or antipsychotic medication, are required to form
more robust conclusions regarding the efficacy of EMDR
for the treatment of psychosis. Future trials should ensure
they are methodologically sound and sufficiently pow-
ered to detect smaller outcome differences, and include
outcome measures at follow-up targeting any increase or
decrease in mental health services and psychotropic med-
ications. All future research should measure acceptability
and rigorously record any adverse outcomes (Duggan,
Parry, McMurran, Davidson, & Dennis, 2014). Future
research should also include stringent fidelity checks
preferably using the EMDR Fidelity Rating Scale (EFRS)
(Korn, Maxfield, Smyth, & Stickgold, 2017). Adherence
to treatment protocols confirmed by fidelity rating scales
is considered essential for any rigorous RCT (Korn et al.,
2017), and fidelity to the treatment model is crucial to
success when translating evidence- based interventions
into practice (Breitenstein et al., 2010).
