Abstract 
Background:  Self-stigma associated with mental illness has remained a global public health issue affecting social 
interactions, health care, productivity and acceptance among others. It is one of important factors contributing to 
non-adherence to medication that leads to increased hospitalization and higher healthcare costs. Hence, the study 
aimed to assess self-stigma and medication adherence among patients with mental illness treated at the psychiatric 
clinic of Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC).

Methods:  A cross-sectional, community-level study was conducted at Jimma town. The patient’s data was collected 
from records between April and June 2017 and the collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 21. The Internal-
ized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) tool was utilized to measure internalized stigma. Linear regression analysis was 
performed to get the final model. Statistical significance association was considered at p-values less than 0.05 and 
95% confidence interval was used.

Results:  Males comprised more than half (61%) of the total sample of 300 respondents and with a mean age of 34.99 
(SD 
 11.51) years. About one-third (32%) of patients had a working diagnosis of schizophrenia followed by major 
depressive disorder (24.3%). More than half of them, 182 (60.7%) were adherent to their psychotropic medication.

Background
Stigma refers to a social phenomenon whereby the pub-
lic has a negative view of individuals with attributes per-
ceived by the general population as inferior, threatening, 
or  having  other  negative  connotations  [1].  The  stigma 
of  psychiatric  patients  is  a  term  that  applies  to  labeling 
patients  as  different  and  inferior  while  discrimination 
is  a  behavioral  manifestation  of  stigma  and  omission  of 
patients  from  certain  competitive  areas,  working  as  a 
form  of  intangible  control  over  groups  of  people  with 
mental illness [2]. Self-stigma (internalized stigma) refers 
to  the  process  by  which  individuals  with  mental  illness 
apply  negative  stereotypes  to  themselves,  expect  to  be 
rejected by others, and feel alienated from society [3]. It 
is  a  gradual  process  in  which  a  person  (example,  a  psy-
chiatric patient) is uncritically adopting negative societal 
prejudices about attributes discredited by others [1, 4]. It 
is related to accepting public stigma in adherence to the 
concepts of stigma to sustain his/her life [5–7].

Self-stigma associated with mental illness has remained 
a global public health concern over the past few years [8]. 
The  majority  of  studies  on  self-stigma  among  individu-
als with mental illness originated from developed nations 
revealing  that  the  range  of  self-stigma  among  patients 
with mental illness varies from 21.6 to 69% [4, 9–13]. It is 
associated with psychiatric illness and the main obstacle 
for preventing early and successful recovery [14]. People 
with  mental  illnesses  are  among  the  most  stigmatized 
groups in society [15].

Self-stigma affects the quality of life in several ways [5, 
16]. As a consequence of self-stigma, patients with men-
tal  illness  usually  have  social,  psychical,  economical  and 
psychological  problems.  This  affects  social  interactions, 
health  care,  productivity  and  acceptance  among  others 
[16–19].  It  can  manifest  in  the  loss  of  friends  and  loved 
ones—the  people  most  critical  to  one’s  social  support 
network.  It  can  limit  employment,  housing  and  educa-
tional opportunities [20, 21]. The negative effects of stig-
matizing attitudes toward people with mental illness can 
influence  all  life  domains:  living,  learning,  working  and 
establishing  friendships  [22,  23].  It  worsens  mental  ill-
ness and leads to social exclusion, inability to participate 
in  important  life  activities,  and  poor  tendency  to  seek 
treatment  which  at  last  hampers  one  major  dimension 
of quality of life [5, 16]. It was evident that an individual 
expecting  rejection  or  condemnation  by  others  tends  to 
be socially withdrawn [1, 23].

Self-stigma  is  a  barrier  to  the  appropriate  treatment 
and  rehabilitation  for  mentally  ill  patients  to  avail  treat-
ment early that results in prolonged recovery, experience 
different  psychological  complications  and  face  serious 
financial  difficulties  [13,  22,  24].  Senses  of  shame,  low 
self-efficacy, and lack of confidence make patients try to 
avoid  stigma  by  not  seeking  the  required  treatment  [22, 
23]. Outpatients who have adopted prejudices about psy-
chiatric  patients  have  less  belief  that  their  mental  state 
will  improve,  are  more  depressed  and  show  more  nega-
tive self-esteem [1, 23, 25]. It is also the leading cause for 
the  reason  for  more  than  an  average  of  patients  do  not 
seek  care,  and  leaving  millions  of  individuals  in  the  ser-
vice gap [11, 14, 26–28]. The stigma of severe mental ill-
ness  also  exacerbates  the  patient  burden  caused  by  the 
illness [14].

Medication  non-adherence  is  a  major  public  health 
problem  that  has  been  called  an  “invisible  epidemic” 
[29].  Researchers  have  indicated  that  self-stigma  is  one 
of the potentially important factors contributing to non-
adherence  to  medication.  This  leads  to  increased  hos-
pitalization,  higher  healthcare  costs  and  is  a  predictor 
of  poor  outcomes  like  more  relapses,  suicide  and  over-
all  mortality  [30,  31].  Self-stigmatization  has  also  a  sig-
nificant  influence  on  medication  adherence  attitude  for 
patients  according  to  findings  from  a  recent  study  [32]. 
Non-adherence  to  psychiatric  treatment  regimens  has  a 
profound  impact  on  the  disease  course,  relapse,  future 
recovery,  cost  of  health  care,  and  the  outcome  for  the 
patient  [33].  Fear  of  stigma  connected  to  the  diagnosis 
and  fear  of  rejection  due  to  revealing  symptoms  have 
been  suggested  to  further  increase  non-adherence  [34, 
35].

Individuals  with  mental  illness  have  the  dual  burden 
of  coping  with  the  symptoms  of  mental  illness,  like  hal-
lucinations, depression, delusions and anxiety, as well as 
the societal stigmatization of their illness [22, 23]. Stigma 
results  from  a  process  by  which  certain  individuals 
(groups)  unjustifiably  are  rendered  shameful,  excluded 
and discriminated [5, 6]. Self-stigma among people with 
mental  illness  can  also  result  from  multiple  cognitive 
and environmental factors and processes [36]. Efforts to 
remove  or  reduce  stigma  are  still  in  their  infancy  [37]. 
The  stigma  of  mental  illness  continues  to  be  strong  and 
pervasive  in  our  society  and  to  have  detrimental  effects 
on  people  with  mental  illness.  Overall,  stigma  impedes 
recovery  from  mental  illness  and,  thus,  represents  a

tremendous  burden  on  people  with  mental  illness  [24]. 
Hence,  the  study  was  aimed  to  assess  self-stigma  and 
medication  adherence  among  patients  with  mental  ill-
ness treated at the psychiatric clinic of Jimma University 
Medical Center (JUMC).

Methods
Study setting, design and eligibility criteria

The  study  was  conducted  at  the  community  level  in 
Jimma  town  patients  with  mental  illness.  Jimma  town 
is  the  capital  city  of  Jimma  zone  which  was  founded  in 
the late 1830s and it occurs at south west part of Ethio-
pia at a distance of 352 km southwest from Addis Ababa. 
The  town  has  3  districts  (Woreda)  and  17  sub-districts 
(kebele).  The  town  has  two  hospitals;  Jimma  general 
hospital  and  Jimma  University  Medical  Center  (JUMC). 
Psychiatric  outpatient  and  inpatient  services  are  avail-
able only at the JUMC. There were more than 1200 indi-
viduals who have ever follow-up treatment at psychiatric 
clinics  of  JUMC  with  different  diagnosis  and  duration 
of  treatment.  A  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  by 
reviewing patients’ charts from April 20 to June 20, 2017. 
Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with mental illness who were 
listed under the DSM-IV-TR manual and had a history of 
at least one-time psychiatric treatment at the psychiatric 
clinic of JUMC were included. Patients  who  were newly 
diagnosed  with  mental  illness  within  6  months  dura-
tion  before  data  collection,  who  were  not  available  dur-
ing data collection and those who had hearing problems 
were excluded from the study.

Study variables

The outcome or dependent variable was self-stigma and 
the primary independent exposure variable was the level 
of medication adherence. Other were sociodemographic 
characteristics  (age,  sex,  place  of  residence,  education, 
occupation, monthly household expenditure, marital sta-
tus, living condition, religion), various psychiatric illness’ 
(bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophre-
nia,  brief  psychotic  disorder,  schizophreniform  disor-
der,  schizoaffective  disorder,  delusional  disorder,  panic 
disorder,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder,  acute  stress  disorder,  social  phobia  etc.), 
duration  of  treatments,  premorbid  occupational  status, 
the status of functional outcome, duration of the illness, 
age  at  onset  of  the  illness,  number  of  relapses,  number 
of  admissions,  level  of  medication  adherence  and  social 
support.

Sample size and sampling technique

Single  population  proportion  formula  was  used  to 
calculate  sample  size  using;  the  level  of  significance 
taken  as  95%,  (Zα = 1.96),  the  error  of  margin,  5%  and 

p = 0.2512%,  the  previous  finding  reported  that  the  self-
stigma prevalence was 25.12% [36].

where P = extent of self-stigma, Z = critical value at 95% 
CI of certainty (1.96). d = the margin of error, 5%. n = the 
required sample size.

Therefore, the sample size was

n =

, n = 289

Therefore, the sample size by the above calculation was 
289.  By  adding  10%  non-response  rate,  the  final  sample 
size was 318.

For  obtaining  study  population,  a  systematic  sampling 
method was used because the registration of the patients 
with mental illness who were only from Jimma town was 
used.  Patients’  data  registration  revealed  that  the  total 
adult  patients  with  mental  illness  who  had  treatment  at 
the psychiatry clinic of JUMC were 1200 and from these 
698  adult  patients  were  from  Jimma  town.  From  these, 
318  study  participants  were  selected  systematically  by 
using  a  computer-generated  method  (k = 2).  By  review-
ing  chart  study  participants  were  identified.  Finally,  the 
information of adult psychiatric patients was distributed 
to  health  extension  workers  of  the  town  and  psychia-
try  department  staff  according  to  the  patients’  address. 
Information  of  the  study  sample  was  provided  to  the 
health  extension  workers  who  contacted  the  patients 
using  tracing  methods  and  with  the  help  of  the  contact 
number  provided  on  the  registration  chart.  But  14  of 
them  died  during  data  collection.  Therefore,  they  were 
excluded from the study and data collection and analysis 
was carried out among 304 participants.

Data collection tools and process

The  data  was  collected  from  patients’  charts  and  using 
interview-based  structured  questionnaires  among  the 
participants  who  were  addressed  by  tracing  methods  in 
each kebele of the town. Two Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) 
psychiatric  nurses  and  four  mental  health  master’s  stu-
dents were recruited for data collection.

The  data  collection  tool  had  five  components:  socio-
demographic  variables,  clinical  details,  self-stigma  of 
mental  illness  (ISMI),  WHODAS  version  2  (12-items), 
Oslo  scale  for  social  support  and  Morisky  Medication 
Adherence  Scales  (MMAS-4).  Clinical  inventory  part 
includes patients’ working diagnosis, age at onset, dura-
tion of illness, number of episodes, number of hospitali-
zations,  duration  of  treatment,  current  clinical  status, 
medication side effects, and previous suicide attempt.

The  Internalized  Stigma  of  Mental  Illness  (ISMI-29 
items) tool [13, 38–40] was utilized to measure internal-
ized stigma (internal consistency reliability coefficient of 
alpha = 0.90)  [41].  The  tool  was  validated  and  has  been 
used in several studies in Ethiopia [5, 36, 42]. Each ISMI 
item  contains  a  declarative  statement  about  a  poten-
tial  stigma  issue  and  participants  respond  to  each  state-
ment by indicating their level of agreement: 1 = strongly 
disagree;  2 = disagree;  3 = agree  and  4 = strongly  agree. 
It  contains  five  subscales;  alienation  (6  items),  stereo-
type  endorsement  (7  items),  discrimination  experience 
(5 items), social withdrawal (6 items), and stigma resist-
ance (5 items). Alienation is “the subjective experience of 
being less than a full member of society”. The stereotype 
endorsement is “the degree to which patients agreed with 
common stereotypes about people with a mental illness”. 
The  discrimination  experience  measures  “respondents’ 
perceptions  of  the  way  they  tend  to  be  treated  by  oth-
ers”.  The  social  withdrawal  measures  the  self-exclusion 
from social events (situations) due to mental illness. The 
stigma  resistance  subscale  is  “a  person’s  ability  to  resist 
stigma” [16, 36]. Except for the stigma resistance domain, 
a  higher  score  of  the  remaining  four  subscales  indicates 
higher internalized stigma. For that matter, stigma resist-
ance  items  were  reverse  coded.  The  overall  score  was 
obtained by summing all the answered scores and divided 
by a total number of items.

The  other  tool  which  was  developed  by  the  World 
Health  Organization,  The  12-item  Self-Report  World 
Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 
(WHODAS-II) [43, 44] was used to establish the level of 
impairment associated with mental illness and it assesses 
the  level  of  disability  and  the  number  of  days  lost  from 
work in the previous 30 days. It has 12 items and Likert 
scale (1–5). Oslo scale for social support has three items 
and is used to assess the level of social support of the par-
ticipants  [45,  46].  Oslo-3  Social  Support  Scale  (OSS-3); 
the  interpretation  was  made  as,  a  person  scored  12–14 
(good),  9–11  (moderate),  and  3–8  (poor  social  support) 
[47].

The  Morisky  Medication-taking  Adherence  Scale 
(MMAS-4),  a  four-item  self-report  measure  of  medi-
cation-taking  behavior,  which  has  high  reliability  and 
validity,  was  used  for  assessing  patient  adherence  [48]. 
MMAS-4 was reliable in the study (Cronbach’s α = 0.73) 
done  in  Jimma  university  specialized  [41].  It  measures 
both  intentional  and  unintentional  adherence  based  on 
forgetfulness,  carelessness,  stopping  medication  when 
feeling  better,  and  stopping  medication  when  feel-
ing  worse.  Each  of  the  items  has  dichotomous  types  of 
responses (yes, no). In all, 0 point was allocated to a yes 
response  and  1  point  to  a  no  response.  The  total  score 
ranged from 0 (non-adherent) to 4 (adherent). The results 

were  scored  for  all  questions  of  medication  adherence 
with a score of ≤ 2 classified as ‘non-adherent’ and > 2 as 
adherent [39, 41].

Data quality management and analysis

To  ensure  the  quality  of  data,  the  project  staff  were 
trained  for  2  days  on  the  purpose  of  the  study,  details 
of  the  questionnaires,  the  technique  of  interview,  the 
importance of privacy and confidentiality of the respond-
ents.  The  data  collection  instrument  tools  were  devel-
oped in English version, then translated to local language 
(Amharic  and  Afan  Oromo)  and  later  translated  back 
to  English  version  by  experts  for  consistency.  Twenty 
patients  were  pretested  at  the  psychiatric  clinic,  JUMC, 
those  who  came  for  appointments  from  different  parts 
of Jimma Zone except Jimma Town. During data collec-
tion process, all the collected data was reviewed daily and 
checked for completeness.

The  collected  data  were  entered  into  Epi-data  version 
3.1,  and  then  exported  to  SPSS  window  version  21  for 
summarization  and  further  analysis.  Before  analysis  lin-
ear  regression  assumptions  were  checked.  Simple  linear 
regression analysis was carried out to assess the associa-
tion  between  different  variables  and  to  identify  candi-
dates for multivariate linear regression analysis. Variable 
having  p-value  of  less  than  0.25  was  subjected  to  mul-
tivariate  linear  regression  analysis.  Then,  multivariate 
linear regression analysis was performed to get the final 
model. Statistical significance association was considered 
at  p-values  less  than  0.05  and  95%  confidence  interval 
was  used.  Self-stigma  was  identified  against  medication 
adherence status. The mean score for each of the subscale 
and overall self-stigma was done but the final subscale of 
ISMI  was  reversely  recoded  before  the  identified  mean 
score. Finally, the results were presented in tables, graphs 
and statements.

Operational definition

Level of stigma was based on the mean score of ISMI, and 
using similar score categories to the European and Ethio-
pian studies [39, 42]:

•  < 2 of total score indicated that minimal internalized 

stigma.

•  2–2.5  of  total  score  indicated  that  low  internalized 

stigma.

•  2.5–3 of total score indicated that moderate internal-

ized stigma.

•  3+  of  total  score  indicated  that  high  internalized 

stigma.

Adherence  to  medication  The  level  of  drug  adherence 

was measured based on MMAS-4 score. Accordingly,

•  Non-adherent: MMAS-4 score of ≤ 2.
•  Non-adherent: MMAS-4 scores of > 2.

Results
Socio‑demographic characteristics

Of  the  total  318  participants  contacted  by  tracers,  14 
people  died  during  the  study  period.  Only  304  partici-
pants  were  included  in  the  study  with  response  rate  of 
300 (98.67%). Of the total respondents, males comprised 
185  (61.7%)  and  the  mean  age  of  the  respondents  was 
34.99  (SD = 11.51)  years.  One  hundred  and  eighty-five 
(61.0%) were single and the majority of them were Mus-
lims  (43.0%).  One  hundred  forty-five  (48.3%)  of  them 
were  Oromo,  and  192  (64.2%)  of  them  were  living  with 
their  family.  One  hundred  forty  (46.7%)  of  the  respond-
ents  were  jobless  and  about  one-third  (34.3%)  had  pri-
mary educational level (Table 1).

Clinical characteristics

About  one-third  (32%)  of  patients  had  a  working  diag-
nosis  of  schizophrenia  followed  by  major  depressive 
disorder  (24.3%).  The  average  duration  of  mental  illness 
among the respondents was 98.25 (SD = 67.608) months 
ranged  from  3  to  12  months.  The  mean  value  of  dura-
tion  before  seeking  treatment  was  14.28  (SD = 24.31) 
months.  The  average  duration  that  respondents  had 
been  getting  treatment  was  69.11  (SD = 64.98)  months, 
ranged  zero  to  348  months.  After  the  first  episode  of 
their  illness,  respondents  experienced  an  average  value 
of  2.17  (SD = 2.511)  times  relapse  of  their  illness  with  a 
maximum  of  17  times.  The  average  number  of  admis-
sions  to  the  hospital  was  0.87  (SD = 1.289)  with  the 
range  of  no  admission  to  seven  times.  The  mean  age  of 
the  participants  at  the  onset  of  mental  illness  was  26.90 
(SD = 11.484) years.

Around  74.7%  of  the  respondents  were  on  the  work 
(had  jobs)  and  around  two-thirds  (65.7%)  of  them  were 
single  when  they  had  the  onset  of  mental  illness.  Less 
than  two-thirds  of  the  respondents  (63.3%)  had  a  his-
tory  of  discontinuation  of  their  medication  without 
medical  advice.  Fifty-five  (18.3%)  respondents  had  poor 
social  supports  whereas  39  (13.0%)  of  them  had  high 
social  supports.  About  30.7%  of  respondents  had  a  his-
tory  of  attempting  suicide  to  kill  themselves  with  and 
without  strong  intentions.  About  13%  of  the  respond-
ents attempted suicide due to their illness alone whereas 
6.8%  of  them  attempted  due  to  their  illness  comorbid 
with social problems like lack of support. More than two-
thirds  (69.3%)  of  the  respondents  had  current  follow  up 
from  psychiatric  clinics,  but  only  63.3%  of  the  respond-
ents were on treatment during the data collection period 
(Table 2).

Level of medication adherence and self‑stigma

Medication  adherence  was  assessed  using  the  Morisky 
medication adherence scale (MMAS) which contains four 
components. With this scale, 182 (60.7%) were adherent 
to  their  medication  and  39.3%  were  not-adherent.  From 
39.3% of the respondents who were non-adherents, 26% 
of  them  were  males.  Those  individuals  forgetting  taking 
of their medication at right time and right dose were 127 
(42.3%),  careless  in  taking  their  medication  106  (35.3%), 
discontinued their medication when felt better 88 (29.3%) 
and  those  who  stopped  their  medication  when  their  ill-
ness becomes worse were only 52 (17.3%).

The  self-stigma  was  evaluated  using  the  ISMI  scale 
that  contains  29-items  with  four-point  Likert  scale  and 
has five subscales. The mean score of each sub-scale was 
done  with  different  tools.  Accordingly,  mean  alienation 
score  2.26  (SD = 0.95),  mean  stereotype  endorsement 
score  2.14  (SD = 0.784),  mean  perceived  discrimination 
score  2.18  (SD = 0.90),  mean  social  withdrawal  score 
2.10 (SD = 0.857) and mean stigma resistance score 2.11 
(SD = 0.844).  The  stigma  resistance  component  was 
reversely recoded because the maximum value indicates 
that  resistance  is  low  in  opposite  of  other  components 
of  IMSI.  The  overall  mean  value  of  self-stigma  was  2.16 
(SD = 0.867).

About 157 (52.3%), 59 (19.7%), 42 (14%), and 42 (14%), 
of  the  respondents  had  a  minimal,  low,  moderate  and 
high  level  of  self-stigma  based  on  total  stigma  score., 
respectively.  Overall,  around  one-third  (28%)  of  the 
respondents had moderate to high self-stigma (Table 3).

Factors associated with self‑stigma

For one by one regression association of each dependent 
factor  with  self-stigma  around  17  variables  were  associ-
ated  and  candidate  for  multivariate  linear  regression. 

Medication  non-adherence,  having  diagnosed  with 
schizophrenia,  living  with  others  other  than  parents, 
increased  WHODAS  score  (decreased  functional  out-
come),  stopped  their  treatment  during  data  collection, 
having poor social support, increased number of admis-
sion,  having  frequent  relapse  of  the  illness  and  longer 
duration  of  the  illness  before  starting  treatment  were 
associated  with  significantly  higher  self-stigma  whereas 
the remaining variables listed in Table 4 were associated 
with lower level of self-stigma upon binary linear regres-
sion (Table 4).

Multivariable  regression  revealed  the  age  of  the 
patient  (std.  β = − 0.091,  p = 0.009)  and  living  with  kids 
and  spouse  (std.  β = − 0.099,  p = 0.038)  were  negatively 
associated  with  self-stigma  whereas  increased  WHO-
DAS  score  (β = 0.501,  p < 0.01),  number  of  relapses  (std. 
β = 0.183,  p < 0.01)  and  medication  non-adherence  (std. 
β = 0.084, p = 0.021) were positively associated with self-
stigma. Increasing the age of the patients and living with 
kids and spouses was significantly associated with lower 
level  of  internalized  stigma  whereas  the  rest  variables 
were  associated  with  higher  level  of  internalized  stigma 
(Table 5).

Association of self‑stigma and level of medication 
adherence

By dichotomizing the level of medication adherence into 
adherent  and  non-adherent,  it  was  associated  with  self-
stigma.  In  the  bivariate  (β = 0.034,  p < 0.001)  and  multi-
variate linear regression model (std. β = 0.084, p < 0.021), 
being  non-adherent  to  the  medication  was  associated 
with higher self-stigma.

Among  respondents  who  were  adherent  to  medi-
cations,  minimal  stigma  was  detected  among  63.2% 
whereas moderate to high stigma was detected in 17.5%. 
Of  the  respondents  who  were  non-adherent  to  their 
medication,  44.1%  had  moderate  to  high  internalized 
stigma.  Among  the  respondents  who  were  forgetting  to 
take  their  medication,  26.0%  of  them  had  high  levels  of 
stigma and nearly half (47.2%) of respondents who were 
careless  in  taking  of  their  medication  had  moderate  to 
high self-stigma. About 37.5% of respondents with a his-
tory  of  medication  discontinuation  when  they  felt  well 
from  their  illness,  had  moderate  to  high  self-stigma. 
About  51.9%  of  the  respondents  who  had  a  history  of 
medication discontinuation when felt their illness worsen 
without medical advice had moderate to high self-stigma 
score (Table 6).

Overall, more than half (53.4%) of the respondents who 
were non-adherent scored above the total mean score of 
self-stigma and discrimination (Fig. 1).

When  comparing  the  respondents  with  a  history  of 
never forgetting to take their medication, respondents

p = 0.002).  Additionally,  respondents  who  were  care-
less  in  taking  of  their  medication  had  higher  self-
stigma  (std.  β = 0.364,  p < 0.001)  compared  to  those 
who  were  not  careless.  Stopping  to  take  their  medi-

compared to the counterparts.

Discussion
This study tried to address the association between self-
stigma  and  medication  adherence  among  psychiatric 
patients.  Self-stigma  is  an  important  factor  negatively 
influencing  adherence  to  treatment  and  significantly 
contributing  to  the  voluntary  discontinuation  of  drugs. 
Cross-cultural  studies  indicate  that  every  culture  has  its 
own  particular  explanations  for  health  and  illness  and 
its  healing  strategies  [49].  Ethiopians  commonly  believe 
that mental illness is caused by evil spirits and should be

a   Dependent variable: self-stigma and discrimination

treated  with  holy  water  and  exorcism.  Most  Ethiopians 
have faith in traditional healers and procedures [50]. The 
possible factors for the high risk of stigma are ignorance, 
perceived  fear  of  injury,  actual  (perceived)  absence  of 
treatment, and cultural misconceptions about the nature 
of  the  mental  illness,  associating  the  illness  with  the 
supernatural explanation [5–7, 51]. The rural population’s 

adherence to spiritual explanations, particularly for seri-
ous  psychotic  symptoms,  and  their  openness  to  both 
modern  and  traditional  treatments  speak  to  the  impor-
tance  of  developing  a  holistic  and  inclusive  approach  to 
psycho-education and treatment for this population [52].

Fig. 1  Stigma score around the overall mean score with the level of 
medication adherence among the sample

with  mental  disorders  will  also  be  an  important  avenue 
for future investigation.

The majority of respondents had working a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia followed by major depressive disorder. The 
mean  value  of  time  duration  for  which  the  respondents 
had followed their treatment was 69.11 months and more 
than half of the respondents had history of discontinua-
tion  of  their  medication  without  medical  advice.  About 
30.7% of the respondents had feeling of socially discrimi-
nated against due to their illness.

In  this  finding,  the  overall  self-stigma  score  was  2.16 
and  28%  of  the  respondents  had  moderate  to  high  self-
stigma. The prevalence of the self-stigma was lower com-
pared  with  the  study  done  in  Jimma  [36]  and  Dilla  [5], 
whereas it was comparable with the study done in Addis 
Ababa [42]. The first study in Jimma and Dilla were done 
among  patients  with  mental  illness  only  those  on  fol-
low  up  and  facility-based,  while  the  current  study  was 
done  both  at  community-based  and  tracing  methods. 
Additionally, the current study also took place among all 
patients who had a history of treatment at JUMC without 
limiting the duration and clinical diagnosis.

The  prevalence  of  self-stigma  was  higher  in  this  study 
compared  with  the  studies  done  in  Iran,  Europe  and 

Nigeria  [13,  53,  54].  The  study  done  in  Iran  took  place 
among patients with bipolar disorders while the study in 
Nigeria was only among patients with severe mental dis-
orders.  Additionally,  cross-sectional  facility-based  study 
conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia reported that nearly 
three-quarters  of  respondents  (71%)  expressed  strong 
agreement to at least one internalized stigma item [42]. A 
study by Gebeyehu et al. reported that (25.7%) of patients 
with  severe  mental  disorders  attending  Bahir  Dar  Fel-
ege  Hiwote  Referral  hospital  had  perceived  stigma  [29]. 
Additionally,  study  by  Adewuya  et  al.  in  Lagos,  Nigeria 
reported that high self-stigma was found in 21.6% of the 
outpatients in the study [13]. The correlates of high self-
stigma study in Nigeria included level of social support, 
duration of illness, level of insight and working status.

This study found that social withdrawal (exclusion from 
social  events)  was  less  experienced  than  other  compo-
nents of ISMI whereas alienation (being inferior) was the 
highest score in agreement with the study done in Jimma, 
Dilla  and  Europe  that  identified  high  alienation  score 
[5,  36,  54].  But  a  study  in  Nigeria  revealed  that  ISMI 
scoring  was  highest  on  ‘dis-crimination  experiences’ 
(mean = 2.69,  SD = 1.88),  followed  by  ‘social  withdrawal’ 
(mean 2.40, SD = 1.51) [13].

The  increasing  age  of  the  patients  was  significantly 
associated  with  a  lower  level  of  internalized  stigma.  But 
a study by Kamaradova et al. reported the levels of self-
stigma expressed by the total ISMI scores did not signifi-
cantly  correlate  with  either  age  or  age  of  disorder  onset 
[1]. This leads to more adaptation and creates some rela-
tion with the community which may decrease the magni-
tude of self-stigma.

In  our  study  finding,  55  (18.3%)  had  poor  social  sup-
ports  whereas  39  (13.0%)  of  them  had  high  social  sup-
ports. A closely related finding was reported by Gebeyehu 
et  al.  where  45.9%  had  good  social  support  [29].  Living

with  kids  and  spouses  was  negatively  associated  with 
self-stigma  up  on  multivariable  linear  regression.  This 
finding correlates with the previous study by Asrat et al. 
that  showed  a  lack  of family support was  independently 
associated with internalized stigma. Accordingly, patients 
getting  good  family  support  had  less  risk  for  internal-
ized  stigma  than  their  counterparts  [5].  These  studies 
strongly  supported  that  patients  getting  better  social 
and family support had a better prognosis and favorable 
outcome  against  internalized  stigma.  Furthermore,  they 
are actively involved in anti-stigma campaigns and other 
activities.

The  current  study  found  that  39.7%  of  respondents 
were  non-adherent  with  their  medication.  This  find-
ing  was  in  line  with  global  non-adherence  rates  among 
patients  with  mental  illness  between  30  and  65%  [55, 
56].  The  finding  was  also  comparable  with  those  from 
Jimma, Ethiopia 41.2% [41], and India 42% [57]. Contrary 
to this, the prevalence was higher than in India 26% [58] 
and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (26.5%) [42]. The finding was 
also lower than a study conducted in Nigeria (48.0%) [59], 
Curitiba,  Parana  (49%)  [60],  Nigeria  54.2%  [61],  Bahir 
Dar,  Ethiopia  (55.2%)  [29],  South  Africa  63.2%  [62]  and 
Pakistan’s  study  (64.75%)  [63].  This  variation  could  be 
due to the differences in socio-demography of the study 
population,  selection  criteria  for  the  study  participants, 
study  design,  sample  size  and  tools  used  for  the  assess-
ment of adherence. It might also relate to the differences 
in the health care setting, community culture or level of 
knowledge on drug adherence of health providers.

For example, the lower sample size was taken in Paki-
stan,  using  a  convenient,  non-probability  sample  of  135 
follow-up  patients  were  assessed.  The  study  done  in 
South  Africa  took  only  among  schizophrenic  patients 
and the study done in Nigeria was carried out at facility-
based  and  among  patients  struggling  with  illness  a  sign 
and symptoms by using self-administered questionnaires. 
Adherence at any given moment does not guarantee sub-
sequent adherence since the definition attributed by the 
people to the use of the drugs and the motivation to do 
so  are  flexible,  they  are  influenced  by  their  perception, 
attitude,  external  factors,  and  past  experiences.  Thus, 
even adherent patients need great focus and monitoring 
regarding the use of medication. According to the avail-
able  evidence,  non-adherence  to  psychiatric  medica-
tions is high and is one of the top public health problems 
requiring due attention and intervention [41].

In  this  study,  significant  association  was  identified 
between self-stigma and levels of medication adherence. 
Study participants who didn’t adhere to their medication 
as  ordered  by  health  care  providers  were  experiencing 
more  self-stigma  than  those  patients  who  were  adher-
ent.  It  was  in  agreement  with  other  research  outcomes 

[5,  64].  One  study  done  in  Czech  Republic,  by  placing 
self-stigma  as  independent  (predictor  factors)  for  medi-
cation adherence, identified that there was negative asso-
ciation  between  self-stigma  and  medication  adherence 
among  schizophrenic  patients  [1].  Contrary  to  this,  one 
study done in Sweden identified that there was no signifi-
cant association between the two factors in the adjusted 
model [38].

Even  though  self-stigma  and  discrimination  could 
occur  among  all  patients,  a  high  mean  score  of  self-
stigma  was  common  among  non-adherent  whereas  low 
mean  score  was  common  among  adherents  than  non-
adherents.  About  39.3%  scored  greater  than  the  overall 
mean  value  of  ISMI  score.  Visiting  psychiatric  clinics 
and  taking  medications  are  directly  associated  with  the 
disclosure  of  their  health  status.  In  general,  the  present 
study showed that higher self-stigma level was linked to 
non-adherence. This underlines the importance of inter-
ventions  aimed  at  lowering  the  levels  of  self-stigma  in 
patients.

Although  the  treatment  gap  is  a  useful  construct  to 
measure  access  and  equitability  of  care,  it  fails  to  com-
municate the real-life consequences of the treatment gap 
and the urgent need to address care disparities in Ethio-
pia [65]. Lack of capacity is deeply rooted in the lack of 
psychiatric  training  available  in  Ethiopia.  Resources  for 
learning  about  mental  illness  fuel  the  fire  of  stigma  and 
ignorance as well. Medical journals exist in Ethiopia, but 
rarely ever broach the topic of mental illness [66]. Stigma 
has long been viewed as a major barrier to mental health 
reform and community integration for people with men-
tal  disorders.  Whereas,  knowledge  of  the  social  dimen-
sions  of  stigma  and  discrimination  on  mental  patients 
has  begun  to  accumulate,  much  remains  to  be  known 
about  the  extent  and  models  of  self-stigma  and  how  to 
measure it.

Limitations of the study
One  of  the  study’s  limitations  is  the  fact  that  most  data 
were  obtained  using  self-reported  questionnaires.  The 
self-report  method  used  to  measure  self-stigma  and 
medication  adherence  might  substantially  overestimate 
adherence,  as  it  relies  on  patient  response.  To  get  the 
study participants, we used a general survey method on 
patients  with  mental  illness  who  had  a  history  of  treat-
ment at the psychiatric clinic of JUMC which might lead 
to  recall  bias  and  great  variability  in  the  information  of 
the  current  data  (can  significantly  affect  the  reliability 
and  validity  of  the  result).  The  cross-sectional  design  of 
the  study  fails  to  assess  patients’  adherence  behaviors 
over time, and although this approach is helpful to inves-
tigate associations between variables, it cannot attribute 
cause and effect. Another limitation of this study pertains 

Abdisa et al. Int J Ment Health Syst           (2020) 14:56

to  the  lack  of  longitudinal  analysis  concerning  factors 
associated  with  self-stigma  has  been  highlighted  previ-
ously. The study setting and sample were not completely 
representative  of  the  patient  population  with  mental  ill-
ness patients. In this study, we assessed only internalized 
stigma and perceived discrimination but also it would be 
better  if  others  stigmas  and  discriminations  like  social, 
institutional and applied stigma to identify the magnitude 
and  association  with  the  level  of  medication  adherence 
among patients with mental illness. Further, this research 
might  not  identify  all  factors  (like  severity  and  disease 
symptomatology)  contributing  to  non-adherence,  nor 
accurately  measure  adherence,  which  can  be  addressed 
by future studies. Finally, we were unable to address those 
patients who left the town for different reasons.

Conclusion
About  one-third  of  the  patients  had  a  working  diagno-
sis  of  schizophrenia.  Age,  living  with  kids  and  spouse, 
increased  WHODAS  score,  the  number  of  relapses  and 
medication  non-adherence  were  significantly  associ-
ated  with  self-stigma.  There  was  a  significant  associa-
tion between overall ISMI score and level of medication 
adherence  that  indicated  becoming  non-adherent  was 
associated with a higher level of self-stigma and discrimi-
nation.  It  was  identified  that  there  was  high  self-stigma 
related  to  medication  non-adherence  that  leads  mental 
health  professionals  and  policy-makers  to  give  future 
direction  to  self-stigma  in  perspectives  of  medication 
adherence.  Health  professionals  in  the  psychiatric  clinic 
and  pharmacists  need  to  focus  on  and  counsel  patients 
about  adherence  and  its  implications  for  their  clinical 
outcome.

Religious leaders could be engaged by marshaling reli-
gious teachings that admonish individuals from discrimi-
nating  against  mentally  ill  persons.  The  current  report, 
along  with  other  similar  data  from  Ethiopia  and  other 
low-income countries, supports the need to incorporate 
culturally appropriate methods of addressing internalized 
stigma into rehabilitation packages for this group.

Strategies focusing on early detection and treatment of 
mental illness will play an important role in stigma pre-
vention.  Awareness  creation,  community  mobilization, 
and  service  expansion  strategies  are  cost-effective  and 
efficient ways to act against stigma. Further, strengthen-
ing  the  social  network  (support)  of  mentally  ill  people 
with themselves and with the community is found to be 
necessary.  Working  with  the  media  to  raise  awareness 
of  mental  health  issues  and  establish  best  practices  for 
reporting and for depicting mental illness is an effective 
approach with the potential to have a positive impact on 
public perceptions.
