Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUD) are highly prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) and signiﬁ-
cantly affect clinical outcomes. Incidence and management of illicit drug use differ from alcohol use
disorders, nicotine use of behavioral addictions. It is not yet clear why people with bipolar disor-
der are at higher risk of addictive disorders, but recent data suggest common neurobiological and
genetic underpinnings and epigenetic alterations. In the absence of speciﬁc diagnostic instruments,
the clinical interview is conducive for the diagnosis. Treating SUD in bipolar disorder requires a
comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach. Most treatment trials focus on single drugs, such as
cannabis alone or in combination with alcohol, cocaine, or amphetamines. Synopsis of data provides
limited evidence that lithium and valproate are effective for the treatment of mood symptoms in
cannabis users and may reduce substance use. Furthermore, the neuroprotective agent citicoline
may reduce cocaine consumption in BD subjects. However, many of the available studies had an
open-label design and were of modest to small sample size. The very few available psychotherapeutic
trials indicate no signiﬁcant differences in outcomes between BD with or without SUD. Although
SUD is one of the most important comorbidities in BD with a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on clinical outcome,
there is still a lack both of basic research and clinical trials, allowing for evidence-based and speciﬁc
best practices.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common, severe and cyclic mental illness that presents
with marked and unpredictable changes in mood and activity [1]. BD is a risk factor for
addictions, both behavioral, such as gambling [2] and substance use disorders [3]. Besides
a strong association between alcohol [4] and nicotine [5] dependence and BD [4], the
abuse of other drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, cannabis, and prescription
medications is also an important health concern in people with BD. When conceptualizing
this article, the authors noticed that there is a fair number of reviews on alcohol use
disorder in individuals with BD, including their own recent publication [1], whereas there
is a relative paucity of up-to-date, comprehensive reviews on the subject of bipolarity and
illicit drugs.

Substances reviewed in this article under the heading of “illicit drugs” include am-
phetamines, cannabis and cocaine as they are among the most frequently used substances
and have been, at least to some degree and different from, e.g., opioids, studied in subjects

with BD. However, what constitutes an illicit drug varies between countries, e.g., cannabis
has been legalized in some countries but not in others. In this sense, the term “illicit
drugs” for these substances applies to most countries, including the author’s home country
Germany, but not to all.

Milder mood symptoms including depressive or euphoric mood swings may, in many
instances, be the result of substance use. However, these subjects may also suffer from
cyclothymic or bipolar II disorders (BD II). Moreover, extensive use of amphetamines
or cocaine may also mimic manic symptoms or may be a risk factor for a switch into a
manic episode in a primarily bipolar subject. Substance use and substance use disorders
(SUD) may be associated with medication non-compliance, more mixed or dysphoric
mania, and possibly an earlier onset of affective symptoms and more hospitalizations [6].
Thus, early recognition and treatment are of the utmost importance to improve long-term
outcomes in people with BD. Improving mood symptoms by speciﬁc pharmacotherapy
for BD may be the initial step to get a grip on drug use and use disorders, but in case of
excessive drug consumption, acute detoxiﬁcation treatment need to be ﬁrst before speciﬁc
BD treatments can be started. Mood stabilizers and/or atypical antipsychotics, as well
as speciﬁc psychosocial interventions, may be useful for long-term stabilization in BD
comorbid with SUD, including illicit drugs. This narrative review tries to summarize
current knowledge about the incidence, inﬂuence and treatment of illicit drug abuse in
people with BD.

2. Epidemiology of Illicit Substance Use in Bipolar Disorder
2.1. Results from General Population Surveys

The high association of BD with several substance use disorders (SUDs) has been

consistently reported by epidemiological surveys and also clinical studies [7].

Recent epidemiological results on this co-morbidity have been reported from the
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC) [8]. In a
ﬁrst wave (wave I), the survey interviewed around 43,093 people in 2001 and 2002. The rate
of comorbid alcohol and substance-related disorders (AUD and SUD) in BD is, as expected,
disproportionately high [9] and accomplish up to 50% for bipolar I disorder [10]. On the
other hand, respondents with SUDs also have a higher lifetime rate of manic (3.7–13.4%)
and hypomanic episodes (3.7–13.4%) [9] compared to the general population. In subjects
with unipolar mania, also approx. 40% have been diagnosed with a comorbid SUD [11]. In
comparison, rates for unipolar depression are 40.3% for AUD (21% for alcohol dependence)
and 17.2% for other substance use disorders. More speciﬁcally, NESARC wave I found
that females with mania had signiﬁcantly higher odds ratios (OR) of any drug abuse,
tranquilizer abuse, cocaine and opioid use disorders compared to males. Furthermore,
compared to males, women with hypomania also had higher ORs of any SUD, including
sedatives and opioid use disorders [11].

Regarding people with primary SUD, a high comorbidity rate of additional drug use
disorders and antisocial personality disorder has been reported. However, there are also
strong and important associations with mood and anxiety disorders. In their National Epi-
demiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Compton and colleagues showed
that drug dependence over twelve months was signiﬁcantly related to Major Depressive
Disorders and BD-I, but interestingly not BD-II disorder. Lifetime treatment or help-seeking
behavior was rare in SUD but signiﬁcantly increased in case of psychiatric comorbidity [12].

2.2. Longitudinal Trends in Comorbid Illicit Substance Use Disorder and Bipolar Disorder

Subsequent analyses of the NESARC data (wave III, 2012–2013) reported rates and
ORs of twelve month and lifetime prevalence of speciﬁc substance user disorders (SUD),
including amphetamine, cannabis, club drug, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, non-heroin
opioids, sedatives or tranquilizers, and solvent or inhalant use disorders [13]. Odds ratios
for SUD in comorbid mental disorders were computed. Prevalence rates of 12-month and
lifetime SUD for the total sample of n = 36,309 were 3.9% and 9.9%, respectively. Again,
individuals with Bipolar I disorders had a signiﬁcantly increased 12-months SUD OR
(1.5; 95% CI, 1.06–2.05) and lifetime SUD OR (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.14–1.74). In comparison,
the bipolar II SUD associations were not statistically signiﬁcant (12-month prevalence
OR 1.3, 95% CI 10.64–2.69; lifetime prevalence OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.64–2.56). Among indi-
viduals with 12-month and lifetime SUD only a minority of 13.5% and 24.6% received
treatment, respectively.

A recent meta-analysis reports on a prevalence of cannabis use of 24% (95% CI: 18–29;
k = 35; n = 51,756) in people with BD. Cannabis use was signiﬁcantly associated with being
younger, male, and single; having fewer years of education and an earlier onset of affective
symptoms [14].

These more recent epidemiological studies support previous results [7]. A large survey
of major psychiatric disorders in ﬁve major metropolitan areas in the United States named
the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study found that BD had the second-highest rate
of SUDs compared to any other major psychiatric disorders, only topped by antisocial
personality disorder [15]. Data of 463,003 patients were included in a large population-
based cohort study of the prevalence of SUD among the Danish population [16]. The
lifetime prevalence of SUD was almost one-third (32%) in patients with any BD. However,
alcohol use disorder accounted for 25% of the prevalence rate of the SUDs.

A meta-analysis of epidemiological surveys on BD and SUD comorbidity between 2009
and 2014 included nine studies, of which two were repeated 10 years later in independent
samples [3]. The sample size included n = 218,397 individuals. Strong statistical associations
were detected between BD and illicit drug use (pooled OR 4.96; 95% CI 3.98–6.17). The
association was higher for BD I individuals using illicit drugs compared to bipolar II
respondents (ORs 7.48 vs. 3.30).

2.3. Comorbidity Rates of Substance Use Disorder and Bipolar Disorder in Clinical Settings

In a review and meta-analysis of clinical studies, 22 multi-site and 56 individual,
mostly single-site studies reporting co-morbidity rates of SUD and BD in inpatients or
outpatients were identiﬁed by systematic literature search [17]. The meta-analysis demon-
strated that, next to alcohol (42%), the most frequent substance used in individuals with BD
was cannabis (20%) followed by any drug use disorder, mostly cocaine and amphetamines
(17%). Males had a higher lifetime SUD risk than females. BD with SUD had an earlier age
at onset and a slightly higher rate of hospitalizations than BD without SUD. The highest
rates of comorbid BD and SUD were reported in US samples, the lowest in Asian studies.
Of note, the inﬂuence of SUD on recovery from an episode of bipolar depression
appears to be minimal according to a prospective US study. In a large outpatient treatment
sample (STEP-BD: Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder),
2154 individuals with an index episode of bipolar depression completed the two years
follow-up. Of these subjects, 1528 had no history of a SUD, while n = 468 (21.7%) had
a past SUD and n = 158 (7.3%) had a current SUD. The median SUD age of onset was
19.0 ± 6.3 years (compared to comorbid alcohol use disorders of 18.6 ± 7.5 years). Survival
analysis was applied to examine the time to recovery for each group and revealed that
median recovery time in individuals with no SUD was 200 days, in subjects with past
drug disorders 224 days and 184 days for those with current drug use disorders with no
statistical signiﬁcance across groups. However, those with current or past substance use
disorder were more likely to experience a switch from depression directly into a manic,

Medicina 2021, 57, 1256

hypomanic, or mixed episode without a symptom-free interval [18], suggestive of greater
mood instability in BD with SUD.

In summary, both epidemiological and clinical studies conﬁrm the high co-incidence
of drug use disorders in bipolar patients. On average, higher rates of SUD are reported
in Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II patients. Some studies also report that cannabis is the most
frequently consumed illicit substance in BD subjects while other illicit substance use
disorders are less frequent, but still more common than in the general population.

3. Diagnosing Illicit Drug Use Disorder in Bipolar Subjects and Vice Versa

Whereas the Alcohol use disorder Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) [19] appears a reliable
instrument also in bipolar subjects [7,20], the diagnosis of comorbid SUD other than alcohol
in individuals with bipolar disorder relies mainly on the clinical assessment and thus is
subjective to the interviewer’s bias. The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) [21] can support
the diagnosis of SUD and appears reliable in a mixed sample of psychiatric outpatients [22],
however, so far it has not been systematically examined in patients with BD.

The reverse is also true as it is often difﬁcult to establish a ﬁrm bipolar diagnosis in
people with illicit drug use, as both the short-term psychological and behavioral effects, e.g.,
euphoria, disinhibition, psychotic features, as well as the long-term consequences, such as
depression, cognitive decline and personality changes mimic bipolar symptoms and are
easily attributed to drug use without further exploration of bipolarity. Thus, it is important
to delineate the temporal coincidence between behavioral changes and drug consumption,
own history prior to the start of SUD, family history of mood disorders, etc. Instruments,
such as the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-33 [23]) or the Mood Disorder Questionnaire
(MDQ [24]) support the diagnostic procedure but may produce false positives in people
with SUD.

4. Motivations and Consequences of Comorbid SUD in People with Bipolar Disorder

Overall, motives for consuming illicit drugs in individuals with BD do not differ
from people with BD and primary SUD (SUD before the onset of BD). The most frequent
reasons include improving mood, relieving tension, alleviating boredom, escape from
reality, achieving/maintaining euphoria and increasing energy [25]. However, bipolar
individuals might also seek relief by self-medication or even try to mimic hypomanic
and manic states which they consider as the desirable mood state [26] (“addiction to
mania”, meaning that the subjects experienced mania as a sensation that he/she wants to
achieve and maintain as it gilds an otherwise pervasive lack of self-esteem.). The use of
amphetamines or cocaine may induce or prolong manic periods with high levels of energy
and excitement. During depressive episodes, stimulants are used as an attempt to alleviate
depressive mood or low energy level. Sedatives are often consumed to numb sadness,
anxiety symptoms, or hopelessness.

SUD in people with BD is associated with a multitude of negative consequences, inﬂu-
encing the course and prognosis of BD. In general, psychiatric comorbidity and especially
drug abuse in BD is associated with a higher severity, expressed as more relapses, the
worse overall course of the disease, reduced response to pharmacological treatments, such
as lithium and also an increased risk for suicide attempts or suicide (see Table 1) [27–29].
In addition, cannabis use has been shown to strongly increase the risk of a ﬁrst BD episode
(OR 4.98) [30]. Substance abuse in early childhood can be an early symptom of BD, and
also lead to misdiagnosis of a primary SUD. There are complex interactions between BD
and SUD regarding time to ﬁrst treatment. Lagerberg and colleagues showed that the risk
of long treatment delays was increased in patients with BD and excessive substance use,
deﬁned as meeting criteria for a DSM-IV SUD. In primary BD, the risk for developing
excessive substance use was increased in males, in patients with shorter education and but
also in patients with longer treatment delays of BD [31]. In general, bipolar patients with
a history of SUD were shown to be more likely to receive no or inadequate treatment for
BD compared to bipolar patients without a history of addiction [32]. Furthermore, SUD is

Medicina 2021, 57, 1256

5 of 14

associated with more affective instability in bipolar subjects. In the Systematic Treatment
Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) trial including 3750 bipolar subjects,
a history of addiction increased the risk of switching into manic, hypomanic, or mixed
phases after depression [18]. SUD also appears to increase the risk to commit violent
crimes in individuals with BD. Fazel et al. [33] analyzed records of 3700 patients with BD
compared to 37.000 controls over 30 years regarding the occurrence of violent crime in
Sweden. 8.4% of individuals with bipolar committed violent crimes compared with 3.5%
of general population controls. The risk was mostly conﬁned to patients with substance
use comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 6.4) and was only minimal increased in patients
without substance abuse comorbidity (adjusted OR: 1.3).

SUD is a major reason for an increased relative lifetime risk for chronic infectious
diseases, such as HIV or chronic hepatitis C. Mathew and colleagues analyzed retrospec-
tively collected data of 325,410 patients, seen between 1998 and 2004 within facilities and
clinics of the Veterans Integrated Service Network, regarding HCV-Infection, comparing
BD patients with and without SUD. Overall, all BD patients were at increased risk for HCV
infection compared to controls. However, while patients with BD only had a relative risk
(RR) of 1.36, the relative risk increased in patients with SUD (4.86) and even more in the
group with BD and SUD (RR: 5.46) [34]. Table 1 summarizes the most detrimental effects
of SUD in people with BD.

5. Treatment of Comorbid Bipolar Disorder and Substance Use Disorder

Compared to comorbid AUD and BD [4], much less is known about the optimized
treatment of comorbid BD and illicit substance use. Given the wide variety and modes of
action of illicit substances and drugs of dependence potential, treatment needs to be rather
individual. Speciﬁc recommendations for pharmacotherapies with some level of evidence
exist for BD with comorbid cannabis and cocaine use, and with a very low grade of evidence
expert opinion, case series and open studies for heroin, amphetamine, methamphetamine,
and polysubstance SUD comorbid with BD [35]. For psychotherapies and socio-therapies,
recommendations are not substance-speciﬁc and focus more on the interplay between BD
and addiction in general.

5.1. Pharmacotherapies of Comorbid BD and Illicit Substance Use

The 2012 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recom-
mends adding valproate to lithium in BD patients with cannabis or cocaine use disorder [35],
based on open and retrospective studies [36–39]. In 2019, Coles and coworkers published
a systematic review including open and controlled studies in BD comorbid with SUD,
ranging from tobacco to opioids, with the majority looking into AUD [40]. Most studies
are open, non-randomized and have small to moderate sample sizes. However, there
are also a few randomized, controlled studies that included comorbid BD subjects with
cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine or opioids use, summarized in Table 2. Firm conclusions
or recommendations, however, are almost impossible as the majority of trials included
people with diverse SUD without differentiating results according to the substance of abuse.
There is only one RCT conducted in methamphetamine-only users, two in cocaine-only
users and none in cannabis-only users. If at all, the only conclusions with some degree
of certainty in BD co-morbid with illicit substance use disorder are that (1) lithium and
valproate are effective for mood symptoms and may reduce substance use (probably as
an indirect effect due to improved mood stability), and (2) that the neuroprotective agent
citicoline reduces cocaine consumption.

A small (n = 22) placebo-controlled, crossover, multimodal-MRI pilot study, link-
ing neurobiology and clinical outcomes, reported on a potential beneﬁt of gabapentin
(1200 mg/d) in BD with comorbid cannabis use disorder [43]. Subjects taking gabapentin
and having elevations of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex GABA levels in the MRI expe-
rienced lower manic/mixed and depressive symptoms. Elevations of right basal ganglia
glutamate levels and posterior midcingulate cortex activation to cannabis cues were also as-
sociated with lower cannabis use in participants randomized to gabapentin [43]. However,
large conﬁrmative trials supporting the use of gabapentin in BD with comorbid cannabis
use disorder are still missing, and the effectiveness of gabapentin in BD without SUD and
in cannabis use disorder is equivocal or vague [50–52].

More recently and based on the proposed neurobiological aberration in SUD and BD,
D2/D3 receptor partial agonists attract attention as a possible medication of interest. A
recent case report on cariprazine an effective medication in BD [53]—in methamphetamine
use disorder [54] argues for further evaluation in RCTs.

Of note, and contrasting its observed detrimental effects in BD subjects [55,56], some
investigators also suggest a potential therapeutic role for cannabis derivative in BD [57].
The endocannabinoid system is known to exert neuro-modulatory effects on other neu-
rotransmitter systems critical in controlling emotions [58]. Selective activation of the
cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) and antagonism of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) may al-
leviate the symptoms of BD and, according to Arjmand and colleagues [59], should be
rigorously explored. This is in line with genetic ﬁndings suggesting that carriers of a
speciﬁc variant of CB1 are also at higher risk of developing BD [60].

5.2. Psychosocial Therapies of Comorbid BD and Illicit Substance Use Disorders

Over the last decades, speciﬁc psycho and socio-therapeutic interventions have been
developed and tested for BD comorbid with SUD; however, they target almost exclusively
BD with comorbid AUD [4]. Different from the traditional paradigm to achieve complete
abstinence ﬁrst before focusing on mood, it appears nowadays to be common sense that
group and individual integrated psychotherapies which address both disorders are more
effective than interventions focusing on either disorder alone [7,20]. To deﬁne the focus
of psychotherapy in an individual bipolar client with comorbid SUD it is important to
understand how clients perceive the relationship between BD and SUD. The study by
Healey and colleagues [61] relates the use of substances to either decrease or intensify
mood symptoms, cope with living with BD, feel normal, or manage stress. Other factors
reported by bipolar patients are related to self-medication, feelings of increased conﬁdence,
rejection of prescribed medication, easy access and living in a culture of substance use [62].
The ﬁndings from these qualitative studies are in line with those from a cross-sectional
study that found that people with BD use substances to improve mood, relieve tension,
alleviate boredom, achieve or maintain euphoria, and increase energy [25]. When subjects
with comorbidity were asked what they consider as important for achieving recovery,
support, individualized treatment, hope, a new sense of identity and having meaning-
ful daily activities were considered as essential [63], and may set agenda and goals for
psychotherapeutic interventions.

A recent systematic review by Crowe and colleagues [64] identiﬁed only ﬁve studies
of psychotherapy for BD and two studies of integrated psychotherapy for comorbid BD
and SUD that were methodologically acceptable to be included in their review. Inclusion
criteria were randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy as an adjunct to medication,
individual and group interventions, manualized interventions, English language of the
papers which were published until November 2019. Of these studies, none focused on
BD with comorbid illicit drug use but on SUD in general, in most instances AUD. There
was a considerable variation in type and duration of approaches: Individual and group
therapy, type of intervention (Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT), Systematic
Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) intensive psychotherapy
(cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), IPSRT, family focused therapy or collaborative care),

Medicina 2021, 57, 1256

CBT and integrated group therapy. The duration ranged from 12 weeks to 27 months [64],
and all studies investigated only mood-related outcomes, but not changes in SUD measures.
The good news is that when trying to summarize the main ﬁndings of the studies, it appears
that the intuitive hypothesis that SUD delays recovery and promotes recurrences of mood
episodes cannot be positively proven; most studies indicate no signiﬁcant differences
between BD with or without SUD. Again, these results are mainly derived from BD
patients with AUD with only a minority using other substances.

Evidence, but not speciﬁc for BD, that psycho-social therapies might also ameliorate
substance use came from a randomized clinical trial of a six-month, twice-weekly program,
named “Behavioral treatment for drug abuse in people with severe and persistent mental
illness” (BTSAS) program [65]. The BTSAS program is a social learning intervention that
includes motivational interviewing, a urinalysis contingency, and social skills training.
One hundred and twenty-nine affectively stabilized outpatients meeting DSM IV criteria
for drug dependence (cocaine, heroin, or cannabis) and serious mental illness (39.5% with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; 55.8% major affective disorders including BDs)
were included and received either BTSAS or a supportive group discussion treatment
(STAR as a control condition). Primary outcome measures were abstinence veriﬁed by
twice-weekly urine analysis and time until dropping out of treatment (dropout deﬁned as
missing eight consecutive sessions). The BTSAS program was signiﬁcantly more effective
than STAR in the percentage of clean urine test results, survival in treatment, and attendance
at sessions. Post hoc, exploratory analyses on a number of ancillary clinical outcomes
demonstrated a signiﬁcant decline in the number of hospitalizations, more money available
for living expenses, and an increase in general life satisfaction.

6. Conclusions

Drug and alcohol abuse in subjects with severe and chronic mental illness, such as
BD, is one of the major challenges the public mental health system has to deal with. These
people pose major problems not only for themselves, but also their social environment,
including family, friends, health care professionals, and the mental health system. The
lifetime prevalence of substance use disorders has been estimated up to 56% for subjects
with BD. AUD is most prevalent, but ﬁgures of approximately 25% for substance use other
than alcohol and tobacco, mainly cannabis and cocaine, are also substantial. SUD tends
to begin early in the course of BD, complicates and delays the correct diagnosis and has a
profound impact on almost every domain of functioning and needs. SUD in BD predicts
a more severe course of illness, more frequent hospitalizations, more frequent relapses,
and a poorer course of illness in comparison to BD subjects without SUD. BD with SUD
is associated with higher rates of violence and suicide. Finally, higher rates and costs of
service utilization, as well as poorer treatment adherence resulting in inferior treatment
outcomes call for the need for intensive and comprehensive treatment programs.

The treatment of patients with dual disorders requires an inclusive and multidisci-
plinary approach, integrating both psychiatric and substance abuse treatment. Ideally, and
similar to BD with comorbid AUD, treatment of BD and illicit drug use disorder should
be in parallel, not successive, in one place and coordinated by a named, accessible and
responsible care coordinator [66]. Treatment should be understood as a process being
in ﬂux in which the motivation to reduce substance use might change and that needs
an integrated treatment agenda and setting addressing both disorders. Finally, a harm-
reduction model appears more appropriate than an abstinence model, especially during
the early stages of treatment when the patient has an uncertain motivation for change [65].
The pharmacological treatment should focus on stabilization of mood after detoxiﬁcation
rather than focusing on substance abstinence. Psychotherapy, however, should include
both; therapies for BD should be combined with behavioral treatments for drug abuse
and abstinence tests with urine analysis. Although illicit drug use disorders are one of
the most frequent comorbidities in BD and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences clinical outcome, there
are still only a few studies focusing on neurobiological commonalities, or RCTs that have

Medicina 2021, 57, 1256

11 of 14

investigated the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic or pharmacological treatments for BD
with illicit drug use comorbidity. The fact that bipolar subjects with a history of SUD
are usually excluded from clinical trials signiﬁcantly limits the generalizability of RCT
ﬁndings to the ‘real life’ patient with BD. Speciﬁc research is clearly needed to develop
better treatment strategies in BD with illicit drug use.

7. Limitations

This narrative review summarizes current knowledge regarding illicit drug use in
individuals with BD. The review focuses on illicit drug use, and therefore, does not include
data about AUD, cigarette smoking, or the ﬁeld of behavioral addictions, such as gambling
disorder, which is also prevalent in subjects with BD. The review is mainly based on expert
opinion and is not a systematic review including a systematic search of the literature. Thus,
there is a chance that relevant contributions and articles have been missed.
