Abstract

Immune dysregulation has been found to be related to a diagnosis of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD). However, investigations in very early childhood examining immunological 
abnormalities such as altered neonatal cytokine/chemokine profiles in association with an aberrant 
developmental trajectory, are sparse. We assessed neonatal blood spots from 398 children, 
including 171 with ASD, which were subdivided according to severity (121 severe, 50 mild/
moderate) and cognitive/adaptive levels (144 low-functioning, 27 typical to high-functioning). The 
remainder were 69 children with developmental delay (DD), and 158 with typical development 
(TD), who served as controls in the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment 
(CHARGE) study. Exploratory analysis suggested that, in comparisons with TD and DD, CTACK 
(CCL27) and MPIF-1 (CCL23), respectively, were independently associated with ASD. Higher 
neonatal levels of CTACK were associated with decreased odds of ASD compared to TD (odds 
ratio [OR]= 0.40, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.21, 0.77), whereas higher levels of MPIF-1 were 
associated with increased odds of ASD (OR= 2.38, 95% Cl 1.42, 3.98) compared to DD but not 
to TD. MPIF-1 was positively associated with better scores in several developmental domains. 
Dysregulation of chemokine levels in early life can impede normal immune and neurobehavioral 
development, which can lead to diagnosis of ASD or DD. This study collectively suggests that 
certain peripheral chemokines at birth are associated with ASD progression during childhood and 
that children with ASD and DD have distinct neonatal chemokine profiles that can differentiate 
their diagnoses.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is composed of a group of complex neurodevelopmental 
disorders that are characterized clinically by deficits in communication, social interactions, 
and restricted or stereotyped behaviors (Baio et al., 2018). The latest reported prevalence 
is as high as one out of every 54 children in the U.S. (Maenner et al., 2020). While 
ASD can sometimes be reliably diagnosed by the age of two, the ability to accurately 
diagnose ASD depends on behavioral assessments and developmental history (Hyman et 
al., 2020; Lord et al., 2006). Biological signatures or biomarkers could provide a method 
for early ASD risk assessment, advancing the identification of at-risk children earlier than 
current behavioral methods (Frye et al., 2019). Effective biomarkers could also facilitate 
classification of disease by severity and behavior, increasing the efficacy of monitoring 
response to therapeutic intervention. As reviewed by Hughes et al., numerous findings have 
supported links of the child’s immune dysfunction with their ASD diagnosis, as well as 
with the immune profile of their mothers (Hughes et al., 2018). Cytokines and chemokines 
have the potential to serve as biomarker candidates, as alterations in their profile provide 
an overview of immune system status. Growing evidence demonstrates that unique cytokine/
chemokine profiles in individuals with ASD can be associated with symptom severity, 
aberrant behaviors, and impaired cognitive/adaptive function (Ashwood et al., 2011; Han et 
al., 2017; Heuer et al., 2019; Krakowiak et al., 2017; Masi et al., 2017; Zerbo et al., 2014). 
However, the heterogeneity in individuals’ demographics, cytokine/chemokine profiles, and 
prior study designs are hindering the determination of immune biomarkers as predictors of 
ASD. For example, some studies have demonstrated increased plasma levels of monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and RANTES in ASD patients (Ashwood et al., 2011; 
Han et al., 2017), whereas others observed decreased levels of RANTES in the newborn 
blood samples of children with ASD (Zerbo et al., 2014) or found comparable levels of 
MCP-1 in newborn bloodspots from control and ASD groups (Heuer et al., 2019). In the 
neonatal blood spot study by Krakowiak et al., IL-1β was positively associated with mild 
to moderate ASD (Krakowiak et al., 2017); however, in the study by Masi et al., severe 
ASD was associated with decreased level of IL-1β in females only (Masi et al., 2017). 
Possible explanations for these differences range from phenotypic heterogeneity, a polygenic 
etiology, a difference in time from birth to sample collection, and advances in technology. 
Although identifying a consistent postnatal biomarker for ASD remains challenging, it is 
promising that research on peripheral or neonatal cytokines and chemokines as predictors of 
ASD is growing.

Previous findings by our group demonstrated that neonatal IL-1β and IL-4 are independently 
associated with ASD, using newborn blood spots archived by Childhood Autism Risks 
from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) (Krakowiak et al., 2017). Children with 
severe ASD were more likely to have elevated IL-4 levels, whereas mild to moderate ASD

symptoms were associated with increased levels of IL-1β. IL-4 was also a marker for the 
differentiation between children with severe ASD and those with mild to moderate ASD. 
Both cytokines were correlated with behavioral and developmental scores (Krakowiak et al., 
2017). As an extension of this previous work, the current study utilized an expanded sample 
set of archived dried neonatal blood spot samples, as well as a broader array of cytokines 
and chemokines to investigate cytokine/chemokine levels from children later diagnosed with 
ASD or with developmental delay (DD) without autism, compared to children with typical 
development (TD). We further subdivided ASD individuals into groups based on symptom 
severity and developmental and adaptive functions to identify predictors of ASD.

Methods and materials

Participants

Archived neonatal blood spot samples corresponding to 398 children who enrolled in the 
Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study (Hertz-
Picciotto et al., 2006) between April 2003 and May 2009 with confirmed diagnoses (171 
with ASD, 69 with DD, and 158 with TD) were used for cytokine/chemokine analysis. 
The CHARGE study is a population-based case-control study investigating risk factors for 
neurodevelopmental disorders, with participants from three groups: children with ASD, DD, 
and general population controls with TD. Eligible children were 2–5 years old, born in 
California, lived with a biological parent who spoke English or Spanish, and resided in 
selected regional center catchment areas at the time of recruitment. Consent was acquired 
from parents prior to participation. The CHARGE Study protocol was approved by the 
institutional review boards (IRB) at the University of California, Davis and Los Angeles, as 
well as the State of California Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.

Diagnostic Confirmation

Diagnostic confirmation of the children (2–5 years of age) was performed at the University 
of California, Davis, MIND (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) 
Institute. Cognitive and adaptive functions were evaluated with Mullen Scales of Early 
Learning (MSEL) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), respectively. The 
Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule (ADOS) confirmed a diagnosis of ASD. The Social Communication Questionnaire 
was used to screen controls for ASD; children with scores ≥15 were evaluated with ADI-R 
and ADOS. Children with ASD (n=171) were subdivided according to 2-subgroups by 
severity and cognitive/adaptive functions. Using ADOS comparison scores and DSM-IV 
criteria, children showing a score of ≥7 were grouped into severe ASD symptoms (ASDsev 
[n=121]) and children exhibiting a score of <7 were categorized as mild/moderate symptoms 
(ASDmild [n=50]). Controls with TD had no prior diagnosis of ASD or DD, and their 
composite scores on MSEL and VABS were ≥70. Controls with DD had composite scores 
<70 on MSEL and/or VABS. Children with ASD who were within the typical cognitive and 
adaptive developmental range (both MSEL and VABS composite standard scores of ≥70) 
were grouped as typical to high-functioning ASD (ASDhi [n=27]). Those with cognitive 
and/or adaptive delays were grouped as low-functioning ASD (ASDlo [n=144]). Children 
who met the criteria for ASD were reclassified to the ASD group.

Behavioral and Developmental Assessments

Aberrant Behavior Checklist—Maladaptive behavior assessment was performed using 
the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) whose subscales included irritability (15 items), 
lethargy/social withdrawal (16 items), stereotypy (7 items), and hyperactivity (16 items). 
Each item was rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all a problem) to 3 
(problem severe in degree).

Mullen Scales of Early Learning—MSEL is a standardized assessment used to 
determine cognitive development in young children. The scales include visual reception 
(nonverbal cognitive ability), fine motor, receptive language (language comprehension), and 
expressive language (language production). For each scale and composite, developmental 
quotients were calculated (by age equivalent/chronological age × 100) to overcome the floor 
effect.

Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales—VABS is a standardized assessment to determine 
the level of personal and social skills needed for everyday living. The domains are 
communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills. Developmental quotients 
were calculated as described above.

Blood Spot Specimen collection

Capillary blood was collected within 48 h of birth by heel stick method and spotted onto 
standardized filter paper for testing of various disorders as part of the Genetic Disease 
Screening Program. The remaining blood spots were stored at −20°C by the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH).

Blood Spot Elution

Three 3 mm punches of dried blood spot specimen were put into a single well in a 96-well 
plate and stored at −80°C until elution. In each well, 200 μl of elution buffer (phosphate-
buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors [Complete Protease 
Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana]) was added. Plates 
were placed on a plate shaker overnight at 4°C and the eluates analyzed immediately 
following elution.

Total protein concentration

Following elution, a small 4μl aliquot was used for bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo 
Scientific, Rockford, IL) to determine total protein and to normalize cytokine/chemokine 
levels against blood sample quantity variation (Heuer et al., 2019).

Cytokine and Chemokine Measurement

Blood spot cytokine and chemokine levels were measured using Bio-Plex Luminex (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA) assays. Using a 40-plex chemokine panel, cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1β, 
IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-16, TNF-α and chemokines IL-8, 6Ckine (CCL21), BCA-1 
(CXCL13), CTACK (CCL27), ENA78 (CXCL5), eotaxin (CCL11), eotaxin-2 (CCL24), 
eotaxin-3 (CCL26), fractalkine (CX3CL2), GCP-2 (CXCL6), GM-CSF, Gro-α (CXCL1),

Gro-β (CXCL2), I-309 (CCL1), IP-10 (CXCL10), I-TAC (CXCL11), MCP-1 (CCL2), 
MCP-2 (CCL8), MCP-3 (CCL7), MCP-4 (CCL13), MDC (CCL22), MIF, MIG (CXCL9), 
MIP-1α (CCL3), MIP-1δ (CCL15), MIP-3α (CCL20), MIP-3β (CCL19), MPIF-1 (CCL23), 
SCYB16 (CXCL16), SDF-1α/β (CXCL12), TARC (CCL17), and TECK (CCL25) were 
measured according to the manufacturer’s directions. IL-12p70 and IL-13 (Bio-Rad) were 
also included as individual analytes to expand the 40-plex panel. Briefly, the blood spot 
eluate (50 μl) was incubated with fluorescent-labeled capture antibody-coated beads in 
a 96-well plate (shaking) for 1 h at RT. The sample-bead mix was removed, washed, 
and biotinylated detection antibodies added for 30 min at RT with shaking. The reaction 
mixture was then incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin at RT for 10 min (shaking). 
After washing, the beads were resuspended in sheath fluid on the plate shaker for 5 min. The 
plates were read on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and 
analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A five-parameter curve 
was used to calculate final concentrations (pg/ml). Reference samples were run on each plate 
for assay consistency. All samples were run blinded to child developmental outcome.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed on cytokine/chemokine levels in blood spot eluates 
from 398 children. Each immune marker was normalized for sampling variation in 
blood collection by dividing total protein content in the eluate (as determined by BCA 
assay). Cytokine/chemokine concentrations that fell below the minimum level of detection 
(MLD) were assigned a value of MLD/√2, and all cytokines/chemokines were natural log-
transformed to normalize the distribution. GM-CSF, IL-12p70 and IL-13 levels were not 
detectable for >25% of the samples and were excluded from further analysis. All remaining 
cytokines/chemokines were above the MLD for ≥97% of the samples (Supplementary Table 
1). Analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina).

Primary analyses examined the associations between individual cytokine/chemokine levels 
and child diagnosis using multinomial logistic regression. Mild and severe ASD cases were 
also examined separately in relation to DD and TD groups. Covariates in initial model fitting 
included mother’s education attainment, gestational age, child’s sex, age (hours) at blood 
spot collection, and years between blood spot collection and elution. Akaike information 
criterion (AIC) was used to select best model fit (Vreugdenhil et al., 2018).

The cytokines/chemokines was also modeled together as predictors and adjusted for 
covariates in a series of binary models (outcomes were ASD vs. TD, ASD vs. DD, DD 
vs. TD, ASDsev vs. ASDmild , ASDsev vs. TD, ASDmild vs. TD, ASDsev vs. DD, ASDmild 
vs. DD, ASDhi vs. ASDlo, ASDhi vs. TD, ASDlo vs. TD, ASDhi vs. DD and ASDlo 
vs. DD) using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) variable 
selection method (Tibshirani, 1996) to identify a parsimonious subset of cytokines and 
chemokines that was most strongly associated with the child’s diagnosis. For example, if 
several cytokines were highly correlated with one another and associated with a particular 
diagnosis, LASSO selected one of those cytokines for inclusion in a model. Adjustments 
for multiple comparisons were not performed for these exploratory analyses and to preclude

failing to detect immune markers that show promise in their ability to differentiate between 
diagnostic groups.

Secondary analyses were stratified by child’s diagnosis and examined associations 
between the LASSO-selected cytokines/chemokines and developmental/behavioral domains 
measured by ABC, MSEL and VABS.

Results

Participant demographics

TD controls were frequency-matched to cases with ASD in 4:1 male-to-female ratio to 
ensure similar proportions of male/female participants in both groups (Table 1). This was 
not the case for the DD group where 70% were male, with 30% were female. In terms 
of birth season, fewer children with ASD and DD were born in the spring compared to 
children with TD (18% and 17% vs. 29%). Birth year was statistically different between 
populations, with ASD participants weighted toward the later years in the study (2003–
2006), while DD and TD participants were distributed more toward the middle of the study, 
peaking in 2003. The average gestational age for all three groups was similar (TD 39.3 
weeks, ASD 39.6 weeks, DD 39.1 weeks). However, newborn age at the time of blood spot 
collection was statistically different among the three groups. The maternal education status 
of those in the DD group demonstrated fewer mothers with a bachelor’s degree compared 
to mothers of children with TD and those in the ASD group (35% vs. 56% and 50%). 
There were no differences in regional catchment areas among the three groups as the TD 
controls were frequency-matched to a projected distribution of ASD cases for the regional 
center catchment area. In addition, no differences were found between cases with ASD and 
controls with TD or DD in terms of race/ethnicity, years between blood spot collection and 
elution, maternal age at delivery, or maternal allergies and asthma. The cases and controls 
were evenly distributed across the assay plates such that even representation of each study 
population was run on each plate.

Associations between neonatal cytokine and chemokine levels and child diagnosis

Comparison in total groups: ASD vs. TD, DD vs. TD and ASD vs. DD—
We conducted multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for maternal education 
attainment, gestational age, child’s age at blood spot collection, and years from blood spot 
collection to elution to determine the associations between individual cytokines/chemokines 
and ASD, regardless of symptom severity, compared to DD and TD. Overall, children 
with ASD and DD had significantly lower neonatal concentrations of nearly all cytokines 
and chemokines, and none were significantly higher, compared with concentrations in TD 
children (Fig. 1A, Table 2A). No sex differences were observed in cytokine/chemokine 
levels.

MDC (CCL22) and MPIF-1 (CCL23) emerged as the only chemokines whose 
concentrations at birth differed significantly between ASD and DD. Higher levels of MDC 
and MPIF-1 were each associated with a two-fold increased likelihood of having an ASD vs. 
DD diagnosis (MDC: OR=1.96, 95% Cl 1.09, 3.53; MPIF-1: OR=1.97, 95% Cl 1.26, 3.09)

(Fig. 1A, Table 2A). MDC and MPIF-1 concentrations were also significantly higher in TD 
than DD but did not differentiate between ASD and TD.

Neonatal levels of Gro-β (CXCL2), IL-4 and MCP-4 (CCL13), were significantly decreased 
in ASD compared to TD but did not differ between DD and TD (Table 2A). Meanwhile, 
GCP-2 (CXCL6) was significantly decreased in DD compared to TD but not differ between 
ASD and TD (Table 2A). In addition, significant decreases in the levels of chemokines 
MIP-1δ (OR=0.54, 95% Cl 0.31, 0.96), MIP-3α (OR=0.39, 95% Cl 0.16, 0.94) and MIP-3β 
(OR=0.61, 95% Cl 0.41, 0.91) were noted only in DD compared to TD, while level of 
MIP-1α was significantly lower in both ASD vs TD (OR=0.36, 95% Cl 0.15, 0.88) and DD 
vs TD (OR=0.34, 95% Cl 0.12, 0.99) (Table 2A).

Comparison by symptom severity: ASDsev vs. ASDmild, ASDsev/ASDmild vs. 
TD and ASDsev/ASDmild vs. DD—We subdivided ASD cases into severe and mild/
moderate groups based on symptom severity (ASDsev and ASDmild) to examine differences 
in ASD subgroups and to compare the subgroups with TD and DD groups in models 
adjusted for the same covariates as described earlier. None of the neonatal cytokines and 
chemokines differed significantly between ASDsev and ASDmild (Fig. 1B, Supplementary 
Table 2). Therefore, we observed similar trends in association between individual cytokine/
chemokine levels and diagnosis for comparisons between subgroups ASDsev and ASDmild 
with TD and DD. Overall, regardless of the symptom severity, both ASD subgroups had 
lower level of cytokines and chemokines compared to TD (Table 2B-1). However, some 
cytokines/chemokines, namely, 6Ckine (CCL21), eotaxin-3 (CCL26), Gro-β (CXCL2), 
I-TAC (CXCL11), MCP-2 (CCL8; OR=0.47, 95% Cl 0.26), MCP-4 (CCL13), TARC 
(CCL17) and TNFα were significantly decreased in ASDsev compared to TD but did not 
differ when comparing ASDmild to TD (Table 2B-1). Meanwhile, IFN-γ, IL-6 and MIP-1α 
(CCL3) levels were significantly decreased in ASDmild compared to TD but did not differ 
between ASDsev and TD (Table 2B-1).

In contrast, the levels of most cytokines and chemokines did not differ significantly when 
we compared the two subgroups of ASD with DD except for MDC (CCL22) and MPIF-1 
(CCL23) (Table 2B-2). Higher levels of MPIF-1 were associated with a 1.9-fold higher 
likelihood of ASDsev (OR=1.87, 95% CI 1.16, 3.00) and a 2.3-fold higher likelihood 
of ASDmild relative to DD (OR=2.26, 95% CI 1.23, 4.16) (Table 2B-2). MDC was the 
only chemokine that differentiated between ASDsev and ASDmild compared to DD; higher 
neonatal levels of MDC were associated with a 2.3-fold higher likelihood of ASDmild 
relative to DD (OR=2.30, 95% CI 1.03, 5.16) but did not differ significantly between 
ASDsev and DD (Table 2B-2).

Comparison by cognitive and adaptive development: ASDhi vs. ASDlo, ASDhi/
ASDlo vs. TD and ASDhi/ASDlo vs. DD—Next, we subdivided the ASD group 
into typically-to-high- (ASDhi) and low-functioning (ASDlo) subgroups according to the 
children’s cognitive and adaptive development level based on the MSEL and VABS scores 
to examine associations between cytokine/chemokine levels and cognitive/adaptive function 
in children with ASD. Most neonatal cytokines and chemokines did not differ significantly 
between ASDhi and ASDlo except for MCP-1 (CCL2) (Fig. 1C, Table 2C-1). Higher levels

of MCP-1 were associated with a 3.2-fold higher likelihood of ASDhi relative to ASDlo 
(OR=3.18, 95% CI 1.23, 8.26) (Table 2C-1).

For comparisons of the ASD subgroups with TD, we observed significantly lower levels of 
cytokines/chemokines 6Ckine (CCL21), CTACK (CCL27), eotaxin (CCL11), I-309 (CCL1), 
MIF, SDF-1α/β (CXCL12), TECK (CCL25), TNFα, in both ASDhi and ASDlo relative 
to TD (Table 2C-1). Meanwhile, the levels of cytokines/chemokines BCA-1 (CXCL13), 
eotaxin-3 (CCL26), IL-2, IL-6, IP-10 (CXCL10), I-TAC (CXCL11), MCP-2 (CCL8), 
MCP-3 (CCL7), MCP-4 (CCL13), MIG (CXCL9), MIP-1α (CCL3), and TARC (CCL17) 
were significantly lower in ASDlo, but not ASDhi, relative to TD (Table 2C-1). The levels 
of two chemokines, GCP-2 (CXCL6) and Gro-β (CXCL2), were only significantly lower in 
ASDhi relative to TD (Table 2C-1).

Comparisons of ASDhi and ASDlo to the DD group revealed significantly higher neonatal 
levels of MDC (CCL22) and MPIF-1 (CCL23) in one or both ASD subgroups relative to DD 
that were not observed relative to TD (Fig. 1C, Table 2C-2). Higher levels of MPIF-1 were 
associated with 2.6-fold higher odds of ASDhi (OR= 2.63, 95% Cl 1.19, 5.79) and 1.9-fold 
higher odds of ASDlo (OR= 1.88, 95% Cl 1.19, 2.97) relative to DD (Table 2C-2). Higher 
levels of MDC were associated with a 2.1-fold higher likelihood of ASDlo (OR= 2.12, 95% 
Cl 1.14, 3.92), but MDC levels did not differ significantly between ASDhi and DD (Table 
2C-2). Higher concentrations of MCP-1 were associated with an a 3.4-fold higher likelihood 
of ASDhi relative to DD (OR= 3.42, 95% Cl 1.25, 9.39), not observed between ASDlo and 
DD (Table 2C-2). MCP-1 concentrations differed significantly between ASDhi and ASDlo as 
described earlier. Interestingly, we did not observe significant differences in MCP-1 levels 
for either ASD subgroup relative to TD (Table 2C-1).

Identifying the strongest subset of predictors associated with ASD and DD: LASSO 
variable selection

After observing the significant differences in numerous cytokine/chemokine concentrations 
among children with ASD, DD, and TD, we conducted an exploratory analysis using 
LASSO to identify the cytokines and chemokines that were most strongly associated with 
child diagnosis, taking the entire cytokine/chemokine profile into account. Chemokines 
CTACK (CCL27), MIF and MPIF-1 (CCL23) emerged as the strongest predictors of child 
diagnosis after conducting a series of binary models with outcomes: ASD vs. TD, ASD 
vs. DD, and DD vs. TD. No predictive immune markers were identified when comparing 
models of the following binary outcomes: ASDsev vs. ASDmild and ASDhi vs. ASDlo. 
Models that compared these ASD subgroups with DD and TD produced the same marker 
selection results as the models that included ASD as a combined group. In addition, no sex 
differences were observed in peripheral CTACK, MIF and MPIF-1 levels.

We conducted multinomial logistic regression with chemokines CTACK (CCL27), MIF and 
MPIF-1 (CCL23) as predictors and adjusted for maternal education attainment, gestational 
age, child’s age at blood spot collection, and years from blood spot collection to elution 
to determine associations with child diagnosis. Higher neonatal levels of CTACK were 
independently associated with a 60% decrease in the odds of ASD relative to TD (OR 0.40; 
95% Cl 0.21, 0.77) (Table 3A), indicating that lower CTACK levels at birth were associated

with ASD. CTACK levels did not differentiate between ASD and DD or between DD and 
TD. Decreased newborn levels of CTACK were particularly associated with ASDsev, ASDhi 
and ASDlo compared with TD (Table 3B–C). In contrast, higher neonatal levels of MPIF-1 
were associated with a 138% increase in the odds of ASD relative to DD (OR 2.38; 95% 
Cl 1.42, 3.98) and a 60% decrease in the odds of DD relative to TD (OR=0.40, 95% CI 
0.24, 0.68) (Table 3A). However, MPIF-1 levels did not differ significantly between ASD 
and TD. We also observed similar significant associations between MPIF-1 levels and all 
ASD subgroups (ASDsev, ASDmild, ASDhi and ASDlo) when compared to DD (Table 3B–
C). MIF no longer differed significantly between ASD and TD or between DD and TD, 
after adjusting for CTACK and MPIF-1 levels. Therefore, from the panel of 39 cytokines/
chemokines examined, CTACK emerged as the strongest predictor of ASD relative to TD 
as well as MPIF-1 for DD relative to TD. No new associations emerged when ASD was 
divided into subsets based on symptom severity or cognitive/adaptive development level.

Associations between CTACK and MPIF-1 levels and development among children with 
ASD

To assess whether neonatal CTACK and MPIF-1 concentrations were independently 
associated with behavioral or developmental patterns evaluated at age 2–5 years, the MSEL 
and VABS scores for each domain were individually modeled using linear regression 
adjusted for maternal education level. Increased MPIF-1 levels were associated with 
better scores on nearly all developmental domains examined (MSEL: fine motor, receptive 
language, expressive language, composite; VABS: communication, daily living skills, 
socialization, motor skills, and composite) among children with ASD, indicating less severe 
behaviors and impairments (Table 4). Meanwhile, CTACK was not significantly associated 
with any domains.

We also examined associations between neonatal CTACK and MPIF-1 levels and cognitive 
and adaptive development levels within the TD and DD groups; however, neither set of 
models revealed any significant associations between MPIF-1 or CTACK levels and the 
developmental domains (data not shown). ABC scales (irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, 
hyperactivity) were not associated with these chemokines within any diagnostic groups (data 
not shown).

Discussion

This study aimed to expand upon previously published work (Krakowiak et al., 2017) using 
a larger sample size, expanding the study population to include children with developmental 
delay without ASD, and an increased repertoire of analytes (42 vs.17) to better assess 
neonatal blood spots for additional immune predictors of risk for ASD and/or developmental 
delay. This study further examined a possible connection between potential early markers 
for cognitive and adaptive development levels of children diagnosed with ASD. Our findings 
suggest that children diagnosed with ASD or DD have lower overall neonatal cytokine/
chemokines levels compared to those with TD, and the cytokine/chemokine profiles of 
children with ASD differ from those with DD. In addition, our exploratory analysis with 
immune markers identified by the LASSO variable selection method demonstrates that

children with ASD were more likely to have decreased neonatal levels of CTACK relative to 
children with TD and higher levels of MPIF-1 relative to children with DD.

The previous study by Krakowiak et al. reported on IL-1β and IL-4 as early markers of 
ASD, where children with ASD had elevated levels of these cytokines depending upon 
their symptom intensity. Elevated IL-4 was associated with increased odds of severe ASD 
whereas IL-1β was associated with increased odds of mild/moderate ASD (Krakowiak et 
al., 2017). In the current study, although these two analytes were included in the study, 
neither IL-1β nor IL-4 were associated with an ASD diagnosis. Rather, lower levels 
of these cytokines were associated with children with DD compared to those with TD. 
Inconsistencies in the findings from this study and the previous one may be attributed to 
several notable methodological differences related to the measurement of immune markers, 
study population size and composition, and analytic approach. The two studies used 
cytokine/chemokine multiplex kits from different vendors, and the current panel had an 
expanded repertoire of 25 more analytes (compared to 17 analytes total in the earlier study) 
that included CTACK and MPIF-1, which were not previously measured. In addition, the 
immune markers in the current study had better detection rates compared to our prior study. 
For example, the current study had nearly all cytokines and chemokines detectable for ≥97% 
of the samples and only three analytes (GM-CSF, IL-12p70, IL-13) were below minimum 
detection levels, while previous study had one-third of the cytokines/chemokines (6 of 17) 
undetectable for >25% of the samples, with below-detection values imputed by multiple 
imputation methods. The current study was also larger with significantly more samples 
for the control groups, thus, providing more statistical power to detect differences among 
diagnostic groups and subgroups. Further, participant characteristics differed with regard 
to the geographic distribution (regional center catchment areas), racial/ethnic composition 
and other sociodemographic characteristics within diagnostic groups between the two study 
cohorts’ area was different. Additionally, the elapsed time before neonatal blood spot 
collection for the DD group was greater compared to that between the ASD and TD 
groups. Finally, the LASSO variable selection method was novel to the current study as 
we wished to expand our analytic approach. Thus, several notable differences in the quality 
and quantity of variables such as number of immune markers, study population size and 
demographic characteristics, and data analysis methods between the two related studies may 
have collectively contributed to contrasting results.

As previous studies have not examined CTACK levels in newborn blood samples 
(Ghassabian et al., 2018; Heuer et al., 2019; Krakowiak et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2011), 
the association between lower CTACK levels at birth and a higher likelihood of severe, 
low- and typical-to-high-functioning ASD relative to TD is a novel finding in this study. 
CTACK, an isoform of CCL27, is best known for its role in skin inflammation and 
lymphocyte trafficking, particularly the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated (CLA+) memory 
T cells (Morales et al., 1999). Numerous findings depict CTACK function in delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reactions and atopic dermatitis in both human and animal models (Chen et 
al., 2006; Kakinuma et al., 2003). Recent studies have suggested that the function of CTACK 
is not restricted to the skin, but rather this chemokine may play a pivotal role in homeostasis 
and immune surveillance in the brain. Serum CCL27 levels have been shown to be increased 
in individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) (Khaiboullina et al., 2015), while a

follow-up study by Blatt et al. suggested that infiltrating T cells into the central nervous 
system (CNS) in MS patients may be of cutaneous origin (Blatt et al., 2016).

While these studies infer the possible role of T cells in the brain regarding CTACK 
production, secretion of CTACK may be independent of T cells but dependent on glial and 
non-neuronal cells that are present in the brain beginning in the early neurodevelopmental 
stages. For example, human astrocytes and neurons are capable of expressing CCL27 
(Arimitsu et al., 2012) and its receptor, CCR10 (Flynn et al., 2003), suggesting both 
autocrine and paracrine effects of the chemokine within the CNS. In addition, expressions 
of CCL27 and CCR10 is abundant in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (Cartier 
et al., 2005; Gunsolly et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2007), cerebral cortex, and other limbic 
structures (Gunsolly et al., 2010) in the adult brain, indicating a critical role of CTACK in 
brain function throughout the lifespan. Immunologically, it is still possible that expression 
of CCL27 in the brain can trigger or modulate chemotaxis of memory T cells to these 
brain regions as the number of infiltrated T cells is at its peak during embryonic day 
16 in the developing mouse brain (Tanabe and Yamashita, 2018). The holistic view of T 
cell involvement in early neurodevelopment is still unclear; however, increasing evidence 
using rodent models depicts the importance of T cell infiltration in maintaining and/or 
modulating CNS development (Clark et al., 2018; Derecki et al., 2010; Filiano et al., 
2016; McGowan et al., 2011; Song et al., 2016). This emphasizes our observation that 
CTACK is indeed important in proper neurodevelopment, and deficient levels of CTACK 
could impede healthy neurodevelopment. Interestingly, neonatal levels of CTACK did not 
differ between children diagnosed with DD compared to those with TD, suggesting that 
the neurodevelopmental outcomes of DD and ASD are immunologically distinct. These 
findings provide support for the potential importance of sufficient levels CTACK in early 
life for healthy neurodevelopment, and thus the molecular basis of neuroimmune and 
neurobehavioral mechanisms involving cells that produce CTACK and express its cognate 
receptor in the CNS should be further examined.

The developmental characteristics of ASD and DD differ from each other in that each of the 
groups displays specific patterns of impairment in communication, cognition, and behaviors 
based on standard diagnostic tests. However, ASD and DD both lie under the spectrum of 
neurodevelopmental disorders, and a diagnosis of DD or ASD can change over time. As the 
behavioral intervention program is designed to address deficits specific to ASD, and because 
it is critical to identify these children as early as possible (Landa, 2018; Nahmias et al., 
2019), it is important to find biomarkers with the potential to differentiate between ASD 
and DD cases. Here, we found that neonatal cytokine and chemokine profiles of children 
with ASD differ from those with DD, particularly that chemokines MDC and MPIF-1 
were significantly lower in children with DD than those with ASD and TD. We did not 
see these differences when comparting ASD to TD subjects. This finding suggests that a 
significant reduction in these two chemokines in the early neonatal period. Specifically, our 
exploratory analysis determined that MPIF-1 was the strongest candidate to differentiate 
between the ASD and DD diagnostic groups, including the subgroups of ASD. Higher 
neonatal concentrations of peripheral MPIF-1 were associated with more than a two-fold 
higher likelihood of ASD compared to DD. This is of interest as a lower level of this 
chemokine at birth could indicate a potential role for MPIF-1 in development of executive

and cognitive function, deficits in which are hallmark features of developmental delay. Of 
interest for future studies would be to design a study to compare neonatal samples from 
ASD with intellectual deficits to DD without ASD in the context of these differentiating 
chemokines.

With respect to function, immunologically, MPIF-1 (as indicated by its name myeloid 
progenitor inhibiting factor 1), inhibits colony formation of bone marrow myeloid immature 
progenitors and their activity. MPIF-1, also known as CCL23 and MIP-3, can modulate 
the immune response by promoting and directing the migration of mature immune cells 
such as activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes to local sites of injury 
(Arruda-Silva et al., 2017; Hwang et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2010), while simultaneously 
reducing the number of cells in the hematopoietic progenitor pool and inducing production 
of granulocytes and monocytes (Patel et al., 1997). This may suggest a supportive role for 
MPIF-1 during development. In addition, the interaction of MPIF-1 with its chemokine 
receptor, CCR1, can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1β, 
TNFα, and MIP-1α (Hwang et al., 2005), although in the current study, the levels of 
these were not elevated in newborns later diagnosed with ASD or DD, but rather were 
lower or did not differ from children with TD. Interestingly, in the CNS, the CCL23-CCR1 
interaction can induce angiogenesis by promoting the migration of endothelial cells through 
upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases in the endothelium (Hwang et al., 2005; Son 
et al., 2006). Blood vessel formation is critical in development and neuroplasticity, and 
either hypo- or hyper-angiogenesis can disrupt proper blood flow to the brain, which could 
ultimately affect neurodevelopmental outcome.

Recently, Azmitia et al. reported persistent angiogenesis in postmortem cortex, brainstem, 
and cerebellum of children and young adults with ASD and proposed that the heightened 
neuronal activity noted in some individuals with ASD was an outcome of sustained splitting 
angiogenesis (Azmitia et al., 2016). Mulligan and Trauner found that more than half of the 
ASD patients in their study exhibited abnormal epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) 
activity (Mulligan and Trauner, 2014), which has been considered as a method of early ASD 
diagnosis (Bosl et al., 2018; Gurau et al., 2017). Increased neuronal connectivity is closely 
related to pruning and myelination of axons, and heightened EEG activity could mean 
initial overgrowth and early maturation of brain white matter in ASD, possibly resulting in 
altered behavior (O’Reilly et al., 2017). In fact, children with ASD exhibit overconnectivity 
rather than underconnectivity as is shown by elevation of fractional anisotropy at age of six 
months, followed by a reduction below that of age-matched controls at 24 months (Wolff et 
al., 2012). Our observation of positive associations between MPIF-1 and MSEL cognitive 
and VABS adaptive scores in children with ASD may potentially support the modulation in 
angiogenesis thereby affecting neuroplasticity and neurodevelopment. The contribution of 
MPIF-1 in angiogenesis and neuronal activity in the ASD participants in the current study is 
still unknown; however, the fact that all subgroups of ASD (ASDsev, ASDmild, ASDhi, and 
ASDlo) had significantly higher levels of MPIF-1 than DD demonstrates the importance of 
MPIF-1 homeostasis during brain development and the potential of MPIF-1 as a checkpoint 
for ASD versus DD. In addition, numerous ligands for CCR1 other than MPIF-1 (i.e., 
MIP-1α [CCL3], RANTES [CCL5], MCP-3 [CCL7], MCP-4 [CCL13], MIP-1δ [CCL15]) 
(Murphy et al., 2000) and the global expression of CCR1 (immune/neuronal cells, tissues)

(Patel et al., 1997; Simats et al., 2018; Stuart et al., 2015) should be taken into account when 
trying to better understand the mechanistic and functional role of MPIF-1 in ASD.

Conclusions

Our data collectively suggest that chemokine levels measured in children shortly after birth 
can serve as early predictors of abnormal immune and neuroimmune development associated 
with ASD and DD. Lower peripheral levels of select cytokines and chemokines in both 
ASD and DD groups compared to TD suggest the importance of homeostatic cytokine/
chemokine levels in normal neurodevelopment. The differences in neonatal chemokine 
and cytokine profiles provide support for addressing the mechanisms between the immune 
and neuronal systems during gestation. Questions regarding the function of CTACK and 
MPIF-1 in brain development and their potential role in neuroplasticity should be further 
investigated, perhaps using a rodent model to elaborate on the effect of these select 
chemokines on neurodevelopment. Furthermore, continued investigation of very early 
immune molecule predictors of ASD and DD risk as well as understanding their functional 
role in neurodevelopment will be necessary to elucidate mechanistic pathways of immune 
dysregulation in these neurodevelopmental disorders.

Highlights

•

•

•

Newborns later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and delayed 
development (DD) have lower levels of cytokines and chemokines at birth 
compared to those with typical development (TD).

Our exploratory analysis suggests that CTACK (CCL27) and MPIF-1 
(CCL23) are the strongest predictors of ASD compared to TD and DD, 
respectively.

Higher neonatal levels of CTACK were associated with a 60% decrease in the 
odds of ASD relative to TD while higher levels of MPIF-1 were associated 
with a 138% increase in the odds of ASD relative to DD.

Multinomial logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal education attainment, gestational age, child’s age at blood spot collection, 
and years from blood spot collection to elution; cytokines/chemokines were ln-transformed and normalized for total protein (pg/mg total protein); 
OR represents the fold change in the odds of having one diagnosis relative to another diagnosis or no diagnosis for every 1-unit increase in the 
ln-transformed cytokine/chemokine (or for every e-fold increase in cytokine/chemokine levels); 398 participants comprised the following groups: 
171 ASD, 69 DD and 158 TD; OR = adjusted odds ratio, CI = confidence interval, P = P-value

Multinomial logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal education attainment, gestational age, child’s age at blood spot collection, 
and years from blood spot collection to elution; cytokines/chemokines were ln-transformed and normalized for total protein (pg/mg total protein); 
OR represents the fold change in the odds of having one diagnosis relative to another diagnosis or no diagnosis for every 1-unit increase in the 
ln-transformed cytokine/chemokine (or for every e-fold increase in cytokine/chemokine levels); 398 participants comprised the following groups: 
27 ASD (high), 144 ASD (low) and 158 TD; Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) composite 
standard scores were used to define high/low cognitive and adaptive development levels, where both MSEL and VABS scores of ≥70 indicated 
typical to high-function and a score of <70 on either MSEL or VABS indicated low-function; OR = adjusted odds ratio, CI = confidence interval, P 
= P-value

Multinomial logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal education attainment, gestational age, child’s age at blood spot collection, 
and years from blood spot collection to elution; cytokines/chemokines were ln-transformed and normalized for total protein (pg/mg total protein); 
OR represents the fold change in the odds of having one diagnosis relative to another diagnosis or no diagnosis for every 1-unit increase in the 
ln-transformed cytokine/chemokine (or for every e-fold increase in cytokine/chemokine levels); 398 participants comprised the following groups: 
27 ASD (high), 144 ASD (low), and 69 DD; Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) composite 
standard scores were used to define high/low cognitive and adaptive development levels, where both MSEL and VABS scores of ≥70 indicated 
typical to high-function and a score of <70 on either MSEL or VABS indicated low-function; OR = adjusted odds ratio, CI = confidence interval, P 
= P-value

Linear regression models were adjusted for maternal education (≤High school, Some college vs. ≥Bachelor degree) and CTACK or MPIF-1 (both 
were included in one model); β-coefficient (estimate) represents the change in developmental quotient (DQ) for a 1-unit increase in ln-transformed 
chemokine (pg/mg total protein), with a higher DQ indicating a better developmental outcome; DQ is defined as the developmental age divided by 
chronological age and multiplied by 100, with Mean = 100 and Standard Deviation = 15; CI = confidence interval
