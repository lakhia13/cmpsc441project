Abstract: Treatment of depression is hampered by the failure to identify distinct symptom proﬁles
with distinct pathophysiologies that differentially respond to distinct treatments. We posit that
inﬂammatory depression is a meaningful depression subtype associated with speciﬁc symptoms and
biological abnormalities. We review several upstream, potentially causative, mechanisms driving
low-grade inﬂammation in this subtype of depression. We also discuss downstream mechanisms
mediating the link between inﬂammation and symptoms of depression, including alterations in
dopaminergic neurotransmission and tryptophan metabolism. Finally, we review evidence for several
non-pharmacological interventions for inﬂammatory depression, including probiotics, omega-3 fatty
acids, and physical exercise interventions. While some evidence suggests that these interventions
may be efﬁcacious in inﬂammatory depression, future clinical trials should consider enriching patient
populations for inﬂammatory markers, or stratify patients by inﬂammatory status, to conﬁrm or
refute this hypothesis.

Several lines of preclinical and clinical evidence connect systemic low-grade inﬂam-
mation to major depressive disorder (MDD). A large number of studies have now shown
that depressed patients have increased mean levels of blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
inﬂammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) [1–3]. Im-
portantly, elevated blood levels of hs-CRP are associated with relevant brain biomarkers
of MDD including decreased corticostriatal connectivity [4], increased basal ganglia glu-
tamate [5], and elevated CRP in CSF [6], conﬁrming the usefulness of peripheral blood
hs-CRP as an accessible and standardized biomarker for inﬂammatory depression. There
is also evidence for inﬂammation being a causal factor in a subgroup of depression and not
just an epiphenomenon, as illustrated by the potential of interferon-alpha (INF-α) treatment
to induce depression in susceptible individuals [7]. Despite solid scientiﬁc support for
the “inﬂammation hypothesis of depression”, at least in certain subgroups of patients,
several unresolved issues remain before this can lead to clinically meaningful outcomes.
Firstly, inﬂammation is certainly not speciﬁc for MDD, and not all MDD patients have
signs of inﬂammation. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that MDD is not an
inﬂammatory disorder per se, but instead there is evidence for a subset of MDD patients
with increased inﬂammation. This subtype of so-called inﬂammatory depression, which
has been poorly studied to date, has been associated with treatment resistance to selective

serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and with obesity, medical co-morbidities, and a
speciﬁc symptom proﬁle characterized by sleep and appetite disturbances, fatigue, and
lack of motivation [8,9]. Another important question that has not been fully addressed
is what causes the low-grade inﬂammation observed in this subgroup of MDD. This
knowledge is needed in order to identify preventive measures and treatment targets for
inﬂammatory depression.

Inflammatory depression might be meaningful to distinguish from other, non-inflammatory,
subtypes of depression in order to personalize antidepressant treatment. Here, we review
several upstream and downstream mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of in-
ﬂammatory depression, and potential interventions to treat this condition. Since previous
reviews have mostly covered either the anti-inﬂammatory effects of conventional antide-
pressants [10], or antidepressant efﬁcacy of various anti-inﬂammatory medications [11,12],
our focus will be on nutraceuticals and lifestyle interventions, and their potential role in
treating inﬂammatory depression.

2. Mechanisms of “Inﬂammatory Depression”

The causes of the chronic low-grade inﬂammation observed in some cases of MDD
are not fully understood, and are likely to vary from one individual to another. Candidate
mechanisms that have been explored in recent years include, but are not limited to, autoim-
mune disorders, infections, physical inactivity, poor diet, and genetic predisposition [8,13].
Cytokine signaling triggers a multitude of downstream biological effects on neuroen-
docrine, monoaminergic, and oxidative stress systems to name a few [8]. Alterations in
these systems may subsequently lead to “sickness behavior” (depressed mood, fatigue, loss
of appetite), which in some cases progresses to manifest clinical depression [13,14]. Such
depression-related behavioral changes could in turn reinforce negative health behaviors
including stress, physical inactivity, and poor dietary habits, establishing a vicious cycle
generating more inﬂammation and a progressive worsening of depressive symptoms, as
illustrated in Figure 1.

In the following sections, we describe several upstream, potentially causative, mecha-
nisms of inflammatory depression including alterations in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis)
and an imbalance in the omega-6/omega-3 ratio. We also describe selected downstream
mechanisms, potential mediators between inflammation and depressive symptoms, focusing
on inflammation effects on tryptophan and dopamine metabolism and neurotransmission.

2.1. Upstream Mechanisms; from Lifestyle to Inﬂammation
2.1.1. Dysbiosis

Dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, including a reduction in mi-
crobiota diversity and fewer beneﬁcial microbes, as often seen in somatic conditions such
as obesity and type 2 diabetes [15]. Several lifestyle factors including dietary habits [16],
exercise [17,18], and smoking habits may inﬂuence microbiota composition [19]. Dysbiosis
is central in the theory that alterations in the gut-brain axis may inﬂuence the onset and
maintenance of inﬂammatory depression [20]. One important mechanism in this regard is
that dysbiosis may promote increased intestinal permeability (referred to as “leaky-gut”
and illustrated in Figure 2), leading to bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier
into the circulation [21]. This, in turn, leads to a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent im-
mune response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS are usually found in the outer membrane
of Gram-negative bacteria, and when they pass from the gut lumen into the circulation,
they bind to LPS-binding protein (LBP), and this complex in turn binds to immune cells
triggering secretion of cytokines [21,22]. Elevated levels of LPS have been detected after
intake of high-energy meals [21]. Moreover, one study found that MDD subjects have
increased serum anti-LPS antibodies compared to controls [23], further supporting the
role of increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier,
resulting in systemic inﬂammation, in MDD pathophysiology.

From bottom left: Negative health behaviors such as poor dietary habits, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle could trigger
and/or enhance inﬂammatory responses. Below, we discuss two potential mechanisms mediating the effects of such
behaviors on inﬂammation; increased dietary n-6/n-3 ratio and dysbiosis. Subsequent pro-inﬂammatory signaling may
trigger oxidative stress and lead to alterations in dopamine release, reuptake and synthesis. This in turn may generate
symptoms of psychomotor retardation and motivational anhedonia, further reinforcing a state of sickness behavior, and
may induce, enhance, or maintain depression and more negative health behaviors. Abbreviations: omega-6 (n-6), omega-3
(n-3), arachidonic acid (AA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK).

There is also evidence that certain gut microbial products may counteract this LPS-
induced immune response. For instance, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are neuroactive
bacterial metabolites with the ability to translocate from the gut lumen to the systemic
circulation and subsequently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [21]. SCFAs are considered
to have anti-inﬂammatory properties during certain conditions, mitigating LPS-induced
immune responses [24]. Moreover, SCFAs may have beneﬁcial effects on the integrity of
the intestinal barrier as well as the BBB [21,25], suggesting that they have an important
intermediary role in how dysbiosis may alter neurobiological functions.

To the extent that changes in the gut microbiota may cause depressive symptoms in
certain patients, it is crucial to determine which factors mediate this relationship. Neuroin-
ﬂammation has been implicated in MDD pathophysiology [26], and is partially mediated
by microglia activation. Animal studies suggest that gut microbiota regulate microglial de-
velopment and function [27]. Erny et al. showed that germ-free mice display global defects
in microglia. They also reported that eradication of microbiota signiﬁcantly changes mi-
croglia properties including compromised maturation and cell shape [27]. Recolonization
with a more complex microbiota was able to restore microglia features in these mice [27].
Interestingly, SCFA administration was also able to restore some aspects of microglia im-
maturity and malformation [27]. Thion et al. recently corroborated the impact of the gut
microbiome on microglial function when they showed that maternal microbiome character-
istics inﬂuence microglial properties during prenatal stages in mice, and that microbiome
depletion has effects on microglial properties [28]. The exact mechanisms by which the gut
microbiome may inﬂuence microglia are not clear but may involve a dysbiosis-induced
leaky-gut, and subsequent translocation of microbiome and inﬂammatory response [21].

There is also animal data suggesting that the gut microbiota inﬂuence tryptophan and
kynurenine pathway metabolism [29,30]. For instance, certain gut bacteria, such as Lacto-
bacillus, secrete indoles [31]—tryptophan metabolites that have been shown to augment
gut barrier integrity and have anti-inﬂammatory properties [32], in part by counteracting
the effects of LPS [33]. Taken together, there is evidence, mainly from preclinical studies,
suggesting that the gut microbiota can affect various physiological and neurological pro-
cesses, relevant for depression pathophysiology, via both direct and indirect pathways.
Further research on human subjects is needed before this knowledge can be translated to a
clinical context.

Figure 2. Dysbiosis and increased gut permeability may lead to translocation of LPS from the gut
lumen into the circulation triggering low-grade inﬂammation. SCFAs also translocate into circulation
and may have several beneﬁcial effects including enhancing the integrity of the intestinal barrier and
the BBB. Circulating pro-inﬂammatory cytokines either signal to the brain via the vagal nerve or
cross the BBB and thereby contribute to neuroinﬂammation and microglia activation. Abbreviations:
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP),
blood-brain barrier (BBB).

2.1.2. Increased Dietary Omega-6/Omega-3 Ratio

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) have a multi-
tude of immune-modulating effects, both conjointly with [34] and separately [35,36] from
those related to dysbiosis. As exempliﬁed below, n-3 and n-6 effects are predominantly
described as anti- and pro-inﬂammatory, respectively [35]. In Western societies, dietary
intake of n-6 sharply exceeds that of n-3, which may promote a state of systemic low-grade
inﬂammation [37]. This is reﬂected in increased intake of, e.g., beef, chicken, and egg,
which are animal-based sources of preformed n-6, and a decreased intake of ﬁsh (source of
preformed n-3). There are also plant-derived sources of n-3 and n-6, which are considered
less efﬁcient as they only provide precursors requiring several intermediate metabolic steps
before n-3 and n-6 synthesis [38].

As reviewed by Calder [39], N-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa-
hexaenoic acid (DHA), have several important anti-inﬂammatory properties, including
(i) decreased chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes, (ii) decreased expression of ad-
hesion molecules on the surface of immune cells and in the circulation, (iii) decreased
production of prostaglandins, and (iv) inhibition of T-cell proliferation. EPA and DHA are
naturally embedded in phospholipid membranes and are both metabolized via enzymes
including cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX), generating anti-inﬂammatory
products such as the EPA-derived E-resolvins and DHA-derived D-resolvins (both via
COX-2) [38,39]. A detailed review of the anti-inﬂammatory effects of resolvins and asso-
ciated EPA/DHA-products are beyond the scope of this review, but have been described
elsewhere [40].

Enzymes COX and LOX are, in addition to being involved in the anti-inﬂammatory
metabolic pathways associated with EPA and DHA described above, also responsible
for breakdown of other PUFAs resulting in pro-inﬂammatory metabolites. For instance,
arachidonic acid (AA) is a n-6 PUFA exerting diverse immunomodulating effects, mainly
of pro-inﬂammatory nature [35]. When released from immune cell membranes, free AA is
a major substrate in the synthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins (PG), throm-
boxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins [38]. Eicosanoids are part of an intricate, not yet
fully understood system that inﬂuences the inﬂammatory response in disparate directions.
Eicosanoid immune modulation depends on various factors such as the timing of inter-
actions between speciﬁc eicosanoids and immune cells and what type of receptors those
immune cells express [35]. Hence, prostaglandins may exert pro-inﬂammatory effects
in one setting and anti-inﬂammatory effects in another, as reviewed by Tilley et al. [41].
Therefore, AA-degradation (commonly and hereafter referred to as the AA cascade) and
the function of formed eicosanoids is of importance for the duration and intensity of
immune responses [35]. Brieﬂy, the AA cascade is initiated through mobilization of AA
from membranes by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which is activated by cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) [42]. In subsequent steps of the cascade, free AA will
in part be converted, by, e.g., COX-1, -2, LOX, or cytochrome P450, to eicosanoids [43].
Interestingly, some of these enzymes are also involved in the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs
generating anti-inﬂammatory mediators. On the contrary, degradation of AA by COX and
LOX may render pro-inﬂammatory eicosanoids, hence n-3 and n-6 PUFAs may compete
for available enzymes resulting in either an anti-inﬂammatory or pro-inﬂammatory net
outcome [36], as illustrated in Figure 3. An example of the latter is production of the
prostaglandin PGE2, derived via COX, which enhances production of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in immune cells [35,38]. Moreover, the metabolization of AA
by COX or LOX may generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) further reinforcing the inﬂam-
matory response [44]. Taken together, the ratio of dietary n-6 to n-3 inﬂuence the balance
between pro- and anti-inﬂammatory effects and may thus mediate the effects between diet,
inﬂammation, and depressive symptoms. As described further below, these pathways have
therefore been suggested as potential treatment targets in inﬂammatory depression.

To our knowledge, a potential connection between the AA cascade, depression, and
inﬂammation has so far been sparsely explored. An exception is a study by Su et al. in-
vestigating the association between PLA2-gene polymorphisms and risk of IFN-α induced
depression among 132 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection undergoing treatment
with IFN-α [45]. Twenty-eight percent of the subjects developed IFN-α induced depres-
sion during a 24-week follow-up period. Subsequent analysis of PLA2 polymorphisms
identiﬁed a genotype associated with a signiﬁcantly elevated risk for developing depres-
sion. Intriguingly, subjects carrying the “risk” PLA2-genotype had signiﬁcantly lower
EPA levels in erythrocyte membranes compared to subjects with other genotypes. This
may indicate that this PLA2-genotype is associated with an increased risk for developing
inﬂammatory depression, and that this is mediated via n-3 levels, as detected in cell mem-
branes. While mechanistically interesting, this study lacked measurements of n-6 PUFAs
in membranes, which would have been of interest in relation to PLA2, and these results

need to be replicated in independent samples. There are also reports of elevated levels
of PLA2 in patients with various psychiatric illnesses [46], and a potential link between
the AA cascade, bipolar disorder, and the effects of mood-stabilizers has been repeatedly
investigated [43,47]. Interestingly, lithium treatment in mice leads to a suppression of AA
turnover, potentially through decreased expression of brain PLA2 [48]. In sum, the effects
of an increased n-6/n-3 ratio may be of relevance for the pathophysiology of inﬂammatory
depression. As reviewed in Section 3.1, several studies have investigated the antidepressant
effects of n-3 fatty acid supplements, with various degrees of success.

2.2. Downstream Mechanisms; from Inﬂammation to Symptoms
2.2.1. The Kynurenine Pathway of Tryptophan Metabolism

Upstream mechanisms (e.g., dysbiosis and increased n-6/n-3-ratio) generate a pro-
inﬂammatory state from where further signal transduction, particularly cytokine-mediated,
can affect various aspects of neural circuits central to behavior and mood [13,49]. For exam-
ple, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines can modify serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic
circuits via changes in the metabolism of tryptophan. As illustrated in Figure 4, trypto-
phan is the precursor of serotonin, yet it may also be metabolized along what is called
the kynurenine pathway (KP). Here we describe the KP and review some of the current
knowledge of its involvement in the pathophysiology of inﬂammatory depression [50].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 21   render pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, hence n-3 and n-6 PUFAs may compete for availa-ble enzymes resulting in either an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory net outcome [36], as illustrated in Figure 3. An example of the latter is production of the prostaglandin PGE2, derived via COX, which enhances production of pro-inflammatory cytokine inter-leukin-6 (IL-6) in immune cells [35,38]. Moreover, the metabolization of AA by COX or LOX may generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) further reinforcing the inflammatory response [44]. Taken together, the ratio of dietary n-6 to n-3 influence the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory effects and may thus mediate the effects between diet, inflam-mation, and depressive symptoms.

Figure 4. Metabolization of the essential amino acid tryptophan is shown in a simpliﬁed schematic
with focus on the metabolites discussed in this review. Marked in red is the activation of IDO by
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, triggering the formation of kynurenine from tryptophan. This is the
ﬁrst and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway. Abbreviations: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
(TDO), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), kynurenic Acid (Kyn-a).

The kynurenine pathway (KP) involves a series of enzymatic steps in the metabolism
of essential amino acid tryptophan and has been extensively studied in relation to both
inﬂammation and depression [51–53]. In particular, focus has been placed on how pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α) may activate the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO), which converts tryptophan to kynurenine in the ﬁrst and rate-limiting step of the
KP [54,55]. Metabolism along the KP occurs concurrently with serotonin synthesis. Thus,
increased IDO activity, e.g., during a pro-inﬂammatory state, may reduce the conversion
of tryptophan to serotonin [56], which in turn may be relevant for MDD pathophysiol-
ogy. The downstream metabolites generated in the KP differ depending on cell type. KP
activation in astrocytes generates kynurenic acid (kyn-a) whereas KP in microglia may
generate either 3-hydroxykunurenine (3-HK) and quinolinic acid (quin-a), or anthranilic
acid [55]. Quin-a is a neuroactive metabolite, with N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor
agonistic properties [51,57]. Interestingly, the novel antidepressant Ketamine exerts effect
on the glutamatergic NMDA-receptor, however antagonistically and in contrast to the
effects of quin-a. Quin-a has several neurotoxic properties including the ability to generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhance CNS-inﬂammation by increasing levels of
chemotactic molecules [55,58]. These effects of KP activation, mediated via the quin-a
generating “neurotoxic branch”, result in altered serotonin availability, alterations in glu-

tamatergic neurotransmission, neurotoxicity, and oxidative stress and may all contribute
to development of depressive symptoms [59]. Indeed, a clinical study on patients with
suicidal depression reported elevated CSF quin-a levels in cases versus controls and a
direct correlation between CSF IL-6 and CSF quin-a [59]. Consistent with a causative role
of KP activation in inﬂammatory depression, O’Connor et al. showed, in a mice model of
depression, that activation of IDO occurs in parallel to the development of depressive-like
behavior after peripheral LPS-injections [60]. Further supporting a causal link between KP
activation and depression, pre-LPS inhibition of IDO prevented depressive-like symptoms
in the same animal model [60]. Furthermore, Smith et al. showed that a polymorphism of
the IDO-encoding gene was associated with an increased risk of developing depressive
symptoms during treatment with IFN-α for hepatitis C [61]. Whereas KP activation in
microglia generates metabolites associated with the “neurotoxic branch”, KP activation in
astrocytes generates metabolites with potentially neuroprotective properties such as kyn-a,
see Figure 4. In opposite to quin-a, kyn-a is a NMDA-receptor antagonist and has also other
neuroactive and potentially neuroprotective effects, including an antagonistic interaction
with the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAchR) [55,62]. Antagonism on the
a7nAchR may attenuate both neuroinﬂammation and depressive-like behavior as shown in
mice by Alzarea and Rahman [63]. Currently, the diverse effects of metabolism along differ-
ent KP-branches and the relevance for clinical depression of their respective end products
are not fully understood. Clinical studies on depressed patients have rendered inconsistent
results, partly due to small sample sizes, and between-study differences with regards to
symptom severity, medication status, sampling medium (blood, CSF, or urine) [55,64],
and sometimes failure to take into account potential confounds such as diet and smoking
habits [55].

To the best of our knowldege, only one study so far has set out to identify subgroups of
depressed patients with an “immune-activated KP”, deﬁned by higher levels of TNF-α and
kynurenine/tryptophan-ratio (kyn/trp-r) as proxy markers for higher IDO-activity [65].
This study used factor analyses to identify a MDD subgroup with high TNF-α and kyn/trp-
r, and these patients were more severely depressed and anhedonic, and they were less likely
to respond to antidepressant treatment. Larger studies with similar innovative designs as
this one are needed in order to further validate these results, to investigate inﬂammatory
biomarkers in subgroups of depressed patients, and to relate biological signatures to clinical
characteristics and treatment outcomes.

2.2.2. Dopaminergic Neurotransmission

Altered dopaminergic metabolism and neurotransmission has been suggested as a key
mediator between systemic low-grade inﬂammation and certain depressive symptoms [66].
Of note, both dopaminergic and immune-related alterations map onto a certain clinical
subtype of depression characterized by symptoms such as anhedonia, amotivation, fatigue,
and psychomotor retardation [8,9,66]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the behavioral
sequelae of inﬂammation, including motivational anhedonia and alterations in reward-
seeking behavior (c.f. “sickness behavior”), are a direct consequence of the impact of
cytokines on mesolimbic dopamine signaling [66]. For instance, fMRI-studies of depressed
patients report a correlation between peripheral, low-grade inﬂammation (assessed by
hs-CRP) and anhedonia mediated via decreased resting-state functional connectivity in the
reward circuit [4]. Moreover, various types of immune challenges (to healthy volunteers,
patients with hepatitis or animals) triggers motivational anhedonia [67], a blunted response
to reward anticipation in the ventral striatum [68], and decreased striatal dopamine release
and availability [8,69].

The molecular mechanisms by which inﬂammation may lead to a hypodopaminer-
gic state are not fully understood. Suggested pathways involve inﬂammation-induced
alterations in availability and function of enzyme co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) [67].
BH4 is crucial in the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA which is the rate-limiting step in
dopamine synthesis [67]. Increased inﬂammation contributes to oxidation of BH4, leaving

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1640

decreased enzyme availability for dopamine synthesis, see Figure 5. In addition, BH4 is
required in the formation of the ROS nitric oxide (NO), by inducible nitric oxide synthase
(NOS). Expression of NOS is enhanced by inﬂammation, promoting BH4 utilization in
the synthesis of NO at the expense of dopamine synthesis. Conjointly, these alterations of
decreased dopamine synthesis and increased NO-production may reinforce inﬂammation-
oxidative stress interactions relevant for the pathophysiology of depression [70]. In line
with this, Kitagami et al. demonstrated that peripheral IFN-α injections decreased levels
of BH4 and dopamine in the amygdala and raphe of rodents [71]. Interestingly, in the
same study, BH4 levels were restored with the addition of a NOS-inhibitor, suggesting
a decreased dopamine synthesis due to increased BH4 consumption related to to NO
synthesis. Another study on patients undergoing treatment with IFN-α [72] showed that
lower CSF levels of BH4 correlated with higher CSF IL-6. Moreover, plasma phenylala-
nine/tyrosine ratio, as an indirect proxy measure of BH4 activity, correlated negatively
with CSF dopamine and positively with symptoms of fatigue. These results are in line
with a pro-inﬂammatory and hypodopaminergic state being associated with a depression
symptom proﬁle of fatigue, motivational anhedonia, and similar, associated symptoms.

The biological network that includes dopaminergic circuits, inflammation, and oxi-dative stress also involves further, multidirectional, mechanisms. For instance, the metab-olism of dopamine may render ROS as byproducts and thereby add to oxidative stress [73]. Oxidative stress may in turn enhance cytokine production through feedback mecha-nisms and by that, uphold an inflammatory state [74]. Moreover, the release of dopamine from presynaptic neurons is reduced during states of inflammation as pro-inflammatory cytokines decrease the expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) [67]. Under normal conditions, the action potential generates integration of dopamine-vesicles into the presynaptic membrane, which results in release of dopamine to synaptic cleft. VMAT2 enables vesicular storage of dopamine in synapses before releasing it into the synaptic cleft, thus less dopamine is released if VMAT2 expression is lower [73]. In addition to altering dopamine synthesis and release, immune-activation may also change expression and function of the dopamine transporter (DAT), e.g., through intra-cellular signaling pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [67]. MAPKs are activated by binding of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1B and TNF-α or LPS to their respective membrane receptors [75]. Further downstream actions of MAPKs are primarily Int. J. Mol.

The biological network that includes dopaminergic circuits, inﬂammation, and oxida-
tive stress also involves further, multidirectional, mechanisms. For instance, the metabolism
of dopamine may render ROS as byproducts and thereby add to oxidative stress [73]. Ox-
idative stress may in turn enhance cytokine production through feedback mechanisms and
by that, uphold an inﬂammatory state [74]. Moreover, the release of dopamine from presy-
naptic neurons is reduced during states of inﬂammation as pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
decrease the expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) [67]. Under
normal conditions, the action potential generates integration of dopamine-vesicles into
the presynaptic membrane, which results in release of dopamine to synaptic cleft. VMAT2
enables vesicular storage of dopamine in synapses before releasing it into the synaptic
cleft, thus less dopamine is released if VMAT2 expression is lower [73]. In addition to
altering dopamine synthesis and release, immune-activation may also change expression
and function of the dopamine transporter (DAT), e.g., through intra-cellular signaling
pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [67]. MAPKs are activated
by binding of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1B and TNF-α or LPS to their respective
membrane receptors [75]. Further downstream actions of MAPKs are primarily mediated
by activation of the transcription factor-family nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), resulting in pro-
inﬂammatory actions such as changes in leukocyte activity and cellular metabolism [75].
Immune-activated cascades of MAPK may increase both DAT reuptake and expression,
leading to decreased amounts of dopamine available in the synaptic cleft [67]. Such regula-
tion of DAT through MAPKs was demonstrated by Moron et al., as inhibition of MAPKs
decreased both transport capacity and cell surface expression of DAT, in synaptosomes of
rat striatum and human embryonic kidney cells respectively [76].

In summary, a balance in dopaminergic circuits is of crucial importance to regulate
several neurobehavioral functions such as hedonic response and psychomotor function. So
far, most studies have investigated how dopaminergic signaling within the mesolimbic
pathway mediates motivational anhedonia and related symptoms. Less focus has been paid
to peripheral, non-CNS, inputs to the dopaminergic reward circuitries that could potentially
inﬂuence dopaminergic neuron responsivity and thereby generate depressive symptoms.
Accumulating evidence suggests that systemic low-grade inﬂammation is an important
upstream mechanism linking a hypodopaminergic state to “anhedonic depression”, and
future studies testing interventions targeting either inﬂammation or dopaminergic mecha-
nisms should consider actively enrolling patients with this particular symptom proﬁle to
potentially advance precision psychiatry.

3. Therapeutic Implications
3.1. Omega-3 Fatty Acids as a Potential Treatment of Inﬂammatory Depression

Several clinical studies have shown that MDD patients, on a group level, have lower
blood levels of n-3 PUFAs [77], suggesting that n-3 PUFAs may be involved in MDD patho-
physiology and that supplementation of n-3 PUFAs may have an antidepressant effect in
certain patients. Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the antidepressant
efﬁcacy of n-3 PUFAs have, however, demonstrated only small-to-medium effects [78–80].
Although concrete clinical guidelines for the use of n-3 PUFAs in depression have been
proposed [81], these nutritional supplements have not yet had a clinical breakthrough.
In a recent meta-analysis [82], including a relatively homogenous group of patients with
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-veriﬁed MDD, a beneﬁcial
antidepressant effect of n-3 PUFAs was found (effect size = 0.4). However, the authors noted
that there was a large variation in the quality of the included studies and a potential risk of
publication bias [82]. Interestingly, they reported that several study design-related factors,
such as add-on design and higher dose of EPA in the intervention arm were associated
with a greater likelihood of a successful antidepressant response.

A possible explanation for the inconsistent effect sizes across studies is that not all pa-
tients with MDD, but only a subset, beneﬁt from n-3 treatment. Given the anti-inﬂammatory
properties of n-3 PUFAs described above, it is possible that only those MDD patients with

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1640

11 of 20

signs of low-grade inﬂammation may respond to this particular intervention. This would
be consistent with one animal study showing that n-3 PUFA treatment prevents LPS-
induced depressive-like behavior in mice, by suppressing neuroinﬂammation [83]. Further
supporting a role for n-3 PUFAs in inﬂammatory depression, another study found that pre-
treatment with n-3 PUFA has a protective effect on IFN-α induced depression [84]. In this
RCT, 162 patients with hepatitis C were randomized to two weeks of pre-treatment with
EPA, DHA, or placebo before starting IFN-α therapy. While both EPA and DHA delayed
the onset of IFN-α induced depression, only EPA signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence rate
compared to placebo (10% vs. 30%), suggesting that EPA, more so than DHA, might be efﬁ-
cacious in treating inﬂammatory depression. Consistent with a speciﬁc role for EPA in the
treatment of inﬂammatory depression, a recent RCT showed that EPA, but not DHA, had a
large antidepressant effect in depressed subjects with signs of low-grade inﬂammation [85].
Interestingly, such beneﬁcial effect was not seen in those MDD patients with low levels of
blood inﬂammatory markers. Moreover, this study provided evidence of a dose-response
effect with greater separation between EPA and placebo in subgroups of patients with
more than one elevated inﬂammatory marker. For instance, patients with 4–5 elevated
inﬂammation biomarkers, had remission rates (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 score
≤ 7) of 40% for EPA and 25% for placebo, while patients without any elevated inﬂammatory
marker had remission rates of 19% for EPA and 44% for placebo. These ﬁndings strengthen
the hypothesis that, while n-3 PUFAs may not be a robust antidepressant treatment overall,
it might be clinically useful in the subgroup of inﬂammatory depression. To conﬁrm or
refute these novel, and potentially clinically meaningful, ﬁndings, future well-designed
clinical trials should either enrich patient populations for inﬂammatory markers or use
“match/mismatch designs” with subjects stratiﬁed by inﬂammatory markers at baseline
and then randomized to receive an anti-inﬂammatory intervention or not [8,86].

3.2. Dysbiosis, Inﬂammation, and Depression—Are Probiotics Efﬁcacious in
Inﬂammatory Depression?

Accumulating preclinical data suggest that dysbiosis and increased gut permeability
are associated with depressive-like behavior in animals [21,29], including some evidence for
a causal mechanism. Kelly et al. [30] showed that germ-free mice receiving a fecal transplant
from depressed patients but not from non-depressed controls, develop depressive-like
behavior [30]. Rats receiving a fecal transplant from a depressed human donor also
showed a trend towards higher plasma CRP than those receiving fecal transplants from
controls, suggesting low-grade inﬂammatory responses to “depressed” human microbiota
compared to “healthy” human microbiota [30]. Furthermore, several animal models of
stress reported reductions in richness and diversity of the gut microbiota and increased
immune activation [87,88].

In addition to animal studies showing a link between dysbiosis, inﬂammation, and
depressive symptoms, there are also several lines of clinical evidence supporting this.
Reduced microbiota diversity is considered an indicator of dysbiosis and has been associ-
ated with obesity as well as cardiometabolic and autoimmune disorders [89]. The speciﬁc
mechanisms linking dysbiosis to certain psychiatric and somatic disorders are not fully un-
derstood but may involve an induction of chronic low-grade inﬂammation [90], as further
described below and illustrated in Figure 2 above. The normal human gastrointestinal tract
has an abundance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, representing approx-
imately 90% of the bacteria present [91]. A preliminary study of MDD subjects reported
reduced numbers of Firmicutes in MDD compared to controls [92]. Another study reported
that Lactobacillus, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes, was
reduced in MDD relative to healthy controls [93]. Though interesting, these studies had
several limitations including lack of dietary habit data and did not account for potential
confounders including concurrent medications. A recent large-scale population-based
study found reductions in genus Dialister and Coprococcus in individuals with suspected
depression, and antidepressant medication moderated these effects [94]. This study also

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1640

12 of 20

reported signiﬁcant differences in Lactobacillus in individuals with suspected depression,
namely an increase in these bacteria.

Already in 2005, Logan and Katzman [95] suggested that probiotics may potentially
be used as novel adjuvant therapies for MDD, based on limited evidence from various
conditions frequently comorbid with depression (e.g., irritable bowel disease, chronic
fatigue syndrome, ﬁbromyalgia). The antidepressant effects of probiotics have subsequently
been tested in a number of studies, but results have been inconsistent which might depend
on sample heterogeneity across studies, various rating scales and bacterial strains being
used, and the fact that most studies have included healthy individuals rather than clinically
depressed patients [96]. To the extent probiotics have a meaningful effect on mood, this
seems to be larger in those with at least moderate severity of depressive symptoms at
baseline, and smaller in healthy, non-depressed, individuals. Based on preclinical evidence
of an anti-inﬂammatory effect and the ability to reduce intestinal permeability and protect
against a “leaky gut” [97–99], Lactobacillus species have been widely used as probiotics.
One study reported that the quantity of Lactobacilli is reduced in patients with MDD
compared to healthy controls [93]. In mice, lower amounts of Lactobacilli have been
associated with increased oxidative stress [100], another frequent ﬁnding in MDD [2].
Animal studies testing Lactobacillus probiotics reported positive effects on depressive
and anxious behaviors [101,102]. Moreover, one recent RCT on bipolar patients showed
that add-on Lactobacillus probiotics after hospital discharge was associated with lower
rehospitalization rates compared to placebo [103]. Interestingly, this study also found that
the putative preventive effect was greater in those with elevated levels of inﬂammation
pre-treatment, again suggesting that there may be a subgroup of mood disorder patients
with inﬂammation that would beneﬁt more from this type of intervention [103]. A recent
small-scale pilot RCT tested the efﬁcacy of Lactobacillus Reuteri (L. Reuteri) versus placebo in
war veterans with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms [104]. Although this study was
not powered to detect treatment-related changes in clinical PTSD symptoms, assignment
to the L. Reuteri arm was associated with a decrease in plasma CRP levels that approached
statistical signiﬁcance, suggesting that CRP may be a useful biomarker to monitor treatment
effect in future studies.

In the ﬁrst probiotics RCT that included patients with DSM-IV diagnosed depression
of at least moderate severity, Akkasheh et al. [105] randomized 40 unmedicated MDD
patients to receive either a combined probiotic supplement containing each of the following
strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Biﬁdobacterium biﬁdum, or placebo.
After eight weeks of treatment, depressive symptoms had signiﬁcantly decreased in the
treatment compared to the placebo group. Additionally, in the intervention group, there
was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in hs-CRP and insulin levels. Thus, this study
suggests that some of the antidepressant effects of probiotics may be mediated via anti-
inﬂammatory mechanisms and beneﬁcial effects on metabolic markers. Since three different
strains of bacteria were used in combination it is, however, not possible to ascertain whether
one of these strains conveyed the beneﬁcial effects, and if so which one. While this study
had several strengths, it also came with several notable caveats; for instance, the authors
recognized the need for larger sample sizes in future studies, longer follow-up time, and a
possibility to analyze more biomarkers of inﬂammation and oxidative stress. In another
randomized placebo-controlled trial including 40 unmedicated patients with irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) and comorbid MDD, 90 days of treatment with Bacillus coagulans (MTCC
5856) resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of both depressive and IBS symptoms compared to
placebo [106]. This study also found a signiﬁcant reduction in serum myeloperoxidase, a
marker of oxidative stress and inﬂammation [107,108] over the course of treatment, and
this change was not seen in the placebo group. These ﬁndings are mainly in line with
another RCT on IBS and comorbid MDD, reporting a decrease in depressive symptoms,
as well as improvement in quality of life, in patients treated with Biﬁdobacterium longum
compared to placebo [109]. No effects on anxiety or IBS symptoms were, however, observed
in this study, suggesting that any effect is restricted to depressive symptoms and quality

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1640

13 of 20

of life. Interestingly, patients assigned to probiotics had reduced limbic activity (reduced
response to fearful stimuli), per fMRI analyses, further strengthening the hypothesis that
the gut-brain axis may be a viable target in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In
this study, there were no signiﬁcant between-group differences in inﬂammatory markers
or microbiota proﬁles. Another RCT [110] found that 8 weeks of add-on treatment with
probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus and Biﬁdobacterium longum) resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease of depressive symptoms compared to both placebo and prebiotics. Moreover,
those who were randomized to the probiotics group showed signiﬁcantly decreased serum
kynurenine/tryptophan ratio compared to the placebo group at the end of the study, when
adjusted for serum isoleucine. The rationale for controlling for isoleucine was that branched-
chain amino acids like isoleucine and tryptophan compete for the same transporter from
blood to brain. The authors suggested that a decrease in the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio
might indicate an effect of probiotics on the metabolism of tryptophan, potentially by
reducing the activity of enzymes responsible for conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine
and that this might partly explain the observed effect on depressive symptoms.

Based on the literature review above, it seems that future probiotics studies should
include patients with clinical, DSM-veriﬁed MDD. Moreover, future studies should inves-
tigate mechanisms mediating any antidepressant effect of probiotics, including the use
of brain imaging as well as relevant blood and feces biomarkers. Finally, the heterogene-
ity of symptoms and mechanisms in MDD has hampered the development of targeted
treatments. One way to overcome this is to use “enriched population study design”. This
strategy decreases heterogeneity and can reduce costs, improve risk-beneﬁt relationships,
and has been advocated as a means to advance “personalized psychiatry”, particularly
in the context of inﬂammatory depression [8]. Based on the biological mechanisms of
probiotics described above, future studies should consider enriching patients based on
inﬂammatory markers in order to identify individuals who are more likely to respond to
this particular intervention.

3.3. Is Exercise Efﬁcacious in Inﬂammatory Depression?

As an alternative to more conventional antidepressants, exercise has gained increasing
attention as a potential preventive measure, or even a treatment option, for some cases of
MDD. Several meta-analyses have provided evidence that physical activity has an antide-
pressant effect [111–113], and it is now recommended in the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for mild to moderate depression [114]. Some critical
reviews of the literature have, however, noted that many of the exercise treatment trials
have a high risk of bias, and when these are eliminated from the analyses, the antidepres-
sant effect is reduced [115]. Again, this view may be consistent with the heterogeneous
nature of depression, and that a certain intervention may not beneﬁt all depressed pa-
tients, but only a subset. Interestingly, recent preclinical and clinical research suggests
that the antidepressant effect of physical activity may be mediated via anti-inﬂammatory
mechanisms [116]. For instance, in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm,
exercise alleviated depressive-like behavior in mice, and also downregulated peripheral
and central inﬂammatory markers associated with CUMS [117]. Interestingly, exercise also
improved intestinal function and increased central dopamine expression in these animals,
suggesting that exercise may, in addition to having an anti-inﬂammatory effect, also ex-
ert its antidepressant effects via mechanisms involving gut permeability and dopamine
metabolism. As described below, preliminary clinical data also suggest that exercise, to the
extent that it has an antidepressant effect, is more efﬁcacious in depressed patients with
signs of low-grade inﬂammation.

Rethorst et al. (2013) investigated the association between proinﬂammatory cytokines
(IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and antidepressant response to exercise in MDD patients
who were all partial SSRI responders [118]. A total of 126 MDD patients were randomized to
receive either low or high dose of exercise (4 or 12 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight
per week respectively) for 12 weeks, and raters of depressive symptoms were blinded to

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1640

14 of 20

group assignment. They found that high levels of TNF-α at baseline predicted a greater
decrease in depressive symptoms after 12 weeks of physical activity, suggesting a larger
antidepressant effect in MDD patients with elevated inﬂammation at baseline. There was
also a positive correlation between a decrease in IL-1β levels over the course of treatment
and a decrease in depressive symptoms. The association between change in IL-1β levels
and depressive symptoms remained signiﬁcant in the high-dose but not in the low-dose
exercise group, suggesting a dose-response relationship. However, physical activity did not
signiﬁcantly decrease any of cytokines over the course of the study, regardless of exercise
dose. In another study by Lavebratt et al. (2017), patients with mild to moderate depression
were randomized to light, moderate, or vigorous exercise (three 60-min classes a week) [119].
They found that higher baseline levels of IL-6 were related to greater improvement in
depressive symptoms after 12 weeks of physical activity. Again, this strengthens the
hypothesis of a more favorable effect of exercise in “inﬂammatory depression” compared to
non-inﬂammatory depression. This study also found that IL-6 levels decreased signiﬁcantly
from baseline to post-treatment when all participants were analyzed together regardless of
exercise intensity, and there was also a positive correlation between change in depression
symptoms and change in IL-6 level over the course of treatment. However, no signiﬁcant
effect of different exercise intensities on change in IL-6 levels could be found, possible due
to limited sample sizes.

The mechanisms underlying an antidepressant effect of exercise remains understudied.
However, physical activity has been associated with various positive immune-modulating
properties like leukocyte redistribution and trafﬁcking, maturation, and functions of differ-
ent immune cells [120]. The putative anti-inﬂammatory properties of exercise can partially
be explained by reduced visceral adiposity, as adipose tissue is an important source of
systemic inﬂammation [121]. Some studies have suggested that physical activity increases
gene expression of PGC-1-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor C coactivator-1-
α) [122], a transcription coactivator that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular
energy metabolism [123]. PGC-1-α is a coactivator of transcription factors with neuropro-
tective properties and controls gene expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in muscles,
partly by inhibition of the NF-KB pathway [116,124] (11,8). Recent research has also sug-
gested that PGC-1-α facilitates the transformation of peripheral kynurenine to kyn-a [122].
Unlike kynurenine, kyn-a does not pass the BBB and consequently prevents the poten-
tially neuroinﬂammatory effects of central tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine
pathway [122].

To summarize, preliminary evidence suggests that exercise may play a role in the
treatment of inﬂammatory depression, although future large-scale and well-designed
clinical trials are needed. Selected key studies on treatment of inﬂammatory depression
reviewed in this paper are summarized in Table 1.

4. Conclusions

We here posit that inﬂammatory depression is a speciﬁc subtype that responds to
speciﬁc mechanism-based treatments. We have reviewed several upstream, potentially
causal, mechanisms driving low-grade inﬂammation in this subtype of depression. We
have also discussed downstream mechanisms mediating the link between inﬂammation
and symptoms of depression, including alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission and
tryptophan metabolism. There is preliminary evidence that inﬂammatory depression can
be addressed by speciﬁc treatment choices targeting some of these pathways, including the
gut microbiota and omega-3 fatty acids. In future studies, it will be important to determine
how the effect of such non-pharmacological interventions compare to potentially more
potent pharmacological interventions. For instance, both anti-inﬂammatory drugs [11]
and certain conventional antidepressants [126,127] may be efﬁcacious in inﬂammatory
depression. Furthermore, forthcoming studies might consider stratifying subjects based on
severity or duration of illness, since such factors may contribute to inﬂammatory depres-
sion [128]. Finally, future clinical trials should enrich patient populations for inﬂammatory
markers or use “match/mismatch designs” in order to deﬁnitely test the hypothesis that
inﬂammatory depression is a clinically meaningful construct with the potential to advance
precision psychiatry.
