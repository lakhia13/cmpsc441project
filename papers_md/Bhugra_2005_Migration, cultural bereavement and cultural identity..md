Migration has contributed to the richness in diversity of cultures, ethnicities and races in developed countries. Individuals who migrate
experience multiple stresses that can impact their mental well being, including the loss of cultural norms, religious customs, and social
support systems, adjustment to a new culture and changes in identity and concept of self. Indeed, the rates of mental illness are increased
in some migrant groups. Mental health practitioners need to be attuned to the unique stresses and cultural aspects that affect immigrants
and refugees in order to best address the needs of this increasing and vulnerable population. This paper will review the concepts of migra-
tion, cultural bereavement and cultural identity, and explore the interrelationship between these three aspects of the migrant’s experience
and cultural congruity. The complex interplay of the migration process, cultural bereavement, cultural identity, and cultural congruity,
along with biological, psychological and social factors, is hypothesized as playing a major role in the increased rates of mental illness in
affected migrant groups.  

Key words: Migration, cultural bereavement, cultural identity, cultural congruity, ethnic density

Mental  health  practitioners  work  in  an  increasingly
multicultural world, shaped by the migrations of people of
many  different  cultural,  racial  and  ethnic  backgrounds.
People migrate for many reasons, including broadly politi-
cal, socioeconomic and educational. The richness of this
diversity of cultures, ethnicity, races and reasons for migra-
tion can make understanding experiences and diagnosis of
illness challenging in people whose background and expe-
rience differ significantly from the clinician. Culture has an
important role in the presentation of illness, and cultural
differences  impact  upon  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of
migrant populations in part due to linguistic, religious and
social  variation  from  the  clinician  providing  care.  Addi-
tionally,  it  appears  that  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of
psychiatric disorders varies among people of different cul-
tural  backgrounds  due  to  an  interplay  of  biological,  psy-
chological and social factors. 

The provision of healthcare is necessarily influenced by
the  demands  of  people  of  many  different  cultures,  but
relies  on  economic,  social  and  political  factors,  and  it  is
important  that  cultural  differences  be  appreciated  and
understood  to  arrive  at  a  correct  diagnostic  impression
and  treatment  plan.  The  migration  process  itself  can  be
stressful, depending upon the type and cause of migration,
and can affect the mental health of migrating individuals
and  their  families.  Issues  of  cultural  bereavement  and
identity  occur  with  increased  frequency  among  migrants
and  their  families.  This  paper  will  review  these  concepts
and how they impinge upon mental health and psychiatric
care  and,  by  so  doing,  help  the  clinician  to  identify  and
address these issues in a culturally sensitive way.

MIGRATION

Migration can be defined as the process of going from
one country, region or place of residence to settle in anoth-
er. The duration of this new settlement varies, but for the

purposes of this paper the focus is on individuals who relo-
cate  either  semi-permanently  or  permanently  to  another
country. Also, urban-rural migration within the same coun-
try  is  not  being  discussed  here.  Migrants  may  move  en
masse or singly.  For example, people who migrate for eco-
nomic or educational reasons may move singly and at a lat-
ter  date  be  joined  by  their  families,  whereas  people  who
move due to political reasons may move en masse but with
or without their families (1). Although not all people who
migrate are from ethnic minority groups, it is of note that
a  significant  proportion  is.  The  multicultural  nature  of
British society is supported by the 1991 census. Ethnic cat-
egories  were  first  used  in  the  UK  in  the  1991  census,  at
which time over three million people, or approximately
5.5% of the general population, were from ethnic minori-
ty (non-white) groups (2). Of these, 30% described them-
selves as black, black African or other and 28% described
themselves  as  Indian;  however,  by  the  2001  census  the
categories  of  ethnic  ascription  had  increased  and  the
proportion  of  ethnic  minorities  had  increased  to  7.9%.
The  minority  ethnic  population  in  the  UK  grew  by  53%
between 1991 and 2001, from 3 million people to 4.6 mil-
lion people respectively. Indians were the largest minority
group,  followed  by  Pakistanis,  people  of  mixed  ethnic
backgrounds,  black  Caribbeans,  black  Africans  and
Bangladeshis (3).

The  history  of  migration  to  Britain  highlights  some  of
the reasons why people migrate. Significant migration to
Britain started in the nineteenth century. Irish immigration
has  been  marked  by  periods  of  influx  and  efflux  to  and
from Britain, as people have come to either settle perma-
nently or work temporarily with ultimate return to Ireland
as a goal. Eastern European Jews came at the latter part of
the  nineteenth  century  to  escape  both  religious  persecu-
tion  and  poverty,  with  additional  numbers  arriving  in
Britain both before and after World War II. In the 1960s,
employers,  especially  in  urban  areas,  recruited  people

18

from the West Indies to fill low paying jobs which were less
attractive to the local population. People from the Indian
subcontinent migrated to Britain for educational and eco-
nomic reasons, the peak of which occurred about the same
time as the West Indian migration. Asian people expelled
by  Idi  Amin’s  government  came  from  Uganda  in  the  late
1970s.  The  1980s  saw  a  change  in  the  immigration  laws
limiting  the  numbers  of  people  allowed  to  relocate  to
Britain (4). Today, people from around the globe choose to
migrate  to  the  UK  as  well  as  other  developed  countries,
both  legally  and  illegally,  for  better  educational  and
employment opportunities, to escape persecution, to relo-
cate  after  catastrophic  events,  including  terrorism,  disas-
ters and war, and/or to join relatives who migrated at an
earlier time.

Migration can be classified in a number of ways; e.g., by
the reasons for the migration, the social class and educa-
tion  of  the  migrating  people,  the  duration  of  relocation
and  the  geographic  distribution  of  the  resettlement.  Fur-
ther,  a  distinction  can  be  made  in  the  classification  of
migrants  according  to  whether  their  contact  with  the
‘majority’  or  ‘dominant’  culture  is  deemed  voluntary.
Migrants  can  be  classified  as  immigrants  and  sojourners
when the change in their location results in contact volun-
tarily, whereas refugees are deemed to change their loca-
tion involuntarily (5).  For example, immigrants choose to
migrate, and thus be in increased and regular contact with
the  ‘majority’  culture  in  preparation  for  migration,  for
potential  economic  and/or  educational  advancement,
whereas refugees are forced to migrate, and thus be in con-
tact with the ‘majority’ population involuntarily, to escape
persecution. Additionally, rural-urban migration has been
associated  with  economic  and  educational  reasons  for
relocation,  whereas  migration  across  nations  has  been
associated with economic, educational, social and politi-
cal reasons (6). 

The process of migration has been described as occur-
ring  in  broadly  three  stages.  The  first  stage  is  pre-migra-
tion, involving the decision and preparation to move. The
second stage, migration, is the physical relocation of indi-
viduals  from  one  place  to  another.  The  third  stage,  post-
migration, is defined as the “absorption of the immigrant
within the social and cultural framework of the new socie-
ty”. Social and cultural rules and new roles may be learnt
at  this  stage  (4).  The  initial  stage  of  migration  may  have
comparatively  lower  rates  of  mental  illness  and  health
problems than the latter stages, due to the younger age at
the initial stage of migration and the problems with accul-
turation and the potential discrepancy between attainment
of goals and actual achievement in the latter stages (7). It
is worth noting that the stages are often not discrete and
merge into one another.

It has been hypothesized that social adjustment and the
prevalence of mental illness in migrants may be influenced
by the duration of the relocation, the similarity or dissimi-
larity between the culture of origin and the culture of set-

tlement, language and social support systems, acceptance
by  the  ‘majority’  culture,  access  and  acceptance  by  the
expatriate community, employment, and housing (4). If the
individual feels isolated from his or her culture, unaccept-
ed by the ‘majority culture’ and has a lack of social support,
a consequent sense of rejection, alienation and poor self-
esteem  may  occur.  During  the  stages  of  migration,  there
may be factors that predispose individuals to mental disor-
ders.  Pre-migration  factors  include  the  personality  struc-
ture  of  an  individual,  forced  migration,  and  persecution,
among others. Migration factors include bereavement, cul-
ture  shock,  a  discrepancy  between  expectations  and
achievement, and acceptance by the new nation are poten-
tial  post-migration  factors  (8,9).  These  factors  can  be
thought  of  as  vulnerability  factors  along  with  biological,
social and psychological variables. For example, personal-
ity structure can be thought of as a biological factor as well
as  in  cultural  terms.  Personality  is  influenced  by  cultural
factors and influences patterns of child rearing, responding
to stress and accepting social support. National character
and personality factors are interlinked.

Bhugra  (6)  reviewed  four  hypotheses  explaining  the
relationship between migration and mental illness, specif-
ically  the  higher  rates  of  schizophrenia  among  some
migrant groups in the UK, and proposed a fifth hypothesis.
His hypothesis argues for an ethnic density effect on the
rates  of  mental  illness  in  migrant  groups.  Additionally,
individuals  who  migrate  from  collectivistic  or  socio-cen-
tric societies, who themselves are socio-centric, into indi-
vidualist or egocentric societies may experience feelings of
alienation and mental distress, with consequent difficulty
in settling into the new society. Social change, assimilation
and cultural identity may be significant factors in the rela-
tionship between migration and mental illness (6,7).

CULTURAL BEREAVEMENT

The loss of one’s social structure and culture can cause
a  grief  reaction,  as  has  been  described  by  Eisenbruch
(10,11). Migration involves the loss of the familiar, includ-
ing language (especially colloquial and dialect), attitudes,
values,  social  structures  and  support  networks.  Grieving
for this loss can be viewed as a healthy reaction and a nat-
ural consequence of migration; however, if the symptoms
cause significant distress or impairment and last for a spec-
ified period of time, psychiatric intervention may be war-
ranted. Eisenbruch (11) has defined cultural bereavement
as “the experience of the uprooted person – or group –
resulting from loss of social structures, cultural values and
self-identity: the person – or group – continues to live in
the  past,  is  visited  by  supernatural  forces  from  the  past
while asleep or awake, suffers feelings of guilt over aban-
doning  culture  and  homeland,  feels  pain  if  memories  of
the past begin to fade, but finds constant images of the past
(including  traumatic  images)  intruding  into  daily  life,
yearns  to  complete  obligations  to  the  dead,  and  feels

19

stricken by anxieties, morbid thoughts, and anger that mar
the ability to get on with daily life”. 

The  expression  of  such  bereavement  is  influenced  by
many  factors,  among  which  are  social,  cultural  and  eco-
nomic.  In  a  study  of  the  palliative  care  experience  of
Bangladeshi  patients  and  their  carers  in  east  London,
recent  migration,  linguistic  barriers,  religious  beliefs  and
financial issues impacted the ability to optimise pain con-
trol  in  patients  and  the  grieving  process  of  family  mem-
bers; burial of the deceased in Bangladesh and social sup-
port from family and friends were potentially helpful in the
grieving  process  (12).  The  importance  of  culture  in  the
expression  of  grief  was  highlighted  by  a  case  report  of
bereavement  in  an  Ethiopian  female  refugee.  Her  symp-
toms of grief were complicated by her inability to perform
her  culturally  sanctioned  purification  rituals  because  of
her relocation. Compounding her problem, she was erro-
neously diagnosed at various times due to the use of West-
ern derived diagnostic criteria and a lack of appreciation
of  the  cultural  differences  in  the  presentation  of  grief  by
clinicians  (13).  The  symptoms  of  cultural  bereavement
may be misdiagnosed due to problems with language, cul-
ture  and  the  use  of  Western  diagnostic  criteria  in  non-
Western  peoples.  Schreiber  (13)  noted  that  traditional
healing and purification rituals as well as supportive psy-
chotherapy,  after  the  correct  diagnosis  was  made,  were
essential in the treatment of this patient’s syndrome.

Western constructs of bereavement may prove to be of
only  partial  or  limited  value  in  explaining  expressions  of
grief when applied to people from other cultures; however,
this is an area worth further study.  All human beings get
bereaved,  but  the  cultural  norms  are  essential  in  dealing
with bereavement.  Western views of bereavement include
the progression through stages of grief, psychoanalytic the-
ories of loss, and behavioural theories.  Davies and Bhugra
(14) refer to Bowlby’s contribution to the understanding of
loss and the function and course of grief.  In application of
his  attachment  theory,  Bowlby  described  four  phases  of
mourning, including numbing, yearning and anger, disor-
ganization and despair, and reorganization. Psychoanalyt-
ic theorists have described the role of the unconscious and
ambivalence in grief; abnormal grief reactions are felt to be
unconsciously  driven  and  involve  ambivalent  feelings  to
the lost object with resultant depressive symptoms includ-
ing significant decline in self-esteem (15,16).  

The DSM-IV notes that the “duration and expression of
‘normal’  bereavement  vary  considerably  among  different
cultural groups”. A major depressive episode is diagnosed,
instead  of  bereavement,  if  symptoms  of  depression  are
present two or more months after the loss or the following
symptoms  are  present:  a)  guilt  about  things  other  than
actions taken or not taken by the survivor at the time of
the  death;  b)  thoughts  of  death  other  than  the  survivor
feeling that he or she would be better off dead or should
have died with the deceased person; c) morbid preoccupa-
tion with worthlessness; d) marked psychomotor retarda-

tion; e) prolonged and marked functional impairment; and
f) hallucinatory experiences other than thinking that he or
she hears the voice of, or transiently sees the image of, the
deceased person. These symptoms are based on a Western
construct for the diagnosis of abnormal grief and as such do
not take into account different cultural expressions of grief.
In  many  cultures,  it  is  normal  to  be  visited  by  spirits  and
ghosts,  and  people  of  non-Western  culture  may  describe
conversations with supernatural spirits. The importance of
placing these expressions of grief in the appropriate cultural
context is essential in differentiating between abnormal and
normal  reactions  to  loss.  Inappropriate  diagnoses  of  psy-
chotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
mood disorders have been made in people of non-Western
backgrounds when clinicians ignore cultural differences in
the  expression  of  grief.  The  misdiagnosis  and  subsequent
inappropriate treatment will at best not address the issue for
the affected person and, at worst, cause harm.  

Eisenbruch (10), in his work with Southeast Asian
refugees,  devised  a  cultural  bereavement  interview  as  a
means to help with the validity of the diagnostic interview,
clarify  the  “structure”  of  the  grief  reaction,  and  start  the
process of healing for the affected individuals. The inter-
view  takes  into  account  the  language  and  cultural  con-
structs  of  the  bereaved  individual.  During  the  interview,
the clinician explores the following: a) memories of family,
based on the construct of thoughts and perceptions of the
past;  b)  continuing  experience  of  family  and  the  past,
including  ghosts  and  spirits,  based  on  the  construct  of
communication  with  the  past;  c)  dreams,  guilt,  clarity  of
recall of the past and structuring of the past in the home-
land,  based  on  the  construct  of  survivor  guilt;  d)  experi-
ences of death, based on the construct of the violence of
separation or death and the absence of leave-taking; and
e)  response  to  separation  from  homeland,  based  on  the
construct  of  anger  and  ambivalence  (10).  The  cultural
bereavement  interview  incorporates  exploration  of  reli-
gious belief and practice, stressing the importance of ‘tra-
ditional’ treatments in the bereaved immigrant population.
As  noted  above  and  continuing  Schreiber’s  (13)  notion,
the collaboration of the Western psychiatrist with a tradi-
tional healer can represent for affected individuals the best
treatment approach, which is one that embraces and inte-
grates the non-Western belief system when using Western
psychiatric approaches.

Bereavement  has  been  associated  with  psychotic,
anxiety  and  mood  disorders;  however,  this  association
is  complicated  due  to  the  misinterpretation  of  the  cul-
tural expressions of grief by Western trained clinicians and
the  Western  diagnostic  criteria  of  psychiatric  disorders
that may not be applicable in people of different cultural
backgrounds.  Undoubtedly,  people  who  have  migrated
due  to  political  upheaval  or  war  may  have  witnessed  or
participated in combat and torture; thus, affected individ-
uals may have PTSD and bereavement, as these diagnoses
are  not  mutually  exclusive.  Culturally  appropriate  mani-

festations  and  expressions  of  bereavement  may  include
Western  constructs  of  PTSD  and  psychosis,  including
hearing  voices,  seeing  ghosts  and  feeling  the  presence  of
the dead; therefore, it is important to recognize the symp-
toms of bereavement within the cultural constructs of the
affected individual and be open to the possibility of addi-
tional  psychiatric  disorders.  Cultural  bereavement  is  an
important  aspect  in  the  understanding  of  the  migrant’s
experience. Our hypothesis is that such an experience will
be  mediated  through  and  influenced  by  cultural  identity.
The concepts of individual identity are likely to affect the
understanding  as  well  as  working  through  the  bereave-
ment process.

CULTURAL IDENTITY

It is important to define basic sociologic terms of identi-
ty  to  understand  cultural  identity.  Culture  is  learned  and
passed  through  generations  and  includes  the  beliefs  and
value  system  of  a  society.  Culture  has  been  described  as
features  that  are  shared  and  bind  people  together  into  a
community (17). Identity is the totality of one’s perception
of self, or how we as individuals view ourselves as unique
from  others.  Bhugra  (6,7)  notes  that  racial,  cultural  and
ethnic  identities  form  part  of  one’s  identity,  and  identity
will change with development at a personal as well as at a
social level along with migration and acculturation. Social
identity can be thought of as the culturally defined person-
ality  characteristics,  which  are  ascribed  to  social  roles,
such as the role of being a father, mother, friend, employer,
employee, etc. Ethnicity is a source of social identity. Eth-
nic groups are composed of people who may or may not
share the same race but do share common cultural charac-
teristics, including history, beliefs, values, food and enter-
tainment preferences, religion and language. Ethnicity typ-
ically  incorporates  both  race  and  culture  (17).  Race  is
based on biologic constructs, such as sharing certain phys-
ical attributes; it may or not be also a social and political
construct (17). For example, people from the West Indies,
Africa and parts of North and South America may share
the  same  race  but  have  different  beliefs,  value  systems,
social norms and idioms of distress.

Bhugra (6) notes that components of cultural identity
include religion, rites of passage, language, dietary habits
and leisure activities. Religious rituals and beliefs, even if
not followed as an adult, make up a key component of an
individual’s cultural identity. Religion can preserve values
within  the  community  and  foster  a  sense  of  belonging.
Rites of passage are important in the development of an
individual’s cultural identity; following these rites or ritu-
als is bound to influence the degree to which an individ-
ual will be accepted within the cultural group. Language,
both written and spoken, is a cultural marker. Bhugra (7)
writes  of  the  importance  of  linguistic  competence  and
economic stability as determinant factors prompting indi-
viduals  to  eventually  leave  their  non-dominant  cultural

group, which typically is geographically bound, and ven-
ture into the dominant culture. Attitudes to food and food
preparation,  including  religiously  driven  taboos  and  the
symbolism  of  food,  are  a  component  of  cultural  identity
that  can  be  influenced  by  religious  teachings.  Leisure
activities, including music, movies, sports, and literature,
are important components, along with language and reli-
gion, in allowing an individual to feel part of their culture
while living in a place with a different culture and may or
may not change during the acculturation process. Social
and  cultural  qualities  and  attitudes  are  typically  more
resistant  to  change  and  are  usually  last  to  adjust  during
acculturation (18). 

Psychosocial changes experienced by immigrants include
assimilation,  which  can  be  viewed  as  a  process  by  which
cultural  differences  disappear  as  immigrant  communities
adapt to the majority or host culture and value system. An
individual’s cultural identity may be lost during the assimila-
tion  process  as  he  or  she  moves  within  the  host  society.
Acculturation,  a  process  that  may  be  voluntary  or  forced,
requires contact between culturally divergent groups of peo-
ple  and  results  in  the  assimilation  of  cultural  values,  cus-
toms,  beliefs  and  language  by  a  minority  group  within  a
majority community (8). During the acculturation process,
both the immigrant and host cultures may change. Changes
in  attitudes,  family  values,  generational  status  and  social
affiliations can occur in both the majority and minority cul-
tures  as  the  two  interact;  however,  typically  one  culture
dominates (7). 

Cultural changes in identity can be stressful and result
in problems with self-esteem and mental health. Contact
between the immigrant, or minority, community with the
dominant  or  host  community  may  lead  to  assimilation,
rejection,  integration  or  deculturation  (8).  Rejection,  in
which  the  individual  or  minority  group  withdraws  from
the majority group, can lead to apartheid or segregation in
extreme  cases.  Deculturation,  in  which  the  individual  or
minority  group  experiences  a  loss  of  cultural  identity,
alienation and acculturative stress, can lead to ethnocide
(6). Post-migration stresses include culture shock and con-
flict, both of which may lead to a sense of cultural confu-
sion,  feelings  of  alienation  and  isolation,  and  depression
(8). Host societies’ attitudes, including racism, compound-
ed  by  stresses  of  unemployment,  a  discrepancy  between
achievement  and  expectations,  financial  hardships,  legal
concerns, poor housing and a general lack of opportuni-
ties for advancement within the host society, can lead to
mental health problems in vulnerable individuals.

Acculturation may help the culturally bereaved individ-
ual  to  gain  a  semblance  of  equilibrium.  Migrants  who
experience the loss of their culture and guilt over leaving
their homeland may find that, as the acculturation process
proceeds,  a  sense  of  belonging  in  their  new  homeland
occurs.  The  majority  culture  may  seem  less  threatening
and more inviting as the individual becomes more linguis-
tically and socially fluent in this new culture. Social sup-

21

port  can  ensue  in  the  forms  of  friendships,  employment
opportunities, and medical care. Integration and assimila-
tion  can  help  reduce  feelings  of  loss  and  grief  as  the
migrant  starts  to  incorporate  aspects  of  the  majority  cul-
ture. In acculturation, the interaction of the migrant’s cul-
ture  with  the  majority  culture  of  the  new  homeland  is  a
dynamic and reciprocal process that can result in changes
in the broader cultural group, enhancing the ability of peo-
ple of the dominant culture to better appreciate and under-
stand  aspects  of  the  immigrant’s  culture  and  recognize
some of the needs of those who have migrated.

CULTURAL CONGRUITY

Migrating  people  come  from  diverse  cultural  back-
grounds, with already formed cultural identities. As noted
above,  cultural  identity  is  influenced  by  various  factors
both  during  and  after  the  migration  process,  and  cultural
bereavement is a potential inherent consequence in people
who have migrated. Cultural identities interact, as people
who have migrated come into contact not only with people
of  the  majority  culture  but  also  with  immigrants  of  both
similar and disparate cultures. Resultant feelings of a sense
of belonging and comfort or a sense of alienation and dis-
tress may occur. Bhugra and Jones (9) proposed that vari-
ous  personal  and  relational  factors  during  the  migration
process impact the mental well being of migrating people.
During  the  post-migration  phase,  personal  factors  of
importance in coping with adversity include cultural iden-
tity, social support networks, self-esteem, and self-concept.
Achievement,  racism,  ethnic  density,  social  isolation  and
unemployment are among the relational factors of impor-
tance in migrants during the post-migration phase (7,9).   
Ethnic density, the size of a particular ethnic group in
proportion to the total population in a specified area, may
be a factor that influences the rates of mental illness in eth-
nic  minorities.  Additionally,  a  sense  of  alienation  may
occur if the cultural and social characteristics of an indi-
vidual  differ  from  those  of  the  surrounding  population,
whereas a sense of belonging tends to occur if the individ-
ual and surrounding population have similar cultural and
social characteristics. Bhugra (6) writes of the importance
of ethnic and cultural congruity, interaction patterns and
cultural identity in the genesis and maintenance of mental
distress in migrants. Cultural congruity may be thought of
as the congruence or dissonance of an individual’s culture,
beliefs and expectations with the surrounding population.
The  surrounding  population  may  be  made  up  predomi-
nantly of people from the same or different cultural back-
ground  compared  to  the  migrant.  An  increase  in  ethnic
density  may  improve  the  social  support  and  the  adjust-
ment of some individuals who have migrated, yet increase
distress  in  others,  in  particular  if  there  exists  a  cultural
conflict  between  the  individual  and  his  culture  of  origin
(9).  This  may  account  for  some  of  the  conflicting  results
from  studies  of  the  relationship  between  ethnic  density

and  the  incidence  of  mental  illness  in  ethnic  minority
groups.  For  example,  an  inverse  correlation  between  the
incidence of schizophrenia in non-white ethnic minorities
in London and the proportion of those minorities in the
local  population  was  found;  it  was  hypothesized  that
increased exposure to or a lack of protection from stress
may increase the rate of schizophrenia in non-white ethnic
minorities  (19);  however,  a  previous  study  failed  to  sup-
port the ethnic density hypothesis for the increased inci-
dence  of  schizophrenia  in  immigrant  groups  to  England
(20).

In  a  review  of  multiple  studies,  Shah  (17)  found  that
common mental disorders were more prevalent in people
of ethnic minority groups who lived in areas of low density
of their own ethnic group. His findings showed that com-
mon mental disorders were at least as prevalent in ethnic
minority  groups  as  in  the  indigenous  population  and,  in
some ethnic minority groups, more prevalent. Depression
may be more prevalent in the Caribbean and African popu-
lations compared to the majority population, with phobias
more common in Asian groups. Risk factors for common
mental disorders in ethnic minority groups include poverty,
unemployment,  migration  before  the  age  of  11,  racism,  a
perceived lack of social support, social isolation, absence
of  a  confidante  and  absence  of  parents  in  law  (17).  The
incidence of schizophrenia was higher in an urban area of
south-east London compared to rural areas in south-west
Scotland, due to the larger proportion of non-white ethnic
minority groups living in the urban area compared to the
rural area (21), with an overall increase in the incidence of
schizophrenia  in  south-east  London  between  1965  and
1997 (22).  

It is important to consider the nature of the society an
individual has migrated from and to, and the social char-
acteristics  of  the  individual  who  has  migrated,  in  deter-
mining how well a person will adjust during the migration
process.  Socio-centric,  or  collectivistic,  societies  stress
cohesiveness, strong ties between individuals, group soli-
darity,  emotional  inter-dependence,  traditionalism  and  a
collective identity. Egocentric, or individualistic, societies
stress independence, loose ties between individuals, emo-
tional  independence,  liberalism,  self-sufficiency,  individ-
ual initiative, and autonomy. Bhugra (6) has hypothesized
that  individuals  who  migrate  from  predominately  socio-
centric, or collectivistic, societies into a society that is pre-
dominately egocentric, or individualistic, are likely to have
problems  adjusting  to  the  new  culture,  especially  if  the
individuals are socio-centric in their own belief system. A
consequent  lack  of  an  adequate  social  support  system,  a
disparity  between  expectations  and  achievements  and  a
low self-esteem may result from this dissonance in culture
between  the  individual  and  the  surrounding  population.
An increase in ethnic density may help decrease the dis-
tress of the individual in this situation, especially by pro-
viding a social support system. For example, a person who
migrates to the United States, a predominately egocentric

society, from Vietnam, a predominately socio-centric soci-
ety, may feel isolated and alienated, especially if the indi-
vidual is socio-centric in outlook. Feelings of isolation and
alienation may be decreased, and social support improved,
if  other  people  from  Vietnam,  with  socio-centric  views,
surround this person in the area of resettlement; however,
the socio-centric individual may remain on the periphery
of  his/her  new  homeland’s  society  since  linguistic  and
social fluency of the dominant culture may not be attained.
Cultural bereavement may also be minimized if the immi-
grant is able to maintain ties to the culture of origin, either
through increased ethnic density, improved social support
or  maintenance  of  religious  beliefs  and  practice.  On  the
other hand, individuals who migrate from a predominate-
ly socio-centric culture into a society that is predominate-
ly egocentric in nature may experience little in the way of
problems, and a relatively easy transition to the new cul-
ture, if the person who has migrated is mostly egocentric,
or  individualistic,  in  his/her  outlook.  In  this  case,  an
increase  in  ethnic  density  may  be  disadvantageous  and
exacerbate or cause cultural conflict and mental distress.  

CONCLUSIONS

The proportion of ethnic minorities in the UK has been
increasing at least in part due to the migration of individu-
als from all over the world. Migration is a complex process,
involving a heterogeneity of causes, experiences, cultural
adjustment and stages, that influence the mental health of
migrants. The stresses of the migration process itself com-
bined with a lack of social support, a discrepancy between
achievement and expectations, economic hardships, racial
discrimination  and  harassment,  and  a  lack  of  access  to
proper  housing,  medical  care,  and  religious  practice  can
lead  to  poor  self-esteem,  an  inability  to  adjust,  and  poor
physical  and  mental  health.  Social  and  cultural  factors
have been implicated in the aetiology of mental illness in
immigrants  and  refugees,  and  further  study  is  needed  to
better  understand  the  role  of  culture  as  pathogenic  or
patho-protective (7).

Cultural bereavement, a paramount aspect of the migrant’s
experience,  is  influenced  by,  and  mediated  through,  the
interplay  of  the  migration  process,  cultural  identity  and
cultural congruity, along with biological and psychological
factors.  To  appropriately  guide  diagnosis  and  treatment
interventions, mental health practitioners must appreciate
and recognize the socio-cultural factors that influence the
manifestation of grief in people who have migrated. Cul-
tural  identity  and  congruity  will  affect  the  ability  of  the
affected  person  to  understand  and  work  through  the
grieving  process,  and  disturbances  of  identity  and  con-
gruity  are  likely  to  lead  to  a  pathologic,  or  complicated,
bereavement.

Rates of depression, phobias and schizophrenia are ele-
vated in some migrant groups. The understanding of race,
ethnicity,  social  isolation  and  a  lack  of  social  support,

racism,  unemployment  and  poverty,  poor  housing  and  a
lack of access to appropriate medical care is important in
explaining  the  increased  rates  of  mental  illness  in  ethnic
minority groups. Additionally, cultural congruity and eth-
nic  density,  cultural  identity,  and  biological  and  psycho-
logical factors are likely important influences in the devel-
opment of mental illness in migrants. With further study, a
better  understanding  of  the  complex  interplay  of  these
potential vulnerability factors may eventually lead to pre-
ventative measures and lessen the burden of mental illness
in this growing population.
