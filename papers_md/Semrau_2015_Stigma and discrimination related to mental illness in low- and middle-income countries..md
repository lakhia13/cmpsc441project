Aims. This paper aims to provide an overview of evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs) world-
wide to address: the nature of stigma and discrimination, relevant context-specific factors, global patterns of these phe-
nomena and their measurement and quantitative and qualitative evidence of interventions intended to reduce their
occurrence and impact. The background to this study is that the large majority of studies concerned with identifying
effective interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination originate in high-income countries (HICs). This paper there-
fore presents such evidence from, and relevant to, LAMICs.

Methods. Conceptual overview of the relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature on stigma and discrimination related
to mental illness in LAMICs are available in English, Spanish, French and Russian.

Results. Few intervention studies were identified related to stigma re-education in LAMICs. None of these addressed
behaviour change/discrimination, and there were no long-term follow-up studies. There is therefore insufficient evi-
dence at present to know which overall types of intervention may be effective and feasible and in LAMICs, how
best to target key groups such as healthcare staff, and how far they may need to be locally customised to be acceptable
for large-scale use in these settings. In particular, forms of social contacts, which have been shown to be the most effect-
ive intervention to reduce stigma among adults in HICs, have not yet been assessed sufficiently to know whether these
methods are also effective in LAMICs.

Conclusion. Generating information about effective interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination in LAMICs is
now an important mental health priority worldwide.

Introduction

The nature of stigma

Although stigma and discrimination are now recog-
nised as major barriers to full social inclusion for peo-
ple with mental illness across the world, most research
in this area originates from high-income countries
(HICs). This paper aims to provide a conceptual over-
view of the evidence from low- and middle-income
countries (LAMICs) worldwide, and summarises: the
nature of stigma and discrimination, relevant context-
specific factors, global patterns of these phenomena
and their measurement, and quantitative and qualita-
tive evidence of
interventions intended to reduce
their occurrence and impact.

The stigma associated with mental illness contributes
significantly to the burden of mental illness. Subjective
accounts of people affected by mental illness testify
that its effects are often perceived as more burdensome
and distressing than the primary condition itself
(Thornicroft, 2006). The term stigma refers to ‘a social
devaluation of a person‘ (Thara & Srinivasan, 2000,
p. 135), due to an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’
(Goffmann, 1963, p. 3), and can be conceptualised as
consisting of ‘problems of ignorance, prejudice and dis-
crimination’ (Thornicroft, 2006, p. 182). Discrimination
leads to disadvantages in many aspects of life, including
personal relationships, education and work. As a result
of the stigma which is internalised, some people with
mental illness may come to accept the discrediting pre-
judices held against them, and so lose self-esteem, lead-
ing to feelings of shame, a sense of alienation and social
withdrawal (Ritsher et al. 2003; Ritsher & Phelan, 2004).
Therefore, people with mental illness often expect to be

treated in a discriminatory way (‘anticipated discrimin-
ation’) and try to hide their illness, or to stop themselves
from taking up opportunities (Ritsher et al. 2003;
Thornicroft, 2006). A related concept is that of the
Right to Health, or its violation, which is an important
component of the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations,
2006).

Although it is widely accepted that stigma and dis-
crimination are at present universal phenomena,
experiences of stigma and discrimination are often
manifested in specifically local ways (Murthy, 2002).
Yang et al. point out that ‘across cultures, the mean-
ings, practices and outcomes of stigma differ, even
when we find stigmatisation to be a powerful and
often preferred response to illness, disability and dif-
ference’ (Yang et al. 2007, p.1528).

Although there is now a strong evidence base
describing stigma, the great majority of these studies
have been carried out
in high-income settings
(Corrigan et al. 2012; Griffiths et al. 2014; Knaak et al.
2014; Thornicroft et al. 2015). Research is clearly
needed to understand which aspects of stigma and dis-
crimination are the most common and burdensome in
LAMIC settings, where about 85% of the world’s
popuation live, and to clarify which determinants of
stigma are potentially modifiable. The aim of this
paper is to contribute an understanding of stigma
and dsicrimination that considers context-specific fac-
tors, and the evidence related to stigma from
LAMICs that will serve to inform interventions
intended to reduce stigma and discrimination. The
method used is a narrative review, drawing up recent
relevant primary data papers and literature reviews.

Context-specific factors relevant to stigma and
discrimination in LAMICs

In LAMICs, as in any other setting, experiences of stigma
and discrimination are subject to the influence of local
cultural factors (Murthy, 2002). Key domains through
which culture shapes the manifestations of stigma
include: (i) notions of ‘mental illness’ and explanatory
models (e.g., in many settings, psychiatric symptoms
may not be seen as indicative of an ‘illness’, and some-
times attributed to supernatural forces); (ii) cultural
meanings of the impairments and manifestations caused
by the disorder and its stigma (e.g., the impact of stigma
on a person’s marital prospects may have a different
impact on a person’s life depending on the cultural
meaning attached to marriage in a given society); and
(iii) concepts of self and personhood (e.g., higher levels
of family cohesion may offer more support, but also go
along with a more widespread impact of stigma across
family members and generations).

(i.e., differences

However, differences between settings,

including
between HICs and LAMICs, go beyond ‘cultural’ dif-
ferences
relating to beliefs and
norms). Socio-economic factors, such as poverty and
access to healthcare, have long been found to be asso-
ciated with outcomes of mental illness (Lund et al.
2011) and determine the context in which stigma is
enacted and experienced (Switaj
2009;
Thornicroft et al. 2009; Livingston & Boyd, 2010;
Evans-Lacko et
In India and other
LAMICs, where most people with mental illness do
not have access to social welfare benefits, the negative
economic consequences of stigma, e.g., through dis-
crimination in work, may be so severe as to threaten
the economic survival of entire families (Koschorke
et al. 2014).

al. 2013).

et

Global patterns of stigma and discrimination

al. 2012; Lasalvia et

There are few studies comparing the frequency of
experiences of stigma and discrimination in different
contexts. Recent research has sought to address this
gap in the literature. International surveys of experi-
enced and anticipated discrimination among people
with schizophrenia (27 countries) and among people
with depression (39 countries) found such rates to be
consistently high across countries (Thornicroft et al.
2009; Ucok et
al. 2013).
Significant between-country variations were found
for experienced discrimination, but not anticipated dis-
crimination reported by people with schizophrenia
(Thornicroft et al. 2009). A report on the qualitative
experiences of stigma and discrimination, however,
found few transnational differences (Rose et al. 2011).
On the other hand, some smaller studies suggest stark
differences between HIC and LAMIC settings, e.g., stud-
ies from China (Chung & Wong, 2004) and India
(Koschorke et al. 2014), with rates of experienced dis-
crimination much lower than those commonly reported
from HIC studies, and qualitative differences in the
meaning and appraisal of the experiences made. At
first sight, this appears to support the findings of early
cross-cultural research on stigma suggesting that the
stigma of mental illness may be less marked in non-
industrialised societies due to a more supportive envir-
onment with more social cohesion and therefore less
risk of prolonged rejection, isolation, segregation and

Organization (WHO, 1979;
Harrison et al. 2001; Hopper et al. 2007) has therefore
commonly been attributed to less stigmatisation in
LAMIC (Rosen, 2003).

384 M. Semrau et al.

However, contradicting this, there is now a consid-
erable body of evidence documenting that in many
LAMIC settings, experiences of stigma, discrimination
and human rights abuses due to mental illness are
common and severe (Phillips et al. 2002; Thara et al.
2003; Murthy, 2005; Lee et al. 2005; Botha et al. 2006;
Lee et al. 2006; Lauber & Rossler, 2007; Alonso et al.
2009; Barke et al. 2011; Drew et al. 2011; Sorsdahl
et al. 2012; Lasalvia et al. 2013). One international
study using population-wide data from 16 countries
found even higher rates of reported stigma among
people with mental disorders in developing (31.2%)
than in developed (20%) countries (Alonso et al. 2008).
In sum, our understanding of global patterns of
stigma and discrimination is still rather limited, and
further high-quality cross-cultural research is needed
to throw light on the forces that drive inter-cultural dif-
ferences in the manifestation of stigma. Given that
there is emerging evidence that not all aspects of
stigma and discrimination may be equally subject to
cross-cultural variation (Koschorke et al. 2014), such
research should take into account a range of forms of
stigma and discrimination and their context-specific
burden and meanings, in order to inform the develop-
ment of context-specific anti-stigma interventions.

Measurement of stigma and discrimination

in

the

the

interest

growing

The creation and validation of instruments to measure
stigma and discrimination against people with mental
illness have been underway since the 1960s. Although
early scales such as the Opinions About Mental Illness
Scale (Cohen & Struening, 1962; Link et al. 2004) and
the Community Attitudes Towards the Mentally Ill
(Taylor & Dear, 1981) are still used in some studies,
there have been many developments in both the
breadth and quantity of measures to assess stigma,
reflecting
field
(Evans-Lacko et al. 2014), incorporation of a wider
range of perspectives (especially that of service users
and carers (Lee et al. 2005; Henderson et al. 2014b),
and the changing aims and targets of anti-stigma inter-
ventions. Nevertheless, studies which include measures
developed or validated in LAMICs and/or non-Western
European cultures are still rare and only a few include a
component focused on stigma which was developed
specifically in a LAMIC country and/or non-Western
European cultural setting (Thornicroft et al., in press).
A recent systematic review (Yang et al. 2014) assessed
studies of stigma in non-Western European cultural
groups and found that 77% identified studies assessed
stigma using an adaptation of an existing measure
which was developed in Western European countries.
Moreover, only 2% studies used stigma measures
which were derived within a non-Western European

cultural group. Even among identified research studies
which used a qualitative research methodology, 82%
applied generic qualitative approaches which tended
to be inductive and which did not incorporate a theo-
retical framework of stigma.

We know from a growing body of research that
stigma and discrimination against people with mental
illness is an issue which persists across countries and
cultures. Variations in the manifestation of stigma
and hence, the ‘cultural validity’ of stigma indicators
suggest that measurement of stigma-related constructs
also requires local adaptation (Weiss et al. 2001).
Although applying a proper translation and incorpor-
ating appropriate language or relevant idioms are
important for comprehensibility and understanding
of questions, forward and back translation of an instru-
ment is not sufficient to address the ‘cultural validity’ of
stigma concepts. There may be important differences in:
the nature of stigma, what is stigmatised and how it is
stigmatised (Weiss et al. 2001) according to different
population subgroups. Thus, local cultural adaptation
of an instrument may require consideration of a variety
of factors including, for instance, geographic region,
race, ethnicity, nationality, social class, or other factors
which might influence language, beliefs and experi-
ences. All of these are critical considerations for mea-
surement as they also relate to the consequences of
stigma and potential targets of anti-stigma interventions.
there are two approaches which are
mainly used when developing culture-specific mea-
sures (Yang et al. 2014). In the first instance, an instru-
ment which was developed in a HIC is translated and
then psychometrically validated in a new subpopula-
tion, potentially with some slight adaptations. The sec-
the development of a ‘composite
ond involves
measure’ which incorporates experiences which were
assessed across a range of contexts and/or cultures.
As outlined above, Yang et al. have recently proposed
a third approach, that is incorporating a ‘what matters
most’ perspective (Yang et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2014).
This approach would require investigating and opera-
tionalising everyday activities which are significant in
participants’ lives and which play a role in shaping
stigma and/or have consequences for the stigmatised
person.

Currently,

In addition to the issue around cultural adaptation
of measurement tools, there are other gaps in what
can be assessed using available measures. These
include a lack of indicators for structural stigma and
which measure stigmatising behaviour, targeted or tai-
lored measures for specific subgroups and use of
unvalidated measures. Future efforts should continue
to address these gaps, with a particular emphasis in
LAMIC countries where literature is sparse, as mea-
surement and evaluation are critical to understand

the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of anti-
stigma interventions.

Evidence of interventions to reduce stigma and
discrimination

Evidence from qualitative studies and the grey literature

Most studies analysing the outcomes of interventions
addressing mental health stigma are quantitative
(Thornicroft et al. in press). Within the limited qualita-
tive literature, even fewer studies are carried out in
LAMICs (Thornicroft et al. in press). A recent systematic
review appraising the global evidence for effective inter-
ventions to change mental health stigma revealed a sin-
gle randomised controlled trial (RCT), with qualitative
outcomes, carried out over several countries, including
‘Regarding
some LAMICs (Wasserman et al. 2012).
interventions related to knowledge rather than attitudes
or behaviour/discrimination’ (Thornicroft et al. 2007),
this project was an educational awareness programme
and it was developed to meet the mental health needs
of adolescents using a mixture of learning modalities.
Coordinators within their respective sites answered a
semi-structured questionnaire, the responses of which
were later analysed and grouped into themes by two
independent assessors. Although the intervention was
successful in promoting discussion of certain mental
health-related topics and encouraging social support
networks between students, the weaknesses of the pro-
gramme were due to the lack of flexibility of the RCT
design and the burden on schools delivering the
programme.

The use of mass media as a portal for raising aware-
ness has shown positive effects in a number of HICs,
including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the
UK (Sartorius & Schulze, 2005). From considering the
grey literature (see Table 1), within LAMICs various
forms of media have been utilised. In India, as part
of the anti-stigma campaign, a group of artists per-
formed a ‘Street play’ in various locations to increase
mental health awareness among the public (Table 1).
In Egypt, a study by Khairy et al. (2012) evaluating
the potential benefits of a mass media campaign con-
cluded that it was somewhat successful in changing
attitudes and behaviours of participants that had
been exposed to the televised educational clips.
However, when changes in attitudes and behaviours
were compared between those that had been exposed
to the campaign and those that had not, no statistically
significant differences emerged (Khairy et al. 2012).

Such interventions in LAMICs have had varying
degrees of geographical and governmental involve-
ment. Most interventions, such as those of the Mental
Health Foundation in Nigeria and the Kintampo

project in Ghana are at a national level. Others, such
as the Minds Foundation in India, work regionally to
improve mental health literacy through educational
workshops within rural communities. Some countries
i.e., Liberia and Morroco have demonstrated anti-
In
stigma policies within national policy papers.
Liberia the anti-stigma campaigns aim to promote
the rights and needs of those with mental
illness
through advocacy.

Although many interventions are descriptive, a
selected few systematically evaluated the effectiveness
using project outcomes (Thornicroft et al. in press).
Additionally, a limited number are published in peer
reviewed journals or reports (Kakuma et al. 2010).
Only one study in Jamaica found positive changes in
attitudes following the deinstitutionalisation and inte-
gration of mental health into primary healthcare
(Table 1). The Minds Foundation in India, lacking for-
mal evaluation, however does state that questionnaires
have shown an improvement in attitudes towards
those with mental health disorders.
In overview,
there are few stigma-related intervention studies in
LAMICs, they tend to be small, they are methodologic-
ally rather diverse and do not allow combined inter-
pretation, and there are no cost-effectiveness analyses
of these interventions.

Evidence from quantitative studies

Related to suicide prevention, there is some evidence
that specific training programmes may be effective in
improving knowledge and attitudes among primary
care staff, as shown in an interventions study in
Campinas in Brazil (Da Silva Cais et al. 2011). More
generally, despite the scarcity of evidence for anti-
stigma interventions from LAMICs,
there is some
emerging evidence from a few countries of interven-
tions that do show promise of being effective. Several
projects are now recognising the importance of includ-
ing ways to address stigma and discrimination within
their programme of work. The ‘Emerging mental
health systems in LAMICs’ (EMERALD) programme
(see www.emerald-project.eu),
for instance, which
aims to improve mental health outcomes by generating
evidence and capacity to enhance health system per-
formance
in six African and Asian LAMICs
(Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa and
Uganda), is an example of how stigma elements can
be incorporated into larger programmes of work.
Within its 5-year programme, EMERALD is address-
ing stigma as one of the key barriers for access to
and successful delivery of mental health services in
LAMICs. The programme is generating evidence on
how best to address stigma in LAMICs through a
range of approaches, which includes maximising

service user and caregiver involvement within the pro-
gramme to promote their inclusion and to reduce
stigma and discrimination; garnering lessons on how
best to reduce stigma in LAMICs through key inform-
ant
stakeholder groups
(including service users and caregivers), as well as
policy-makers, health planners, health staff and other
relevant groups.

interviews with relevant

Research projects in other LAMICs are incorporating
stigma-related elements into either more targeted or
into larger programmes of work. As an example of
the former is an RCT in China which assessed knowl-
edge and attitudes of medical students towards people
with depression, and which showed that didactic teach-
ing and self-directed learning were shown to be super-
ior than didactic teaching alone (Rong et al. 2011).
Another mental health staff orientated study conducted
an RCT of an internet-based intervention for trainee and
trained psychiatrists in Turkey, and found improved
attitudes towards people with mental illness for those
receiving the web-based intervention (Bayar et al. 2009).

Discussion

This paper sets the scene and provides out the evidence
which leads to the following key conclusions. Stigma
and discrimination have been identified as major nega-
tive forces against full citizenship and social participa-
tion everywhere that they have been assessed. The
local manifestations of stigma to some extent depend
upon the social and cultural context of those affected.
The force of research findings from HICs is that the
most effective interventions to reduce stigma among
adults is social contact between people with and with-
illness (Thornicroft et al.
out experience of mental
2015), while for young people education interventions
have been shown to be most effective (Corrigan et al.
2012). There is insufficient evidence at present
to
know which overall types of intervention may be effect-
ive and feasible and in LAMICs, how best to target key
groups such as healthcare staff (Henderson et al. 2014a),
and how far they may need to be locally customised to
be acceptable for large-scale use in these settings.
Generating information about effective interventions
to reduce stigma and discrimination in LAMICs is
now an important mental health priority worldwide.
