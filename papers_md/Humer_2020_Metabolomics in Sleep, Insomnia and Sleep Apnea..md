Abstract: Sleep-wake disorders are highly prevalent disorders, which can lead to negative eﬀects on
cognitive, emotional and interpersonal functioning, and can cause maladaptive metabolic changes.
Recent studies support the notion that metabolic processes correlate with sleep. The study of
metabolite biomarkers (metabolomics) in a large-scale manner oﬀers unique opportunities to provide
insights into the pathology of diseases by revealing alterations in metabolic pathways. This review
aims to summarize the status of metabolomic analyses-based knowledge on sleep disorders and to
present knowledge in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. Overall,
ﬁndings suggest that sleep-wake disorders lead to pronounced alterations in speciﬁc metabolic
pathways, which might contribute to the association of sleep disorders with other psychiatric
disorders and medical conditions. These alterations are mainly related to changes in the metabolism
of branched-chain amino acids, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. In insomnia, alterations
in branched-chain amino acid and glucose metabolism were shown among studies. In obstructive
sleep apnea, biomarkers related to lipid metabolism seem to be of special importance. Future studies
are needed to examine severity, subtypes and treatment of sleep-wake disorders in the context of
metabolite levels.

1. Introduction

Sleep is a pivotal operating state of the central nervous system, which controls organismal
well-being and might be the most well-preserved activity throughout the evolutionary timescale [1,2].
Sleep occupies up to a third of the human lifespan [3] and represents one of the most important
psychophysiological processes for brain function and mental health [2]. It is well-documented that
sleep disorders are highly prevalent in patients with mental disorders and they can lead to adverse
eﬀects on cognitive, emotional and interpersonal functioning [4,5]. Furthermore, sleep is required to
balance catabolic activities experienced during the wake time by switching to anabolic functions [6],
which indicates the essential role of sleep in restorative functions [7]. A lack of sleep contributes
to maladaptive changes causing metabolic disorders, such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes and obesity [8–11]. Insuﬃcient sleep has been demonstrated to cause enhanced expression of
genes related to oxidative stress and immune response [12]. Additionally, partial sleep deprivation has
been related to activated DNA damage response and promoted cellular senescence [13]. Sleep plays
a pivotal role in memory consolidation, with slow wave sleep (SWS) being assumed to signiﬁcantly
impact the consolidation of acquired memories, while rapid eye movement (REM) is thought to be
important for the stabilization of formed memories [14]. Animal models and human studies revealed
that the process of aging is accompanied by alterations in sleep-wake activities [15], with aging

individuals being unable to sustain a sleep state and having an overall lower sleep eﬃciency [16,17].
Lower sleep eﬃciency likely contributes signiﬁcantly to the memory impairments associated with
aging. A lack of SWS has been shown to impair long-term memory in cognitively normal older
adults [18]. Furthermore, the incidental development of Alzheimer’s disease has been linked to lack of
sleep [19]. To sum up, healthy sleep is required for restoring function and vitality, maintaining immune
function and promoting memory consolidation and stabilization. Problems with sleep can enhance
the risk of psychiatric disorders, somatic disorders (i.e., heart disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome),
traﬃc accidents and memory problems, as well as impaired functioning in general [20,21].

Overall, many individuals are aﬀected by sleep disorders. Insomnia has a prevalence of 10% to
15% in the general population. Sleep apnea represents the second most prevalent sleep disorder with
about 10%, followed by other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and circadian rhythm
disorders [22]. Growing evidence suggests that sleep disorders coexist with other psychiatric disorders
and medical conditions, which are often interactive and bidirectional [23]. Overall, the latest version
of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) [24] recognizes the need for
independent clinical attention to sleep-wake disorders and considers pathological and etiological
factors [23]. Sleep-wake disorders encompass ten disorders or diagnostic groups [25]: insomnia
disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders (i.e., obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation), circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorders, non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorder, REM sleep
behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome and substance-/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients
with these diagnoses typically express dissatisfaction regarding the quality, amount and timing of
sleep. Daytime distress and impairment represent core symptoms typically resulting from all of these
sleep-wake disorders [24].

Recent studies support the notion that metabolic processes correlate with sleep [26]. The global
scale study of metabolite biomarkers (metabolomics) in a large metabolite bandwidth manner oﬀers
unique opportunities to capture phenotypic changes of sleep-wake disorders and provide biomarkers
for their prevention, diagnosis and prognosis and treatment monitoring. In this review, we aim to
address the present status of knowledge on sleep from metabolomics analysis and to present knowledge
in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. As not every diagnostic group has
been investigated using metabolomics approaches, the following review summarizes metabolomics
studies for insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea. In addition, the eﬀect of sleep on the metabolome in
healthy individuals exposed to sleep deprivation, sleep fragmentation or sleep restriction is reviewed.
The following chapters summarize studies on the use of metabolomics approaches to reveal
metabolic changes occurring due to alterations in sleep-wake activity. Therefore, a literature search
was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, and APA Psycinfo databases. Research articles in scientiﬁc
journals on experiments using animal models or human subjects were considered. The search was
conducted in July 2020, with no limitations on the publication date. Articles were identiﬁed by
searching for titles using the following search terms: “metabolom*” AND “sleep* OR insomnia* OR
apnea”. Despite the strategic literature search strategy, the current study does not follow PRISMA
(preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines for systematic reviews
(e.g., quality assessment of studies).

2. Insomnia Disorder

Insomnia is regarded as a disorder in itself that needs independent clinical attention [27]. Therefore,
the DSM-5 does not diﬀer between primary and comorbid insomnia [24]. The diagnostic criteria
are: repeated diﬃculties (at least three times a week for at least three months) with sleep initiation,
maintenance, consolidation or quality that occur despite ample opportunity to sleep and that result in
signiﬁcant distress or impairment in functioning [25].

Studies suggest that poor or decreased sleep causes metabolic changes in peripheral metabolism
(Table 1). In individuals with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia, analysis of serum samples every 2 h over

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 7244

3 of 16

48 h under diurnal lighting demonstrated that the general insomniac proﬁle clearly diﬀered from age-,
sex-, and race-matched controls. More speciﬁcally, alterations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)
metabolism and lactate peak timing and amplitudes were observed [28].

Overall, most studies conducted thus far imposed short-term sleep deprivation and/or sleep
restriction protocols in normal subjects; however, these are not reﬂective of long-term sleep habits (i.e.,
chronic sleep loss and/or sleep timing and/or pathological sleep conditions such as insomnia). A recent
study aimed to ﬁll this gap by investigating real world sleep habits in insomnia in humans. More
speciﬁcally, metabolomics was applied on fasting plasma samples from 277 individuals over the course
of a year where participants kept to their normal sleep habits. Here, 64 metabolites were found to be
associated with sleep timing, with representation from all classes detected [29]. Elevated levels of
amino acid metabolites, such as BCAAs and gamma glutamyl dipeptides, were associated with later
sleep timing and no signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences were observed [29]. In this study, the authors were also
able to compare proﬁles from insomniacs versus controls and observed elevated energy metabolites
and reduced BCAA catabolic products in insomniacs, particularly during the night. Altered phases
of rhythmic metabolites were also observed in the insomnia samples compared to the controls [28],
further implying a role for sleep in maintaining temporal separation. These results are consistent with
a hyperarousal hypothesis in insomnia, which has been observed at the cognitive level, with limited
previous evidence in metabolism. Speciﬁcally, phase advances and increased catabolism of BCAAs
along with altered glucose metabolism were observed during the night in insomniacs, both of which
point to increased susceptibility to diabetes [28]. These studies taken together suggest a conserved role
of BCAAs in altered glucose metabolism and in disrupted sleep.

Despite a lack of (biological) chronic insomnia models that might enable the identiﬁcation
of insomnia biomarkers, some biomarkers can be suggested. Among those, alterations in BCAA
and glucose metabolism show similarities among studies [30–32].

Taken together, these changes suggest that bedtime metabolic activity is shifted towards catabolism

in patients with insomnia [28].

3. Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Within the category of breathing-related sleep disorders, most research has been conducted on
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which refers to a disturbance in breathing during sleep. The diagnosis
is based on the number of episodes of upper airway collapse while sleeping, measured via
polysomnography through overnight monitoring. Nocturnal breathing disturbances can cause snoring,
gasping and breathing pauses during sleep, but also daytime impairments, such as sleepiness, fatigue
or unrefreshing sleep despite suﬃcient opportunities to sleep [25]. Sleep apnea is strongly related
to lifestyle diseases, with obesity representing a major risk factor for OSA; thus, the global increase
in obesity likely contributes to the observed increase in OSA over time [34]. There is an association
between OSA and mental health, showing comorbidities with depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety
and post-traumatic stress disorders, as well as psychosis and schizophrenia [35,36]. Sleep apnea has
also been found to be correlated with cardiac events, whereby the underlying metabolic mechanisms
have barely been investigated so far [37].

Metabolomic approaches have been applied in the study of OSA, whereby they can be categorized
into two types of studies, including (1) metabolomic studies of exhaled breath [38–40], and (2) studies
of the blood and/or urine metabolome [41–44].

Exhaled breath is well suited for metabolomics analyses as its condensate can be easily obtained
by cooling exhaled air from spontaneous tidal breathing and thus represents a non-invasive sampling
method [45]. Although exhaled breath is comprised of 99.9% water, volatile organic compounds,
non-volatile organic compounds and inorganic compounds are also included. Organic compounds
comprise of amino acids and their derivatives, peptides, proteins, urea, organic acids, surfactants
and macromolecules [46]. Studies show enhanced levels of inﬂammatory markers related to oxidative
stress in the exhaled breath of OSA patients. Markers of chronic inﬂammation were enhanced,
showing an increase in pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, while anti-inﬂammatory cytokines decreased [47].
Furthermore, elevations of toxic volatile organic compounds in patients with OSA were observed [38].
More speciﬁcally, aromatic hydrocarbons (phenylacetic acid, ethylbenzene, toluene and p-xylene),
saturated hydrocarbons (hexane, octane, heptane, nonane and decane), acetone and isoprene were
elevated, which have been suggested as potential biomarkers. However, studies have shown that
changes in the metabolomics proﬁle of exhaled breath might not be speciﬁc enough to diﬀerentiate
between patients with diﬀerent respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and OSA [42]. Therefore, the second group of studies (studies of the blood and/or urine metabolome)
might provide a more speciﬁc characterization of OSA.

The general notion is that metabolic biomarkers obtained from blood and/or urine samples
are potentially useful in understanding OSA mechanisms and OSA management. A systematic
review of individual metabolites detected by chromatography and/or mass spectrometry supports
this conclusion [48]. Several metabolites related to lipid metabolism, amino acids, oxidative stress
pathways, adrenergic/dopaminergic biomarkers and micromolecules have been reported to be altered
in patients with OSA. Overall, studies conducted on blood or urine samples show evidence of
perturbation of lipid metabolism [49], with an elevation of both fasting [50] and post-prandial
lipid levels [51]. As post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia has been linked to elevated cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality, an altered lipidomic equilibrium is suggested to be crucial for OSA-related
cardiovascular disorders [52]. The accelerated atherogenesis in OSA is likely due to lipid metabolic
dysregulation and dyslipidemia, as revealed in animal studies [53,54]. As reviewed by Xu et al. [55],
at least 10 diﬀerent metabolomics studies in clinical populations revealed plasma biomarkers
of OSA. Overall, metabolites related to lipid-metabolism represented a signiﬁcant fraction of
reported biomarkers, comprising mainly lipids or related biomarkers. Those biomarkers included
phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, posphatidylserines, lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidic
acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelins) [41,56] and circulating endocannabinoids [57].
Furthermore, diﬀerences in urine metabolome were observed, including changes in acylcarnitines,
glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins [58]. Further metabolites that have been suggested as

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 7244

5 of 16

OSA-biomarkers are acylcarnitine C14:1, sphingomyelin 18:1 and symmetric dimethylarginine [1].
Urine metabolomics analysis was also applied to diﬀerentiate between OSA, simple snorers
and healthy controls [43]. A combination of six metabolites (4-hydroxypentenoic acid, arabinose,
glycochenodeoxycholate-3-sulfate, isoleucine, serine and xanthine) was capable of distinguishing
between individuals with OSA and without OSA. In addition, a combination of ﬁve metabolites
(4-hydroxypentenoic acid, 5-dihydrotestosterone sulfate, serine, spermine and xanthine) enabled
the diﬀerentiation of OSA-individuals from simple snorers. Elevated levels of BCAAs and altered
insulin sensitivity have also been observed in children diagnosed with OSA [59]. These results
also point to metabolic dysfunction and altered glucose metabolism in OSA patients, in addition to
an increased risk of developing diabetes. These studies, taken together, suggest a conserved role of
BCAAs in altered glucose metabolism and in disrupted sleep.

Although continuous positive airwave pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for patients with
OSA [60], there is a lack of research on its eﬀect on metabolomic proﬁles. The application of traditional
chemometric approaches suggests an improved glucose metabolism as indicated by an improved
glycemic control and insulin resistance when compared to a control group [61]. The CPAP treatment
has also been shown to improve lipid metabolism in pre-post comparisons, showing a decrease
in total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, and an increase in high-density lipoproteins in
patients subjected to CPAP treatment [62]. However, a study conducted in women observed no
change of metabolites related to glucose and lipid metabolism (i.e., glucose, cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin and homeostasis model of
insulin resistance) in OSA-patients receiving CPAP therapy as compared to a conservative treatment [60].
Therefore, metabolomics studies are needed to conﬁrm ﬁndings suggesting beneﬁcial eﬀects of CPAP
treatment on metabolism.

4. Sleep Deprivation

Sleep deprivation (no sleep opportunity), sleep restriction (partial sleep opportunity) and circadian
clock disruption are associated with negative effects on mental health as well as metabolic disorders [63,64].
Table 2 depicts studies using metabolomics approaches in the study of sleep deprivation.

Diﬀerences in the plasma [30] and urine [65] metabolome have been found in sleep-deprived
humans. In plasma, 27 of 171 metabolites—mainly lipids and acylcarnitines—increased during sleep
deprivation. Furthermore, serotonin, tryptophan and taurine were enhanced, which might be one reason
behind the anti-depressive eﬀect reported for sleep deprivation [66]. This study speciﬁcally aimed to
characterize circadian metabolomics variations in sleep-deprived humans. A circadian rhythmicity
was observed in more than 50% of the cycling plasma metabolites, comprised of several metabolic
classes, such as amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids.
Although a circadian rhythmicity was also observed in the absence of a night’s sleep, the amplitudes of
all the metabolites were lower due to sleep deprivation [30].

In men, sleep deprivation caused a change of about half of the identiﬁed urinary metabolites.
More speciﬁcally, it caused an increase of eight urinary metabolites (taurine, formate, citrate,
3-indoxyl sulfate, carnitine, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, trimethylamine N-oxide and acetate), while another
eight metabolites (dimethylamine, 4-deoxythreonic acid, creatinine, ascorbate, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate,
allantoin, 4-deoxyeryhtronic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate) decreased [65]. Furthermore, diurnal
variations in the urinary metabolomics proﬁles were observed, emphasizing the need to consider
the sampling time in the study of biomarkers.

Besides metabolomics studies conducted on plasma and urine samples, animal models have
been used to obtain direct information about brain changes due to sleep deprivation. A recent study
conducted in mice investigated the metabolome of the prefrontal cortex during sleep, sleep deprivation
and spontaneous wakefulness [67]. Overall, 11 known metabolites were observed to be higher after
wakefulness (in most of the cases, after spontaneous as well as enforced wakefulness), whereas no
metabolite was found in higher concentrations after sleep. Metabolites that changed were mainly

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 7244

related to amino acid (glutamate, tryptophan) and energy metabolism (lactate, pyruvate), glucose
metabolism (gluconate), pyrimidine pathway (orotate, uridine) and intermediates of the tricarboxylic
cycle (succinate).

Metabolomics approaches have also been applied in a study investigating treatment responses.
In a study conducted in rats submitted to sleep deprivation, the potential of extracts from Panax ginseng
to restore serum and brain metabolic proﬁles was investigated [68]. Panax ginseng is a traditional
Chinese medicine which is known for its multiple activities in the nervous system, such as improving
cognition [70], but also to modulate eﬀects of sleep deprivation on the blood system [71]. An extract from
Panax ginseng has shown to improve cognition and behavior in a rodent model of sleep deprivation.
Metabolomics analysis of brain tissues samples revealed a change in 39 metabolites due to sleep

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 7244

deprivation, whereas 40 metabolites changed in serum samples. Animals receiving ginsenoides
showed a tendency to recover compared to the control group, which corresponded to recovering eﬀects
on behavioral and biochemical parameters. It has been suggested that ginsenoids are able to regulate
dysfunctional energy, BCAA and adenosine metabolism as well as oxidative stress.

5. Sleep Restriction

Overall, sleep restriction better reﬂects the real life situation than total sleep deprivation. Several
studies have investigated changes in the metabolic proﬁle of individuals experiencing insuﬃcient
sleep (Table 3).

Reducing sleep has been shown to be associated with pronounced shifts in the lipid
metabolome. Biomarkers of insuﬃcient sleep were investigated in plasma samples of 16 normal-weight
participants [72]. The individuals were subjected to three days with suﬃcient (9 h) sleep opportunity
(Baseline), followed by a 5-day period of insuﬃcient (5 h) sleep opportunity and ﬁnal 5-day adequate
(9 h) sleep opportunity. Metabolites diﬀerentiating insuﬃcient vs. adequate sleep were mainly related
to ATP-binding cassette transporters in lipid homeostasis, phospholipid metabolic process, plasma
lipoprotein remodeling and sphingolipid metabolism. The changes in the lipid metabolome due to
sleep restriction have also been observed by Weljie et al. [73]. In adult healthy individuals, four hours of
sleep restriction for ﬁve days caused considerable alterations in lysophosphatidylcholines, triglycerides,
phosphatidylcholines and acylcarnitines in the plasma of healthy individuals when compared to
their baseline measurements. A single night of recovery could not restore the decreased level of
long-chain acylcarnitines [73]. In addition, changes in amino acids were found, along with an increase in
tryptophan and phenylalanine. A more acute sleep restriction paradigm demonstrated strong changes
in lipid metabolism in healthy individuals with familial diabetic history [31]. A sleep opportunity of 5.5
h as compared to a baseline night of 8 h sleep opportunity caused changes in medium-chain fatty-acid
(caproate), carnitine, lysolipid, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, with an elevation of most plasma
lipid metabolites. Furthermore, changes in carbohydrate and amino acid (i.e., tryptophan) metabolism
were observed. Additionally, metabolites related to mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation were found to
be impacted by sleep restriction, showing an increase in acylcarnitines in healthy as well as diabetic
individuals [74]. The detrimental eﬀect of sleep restriction on metabolic health is also supported by
metabolomics studies observing a decrease of high-density lipoproteins across two populations with
subjective sleep insuﬃciency [75].

Rodent studies provide further insights into the effect of sleep restriction on energy metabolism
and on the clinical complications of sleep restriction, including obesity, diabetes and neurological
disorders. A study conducted in rats revealed altered hepatic profiles indicative of changes in hepatic
energy metabolism, as well as alterations in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathways
and transmethylation pathways. Findings suggest that sleep restriction reduced activity of the tricarboxylic
acid cycle, which went along with a concomitant increase in lipogenesis [76].

6. Sleep Fragmentation

Sleep fragmentation refers to brief arousals occurring during sleep. Arousals occur frequently
in patients with sleep disorders, such as OSA, but are also often induced by external factors, such as
noise, bright light or high temperature during sleep [77]. Sleep fragmentation often goes along with
excessive daytime sleepiness [78] and decreased daytime functioning [79].

Animal models are used to study the pathophysiological mechanism of sleep fragmentation as
summarized in Table 4. The underlying mechanism of the detrimental eﬀects of sleep interruption on
cognitive functions remains largely unknown to date. A study conducted in mice submitted to chronical
sleep interruption was undertaken to study its eﬀect on serum metabolome and brain antioxidative
metabolites as well as cognitive function [80]. Sleep fragmentation strongly aﬀected cognitive function,
which went along with an increase in the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde in the brain,
while the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased. Therefore, the cognitive
decline might be related to excessive oxidative stress in the brain; however, perturbations of the systemic
metabolism likely also contribute to the cognitive impairment. In this regard, 13 potential biomarkers
related to amino acid, purine and lipid metabolism were identiﬁed in the serum. These metabolites
included valine, choline, uric acid, allantoic acid, carnitines and retinoids. Furthermore, the chronic
sleep interruption was associated with considerable weight loss.

neurogenesis [81]. To reveal possible mechanisms by which sleep fragmentation impairs hippocampal
neurogenesis, metabolomics might help to better understand the detrimental eﬀects of sleep
fragmentation on the brain. A recent study conducted in rodents pinpoints a metabolomic impact
of sleep fragmentation on the brain. More speciﬁcally, Yoon et al. [77] analyzed metabolite
proﬁles of the hippocampus in rats exposed to a 4- or 15-day sleep fragmentation protocol as
compared to a 4- or 15-day exercise control group. Distinctive metabolic proﬁles were observed in
the 15-day sleep fragmentation group, with most pronounced eﬀects on the amino acid metabolism.
More speciﬁcally, the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways were identiﬁed as
the common key pathways in rats subjected to sleep fragmentation for 15 days. An increase
in tryptophan, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine was also observed, while methionine,
glycerophosphocholine, adenosine monophosphate and hypoxanthine were decreased [77].

The role of the gut microbiome for mental and physical health disorders received increasing
research interest in recent years [84,85]. A study conducted in rats investigated the eﬀect of sleep
fragmentation on their gut microbiome and fecal metabolome [82]. Rats subjected to a 28-day
sleep fragmentation protocol showed a lower alpha-diversity and pronounced shifts in the fecal
microbiome as well as changes in the fecal metabolome. Several fecal metabolites correlated with blood
pressure, which might provide an insight into the reported link of sleep fragmentation and deleterious
cardiovascular changes [86]. Furthermore, the eﬀects of sleep fragmentation on the fecal metabolome
and microbiome were investigated in mice [83]. A sub-chronic, ﬁve-day sleep disruption protocol
caused a change in the level of bacterially-modiﬁed metabolites, such as bile acids, and caused
a reduction of beneﬁcial bacterial genera. Changes in the metabolic and microbial proﬁle lasted at least
four days after the end of the sleep disruption. Therefore, studies suggest an interplay between
the microbiome and sleep-wake disorders which should be addressed in future studies.

7. Conclusions

This review on the application of metabolomics in the study of sleep disorders clearly suggests
alterations in speciﬁc metabolic pathways which likely contribute to the association of sleep-wake
disorders with other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. Although diﬀerences in study
populations and technologies used for the proﬁling of metabolites complicate comparison of these

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 7244

10 of 16

studies, a common pattern seems to arise in terms of changes in BCAA metabolic pathways.
Furthermore, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as antioxidative status, were found to be aﬀected
by changes in physiological sleep-wake cycles in several studies.

Overall, the observed results suggest that especially the BCAA metabolism is associated with
the sleep-wake regulation. The three BCAAs L-leucine, L-valine, and L-isoleucine must be acquired
through diet, as they cannot be synthesized de novo [87]. In several studies, BCAA concentrations were
altered in sleep-wake disorders (Tables 1–4). Elevated BCAA catabolism and glucose concentrations
during the night have been suggested as initial signs of insulin resistance and have been implicated in
the etiology of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome [88,89].

In general, BCAAs are transported through the blood–brain barrier via the L-type or large amino
acid transporter 1 (LAT1) to serve as a major nitrogen source for the brain [90]. As LAT1 is shared by
several large amino acids, including BCAAs and aromatic amino acids (AAAs), these large amino acids
compete for access to the LAT1 to be transported from the blood into the central nervous system [91].
The AAA tryptophan is a substrate for serotonin, while both tyrosine and phenylalanine are precursors
for catecholamine (dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine) synthesis [92]. The three BCAAs are
key elements in the de novo synthesis of glutamate [93]. An excess of BCAAs caused by sleep-wake
disorders, can reduce the uptake of the serotonin precursor tryptophan and the catecholamine
precursors tyrosine and phenylalanine; therefore, the decreased inhibitory neurotransmitters (serotonin
and catecholamines) and increased excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate and aspartate) might
maintain the waking of the brain [68]. Elevation of BCAAs during nighttime has also been linked
to daytime fatigue, likely due to their capacity to reduce the transport of tryptophan through
the blood–brain barrier, ﬁnally aﬀecting serotonin levels [94]. This is supported by an observed
reduction of daytime tryptophan and phenylalanine in patients with insomnia [28]. As serotonin is
signiﬁcantly involved in the sleep/wake regulation [95], a decreased serotonin concentration due to
reduced uptake of its precursor tryptophan has been speculated to explain the impaired ability to
initiate and maintain sleep [28].

While on the one hand, elevation of BCAAs in healthy individuals can negatively affect the sleep/wake
rhythmicity and metabolic health, on the other hand, supplementation of BCAAs has been suggested
as a viable therapy for treating sleep/wake disturbances in individuals suffering from traumatic brain
injury [19]. Traumatic brain injury can result in disturbed sleep, whereby supplementation of BCAAs
in mice subjected to a mild brain injury has been shown to improve quality of sleep [19]. As BCAAs
are essential for de novo cerebral synthesis of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), BCAA
supplementation is expected to be able to restore pools of releasable vesicular glutamate, which have
been reported to decrease after traumatic brain injury [96]. A decreased concentration of glutamate leads
to reduced excitatory inputs onto the wake-promoting system [97]. Studies conducted in rodents suggest
that BCAA supplementations can restore normal cortical excitability through direct action on orexin
neurons, which are a critical components of the sleep/wake regulatory system [98]. Moreover, BCAA
supplementation has been shown to restore cognitive function after impairment due to traumatic brain
injury in rodents [97].

Despite the overwhelming consensus that metabolomics bears potential for biomarkers in
the management of sleep-wake disorders, there are still limitations in the existing metabolomics work.
A major limitation is that existing studies mainly focused on relatively small sample sizes under limited
clinical conditions [64]. Although several studies were already conducted with human subjects, many of
them were limited to healthy individuals submitted to speciﬁc sleeping regimens. Thus, further studies
with larger sample sizes of patients with sleeping disorders are needed to gain deeper knowledge
on the metabolomic changes that exist in clinical practice. A further limitation is that although
metabolomics shows potential in the diagnosis of sleep disorders, it cannot replace clinical assessments,
such as polysomnography measurements, to date. One limitation that precludes the application of
metabolomics for diagnosis is that there is a lack of normative values of metabolite concentrations [99].
A further aspect is that the metabolic proﬁle can be considerably aﬀected by various variables, such as

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 7244

11 of 16

gender, nutrition, medical comorbidities or medication, as well as diurnal variations, which require
further research [100]. Furthermore, studies conducted on the most relevant sampling substrates for
identifying biomarkers of mental disorders, brain tissues, have solely been conducted using animal
models as brain-derived samples from humans are commonly only available at autopsy [101]. Although
these animal models are helpful to study causal links between mental disorders and the aﬀected
molecular pathways, they face several limitations, as reviewed recently [102]. A further important
limitation is that studies investigating prognostic utility are missing so far. In general, there has been
only very limited research on speciﬁc treatments’ eﬀects on the metabolome until now. Therefore,
research is needed to elucidate whether metabolomics holds potential to predict treatment responses.
Overall, further studies are needed, examining, for example, the severity and subtypes of sleep-wake
disorders and treatment of patients with sleeping disorders in the context of metabolite levels.

Finally, it can be concluded that metabolomics provides important insights into the metabolic
pathways linked to sleep disorders; however, the usability in clinical practice is limited to date as no
references for normal ranges of metabolites exist.
