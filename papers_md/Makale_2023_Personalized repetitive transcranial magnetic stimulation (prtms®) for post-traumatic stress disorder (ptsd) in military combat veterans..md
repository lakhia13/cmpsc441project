significant clinical improvement accompanied by increased cortical alpha center frequency and

patients. These data support DMN involvement in PTSD pathophysiology and suggest a role in 
therapeutic outcomes. Prospective, sham controlled PrTMS® trials may be warranted to validate 
our  clinical  findings  and  to  examine  the  contribution  of  DMN  targeting  for  novel  preventive, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies tailored to the unique needs of individual patients with both 
combat and non-combat PTSD.   

1. Introduction 

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the fourth most common psychiatric disorder in adults, and it often seriously degrades 
cognitive functioning and emotional stability. About 30% of PTSD patients are still afflicted more than 10 years after diagnosis [1,2]. 
The  situation  with  military  combat  veterans  is  especially  difficult,  with  PTSD  being  highly  prevalent  and  particularly  treatment 
resistant [1–5]. According to the U.S. Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD, 47% of patients undergoing trauma-based psycho-
therapy will fail to achieve remission, while medication alone results in a 58% treatment failure rate [6]. A recent (2021) literature 
review meta-analysis revealed that PTSD treatment dropout rates are high, up to 28.5% in civilians, and reach 38.5% in military 
active-duty personnel and veterans [7–9]. Escalated PTSD therapies include monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which are limited 
by hazardous drug interactions, and electroconvulsive (ECT) therapy, which is an expensive hospital procedure, and can be risky in 
patients with cardiovascular conditions [5,8–11]. Hence, novel PTSD therapies that are efficacious, well tolerated and cost effective 
are in high demand [1,5]. 

PTSD is characterized by reliving the event via intrusive memories, flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance reminders of the trauma 
and the resultant anxious symptomatology disrupting the lives of patients and of their loved ones [12]. To date, most psychophysiology 
[13–15] and functional brain imaging PTSD studies [16,17] have focused on conditioned fear [18,19] underlying enhanced- or un-
successfully extinguished responses to trauma-related cues [20]. However, our recent research [21] also links PTSD with aberrations in 
contextual processing [22,23]. Contextual processing refers to the adaptive way the brain interprets incoming sensory information in 
the context of environment and prior experiences. As such, it involves the processing of multiple sources of information, including 
sensory input, memories, emotions, and salience, to generate a cohesive and meaningful representation of the current situation [24]. 
This activity enables instantaneous and spontaneous decision making in contrast to “slow thinking” [25] i.e., cost/benefit-informed 
deliberate and quantitative cognition aimed at profit maximization [21]. Individuals with PTSD often have difficulty properly inte-
grating sensory information [26–31], leading to autonomic instability, hyperarousal and hypervigilance in response to environmental 
stimuli [12]. By better understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits, researchers may be able to develop more 
effective treatments for PTSD that target its underlying cognitive and neural abnormalities. 

A key brain network involved in contextual processing is the default mode network (DMN), which includes the cingulate cortex, 
medial prefrontal cortex, cuneus/precuneus, and temporoparietal junction/angular gyrus, which become active when an individual is 
not engaged in a specific task or focused on the external world [32–34]. The DMN is involved in the integration of information from 
multiple brain regions and the generation of a coherent sense of self including autobiographical memory, self-referential thought, and 
social cognition. 

Importantly, PTSD is associated with altered DMN function, including increased connectivity within the network and disrupted 
connectivity [23] between the DMN and other brain regions involved in cognitive control [35–38]. Both may be implicated [39] in 
PTSD’s “core component” of implicit memories [40–42] contained within the re-experiencing “B” diagnostic criteria along with the 
automatic [43] “negative alterations in cognitions” [44,45] that are encoded within in “D” diagnostic criteria e.g., negative thoughts 
and assumptions [12]. Furthermore, implicit trauma-related cues [46,47], and irrational [48,49] decision making may worsen PTSD 
symptoms [12] while psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic therapeutic approaches targeting automatic processing [50–52] 
namely, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing [53] or psychedelics [54] seem to exert beneficial effect for PTSD patients. 
Since by its nature spontaneous and automatic cognition is not readily accessible to self-reports [21] inquiry into the DMN’s role in 
the PTSD therapeutic outcomes is limited, in part, by a paucity of robust laboratory-based procedures that may measure real time 
treatment-related adjustments in DMN function. To that end we have developed [55] a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(rTMS) protocol termed personalized-rTMS (PrTMS) which incorporates the key electroencephalographic measure of DMN activity 
[56], the alpha oscillatory rhythm (8–13 Hz). This guides the pursuit of optimal PTSD symptom resolution via: (a) stimulation of 
multiple motor sensory and frontal cortical sites at reduced power, and (b) iterative adjustments of cortical treatment loci and stimulus 
frequency during treatment progression. Stimulation sites and frequencies are identified via a proprietary frequency algorithm and 
computer code (Python; PeakLogic, Inc. San Diego) that quantitatively analyzes the spectral EEG and targets elements of the DMN 
relevant to the alpha oscillatory band [34]. 

If dysregulated alpha oscillation in the DMN creates clinical disturbances, it is reasonable to expect amelioration of these alterations 
via stabilization of alpha activity [57,58]. Hence, alpha band oscillatory frequency may be synchronized and reset via rTMS, which, as 
suggested in a recent meta-analysis, normalizes PTSD symptomatology [59–61]. However, the directionality of the PTSD symptom-
atology response is not entirely consistent [62,63] as rTMS has reportedly induced improvement [64–66], worsening [67] and no 
change [68]. This may be particularly the case for combat Veterans given the high rates of comorbidities [69,70] e.g., traumatic brain 
injury, chronic pain, major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse disorders [69,71–75]. 

For instance, a sham-controlled study with 62 Veterans comparing 1 Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) 
plus cognitive processing therapy (CPT), versus sham rTMS plus CPT [76] reported 4- and 8-point reductions in mean PTSD Checklist 

Heliyon9(2023)e189432M.T. Makale et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     

for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (PCL) scores, respectively, at 4-week and 6-month follow-ups, which were 
statistically significant compared to sham rTMS. In contrast, a multicenter Veterans Administration (VA) study taken to completion on 
125 veterans, showed that active rTMS at 10 Hz to the left DLPFC (L-DLPFC) did not elicit a greater effect than did sham rTMS. The 
PTSD PCL-M score reductions were respectively, 5.2 versus 8.1-points, signifying a placebo effect [5,59]. 

PrTMS  has  not  previously  been  attempted  in  combat-related  PTSD.  The  aim  of  the  present  work  was  to  examine  the  clinical 
outcome effects of PrTMS when added to ongoing therapy in Veterans with combat PTSD. Given the reported beneficial outcomes of 
standard rTMS in combat Veterans [63], we hypothesized that an added EEG guidance component and stimulation of multiple targeted 
cortical sites would lead to superior outcomes. These outcomes were predicted to include reduced PCL-5 scores along with Hamilton 
Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)- and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores, and with a corresponding shift in the spectral 
EEG alpha band peak center frequency to a lower level, and increased cortical alpha peak synchrony according to robust regression 
analysis of the spectral EEG. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Subjects 

Clinical screening, assessment and treatment were done by qualified physicians and medical technicians in an active rTMS medical 
clinic (MindSet, Inc.) located in Del Mar, California. Male and female veterans (n = 300) that had served in a combat zone were initially 
screened for PTSD symptoms using the 33 cutoff PCL-5 score [77]; those with a pre-treatment baseline PCL-5 score <33 were excluded 
[78]. The age range was about 34–75 years with a mean of almost 53 years, and there was approximately a 1:1 ratio of males to 
females. We felt that formal diagnoses were not essential as the  patients were all military combat veterans and a positive PCL-5 
self-report  questionnaire  would  very  likely  signal  the  presence  of  PTSD.  Subsequent  eligibility  screening  included  stable  medica-
tions and psychotherapeutic regimes for at least 8 weeks prior to the enrolment as well as rTMS safety and exclusion criteria [79–81]. 
Accordingly, subjects  were excluded  based  on diagnoses  of a  major  psychiatric  illness other  than PTSD  such as  bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and major depression. Potential patients were disqualified if they had a previous history of psychosis, 
were taking anti-psychotics, had mania, had  bipolar disorder, and if  they had  ferrous metal in the head. Pain and substance use 
disorders were not disqualifying, as ours was a treatment program. All patients were briefed on PrTMS procedures and they provided 
informed medical consent to be treated. Patients continued their standard psychotherapy and/or medication(s) during the course of 
PrTMS treatment. Secondary psychometric outcomes were the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores [82]. 

Fig. 1. Patient PrTMS treatment algorithm and the treatment schedule. Patient EEG recordings were acquired once every week for 4–6 weeks, in 
some cases longer, and the power spectrum derived from the EEG was used to determine what stimulation frequency and what cortical locations 
were treated. Patients received 5 daily treatments each week.

2.1.1. Declarations 

After  the  procedures  were  fully  explained,  all  subjects  gave  written  informed  consent  and  the  protocol  was  approved  by  an 
institutional review board (IRB): WCG IRB Study number 1254094; IRB tracking number 20190239. Patients continued their standard 
psychotherapy and/or medication(s) during the course of PrTMS treatment. 

2.2. Therapeutic protocol 

The study protocol was aligned with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist 
and guidelines [83]. A treatment session was applied daily, 5 days per week typically for 4–6 weeks with a range of 4–22, and one 
subject remained at 80 weeks. (Fig. 1). Clinical personnel evaluated patients daily for adverse events (AEs). These included headache, 
scalp  pain,  cognitive  deficits,  and  seizures.  AEs  also  included  observed  or  self-reported  problems,  complaints,  physical  signs  and 
symptoms, medical conditions occurring during treatment that were not previously present, and previous medical conditions that 
worsened. Adverse event severity was assessed according to the following criteria: mild awareness of discomfort but easily tolerated, 
moderate discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity, severe incapacitating discomfort with the inability to perform 
work or usual activities. 

Presently there is no consensus on what specific cortical site(s) and stimulation frequencies may be required for rTMS treatment of 
PTSD patients [62]. Our PrTMS approach, based on the clinical experience acquired by our lab over the course of years, incorporates 
rTMS guidance via electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis. We deliver frequency specific stimulation of an extensive cortical 
area encompassing discrete motor, sensory, and prefrontal sites [84] while optimally reducing the TMS power without therapeutic loss 
[84,85] by adjusting the anatomical loci and stimulation frequency on a weekly basis as the therapy progresses. 

At the onset of each treatment week patients completed PCL-5, HAM-A and HAM-D questionnaires and EEG. The questionnaire and 
EEG data guided the weekly adjustments of PrTMS stimulus’ frequencies and cortical treatment sites. EEG recordings were acquired 
before PrTMS and at the beginning of each week as long as PrTMS continued, usually over approximately 6 weeks or up to 28 daily 
weekday treatment sessions, excluding weekends. The total number of sessions aligns with a previous report of rTMS in veterans with 
PTSD, and exceeds the average number of rTMS sessions, 16 (range:10–40), for 9 other PTSD studies [5,62]. The EEG was recorded 
from awake, eyes closed, seated subjects using a 19-lead high impedance dry electrode EEG headset (Cognionics [CGX] Inc., San Diego 
CA). Neuronavigation was not used, rather the locations were determined by the EEG data from each electrode arranged according to 
the standard 10–20 system. The power spectra from each electrode were analyzed, and those locations that exhibited an alpha center 
frequency that deviated from the subject’s intrinsic alpha center frequency were stimulated at the intrinsic frequency. The intrinsic 
frequency was identified from the alpha center frequency of the occipital electrodes, since visual cortical frequency tends to be pre-
served, even with psychopathology. 

Following stimulus frequency selection, treatment was delivered by a trained rTMS technician using a MagVenture MagPro R30 
transcranial stimulator and B-65 head transducer. Patients were seated in a quiet room with their eyes closed and without sedation. 
The selected magnetic field intensity was comparatively reduced and was gradually increased over the course of treatment (Fig. 1). 
Stimulation intensity was 25–60% of the resting motor threshold in most patients, and the stimulus frequency range was 8–13 Hz, with 
magnetic pulses delivered in 10–15 s trains. Intertrain intervals began at 30 s, and gradually decreased to 10 s. During each treatment 
session, which lasted about 40 min, the motor-sensory strip and subsequent prefrontal and frontal regions were treated in succession. 
The EEG was recorded from awake, eyes closed, seated subjects using a 19-lead high impedance dry electrode EEG headset (Cognionics 
[CGX] Inc., San Diego CA). For spectral variables, the frontal cortical region included EEG leads FP1 to F8, cortical region 2 was central 
and contained leads Cz to T4, cortical region 3 was parietal and contained leads Pz to P4, and cortical region 4 was occipital and 
contained leads P7 to O2. 

EEG data pre-processing included visual inspection and removal of distinctly erratic and technically flawed recordings identified by 
experienced technicians who were ‘blind’ to the study design and hypotheses. In line with established procedures, filtering, and se-
lective removal of EEG recordings (if any) was avoided as much as possible [86]. A 4-min EEG time epoch was transformed via Welch’s 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) employing a custom Python program, to produce a power spectrum with 0.1 Hz resolution; the spectral 
frequency band was restricted to between 2 and 20 Hz in the power spectrum. The extracted alpha band (8–13 Hz) power spectrum 
used in subsequent analyses is devoid of low frequency artifacts obviating the necessity of filtering with consequent potential for bias. 
A proprietary spectral EEG analysis algorithm (PeakLogic, Inc. San Diego) identified an initial stimulation frequency in the alpha band, 
and continually adjusted this frequency as a function of the change in objective alpha wave characteristics, according to successive EEG 
power spectral acquisitions, and clinical response, as measured by the psychometric questionnaires. The power spectral amplitude 
center frequency in the alpha band between 8 and 13 Hz was determined weekly for each PCL-5 PrTMS responder and each nonre-
sponder (see Results section below), for each EEG electrode. 

2.3. Data processing 

2.3.1. Symptom data 

The primary PrTMS efficacy endpoint was the reduction in symptoms measured by the DSM-5 PCL-5 total score, acquired weekly 
from baseline (pretreatment) to week 4, week 6 and to final treatment. Treatment efficacy was defined as a statistically significant 
reduction  in  mean  PCL-5  total  score  compared  to  baseline.  Observed  (raw)  and  change  from  baseline  (CFB)  PCL-5  scores  were 
summarized in terms of the number of non-missing observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range by time point. 
The following hypotheses on the mean CFB data were tested for the fourth- and last treatment time points using a t-test at a two- 

Heliyon9(2023)e189434M.T. Makale et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     

sided α = 0.05 level of significance: H0: μcfb = 0 vs. H1: μcfb ∕= 0. For PCL-5 changes the mean CFB data were tested using a t-test at a 
two-sided α = 0.05 level of significance: H0: μcfb = 0 vs. H1: μcfb ∕= 0. The null hypothesis would be rejected in favor of the alternative 
at the two-sided p-value <0.05. 

The number of patients exceeding the change thresholds induced by PrTMS, as measured with the PCL-5, was compared retro-
spectively to the corresponding numbers to our prior active and sham rTMS study [66] employing DSM-IV PCL-Military (PCL-M). 
Notably, PCL-5 is based on the DSM-5 symptoms, and it is distinct from PCL-M. While both utilize the same Likert type rating scale 
descriptors, and exhibit continuity, the number of questions differs, 20 versus 17 respectively, and the rating scales for each question 
are different rendering the scales incompatible for interchangeable use [87]. Nonetheless, the VA Center for PTSD recommends, based 
on statistical validation, the same score change thresholds and ranges to assess the treatment progress. Specifically, 5 points change 
denotes a reliable treatment response, not due to a chance, whereas 10-point change is considered to be clinically meaningful [88] for 
both tools [89]. 

The HAM-A and HAM-D score changes with PrTMS were analyzed with a paired two-sided parametric t-test which compared the 
prior to treatment values to those acquired at 6-week timepoint. The null hypothesis was that the mean HAM-A/HAM-B pretreatment 
score was equal to the mean HAM-A/HAM-B score at six weeks, and the significance threshold was p < 0.05. For the HAM-A a score of 
8–14 indicates mild anxiety, 15–23 indicates moderate anxiety, and greater than 24 indicates severe anxiety [90]. A HAM-D score of 
0–7 is considered normal, 8–16 suggests mild depression, 17–23 is moderate depression, and scores over 24 indicate severe depression 
[91]. 

The  dominant  alpha  peak  (center)  frequency  was  determined  for  all  EEG  leads,  averaged  for  each  cortical  region,  and  a 
nonparametric binomial distribution sign test compared binned data before and after PrTMs. The amplitude of the alpha band (8–13 
Hz) spectral center frequency was identified for each EEG lead up to 6 weeks of treatment, yielding 728,688 and 101,802 data points 
for responders and nonresponders, respectively. For each week, and for each patient the peak amplitudes for all the frontal electrodes, 
and also for the entire brain cortex, were averaged for all responders and nonresponders. The alpha band (8–13 Hz) center peak full 
width half max (FWHM) was analyzed with a custom Python program, utilizing scipy.signal and scipy.stat modules. The 1/f aperiodic 
spectral component was determined by averaging the 2–20 Hz power spectrum amplitude from the 7 leads in the frontal cortex, 
plotting log power versus log frequency, and then calculating the robust regression line which treated periodic oscillatory components 
as outliers [92–95]. 

3. Results 

3.1. Attrition 

Out  of  the  screened  cohort,  195  subjects  had  PCL-5  scores  of  33  or  greater  warranting  the  PTSD  diagnosis  [77].  All  subjects 
tolerated the application of rTMS to multiple cortical sites well and reported only occasional mild and transient discomfort (if any), and 
no serious adverse events such as seizures, and there were no effects that needed treatment. This favorable tolerability profile may be 
attributable to relatively lower magnetic field strengths utilized in the present study. To ascertain a meaningful effect size, the a priori 
focus was placed on the 4 – 6-week period analyses, since by 27 treatments the dropout rate was substantial, 31%, 60 patients left the 
study, and at week 22 the dropout rate was 92%, 180 patients left the study, and only one patient remained at week 80. 

3.2. Psychometrics 

The mean baseline (pre-treatment) PCL-5 score was 53.3 ± SD = 11.46; median = 52 (Tables 1 and 2). Subjects showed significant 
reductions  in  PTSD  symptomatology  after  5  treatments,  by  the  week  2  timepoint.  The  mean  CFB  at  each  treatment  timepoint  is 
depicted in Fig. 2a, plotted with least squares confidence limits. The mean CFB was statistically significant at the 4- and 6-week time 
points (p < 0.0001 each; Tables 1 and 2). Mean peak reduction in PCL-5 score was 20.6 points at the week 4 timepoint, to a mean score 
of 32.7 (p < 0.0001). Thus, by week 4 in over half of the subjects (n = 96) the PCL-5 score was below the PTSD diagnostic threshold 
(Table 1). Subjects continued to show improvement over time, and their improvement was almost entirely complete at week 4, albeit at 
a plateauing rate (Fig. 2a and b). As indicated in Table 2, the mean score for the entire treatment period beyond the 6-week timepoint 
was 28.8 ± 18.77, a mean reduction of 24.5 PCL-5 points.

treatment number. After 28 treatments patients dropped out sporadically so that too few patients remained per time point. Only treatment points 
with 10 patients or more are included. The graph indicates up to 27 treatments or almost about 6 weeks. b) Percentage of patients with no clinical 
improvement according to PCL-5 score, versus the number of PrTMS sessions (treatments). The log-log plot chronicles progress over 27 sessions or

dotted line denotes the moving average and its slope becomes horizontal at about 5 weeks (arrow), and no tangible improvement was seen after 
approximately 4 weeks.

Heliyon9(2023)e189436M.T. Makale et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     

In the present project, responders (85%) and non-responders (15%) were defined based on the VA Center for PTSD criteria [89] i.e., 
respective presence or absence of a greater than a 5-point PCL-5 score drop after PrTMS (Table 3). Sustained improvement starting at 
Week 1 after the conclusion of the fifth treatment was reflected in the corresponding percentage of subjects’ improvement throughout 
the entire study (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows that the percentage of patients exhibiting PCL-5 score improvement did not change appreciably 
after the 5th treatment, suggesting that the plateau after 5 weeks seen in Fig. 2a may represent those patients that had not responded to 
therapy. Fig. 3 shows HAM-A and HAM-D scores for the responders and non-responders. Given the heightened prevalence of anxiety 
and depressive symptomatology in PTSD patients [96], as expected, in responders the scores dropped to clinically negligible values 
whereas in non-responders these scores remained at the same heightened level throughout the entire study. 

3.3. PrTMS vs. standard rTMS in VA study: outcome of active and sham treatment 

In our prior multi-center VA study with rTMS, depression, and PTSD in veterans, standard rTMS was used to stimulate one pre-
frontal cortical site using a common pulse frequency [5]. Active rTMS vs. sham rTMS [5] produced a greater than 5-point reduction in 
the PCL-M score in, respectively, 47.9% and 31.9% of subjects, and a greater than 10 PCL-M point decline in 33.8% and 27.5% of 
subjects, respectively (Fig. 2c). In contrast, about 79% of subjects in the present study had greater than a clinically significant 10-point 
drop in the score (Fig. 2c). The difference between the subjects here and subjects in the previous study [5] was highly significant (p <
0.0001), for both the 5 point and a 10-point PCL score declines. Moreover, the mean 20.6 point 4-week peak change score for all the 
subjects reported herein substantially exceeded the beneficial outcomes of the VA study which may have been partially attributable to 
placebo effects [5]. Regardless of the genesis of the 5–10 PCL-M point mean score decrease in the VA study [5], the substantially 
greater magnitude of the response observed in the current work (24.5 points) renders placebo an unlikely sole cause underlying the 
therapeutic outcome reported for the present study [5]. Fig. 3 shows anxiety (HAM-A) and depression (HAM-D) scores for those 
subjects that responded or did not respond to PrTMS in terms of PCL-5 scores. Initially, mean depression and anxiety scores were in the 
’severe’  category, and those subjects that showed a PrTMS induced PCL-5 score decline of greater than 5 points with PrTMS had 
HAM-A and HAM-D scores fall to moderate levels. In the PCL-5 nonresponder group both the HAM-A and the HAM-D scores did not 
change significantly. 

3.4. Spectral EEG findings 

3.4.1. Alpha band power and center frequency shift 

The  alpha  band  oscillatory  peak  center frequency  shifted  to  lower  frequencies  for  the  cortex  overall  in  PrTMS  responders.  In 
contrast, non-responders did not exhibit an alpha band frequency shift, as illustrated by the frequency versus number of treatment 
sessions graph in Fig. 4a. Weekly PrTMS peak alpha frequencies differed significantly (repeated measures ANOVA p = 0.0143; paired t- 
test p = 0.035) between responders and nonresponders. This decline in alpha center frequency in responders is consistent with the 
possibility of a PrTMS associated improvement of DMN connectivity [97]. 

Fig. 4b depicts the center frequency for each brain region, frontal, medial, parietal, and occipital, along with the change in PCL-5 
score for each treatment week according to session, relative to baseline, in responders, over the course of treatment. Initially there is 
correspondence between the frontal cortex frequency low with the first PCL-5 score nadir, for all subjects, and although the frontal 
region lags, its alpha center frequency is lowered by 26 treatments as is the PCL-5 score. The PCL-5 score low points for medial, parietal 
and occipital regions correspond to alpha center frequency lows, and frequency is also reduced by 5–6 weeks. Fig. 4c is a cortical 
schematic color scale representation of binned alpha band center frequency superimposed on an outline of the cortex, for each frontal 
EEG lead in PrTMS responders and nonresponders. In Fig. 4c panel A, the average frontal pretreatment variability and center frequency 
was greater for non-responders. After PrTMS Fig. 4c, panel B indicates that for responders the alpha center frequency became more 
uniform, and showed the expected, normal left right hemispheric difference. The degree of change after PrTMS in terms of frequency 
bins is shown in Fig. 4c, panel C for each EEG electrode. A nonparametric binomial distribution sign test using the binned data 
indicated that responder peak frequencies (n = 116) differed before and after PrTMS (p = 0.034) but this was not the case for non-
responders (p = 0.153, n = 19). 

3.4.2. Alpha band center frequency uniformity 

In responders, the alpha band center frequency declined after PrTMS and was characterized by greater synchrony in the frontal 
cortex  (Fig.  4c).  Non-responders  had  a  more  irregular  center  frequency  pattern  between  individual  EEG  leads,  and  higher  alpha 
frequencies in the frontal cortex compared to responders, consistent with poorer DMN functioning. Comparison of mean amplitudes 
between EEG electrodes in the alpha band (8–13 Hz) showed that for the frontal cortex, and the entire brain the mean amplitude was 
increased and differed significantly before versus after PrTMS (P < 0.0001). This is shown in Fig. 5a for responders (728,688 data

respond to PrTMS in terms of PCL-5 score reduction of >5 points. The scale on the left indicates approximate severity level, and there is overlap 
between the HAM-A and Ham-D in this context. PrTMS in responders (n = 116) was associated with highly significant anxiety and score reductions

points),  and  5b  for  responders  and  nonresponders  (101,802  data  points).  After  PrTMS  nonresponders  exhibited  lower  frontal 
amplitude than did responders, but for nonresponders the entire cortex apparently was substantially elevated in terms of amplitude, 
compared to responders (Fig. 5b). It may noteworthy that for nonresponders the differential between the frontal cortex and the whole 
cortex increased markedly after PrTMS, and if real, this may indicate an impaired connectivity and lack of coordination between the 
frontal cortical region and the rest of the brain. 

3.4.3. Alpha band narrowing 

The alpha oscillatory peak assumes a generally Gaussian shape, and this feature in responders narrowed, or ‘sharpened’, after 
PrTMS  treatment,  a  commonly  observed  phenomenon  in  alpha  band  neurophysiology  [98].  Fig. 6a  illustrates schematically  how 
standard full width half-max (FWHM) measurement was applied to the alpha peak in a subset of patients. The reduction in the alpha 
peak FWHM after PrTMS, for each EEG lead, is depicted in Fig. 6b and c for responders and nonresponders, respectively. This change in 
responders may reflect increased alpha band firing synchrony of different neuronal clusters. Alternatively, PrTMS may have decreased 
the level of damping of alpha oscillators, which sharpened the alpha peak [98,99]. Regardless of the exact mechanism, PrTMS could 
have altered the activity of cortical and subcortical alpha oscillators, and cortical synchrony seemed to have been enhanced. The 
reduction in FWHM was substantially greater than that observed for non-responders (Repeated measures ANOVA (p < 0.0001) and 
paired test (p < 0.0001). In future studies it would be interesting to determine whether non-responders differ in terms of drug taking, 
overeating, gambling, and other addictive behaviors. 

The EEG power spectrum 1/f aperiodic component is a measure of the synchronicity of spiking between cortical neuronal pop-
ulations, it is also reflective of cognitive and perceptual states, excitatory versus inhibitory balance, and it is regarded as a potential 
biomarker of disease such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia [92,95,100]. The aperiodic component 
was calculated for both PrTMS responders and nonresponders [92]. The aperiodic component for responders is shown in the log-log 
EEG spectral plot generated by robust regression in Fig. 7a, for the frontal cortex [92,95]. Clearly the aperiodic regression slope 
became steeper after PrTMS, and aperiodic amplitude, or power, declined. This suggests that cortical neuronal population spiking 
became more synchronous which is presumed to enhance signaling efficiency, and a shift towards greater inhibition [95,100,101]. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first such demonstration, as the characterization of the 1/f aperiodic component and its treatment 
related modulation has not been previously reported for PTSD. 

In  nonresponders  the  aperiodic  component  increased  during  4  weeks  of  treatment,  as  indicated  by  flattening  of  the  robust 
regression line in Fig. 7b. The mechanistic substrate for this is not clear but may have involved lowered firing synchrony of neuronal 
clusters and/or a shift in the relative dominance of specific neurotransmitters and excitatory versus inhibitory signaling pathways. This 
finding implies that for nonresponders cortical areas may have been activated by rTMS but there was no improvement in terms of 
coordinated activity and reduced hyper arousal [95]. Moreover, it is interesting that in nonresponders the 1/f slope decreased, i.e., the 
regression was flatter, indicating comparative excitation, and the cortical power spectrum amplitude shown in Fig. 6b was elevated 
well above that for responders (p < 0.0001). 

4. Discussion 

This report describes the results obtained in veterans with combat PTSD using a dynamic and personalized form of rTMS that we 
refer to as PrTMS, based on subject specific continual updating of stimulation frequency, location, and pattern, guided by serial EEG 
power spectra and neurocognitive exams. This methodology facilitated a substantial decline in PTSD, anxiety, and depression scores, 
and induced non-subjective EEG spectral effects with potential biomarker and mechanistic significance. 

PrTMS was administered because combat PTSD is often resistant to cognitive and pharmacological interventions. The patients were 
treated whenever they decided to come to the clinic, and very few patients remained after week six, as the dropout rate was high. For

the sake of completeness we mentioned these patients. For statistical validity we elected to present and analyze data that had at least 
ten patients per time point, and such data extended to 27 treatments, almost six weeks, but not beyond. Fig. 2B shows that after 4 weeks 
of PrTMS there was no further improvement in PCL-5 scores, and the subsequent plateau represents treatment resistant patients. If 
patients respond they will likely do so during the first few weeks, so in future prospective studies a 4–6 week timeframe should be used. 
In Fig. 2b the percent not showing improvement after four weeks is about 17% which corresponds almost exactly to the percentage of 
patients with less than 5% PCL-5 improvement, i.e., no treatment response, with PrTMS. Interestingly, a recent (2022) retrospective 
literature meta-analysis of rTMS in depression indicated that a 4–6 week treatment duration yields tangible results, and Carpenter and 
co-workers (2017) reported that significant antidepressant effects were obtained after 4 weeks of rTMS [102,103]. 

The results  acquired here  support our  primary  objectives, which  included lowering  the  mean  PTSD  PCL-5 score to  below  the 
diagnostic threshold of 33, and reducing the spectral EEG alpha band peak center frequency. Secondary endpoints were also attained, 
including lowering severe depression and anxiety scores to a mild to moderate range, and the identification of spectral EEG correlates 
of important frontal cortical neurophysiological PrTMS effects e.g., greater EEG alpha band peak amplitude, narrowing of alpha band 
peak width, and for the first time in PTSD, a steepening of the spectral 1/f

aperiodic component.

The  Hollywood  blockbuster,  “The  Hurt  Locker,”  powerfully  highlighted  the  psychological  dilemmas  that  are  so  disabling  for 
combat veterans. Despite their chronically fearful states during combat, many veterans upon their return to civilian life despair of 
never being able to find meaning and perceive contextual subtleties in normal existence against the backdrop of the intense stimulation 
they felt during combat. These Veterans often see civilian life as bland, stressful, and unfulfilling and describe themselves as “numb.” 
They may turn to drugs or alcohol as a means of overcoming this stress and numbing and recreating the highs they felt while in combat.

Improved DMN connectivity and functionality attained via PrTMS [104] may help patients reprocess traumatic memories and develop 
new cognitive strategies for reframing and responding to stressful situations [21] and for confronting and recontextualizing traumatic 
memories and emotions in a safe therapeutic environment [105]. 

It has previously been suggested that EEG based systems for guiding the placement of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
could lead to more accurate targeting of brain regions, which may improve the effectiveness of TMS for treating neurological and 
psychiatric  conditions  [106].  In  fact,  in  a  sham-controlled  study,  EEG  analysis  identified  the  optimal  target  region  to  guide  the 
placement of the TMS leading to more effective stimulation and a greater reduction in symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), 
which is a common co-morbidity in combat veterans with PTSD [64,107]. Moreover, resting EEG measures were used to differentiate 
between rTMS responders and non-responders, highlighting the heuristic value of the EEG for predicting rTMS outcomes [108]. In a 
similar fashion, the EEG has been reported to differentiate rTMS responders and non-responders among patients with severe brain 
damage that are unable to show meaningful or consistent behavioral responses to their environment [109]. This further suggests that 
EEG after-treatment effects may likewise be a useful tool for predicting rTMS treatment response [110]. The present study further 
substantiates the potential value of the EEG in guiding and predicting rTMS efficacy, and extends previously reported finding by 
suggesting that the beneficial effect may generalize to trauma and stressor-related neuropsychiatric disorders e.g., PTSD. 

Significant rTMS-induced improvement in PCL-5 symptomatology is in accordance with an earlier study applying theta burst rTMS 
[111] and demonstrating EEG based discrimination of active versus sham-treated patients [112]. Although there were methodological 
similarities between the latter [111] and the current study, e.g., enrollment of veterans and rTMS combined with EEG measures, there 
were also important differences, including the rTMS protocol, application to combat veterans, and the focus on EEG-guided placement 
of the magnetic coil. Thus, our independent replication supports the potential of EEG-guided rTMS as an efficacious therapy for PTSD. 
Much remains to be learned about the pathophysiology of PTSD, and treatment resistance surely results from a poorly understood 
and  complex  natural  history  characterized  by  progressively  dysregulated  interactions  between  multiple  brain  signaling  hubs. 
Importantly however, there is emerging evidence that PTSD involves dysrhythmia of the DMN elements in the alpha oscillatory band 
[113]. This has prompted increasing speculation that PTSD may be initiated and sustained by a loss of brain oscillatory synchronicity 
and connectivity that in health is supported by the alpha rhythm [26,114–116]. In the foregoing context, rTMS could prove useful 
partly because it is likely orthogonal to current therapies, and because it may engage a basal cause of PTSD by resetting an ensemble of 
disrupted thalamocortical alpha frequency generators to stabilize the DMN [60,61,114,117]. Entrainment of thalamocortical oscil-
lators is held to be a major effect of rTMS, and several reports have addressed the relationship between alpha frequency and rTMS 
[118–120]. The premise for a therapeutic effect created by rTMS may be that alpha band cortical oscillations facilitate coordination

responders as the regression line fell more steeply to the right (paired t-test pre vs. post p < 0.0001). The robust regression slopes (∝) for responders 
before and after PrTMS were (cid:0) 0.61 and (cid:0) 0.95, respectively.

respectively. The steeper regression line after PrTMS in responders suggested that cortical oscillatory synchrony increased and possibly inhibitory 
GABA activity also increased, while the opposite appeared to have occurred in nonresponders. 

between discrete, distributed brain areas at rest and during task coping activities and there is an optimal frequency that is modulated 
by various factors and brain states [26,61,84] that may be altered in neuropsychiatric disorders such as PTSD. 

Our PrTMS methodology aligns with observations made by others, albeit in a modified way, in two key respects: (1) Stimulation of 
a  comparatively  greater  cortical  area  to  enhance  synchronicity  [84]  by  incorporating  frequency-specific  stimulation  of  multiple 
discrete motor sensory and prefrontal cortical sites and (2) Adjustments of cortical stimulus locations and stimulation frequency, on a 
weekly basis, as therapy progressed. We followed this paradigm and reduced TMS power to avoid overstimulation, which conceptually 
aligned with the recent report [85] that rTMS could synchronize the cortical alpha frequency band at 80% of resting motor threshold 
(MT), which is roughly half the lowest conventional rTMS field strength [84,85]. Here we safely expanded the number of pre-frontal, 
frontal, and motor sensory cortical regions that were stimulated, by reducing machine power to 20–60%. 

Continuous updating of stimulation frequency throughout treatment aligns with the view [121] that the alpha peak frequency has 
multiple cortical sources. From this perspective, the dominant alpha frequency may be a dynamic, changing set-point driven by time 
varying neurophysiology, rather than remaining static and being fixed solely by thalamic inputs to the cortex [121]. The growing body 
of evidence certainly adds credence to regulation of alpha frequency by the cortical systems and that state dependent changes may 
occur via external triggering, such as with rTMS, with important functional and therapeutic ramifications [122]. 

Hence, with PrTMS, it is the cortical response to successive lower amplitude stimulation, both in terms of objective alpha waveform 
data and serial neurocognitive exams that dictates further stimulation frequency selection. The frequency target moves over the course 
of the patient’s treatment and thus requires continuous EEG power spectrum monitoring. This procedure in our patients was associated 
with a decline in the alpha peak center frequency, greater cortical synchrony, a narrower alpha band peak (FWHM), increased alpha 
amplitude in the frontal cortex, and a reduced 1/f aperiodic alpha band spectral component. These neurophysiological correlates may 
align with increased synchrony of neuronal population spiking, and less damping of alpha oscillators, and may have resulted in the 
amplitude increase caused by PrTMS. Importantly, for PTSD the 1/f aperiodic component has not been previously characterized and its 
reduction observed here may reflect beneficial changes in homeostatic brain signaling pathways [95]. 

A limitation of the study is the open label design. The placebo effect with TMS stems from patients’ expectations and the attention 
they  receive  during  treatment.  The  direction  of  bias  is  typically  positive,  with  patients  experiencing  improved  neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. A further constraint is that the comparison to our team’s previous VA standard rTMS study is limited, although that initial 
work was a systematic foray into the use of rTMS methodology for PTSD in combat veterans. Moreover, combat veterans completed 
self-report questionnaires for PTSD and depression, a reasonable approach, but we did not conduct formal interviews and diagnostic 
procedures. We also note that the magnitude of the PTSD score reductions we obtained are typically much greater that those observed 
in the placebo arm of previously reported studies, we obtained non-subjective spectral EEG changes in a relatively sizable group of

participants, and we identified clearly contrasting PrTMS responders and nonresponders. The data presented here do show that the 
primary aims of this work were realized; (1) that PrTMS is safe, and (2) that further prospective studies of PrTMS are warranted and our 
findings should be brought to the attention of relevant clinical and research communities. Nevertheless, the results reported here 
should be deemed preliminary pending replication in future prospective sham-controlled studies. 

In conclusion, this manuscript describes positive outcomes in combat PTSD achieved via PrTMS treatment. This demonstrates the 
utility of spectral EEG analysis for the identification of specific brain systems such as the DMN that are affected, and therefore require 
restorative stimulation. Personalized medicine involves the optimal matching of proper tests to clinically eligible patients, and the 
exposition  of  individual  EEG  rTMS  responses  may  be  an  important  intermediary  allowing  for  a  more  targeted  and  personalized 
treatment. Moreover, EEG-guided PrTMS may allow for the use of lower stimulation intensities and shorter treatment durations, which 
could further reduce the already low risk of seizures and other adverse effects associated with rTMS. While daily PrTMS treatments for 
6 weeks or more represents a time burden, we believe that the potential to safely overcome treatment resistant PTSD justifies the time 
investment. Overall, our preliminary data suggests that EEG-guided PrTMS holds promise for individualized medicine as it has the 
potential to optimize treatment efficacy, reduce the risk of adverse effects, and improve patient outcomes for PTSD and possibly for 
multiple neuropsychiatric disorders.
