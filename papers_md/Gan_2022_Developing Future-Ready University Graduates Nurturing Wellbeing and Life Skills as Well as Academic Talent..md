Higher education is starting to embrace its role in promoting student wellbeing and life
skills, especially given the concerning levels of poor mental health and uncertainties
in the future job market. Yet, many of
the published studies evaluating positive
educational teaching methods thus far are limited to interventions delivered to small
student cohorts and/or imbedded within elective wellbeing courses, and are focussed
on developed Western countries. This study addressed this gap by investigating the
effectiveness of an institution-wide compulsory course informed by the principles of
Seligman’s Wellbeing Theory. The course was delivered at a British university in a
developing country in Southeast Asia. It purposefully sought to nurture growth-oriented
outcomes (including self-awareness, positive emotions, and personal effectiveness)
and was taken by an entire cohort of year one undergraduate students. We tested
the effectiveness of the curriculum content and staff coaching style in achieving life
skills, and evaluated how these perceptions inﬂuenced students’ subjective wellbeing.
A convergent mixed-methods design was used with 350 survey respondents and
11 interviewees. Perceived life skills scores showed a 2.5% improvement at the
end of the course. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling tested the
predicted relationships between variables. All relationships were statistically signiﬁcant,
but
the inﬂuence of course design and educators’ style on life skills acquisition
(50.8% of the variance) was moderate, while the effect on subjective happiness and
life satisfaction (4–5% of the variance) was very weak. Qualitative data indicated
that while quantiﬁable beneﬁts to wellbeing might not be immediate, students did
anticipate longer-term beneﬁts for happiness and life satisfaction. This ﬁnding suggests
that such a novel educational approach is well-received by Asian students and may
sow the seeds for future beneﬁt by positively impacting on their skills, behaviours,
attitudes, and values. To achieve optimal ﬂourishing at university, we recommend
exploring teaching practises that combine positive education with coaching psychology
practises.

Developing Future-Ready University Graduates

INTRODUCTION

has

accelerated

The COVID-19
a
transformation in the skills required by today’s workforce,
as well as in the need for adaptability to change. Research by
the McKinsey Global Institute identiﬁed self-leadership and
inter-personal skills as two of the four skills categories essential
to future-proof those graduates emerging into the job market
(Dondi et al., 2021); the others being cognitive and digital skills.
McKinsey’s deﬁnition of self-leadership comprises elements of
wellbeing (e.g., optimism, grit, and coping with uncertainty) and
life skills (e.g., understanding one’s strengths, driving change and
achievement orientation). A wake-up call to university educators
from this report was the conclusion that higher education is
failing to eﬀectively develop graduates with proﬁciency in self-
leadership skills, despite these skills being most closely associated
with employment, income, and job satisfaction.

Relevant to the teaching of self-leadership is the branch of
psychological theory and practise known as Positive Psychology;
the science of wellbeing and ﬂourishing (e.g., Seligman, 2011;
Wong and Roy, 2017; Lomas et al., 2020). For the past 10
years or so, a number of positive psychologists have advocated
in addition to
teaching students wellbeing and life skills,
traditional academic skills (c.f. Positive Education; Seligman
et al., 2009). The goal of this positive education approach is
to improve students’ wellbeing and learning through activities
that explicitly promote components of wellbeing. Seligman’s
Wellbeing Theory underlies one of the most common approaches
by teaching positive emotion, engagement (i.e., being in the
ﬂow), positive relationships, meaning (i.e., purpose in life),
and achievement (Seligman, 2011). While there are numerous
examples of positive education in schools (e.g., Norrish et al.,
2013), positive education has had fewer
in the
higher education setting despite universities being entrusted to
prepare generations of youths for a better future. There are a
growing number of case studies. For example, at Melbourne
University Centre for Positive Psychology, Australia, a 6-
week University Wellbeing Programme for undergraduates in a
Positive Psychology course led to improvements in mental health
and seemed to buﬀer against stress, relative to a control group
(Young et al., 2020). In the United Kingdom, an optional 12-
week psychoeducational happiness course for undergraduates at
the University of Bristol improved student mental wellbeing, even
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Hood et al., 2021). However,
of those studies conducted at university, many are limited
to evaluating interventions delivered to small student cohorts
and/or imbedded within elective wellbeing courses. Hence, their
generalisability is somewhat reduced.

inroads

A number of speciﬁc challenges in implementing positive
education principles within the general university curriculum
have been recognised (e.g., King et al., 2016). The university
environment
itself may provide one such tension. Positive
education requires a cultural shift away from the university as
an institution of knowledge production and teaching delivery,
toward one of fostering self-discovery and personal growth.
To achieve those goals requires a coaching style that nurtures
student potential and talent. Yet, the traditional university system
emphasises one-way communication from teacher to student and

independent learning (Simel and Bognar, 2017). Here, leadership
from the senior management is needed to push the organisation
and its staﬀ in the right direction.

One challenge coming from within the positive education
ﬁeld itself concerns the geographical bias in research outputs
toward Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic
(WEIRD) countries. The reasons for this are complex (e.g.,
Wong, 2020). Nevertheless, this paucity of research is especially
awkward given that culture is well-known to play a key role
in wellbeing and learning. For example, a study of Singaporean
secondary school students found that, unlike their Western
counterparts, they were equally strongly motivated to study by
external factors (e.g., the need to show parents that they are
achieving) as well as intrinsic factors (e.g., personal satisfaction
and an inherent desire to learn) (Caleon et al., 2015). The authors
reasoned that this ﬁnding reﬂects those cultural traditions which
put primacy on learning as a means for social mobility and
economic survival; a characteristic that is shared by many
developing countries in Asia.

Important questions therefore remain whether wellbeing
and life skills can be attained in a university culture that
embraces positive education across the whole institution and that
attempts to oﬀer a coaching style of teaching, and whether a
curriculum informed by a WEIRD-centric conceptual framework
for wellbeing can have impact in the setting of a developing
Asian country. Since 2018, Heriot-Watt University Malaysia
has oﬀered students a transformative educational experience
through its compulsory year one ‘EmPOWER’ programme.
This coaching programme supports self-discovery and personal
growth, accentuates purpose and oﬀers opportunities to achieve
a positive impact on the community and society, with
achievements being explicitly articulated to future employers
through an enhanced transcript.

The Current Study
The purpose of this study was to evaluate this programme
using a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, gathering
quantitative online survey and qualitative interview data. We
tested the hypotheses that
the course would improve
(i)
students’ wellbeing in accordance with Wellbeing Theory, (ii)
the course would improve students’ life skills (namely sense of
purpose, self-reﬂection, self-awareness, leadership, inter-personal
communication and positive emotions), in line with the intended
positive education learning outcomes, (iii) that the course design
and educator style would each positively inﬂuence students’
learning of those life skills, and (iv) that achievement in life skills
would in turn drive greater wellbeing as measured by subjective
happiness and life satisfaction. The purpose of the interview data
was to give greater insight into how the positive education course
inﬂuenced students’ perceptions of their learning.

to take part in the study if their overall attendance was at least
80%. Survey data was pseudo-anonymised to enable matching
responses to attendance records, and was fully anonymised
through attribute suppression before data analysis. Although 407
students completed the survey, 57 were excluded because they
did not meet the eligibility criterion regarding attendance: leaving
350 survey respondents at T3. From these, 104 did not complete
the SHS and SWLS at T2. Analysis of the changes over time
handled these missing data using a pairwise deletion method
(n = 246).

Survey respondents were invited to volunteer for a short
follow-up interview at T3 (n = 11). A total of 14 interviews were
conducted, but data from three participants (participants 02, 06,
and 14) were later removed due to technical diﬃculties with
the recording which rendered a fair transcription impossible.
No information about gender was collected for the quantitative
survey data, since this was not deemed relevant to the hypotheses.
For the qualitative interview,
the 11 included participants
were six male and 5 female students enrolled in a variety of
programmes (Psychology, Finance and accounting, Business,
Actuarial science, and Engineering).

Instruments
Prior to data analysis, a structural model was constructed from
a review of the published literature, indicating the latent and
measured variables, and their causal relationships (Figure 1).
The central part of the structural model is founded on the
premise that the eﬀectiveness by which a student achieves life
skills as measured by the positive education learning outcomes,
are determined by an interplay between factors, which can
be classiﬁed primarily as the course design and educator style
(McKone, 1999; Eom and Ashill, 2016). In the context of

the higher education setting, we predict that the degree to
which a student perceives that (s)he has achieved these life
skills may in turn inﬂuence their emotional state and sense of
optimal wellbeing (Seligman et al., 2009) which we operationalise
within the structural model as happiness and life satisfaction,
respectively. The full measurement model is shown in Figure 1.
It is a reﬂective measurement model since the indicators of each
construct are considered to be caused by the construct itself and
the items are interchangeable.

The ﬁve latent variables are shown in Figure 1 (measurement
scales are reported in Supplementary Table 1). Course design
was measured using a set of nine tailor-made statements
which asked about
learning objectives
the content (C1-3),
(C4), structure (C5), level of enjoyment (C6), and assessment
(C7-9). Educator style was measured using another set of
nine tailor-made statements which asked about educator’s
personal characteristics and attitudes (E1, E4-5), feedback (E2-3),
knowledge (E6-7), and inter-personal skills (E8-9). Life skills were
measured using a set of bespoke statements that were directly
informed by the course learning objectives. Statements covered
each of the three major taxonomic categories of student learning;
knowledge (L1), skills (L2-3, L6, L9-10, and L12), and attitudes
(L8, L11), plus behaviour (L4-5, L7). All three sets of questions
on course design, educator style and life skills had a forced four-
point Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree). There was
no safe ’neutral’ option which is sometimes seen as an easy option
to take when a respondent is unsure, and so may not reﬂect a truly
neutral point of view (Allen and Seaman, 2007).

Global

subjective happiness was measured using the
unidimensional “Subjective Happiness Scale” (SHS, Lyubomirsky
and Lepper, 1999). Developed and validated in the United States,
from the respondent’s own
the SHS considers happiness

outcomes (rectangles). The model accounts for measurement error at the item level (not shown).

perspective and therefore accounts for diﬀerences in cultural
expectations between Western and Asian societies. The original
scale has four statements, but we removed “Some people are
generally not very happy. Although they are not depressed, they
never seem as happy as they might be. To what extent does
this characterisation describe you?” because the counterpart
statement about happiness (item 3) was deemed suﬃcient. The
response format was a seven-point Likert scale, with higher scores
reﬂecting greater happiness. We deﬁned life satisfaction as the
cognitive assessment of one’s life as a whole. Individuals tend to
use their own benchmarks and criteria in making this assessment
and so it is more meaningful to assess global judgements of life
satisfaction, rather than satisfaction with speciﬁc life domains
(Diener and Diener, 1995; Proctor et al., 2009). Students’ life
satisfaction was measured using the unidimensional “Satisfaction
With Life Scale” (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985). Developed and
validated in the United States, it has been validated in Asia (Bai
et al., 2011). The original scale has ﬁve statements, three referring
to satisfaction with the present, and two to satisfaction with the
past. We removed “If I could live my life over, I would change
almost nothing” since this was deemed to have inadequate
construct validity for our target youth sample. Responses were
indicated using a seven-point Likert scale (Strongly disagree to
Strongly agree), and the global score has previously been shown
to be sensitive in discriminating the full range of life satisfaction
from extremely dissatisﬁed to extremely satisﬁed (Pavot and
Diener, 1993). We are justiﬁed in removing individual items
from the SHS and SWLS since in the context of the reﬂective
measurement model, all items are expected to be correlated (i.e.,
possess internal consistency reliability), and so dropping an item
from the measurement model should not alter the meaning of
the items (Jarvis et al., 2003).

Procedure
The positive education lectures and workshops were conceived
by the senior management
team, compulsory for students
and formed part of a credit-bearing “Self-Empowerment and
Social Responsibility” course that constituted level 1 of the
EmPOWER programme. This 24-week course was designed with
expert input from educators and a practising consultant in
positive psychology. The curriculum was informed by Seligman’s
Wellbeing Theory (Seligman, 2011), incorporating the principles
of positive psychology by blending development in skills that
promote thriving (e.g., self-awareness, intrinsic motivation, and
leadership; Benson and Scales, 2009), with an emphasis on
developing by mapping personal strengths and opportunities
(Sprangel et al., 2011), character strengths and virtues (Peterson
and Seligman, 2004). The curriculum also included discovering
purpose and creating a plan to mobilise that purpose into positive
impact (Benson and Scales, 2009). Each week had 2 h of contact
time, comprising conventional lecture-style presentations plus
workshops to develop a personal impact statement comprising
three personalised statements “I am a . . .. My purpose is . . .. I will
. . ...” Additional personal study time was required to complete
an impactful community project through team-working and
homework exercises that required self-reﬂective practise.

informed consent

The study was approved by the Social Sciences Ethics
Committee Heriot-Watt University on September 2019 (ref:
2019-120), and all participants gave online (survey) and verbal
and written (interview)
in April 2020.
Quantitative data were gathered through an online survey
using Qualtrics software (Seattle, United States). Course design,
educator style, and life skills were measured at T2 and T3. Two
of the life skills (items L11: positive thoughts, and L12: critical
thinking) were assessed only at the end of the course (T3) because
they had not yet been adequately covered at the mid-way point.
SHS and SWLS were assessed at three time points: T1 - prior to
the start of the course, T2 – at the mid-way point (12 weeks), and
T3 – at the end of the course (24 weeks).

Qualitative data were gathered through a semi-structured
the co-authors and a
interview, conducted by ZB, one of
involved in the delivery
health psychologist, who was not
of
the course. Questions probed how the life skills were
achieved. The interview followed the approach of Interpretative
Phenomenological Analysis which enables multiple participants
who experience similar events to tell their stories without any
distortions and then seeks to make sense of the ‘lived experiences’
of the research participants (Alase, 2017).

Design and Analysis
Change over time in SHS and SWLS were examined using a one-
way ANOVA, and change over time in life skills were examined
using a paired t test.

For the quantitative survey data, the hypothesised structural
model in Figure 1 was analysed using Partial Least Squares
Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) implemented with
Smart PLS version 3 (SmartPLS GmbH, Germany). PLS contains
a two-step procedure as recommended by Henseler et al. (2009),
which involves the evaluation of the (outer) measurement model
followed by evaluation of the (inner) structural model.

The assessment of the measurement model (Figure 1) used
the T3 data (n = 350) and involved examining the reliabilities
of the individual items (indicator reliability), internal consistency
[Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability), convergent validity
(Average Variance Extracted (AVE)] and discriminant validity
(Fornell-Larcker criterion, heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio
of correlations criterion, cross-loading; Fornell and Larcker,
1981; Hair et al., 2017).

As a measure of indicator reliability, the factor loadings of
the measurement items should be higher than 0.70 for inclusion
and should be deleted if less than 0.40 and 0.70 (Hulland, 1999;
Hair et al., 2017). Regarding internal consistency in the scale
items, Cronbach’s alpha (α) is a measure of internal consistency
(i.e., how closely related the observed items were in representing
the underlying construct), while Composite Reliability (CR) is
an indicator of the shared variance among the observed items
used as an indicator of a latent construct. For good reliability,
α should be greater than 0.70 and CR should be 0.70–0.95
(Hair et al., 2017).

Convergent validity assesses whether the actual results
conﬁrm expected relationships between items and underlying
constructs. The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) measures the
level of variance captured by a construct vs. the level due to

measurement error, and a value of 0.50 is acceptable while 0.7
is very good (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Discriminant validity
assesses the extent to which the underlying constructs in the
model are distinct from one another (Hulland, 1999). To satisfy
this requirement, items should load more onto their intended
construct than on another. This requirement was tested by three
indices (Hair et al., 2017). Under the Fornell-Larcker criterion,
the square root of each construct’s AVE should have a greater
value than the variance of the other constructs. The HTMT value
should be lower than 0.85 (Kline, 2011), although some authors
suggest 0.90 (Teo et al., 2008). And each measurement item
should correlate weakly with all other constructs, except for the
one to which it is theoretically associated, which should be higher
than 0.70 (Hair et al., 2017).

In step two of

the PLS approach, we evaluated the
structural model’s predictive ability and the relationships between
the constructs. The coeﬃcient of determination (R2), path
coeﬃcients (β), and t-statistic values, eﬀect size (f2) and the
predictive relevance (Q2) are the key standards for such
evaluation (Hair et al., 2017). R2 measures the amount of variance
explained in the endogenous constructs (i.e., life skills, happiness
and life satisfaction). Following Hair et al. (2017), R2 = 0.75 is
considered substantial, R2 = 50 is regarded as moderate, and
R2 = 0.26 is considered weak.
The path coeﬃcients

strength of
the hypothesised
constructs.
A bootstrapping technique with 5,000 resamples was conducted
to estimate the beta (β) and corresponding t values as
recommended by Chin et al. (2003). The greater the beta
coeﬃcient (β), the stronger the eﬀect of an exogenous construct
on the endogenous construct. Path coeﬃcients with a value close
to 1 represents a strong positive relationship, and conversely a
value closer to −1 represents a strong negative relationship. The
overall eﬀect size (f2) is a measure of the degree of impact of
the path relationship. Following Hair et al. (2017), f2 = 0.75 is
considered large, f2 = 0.15 is regarded as medium, and f2 = 0.02
is considered small. The predictive relevance for the structural
model was evaluated using Q2 (Tenenhaus et al., 2005) and so
it can be considered an indicator of the quality of the structural
model. Interpretation of Q2 followed that of Hair et al. (2017),
with a value > 0 indicating adequate predictive relevance, and a
value < 0 indicating poor predictive relevance.

For the qualitative interview data, we employed a Framework
Method to analyse the anonymised interview transcripts. The
Framework Method is most commonly used for the thematic
analysis of semi-structured interview and it is appropriate for
application to reasonably homogenous data covering similar
topics (Gale et al., 2013). Our approach was partly deductive
because coding proceeded through the lens of predeﬁned
categories based on the structural model: (i) how the course
content inﬂuenced perceived life skills, (ii) how the instructor
style of delivery inﬂuenced students’ learning, (iii) happiness,
and (iv) life satisfaction. Coders followed the Framework
Method steps (i.e., Transcription; Familiarisation with the
interview; Open coding; Developing an analytical framework
by structuring the codes under each category; Applying the
analytical framework to the remaining transcripts; Charting the

data into the framework matrix; Interpreting the data), and
used Quirkos version 2.4.2 (Quirkos, Scotland). Two coders (ZB
and DH) who were not part of the EmPOWER teaching team
independently completed the open coding. Open coding was
ﬁrst conducted on three transcripts to conﬁrm that important
aspects of the data were not missed by restricting to these
four categories. Data interpretation interrogated the theoretical
concepts (either prior concepts or ones emerging from the
data) and mapped connections between categories to explore
relationships or causality.

RESULTS

Data from the 246 included respondents did not support
hypothesis (i) that the course would improve students’ wellbeing
in accordance with Wellbeing Theory (Seligman, 2011). There
was no detectable change in wellbeing as measured by the SHS
[F(2,490) = 1.317, p = 0.269] and SWLS [F(2,490) = 0.363,
p = 0.696] (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2).
As the course progressed from T2 to T3,

there was a
small, but statistically signiﬁcant increase in life skills scores
[t(245) = −3.741, p < 0.001] (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table 2). Thus, hypothesis (ii) was supported.

Directional inﬂuences between variables (i.e., hypotheses iii
and iv) were evaluated using Structural Equation Modelling.
The (outer) measurement model deﬁned in Figure 1 met all
a priori evaluation criteria regarding the reliability and validity
of the items in the constructs (Table 2). The factor loadings of
the measurement items ranged between 0.702 and 0.920 which
meets the threshold for indicator reliability and conﬁrms the
relative importance of each observed item to the underlying
construct. The α values for all construct factors were 0.871–
0.938 and CR values were 0.902–0.946, indicating the scales
had acceptable reliability. AVE values were acceptable for course
design, educator style and life skills (i.e., 0.562–0.602) and very
good for happiness and life satisfaction (i.e., 0.699–0.788), and so
convergent validity was conﬁrmed for this hypothesised model.

The model also met all a priori evaluation criteria regarding
the discriminant validity of the latent constructs. From Table 3,
it can be seen that the square root of each construct’s AVE for
each construct was greater than the correlation involving the
constructs thus meeting the criterion of Fornell and Larcker
(1981), and from Table 4 the results also passed the HTMT
criterion test with values not exceeding 0.85. Moreover, from the
cross-loading evaluation all the loading indicators on the assigned
construct were > 0.70 and higher than the loadings on the other
constructs (Supplementary Table 3).

Based on these ﬁndings, the proposed structural model was
accepted, with conﬁrmation of adequate reliability, convergent
validity, and discriminant validity. The next step was to evaluate
the (inner) structural model outcomes comprising the latent
constructs and path coeﬃcients (Figure 1).

Hypothesis (iii) predicted that the course design and educator
style would each positively inﬂuence students’ learning of life
skills, and this was supported by our data. Course design
contributed in a meaningful way to learning life skills, while the

(Hair et al., 2017). The Q2 value for the life skills construct
was equal to 0.290, which was higher than the threshold limit,
indicating that the path model had suﬃcient predictive relevance
for this construct (Hair et al., 2017). From the path coeﬃcients,
both course design and educator style signiﬁcantly and positively
inﬂuenced life skills, β = 0.610 and 0.135, respectively, p < 0.05
(Table 5). Considering the eﬀect size for the inﬂuence of course
design on life skills (f2 = 0.372, Table 5), the result exceeded a
‘medium’ eﬀect (Hair et al., 2017). In contrast, for educator style,
f2 was 0.018 which is considered small.

Hypothesis (iv) predicted that achievement

in life skills
would in turn drive greater wellbeing as measured by subjective
happiness and life satisfaction. Statistically speaking,
the
hypothesis was supported, but the size of the inﬂuence was
very small. The smaller R2 values for happiness (0.054) and
life satisfaction (0.044) suggest that life skills explain very little
of the variance in these endogenous constructs (i.e., 5.4 and
4.4%, respectively) (Figure 1). While the Q2 values for the
happiness and life satisfaction constructs also reached suﬃcient
predictive relevance (0.036 and 0.027, respectively), they were
only just greater than 0, indicating barely adequate predictive
relevance (Hair et al., 2017). From the path coeﬃcients, life skills
signiﬁcantly and positively inﬂuenced students’ self-reported
happiness and life satisfaction, β = 0.230 and 0.209 respectively,
p < 0.001 (Table 5). However, the corresponding eﬀect sizes were
small (Hair et al., 2017).

Understanding the Lived Experience of
the Learning Process
The interview ﬁndings shed light on the paths inﬂuencing
perceived life skills acquisition. Four themes emerged about the
course design. It was students’ ﬁrst opportunity to engage in life
skills training, it gave them a chance to demonstrate their ability
to articulate what they had learned, the course instilled a genuine
sense of excitement to learn, and it promoted a greater self-
awareness and sense of purpose. Three themes emerged about
educator style. Learning activities were engaging and informative
and students were encouraged to apply their knowledge, but
there were some criticisms about quality of the teaching staﬀ.
No themes on happiness were observed, but there was some
evidence that the course contributed to life satisfaction as it
encouraged students to engage in cognitions and behaviours that
would promote success.

Course Design
For many interviewees,
time they had
engaged in self-reﬂection to know themselves better and in
life skills training to develop personal eﬀectiveness. Moreover,
interviewees recognised and appreciated unique opportunities
open to them that had not been oﬀered at school nor were
available to their friends at other universities.

before. So I think that really helps me reﬂect how a person I
am, in what way.”

Students were also able to articulate how they had developed
certain personal eﬀectiveness
skills, particularly leadership
(Learning outcome L2), team-working and communication (L6)
and time management (L7).

• Student 1 said: “I kind of enjoy this because. In our public
school system in our country we don’t really have something
like this. So to come to university and to see something like
this, it’s something that I appreciate, I can appreciate that
personally. . .. When I ﬁrst saw that there was a course like
this, I was personally quite delighted because this is based
oﬀ my previous experiences in other universities, they don’t
really put that much emphasis on programmes like this.”
• Student 3 said: “So I told them [my friends]” and their
response was “Wow, it’s a very good initiative.” My friends
are from other university, and they mentioned that there is
a lack of talks and all those stuﬀ. And they are surprised to
see, “Wow, you really have a programme that motivates you
to attend those talks.”

• Student 5 said: “All these project managing, working as a
team, all our leadership skills, other universities do not have
that.”

• Student 12 said: “Cause before I joined the university [. . .]
I was probably a bit lost in several ways. But during the
EmPOWER program, they introduced us to some concepts
and some personality traits that I’ve never really think about

• Student 3 said: “I have a good leadership skill. . .I try to
improve myself, like joining those clubs and societies, so that
when I put it in the LinkedIn post. . .so people will get to
notice you, your leadership skills.”

• Student 4 said: ‘I think it’s a really good platform for me
to start leading people such as. I pick up the responsibility
of saying, “Okay, I will do this. I will lead the group. I will
delegate a task and then communicate with my members so
that my members would say.without a leader in the group,
I think everything would be chaos. I took the initiative to
become a leader. And because of that, I think it helps me to
improve my leadership skills. I have deﬁnitely improved on
my time management skills, because we managed to ﬁnish
everything on time. We were actually ahead of schedule. And
despite certain setbacks from the conﬂict, we actually still
managed to get back ahead of schedule also.”

• Student 13 said: “Toward the end, before we conduct our
social project, we got into a little bit of a disagreement and
then to solve that, we did it as team, so I think that was a
good experience ’cause everyone set aside our diﬀerences and
we got together to solve something.”

Students were also able to articulate how they had developed
greater emotional awareness (Learning outcome L3), self-
regulation (L4), ability to express gratitude (L8) and ability to
reframe thoughts more positively (L11).

• Student 4 said: “I think one of the weakness. My last one was
actually something about love. And I do not know how to
harness that in my networking among my university friends
and lecturers. But maybe I would just say that, through
these few months I was in uni, maybe I would say I will
just increase. Further strengthen my love toward myself and
then my love toward friendships, friendships and professional
development.”

• Student 5 said: “A positive impact it did for me is that,
after writing the gratitude letter, it kind a opened my eyes to
everything else that I should be grateful for.”

• Student 7 said: “I’m not usually the type to show love, but
because of the gratitude letter, it helps me to show more love
to people, so it did help me also.”

• Student 8 said: “It was really good. I actually did it for my
grandfather, who has recently passed away, so. He was happy.
He was very happy. I’m really glad I did it.”

The course instilled a genuine sense of excitement to learn.

• Student 5 said: “I guess, my highlight [. . .] was the
Community Project itself, because it kinda opened my eyes
to [. . .] how work will be, it kinda gives this. forces us to work
as a team or work on our own, so we kinda have an idea on
how we can apply certain things later on.”

• Student 9 said: “I remember the attendance was also many
because all of us was very excited and interested to hear this
workshop.”

Interviewees mentioned on a number of recurring aspects of
the course design about how the content had enabled them ‘.to
develop our personal skill which we cannot learn during lectures’
(Student 10). The purpose work (Learning outcome L1) left
a lasting impression. Overall, the purpose activities instilled a
greater sense of who students are and where they are heading,
particularly at a formative time in year 1 when they had further
years of study ahead.

• Student 3 said: “Impact statement, what I ﬁnd it about is,
it’s very interesting because even. It knows what you wanna
achieve in the future. . . I think that it helps to know what
you’re capable of in the future, it helps to realise what are
your goals, what are your dreams, what you wanna achieve.”
• Student 7 said: ‘It helped me a bit because before the impact
statement, I don’t know what actually am I doing. I’m just
doing accounting because I thought this is the easiest for me.
But with the impact statement, at least I have a purpose. . .’
• Student 12 said: “EmPOWER course is very helpful for
especially year one students, who, some of them just entered
the proper university environment. And it really helped
students to ﬁnd their purpose and set their goals during the
3–4 years of study in university. And I think it also helps to
encourage students to think more about themselves and to
really ﬁnd what kind of person they are.”

Educator Style
The active and positive style of delivery played a contributory
role

• Student 9 said: “They reach out to us very often, and remind
us on the task, and then it’s like more, how to say, closer to us.
We can feel that they are very genuinely want to help us, to
improve.”

• Student 12 said: “Let’s say the workshop facilitators were very
empowering. They were very active. And also, they really
help us to follow the instructions and progress through the
workshops smoothly.”

• Student 13 said: “I would say that the instructor was a really
helpful person ﬁrstly, he gave us certain points, like what to do
in this section? What to put in this section? Why it’s working
and why is not? And all that. I think that was always useful.
And he also told us dos and don’ts.”

The hands-on activities encouraged students
they had learned, and this reinforced all

that were taught.

life skills

• Student 7 said: “And then we need to do a project like how to
clean the river. So actually we did. Like a hands-on activity
there because we discuss in the group how to do. How to build
something to clean the river. She did the lecture for 1 h and
she gave us like 30 min to do the project and another 30 min
for presentation. So for me, that is quite interesting because
we don’t actually sit there for 2 h straight. We’re actually like
doing something and we’re actually using the techniques that
she’s giving.”

Not all aspects of teaching were well received, and some
students commented on the variability in quality of the teaching
staﬀ. This may have aﬀected the model ﬁndings, particularly the
relationship between educator style and life skills.

• For example, student 7 recognised that

that not all
workshops embedded interactive activities: “I would prefer
it will be like 1 h lecture and another 1 h for us to use that
skill, like we try it ourselves.”

• Student 4 said: “. . . in all honestly, because they are just
reading from the slides, to be honest [. . .] instead of maybe
giving lectures and stuﬀ, like giving talks for 2 h, you should
give something more hands-on, more activities, something
that requires thinking.”

• Student 1 said: “Diversifying the power speakers is a good
idea [. . .] But the problem with that is consistency [. . .] They
don’t deliver it to that similar standard that we come to have
expected from the previous week.”

Life Satisfaction
No themes on happiness were observed, but there was some
evidence that the course contributed to life satisfaction as it
encouraged students to engage in cognitions and behaviours that
promote success. For example, student 13 mentioned: “I would
say that it’s worth the shot. I would recommend it. . .it’s interesting

to know that there are certain things that you think you know
yourself, but you don’t really know. You don’t know the kind
of potential that you could unleash. So this programme kinda
helped me to ﬁnd my potential and things that I could do better
or improve on.” Student 7 also reﬂected on how the life skills
training made them reﬂect on what was important in their life
to achieve personal satisfaction. “I think more programmes about
why. I mean why we need to help more people, something like
that, instead of focussing on your work, instead of focussing like
to achieve. Instead of focussing to achieve money and stuﬀ, maybe
we can say that there’s more to life like we need to be like a good
people, so everyone can enjoy life together, I think. Yeah, because
for me money is everything, but at the same time, life. Like to help
others is more important for me.”

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of a holistic development
programme conceived by the senior managerial team, fully
integrated into the curriculum and completed by all university
students enrolled across an academic year group. Moreover,
the study was conducted in an Asian setting. The principal
ﬁnding from the quantitative data demonstrated improved life
skills, mostly achieved through the course design. The qualitative
data added value to this ﬁnding by illustrating how learning
was not limited to knowledge acquisition, but that the students
recognised what psychosocial skills, attitudes and values are
needed for positive behaviour change to occur (c.f. UNICEF,
2012).

Although there was no detectable change in subjective
happiness and life satisfaction scores over time, perceived life
skills did exert a small
inﬂuence on wellbeing at the end
of the course. The qualitative data indicated that important
seeds had been planted which could promote a mindset for
ﬂourishing in adulthood. Longitudinal studies have shown that
positive education interventions are at their best when they
exert measurable beneﬁts that evolve over time, such as by
enhancing academic application through greater engagement
in the learning process (e.g., Denovan et al., 2020). In their
systematic narrative review, Nasheeda et al. (2019) concluded that
many life skills programmes in developing countries (including
those across Southeast Asia) fail to achieve sustained beneﬁts
because they focus on one-shot or short-term interventions
rather than on ongoing activities. The same criticism can also
be levied at positive education programmes across Asia (Hall
et al., 2021a). The programme under study here is intended to
foster lifelong impact as students progress through the levels of
the EmPOWER programme throughout their student journey.
Although our study design did not include a long-term follow-
up assessment, we would recommend testing intervals over the
course of the student journey to examine the learning trajectory.
This would require institutional resource for systematic planning,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation (UNICEF, 2012).

From our cross-sectional modelling data that assessed short-
term eﬀects, we conclude that eﬀective course content is more
critical than educator style for good life skills acquisition. This

ﬁnding is consistent with the published educational literature.
For example, course design is known to positively inﬂuence
students’ perceived learning (Eom and Ashill, 2016), with high
levels of interaction connecting students with their instructors,
the course content, and their fellow classmates (McKone, 1999;
Boling et al., 2012). In many ways, course design and educator
style should be mutually enhancing, yet in the present study,
educator style had a relatively small eﬀect on life skills. We
suggest that this may be explained by the somewhat variable
student experience that was evident from the interviews, for
example in the quotes cited from students 1, 4 and 7. In their
exploration of thriving in adolescence, Benson and Scales (2009)
reﬂected on the importance of the interaction between the
student and the educational environment. They conceptualised
that the process of adolescent thriving is animated by a passion
for, and the exercise of action to nurture, a self-identiﬁed interest,
skill, or capacity. Here, they proposed the role of the educator
is to oﬀer, ﬁnd and create opportunities for the young person to
express their spark, as well as to know, aﬃrm, celebrate and guide
that spark. Hagenauer and Volet (2014) also argued for a wider
research agenda on teacher-student relationships as a relevant
construct in higher education. In the context of the present study,
with many hundreds of students in the class and only a small
number of educators, we suggest that may have hindered the
ability to create an optimal positive developmental context, even
with the most passionate educators. To foster such development,
several students talked about the importance of being taught by
academic staﬀ whom have the skills and competencies to facilitate
an interactive learning environment that enables them to put into
practise those life skills. In this regard, our results address the
research gap identiﬁed by Nasheeda et al. (2019) by deﬁning what
is needed to foster optimal positive change. However, further
research is needed to evaluate the impact of this recommended
change in practise.

Limitations
A large number of 570 students who were enrolled on this course
did not contribute data to the study. Overall, 220 (38.6%) had
an overall attendance record below the prerequisite 80%, and so
they did not meet the study inclusion criteria. Hypotheses (i)
and (ii) were tested using data from only 246 students (43.2% of
the total sample) since 104 students attended 80% of the course,
but did not complete the life skills survey, SHS and SWLS at
T2. Attrition bias can weaken external validity, meaning that
the study ﬁndings cannot be generalised to other populations,
especially if those missing data came from students with a
systematic pattern of characteristics (such as being less motivated
or engaged in the course). Potentially attrition bias can also
weaken internal validity, meaning that the relationships between
the latent variables may change. We would argue that this is
unlikely because hypotheses (iii) and (iv) were tested using data
from 61.4% of the total sample (350 students) collected at T3.

Future Research Directions
From our work, we make two recommendations to advance the
ﬁeld; ﬁrst to conduct studies that assess long-term impact as well
as short-term eﬀects and second to understand how to maximise

beneﬁt for students, including those in Asia. In his recent editorial
on the state of Positive Education in Asia, King et al. (2016)
identiﬁed a lack of attention to the socio-cultural context as
another important gap in the research literature. Two-thirds of
the world’s population lives in Asia, yet most of the academic
work is conducted in Western countries. This geographical bias
is especially awkward given that culture is well-known to play a
key role in wellbeing and learning (e.g., Stankov, 2013; Caleon
et al., 2015). Many of the developing countries in Asia have
traditionally put primacy on learning as a means for social
mobility and economic survival which may explain why an Asian
higher education tends to emphasise academic achievement and
professional qualiﬁcations (Lin et al., 2018). Our qualitative data
indicated students’ appreciation of the opportunity to address
wellbeing and life skills in the context of their own learning. They
also appeared to be aware that the course they were studying
oﬀered something unique compared to other education providers
in the country. Other researchers have shown that youths
from Asian societies have a stronger sense of family obligation
compared to their Western counterparts (King and Ganotice,
2015). In contrast to the work by Caleon et al. (2015), we found
no evidence for a role of external motivators such as needing to
show parents that they are achieving. Instead, we found many
more examples of an intrinsic motivation to learn. These ﬁndings
highlight the need for more contemporary research on the Gen Z
student population so that researchers and educators can better
understand changing perceptions and expectations. For those
educators and researchers in Asia, our work also poses the cross-
cultural issue about whether families of Gen Z students are
becoming more like their Western counterparts in terms of their
educational expectations and career aspirations. Based on our
experience with the EmPOWER programme, Asian students are
calling for a shift toward a more collaborative and empowering
approach to teaching (see also Hall et al., 2021b). In this regard,
we may move even closer to achieving optimal ﬂourishing by
combining positive education with coaching psychology practises
(Palmer and Whybrow, 2008; Seligman and Adler, 2018).

Conclusion
The teaching of wellbeing and life skills in higher education
provides students with valuable personal resources for growth.
Our quantitative and qualitative research ﬁndings indicate that
such a novel educational approach is well-received by Asian
students and may sow the seeds for future beneﬁt by positively
impacting on their skills, behaviours, attitudes, and values.
