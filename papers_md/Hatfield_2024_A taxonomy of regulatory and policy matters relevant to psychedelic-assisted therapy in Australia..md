Abstract

Objectives:  The  Australian  government  recently  rescheduled  psilocybin  and  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
for limited clinical uses. This change has raised various regulatory concerns and challenges for the field of psychedelic-
assisted therapy. To provide clarity, we aimed to comprehensively catalogue the matters relating to psychedelic-assisted 
therapy that are or could be regulated.

Methods: We conducted a desktop review of the literature and current regulatory sources, semi-structured interviews 
with professionals who had expertise in fields relating to psychedelic-assisted therapy and a framework analysis to gener-
ate a taxonomy of relevant regulatory matters. In relation to each matter, we further identified what type of regulation 
(if any) currently applies to that matter, any uncertainty as to how the matter should be addressed in clinical practice 
in the context of current regulation and whether there are conflicting views as to how the matter could or should be 
further regulated.

Results:  The  taxonomy  is  structured  into  six  main  regulatory  domains,  three  of  which  have  a  substantial  propor-
tion of matters with uncertainty or conflicting views: Service Establishment, Practitioner, and Treatment Delivery. Key 
examples  of  such  matters  include  the  location  of  services  and  facilities  required,  which  professionals  are  eligible  to 
become psychedelic therapists, and with what qualifications and experience. Matters in the remaining three domains, 
Patient Evaluation, Drug Supply and Service Oversight, appear by comparison relatively settled, with regulation either 
well-established or thought unnecessary.

Conclusions:  The  taxonomy  provides  a  roadmap  for  health  services  establishing  and  implementing  a  psychedelic-
assisted therapy program, or for government and other policymakers when determining areas that may require further 
regulation.

On  1  July  2023,  the  Therapeutic  Goods  Administration 
(TGA) in Australia reclassified psilocybin and 3,4-methyl-
enedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA)  as  schedule  8  sub-
stances,  for  the  sole  indications  of  treatment-resistant 
depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively 
(TGA,  2023c).  The  rescheduling  applies  exclusively  to 
authorised prescribers and only when delivered as part of 
an  approved  treatment  protocol  (TGA,  2023c).  The  deci-
sion  comes  on  the  back  of  emerging  but  limited  clinical 
evidence as to the efficacy and safety of these substances 
(Kisely et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; van Amsterdam and 
van den Brink, 2022). Structured protocols are commonly

referred to as psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) and gen-
erally  involve  a  course  of  psychotherapeutic  supports 
before,  during  and  after  the  administration  of  a  ‘classic’ 
serotonergic psychedelic (such as psilocybin, lysergic acid 
5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-
diethylamide 
tryptamine)  or  the  empathogen  MDMA.  While  there  are 
notable  differences  in  the  subjective  effects  of  psilocybin 
and  MDMA,  and  the  clinical  protocols  accompanying 
them, we believe the regulatory issues are sufficiently com-
parable to consider them together.

[LSD] 

or 

recognise 

The  rescheduling  of  psilocybin  and  MDMA  makes 
Australia the first national jurisdiction in the 21st century to 
formally 
these  substances  as  medicines. 
Elsewhere,  regulatory  frameworks  exist  that  functionally 
allow for wellness or spiritual psychedelic use, including in 
the  United  States,  the  Netherlands,  Peru,  Jamaica,  Costa 
Rica and several other localities, as evidenced by the robust 
private  psychedelic  retreat  industry  (Retreat  Guru,  n.d.). 
Special  access  pathways  also  exist  for  medical  use  under 
narrowly  defined  circumstances  in  (at  least)  Canada, 
Switzerland and Israel (Mocanu et al., 2022). Psychedelics 
were also historically legal for use in psychiatric settings in 
several countries, including LSD in Australia until the mid-
1970s  under  an  authorised  prescriber  scheme  (Lomax, 
2017).

The 2023 Federal regulatory changes introduced a simi-
lar  authorised  prescriber  model,  with  the  additional  over-
sight of a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and, 
in  some  jurisdictions,  additional  state-  or  territory-based 
requirements.  Individual  psychiatrists  will  need  to  apply 
for  Authorised  Prescriber  (AP)  status  by  submitting  the 
proposed treatment protocol to a HREC. If the application 
receives approval from the HREC, it will then be submitted 
for final approval by the TGA. The TGA has published a 
guidance  document  that  provides  an  overview  of  what 
details are expected to be addressed in an AP application, 
including details of the protocol, information about the spe-
cific substance to be administered, and the measures used 
to address safety, efficacy and outcomes reporting (TGA, 
2023a). However, the TGA has not specified any particular 
standards or protocols for the psychotherapeutic supports, 
noting this is outside of their regulatory purview (Skerritt 
and Langham, 2023).

PAT sits within a broad milieu of complex supply, clini-
cal,  professional,  governance  and  financial  systems  that 
intersect with existing regulation and/or have the potential 
to  be  regulated  further  (Andrews  and  Wright,  2022). 
Although Australian  psychiatrists  appear  to  be  cautiously 
in support of the introduction of PAT, many are uncertain 
and somewhat concerned as to how it will operate in prac-
tice  (Berger  and  Fitzgerald,  2023;  Kunstler  et al.,  2023). 
Given the breadth of potentially relevant matters it is not 
hard to see why.

To  better  appreciate  these  regulatory  complexities,  we 
aimed to comprehensively catalogue the matters relating to

PAT that are or could be regulated. We defined ‘regulated’ 
broadly as any way in which the establishment and imple-
mentation of a PAT program may be standardised or con-
strained.  We  assumed  regulation  to  include  both  external 
government  regulation  (i.e.  legislation,  rules  and  policy), 
and  instruments  of  professional  self-regulation  such  as 
standardisation documents produced by professional bod-
ies (guidelines, codes, standards, recommendations, state-
ments, memorandum, etc.).

Method
Ethics

The  study  was  approved  by  the  University  of  Sydney’s 
Human  Research  and  Ethics  Committee  (Approval  No. 
2023/236).

Study design

The  study  comprised  two  data  collection  and  analysis 
phases: (1) a desktop review of the literature, to generate a 
list of potential regulatory matters and arrange these into a 
draft  taxonomy;  and  (2)  semi-structured  interviews  with 
purposively selected experts, to obtain feedback and further 
input into the taxonomy.

Desktop review

A  search  was  conducted  in  the  Ovid  MEDLINE  database 
using  the  following  keywords  and  operators:  (psychedelic 
OR  psychedelic-assisted  OR  hallucinogen)  AND  (therap* 
OR psychotherap* OR medic*) AND (legal OR legislat* OR 
regulat*  OR  code  OR  guideline  OR  polic*  OR  ethic*). A 
total  of  226  abstracts  were  reviewed,  and  papers  were 
selected  for  further  analysis  based  on  an  assessment  of 
whether there was likely to be a discussion of matters rele-
vant  to  PAT  regulation,  policy,  ethics  or  program  design. 
Information was also sourced directly from relevant govern-
ment websites including the TGA, the Office of Drug Control 
(ODC),  State  health  departments,  the  US  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA) and from relevant professional asso-
ciation  websites  including  the  Royal  Australian  and  New 
Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP), the Australian 
Psychological Society (APS), the newly formed Australian 
Multidisciplinary Association  for  Psychedelic  Practitioners 
(AMAPP)  and  the  US-based  Multidisciplinary Association 
for  Psychedelic  Studies  (MAPS).  A  total  of  48  academic 
papers and 21 organisational documents were eligible.

Data and framework

The theoretical and operational basis of our data collection 
and analysis was an adapted version of the framework anal-
ysis methodology (Goldsmith, 2021). The key elements of 

Hatfield et al.

framework analysis are: (1) initial familiarisation with the 
data; (2) generation of a thematic framework; (3) indexing 
the data points; (4) charting the data according to the frame-
work; and (5) mapping and interpretation. Framework anal-
ysis  is  intended  to  be  flexible  and  iterative,  allowing  for 
refinement of the framework and subsequent mapping of the 
data according to themes and patterns that emerge, and as 
such  is  well-suited  to  applied  policy  research  (Goldsmith, 
2021).

We  defined  our  data  points  as  any  matters  relating  to 
PAT  that  are  or  could  be  regulated. A  brief  survey  of  the 
literature  was  conducted  to  become  familiarised  with  the 
types of matters and to construct a plausible framework of 
top-level domains and categories. The literature was then 
examined in-depth in order to index all potential regulatory 
matters,  which  were  then  charted  within  the  framework. 
Specific information associated with each matter was also 
noted,  such  as  current  regulation,  unresolved  issues  and 
suggestions for future regulation.

Matters were excluded if they were not sufficiently rel-
evant or specific to PAT, e.g. regulatory requirements that 
apply  to  healthcare  generally.  Furthermore,  we  did  not 
index matters relating only to the administration of below- 
or  threshold-perceptual  doses  (‘microdosing’)  or  multiple 
medium doses administered during psychotherapy sessions 
(‘psycholytic therapy’), given these have not to date gener-
ated  a  sufficient  evidence-base  and  are  thus  currently 
unlikely to be approved for clinical practice.

Based on the relative distribution of matters, the catego-
ries and domains themselves were refined and rearranged 
within the framework. The draft taxonomy was then pro-
vided to participants for the interview phase.

Participants

To best address our research aims, it was necessary to con-
sult professionals with experience and knowledge relevant 
to PAT. Given Australia’s limited pool of such profession-
als, purposive sampling was the most suitable recruitment 
method. The sample included people known professionally 
to the research team, authors of relevant academic papers, 
experts referenced in media reports and people working in 
PAT  research  and  development.  Participation  was  sought 
from a range of professional fields to ensure a broad spec-
trum of perspectives, including psychiatry, psychology, the 
pharmaceutical industry, research, professional bodies and 
government  departments.  A  total  of  30  potential  partici-
pants  were  contacted  by  email  and,  where  appropriate,  a 
follow-up phone call. Participants self-selected by indicat-
ing  their  willingness  to  participate  and  provided  written 
informed consent.

Interviews

Participants were asked for feedback on both the framework 
structure and the matters themselves, including any not yet 

identified  matters. A  semi-structured  interview  guide  was 
developed consisting of questions on the scope and structure 
of the taxonomy framework. It was not intended that partici-
pants would systematically address all aspects of the taxon-
omy during the interviews, but rather only areas where they 
had expertise. Interviews ranging between 31 and 59 min-
utes  were  conducted  via  video  conference  and  audio-
recorded. As the interviews were intended to elicit further 
matters  not  yet  identified  in  the  literature  search,  partici-
pants  were  encouraged  to  speak  at  length  about  areas  of 
interest.  Interview  notes  were  taken  both  contemporane-
ously and during review of the recordings.

The same framework analysis methodology was applied 
to the interview notes. Specifically, additional matters iden-
tified  were  indexed  and  charted,  along  with  associated 
information such as unresolved issues and suggestions for 
future  regulation.  Participant  feedback  also  led  to  the 
removal or merging of some matters that had appeared in 
the  draft  taxonomy,  largely  because  these  matters  were 
found to be inconsequential and/or not specific to PAT. A 
total of 102 matters appeared in the final taxonomy. Finally, 
based on participant feedback, the top-level domains were 
further  amended,  and  the  categories  re-sorted,  to  better 
reflect the order in which they would likely be considered 
by a health service implementing PAT.

Analysis

‘Key Notes’ were written for each of the matters, based on 
a  synthesis  of  the  participants’  discussions  around  that 
matter  together  with  the  associated  information  derived 
from  the  literature.  From  this  process,  three  factors 
emerged that we determined could be applied to all mat-
ters (i.e. the final mapping stage of framework analysis): 
(1)  whether  the  matter  was  subject  to  current  regulation 
(being Federal/State legislation or policy, or professional 
guidelines); (2) whether there was uncertainty as to how a 
health service would address the matter in the context of 
current regulation; and (3) whether there were conflicting 
views (between participants and/or in the literature) as to 
how  the  matter  should  or  could  be  further  regulated. 
Accordingly,  we  mapped  the  data  by  coding  the  matters 
on these factors.

Results

Eleven experts participated in the interviews and provided 
feedback on the draft taxonomy. The participant character-
istics are presented in Table 1. The final taxonomy is pre-
sented in two formats. The Taxonomy Overview (Table 2) 
presents  a  one-page  summary  of  all  domains,  categories 
and  matters.  The  Detailed  Taxonomy  (Table  3)  also 
describes the Key Notes and coding for each matter, along 
with  a  numerical  identifier  of  which  participant(s)  dis-
cussed that matter.

provided in a mental health facility with overnight accom-
modation,  a  regulation  not  required  elsewhere.  This  will 
have direct implications for cost and accessibility, and there 
were conflicting views between participants as to whether 
this requirement was unnecessarily restrictive or necessary 
from a risk perspective.

Funding  presented  some  uncertainty,  with  a  course  of 
PAT expected to cost between AU$25,000 and AU$35,000 
(Chrysanthos,  2023).  It  seems  unlikely  that  PAT  will  be 
government-funded  under  current  reimbursement  mecha-
nisms,  and  review  of  private  health  insurance  reimburse-
ment, public hospital activity-based funding and Medicare 
items  (e.g.  if  the  treating  psychiatrist  must  be  present  for 
the entire treatment duration) will be required if PAT is to 
be at all accessible.

aSome participants were in more than one professional field, such that 
the sum of fields is greater than the total number of participants.

Practitioner

International  readers  should  note  that  Australia  has  a 
federal  (two-tier)  system  of  government  regulation,  with 
Federal  regulation  applying  across  the  country  and  State 
regulation  applying  only  within  that  jurisdiction.  In  the 
coding of the taxonomy, (F) is used to designate that Federal 
regulation applies to that matter and (S) is used to designate 
that State regulation applies. These include both formal leg-
islative  instruments  and  published  departmental  policies 
and procedures that in practice direct or constrain the oper-
ations of a health service and/or practitioner. (G) refers to 
guidelines  and  other  standardisation  documents  produced 
by non-government professional bodies.

The final taxonomy domains were Service Establishment, 
Practitioner,  Drug  Supply,  Patient  Evaluation,  Treatment 
Delivery  and  Service  Oversight.  A  description  of  each 
domain follows, together with a brief outline of what were 
considered the most pressing or contentious matters in each 
domain.

Service establishment

This domain contained matters that would likely be promi-
nent during establishment of a new PAT program within a 
health service. There were matters with relative regulatory 
uncertainty across almost the entire domain. A key example 
was the facility: although psychedelics are considered rela-
tively safe (Evans et al., 2023; cf. Schlag et al., 2022), there 
is uncertainty and a lack of consensus as to the determina-
tion  and  regulation  of  appropriate  facility  types  and  the 
accessibility of emergency care in clinics operating outside 
of a hospital environment. The TGA noted that administra-
tion and monitoring of treatment should be in an ‘accred-
ited  facility,  either  day  hospital  or  inpatient  setting  [our 
emphasis]’  (TGA,  2023b).  However,  one  jurisdiction  in 
Australia (NSW) has issued regulations requiring PAT to be 

This domain refers to the regulation of professionals who 
will administer and/or oversee the treatment, such as quali-
fications and training. Substantial uncertainties were identi-
fied, reflecting the fact that there is no established clinical 
framework for managing what will likely be a multidisci-
plinary practice. For example, the TGA guidance is nonspe-
cific as to which professions are eligible to provide therapy. 
RANZCP guidelines state that therapists must be registered 
with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency 
(AHPRA) or an equivalent governing body, but unhelpfully 
do  not  specify  what  these  other  ‘governing  bodies’  are. 
Furthermore, there are no consistently accepted standards 
or mechanisms for assessing what training would qualify a 
therapist to provide PAT, which may have implications for 
liability and insurance. Participants held conflicting views 
as to which professionals should be eligible to provide PAT, 
with what experience, the amount of training and ongoing 
professional  development  required  and  how  accreditation 
should operate.

Drug supply

This domain refers to mechanisms for obtaining and sup-
plying the actual compounds. There was greater certainty in 
this domain, as the existing regulatory systems for Schedule 
8 substance are relatively defined (albeit with some com-
plexity).  There  are  notable  differences  between  States  in 
terms  of  additional  requirements  to  prescribe  the  sub-
stances, with some States requiring authorisation (NSW) or 
notification  (Victoria)  on  a  per  patient  basis,  and  other 
States  (such  as  Queensland)  not  imposing  any  further 
requirements.  However,  there  was  no  real  contention 
among  participants  about  these  matters,  as  most  viewed 
them as fixed and ultimately workable (if at times cumber-
some) administrative requirements.

Patient evaluation

This domain refers to those matters that would arise in the 
process of evaluating and accepting a patient for a course of 
PAT.  This  domain  is  relatively  unregulated  and,  for  the 
most  part,  participants  did  not  hold  strongly  conflicting 
views about the need for further regulation. It would seem 
participants  felt  this  was  an  area  where  existing  clinical 
guidelines  and  professional  judgement  was  sufficient  to 
enable evaluation of patients for the indicated and approved 
conditions,  albeit  there  was  some  practical  uncertainty  in 
relation to the screening of patients.

Treatment delivery

This domain contains matters that would arise during the 
provision  of  the  treatment  itself.  There  was  substantial 
uncertainty along with conflicting participant views in rela-
tion to matters in this domain, perhaps unsurprisingly given 
PAT has to date only been delivered in clinical trial settings. 
For  instance,  there  is  some  confusion  as  to  the  allowable 
composition  of  the  treating  team,  with  the  TGA  (2023a) 
suggesting  a  minimum  qualification  of  clinical  psycholo-
gist  for  those  with  ‘patient  oversight’,  and  the  RANZCP 
(2023)  guidelines  requiring  that  at  least  one  of  the  thera-
pists is a medical practitioner. AMAPP’s (2023a) proposed 
composition requires at least one of the treating therapists 
to  hold  AHPRA  registration  (from  any  profession)  com-
bined with PAT-specific training. There are also several as-
yet  unregulated  matters  where  conflicting  views  were 
expressed as to whether and how they should be regulated, 
such as whether a therapist should be able to continue pro-
viding psychotherapy to a patient following cessation of the 
formal integration sessions.

Service oversight

This domain includes administrative or compliance matters 
where regulation imposes ongoing requirements not relat-
ing to the actual treatment of a specific patient. Participants 
identified some uncertainty in this domain, such as whether 
a health service or practitioner can use general terms like 
‘psychedelic  therapy’  without  directly  naming  the  sub-
stances  when  describing  its  services  or  providing  public-
facing  materials.  Relevantly,  the  Therapeutic  Goods  Act 
1989 prohibits direct advertising of prescription-only medi-
cines, and there have been a number of recent proceedings 
and convictions of medicinal cannabis providers for breach 
of these regulation (TGA, n.d.).

Discussion

We developed a taxonomy of 102 matters relevant to PAT 
that  are  or  could  be  regulated,  structured  into  six  broad 
domains and a number of categories. Our analysis revealed

uncertainty  and  contention  to  varying  degrees  across  the 
domains. We emphasise that this was not a quantitative pro-
cess,  so  we  have  not  made  any  quantitative  comparisons 
between  the  domains.  We  also  emphasise  that,  while  the 
domains  were  intended  to  structure  the  matters  in  a 
sequence  that  a  health  service  might  logically  follow,  in 
practice the domains are not in fact independent, and any 
number  of  the  uncertainties  identified  might  be  concur-
rently operating. Readers are encouraged to consult the full 
taxonomy  for  an  appreciation  of  all  matters  that  may  be 
relevant to them. Nonetheless, we felt there were some par-
ticularly important or pressing matters that warrant further 
discussion.

Current regulation stipulates that only psychiatrists may 
apply  for AP  status,  with  an  expectation  that  the AP  will 
‘provide  ongoing  psychotherapeutic  management’  (TGA, 
2023a) rather than simply prescribing and then delegating 
the psychotherapy aspects of the treatment entirely to oth-
ers.  The  wisdom  of  this  requirement  was  questioned  by 
some  participants,  who  pointed  out  that  psychiatry  is 
already  undersubscribed  and  overburdened.  They  sug-
gested  that  other  professionals  may  be  equally  placed  to 
perform  these  responsibilities,  such  as  psychologists,  or 
other medical practitioners like addiction medicine special-
ists or general practitioners with mental health credentials. 
Relatedly, the requirement that at least one of the therapists 
is  a  medical  practitioner  (RANZCP,  2023)  may  add  sub-
stantial cost to a treatment course and so potentially con-
tribute to further inequities in treatment access. We are not 
aware of any research suggesting that patients of medical 
practitioners have more positive outcomes relative to other 
mental health professionals in the psychotherapeutic man-
agement of PAT.

It was observed by some participants that, while it may 
seem  self-evident  that  regulation  is  required  to  appropri-
ately manage the risks of PAT – and to protect the public 
from unscrupulous operators – it is also arguable that some 
matters may be best left unregulated, particularly while the 
treatment  is  still  largely  experimental  and  while  many 
questions remain to be addressed through further research. 
For  example,  while  it  might  seem  desirable  to  regulate 
some kind of minimum standards in terms of psychothera-
peutic support, overregulation at this point could have the 
effect of stifling further exploration of therapeutic models, 
with the potential for undesirable consequences in terms of 
reduced  treatment  efficacy  and  increased  cost.  Some  par-
ticipants (who were health professionals themselves) also 
raised the danger of ‘overmedicalisation’ of PAT whereby, 
due  to  inflexible  regulatory  standardisation,  the  therapy 
becomes  only  available  in  ‘one-size-fits-all’  protocols 
administered  by  doctors  ill-suited  to  deal  with  the  wide 
range of experiences these substances elicit. Given the pro-
found,  often  spiritual,  frequently  challenging  and  highly 
personal  nature  of  these  experiences  (Kelly  et al.,  2021) 
together with their tendency to increase suggestibility and

vulnerability to influence including from those who admin-
ister the therapy (Cavarra et al., 2022; Palitsky et al., 2023), 
the medical model itself may carry a risk of harm if these 
issues are not appropriately considered.

On the other hand, and perhaps unsurprisingly given the 
novelty of the treatment and the speed at which the schedul-
ing changes were implemented by the TGA (Kisely, 2023), 
participants also identified the risks of under-regulation of 
certain matters. A key example is the matter of training and 
credentialing: while both RANZCP (2023) and APS (2023) 
concur  that  appropriate  training  is  required  for  all  thera-
pists, at the time of publication there is no clear direction as 
to what constitutes appropriate training, nor are there regu-
latory systems for evaluating the growing number of PAT 
training  programs  available  in  Australia  and  online. 
Furthermore, neither RANZCP nor APS (nor any other pre-
existing body) may be well-positioned for this task, given it 
would need to cover practitioners from a range of profes-
sions outside their formal remit. AMAPP (2023a) has pro-
posed  that  it  acts  as  an  independent  cross-disciplinary 
credentialing body; notably, an analogous system of trans-
professional  credentialing  is  being  established  for  practi-
tioners who have training and experience in treating eating 
disorders (Hurst et al., 2022).

Several limitations to this study warrant consideration. 
First, it is possible that the sampling pool was overly repre-
sented by those in clinical research and drug development, 
which may have led to a bias that precluded the identifica-
tion  of  other  relevant  matters.  However,  given  the  unex-
pectedly  speedy  down-scheduling  by  the  TGA  together 
with  the  peculiarities  of  implementing  PAT  into  clinical 
practice,  people  closely  involved  in  the  current  clinical 
research space were arguably those who could provide the 
most  relevant  data.  Relatedly,  a  more  in-depth  thematic 
analysis  might  have  uncovered  matters  not  obviously 
apparent in the data we reviewed. However, most matters 
were relatively straightforward, at least in terms of identi-
fying  and  defining  them,  and  appeared  across  multiple 
sources. This suggests other approaches would have been 
unlikely 
substantial  additional  matters. 
Accordingly, we are confident the approach taken was suf-
ficiently robust, particularly in the context of the need for a 
timely review in a rapidly evolving policy environment.

to 

authority (Lomax, 2017). Examining gaps in regulation and 
implementation in historic cases may be vital to building a 
safer system for patients in the contemporary era.

Future directions might include a study to systematically 
acquire  feedback  on  the  desirability  of  further  regulation 
for those matters where there is currently uncertainty and/
or conflicting views, e.g. via written surveys using numeri-
cal scales that are distributed to a wider range and number 
of health professionals. In addition, the taxonomy itself will 
likely become quickly out-of-date, given the speed at which 
this  field  is  developing. Accordingly,  it  may  be  useful  to 
periodically review and update the taxonomy.

To our knowledge, our study is the first to systematically 
identify and consolidate the regulatory matters relevant to 
PAT. The specificity of our taxonomy to the Australian con-
text means it may be useful for Australian health services to 
scope and cost the establishment and ongoing delivery of a 
regulatory-compliant PAT program. It may be a convenient 
roadmap for a psychiatrist preparing an AP application and/
or  during  the  implementation  phase  of  a  program. 
Regulatory bodies may find use in the taxonomy as a start-
ing point for determining whether there are any regulatory 
or  policy  gaps,  and  private  insurers  may  find  it  useful  to 
orient  themselves  to  the  regulatory  requirements  when 
determining  the  scope  of  coverage  they  may  provide. 
Finally, professional bodies may make use of the taxonomy 
to review and update their guidelines.

In  conclusion,  we  were  able  to  identify  a  comprehen-
sive set of regulatory matters relating to PAT, and structure 
these in a format that enables both a quick survey of the 
field  and  more  detailed  analyses.  Crucially,  the  project 
demonstrated  that  there  are  many  uncertainties,  and  in 
some  cases  conflicting  views,  as  to  how  certain  matters 
could or should be regulated. The taxonomy thus remains 
a  work  in  progress,  mirroring  the  field  itself.  Regulation 
may be somewhat indiscriminate, but it is one of the few 
tools  available  to  ensure  patient  safety  and,  hopefully, 
equity in the medical use of psychedelics. The taxonomy 
in this paper is intended to bring the regulatory considera-
tions and possibilities into greater focus, in the hope that 
this will ultimately improve outcomes for patients receiv-
ing psychedelic treatments.

In addition, substantial components of the psychothera-
peutic  components  of  modern  PAT  clinical  trials  derive 
from so-called ‘underground’ uses in the era of prohibition, 
in conjunction with methods developed in the 1950s–1970s 
when LSD was widely researched in psychiatric use. There 
are likely experiences and expertise from underground and 
historic  use  that  are  relevant  to  developing  contemporary 
systems  of  regulation  that  we  did  not  obtain  through  our 
sampling.  Notably,  in Australia  abuses  involving  LSD  at 
the Newhaven Hospital in the late 1960s and early 1970s 
occurred  under  an  authorised  prescriber  scheme  that  had 
the semblance of stringent oversight but lacked substantive
