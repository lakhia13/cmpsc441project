The  Emerging  Neurobiology  of  Bipolar
Disorder

Paul  J.  Harrison,1,2,* John  R.  Geddes,1,2 and  Elizabeth  M.  Tunbridge1,2

Bipolar  disorder  (BD)  is  a  leading  cause  of  global  disability.  Its  biological  basis
is  unknown,  and  its  treatment  unsatisfactory.  Here,  we  review  two  recent  areas
of  progress.  First,  the  discovery  of  risk  genes  and  their  implications,  with  a
focus  on  voltage-gated  calcium  channels  as  part  of  the  disease  process  and  as
a  drug  target.  Second,  facilitated  by  new  technologies,  it  is  increasingly  appar-
ent  that  the  bipolar  phenotype  is  more  complex  and  nuanced  than  simply  one  of
recurring  manic  and  depressive  episodes.  One  such  feature  is  persistent  mood
instability,  and  efforts  are  underway  to  understand  its  mechanisms  and  its
therapeutic  potential.  BD  illustrates  how  psychiatry  is  being  transformed  by
contemporary  neuroscience,  genomics,  and  digital  approaches.

Bipolar  Disorder  and  the  New  Psychiatry
Psychiatry  still  relies 
largely  on  19th-Century  diagnostic  categories.  These  are  based  on
clusters  of  symptoms  rather  than  biological  markers,  and  are  treated  with  drugs  discovered
serendipitously  several  decades  ago.  BD  typiﬁes  this  unsatisfactory  state  of  affairs.  Although  its
name  has  changed  [it  was  formerly  known  as  manic  depression  (see  Glossary)],  its  cardinal
features,  and  how  it  is  assessed  and  treated  (Box  1)  have  barely  altered.  An  important  reason
for  this  stagnation  has  been  the  lack  of  any  real  traction  on  its  causes  and  underlying  biology,
beyond  its  well-established  high  heritability  [1].  Although  there  is  evidence  for  altered  structural
and  functional  brain  connectivity  [2–4],  and  changes  in  markers  of  oxidative  stress  [5],  mito-
chondrial  function  [6], 
it  remains
difﬁcult  to  integrate  these  diverse 
ﬁndings,  and  to  disentangle  causative  changes  from  those
that  are  secondary  to  the  disorder  and  its  treatment.

Trends
BD  is  highly  heritable  and  mostly  attri-
butable  to  common  variants  of  small
effect.  Several  risk  genes  and  gene
networks  have  been  identiﬁed.

Calcium  signalling  is  prominent  among
the  genetic  risk  pathways,  and  cur-
rently  appears  to  have  the  greatest
therapeutic  traction.

Digital  technologies  and  sophisticated
mathematical  and  computational  ana-
lyses  are  being  used  to  quantify  and
understand  BD.

These  new  methods  reﬂect,  and  are

Box  1.  Bipolar  Disorder:  A  Clinical  Primer
The  classic  picture  of  BD  is  like  a  modiﬁed  sine  wave,  with  mood 
ﬂuctuating  between  episodes  of  mood  elevation
(mania)  and  depression,  interspersed  with  periods  of  euthymia.  The  number  of  episodes  in  each  mood  phase,  and  their
duration,  varies  markedly  between  individuals,  but  for  most  patients  the  depressive  episodes  are  more  prolonged  and
are  responsible  for  much  of  the  morbidity  of  the  disorder.

‘ordinary’

‘Hypomania’

The  depressive  episodes  of  BD  are  broadly  similar  in  nature  and  severity  to  those  of 
  depression.  A  manic
episode  includes  not  only  signiﬁcant  elevation  of  mood,  but  also  related  changes  in  behaviour,  such  as  a  reduced  need
for  sleep,  increased  energy,  grandiose  thoughts  and  beliefs,  rapid  speech,  increased  libido,  and  reckless  behaviour  (e.
g.,  spending  excessively).  In  severe  episodes,  psychotic  symptoms  (delusions  and  hallucinations)  may  also  be  present;
for  example,  the  person  may  believe,  or  hear  voices  telling  them,  that  they  have  superpowers  (and  they  may  then  act
accordingly). 
  refers  to  a  milder  and  less  prolonged  form  of  mania.  The  exact  criteria  depend  upon  the
classiﬁcatory  system  used  (ICD-10  or  DSM-5);  the  latter  subdivides  BD  into  bipolar  I  and  bipolar  II.  Although  not  part  of
ﬁrst  episode  and  persists  during
the  diagnostic  criteria,  cognitive  impairment  is  a  notable  aspect  of  BD;  it  is  present  at 
ﬂuency  are  the  domains  most  affected.  At  least  half  of
euthymia.  Attention,  processing  speed,  and  verbal  learning  and 
patients  with  BD  also  have  an  anxiety  disorder  or  substance  use  disorder.  Patients  are  typically  diagnosed  during  their
20s,  following  a  long  prodrome,  and  actual  onset  is  often  in  adolescence.  The  lifetime  prevalence  of  BD  is  approximately
1%,  rising  to  4%  if  a  broader  deﬁnition  of  bipolar  spectrum  disorder  is  used.  The  major  risk  factors  are  genetic  (see  the
main  text),  but  environmental  factors,  including  childhood  adversity,  also  have  a  role.  Of  patients  with  BD,  10%  die  by
suicide  and  this,  coupled  with  an  excess  mortality  from  natural  causes,  shortens  average  life  expectancy  by  approxi-
mately  15  years.

The  mainstay  of  BD  treatment  is  pharmacological,  with  lithium  salts  or  the  antiepileptic  drug  sodium  valproate  used  for
prophylaxis.  Antipsychotics,  antidepressants,  and  antiepileptic  drugs  are  given  to  treat  the  mood  episodes.  Psychoe-
ducation  and  psychological  treatments  also  have  an  important  supporting  role.  All  current  treatments  have  limited
efﬁcacy,  and  the  drugs  can  have  serious  adverse  effects.

For  an  introduction  to  clinical  aspects  of  BD,  see  [10,95].

sample  sizes  remain  small  by  GWAS  standards,  and  more  loci  remain  to  be  identiﬁed;  indeed,
the  forthcoming  Psychiatric  Genomics  Consortium  analysis,  comprising  over  20  000  BD  cases
and  30  000  controls,  identiﬁes  19  signiﬁcant  loci,  including  12  novel  ones.  Initial  exome  and
genome  sequencing  data  suggest  that  rare  deleterious  variants  also  have  a  role  in  some  BD
cases,  but  their  identity  and  overall  contribution  to  the  disorder  remain  unclear  [12–14].  Within
BD,  there 
is  modest  clinicogenetic  heterogeneity,  for  example,  based  on  the  predominant
symptoms,  or  between  bipolar  I  and  bipolar  II  subtypes  [15].  However,  there  is  little  evidence
for  BD-speciﬁc  genes;  joint  GWAS  analyses  show  substantial  commonalities  in  risk  loci  for  BD
and  schizophrenia  [16],  as  well  as  signiﬁcant  overlap  with  other  major  psychiatric  disorders  [17]
and  with  intermediate  phenotypes,  including  circadian  traits  [18,19].  One  distinction  between
schizophrenia  and  BD  is  that  copy  number  variation  is  much  less  prominent  in  the  latter  [20].

Although  the  genomics  of  BD  are 
in  their 
infancy,  efforts  have  begun  to  understand  the
identiﬁed  to  date.  Interest  has  centred  on  two  genes
biological  basis  for  the  associations 
(CACNA1C  and  ANK3)  because  of  what  was  already  known  of  their  functions.  CACNA1C  is
discussed 
in  detail  below.  ANK3  encodes  ankyrin  G,  which  couples  axonal  voltage-gated
sodium  channels  to  the  cytoskeleton  and  also  has  roles  in  dendrites  and  glia;  another  risk  gene,
TRANK1,  contains  multiple  ankyrin  repeat  domains,  suggesting  some  shared 
functions.
Complementing  the  focus  on  speciﬁc  risk  genes,  the 
ﬁrst  attempts  have  been  made  to  identify
the  pathways  that  they  inﬂuence.  Using  data  from  four  of  the  GWAS,  Nurnberger  et  al.  [21]
reported  six  pathways  that  showed  replicable  association  with  BD,  involving  glutamate  and
ﬁndings  support  the
calcium  signalling,  second  messengers,  and  hormones.  Together,  these

signalling  is  important  [23].

Box  2.  VGCC  Genes,  Their  Isoforms,  and  Relevance  in  Bipolar  Disorder
Identifying  the  speciﬁc  VGCCs  most  relevant  for  BD  is  a  signiﬁcant  challenge,  because  their  genes  give  rise  to  a  vast
diversity  of  functional  channels  (named  Cav channels)  [96,97].  VGCCs  comprise  multiple  subunits,  each  encoded  by
a1  subunits  (encoded  by  the  CACNA1-  gene
one  of  a  subfamily  of  separate  genes.  The  properties  of  the  ten  distinct 
family)  depend  on  the  accessory  subunits  to  which  it  is  bound  (Figure  I).  The  main  accessory  subunits  are  the

antagonists  block  the  L-type  channels;  the  anticonvulsant/analgesic  drugs  pregabalin  and  gabapentin  are 
  ligands
[30].

Further  channel  diversity  arises  because  each  gene  gives  rise  to  multiple  isoforms.  The  human  CACNA1C  mRNA  has  at
least  50  exons  and  over  40  predicted 
isoforms  (arising  from  transcriptional  and  splicing  mechanisms).  CACNA1C
splicing  gives  rise  to  channel  isoforms  that  are  differentially  expressed  in  brain  compared  with  heart,  and  which  differ  in
their  biophysical  properties,  including  voltage-gating  characteristics  [97].  Another  feature  affected  by  splicing  is  the
isoform  sensitivity  to  existing  VGCC  antagonists  [98].  This  suggests  that  it  might  be  possible  to  selectively  target  splice
variants  that  mediate  disease  risk  and/or  are  preferentially  expressed  in  the  brain,  compared  with  peripheral  tissues
(particularly  the  cardiovascular  system,  where  VGCCs  are  also  abundant),  thereby  maximising  their  therapeutic  potential
and  tolerability  in  BD  [25].

Given  these  considerations,  deﬁning  the  repertoire  of  VGCCs  present  in  different  human  tissues  is  important,  as  is
identifying  which  ones  are  impacted  by  the  BD-associated  risk  variants  or  by  BD  itself.  However,  information  on  the
transcript  diversity  of  human  VGCC  subunits  is  sparse,  particularly  in  brain.  Furthermore,  because  VGCC  subunit  genes

BD  by  rare  variant  studies  [13].  Of  note,  apart  from  BD,  CACNA1C  is  associated  with  schizo-
phrenia  [34]  and  major  depression  [35],  and  CACNB2  confers  susceptibility  to  multiple  psychiatric
disorders  [17].  Involvement  of  VGCC  genes  has  also  been  reported  in  large-scale  genomic  studies
of  BD-relevant  phenotypes,  such  as  working  memory  performance  and  the  associated  patterns  of
brain  activation  [36],  as  well  as 
in  general  cognitive  functioning  [37].  There  are  also  smaller
candidate  gene  studies  that  suggest  effects  of  CACNA1C  genetic  variation  on  brain  imaging
phenotypes  [38,39]  and  on  cognitive  domains,  such  as  reward  responsiveness  [40].

Identiﬁcation  of  the  molecular  basis  for  disease  associations  is  a  key  step  in  understanding  the
mechanisms  linking  VGCC  genes  with  BD.  The  VGCC  loci  revealed  by  GWAS  are  noncoding,
and  while  large-scale  exome  studies  may  identify  rare  variants  that  disrupt  the  coding  sequence
of  VGCCs,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  BD-associated  GWAS  loci  tag  as-yet-unidentiﬁed,  disease-
inﬂuencing  aspects  of  gene  expression,
causing  mutations.  Instead,  they  probably  act  by 
including  methylation  [41],  alternative  promoter  usage,  and  RNA  splicing  [42].  In  the  case  of
CACNA1C,  the  index  risk  polymorphism  for  BD  (rs1006737)  is  located  in  the  third  intron.  On
balance,  the  available  data  indicate  that  the  risk  allele  is  associated  with  enhanced  expression
and  activity  of  the  gene  product  [43,44],  but  there  are  conﬂicting 
ﬁndings  [45,46],  precluding
ﬁrm  conclusions.  Some  of  the  variability  in  these  results  may  be  due  to  differences  in  the  effect
of  rs1006737  on  CACNA1C  expression  between  brain  regions.  Inconsistencies  may  also  result
from  the  risk  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  differentially  altering  the  abundance  of
particular  splice  variants,  as  has  been  observed  for  other  BD-relevant  genes,  including  ANK3
[47]  and  ZNF804A  [48].  In  the  case  of  ANK3,  there  is  evidence  that  the  shift  in  isoform  ratios  has

the  limited  information  about  their  isoform  proﬁle  in  the  human  brain  (Box  2).  This  information  is
critical  since  splicing  patterns  are  poorly  conserved  and  the  brain  shows  one  of  the  greatest
diversities  of  alternative  splicing  [50],  meaning  that  the  current  data,  which  pertain  to  other

is  also  crucial.  This  requires  the
use  of  appropriate  cellular  and  animal  model  systems,  as  well  as  in  vivo  approaches  in  humans.
For  cellular  analyses,  in  addition  to  standard  cell  lines,  which  are  useful  for  studying  the  function
of  individual  genes,  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells  (iPSCs)  may  prove  valuable.  Indeed,  iPSC-
derived  neurons  have  already  provided  intriguing  data  to  support  the  presence  of  cellular  BD-
related  phenotypes,  including  alterations  in  calcium  signalling  (Box  3).

The  molecular 
or  lacking  speciﬁc  VGCC  genes  [51–53]  or  splice  variants  thereof  [54],  in  which  their  functional
impact  can  be  studied  in  the  intact  animal.  For  example,  embryonic  deletion  of  Cacna1c  from
forebrain  glutamatergic  neurons 
in  mice  produced  BD-relevant  behavioural  and  cognitive
effects  and  an  increased  susceptibility  to  stress,  whereas  the  same  deletion  during  adulthood
caused  a  lesser  and,  in  some  instances,  opposite  phenotype  [51].  This  effect  of  developmental
stage  on  the  phenotype  is  intriguing,  given  the  characteristic  early  adulthood  age  of  BD  onset,
and  its  childhood  antecedents  (Box  1).  In  a  separate  study,  the  phenotype  of  Cacna1c-deﬁcient
mice  could  be  rescued  using  a  small-molecule  inhibitor  of  the  translation  initiation  factor  eIF2a
[52],  giving  clues  as  to  the  possible  intervening  biochemical  mechanisms.

In  parallel  with  these  various  genetically  driven  approaches,  pharmacological  investigations  of

Box  3.  Stem  Cells  and  the  Calcium  Pathophysiology  of  Bipolar  Disorder

The  potential  of  iPSCs  for  studying  cellular  phenotypes  of  psychiatric  disorders  such  as  BD  is  considerable,  and  the
approach  has  already  been  exploited  in  several  studies.  These  have  been  of  three  designs:  comparison  of  BD  with
healthy  patients;  contrasting  lithium-responsive  versus  lithium-unresponsive  BD  cases;  or  evaluating  the  effect  of  BD
risk  genotypes  (reviewed  in  [99]).

Mertens  et  al. 
[100]  generated  dentate  gyrus-like  neurons  and  showed  that  cells  from  patients  with  BD  were
hyperexcitable,  with  differences  in  several  electrophysiological  and  transcriptional  parameters;  moreover,  the  excitability
was  normalised  by  lithium,  but  only  in  cells  derived  from  patients  who  had  responded  clinically  to  the  drug.  Notably,
ﬁndings  were  largely  replicated  in  a  separate  cohort  and  using  a  different  methodology  [101].  Taking  a  genetic

strategy,  Yoshimizu  et  al.  [44]  made 
induced  neurons  from  24  people,  genotyped  for  the  CACNA1C  rs1006737
polymorphism,  and  showed  that  CACNA1C  gene  expression  and  calcium  current  density  were  greater  in  risk  allele

be  used  as  experimental  tools  and  for  proof-of-principle  studies.  Their  availability  is  a  distinct
advantage  compared  with  most  other  genetically  supported  therapeutic  targets 
in  BD,  for
which  no  such  drugs  are  available.  To  date,  the  clinical  trial  data  linking  L-type  VGCC  blockade
with  therapeutic  outcome  in  BD  (and,  indeed,  their  psychiatric  effects  more  generally)  are  wholly
inconclusive  [25].  Hence,  a  priority  is  to  investigate  in  detail  the  impact  of  brain-penetrant  VGCC
blockers  on  BD-relevant  phenotypes,  including  detailed  measures  of  mood,  cognition,  sleep,
and  brain  activity  [55],  and  with  the  incorporation  of  genotype  as  a  factor  [56].  The  potential
psychiatric  effects  of  VGCC  antagonists  can  also  be  assessed  using  routinely  collected  clinical
data;  for  example,  a  study  of  electronic  medical  records  in  Scotland  reported  higher  hospital
admission  rates  for  depression  in  patients  given  VGCCs  compared  with  those  prescribed  other
antihypertensives  [57].

In  summary,  a  range  of  methods  are  needed  to  make  the  most  of  the  genomic  discoveries  in
BD,  to  understand  their  molecular  mechanisms  and 
implications  for  cellular  and  systems
functioning,  and  to  evaluate  their  therapeutic  potential.  The  conceptual  approach  is  illustrated
in  Figure  1  (Key  Figure),  which  uses  VGCCs  as  the  exemplar.

New  Approaches  to  the  Bipolar  Phenotype
Digital  Psychiatry
Complementing  the  developments  from  genomics-driven  discovery  science,  novel  methods
are  being  applied  to  characterise  the  BD  phenotype,  and  thereby  provide  new  perspectives  on
its  key  elements.

Conventional  psychiatric  assessments  rely  on  cross-sectional,  retrospective  analysis  of  the
pattern  of  symptoms  over  weeks  or  months.  Being  based  on  a  patient’s  or  informant’s  recall,
this  approach  is  subject  to  inherent  biases  and  unreliability,  especially  when,  as  in  BD,  the  key

that  are  required  for  most  of  the  intervening  segments.

One  early  example  is  the  True  Colours  platform,  which  allows  patients  to  submit  (by  text,  email,
web,  or  app)  their  ratings  of  depression,  mania,  and  other  symptoms,  in  response  to  a  weekly  or
daily  prompt,  resulting  in  a  longitudinal  and  graphical  representation  of  symptom  course  [62].

Importantly,  smartphones  and  other  devices  allow  the  remote  capture  of  not  only  contempo-
raneous  self-reporting  of  symptoms,  but  also  behavioural,  cognitive  and  physiological  mea-
sures,  such  as  heart  rate,  activity,  geolocation,  speech,  and  environmental  interactions  [63–68].
In  turn,  digital  methods  can  facilitate  a  change  from  entirely  symptom-based  characterisation  of
psychiatric  disorders,  such  as  BD,  towards  a  more  multimodal,  biologically  informed  one.  Thus,
they  raise  the  prospect  of  more-objective,  data-driven  diagnoses,  and  ultimately  personalised
predictions  of  illness  and  treatment  response.  However,  this  promise  has  yet  to  be  realised;  the
initial  hype  about  digital  phenotyping,  including  its  application  to  BD,  has  been  tempered  by
increasing  awareness  of  the  signiﬁcant  technical,  analytical,  and  other  issues  involved  (Box  4).

Persistent  Mood  Instability
Notwithstanding  the  many  challenges,  the  longitudinal,  long-term  collection  of  data  using  digital
approaches  has  already  contributed  to  a  renewed  focus  on  the 
  phenotype  of  BD.
One  example  is  the  appreciation  that  many  patients  have  chronic  mood  instability  (also  called
affective 
lability),  persisting  during  euthymia.  This  contrasts  with  the  simplistic  textbook
description  of  BD  as  comprising  periods  of  normal,  stable  mood 
in  between  the  episodes
of  depression  and  mania  (Box  1).  Although  this  reality  was  already  appreciated  by  experienced
clinicians  [69,70],  it  is  the  use  of  digital  methods  that  has  led  to  a  greater  awareness  of  mood
instability,  which  in  turn  has  encouraged  research  to  understand  its  origins  and  signiﬁcance.
Here,  we  brieﬂy  review  some  of  these  implications.

‘real-world’

Mood  (in)stability  is  a  continuous  variable,  and  is  present  to  varying  extents  in  healthy  individuals
[71,72].  Therefore,  it  is  a  useful  phenotype  for  studies  seeking  to  identify  mechanisms  under-
lying  mood  (dys)regulation  per  se,  and  a  range  of  experimental  approaches  are  being  taken.  For
example,  it  can  be  viewed  from  a  computational  perspective,  with  models  showing  how  mood

Box  4.  Digital  and  Mathematical  Approaches  to  Bipolar  Disorder

Collection  of  multidimensional  data,  as 
in  the  remote  monitoring  of  symptoms,  behaviours,  and  physiology,  has
considerable  potential  in  the  study  and  treatment  of  BD  and  other  disorders,  but  also  throws  up  several  signiﬁcant
challenges  [105,106].

First,  there  are  many  technical  and  practical 
issues  to  overcome,  ranging  from  ensuring  the  compatibility  of  data
collection  between  operating  systems  and  software  versions,  to  maintaining  compliance  over  long  time  periods.  There
are  also  privacy,  acceptability,  and  engagement  issues  raised  by  the  recording  and  storage  of  personal  data  [107].

Second,  the  resulting  data  sets  are  large  and  complex,  and  the  extraction,  analysis,  and  interpretation  of  information  are
not  straightforward  [108].  One  key  question  to  consider  is  the  mathematical  approach  chosen  for  analysing  the  data.
Options  include  linear  and  nonlinear  time  series  methods  [109–111]  as  well  as  more-ﬂexible  and  advanced  techniques,
such  as  relaxation  oscillator  frameworks  [112]  and  machine-learning  methods  [90].  Another  mathematical  technique  of
interest  is  rough  paths  theory  [113].  By  taking  account  of  lead-lag  relationships,  rough  paths  can  reduce  time-stamped
‘signature’.  This  trans-

mood  instability  relates  to  variation  in  neural  activity  across  a  range  of  temporal  resolutions,
using  functional  MRI  [74]  and  magnetoencephalography  [75].  In  addition,  mathematical  anal-
ﬂuctuations  in
yses,  such  as  those  outlined  in  Box  4,  can  help  explain  the  relationships  between 
mood  and  other  parameters,  ranging  from  environmental  exposures  to  behavioural  variables
[66,67].

Mood  instability  is  prominent  not  only  in  BD,  but  also  in  several  other  psychiatric  disorders,  such
as  attention  deﬁcit  disorder,  borderline  personality  disorder,  and  schizophrenia  [76,77].  It  is
therefore  a  trans-diagnostic  construct,  compatible  with  the  NIMH  Research  Domain  Criteria
project  [78].  Thus,  understanding  the  origins  and  mechanisms  of  mood 
instability,  and  the
biological  and  behavioural  sequelae  of  interventions  which  modify  it 
  is  therefore  likely  to  have
value  beyond  BD.

overlapping,  may  differ  sufﬁciently  between  disorders  [80]  to  help  gain  traction  on  the  underlying

stabilisation  could  prove  to  predict  therapeutic  efﬁcacy 
in  the  way  that  rapid  effects  on
emotional  processing  predict  subsequent  therapeutic  response  in  unipolar  depression  [81].
Moreover,  the  rapid  effects  of  antidepressants  on  emotional  processing  are  seen  in  euthymic
subjects  as  well  as  in  those  with  depression;  similarly,  new  treatments  for  BD,  such  as  novel

In  summary,  the  emergence  of  persistent  mood  instability  as  a  construct  illustrates  how  digital
methods  can  highlight  neglected  or  hard-to-characterise  psychiatric  phenomena,  and  stimu-
late  a  range  of  studies  into  their  origins,  mechanisms,  and  therapeutic  implications.  Compara-
ble  approaches  are  being  taken  to  other  components  of  BD,  such  as  circadian  dysregulation
and  reward  sensitivity.  Although  the  work  is  at  an  early  stage,  it  is  likely  ultimately  to  alter  the
view  of  the  core  phenotype  of  BD,  with  a  greater  role  for  biological  and  quantitative  data  in  BD
diagnosis,  prognosis,  and  management.

Concluding  Remarks
Our  understanding  of  BD  remains  frustratingly  limited.  It  continues  to  be  a  descriptive  syn-
drome,  since  we  lack  sufﬁcient  knowledge  to  allow  its  characterisation  or  conceptualisation
based  on  aetiology  or  mechanism.  Certainly,  many  questions  remain  (see  Outstanding  Ques-
tions).  However,  there  are  reasons  for  optimism.  First,  the  discovery  of  some  of  the  BD  risk

studies.  In  both  of  these  domains,  a  common  feature  is  the  increasing  importance  of 
whether  in  terms  of  the  genomic  studies,  or  the  multidimensional  data  streams  captured  by
digital  devices.  Third,  although  not  discussed  here,  structural  and  functional  brain  imaging  is
helping  to  identify  the  key  neural  circuits  of  BD  and  may  also  have  diagnostic  and  prognostic
value  [2–4,87–90].

The  ultimate  goal  of  these  contemporary  approaches  is  to  allow  a  more  scientiﬁcally  informed,

evidence-based  approach  to  how  BD

disorders  involving  lability  of  mood,  emotion,  and  behaviour;  the  inclusion  of  behavioural  and
physiological  correlates  of  mood  and  mood

It  is  not  always  appreciated  that  BD  causes  a  global  health  burden  comparable  with  that  of
schizophrenia  [92],  yet  it  has  attracted  considerably  less  research  funding  and  interest  from
policy  makers  [93].  We  would  argue  that,  for  various  reasons,  BD  currently  has  a  greater
potential  for  transformative  advances.  More  generally,  BD  is  a  useful  case  study  for  illustrating
how  psychiatric  disorders  are  belatedly  embarking  on  the 
journey  from  being  descriptive
syndromes  towards  more  neurobiologically  grounded,  quantitative,  and  digital  phenotypes
[94].  Despite  the  many  difﬁculties  this  process  entails,  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  hope  that  it  will
be  successful,  and  accompanied  by  the  development  of  more  rational,  effective,  and  person-
alised  treatments.
