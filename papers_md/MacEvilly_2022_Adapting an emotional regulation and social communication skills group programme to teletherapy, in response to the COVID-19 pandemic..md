Adapting an emotional regulation and social
communication skills group programme to teletherapy,
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented situation, whereby essential services within child and adolescent mental health
services (CAMHS) were suspended. This created a need to modify regular methods of treatment at a rapid pace, to avoid cessation
of clinical intervention and prevent potential regression in mental health. Eighteen children with moderate-to-severe mental health
disorders and their parents were attending weekly group cognitive behaviour therapy-based sessions (‘The Secret Agent Society’
programme) when the Irish Department of Health suspended face-to-face intervention. This report describes how the group
sessions were adapted to individualised, online therapeutic triads between each child, his/her parent and their clinician.
Whilst internet technology has emerged as a promising solution to shortfalls in therapy services, in-depth exploration is needed
to confirm the efficacy of telehealth for children attending CAMHS.

Introduction

The Secret Agent Society (SAS) is an espionage themed,
multimedia intervention programme, which uses
an evidence-based curriculum to improve children’s
emotional regulation and social communication skills
(Beaumont & Sofronoff, 2008). Developed in Australia,
international research base
SAS has a substantial
supporting its effectiveness for children aged eight
to twelve years with a range of neurodevelopmental
and anxiety disorders (Thomson et al. 2015; Sauve
et al. 2018; Beaumont et al. 2019). Based on the princi-
ples of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), SAS
teaches children how to recognise emotions in them-
selves and others, express feelings in appropriate
ways, talk and play with others, solve social problems
and manage bullying. The programme combines
multiple therapeutic modalities including weekly
group sessions for children, group parent training
sessions, a teacher training session, online access to
the SAS computer game, home/school practice mis-
sions and daily skill tracker cards, all of which help
to generalise children’s learning outcomes into real-
life experience. The intervention consists of nine
distinct topics (Table 1). SAS has been used to support
children with complex difficulties associated with

Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Anxiety Disorders.
Statistically significant improvements were reported
in the emotional regulation and social communica-
tion skills of fifty-one children attending SAS groups
in an Irish child and adolescent mental health service
(CAMHS) (MacEvilly et al. 2019).

SAS is traditionally delivered over nine weekly ses-
sions in small groups of approximately six children.
It was being delivered in this way within a CAMHS
setting prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
which subsequently led to the immediate cessation of
face-to-face therapeutic contact. Children continued
to show significant and at times escalating emotional
regulation difficulties at home. Therefore, an alterna-
tive method of service delivery was needed for the

duration of the COVID-19 crisis. A review of the liter-
ature revealed several variations in SAS small group
delivery, but none were deemed appropriate given
the therapeutic restrictions created by the pandemic.
For example, Weiss et al. (2018) examined the efficacy
of individually delivered SAS intervention to improve
mental health difficulties in sixty-eight Canadian
children with ASD, aged eight to twelve. Significant
improvements in the children’s emotional regulation
were noted. This one-to-one format was not an option
for the authors in the current global crisis as it entailed
face-to-face delivery. In another study, Sofronoff et al.
(2015) trained parents of forty-one Australian children
with ASD to be the principal facilitators of their child’s
SAS programme, using an instructional DVD and
weekly phone/Skype support. However, during this
mode of delivery, there was no interaction between cli-
nician and child, as it was entirely parent led. Published
SAS studies did not reflect the challenge faced by the
current authors who sought to provide SAS directly
to both the child and his/her parent, via real-time, inter-
active, individualised teletherapy.

There is a growing body of both national and
international evidence supporting the effectiveness
and feasibility of teletherapy for specialist interventions
(Gloff et al. 2015; Knutsen et al. 2016). The benefits of
TeleMental Health were also recently highlighted in
Ireland’s Mental Health Reform eMental Health docu-
ment (Cullen, 2018). The report refers to improved
access for those reluctant to avail of more traditional
forms of therapeutic service, higher cost efficiency
and increased user involvement and empowerment.
CBT in particular has been successfully delivered to
children via telehealth for a range of diverse diagno-
ses such as depression (Nelson et al. 2003), anxiety
disorders (Rooksby et al. 2015), obsessive–compulsive
disorders (Storch et al. 2011) and tic disorders (Himle
et al. 2012). The evidence base supporting the delivery
of speech and language intervention to primary
school children via telehealth is also growing rapidly
(Fairweather et al. 2016; Wales et al. 2017). However,
research into the provision of social communication
skills intervention via telehealth is limited and
centres predominantly around the feasibility of
parent training. Examples of this include Hanen
parent
2020),
parent-mediated intervention for children with ASD
(Ingersoll et al. 2017; Hao et al. 2020) and parent–child
interaction therapy (Comer et al. 2017). A study by
Rietdijk et al. (2019) ‘indicated potential’ for using
telehealth to provide social communication skills
training to adults with traumatic brain injury and their
families. However, there is a paucity of evidence for
the efficacy of social communication intervention

delivered remotely to children attending CAMHS and
their parents.

Amid significant changes to clinicians’ work practi-
ces and uncertainty about redeployment, the authors
aimed to prioritise families’ needs during the sudden
treatment gap imposed by COVID-19, while at the same
time maintaining SAS programme integrity. It was
therefore decided to pilot a new variant of SAS delivery,
namely adapting group clinic sessions to an individual-
ised, online therapeutic triad between each child, his/
her parent and clinician. Remote delivery of the pro-
gramme would allow intervention to take place in natu-
ral, ecologically valid settings convenient
for the
children and their families at a time of significant dis-
ruption and change. The intervention remains ongoing
at the time of writing this report.

Design

This is a description of an adapted intervention
programme designed in response to sudden restrictions
imposed on CAMHS clinics due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Clinicians considered the confidentiality
requirements of each family, possible behaviour man-
agement
issues arising from having a number of
children online simultaneously and the potential for
distractibility by the technology itself. It was therefore
decided to offer individual parent and child sessions
that were specifically tailored to each child’s family cir-
cumstances, in the home setting, where the skills would
be used. It was predicted that a therapeutic triad would
more effectively support family-centred interactions
than an online group format, as the clinician would
work in partnership with each child and his/her parent.
Given the fact that many families were already familiar
with online learning from school, it was anticipated that
they would be comfortable with videoconferencing
technology.

Participants

Participants were the existing cohort of families who
had already attended three sessions of group SAS in
CAMHS prior to clinic closure due to COVID-19.
Seventeen out of 18 families agreed to take part in the
adapted SAS programme at times/dates convenient
to them. One family opted to defer treatment until
face-to-face therapy provision became available, due
to concerns about their low level of computer skills.

Four clinicians were involved in the adaptation and
delivery process. All four clinicians are certified SAS
facilitators, three of whom are experienced Senior
Speech and Language Therapists. They have delivered
face-to-face SAS groups to over one hundred children

attending CAMHS to date. The fourth clinician is a
Clinical Nurse with a post graduate specialism in CBT.

Satisfaction measures

Evaluation is an established part of routine SAS inter-
vention. Each child’s parent and teacher had already
completed Spence’s Social Skills Questionnaire – Parent
(SSQ-P) and Teacher (SSQ-T) versions (1995) and the
Emotion Regulation and Social Skills Questionnaire –
(ERSSQ-P) and Teacher (ERSSQ-T) versions
Parent
(Beaumont & Sofronoff, 2008) prior to the commence-
ment of face-to-face group sessions. The children had
already completed two measures designed to assess
their knowledge of anxiety and anger management
strategies before the SAS groups commenced, as per
routine SAS evaluation protocol. These were ‘James
and the Maths Test’ (Attwood, 2004a) and ‘Dylan is being
Teased’ (Attwood, 2004b). Parents and children will be
asked to complete their measures again immediately
after teletherapy delivery and at three- and six-month
follow-up. Teacher questionnaires will not be requested
in light of school closures due to the COVID-19
pandemic.

Additional child and parent ratings of session satis-
faction were developed by the authors to gauge the
effectiveness of the adapted teletherapy. Children and
parents will be provided with these following the com-
pletion of the remote delivery programme. Children’s
measures were designed to be brief and provide an
opportunity to give feedback on what the children
liked/disliked about the new form of intervention,
how they might improve it and what skills they found
most valuable. Measures include simple Likert scales
(e.g. ‘I liked the sessions a little : : : .a lot : : : .not very much’)
and visuals (e.g. pictures of happy/sad faces) to sup-
port ease of completion. Parent satisfaction measures
include a rating of their child’s enjoyment of the tele-
therapy sessions, information regarding programme
effectiveness in terms of everyday use of skills learnt
via teletherapy and confidence in supporting their
child’s emotional regulation. Space has been provided
for parents to identify programme strengths and areas
for improvement. As well as the satisfaction measures,
clinicians will also carry out a qualitative interview
with each parent to obtain in-depth information regard-
ing their experiences of taking part in the adapted
intervention.

Teletherapy programme

Part 1: Setting the scene for remote delivery

With the existing research evidence in mind, clinicians
telephoned each parent to gauge interest in online
delivery of SAS and to ensure that conditions were

sufficiently favourable to ensure programme sustain-
ability. Possible barriers to taking part included com-
peting demands on parents’ time due to employment,
home-schooling commitments and provision of care
for siblings. Additional factors discussed were access
to Wi-Fi with a stable internet connection and a suf-
ficiently powerful device, household space and free-
dom from distraction, as well as possible additional
psychosocial stress and health concerns. Parents were
informed of the practice of telehealth, its benefits and
any risks that might be involved due to technological
malfunction and problems with confidentiality.

Parents were given the choice of deferring their
child’s involvement in the current SAS group until
COVID-19 restrictions were lifted or trialing the adapted
treatment format instead. Parents were reassured that
they and/or their child could drop out of the adapted
delivery at any time and re-engage in face-to-face group
intervention when feasible. Parents were reminded that
their help with SAS home practice activities remained
the best predictor of programme success (Beaumont &
Sofronoff, 2008) and that merely taking part in the tele-
therapy alone without home practice would be unlikely
to significantly improve their child’s emotional well-being
or social communication skills.

Part 2: Programme adaptation

Parents and children’s teachers had already attended
face-to-face group information sessions and had been
given training on the contents of the programme prior
to clinic closure. The children had been given their SAS
manuals and visual materials to support SAS skills
during their first three group sessions. The need for
a coordinated, collaborative approach between chil-
dren, parents, teachers and clinicians had already
been stressed from the outset. However, for remote
delivery of SAS to be optimally effective, a number
of programme adaptations were required to mini-
mise potential barriers to success.

First, the authors reviewed The American Academy
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guidelines on deliv-
ering telepsychiatry with young people (Myers & Cain,
2008) and the University of Oxford’s document on
video consultations (Greenhalgh et al. 2020). A written
guide about teletherapy was then devised, containing
an outline of what parents and children could expect
during the online sessions (e.g. that the child and
his/her parent would share a screen, that the parent
would take the lead to control the technology and min-
imise distraction). A social story (Gray, 2015) was spe-
cifically written to explain the sudden change of SAS
delivery to each child and to prepare him/her for tele-
therapy. SAS therapeutic resources, such as relaxation

cards, stress ball and an invisible ink pen, usually given
by clinicians during the groups were posted home to
each parent to give to their child during the sessions.
A practice call was made to each parent in advance
of
the first online session to check technology.
Contingency plans were established regarding what
to do if the video link failed (the clinician would con-
tact by phone instead). Informed consent was obtained
to ensure parents were aware of the potential hazards of
online platforms and attention was drawn to advice
from the Data Protection Commission, in line with
the Data Protection Act (2018).

Teletherapy session checklists were devised by
the authors and merged with existing SAS materials,
in combination with weekly consultation meetings
between facilitators. This ensured consistency of core
therapeutic targets across clinics/between clinicians
and allowed for adapted treatment fidelity. Sessions
were designed to last approximately 45 minutes to max-
imise children’s concentration and motivation levels.
The first session was designed to re-establish rapport
with the child in a relaxed, fun online atmosphere while
familiarising him/her with the materials provided
prior to clinic closure. For subsequent sessions, parents
were prompted to make a visual schedule for their child
to tick off as each task was completed. A brief ‘tech
check’ occurred before commencing each session.
Parents were expected to participate in all of the CBT
based and social communication tasks which took place
during the sessions. A token behaviour modification
system had already been established with parents prior
to starting the face-to-face groups and this system con-
tinued throughout remote delivery. Each child worked
towards a small, home-based reward, agreed with
parent and clinician at the outset of each session.
Sessions progressed from revising preliminary SAS
goals with each parent and child (such as recognising
and labelling emotions in self and others) to more com-
plex goals such as adjusting responses to difficult emo-
tions using emotional regulation strategies. Goals for

feelings,

the next session were chosen in collaboration with each
parent and child and guided by the SAS manual. Types
of individualised treatment goals included rating the
intensity of emotions on colourful visual paper scales
supplied, practising the use of coping strategies for
unpleasant
identifying negative thoughts
and replacing them with more helpful alternatives.
Each child completed tasks during and between ses-
sions in his/her SAS workbook with parental support.
Parents were encouraged to continue to prepare for
each session by reading their own parent manual in
advance and were reminded of the importance of inci-
dental teaching to optimise skill transfer from online
sessions to everyday life. Consideration was given to
issues pertaining to the social confinement imposed
due to COVID-19, such as an increase in children’s
aggressive meltdowns, a decrease in predictable rou-
tines and new demands of home schooling. A summary
of adaptations made to the face-to-face group pro-
gramme is shown in Table 2.

Part 3: Expected outcomes

The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented sit-
uation in terms of interruption of essential services
within CAMHS. This resulted in the need to modify tra-
ditional therapeutic methods at a rapid pace, thereby
avoiding cessation of intervention and potential regres-
sion in children’s mental health. The innovative use of
internet technology has emerged as a promising solu-
tion to shortfalls in therapy services, such as waiting

therapy sessions, such as reduction in children’s emo-

greater child reported knowledge of strategies to man-
age anger/anxiety. It is anticipated that there will be
increased parent, child and clinician confidence in
working together through an online platform, leading
to enhanced co-production between clinic and home.
Providing therapy through videoconferencing could
become a normalised method of treatment delivery.
Consideration may also be given to offering this mode
of teletherapy to children who are reluctant/unable to
attend CAMHS and to families living in remote areas.
Anticipated challenges with online delivery are that
it may be difficult for clinicians to pick up on subtle
changes in children’s emotions through a screen and
there is no face-to-face peer role modelling. The parent
will be relied upon to act as a co-therapist at times, such
as during role-plays and brainstorming. The social, sup-
portive elements of both the children’s and parent
group sessions will not be possible to replicate (e.g.
team games, informal chats at break time). Children’s
teachers were not involved in the telehealth delivery
as schools were closed. Technology may create its
own barriers, such as inadequate bandwidth or unreli-
able connectivity. However, despite these limitations, it
is anticipated that remote delivery of SAS will emerge
as an effective, empowering way of providing alterna-
tive methods of essential care to children and families
during a global emergency and beyond.

Conclusion

With careful planning and consultation with families,
adapting an established face-to-face emotional regula-
tion and social communication programme to telether-
apy can be achieved quickly in an unprecedented time.
Overall, telehealth is a cost-effective method of support-
ing continuity of care for families living in geographi-
cally remote areas or those reluctant/unable to utilise
traditional mental health services. In-depth exploration
and analysis of outcome measures are needed to con-
firm the efficacy of delivering the SAS programme
remotely to children with moderate-to-severe mental
health disorders. If this pilot intervention suggests that
teletherapy has a legitimate place in CAMHS, it may
provide a foundation for a randomised control trial
comparing face-to-face SAS intervention with remote
delivery.
