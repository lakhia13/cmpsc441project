Abstract

Introduction: Fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) is a phenomenon that affects people with

diabetes experiencing hypoglycemia. On the one hand, FOH is an adaptive mechanism

that helps to protect patients from hypoglycemia and its consequences. On the other

hand, the non-normative level of FOH causes anxiety and tension, disturbs normal

functioning, and makes normoglycemia maintenance difficult.

Objective: The main objective of this review was to describe factors influencing FOH

and methods of measurement of FOH levels. Moreover, we highlighted the impact of

the new technologies used in diabetes therapy on FOH and different therapeutic pos-

sibilities helping patients cope with excessive levels of FOH. We also presented clinical

cases of patients with high FOH levels met in clinical practice and discussed methods

to better diagnose and assist people with this kind of problem.

Methods: We searched for studies and articles via PubMed using the keywords fear of

hypoglycemia, diabetes, and hypoglycemia. From screened documents identified from

literature search, 67 articles were included in our review.

Results: We divided results from literature screening into five parts: fear of hypo-

glycemia and hypoglycemia definition, risk factors for the FOH, methods of measuring

levels of FOH, therapies for the FOH, and modern technologies. We also described

clinical examples of abnormal fear of hypoglycemia in patients.

Conclusion: The review highlights the importance of taking into consideration fear of

hypoglycemia phenomenon in diabetic patients in everyday clinical practice.

Definition

Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes may lead to hypoglycemia

unawareness, when the patient does not experience symptoms of

hypoglycemia despite low blood glucose levels. Therefore, patients

have more frequent and longer episodes of hypoglycemia, which they

are unaware of (Vignesh & Mohan, 2004). Recurrent episodes of
