Abstract

Objective: Smartphone apps (apps) are widely recognised as promising tools for improving access to mental healthcare.
However, a key challenge is the development of digital interventions that are acceptable to end users. Co-production
with providers and stakeholders is increasingly positioned as the gold standard for improving uptake, engagement, and
healthcare outcomes. Nevertheless, clear guidance around the process of co-production is lacking. The objectives of this
review were to: (i) present an overview of the methods and approaches to co-production when designing, producing,
and evaluating digital mental health interventions; and (ii) explore the barriers and facilitators affecting co-production in
this context.

Methods: A pre-registered (CRD42023414007) systematic review was completed in accordance with The Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Five databases were searched. A co-produced bespoke quality
appraisal tool was developed with an expert by experience to assess the quality of the co-production methods and
approaches. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

Results: Twenty-six studies across 24 digital mental health interventions met inclusion criteria. App interventions were rarely
co-produced with end users throughout all stages of design, development, and evaluation. Co-producing digital mental
health interventions added value by creating culturally sensitive and acceptable interventions. Reported challenges included
resource issues exacerbated by the digital nature of the intervention, variability across stakeholder suggestions, and power
imbalances between stakeholders and researchers.

Conclusions: Variation in approaches to co-producing digital mental health interventions is evident, with inconsistencies
between stakeholder groups involved, stage of involvement, stakeholders’ roles and methods employed.

Introduction
A global deﬁcit in access to mental health treatment, specif-
ically psychological support1 has led to the development,
evaluation, and/or deployment of digital mental health
including software applications
interventions (DMHIs),
(apps). A DMHI is deﬁned as an intervention delivering
information, support, or therapy for mental health condi-
tions through an electronic medium with the aim of treating,
alleviating, or managing mental health difﬁculties.2 DMHIs

have demonstrated efﬁcacy, supported by meta-analytic
evidence for a range of mental health difﬁculties, including
anxiety3 and depression.4,5 DMHIs are increasingly
regarded as viable alternatives to augment and expand the
delivery of mental healthcare.4,6

With the widespread availability of smartphones, apps
are increasingly being used to address the shortage of
access to psychological interventions. Although evidence
supports the use of apps for the delivery of DMHIs,7 app
use over more lengthy periods of time is not sustained.8
Misalignment between researchers’ aims and clinical
users’ needs has been shown to be a major contributing
factor to attrition9; speciﬁcally, lack of attention to individ-
ual user characteristics and poor app design.10 Additionally,
apps require users to be intrinsically motivated, as users
typically engage with apps in their own time.11 Therefore,
key to continued engagement is understanding end users’
needs and preferences.12 In this study, the term ‘end user’
is used to refer to the person who uses or is intended to
use the DMHI for mental health support.

Participatory methods provide one means of ensuring
that apps are designed to better meet users’ needs and there-
fore promote longer term engagement. The health literature
contains various participatory methods that involve differ-
ent approaches for collaboration between researchers and
stakeholders.13 The terminology for these methods is not
always consistent, with a multitude of terms used (often
interchangeably), including: patient and public involvement
(PPI), co-production, co-design and co-creation.14 In the
absence of a single agreed term, the term ‘co-production’
is used throughout this review. Despite inconsistency in
terms, a common principle underlines all methods of
co-production: ‘Nothing about us, without us’,15,p.1 with
an underlying ethos of developing with and not
for
users,16 by placing end users at the heart of the process.

following co-producing services and interventions. Notably,
their ﬁndings underscored the impact co-production had on
improved functioning, characterised by heightened auton-
omy, competence and relatedness – a congruence with the
tenets of self-determination theory.17

The importance of co-produced research is also increas-
ingly recognised by national agendas, including the UK’s
for Health and Care Research.18

Despite the growing recognition of the importance of

co-production processes.22 Additionally,
those DMHIs
that have been co-produced are often limited to involve-
in only the early and/or ﬁnal stage of research
ment
design/intervention development or delivery,23,24 which is
contradictory to the core principles of co-production.25
Consequently, many mental health apps are publicly
accessible from app stores and have many monthly active
lack sufﬁcient evidence regarding their
users,26 but
design, development, and evaluation.27 One possible
barrier in involving users in app design is that there is no
standardised guidance on how to involve stakeholders in
this process. There are several frameworks for involving
users in research more generally, but none focus speciﬁcally
on involving users in the design of DMHIs more speciﬁc-
ally. Involving users in the design of DMHIs can bring add-
itional complexity owing to the diverse and multitude of
stakeholders required, including researchers, service users
(or ‘end users’), health professionals and app developers.28
In terms of user involvement in research frameworks more
generally, the NIHR INVOLVE produced guidance around
co-producing research25 describing ﬁve key principles: (a)
the sharing of power; (b) inclusion of diverse perspectives
and skills; (c) respect and value the knowledge of those
working together; (d) reciprocity; and (e) relationship building
and maintenance. Additionally, the UK Design Council’s
double diamond method advises four main phases where
involvement can take place; discover (identify the problem),
design (deﬁne the intervention), develop (develop potential
solutions) and deliver
the
Involvement Matrix, co-produced by Smits et al.,29 which
deﬁnes ﬁve main roles within co-production (the listener,
co-thinker, advisor, partner and decision-maker). The roles
reﬂect the degree of stakeholder involvement, ranging from
passive recipient of information (listeners) to active contribu-
tors of options (co-thinkers) and advice (advisors), to equal
collaborations (partners) and ﬁnally, the highest level, the
decision makers. In a systematic review of 22 studies,
Veldmeijer et al.30 explored the extent to which stakeholders
were involved in mental healthcare through design, including
DMHIs. The review found most studies involved end users at
a ‘co-thinker’ level within the matrix framework developed by
Smits et al.,29 with no single study involving end users at the
highest level as ‘decision maker’. These conclusions were
supported by another review of 433 studies by Baines
et al.31 who explored co-production within digital health
innovation,
implementation, and evaluation, and found
whilst co-production is recognised as essential, it is rarely

practised. Whilst these reviews concern co-production, they
did not describe the methods and approaches to facilitate
co-production, nor explore the barriers and added value to
implementing co-production, which would be clinically
useful for guiding decisions when co-producing DMHIs.
Furthermore, the studies were not limited to the delivery of
DMHIs through apps, despite the widespread availability of
apps,32 and increasing popularity of this platform for mental
health treatment.33

Some individual studies have described the way in which
they have used co-production methods in the development
and delivery of DMHIs. However, to our knowledge, there
are no published reviews that systematically aggregate the
methods and approaches employed. Therefore, our aim is to
systematically review the literature to map out the methods
of, and approaches to, co-production when designing, produ-
cing, and evaluating apps aimed at supporting individuals
with mental health difﬁculties. Notably, to the best of our
knowledge, no previous review has focused on apps,
despite their rapid scalability and stakeholders’ concern
regarding the lack of scientiﬁc evidence. We aim to offer
an in-depth exploration by synthesising the methods used in
co-production of mental health apps and offer recommenda-
tions for improving the co-production process to maximise
acceptability and engagement with DMHIs. The objectives
of this study are to: (i) describe the methods and approaches
to co-production that have been used when designing, produ-
cing, and evaluating DMHIs delivered via apps; and (ii)
explore the barriers and facilitators affecting co-production
with DMHIs delivered via apps.

Methods

The systematic review was conducted and reported in
for
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guid-
ance.34 The review protocol was developed in advance
and registered with the International Prospective Register
of Systematic Reviews of the National Institute for Health
Research (PROSPERO CRD42023414007). As this is a
mixed studies systematic review, the seven standard sys-
temic review steps for mixed studies reviews have been fol-
lowed35: (i) specifying the review question; (ii) deﬁning
eligibility criteria; (iii) applying an extensive search strat-
egy; (iv) identifying potentially relevant studies through
rigorous screening (by lead reviewer and an independent
reviewer); (v) selecting relevant studies based on full text;
(vi) data extraction and study quality appraisal (using the
bespoke co-produced quality tool); and (vii) synthesising
the data from the included studies.

Search strategy and identiﬁcation of studies
Relevant studies were identiﬁed through systematic search
of ﬁve
electronic databases: MEDLINE, PsycInfo,

Embase, CINAHL plus and Web of Science. Databases
were searched in June 2023, from inception to present
day. A comprehensive search strategy was developed,
with a wide variety of key search terms and was performed
by primary author (RU). The PICOS framework35 supported
the development of the search strategy. Search terms were
also informed by title and abstracts of key papers, including
review papers.30,31 Search terms were categorised into: (a)
mental health difﬁculties, (b) mobile applications and (c)
co-production. Free text and Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) terms were used for each database. Search terms
within each category were combined with Boolean operator
‘OR’ and the three categories were combined with Boolean
operator ‘AND’. Pilot searches were undertaken to help gen-
erate the ﬁnal search terms (see Table 1). Reference lists
were browsed for any additional relevant studies and citation
chasing was undertaken36 to further supplement the search.

Study selection

Study selection and exclusion processes are outlined in
Figure 1. After removing duplicates, article titles and abstracts
were screened against the eligibility criteria by author RU. If
eligibility was unclear, full
text articles were obtained,
reviewed in accordance with eligibility criteria and discussed
with the wider research team. A second independent rater
(SR) screened 15% of titles and abstracts, with any disagree-
ments resolved with the research team. Following this, 15%
of the full text articles were also screened by the second
rater (SR) to assess reliability of study selection. There was
substantial agreement (93%) between raters. Identiﬁed dis-
crepancies were resolved by consensus within authors.
Disagreements at full text stage were due to whether the
app classiﬁed as a DMHI targeting mental health difﬁculties
or emotional well-being, and whether there was enough infor-
mation regarding the co-production process.

Inclusion criteria were: (a) stakeholder involvement (i.e.
service users, mental health professionals); (b) studies expli-
citly describing stakeholder involvement in the design, devel-
opment and/or evaluation; (c) studies describing a DMHI
delivered by a smartphone app designed speciﬁcally to
target mental health problems; and (d) published in peer
review journals, either a qualitative or mixed methods
design. DMHIs were deﬁned using the deﬁnition from the
Hollis et al. (2017, p. 475) review: ‘DMHIs as: information,
support and therapy for mental health conditions delivered
through an electronic medium with the aim of treating, allevi-
ating, or managing symptoms’. Exclusion criteria were : (a)
non-human participants or no details around stakeholders;
(b) studies with insufﬁcient information around user-centred
design; whereby the co-production process if not explicitly
outlined, i.e. detailed co-production happened but does not
describe involvement; (c) studies not focused on delivering
a DMHI aimed at targeting mental health problems (e.g.
focused on general wellbeing); and (d) studies not written

Data analysis

Data was extracted using a structured form that was devel-
oped and piloted on a small number of papers. Extracted
data included: stakeholder characteristics, DMHI character-
istics, co-production approach, characteristics (method and
outcome of co-production) and reported barriers and facil-
itators to co-production. Author RU extracted the data
from the included papers and a second independent of the
research team also extracted the same data from 20% of
papers to check for consistency. Any extraction disagree-
ments were resolved within the wider research team.

an

by

experience

Due to the absence of an established system for rating
co-production in the context of DMHIs, and following the
ethos of co-production, a bespoke quality rating method
based on the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance
(CRD, 2009) was
for conducting systematic reviews
co-produced with
(see
expert
Supplementary material). Developing the tool entailed ﬁve
iterative steps: (a) collaborative consultation to explore the
purpose of the tool and discuss roles and expectations; (b) col-
laboratively reviewing the literature, including amalgamating
existing key frameworks (NIHR INVOLVE UK Standards
for Public Research18;
Involvement
the 4pi National
the UK Design Council’s double diamond
Standards37;
method (2005); and the Involvement Matrix29 to synthesis
the key phases and determine areas for quality assessing; (c)
developing and testing the prototype tool; (d) reﬁning and for-
malising the tool within the supervisory team; and (e) testing
the ﬁnal tool. Whilst there are several participatory research
frameworks, they all report a similar series of sequential
phases. The bespoke tool placed emphasis on the steps

taken by the researcher to ensure identiﬁcation and representa-
tion of the population, equality in decision making, and the
process of involvement. Studies were not excluded based on
quality if they addressed the focus of the review. Moreover,
the process of quality assessment ensured rich and meaningful
insights from the data were not lost. Thus, studies were not
assigned a numerical value in the interest of this being an
appraisal of each criterion to better describe the quality of
the co-production methods of the studies included, and in
accordance with Siddaway et al. (2019) who recommends
avoiding summary scores. To establish a reliable rating
system, 20% of articles were independently rated by an inde-
pendent second reviewer with areas of discrepancy identiﬁed
and disagreements resolved through discussion within the
wider team. The quality appraisal results have been integrated
throughout the results section given the review is focused on
appraising the studies.

A narrative synthesis of the evidence was conducted,
which involved presenting the characteristics, ﬁndings,
and quality appraisal alongside the reported barriers and
added value of co-production for each study within tables
to enable a within-study synthesis. A cross-study synthesis
was then conducted whereby the differences between char-
acteristics and quality appraisal ratings of the studies were
reviewed and integrated. This supported the ability to
aggregate and synthesise the methods and approaches to
co-production with mental health interventions delivered
via apps, and the barriers and added value to co-production.
ENTREQ checklist was used for transparency.38

DIGITAL HEALTH

totalling 24 studies included for synthesis. Nearly half of
the studies (n = 10) were conducted in either UK or USA.
Studies targeted a range of mental health conditions: psych-
osis (n = 8); depression (n = 4); suicidal ideation and crisis
support (n = 3); mental health but not otherwise speciﬁed
(n = 3); anxiety (n = 2); and borderline personality disorder,
serious mental illness, relational difﬁculties and depression
and anxiety (1 study each). Not all studies detailed a thera-
peutic modality; however, 10 studies reported delivering
some form of cognitive therapy. Fifteen studies involved
adult end users, three studies focused on 18–34-year-olds,
three studies involved young people ranging between 12
and 17 years old, one study focused on adolescents aged
12–24-year-olds, and one study did not detail speciﬁc
ages (but reported mean age = 21.4 years).

Methods and approaches to involvement

The evidence in relation to methods and approaches taken
to co-produce DMHIs is summarised below and in further
detail in Tables 2 and 3. Overall, only three studies49,50,59
endorsed all key principles identiﬁed in our quality
appraisal tool. Furthermore, the identiﬁed barriers and facil-
itators around the co-production process are also described
below.

User involvement

Across all studies reviewed, between 5 and 924 stake-
holders were involved in the co-production process, with
a combined reported sample of 1768. Type of participants
and stakeholders included in the co-production process
varied, but
representatives from the target population
(‘end users’) were included in most studies (n = 21), apart
from three.43,51,52 Two studies explicitly chose not
to
include population representatives due to the perceived sen-
sitivity of the target population (e.g. suicidal ideation51; e.g.
refugees).52 For example, O’Grady et al.52 used age-
matched controls instead of young people with suicidal
thoughts; although, this was recognised as a limitation.
Burchet et al.53 included 128 Syrian refugees, however
they were not pre-screened for mental health difﬁculties,
and therefore recognised they did not necessarily represent
the DMHIs target group. Additionally, Li et al.44 opted
against restrictive recruitment to capture a broad range of
user views, including those who did not self-identify as
having mental health difﬁculties. Other
stakeholders
involved in co-producing DMHIs included: clinicians (17
studies);
(6 studies);
members of the public (5 studies); family members (2
studies);

Information on demographics, particularly gender and eth-
nicity of all stakeholders was generally poorly reported.
Gender was reported by 14 studies, 11 studies reported

age, and eight studies reported ethnicity. Two studies did
not report any demographics.43,58

Co-production phase

Nineteen of the 24 studies reported co-producing the DMHI
from the outset, which aligns with the ﬁrst stage of ‘dis-
cover’ within the double diamond design framework for
developing and evaluating interventions. Twenty-two
studies involved stakeholders in designing the DMHI and
17 within the development stage. The ﬁnal stage of the
reported co-production process, prototype testing, was
reported in 14 studies. However, an additional
three
studies did report testing the DMHI, but with ‘experts’,41
a design team and students52 and a sample that may not
represent the target population.53 Additionally, less than
half of the studies (n = 9) co-produced throughout all four
stages of involvement (discover, design, develop and test).

having the role of ‘co-thinkers’, which involves providing
opinions throughout each stage. For example, Fortuna
et al.63 conducted a usability test with ﬁve end users and
developed a second version of the app following user feed-
back. In 11 studies, stakeholders were classiﬁed as ‘part-
ners’ involved as shared decision makers. For example, in

users, carers, therapists and clinicians) developed a shared

of communicating these ideas. The highest form of involve-
ment within the matrix, the ‘decision-maker’ role, where
end users take initiative and/or make ﬁnal decisions, was
not identiﬁed in any studies.

Methods of co-production

The methods used to facilitate the co-production process are
displayed in Table 4. Methods included more traditional
design methodology: interviews (n = 13); focus groups or
group discussions (n = 17); surveys or questionnaires (n =
7); consultations (n = 5); reviewing literature (n = 5) and
observations
of
co-production involved ‘think aloud’ or cognitive walk-

(n = 2). More

through methods65 in eight studies. These methods examine
the usability of a product, where stakeholders are asked to
carry out tasks while thinking out loud about what they
would do and evaluate whether the task at hand is easily
achievable. For example, Derks et al.55 asked end users
and therapists to complete tasks whilst asking, “Will the
primary user notice that progress is being made toward
accomplishment of their goal?” (p. 7). Other methods
including creative methods using design artefacts (n = 8),
such as storyboarding, card sorting, mock-ups drawings
and paper prototypes.

App prototype testing, which involves a preliminary
visual mock-up that looks like a real app and demonstrates
an app’s fundamental design and function, was conducted
in seventeen studies. App prototypes can be as basic as
sketches, or as high-ﬁdelity as a clickable, digital model
that works on stakeholders’ phones. Prototype testing is
believed to be the most effective way of knowing how a
product will perform. The ﬁnal version of apps were
tested by stakeholders in laboratory settings (n = 15), or
real-world setting (n = 10). Real world testing was achieved
through either ﬁeld testing (n = 3), evaluating the adoption
of product features, where stakeholders roam freely by
exploring any exhibit they choose to test usability rather
than content; or, through beta testing (n = 8), which aims
to evaluate satisfaction and ensure release readiness. Beta
testing involves a focused tour, where certain functions
are directly presented to the user and evaluated. Prototype
testing was often combined with other methods. For
example, Burchet et al.53 used ‘think aloud’ methods
based on initial impressions and feedback, while stake-
holders engaged with the prototype app, asking, ‘Do you
think that this app can be helpful for Syrian refugees here
in [country] who experience sadness or distress?’ (p. 5).

Challenges and added value to co-producing DMHIs

Co-production with stakeholders yielded various advan-
tages and obstacles for the development and implementa-
tion of DMHIs.

Challenges to co-production
Resource constraints. One of the main challenges encoun-
tered in the co-production process was practical constraints.
Several studies43,47,51,53,58,66 reported issues related to
resources, time and costs that constrained co-production
activities. Researchers recognised resource constraints
restricted them from being able to always explore and
address all stakeholder suggestions. Time restraints meant
that Easton et al.47 were unable to explore suggestions
around creative approaches to engaging people in therapy
as they prioritised reviewing app content.

Practical challenges were exacerbated by the digital
nature of the intervention development and testing. Some

stakeholders did not have access to mobile phones and
could therefore not test the tool.40,46,53 In other cases, the
expense involved in iterating and creating multiple versions
of the app was prohibitive,51,53,58,66 and technical limita-
tions in incorporating user feedback into app features was
also a challenge.48,50 For example, in Berry et al.,66 end
users requested multi-media features, such as voice record-
ing features, that were not feasible for the software team to
develop due to time and ﬁnding constraints,
limited
resources within the study time frame or the funding of
the research grant. Moreover, where researchers asked
stakeholders to test a prototype version of the app that
did not necessarily reﬂect the end-product,53 stakeholders
reported feeling less engaged in, and satisﬁed with, the
co-production process. Furthermore, some studies noted
in some instances, stakeholders changed their
that,
views or preferences over time, or hypothetical
ideas
did not always translate well into practice, resulting in
the requirement of further changes and increased costs.
For example, two studies reported that initial preferences
identiﬁed by stakeholders in the ‘discovery stage’ were
not endorsed during subsequent stages (e.g. Chatbot fea-
tures44; number of alert notiﬁcations66).

Recruitment challenges and commitment. A common barrier
reported in most studies reviewed40,47,51,54,55,59,61,62 was
the use of small samples to co-produce, reducing generalis-
ability and inﬂuencing the nature of the input received.
Several studies further noted the lack of recruiting a
diverse sample as a challenge,39,40,42–45,51,53 and conse-
quently queried how representative the views were to the
wider target audience the DMHI was designed to help.
Studies recognised methods used to recruit inﬂuenced the
limited diversity of the sample, such as recruiting from ser-
vices, where individuals may be more help-seeking and/or
have a better self-management of their mental health.57,58
Researchers also acknowledged online recruitment was
likely to target more proﬁcient users of technology, thus
leading to a more biased sample in terms of familiarity
with, and openness to, smartphones.44,47

Another challenge related to recruitment was around
managing risks (i.e. suicidal ideation) within groups of
more vulnerable users.51,53,57 Researchers recognised it
was important to ensure the safety and well-being of end
users in the event they found taking part in co-production
work distressing, especially when this involved sharing per-
sonal experiences. As indicated previously, the concern
regarding managing safety led to one study excluding end
users52
fundamentals of
co-production.26 Furthermore, as Burchet et al.53 recruited
Syrian refugees, audio recordings of the interviews were
not made due to privacy concerns raised by the sample.
Instead, a written record was made, and researchers recog-
nised their approach to data collection is likely to have
affected data quality and depth.

Research teams also had to adapt to the changing cir-
cumstances of stakeholders, such as rescheduling meetings
due to low attendance.58,66 Berry et al.66 described how
inconsistency with user attendance meant end users were
unable to take a leader role to co-chair meetings, and
co-production relationships were harder to build.

Conﬂicting views and expectations. An important aspect of
effective co-production was achieving a balance between sta-
keholders’ suggestions, whilst acknowledging the diversity of
their needs and preferences. Several studies43–45,47,53,62,66
noted variability in views and opinions expressed about
topics covered in co-production sessions, which led to difﬁ-
cult decisions needing to be made by the research team
around how to integrate and reconcile suggestions into the
next iteration of app development. For example, Branelley
et al.43 described stakeholders expressing conﬂicting requests
for alert notiﬁcations via the app: some stakeholders found
alert notiﬁcations helpful, while others found these intrusive.
Preferences also varied depending on how stakeholders
intended to the use the app, with some expressing the need
for immediate crisis support as an important feature of the
app, and others preferred prioritisation of longer-term fea-
tures, such as tracking.45 Moreover, two studies47,66 reported
that some user, and even clinician suggestions were at odds
with the theoretical underpinnings of the intervention.

Additionally, some studies44,47,66 encountered chal-
lenges in accommodating the preferences across different
instance, when Li et al.44

anxiety and depression, parents valued credibility, profes-
sionals valued safety, and young people desired accessibil-
ity, relatability, and reliance. Other studies identiﬁed they
were not always able to capture the views of all stakeholder
groups, including engaging family members due to recruit-
ment and practical issues, limiting experiences across stake-
holder groups.40

adult user with low writing and literacy skills by putting
their story into words, and two end users who lacked the
conﬁdence to present their ideas to the wider group were
supported by team leaders. However, nearly all
the
studies (n = 22)
reported on changes to interventions
based on stakeholder feedback, using speciﬁc examples.
For example, Atif et al.42 found end users preferred brief
messages due to low literacy and effects of depression,
therefore the content was broken down into small segments
with just one or two key messages, to meet the needs of end
users.

Added value
Enhancing cultural sensitivity. The included studies identi-
ﬁed the co-production of DMHIs delivered through apps
enabled researchers to be culturally sensitive when develop-
ing the intervention through gathering feedback around lan-
guage and relatable examples.41,42,53,54,58 Researchers
described how the inclusion of stakeholders from diverse
(ethnic, cultural, age and gender) backgrounds allowed
the development of a DMHI that resonated with and
reﬂected the wider target populations. Such alignment of
the app with the end users’ language, cultural and context
enhanced the relevance, acceptability, and usability of the
app.41,53,54

Enrichment of ideas. The diversity of stakeholders enriched
the variety of ideas and views beyond the researcher’s per-
spective.49,56,66 Indeed, Berry et al.66 reported that some
features included in the Actissist app would not have
been considered by the research group without multiple
stakeholder input, such as recovery videos. Co-production
activities ensured that a range of stakeholder views and
needs captured key information and skills that could be
integrated into DMHI development, ensuring a more cre-
ative and innovate app could be developed.41,57

Power imbalance. A further barrier included power imbal-
ances between stakeholders and researchers’ methodological
approaches, including focus groups were described as a con-
tributing factor to an imbalance in power. Some studies felt
end users did not voice ideas or talk about personal experi-
ences due to group dynamics.47,49,53,54,66

Studies generally did not report on inclusivity, power,
and equality in decision making within co-production pro-
cesses, which are key principles within the NIHR
INVOLVE26 guidance; with only seven of the 24 studies
reporting on any efforts made to ensure the inclusivity
and accessibility of co-production activities. Furthermore,
ratings on the methodological quality tool (Table 3) demon-
strated only thirteen studies reported on attempts to minim-
ise power
imbalances. An example of high-quality
approaches to inclusivity included Terp et al.’s39 study
who explicitly described how they supported a young

Acceptability and usability. Co-producing DMHIs with sta-
keholders facilitated the development of useful, relevant,
and acceptable apps that met both the end users’ and
researchers’ needs and concerns.40,45,51,58,60 Speciﬁcally,
Newton and colleagues51 described how the co-production
process resulted in an app that felt relevant and acceptable
to both clinicians and service users, showing promise in
exposure interventions outside of therapy. Several studies
also emphasised the necessity of iterative testing, to identify
and incorporate the needs and features identiﬁed and priori-
tised by stakeholders, such as design and content ﬂaws
noted in prototypes, in a timely manner.46,53,64 For instance,
one study found that after end users engaged in laboratory
prototype testing of an initial version, larger visual aids

process also afforded the research team insight into which

before the app went live, such as simplifying information,41
modifying terminology53 and adding goal setting functions.66
Therefore, reviewing content with stakeholders early in the
design process enabled reﬁnement of content that balanced
usability and informativeness,
in line with the evidence
base. Stakeholders also reported co-production methods

engagement. Certain methodology,
including creative methods, such as ‘think aloud’ interviews
were felt, by researchers,
to improve engagement and
increase honest feedback.39,53,54 Christie et al.54 changed
their methodological approach after noticing a reluctance
for end users to express views during interviews and focus

methods, whereby the young person immersed themselves
in the app and then gave one-to-one feedback in response
to more targeted questions, facilitated engagement,54 and
researchers felt feedback was more authentic and meaning-
ful. Terp et al.39 also described creative workshops using
several design artefact techniques (storyboard, card sorting,
mock-ups and paper prototypes) supported active participa-
tion, speciﬁcally the use of card sorting, where stakeholders
arranged ‘problem statements’ into categories, which sup-
ported the position preferences for the content of the app.

A sense of community. A further
co-producing smartphone apps was the opportunity to col-
laborate with stakeholders as part of a community, with
mutual engagement where stakeholders’ voices felt heard.
Stakeholders appreciated the facilitation of connections
with others,43,60 the exchange of ideas49,52,56 and the enthu-
siasm it generated.39,45,47,57 For example, end users
described feeling seen as knowledgeable resources instead
of a patient in need of care.39

Discussion

The objective of this review was to provide an overview of
the methods, and approaches to co-producing mental health
app interventions, alongside the barriers and facilitators to
co-production. This study represents, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst systematic review to assimilate the lit-
erature and provide a robust summary of the co-production
activities of DMHIs via apps. This review highlights the
existence of notable gaps of
concerning
co-produced DMHIs. Speciﬁcally, there is signiﬁcant vari-
ability in terms of stakeholder groups involved, stage and
role of involvement, methods used, consideration of frame-
works, and attempts to minimise power dynamics. The
review identiﬁed four distinct yet overlapping concepts

evidence

pertaining to the barriers of successful co-production of
DMHIs: (a) resource constraints; (b) recruitment chal-
lenges; (c) conﬂicting views; and (d) power imbalances.
The added value of co-producing DMHIs was identiﬁed
as: (a) enhancing cultural sensitivity; (b) enrichment of
ideas; (c) increased acceptance of DMHI; (d) methodology
promoting engagement; and (e) a sense of community.

A key ﬁnding was the limited reporting of stakeholder
demographics, co-production frameworks, attempts
to
ensure inclusivity, attempts to minimise power dynamics,
and the equality in decision making. This is a common criti-
cism within the research literature where authors rarely
detail the activities taken to align with the key principles
of co-production.67 Possible reasons for the limited report-
ing could be due to the absence of a uniformed
co-production framework to apply co-production in prac-
tice. Alternatively, this may be explained by publication
word limits, especially given that most studies’ objectives
were around the co-produced intervention content and
rarely primarily aimed at
reporting the co-production
process. The ﬁndings of this review call for researchers to
report co-production activities to allow for co-production
principles to be better operationalised in practice.

The value of involving stakeholders throughout all
phases is well documented for producing relevant and
useful DMHIs for people experiencing mental health difﬁ-
culties. Most studies (n = 23) involved end users at a
‘co-thinker’ level, and sometimes as ‘partners’, but never
‘decision makers’, suggesting there is a still a need to
improve equality between end users and researchers in the
co-production process. Phase of involvement was variable,
with highest user involvement during the ﬁrst stage of the
co-production process, and only nine studies involving
end users throughout all stages of co-production. The ﬁnd-
ings from this review overlap with the systematic review
conducted by Veldmeijer et al.,31 who explored the extent
to which stakeholders were involved in mental healthcare
through design,
including DMHIs. Both reviews found
that the level of involvement of end users was lower in
the latter phases. This ﬁnding aligns with the wider health-
care co-production literature where co-production involve-
ment
tends to be limited to the early stage, with less
involvement during the middle ‘design’ phase.24,68

According to Sanders et al.,16 active participation is a
well-known challenge to successful co-production. A
novel ﬁnding of this review was that certain methodological
approaches such as ‘think-aloud’ techniques increased
active participation and authentic engagement amongst
individuals with mental health difﬁculties. Additionally,
creative methods such as the utilisation of storyboarding
alleviated the challenge of translating hypothetical ideas
into practice. Therefore, more novel methodologies have
the potential to improve co-production engagement69 and
may also circumvent power issues and other difﬁcult
group dynamics that manifest in focus groups.

A dominate discourse in the wider literature of the chal-
lenges limiting co-production activity, are budget costs and
time restrictions.70 This review found resources challenges
were particularly prominent in the context of digital interven-
tion due to the cost involved in their production. Building an
app takes several months and has average related costs ranging
from $60,000 to $250,000,71 with increased prototype devel-
opments increasing fees. Thus, adequate budgeting for proto-
types, along with realistic time expectations to incorporate
feedback, needs to be considered when co-producing apps.
Prototype costs is of particular concern given the ﬁndings of
this review suggest prototype versions of apps that are more
closely reﬂective of the end-product are important to increase
user engagement, and to ensure ideas translate into practice.
The included studies highlighted the need to recruit larger,
heterogenous samples. A clear concern was the lack of diver-
sity amongst stakeholders, and the co-production sample not
being representative of the target audience. This concern is
well documented across health research, whereby those
involved in research are unrepresentative of the wider audi-
ence, especially ethnic minority groups.72,73 Whilst a larger,
diverse sample may be more representative and encompass
a wide range of ideas and preferences,74 it requires a

process of careful negotiation for researchers to prioritise
increased and varying ideas.72

There is signiﬁcant value of co-production to maximise
DMHIs acceptability and engagement through allowing end
users voice’s to be heard. Based on the good practice of
co-production from the studies as evaluated through the
bespoke quality tool, recommendations for co-producing
DMHIs are made and presented in Table 5. Key highlights
include the recruitment of a diverse population involving
multiple stakeholder groups, involvement throughout all
stages, steps taken to minimise power and promote equality
in decision making, employment of think aloud and creative
methods to facilitate participation and outlining non-
negotiables of adaptions from the outset (i.e. ideas that
interfere with the ﬁdelity of the intervention).

The purpose of this review was to provide an overview
of the methods and approaches to DMHIs. Therefore,
broad search terms were used to include as many studies
as possible that cover the topic and provide a complete over-
view. The number of included studies,
the breadth of
co-production methods and user involvement included in
this review are a clear strength. A further strength is the devel-
opment of a co-produced bespoke quality appraisal tool, and

Area to be considered

Recommendation

1. Careful consideration
regarding sample:
diversity, and
stakeholder groups

(cid:129) Aim to recruit a diverse population, as cultural adaption of DMHIs has been identiﬁed as a factor that

increases the effectiveness of DMHIs.

(cid:129) Use multiple stakeholder groups to ensure a diverse range of views are captured (e.g., include parents

when developing apps for adolescent populations).

2. The role and phase of

(cid:129)

involvement

Involve stakeholders throughout all stages of the co-production process, from the initial stage of
‘discover’ where ideas are generated, through to the implementation stage.

(cid:129) Particular consideration should be given to the middle stage of ‘develop’ to ensure end-user voices are

incorporated throughout every stage to develop an acceptable and useable DMHI.

3. Inclusivity and power

4. Use of creative

methods

5. Process of negotiation

(cid:129) Proactively take steps to minimise power dynamics. For example, upon the set-up of the co-production
group, acknowledge the power dynamic and make attempts to minimise the power differential by, for
example, referring to members by names, not professional titles.

(cid:129) Support end-users to lead with decision making.
(cid:129) Co-production activities should be inclusive and accessible, such as adapting resources and sneering the
equipment needed for meaningful involvement is supplied (e.g., tablet access if groups occur online).

(cid:129) Use collaborative ‘think aloud’ and other creative methods where possible, as traditional focus groups

can inhibit participant responses, particularly in younger populations.

(cid:129) Consider feedback from all stakeholders, but balance this with ﬁdelity to the evidence-based intervention
in development. It might not be possible to meet all user group’s needs, which could negatively inﬂuence
co-production experiences.

(cid:129) Outline the non-negotiables of the intervention in terms of theory and rationale at the outset of the
co-production process. An open, honest, and sensitive approach should be taken to discuss why any
changes were not possible, and where possible, compromises should be made as a collective.

(cid:129) Guide negotiations in a way that manages expectations whilst fostering the relationship with

stakeholders and minimising power dynamics.

whilst the tool is not validated, it was able to capture a much
richer understanding of the approaches to co-production.

Given that the search was limited to studies written or
translated in the English language and those published in
peer-reviewed journals, publication and language biases
are acknowledged. Inclusion of other languages may have
yielded more studies focused on low and middle-income
countries. Nevertheless, a variety of studies conducted
internationally were identiﬁed and included. It is important
to note that included studies may be inﬂuenced by selection
bias. Only studies that documented the co-production
process were included. Thus, studies that have co-produced
DMHIs, but did not report on the process, have not been
the results need to be considered
captured. Therefore,
within this context, and this review may over-represent
the co-production that is happening more widely.

Conclusions

Findings suggest there is huge variation in terms of how
co-production is being facilitated. Stakeholder involvement
and the barriers and facilitators faced when co-producing
DMHIs are emphasised. Based on the ﬁndings, important
considerations for co-producing DMHIs are highlighted.
Key recommendations for co-producing DMHIs include
involvement of a diverse stakeholder group, involvement
at all stages, inclusivity and roles to be considered, the bal-
ancing of suggestions and ﬁdelity, and the inclusion of col-
laborative creative and ‘think aloud’ methods to allow for
authentic feedback. Overall, a range of stakeholders,
throughout the entirety of the design, development, and
employment of DMHIs through various methodologies is
advocated by this review to lead to evidence based and
effective DMHIs for people with mental health difﬁculties.
Considering the insights gleaned from this review and
the wider
is imperative that forthcoming
research directs its attention towards understanding stake-
holder’s perspectives of co-production. Additionally, inves-
tigation should be undertaken to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
implementing a co-produced framework across all four
developmental phases of DMHIs. Consequently, empirical
testing is warranted to ascertain whether DMHIs developed
through co-production yield superior clinical outcome.
Additionally, the co-produced bespoke tool used to assess
co-production methodological quality should be used as a
framework for researchers and app developers to implement
co-production in adherence to the core principles.
