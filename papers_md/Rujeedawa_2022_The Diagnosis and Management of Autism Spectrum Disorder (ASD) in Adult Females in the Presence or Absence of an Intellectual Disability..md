Abstract: We review the reasons for the greater male predominance in the diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder in the non-intellectual disabled population and compare it to autism diagnosed in
intellectually disabled individuals. Accurate and timely diagnosis is important, as it reduces health
inequalities. Females often present later for the diagnosis. The differences are in core features, such
as in social reciprocal interaction through ‘camouﬂaging’ and restricted repetitive behaviours, that
are less noticeable in females and are potentially explained by the biological differences (female
protective effect theory) and/or differences in presentation between the two sexes (female autism
phenotype theory). Females more often present with internalising co-occurring conditions than
males. We review these theories, highlighting the key differences and the impact of a diagnosis on
females. We review methods to potentially improve diagnosis in females along with current and
future management strategies.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that can present
as a spectrum of symptoms, with different autistic individuals presenting differently. This
condition is strongly genetic, with a heritability of around 80 to 90% [1]. In people with
an intellectual disability (ID), ASD or autistic characteristics are more common and often
associated with certain syndromes such as Fragile X, Down syndrome, Williams syndrome,
Prader–Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and
more [2]. It is important to point out that autism, besides being associated with several
challenges, is also associated with certain positive traits such as truthfulness, honesty,
integrity, high standards, and attention to details [3].

Throughout this paper, the term ‘autism’ will be used to represent all the conditions
on the autism spectrum. In line with the preferences from a majority within the autism
community, this paper will be using identity-ﬁrst language (‘autistic person’) instead of
person-ﬁrst language (‘person with autism’) [4].

Though traditionally diagnosed in childhood, when differences from neurotypical
peers become apparent, lately, there has been a surge in adult diagnosis due, in part, to the
broadening of diagnostic criteria [5]. Due to the absence of any reliable biomarkers, autism
is diagnosed behaviourally with diagnosis requiring the core characteristics: difﬁculties in
reciprocal social communication and interactions, and ‘Restricted, Repetitive Behaviour’
(RRB), i.e., the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours that lead to cog-
nitive inﬂexibility and preference for routines. It is important to note the difﬁculty of
diagnosis: the degree of impairment is not only dependent on the individual alone but also
the surrounding environment. Symptoms are tamer in supportive settings, but they are
more apparent in stressful situations [1]. This needs to be accounted for during diagnosis.

As diagnostic criteria broadened, the number of people considered as autistic has
increased. For example, about 1 in 69 children in the US [6] and 1 in 59 in the UK [7] are
affected by autism. Notably, such prevalence data comes, mainly, from well-developed
western countries, as prevalence in low-income countries seems to be lower [8] either due
to lack of proper diagnosis [9,10] or due to lifestyle factors.

The prevalence of autism in males and females is different, with higher prevalence
in males. The estimated male to female ratio varies depending on the study and ranges
from 4:1 [11] to 3:1 [12] to 2:1 [13]. Context is very important to consider; whole population
screening leads to a lower ratio than when only considering clinically diagnosed individu-
als [12]. The ratio is also affected by presence of intellectual disability, with it reaching 2:1
when considering individuals with intellectual disabilities [14]. This could potentially be
explained by reduced camouﬂaging in ID (see below). Besides the difference in prevalence,
there is also a difference in age of diagnosis between the sexes, with females being generally
diagnosed later [15–17]. The median age of diagnosis in men is 22 compared to 26 in
women [18].

2. Methods

A structured review was undertaken, following the guidelines provided by Prisma
Protocols [19]. First, a search in PubMed was carried out of the literature published in the
last ﬁve years relating to autism in females, using the MeSH terms: (“Autism”[MeSH Terms]
AND “Female”[MeSH Terms]). From the 1878 results, 269 were assessed for eligibility based
on their relevance from their title and abstract, and from those, 54 were selected after a full-
text review. A further search was conducted from literature published in the last 10 years
using the MeSH terms: (“Autism”[MeSH Terms] AND “Intellectual disability”[MeSH
Terms] AND “Female”[MeSH Terms]). From the 410 results, 200 were assessed for eligibility
based on their relevance from their title and abstract, and from those, 16 were selected after
a full-text review. The exclusion criteria applied to select the articles from their abstracts
were the following: (a) n = 1, (b) only the title or abstract available, (c) opinion articles,
clinical trials, novel test descriptions, or protocol revisions, (d) no speciﬁc content about
autism in females, and (e) no speciﬁc reference to the impact of intellectual disability
in autism. From the selected articles, we have ﬁnally included those that did not fulﬁl
any of the previous exclusion criteria nor, following a full-text review, contain any new
information. Finally, reference lists of selected papers were also searched for potentially
relevant studies. The search methodology is summarised in Figure 1.

Explaining the Difference between the Sexes We refer the reader to a review by Driver and Chester [20], and references therein, who summarise many of the clinical issues regarding autism in females. We will highlight some of these aspects here but with a focus on possible reasons for the differences and on autism in females with a non-syndromic intellectual disability. There are two main theories that explain the sex difference observed in autism: nota-bly, the Female Protective Effect (FPE) theory and the Female Autism Profile (FAP) theory. The two are not mutually exclusive and will be explored. 3.1. Female Protective Effect (FPE) Theory The FPE theory argues that females are inherently protected from developing autism, requiring greater environmental and/or genetic risk to develop and manifest the same de-gree of autism as males [21]. This is supported by the fact that males, in general, have less spontaneous mutations associated with autism compared to females [22,23]. Autistic fe-males also carry a larger size of rare copy number variations, containing genes that are expressed in the early development of the striatum [24]. The extreme male brain theory argues that androgens and other hormones prevalent in males are linked to autism, and characteristics associated with autism, such as impaired cognitive empathy, are masculine [25]. Autistic individuals, therefore, have an ‘extreme male’ presentation. It follows from this that females who have lower levels of these hor-mones are protected from the development of these male characteristics associated with autism [26,27]. Evidence supporting this theory is mixed, with some studies having found a link between androgen levels [28,29] and autistic characteristic in females, while others suggest otherwise [30]. Another theory proposed that the X chromosome has genes that protect against autism [31] but so far, no such gene has been found. Two peptide neuro-transmitters, potentially playing a role in explaining the difference between male and fe-male autism, are oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), which have sexually dimorphic effects on brain activity, with stronger effects of OXT in females and stronger Int.

3. Explaining the Difference between the Sexes

We refer the reader to a review by Driver and Chester [20], and references therein,
who summarise many of the clinical issues regarding autism in females. We will highlight
some of these aspects here but with a focus on possible reasons for the differences and on
autism in females with a non-syndromic intellectual disability.

There are two main theories that explain the sex difference observed in autism: notably,
the Female Protective Effect (FPE) theory and the Female Autism Proﬁle (FAP) theory. The
two are not mutually exclusive and will be explored.

3.1. Female Protective Effect (FPE) Theory

The FPE theory argues that females are inherently protected from developing autism,
requiring greater environmental and/or genetic risk to develop and manifest the same
degree of autism as males [21]. This is supported by the fact that males, in general, have
less spontaneous mutations associated with autism compared to females [22,23]. Autistic
females also carry a larger size of rare copy number variations, containing genes that are
expressed in the early development of the striatum [24].

The extreme male brain theory argues that androgens and other hormones prevalent
in males are linked to autism, and characteristics associated with autism, such as impaired
cognitive empathy, are masculine [25]. Autistic individuals, therefore, have an ‘extreme
male’ presentation.
It follows from this that females who have lower levels of these
hormones are protected from the development of these male characteristics associated
with autism [26,27]. Evidence supporting this theory is mixed, with some studies having
found a link between androgen levels [28,29] and autistic characteristic in females, while
others suggest otherwise [30]. Another theory proposed that the X chromosome has genes
that protect against autism [31] but so far, no such gene has been found. Two peptide
neurotransmitters, potentially playing a role in explaining the difference between male and
female autism, are oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), which have sexually
dimorphic effects on brain activity, with stronger effects of OXT in females and stronger effects
of AVP in males [32]. Both have been shown to have an effect on social behaviour [32–34].

It is important to note that the FPE theory has some limitations. If, as suggested,
autistic females need a larger genetic load to develop autism, relatives of autistic females
should be more likely to have autism compared to relatives of autistic males. Evidence
around this is mixed, with some studies validating it [35,36], while others contradict it [37].
In addition, many of the studies cited assume that current diagnostic criteria are valid
and that the autistic females participating have met the diagnostic criteria. However, this
may not necessarily be true, as evidenced by the fact that the male to female ratio changes
depending on the population used, as discussed above.

3.2. Female Autism Proﬁle (FAP) Theory

The FAP theory proposes that women develop autism at a higher rate than currently
estimated but that diagnostic criteria and methods are unable to properly detect autistic
females [38,39]. Females tend to require additional difﬁculties, compared to males with
similar levels of autistic characteristics, in order to receive a diagnosis [39–42]. This sex dis-
parity is particularly prevalent in females without an intellectual disability [38]. The reason
behind the inefﬁciency of the current diagnostic methods in identifying autistic females is
that current criteria are based on pre-established conceptions of what autistic characteristics
are. These conceptions are mainly based on autistic male populations [16,43,44]. Females
present differently from males and, as such, may be missed under current criteria [45]. The
female autism phenotype has the same core features of autism (impaired social communi-
cation abilities and RRB), though these may present differently from males [16,46,47].

Social impairments tend to be fewer in females, who, in general, also tend to display
higher social motivation [48,49]. This difference in social abilities makes it harder to
diagnose autistic females [50]. Higher social skills compared to autistic males, however,
does not imply the absence of social challenges. Autistic females may be physically close to

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1315

friends whilst not being accepted and suffering from neglect and exclusion [50]. In addition,
autistic females seem to be less likely to maintain long term relationships compared to autistic
males [49], potentially because autistic females are less apt at resolving social conflicts [51].

RRBs also present differently in the two sexes. Females seem to have lower levels of
such behaviours [40,52,53] and interests, and RRBs seem to be less predictive of autism
diagnosis in females compared to males [50]. There is an opposing theory that argues
that instead of being lower, autistic females display RRBs in different, non-atypical areas
compared to males [54,55]. Supporting this, studies have shown that autistic males’ interest
seem to be on mechanical subjects [56,57], while autistic females’ interests seem to be on
more relational subjects [56–58]. This type of interest, though the intensity may be atypical,
is considered more socially appropriate compared to the interests of autistic males [59]. As
a result of the either lower levels of RRBs, more socially acceptable RRBs, or both, autistic
females are less likely to be identiﬁed [60].

Camouﬂaging refers to using strategies, whether consciously or unconsciously, to
hide autistic characteristics within social settings [61]. These strategies include mimicking
facial expressions, forcing eye contact, using scripted responses, and suppressing actions
such as hand ﬂapping [62–64]. Compensation, which can be considered as a subset of
camouﬂaging, is a phenomenon whereby alternative cognitive strategies are employed to
deal with the difﬁculties of autism, such as using executive function strategies to overcome
theory of mind difﬁculties [65]. Camouﬂaging is generally associated with higher exec-
utive functions [66]. It would follow from this that autistic individuals with intellectual
disabilities are less likely to camouﬂage their autistic traits, though no study validating
this has been found. Camouﬂaging, being more prevalent in females, is a reason behind
the difﬁculty of diagnosing female autism [67]. A study showed that, from a distance,
autistic girls behaved similar to neurotypical peers, likely due to camouﬂaging, and it is
only when properly looked into that the challenges of the autistic girls were identiﬁed [68].
Camouﬂaging does not, however, purely produce positive outcomes, with it being a taxing
process that can lead to high levels of anxiety and stress [47]. It is also linked to mental
health issues and is a known risk marker for suicidality [69,70]. Camouﬂaging can lead
to a differential presentation across different social settings, as in less stressful situations,
the autistic individual may not feel the need to camouﬂage [60]. This greater ability to
camouﬂage or compensate autistic difﬁculties has been suggested to be due to female
ability through genetics [16,39] thereby linking the FAP and FPE theories.

4. Implications of ASD Being Perceived as a ‘Male Disorder’

Due to the male-centric diagnostic criteria, higher prevalence of autism in males, and
lack of information about female autism [71], autism has been perceived as a male disorder,
and this is a reason for misdiagnosis of autism in females [72]. Cementing this is the fact
that boys are 10 times more likely to be referred for diagnosis compared to girls [50]. This
notion of autism as a male disorder can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle, whereby it leads
to reduced identiﬁcation of female autism. There seems to be more parental concern for
ASD diagnosis for boys than for girls [50]. In addition, the concern of parents of girls tends
to be met with scepticism by society [50]. There is also clinician bias whereby clinicians
are more likely to exclude a diagnosis of autism for girls [15]. The notion of autism as a
male-disorder is detrimental to the diagnosis of autistic females and should be combatted.

5. Associated Conditions

Autism is associated with several co-morbidities. For instance, autistic individuals are
more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders [73]. Between 35 and 42% of autistic people
have an intellectual disability [74]. Co-morbidities associated with autism include anxiety,
depression, bipolar affective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention
deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychosis, seizures, weight problems, hypertension,
and many others [75]. These co-morbidities can either diagnostically overshadow autism,
leading to missing a diagnosis of autism, or the characteristics of the co-morbidity are

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1315

5 of 13

ascribed to autism, leading to other issues being missed. It is important to note that females
are more likely to be diagnosed with these associated co-morbidities instead of autism
compared to males [76]. While many of the co-morbidities do not discriminate between the
sexes, some do, and these will be the focus of this section.

Internalising disorders refers to the inward expression of emotional difﬁculties and
can manifest as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, among others [77]. On the other
hand, externalizing disorders refer to the outward expression of emotional difﬁculties and
can present as behavioural problems and inattention. Autistic females are more likely to
suffer from an internalising disorder compared to males [78–80], whilst males are more
prone to externalizing disorders [49,81]. Internalising disorders being less apparent than
externalizing ones is a reason behind the common missed diagnosis of female autism and
the perception of autism as a male disorder [60].

Eating disorders are associated with autism, and particularly so in females [64,82],
and they may be, in part, due to sensory integration problems in autism. There are two
types of eating disorders associated with autism: avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
(ARFID) and anorexia nervosa (AN) [1]. In fact, many women have been identiﬁed as
autistic following diagnosis of eating disorders [83]. AN and autism have many parallels,
with both groups displaying aloofness, rigidity, RRBs, and social impairment [84,85].
Females with anorexia tend to have elevated autistic traits [85,86], thereby making it hard
to distinguish whether the displayed phenotypes are part of AN or there is a co-occurrence
of autism. One important distinguishing factor between the two conditions is the quality of
social response: difﬁculties in social reciprocity is prevalent in ASD, while those suffering
from AN show little difﬁculty in understanding social prompts [85,87].

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), or hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), is another
disorder commonly associated with female autism [88,89], often co-occurring within the
same families [90]. Due to generally being treated by different disciplines, this co-morbidity
often goes unnoticed [91]. It is important to note that, whilst these conditions may appear
dissimilar, they, in fact, share several features such as coordination problems, sensory issues,
autonomic dysregulation, immune dysregulation, and neurobehavioral, psychiatric, and
neurological features [89].

Gender dysphoria and gender identity questioning are other conditions associated
with autism [92]. Between 7.8 and 26% of referrals to gender clinics also have a diagnosis
of autism [93–95]. This association between gender variance and autism is particularly
prominent in females [64,96]. The extreme male brain theory provides a potential biological
explanation [25].

6. Diagnosis in Women

Diagnosis of autism requires the clinical judgement of whether the core characteristics
are met and whether their combined intensity is enough to cause a disability whilst ensuring
not to confound autism with any other condition [1]. Helping in diagnosis is a series of
screening questionnaires and interview frameworks. However, these diagnostic methods
may not be suitable in identifying autistic females. For instance, assessments such as
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) are more likely to miss girls [97]. This
section will look at potential ways to diagnose autism in females. In addition, healthcare
professionals are less conﬁdent in diagnosing autism in females [98].

During interviews, it is important to note sex differences in language. For instance,
women tend to be slower to respond [99]. In addition, when examining social relationships,
it is important to look deeper. Autistic individuals reporting friendships does not necessar-
ily mean that those relationships are reciprocal [99], and a deeper dive, getting the patients
to describe their feelings is necessary. Many autistic females describe feelings of loneliness
despite reporting friendships [99].

Screeners looking at the female autistic presentation have been developed for children
and adolescents, and when used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools,
they can
help better identify female autism [100]. Given that camouflaging is part of the female autism

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1315

6 of 13

phenotype, assessing camouflaging is important in diagnosing women [101]. There are two main
methods to measure camouflaging: the discrepancy approach and the observation approach.

The discrepancy approach aims to look at the difference between the internal autistic
status of an individual and their external presentation [65]. A problem with this approach
is that the only way to measure internal autistic status is by using external proxies. In
addition, this method ignores unsuccessful camouﬂaging attempts. The observational
approach seeks to either measure speciﬁc behaviours and experiences that are associated
with camouﬂaging or asking the autistic individuals about camouﬂaging [102]. The self-
report method eliminates biases from the clinicians and researchers.

The Camouﬂaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) seeks to measure camouﬂag-
ing behaviours in adults using self-report measures [102]. The questionnaire has proven
to be successful, and since there is no requirement for an ofﬁcial autistic diagnosis, it
escapes the male centric biases of current diagnostic criteria [102]. As the CAT-Q relies on
self-reﬂections, this method may not be suitable to individuals with intellectual disabili-
ties [102]. Importantly, results from different studies using CAT-Q have been conﬂicting,
with some studies arguing that camouﬂaging is not more prevalent in women [103] and
others arguing it is [104]. This questions whether camouﬂaging is a ubiquitous feature of
female autism. Whilst promising, the CAT-Q requires more research before becoming a
clinical tool [102].

Female autism is often missed with current diagnostic tools: to solve this problem,
many have investigated ways of identifying autistic females, such as by looking at cam-
ouﬂaging, which is a common reason behind missed diagnosis. However, so far, none
has been approved for clinical use. Nonetheless, clinicians can help in better diagnosing
females by dismissing the notion of autism as a male disorder and not dismissing concerns
of parents. A clinician also needs to make sure that behind the mental illness diagnosis
being made of a patient, there may be autism [20].

Impact of Diagnosis in Women

Diagnosis of autism can have an immense impact on an individual. This section will
focus mainly on the impact of autism diagnosis on females rather than the impact on both
sexes, in general.

Autistic individuals with a normal intelligence are often labelled as high function-
ing [99], and this can lead to missed diagnosis and the notion that they are in no need
of support. This external high functioning presentation can lead to discrediting of the
struggles of autistic individuals, especially females using camouﬂaging, by therapists [99].
The high functioning outer presentation means that autistic females appear neurotypical
to society and clinicians, leading to missed diagnosis. As such, there is an expectation
for proper and socially aware behaviours [99]. Girls with undiagnosed autism are often
labelled as lazy or rude and suffer from bullying [99]. They may be criticized by par-
ents and teachers due to not abiding by neurotypical behaviours despite being seemingly
neurotypical [99].

Sexual education is another important issue that undiagnosed autistic females may
struggle with. Due to limited formal sex education, peer to peer education about norms and
safety is important and such informal education may be missed by autistic adolescents [99].
This may put autistic females at risk of sexual abuse, and indeed, there is a high incidence
of abuse in this demographic [70]. Consequently, autistic women should be provided
with the necessary information and education to allow them to navigate their sexual and
reproductive health [105].

Undiagnosed autistic females have been misunderstood and negatively labelled, and a
proper diagnosis can be immensely helpful. Even high functioning autistic individuals need
support [99]. Diagnosis would allow professionals to provide needed support, validate
needs, and help address issues. Furthermore, diagnosis facilitates support such as disability
beneﬁts and job inclusion [18]. It was also found that diagnosis helped foster a positive
sense of identity in women [70]. Moreover, a diagnosis can provide a rationale to the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1315

7 of 13

behaviours and combat criticisms from society, thereby alleviating blame [99]. Diagnosis
has also been shown to provide an explanation to past experiences, allowing the individual
to make sense of them [99].

After a diagnosis is made, women may initially feel distress [106], as diagnosis signifies
the end of a dream for normality [99]. Therefore, it is important to highlight potential strengths.

7. Management
7.1. Current Management

This section will cover the management and treatments of autistic individuals, in
general, which are limited. There are no speciﬁc treatments for autism for females, but being
aware of the differences in presentation and diagnosing and managing the co-morbidities
is essential. It is important to distinguish between the treatment of autism versus the
treatment of associated co-morbidities.

Management of autism normally involves strategies to reduce the impact of the autistic
traits on daily functioning, such as providing the training and support needed to function
independently [107]. This rehabilitation approach aims to increase physical comfort, reduce
anxiety, and improve the environment, such as by making it more predictable and reducing
sensory stimuli overload, which are helpful [1]. Autistic individuals, in particular girls,
should be educated in sexuality and safety due to the ineffectiveness of peer to peer learning
in this population [99]. There is also a need for wider societal acceptance of neurodiverse
behaviours and for that, education is important.

Psychosocial and behavioural therapies are the recommended therapies for autism [108,109].
It is important to note that RRBs may be coping strategies in autism, and as such, suppress-
ing these behaviours may be deleterious [18]. Autistic individuals suffer from bullying
and victimization, and as such, trauma informed care is important [1]. It is necessary to
provide a safe setting whereby the experiences of autistic individuals are validated [1].
Consciousness raising is believed to be beneﬁcial for autistic females, as it allows them to
untangle social expectations from their own desires [105].

Whilst there is no pharmacological treatment of autism itself, such treatments are used
for the co-morbidities. It is important to note that tangible treatments can have positive
placebo effects on autistic individuals, either directly or indirectly [110]. Additionally,
autism (and more so in ID) seems to be a marker of unpredictable adverse responses to psy-
chotropic drugs, and as such, drugs should be cautiously introduced at low doses [1]. There
is also a noted difference in the treatment offered to females compared to males: females are
more likely to be offered sedatives, while males are more likely to be prescribed a combina-
tion of medication [111]. In addition, when providing pharmacological treatment, special
attention should be provided to sex, due to the risk of female speciﬁc side effects [105]. For
instance, aripiprazole is one of the few atypical antipsychotic medications, typically used
to treat irritability in autistic children [112], that does not cause hyperprolactinemia and,
subsequently, gynaecomastia and galactorrhea. Additionally, certain medications used in
co-morbid ASD such as modaﬁnil for ADHD and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, can
reduce the efﬁcacy of medications used for contraception. These risks should always be
kept in mind and communicated to patients.

7.2. Future Management

This section will explore the future of autism management.
Consuming cannabis is believed to improve communication skills [113]. Cannabidiol,
a component of cannabis, is anxiolytic and neuroprotective [114]. This has led to the idea
of using cannabinoids as a treatment for autism [114].

There is some evidence supporting the use of glutamate neurotransmitter-modulating
agents in autism [115]. Memantine, which has been used as an adjunct therapy for ADHD
and OCD is one such example [116]. Use of Memantine in children and adolescents has
been positive, leading to reduced irritability and improved social interactions [117].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1315

The autonomic nervous system seems to play a role in social behaviour and emo-
tion regulation. Vagus nerve stimulation, a neuromodulation technique that stimulates
autonomic pathways, has been proposed as a treatment for autism [118]. There is some
evidence, though not conclusive, that vagus nerve stimulation may improve behaviour in
autism [118].

Although autistic individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal
disorders such as constipation [119], there is evidence of the inﬂuence of the gut micro-
biota on autism [120]. Work on gut microbiota, as a treatment modality, are still under
development [121].

Precision medicine is another potential avenue for autism treatment. Rare monogenic
forms of autism have allowed the identiﬁcation of pathways as potential therapeutic
targets [122]. Despite this rarity, common pathways seem to be involved in autism [123].
Treatments identiﬁed in this way, therefore, could be applied to broad patient groups, and
this implies the need to sub-classify autism based on the genes and pathways involved.

It is important to point out that more research is needed for the treatments discussed

in this section, and yet, these are only in early stages.

8. Conclusions

Autism appears to be less prevalent in females compared to males, with the male to
female ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:1, depending on the study and population (including
the ID population). The reason behind this difference is explained by two non-mutually
exclusive theories. The female protective effect theory argues that women have an inherent
protection against autism, while the female autism phenotype theory argues that current
diagnostic criteria, being biased towards males, can miss autistic females who present
differently. Autistic females seem to face less difﬁculties in social interactions, and their
RRBs seem to either be lower or more socially acceptable. In addition, females tend to
exhibit more camouﬂaging behaviours, which is associated with depression and suicidality.
Table 1 provides a summary of the differences between autistic males and females. All
of this, together with the societal perception of autism as a male disorder, makes it easier
to miss a diagnosis of autism in females. In people with ID and associated cognitive
impairment (such as executive function) may make it harder for them to use camouﬂaging,
thus explaining the lesser male to female disparity. Diagnosis of autism in women needs to
take these differences into account, and tools looking at the female presentation of autism
have been created. More research, however, is necessary for these tools to be used in the
clinic. Diagnosis of autism in females is important, as it can allow them to feel validated
and makes it easier to provide support. Autism is associated with several co-morbidities
and those common in autistic females include internalising disorders, eating disorders, and
hypermobility spectrum disorders. The treatment and management of these co-morbidities
need to be distinguished from that of autism itself. The management and treatment of
autism primarily seeks to lessen the functional impact of the autistic characteristics rather
than eliminating autism from the individual. There are interesting therapeutic avenues for
the future, ranging from the use of cannabinoids to gut microbiota to precision medicine,
which will hopefully improve the lives of autistic individuals.
