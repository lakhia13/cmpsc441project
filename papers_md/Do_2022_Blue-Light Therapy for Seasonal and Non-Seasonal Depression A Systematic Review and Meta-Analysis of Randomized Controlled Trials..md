Abstract
Objectives: To determine the efﬁcacy and safety of blue-light therapy in seasonal and non-seasonal major depressive disorder
(MDD), by comparison to active and inactive control conditions.
Methods: We searched Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo, and Clinicaltrials.gov through January 17, 2022, for ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) using search terms for blue/blue-enhanced, light therapy, and depression/seasonal affective
disorder. Two independent reviewers extracted data. The primary outcome was the difference in endpoint scores on the
Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - Seasonal Affective Disorder (SIGH-SAD) or the
Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement (SIGH-ADS)
between blue light and comparison conditions. Secondary outcomes were response (≥ 50% improvement from baseline
to endpoint on a depression scale) and remission rates (endpoint score in the remission range).
Results: Of 582 articles retrieved, we included nine RCTs (n = 347 participants) assessing blue-light therapy. Seven studies
had participants with seasonal MDD and two studies included participants with non-seasonal MDD. Four studies compared
blue light to an inactive light condition (efﬁcacy studies), and ﬁve studies compared it to an active condition (comparison stud-
ies). For the primary outcome, a meta-analysis with random-effects models found no evidence for the efﬁcacy of blue-light
conditions compared to inactive conditions (mean difference [MD] = 2.43; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], −1.28 to 6.14, P =
0.20); however, blue-light also showed no differences compared to active conditions (MD = −0.11; 95% CI, −2.38 to 2.16,
P = 0.93). There were no signiﬁcant differences in response and remission rates between blue-light conditions and inactive
or active light conditions. Blue-light therapy was overall well-tolerated.
Conclusions: The efﬁcacy of blue-light therapy in the treatment of seasonal and non-seasonal MDD remains unproven.
Future trials should be of longer duration, include larger sample sizes, and attempt to better standardize the parameters
of light therapy.

Introduction
Light therapy consists of daily exposure to bright ﬂuorescent
light that is typically delivered at home via a light device such
as a light box. Light therapy has been extensively studied in
seasonal affective disorder (SAD), but increasing evidence
suggests that it is also effective in non-seasonal major depres-
sive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression.1,2 Systematic
reviews and meta-analyses have found a moderate effect
size for light therapy compared to inactive controls, although
the signiﬁcant heterogeneity and the small sample sizes of the
included studies were highlighted as limitations.3–5 The stan-
dard protocol for light therapy for depression uses white light
at an intensity of 10,000 lux for 30 min per day during the
early morning for up to 6 weeks.6 Lux is a measure of illumi-
nation that varies with the distance to the light source. For
comparison, indoor social lighting is rated as less than 100
lux, bright ofﬁce lighting at 500 lux, outdoors on a cloudy
day at 5,000 lux, and outdoors on a sunny day at 50,000
lux or higher.7 Light
therapy is generally well-tolerated
with few or mild side effects.8

Although the precise mechanism of action of light therapy
remains unclear, it is hypothesized that alterations in circadian
rhythm, suppression of melatonin secretion, and modulation of
serotonin may be important contributory factors.9,10 Light is
the strongest synchronizer of circadian rhythms, with the circa-
dian effects of light acting through the eyes via the retinohy-
pothalamic tract, a direct neural pathway from the retina to
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is recognized as the
central biological clock in the brain.11 More recently, it was
shown that melanopsin, a photopigment located in retinal gan-
light.12
glion cells, modulates the circadian effects of
Melanopsin is particularly sensitive to wavelengths of light
in the blue color range (i.e., 450 to 480 nm),12 and low-
intensity blue light can shift circadian rhythms as effectively
as higher-intensity white light.13 In addition, melanopsin
plays an important role in suppressing melatonin production,
as well as improving alertness and neurobehavioral perfor-
the antidepressant
mance, which may mediate some of
effects of light.14,15 There is also evidence that blue light
may promote affective arousal and modulate emotional brain
responses, notably in areas involved in depression such as
the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus.16 These
recent ﬁndings suggest speciﬁc wavelength hypotheses for
light therapy for depression, including (1) blue light at low
intensity may be efﬁcacious, which could have advantages
such as fewer side effects and shorter treatment time than
higher intensity white light, and (2) enriching high-intensity
white light with blue wavelengths (we will refer to this as blue-
enhanced white light throughout the text) may be more effec-
tive than standard white light.

To our knowledge, there are no quantitative syntheses
looking speciﬁcally at the effects of blue-light therapy on
patients with seasonal and non-seasonal MDD. Previous
therapy focused on non-seasonal
meta-analyses of light

MDD and did not distinguish between speciﬁc wavelengths
of light.4,5 Our objective is to systematically review the liter-
ature on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using blue light
for depression and to examine the efﬁcacy and safety of blue
light for depressive disorders. We will compare blue light to
inactive and active control conditions. We will also conduct
sensitivity analyses for studies using low-intensity blue light
(deﬁned as below 1,000 lux) and for studies that included
only participants with SAD.

Methods

Literature Search and Study Selection

Items

The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO
(www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, CRD#42021239374) and
for
following Preferred Reporting
conducted
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide-
lines, but a protocol was not published. The systematic
search included studies up to January 17, 2022, and was con-
ducted using the following databases: Web of Science,
and
EMBASE (OVID), Medline
Clinicaltrials.gov. The search strategy contained the follow-
ing terms: (blue OR blue-enhanced OR blue-enriched OR
narrow-band OR wavelengths OR spectrum) AND (photo-
treatment”) AND
therapy” OR “light
therap* OR “light
(depress* OR “seasonal affective disorder” OR bipolar).
Medical subject heading (MeSH)
terms were included
when available. To look for additional studies that may
have not been captured by the original database search, we
performed backwards
reference chaining by searching
through bibliographies of relevant articles.

(OVID), PsycInfo,

Studies were included if: (1) they were published RCTs;
(2) the active intervention was low-intensity blue light or
blue-enhanced white light; (3) participants met diagnostic
criteria (e.g., DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10) for a major depres-
sive episode, seasonal or non-seasonal; and (4) a clinician-
rated measure of depressive symptomatology was used
[HDRS],17
(e.g., Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
Montgomery-Åsberg
Scale
[MADRS]18). Studies were excluded if: (1) the participants
had other comorbid conditions as a primary diagnosis; and
(2) the active intervention included a combination of light
therapy with another treatment (e.g., sleep deprivation) and
the comparison condition did not include the other treatment.
Abstracts, case reports, case series, and review articles were
also excluded.

Depression

Rating

Two independent reviewers (AD, VWL) screened titles
and abstracts of articles retrieved by the search for inclusion.
Potentially eligible articles were further reviewed by reading
the full text. Any initial disagreements between the reviewers
were resolved by joint review, discussion, and consensus or
through consultation with an independent
third reviewer
(RWL).

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers (AD, VWL) extracted the data
using a data extraction form designed for the study. Any dis-
agreement was resolved by consensus or through consulta-
tion with a third reviewer (RWL). Study authors were
contacted if eligible data were not reported in the paper.
The following data were extracted: participant demographics
(mean age, sex, and primary diagnosis), study characteristics
(design, duration, inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample size,
dropouts, and reasons for dropout), details of the active inter-
vention, and comparison conditions, outcomes measures and
scores at baseline and endpoint, response/remission rates,
and adverse events.

Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

We used version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for
RCTs19 to assess bias in the following categories: randomiza-
tion process, deviations from interventions, missing outcome
data, measurement of the outcome, selection of reported out-
comes, and overall bias.

Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome was the difference in endpoint scores
the Hamilton
on the Structured Interview Guide for
Depression Rating Scale - Seasonal Affective Disorder
(SIGH-SAD)20 or the Structured Interview Guide for the
Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale with Atypical
Depression Supplement (SIGH-ADS)21 between the active
and comparison conditions. The SIGH-SAD is a 29-item
clinical interview comprising the 21-item HDRS with 8 addi-
tional
symptoms. The
atypical depressive
SIGH-ADS is a 25-item clinical interview that includes the
17-item HDRS with the same 8 items for atypical symptoms.
Secondary outcomes included: (1) clinical response (≥ 50%
improvement from baseline to end of treatment score on a
clinician-rated depression rating scale), and (2) clinical
remission rates (endpoint score in the remission range). We
also examined tolerability using acceptability (all-cause dis-
continuations) and dropouts due to adverse events.

for

All outcomes were analyzed with the intent-to-treat
samples (ITT) if available. Since all the studies (except
Danilenko 2019) used either the SIGH-SAD or SIGH-ADS
as the main clinician-rated depression rating scale,
the
primary outcome was analyzed using mean differences
(MD) as a measure of effect size. If endpoint scores were
not available, change scores (endpoint minus baseline
scores) were used. The secondary outcomes were analyzed
using odds ratios (ORs). Outcome data were extracted at
the end of treatment for each study unless otherwise speci-
ﬁed. As per Cochrane recommendations,22 to guard against
the inﬂation of effect size for studies with more than one
intervention arm, either the results of all active treatment

747

arms were pooled as one intervention or the control group
size was divided by the number of active intervention
arms. For crossover studies, we included only data for the
ﬁrst arm of the crossover.22

to inactive conditions (e.g.,

For our primary analyses, we compared blue-light condi-
tions, which include both low-intensity blue and blue-
enhanced white light,
low-
intensity red light) and separately to active conditions (e.g.,
high-intensity white light). In addition, we conducted sensi-
tivity analyses of (1) studies using low-intensity blue light
to test the hypotheses that low-intensity blue light has efﬁ-
cacy compared to inactive conditions or may be equal or
superior to white light, and (2) studies including only SAD
participants.

Since we anticipated heterogeneity in study methodologies,
such as variations in the type of depression (seasonal MDD vs.
non-seasonal MDD), study duration, and type of control con-
dition, we used a random-effects model. Statistical heterogene-
ity was assessed using Q chi-square statistics and I2; an I2 of
50% to 70% suggests moderate heterogeneity and 75% to
100%, high heterogeneity.23 Publication bias was determined
with: (1) funnel plots of outcomes plotted against their stan-
dard error, (2) Rosenthal’s fail-safe N (the number of uniden-
tiﬁed negative studies that would need to exist to change the
result),24 and (3) Egger’s regression intercept (a statistical
test to examine asymmetry in the funnel plot).25 The Trim
and Fill procedure was used to impute missing studies if pub-
lication bias was suggested.26 The quantitative meta-analysis
was done using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.0
software (Biostat, USA).

Results

Study Selection

Figure 1 shows the PRISMA ﬂow diagram for the literature
search and study selection. The systematic search resulted
in 582 articles. Following the removal of duplicates, 342 arti-
cles were screened via title or abstract review, after which 12
articles were assessed for eligibility via full-text review.
Three articles were further excluded because the data on
the ﬁrst arm of the crossover was not available,27 the
design was not randomized,28 or the active intervention
was not low-intensity blue or blue-enhanced white light,29
resulting in a total of nine studies for the meta-analysis.30–38

Study Characteristics

Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the nine included
RCTs (n = 347 participants). Seven studies included partici-
pants with a primary diagnosis of SAD (MDD with seasonal
pattern), and two studies (Danilenko 2019, Lieverse 2011)
recruited patients with non-seasonal MDD; all the partici-
pants were
the DSM-IV,
DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-5 criteria. One study (Anderson

2009) included three patients with bipolar II disorder, but the
authors did not analyze the data separately for the bipolar
subgroup. All the studies involved middle-aged participants,
except for Lieverse et al., which included older patients. Most
studies had small sample sizes, ranging from 18 to 84
participants.

Eight of the included RCTs involved daily light exposure
without sleep deprivation for at least 5 days; one (Danilenko
2019) used a 6-day protocol consisting of partial sleep

deprivation alternating with morning light treatment, but
both treatment groups received sleep deprivation. The light
parameters for both the active and comparison conditions
varied across studies. For the active condition, six studies
(Anderson 2009, Anderson 2016, Glickman 2006, Meesters
2011, Meesters 2018, Strong 2009) used low-intensity blue
light, while two studies (Gordjin 2012, Lieverse 2011) used
blue-enhanced white light. The blue light intensities ranged
from 98 to 10,000 lux. The blue light wavelength remained

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 67(10)

consistent across studies, ranging from 450 to 470 nm. For the
comparison conditions, four studies (Anderson 2009, Gordjin
2012, Meesters 2011, Meesters 2018) used standard white
light
three
(intensity ranging from 711 to 10,000 lux),
(Glickman 2006, Lieverse 2011, Strong 2009) used dim red
light (intensity ranging from 23 to 201 lux), one (Anderson
2016) used an orange-appearing medium-wavelength light
(average intensity of 120 lux) and one (Danilenko 2019) used
orange-appearing glasses blocking wavelengths below 540 nm.
For all the studies except Danilenko et al. and Gordjin et al.,
the daily light exposure was either 30, 45, or 60 min per day.
The Gordjin et al. study had three treatment conditions: (1)
30 min standard light therapy, (2) 30 min blue-enhanced white
therapy, and (3) 20 min blue-enhanced white light
light
therapy. The study treatment durations varied from 5 to 42 days.

Risk of Bias Assessment

Figure 2 shows the summary of the risk of bias assessment
from the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Except for Lieverse
et al., all the studies showed an uncertain or high risk of
bias in at least one methodological category of risk. Only
one study (Lieverse 2011) described the allocation conceal-
ment process and had a low risk of bias for the randomization
process. None of the studies had a high risk of bias for devi-
ations from interventions, measurement of the outcome, or
selection of reported outcomes. For selective reporting, pre-
speciﬁed analysis plans were not available for three studies
(Danilenko 2019, Meesters 2018, Strong 2009), and as a
result, they were assessed to have an uncertain risk of bias.
Four studies (Anderson 2009, Anderson 2016, Glickman
2006, Strong 2009) had incomplete information on dropouts.
A potential risk of bias for several studies (Anderson 2009,
Anderson 2016, Gordjin 2012, Meesters 2018, Strong
2009) was that light device manufacturers funded the study.

Meta-Analysis

The primary outcome was the difference in endpoint scores on
the SIGH-SAD or SIGH-ADS between blue-light therapy and
comparison conditions. Six studies reported endpoint scores;
Strong et al. reported change scores and Glickman et al.
reported a between-group mean difference. We excluded
Danilenko et al. from the primary outcome analysis because
it was the only study that did not use either the SIGH-SAD
or SIGH-ADS. Since the control conditions included inactive
and active conditions, we reported them separately. Studies
comparing blue light to an inactive condition were considered
efﬁcacy studies, while studies comparing blue light to an
active condition were considered comparison studies.

Efﬁcacy Studies

Figure 3 shows the forest plots for blue light and control con-
ditions. For efﬁcacy studies, there was no difference between

blue light and inactive conditions in clinician-rated depres-
sive symptoms (MD = 2.43; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI],
−1.28 to 6.14, P = 0.20; 4 studies, total n = 169 participants)
(Figure 3A). There was moderate heterogeneity between the
studies, with Q statistic of 6.35 and I2 of 52.8% (degrees of
freedom [df] = 3; P = 0.10). The funnel plot of standard
errors by effect size estimates was broadly symmetrical, the
fail-safe N was 0 since the outcome was nonsigniﬁcant,
and the Egger’s intercept was 4.38 (two-tailed P = 0.17), sug-
gesting a low probability of publication bias.

For response rates, comparison to inactive conditions pro-
duced an OR of 1.93 in favor of blue-light therapy that was
not statistically signiﬁcant (95% CI, 0.96 to 3.88; P = 0.07;
3 studies, n = 149) (Supplementary Materials). There was no
heterogeneity between the studies, with a Q statistic of 1.38
and I2 of 0% (df = 2; P = 0.50). The unadjusted response
rates for blue light and inactive conditions were 56% and
41%, respectively. For remission rates, comparison to inactive
conditions revealed an OR of 1.21 (95% CI, 0.43 to 3.43; P =
0.72; 2 studies, n = 61) (Supplementary Figure 1B). There was
no heterogeneity between the studies, with a Q statistic of 0.57
and I2 of 0% (df = 1; P = 0.45). The unadjusted remission rates
were 55% for blue light and 50% for inactive conditions.

Comparison Studies

For comparison studies, there was no difference between
blue light and active conditions in the endpoint SIGH-SAD
or SIGH-ADS scores (MD = −0.11; 95% CI, −2.38 to
2.16, P = 0.93; 4 studies, n = 138) (Figure 3B). There was
no heterogeneity between the studies (Q statistic = 2.95; I2
= 0%; df = 4; P = 0.57), and a low probability of publication
bias (symmetrical funnel plot of standard errors; fail-safe
N = 0; Egger’s intercept = −1.68 with two-tailed P = 0.45).
There were also no signiﬁcant differences between blue
light and active conditions in response and remission rates
(Supplementary Figure 1C and D). For response rates, the
OR was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.36 to 3.82; P = 0.80; 4 studies, n
= 154) with moderate heterogeneity between the studies
(Q statistic = 6.07; I2 = 50.6%; df = 3; P = 0.11). The unad-
justed response rates for blue light and active conditions
were 69% and 66%, respectively. For remission rates, the
OR was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.49; P = 0.38; 4 studies, n
= 150) with no heterogeneity between the studies (Q statis-
tic = 2.30; I2 = 0%; df = 3; P = 0.51). The unadjusted remis-
sion rates for blue light and active conditions were 54%
and 60%, respectively.

Sensitivity Analysis

In total, six studies used low-intensity blue light ranging from
98 to 750 lux. These studies included only participants with
SAD. For efﬁcacy studies in SAD, there was no difference
between low-intensity blue light and inactive conditions (MD
= 3.47; 95% CI, −2.23 to 9.17, P = 0.23; 3 studies, n = 85).

Figure 2. Risk of bias assessment for included studies.

There was moderate heterogeneity between the studies (Q sta-
tistic = 5.95; I2 = 66.4%; df = 2; P = 0.05). For comparison
studies in SAD, low-intensity blue light performed similarly
to active conditions (MD = 0.52; 95% CI, −2.09 to 3.13, P =
0.70; 3 studies, n = 85). There was no heterogeneity between
the studies (Q statistic = 1.52; I2 = 0%; df = 2; P = 0.47).

Acceptability and Adverse Events

Regarding acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates), three
studies did not specify in which group they occurred, so a
meta-analysis was not possible; instead, we provide a qualita-
tive review. Common reasons for all-cause discontinuation
(Anderson 2009,
included a poor
response to treatment
scheduling conﬂicts
Anderson 2016, Glickman 2006),
(Anderson 2009, Glickman 2006), inability to follow treatment
schedule (Anderson 2009), medication switch (Lieverse 2011),
worsening of depression (Lieverse 2011) and medical illness
(Danilenko 2019, Meesters 2011, Meesters 2018).

Similarly, data on dropout rates due to adverse events were
reported inconsistently across studies and some studies did not
specify in which treatment group they occurred, hence a
meta-analysis was not possible and instead we provide a qualita-
tive review. Overall, both blue-light therapy and the comparison
conditions were well tolerated. The most common side effect
associated with blue-light therapy was headache. In total, three
participants (two in the Anderson et al. 2016 and one in the
Strong et al. 2009 studies) dropped out prematurely due to

side effects related to the study device. In the Anderson et al.
study, one patient in the blue light group dropped out after expe-
riencing a migraine and a “hot spot on the eye,” while one patient
in the white light group dropped out due a combination of head-
ache, migraine, eye strain and the report of a white ﬂashing light.
The Strong et al. study did not specify why the patient dropped
out. No switches to hypomania or mania were described, but
four studies did not report on switch rates.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review and
meta-analysis of RCTs of blue-light therapy for seasonal
and non-seasonal MDD. Overall, we found mixed results
for efﬁcacy and comparison studies. The meta-analysis
found no signiﬁcant difference between blue-light therapy
and comparison conditions (either active or inactive condi-
tions)
in reducing the primary outcome of depressive
symptom scores as measured by the SIGH-SAD or
SIGH-ADS. Hence, there is no current evidence supporting
the efﬁcacy of blue-light therapy since our primary and sen-
sitivity analyses for studies with inactive conditions were
both negative. On the other hand, the comparison studies
revealed that blue light and active conditions performed sim-
ilarly in both primary and sensitivity analyses. This may
suggest that low-intensity blue light could be as effective as
standard light
it must be
therapy conditions; however,
pointed out that the comparison between blue-light therapy

and active conditions was not powered for non-inferiority.
Regarding safety and tolerability, although we were unable
to provide a quantitative synthesis, the qualitative review
suggested that blue-light therapy was generally well-tolerated
by patients, with only mild side effects and no serious
adverse events or hypomanic/manic switches reported.

These results should be interpreted with caution given the
limitations of our meta-analyses. First, the included studies
had variable heterogeneity and quality. For example, the light
parameters for both active and inactive conditions, duration of
daily light exposure, and duration of study treatment varied con-
siderably across all the studies. Both seasonal and non-seasonal
depression were included, although the sensitivity analyses
with only SAD studies were no different than the primary
analyses. One study (Anderson 2009) also included three
patients with bipolar disorder. Regarding study quality,
only one of the nine studies had an overall low risk of
bias. Second, the included studies had small sample sizes
limiting their ability to
that were likely underpowered,
detect a treatment effect. Third, since all the studies were
of short treatment duration (with the longest duration only
6 weeks, in one study), the longer-term effects of blue-light
therapy remain unstudied.

Given these limitations, there are several possible expla-
nations for the lack of efﬁcacy of blue-light therapy reported
in our meta-analysis. First, the small number of included
studies may have led to the non-rejection of a false null
hypothesis (type II error). Second, the beneﬁt of blue-light
therapy may take longer to demonstrate than the short treat-
ment duration of the included studies. For example, clinical
the separation of active light
trials have suggested that

conditions from sham conditions may take four weeks or
longer.1 Third, there was considerable heterogeneity in the
type of light device used, ranging from larger light boxes
to small, portable LED devices. Compared to standard ﬂuo-
rescent light boxes, these smaller devices may have greater
variability in the positioning of the patient during use,
leading to suboptimal light exposure to the eyes. Finally,
although low-intensity blue light can suppress melatonin
and shift human circadian rhythms,39 the circadian effects
of light may not mediate its antidepressant effects. In SAD,
the evidence to support a circadian hypothesis for the antide-
pressant mechanism of light therapy remains sparse,40 and
alternate mechanisms have been hypothesized,
including
non-circadian effects of bright light on neurotransmitters
such as serotonin and dopamine.9,10,41 The lack of difference
between blue light and active conditions may be the result of
placebo effects since the comparison studies did not include a
placebo control condition to validate the efﬁcacy of the active
condition, or due to small sample sizes.

In summary, there is no current evidence for the efﬁcacy
of blue-light therapy in the treatment of seasonal and non-
seasonal MDD, according to our meta-analysis. However,
given our ﬁnding that blue light performed similarly to
active conditions, better quality studies are needed to demon-
strate the efﬁcacy of blue light in depression. Future trials of
blue-light
include
therapy should be of longer duration,
larger sample sizes, and attempt to better standardize the
parameters of light therapy. Further investigation is also nec-
essary to determine the optimal dosing parameters (e.g.,
intensity, spectra, duration of daily exposure) of
light
therapy for both seasonal and non-seasonal depression.
