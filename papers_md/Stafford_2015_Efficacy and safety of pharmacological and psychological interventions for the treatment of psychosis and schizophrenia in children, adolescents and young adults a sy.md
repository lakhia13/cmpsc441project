Abstract

Background

Studies report contrasting results regarding the efficacy and safety of pharmacological, psy-
chological, and combined interventions in psychosis and schizophrenia in children, adoles-
cents and young adults.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Embase, Medline, PreMedline, PsycINFO, and CEN-
TRAL were searched to July 2013 without restriction to publication status. Randomised tri-
als comparing any pharmacological, psychological, or combined intervention for psychosis
and schizophrenia in children, adolescents and young adults were included. Studies were
assessed for bias, and GRADE criteria were used to describe the quality of the results.

Results

Twenty-seven trials including 3067 participants were identified. Meta-analyses were per-
formed for 12 comparisons: symptoms, relapse, global state, psychosocial functioning, de-
pression, weight and discontinuation. Low quality evidence demonstrated that
antipsychotics have small beneficial effects on psychotic symptoms (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI
-0.58 to -0.26), and a medium adverse effect on weight gain (WMD = 1.61, 95% CI 0.61 to
2.60) and discontinuation due to side effects (RR = 2.44, 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.31). There were
no trials of psychological treatments in under-18 year olds. There was no evidence of an ef-
fect of psychological interventions on psychotic symptoms in an acute episode, or relapse

rate, but low quality evidence of a large effect for family plus individual CBT on the number
of days to relapse (WMD = 32.25, 95% CI -36.52 to -27.98).

Conclusions

For children, adolescents and young adults, the balance of risk and benefit of antipsychotics
appears less favourable than in adults. Research is needed to establish the potential for
psychological treatments, alone and in combination with antipsychotics, in this population.

Introduction

Early-onset schizophrenia, that is, schizophrenia occurring prior to 17 years [1], affects approx-
imately 1.6 to 1.9 per 100,000 of the child and adolescent population [2–5]. It is a severe and
debilitating disorder associated with considerable long-term impairments in psychological, so-
cial, educational and occupational functioning [6], poor physical health, reduced life expectan-
cy [7,8], and substantial direct and indirect costs [9,10]).

Compared with adult-onset schizophrenia, early-onset schizophrenia may be a more severe
disorder, negatively influencing social, cognitive and psychological development [6]. While anti-
psychotic medications play an integral role in the treatment and management of schizophrenia
in children, adolescents and young adults, the nature of adverse effects that can follow first expo-
sure occurs during a vulnerable phase of physical growth and brain development, and at a time
when young people may be particularly vulnerable to rapid weight gain [11] and disturbances to
the cardiometabolic system [12,13], bone growth [14] and sexual development [15]. Such health
risks raise important public health concerns given the widespread use of these medications [16].
Furthermore, children, adolescents and young adults are more likely than adults to exhibit nega-
tive symptoms, and less likely to exhibit systematized delusions and hallucinations [17]. This
has implications for the potential efficacy in children, adolescents and young adults of psycho-
logical interventions developed for adults with psychosis or schizophrenia. The increased recog-
nition of the limitations associated with antipsychotic medication has stimulated greater interest
in psychological interventions in this population [18]. A recent systematic review of interven-
tions for people who do not have established psychosis, found that psychological interventions
may have a positive impact if delivered before the onset of psychosis in individuals with attenu-
ated or transient psychotic symptoms [19]. Additionally, demand for psychological therapies in
general has also grown. In England, this has culminated in the Department of Health’s Improv-
ing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative, which is set to receive further funding
to extend to children, adolescent and young adults and to those with major mental health prob-
lems, particularly schizophrenia, under the UK coalition government’s mental health strategy
[20]. Finally, families may play an even greater role in providing care and support to children,
adolescents and young adults with schizophrenia compared to adults. Given the robust evidence
for the efficacy of family interventions in adult schizophrenia [21], these interventions may be
particularly promising in children, adolescents and young adults.

A previous review of antipsychotic medications for childhood-onset schizophrenia found

limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication in this population
[22], but searches were conducted in 2007 and the review did not include participants over the
age of 13 years. The evidence indicates there are few advantages of second-generation antipsy-
chotics over first-generation antipsychotics in treating psychosis [22], suggesting they could be
combined in a meta-analysis. Research in this field has advanced rapidly in recent years, and a

current review is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of pharmacological, psychological
and combination interventions in the treatment of children, adolescents and young adults with
psychosis and schizophrenia.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted as part of a clinical guideline for the
management of psychosis and schizophrenia in children, adolescents and young adults [23],
following a published protocol (see Appendix A in S1 File).

Eligibility criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials evaluating pharmacological, psychological or
combination treatment for children, adolescents and young adults (18 years of age or younger)
with a first episode psychosis (FEP) (a first experience of psychotic symptoms [24]) or a subse-
quent acute episode of psychosis or schizophrenia. Given the evidence from longitudinal neu-
roimaging studies demonstrating that brain growth continues into the twenties [25], and
epidemiological studies which show the incidence of schizophrenia rising in late adolescence
and early adulthood [26], we included studies in which the sample consisted of some partici-
pants under 18 years and some over 18 years, as long as the sample mean age did not exceed 25
years. We excluded studies of individuals with bipolar disorder only; studies of people who
failed to respond to previous antipsychotic medication (i.e. treatment resistant); studies com-
paring a single treatment without a placebo arm; studies containing less than 10 participants
per group; and studies not available in English. In addition, the current systematic review and
meta-analysis was conducted as part of a clinical guideline for England and Wales and there-
fore studies of drugs not licensed in the UK were also excluded.

Types of outcome measures

Primary

We examined symptoms of psychosis (total, positive and negative) and relapse, at post-

treatment and follow-up.

Secondary
We also analysed symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, psychosocial functioning,

global state, weight, and discontinuation due to side effects or for any reason.

Search Strategy

We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PreMedline, PsycINFO and CENTRAL from inception to
July 2013 (see Appendix B in S1 File for the Medline population terms and the full list of search
terms used across databases). In addition, we searched the reference lists of included studies,
excluded studies, and previous reviews, and contacted study authors and experts.

Assessment of Bias

Studies were assessed independently by two authors (MRS, CEL) using the Cochrane Collabo-
ration Risk of Bias Tool [27]. Disagreements were discussed with a third author (EMW) and re-
solved by consensus. Each study was rated for risk of bias due to: sequence generation;
allocation concealment; blinding of participants, assessors, and providers; selective outcome re-
porting; and incomplete data. Risk of bias for each domain was rated as high (seriously weak-
ens confidence in the results), low (unlikely to seriously alter the results) or unclear.

Due to the small number of trials, we were unable to assess publication bias formally (e.g.
using a trim and fill analysis) [28]. However, previous reviews have demonstrated systematic

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0117166 February 11, 2015

Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults

under-reporting of such interventions in mental health for children, resulting in effects that
have been systematically overstated and harms that have been systematically underestimated
[29]. Many of these interventions were developed before the introduction of mandatory trial
registration [30], rules with which manufacturers often fail to comply [31]. We believe there is
a high risk of publication bias because the addition of one or two small unpublished studies
could change our view of the relative benefits and harms of these interventions.

Data Management

For continuous outcomes, the magnitude of treatment effects were calculated as a standardised
mean difference (SMD), Hedges g [32]. A small effect was considered to be a SMD of between
0.00 and 0.49, a medium effect between 0.50 and 0.79 and a large effect >0.80. We also calculat-
ed the weighted mean difference (WMD) for weight and time to relapse when studies reported
the same measure. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for continuous outcomes when endpoint
and change data were included in the same analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, an overall risk
ratio (RR) was calculated. We analysed individually randomised units. When data were ex-
tracted in several formats that could not be combined directly in RevMan, we used the generic
inverse variance option. All outcomes are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall
effects were calculated using random-effects. Continuous effects were weighted by the inverse of
variance; dichotomous effects were weighted using the Mantel-Haenszel method [33,34].

Missing data were noted for each outcome. When dropout was not reported, we contacted
the authors. For both primary and secondary outcomes reporting data for completers as well as
controlling for dropout (for example, imputed using regression methods), we used the latter.
Subgroup analyses were conducted for different doses of antipsychotic medication, where

more than one dose was compared with placebo. We used the lower and upper dose ranges
identified by the Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health, United Kingdom Topic 10 bench-
marking exercise of antipsychotic prescribing in children and young people in practice [35], to
categorise doses administered in the included trials as either ‘lower’ or ‘higher’ doses of medica-
tion. Therefore, ‘higher’ doses are those exceeding the maximum dose stated in the manufac-
turers’ summary of product characteristics for that drug, and ‘lower’ doses are those under the
minimum dose stated in the manufacturers’ summary of product characteristics for that drug.
Because children, adolescents and young adults previously unexposed to antipsychotics may be
particularly vulnerable to weight gain associated with antipsychotic use [36], we also conducted
subgroup analyses for FEP and subsequent acute episode groups. FEP and subsequent acute ep-
isode groups were defined as reported by the trial authors.

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots, by performing the
Chi2 test (assessing the p value), and by calculating the I2 statistic [37,38], which describes the
percentage of observed heterogeneity that would not be expected by chance. If the p value was
less than 0.10 and I2 exceeded 50%, we considered heterogeneity to be substantial. Meta-
analyses were conducted using RevMan [39]. Confidence in the results was assessed using the
GRADE method [40], which is a structured assessment of the quality of evidence attending to
the following factors: (1) risk of bias; (2) inconsistency; (3) indirectness; (4) imprecision; and
(5) publication bias.

Results

Trial flow

This review was conducted as part of a clinical guideline for the management of psychosis and
schizophrenia in children, adolescents and young adults which identified 11969 potentially rel-
evant citations, for which 894 papers were retrieved. Of these, 829 were not relevant and were

excluded. The most common reason for exclusion was that the study was conducted in an
adult population and included no-one under the age of 18 years. Thirty studies were excluded
from this review with reasons (Appendix C in S1 File). Two studies [41,42] were not published
in English and were identified via an included systematic review of antipsychotic medication
for childhood-onset schizophrenia [22]. Nine trials await assessment (six trials were not pub-
lished in English, and three trials reported insufficient information in a conference abstract to
make an assessment, see Appendix D in S1 File) and four ongoing trials were identified (Ap-
pendix E in S1 File). Therefore, 27 randomised controlled trials reported in 52 published papers
were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis (Fig. 1).

Study characteristics

Pharmacological study characteristics

Nineteen included pharmacological trials assigned 2338 participants. The median sample
size was 75 (range 22 to 400) and 1552 (66%) randomised participants were male. Table 1 con-
tains the characteristics of included pharmacological trials. Comparisons included seven place-
bo controlled trials and 12 head-to-head trials. The median length of treatment was 8 weeks
(range 4 to 52) with only two trials reporting long-term follow-up assessments at 104 [43] and
156 weeks [44].

We conducted meta-analysis for seven pharmacological comparisons. Antipsychotic drugs

that were compared with a placebo included quetiapine [45], aripiprazole [46], risperidone
[47], paliperidone [48], amisulpride [49], olanzapine [50] and haloperidol [51]. The median of

1 Molindone was the third arm of this trial (n = 40), however as it was discontinued by its sole supplier, Endo Pharmaceuticals, on January 13, 2010, only
data for risperidone and olanzapine are used in this review
2 The study design consisted of an 8 week ‘acute phase’ and a blind ‘maintenance phase’ up to 52 weeks post randomization. During the maintenance
phase participants continued to be administered treatment within their randomised groups and at same dose range.
3 Loxapine was the third arm of this trial (n = 26), however it was not included in this guideline as it was discontinued in the UK in 2003.
4This trial included a fourth arm of paliperidone 6–12mg/day. The 3–6mg/day arm was selected as the ‘higher dose’ antipsychotic medication in
accordance with POMH-UK Topic 10 benchmarking exercise and therefore the 6–12mg/day arm was not included in the current work.

the mean ages was 15.5 years (range 15.4 to 20.0 years). None of these trials were conducted in
FEP. These trials were included in a meta-analysis of antipsychotic medications compared to
placebo and subgroup analyses were conducted for ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ doses of antipsychotic
medication (see ‘Data management‘). Total, positive and negative symptoms were measured
using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and global state was measured using
the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). A variety of measures were used to measure de-
pression including the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the PANSS-Depression; and psychosocial functioning
including the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and the Global Assessment of Func-
tioning (GAF). Relapse and anxiety were not measured in any trials of antipsychotic medica-
tion compared with placebo.

Additionally, head-to-head comparisons included risperidone compared with olanzapine
[44,52–56], haloperidol [22,53], quetiapine [55,57,58], and chlorpromazine [22]; and olanza-
pine compared with quetiapine [55,57,59] and haloperidol [43,53]. The median of the mean
ages was 15.5 years (range 11.0 to 24.5 years). Subgroup analyses were conducted for FEP and
subsequent acute episode groups. Total, positive and negative symptoms were measured using
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS). Global state and psychosocial functioning were measured using the CGI and the CAS
respectively. Relapse and anxiety were not measured in any of the included head-to-head trials.

Psychological study characteristics
Eight included psychological trials assigned 729 participants with a median sample size of
64 (range 30 to 309). The median of the mean ages was 22.3 years (range 15.0 to 24.0 years),
with no samples of exclusively under 18 year olds identified. Four hundred and fifty seven
(63%) randomised participants were male. The median length of treatment across trials was
22 weeks (range 10 to 65) and all trials except one [60] conducted follow-up assessments, with
a median follow-up of 78 weeks (range 26 to 260). All participants were either currently
experiencing FEP or a subsequent acute episode of psychosis or schizophrenia, apart from two
trials that were specifically designed to test a relapse prevention strategy following remission
from first psychotic episode [61,62]. Table 2 contains the characteristics of included
psychological trials.

We conducted meta-analysis for five psychological comparisons. Psychological interven-
tions included arts therapy, CBT and family interventions. Comparisons included individual
body movement therapy compared with group body movement therapy and a non-specific
dance therapy control [60]; CBT compared with waitlist [63]; CBT compared with treatment
as usual (TAU) [64,65]; CBT compared with supportive counselling [64]; CBT compared with
befriending [66]; CBT for acutely suicidal patients compared with TAU [67]; family CBT com-
pared with individual CBT [61]; and family plus individual CBT compared with TAU [62].
Three of eight included trials were conducted in a specialist Early Psychosis Prevention and In-
tervention Centre (EPPIC) in Australia, which offers a highly comprehensive service to people
aged 15 to 25 years with emerging psychotic disorders [62,66,67]. All participants in these

studies received TAU by the EPPIC centre. Appendix F in S1 File provides a detailed descrip-
tion of the psychological interventions used in the included trials. Total, positive and negative
symptoms were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
(SANS) was also used to measure negative symptoms. Relapse was measured using the BPRS.
Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Montgomery-Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia
(CDSS). Global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). Psycho-
social functioning and anxiety were not measured in any of the psychological trials.

Risk of bias

We rated risk of bias for each trial (Appendix G in S1 File) using the Cochrane risk of bias tool
[27].

Pharmacological trials
Nine out of 19 included pharmacological trials employed adequate methods of sequence
generation, however the risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment was unclear in
17 trials. Lack of blinding of assessors created a high risk of bias for some outcomes in two
studies and for 12 studies this was unclear. Five studies were at high risk of bias because partici-
pants or staff were not blind and for 11 studies this was unclear. There was a high risk of bias
due to incomplete outcome data for 15 included trials and only two trials were clearly free of at-
trition bias. Only nine studies were clearly free of selective outcome reporting; seven trials did
not report all outcomes and for two trials data were not reported in sufficient detail to be in-
cluded in meta-analysis. It was unclear whether three trials reported all outcomes.

Psychological trials
Four out of eight included psychological trials were considered to have employed adequate
methods of sequence generation, however the risk of bias owing to poor allocation concealment
was unclear for all trials. There was a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data for four
trials, and for one trial this was unclear. Four trials were at a high risk of selective outcome re-
porting, and for three of these trials, no data could be extracted for any outcomes.

Quantitative data synthesis

We analysed psychotic symptoms, relapse, global state, psychosocial functioning, depression,
weight and discontinuation of treatment. Summary of effects for all comparisons and all out-

A meta-analysis of antipsychotic medications compared to placebo was conducted because

of the small number of trials and participants, and therefore lack of statistical power, for any
single antipsychotic compared to placebo. Six of seven placebo-controlled trials reported data
for at least one outcome in sufficient detail to be included in this meta-analysis [45–50]. Sub-
group analyses were conducted for ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ doses of antipsychotic medication.

Eleven of twelve head-to-head trials reported data for at least one outcome to be included in
meta-analysis [22,43,52–59]. We analysed nine trials comparing two antipsychotics and three
trials comparing three antipsychotics. Subgroup analyses were conducted for FEP and subse-
quent acute episodes of schizophrenia.

Efficacy of antipsychotic medication versus placebo
At post-treatment, low quality evidence suggested small effects for antipsychotic medication

on total symptoms (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI-0.58 to-0.26) (Fig. 2), positive symptoms (SMD =
-0.42, 95% CI-0.56 to-0.28), negative symptoms (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI-0.46 to-0.18),

depression (SMD = -0.24, 95% CI-0.45 to-0.03), psychosocial functioning (SMD = -0.37, 95%
CI-0.52 to-0.23) and global state severity (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI-0.58 to-0.25), and a large effect
for global state improvement (RR = 1.89, CI 1.26 to 2.83). These effects remained small but sta-
tistically significant in subgroup analyses, with marginal decreases and increases in the size of
the effects for ‘lower dose’ and ‘higher dose’ groups respectively. However, the effect of treat-
ment was relatively small compared with change over time, even in the absence of intervention.
In one trial, PANSS scores fell approximately 20 points in the placebo group [45], constituting
a minimum clinically important difference of greater than 15 PANSS points as estimated by
Hermes et al. [68]. The difference between post-treatment mean scores between groups was ap-
proximately eight points, and in another trial, the difference between placebo and antipsychotic
treated groups was approximately nine points [48]. These differences are small and do not
meet this threshold.

Side effects of antipsychotic medication versus placebo
There was very low quality evidence for a medium effect on weight (kg), with antipsychotic
treated participants gaining significantly more weight than the placebo group at post-treatment
(SMD = 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.93) (WMD = 1.61, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.60), however there was sig-
nificant heterogeneity across studies (p = 0.0007, I2 = 68% and p = 0.00001, I2 = 84% respec-
tively). A large effect was observed for the number of participants gaining >7% of their
baseline body weight (RR = 3.62, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.17) (Fig. 3), however, there was no signifi-
cant effect for either of the ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ dose subgroups (‘lower dose’: RR = 3.25, 95% CI
0.68 to 15.52; ‘higher dose’: RR = 3.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 16.80). A large effect favouring placebo
was found for leaving the study early due to side effects at post-treatment (RR = 2.44, 95% CI,
1.12 to 5.31), however, there was no significant effect for either of the ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ dose
subgroups (‘lower dose’: RR = 2.53, 95% CI 0.87 to 7.34; ‘higher dose’: RR = 2.33, 95% CI 0.74
to 7.30).

Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults

Efficacy of antipsychotic medication in head-to-head trials
In very low quality evidence there were no significant effects between antipsychotics in
head-to-head trials for any of our included measures of efficacy, except a small effect for olan-
zapine on negative symptoms compared with haloperidol in FEP participants (SMD = -0.25,
95% CI-0.50 to-0.00), and a small effect for risperidone compared with quetiapine on positive
symptoms in FEP participants (SMD = -0.43, 95% CI-0.82 to-0.03). Relapse and anxiety were
not measured in any of the included head-to-head trials. Psychosocial functioning was not
measured in trials of olanzapine compared with haloperidol, and depression was not measured
in trials of risperidone compared with haloperidol.

Side effects of antipsychotic medication in head-to-head trials
For weight gain in FEP participants, very low quality evidence indicated a large differential
effect favouring quetiapine to olanzapine (RR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.61), and moderate dif-
ferential effects, favouring risperidone to olanzapine (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98), and on
haloperidol to olanzapine (SMD = 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.95) (WMD = 6.08, 95% CI 3.97 to
8.20). A large effect was observed in the FEP subgroup, favouring olanzapine to haloperidol,
for leaving the study early due to side effects at post-treatment (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to
0.85). In very low quality evidence there were no further significant effects on weight or leaving
the study early due to side effects, between antipsychotics in head-to-head trials.

Psychological quantitative data synthesis
Five of eight included psychological trials reported data for at least one outcome in sufficient
detail to be included in an analysis [61,62,65–67], however the comparators used in these trials
were considered to be too different to combine in a meta-analysis and so single pairwise com-
parisons were conducted.

Family and individual CBT compared to TAU at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Inter-

vention Centre

At 33 weeks post-treatment, there was low quality evidence that time to relapse was signifi-

cantly extended by 32.25 days in family plus individual CBT compared to TAU at EPPIC
(SMD = -3.26, 95% CI-3.94 to-2.59) (WMD = 32.25, 95% CI-36.52 to-27.98) (Fig. 4) [62].
Time to relapse was not reported at 130 weeks follow-up. However, the number of participants
relapsing was not significantly different between groups at 33 weeks post-treatment
(RR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08) or at 130 weeks follow-up (RR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.11).
No differential effects between groups were found for total or positive symptoms at either time
point, or for negative symptoms at 33 weeks post-treatment, however a medium effect favour-
ing TAU at EPPIC was found for negative symptoms at 130 weeks follow-up (SMD = 0.60,
95% CI 0.15 to 1.05). No significant difference was found between groups on psychosocial
functioning at 33 weeks post-treatment, however a small effect for psychosocial functioning
was observed at 130 weeks follow-up (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI-0.89 to-0.01). No differential ef-
fects between groups were found for depression or leaving the study early for any reason. Anxi-
ety and global state were not measured in this trial.

CBT compared with TAU in the UK
No significant differences were found for depression between CBT and TAU in the UK at
post treatment (SMD = -0.29, 95%CI-0.87 to 0.30) or follow-up (SMD = -0.05, 95% CI-0.63 to
0.52); or leaving the study early for any reason at post-treatment (RR = 1.94, 95% CI 0.85 to

4.43) or follow-up (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.52) [65]. Symptoms, relapse, global state, psy-
chosocial functioning and anxiety were not measured in this trial.

CBT plus TAU compared with befriending at EPPIC
No significant differences were found between CBT plus TAU at EPPIC and befriending at
post treatment for positive symptoms (SMD = -0.05, 95% CI-0.55 to 0.45), negative symptoms
(SMD = -0.44, 95% CI-.095 to 0.06), and psychosocial functioning (SMD = -0.40, 95% CI-0.90
to 0.11) [64]. These effects remained non-significant at follow-up: SMD = -0.08, 95% CI-0.58
to 0.42 (positive symptoms), SMD = -0.37, 95% CI-0.87 to 0.13 (negative symptoms) and SMD
= -0.08, 95% CI-0.58 to 0.41 (psychosocial functioning). No significant differences were found
between CBT plus TAU at EPPIC and befriending on leaving the study early for any reason
(RR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.76). Relapse, depression, global state and anxiety were not mea-
sured by this trial.

CBT compared with TAU for acutely suicidal patients at EPPIC
In a trial conducted in acutely suicidal participants, no significant differences were found
between CBT and TAU at EPPIC for leaving the study early at post-treatment (RR = 2.02, 95%
CI 0.72 to 5.66) [67]. The primary outcome in this trial was suicidality; however symptom and
global state data were also collected, but not reported in sufficient detail to be included in an
analysis. Relapse, depression, anxiety and psychosocial functioning were not measured in
this trial.

Family CBT compared with individual CBT
No significant differences were found between family CBT and individual CBT at post-
treatment for rates of relapse (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.68), and symptom data was collected
but not reported in sufficient detail to be used in an analysis [61]. Global state, psychosocial
functioning, depression, anxiety and numbers of participants leaving the study early for any
reason were not measured by this trial.

Discussion

Findings

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacological and psychological
treatments for children, adolescents and young adults with psychosis and schizophrenia. The
data set on antipsychotics includes 19 trials, with 2338 participants with a median mean age of
15.5 years (range 11.0 to 24.5 years). Low quality evidence suggests small effects for antipsy-
chotic medication on positive and negative symptoms, depression and psychosocial function-
ing and a large effect on global state, but also a medium effect on weight gain which increased
quickly, especially over the first six weeks of treatment, with a median of the mean change in
weight across antipsychotic treated participants of 1.25kg (range 0 to 4.3kg); and greater dis-
continuation due to side effects where this was reported. We note that in these trials the place-
bo groups improved substantially, with antipsychotics adding relatively small additional
benefit. Head-to-head trials of antipsychotics showed medium to large differential effects on
weight gain with olanzapine. However, most head-to-head trials of antipsychotics were under-
powered and the evidence was very low quality, making any comparisons between individual
antipsychotics unreliable.

The data set for psychological treatments amounted to eight trials, including 729 partici-
pants. Disappointingly, there were no psychological treatment trials for children or young peo-
ple under 18 years of age reporting data in a sufficient format to be included in an analysis; but
for young people under 25 years old, we found some low quality evidence that combining fami-
ly interventions with individual CBT had a strong, statistically significant effect on extending
time to relapse, although there were no differences in relapse rate. No significant beneficial

effects were found for psychological interventions for psychotic symptoms or for depression. It
was not possible to meta-analyse data from any of the psychological treatment trials, largely be-
cause of variation in controls, and we found no other statistically significant effects.

It is important to note, however, that in several psychological treatment trials, the control
conditions included active interventions which mirror the effect of the psychological interven-
tions in practice, where they are always administered in addition to treatment as usual. For ex-
ample, three studies [62,66,67] were conducted in EPPIC, a very intensive and comprehensive
treatment centre which includes an inpatient unit, an outpatient case management system,
family work, accommodation, prolonged recovery programmes, tailored group programmes
and clear, low dose medication protocols.

Limitations

The two most important limitations we identified for this review were the age range of partici-
pants in studies included and the quality of the evidence. The dataset for children, adolescents
and young adults under 18 years old is very much smaller than in adults (k = 10; n = 1217),
with no studies in under 18 year olds identified for psychological interventions. Furthermore,
most studies used outcomes measures that have been validated in adults. In addition, the quali-
ty of the evidence across the whole dataset was poor.

The quality of the evidence for antipsychotics was low or very low. Most trials were at high

or unclear risk of selection bias and some trials were rated as having high or unclear perfor-
mance and detection bias. However, we considered it unlikely that blinding of participants or
providers would introduce any important bias, and we did not downgrade for this reason. Only
two trials were rated as having low risk of attrition bias and less than half of the trials were
completely free of selective outcome reporting, with many studies not reporting all outcomes.
Two trials could not be included in any analyses because data reporting was inadequate. An-
other important reason for downgrading the quality of the evidence is the high risk of selective
publication bias. The small number of trials meant it was not possible to assess publication bias
formally (e.g. using a trim and fill analysis [28]).

Another limitation is the range of available outcomes, in particular relating to side effects.
Weight was the most consistently reported outcome across trials, while other potentially rele-
vant outcomes of antipsychotics, such as extrapyramidal side effects and other metabolic
changes, are reported far less frequently. Poor reporting of side effects also raises the possibility
of selective publication of outcomes and of whole studies, a practice that is common and leads
to overestimating the benefits and underestimating the harm of drug treatments [29]. Unfortu-
nately, it is not possible to be sure if all negative trials have been published.

The quality of the evidence for the psychological treatment trials was also low or very low.
Several studies were at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias and selective outcome reporting.
There was also a high risk of performance bias, but a low risk of detection bias across trials. As
with pharmacological trials, we did not downgrade outcomes due to the risk of performance
bias. Reassuringly, we found no evidence of psychological treatment trials being registered but
not published.

Conclusion

Compared to the substantially larger data-set for both pharmacological and psychological
treatment trials for adults with psychosis and schizophrenia [69], this review suggests that
while the efficacy of antipsychotics is similar in children, adolescents and young adults, side ef-
fects, in particular weight gain, are greater. The discontinuation rates due to side effects also
suggests that these drugs are not well tolerated and that the balance of risks and benefits for

Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults

antipsychotics may be less favourable in children, adolescents and young adults. This is in line
with previous reviews of antipsychotics in children that conclude the benefits of antipsychotic
medication are offset by the risks of serious side effects [22,70] and a cohort study demonstrat-
ing substantial weight gain following 12 weeks of treatment with antipsychotics [36]. The im-
provements observed for placebo treated groups in the current work points to a possible role of
support and the passage of time, in recovery. A recent study shows that the difference between
drugs and placebo becomes smaller as the length of the studies increase [71] and it remains to
be tested whether the endpoint level of recovery remains different after a longer follow-up. The
weight gain we have observed here, suggests that long, comprehensive investigations are need-
ed for a complete and balanced cost-benefit analysis of long-term use of antipsychotic drugs,
beginning in adolescence. In addition, the value of psychological treatments remains uncertain
and largely untested in the young. Trials of psychological treatments in adults, strongly suggest
that family interventions clearly and reliably reduce relapse rates and CBT reduces symptoms
and length of hospitalisation [69]; with similar effects for people with first episode psychosis
across all ages, both within and without early interventions services [21]. This could lead us to
infer that these treatments are likely to be effective in younger age groups. However, this cannot
be assumed for reasons such as cognitive immaturity. The lack of effect of psychological inter-
ventions on psychotic symptoms in our analyses suggests that similar benefits cannot be as-
sumed when using interventions developed for adults with children, adolescents and
young adults.

Psychosis and schizophrenia in children, adolescents and young adults are very serious and
debilitating illnesses, which in clinical practice usually leads to the use of antipsychotics. Howev-
er, in the absence of high quality evidence for the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication in
children, adolescents and young adults, their routine use in the treatment of psychosis and
schizophrenia should be undertaken cautiously. Furthermore, given the growing evidence that
antipsychotics are associated with often severe metabolic, neurological and other side effects as-
sociated with significant premature mortality [72], these drugs should only be used under spe-
cialist psychiatric supervision and with careful monitoring [23]. Moreover, the complete absence
of research on the effectiveness of psychological interventions in individuals under 18 years old
needs to be urgently addressed. This is practically important because young people should not be
denied potentially effective interventions because of an absence of research evidence. Although
treatments developed for adults cannot be assumed to have the same benefits in children, adoles-
cents and young adults, their benefits in first episode psychosis [21] suggests that family interven-
tions and CBT would be good candidates for further research in younger age groups.

This review, we hope, can be used as a platform from which we can develop new clinical and

research strategies, investigating pragmatic questions such as the benefits of combining family
and individual psychological interventions, how psychological interventions should be adapted
for children, adolescents and young adults, the benefits of psychological interventions alone and
with limited and targeted use of antipsychotics, the predictors of response for different treatment
approaches, and the most effective timing for interventions during the course of illness.
