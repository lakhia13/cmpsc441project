Background: The majority of long-term mental health problems begin during adolescence. Low mental health
literacy (MHL) may impede help-seeking for these problems. Although MHL is a multidimensional construct
and adolescent help-seeking can be through formal and informal means, little is known about how dimensions
of MHL inﬂuence these help-seeking intentions. This study examines associations between dimensions of MHL
and formal and informal help-seeking intentions among adolescents. It also investigates whether informal
help-seeking mediates the association between dimensions of MHL and formal help-seeking, and whether
these associations are moderated by gender. Methods: A cross-sectional survey including measures of MHL,
and help-seeking intentions was distributed to participants in 10 schools (12–17 years) across Scotland
(n = 734). Data were analysed using Conﬁrmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) and Structural Equation Modelling
(SEM). Results: Conﬁrmatory Factor Analyses identiﬁed two distinct dimensions of MHL: ability to identify a
mental health problem, and knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy. Only knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy was asso-
ciated with increased intention to seek formal and informal help. Ability to identify a mental health problem
was negatively associated with both forms of help-seeking intentions. Informal help-seeking mediated the
association between both forms of MHL and formal help-seeking. Gender did not moderate the associations
between MHL and help-seeking. Conclusions: Care should be taken when providing MHL interventions to
ensure that adaptive forms of MHL are promoted. Future research should investigate possible mechanisms by
which discrete forms of MHL inﬂuence adolescent help-seeking as well as investigating other potential moder-
ators of MHL and help-seeking, such as stigma.

Key practitioner message

(cid:129) We investigated how mental health literacy (MHL) impacts on formal and informal help-seeking intentions

among adolescents.

(cid:129) We identiﬁed two distinct dimensions of MHL: ability to identify a mental health problem, and knowledge

(cid:129)

of treatment efﬁcacy.
Increased knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy was associated with increased formal and informal help-seeking
intentions whereas increased ability to identify speciﬁc mental health problems was associated with
decreased formal and informal help-seeking intentions.

(cid:129) Effective MHL interventions for adolescents should focus on providing information relating to effective

treatments of mental health problems, which was associated with increased help-seeking intentions.

Introduction

Adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period for the
development of mental health problems, with approxi-
mately half of all problems emerging before the age of 14
(Kessler et al., 2005). Crucially, mental health problems
during this period can have a signiﬁcant impact on
health, educational and socioeconomic outcomes across
the life course (Kieling et al., 2011). However, the major-
ity of young people do not seek help for their problems
(Polanczyk, Salum, Sugaya, Caye, & Rohde, 2015). For
instance, in a study of adolescents in the United States,
Merikangas et al. (2011) found that nearly 64% of those

with clinical symptoms did not seek help from formal
services. This is concerning given that a study among UK
adolescents found that those who do not seek help are
seven times more likely to see a worsening of mental
health problems than those who do seek help (Neufeld,
Dunn, Jones, Croudance, & Goodyear, 2017).

While there are multiple factors which may inhibit
help-seeking, such as social stigma, limited access to
services, or negative perceptions of the therapeutic rela-
tionship, a lack of mental health knowledge is frequently
noted as a signiﬁcant barrier to effective help-seeking
(Radez et al., 2021). Indeed, adolescents are known to
have low levels of mental health literacy (MHL; Myers

et al., 2009; Olsson & Kennedy, 2010). For instance, in a
UK survey of 2702 young people (under 25 years) over
half of those surveyed stated that they did not seek help
for mental health problems because they did not under-
stand what it was they were going through (Young
Minds, 2018). To address this knowledge gap, MHL-
based interventions have been initiated around the world
to encourage early help-seeking for mental health prob-
lems among adolescents (Coburn, 2019; Rowling, 2015).
However, the evidence for MHL interventions is mixed
(Ma, Anderson, & Burn, 2022; Wei, Hayden, Kutcher,
Zygmunt, & McGrath, 2013). School-based MHL inter-
ventions are based on a theory of change, whereby
increased knowledge leads to behaviour change, which
ultimately leads to improved mental health outcomes.
However, most intervention studies do not assess for this
knowledge acquisition, but rather assess only changes
in outcomes (Cairns & Rossetto, 2019). As a result, it is
not possible to identify whether changes in these out-
comes are due to increased MHL, or which dimensions of
knowledge are more, or less, effective in mediating beha-
viour change. As such, mechanisms of change in MHL
interventions remain unclear. We argue that this lack of
nuance in understanding the speciﬁc dimensions of
MHL, and how they inﬂuence help-seeking behaviours
may be a key contributing factor to the mixed success of
MHL-based interventions.

Although there is a lack of clarity around the concep-
tualisation and measurement of MHL (Mansﬁeld, Pata-
lay, & Humphrey, 2020; Spiker & Hammer, 2019), it is
generally seen as a multidimensional construct. MHL
was originally deﬁned as ‘knowledge and beliefs about
mental disorders which aid their recognition, manage-
ment or prevention’ (Jorm et al., 1997, p. 184). This deﬁ-
nition proposed six dimensions of MHL, including the
ability to recognise speciﬁc disorders, and knowledge of
how to seek help. Subsequent conceptions of MHL
(Kutcher, Wei, & Coniglio, 2016) propose four dimen-
sions: how to obtain and maintain good mental health;
understanding of disorders and their treatments; stigma
reduction, and enhancing help-seeking efﬁcacy. This
reﬂects contemporary moves towards incorporating pro-
motion of positive mental health, and promotion of effec-
tive help-seeking behaviours.

Despite these multidimensional conceptualisations
(Kutcher et al., 2016; O’Connor, Casey, & Clough, 2014),
most studies typically measure MHL as a unidimen-
sional construct with a focus on knowledge of speciﬁc
mental health problems (O’Connor et al., 2014). In a sys-
tematic review of MHL and its’ measurement (Mansﬁeld,
Patalay, & Humphrey, 2020), only a single study aimed
to identify multidimensional factors of MHL (Campos,
Dias, Palha, Duarte, & Veiga, 2016). Even where studies
have conceptualised and measured MHL as multidimen-
sional, the individual dimensions are seldom explored
(e.g., the MAKS; Evans-Lacko et al., 2010). As a result,
there is a dearth of understanding in the associations
between domains of MHL and adolescent help-seeking.
It is likely that this absence of nuance in the conceptuali-
sation and measurement of MHL partly explains the
mixed evidence on the effectiveness of MHL-based inter-
ventions (Wei et al., 2013).

Help-seeking is a key dimension of MHL, and so
improving MHL among adolescents is vital to promoting
increased effective help-seeking for mental health

problems. Help-seeking may be formal or informal. With
regards to adolescents, formal help-seeking (e.g., spe-
cialist mental health services) may be mediated by par-
ents, family members or friends. This suggest that their
ﬁrst point of call will be these signiﬁcant others who pro-
vide informal help. Indeed, it is frequently noted that
adolescents prefer to seek help through such informal
avenues in the ﬁrst instance (Del Mauro & Jackson Wil-
liams, 2013). Evidence suggests that a lack of help-
seeking results in worsening mental health outcomes
for young people (Neufeld et al., 2017), the effects of
which may still be felt in adulthood (Hazell, 2007).

Good knowledge of mental health problems has been
shown to be associated with help-seeking (Ratnayake &
Hyde, 2019), and good MHL is a well-evidenced facilita-
tor of adolescent help-seeking (Gulliver, Grifﬁths, &
Christensen, 2012; Kelly, Jorm, & Wright, 2007). MHL is
typically rooted in theoretical models of behaviour
change such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB;
Ajzen, 1991), or Knowledge-Attitude-Behaviour models.
Central to these is that knowledge acts as a precursor of
behaviour change, supplemented by other factors such
as attitudes, or the perceived ease of performing such a
behaviour. While knowledge is not the sole mechanism
of behaviour change, it is necessary in implementing
such change.

Despite the evidenced association between MHL and
help-seeking, we currently lack clarity on how different
dimensions of MHL may interact with and inﬂuence
help-seeking intention. Very few studies have examined
whether speciﬁc dimensions of MHL are associated with
formal or informal help-seeking, and whether the associ-
ations between domains of MHL and formal help-
seeking are mediated by informal help-seeking.

In addressing the association between MHL and help-
seeking, we must pay attention to established gender dif-
ferences. It has been demonstrated that MHL tends to be
higher among girls (Haavik, Joa, Hatloy, Stain, & Lange-
veld, 2019). Boys have lower MHL and are less likely to
think education around mental illness is important (Wil-
liams & Pow, 2007). There are also gender differences in
preferred sources of help, for example, boys prefer to talk
to a parent, while girls are more likely to seek help from a
friend and are more willing to seek formal help (Chandra
& Minkovitz, 2007). There are also evidenced gender dif-
ferences in relation to the stigma towards mental health
problems (Dolphin & Hennessy, 2016), and stigma is
another key barrier to help-seeking. It is important to
account
for these gender differences and examine
whether gender moderates the association between
dimensions of MHL and forms of help-seeking.

The current study aims to ﬁll existing research gaps
by investigating associations between domains of MHL,
and formal and informal help-seeking. Additionally, we
aimed to examine the extent to which informal help-
seeking mediates the association between MHL and for-
mal help-seeking intention among adolescents. Finally,
we investigate whether gender moderates the associa-
tions between MHL and help-seeking constructs.

(n = 734) attending secondary schools in Scotland. The sample

was 46.9% male. Participants were aged 12–17 years, with an
average age of 14.23 years (SD 1.51). 88.4% of participants were
White, which is in line with the ethnicity proﬁle of Scotland (i.e.,
96% White; Ofﬁce for National Statistics, 2020). Descriptive
statistics are in Table S1.

Measures
The term ‘mental health problems’ was operationalised during
the study, rather than ‘mental illness’ or referring to speciﬁc
diagnoses. Our deﬁnition of ‘mental health problems’ is listed in
the supporting information, and was created following cognitive
interviewing of adolescents during piloting, allowing for a devel-
opmentally valid deﬁnition of ‘mental health problems’.

Mental health literacy
Mental health literacy was measured using the Mental Health
Knowledge Schedule (MAKS; Evans-Lacko et al., 2010). The
MAKS is a 12-item questionnaire measuring two constructs.
Six questions measure participants’ mental health-related
knowledge (e.g., knowledge of treatment, recognition of mental
health problems), while another six measure participants ability
to recognise various mental health conditions (e.g., depression).
Items are measured on a 5-point scale (1 = ‘strongly disagree’ to
5 = ‘strongly agree’). We selected the MAKS as it was one of the
well-known MHL measures and has good retest reliability with
adult samples (Wei, McGrath, Hayden, & Kutcher, 2015). How-
ever, the MAKS was originally developed for adult participants
and although it has been used in previous research with adoles-
cents, measures of internal consistency were low (Chisholm
et al., 2016: Mansﬁeld, Humphrey, & Patalay, 2020). Addition-
ally, there is no previous systematic evaluation of the factor
structure to conﬁrm its hypothesised dimensions in adolescent
samples.

To address these limitations and examine the dimensions of
MHL in an adolescent sample, we undertook a conﬁrmatory fac-
tor analysis (CFA) by testing the factor structure of the MAKS
following a model generation approach (Joreskog, 1993). Analy-
sis of the original two-factor model of the MAKS (one relating to
domains of mental health knowledge and one relating to levels
of recognition of mental health conditions) indicated a poor
model ﬁt: v2 (53) = 449.897, p < .001; RMSEA = .101 (90%
Conﬁdence Interval
.110); CFI = .681; TLI = .602;
SRMR = .0843. Factor loadings were also low for several items.

.093,

Following Garcia, Golay, Favrod, and Bonsack (2017), we
eliminated negatively worded items (6, 8 and 12) which had very
low factor loadings. Additionally, we excluded two further items
(1: Most people with mental health problems want to have paid
employment, and 2: If a friend had a mental health problem, I
know what advice to give them to get professional help) with low
factor loadings. The face validity of these items as a measure of
MHL was also problematic given their focus on attitudes and
help-giving. Additionally, item 5 (people with severe mental
health problems can fully recover) had a borderline acceptable
factor loading (0.319), so was removed and model ﬁt reassessed.
Item 11 (assessing whether participants recognise drug addic-
tion as a mental health problem) was also removed due to low
factor loadings and the model reanalysed for improved ﬁt. A new
proposed model consisting of 5-items was a better ﬁt to the data
v2 (4) = 2.663, p = .616; RMSEA = .000 (90% Conﬁdence Interval
.000, .046; CFI = 1.00; TLI = .999; SRMR = .0133) with clear con-
ceptual dimensions (Figure S1).

The ﬁrst factor was named knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy
and consists of two items (3: Medication can be an effective treat-
ment for people with mental health problems, and 4: Psychother-
apy can be an effective treatment for people with mental health
problems). The second factor was named ability to identify men-
tal health problems and consists of three items (Say whether
you think each condition is a type of mental health problem:
schizophrenia, depression, bi-polar disorder).

Intended help-seeking
Intended help-seeking was measured using the General
Help Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ; Wilson, Deane, Ciarrochi,

& Rickwood, 2005). The GHSQ is a 10-item measure, which
investigates intended help-seeking on two subscales: formal
and informal. Due to the age of participants, one item assessing
help-seeking from an ‘intimate partner’ was excluded. The scale
used for analysis therefore contained eight items with ﬁve mea-
suring formal and three measuring informal help-seeking.
Items are rated from 1 (extremely unlikely to seek help) to 7 (ex-
tremely likely). The GHSQ is designed to be used with secondary
school aged participants and has good internal consistency
(Cronbach’s alpha = .85), and test–retest reliability (.92) (Wilson
et al., 2005).

A CFA examining the factorial validity of the proposed two
factor GHSQ model (formal and informal intended help-seeking)
in the current study was of good model ﬁt: v2 (19) = 102.792,
p < .001; RMSEA = .078 (90% Conﬁdence Interval .063, .093);
CFI = .943; TLI = .917; SRMR = .0427 (Figure S2).

Gender
Due to noted gender differences in relation to MHL and help-
seeking, gender was included as a moderator of MHL constructs
and formal and informal help-seeking. A binary measure of gen-
der (male/female) was included for analysis. While participants
were offered the option of ‘other’ this subsample was small
(n = 3), and therefore were excluded from all analyses.

Covariates
Several sociodemographic characteristics associated with MHL
and help-seeking were used as covariates in the study. Ethnicity
was based on UK census categories. Due to a small proportion
of participants from minority ethnic backgrounds (n = 83), eth-
nicity was dummy coded to represent White (1) and other ethnic
groups (0). Age was measured as age in years at time of survey
completion. Family subjective socioeconomic status (SES) was
measured by asking participants to respond to the question
How well off do you think your family is? (Currie et al., 2014).
Responses were originally measured on a 5-point scale (1 ‘Very
well off’, to 5 ‘not at all well off’) (Svedberg, Nygren, Staland-
Nyman, & Nyholm, 2016), but recoded as ‘Low-Medium SES’ (0)
and ‘High SES’
to address skewness in participants
responses. School neighbourhood deprivation was measured
using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) tercile
(‘low’ = 1; ‘mid-range’ = 2; ‘high’ = 3). The SIMD measures and
identiﬁes areas of poverty and inequality in Scotland (Scottish
Government, 2016) and higher scores represent lower levels of
deprivation.

Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling
(SEM). In the ﬁrst stage, Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis was used
to assess the validity of measurement constructs used within
the research. Then, we tested the structural model to examine
hypothesised associations between dimensions of MHL and
help-seeking intentions. Finally, multi group SEM was used to
evaluate the moderating effect of gender on the associations
between dimensions of MHL and help-seeking intentions. All
models were evaluated using current rules of thumb with Root
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) values < than
0.5; Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI)
value of >.90; and Standardised Root Mean Square Residual
(SRMR) values <.08 indicative of acceptable model ﬁt
(Chen, 2007). Results from multigroup analysis were evaluated
using changes in CFI > .01, RMSEA > .015 and SRMR > .030
to indicate invariance in hypothesised associations across
groups (Putnick & Bornstein, 2016). All analyses were reported
using a bias-corrected bootstrapping method with 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals. SEM analyses were undertaken using IBM
SPSS AMOS version 27.

Missing data
Little’s test was signiﬁcant (v2 [5183] = 5675.126, p < .001),
indicating that the data was not missing completely at random
(MCAR). However, the percentages of missingness at item level
were small (0.03%–9%) therefore, Expectation Maximisation

(EM: Graham, 2009) was used to impute missing data, as is rec-
ommended when data is MAR, or when the percentage of miss-
ing data is small (Allison, 2001). This is known to be similarly
accurate to imputation via chained equations (Lin, 2010).

The methods and results reported in this article were part of
a larger study which also collected data relating to adolescents’
levels of personal and perceived stigma towards mental health
problems. For an overview of the study as a whole, please refer
to our previously published research (Goodfellow, Sosu, Macin-
tyre & Knifton, 2021; Goodfellow, 2020).

Results

Descriptive results
Descriptive ﬁndings (Table S1 & S2) indicate high levels
of MHL. Overall, adolescents reported high levels of
knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy (M = 7.58; SD = 1.55)
and ability to recognise speciﬁc mental health problems
(M = 13.40; SD = 1.98). Mean scores for forms of help-
seeking intention show that adolescents were more likely
to use informal sources of help (M = 4.79, SD = 1.37) than
formal sources (M = 3.11, SD = 1.28).

Associations between dimensions of MHL and
forms of help-seeking
Analysis testing the hypothesised direct and indirect
association between dimensions of MHL, and forms of
help-seeking intention (Figure 1) were examined consid-
ering all covariates. Findings indicated a good model
ﬁt (v2 (59) = 175.738, p < .001; RMSEA = .052 (90%
Conﬁdence Interval .043, .061); CFI = .947; TLI = .930;
SRMR = .0415) and all estimates were theoretically
meaningful (Table S3).

Direct associations between dimensions of MHL
and forms of help-seeking
Results indicate a positive association between knowl-
edge of treatment efﬁcacy and informal help-seeking
intention (b = .154, p = .015) and formal help-seeking
intention (b = .158, p = .003). In other words, adolescents
who reported higher levels of knowledge of treatment
efﬁcacy were more likely to report higher levels of formal
and informal help-seeking intentions. On the other
hand, ability to identify a mental health problem was
negatively associated with both informal (b = (cid:1).204,

p = .012) and formal help-seeking intentions (b = (cid:1).089,
p = .049) indicating that adolescents who report higher
ability to identify a mental health problem were less
likely to report intentions to seek informal and formal
help for mental health problems.

Indirect association between MHL and help-
seeking intentions
Knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy demonstrated a positive
indirect association with formal help-seeking intention
via informal help-seeking intention (b = .092, p = .017).
Speciﬁcally, adolescents with higher knowledge of treat-
ment efﬁcacy were more likely to report higher intention
to seek informal help, and those with higher informal
help-seeking intentions report a higher intention to seek
formal help. Participants’ ability to identify a mental
health problem, on the other hand, had a negative indi-
rect association with formal help-seeking intention via
informal help-seeking intention (b = (cid:1).121, p = .011).
Adolescents with a greater ability to recognise a mental
health problem were more likely to report reduced inten-
tion to seek informal help, and those with lower intention
to seek informal help were more likely to report reduced
intention to seek formal help.

Total effects of MHL on help-seeking
The total effect of knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy was
positive for both informal (b = .154, p = .015) and formal
help-seeking intentions (b = .250, p = .003). This shows a
strong association between knowledge of effective treat-
ments and help-seeking intentions. However, ability to
recognise a mental health problem showed a negative
association with both informal (b = (cid:1).204, p = .012) and
formal help-seeking intentions (b = (cid:1).210, p = .008), indi-
cating that this form of knowledge is associated with
lower help-seeking intentions.

Moderating effect of gender
Multigroup invariance analysis was used to evaluate any
gender differences by estimating models simultaneously
for both male and female participants, and by assessing
unconstrained model ﬁt, then adding constraints ﬁrst to
intercepts and path coefﬁcients
factor
(Table S4). The fully constrained model was compared to

loadings,

the unconstrained model
to assess for invariance.
Changes in all ﬁt indices were within acceptable parame-
ters (DCFI = .005; DSRMR = .0003; DRMSEA = .005,
Chen, 2007). Thus, invariance was supported, and gen-
der was not identiﬁed as a moderator of MHL and help-
seeking intention in an adolescent sample.

Discussion

among

intentions

We aimed to discern whether distinct dimensions of
MHL are differentially associated with formal and infor-
mal help-seeking
adolescents,
whether there is in an indirect effect of informal help-
seeking on formal help-seeking, and whether gender
moderates these associations. We demonstrate that
while higher knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy was associ-
ated with higher likelihood of reporting formal and infor-
mal help-seeking intentions, ability to identify a mental
health problem was associated with lower help-seeking
intention. Informal help-seeking intention mediated the
association between both forms of MHL and formal help-
seeking intention. Gender did not moderate the associa-
tion between MHL and help-seeking intention. To the
best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to identify
that some dimensions of MHL, speciﬁcally adolescents’
ability to discern what is, and what is not a mental
health problem, are associated with lower likelihood of
reporting intention to seek help.

Results of SEM analyses identiﬁed a mediating effect
of informal help-seeking intention, indicating that infor-
mal help-seeking intention represents a potential mech-
anism by which MHL can affect formal help-seeking.
This is particularly important as research has noted that
while adolescents are less likely to seek formal help
(Radez et al., 2021), formal help-seeking serves as a pro-
tective factor against worsening mental health (Neufeld
et al., 2017). Therefore, it is important to develop strate-
gies that encourage informal help-seeking among ado-
lescents, as this may inﬂuence formal help-seeking
intention.

We found that ability to identify a mental health prob-
lem was negatively associated with formal and informal
help-seeking intentions. MHL is frequently conceptu-
alised by focussing on recognition of mental disorders
(Mansﬁeld, Patalay, & Humphrey, 2020). This may pro-
mote a psychiatric and biogenetic conceptualisation of
mental health problems (Read, 2007), which has been
demonstrated to be associated with erroneous beliefs
about dangerousness and unpredictability of
those
experiencing a mental health problem (Kvaale, Haslam,
& Gottdiener, 2013). Conceptualising MHL based on
recognition of diagnostic labels may therefore lead to
negative attitudes, such as stigma towards those experi-
encing mental health problems (Kinderman, Read, Mon-
crieff, & Bentall, 2013; Schomerus et al., 2012). For
instance, evidence suggests that perceived stigma
around these diagnoses may be why this dimension of
MHL is associated with reduced help-seeking intention
(Gulliver et al., 2012). For this reason, it is important to
note that both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were
included within the ‘ability to identify a mental health
problem’ dimension in our study, both of which are
known to receive high degrees of stigma within an ado-
lescent population (DuPont-Reyes, Villatoro, Phelan,
Painter, & Link, 2020; Yoshioka, Reavley, MacKinnon,

& Jorm, 2014). Therefore, the negative associations
between ability to identify a mental health problem, and
willingness to seek formal and informal help, may in part
be due to the stigma towards such mental health condi-
tions. Furthermore, research has noted that different
aspects of stigma (e.g., personal and perceived stigma, or
explicit and implicit stigma) may be differently associ-
ated with help-seeking intention (Ma et al., 2022;
Nearchou et al., 2018). There exists a complex relation-
ship between MHL, stigma and help-seeking, as a result,
we cannot generalise the current ﬁndings to knowledge
of other mental disorders, and future research should
investigate if associations with help-seeking differ by
severity or typology of mental health conditions, and
how discrete components of MHL may impact different
forms of stigma towards mental ill health.

Previous research (Mansﬁeld, Humphrey, & Pata-
lay, 2020) has noted a correlation between MHL, when
measured by the MAKS (Evans-Lacko et al., 2010), and
help-seeking intention when measured by the GHSQ
(Wilson et al., 2005), both of which were used in the cur-
rent study. However, the association was ‘very small’
(Mansﬁeld, Humphrey, & Patalay, 2020, p. 287). Based
on our ﬁndings, we argue that this may be due to the dif-
fering associations that dimensions of MHL contained
with the MAKS may have on help-seeking intentions.
Namely that increased ability to identify a mental health
problem is associated with decreased help-seeking
intention, while knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy is asso-
ciated with increased intention.

In relation to gender differences, we found that the
hypothesised associations between the MHL and help-
seeking were similar for boys and girls. This indicated
that among our sample, gender did not moderate the
associations between MHL constructs and formal or
informal help-seeking intention. However, our ﬁndings
do align with research which has found limited effects of
gender on MHL (Furnham, Annis, & Cleridou, 2014). As
stigma is known to demonstrate gender differences and
is a known deterrent to help-seeking, future research
should also investigate the role of stigma as a moderat-
ing factor in the relationship between MHL and help-
seeking intention.

Limitations and future research
The results must be interpreted with an awareness of
key limitations. First, we did not ask participants
whether they had previously sought help for a mental
health problem. Therefore, it is not possible to evaluate
whether those who have experience of
formal help-
seeking responded differently to service-na€ıve counter-
parts. This may be a beneﬁcial avenue for future
research.

Second, while there is a growing awareness that
young people are turning to the internet and social
media for support (Pretorius, Chambers, & Coyle, 2015),
this was not measured in the current study, and items
in the General Help Seeking Questionnaire (Wilson
et al., 2005), which refer to ‘helplines’ may be outmoded
for adolescents in a contemporary context.

Third, we measured intended help-seeking, not actual
help-seeking. While help-seeking intention predicts
help-seeking behaviour (Wilson et al., 2005), beha-
vioural intentions do not always lead to actual behaviour
(Armitage & Conner, 2001). It is vital to consider factors

such as self-efﬁcacy and availability of and access to
mental health services, which are equally crucial for
actual help-seeking behaviour (Rimal, 2001). It may be
useful for future work to assess longitudinally whether
the dimensions of MHL identiﬁed in our study are asso-
ciated with subsequent help-seeking behaviour, as well
as to look at broader sociocontextual factors such as
availability of services. Additionally, like other studies,
we examined association between MHL and help-
seeking intention and not behaviour, and as a result
caution is needed in inferring causality with behaviour.

of

Fourth,

our use

the MAKS (Evans-Lacko
et al., 2010) allowed us to identify that increased ability
to identify a mental health problem was associated with
decreased help-seeking intention. It may be that mental
health problems contained in the MAKS, such as
schizophrenia are less familiar to adolescents, and may
not have captured dimensions of MHL in which adoles-
cents have greater knowledge. However, the aim of the
current study was to capture discrete dimensions,
rather than a broader overview of adolescent MHL. Addi-
tionally, the MAKS was not designed to capture all com-
ponents of MHL, such as knowledge of how to seek help,
and so all dimensions were not captured in the current
study. Relatedly, the nature of our analysis means only
5 of the 12 items of the MAKS (i.e., those that were
included in the two-factor structure of MHL) were inves-
tigated for their associations with help-seeking inten-
future research should investigate
tion. Therefore,
additional dimensions of MHL, including those relating
to positive mental health and determine whether their
impact on help-seeking intentions is similar to the
results we report here.

Finally,

the cross-sectional design allowed us to
explore associations, but limits our ability to make cau-
sal interferences. Future studies should consider longi-
tudinal and naturalistic experiments or intervention
studies to examine causal pathways between discrete
dimensions of MHL and both formal and informal help-
seeking intentions among adolescents.

Conclusions

This article has demonstrated the importance of
adopting a nuanced approach to the study of MHL and
its relationship with help-seeking intentions among
adolescents. The current research extends previous
work in adolescent MHL and help-seeking by delineating
speciﬁc dimensions of MHL which may be associated
with the help-seeking intention among adolescents. We
identiﬁed that while knowledge of treatment efﬁcacy is
associated with higher likelihood of formal and informal
help-seeking; ability to identify a mental health problem
was associated with lower likelihood of intentions to seek
help. Findings demonstrate that some speciﬁc dimen-
sions of MHL may be associated with lower likelihood of
help-seeking intention and therefore, should not be the
sole focus of MHL interventions. Speciﬁcally, our results
suggest that among adolescents,
information about
speciﬁc mental health problems are not sufﬁcient to
increase help-seeking intentions, but rather, knowledge
of effective treatments should be central to MHL-based
discussion to increase adolescents’ willingness to seek
help.
