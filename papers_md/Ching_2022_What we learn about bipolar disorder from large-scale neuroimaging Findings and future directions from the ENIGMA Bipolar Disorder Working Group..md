Abstract

MRI-derived brain measures offer a link between genes, the environment and behav-

ior and have been widely studied in bipolar disorder (BD). However, many neuroimag-

ing studies of BD have been underpowered, leading to varied results and uncertainty

regarding effects. The Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis

(ENIGMA) Bipolar Disorder Working Group was formed in 2012 to empower discov-

eries, generate consensus findings and inform future hypothesis-driven studies of

BD. Through this effort, over 150 researchers from 20 countries and 55 institutions

pool data and resources to produce the largest neuroimaging studies of BD ever con-

ducted. The ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group applies standardized

processing and analysis techniques to empower large-scale meta- and mega-analyses

of multimodal brain MRI and improve the replicability of studies relating brain varia-

tion to clinical and genetic data. Initial BD Working Group studies reveal widespread

patterns of lower cortical thickness, subcortical volume and disrupted white matter

integrity associated with BD. Findings also include mapping brain alterations of com-

mon medications like lithium, symptom patterns and clinical risk profiles and have

provided further insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of BD. Here we dis-

cuss key findings from the BD working group, its ongoing projects and future direc-

tions for large-scale, collaborative studies of mental illness.
