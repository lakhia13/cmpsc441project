Abstract
Background  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about far more stressful conditions for people worldwide. As a 
vulnerable group, older adults have suffered various psychological problems, such as stress, because of this pandemic 
and have applied various strategies to cope with the dire consequences. This study aimed to synthesize qualitative 
evidence regarding coping strategies for stressful situations among older adults throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods  We searched electronic databases, including Scopus, Embase, PubMed, ProQuest, and the Cochrane 
Library, based on PRISMA standards. The protocol of this systematic review was registered on the PROSPERO 
(registration code: CRD42022364831). All relevant English-language articles published between 2019 and November 
10, 2022, were searched. We reviewed the reference lists for all the included studies and key references. Two reviewers 
conducted screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal independently, with disagreements resolved by 
consensus with all team members. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist was used to assess the quality of studies. 
A thematic synthesis of the selected studies was conducted.

Results  We included 13 studies in our review. Most studies were conducted in the early months of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was classified into six categories: health management 
challenges, stress caused by quarantine, economic challenges, media and bad news stress, virus threats, and 
challenges related to the use of communication technologies. The strategies used by older adults to cope with 
these challenges were categorized into five categories: protective strategies, avoidance strategies, maintaining social 
connections, meaning-based strategies, and fun strategies. This research showed that depending on the situation and 
conditions, older adults use various strategies to cope with COVID-19.

Conclusion  Older adults experience much stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In most cases, older adults can 
cope with these challenges with simple strategies from previous experiences and learnings. Older people require 
educational interventions in some cases, such as those involving communication skills. A better understanding of 
older adults coping strategies may enable policymakers to develop more effective policies and manage the problems 
of older adults in post-COVID situations.

Background
The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  become  a  global  public 
health crisis that has resulted in many challenges for the 
world.  According  to  healthcare  statistics,  this  virus  has 
caused  more  than  645  million  positive  infections  and 
more than 6.6 million deaths worldwide since the begin-
ning of this epidemic [1, 2].

The psychological effects of high mortality and restric-
tive  measures following  the pandemic  have  changed the 
lifestyles of millions of people and created a unique com-
bination of a living environment with unpredictable and 
stressful aspects, causing long-term, direct, and indirect 
effects  on  people’s  physical  and  mental  health  [3].  The 
results  of  an  extensive  survey  show  that  the  stress  level 
worldwide peaked during the COVID-19 crisis [4].

The  COVID-19  pandemic 

is  a  potential  source 
of  increasing  stress  in  older  adults  [5].  Coronavirus 
increases the risk of death in infected older adults. Addi-
tionally,  older  adults  with  underlying  health  problems, 
such as high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabe-
tes,  are  at  greater  risk  of  contracting  more  severe  types 
of COVID-19 and have been quarantined since the out-
break  [6,  7].  Due  to  smaller  social  networks  and  less 
social support, the pandemic increased the risk of mental 
health problems among older adults more than other age 
groups [8].

A  pandemic  can  cause  various  problems  for  the  older 
adult,  including  much  isolation,  decreased  contact  with 
loved ones and the outside world, fewer opportunities to 
engage  in  favorite  activities,  and  possibly  elevated  anxi-
ety  and  fear  of  death.  [9].  Financial  stress,  limited  inter-
actions  with  society,  the  loss  of  loved  ones,  exposure  to 
negative  media  coverage,  uncertainty  about  the  future, 
and being discriminated against make older adults expe-
rience a high level of stress [9]. Other aspects of this pan-
demic, such as its unpredictability, have contributed to its 
stress and adversely impacted the mental health of older 
adults  [10].  The  reaction  to  an  uncertain  event  depends 
on how a person evaluates and copes with the threat [11]. 
There are different ways that older people can deal with 
the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic [12].

Coping  strategies  are  cognitive  and  behavioral  efforts 
to  explain,  interpret,  and  modify  a  stressful  situation  to 
avoid  or  reduce  suffering.  Coping  includes  activities  to 
reduce  or  endure  psychological  pressure  [13].  A  per-
son’s  strategies  to  cope  with  a  stressful  source  such  as 
COVID-19  are  part  of  their  vulnerability  profile.  Using 
an  inappropriate  strategy  in  facing  stressful  situations 
can  increase  stress  while  using  correct  coping  strategies 
can have positive results [14, 15]. Stress assessment pat-
terns and coping strategies among older adults may differ 

quantitatively  (i.e.,  different  means)  as  well  as  qualita-
tively (i.e., stress assessment patterns) [16]. A qualitative 
study with qualitative data is the best method for describ-
ing human experiences during pandemics [17].

Qualitative  studies  can  effectively  prevent  secondary 
stressors  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  by  highlighting 
people’s  voices  and  clarifying  their  needs  [18].  The  sys-
tematic  review  of  qualitative  studies  is  a  relatively  new 
method  in  the  systematic  review  of  studies  [19].  Sys-
tematic  reviews  of  qualitative  studies  that  analyze  and 
categorize  first-hand  experiences  of  older  adults  living 
in  the  community  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  can  pro-
vide  a  richer  conceptual  understanding  of  these  experi-
ences,  and  qualitative  systematic  reviews  are  capable  of 
providing  insights  for  healthcare  professionals  on  topics 
and concerns which cannot be addressed solely through 
quantitative  research.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the 
lives  of  older  adults  and  their  coping  strategies  may  be 
better  shown  by  studying  the  memories  of  seniors  who 
engaged  in  numerous  social  and  recreational  opportu-
nities outside of their homes before the quarantine. The 
results  of  this  study  can  be  used  to  plan  for  specialized 
services  for  older  adults  in  the  post-COVID  era,  as  well 
as  potential  future  pandemics.  Therefore,  the  present 
study  was  to  synthesize  qualitative  evidence  regarding 
coping  strategies  for  stressful  situations  among  older 
adults throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
This  study  used  the  search  strategy,  screening,  and  data 
election based on PRISMA guide criteria [20]. The proto-
col of this systematic review was registered on the PROS-
PERO  website  to  prevent  duplicate  work  (registration 
code: CRD42022364831).

Search strategy

The  first  author  and  an  experienced  academic  librarian 
searched  articles.  Mesh  keywords  were  used  to  search 
for  related  articles,  and  the  keywords  “coping  strategy”, 
“coping  strategies”,  “older  adults”,  “elderly”,  “aging”,  “age-
ing”,  “COVID-19”,  “COVID-19  pandemic”,  and  “stress” 
were used. Scopus, Embase, Medline (via PubMed), Pro-
Quest,  The  Cochrane  Library,  and  Google  Scholar  were 
checked  to  find  related  English  articles. This  search  was 
completed by checking the references of related articles.

Study selection criteria

The study selection criteria included the following:

1.  The study was conducted among older adults (60 
years of age and older) living in the community.

Ahmadi et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:333 Page 3 of 12

2.  The study was conducted with a qualitative or 

mixed methodology with an identifiable qualitative 
component.

3.  The study looked into the coping strategies of older 
adults dealing with the stress caused by the COVID-
19 pandemic.

4.  The abstract and text of the study should be available 

in English.

We  use  the  PRISMA  flow  diagram  to  show  our  search 
results  and  the  process  of  screening  and  selecting  stud-
ies  for  inclusion  (see  Fig.  1).  The  identified  articles 
were  entered  into  EndNote  20.  Duplicate  articles  were 
removed, and the remaining articles’ titles, abstracts, and 
full texts were screened to obtain the final list.

Data extraction

Three  researchers  (A.A.,  H.M.,  and  F.A.)  independently 
performed  the  data  extraction  process  using  a  pre-
designed  table  based  on  the  key  features  of  the  articles. 
The  extracted  information  included  the  general  charac-
teristics of the study (name of the first author and year of 
publication, study location, sample size, age range of the 
study participants, data collection tool, and study date).

Risk of bias

The  quality  of  the  selected  articles  was  assessed  using 
the Joanna Briggs Institute for Qualitative Research (JBI) 
Critical  Appraisal  Checklist.  This  tool  helps  researchers 
assess  a  study’s  relevance,  reliability,  and  methodologi-
cal  quality  and  ensures  that  the  methodology,  analysis, 
and  interpretations  are  complementary. The  JBI  tool  for 
evaluating qualitative studies has ten items [21]. Content 
points  were  scored  as  yes  (2),  no  (0),  and  unclear  (1).  A 
decision  was  made  to  rank  articles  meeting  70–79%  of 
checklist criteria as medium-high quality. Articles meet-
ing  80–89%  were  identified  as  high  quality,  and  those 
with  a  score  of  90%  and  above  were  ranked  as  superior 
[22]. Two research team members (A.A. and H.M.) inde-
pendently  evaluated  the  methodological  quality  of  the 
selected studies using the 10-item JBI checklist. Disagree-
ments are resolved by consensus with all team members.

Data synthesis

All  study  data  were  entered  verbatim  for  qualitative 
synthesis  in  MAXQDA  2020.  The  process  of  combin-
ing themes was inductive. One of the researchers (A.A.) 
did  preliminary  coding  using  line-by-line  coding  to  find 
related ideas and subtopics concerning the stress induced 
by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  coping  techniques  for 
older  adults  were  created  based  on  this  data.  Then  two 
researchers  (H.M.  and  A.A.)  independently  coded  the 
selected studies using this guide, and this work continued 
until no other sub-themes emerged. If there was a differ-
ence  between  the  two  researchers,  the  third  researcher 
(H.A.  or  F.A.)  discussed  and  judged  it,  and  a  consensus 
was formed.

Findings
In the electronic database search, 565 studies were iden-
tified  for  screening.  We  also  identified  16  other  studies 
through a manual search in the references of the articles. 
The PRISMA flow chart is shown in Fig. 1. After remov-
ing  duplicate  articles  and  also  checking  the  title  and 
abstract  of  the  articles,  the  full  text  of  57  studies  was 
selected  for  further  review,  of  which  44  studies  did  not 
meet  the  age  criteria  (n = 17),  the  methodological  crite-
ria (n = 14), the information requirements (n = 8), and the 
consistency of the study environment (n = 5). The remain-
ing  13  articles  that  met  all  the  inclusion  criteria  were 

included in the study [15, 18, 23–33]. Table 1 presents the 
characteristics  of  the  selected  articles.  The  largest  num-
ber of articles (4 articles) were done in the USA [15, 23, 
27, and 29], and other articles were conducted in Canada 
(two  articles),  Iran,  England,  India,  Sweden,  Uganda, 
and the Netherlands. Most studies used semi-structured 
telephone  interviews  to  collect  data  [15,  18,  24,  26–30]. 
Except  for  one  study,  which  did  not  specify  when  data 
were  collected  [31],  all  selected  studies  were  conducted 
within  months  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  announce-
ment (see Fig. 2).

The JBI checklist was used to assess the quality of the 
articles.  The  JBI  tool  for  evaluating  qualitative  studies 
has ten items. According to the JBI checklist, the selected 
studies’ quality was optimal. Most of the selected articles 
were of superior quality, and most of the necessary items 
in qualitative research were addressed (Table 2). Most of 
the  articles  in  Item  6  of  the  checklist,  which  was  about 
locating  the  researcher  culturally  or  theoretically,  did 
not provide information [15, 18, 23, 26, 28, 31–33]. Also, 
most  articles  did  not  address  the  researcher’s  influence 
on the research and vice versa (Table 2).

Based  on  the  extraction  and  combination  of  data, 
the  challenges,  and  stressful  experiences  caused  by  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  were  classified  into  six  themes: 
health  management  challenges,  physical  and  social  dis-
tancing challenges, economic challenges, media and bad 
news  challenges,  direct  threats  of  the  COVID-19  virus, 
and challenges related to the use of new communication 
technologies (Table 3).

Older people used five main types of strategies to deal 
with the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: pro-
tective strategies, avoidance strategies, maintaining social 
connections,  meaning-based  strategies,  and  fun  strate-
gies (Table 4).

Discussion
In  this  study,  13  qualitative  studies  were  systematically 
reviewed to identify the stress caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic  and  the  coping  strategies  of  older  adults.  The 
study’s  findings  showed  that  older  adults  faced  various 
challenges and stresses during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which were classified into six groups. To cope with these 
stresses,  older  adults  have  used  a  wide  range  of  coping 
strategies,  which  have  been  classified  into  five  groups 
in  this  study:  protective  strategies,  avoidance  strategies, 
maintaining  social  connections,  meaning-based  strate-
gies, and fun strategies.

Extended quarantine during a pandemic is considered 
stressful,  and  the  expected  outcomes  include  increased 
levels  of  depression  and  anxiety,  increased  social  isola-
tion,  and  increased  feelings  of  loneliness  [34].  Accord-
ing  to  the  findings  of  Brenda  et  al.,  the  most  common 
stressors reported by older adults during the COVID-19

pandemic  were  quarantine  and  restrictions,  concern  for 
others, and loneliness [35]. In this study, we categorized 
the  challenges  caused  by  the  pandemic  into  six  groups: 
health  management,  quarantine,  economics,  media  and 
bad news, direct virus threats, and communication tech-
nologies. According to Ellison et al.’s research, eight areas 
of  social  relations,  activity  limitations,  psychological, 
health,  financial,  global  environment,  death,  and  care  at 
home have been identified as difficult challenges caused 
by this pandemic. Social interaction limitations (42.4% of 
participants)  and  activity  restrictions  (30.9%  of  partici-
pants) have been the most common problems caused by 

the COVID-19 pandemic [36]. Radwan et al. also classi-
fied the major challenges affecting older adults during the 
COVID-19 outbreak into five categories: misinformation, 
health issues, limited access to nutritional needs, and vio-
lence against older adults [37].

Coping  strategies  are  behavioral  and  cognitive  strate-
gies for dealing with stressful situations and crises. There 
are  different  classifications  for  coping  strategies  [38]. 
Coping strategies were classified by Robert Folkman and 
Susan  Lazarus  as  either  problem-oriented  or  emotion-
oriented [39]. Depending on the situation and conditions, 
older adults can employ various strategies to mitigate the

effects  of  a  stressful  situation.  Verhage  et  al.  found  that 
older  adults  mainly  used  emotion-based  coping  strate-
gies  may  be  caused  by  the  incomprehensible  nature  of 
the  COVID-19  crisis  [18].  Each  of  the  coping  strategies 
in  place  can  be  effective  in  maintaining  and  improving 
people’s mental health. Coping strategies are not just an 
interaction  between  the  person  and  the  situation  but  a 
dynamic  process  in  which  dimensions  such  as  duration, 
timing, and order of stressful factors may play an impor-
tant role [39].

Protective  strategies  are  active  efforts  to  manage  and 
solve  problems  caused  by  a  stressful  factor  [36].  Protec-
tive strategies can also be classified as problem-oriented 
strategies. The problem-oriented coping strategy includes 
the  person’s  constructive  actions  in  stressful  condi-
tions  and  tries  to  remove  or  change  the  source  of  stress 
[39].  According  to  studies,  problem-oriented  strategies 
improve psychological well-being and quality of life [40]. 
With  COVID-19  as  a  stressful  factor,  preventive  strate-
gies  include  hand  washing,  mask-wearing,  and  social 
distancing  that  people  can  use  directly  and  actively  to 
prevent  the  virus’s  spread  and  protect  themselves  [16]. 
Most studies showed that older people used these strat-
egies  to  reduce  their  virus  exposure  and  susceptibil-
ity.  According  to  surveys,  most  older  adults  know  the 
COVID-19  preventative  protocols.  They  adopt  protec-
tive  strategies  and  preventive  measures,  including  using 
masks and hand disinfectants and changing clothes when 
entering the house [33, 41].

Stress  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  also 
affects  physical  health.  Staying  healthy  and  maintaining 
physical  mobility  during  the  COVID-19  outbreak  and 
implementing  quarantine  and  social  isolation  are  nec-
essary  for  older  persons  [42].  Physical  activity  at  home 
improves the immune system’s response and reduces sus-
ceptibility to the virus. The findings of this study demon-
strated that exercising at home was one of the strategies 
adopted by older people to cope with a reduced level of 
physical activity. The most popular strategies utilized by 
older  people  in  quarantine  to  enhance  physical  activity 
were  backyard  gardening  projects  [26,  28,  29],  walking 
[23, 26, 29, 32], and using virtual sports classes or watch-
ing sports videos [23, 29].

When individuals experience unpredictable conditions, 
such  as  natural  disasters,  meaning-focused  coping  can 
help them adjust [43]. This strategy attempted to improve 
an individual’s evaluation of a situation and make beliefs, 
goals,  and  stressful  events  more  consistent  so  that  indi-
viduals can cope with stressful conditions [44]. Meaning-
oriented  strategies  include  attitudes  and  behaviors  that 
help  people  positively  reinterpret  hardship,  preserve 
hope,  appreciate  life,  and  engage  in  meaningful  activi-
ties  [45]. This  strategy  aimed  to  find  a  positive  meaning 
in  a  negative  experience.  Coping  strategies  grounded 
in  meaning  are  generally  based  on  older  adults’  lifetime 
experiences [46]. This group of coping strategies is some-
times classified as emotion-oriented [18]. In this study, a 
wide range of coping strategies used by older adults were

classified as meaning-oriented. Gratitude [23, 26, 29, 32], 
finding joy in small things [23, 25, 28, 32], being optimis-
tic about the future and hoping to return to normal life, 
and  planning  for  enjoyable  activities  in  the  future  were 
among  the  most  popular  strategies  used  by  older  adults 
(see  Table  4).  Nikolett  et  al.  found  that  meaning-based 
coping  is  substantially  associated  with  the  reduction 
of  stress,  anxiety,  and  depression  symptoms  during  the 
COVID-19 epidemic [45].

To  avoid  contracting  COVID-19,  older  adults  stayed 
at  home  and  decreased  their  face-to-face  social  partici-
pation.  However,  many  older  adults  reported  continu-
ing  social  communication  virtually,  such  as  through 
phone  calls.  In  this  study,  the  challenges  of  using  com-
munication  technologies  were  categorized  as  one  of 
the  important  challenges  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic 
era.  Technological  issues  such  as  poor  or  incompatible 
Internet  connections,  sensory  problems  (such  as  poor 
hearing), and discomfort caused by long-time use of com-
puters  (such  as  headaches  and  visual  discomfort)  were 
among  the  problems  and  challenges  facing  older  adults 
when  using  communication  technologies  [26].  Accord-
ing  to  participants  in  the  Greenwood-Hickman  study, 
while virtual media helps individuals stay connected with 
friends and family, it is not always as satisfying as face-to-
face  engagement.  However,  virtual  communication  was 
easier for some people than face-to-face meetings [29]. In 

the study by Fiocco et al., despite some initial resistance 
and  challenges  experienced  by  some  participants,  older 
adults  gradually  realized  the  necessity  of  technology  to 
connect  with  their  social  network  during  the  pandemic 
and  also  pointed  out  the  benefits  of  this  technology  in 
work affairs, online worship, and online learning. Regard-
ing  these  technologies,  some  participants  acknowledged 
that  learning  to  use  some  communication  tools  may  be 
difficult for them. The government should provide social 
assistance to support the use of technology for this class 
of  society  [28].  Communication  technologies  can  sig-
nificantly  help  older  adults  and  their  caregivers  during 
pandemics.  The  “digital  divide”  and  limited  access  to 
technologies  among  older  adults  deserve  consideration 
to reduce such problems in future pandemics [47].

The news on disease-related deaths is one of the main 
challenges facing older adults during the COVID-19 pan-
demic. COVID-19 was described as an age-related condi-
tion  that  caused  worry  in  older  people.  Although  many 
older adults used the media to learn about the spread of 
the  coronavirus  and  recommended  safety  measures  at 
the beginning of the outbreak, they reported the negative 
impacts  of  disease-related  death  news  on  their  mental 
health  [28].  Losada-Baltar  et  al.  found  that  older  adults, 
who  are  more  exposed  to  news  on  COVID-19,  experi-
ence  higher  psychological  distress  [48].  The  results  of 
our  review  showed  that  older  adults  have  used  different

Table 4  Older adults’ stress-coping strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
Coping type
Protective strategies

Examples of actions taken
Actions to prevent the spread of virus:
Social distancing, reduction of social interactions, and adherence to COVID-19 prevention protocols [18, 23–30, 33]
Shopping during “senior hours”, reducing shopping trips or using home delivery services [27, 29, 30]
Using the recommended personal protective equipment, such as goggles or a hat [26]
Avoiding unnecessary purchases and minimizing the frequency of food purchases [26]
Limiting outdoor meeting with family or friends [26, 30]
Increased consumption of canned and frozen foods (strategic and creative meals) [23, 26]
Using online counseling and health services [25]
Participation in online religious groups [29]
Actions to reduce sensitivity to the virus:
Practicing health-promotion behaviors such as healthy eating, exercise, vaccination, and taking supplements to 
strengthen the immune system [23, 24, 26–29]
Using virtual sports classes or sports videos [23, 29]
Using herbal and home remedies to strengthen the immune system [26]
Reducing the use of news, filtering negative news related to COVID-19, and selective listening to news [18, 26–28]
distraction [18, 26, 28]
Avoiding some activities, such as riding a bicycle or cutting firewood to prevent the possibility of injuries and 
medical attention [26]
Avoiding crowded areas and places where prevention guidelines are not followed [29]
Eating out less frequently [29]
More intimacy with spouse and talking with family members [24]
Maintaining high-quality relationships with family, friends, and neighbors [15, 28, 33]
Taking online courses and adapting to new technologies to keep in touch with loved ones [15, 24, 32, 33]
Sending emails, handwritten letters, and joining and using virtual social networks [29, 32]
Belief in God, acceptance of fate, and faith in destiny [24]
Practicing spiritual methods, keeping a positive attitude, and gaining perspective from past struggles [15, 29, 30]
Appreciation for current assets [23, 26, 29, 32]
Viewing quarantine as a temporary situation [18, 26]
Finding happiness in small things [23, 25, 28, 32]
Being optimistic about the future, hoping to return to normal life, and having plans for enjoyable activities in the 
future [25, 26, 33]
Helping others, doing voluntary work, and feeling purposeful [23]
Finding a new meaning or purpose in life [24]
Replacing creative activities at home with outdoor activities [27, 30, 32]
Doing fun activities during the day (watching TV, reading books, gardening, listening to music, cleaning the 
house) [15, 23, 29, 32, 33]
Practicing yoga and meditation at home [23, 26, 27]
Joining online social networks [29, 32, 33]

strategies  to  cope  with  this  issue.  Reducing  the  time 
spent  listening  to  the  news,  filtering  negative  news  on 
COVID-19, and selectively listening to the news has been 
the  most  important  strategies  for  older  adults  to  cope 
with this situation. (See also Table 3)

Recreation  and  hobbies  are  the  main  components 
of  a  healthy  life  for  older  adults  [49].  With  the  spread 
of  COVID-19,  most  recreational  facilities  for  older 
adults,  such  as  indoor  sports  facilities,  parks,  and  cul-
tural  places,  were  closed.  Most  group  activities,  such  as 
voluntary  activities  and  clubs,  were  also  implemented 
with  severe  restrictions  [50].  Our  study  showed  that 
older adults entertain themselves in different ways, such 
as  watching  TV,  reading  books,  gardening,  listening  to 
music, cleaning the house, and joining online social net-
works  (see  Table  4).  Kim  et  al.‘s  study  showed  that  dur-
ing  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  participation  rate  of 
older  Korean  adults  in  entertainment  and  sports  activi-
ties  has  increased.  In  contrast,  their  participation  rate 

in  cultural,  tourism,  and  social  activities  has  decreased. 
Studies  showed  that  the  proportion  of  older  adults  who 
spend their leisure time on active and social activities has 
decreased, and the ratio of older adults who spend their 
leisure time on passive activities has increased [50].

Most studies collect data through telephone interviews 
(see Table 1). Although telephone interview can deprive 
the researcher of establishing non-verbal communication 
with respondents [51], it is the best method of collecting 
information  in  situations  such  as  pandemics  and  infec-
tious  diseases,  which  can  ensure  the  safety  of  people  by 
preventing the transmission of diseases. Telephone inter-
views also increase the feeling of anonymity in some sen-
sitive subjects, calm them down, and reduce the effects of 
the interviewer’s presence [52].

Limitations

In  this  review,  studies  of  older  adults  living  in  different 
geographic regions were analyzed, including Europe [18, 

Ahmadi et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:333 25,  30],  Asia  [24,  32],  the  United  States  [15,  23,  27,  29], 
and  Africa  [31].  The  findings  should  be  interpreted  in 
light of the studies’ diverse sociocultural contexts. Future 
studies could examine participants exclusively from simi-
lar geographic regions to avoid issues of geographic het-
erogeneity. Knowing about the coping strategies of older 
adults  during  the  pandemic  can  be  useful  for  activists 
in  the  field  of  older  adults’  health.  The  findings  of  this 
research  outlined  the  stress  experienced  by  older  adults 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their coping 
strategies, which may be used in the formation of policies 
on elderly health promotion in the post-COVID era.

Conclusion
Older  adults  are  experiencing  a  lot  of  stress  and  chal-
lenges  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Depending  on 
the situation and conditions, older adults can use a vari-
ety of strategies to reduce the effects of the stressful situ-
ation of COVID-19. In most cases, older adults deal with 
these  challenges  using  simple  strategies  based  on  previ-
ous  experiences  and  learnings,  that  do  not  necessitate 
a  large  budget  or  many  resources.  Training  in  effective 
coping strategies in middle age can prepare them for old 
age  and  guarantee  their  psychological  security  to  some 
extent. In some cases, such as the use of communication 
technologies,  older  adults  require  educational  interven-
tions. The supervision and cooperation of health profes-
sionals in producing media content during the outbreak 
of  the  pandemic  can  effectively  reduce  stress  on  older 
adults  and  prevent  problems  such  as  ageism.  Experts  in 
geriatrics  can  use  this  research’s  findings  in  designing 
their  clinical  interventions  to  familiarize  middle-aged 
and  older  adults  with  efficient  coping  strategies  and 
strengthen social support in the post-COVID era.
