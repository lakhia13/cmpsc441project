Background: Common mental disorders (CMDs), multimorbidity, and refugee
status are associated with poor labor market outcome. Little is known about how
these factors interact in young adults.

Objective: We aimed to i) investigate whether the association of CMDs and
multimorbidity with labor market marginalization (LMM) differs between refugee
and Swedish-born young adults and ii) identify diagnostic groups with particularly
high risk for LMM.

Methods: This longitudinal registry-based study included individuals aged 20–
25 years followed from 2012 to 2016 in Sweden (41,516 refugees and 207,729 age
and sex-matched Swedish-born individuals). LMM was deﬁned as granted disability
pension (DP) or > 180 days of unemployment (UE). A disease co-occurrence
network was constructed for all diagnostic groups from 2009 to 2011 to derive
a personalized multimorbidity score for LMM. Multivariate logistic regression was
used to estimate odds ratios of LMM in refugee and Swedish-born youth as a
function of their multimorbidity score. The relative risk (RR, 95% CI) of LMM for
refugees with CMDs compared to Swedish-born with CMDs was computed in
each diagnostic group.

Results:
In total, 5.5% of refugees and 7.2% of Swedish-born with CMDs
were granted DP; 22.2 and 9.4%, respectively received UE beneﬁt during
follow-up. While both CMDs and multimorbidity independently elevated the
risk of DP considerably in Swedish-born, CMDs but not multimorbidity
elevated the risk of UE. Regarding UE in refugees, multimorbidity with the
presence of CMDs showed stronger estimates. Multimorbidity interacted with
refugee status toward UE (p < 0.0001) and with CMDs toward DP (p =
0.0049). Two diagnostic groups that demonstrated particularly high RR of
UE were schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (RR [95% CI]:
3.46 [1.77, 6.75]), and behavioral syndromes (RR [95% CI]: 3.41 [1.90, 6.10]).

Conclusion: To combat LMM, public health measures and intervention strategies
need to be tailored to young adults based on their CMDs, multimorbidity, and
refugee status.

Introduction

Young adults in Europe are at increased risk of experiencing
labor market marginalization (LMM) (1, 2). While there are
various deﬁnitions of LMM, here we adopt the deﬁnition of
long-term unemployment (UE) and disability pension (DP) (3).
Health-related aspects can be better captured by this deﬁnition
as the decision on granting a DP requires medical assessments.
Within young individuals with LMM, substantial disparity between
migrants, particularly refugees and native-born have been reported
in numerous studies (4–7). Exposure to trauma and adversities,
uncertainties of settlement and post-migration living diﬃculties
make young refugees particularly vulnerable and more susceptible
to adverse health outcomes and poor social integration when
compared to their native-born peers (4, 8, 9). As in many European
countries, and also worldwide, the population of refugees increased
in recent decades (8, 10), understanding the relation between health
status and LMM among young refugees is of critical importance.
This may help to implement strategies to promote inclusion and
participation of refugee youth in the labor market, reduce social
disadvantage within refugee populations and potentially improve
economic stability of these countries.

Common mental disorders (CMDs), i.e., depression, anxiety,
and stress-related disorders (11), are a leading cause of disability
in young adults. These mental disorders contribute considerably
to functional health loss in all ages worldwide and correlate with
increased risk of LMM next to the need of welfare support in later
life (11–13). CMDs are particularly prevalent in refugees, which
may be related to trauma exposure, post-migration conditions,
and social exclusion (14). The negative impact of the migration
experience are long-lasting (15). Low socioeconomic status and
educational attainment heighten diﬃculties of
labor market
engagement among young refugees with CMDs (3, 4, 8). Prior
studies revealed a higher risk of LMM among young refugees than
native-born with CMDs within a large-scale registry-based cohort
in Sweden (4, 5).

Previous studies reported that CMDs were associated with
increased multimorbidity, deﬁned as the coexistence of two or more
conditions in an individual within a given timespan (16–20). The
increased burden of multimorbidity has become a public concern,
in particular among individuals with lower socioeconomic status or
social deprivation (21). Many studies on assessing multimorbidity
relied on questionnaires and focused on older adult populations
(22). Despite the risk of multimorbidity being highly correlated
with age, multimorbidity also has a signiﬁcant impact on the
social development of young adults and risk of LMM (16, 22).

While both CMDs and multimorbidity have been found to elevate
the risk of LMM in youths (3, 13, 22–24). There is a social
gradient in the association of CMDs with higher morbidities (16).
Yet, whether the relationship between comorbid mental/somatic
disorders and LMM diﬀers by refugee status has received little
interest in the literature to date, let alone how these factors interact
with each other.

Instruments used to evaluate disease co-occurrences are
heterogeneous and often measured by counting the total number
of pre-determined chronic conditions (18, 25). In this study, we
utilized a disease network approach to quantify multimorbidity
in individuals. Disease networks consist of nodes that represent
individual diseases and links indicating a statistical tendency for
two diseases to co-occur in patients (26). A strength of the
network approach is that all diagnoses across the entire spectrum
are accounted for within a single framework without having to
make assumptions about possible underlying common causes. We
hypothesized that CMDs and multimorbidity, conceptualized by
indicators derived from disease networks, would correlate with
LMM diﬀerently in refugees and Swedish-born youths. A better
understanding of these concerted interactions might inform about
eﬀective social and community support to prevent or reduce LMM
in refugees, and policies facilitating access to work for refugees.
In the current study, we aimed i) to evaluate the association of
multimorbidity, CMD, and refugee status with subsequent LMM
and ii) to identify diagnostic groups with an elevated risk of LMM
in refugee and Swedish-born young adults with CMDs.

Methods

A longitudinal cohort study was carried out using information
from combined Swedish registers. A total of 256,326 young adults
aged between 20 and 25 years at baseline (December 31, 2011)
and living in Sweden from January 01, 2009 to December 31,
2011, were identiﬁed in the Total Population Register. Refugees
were 1:5 matched with Swedish-born based on age, sex, and
area of residence (i.e., big cities, medium cities, or rural area).
Refugees were identiﬁed based on reasons for settlement in Sweden.
These individuals received a residence permit in Sweden due to
one of the following reasons: refugee status as deﬁned by the
Geneva Convention of Refugees, on “humanitarian grounds,” “in
need of protection,” or “family reuniﬁcation” (27). The matched
comparison group consisted of Swedish-born counterparts with
both parents being native-born Swedes. We excluded individuals
with ongoing DP at baseline (n = 5,658) and individuals who were

not living in Sweden at baseline (n = 1,423). In the end, the study
population consisted of a total of 249,245 young adults with 41,516
refugees and 207,729 Swedish-born counterparts. To evaluate the
association of CMDs, multimorbidity, and LMM risk, these 249,245
individuals were followed in terms of DP and UE from January
01, 2012 until December 31, 2016. The diagnostic criteria and the
eligibility of DP remained the same throughout the study period
from January 01, 2009 to December 31, 2016. Ethical approval for
this study was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board,
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm (nr 2007/762-31).

Measure of labor market marginalization
(LMM)

The measure of LMM was based on information on granted DP
(regardless of grade) and UE collected during the follow-up period
from January 01, 2012 to December 31, 2016. UE was recorded
and administered by the Swedish Public Employment Service
and registered in LISA. Cases of UE were deﬁned as individuals
who were registered as unemployed for more than 180 days in a
calendar year.

Data sources

Covariates

The Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance
and Labor Market Studies (LISA) contains information regarding
sociodemographic, employment, and social beneﬁts since 1990.
Migration and refugee status, including dates and reasons for
migrations, were obtained from the longitudinal database for
integration studies (STATIV). The National Patient Register (NPR)
contains the primary and secondary diagnostic information in both
inpatient and specialized outpatient care settings since 1987 and
2001, respectively. Disease prevalence was deﬁned according to
the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases Tenth Edition (ICD-
10) in the NPR registers. Mortality data was collected from the
Cause of Death Register. Date and duration of sickness absences
and DP were collected from Microdata for Analysis of Social
Security (MIDAS), with the earliest available DP information since
1994. Prescribed medication information was obtained from the
Prescribed Drug Register. The quality of the register data has been
validated by prior studies (28).

Measure of common mental disorders
(CMDs)

CMDs were classiﬁed by the International Classiﬁcation
of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes F32–F33 and F40–F43,
indicating depressive episodes, recurrent depressive disorder,
phobic anxiety disorder, other anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, reaction to severe stress, and adjustment
disorders, from inpatient or specialized outpatient records, or any
prescribed antidepressant medication according to the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classiﬁcation (ATC code N06A)
from 2009 to 2011 (3).

Assessment of multimorbidity

A phenotypic disease network approach to obtain a
multimorbidity score was performed based on disease prevalence
between January 01, 2009 and December 31, 2011 in the
NPR. Primary and secondary diagnoses were classiﬁed by
114 ICD-10 diagnostic groups as deﬁned by the WHO; see
Supplementary Table 1 (29). For each pair of diagnostic groups,
their tendency to co-occur was statistically assessed (30).

cohabitant without children, married or cohabitant with children,
single without children living at home, single with children living at
home, and youth younger than the age of 20 years living at home.
Education levels were classiﬁed by “0–9 years,” “10–12 years,”
“> 12 years” or unknown. Area of residence indicated whether
individuals resided in big cities, medium-sized cities, or rural
areas. Big cities referred to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö;
medium-sized cities were deﬁned as cities with more than 90,000
residents within 30 kilometers from the city center; rural area
indicated all the remaining cities or villages in Sweden. History of
spells of sickness absence of > 90 net days and UE during January
01, 2009 and December 31, 2011 were obtained from the registers
described above.

Statistical analysis and multimorbidity score

A multimorbidity network analysis of

the entire cohort
based on ICD-10 diagnostic groups observed between January
01, 2009 and December 31, 2011 was performed to derive
personal multimorbidity scores. The constructed multimorbidity
network consisted of nodes and links, indicating ICD-10 diagnostic
groups (nodes) and their statistical tendency to co-occur with
other diseases as measured by the logarithmic odds ratio for
each pair of diagnostic groups (link strength), respectively. Only
diagnostic groups that have been diagnosed in at
least 100
individuals and pairs of diagnostic groups that have occurred
at least 40 times were kept for the network. Disparity ﬁlter, an
algorithm for ﬁltering non-signiﬁcant associations by node-speciﬁc
threshold values, was applied to address multiple testing and
to mitigate the inﬂuence of statistical biases regarding the link
strengths. A detailed description of the method has been previously
given (31).

The multimorbidity score was computed from the network for
each individual as the weighted average of the LMM risk (measured
at baseline) in the disease network neighborhood of that individual;
see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 1. The set
of diagnoses that are statistically signiﬁcant of at least one of
the given individual’s diagnoses at baseline is referred to as the

the number of individuals with diagnoses in that diagnostic group, and colors giving the relative risk (RRs) for unemployment of refugee vs. the
Swedish-born with common mental disorders (CMDs), respectively. Links between diagnostic groups indicate the tendency of co-occurrence in the
same individual. The colors range from green to purple, corresponding to RRs from low to high. A node colored in green (purple) suggests that
refugees with CMDs in that diagnostic group have a lower (higher) risk for long-term unemployment, compared to the Swedish-born counterparts.
Overall, refugees with CMDs showed a higher risk for unemployment in the majority of diagnostic groups.

network neighborhood. The LMM risk in a given diagnostic group
was computed as the frequency of LMM in all patients with this
diagnosis at baseline. The multimorbidity score was computed as
the weighted sum of these LMM risks with weights proportional to
the link strength.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the
association of multimorbidity score and LMM in refugees with
or without CMDs and Swedish-born with or without CMDs.
In addition to the matching variables (age, sex, and area of
residence), education, history of sickness absence, and history
of UE were included in the multivariate logistic regression. The
multimorbidity score was classiﬁed into three categories: “zero,”
“low,” and “high,” according to the median of the non-zero scores.
Individuals in the “zero” category were either a) healthy individuals
with no prevalent diagnosis in the specialized health care system
or b) individuals with rare diseases or diagnoses that had no
signiﬁcant association with other diagnostic groups in the network.
A multimorbidity score below or above the median of all non-zero
scores corresponded to categories “low” and “high,” respectively. A
composite variable was created by combining the information for

refugee and CMD status across strata for multimorbidity scores
as the exposure of the multivariate logistic regression. Swedish-
born without CMDs in the multimorbidity category “zero” of the
multimorbidity score was deﬁned as the reference group. The
interaction of refugee status, CMDs, and multimorbidity score was
evaluated by ANOVA.

In addition, we identiﬁed the outcome diﬀerence between
refugees and Swedish-born with CMDs in each diagnostic group by
calculating the relative risk and 95% Conﬁdence Intervals of LMM
of young refugees with CMDs in each diagnostic group, compared
to matched Swedish-born with CMDs. These relative risks were
visualized by the color of nodes (diagnostic groups, ranging from
green to purple) in the multimorbidity network (Figure 1). We
further assessed the diﬀerence of relative risk between refugees and
Swedish-born with CMDs using a Chi-squared test. Analyses of
speciﬁc diagnoses with elevated risk of subsequent DP were not
carried out due to the low number of cases among refugees with
DP. All analyses were performed using R 3.6.2 and SAS 9.4, and an
alpha value of <0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant in the
disparity ﬁlter.

Results

Table 1 presents

the baseline characteristics of 249,245
individuals with a mean age (SD) of 23 (1.7) years, according to
refugee status and CMDs. There were 20,680 (8.3%) diagnosed with
CMDs. In the follow-up period 2,841 (1.1%) cases of DP and 16,323
(6.5%) cases of UE occurred. We observed a higher frequency of
females than males among both the refugees and the Swedish-born
with CMDs. We found a higher percentage of low educational level
among the refugees than the Swedish-born, both for the refugees
and the Swedish-born with CMDs (36.0 vs. 23.8%, respectively, p
< 0.001), as well as for the refugees and the Swedish-born without
CMDs (21.0 vs. 7.3%, respectively, p < 0.001). These ﬁndings were
consistent with previous studies using the similar cohort (4, 7).
Individuals with CMDs showed a higher proportion of previous
sickness absences and previous UE compared with individuals
without CMDs, respectively. Swedish-born individuals with CMDs
showed the highest percentage of previous sickness absence (8.8%).
Refugees with CMDs had the highest percentage of previous UE
(12.2%) among the four groups.

Table 2 shows the association of multimorbidity categories
with the risk of subsequent DP among refugees with or without

CMDs and Swedish-born with or without CMDs. The standardized
median (range) multimorbidity scores were 0.20 (−0.48, 15.0)
and 0.48 (−0.61, 17.7) in DP and UE, respectively. Relative
to the reference group (Swedish-born without CMDs in the
multimorbidity category “zero”), Swedish-born had higher odds
of being granted DP than refugees across all CMDs and
multimorbidity categories. CMDs and multimorbidity elevated the
risk of DP considerably in Swedish-born with the highest OR
[95%CI] being 13.8 [12.32, 15.59]. We were unable to estimate the
OR of DP among refugees with CMDs due to low case numbers
in the multimorbidity categories “zero” and “low.” The odds of
UE remained higher in refugees across all three multimorbidity
categories, compared to the Swedish-born. CMDs showed a
tendency toward stronger risk than high multimorbidity for UE in
Swedish-born, (OR [95% CI] 2.10 [1.95, 2.26] vs. 1.87 [1.63, 2.15],
“high” vs. “zero” multimorbidity) whereas multimorbidity showed
higher risk than CMDs toward UE in refugees. The pseudo-R2
values of the underlying multivariate regression models for DP and
UE were 0.18 and 0.12, respectively.

Potential two- and three-way interactions between CMDs,
multimorbidity and refugee status were assessed. CMDs and
multimorbidity signiﬁcantly interacted (p = 0.0049) in DP.

1Swedish-born indicates individuals with both parents being native Swedes.
2F30–F39, F40–F48 includes the ICD-10 codes of common mental disorders.
3CMDs indicates common mental disorders.

Regarding UE,
the interactions between CMDs and refugee
status, as well as between refugee status and multimorbidity
were signiﬁcant (p < 0.0001). Yet, the three-way interaction of
multimorbidity, CMD, and refugee status was neither signiﬁcant
for DP (p = 0.52) nor for UE (p = 0.45).

Table 3 presents the most common diagnostic groups among
refugees and Swedish-born individuals with CMDs and without
CMDs. Accidents and external injuries of various parts of the body
(ICD-10 Chapter S) were the most frequently occurring diagnostic
groups in refugees and Swedish-born young adults. In individuals
with CMDs, diagnostic groups containing CMDs such as neurotic,
stress-related, and somatoform disorders (F40–F48) and mood
[aﬀective] disorders (F30–F39) were the most frequently occurring
diagnostic groups in refugees and Swedish-born young adults, next
to the no CMDs diagnostic group of accidents. Diagnostic groups
that showed diﬀerences between refugee status and CMDs were
mostly pregnancy and female-sex-related diagnoses (Chapter O,
N80–N98, N70–N77). Overall, there is a clear tendency toward
higher frequencies in the CMD group across all diagnostic groups

in refugees and Swedish-born, suggesting a link between CMD and
increased multimorbidity in these cohorts.

Figure 1 shows the network of interrelations of diagnostic
groups, together with their frequencies and relative risks for UE.
The network reveals the existence of several densely connected (i.e.,
frequently co-occurring) diagnostic groups, referred to as diagnosis
clusters. Diagnoses from a cluster tend to co-occur in individual
patients, whereas there is substantially less tendency for two
diagnoses belonging to diﬀerent clusters to co-occur in a patient.
The size of the node indicates the number of individuals that had
a diagnosis within the given diagnostic group; the color of the
node indicates the relative risk of UE among refugees with CMDs,
compared to Swedish-born with CMDs. Diagnostic groups related
to mental disorders (Chapter F, including CMDs) formed a densely
connected diagnosis cluster; one diagnosis cluster consisted of
poisonings and external causes of morbidity (Chapters S, T, and V–
X); whereas another cluster of diagnostic groups emerged around
pregnancy-related diagnoses (Chapter O), partially overlapping the
cluster of disease of the genitourinary system (Chapter N).

The ICD-10 codes for all diagnostic groups in the network
are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The dominant purple color in
the multimorbidity network (Figure 1) shows that refugees with
CMDs had a higher relative risk of UE, compared to Swedish-born
with CMDs in the vast majority of diagnostic groups. Amongst all
diagnostic groups, two diagnostic groups demonstrated particularly
high relative risk of UE. Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional
disorders (F20–F29) had 3.46 times (CI [1.77, 6.75]) higher risk
of UE in refugees with CMDs as compared to the Swedish-born
with CMDs. Refugees with CMDs who had behavioral syndromes
associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors
(F50–F59) showed 3.41 times (CI [1.90, 6.10]) the risk of UE
compared to their counterparts (Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion

Main ﬁndings

This registry-based matched cohort study of 249,245 refugee
and Swedish-born young adults leveraging a disease network
approach, had two main aims. The ﬁrst aim was to evaluate
the association of multimorbidity, CMD, and refugee status
with subsequent LMM, whereas the second aim was to identify
diagnostic groups with an elevated risk of LMM in refugee and
Swedish-born young adults with CMDs. As for the ﬁrst aim, we
found that multimorbidity was associated with LMM. The ﬁndings
suggest that refugees had lower odds of DP and higher odds of UE
than Swedish-born. While there was a strong association between
multimorbidity score and CMDs with DP among Swedish-born,
CMDs but not multimorbidity showed elevated risk toward UE in
Swedish-born. Multimorbidity in the presence of CMDs suggested
a stronger inﬂuence on subsequent UE in refugees. There was
a signiﬁcant interaction between CMDs and multimorbidity in
DP (p = 0.0049), whereas CMDs and refugee status, as well as
refugee status and multimorbidity signiﬁcantly interacted in UE (p
< 0.0001). As for the second aim, the majority of diagnostic groups
showed higher relative risks of UE for young refugees with CMDs,
compared to their Swedish-born counterparts.

We found a lower risk of DP and higher risk of UE in
refugees than Swedish-born young adults across all CMDs and
multimorbidity categories. These ﬁndings are consistent with a
previous study examining the relation of multimorbidity with
LMM among refugee youths and Swedish-born, and might be
attributable to several mediators (24). First, lower socioeconomic
status was associated with less granted DP (5, 32). Limited social
support and inadequate knowledge of the social insurance system
might potentially place refugees at a disadvantage for eﬀectively
seeking DP (33). Second, parental support plays a role in receiving
DP in early adulthood (23, 34, 35). Previous studies suggested
that young adults with higher-educated parents have better family
support and access to care (34, 36). Disparities in health education
of parents may lead to disparities in early identiﬁcation of child or
adolescent care needs, which could then contribute to disparities in
DP during early adulthood. Further, the high barrier to successfully
receiving DP may lead to increased utilization of other forms of
social security support among socially disadvantaged groups. These
disparities in access to DP suggest that the number of refugees
who are in need of DP might be underestimated. Lastly, young

refugees were more likely to have lower educational attainment,
language barriers, social stigma, and marginalization (8). These
hardships make it more challenging to obtain a job (8), and may
contribute to the higher UE rate in refugee youths at baseline
regardless of CMD diagnosis. Nevertheless, another Swedish cohort
study showed a higher risk of DP in refugees with speciﬁc diagnoses
than the native-born in all ages (6). This discrepancy may be
due to methodological design, the adjustment of confounders
in the models, and potential eﬀect modiﬁcation by age due to
our study focus speciﬁcally in young adults. While the previous
study examined the speciﬁc mental and somatic disorders with
DP, our study accounted for all the co-occurring diagnoses by
conceptualizing into a multimorbidity score.

The present study suggests that co-occurrence of CMDs with
other coexisting mental or somatic diagnoses (referred to as
multimorbidity) elevated the risk of subsequent DP in young adults,
particularly in Swedish-born youths. Diseases may coexist due
to another, confounding condition, random chance, or selection
bias: random chance refers to etiologically unrelated diagnoses
that develop independently; selection bias refers to the greater
likelihood of identifying a new diagnosis among individuals seeking
medical care (18, 37). This increased overall disease burden within
an individual could impede the engagement in the labor market
(24, 38, 39). However, potential causal relations between CMDs
and other chronic conditions with regard to work productivity loss
have not yet been fully understood. Anxiety and mood disorders
were found to have an additive eﬀect with most physical disorders
in terms of functional impairment and work loss in a previous
study (38), whereas other studies suggested a synergistic eﬀect on
work productivity loss and DP (22, 28). Moreover, perceived health
status, high job demands, and stress may prolong the duration
of sick leave among individuals with CMDs (40). Furthermore,
granting DP requires medical assessments from specialists to
conﬁrm reduced work capacity (41), meaning that this outcome
variable can be expected to be more closely related to higher
medical severity than UE. Due to the large number of aﬀected
youths and impact upon the labor market integration, promotion of
awareness of comorbid mental and somatic disorders with CMDs,
comprehensive assessments, and enhanced collaboration between
psychiatric and somatic health care are crucial for preventing DP.

In contrast to our result for DP but in line with a previous
study investigating the relation of refugee status and speciﬁc mental
disorders with LMM, CMD status added no further risk to UE
in refugee youths, while Swedish-born youth had an increased
risk of UE with diagnosis of CMD (7). This study adds that
multimorbidity, in addition to CMD, does not have an inﬂuence on
the subsequent risk of UE in either refugees or Swedish-born. UE is
further associated with other residual confounding measures, such
as discrimination and language proﬁciency, putting refugee youths
at a disadvantage in the labor market (8). Refugee or migration
status alone were shown to be strong risk factors for UE, with
estimated two to three times higher likelihood of UE than for their
native-born counterparts without CMDs (5, 7). The greater severity
of mental disorders due to the migration experience may result in
obtaining disability beneﬁts other than UE (42).

The multimorbidity network revealed higher relative risk
of UE in refugees with CMDs compared to Swedish-born in
most diagnostic groups. In particular, delusional and behavior
syndromes related disorders showed the highest relative risk

increase. Lack of adequate support from the health care system and
labor market may contribute to this observation. Moreover, somatic
disorders might be underdiagnosed due to inadequate treatment
of CMDs among the refugee young adults, which may further
marginalize this vulnerable group (36, 43, 44).

Methodological discussion

Strengths of the current study include the large sample size,
long follow-up time, nationwide high quality of validated register
data (45), prospective design, as well as the novel network
approach in computing the multimorbidity score. Our study also
has limitations. First, we lacked statistical power to study DP
with CMDs across various multimorbidity categories for refugee
young adults. Second, diagnostic data was constrained to inpatient
and specialized outpatient care. Young refugees showed lower
healthcare utilization compared to their counterparts in most
mental disorders (46). The included refugees of this study might
therefore experience higher severity of their diseases. Treatment of
aﬀective disorders often occurs in the primary care setting. Thus,
the use of antidepressants might have been one of the criteria of
CMD to account for the lack of information in primary health
care. Third, data describing the disease severity was not collected
in our study. Moreover, our study focuses on refugee and Swedish-
born young adults in Sweden and labor market welfare support,
which may not be generalizable to countries with diﬀerent social
insurance systems. Furthermore, CMDs among refugees may not
be detected to the same extent as in their Swedish counterparts
due to educational diﬀerences and a lack of consideration of
cultural diversity competences in the assessment by health care
professionals and other barriers such as stigmatization. Perceived
CMDs symptoms diﬀer by cultural background and could be
underdiagnosed given a lack of culturally sensitive instruments (43,
44). This may lead to lower psychiatric utilization and inadequate
screening among refugee youths. Providing transcultural medicine
training for healthcare professionals could decrease the bias in
clinical settings and increase access to healthcare utilization for
refugees. Hence, promoting accessible intervention to address
CMDs in refugee youths and improving awareness of cultural
factors in the medical assessment are essential.

Conclusion

The co-occurrence of CMDs and multimorbidity was strongly
associated with higher risk of DP in Swedish-born young adults.
The majority of diagnostic groups in the multimorbidity network
suggested an elevated risk of UE in young refugees with CMDs
compared to their counterparts. These ﬁndings elucidate how
multimorbidity in individuals with or without CMDs contribute
to LMM and oﬀer leverage points for targeted intervention and
supportive prevention from primary and specialist care providers.
