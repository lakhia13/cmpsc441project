Abstract: At the core of an overcontrolled personality and coping style is a tendency to
have too much self-control, exhibiting as behavioral and cognitive inﬂexibility, high inhibi-
tion of emotion, high detail-focused processing and perfectionism, and a lack of social
connectedness. Overcontrol underlies a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses and as such,
an innovative transdiagnostic therapy called Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy
(RO DBT) has been developed to treat disorders characterized by overcontrol. RO DBT
targets maladaptive social signaling in order to help individuals “rejoin the tribe,” hypothe-
sizing that increasing social connectedness by means of targeting social signaling is the
central mechanism of change in treatment. Because RO DBT is used for individuals with an
overcontrolled personality style, rather than individual disordered symptoms, it can be used
including treatment-resistant
transdiagnostically across a range of comorbid disorders,
depression and anxiety, anorexia nervosa, and personality disorders such as obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. The current article introduces this novel treatment approach
and discusses its emphasis on social signaling and its transdiagnostic nature. We then provide
the ﬁrst review of existing literature testing the efﬁcacy of RO DBT across clinical popula-
tions, discuss issues related to assessment of overcontrol, and speculate on future directions
for this novel therapy.

Emotional well-being is often presumed to be positively correlated with self-control
and research generally supports this presumption.1,2 Consequently, high degrees of
self-control are commonly held in high esteem. However, extremes of anything are
often detrimental, and there is a small but growing literature describing a non-linear
relationship between self-control and emotional health, one in which the extremes
at either end are associated with various forms of dysfunction.3–5 Too much self-
control, or an “overcontrolled” pattern of coping, is characterized by a constellation
inﬂexible behavioral repertoires, emotional suppression and
of characteristics:
inhibition, elevated distress tolerance,
low
reward responding and high threat responding, anxious apprehension, and high
detail focused processing.3 Overcontrolled coping is problematic because it is
associated with a range of dysfunction, including social isolation, inferior outcomes
in anxiety disorder treatment,6 and severe and difﬁcult-to-treat mental health
problems, such as anorexia nervosa, treatment-resistant depression and personality

disorders.7–11 Because the most prevalent societal view is
that greater self-control leads to better health outcomes,
high self-control can be heuristically overlooked in psy-
chological interventions or not directly targeted in therapy.
Fortunately, a novel psychotherapy that directly targets
coping, Radically Open Dialectical
overcontrolled
Behavior Therapy (RO DBT)3 has been developed.

Radically Open Dialectical Behavior
Therapy (RO DBT)
Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO DBT)
is an evidence-based psychosocial therapy that emerged
from “standard” Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT™).12
DBT is a widely studied treatment originally developed for
chronic suicidal behavior, subsequently was tested in bor-
derline personality disorder, and has since been extended
across disorders including substance use disorders13 and
eating disorders.14 DBT is based on behaviorism, dialec-
tical philosophy and Zen Buddhist practice and dialecti-

weekly individual therapy sessions, weekly skills group
sessions, as needed telephone coaching and clinician team
consultation meetings. DBT transdiagnostically treats dis-
orders characterized by high impulsivity and emotion dys-
regulation, or maladaptive “undercontrol,” (for further
discussion of undercontrol, see below).

RO DBT is also a transdiagnostic therapy; however, it
treats disorders at the opposite end of the spectrum. Rather
than targeting disorders of undercontrol, RO DBT targets
disorders characterized by maladaptive overcontrolled
coping.3 Similar to DBT,
the intervention is based on
behaviorism and dialectical philosophy, the intervention
is 30 weeks in duration and entails concurrent weekly
individual therapy and a two-and-a-half-hour skills class,
with options of telephone coaching and clinician team
consultation meetings.

Although a similar framework as DBT, RO DBT dif-
fers from DBT in key ways. First, the content of RO DBT
individual therapy and skills class sessions differs drasti-
cally from DBT. RO DBT addresses overarching classes of
behavior, or behavioral themes, that help guide treatment
and identify targets related to underlying tendencies of
overcontrol, including 1) hyper detail-focused and overly
cautious behavior, 2) rigid and rule-governed behavior, 3)
inhibited and disingenuous emotional expression, 4) dis-
tant and aloof social connectedness and relationships
in social
and 5)

increased tendencies

to engage

comparisons, envy and bitterness.3 Second, the core pro-
blem addressed in DBT treatment is emotional dysregula-
tion and mood-dependent behavior, while RO DBT targets
loneliness resulting from low openness and
emotional
maladaptive social signaling. Third, and related,
the
mechanism of change in DBT is via targeting maladaptive
action tendencies that stem from dysregulated emotions,
while for RO DBT it is via targeting social signaling
deﬁcits. Fourth, DBT comes from a Zen Buddhist perspec-
tive, while RO DBT incorporates practices of Malamati
Suﬁsm. Fifth, the role of the therapist differs. In DBT the
therapist
is focused on helping the client not act on
impulses and to be more organized while in RO DBT,
the therapist is less directive and teaches the client how
to be more relaxed, spontaneous, and express emotions in
a more vulnerable and open way. Lastly, in RO DBT there
is an emphasis on self-enquiry and self-discovery and
a leaning in toward uncomfortable emotions for the pur-
pose of learning, while in DBT the emphasis is more on
external contingencies and ﬁnding ways to tolerate or
regulate difﬁcult emotions.

Training to become an RO DBT therapist includes two
options. One avenue is to attend an “intensive” training
that includes two separate one-week in-person trainings
that are separated by six months. A second avenue is by
completing a “blended learning” program that includes
and shortened in-person trainings.
online webinars
Although these trainings provide a baseline of competency
in clinically administering RO DBT, ongoing supervision
of videotaped client sessions from approved RO DBT
supervisors, and peer-supervision in team consultation is
warranted to become proﬁcient and adherent in effectively
delivering the treatment. Certiﬁcation in RO DBT is cur-
rently being developed, and self-assessment for adherence
to the treatment is available in the textbook.3

The Importance and Novelty of
Targeting Social Signaling
RO DBT encompasses several novel and distinctive fea-
tures. For example, it uniquely challenges the heuristic of
linearity with respect to self-control and healthy function-
ing that basic research and society often promote.15
Second and importantly, RO DBT de-emphasizes the com-
mon tendency to “go inside” the individual to alter internal
states (ie, cognition, emotion) that mainstream cognitive

and psychological connectedness with important others,
similar to interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT).17 However,
RO DBT focuses on the social connectedness of a speciﬁc
group of clients, those assessed as having disorders related
to maladaptive overcontrol, with interventions that target
speciﬁc types of social deﬁcits.

What truly makes RO DBT unique is that RO DBT
builds on this compelling literature by being the ﬁrst
treatment
to emphasize social signaling as a primary
mechanism of change. It underscores the importance of
targeting publicly observable behaviors (eg, social signals)
to increase psychological connectedness with important
others. A social signal is deﬁned as any action or overt
behavior, regardless of its form, intent, or the performer’s
awareness, that is carried out in the presence of another
person.3 A social signal is a form of communication, such
as an eye roll,
treatment, walking away, or
a smile. RO DBT hypothesizes that the mechanism of
change in treatment is that open expression of emotion
leads
connection.
Mechanisms of behavior change generally refer to the
underlying basic psychological processes that drive change
in therapy, and for RO DBT, the theorized critical process
driving change in treatment is social signaling. As such,
RO DBT aims to teach overcontrolled individuals how to
modify their social signaling so as to openly express
emotions and vulnerabilities, which results in increased
social connectedness.

the silent

RO DBT is informed by translational research, includ-
ing that of evolutionary science. In order to survive, our
species had to develop a way to form close bonds, share
resources and work closely with genetically unrelated
individuals. A quick way of communicating our intentions
to others was necessary. RO DBT contends that social
signals evolved to facilitate social bonds and connections
and this was a key to our survival. A highly sophisticated

system of social signaling allowed individuals to signal
intentions or feelings through facial expressions, gestures
or words.3 What we also know is that others perceive
maladaptive social signaling, such as incongruent emo-
tional expression or suppressed emotional expression, as
untrustworthy or inauthentic, which in turn impairs the
development of social closeness.22 It is not just important
to signal openness, but also to not signal in an inauthentic
manner by masking behaviors. Individuals often respond
to social signals in a visceral way that may not even be in
their awareness. A ﬂat face showing no expression of
emotion, for example, may create discomfort in others
and a wish to not engage. Indeed, RO DBT directly targets
maladaptive social signals,
including micro-expressions
that interfere with connecting with others and the absence
of adaptive social signals.

strategies

In addition to targeting client maladaptive social sig-
nals, an additional aspect of social signaling addressed in
RO DBT is how the client’s maladaptive social signaling is
likely to affect the therapeutic relationship. The therapy
includes
to help form
the
a relationship with an individual with an overcontrolled
temperament and maladaptive social
signaling. This
allows the client to experience an interpersonal connection
and addresses the common problem of clients abandoning
therapy when experiencing discomfort, conﬂict or per-
ceived lack of treatment relevance. The therapist acts as
a “tribal ambassador,” someone who recognizes the cli-
ent’s lack of knowledge about how to form intimate rela-
tionships and warmly welcomes them back to the tribe.

Transdiagnostic Utility
Another distinctive feature of RO DBT is its transdiagnos-
tic utility. Transdiagnostic treatments allow the targeting of
overlapping maladaptive characteristics across comorbid
psychiatric conditions. This is desirable because comor-
bidity is common and substantial in mental health23 and
the number of treatments for individual disorders is high,
requiring signiﬁcant time and money from clinicians to
achieve and maintain competency in multiple protocols.24
Contemporary examples of
therapies
include the uniﬁed protocol for transdiagnostic treatment
for emotional disorders (UP) designed for anxiety and
mood
disorders, Acceptance Commitment Therapy
(ACT),25 developed to target any disorder in which experi-
ential avoidance is a core feature and DBT™,12 utilized
for disorders of undercontrol, including borderline person-
ality disorder.

RO DBT extends the transdiagnostic tradition by
addressing unique treatment targets in subsets of indivi-
duals with differing symptom presentations but a similar
underlying temperamental and coping style. Speciﬁcally,
RO DBT targets maladaptive overcontrol across treatment-
resistant mood and anxiety disorders (eg, depression,
social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive
compulsive disorder), eating disorders (anorexia nervosa)
and personality pathology (eg, obsessive compulsive per-
sonality disorder, avoidant personality disorder). Of note,
although mood and anxiety disorders often respond favor-
ably to ﬁrst-line interventions such as cognitive behavioral
approaches, those individuals that do not respond to effec-
tive ﬁrst-line treatments may experience treatment resis-
tance because of underlying personality tendencies and
overlearned perceptual and regulatory biases.26 As such,
when ﬁrst-line treatments such as cognitive behavior
therapy16 are ineffective, assessing for underlying tenden-
cies of overcontrol may provide direction. If maladaptive
overcontrol is evident, RO DBT is indicated. Where RO
DBT may be a ﬁrst-line treatment is speciﬁcally for per-
sonality disorders, including obsessive compulsive person-
ality disorder and related Cluster A and C disorders that
are characterized by overcontrol as well as for anorexia
nervosa (while also ensuring that a separate team is help-
ing manage weight restoration and medical issues). There
are no currently empirically proven superior treatments for
anorexia27 and RO DBT has effectively been tested
(demonstrating large effect sizes, see below) in anorexia
in both inpatient and outpatient settings.28,29

Taken together, anxiety, mood and eating disorders
demonstrate high comorbidities with each other as well
as with personality disorders.9,30–32 As such, RO DBT
purports that “personality matters” in the treatment of
many psychological disorders and thus targets underlying
personality components and tendencies that occur across
disorders.3 For those individuals who do not respond to
ﬁrst-line treatments and whose psychiatric illness is char-
acterized by maladaptive overcontol, RO DBT may be
warranted. The growing empirical literature on RO DBT
supports the importance of intervening with this personal-
ity and coping style.

Current Evidence Base
Although RO DBT is still just beginning to be widely
disseminated, there is already a foundation supporting its
efﬁcacy as shown by the following review of all peer-
reviewed published studies that have clinically tested RO

DBT. The most robust evidence of the efﬁcacy of RO DBT
is from a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) that
tested RO DBT versus treatment as usual (TAU) for adult
patients with treatment refractory depression. In order to
be included in the study, participants needed to be cur-
rently depressed, have experienced at least two previous
depressive episodes or chronic depression, and, must have
been non-responsive to at least 6 weeks of antidepressant
medication.33 Moreover, 96% of participants met the cri-
teria for at least one comorbid disorder (86% at least one
DSM-IV Axis I disorder and 78% for at least one DSM-IV
Axis II disorder).33 As anticipated, participants were difﬁ-
cult-to-treat non-responders to other pharmacologic and
therapeutic intervention with high comorbidity and hetero-
geneity. Findings from this RCT indicated that participants
in RO DBT (n=162) experienced signiﬁcantly reduced
depressive symptoms compared with TAU following treat-
ment (n=88; d=1.03).26 However, this signiﬁcant differ-
ence did not survive signiﬁcance testing at 4-month
follow-up, although still trended in the same direction.
Full remission rates were low across both treatments;
however, partial remission rates were non-signiﬁcantly
higher in RO DBT (23% post-treatment at 7 months,
26% at 12 months and 33% at 18 months) compared
with TAU (6%, 22% and 24% at 7, 12, and 18 months,
respectively), as were participants' subjective report of
reliable
change.
and
Additionally, participants in RO DBT demonstrated sig-
niﬁcant increases in emotional coping and decreases in
psychological inﬂexibility. Limitations of this multi-site
RCT include a smaller than planned sample size great
and therapist heterogeneity in patient outcomes,26 possibly
indicating difﬁculty delivering the treatment. Despite these
limitations, the ﬁrst multi-site RCT of RO DBT was effec-
tive in decreasing depressive symptoms immediately post-
treatment (with a large effect size) as well as improving
psychological functioning related to overcontrolled ten-
dencies (eg, emotional coping and ﬂexibility) over follow-
up.

Earlier pilot studies on RO DBT were completed in
samples of older adults with non-responding chronic
depression.34 In an initial pilot study, RO DBT demon-
strated equivalent decreases in depression post-therapy
(n=16, d=2.51) when compared with standard medication
treatment (n=15; d=2.24).35 However, outcomes differed
at the six month follow-up: participants exposed to RO
DBT exhibited signiﬁcantly fewer depressive symptoms

a separate study and the ﬁrst RCT comparing medication
alone and RO DBT plus medication in chronically
depressed older adults (n=34), groups demonstrated non-
signiﬁcantly different levels of remission post-treatment
(n=34; d=0.14 and d=0.39 for the Hamilton Rating Scale
and Beck Depression Inventory,37

respectively).38 However, again, at six month follow up,
RO DBT showed superior outcomes with signiﬁcantly
higher remission rates compared with medication alone
(unable to calculate effect size).38 In a second RCT that
included chronically depressed older adults with comorbid
personality disorders who ﬁrst underwent 8 weeks medi-
cation trial prior to either continuing with TAU medication
or adding RO DBT to ongoing medication (n=37), there
were no differences in the two groups following skills
group completion (d=0.49), following individual treatment
(d=0.34), or at a six-month follow-up (d=0.30). However,
compared with medication only, RO DBT plus medication
led to signiﬁcant decreases in interpersonal sensitivity and
interpersonal aggression, both of which are characteristic
relational problems that typify personality disorders.38 Of
note, limitations of both above studies include small sam-
ple size, increased time spent with patients in the RO DBT
condition, and an earlier version of RO DBT than is used
in standard practice currently. Together, initial evidence
using an earlier version of the treatment demonstrated no
signiﬁcant differences from ongoing medication manage-
ment immediately post-treatment, but preliminary indica-
tion that the longer term effects of RO DBT compared
with medication are enhanced in coping and relational
outcomes.

RO DBT has also been evaluated in anorexia nervosa.

treatment of anorexia27 and because anorexia is character-
ized by poor ﬂexibility and social connectedness and high

inhibition and threat sensitivity,
conceptualized as a prototypical disorder of overcontrol.7
In an initial feasibility study, RO DBT was implemented in
an inpatient setting for anorexia (n=47) and demonstrated
a high completion rate of treatment (72%).28 For those
treatment completers, RO DBT led to a signiﬁcant
increase in BMI (d=1.91). RO DBT also led to signiﬁcant
improvements in eating disordered symptoms (d=1.17),
quality of life (d=0.1.03), and signiﬁcant reductions in
distress (d=1.34). However, post-treatment follow-up data
were not obtained. In a second pilot study, patients with
anorexia from an adult outpatient eating disorders clinic
(n=9) who participated in RO DBT demonstrated

decreases in eating disorder behaviors and symptoms and
medical problems associated with anorexia (eg, anemia,
osteoporosis).29 Importantly, 55% of the sample regained
regular menses by 12-month follow up (none reported
regular menses at baseline) and improvements in BMI
post-treatment were maintained at six and twelve months
follow up (effect size d’s= −1.12, −0.87, and-1.12 at post-
treatment, 6mo and 12mo follow-up,
respectively).
Moreover, RO DBT led to fewer personality and other
comorbid disorders post-treatment (eg, obsessive compul-
sive personality disorder (OCPD), avoidant personality
disorder (APD), suicide attempts, social phobia) as well
functioning.29 Of note though,
as
this second study was a case series design and a small
sample size with uncontrolled treatment duration limits
generalizability. Notably, although not initially designed
to treat anorexia nervosa, RO DBT appears to be prelimi-
narily effective in a notoriously treatment resistant patient
population, demonstrating large effect sizes and signiﬁcant
improvements not only in eating disordered pathology, but
also in comorbid pathology and functioning.

increased global

Rather than treating speciﬁc disorders (eg, depression
or anorexia), RO DBT has also been adapted for use in
clinically heterogeneous overcontrolled populations. For
instance, a psychiatric hospital outpatient sample (n=117)
participated in RO DBT skills or treatment as usual
(TAU).39 RO DBT participants demonstrated signiﬁcantly
greater reductions in overall psychopathology (d=1.67).
They also exhibited signiﬁcantly greater improvements in
coping skills (d=0.81), perceptions of safety in social
environments (d=0.50), and decreases in need for structure
(d=0.41) compared with TAU. Moreover, at 3-month fol-
low-up, signiﬁcant improvements remained in skills use
and decreased need for structure in the RO DBT group
compared with TAU. Limitations include a lack of random
assignment to conditions and lack of follow-up in the TAU
group. This initial ﬁnding demonstrates medium to large
effect sizes and preliminary utility in heterogeneous sam-
ples characterized by an overcontrolled personality.

Assessment of Overcontrol in
Psychiatric Illness
Overcontrol in itself is not a diagnosable psychiatric ill-
is
ness, nor is it always maladaptive, and as such,
imperative to take care in assessing overcontrol in treat-
ment-seeking populations to consider whether RO DBT is
a good ﬁt. Speciﬁcally, maladaptive overcontrol

a multifaceted phenotype that emerges from complex
transactions among biology, environment, and individual
styles of coping.3 It is characterized by low receptivity and
openness, high rigidity or inﬂexibility, high detail focused
processing, pervasive inhibited or suppressed emotional
expression, rule-governed behaviors and strong moral con-
victions, and low social connectedness. Although features
of overcontrol share much in common with symptoms of
OCPD, overcontrol is conceptually different and should be
distinguished from this personality disorder as part of
is a multifaceted dimen-
assessment. First, overcontrol
sional phenotype that
is not always maladaptive, but
rather, in some instances is related to success and can be
evident in high functioning individuals.3 Second, although
the diagnostic criteria for OCPD are prototypical examples
of maladaptive overcontrolled coping, OCPD does not
necessarily include the full spectrum of how maladaptive
overcontrol can evidence. Indeed, RO DBT posits that an
overcontrolled presentation can present as one of two
lower-order subtypes: overly disagreeable and overly
agreeable.3 Although much of the thinking on these sub-
types is still speculative, overly disagreeable overcon-
trolled individuals tend to value fairness, being correct,
and appearing competent above all else,3 and this subtype
is theoretically more closely associated with OCPD.
Overly agreeable overcontrolled individuals value main-
taining the peace and appearing liked by others, and this
subtype is theoretically more closely associated with avoi-
dant personality disorder. Assessing for these subtypes is
important in order to tailor RO DBT to the speciﬁc pre-
sentation of overcontrol (see3 for assessment of subtypes).
Another quick and initial strategy to assess overcontrol
is through the use of questionnaires. Although the devel-
opment of validated assessments of overcontrol
is
ongoing, there are available self-reported questionnaires
for
their
children41 that can be used as an initial assessment. In
adults, the Brief Overcontrol Scale demonstrates norms
of dimensional overcontrol among males and females
and ongoing work is testing clinical cut-offs.42 For ado-
lescent populations, a screener differentiating maladaptive
overcontrol and undercontrol traits in an adolescent com-
munity population is currently undergoing validation (the
Over and Undercontrolled Traits Measure for Adolescents;
OUT-Ma)40. Lastly,
to identify early manifestations of
overcontrol when it is ﬁrst thought to become stable (age
~5-6 years)43 the Overcontrol in Youth Checklist (OCYC)
was developed.41 The OCYC is

It will be imperative for future work to not only assess
dimensional overcontrol, but also to create standardized

In addition to self or parent-reported measures of over-
control, a clinical interview is essential. This is of parti-

between
undercontrol.45
maladaptive
Undercontrol is characterized by low inhibitory control,
global focused processing, high reward sensitivity and
chaotic relationships. Borderline personality disorder is
a prototypical disorder of undercontrol. Assessing social
signaling is warranted in distinguishing over- and under-
controlled individuals: overcontrolled individuals are
inhibited, controlled, and mood independent while under-
controlled individuals tend to be dramatic, disinhibited and
mood-driven in their social signaling.45 Another critical
and unique factor to consider in assessment is the context
of behavior: whether a behavior occurs in public or in
private. A public setting means that the behavior occurs
in the presence of another person who is not
in the
immediate family or
social analogue while
similar
a private setting is any situation in which a person believes
he is unidentiﬁable, anonymous, or alone (or with very
close others). While individuals with overcontrolled tem-
perament typically inhibit displays of emotion, especially
in public settings, they may show emotional leakage (dra-
matic displays of emotions such as yelling, rage, tearful-
ness and other expressions of intense emotions) in private
settings.

Indeed, a failure to distinguish between public and
private behavior is believed to be one of the causes of
mislabeling overcontrol as undercontrol.3 Speciﬁcally,
overcontrolled individuals may endorse symptoms of
undercontrolled diagnoses in standard clinical assess-
ments. This was demonstrated in a RCT of overcontrolled
adults with treatment-resistant depression,26,46 during
which overcontrolled clients endorsed up to nine symp-
toms of borderline personality disorder, a prototypical dis-
order of undercontrol.45 After case consultation, many
individuals endorsing symptoms were deemed overcon-
trolled, suggesting that a number of symptoms that appear
to reﬂect undercontrolled tendencies (ie, self-harm/suicid-
ality, chronic emptiness, identity disturbance), can also be

problems reported by individuals with overcontrol. As
such,
it may be important for clinicians to ask more
speciﬁc details about how the symptoms are expressed
(ie, socially signaled), in what context, and to what degree
the behavior is expressed (eg, a stern tone versus breaking
things when in a rage).

Future Directions and Questions
Overcontrol is rooted in personality style, and as such, devel-
ops early and underlies multiple forms of psychopathology.
The beneﬁcial outcomes of targeting overcontrol in RO DBT
have only begun to be tapped, as RO DBT could have far-
reaching effects across various presentations. To start, over-
control purportedly becomes stable around age ﬁve43 and
remains generally stable across the lifespan.47 As such, iden-
tifying maladaptive overcontrol in young children is impera-
tive to begin intervening earlier.41 Similarly, overcontrol in
childhood is associated with many of the same outcomes as
adults: social functioning problems such as withdrawal and
anxiety
loneliness
symptoms.41,48,49 Developmentally adapting RO DBT to
young children and their caregivers may provide a window
of opportunity to make a large impact, by targeting over-
controlled coping styles when they are more malleable for
change and helping teach skills that could have lifelong
impact.

internalizing

and

Related to targeting young children, research has demon-
strated that working with families of those diagnosed with
mental disorders leads to better outcomes.50,51 As such,
research is needed to determine if and how working with
families of maladaptively overcontrolled individuals (both as
children and adults) leads to beneﬁcial outcomes such as
improved prognosis of the OC individual. The biosocial
theory for overcontrol speciﬁcs factors that give rise to
maladaptive OC, including environments that provide rein-
forcing contingencies for perfectionism, inhibiting emotions,
winning, following rules, and tolerating pain. Punishing con-
tingencies for mistakes, showing vulnerability and requesting
nurturance may also be present. Teaching family members
skills and ways of responding that do not reinforce over-
controlled responding would seem to be an effective inter-
vention, but that research remains to be done. Addressing
maladaptive overcontrol and undercontrol in couples' work
brings additional considerations, such as how to most effec-
tively intervene with different combinations of undercon-
trolled and overcontrolled couples.

a potentially promising area for

Although antisocial behavior is commonly thought to be
characterized by an undercontrolled personality style
because of poor impulse control, as early as the 1960s
subtype of overcontrolled violent offender was
a
identiﬁed.52,53 However,
there have been limited high-
quality studies examining psychological interventions for
this purported overcontrolled offender subtype. Because
RO DBT was designed to speciﬁcally target overcontrolled
coping, a line of research has been initiated with this
violent offender subtype.54 Preliminary ﬁndings conﬁrmed
several predictions derived from the RO DBT model.
Speciﬁcally,
the overcontrolled sub-type was prevalent
(44%) and hypothesized bio-temperamental biases were
observed in a sample of offenders.54 In addition, relative
to undercontrolled offenders, overcontrolled offenders
were less socially connected to others (ie, social detach-
ment and independent staff ratings). To this end, a trial of
RO DBT with violent offenders in a maximum-security
setting is currently underway.

Another novel avenue for future research in RO DBT is in
individuals adjusting to chronic illness. Research has repeat-
edly demonstrated a bi-directional relationship between men-
tal and physical health disorders55 and other psychological
treatments, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(ACT),25 have demonstrated efﬁcacy in reducing psycholo-
gical symptoms and improving symptom management in
patients with HIV, chronic pain and cystic ﬁbrosis.56
However, many individuals remain symptomatic after under-
going the best available interventions, such as ACT, and one
could speculate that RO DBT’s focus on targeting personality
could improve outcomes for these treatment non-responders
characterized by overcontrol. For example, overcontrolled
coping, including rigidity and rejection of help, could exacer-
bate chronic health conditions. Additionally, solid organ
transplantation guidelines require the presence of a solid
care plan, implying that patients who are socially isolated
or unable to form close relationships possibly resulting from
speciﬁc personality tendencies are at a decided disadvantage.
Indeed, there is an ongoing pilot study examining RO DBT
for overcontrolled patients living with chronic health
conditions.57

In summary, personality seems to matter when treating
chronic, comorbid and difﬁcult to treat disorders. RO DBT
provides a novel treatment approach that directly targets
social connectedness via a unique mechanism of change:
social signaling. Although initial studies testing RO DBT
in chronically depressed and treatment-resistant samples
indicated no added beneﬁts of RO DBT to ongoing

these
studies hinted at longer-term change in better coping and
remission. Moreover, more recent studies using an updated
manual and examining RO DBT in populations character-
ized by overcontrol, (eg, anorexia, clinically heteroge-
neous overcontrolled samples and treatment-resistant
depression characterized by an overcontrolled style of
coping) demonstrate larger effect sizes.

RO DBT is a novel and innovative treatment that can be
employed for those individuals who display an overcon-
trolled personality and for whom ﬁrst-line interventions are
not effective. Initial research supports RO DBT to be an
effective intervention for chronic and treatment-resistant
mental illnesses. Moreover, ﬁndings from the current review
also highlight the importance of accurately assessing and
identifying overcontrol to ensure that RO DBT is a good ﬁt
for the client. Although a growing body of evidence support-
ing RO DBT is emerging, there is still much research on
assessing overcontrol and testing RO DBT in various treat-
ment-seeking samples that has yet to be done.
