The relationship between borderline 
personality disorder and bipolar disorder
Mark Zimmerman, MD; Theresa A. Morgan, PhD

Introduction

T

he  under-recognition  of  bipolar  disorder  in
patients presenting for the treatment of depression has
been identified as a significant clinical problem.1-11 The
diagnosis of bipolar disorder is often delayed, with the
time between initial treatment seeking and the correct
diagnosis often taking more than 10 years.12,13 The treat-
ment and clinical implications of the failure to recognize
bipolar disorder in depressed patients are significant,
and include the underprescription of mood-stabilizing
medications,  an  increased  risk  of  rapid  cycling,  and
increased costs of care.4,14-16 As a result of the potential
morbidity associated with a delay in diagnosis, experts
have called for improved recognition of bipolar disor-
der,1,6 and screening scales have been developed and rec-
ommended to facilitate the identification of bipolar dis-
order.17-19
Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  a  common
comorbidity in depressed patients that is also under-
diagnosed.20 Compared with patients with major depres-
sive disorder (MDD) without BPD, patients with MDD
and BPD also have excess psychosocial morbidity.21,22
The recognition of BPD is clinically important because
of the availability of specific psychotherapies that are

It is clinically important to recognize both bipolar disorder
and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in patients seek-
ing treatment for depression, and it is important to dis-
tinguish between the two. Research considering whether
BPD  should  be  considered  part  of  a  bipolar  spectrum
reaches differing conclusions. We reviewed the most stud-
ied question on the relationship between BPD and bipo-
lar disorder: their diagnostic concordance. Across studies,
approximately 10% of patients with BPD had bipolar I dis-
order and another 10% had bipolar II disorder. Likewise,
approximately 20% of bipolar II patients were diagnosed
with BPD, though only 10% of bipolar I patients were
diagnosed with BPD. While the comorbidity rates are sub-
stantial,  each  disorder  is  nontheless  diagnosed  in  the
absence of the other in the vast majority of cases (80% to
90%). In studies examining personality disorders broadly,
other personality disorders were more commonly diag-
nosed in bipolar patients than was BPD. Likewise, the con-
verse  is  also  true:  other  axis  I  disorders  such  as  major
depression, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress dis-
order are also more commonly diagnosed in patients with
BPD than is bipolar disorder. These findings challenge the
notion that BPD is part of the bipolar spectrum.

effective23,24 and the possible overprescription of med-
ications that have little benefit and carry the risk of med-
ically significant side effects.25
Because of the potential treatment implications, it is
clinically important to recognize both bipolar disorder
and BPD in patients seeking treatment for depression,
and  it  is  important  to  distinguish  between  the  two.
However, this presupposes that each is a valid diagnos-
tic  entity.  During  the  past  20  years  there  have  been
increasing suggestions that BPD should be conceptual-
ized  as  part  of  the  spectrum  of  bipolar  disorder.
Advocates of the bipolar spectrum suggest that treat-
ments that have been found effective in treating bipo-
lar disorder should be used when treating patients with
BPD because of its inclusion on the bipolar spectrum.6,26-28
Literature reviews considering whether BPD belongs to
the bipolar spectrum have reached differing conclusions.
Smith et al29 suggested that a strong case could be made
that a significant percentage of patients with BPD fall
into the bipolar spectrum, and Belli et al30 concluded
that the two disorders are closely linked in phenome-
nology and treatment response. Antoniadis et al31 and
Coulston et al32 did not draw a conclusion regarding
BPD’s inclusion on the bipolar spectrum, whereas Paris
et al33 and Dolan-Sewell et al34 concluded that empirical
evidence did not support BPD’s link to the bipolar spec-
trum. Sripada and Silk,35 reviewing neuroimaging stud-
ies, noted that there were some areas of overlap and
some differences between BPD and bipolar disorder.
Some of the authors of these reviews noted that few
studies have directly compared patients with bipolar
disorder and BPD, and they called for such empirical
data to help clarify the relationship between the two
disorders.32,35
In the present review we focus on the most studied ques-
tion on the relationship between BPD and bipolar dis-
order—their diagnostic concordance. More than 30 stud-
ies have examined the frequency of bipolar disorder in
patients with borderline personality disorder, or the fre-
quency of BPD in patients with bipolar disorder. We
address  the  following  questions:  (i) What  is  the  fre-
quency of each disorder when the other is present? (ii)
Is the level of co-occurrence elevated? That is, is the
prevalence of BPD significantly higher in patients with
bipolar disorder than in other psychiatric disorders? (iii)
Is BPD the most common personality disorder in bipo-
lar patients or are other personality disorders more fre-
quent? 

Methodological issues in 
personality disorder assessment

Any  review  of  a  topic  involving  personality  disorders
needs  to  consider  assessment  methodology,  because
assessment issues can have a significant impact on the find-
ings. In short, there should be some consideration of the
who, what, and when of personality disorder assessment.
To be sure, these are also issues in the evaluation of Axis I
disorders, though they have not been studied as much as
they have been studied in the personality disorder field.
Who should be questioned when assessing personality
disorders–the target individual or someone who knows
the target individual well? The evaluation of personality
disorders presents special problems that may require the
use of informants. In contrast to the symptoms of major
Axis I disorders, the defining features of personality dis-
orders are based on an extended longitudinal perspective
of how individuals act in different situations, how they
perceive and interact with a constantly changing envi-
ronment,  and  the  perceived  reasonableness  of  their
behaviors and cognitions. Only a minority of the person-
ality  disorder  criteria  are  discrete,  easily  enumerated
behaviors. For any individual to describe their normal
personality they must be somewhat introspective and
aware of the effect their attitudes and behaviors have on
others. But insight is the very thing usually lacking in
individuals with a personality disorder. DSM-IV notes
that the characteristics defining a personality disorder
may not be considered problematic by the affected indi-
vidual (ie, ego-syntonic) and suggests that information be
obtained from informants. Research comparing patient
and informant report of personality pathology has found
marked disagreement between the two sources of infor-
mation.36-39 Only one of the studies examining the fre-
quency of personality disorders in patients with bipolar
disorder examined the impact of informant assessment
on the rates of personality disorder diagnoses.40 Peselow
et al40 presented personality disorder rates based on inde-
pendent patient and informant interviews, and we have
included in Table I the results based on the patient infor-
mation in order to be consistent with other studies. 
What measures should be used to diagnose personality
disorders? Several instruments exist, and while there is
no evidence that any one interview schedule is more reli-
able or valid than another, there is consistent evidence
that prevalence rates are higher based on self-adminis-
tered scales than clinician interviews.41-43

When should personality disorders be assessed during
the course of the mood disorder? The impact of psychi-
atric state on personality disorder assessment has been
well  established,  and  to  minimize  this  effect  some
researchers evaluate personality disorders after a patient
has improved and is in a euthymic state.44-46 The poten-
tial problem with this approach is that it underestimates
the prevalence of personality disorders because the pres-
ence of personality pathology predicts poorer outcome.
Therefore, we included all studies, regardless of when
personality disorders were assessed, with the plan to
examine  the  potential  impact  of  psychiatric  state  on
prevalence rates. 

Excluded studies

To obtain a systematic and comprehensive collection of
published  studies  of  comorbidity,  we  conducted  a
Medline and PsycInfo search on the terms bipolar and
borderline. We reviewed the titles from this search to
identify studies that potentially included information on
the comorbidity of bipolar disorder and BPD. We also
identified studies in reference lists of identified studies
and review articles. 
Several studies that have been included in other reviews
of  bipolar  disorder-BPD  comorbidity  were  excluded
from the present review. Self-report measures of per-
sonality disorders are more appropriately considered
screening 
instruments  than  diagnostic  measures.
Consistent with this, as noted above, prevalence rates
based on self-report scales are higher than those based
on clinician-administered interviews. We therefore did
not include studies that relied on self-report scales to
make personality disorder diagnoses.47-49 We also did not

include studies in which the personality disorder diagnoses
were  based  on  unstructured  clinical  evaluations46,50-57
because these evaluations are less reliable58,59 and under-
detect personality disorders.20,60 Studies in which diag-
noses were based on chart review were also excluded61,62
because diagnoses were based on unstructured evalua-
tions.
Reports based on overlapping samples were included
only once. We included the data from Pica et al,63 but not
from Jackson et al64 and Turley et al,65 because the sam-
ples included the same patients. Similarly, the data in
Colom et al66 was not included because it overlaps with
Vieta  et  al.67,68 Two  papers  from  the  Collaborative
Longitudinal Personality Study reported the frequency
of bipolar disorder in patients with BPD.69,70 The Skodol
et al70 report was based on all patients diagnosed with
BPD, including BPD diagnosed in patients with other pri-
mary personality disorders. The McGlashan et al69 report
only examined the frequency of bipolar disorder in the
175 BPD patients with a principal diagnosis of BPD, and
these patients were the most severe of the BPD group.
We included the results from Skodol et al70 because the
sample was more representative of BPD patients in gen-
eral, and the sample size was larger (240 vs 175). It was
not clear if the two reports by Benazzi71,72 were overlap-
ping. We concluded that they were based on different
samples because the sample sizes were different, the sec-
ond paper referenced the first without indicating that the
samples overlapped, and the time frames over which the
samples were collected were relatively brief (6 months
and  10  months)  and  were  consistent  with  the  rate  of
recruitment over separate periods of time. 
Coid et al73 studied the frequency of bipolar disorder in
prisoners with BPD who manifested affective instability.

Because of the uncertain impact that requiring affective
instability might have on the prevalence of bipolar dis-
order, this study was excluded. We also excluded the
report  by  Schiavone  et  al74 because  the  authors  only
recorded one personality disorder diagnosis even when
patients had more than one. Thus, a patient with BPD
who had another personality disorder that was consid-
ered more clinically significant than BPD would not be
counted as having BPD. This would artificially reduce
the number of patients with bipolar disorder who would
be diagnosed with BPD.
The  report  by  Zanarini  and  colleagues75 on  the  fre-
quency of Axis I disorders in patients with BPD was
excluded because they indicated that patients with a his-
tory of a major psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia
or bipolar disorder were excluded from the sample. It is
therefore not surprising that no patients were diagnosed
with bipolar disorder. We excluded studies of the fre-

quency of BPD in patients with cyclothymic tempera-
ment,76 a construct that is not in DSM-IV and differs
from cyclothymic disorder.

Frequency of borderline personality disorder
in patients with bipolar disorder

Twenty-four studies reported the frequency of BPD in
patients with bipolar disorder (Tables I and II). Most
studies were of psychiatric outpatients, and only four
were of samples of inpatients (or predominantly inpa-
tients). The majority of the studies assessed BPD when
the patients were in remission (n=9) or with no more
than mild symptom severity (n=6); the remainder (n=9)
assessed BPD when the patient was symptomatic. The
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (or DSM-III
or DSM-III-R) was the most commonly used measure to
evaluate  Axis  I  and  Axis  II  disorders.  Most  reports

focused on either bipolar I or bipolar II disorder, and
many did not discuss the bipolar I-bipolar II distinction.
Two reports specified the number of patients with bipo-
lar I and bipolar II disorder, but only reported the preva-
lence of BPD for the entire group without specifying the
prevalence of BPD in the bipolar subtypes.77,78 Only two
groups of investigators examined the frequency of BPD
in patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder.67,79
Across all studies, the frequency of BPD in the 1255
patients with bipolar disorder was 16.0% (n=201). In the
12 studies of 598 patients with bipolar I disorder, the
prevalence of BPD was 10.7% (n=64). In the seven stud-
ies of 261 patients with bipolar II disorder, the preva-
lence of BPD was twice as high (22.9%, n=60). Only two
groups of investigators reported data on both bipolar I
and bipolar II disorder. In two separate reports Vieta et
al67,68 found that BPD was diagnosed twice as frequently
in patients with bipolar II disorder than bipolar I disor-
der (12.5% vs 6.2%). While they did not statistically
compare these prevalence rates, we conducted a chi-
square test based on the raw data provided in the two
articles and found that the difference was not significant
(X2 = 1.71, ns). Similarly, Zimmerman et al79 reported a
higher prevalence of BPD in patients with bipolar II dis-
order, but the difference was not significant. Thus, while
the  summary  across  studies  suggests  a  significantly
higher rate of BPD in patients with bipolar II than bipo-
lar I disorder, the only two studies that allowed for a
direct comparison did not find a significant difference
between  the  two  groups.  In  the  seven  studies  of  389
patients that either did not specify the type of bipolar
disorder, or did not present results separately for bipo-
lar I and bipolar II disorder, the rate of BPD was simi-
lar to the rate in patients with bipolar II disorder (20.8%,
n=81). 
Nine studies indicated that they assessed patients upon
presentation for treatment or when the patients were
symptomatic.71,72,77,79-84 Eight of these nine studies were of
bipolar  II  disorder  or  unspecified  bipolar  disorder.
Across these eight studies the prevalence of BPD was
22.5% (80/355), little different than the prevalence for
the entire group of patients with bipolar II disorder or
unspecified  bipolar  disorder. This  suggests  that  state
effects did not have a robust influence on the prevalence
of BPD. Only one study directly examined the impact of
psychiatric state on the prevalence of BPD. Peselow et
al40 interviewed patients upon presentation for treatment
of hypomania, and again 8 weeks later after symptom

resolution, and found a small decrease in the prevalence
of  BPD  (23.4%  vs  17.0%). We  are  not  aware  of  any
comparable studies that interviewed bipolar patients
while depressed and again after improvement in depres-
sive symptoms.  

Is borderline personality disorder 
the most frequent personality disorder in
patients with bipolar disorder?

Fifteen studies examined the full-range of personality
disorders in patients with bipolar disorder.40,63,67,68,80,82,85-93
In only four of the 15 studies BPD was the most fre-
quent diagnosis.40,68,82,91 Histrionic personality disorder
was the most common diagnosis in four studies 63,67,85,89
and tied for the most common in another two studies,90,93
and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder was the
most common in three studies86,87,92 and tied for the most
common in another two studies.90,93 While this suggests
that there is no clear evidence that BPD is the most
common personality disorder in patients with bipolar
disorder, it is noteworthy that BPD was the most fre-
quent  personality  disorder  diagnosis  in  the  only  two
studies of bipolar II disorder.68,82

Is borderline personality disorder more 
common in patients with bipolar disorder
than psychiatric control groups?

Eight  studies  compared  the  frequency  of  BPD  in
patients with bipolar disorder and major depressive dis-
order.33,71,  81-83,  86,89,92 Four  studies  found  no  difference
between the two groups,81,86,89,92 whereas three of the four
studies of bipolar II disorder found a higher rate of BPD
in the bipolar patients.33,71,82,83 Another study found no dif-
ference in the rate of BPD in patients with bipolar dis-
order and schizophrenia.63 One study compared the fre-
quency of Axis I disorders in a heterogeneous sample of
psychiatric outpatients, and sufficient data was provided
to calculate the rate of BPD in patients with different
diagnoses.79 BPD  was  significantly  more  frequent  in
patients  with  bipolar  disorder  than  in  patients  with
major depressive disorder, as well as more common than
in patients with any psychiatric disorder. Another study
of psychiatric outpatients with mixed diagnoses found a
lower rate of BPD in patients with bipolar disorder.80
Thus, four of ten studies found a significantly higher rate
of BPD in patients with bipolar disorder compared with

a psychiatric control group, and three of these four pos-
itive studies were comparisons of bipolar II disorder ver-
sus major depressive disorder.

Frequency of bipolar disorder in patients with
borderline personality disorder

Twelve studies reported the frequency of bipolar disor-
der in patients with BPD (Tables III and IV). Three stud-
ies of psychiatric outpatients of mixed diagnoses and one
study of patients with a major depressive episode con-

tributed data to both this analysis as well as the previous
analysis examining the frequency of BPD in patients
with bipolar disorder.79-81,83 Most studies were of psychi-
atric outpatients, and only two were of samples of inpa-
tients.94,95 In 10 of the 12 studies it was clear that the
patients were symptomatic at the time of the evaluation,
and in the remaining two studies symptom status was
unstated.70,96 The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
IV (or DSM-III or DSM-III-R) was the most commonly
used measure to evaluate Axis I disorders, whereas there
was more heterogeneity in the measures used to diag-

nose BPD. Half of the studies examined the frequency
of both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. Two studies
reported both current and lifetime rates of bipolar dis-
order, and we included the data on lifetime rates.79,94
A difficulty in summarizing the data is that studies varied
in the breadth of their diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Only
one  study  reported  rates  of  bipolar  I,  bipolar  II,  and
cyclothymic disorder.94 Across all 12 studies, the frequency
of any bipolar disorder in the 1151 patients was 14.1%
(n=162). The largest study, by Zanarini et al,95 excluded
patients with bipolar I disorder, and the rate of any bipo-
lar disorder in this study was amongst lowest of the stud-
ies summarized in Table IV. When the results of this study
are excluded, then the rate of any bipolar disorder across
the remaining 11 studies was 16.3% (126/772). Six studies
reported rates of both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder.
Across these six studies the rate of either bipolar I or
bipolar II disorder was 19.1% (90/470).
In the nine studies of 634 patients that assessed bipolar
I disorder, the prevalence was 9.3% (n=59). In the eight
studies assessing bipolar II disorder, the prevalence was
10.1% (n=101). Limiting the analysis to the six studies
that reported the rates of both bipolar I and bipolar II
disorder, the results were the same (bipolar I disorder,
8.9%; bipolar II disorder, 10.2%). Only three studies
reported the rate of cyclothymic disorder, and across
these three studies the overall prevalence was 12.9%
(30/232). 

Co-occurrence of bipolar disorder and 
borderline personality disorder in 
nonpatient samples

To this point we have summarized studies of psychiatric
patients. Only four studies of nonpatient samples have
examined the association between bipolar disorder and
BPD. Because comorbidity may be associated with seek-
ing treatment, an examination of the degree of co-occur-
rence should examine non-treatment-seeking samples.
While there are many studies of the epidemiology of
personality disorders,97 we are aware of only four stud-
ies that reported bipolar-BPD comorbidity. 
Zimmerman and Coryell98 assessed DSM-III Axis I and
Axis II disorders in 797 first-degree relatives of healthy
controls and psychiatric patients. Trained interviewers
experienced in evaluating psychiatric patients adminis-
tered the fully structured Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(DIS)99 for Axis  I  disorders  and  the  semi-structured
SIDP for Axis II disorders. BPD was the third most fre-
quently diagnosed personality disorder in individuals
with bipolar disorder (obsessive-compulsive and antiso-
cial personality disorders were the most frequent diag-
noses). The  rate  of  BPD  was  nearly  twice  as  high  in
bipolar disorder than major depressive disorder (12.5%
vs 6.9%), though this difference was not significant. The
rate of bipolar disorder in the subjects with BPD was
15.4%, significantly higher than the rate in individuals

with no personality disorder (15.4% vs 0.9%), but not
significantly different than the rate in individuals with
any other personality disorder (7.0%). 
Swartz et al100 constructed an algorithm to approximate
the diagnosis of BPD from the DIS and examined the
prevalence of BPD and its relationship to Axis I disor-
ders in the 1541 general population participants at the
Duke University site of the Epidemiologic Catchment
Area study. The rate of DSM-III bipolar disorder was
significantly higher in subjects with BPD than without
(14.1% vs 0.5%), results that were very similar to the
findings of Zimmerman and Coryell.98
Lenzenweger et al101 directly interviewed 214 respon-
dents in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication102
with 
International  Personality  Disorder
Examination (IPDE).103 These subjects also completed
the IPDE screening questionnaire. A multiple imputa-
tion method was used to approximate the diagnosis of
BPD  in  the  NCS-R  respondents  who  completed  the
IPDE screening questionnaire but were not adminis-
tered the diagnostic interview. DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses
were  based  on  the  fully  structured  Composite
International Diagnostic Interview.104 The Axis I diag-
nostic information presented in the article focused on
diagnoses in the past year, and the data for bipolar dis-
order combined bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. The
rate of bipolar I or II disorder in subjects with BPD
(14.8%) was nearly identical to the rate reported by
Zimmerman and Coryell98 and Swartz et al100 The preva-
lence of BPD in subjects with bipolar I or bipolar II dis-
order was 15.5%. Odds ratios (OR) were computed con-
trolling  for  demographic  variables.  The  odds  ratio
between BPD and bipolar disorder (12.5) was higher
than all other odds ratios between BPD and Axis I dis-
orders except any impulse control disorder (OR=14.4)
and intermittent explosive disorder (OR=12.5). 
Grant  et  al105 conducted  face-to-face  interviews  with
approximately 35 000 participants in the second wave of
the  National  Epidemiologic  Survey  on  Alcohol  and
Related Conditions (NESARC). Diagnoses were based
on the DSM-IV version of the fully structured Alcohol
Use  Disorder  and  Associated  Disabilities  Interview
Schedule.106 The overall rate of BPD was 5.9%, higher
than the rates reported in other epidemiological sur-
veys.101,107,108 The prevalence of BPD in respondents with
a lifetime history of bipolar disorder was high (bipolar I,
35.9%; bipolar II, 26.7%). The rates were even higher
when the analyses were limited to bipolar diagnoses in

the past 12 months (bipolar I, 50.1%; bipolar II, 39.4%).
The higher rates for diagnoses based on the past year are
likely due to BPD being associated with greater chronic-
ity and recurrence of bipolar disorder episodes. The life-
time  prevalence  of  bipolar  I  and  bipolar  II  disorder
among  individuals  with  BPD  was  31.8%  and  7.7%,
respectively. Grant et al105 computed odds ratios between
BPD and the lifetime rate of 15 Axis I disorders con-
trolling for demographic variables and found that the
odds ratio was highest for bipolar I disorder (OR=9.9),
whereas for bipolar II disorder several disorders had
higher odds ratios. When the presence of other Axis I
disorders was also controlled, then lifetime diagnoses of
bipolar I and bipolar II disorder had the highest odds
ratios  with  BPD.  However,  another  report  from  the
Wave 2 assessment in the NESARC study, on the asso-
ciation between narcissistic personality disorder and
Axis I disorders raise questions about the specificity of
the  association  between  BPD  and  bipolar  disorder.
Stinson et al109 computed odds ratios between narcissis-
tic personality disorder and the lifetime rate of the same
15 Axis I disorders controlling for demographic variables
and, similar to the results of Grant et al105 on BPD, found
that the odds ratio was highest for bipolar I disorder
(OR=5.2), whereas for bipolar II disorder several disor-
ders had higher odds ratios.
To summarize the results of these four epidemiological
and quasi-epidemiological studies, three studies were
consistent  in  finding  that  approximately  15%  of  the
community respondents with BPD were diagnosed with
bipolar disorder,98,100,101 whereas the NESARC data was
an  outlier  with  a  combined  bipolar  I  and  bipolar  II
prevalence of nearly 40%.105 The NESARC study was
also an outlier in finding a higher prevalence of bipolar
disorder than other epidemiologic studies. It is not sur-
prising that significant odds ratios were found between
bipolar disorder and BPD. However, BPD was signifi-
cantly associated with other Axis I disorders as well. The
specificity of the relationship between BPD and bipolar
disorder was not clearly established. The only report of
the full range of personality disorders found that BPD
was  the  third  most  frequent  diagnosis  in  adults  with
bipolar disorder, and that the rate of bipolar disorder in
subjects with BPD was not significantly higher than the
rate  in  subjects  with  other  personality  disorders.98
However, the sample size in the study was relatively
small, and diagnoses were based on DSM-III which had
not yet officially recognized bipolar II disorder.

Summary and conclusions

The goal of this review was to examine the relationship
between  bipolar  disorder  and  BPD,  particularly  the
specificity of the relationship. While many studies have
examined comorbidity rates, particularly in psychiatric
patients, methodological considerations limit some of the
conclusions that can be drawn. 
How frequent is BPD in bipolar patients? And does this
vary by subtype of bipolar disorder? 
Across studies approximately 10% of patients with BPD
had bipolar I disorder and another 10% had bipolar II
disorder. Thus, a total of about 20% of patients with
BPD were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Likewise,
approximately 20% of bipolar II patients were diag-
nosed with BPD, though only 10% of bipolar I patients
were diagnosed with BPD. Psychiatric status at time of
assessment did not appear to have an influence on these
rates.
Most of the studies in the present review were based on
small sample sizes; only 1 of the 24 studies summarized
in Table II had a sample size greater than 100. Small
sample sizes result in large confidence intervals, and this
contributes to the wide variation in prevalence rates. The
small-scale studies typically focused on only one bipolar
disorder subtype, with only two investigators providing
information on both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. 
Much has been written about the bipolar-borderline link,
and some authors have suggested that BPD is on the
bipolar spectrum.76,110 It was therefore surprising that in
the 15 studies examining the full range of personality
disorders in patients with bipolar disorder that BPD was
the most frequent in only four studies. Obsessive-com-
pulsive and histrionic personality disorders were more
frequently the most commonly diagnosed personality
disorders. This raises questions about the specificity of
the bipolar-borderline link. However, BPD was the most
frequent personality disorder in the only two studies of
bipolar II disorder. Consistent with the stronger associ-
ation between BPD and bipolar II disorder than bipolar
I disorder, three of the four studies comparing the preva-
lence of BPD in bipolar II patients with psychiatric con-
trol groups were significant versus one of the six studies
of bipolar I or unspecified bipolar disorder.
Why is there a seemingly stronger link between bipolar
II disorder and BPD? We believe that this is primarily
related to diagnostic error. As one of us discussed else-
where, when diagnosis is based on the presence of symp-

tom episodes that occurred in the past, as is the case with
bipolar disorder in currently depressed patients, diag-
nostic clarity is sometimes elusive thereby resulting in
some false-negative as well as false-positive diagnoses.111
DSM-IV is a categorical system that provides descriptive
diagnostic criteria of psychiatric syndromes. The defini-
tion of mental disorder in DSM-IV notes that these syn-
drome  descriptions  represent  underlying  behavioral,
psychological, or biological dysfunction, albeit imperfect
representations of the potentially unknown, underlying
core  dysfunction.  The  descriptive  diagnostic  criteria
should not be considered the last word on whether a
patient has the illness in question, but instead the crite-
ria should be conceptualized as a type of test for the
underlying, etiologically-defined, illness. Accordingly, as
with any other diagnostic test, diagnoses based on the
DSM-IV criteria produce some false positive and some
false negative results. That is, some patients who meet
the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria will not have the illness
(ie, false positives), and some who do not meet the cri-
teria because their symptoms fall below the DSM-IV
diagnostic threshold, will have the illness and incorrectly
not receive the diagnosis (ie, false negatives). According
to this conceptualization, the gold standard with which
DSM-IV diagnoses  are  being  compared  is  a  not-yet-
discovered index of illness such as a biomarker. 
The  lack  of  congruence  between  phenomenological
diagnosis and underlying pathophysiology is one cause
of diagnostic error. A second cause is related to the lim-
its of the accuracy of retrospective recall and reporting.
Transient episodes of affective instability and emotional
lability associated with borderline personality disorder
might be confused with hypomanic episodes, thereby
resulting in false-positive diagnoses.33,112 This is not to sug-
gest that affective instability is pathognomonic for bor-
derline personality disorder, but rather to illustrate how
phenomenological similarities might result in diagnostic
error. This error is likely greater with bipolar II disorder
than bipolar I disorder, and we would hypothesize would
be even greater if the diagnostic thresholds for bipolar
disorder are lowered below the current DSM-IV stan-
dard. Thus, some patients diagnosed with both border-
line and bipolar II disorders are likely to have false-pos-
itive bipolar disorder diagnoses. And some likely have
false positive BPD diagnoses. In clinical practice addi-
tional sources of diagnostic error include clinical unfa-
miliarity with Axis II disorders,113 the perception that
bipolar disorder is more easily treated (thus “erring on

the side of caution”),114 the desire to protect patients
from a stigmatizing diagnosis,115 or lower reimbursement
rates for treating Axis I vs Axis II disorders.115 To us, the
question is not whether diagnostic error exists, but rather
which type of error predominates and what can be done
to reduce such errors. 
There  is  much  need  for  research  comparing  patients
with BPD to bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar II dis-
order. As noted in the introduction, few studies have
compared these groups. Moreover, the few studies that
have directly compared the two disorders have been
based on small samples and examined a limited number
of variables.84,116-120 We are not aware of any study that has
focused on depressed patients presenting for treatment
and  compared  those  who  are  diagnosed  with  either
bipolar II disorder or BPD—a clinically important dis-
tinction faced by clinicians. A direct comparison of these
two  groups  of  patients  could  identify  variables  that
would assist clinicians in making this differential diag-
nosis, and subsequently in making treatment decisions.
Similarly, few direct comparisons of patients with bipo-
lar disorder and BPD have been conducted with respect
to treatment. Even fewer include groups of patients with
comorbid bipolar disorder and BPD in their comparisons,
and those that do neglect one of the other two groups.
Similar to other studies reviewed here, existing treatment
studies suffer from small sample sizes,56,121 use unclear
diagnostic methods,122 or rely on atypical measures to
diagnose one or both disorders.123 With some exceptions,
they also largely use pharmacotherapy, typically with
medications  such  as  mood  stabilizers  that  have  been
shown to be effective for treatment of bipolar disorder.
Importantly, preferential use of medication trials neglects
the  psychosocial  and  behavior  change  interventions
inherent in treatments for BPD. More research is needed
on to what degree these disorders benefit from various
treatments relative to one another, and also on best treat-
ment practices for comorbid BPD and bipolar disorder.

An examination of comorbidity, and the specificity of
the  association,  is  informative  regarding  the  link
between BPD and the bipolar spectrum; however, the
most informative approach towards answering this ques-
tion is to compare depressed patients with and without
BPD on validators that are specific for bipolar disor-
der.124 Thus,  the  demonstration  that  compared  with
depressed patients without BPD, depressed patients with
BPD have more anxiety disorders, more substance-use
disorders, and a younger age of onset, does not support
the bipolar spectrum hypothesis because these differ-
ences would be expected for BPD as well. Instead, stud-
ies attempting to demonstrate that BPD is part of the
bipolar spectrum should focus on variables that are spe-
cific to bipolar disorder such as a family history of bipo-
lar disorder which would not be expected to be elevated
in BPD probands unless BPD was part of the bipolar
spectrum.
In the final analysis though we believe that the results
of the present review challenge the notion that BPD is
part of the bipolar spectrum. While the comorbidity
rates are substantial, each disorder is nonetheless diag-
nosed in the absence of the other in the vast majority of
cases (80% to 90%). In studies examining personality
disorders  broadly,  other  PDs  such  as  histrionic  and
obsessive-compulsive were more commonly diagnosed
in  bipolar  patients  than  was  BPD.  Although  not
reviewed here, the converse is also true: other axis I dis-
orders such as major depression, substance abuse, and
post-traumatic stress disorder are also more commonly
diagnosed in patients with BPD than is bipolar disor-
der.115 In both of these cases, rates of comorbidity alone
have not led to the argument that the disorders exist
along the same spectrum. In valid cases of co-occur-
rence, it is possible that this reflects a common etiology
where risk factors for one disorder lead to the co-occur-
rence of the other.125,126

La relación entre trastorno de personalidad
borderline y trastorno bipolar

Relation entre le trouble de personnalité 
« borderline » et la maladie bipolaire

En los pacientes que buscan un tratamiento para la
depresión es importante, clínicamente, reconocer
tanto el trastorno bipolar como el trastorno de per-
sonalidad borderline (TPB) y es primordial poder
distinguirlos. Las investigaciones que consideran
que el TPB debe ser incluido como parte del espec-
tro bipolar llegan a distintas conclusiones. Se revisó
la pregunta más estudiada acerca de la relación
entre el TPB y el trastorno bipolar: ¿cuál es su con-
cordancia diagnóstica? Entre los estudios se encon-
tró que aproximadamente el 10% de los pacientes
con TPB tenía un trastorno bipolar I y otro 10%
tenía un trastorno bipolar II. Asimismo, aproxima-
damente el 20% de los pacientes bipolares II fue
diagnosticado con TPB, en cambio sólo el 10% de
los bipolares I tuvo ese diagnóstico. A pesar de que
las cifras de comorbilidad son considerables, cada
trastorno es diagnosticado en ausencia del otro en
la gran mayoría de los casos (80% a 90%). En los
estudios que examinan en general los trastornos de
personalidad, los pacientes bipolares fueron diag-
nosticados más comúnmente con otros trastornos
de la personalidad que con el TPB. Asimismo, lo
inverso también es verdadero: otros trastornos del
eje I como la depresión mayor, el abuso de sustan-
cias y el trastorno por estrés postraumático también
fueron  diagnosticados  con  mayor  frecuencia  en
pacientes con TPB que en el trastorno bipolar. Estos
hallazgos ponen en tela de juicio la idea que el TPB
es parte del espectro bipolar.  

Il  est  important  de  reconnaître  cliniquement  le
trouble bipolaire et la personnalité « borderline »
(PBL) chez les patients demandant un traitement
antidépresseur, et de les distinguer l’un de l’autre.
Pour  la  recherche,  l’appartenance  de  la  PBL  au
cadre des troubles bipolaires a donné lieu à des
conclusions divergentes. Nous analysons la question
la  plus  étudiée  sur  la  relation  entre  la  PBL  et  le
trouble bipolaire : leur concordance diagnostique.
Dans les études, environ 10 % des patients ayant
une PBL sont atteints de trouble bipolaire I et 10 %
de trouble bipolaire II. De même, environ 20 % des
patients bipolaires II souffrent de PBL alors que seu-
lement 10 % des patients bipolaires I ont une PBL.
Les  taux  de  comorbidité  sont  importants  mais
chaque maladie est néanmoins diagnostiquée en
l’absence de l’autre dans la grande majorité des cas
(80  à  90  %).  Dans  les  études  s’intéressant  aux
troubles de la personnalité de manière plus large,
les autres troubles de la personnalité ont été plus
fréquemment diagnostiqués chez les patients bipo-
laires.  L’inverse  est  également  vrai  :  les  autres
troubles de l’axe I comme la dépression majeure, les
abus de substance et les états de stress post-trau-
matique sont plus fréquemment rencontrés chez les
patients PBL que chez les patients bipolaires. Ces
résultats remettent en question la notion de l’ap-
partenance de la PBL au cadre bipolaire.
