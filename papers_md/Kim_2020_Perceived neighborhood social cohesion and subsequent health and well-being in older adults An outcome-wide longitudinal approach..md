Abstract

Background: Growing research documents associations between neighborhood social cohesion 
with better health and well-being. However, other work has identified social cohesion’s “dark 
side” and its ability to promote negative outcomes. It remains unclear if such diverging findings 
are attributable to differences in study design, or other reasons. To better capture its potential 
heterogeneous effects, we took an outcome-wide analytic approach to examine perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion in relation to a range of health and well-being outcomes.

Methods: Data were from 12,998 participants in the Health and Retirement Study—a large, 
diverse, prospective, and nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults age >50. Multiple 
regression models evaluated if social cohesion was associated with physical health, health 
behavior, psychological well-being, psychological distress, and social well-being outcomes. All 
models adjusted for sociodemographics, personality, and numerous baseline health and well-being

characteristics. To evaluate the effects of change in cohesion, we adjusted for prior social 
cohesion. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing.

Results: Perceived neighborhood social cohesion was not associated with most physical health 
outcomes (except for reduced risk of physical functioning limitations and better self-rated health) 
nor health behavior outcomes (except for more binge drinking). However, it was associated with 
numerous subsequent psychosocial well-being (i.e., higher: positive affect, life satisfaction, 
optimism, purpose in life, mastery, health mastery, financial mastery; reduced likelihood of 
infrequent contact with friends) and psychological distress outcomes (i.e., lower depression, 
hopelessness, negative affect, loneliness) over the 4-year follow-up period.

Conclusions: With further research, these results suggest that perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion might be a valuable target for innovative policies aimed at improving well-being.

INTRODUCTION

A growing body of research suggests that higher neighborhood social cohesion is associated 
with better health and well-being outcomes. Social cohesion is characterized by: 1) the 
perceived degree of connection among neighbors, 2) the willingness of neighbors to 
intervene for the common good, 3) degree to which residents feel they belong to the area, 4) 
as well as the amount of trust that is shared among neighbors.1 Neighborhood social 
cohesion is distinct from individual-level social networks and support because it 
characterizes the whole community and impacts the entire neighborhood, regardless of an 
individual’s characteristics.2,3 It has been linked to a range of better health behaviors 
(increased physical activity, increased use of preventive health services, healthier sleep),4–8 
and better biologic functioning (reduced cardiometabolic risk and coronary artery 
calcification),9,10 reduced risk of age-related conditions (cardiovascular events and stroke),
11,12 and reduced risk of mortality.13–16 Yet, a recent review also highlights how more 
cohesive relationships can sometimes be associated with worse health and well-being 
outcomes (e.g. more smoking, drinking, and depressive symptoms)—17 depending on the 
social context. Social cohesion thus does not necessarily imply beneficial or harmful 
relations to health outcomes and may simply act as an “amplification system.”

Several hypothesized mechanisms illustrate how neighborhood social cohesion might both 
promote and harm health and well-being. Neighborhood social cohesion may promote health 
by:3,15 1) increased diffusion of information about health (e.g., where to acquire affordable 
fruits and vegetables); 2) collective ability to advocate for resources (e.g., organize and 
lobby for medical navigators who help patients navigate health systems); 3) social and 
psychological support (e.g., emotional support in times of distress); 4) maintenance of 
healthy norms through informal social control (e.g., reinforcing norms that certain behaviors 
(e.g., not smoking) is desirable and the norm). However, neighborhood social cohesion also 
has a “dark side” and can promote negative health outcomes by:17,18 1) excessively straining

group members by “requiring” them to provide support to others, 2) restricting freedom 
because of excessive informal control, 3) excluding out-group members, 4) “down-leveling” 
norms so that individuals trying to break free from negative group norms are penalized, and 
5) facilitating the “contagion” of unhealthy behaviors from negative role models and 
community leaders.17 As an illustrative example of neighborhood social cohesion’s dualistic 
nature on health outcomes, close neighbors can be a source of emotional and social support 
for one another, yet if the exchange of support occurs in social contexts where there is 
smoking and/or excessive consumption of unhealthy foods and alcohol, the impact of 
neighborhood social cohesion on health and well-being outcomes may be both positive and 
negative.

The underlying reasons for diverging past results remain unclear, but might be due to truly 
diverging results (as described in the theories and example just described), or due to 
methodological differences (e.g., 1) different study designs (e.g., cross-sectional vs. 
longitudinal data), 2) different populations, 3) control for different numbers and types of 
confounders, 4) key underlying moderators that have not been addressed, 5) because effects 
are different on different outcomes, and 6) the use of a wide array of different measures of 
the exposure (e.g., social cohesion vs. social capital measures which are related but distinct 
constructs, measures of neighborhood social cohesion that are aggregated together by 
neighborhood vs. individual-level perceptions of neighborhood social cohesion).

Further, we build upon past neighborhood social cohesion research by using a 
complementary measure that shifts the focus from the group-level to the individual-level. 
Most neighborhood social cohesion research has focused on an aggregated group-level 
measure of neighborhoods and there are several benefits to this approach. However, there are 
also several benefits to examining neighborhood cohesion at the individual-level and 
triangulating findings. For example, the contours of a neighborhood are often difficult to 
identify and are typically identified by researchers that use census tract-, census-block, or 
Zip-code data; these artificially drawn boundaries often differ from a resident’s perception 
of his or her own neighborhood boundaries.1,2 Thus, misidentifying neighborhoods and 
clustering together study participants who do not consider themselves neighbors, could skew 
results. Additionally, some past work has observed that neighborhood-level social cohesion 
has poor inter-resident agreement among inhabits of the same neighborhood.2,19 Further, 
aggregated neighborhood-level data would have required a larger number of study 
participants in each neighborhood than was available in our sample. Additionally, due to 
privacy concerns, researchers are unable to publish results use data more granular than broad 
geographic regions when using the dataset that we used (i.e., the Health and Retirement 
Study). On the basis of conceptual grounds, practical limitations, and the merits of 
supplementing one type of focus (group-level) with another justifiable focus (individual-
level) that could help triangulate findings, we named our exposure perceived neighborhood 
social cohesion to indicate that we were evaluating neighborhood social cohesion at the 
individual-, rather than the group-level.

To better understand the association between perceived neighborhood social cohesion with 
health and well-being outcomes from a more holistic point of view, we used a new outcome-
wide analytic approach,20,21 and performed analyses to examine whether positive change in

perceived neighborhood social cohesion was associated with better subsequent health and 
well-being across 35 separate outcomes in a large, prospective, and nationally representative 
sample of older adults. This outcome-wide analytic approach is particularly advantageous 
for exposures like perceived neighborhood social cohesion, because it is equipped to 
holistically capture potential heterogenous effects across a range of outcomes using a 
standardized: 1) study design, 2) population, 3) set of covariates, and 4) exposure. Further, 
by controlling for perceived neighborhood social cohesion in the prior wave, this adjustment 
allows researchers to ask a different question that is particularly important in this era of 
translational research, how might changes in perceived neighborhood social cohesion 
(“incidence”) affect subsequent health and well-being outcomes. This question allows us to 
better estimate the health and well-being outcomes we might expect to observe if perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion was intervened upon via policies.20,21

METHODS

Study Population

Data were from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) which is a prospective and 
nationally representative panel study of U.S. adults (aged >50 years). It surveys participants 
every two years and starting in 2006, HRS study staff randomly selected 50% of HRS 
participants and began visiting them for enhanced face-to-face (EFTF) interviews. The other 
50% of study participants were assessed in the following wave (2008).22 After the EFTF 
interview, HRS study staff left a self-administered psychosocial questionnaire,23 which 
participants completed and returned by mail to HRS. The response rate for this questionnaire 
was 88% in 2006 and 84% in 2008.23 We combined data from both timepoints and 
considered 2006/2008 as the wave prior to the exposure for the current study; this was the 
wave in which covariates were measured, so that all covariates were assessed prior to the 
exposure.20,21 The primary exposure variable was perceived neighborhood social cohesion, 
which was assessed in the next available wave four years later (2010/2012); in the present 
study we only included those participants who responded in this wave. Further, all the 
outcomes were assessed four years later in 2014/2016. The present study used de-identified 
and publicly available data, thus the IRB at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health 
exempted it from review.

Perceived Neighborhood Social Cohesion.—This exposure variable was assessed 
using a 4-item scale that was developed and tested in two nationally representative studies of 
older adults (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and HRS).23 The items were derived 
from widely used neighborhood social cohesion scales that were previously validated.
4,19,24,25 It assessed the extent to which participants perceived their neighborhoods as 
trusting and socially cohesive. On a 7-point Likert scale, study participants indicated the 
degree to which they endorsed these four items: 1) “I really feel part of this area,” 2) “If you 
were in trouble, there are lots of people in this area who would help you,” 3) “Most people 
in this area can be trusted,” and 4) “Most people in this area are friendly.” The negatively 
worded items were reverse coded, so that higher scores reflected higher levels of cohesion 
and then they were all averaged together (Cronbach’s α = 0.86). Following HRS protocol,

scores were only calculated if participants completed ≥2 items. Finally, to examine threshold 
effects, we created tertiles based on the distribution of perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion scores in the sample.

Covariates.—Covariates included: sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity 
(White, Black, Hispanic, Other), marital status (married/not married), income (<$50,000, 
$50,000 – $74,999, $75 000–$99,999, ≥$100,000), total wealth (quintiles of the score 
distribution in this sample), educational attainment (no degree, GED/high school diploma, 
≥college degree), employment (yes/no), health insurance (yes/no), geographic region 
(Northeast, Midwest, South, West)), religious service attendance (none, <1x a week, ≥1 
more per week), personality factors (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, 
agreeableness, neuroticism), and childhood abuse (yes/no). Additionally, to reduce the 
likelihood of reverse causation, we also controlled for prior values of all the outcomes 
variables in our models (in 2006/2008).20 The HRS guides and appendix (Supplementary 
Text 1) provide additional information about each of these covariate assessments.22,23,26,27 
Further, to evaluate changes in perceived neighborhood social cohesion (conditional on the 
past), we controlled for perceived neighborhood social cohesion in the prior wave 
(2006/2008).28

Outcomes.—We considered 35 outcomes in 2014/2016 (t2), including dimensions of 
physical health factors (all-cause mortality, number of chronic conditions, diabetes, 
hypertension, stroke, cancer, lung disease, arthritis, overweight/obesity, physical functioning 
limitations, cognitive impairment, chronic pain, and self-rated health), health behaviors 
(binge drinking, smoking, physical activity, and sleep problems), psychological well-being 
(positive affect, life satisfaction, optimism, purpose in life, mastery, health mastery, and 
financial mastery), psychological distress (depression, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, 
negative affect, and perceived constraints) and social factors (loneliness, living with spouse/
partner, frequency of contact with: children, other family, or friends—each assessed 
separately). The HRS guides (and Supplementary Text 1) provide further details about each 
assessment

Statistical Analysis

We examined each outcome in separate models, adjusting for all covariates. For each binary 
outcome with a prevalence of <10%, we ran logistic regression models. For each binary 
outcome with a prevalence ≥10%, we ran generalized linear models with a log link and 
Poisson distribution; we used this method for non-rare outcomes (i.e., ≥10%) in order to 
enhance the interpretability of our results. People intuitively interpret relative risks, and odds 
ratios generated from logistic regression approximate relative risks when the prevalence of 
an outcome is <10%. However, as the prevalence of an outcome rises above 10%, the odds 
ratio that are generated by logistic regression deviate progressively further and further away 
from relative risks and readers often misinterpret findings.

Finally, for each continuous outcome, we ran linear regression models. For each continuous 
outcome measure, we standardized each outcome (mean=0, standard deviation=1) so their 
effect size could be interpreted as a standard deviation change in the outcome. In our tables,

we marked multiple p-value cutoffs because this is an active and evolving area of research, 
and readers can decide which values to interpret: p<0.05, p<0.01, or a Bonferroni correction 
to account for multiple testing (p=0.05/35 outcomes= p<0.001).

We used an outcome-wide analytic approach, which features several analytic decisions not 
widely used in disciplines outside of biostatistics and causal inference. Thus, we further 
summarize the analyses here. First, if covariates are assessed at the same timepoint as the 
exposure (2010/2012), it remains unclear if the covariates are confounders or mediators; 
thus, we adjust for covariates in the prior wave (2006/2008) which helps reduce this worry 
and also allows for a very rich set of control variables to help address confounding. Second, 
we adjust for all outcome variables in the prior wave (2006/2008) in each model to reduce 
potential reverse causality. We also further adjust for a wide range of other covariates to 
adjust for potential confounding variables. Third, to evaluate “change” in perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion we adjust for perceived neighborhood social cohesion in the 
prior wave (2006/2008). This helps us “hold constant” prior levels of perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion. Those who are in the highest perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion tertile in prior wave (2006/2008) and continue being in that group in the baseline 
wave (2010/2012) contribute to the final estimate. However, the estimate produced from this 
analysis also corresponds to people in our sample who were in the lowest perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion tertile in 2006/2008 and move to the highest perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion tertile in 2010/2012. The model effectively assumes that the 
coefficient for the highest perceived neighborhood social cohesion tertile is constant across 
past perceived neighborhood social cohesion levels (i.e. no interaction between past and 
current perceived neighborhood social cohesion). Thus, based on our model we are able to 
evaluate how change in perceived neighborhood social cohesion (between 2006/2008 and 
2010/2012), is associated with subsequent health and well-being outcomes (at 2014/2016; 
see Supplementary Text 2 for proof). Controlling for prior perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion levels (2006/2008) also has several other advantages including, helping reduce risk 
of reverse causality by “removing” the potential accumulating effects that perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion might have already had on health and well-being outcomes in 
the past (“prevalent exposure”), and allowing us to instead focus on the effects of change in 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion (“incident exposure”) on outcomes.

Secondary analyses.—We ran several secondary analyses. First, we re-analyzed all the 
models using only complete-cases. Next, to evaluate how similar our results were to past 
research, we re-analyzed all models using a reduced list of covariates (e.g., 
sociodemographic factors) which are more conventionally controlled for in the social and 
behavioral sciences (e.g., sociodemographic factors). This analytic approach asks a different 
question: what are the potential long-term cumulative effects that perceived neighborhood 
social cohesion has on the outcomes. Third, to evaluate the robustness of our results, we 
conducted E-value analyses to assess the minimum strength of association (on the risk ratio 
scale) that an unmeasured confounder would have to have with the both the exposure and 
outcome, to explain away any associations that we observed.39 Fourth, we re-analyzed the 
fully adjusted models and removed participants with any history of a given condition at

baseline (e.g., for lung disease analyses, removed participants with any history lung disease 
of lung disease).

Multiple imputation.—Because multiple imputation often provides a more flexible 
approach for obtaining estimates of association than most other methods of handling missing 
data, we imputed all missing exposure, covariate, and outcome data using an imputation by 
chained equations procedure (and generated five datasets).29–32 When imputing, we used an 
inclusive as opposed to restrictive use of auxiliary items for each variable with missing data,
33 and estimates of models were multiple imputation estimates derived using the combining 
rules defined by Little and Rubin.34 Analyses were conducted in Stata version 15.1 
(StataCorp, College Station, Texas).

At the wave in which the covariates were assessed (prior wave), the average age of 
respondents was 66 years old (SD = 10) and they were primarily women (59%), married 
(67%), with a high school education (55%). Table 1 describes the distribution of covariates 
by tertiles of perceived neighborhood social cohesion. Table S1 describes the change in 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion from the prior wave to the baseline wave.

Over the 4-year follow-up period, there was little or no evidence of association between 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion and most physical health outcomes, including: 
number of chronic conditions, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer, heart disease, lung 
disease, arthritis, overweight/obesity, and chronic pain. However, there were some 
curvilinear associations where people in the middle tertile of neighborhood cohesion (versus 
people in the lowest tertile), conditional on prior perceived neighborhood social cohesion, 
had better health (i.e., a 15% reduced risk of mortality (95% confidence interval [CI] for RR: 
0.74, 0.98, 8% reduced risk of physical functioning limitations (95%, CI: 0.85, 1.00), and 
11% reduced risk of cognitive impairment (95%, CI: 0.81, 0.98). However, there was no 
association for these health outcomes when comparing the highest versus lowest tertile of 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion. When considering health behaviors, participants in 
the highest tertile of perceived neighborhood social cohesion (versus lowest tertile), 
conditional on prior perceived neighborhood social cohesion, subsequently had 43% 
increased risk of binge drinking (95%, CI: 1.08, 1.87), but there was no association with 
smoking, physical activity, or sleep problems (Table 2).

Perceived neighborhood social cohesion was associated with nearly all of the psychological 
well-being, psychological distress, and social well-being factors. For example, those in the 
highest tertile of perceived neighborhood social cohesion (compared to those in the lowest 
tertile) conditional on prior perceived neighborhood social cohesion, subsequently reported 
higher life satisfaction (β=0.15, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.20) and mastery (β=0.13, 95% CI: 0.06, 
0.19), as well as a lower negative affect (β=−0.17, 95% CI: −0.25, −0.09) and loneliness (β=
−0.21, 95% CI: −0.28, −0.13). Finally, those in the highest perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion tertile also had 22% reduced risk of depression (95%, CI: 0.67, 0.90; Table 2).

Additional Analyses

Page 8

We conducted several additional analyses. First, when comparing results from complete-case 
analyses versus results from the main multiply imputed analyses—results were very similar 
(Table S2). Second, conventionally-adjusted covariate models generally showed results that 
were stronger than the fully adjusted models, and are in line with past work (Table S3). 
Finally, we calculated E-values and they suggested that a few of the observed associations 
were at least moderately robust to unmeasured confounding (Table 3). For example, an 
unmeasured confounder would have to be associated with both perceived neighborhood 
social cohesion and life satisfaction by risk ratios of 1.57 each (above and beyond the large 
range of covariates already adjusted for) to explain away the association; further, to shift the 
CI to include the null, an unmeasured confounder would have to be associated with both 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion and life satisfaction by risk ratios of 1.44. Fourth, 
removing anyone with history of a given condition at baseline in the fully adjusted physical 
health models, resulted in estimates that displayed larger magnitudes of association between 
the exposure and outcomes (Table S3).

DISCUSSION

Summary of Findings

In a prospective and nationally representative sample of U.S. adults aged >50, we observed 
that higher baseline perceived neighborhood social cohesion, conditional on prior perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion, was not associated with most of the physical health outcomes 
in a graded manner (e.g., number of chronic conditions, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, 
cancer, heart disease, lung disease, arthritis, overweight/obesity, or chronic pain) nor most of 
the health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, sleep). However, there was evidence for an 
association with increased binge drinking. Further, perceived neighborhood social cohesion, 
conditional on prior perceived neighborhood social cohesion, was associated with nearly all 
of the psychosocial outcomes (e.g., higher life satisfaction and lower hopelessness). For 
some outcomes (i.e., mortality, physical functioning limitations, and cognitive impairment) 
we observed curvilinear associations where people in the middle tertile of perceived 
neighborhood cohesion (versus people in the lowest tertile), had reduced risk of these 
outcomes—but this association was not apparent when comparing people in the highest 
versus lowest tertile. All results were maintained after robust control for a wide range of 
potential confounders including sociodemographic, physical health, behavioral, 
psychological, and social factors at baseline—as well as control for perceived neighborhood 
social cohesion (and all the outcomes) in the prior wave.

Results in the Context of Past Research

By controlling for perceived neighborhood social cohesion in the prior wave, we were able 
to evaluate changes in perceived neighborhood social cohesion (conditional on prior 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion) which “differences out” the potential accumulating 
effects that past perceived neighborhood social cohesion has on health over the life course. 
From a public health or intervention perspective, these are the types of results that are often 
of more relevance and interest. Our results both converge and diverge with past work that 
has evaluated associations between the “prevalence” of neighborhood social cohesion with

health and well-being outcomes. For example, in line with past research, we observed that 
“incident” neighborhood social cohesion was associated with better psychosocial outcomes. 
Although more research with different methods are needed, our results extend past findings 
by providing preliminary evidence of what outcomes we might observe if perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion was intervened upon. We also observed that perceived 
neighborhood social cohesion was associated with higher levels of binge drinking. These 
results are in line with some previous reports that bring light to the potential “dark side” of 
social cohesion,17 but not other reports.5,6,35,36 Methodologically, the underlying reasons for 
diverging results between our study and past studies may stem from a variety of sources 
including differences in: 1) study design (e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal), 2) 
measurement of the outcome (some studies evaluated specific cardiovascular conditions, 
while others used composite measures), 3) measurement of the exposure, 4) sample (our 
study sample consists of an older population than many past studies), 5) key underlying 
moderators, 6) covariate control, 7) control for prior perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion. Our secondary analyses addressed the last two points and we observed that when 
controlling for a conventional set of covariates, that included only sociodemographic factors, 
the magnitude of associations between perceived neighborhood social cohesion with health 
and well-being outcomes was stronger.

Further, our findings illustrate how perceived neighborhood social cohesion could 
simultaneously influence health and well-being in both positive and negative directions; 
these findings mirror the patterns observed in other social factors, like retirement, which 
have both positive and negative effects on outcomes.37,38 When interpreting the pattern of 
our outcome-wide analyses results through the same lens, a plausible scenario is that 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion might foster neighborhoods that provide emotional 
and social support for its members, thus enhancing psychosocial health, but also provide 
contexts for the sharing of unhealthy behaviors such as the consumption of excessive 
alcohol. Such dueling mechanisms with opposite effects on mechanistic biopsychosocial 
pathways to health may cancel each other out, ultimately resulting in no substantive change 
in some physical health outcomes or curvilinear effects in others (i.e. mortality, physical 
functioning limitations, cognitive impairment).

There are at least three further reasons why we might have observed a lack of association 
between perceived neighborhood social cohesion and physical health outcomes. First, an 
array of social forces, beyond neighborhood social cohesion, converge to powerfully pattern 
and influence the trajectory of people’s physical health over the life-course (e.g., 
developmental and life-course perspective factors, socioeconomic stratification, 
discrimination, workplace factors, social networks, religious organization, civic groups, etc). 
The average age of respondents in our study was 66 years (SD = 10), thus these social forces 
might have already exerted a powerful influence on people’s bodies by the time they are 66 
years old, and a 4-year follow-up period might not be long enough to evaluate the effect that 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion alone might have on physical health outcomes. 
Second, unlike most prior studies on this topic, we controlled for a much larger array of 
covariates in an attempt to isolate the unique effect of perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion on outcomes. When controlling for this robust array of covariates we did not 
observe associations with physical health outcomes, but we did see stronger effect estimates

with physical health outcomes when only controlling for conventional covariates (Table S3). 
Thus, the robust array of covariates we controlled for might help explain the null physical 
health findings we observed. Third, although data on incidence of chronic conditions was 
captured by HRS, causes of death were not. Therefore, a study participant could have been 
free of heart disease their entire life but died suddenly from heart disease and such 
information was not officially captured. HRS collects information about some causes of 
death but the categories do not map cleanly onto the chronic condition categories that we 
evaluated; thus, we did not create composite variables capturing both incidence-of-disease 
and death-due-to-disease (see Supplementary Text 3 for further details).

Limitations and Strengths

Our study had several limitations. In some studies, neighborhood social cohesion is 
examined at the aggregated neighborhood-level using multi-level modeling. However, this 
requires a nested study design with many residents clustered in many neighborhoods, which 
was not available in our sample. Thus, our study focused on people’s perceptions of their 
neighborhood’s social cohesion at the individual-level. Self-report bias and common method 
bias are both potential limitations, as both perceived neighborhood social cohesion and all 
the outcomes were self-reported. However, we controlled for a wide range of psychosocial 
variables (N=22) that could potentially dampen the potential effects of self-report and 
common method bias (e.g., Big-5 personality factors, dimensions of psychological distress 
(e.g., depressive symptoms, hopelessness) and well-being (e.g., optimism positive affect)). 
Moreover, we controlled for baseline outcomes, which itself largely (though not entirely) 
reduces this problem since the associations are then effectively with changes in the 
psychological outcome, rather than cross-sectional associations in which these issues are 
indeed more problematic. Future studies, should use objectively assessed physical and 
behavioral health outcomes to help address these limitations. Confounding by unmeasured 
variables and reverse causality is a major concern in most observational research. However, 
control for a large range of variables, the prospective nature of our data, and results from E-
value analyses helps attenuate these concerns.

Our study also has a number of strengths including the use of a prospective and diverse 
dataset. Additionally, we used a nationally representative dataset of peopled aged >50, 
which reduces the risk of selection bias. The study also adjusted for prior values of the 
exposure, covariates, and outcomes which allowed us to evaluate “incident exposure” rather 
than “prevalent exposure.” This focus on incidence provides evidence for a different 
question that is often of more interest to policy-makers.28,39,40

To adequately meet the needs of our rapidly growing older adult population, a 
comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort is needed. Although important, focusing too 
much attention and resources at individual-level interventions and policies diverts limited 
resources away from key stressors and resilience factors that emerge at higher levels (e.g., 
neighborhood level). If research continues documenting positive associations between 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion and healthier psychosocial outcomes, a potential 
next step is to test whether policy interventions that bolster the social infrastructure and

cohesion of neighborhoods translate into better psychosocial outcomes. However, it would 
also be important to examine the feasibility of changing social cohesion and its effects 
compared to other possible community-level interventions; further, caution and attention is 
needed to track and manage the potential “dark side” of perceived neighborhood social 
cohesion. Such studies may demonstrate novel and scalable methods of population-health 
interventions that enhance the well-being of our rapidly growing older adult population.

See VanderWeele and Ding (2017) for the formula for calculating E-values.

b

The E-values for effect estimates are the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to 
have with both the exposure and the outcome to fully explain away the observed association between the exposure and outcome, conditional on the 
measured covariates.

c

The E-values for the limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) closest to the null denote the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale 
that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to shift the confidence interval to include the null 
value, conditional on the measured covariates.
