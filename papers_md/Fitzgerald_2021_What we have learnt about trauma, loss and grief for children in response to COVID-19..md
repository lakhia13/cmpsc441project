The disruption of daily life resulting from COVID-19 and its precautions has taken an enormous emo-
tional toll on children and families. The consequences of disrupted schooling, changed social interactions
and altered family dynamics has had some unanticipated positives such as improved on-line educational
upskilling and personal resilience. However, the potential longer term implications for educational out-
comes, economic impacts of job loss and prolonged ﬁnancial insecurity, physical wellbeing and mental
health remain unclear. The potential for post-traumatic stress disorders from what is experienced by chil-
dren with imposed isolation from friends and extended family, domestic violence and death of relatives
remains concerning. Confronting images and stories relayed through social media and the popular press
will challenge children’s views of safety, security, trust and potentially rob them of much of the innocence
of youth. In an overwhelming global response to the ‘‘adult” problems of the COVID-19 pandemic, this
article reﬂects on the consequences of trauma, loss and grief through the perspective of children and
how they may alter their view of the world.

INTRODUCTION

Life is seldom predictable, but less so in the midst of a pan-
demic. Situations and livelihoods for adults change quickly, and
often traumatically, with diverse effects upon the physical and
mental wellbeing of children and families. Many of these abrupt

changes are challenging and bring with them both predictable
physical and nutritional problems as well as the less obvious emo-
tional consequences. Food security is a problem across the globe,
exacerbated by COVID-19 with its interruption of the schooling
programme. School is a sanctuary where education is delivered
as well as where so many children receive their most reliable nutri-
tion, enjoy protection from the threat of daytime domestic violence
and build companionship and resilience [1].

Many of the emotional consequences of COVID-19 within fam-
ilies have been exacerbated by the precautions of social distancing,

school closures and community lockdowns. These have impacted
upon mental health, which has been shown to be disproportion-
ately worse for younger rather than older children, female parents
and unmarried parents [2]. In this US study, 25% of parents and 14%
of children had worsening mental health or behavioural problems
during the ﬁrst three months of the pandemic between March and
June 2020. Building on this is the observation that disruption to
routines is detrimental for children, especially those with pre-
existing behavioural problems [3]. The changing emotional
dynamic of COVID-19 and its impact upon families can be consid-
ered as children suffer trauma, experience loss and endure grief in
everyday aspects of their lives.

TRAUMA

Symptoms of trauma

Children’s responses to trauma are varied, but the manifesta-
tions of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can follow a
single traumatic event or prolonged trauma, are well-known [4]
and can include:

(cid:1) Reliving the event over and over in thought or in play or at

night-time
(cid:1) Nightmares
(cid:1) Sleep problems: difﬁculty getting off to sleep or early waking
(cid:1) Enuresis
(cid:1) Irritability and angry outbursts
(cid:1) Lack of positive emotions
(cid:1) Intense ongoing fear or sadness
(cid:1) Acting helpless, hopeless or withdrawn
(cid:1) Feeling numb

Behaviour problems at home and school, including violence
with siblings, parents or peers, may be a response to trauma,
including trauma resulting from COVID-19. A history should try
to elicit symptoms of PTSD, but also triggers that are unlikely to
be revealed without sensitive enquiry such as emotional, physical
or sexual abuse at home or elsewhere and bullying at school, which
may be directly or indirectly linked to COVID-19.

Trauma and school closures

School closures as a response to COVID-19 are traumatic for
children [5] and are arguably often an over-reaction, given that
children are less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection than
adults [6]. School closures stop children seeing their friends in per-
son, an important source of mental health support. Having
schoolchildren at home puts stress on families and increases the
risk of domestic violence.

Sarah Jannat Iqbal, an 11-year-old student from Shefﬁeld, UK
designed and conducted an online survey via Google Forms, com-
prising 15 questions on the social, emotional, physical health and
educational impacts of the lockdown and the COVID-19 situation
on children and adolescents [7]. The survey, distributed via teach-
ers and social media between April and May 2020, was completed
by 162 students age 5–15 (60% female). Sarah found that 98% of
children and adolescents were conﬁned to the house during lock-
down, 90% with one or both parents; 82% indicated socially miss-
ing friends and relatives during the time of the lockdown and
43% stayed in touch by phone or social media. Regarding mental
health, 72% indicated they were ‘‘concerned or worried”, 13% were
scared, although 15% were not bothered by the situation. Most
(75%) were worried they, their family or friends would get ill from
coronavirus, and 31% worried about dying as a result. There were

signiﬁcant impacts on physical health behaviours, with 47% of
young people engaging in no or minimal exercise, 55% snacking
more than usual and 24% having gained weight. Most (93%) stated
their daily screen time had increased, for educational or entertain-
ment purposes, or both; 88% felt the lockdown affected their edu-
cation, despite receiving home or online education. Among those
sitting exams, 72% were concerned, worried or sad, but 28% were
happy not to be experiencing exam stress [7].

While school closures are traumatic in resource-rich countries,
their effect is considerably greater in low-income countries, where
school is an important source of nutrition for many children [8].

Since the beginning of the pandemic, an estimated 1.6 billion
children in 199 countries have been affected by school closures,
while nearly 370 million children in 150 countries did not receive
a school meal [8]. Girls are at greater risk of not being sent to
school or of being taken out of school early, which may not only
impair their nutrition and health, but that of their own children
[5]. Well-designed school feeding programmes can mitigate early
growth failure and allow catch-up, so effective school meal
schemes are essential as schools re-open in order to correct the
deprivation children experience during closures and to provide
an incentive for parents to send their children, especially girls, to
school [5].

Child abuse

The available evidence shows that restrictive measures taken to
contain the COVID-19 pandemic have been accompanied by
increased violence against children and women in both resource-
rich [9,10] and resource-poor countries [11]. Calls to child help-
lines have risen markedly during the pandemic in most but not
all countries. It is expected that girls will be at particularly high
risk of child marriage due to loss of livelihoods and at increased
risk for trafﬁcking [9].

Children in institutional care or on the streets

It is important not to forget the needs of the many children
across the world that live outside of family care. Children who live
on the streets will face special challenges during COVID-19, espe-
cially when the national response includes isolation and physical
distancing. Other children may be placed in a variety of forms of
institutional care, from large orphanages to group homes [9].
Despite global efforts to provide such children with family care
and reintegrate them into families, the COVID-19 pandemic may
have a profound adverse effect on their situation. The needs of chil-
dren outside of family care must be included in child-sensitive
responses to the crisis [9].

Conﬂict

The pandemic has compounded the already disadvantaged situ-

ations of children in areas affected by conﬂict.

Pregnancy and infancy

The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on preg-
nancy, early childhood and parenthood. Pregnant women and their
families are experiencing substantial uncertainty and anxiety, with
social isolation measures removing them from support structures
[12]. Reduced access to antenatal care and fear of healthcare facil-
ities suggest risks of unsafe delivery, low immunisation coverage
and late detection and treatment of children with developmental
difﬁculties. In some countries, newborn infants of women with
COVID-19 are being separated from their mothers for up to two
weeks’ isolation/quarantine. Given the extremely low risk infants

face of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus, or developing symp-
toms if infected, this is unnecessary and will interfere with breast-
feeding and attachment, so important for child and adolescent
development.

Mental health

While the COVID-19 pandemic can negatively affect youth
mental health, this is a particular problem for children and adoles-
cents with prior mental health issues, many of whom will need
extra support which they may struggle to get [7].

Positives

Some youth from a high-income country with COVID-19, the

UK, have described positives of the COVID-19 lockdown [7]:

(cid:1) Improved life circumstances, e.g. new job, new relationship,

changed home arrangements

(cid:1) Coping mechanisms: learnt as a result of previous lockdowns
(cid:1) Improved school support
(cid:1) Structure provided by school or work: feeling productive and

accountable

(cid:1) Mental health support: some cited support received as a result

of lockdown

LOSS

Dealing with loss is an important aspect of maturation from
childhood to adulthood, as it builds resilience. It is a skill that is
typically gained gradually through life experience. Abrupt traumas,
such as may occur as a consequence of the pandemic, or indeed in
response to the precautions designed to mitigate the anticipated
but unrealised consequences of the pandemic, may cause losses
that are harder to accept and bring with them lifelong conse-
quences. Losses may be primary such as death and major life
changes or secondary, where they may be more covert initially
but manifest consequences in time, such as the loss of companion-
ship and altered family dynamics [13].

Loss of loved ones

An untimely death of a parent, sibling or grandparent can be
particularly confronting for a child, especially if they are struggling
to comprehend the ravages of the pandemic across the globe. Addi-
tionally, the threat of death in elderly relatives who live remotely
provides an ongoing source of stress to families in the setting of
fear of infection. Death is a painful experience for the whole family,
exacerbated by the quarantining restrictions and the inability to
have contact in the ﬁnal days, provide comfort, say good-byes, be
able to attend funerals and provide mutual support to grieving
friends and relatives [14]

Loss of parental work

Economic adversity is recognised as a precursor to harsh par-
enting [15] and parental depression is predictive of harsh parent-
ing [16]. A history of child abuse is predictive of further child
abuse as seen in one on-line questionnaire study of 342 American
parents which reported that the odds of being psychologically mal-
treated (parental belittling, ridiculing and threatening harm) and
physically abused (corporal punishment or assault) during the
pandemic were 112 and 20 times higher respectively among Amer-
ican children who were maltreated in the year prior to the pan-
demic [17]. Parents who lost their jobs were 5 times more likely
to be depressed in the same study. Coupled with school closures

and community lockdowns, the disruption to lives from unantici-
pated unemployment brought heightened stress and economic
instability resulting in an increased risk of domestic violence and
child abuse. The loss of parental work due to the pandemic is a
major risk factor for child maltreatment, which has been associ-
ated with impairments in psychological, behavioural and physio-
logical functioning throughout life [18].

Loss of routine activities

The pandemic has brought a loss of normalcy. Children and ado-
lescents respond well to structure in their lives as it brings famil-
iarity, enjoyment, reassurance and a sense of expectation that
allows them to feel comfortable and safe [19]. That structure is evi-
dent within their families and the activities that they undertake
such as day care, school, sport and recreation. Whilst the prompt
response of educators, with little experience and support, to pro-
vide on-line learning resources was admirable, the adequacy of
the experience for students and their families was variable [20],
inequities in technology availability exist [21] and the knowledge
retention is yet to be well assessed [22]. The loss of organised
sporting competitions and training opportunities was challenging
for many children as they missed socialising as well as the beneﬁts
of exercise for physical and mental health wellbeing [23].

Loss of presumed safety

For many children, a sense of optimism pervades their outlook
on life which is built upon love, support and a secure, nurturing
environment [24]. This has been lost with the invisible threat of
the COVID-19 virus, its lethal potential, its highly infectious nature
and the frequency of asymptomatic infection evident especially in
children. The impact is to make the world seem unpredictable and
unjust [14]. Anxious family members, especially parents may
express their heightened fears and insecurities. Their children, pos-
sibly with an anxious disposition themselves and seeing media
reports, may ﬁnd this exaggerates their sense of vulnerability in
the setting of the pandemic. Parental fears may prove overwhelm-
ing and compromise their ability to recognise distress in their own
children which may manifest as challenging externalising beha-
viours rather than more typical sadness or worried responses [25].

Loss of autonomy

The loss of freedom to do as one wishes can lead to losses of
relationships and social support [13]. Peer friendships are impor-
tant for emotional growth in children [26]. Social distancing min-
intimacy [13]. The ability to
imises emotional and physical
communicate comfortably however involves the opportunity to
relate to people of all ages and this is considerably curtailed with
a lack of direct social engagement within the community. On-
line interactions with educators, friends and relatives are a com-
promise but lack the spontaneity, enjoyment and intimacy of the
embrace of a friend or relative or the togetherness of an extended
family celebration. The loss of childcare by relatives creates a phys-
ical, emotional and economic loss to families of young children in
many parts of the world. Visiting friends and extended families
when on vacation, and indeed the ability to travel locally or inter-
nationally to visit friends and relatives, has been particularly emo-
tionally challenging for many families [27]. Overseas travel had
become far more affordable and accessible for many families and,
with its abrupt loss and limitation likely to persist for some years,
this will provide many children and families with a sense of unease
during this time.

Loss of celebrations and group gatherings

Childhood should be happy and supportive. Coming to appreci-
ate who one is during childhood and adolescence emanates from a
sense of identity within one’s family, among friends and relatives.
Central to this within a family is an appreciation of the importance
of celebrating life events such as birthdays, weddings, baptisms
and indeed funerals. Within a community this may reﬂect religious
practices such as attending church, attending school, playing sport
or simply exercising in the local park. Social distancing and com-
munity lockdowns removed this for lengthy periods of time.
Beyond the immediate frustrations of restricted social interactions,
the psychological implications in terms of anxiety, altered social
cohesion and friendship disruption remain uncertain, especially
with more vulnerable members of society with pre-existing mental
health problems [28].

Gains to counterbalance the losses

Any consideration of loss must be juxtaposed against an appre-
ciation of positives to emerge from the ravages of COVID-19. The
losses outlined have highlighted the importance of relationships
with family and friends in the local community, working collabora-
tively across the nation and with the international community. Cri-
sis brings a unity of purpose and generally a desire to help others.
Some examples of the upside of our experiences to date with
COVID-19 are listed in Table 1.

GRIEF

An international grief observed and a nostalgia for what has not yet
been

We have seen across the globe in the last 12 months the threat
we cannot avoid, the harm that is hurting us now, the sense we
cannot make, people we cannot rescue and the difﬁculty of ﬁnding
a clear path out. This is the essence of trauma both personal and
vicarious. We have bid farewell to the normalcy of past freedoms,
found unfamiliar comforts and unwanted conﬂicts in the closeness
of lockdowns. It is clear there have been major losses, whatever
gains, and a clariﬁcation of inequity which cannot now be unseen.
The heaviness, hardship, burden, sorrow, sense of grievance and
protest that the world is what it is, which characterise grief, slowly
continue to transition into the acceptance of what has happened.
For some, things are much better and for many, much worse. For
some trauma, loss and death have touched personally and for
others these are other people’s problems and beyond our circle
of empathic reach. For those whose empathic horizon reaches fur-
ther, especially children and young people, watching harrowing

Some unexpected positives to emerge from COVID precautions and restrictions.

scenes in other countries in the media, countries with poor leader-
ship and poor services, has been a grief observed with no meaning-
ful possible response.

This remote grief becomes more immediate [29–31]. A virtual
experience, even for many medical and nursing staff, has become
more visceral. A grief that in the modern developed world seemed
often at the edges, associated with old age, preventable, happening
to others has become menacing and more real. Grief falters for-
ward toward acceptance and the reality it faces for a society that
sees death as ﬁctional and virtual
instead of irrevocable and
ineradicable. The loss of family members, especially the elderly,
has highlighted a guilty grief that has devalued its elders, not
counted their passing, but believed their time had come whether
they thought so or not. The poor quality of aged care, care for the
disabled, the mentally ill, the homeless, prisoners and indigenous
peoples has all been etched in relief against a world that was more
worried about the market and the economy, fearful that these twin
beasts might die. Grief has been frustrated by altered access to the
dying, funeral arrangements, fewer to say goodbye and the fear of
contagion.

Development of grief

Grief is so different at different ages. The virus may not be expe-
rienced by the young in the same way as those older. But grief is
contagious too. Older people have children, grandchildren and
sometimes great grandchildren and friends and loved ones. The R
- value (reproduction number) for grief is very much greater than
for the virus. The grandmother never known by a newborn, the
4-year-old who will remember this past year as the time when
her mother was sad, remote and emotionally unavailable, grieving
for her own mother, the teenager who fears that he brought the
virus home, the husband who lost his wife and his job in the same
month, are all different ways of experiencing grief.

The varieties of grief

The expression of grief itself is so varied with some, especially
children, speaking their grief with their bodies in somatoform
identiﬁcation [32]: headaches, abdominal pain, difﬁculty breath-
ing, all while being medically well. Others sleep more because they
don’t know what to do in anxious lockdown while some rest ﬁt-
fully in the broken sleep of no longer living in a settled world.
The negotiation of intimacy and sex by teenagers and young adults
is a little more complex. For this generation, the complexity is not
primarily the normal raft of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV
but a seemingly less exotic virus that can cause death in days or
weeks.

(cid:1) A rethinking of the work-life balance has been undertaken by many families, emboldened by the COVID-19 mandated forced realignment of the working day to

include more ﬂexibility around schedules

(cid:1) A rapid uptake of on-line communication for work purposes
(cid:1) The appreciation by employers and governments of the ability to work efﬁciently from home.
(cid:1) Notwithstanding the challenges of educating children at home for considerable periods of time, families came together with an appreciation of how productivity

can be achieved at home in deference to an overarching sense of presenteeism in the traditional ofﬁce workspace

(cid:1) International conferencing being conducted on-line at greatly reduced cost has facilitated greater reach to people across the globe
(cid:1) Greater collaboration to improve medical knowledge of COVID-19 has been well served by the major journal publishers placing their COVID-19 content on line with

unrestricted access

(cid:1) Vaccine development has been dramatically hastened by collaboration and the application of technology to the point where millions of lives will be saved through

immunisation of the global population

(cid:1) It is likely that the travel restrictions have fostered a greater appreciation of what one’s own country has to offer and reduced the pollution generated throughout

the world from airline travel

(cid:1) Further, a time to reﬂect upon the nature of zoonotic infections has prompted an appreciation of mankind’s role within the biosphere and ultimately, how tenuous

our presence may be on the planet

For young people there is often an irritable grief of resentment
that their youth is being captured by bigger forces and will not
return; a grief for what cannot be while larger meanings stretch
across the world and consume their own small lives. Life and love
and play have all been changed and the resources of our country,
the education of our people, the leaders of our communities hold
our young people’s future to poll-driven ransom.

A morbid or complicated grief

As if grief were not complicated at any time [33], this interna-
tional grief, this multiform and culturally crafted grief, can shift
from an experience that represents our shifting adaptation and
struggle to accept, to a truly morbid grief. When griefs are too
many, last too long, occur too close on the heels of each other,
are too grievous and lacerating in nature and call a halt to too
many aspects of our lives, we call this morbid or complicated grief.
When the preoccupation with the dead merges with a loathing of
the self, the trauma of the loss with a shame that we have con-
tributed in some way to bringing on that loss, we are likely to iden-
tify it as depression rather than an unmixed grief. Depression,
anxiety and loneliness ﬂowing out of grief, or preceding and made
worse by grief, fortify a morbid grief into a disabling condition for
which expert help is often required.

When this constellation of adversity occurs in the young, the
impact can be devastating. Strangely, adults often underestimate
this impact as if ‘grown-ups’ have a monopoly on worry. Depres-
sion in the young is often more severe, more likely to persist, more
readily dismissed as ﬂeeting or ‘a stage’ to be ‘grown out of’. When
children cannot trust adults to manage the world, the community
or the family, then anxiety pervades their thought lives and the
interstitium of their security [34]. Dismissing children’s anxiety
is a foolishness of adults failing to appreciate that children develop
anxiety when their hopes are in jeopardy.

Grief is further modiﬁed by cultural marginalisation and dis-
ability. With conditions complicating grief such as autism, intellec-
tual disability, expressive and receptive communication disorders
[35,36], grief can remain unaddressed for years or misinterpreted
as challenging behaviour due to the inexplicable nature of any neu-
rodevelopmental condition.

A nostalgia for what has not yet been

The unmasking of inequities of migrant workers in luxury ocean
liners, meat works, age care facilities, and the farms of developed
countries, paid so little, protected so inadequately, cannot be
unseen. High end restaurants with unremunerated workers who
live in communal settings to make ends meet form a perfect com-
municating ground for a spreading virus. The ‘blind’ virus, does not
discriminate and will spread from these most vulnerable to those
whom they serve.

Our children begin to yearn for a world where such blatant
inequities do not occur and grieve when it isn’t made so. It is this
nostalgia for what might have been, the grief for what our society
isn’t that may yet drive the children we care for and love to do a
better job at international communal and family cooperation than
we have.

CONCLUSION

The pandemic was in many ways like an earthquake with a dev-
astating initial impact and ongoing aftershocks as the ground
keeps shifting. Nothing feels normal and we accept that what we
had before COVID-19 appeared remains a long way off. The phys-
ical and emotional experiences of trauma, loss and grief have des-

cended upon children and their families with uncertain long-term
consequences which will require our ongoing willingness to
respond openly and appropriately to all across the globe.

DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

(cid:1) To explore the longer term consequences of COVID-19 related
school closures on levels of anxiety, academic progression, peer
relationships and domestic cohesion.

(cid:1) To quantitate the resources required to meet the mental health
needs for children and families related to trauma, loss and grief
emanating from COVID-19.
