Abstract

Background: Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the positive psychology
intervention ‘Happiness Route’ compared to an active control condition in a vulnerable population with an
accumulation of health and psychosocial problems.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, single-blind, actively-controlled, parallel group study in seven
municipalities in the Netherlands. To be eligible, participants had to experience loneliness, health problems and low
socio-economic status. Each group received several home visits by a counsellor (two in the control condition, two
to six in the experimental condition). In the Happiness Route, a happiness-based approach was used, whereas the
control condition used a traditional problem-based approach. The primary outcome was well-being, measured with
the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF).

Results: Fifty-eight participants were randomized to the Happiness Route, 50 to the control condition. Participants
were severely lonely, had on average three health problems and less than 5% had paid work. The total MHC-SF
score, emotional and social well-being, depression and loneliness improved significantly over the nine-month
period in both conditions (p < .05), but there were no significant changes between the conditions across time.
Languishing decreased significantly from 33% at baseline to 16% at follow-up among the Happiness Route
participants but did not change significantly in the control condition. No significant improvement over time was
found in psychological well-being, resilience, purpose in life, health-related quality of life and social participation.
Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that expected saved costs per QALY lost was €219,948 for the Happiness Route,
relative to the control condition. The probability was 83% that the Happiness Route was cost saving and 54% that
the Happiness Route was cost-effective at a willingness to accept a threshold of €100,000.
Conclusions: Mental health status of both groups improved considerably. However, we could not demonstrate
that the Happiness Route yielded better health outcomes compared to the control condition. Nevertheless, the
results of the cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the Happiness Route is an acceptable intervention from a
health-economic point of view. Our results should be viewed in light of the fact that we could not include the
planned number of participants.

Introduction
This study, a randomized controlled trial of the ‘Happi-
ness Route,’ a positive psychology intervention, specific-
ally focuses on a vulnerable group that is suffering from
an accumulation of difficulties. Vulnerable adults are de-
fined as individuals who are susceptible to harm [1].
Their vulnerability is the result of the complex inter-
action between a lack of available resources and the
challenges they have to face in their lives. Our target
group has a disadvantaged socio-economic status (SES)
as well as a lack of a social support network (leading to
increased levels of loneliness), combined with personal
limitations in the form of health problems. Each of these
factors alone – a low SES, loneliness and health prob-
lems – is a risk factor for diminished well-being [2–9].
In addition to the negative effects of these risk factors
on the individual, these factors can also result in nega-
tive societal outcomes, such as the growing costs associ-
ated with loneliness [10]. Low SES and loneliness can
also lead to a greater risk of early mortality [11] and in-
creased morbidity [12] and are associated with physical
illness [13] and mental disorders such as depression
[14]. Such an accumulation can precipitate a negative
downward spiral, resulting in a serious loss of well-being
and an exacerbation of symptoms of (mental) health
complaints [15, 16], consequently leading to more health
care consumption and higher economic costs.

In this study, rather than treating symptoms, we exam-
ined an approach that is based on the principles of posi-
tive psychology directed towards improving the well-
being of this group of vulnerable adults. The field of
positive psychology has expanded traditional psychology

by including and examining topics such as strengths,
growth and well-being [17]. The promotion of well-
being is now widely recognized as a new goal in mental
health care to complement the traditional focus on pre-
venting and treating problems [2, 18, 19]. Improved
well-being has positive effects on health and personal
functioning, resulting in health gains at both the individ-
ual and societal level [20].

Several meta-analyses show that positive psychology
interventions (PPIs) can improve emotional and psycho-
logical well-being [21–23]
. However, despite earlier
findings that PPIs tend to yield better results in these
populations [20, 21], only a minority of
intervention
studies target groups with multiple health and psycho-
social problems. Studies addressing clinical populations
were all directed to groups with a specific problem, ei-
ther a physical or mental disorder (e.g., cancer or de-
pression), a problematic condition (e.g., loneliness), or to
a specific age group (e.g., the elderly). Yet many people
suffer from multiple problems and diseases making them
especially vulnerable [24]. Given this population’s high
level of suffering and the resultant negative implications
for society, PPIs need to be more widely used among
groups with more complex vulnerabilities. Therefore, we
evaluated a PPI for a group with a complex of problems
spanning across their lifespan, rather than for a target
group with a specific disease or condition.

One of the few happiness-based interventions that has
been successfully implemented in practice in local com-
munities in the Netherlands [25] is called the ‘Happiness
Route’ [26]. To evaluate the intervention, this study uses
a multicentre trial design and tests the intervention the

Page 3 of 17

way it is delivered in the everyday practice of social
work, comparing it to an active control condition. One
of the goals of our study, therefore, was to add valuable
information with regard to
theoretically and practical
whether PPIs can improve well-being in people with
great vulnerabilities and how the PPIs might do so.

The aims of this randomized controlled study were to
examine (1) reach: the characteristics of the reached par-
ticipants; (2) effectiveness: effects of the Happiness Route
intervention in comparison to Customized Care regard-
ing the (a) primary outcome measure of well-being and
the (b) secondary outcome measures of resilience, pur-
pose in life, depression, health-related quality of
life,
loneliness, social participation and health care costs; (3)
treatment satisfaction of the participants, comparing the
Happiness Route intervention to Customized Care; and
(4) cost-effectiveness: to compare the cost-effectiveness of
the Happiness Route with the control condition.

Methods
Design
The trial, conducted in the Netherlands, was a multicen-
tre, equally randomized, parallel group study with an ex-
perimental condition and active control condition. The
randomization with participants as unit had an alloca-
tion ratio of 1:1 for the two groups. Only participants
were blinded to the expectations with regard to both
conditions. A detailed description of the study design is
published in a research protocol [27]. Instead of the ten
centres that were originally planned, seven centres took
part, as three centres dropped out. Also, the number and
distribution of participants across the centres did not
correspond to the original plan, as the inclusion of par-
ticipants was challenging and progressed differently be-
tween each centre.

Participants
Recruitment and setting
Intermediaries who were regularly in contact with the
target group during their daily work recruited the partic-
ipants. These intermediaries were professionals from the
health and welfare sector, such as social workers, general
practitioners, nurses, or people working in home care.
The counsellors of both the experimental and control
condition could also propose candidates. The project
leader of the municipality identified and informed the
intermediaries. Data was collected in seven local munici-
palities throughout the Netherlands. The population of
the municipalities ranged from circa 33,000 (Tynaarlo)
to 176,000 inhabitants (Nijmegen). The seven project
leaders were located in a local municipality (Hengelo), a
foundation that supports leisure time for people with a
disability (Almelo), a service club (Woerden), a mental
and welfare
organization (Nijmegen)
health care

organizations (Zeist, Tynaarlo, Assen). Two of the pro-
ject leaders were volunteers (Woerden and Zeist).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Eligible participants were aged 18 or older; experiencing
loneliness (scoring 3 or higher on the loneliness scale
[28]); suffering from mental and/or physical health prob-
lems (having at least one health limitations in the Euro-
Qol 5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire [29]); and with a low
socio-economic status, which was defined as having a
low education (no more than a lower secondary educa-
tion) and/or low employment status (not having a paid
job) and/or low financial income (as defined by the Sta-
tistics Netherlands [30]: less than €1000 per month for a
single household and between €1000 and €1500 for a
couple or a single household with at least one child).

Candidates were excluded if they met one or more of the
following criteria: high well-being (one standard deviation
above the mean of the Dutch population on the Mental
Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF), that is, a score
of 4.83 or higher [31]); severe, untreated depression (scor-
ing 39 or higher on the Center for Epidemiology Depres-
sion Scale (CES-D), without being under psychological
treatment [32, 33]); being currently in a crisis situation,
such as being homeless or having recently lost a partner
(judged by the counsellor during the intake); or insufficient
cognitive or linguistic skills to fill out a questionnaire
(judged by the counsellor during the intake).

Sample size
A small to medium effect size was expected for the Hap-
piness Route condition (Cohen’s d = .35), based on a
meta-analysis on positive psychology interventions [22].
Preceding
the G*power program was
employed to determine that a total sample size of 204
would be required to have an 80% chance to detect an
effect of this magnitude at α = .05 (one-sided). To ac-
count for a maximum of 20% drop out, 256 participants
were to be included – 128 in each condition. However,
the study could not be completed with the sample size
and power originally planned. Instead, 108 participants
were included, 58 receiving the Happiness Route and 50
Customized Care. None of the municipalities could re-
cruit the intended number of participants (Hengelo n =
43, Almelo n = 26, Zeist n = 21, Woerden n = 8, Nij-
megen n = 4, Tynaarlo n = 3, Assen n = 3). When looking
at the realized power, there was a 56% chance to obtain
statistically significant results with an effect size of 0.35,
as calculated with the G*power program.

Randomization and blinding
Eligible participants were randomized to either the Hap-
piness Route or Customized Care. The random alloca-
tion sequence was generated a priori by a computer-

Weiss et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2020) 18:162 

Page 4 of 17

generated randomized number list, made with random-
izer.org. No restriction or stratification was used. The list
was concealed and only used when the next participant
had to be assigned to one of the two groups. The first au-
thor, LAW, generated the random allocation sequence.
Enrolling and assigning participants was performed by
LAW, and partly by a student assistant (PH) after receiv-
ing thorough training and while under supervision. The
project leaders and counsellors were not involved in the
sequence generation and allocation concealment in any
way. LAW or PH informed the local project leader about
the outcome of the inclusion and randomization, who
then appointed a suitable counsellor to the participant, if
possible, the same counsellor who conducted the intake.
The counsellor informed the participant about which
group he or she was randomized to and delivered the
intervention during the following 3 months.

Those who were aware of the allocated condition in-
cluded the project leaders, counsellors who delivered the
interventions and partially helped to collect data, investi-
gators who assessed the outcomes and the researchers
who conducted the statistical analysis. Participants were
kept blinded to the expectations related to their alloca-
tion. They were informed that they would be randomly
assigned to one of two groups and that each group had a
different approach to delivering optimal care. After the
inclusion was completed, participants were told to which
group they were assigned. They were not informed that
one group was a control condition while the other group
was the intervention that under investigation. These
terms mean that, although participants were not fully
blinded to the intervention, they were blinded to the ex-
pectations and the fact that an experimental condition
was compared to a control condition. None of the par-
ticipants had to be unblinded while the trial was being
conducted.

Interventions
Counsellors
Of the 66 trained counsellors, 52 were professionals
from the health care and welfare sector and 14 were ex-
perienced volunteers. All counsellors received intensive
training on how to conduct the research and interven-
tion by the main researcher (LAW): 46 were trained to
deliver the Happiness Route and 20 to deliver the con-
trol condition. Volunteers were all
in the Happiness
Route condition. All counsellors received regular (peer)
intervision (about twice a year), supervised by LAW.
Counsellors had a mean age of 50.09 years (SD 12.81),
ranging between 23 and 70 years. Eighty-three percent of
the counsellors were female, 92% were Dutch and 93%
followed higher education, while 7% had a medium edu-
cation level. They had a mean of 18 years (SD 12.61)

work experience in the health care or welfare sector,
with a maximum experience of 43 years.

Experimental condition: the happiness route
The Happiness Route has been developed in the munici-
pality of Almelo in the Netherlands and was implemented
by the non-profit organization Arcon in multiple cities
throughout the region. Adapted and formalized by the
University of Twente to be more theory-driven, the Hap-
piness Route is a positive psychology intervention [34],
using the principles of self-determination theory [35] as it
supports the autonomy, competence and relatedness of
participants. The aim of the intervention is to increase
well-being by supporting participants to find and act on a
passion or intrinsically motivated activity.

Over the course of 3 months, counsellors visited par-
ticipants at home between two to six times. The time
interval between visits depended on the wishes and
needs of the individual participant, but generally visit in-
tervals were between 1 to 3 weeks. Practice has shown
that the number of home visits can vary between partici-
pants, as they differ widely in how quickly they can iden-
tify a passion and their need for support. A session had
a maximum duration of 90 min. After shortly talking
about the participant’s current situation, problems were
explicitly ‘laid aside’. Instead, the counsellor asked ques-
tions that aimed to discover sources of happiness for the
‘What makes your eyes twinkle?’
participant, such as:
The counsellor could choose from a set of evidence-
based methods that he or she considered best for the in-
dividual and situation, such as examining values (‘What
is important to you?’), behavioural activation [36] or life-
review methods [31] (looking back on their childhood
‘Which dreams
and reflecting on happy memories, e.g.
did you have as a child? Who was your childhood hero?
What was your dream job? During which kind of activ-
ities did you have fun?’). Counsellors would also encour-
age participants
future dreams, with
questions such as: ‘What would you do if nothing could
hold you back? Is there something you always wanted to
do, but you never did?’

to examine

To explore all options, a list of all named interests,
dreams and possibilities was written down. Finally, the
participant had to choose an activity to carry out. This
could be supported by the method of ‘anticipated regret’;
imagining what you would regret most if you had not
done it in a couple of years (see [27]). The choice of ac-
tivity needed to be related to the passion of the partici-
pant. The participant had the final say in the chosen
activity while counsellors only offered support to make
sure that the choice could be done autonomously. For
example, if someone’s passion was art, the chosen activ-
ity might be taking painting classes. The counsellors
were trained to not exclude any activity in the beginning,

Weiss et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2020) 18:162 

Page 5 of 17

but to later assess whether the activity could be realized
and, if necessary, gently nudge the participant towards a
more realistic activity.

Counsellors supported participants in the process of
finding an activity and acting upon it, but participants
were explicitly encouraged to actively search and plan a
preferably long-lasting activity. Possible pitfalls and how
to deal with them were discussed. The choice of activity
needed to be made by the participant
in order to
strengthen feelings of autonomy. Ideally, existing talents
could be used or skills could be developed during the ac-
tivity, in order to strengthen feelings of competence. If
the participant was able to come into contact with
others during the chosen activity, it was also an advan-
tage to strengthening feelings of relatedness. However,
none of these particulars were explicitly demanded. The
only requirement was that the participant had to spend
the budget on him/herself to buy something that was re-
lated to a passion or intrinsically motivated activity.

The participants were allowed to spend up to €500 to
realize their passion. The money could be used to pay for
an activity (e.g., a painting course or yoga classes) or to
purchase something needed for an activity (e.g., a camera
or a season ticket to the local football club). When a suit-
able activity was found, a budget application form was
filled out together by the counsellor and participant and
then sent to the project leader. The project leader decided
if the activity fit the passion and usually sent the money
directly to the account of the participant. LAW and AF
trained the project leaders on how to identify if an activity
was suitable. They would especially focus on one question
in the form in which the counsellor had to explain how
the passion was linked to the activity. If that was not suffi-
ciently clear, the project leader would refer back to the
counsellor and ask for clarification. We also provided the
opportunity to discuss decisions with the lead researcher.
We additionally provided the project leader with the op-
tion to consult with a committee (with experienced
former project
leaders). The money was not always
needed, for example, when people chose to engage in vol-
untary work as an activity.

The aim was to find an activity and start doing it
within 3 months. The last session was an early feedback
session, so that first experiences could be shared, the ac-
tivity could be evaluated and, if needed, adjusted. The
counsellor could also evaluate if the money was spent in
the intended way. Also, the project leaders would check
sporadically on random cases, to ensure that the money
was used as described in the application. In practice,
some participants started performing the activity after 3
months, often due to practical reasons, such as the start-
ing date of a course.

We ensured the integrity of the intervention by giving
all counsellors an intensive training of one to two full

days, where we practised the intervention with exercises
and role-plays. Also,
intervision sessions (led by the
LAW) were organized at least every 6 months, where
questions could be asked and experiences exchanged
with fellow counsellors, the researcher or the project
leader. During intervision sessions, the group members
discussed all of their current cases.

Control condition: customized care
The active control condition, called `Customized Care´,
encompassed two home visits with a maximum duration
of 90 min by a health care professional, over a time span
of 3 months. In this group, no volunteers were used, as
they did not have the authority to implement, optimise
or change health or social services being provided to the
participant. The aim of this active control group was to
provide the participants of the control condition with
professional attention, similar to the experimental condi-
tion. This way, we could control for nonspecific treat-
ment effects (attention, time and the expectation to
receive help). A further goal was to provide the partici-
pants of the control condition with the best possible care
through the traditional problem-focus approach.

During the first session, counsellor and participant
worked towards a shared definition of what the partici-
pant’s problems entailed. Next, participants were asked
how satisfied they were with the care they were receiv-
ing, taking stock of all the services they used with the
help of a list. Possible mismatches between needs and
received care could be identified at this stage. In the
cases where participants were either dissatisfied, needed
help for certain problems or received abundant help, the
counsellor tried to improve the situation. Adjustments
to care included any form of help the counsellor consid-
ered appropriate, such as organizing more or less care or
different care. Possible options for optimizing the care
situation were discussed with the participant, with the
counsellor taking the lead and informing the participant
about all possible options of services that might be un-
known to the participant. Counsellors ensured that each
participant received the best possible care and optimised
the care, if needed. Beforehand, it was estimated that 3 h
would be enough to work through all these steps, but
practice showed that, in a couple of cases, one or two
more sessions were needed. Any possible changes to a
participant’s care were supposed to start within 3
months. If the care was already optimal, nothing needed
to be changed, but the participant was assured to receive
the best possible care available. Examples of possible
changes were more support for a certain area or task
(e.g., domestic help), counselling, or other forms of ther-
apy (e.g., occupational therapy). After having filled out
the control

checked the application form and sent either a Happi-
ness Route or Customized Care counsellor to do an in-
take. Beforehand, the candidate received a letter with
information about the aim of the project, eligibility, what
it meant to participate, how the project worked, the ben-
efits of participation, information about how participa-
tion was voluntary, what would happen with the data,
and whom to contact with questions. During intake, the
research-project was explained in more detail and, if the
the candidate
individual was willing to participate,
signed an informed consent and filled out the baseline
questionnaire. If needed, the counsellor provided assist-
ance. The informed consent and questionnaire were
then sent to the primary investigator (LAW).

Outcome measures
A paper and pencil questionnaire was used at three time
points: at baseline, after 3 months, and 9 months after
baseline (follow-up). The same questionnaire with 92
items was used for all three time points, with the excep-
tion that the first one, filled out during the intake, also
included 13 questions on personal characteristics, and
two questionnaires included 4 questions to
the last
evaluate the intervention. Participants filled out
the
questionnaires by themselves at home. At baseline, the
counsellor was always present and could help. The sec-
ond and third questionnaires were sent by post. If the
participants needed help filling out the questionnaires,
they could ask the counsellor for help. If the question-
naire was not sent back after 2 weeks, the investigator
contacted the counsellor and requested that he or she
check on the participant and help with the question-
naire’s completion, if needed.

Primary outcome
The primary outcome of this study was well-being, mea-
sured with the Dutch MHC-SF [31]. The scale has 14
items and 3 subscales: emotional well-being (items 1–3),
social well-being (items 4–8) and psychological well-
being (items 9–14). Emotional well-being is related to
the subjective evaluation of one’s well-being in terms of
happiness,
interest in life and life satisfaction. Social
well-being refers to one’s social functioning (e.g., inte-
grating into and contributing to a group), while psycho-
logical well-being relates to positive functioning on an
individual level (e.g., having a purpose and feeling au-
tonomous). Participants were asked to rate the frequency

of certain feelings they have experienced during the past
month on a six-point scale from ‘never’ to ‘every day’. The
score ranges from 0 to 5, with a higher score indicating
higher well-being. The three-factor structure has been
confirmed in Dutch, Canadian and American samples [31,
37, 38]. Reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of the three sub-
scales was .83 for both emotional and psychological well-
being and .74 for social well-being in the Dutch study
[31]. The instrument had a satisfactory test-retest reliabil-
ity (.65). The 9-month test-retest reliability for the scales
was .46 for emotional well-being, .47 for social well-being
and .53 for psychological well-being. The three compo-
nents had good convergent validity [31].

With the MHC-SF, a person’s subscores can can also
determine his or her category of positive mental health
[39]. Following Keyes’ diagnostic criteria, someone is de-
scribed as flourishing when having scored ‘every day’ or
‘almost every day’ at least one time for the three emo-
tional well-being items and at least six times for the 11
social and psychological well-being items. When some-
one scores ‘never’ or ‘once or twice’ at least once on the
emotional well-being items and at least six times on the
social and psychological well-being items, he or she is
categorized as languishing. Individuals who are neither
languishing nor flourishing are described as moderately
mentally healthy.

Secondary outcomes
All secondary outcomes were previously developed and
validated scales. A detailed description of the scales can
be found in the study design [27]. The following con-
cepts were measured:

(cid:1) Resilience: Brief Resilience Scale [40] with six items

with a maximum score of five;

(cid:1) Purpose in life: the Purpose in Life Scale [37, 38, 41],
one of the six subscales from Ryff’s Psychological
Well-being Scales with five items with scores ran-
ging from 5 to 25;

(cid:1) Depression: CES-D [32, 33] with 20 items. Scores
could reach a maximum of 60, with higher scores
indicating more depressive symptoms;

(cid:1) Health-related quality of life: EQ-5D [29] with five
items with a maximum score of 1, indicating full
health;

(cid:1) Loneliness: Loneliness Scale [28] with 11 items,
ranging from 0 to 11. The total score can be
categorized into four levels: not lonely (0–2),
moderately lonely (3–8), severely lonely (9–10), and
very severely lonely (11);

(cid:1) Social participation: items from validated national

survey studies, i.e., from the Permanent Onderzoek
LeefSituatie (POLS) [42], and the Longitudinal
Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel

Weiss et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2020) 18:162

[43]. Measured with three items concerning contact
with family, friends and neighbours on a five-point
scale from ‘at least once a week’ (1) to ‘rarely or
never’ (5), and seven items on activities, such as vol-
untary work, study, helping others, religious activ-
ities or hobbies, with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as answer options.
A score between 0 and 5 was computed, with higher
scores indicating higher levels of social participation;

(cid:1) Health care costs: items from the treatment

inventory of costs in patients with psychiatric
disorders (TiC-P) [44] with nine items on received
health care and six items for other forms of received
help during the last 4 weeks. We determined the
cost prices for each volume of consumption. To
calculate costs, volumes of health care use were
multiplied by the cost prices for each volume of
care. The standard cost prices were derived from the
Dutch costing manual [45–47]. Money spent on the
Happiness Route budget was also included in the
health care costs.

(cid:1) Quality adjusted life years (QALYs): QALYs were

calculated as the area under the EQ-5D curve, using
the Dutch tariffs. It was assumed that the EQ-5D
score obtained at the final visit after 9 months was
representative for Quality of life at 12 months, hence
this value was carried forward in the calculation of
QALYs.

Treatment satisfaction
Treatment satisfaction was measured with mostly open
questions at the end of the second and third question-
naires. After 3 months, participants were asked: (1) How
good was your relationship with the counsellor on a
scale from 1 to 10 (1 = not good at all, 10 = extremely
good)? (2) What is your opinion about the home visits
of the counsellor? (3) Did the project have any effects on
your life, and if yes, can you briefly describe these ef-
fects? After 9 months, participants were asked: (1) What
is your opinion about the project? and (2) Did the pro-
ject have any effects on your life, and if yes, can you
briefly describe these effects? Responses were coded
negative, neutral/ambivalent (both negative and positive
aspects) or positive by the principal investigator.

Statistical analyses
For all variables, deviations of the normal distribution
were tested by converting skewness and kurtosis statistics
to Z-scores. Important deviations from normality were de-
fined as − 2.58 < Z-score > 2.58 for either kurtosis or skew-
ness [48]. Baseline characteristics for continuous normally
distributed variables were summarized using mean and
standard deviation (SD) and compared between the Hap-
piness Route and Customized Care, using t-tests for inde-
pendent samples. Non-normally distributed variables were

summarized using medians and the first and third quar-
tiles and compared between the treatment groups using
non-parametric test statistics. Percentages of categorical
baseline characteristics were calculated and compared be-
tween groups using chi-square statistics. At baseline, there
were no significant differences between the two conditions
on any of the demographic variables, neither on primary
or secondary outcome measures, suggesting a successful
randomization.

All analyses of primary and secondary outcomes were
performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
All participants were analysed in the condition to which
they were randomized. Multiple imputation (MI) by
chained equations was performed to replace missing
values. In MI, different datasets are generated. The MI
procedure was performed in accordance with guidelines
for MI with clinical trial data [49], which suggests, as a
rule of thumb, that MI should not be applied if the per-
centage of missing values should exceed the cut-off value
of 40%. The missing value percentage in our study did
not exceed this percentage of 40%. The imputation
model
included all primary and secondary outcomes.
Forty datasets with imputed plausible values were ob-
tained, with 200 iterations between datasets [50]. The
[51] was used to obtain
method proposed by Licht
pooled p-values. In the study protocol, we planned to
generate five different datasets. It turned out that the
differences were very large between datasets, probably
due to the smaller sample size. Therefore, we decided to
increase the datasets from 5 to 40. Intention-to-treat
analysis was compared to the results obtained in the
per-protocol population. The per-protocol population
consisted of people who completed all three question-
naires together with the intervention.

Multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance
(MANOVA) was used to compare baseline to follow-up
scores at 3 and 9 months on the primary and secondary
outcome measures between the Happiness Route and
Customized Care, with time and group as fixed factors.
At follow-up, standardized mean differences (Cohen’s d)
were calculated for all primary and secondary outcomes
as the difference between the means of the baseline and
follow-up measurements per condition, divided by their
pooled standard deviation. To interpret effect sizes, we
used the interpretation for psychological and behavioural
treatment, where effect sizes of 0 to 0.32 can be inter-
preted as small, effect sizes from 0.33 to 0.55 are seen as
medium, and effects of 0.56–1.2 are considered large
[52]. We did not conduct moderator analyses, as origin-
ally planned, as the power was too small. All statistical
analyses were performed with SPSS 23.

The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a
health care perspective and was performed in accord-
ance with the ISPOR Good Research Practices guidelines

Weiss et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2020) 18:162

for cost-effectiveness analysis alongside clinical trials [53].
The incremental net benefit (iNMB) of the Happiness
Route relative to the control condition was calculated as i
NMBðWTAÞ ¼ WTA ΔQ−ΔC . Willingness
to accept
(WTA) is a threshold value that represents the minimum
cash amount the decision maker would accept to give up
one QALY. ΔQ and ΔC refer to the means of the incre-
mental effects in QALYs and incremental costs in euros
respectively. An iNMB > 0 indicates that the amount of
money saved exceeds the WTA threshold and, in the case
of the present study, that the Happiness Route would pro-
vide better value for money compared with Customized
Care. The probability that iNMB > 0 was estimated for
various values of the WTA threshold, using a method
based on the central limit theorem proposed by Nixon
et al. [54], in which it is assumed that the incremental
costs and effects have an approximate bivariate normal
distribution. The expected value and variance of iNMB
was calculated for various values of the WTA threshold in
each of the 40 multiply imputed datasets and the results
were pooled using Rubin’s rules. The pooled parameter
estimates were then used to construct cost-effectiveness
acceptability curves that incorporated uncertainty due to
both sampling and imputation error.

Results
Reach of participants
Participants had a median age of 60.00 years, ranging
from 26 to 89 years; 75 were female, 33 were male.
There were six people from other European countries
(one each from Germany, Belgium, Spain, Romania,
Serbia and the former Yugoslavia), five from Asia (one
from Russia, one from Indonesia, and three from
Turkey), one from South-America (Suriname) and one
from North America (the Antilles). Five people had, be-
sides their Dutch citizenship, another cultural back-
ground: French, Indian/German, German, Turkish and
Swiss. Three people did not indicate their cultural back-
ground. For details on the baseline characteristics of the
participants, see Table 1.

Loneliness
Participants had a median score of 9.01 on the loneliness
scale at baseline (Q1 = 8.00, Q3 = 11.00), which is consid-
ered as severely lonely [55]. Participants spent most of
their time at home; on average, they spent less than 2 h
outside per day, with a median score of 7 days per week
inside (Q1 = 5.00, Q3 = 7.00).

Health problems
Participants had a median of 3.00 health problems, with
up to 10 diseases, indicating a high level of comorbidity.
The most frequent diseases occurring across all health
problems were internal medicine diseases (37% of all dis-
eases mentioned, e.g., rheumatic and endocrinological
diseases), mental disorders (17.1%, e.g., depression and
personality disorder), orthopaedics and accident surgery
diseases (18.4%, e.g., arthritis and osteoporosis), neuro-
logical diseases (8%, e.g., epilepsy and stroke) and non-
specific symptoms and diseases (9.3%, e.g., concentration
problems). Diseases occurring less often (each less than
2.7%) were surgical, urinary system, skin, genetic, oto-
rhinolaryngology, dental and eye diseases. A person
could score in several categories and more than once in
one category. Only one participant did not report having
any health problems, but still had an impaired health-
related quality of life.

The mean of health-related quality of life, measured
with the Dutch EQ-5D, was 0.45 at baseline. The SD of
0.30 indicated a large variation in health-related quality
of life. The mean CES-D score of participants was 26.06
(SD 12.16), where a cut-off score of 16 is indicative of
clinically relevant depressive symptomatology [56]. Al-
most half of the participants (45.4%) took psychotropic
drugs; 23.1% took benzodiazepines, 23.1% took antide-
pressants, 9.3% took sleep-inducing drugs, and 9.3% took
antipsychotic drugs.

SES
Socio-economic status was low. Only 4.6% had paid
work. Almost 60% had a low education and close to 70%
had a low income.

Well-being
Average well-being was very low, with a total mean
score of 1.99 (SD 0.91), on a scale from 0 to 5 [31].
Thirty-one percent of the participants were languishing
at the start of the intervention.

Treatment adherence and completion
For details about the participant flow, see Fig. 1. Of the
123 candidates assessed for eligibility, 108 participants
were randomized. Ten candidates were excluded because
they did not have ‘enough’ problems, whereas four had
problems that were too severe and one had been a par-
ticipant of the Happiness Route before. Of the 58 partic-
ipants randomized to the Happiness Route, 23 did not
fully adhere. The non-adherers did not apply for a
budget nor did they take part in an activity because, for
example, they needed to stop the Happiness Route due
to health or psychological problems. There were no sig-
nificant differences between intervention adherers (n =
35) and non-adherers (n = 23) of the Happiness Route at

baseline, with the exception of ‘daily activity’ (χ2
7 =
14.87, p = .04). Intervention adherers were more often
unemployed and receivers of a disability pension and
less often retired than non-adherers. Of the participants
who did adhere to the intervention, 43% followed a
course (e.g., a photography course, painting class, or
music lessons), 25% made a purchase (e.g., a computer,
library card, camera, e-bike, or walking boots), 16%
followed a social activity (e.g., bingo, dating, or commu-
nity centre activities), and 16% started with sports (e.g.,
gym membership, yoga, or martial arts). The mean of
the budget spent was €168.17.

In contrast, only one of the 50 participants included in
Customized Care did not fully adhere to the program.
Examples of the actions taken in the Customized Care
group were more health care, e.g., support by a social
psychiatric nurse, ambulant counselling, a social worker
at the workplace, (more) domestic help, or extra hours
of physiotherapy. One participant wanted less domestic
help, which was arranged. Others received more social
support, e.g., becoming part of a senior club or going on
bus trips with a group, and several participants joined a
buddy project. Other forms of help were also organized,
e.g., help for the son of a participant, or getting help for
financial questions from someone from the participant’s
own social network.

The response rate was 100% at baseline, 73.15% at 3-
months (79 completers of 108), and 77.78% at 9-months
follow-up (84 completers of 108). While at 3 months, the
difference in response rate between the participants of the
and Customized Care was non-
Happiness Route
significant (78% vs. 69%; χ2
1 = 1.12, p = .29), it was signifi-
cant at follow-up (88% vs. 69%; χ2
1 = 5.63, p = .018). No
significant differences at baseline emerged between partic-
ipants who completed all three measurements (n = 76)
and non-completers (n = 32), with the exception of in-
come (χ2
(1) = 4.16, p = .04) and resilience (t(106) = − 2.08;
p = .04). More completers (71%)
than non-completers
(51%) had a low-income level. Completers were less resili-
ent than non-completers (2.51 vs. 2.85). No harm was
measured or reported in the two groups during the time
period of the study.

Effectiveness
Primary and secondary outcome measures
Table 2 provides the means and standard errors (S.E.) at
all three measurement times, as well as tests and effect
sizes for the effectiveness of the primary and secondary
outcome measures.

Primary outcome No significant time x group inter-
action effect was found in the MANOVA analysis of the
primary endpoint. However, the total score of the MHC-
SF and the subscales of both emotional and social well-

being improved significantly over the 9-month period in
both groups (p < .05). No significant improvement was
found in the subscale of psychological well-being. No
significant interaction effect between time and condition
was found for the total scale, nor the subscales of the
MHC-SF. The effect size (Cohen’s d) for the total score
of well-being was somewhat higher for the Happiness
Route (0.38), compared to Customized Care (0.17). The
effect size for the Happiness Route can be considered
moderate, whereas the effect size for the control condi-
tion is considered small [52]. There were no differences
in results when adherers-only to the Happiness Route
were compared to adherers in the Customized Care. The
general pattern of the results in the per-protocol popula-
tion was similar to the results of the intention-to-treat
analysis (see Additional file 1).

In Table 3, the three mental health categories were used to
assess the development of well-being. Across the conditions
and across time, there were no significant differences at base-
line (χ2
2 = 3.84, p = .147). Most participants had moderate
mental health, followed by those who were languishing. The
percentage of languishers decreased significantly by half,
from more than 30% at baseline to less than 16% at follow-
up in the Happiness Route (marginal homogeneity test with
p = .029). The control condition did not change significantly
(marginal homogeneity test with p = .593).

Secondary outcomes Concerning the secondary out-
come measures, no significant interaction effect between
time and group was found. A significant improvement
over time was found for both groups in depression and
loneliness (p < .05), but not for resilience, purpose in life,

tion, 15.4% of the participants evaluated the home visits
negatively. An example of a negative evaluation by a par-
ticipant of the Customized Care condition was: ‘I did not
experience that home visit as pleasant. Too much about
the past’. When asked to give a judgment on the effects of
the intervention, participants of the Happiness Route were
significantly more likely to experience positive effects than
participants of

9-month
In the follow-up measurement, participants of the experi-
mental condition were significantly less likely to be nega-
tive and more likely to be satisfied with the intervention
than the participants of the control condition (χ2
3 = 10.30,
p = .016). For example, one positive reaction of a Happi-
ness Route participant was: ‘Yes, it certainly has given me
the opportunity to go out of the house more, and to come
in contact with people more often. I am more active, also
by going to a gym. Thank you!’ In the Customized Care
the participants who evaluated the
group, one of

intervention negatively said: ‘Not interesting. I do not see
any progress and I find it tiring.’

During follow-up, Happiness Route participants were
significantly more likely to describe positive effects than
the Customized Care participants (χ2
3 = 9.35, p = .025).
An example from the Happiness Route was: ‘Enthusiastic,
discovered that there are things that I can enjoy again. Be-
ing proud of what I do at the course and getting compli-
ments for it.’ A negative evaluation was: ‘No effect, it did
not bring any changes. The activity of hiking was some-
thing that I already did before’. A percentage of 52.6% of
the participants did not experience any effects (e.g., ‘No ef-
fect due to minimal guidance.’), and 13.2% were neutral or
had mixed feelings about effects. A percentage of 23.7%
‘Moved to a very nice
experienced positive effects (e.g.,
house. Even got help from social services. Due to men-
tioned emotional stimuli, I really started thinking about

Cost-effectiveness

perspective (i.e., WTA = €0), our data suggest that there
would be an 84% chance that the Happiness Route
would be preferable to Customized Care. Uncertainty
about the Happiness Route being cost-effective relative
to Customized Care increases as a higher monetary
value is assigned to the health of participants (i.e., as
WTA increases).

Discussion
No significant differences were found between the Hap-
piness Route and Customized Care on primary and sec-
ondary outcomes. Both groups improved significantly in
well-being, depression, and loneliness. The standardized
effect sizes were somewhat higher for the Happiness
Route than for Customized Care and the percentage of
languishers decreased significantly from 32.8% at base-
line to 15.8% at follow-up for the participants in the
Happiness Route, but not in Customized Care. No ef-
fects were found for the other secondary outcomes:

resilience, purpose in life and health-related quality of
life. Participants adhered less often in the experimental
than in the control condition. Regarding the level of sat-
isfaction of participants, participants were very satisfied
with the Happiness Route. They highly rated the rela-
tionship with their counsellor with a grade of 8.5. It is
notable that none of
the participants were negative
about the intervention at 3 months and more than 90%
were positive. More than half of them said that they had
experienced positive effects both at 3 and 9 months. By
addressing positive aspects of
life such as values,
strengths and passion in the intervention instead of fo-
cusing on people’s shortcomings, the happiness-based
intervention was received more positively than the
problem-based condition. Our cost effectiveness analysis
shows that the Happiness Route may save considerable
costs, but results in slightly less accrued QALYs com-
pared to Customized Care.

There are at least three possible reasons why an inter-
action effect was not found. First, power was too low, as
The power size calculated beforehand was not reached.
Second, the differences between the experimental inter-
vention and the control condition in their approach
might have been smaller than expected. For example,
some counsellors registered participants in the control
condition for a social activity, such as activities in a se-
nior club, or found the participant social support, such
as via a buddy project. Furthermore, counsellors looked
at the whole picture of care in the Customized Care
condition, whereas in everyday practice, different care
professionals often approach specific problems from
more isolated areas of expertise. Third, the adherence-
rate was much lower in the Happiness Route compared
to the control condition. This could be explained by the
fact that the Happiness Route was more intensive and
asked more of the participants than the passive control

condition. The Happiness Route required active partici-
pation in an activity, often after years of isolation and in-
activity on the part of the participant. We have to realize
that this could be an immense, perhaps frightening step
for many people of this group. When they did persevere,
they were very satisfied with the Happiness Route and
the effects it had on them. This result corresponds to
findings that engaging in a leisure activity that one is in-
trinsically interested in, such as sports or social activities,
is linked to improved well-being [57].

Although there were no differences between the con-
ditions, we found effects for emotional and social well-
being, depression, and loneliness over time, which might
have been due to regression toward the mean [58], as
baseline scores were extremely low. On the other hand,
scores for the MHC-SF have proven to be remarkably
stable over a period of 9 months in a large panel, repre-
sentative for the Dutch population [59]. Also, it has been
shown to be very difficult to improve loneliness with in-
terventions [60, 61]. Furthermore, only three measures
improved over time, whereas resilience, purpose in life
and health-related quality also started extremely low, but
did not improve significantly over time. These are all
strong arguments against
the regression toward the
mean explanation.

A meta-analysis on PPIs has shown that - even under
more controlled conditions and often with non-active
control conditions - effect sizes were small, with a stan-
.34 for subjective well-
dardized mean difference of
being,
.20 for psychological well-being and .23 for de-
pression [22]. Except for psychological well-being, these
findings are in line with the effect sizes that we found.

An explanation for higher satisfaction could be that people
generally perceive well-being interventions as less stigmatiz-
ing than formal mental health services and, consequently,
accept them more easily [61]. Higher satisfaction indicates
that a positive psychology approach could be a viable alterna-
tive, especially for structurally isolated, vulnerable people
who demonstrate care-avoidant behaviour and tend to keep
health care that targets their problems at a safe distance [8].
This behaviour is in line with findings from a qualitative
study amongst community-dwelling, lonely older people. For
the majority of the group, primary care and community-
based services addressing their loneliness were seen as nei-
ther desirable nor helpful. Yet they considered group-based
activities with a shared interest preferable to other forms of
support [62]. Being able to offer a more attractive, acceptable
and non-stigmatizing approach could help to care for
groups that are normally difficult to reach within the
formal (mental) health care system [61]. Concerning
future research,
the intervention could be studied
with other target groups at risk for a languishing con-
dition that might be difficult
to reach with formal
mental health care, for example refugees.

While the cost effectiveness analysis showed that costs
were saved in the Happiness Route, willingness to accept
thresholds to interpret the results of disinvestment studies
have not yet been defined in the Netherlands. However,
the willingness to pay for an additional QALY lies between
€10,000 and €90,000 and is dependent on the disease bur-
den of the population under consideration. Using these
threshold values, the estimated savings of €161,953 per
QALY would suggest that the Happiness Route is an ac-
ceptable intervention. It should be noted, however, that a
disparity exists between the willingness to pay and the
willingness to accept; people are generally willing to pay a
lower amount of money to acquire one QALY compared
with the amount they would minimally want to receive be-
fore they are willing to forego 1 QALY [62].

Although recruitment proved to be difficult, a very
vulnerable group was reached, which makes our target
group especially interesting. The group we included was
even more vulnerable than expected based on the inclu-
sion criteria. On average, participants were severely
lonely, with a high comorbidity of diseases, serious de-
pressive symptoms and low levels of well-being as com-
pared to the Dutch population. In fact, participants
scored almost twice as high as the group in the Dutch
population with the highest average loneliness scores
[28]. Comparable to patients with moderate depressive
symptoms [57], the participants’ health-related quality of
life was seriously impaired, with a score that was almost
half as low as a representative sample of the Dutch
population [63]. Well-being had a low total mean score
of 1.99 (SD 0.91) on the MHC-SF, which is more than a
standard deviation below the mean of 2.98 (SD 0.85) for
the normal Dutch population [31]. While only 5% of the
Dutch population languish, 31% of the participants were
languishing at the start of the intervention [64]. The
yearly mean health costs they produced at baseline were
around €8000. Indeed, their high level of suffering and
care consumption show that
they are an important
group to pay attention to and study.

Limitations and recommendations
Our study had a couple of limitations that have to be
kept in mind when interpreting the results. First of all,
the study was underpowered. The study had under-
recruited and could not reach the sample size that was
calculated in the power analysis. Additional to the prob-
lems with inclusion, there was a high number of people
who did not complete the intervention and who did not
complete all questionnaires, both leading to a serious
problem with power. Therefore, it is possible that not
finding a difference between the experimental and con-
trol condition was due to insufficient power, rather than
equivalence of the interventions. Accordingly, a possible
reason that we did not find an interaction effect between

Weiss et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2020) 18:162

and group could be

underpowered.

that

the

study was

Furthermore, recruitment turned out to be very diffi-
cult. First, the ‘invisibility’ of the target group of lonely
people could have hindered finding candidates. Being so-
cially isolated and thus having no contact with the out-
side world makes these people very difficult to detect. As
Machielse states, structurally socially isolated people are
invisible to society [16]. Second, the fact that the inter-
vention was part of a study with a control condition
could have played a role in the limited amount of appli-
cations. Intermediaries sometimes wanted to ‘protect’
their clients from the possible stress a research project
might expose them to (e.g. filling in long questionnaires),
as well as from the chance that they could be random-
ized to the control condition. Future studies working
with intermediaries should be aware of the concerns
they might have regarding research and be prepared to
adequately and proactively respond to those concerns.

Only 12% of the participants that have been applied
for participation had to be excluded, indicating that the
intermediaries knew quite well who was qualified for the
study. However, the extreme scores of the participants
could be a sign that the intermediaries had a picture of
the target group that was too extreme. For example, can-
didates were allowed to take part with a loneliness score
of 3, while the mean score at baseline of the included
participants was around 9 (with 11 as the highest pos-
sible score). These high loneliness scores indicate that
the intermediaries seemed to have sought out people
who were extremely lonely, and as such, had a distorted-
picture of how vulnerable the target group had to be – a
possible disadvantage when using sampling by referral.
This misperception on the part of the intermediaries
could have impeded recruitment, as 28% of the Dutch
population is moderately lonely and only 4% is severely
or extremely lonely [28]. For future studies, we recom-
mend emphasizing that moderate levels of
loneliness
also indicate that someone could be applied for the
study. Although the real-life setting held limitations for
recruitment, it also meant that the external validity of
this study was good, as it took place in the field and the
recruitment as well as the intervention were conducted
as usually practiced.

It is interesting that, while there were no significant
differences in effect between groups when measured
quantitatively, participants from the Happiness Route,
compared to their counterparts in Customized Care,
were significantly more likely to describe experiencing
positive effects when responding to the open questions,
both directly after the intervention and 6 months after
home visits had stopped. This disparity could mean that
the questionnaire was less sensitive to change than the
participants’ own perceptions. Nevertheless, this possible

limitation demonstrates the added value of using open
questions to validated questionnaires.

Moreover, we did not compare the amount of contact
that was given between the two conditions. It is likely
that participants of the Happiness Route received more
visits than people in the control condition, and this was
not taken into account in the analysis. The decision to
not level the two conditions concerning the number of
sessions was due to the fact that one important aspect of
the Happiness Route is the program’s personalized fit to
the individual’s needs. While one participant might need
only two sessions, another might need twice as much
time to discover their passion. We gave the counsellors
the freedom to fit the number of sessions (within certain
limits) to each individual participant.

Due to the small sample size, we could not conduct
any moderator or mediator analysis, which would have
been relevant to differentiate for whom the intervention
works best. Therefore, we could also not take into ac-
count that in the control condition, all counsellors were
professionals, while in the Happiness Route, counsellors
were both professionals and volunteers. The reason for
this difference was that we wanted to stay as close as
possible to the traditional health care in the control con-
dition, which meant using only professionals in that con-
dition. We do not expect
there were large
differences between the counselling provided by profes-
sionals and volunteers. The Happiness Route was a new
intervention for both professionals and volunteers and
they were trained in the exact same manner, thus both
started at the same level. Furthermore, the volunteers
often had many years of experience in the health care
sector or even worked in the sector, but volunteered for
this project.

that

A final challenge of this study was the difficulty in
clearly differentiating the working ‘ingredients’ of the
intervention. A future study could use different condi-
tions, e.g., comparing the original
intervention with a
condition that only offers the rapportbuilding part, a
condition where participants receive the money without
counsellor support, and a condition where participants
receive support, but no money. Furthermore, an analysis
of treatment integrity,
for example, based on audio-
visual recordings, would allow for more in-depth insights
into which parts of the intervention were actually used
as intended.

Conclusions
This was the first study that evaluated a PPI for people
with an accumulation of risk factors for low well-being
in a practice-based multi-site trial. The findings suggest
that the Happiness Route is as effective as the current,
problem-based care in the Netherlands for a very vulner-
able part of the population. The Happiness Route might

Weiss et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2020) 18:162 

Page 16 of 17

be better to help languishing people to become moder-
ately mentally healthy, which can lead to great individual
and social benefits [65]. Participants who completed the
intervention evaluated it more positively than problem-
based care. Our results should be viewed in light of the
fact that we were not able to include the planned num-
ber of participants. Nevertheless, as the participants
benefitted from the Happiness Route and the interven-
tion proved to be cost-effective, it seems to be an accept-
able alternative intervention for vulnerable people that
fits current developments in health and social care.
