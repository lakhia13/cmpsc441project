Background

A B S T R A C T

Fear  of  falling  is  common  in  older  people  and  associated  with  serious  physical  and  psychosocial  consequences.  Exercise  (planned,
structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity aimed at improving physical fitness) may reduce fear of falling by improving strength,
gait, balance and mood, and reducing the occurrence of falls.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits, harms and costs) of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013), PsycINFO
(1967 to August 2013), AMED (1985 to August 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed
7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference
lists and consulted experts.

Selection criteria

We  included  randomised  and  quasi-randomised  trials  that  recruited  community-dwelling  people  (where  the  majority  were  aged  65
and  over)  and  were  not  restricted  to  specific  medical  conditions  (e.g.  stroke,  hip  fracture).  We  included  trials  that  evaluated  exercise
interventions compared with no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (e.g. social visits), and that measured fear of falling. Exercise

interventions  were  varied;  for  example,  they  could  be  'prescriptions'  or  recommendations,  group-based  or  individual,  supervised  or
unsupervised.

Data collection and analysis

Pairs  of  review  authors  independently  assessed  studies  for  inclusion,  assessed  the  risk  of  bias  in  the  studies  and  extracted  data.  We
combined  effect  sizes  across  studies  using  the  fixed-effect  model,  with  the  random-effect  model  used  where  significant  statistical
heterogeneity was present. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rate outcomes.
We estimated mean differences (MD) where studies used the same continuous measures and standardised mean differences (SMD) where
different  measures  or  different  formats  of  the  same  measure  were  used.  Where  possible,  we  performed  various,  usually  prespecified,
sensitivity and subgroup analyses.

Main results

We included 30 studies, which evaluated 3D exercise (Tai Chi and yoga), balance training or strength and resistance training. Two of these
were cluster-randomised trials, two were cross-over trials and one was quasi-randomised. The studies included a total of 2878 participants
with a mean age ranging from 68 to 85 years. Most studies included more women than men, with four studies recruiting women only.
Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls; three of these recruited participants who also had fear of falling.

Poor reporting of the allocation methods in the trials made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias in most studies. All of the studies
were at high risk of performance and detection biases as there was no blinding of participants and outcome assessors and the outcomes
were self reported. Twelve studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for
fear of falling immediately post intervention and 'very low' for fear of falling at short or long-term follow-up and all other outcomes.

Exercise  interventions  were  associated  with  a  small  to  moderate  reduction  in  fear  of  falling  immediately  post  intervention  (SMD  0.37
favouring exercise, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies; 1692 participants, low quality evidence). Pooled effect sizes did
not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling. Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the
direction of effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24
favouring exercise, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36). None of our subgroup analyses provided robust evidence of differences in effect in terms of either
the study primary aim (reduction of fear of falling or other aim), the study population (recruitment on the basis of increased falls risk or not),
the characteristics of the study exercise intervention or the study control intervention (no treatment or alternative intervention). However,
there was some weak evidence of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of exercise when compared with an alternative control.

There was very low quality evidence that exercise interventions may be associated with a small reduction in fear of falling up to six months
post intervention (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38; four studies, 356 participants) and more than six months post intervention (SMD 0.20,
95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; three studies, 386 participants).

Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these studies that also reported on fear of falling reduced the risk of falling
measured either as participants incurring at least one fall during follow-up or the number of falls during follow-up. Very low quality evidence
from four studies indicated that exercise interventions did not appear to reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. The
only study reporting the effects of exercise interventions on anxiety found no difference between groups. No studies reported the effects
of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is important to remember that our included studies do not represent the totality
of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only includes studies
that reported fear of falling.

Authors' conclusions

Exercise  interventions  in  community-dwelling  older  people  probably  reduce  fear  of  falling  to  a  limited  extent  immediately  after  the
intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether exercise interventions
reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes. Although further evidence from well-designed
randomised  trials  is  required,  priority  should  be  given  to  establishing  a  core  set  of  outcomes  that  includes  fear  of  falling  for  all  trials
examining the effects of exercise interventions in older people living in the community.

Exercise for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community

Many older people are afraid of falling, more so after experiencing a fall. Fear of falling can have a serious impact on an older person's
health and life as it often reduces their physical and social activities.

We wanted to find out whether exercise, in the form of a planned, structured, repetitive physical activity aimed at improving physical
fitness, helps to reduce fear of falling. Types of exercise interventions include balance training, strength and resistance training and three-
dimensional  (3D)  exercises,  such  as  dance  or  Tai  Chi.  Exercise  can  be  provided  in  various  ways.  It  can  involve  group  sessions  where
participants are taught in a class by an instructor or individuals may be provided with exercise instruction booklets, DVDs or tapes to enable
them to exercise on their own without supervision.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We searched the medical literature up to July 2013 for studies that tested the effects of exercise and reported fear of falling in community-
dwelling people (i.e. who live either at home or in places of residence that do not provide nursing care or rehabilitation) aged 65 years and
older. The studies compared exercise with no treatment or an alternative intervention, such as education.

Summary of the evidence

We included 30 studies in the review, with a total of 2878 participants whose average age ranged from 68 to 85 years. Most studies recruited
mainly women. Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls and three of these recruited people who also had fear of
falling. All of the studies were at some risk of bias mainly because the participants were aware what group they were in. This lack of blinding
may have influenced the study results.

We  found  low  quality  evidence  from  24  studies  that  exercise  interventions  result  in  a  small  to  moderate  reduction  in  fear  of  falling
immediately after the intervention. Some exploratory analyses did not enable us to determine whether this effect differed in different
groups of people, such as those at high risk of falling, or with different exercise interventions, such as group or individual exercise. We are
very unsure that the effect of exercise on fear of falling is maintained in the next few months after the end of the intervention.

We only included studies that reported fear of falling, therefore the evidence on our other outcomes (occurrence of falls, depression, anxiety
and physical activity) is only a small part of the total evidence of the effects of exercise on these outcomes. However, the evidence from nine
studies included in our review showing that exercise reduced the risk and number of falls is consistent with the results of another Cochrane
review testing the effects of exercise on preventing falls. The evidence on the other outcomes was far less and none of the included studies
reported the effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs.

Conclusion

We  concluded  that  exercise  interventions  in  community-dwelling  older  people  probably  reduce  fear  of  falling  to  a  limited  extent
immediately after the intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. We also concluded that there is not enough evidence
to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes.
We encourage further research on this topic.

We are unaware of any definitions of minimal clin-

measure1

There was significant heterogeneity of effect sizes,
which was attributable mainly to 1 study, Nguyen
2012, having a much larger effect size than other
studies. Upon removal of this study, the effect size
reduced to SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36; 23 stud-
ies; 1619 participants

None of the subgroup analyses6 provided robust
evidence of a difference in effect between different
subgroups. The possible exception was evidence
of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of
exercise when compared with an alternative con-
trol2

Very low quality evidence7 was also available from

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: Confidence interval; HADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; MD: mean difference; RR: Risk ratio; SD: Standard deviation; SMD: standardised mean difference

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1The exercises interventions in the included trials fell into three categories: 3D (Tai Chi, Yoga); gait, balance, co-ordination, functional tasks; and strength and resistance based
interventions. They were either supervised or unsupervised activities, delivered in group settings or individually; and varied in duration from up to 12 weeks to over 26 weeks.
The majority of exercise interventions were to be performed between one to three times per week.
2Twenty of the 30 included studies compared an exercise intervention with no intervention. Five studies used education as the control intervention; two studies used social home
visits; one used individualised crafts/games; one used home safety assessment; and one used discussion groups.
3Measurement tools for fear of falling included:
FES: 10 questions rated 1 (very confident) to 10 (not confident at all). A higher score indicates a lower perceived self efficacy at avoiding falls.
FES-I: 16 questions rated 1 (not at all concerned) to 4 (very concerned). A higher score indicates a higher concern about falling.
Short FES-I: 7 questions rated 1 (not at all concerned) to 4 (very concerned). A higher score indicates a higher concern about falling.
K-FES: 10 questions rated on a scale from 1 (no confidence) to 10 (extremely confident). A higher score indicates a higher perceived self efficacy at avoiding falls.
MFES: 14 questions rated 0 (not confident at all) to 10 (completely confident). A higher score indicates more confidence at avoiding falls.
ABC: 16 questions. Some studies rated from 0 (no confidence) to 100 (complete confidence), whilst others rated from 0 (no confidence) to 10 (very confident). A higher score
indicates higher balance confidence.
Balance Self-Perceptions Test: 12 questions rated 1 (no confidence) to 5 (complete confidence) in performing 12 activities of daily living without fear of loss of balance.
VAS: Participants asked to rate their fear of falling on a scale of 0 to 100 (0 = low, 100 = high fear of falling).
Single item questions:
(a) Participants asked to rate their fear of falling on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 = low, 4= high fear of falling).
(b) Participants asked to rate their worry about falling on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = not at all worried, 5 = extremely worried).
4Pooled effect sizes did not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling (test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 5.21, df = 3, P value = 0.16).
5Downgraded by one level because of study limitations, primarily a likelihood of high risk of bias from lack of blinding, and one level because the funnel plot indicated possible
publication bias.
6We carried out the following subgroup analyses: type of exercise intervention; frequency of exercise; duration of the exercise intervention; group exercises rather than individual
exercises; studies which did and did not recruit participants on the basis of increased falls risk; studies whose primary aim was to reduce fear of falling and those with an alternative
primary aim; no treatment versus an alternative intervention (e.g. education, social visits, craft activities, discussion groups) control group.

Description of the condition

Falls are an important cause of morbidity and premature mortality
among  community-dwelling  adults  aged  65  years  and  older.
The  consequences  of  falls  can  be  severe,  resulting  in  long-term
disability and substantial reduction in quality of life. Approximately
one in three community-dwelling older adults experience at least
one fall (including medically attended falls and self reported falls
not  receiving  any  medical  attention)  each  year  (Fletcher  2004;
Gillespie  2012b).  This  figure  increases  to  two  in  three  for  those
adults  who  have  a  history  of  a  fall  or  who  are  afraid  of  falling
(Andresen 2006).

Fear  of  falling  is  common  in  older  people.  A  recent  systematic
review  found  that  the  prevalence  of  fear  of  falling  in  19  studies
of  community-dwelling  older  adults  ranged  from  21%  to  85%
(Scheffer  2008).  An  earlier  review  found  the  prevalence  varied  by
falls history, ranging from 12% to 65% in community-dwelling older
adults who had not fallen and from 29% to 92% in those who had
fallen  (Legters  2002).  A  number  of  risk  factors  for  fear  of  falling
have  been  identified  including  old  age  (Scheffer  2008),  female
gender  (Howland  1993;  Scheffer  2008),  previous  falls  (Cumming
2000), the presence of environmental hazards that increase the risk
of falls (Legters 2002), dizziness (Howland 1993), visual problems
(Wang 2012), poor self rated health (Cumming 2000), symptoms of
depression  and  generalised  anxiety  (Legters  2002),  poor  balance
and gait abnormalities (Tinetti 1990), cognitive impairment (Vellas
1997), functional dependence in activities of daily living (Scheffer
2008),  living  alone  and  lower  levels  of  economic  resources
(Kempen 2009; Scheffer 2008). The consequences of fear of falling
include  falling,  restriction  or  avoidance  of  daily  activities,  loss
of  independence,  reduction  in  social  activity,  depression  and  a
reduction in quality of life (Delbaere 2010; Legters 2002).

Tinetti  and  Powell  defined  fear  of  falling  in  1993  as  "a  lasting
concern about falling that leads to an individual avoiding activities
that  he/she  remains  capable  of  performing"  (Tinetti  1993).
Fear  of  falling  has  been  conceptualised  in  different  ways  and
measured  using  different  tools  and  this,  along  with  differences
in  characteristics  of  study  populations  and  study  settings,  might
explain  some  of  the  variability  in  the  estimates  of  this  condition
(Jung 2008; Zijlstra 2007). While single-item questions have been
used to measure fear of falling, they are limited by their inability
to measure variability in degrees of fear (Jorstad 2005). The most
commonly used measures can be broadly divided into the following
conceptualisations:  those  measuring  fear  of  falling  using  single-
item  questions;  those  measuring  'falls  efficacy'  (a  person's  belief
in  their  ability  to  avoid  falling  during  activity);  those  measuring
confidence in maintaining balance; and those measuring concern
or worry about falling during activities.

Examples of tools commonly used to measure falls efficacy include
the  Falls  Efficacy  Scale  (FES)  (Tinetti  1990)  and  adaptations
to  the  scale  (MFES  (Hill  1996),  rFES  (Tinetti  1994)).  The  most
commonly  used  measure  of  balance  confidence  is  the  Activities-
specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC) (Powell 1995). Commonly
used measures for concern about falling include the international
version  of  the  FES  in  its  long  (FES-I)  (Yardley  2005)  and  short
forms (Short FES-I) (Kempen 2008), and the Modified Efficacy Scale
(Hill  1996).  The  Survey  of  Activities  and  Fear  of  Falling  in  the
Elderly  (SAFFE)  measures  worry  about  falling,  as  well  as  activity

restriction  (based  on  the  concept  that  activity  avoidance  may  be
an early sign of fear of falling) (Lachman 1998). In their systematic
review of psychological outcome measures of falling, Jorstad 2005
highlighted inconsistency and confusion in the application of the
various tools that have been used in this area. Contributing to this
problem,  there  are  often  several  variants  of  tools  in  use  and  the
names of the scales may not match the construct they measure: e.g.
FES-I assesses concerns about falling instead of falls efficacy as its
name may suggest (Kempen 2008; Yardley 2005). The large number
of different tools highlights the importance of clearly identifying the
construct being measured by each tool (Jorstad 2005).

Description of the intervention

This review is focused on exercise interventions. Exercise is defined
as  physical  activity  that  is  "planned,  structured,  repetitive,  and
purposive  in  the  sense  that  the  improvement  or  maintenance  of
one or more components of physical fitness is the objective" (CDC
2011) and includes gait, balance, functional, strength, resistance,
flexibility,  three-dimensional  (3D),  such  as  dance  or  Tai  Chi,
and  endurance  training.  Exercise  interventions  may  be  exercise
'prescriptions' or recommendations, done in groups or individually
and  may  be  supervised  or  unsupervised.  Exercise  prescriptions
(e.g.  the  UK  exercise  referral  scheme,  the  New  Zealand  "Green
Prescription"  or  the  US  "Exercise  is  Medicine"  programme)
typically  involve  a  healthcare  professional  assessment  of  current
physical  activity  level,  a  referral  to  a  physical  activity  specialist
or  service  and  an  assessment  by  a  physical  activity  specialist  or
service to determine a recommended exercise programme. Other
exercise interventions include exercise supervised by direct contact
with  a  professional,  a  trained  non-professional  or  volunteer,  or
exercise interventions without supervision: e.g. providing exercise
instruction booklets, DVDs or tapes for people to use to exercise on
their own. We included exercise interventions whether they were
primarily aimed at reducing fear of falling or not.

How the intervention might work

Many  factors  may  contribute  to  fear  of  falling,  including  gait  and
balance impairment, age-related loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia),
activity  avoidance,  anxiety,  risk  factors  for  falling  (e.g.  visual
impairment)  and  previous  falls.  There  is  a  complex  relationship
between  fear  of  falling  and  falls  (Hadjistravropoulos  2007),  and
exercise  may  impact  directly  on  fear  of  falling  or  indirectly  on
factors associated with fear of falling and the risk of falling.

Exercise  has  been  shown  to  be  the  single  most  effective  strategy
to reduce the number of falls in older adults (Sherrington 2008b).
Exercise  may  reduce  muscle  loss,  improve  muscle  strength,
increase endurance, improve gait and balance and improve mood
(Bula  2011b;  Jung  2008).  It  may  increase  the  increase  the  ability
to  get  up  following  a  fall,  and  may  therefore,  through  these
mechanisms,  reduce  fear  of  falling  (Sherrington  2008b).  Exercise
may  also  enable  individuals  to  perform  more  daily  activities
without falling, leading to a more positive appraisal of their ability
to maintain balance during these activities (Howe 2011).

Why it is important to do this review

Fear  of  falling  is  associated  with  a  range  of  negative  health
consequences,  including  an  increased  risk  of  falls  (Delbaere
2010).  Delbaere  2010  suggested  that  fear  of  falling  can  lead  to
falls  independent  of  any  objective  balance  impairment.  Exercise
interventions  have  been  proposed  as  a  promising  means  for  the

prevention  of  falls  (Gillespie  2012b),  and  are  recommended  in
evidence-based  guidelines  for  fall  prevention  across  the  world.
Several  recent  reviews  have  been  published  on  similar  topics
(Bula  2011b;  Gillespie  2012b;  Howe  2011;  Liu  2009b;  McClure
2005; Zijlstra 2007), but few have specifically focused on exercise
and  its  potential  effect  on  fear  of  falling.  A  narrative  systematic
review  by  Zijlstra  and  colleagues  found  that  Tai  Chi  delivered  in
a  group  format,  home-based  exercise  interventions  and  multi-
component  falls-related  programmes  (some  of  which  included
exercise)  reduced  fear  of  falling  in  community-dwelling  older
people  (Zijlstra  2007).  This  review  also  found  that  only  three
included studies explicitly aimed to reduce fear of falling. A review
by  Bula  2011b  found  exercise  interventions  targeted  at  balance
confidence  risk  factors  and  which  decreased  activity  avoidance
to  be  effective  in  improving  balance  confidence.  Three  Cochrane
reviews  of  exercise  interventions  in  older  people  do  not  report
the  effect  of  interventions  on  fear  of  falling,  but  do  demonstrate
that  exercise  interventions  can  improve  balance  (Howe  2011),
reduce  the  risk  and  rate  of  falls  (Gillespie  2012b)  and  that
progressive resistance strength training improves muscle strength
and  activities  of  daily  living  such  as  walking  and  bathing  (Liu
2009b). One further review of co-ordinated community-wide multi-
strategy  initiatives,  some  of  which  included  the  promotion  of
physical  activity  or  community  walking  programmes,  found  that
the  population-based  approach  was  effective  in  preventing  fall-
related injury, but again the review did not report on fear of falling
(McClure 2005). This stresses the importance of our review, which
aimed to appraise the existing literature for evidence, or the lack of
evidence, that exercise reduces fear of falling.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We  included  only  randomised  and  quasi-randomised  (method  of
allocating participants to a treatment that is not strictly random,
e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number, alternation) controlled
trials.  We  included  studies  with  cluster  allocation,  but  excluded
those  with  only  one  or  two  clusters  in  each  intervention  group
because  randomisation  was  unlikely  to  achieve  balance  in  the
important prognostic factors between intervention groups.

Types of participants

We  included  trials  where  the  majority  of  the  study  population
comprised people aged 65 years and over who were 'community-
dwelling',  i.e.  living  either  at  home  or  in  places  of  residence  that
do  not  provide  nursing  care  or  rehabilitation.  We  excluded  trials
including  combined  populations  (i.e.  community-dwelling  older
people and those receiving nursing or rehabilitation care) if they did
not report separate results for community-dwelling adults. We also
excluded  trials  whose  populations  were  restricted  to  individuals
with a specific condition (e.g. stroke or hip fracture). We included
trials irrespective of whether the participants were people who had
recorded fear of falling or had a history of falling.

We 
interventions,  whether  an  exercise 
'prescription'  or  a
recommendation, done in a group or individually and supervised
or  not.  The  content  of  the  exercises  varied:  for  example,
gait,  balance  and  functional  training;  strength  or  resistance
training; 
flexibility  training;  3D  training  such  as  Tai  Chi,
Qigong  and  dance;  and  endurance  training,  which  comprised
aerobic  exercise  aimed  at  cardiovascular  fitness.  We  excluded
multi-component  interventions  that  combined  exercises  with
other  intervention  components  (such  as  medication  reviews,
home  hazard  assessments,  screening  for  and  managing  visual
impairment,  cognitive  behavioural 
interventions  and  other
interventions that aim to address risk factors for falling) due to the
difficulty of attributing observed effects to the exercise.

The comparators of interest included no intervention (usual care)
and  alternative  non-exercise  intervention,  e.g.  education.  We
excluded  studies  where  the  comparator  treatment  might  have
increased exercise, e.g. provision of lifestyle advice including advice
about exercise.

Types of outcome measures

We  included  trials  that  measured  fear  of  falling  as  a  primary  or
secondary outcome.

Primary outcomes

included
The  primary  outcome  was  fear  of  falling,  which 
measurement  using  single-item  measures  and  measures  of  falls
efficacy, balance confidence, and concern or worry about falling.

Measurement tools for these primary outcomes were ascertained
from a systematic review measuring psychological outcomes of fear
of  falling  (Jorstad  2005),  and  tools  developed  since  that  review
(Kempen  2008;  Yardley  2005).  Where  reported  by  the  included
studies, we used the following:

• Fear of falling as measured by a single-item question.
• Falls efficacy as measured by the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES; Tinetti
1990) and its associated versions, FmES (Hill 1996), rFES (Tinetti
1994), and FES-UK (Parry 2001).

• Balance  confidence  as  measured  by  the  Activities-specific
Balance  Confidence  scale  for  older  adults  (ABC)  (Powell  1995)
(and its UK version ABC-UK (Parry 2001)).

• Concern about falling as measured by the international version
of the FES in its long (FES-I) (Yardley 2005) and short forms (Short
FES-I)  (Kempen  2008),  Mobility  Efficacy  Scale  (MES)  (Lusardi
1997), aFES (Lusardi 1997), and amFES (Lusardi 1997), and worry
about falling measured using the Survey of Activities and Fear of
Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE) (Yardley 2002).

Secondary outcomes

• Occurrence  of  falls:  number  or  rate  of  falls,  or  participants
experiencing at least one fall (fallers). Falls were included as a
secondary outcome as there may be beneficial effects on falls
from exercise but they may also occur as adverse events during
exercise.

• Activity  avoidance  or  restriction:  the  modified  SAFFE  (Yardley
2002),  or  single  questions  asking  about  activity  avoidance
(Jorstad 2005).

• Anxiety:  Beck  Anxiety  Inventory,  the  anxiety  subscale  of  the

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group
Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled
Trials  (CENTRAL  2013,  Issue  7),  MEDLINE  (1946  to  July  Week  3
2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013),
PsycINFO  (1967  to  August  2013)  and  Allied  and  Complementary
Medicine  (AMED)  (1985  to  August  2013).  We  did  not  apply  any
restrictions based on language or publication status.

In  MEDLINE,  we  combined  the  subject-specific  terms  with  the
sensitivity-maximising  version  of  the  Cochrane  Highly  Sensitive
Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials (Lefebvre 2011).
Search  strategies  for  CENTRAL,  MEDLINE,  EMBASE,  CINAHL,
PsycINFO and AMED are shown in Appendix 1.

We searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(accessed 7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7
August 2013) for ongoing and recently completed trials.

Searching other resources

We searched reference lists of existing reviews on fear of falling as
well as falls prevention (Bula 2011b; Gillespie 2012b; Sherrington
2008b;  Zijlstra  2007),  and  the  reference  lists  of  studies  included
in the review (see Included studies). We contacted experts in the
field and relevant trial authors to identify appropriate unidentified
studies  (published  or  unpublished).  We  contacted  the  Falls  and
Bone  Section  of  the  British  Geriatrics  Society  for  information  on
unpublished or ongoing studies. We searched conference abstracts
from  the  55th,  56th  and  57th  Gerontological  Society  of  America
Scientific  Meetings  (2002  to  2004)  and  the  2004  Annual  Scientific
Meeting of the American Geriatrics Society.

Data collection and analysis

Review authors worked in pairs to independently assess studies for
eligibility, to extract data and to assess each study's risk of bias.

Selection of studies

Pairs  of  review  authors  (from  DK,  AK,  HC,  RZ,  DS,  JC,  ZS,  CB,
DH,  SG,  HG,  TM,  AB,  MP,  SI,  KD)  independently  checked  all
titles and abstracts retrieved to assess eligibility against inclusion
criteria.  We  obtained  full-text  copies  of  all  papers  considered  to
be potentially eligible. Disagreements were resolved by discussion
between  the  pairs  of  authors  and,  where  necessary,  a  third
review  author  (DK,  DS  or  SI).  We  contacted  authors  of  primary
studies  for  clarification  where  necessary.  We  used  a  hierarchy  of
reasons for exclusion, based in turn on the consideration of study

design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Usually only the
first  encountered  reason  for  exclusion  is  given  in  the  table  of
Characteristics  of  excluded  studies,  except  where  supplementary
reasons  were  also  informative.  For  clarity,  we  provide  more
details  of  interventions,  namely  multi-component  interventions
and comparator treatments that may have increased exercise.

Data extraction and management

Pairs of members of the review team (as listed above) completed
data  extraction  independently  using  a  standard  data  extraction
form.  Disagreements  were  resolved  by  discussion  between  the
pairs of review authors and where necessary, a third review author

(Higgins  2011a).  We  reported  the  following  seven  domains:
random  sequence  generation;  allocation  concealment;  blinding
(participants  and  personnel);  blinding  (outcome  assessment);
incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and 'other
bias'  (comparability  of  treatment  and  control  group  at  entry,
and  post-randomisation  recruitment  bias  in  studies  with  cluster
allocation).  Where  necessary,  we  contacted  study  authors  for
clarification. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between
the  pairs  of  review  authors  and  where  necessary,  a  third  review
author (DK, DS or SI).

Measures of treatment effect

We  estimated  risk  ratios  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  for
dichotomous  data.  For  continuous  data,  we  estimated  mean
differences (and 95% CI) where studies reported the same measure
in the same format and standardised mean differences (and 95%
CI) where different measures were used or where the same measure
was  presented  in  different  formats.  Where  cluster-randomised
controlled trials are included in the meta-analyses, we adjusted the
standard errors of effect sizes for clustering, and entered these into
meta-analyses  estimating  standardised  mean  differences.  Where
means  and  standard  deviations  are  reported  for  change  from
baseline  scores,  we  entered  these  into  meta-analyses  estimating
mean  differences  not  standardised  mean  differences.  One  study
reported a standard deviation of zero for the FES score at follow-up
(Yoo 2010): we used a standard deviation of 0.00001 to allow data
from this study to be included in the meta-analysis. We estimated
pooled  incidence  rate  ratios  (and  95%  CI)  for  falls  rates  using  an
inverse variance meta-analysis.

We  entered  raw  data  as  presented  in  the  articles,  or  as  obtained
from authors, into the meta-analyses. For falls rates, because most
studies did not report the number of falls and person time at risk,
we  calculated  log  incidence  rate  ratios  and  standard  errors  from
published  rate  ratios  and  entered  these  into  the  meta-analysis.
For  two  studies  (Weerdesteyn  2006;  Wolf  1996),  we  used  data
on  the  number  of  falls  and  person  time  at  risk  and  estimated
the  log  incidence  rate  ratio  and  its  standard  error  using  Poisson
regression in Stata v11.0. Weerdesteyn 2006 provided unpublished
data for this analysis; these excluded those from a non-randomised
group that were included in analyses in the published paper. For
Wolf 1996, we calculated the number of falls and person years at
risk  for  the  combined  intervention  groups  from  published  data.

For studies that employed a cross-over design, we used outcome
measurement scores prior to the cross-over to ensure the control
group  still  met  the  review  inclusion  criteria.  For  the  majority  of
scales  used  in  the  studies,  a  higher  score  represents  less  fear  of
falling. However, some studies used a scale where a higher score
means a higher fear of falling. Therefore, to correct for differences
in the direction of the scale, the mean scale score in studies using a
higher score to indicate a higher fear of falling was multiplied by -1
to ensure that all scales pointed in the same direction. The standard
deviation was not modified in these studies.

Unit of analysis issues

We  adjusted  the  standard  errors  for  effect  sizes  of  continuous
outcome  measures  to  take  account  of  clustering  in  cluster-
randomised trials. For fear of falling measures, we used the intra
cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% CI calculated from
the data of an ongoing UK trial evaluating an exercise intervention
for community-dwelling older people, which allocated participants
to  treatment  arm  by  general  practice  (Iliffe  2010b).  The  standard
error  of  the  effect  size  was  inflated  by  the  square  root  of  the
design effect, i.e. [1+ (m-1)*ICC], where m = average cluster size. For
depression measures, we used the ICC from a UK trial of exercise for
depression in older care home residents (Underwood 2013). Where
studies were adjusted for clustering, it was not possible to present
means and standard deviations for outcome measures in the forest
plots because the adjustment for clustering required data on the
adjusted standard error of the difference between the means to be
entered into the meta-analysis. We have therefore reported means
and standard deviations for fear of falling scales in Table 1 and for
depression scales in Table 2.

Where studies included more than one intervention arm that met
our inclusion criteria, we combined results from intervention arms
in  the  meta-analyses.  Where  appropriate  for  subgroup  analyses,
we  made  comparisons  separately  for  each  intervention  arm.  For
cross-over  trials,  we  incorporated  only  data  from  the  first  period
prior to cross-over. Some studies reported outcomes (fear of falling
and depression) at multiple time points. We therefore undertook
meta-analyses at several times points including immediately post
intervention,  short-term  follow-up  (less  than  six  months  post
intervention)  and  long-term  follow-up  (six  months  or  more  post
intervention).

Dealing with missing data

We  contacted  study  authors  for  missing  data.  Where  standard
deviations were not reported, but 95% CI were reported, we divided
the CI width by 3.92, and multiplied by the square root of the sample
size (Higgins 2011b). We used only the available data and did not
impute missing values.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity between effect sizes of included studies
by  visual  inspection  of  forest  plots  and  by  using  the  Chi2  test  for
heterogeneity (with a P value of < 0.1) and described inconsistency
between  trials  using  the  percentage  of  the  variability  in  effect
estimates  that  is  due  to  heterogeneity  rather  than  chance  (I2
statistic).

Assessment of reporting biases

Where an individual meta-analysis contained at least 10 studies, we
assessed publication bias using funnel plots and Egger's test.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Data synthesis

We  combined  effect  sizes  across  studies  using  the  fixed-effect
model  where  there  was  no  statistical  heterogeneity.  Where  there
was statistically significant heterogeneity that could not readily be
explained, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to incorporate
heterogeneity among studies. We pooled data across intervention
arms for trials that had more than one intervention arm of interest.
However, where appropriate for the subgroup analysis, we made
comparisons separately for each intervention arm.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Where  a  minimum  of  two  studies  existed,  we  undertook  the
following a priori defined subgroup analyses, exploring the effect
of  exercise  interventions  on  fear  of  falling  immediately  post
intervention by:

1. type  of  exercise  classified  using  the  ProFaNE  taxonomy  of

interventions (ProFaNE 2011);

2. type  of  control  group  (alternative  intervention  versus  no

intervention);

3. baseline  falls  risk  (studies  recruiting  participants  at  increased
risk of falls, e.g. history of falls or other risk factors for falls versus
those not recruiting participants on this basis);

4. type (individual versus group), frequency (one to three times per
week, four or more times per week) and duration (0 to 12 weeks,
13 to 26 weeks, more than 26 weeks) of exercise;

5. primary aim of the study (to reduce fear of falling versus other

primary aim).

investigated  whether  effect  sizes 

We 
in  subgroups  were
significantly  different  by  inspecting  the  overlap  of  confidence
intervals and by using the test for subgroup differences available in
Review Manager software (RevMan 2014).

We did not undertake two a priori defined subgroup analyses for
reasons explained in Differences between protocol and review.

Sensitivity analysis

We  had  planned  to  undertake  sensitivity  analyses  to  explore
the  robustness  of  our  findings  by  restricting  analyses  to  studies
at  low  risk  of  selection  bias  (those  with  adequate  allocation
concealment)  and  those  at  low  risk  of  detection  bias.  We  did
undertake a sensitivity analysis based on attrition bias (restricting
to  studies  with  follow-up  on  more  than  80%  of  participants).  We
also  undertook  three  other  sensitivity  analyses:  (a)  assessing  the
effect of removing one study that had a much larger effect size than
other studies, (b) assessing the effect of using ABC scores instead of
FES scores for two studies that used both scales and (c) assessing
the effect of varying the ICC used to adjust standard errors of effect
sizes in cluster-randomised controlled trials.

'Summary of findings' tables

We have produced a 'Summary of findings' table for fear of falling
post  intervention.  We  used  the  GRADE  approach  (Chapter  12.2,
Higgins  2011a)  to  assess  the  quality  of  evidence  related  to  key
outcomes: fear of falling, falls rate, occurrence of at least one fall,
depressive symptoms, anxiety and physical activity.

Included studies

Design

Thirty studies have been included in this review (see Characteristics
of included studies for details of these). The majority of the studies
were randomised controlled trials (n = 29), including two cluster-
randomised controlled trials (Reinsch 1992; Resnick 2008), and two
cross-over trials (Lai 2013; Wallsten 2006). One study was a quasi-
randomised trial (Lajoie 2004).

Aim

The  primary  aim  of  seven  studies  was  to  reduce  fear  of  falling
(Freiberger  2012;  Halvarsson  2011;  Karinkanta  2012;  McCormack
2004; Wallsten 2006; Yoo 2010; Zhang 2006). The primary aim of the
majority (n = 22) of the included studies was to improve balance,
physical performance and/or prevent falls (Barnett 2003; Campbell
1997;  Clemson  2010;  Haines  2009;  Hinman  2002;  Lai  2013;  Lajoie
2004; Lin 2007; Logghe 2009; Nguyen 2012; Reinsch 1992; Rendon
2012; Sihvonen 2004; Tiedemann 2012; Ullmann 2010; Vogler 2009;
Vrantsidis 2009; Weerdesteyn 2006; Westlake 2007; Wolf 1996; Wolf
2001; Yang 2012). One study was aimed at improving self efficacy
for  exercise,  exercise  outcome  expectations,  exercise  and  overall
physical activity (Resnick 2008).

Sample sizes

A total of 2878 community-dwelling older adults participated in the
30 included studies. Sample sizes in included studies ranged from
21 participants (Yoo 2010) to 269 (Logghe 2009).

Setting

The  included  studies  were  based  in  12  countries.  Eight  studies
were conducted in Australia (Barnett 2003; Clemson 2010; Haines
2009;  McCormack  2004;  Tiedemann  2012;  Vogler  2009;  Vrantsidis
2009;  Yang  2012),  seven  in  the  USA  (Hinman  2002;  Reinsch  1992;
Rendon  2012;  Resnick  2008;  Ullmann  2010;  Wallsten  2006;  Wolf
1996), three in the Netherlands (Logghe 2009; Weerdesteyn 2006;
Wolf  2001),  two  in  Canada  (Lajoie  2004;  Westlake  2007),  two  in
Finland (Karinkanta 2012; Sihvonen 2004), two in Taiwan (Lai 2013;
Lin 2007), one in China (Zhang 2006), one in Germany (Freiberger
2012),  one  in  New  Zealand  (Campbell  1997),  one  in  South  Korea
(Yoo 2010), one in Sweden (Halvarsson 2011), and one in Vietnam
(Nguyen 2012).

Participants

Four  studies  recruited  only  women  (Campbell  1997;  Karinkanta
2012;  Sihvonen  2004;  Yoo  2010).  Of  the  26  studies  that  recruited
both sexes, 25 reported the sex of participants, with most of these
including  a  majority  of  women  (ranging  from  51%  to  89%).  The
mean  age  of  participants  ranged  from  68  years  to  85  years.  In  12
studies the mean age was less than 75 years (Barnett 2003; Hinman
2002; Karinkanta 2012; Lai 2013; Lajoie 2004; Nguyen 2012; Resnick
2008;  Tiedemann  2012;  Vrantsidis  2009;  Weerdesteyn  2006;  Yoo
2010; Zhang 2006); in all other studies the mean age was 75 years or
older. Two studies specifically recruited people aged over 75 (Wolf
2001) and over 80 (Campbell 1997).

Twelve studies recruited participants who were at increased risk of
falls (either because they had previously fallen or because they had
other risk factors for falls) (Barnett 2003; Clemson 2010; Freiberger
2012; Haines 2009; Halvarsson 2011; Lin 2007; Logghe 2009; Vogler
2009; Vrantsidis 2009; Weerdesteyn 2006; Yang 2012; Zhang 2006).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Three of these studies recruited participants who had fear of falling
in  addition  to  being  at  increased  risk  of  falls  (Freiberger  2012;
Halvarsson 2011; Yang 2012). The inclusion and exclusion criteria
for  each  study  are  presented  in  the  Characteristics  of  included
studies table.

Interventions

Five  studies  had  more  than  one  intervention  arm  that  met  the
inclusion criteria (Hinman 2002; Karinkanta 2012; McCormack 2004;
Vogler 2009; Wolf 1996). As a result, 36 interventions were reported
from  the  30  included  studies.  We  classified  these  interventions
according to the fall prevention classification taxonomy developed
by ProFaNE (ProFaNE 2011), with nine (25%) classified as 3D (Tai
Chi,  Yoga);  19  (53%)  classified  as  gait,  balance,  co-ordination,
functional  tasks;  and  eight  (22%)  classified  as  strength  and
resistance based interventions. Interventions were also categorised
according to whether they were supervised activities (n = 27; 75%)
or unsupervised activities (n = 9; 25%), see Table 3. Additionally, we
categorised interventions by whether they were delivered in group
settings (n = 20; 56%) or individually (n = 16; 44%), and according to
the duration of the intervention (i.e. up to 12 weeks (n = 22; 61%),
13 to 26 weeks (n = 7; 19%) and more than 26 weeks (n = 7; 19%).
The  majority  (n  =  32;  89%)  of  the  exercise  interventions  were  to
be  performed  between  one  to  three  times  per  week.  Four  (11%)
exercise interventions were to be carried out four or more times a
week. Details are provided in the Characteristics of included studies
table.

Controls

Twenty  of  the  studies  compared  an  exercise  intervention  with
no  intervention  (see  Table  3).  Five  studies  used  education  as
the  control  intervention:  three  on  falls  prevention  (Barnett  2003;
Tiedemann 2012; Westlake 2007), one on nutrition (Resnick 2008),
and one on a range of topics including medicines, sleep, cognitive
impairment and bereavement (Wolf 1996). Two studies used social
home visits (Campbell 1997; Vogler 2009), one used individualised
crafts/games  (Wolf  2001),  one  used  home  safety  assessment  (Lin
2007), and one used discussion groups (Reinsch 1992).

Outcomes

Seven  studies  used  single-item  questions  for  participants  to
measure fear of falling. Four of these studies asked participants to
rate their fear of falling on a numerical scale: Resnick 2008 used a
numerical scale of 0 to 4 (0 = low, 4 = high); Karinkanta 2012 and Wolf
2001 used a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no fear of falling)
to 100 mm (very afraid of falling); and Lin 2007 used a VAS from 0
(no fear) to 10 cm (extremely fearful). One study measured worry
about falling on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = not at all worried, 5 = extremely
worried) (Reinsch 1992). Two studies employed a single question
with binary or ordinal response for fear of falling: in Barnett 2003
participants were asked if they were afraid of falling (yes/no) and in
Sihvonen 2004 participants were asked "Generally speaking are you
afraid of falling?" with the response options of "No", "Yes, some"
or  "Yes,  a  lot".  Falls  efficacy  was  measured  by  FES  in  six  studies
(Campbell  1997;  Logghe  2009;  Nguyen  2012;  Ullmann  2010;  Wolf
1996; Zhang 2006), MFES in seven studies (Clemson 2010; Hinman
2002; Lai 2013; McCormack 2004; Vogler 2009; Vrantsidis 2009; Yang
2012), and K-FES in one study (Yoo 2010). Nine studies measured
balance  confidence  using  ABC  (Clemson  2010;  Freiberger  2012;
Haines  2009;  Lajoie  2004;  Rendon  2012;  Ullmann  2010;  Wallsten
2006;  Weerdesteyn  2006;  Westlake  2007).  Two  studies  used  both

FES and ABC (Clemson 2010; Ullmann 2010). Concerns about falling
were measured by FES-I in one study (Halvarsson 2011) and short
FES-I in one study (Tiedemann 2012).

All  studies  reported  fear  of  falling  immediately  at  the  end  of  the
intervention period, apart from Barnett 2003, which reported fear
of  falling  halfway  through  the  one-year  intervention  period,  and
Lin  2007,  which  reported  fear  of  falling  at  two  and  four  months
after the end of the intervention period. Six studies reported fear
of falling in the short term (less than six months) post intervention
(Clemson  2010;  Lin  2007;  Vogler  2009;  Westlake  2007;  Wolf  1996;
Wolf 2001). Clemson 2010 reported data at three and six months.
We included the three-month data from Clemson 2010 and the two-
month data from Lin 2007 in our short-term follow-up (less than six
months) analyses. These were most similar to the other studies in
the  same  analyses,  which  reported  data  at  one  or  three  months.
Three studies reported fear of falling in the long term (six months or
more post intervention) (Freiberger 2012; Karinkanta 2012; Logghe
2009). Freiberger 2012 reported fear of falling at two time points in
the long term (six months and 18 months post intervention), and we
used the six-month scores in the meta-analysis as the other studies
in the meta-analysis reported data at nine or 12 months.

Eight studies either did not present data for outcome measures in
the  format  required  for  meta-analysis  (i.e.  mean,  SDs)  or  did  not
report  data  for  their  measures  of  fear  of  falling  (Clemson  2010;
Halvarsson 2011; Lajoie 2004; Rendon 2012; Ullmann 2010; Vogler
2009;  Wallsten  2006;  Weerdesteyn  2006).  We  were  able  to  obtain
the  data  from  study  authors  for  seven  of  these  studies  (Clemson
2010;  Halvarsson  2011;  Lajoie  2004;  Ullmann  2010;  Vogler  2009;
Wallsten 2006; Weerdesteyn 2006), enabling their inclusion in the
meta-analyses. Clemson 2010 provided means and SDs for M-FES
and  ABC  scores  at  baseline,  post  intervention  and  three  months
post  intervention.  Halvarsson  2011  provided  means  and  SDs  for
FES-I and GDS-20 scores at baseline and post intervention. Lajoie
2004  provided  means  and  SDs  for  the  ABC  score  at  baseline  and
post intervention. Ullmann 2010 provided means and SDs for the
ABC  and  FES  at  baseline  and  prior  to  six  participants  form  the
control group crossing over into the intervention group. Vogler 2009
provided means and SDs for the MFES and GDS post intervention
and  at  24  weeks.  Wallsten  2006  provided  means  and  SDs  for  the
ABC  post  intervention.  Weerdesteyn  2006  provided  means  and
SDs for ABC post intervention and number of falls and number of
participants experiencing at least one fall at seven-month follow-
up for the randomised exercise group. We were not able to obtain
data  in  a  format  suitable  for  inclusion  in  the  meta-analyses  for
fear  of  falling  from  Rendon  2012,  which  presented  medians  and
ranges (not SDs) for the ABC and GDS scores at baseline and post
intervention.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Excluded studies

We excluded a total of 134 studies (144 articles) for the following
main  reasons:  they  were  not  RCTs  or  quasi-RCTs  (n  =  53);  the
majority  of  participants  were  not  aged  65  years  and  over  (n  =  3),
participants  were  in  nursing  or  rehabilitation  care  (n  =  4)  or  the
study  population  was  restricted  to  a  specific  condition  (n  =  4);
they did not contain an exercise intervention (n = 3), they involved
multi-component interventions (n = 31) or it was plausible that the
comparator group might have increased exercise (n = 24); or fear of
falling was not measured (n = 12). More details are provided in the
Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Ongoing studies

Two  ongoing  studies  (published  in  three  articles)  met  the  review
criteria  (see  Characteristics  of  ongoing  studies).  The  first  study  is
a  multicentre  cluster-randomised  controlled  trial  of  two  exercise
intervention groups compared with a no intervention control group
in  community-dwelling  older  people  aged  65  years  and  older  in
the UK (Iliffe 2010b). Fear of falling will be measured by the Short
FES-I. The other ongoing study is a multicentre cluster-randomised
controlled trial of a 16-week exercise programme with a focus on
falls prevention compared with a no intervention control group in
community-dwelling older people in Germany (NCT01032252). Fear
of falling will be measured with the German version of the FES-I.

Seven  studies  are  awaiting  classification  (see  Characteristics  of
studies awaiting classification). It is plausible but unclear whether
the  comparator  group  treatment  in  these  studies  may  have
increased  exercise  and  further  details  are  required  to  enable  a
decision regarding their inclusion or exclusion. Four studies used
awareness  or  education  programmes  that  included  advice  about
exercise  (Arai  2007;  Brouwer  2003;  Morris  2008;  Wolf  2003);  one
study provided social activities that included walking (Kim 2009b);
one  study  invited  all  participants  (including  the  control  group)
to  practice  exercise  techniques  before  randomisation  (Henwood
2008), and one study provided the control group with ethylene vinyl
acetate  copolymer  shoe  insoles  and  explicitly  stated  that  these
would improve postural balance (Jorgensen 2013).

Risk of bias in included studies

We assessed studies for risk of bias and the findings are reported in
the tables of Characteristics of included studies. See Figure 2 for the
'Risk of bias' summary and Figure 3 for the 'Risk of bias' graph.

Allocation

Apart  from  the  one  quasi-randomised  trial,  all  other  studies
reported  that  they  allocated  participants  to  the  intervention  and
control  groups  randomly.  We  judged  the  risk  of  bias  in  random
sequence  generation  to  be  'low'  if  a  random  component  in  the
sequence generation process was used (e.g. random number table,
computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards
or envelopes, throwing dice) and 'high' if a systematic non-random
component  was  used  in  the  sequence  generation  process  (e.g.
allocation by odd or even date of birth, by some algorithm based
on date (or day) of admission, by alternation). We judged the risk
of  bias  in  random  sequence  generation  to  be  low  in  40%  (12/30)
of studies (Campbell 1997; Clemson 2010; Freiberger 2012; Haines

2009; Karinkanta 2012; Logghe 2009; Resnick 2008; Sihvonen 2004;
Tiedemann  2012;  Vogler  2009;  Wolf  1996;  Yang  2012),  high  in
3%  (1/30)  of  studies  (Lajoie  2004),  and  unclear  in  the  remaining
57%  (17/30)  of  studies  (Barnett  2003;  Halvarsson  2011;  Hinman
2002; Lai 2013; Lin 2007; McCormack 2004; Nguyen 2012; Reinsch
1992; Rendon 2012; Ullmann 2010; Vrantsidis 2009; Wallsten 2006;
Weerdesteyn  2006;  Westlake  2007;  Wolf  2001;  Yoo  2010;  Zhang
2006).

We  judged  the  risk  of  bias  in  allocation  concealment  to  be  low
if  participants  and  investigators  enrolling  participants  could  not
foresee  assignment  (e.g.  sequentially  numbered,  opaque,  sealed
envelopes)  and  high  if  participants  or  investigators  enrolling
participants  could  possibly  foresee  assignments  (e.g.  use  of  an

open  random  allocation  schedule).  We  judged  the  risk  of  bias  in
allocation concealment to be low in 7% (2/30) of studies (Campbell
1997; Haines 2009), high in 10% (3/30) of studies (Clemson 2010;
Halvarsson  2011;  Lajoie  2004),  and  unclear  in  83%  (25/30)  of
included  studies  (Barnett  2003;  Freiberger  2012;  Hinman  2002;
Karinkanta 2012; Lai 2013; Lin 2007; Logghe 2009; McCormack 2004;
Nguyen 2012; Reinsch 1992; Rendon 2012; Resnick 2008; Sihvonen
2004; Tiedemann 2012; Ullmann 2010; Vogler 2009; Vrantsidis 2009;
Wallsten 2006; Weerdesteyn 2006; Westlake 2007; Wolf 1996; Wolf
2001; Yang 2012; Yoo 2010; Zhang 2006). We judged only two studies
to be at low risk of bias for both random sequence generation and
allocation concealment (Campbell 1997; Haines 2009). We judged
the single quasi-randomised controlled trial to be at high risk of bias
for both random sequence generation and allocation concealment
(Lajoie 2004).

Blinding

Participants were not blinded to the treatment group allocation (as
the intervention was exercise), hence we judged all studies as being
at high risk of performance bias. Outcome measurements were self
reported so participants completed these knowing their allocation
and we therefore judged all studies to be at high risk of detection
bias.

Incomplete outcome data

We  judged  the  risk  of  attrition  bias  to  be  low  in  57%  (17/30)  of
studies  (Barnett  2003;  Campbell  1997;  Haines  2009;  Halvarsson
2011; Hinman 2002; Karinkanta 2012; Lai 2013; Lajoie 2004; Rendon
2012; Sihvonen 2004; Tiedemann 2012; Ullmann 2010; Vogler 2009;
Vrantsidis  2009;  Weerdesteyn  2006;  Wolf  1996;  Zhang  2006),  with
outcome  data  in  these  studies  reported  for  80%  or  more  of  the
original  sample  in  each  arm  of  the  trial.  We  judged  the  risk  of
attrition bias to be high in 40% (12/30) of studies (Clemson 2010;
Freiberger 2012; Lin 2007; Logghe 2009; McCormack 2004; Nguyen
2012; Reinsch 1992; Resnick 2008; Wallsten 2006; Wolf 2001; Yang
2012;  Yoo  2010),  and  unclear  in  3%  (1/30)  of  included  studies
(Westlake 2007).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Selective reporting

We judged the majority of studies (80%; 24/30) to be at unclear risk
of reporting bias because it was not possible to tell from the article if
all prespecified outcomes had been reported. We judged 17% (5/30)
of studies to be at high risk because data were not reported on all
prespecified outcomes (Clemson 2010; Halvarsson 2011; Wallsten
2006; Wolf 1996; Wolf 2001), and we judged the remaining 3% (1/30)
to be at low risk because the protocol was available and data were
reported for all prespecified outcomes (Logghe 2009).

Other potential sources of bias

We judged the risk of other bias to be low in 13% (4/30) of studies
(Campbell 1997; Halvarsson 2011; Vogler 2009; Yoo 2010), where the
study appeared to be free any other source of bias, and unclear in
the remaining 87% (26/30) of included studies.

Effects of interventions

See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Exercise for
reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community

Exercise versus control (no intervention or alternative non-
exercise intervention)

Primary outcome: fear of falling

Effect of exercise interventions immediately post intervention

We  pooled  data  from  24  studies  in  a  meta-analysis  for  fear  of
falling. The means and standard deviations (SDs) for each study are
shown in Table 1. Combining effect sizes for all fear of falling scales
(Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) (all versions), Activities-specific Balance
Confidence (ABC) scale, plus other numerical scales) showed that
exercise  interventions  were  associated  with  a  small  to  moderate
and statistically significant reduction in fear of falling (standardised
mean  difference  (SMD)  0.37,  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  0.18  to
0.56;  24  studies,  1692  participants;  Analysis  1.1;  Figure  4).  There
was significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi2 = 75.01, df
= 23, P value < 0.00001, I2 = 69%). Pooled effect sizes did not differ
significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of
falling (test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 5.21, df = 3, P value =
0.16).

Figure 4.   Forest plot: Exercise versus control: primary outcome - fear of falling, post intervention

Two studies measured fear of falling using both the FES and ABC
(Clemson  2010;  Ullmann  2010).  We  used  FES  scores  in  the  main
analysis and undertook a sensitivity analysis replacing FES scores
with ABC scores for these two studies, with similar findings (SMD
0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53; 24 studies, 1692 participants; analysis not
shown).

Two  studies  were  cluster-RCTs  (Reinsch  1992;  Resnick  2008),  for
which  the  standard  error  of  the  SMD  was  inflated  as  described
above using an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) (ICC 0.02,
95%  CI  0.00  to  0.05)  calculated  from  a  cluster-RCT  investigating
community-based  exercise  interventions  in  older  people  with
randomisation  by  General  Practitioner  practice  (average  cluster
size 25) (Iliffe 2010b). A sensitivity analysis showed that using the
lower  or  upper  95%  CI  for  the  ICC  did  not  change  the  results
compared with using an ICC of 0.02: the same result (SMD 0.37, 95%
CI 0.18 to 0.56) applied with either an ICC of 0 or analysis with an
ICC of 0.05.

One  study,  Nguyen  2012  (73  participants),  had  a  much  larger
effect size than other studies in the meta-analysis. We undertook
a sensitivity analysis excluding this outlier study. Without Nguyen
2012,  exercise  interventions  were  still  associated  with  a  small
to  moderate,  and  statistically  significant,  improvement  in  fear
of  falling  immediately  post  intervention  (SMD  0.24,  95%  CI  0.12
to  0.36;  23  studies,  1619  participants).  There  was  no  significant
heterogeneity  between  effect  sizes  after  removing  Nguyen  2012
from  the  meta-analysis  (Chi2  =  28.67,  df  =  22,  P  value  =  0.15;  I2  =
23%).

Six studies with a total of 666 participants were not included in the
meta-analysis. One study was not included because it did not report
fear of falling immediately post intervention (Lin 2007; results for
85 participants). Two studies used single-question measures with
binary  or  ordinal  responses  for  measuring  fear  of  falling  (Barnett
2003;  Sihvonen  2004).  Barnett  2003  (results  for  137  participants)
reported that the percentage of participants reporting fear of falling

did not differ significantly between treatment groups (intervention
group = 7.5%, control group = 8.6%, P value not reported). However,
Sihvonen  2004  (results  for  27  participants),  found  a  significant
reduction from baseline in the intervention group (10% reporting
high  fear  of  falling  post  intervention  versus  25%  at  baseline,  P
value  =  0.02)  but  no  difference  in  the  control  arm  (14%  at  both
baseline  and  post  intervention,  P  value  not  reported).  Wolf  1996
(results for 165 participants) was not included in the meta-analysis
because  FES  scores  were  reported  grouped  into  four  categories
(from  'not  at  all  afraid'  to  'very  afraid').  This  three-arm  study
found  a  significant  difference  in  change  from  baseline  between
the  three  groups  in  an  analysis  that  included  data  at  both  post
intervention  and  four  months  post  intervention.  In  the  Tai  Chi
group, the percentage not at all afraid of falling increased from 43%
at baseline to 53% post intervention and reduced to 47% at four-
month  follow-up;  in  the  balance  training  group,  the  percentages
at baseline, post intervention and four-month follow-up were 29%,
27%  and  33%;  and  in  the  control  group,  these  were  44%,  35%
and  41%,  respectively  (reported  P  value  =  0.046).  Campbell  1997
(results for 212 participants) was not included in the meta-analysis
as  standard  deviations  (SDs)  for  the  FES  were  reported  only  for
change  from  baseline  scores.  This  study  reported  a  significant
increase  in  fear  of  falling  post  intervention  for  the  control  group
compared with the intervention group (difference in mean change
from baseline 3.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 6.8, P value not reported). Rendon
2012  (results  for  40  participants)  was  not  included  in  the  meta-
analysis  as  only  medians  and  ranges  were  reported  for  the  ABC.
The  study  reported  significantly  improved  balance  confidence  in
the  intervention  group  compared  with  the  control  group  (post
intervention  median  (range)  intervention  group  =  78.8  (55.0  to
96.9), control group = 76.9 (45.0 to 100.0), reported P value = 0.04).

Effect of exercise interventions on fear of falling up to and beyond six
months post intervention

Seven of the studies that reported fear of falling at follow-up times
beyond  post  intervention  provided  data  that  could  be  included
in a meta-analysis. Exercise interventions were associated with a
small  but  statistically  non-significant  reduction  in  fear  of  falling
at  short-term  follow-up  (less  than  six  months  post  end  of  the
intervention  period)  (SMD  0.17,  95%  CI  -0.05  to  0.38;  P  value  =
0.12; four studies; 356 participants; Analysis 1.2). Two studies could
not be included in the meta-analysis. Westlake 2007 reported data
at two-month follow-up only for the intervention group. The data
from Wolf 1996 at four-month follow-up is reported under the post
intervention  results  above  as  the  analyses  combines  both  time
points. At long-term follow-up (six or more months post end of the
intervention period), exercise interventions were associated with a
small reduction in fear of falling of borderline statistical significance
(SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; P value = 0.06, three studies; 386
participants; Analysis 1.3). There was no significant heterogeneity
between effect sizes at short-term follow-up (Chi2 = 2.86, df = 3, P
value = 0.41; I2 = 0%) or long-term follow-up (Chi2 = 0.78, df = 2, P
value = 0.68; I2 = 0%).

Sensitivity analyses: effect of exercise interventions immediately post
intervention

We did not undertake a sensitivity analysis restricting to studies at
low risk of bias from allocation concealment as this applied to only
one  study  that  was  included  in  the  meta-analysis  (Haines  2009).
We were also unable to undertake sensitivity analyses restricting to
studies at low risk of detection bias as we judged no studies to be
at low risk. Restricting analyses to the 12 studies (802 participants)

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

judged to be at low risk of attrition bias produced similar results
(SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 12 studies, 802 participants; analysis
not shown) to the analysis including all studies (SMD 0.37, 95% CI
0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies, 1692 participants; Analysis 1.1).

Subgroup analyses: effect of exercise interventions immediately post
intervention

We  performed  seven  subgroup  analyses.  We  also  examined  the
effect  of  removing  the  extreme  outlier  trial,  Nguyen  2012,  and
illustrate below instances where its removal demonstrated the lack
of robustness of findings of potential subgroup differences.

The  available  evidence  did  not  show  that  the  effect  of  exercise
interventions  on  fear  of  falling  varied  by  type  of  exercise
intervention (3D (Tai Chi); gait, balance, co-ordination, functional
task exercises; strength and resistance exercises); test for subgroup
differences:  Chi2  =  3.46,  df  =  2,  P  value  =  0.18;  Analysis  2.1).  Two
studies  were  excluded  from  this  subgroup  analysis  as  we  used
combined  data  from  more  than  one  intervention  group  in  our
analysis  and  the  intervention  groups  provided  different  types  of
exercise (Karinkanta 2012; McCormack 2004).

The  effect  of  exercise  interventions  on  fear  of  falling  may  be
smaller in studies where the control group received an alternative
intervention (e.g. education, social visits, craft activities, discussion
groups; SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.29; six studies, 499 participants)
compared  with  those  where  the  control  group  received  no
intervention  (SMD  0.48,  95%  CI  0.22  to  0.73;  18  studies,  1199
participants) as shown by the test for subgroup differences: Chi2 =
5.45, df = 1, P value = 0.02; Analysis 2.2). Although plausible, these
subgroup results should be interpreted with caution as the 95% CI
for the subgroup effect sizes overlap and removal of Nguyen 2012
markedly reduces the difference: Chi2 = 2.83, df = 1, P value = 0.09
(analysis not shown).

The  available  evidence  did  not  show  that  the  effect  of  exercise
interventions  on  fear  of  falling  differed  between  studies  that  did
not  recruit  participants  on  the  basis  of  increased  falls  risk  (14
studies, 926 participants) and those which did recruit participants
at  increased  risk  of  falls  (10  studies,  772  participants);  test  for
subgroup differences: Chi2 = 1.18, df = 1, P value = 0.28; Analysis 2.3).

The effect of exercise interventions on fear of falling may be greater
where  exercise  interventions  are  delivered  in  groups  (SMD  0.49,
95%  CI  0.22  to  0.76;  15  studies,  1051  participants)  than  those
delivered to individuals (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06, 0.35; nine studies,
647 participants); test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 3.99, df = 1, P
value = 0.05; Analysis 2.4). However, these subgroup results should
be interpreted with caution as the 95% CI for the subgroup effect
sizes  overlap,  the  effect  is  marginal  and  removal  of  Nguyen  2012
markedly reduces the difference: Chi2 = 1.46, df = 1, P value = 0.23
(analysis not shown).

The  available  evidence  did  not  show  that  the  effect  of  exercise
interventions  on  fear  of  falling  varied  according  to  exercise
frequency  (one  to  three  times  per  week;  four  or  more  times  per
week); test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 0.20, df = 1, P value =
0.66; Analysis 2.5). The same lack of difference between subgroups
was observed when subgrouping by duration of interventions (up
to 12 weeks; 13 to 26 weeks; more than 26 weeks); test for subgroup
differences: Chi2 = 0.88, df = 2, P value = 0.64; Analysis 2.6; and when
subgrouping by primary aim of study (to reduce fear of falling; other

primary  aim);  test  for  subgroup  differences:  Chi2  =  0.17,  df  =  2,  P

Publication bias: effect of exercise interventions immediately post
intervention

The funnel plot for fear of falling post intervention and the Egger's
test  (bias  coefficient  2.98,  95%  CI  0.68  to  5.28;  P  value  =  0.01)

indicates  funnel  plot  asymmetry  suggesting  publication  bias  due
to small studies with negative findings that we failed to identify in
our review (see Figure 5). Also of note is that the most extreme data
point on the right is that of Nguyen 2012.

Figure 5.   Exercise versus control: primary outcome - fear of falling, post intervention (see Figure 4 for forest plot)

Secondary outcomes

For  all  outcomes  described  below  (occurrence  of  falls,  activity
avoidance or restriction, depression, anxiety, exercise compliance
or  adherence  and  physical  activity)  it  is  important  to  remember
that  our  included  studies  do  not  represent  the  totality  of  the
evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on these outcomes,
as  our  review  only  includes  studies  that  measured  fear  of  falling
as an outcome. These outcomes have been included in our review
because they may help explain why exercise interventions were or
were not effective in reducing fear of falling.

Occurrence of falls

Exercise interventions were associated with a significant reduction
in the proportion of participants having at least one fall (risk ratio
(RR)  0.85,  95%  CI  0.74  to  0.98;  nine  studies;  1113  participants;
Analysis 3.1). There was no significant heterogeneity between effect
sizes  (Chi2  =  2.50,  df  =  8,  P  value  =  0.96;  I2  =  0%).  The  follow-up
periods in these studies varied from immediately post intervention
to  11  months  post  intervention.  Reinsch  1992  (107  participants
at  baseline)  was  not  included  in  the  meta-analysis  because  the
number of participants for whom falls data were available at follow-
up was not reported. This study reported the results of a survival
analysis of time to first fall, stating only that there was no significant
difference between study groups (P value = 0.53).

Occurrence  of  at  least  one  fall  was  reported  in  nine  studies
(Barnett 2003; Campbell 1997; Clemson 2010; Haines 2009; Logghe
2009; Sihvonen 2004; Vogler 2009; Weerdesteyn 2006; Yang 2012).

Nine studies reporting data on falls rates were included in the meta-
analysis  (Barnett  2003;  Campbell  1997;  Clemson  2010;  Freiberger
2012;  Haines  2009;  Logghe  2009;  Sihvonen  2004;  Weerdesteyn

2006;  Wolf  1996).  Exercise  interventions  were  associated  with  a
significantly  lower  falls  rate  (IRR  0.68,  95%  CI  0.53  to  0.87;  nine
studies; 1121 participants; Analysis 3.2), but there was significant
heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi2 = 18.72, df = 8, P value =
0.02; I2 = 57%). The follow-up periods in these studies varied from
immediately post intervention to 20 months post intervention. One
study  (Lin  2007;  85  participants)  was  not  included  in  the  meta-
analysis  as  it  did  not  report  rate  ratios  or  data  from  which  we
could calculate falls rates. This study reported falls rates of 1.6/1000
person years in the intervention group and 1.1/1000 person years
in  the  control  group  (home  safety  assessment  and  modification
group). No further figures or P values are reported.

Activity avoidance or restriction

No  information  was  provided  on  activity  avoidance  or  restriction
using  the  modified  Survey  of  Activities  and  Fear  of  Falling  in  the
Elderly (SAFFE) or single questions asking about activity avoidance
in any of the studies.

Depression

Depressive symptoms were measured in seven studies, using the
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Rendon 2012; Vogler 2009), GDS-5
(Resnick 2008), GDS-15 (Lin 2007), GDS-20 (Halvarsson 2011), the
depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS)  (Wolf  2001),  and  the  Center  for  Epidemiologic  Studies
-  Depression  (CES-D)  scale  (Wolf  1996).  Notably,  five  of  these
studies  had  'active'  control  interventions.  This  was  education  on
nutrition in Resnick 2008; education on a range of topics including
medicines, sleep, cognitive impairment and bereavement in Wolf
1996; social home visits in Vogler 2009; individualised crafts/games
in Wolf 2001; and home safety assessment in Lin 2007.

immediately  post
Four  studies  reported  depression  scores 
intervention  (Halvarsson  2011;  Resnick  2008;  Vogler  2009;  Wolf
2001), as shown in Table 2. Exercise interventions did not appear
to reduce depression scores (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.13; four
studies; 406 participants; Analysis 3.3) and there was no significant
heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi2 = 5.19, df = 3, P value = 0.16;
I2 = 42%).

One study was a cluster-RCT (Resnick 2008); the standard error was
inflated to account for clustering as described above using the ICC
of 0.03 from a cluster-RCT investigating exercise for depression in
older care home residents with the GD-15 (Underwood 2013). This
trial reported two ICCs, both without 95% CI (an ICC of 0.00 at 12
months and an ICC of 0.03 at six months in participants who were
depressed at baseline). We used the ICC of 0.03 in the analysis and
undertook a sensitivity analysis using an ICC of zero. Findings were
very similar using ICCs of 0.03 (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.13; four
studies; 186 participants) and zero (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.11;
four studies; 186 participants); analyses not shown.

Rendon 2012 could not be included in the meta-analysis because
the  published  data  were  reported  as  medians  and  ranges.  This
study reported no significant difference post intervention between
the  GDS  scores  of  the  exercise  and  control  groups  (GDS  median
(range) in the exercise group was 4.0 (0.0 to 13.0) and in the control
group 5.0 (1.0 to 14.0); 40 participants, P value = 0.09).

appear  to  reduce  depression  scores;  these  results  favoured  the
no  exercise,  'active'  control,  group  (SMD  0.20,  95%  CI  -0.02  to
0.43;  three  studies;  327  participants;  Analysis  3.4).  There  was  no
significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi2 = 2.55, df = 2, P
value = 0.28; I2 = 22%).

One  study  was  not  included  in  the  meta-analyses  immediately
post intervention or at short-term follow-up (Wolf 1996). This study
(185 participants) measured depression using the CES-D scale and
reported no significant difference between treatment groups (CES-
D scores and P values not reported).

Anxiety

Anxiety  was  reported  by  the  subscale  of  the  HADS  by  Wolf  2001
and no significant differences were observed between mean scores
in  the  intervention  group  and  control  group  immediately  post
intervention (mean (SD): intervention group:4.3 (3.9); control group
4.3 (3.4), 77 participants, P value > 0.05).

Compliance with or adherence to exercise interventions

Twenty-one  studies  reported  adherence  rates.  The  definitions  of
adherence,  which  varied  between  studies,  are  given  in  the  table
of Characteristics of included studies. Seventeen studies reported
adherence rates over 50% (Barnett 2003; Freiberger 2012; Hinman
2002;  Karinkanta  2012;  McCormack  2004;  Reinsch  1992;  Rendon
2012;  Resnick  2008;  Sihvonen  2004;  Tiedemann  2012;  Ullmann
2010;  Vogler  2009;  Vrantsidis  2009;  Weerdesteyn  2006;  Westlake
2007;  Wolf  1996;  Zhang  2006).  Six  studies  reported  adherence
rates  of  90%  or  higher  (Barnett  2003;  Hinman  2002;  Sihvonen
2004; Ullmann 2010; Wolf 1996; Zhang 2006). Hinman 2002 partly
attributed this high adherence to participants being offered a cash
incentive  for  taking  part  in  the  trial.  Of  those  studies  reporting
adherence  rates  above  50%,  41%  (7/17)  were  classified  as  gait,
balance, co-ordination or functional task exercises, 18% (3/17) as
strength and resistance exercises, 24% as 3D exercises (4/17) and
18%  (3/17)  had  more  than  one  intervention  group  each  with  a
different  type  of  exercise.  This  suggests  higher  adherence  rates
were not confined to studies evaluating particular types of exercise.
Four  studies  reported  adherence  rates  less  than  50%  (Campbell
1997; Haines 2009; Logghe 2009; Yang 2012). Nine studies did not
report adherence rates (Clemson 2010; Halvarsson 2011; Lai 2013;
Lajoie 2004; Lin 2007; Nguyen 2012; Wallsten 2006; Wolf 2001; Yoo
2010).

As physical activity can be regarded as a measure of compliance or
adherence to exercise interventions, we also report on this. Eight
studies  measured  physical  activity  in  participants  using  a  variety
of  scales  (Barnett  2003;  Campbell  1997;  Logghe  2009;  Resnick
2008;  Sihvonen  2004;  Westlake  2007;  Yang  2012;  Yoo  2010).  The
Physical  Activity  Scale  for  the  Elderly  (PASE)  (Washburn  1993)
was  used  in  four  studies  (Barnett  2003;  Campbell  1997;  Logghe
2009;  Westlake  2007),  the  Yale  Physical  Activity  Survey  (YPAS)  in
two studies (Resnick 2008; Yoo 2010), and a four-category graded
physical activity scale (only activities of daily living, less than three
hours per week, three to four hours per week, more than four hours
per week) (Sihvonen 2004) and Human Activity Profile - Adjusted
Activity  Score  (HAP-AAS)  (Yang  2012)  were  used  in  the  remaining
two studies.

Three  studies  (Lin  2007;  Vogler  2009;  Wolf  2001),  all  with  'active'
control  groups,  reported  results  at  short-term  follow-up  (less
than six months post intervention). Exercise interventions did not

Meta-analysis of four studies using the PASE score (Barnett 2003;
Campbell  1997;  Logghe  2009;  Westlake  2007)  showed  exercise
interventions did not appear to increase physical activity (MD 3.44,

95% CI -1.65 to 8.54; four studies; 547 participants; Analysis 3.5) and
no significant heterogeneity between effect sizes (Chi2 = 2.04, df = 3,
P value = 0.57; I2 = 0%). Barnett 2003 reported physical activity at six
months into a 12-month intervention. The remaining three studies
reported physical activity immediately post intervention.

Three studies not included in the meta-analysis reported physical
activity significantly increased in the intervention group compared
with the control group post intervention (Resnick 2008; Sihvonen
2004;  Yang  2012).  Resnick  2008  (103  participants)  reported  an
intervention  group  mean  of  281  (SD  320)  minutes  and  a  control
group mean of 199 (SD 257) minutes per week spent in moderate
intensity  physical  activity  post  intervention  (P  value  =  0.04),
Sihvonen  2004  (27  participants)  reported  a  significant  increase
in  physical  activity  from  baseline  in  the  intervention  group  but
not  in  the  control  group  (20%  more  than  four  hours  per  week  to
45% in intervention group versus 0% doing more than four hours
per  week  in  control  group  at  both  time  points,  P  value  =  0.004).
Yang  2012  (121  participants)  reported  a  significantly  higher  HAP-
AAS  score  in  the  intervention  group  than  the  control  group  post
intervention  (difference  between  means  comparing  intervention
to  control  group:  4.57,  95%  CI  1.84  to  7.29,  P  value  =  0.001).  Yoo
2010 (21 participants) reported no significant difference in energy
expenditure  per  week  between  the  exercise  and  control  groups
(mean (SD) kcal/week 9806 (4062) versus 6068 (2216) respectively,
P value only reported as non-significant).

Cost

No information was provided on the cost of the interventions in any
of the studies.

Summary of main results

The 30 included studies, which included a total of 1692 participants,
investigated  a  wide  variety  of  interventions  using  different  types
of exercise, of varied intensity and duration, in a range of different
settings.  A  summary  of  the  evidence  is  shown  in  Summary  of
findings for the main comparison.

Low  quality  evidence  suggests  that  exercise  interventions  are
associated  with  a  small  to  moderate  reduction  in  fear  of  falling
amongst  community-dwelling  older  adults  immediately  at  the
end  of  the  intervention  period  (standardised  mean  difference
(SMD)  0.37,  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  0.18,  0.56;  24  studies,
1692  participants).  Pooled  effect  sizes  did  not  differ  significantly
between  the  different  scales  used  to  measure  fear  of  falling.
Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the direction of
effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal
of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24, 95% CI
0.12 to 0.36; 23 studies, 1619 participants).

Subgroup  analyses  did  not  provide  evidence  that  the  effect  of
exercise interventions on fear of falling differed by type of exercise
intervention,  the  frequency  of  exercise  or  the  duration  of  the
exercise intervention. Similarly, subgroup analyses did not provide
evidence that the effect of exercise interventions on fear of falling
differed between studies which did and did not recruit participants
on  the  basis  of  increased  falls  risk,  or  between  those  where  the
primary  aim  was  to  reduce  fear  of  falling  and  those  with  an
alternative  primary  aim.  It  is  possible  that  the  small  number  of

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

studies  in  some  of  the  subgroups  may  have  resulted  in  a  lack  of
power to detect differential effects.

Subgroup analysis provided some weak evidence that the effect of
exercise interventions on fear of falling was less, including no effect
or a small increase, where the control group received an alternative
intervention (e.g. education, social visits, craft activities, discussion
groups)  than  where  the  control  group  received  no  intervention.
There  was  also  some  weak  evidence  that  the  effect  of  exercise
interventions  on  fear  of  falling  is  larger  where  the  intervention
involved group exercises rather than individual exercises. However,
these  subgroup  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  as
the  95%  CIs  for  the  subgroup  effect  sizes  overlap  and  there  was
substantial  reduction  of  the  effect  upon  removal  of  the  above-
mentioned outlier study.

There was very low quality evidence from four studies of exercise
resulting in either little effect or a small reduction in fear of falling
in  the  short  term  (less  than  six  months  from  the  end  of  the
intervention) during follow-up. A similar conclusion resulted from
long-term data provided by three studies.

Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these
studies  that  also  reported  on  fear  of  falling  reduced  the  risk  of
falling  measured  either  as  participants  incurring  at  least  one  fall
during follow-up or number of falls during follow-up. These provide
reassurance  that  reduced  fear  of  falling  was  not  associated  with
an  increased  risk  of  falling.  Very  low  quality  evidence  from  four
studies  indicated  that  exercise  interventions  did  not  appear  to
reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. Only
one  study  reported  effects  of  exercise  interventions  on  anxiety,
finding  no  difference  between  groups.  No  studies  reported  the
effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is
important to remember that our included studies do not represent
the totality of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions
on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only
includes studies that reported fear of falling.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This  is  the  largest  review  of  the  effect  of  exercise  interventions
on  fear  of  falling  in  community-dwelling  older  people.  Where
data  were  not  presented  in  the  required  format  or  were  missing,
the  review  team  attempted  to  obtain  data  from  trial  authors
and,  as  a  result,  we  were  able  to  include  unpublished  data
from seven studies (Clemson 2010; Halvarsson 2011; Lajoie 2004;
Ullmann  2010;  Vogler  2009;  Wallsten  2006;  Weerdesteyn  2006).
We  pooled  data  from  24  of  the  30  included  studies  (1692
participants)  for  our  primary  outcome:  fear  of  falling  measured
immediately post intervention. Very few studies reported on fear of
falling subsequently. As stressed repeatedly, the evidence for our
secondary outcomes, such as falls, does not represent the totality
of  the  evidence  of  the  effect  of  exercise  interventions  on  these
outcomes.

We  found  exercise  interventions  were  associated  with  a  small  to
moderate  reduction  in  fear  of  falling.  To  our  knowledge  there
are  no  definitions  of  minimal  clinically  important  differences  in
fear  of  falling  for  the  measures  used  in  studies  in  our  review.  A
minimal  clinically  important  difference  is  the  smallest  change  in
an outcome measure that a patient would find important. Defining
this for measures of fear of falling would be difficult. Items in the
scales may require different weightings for different individuals and

populations  as  fear,  concern  or  worry  about  falling  may  vary  in
importance across the items included in the scales. For example,
fear about falling whilst having a bath or shower or whilst walking
around the neighbourhood may have very different impacts on the
life of an older person. Consequently it is not possible to consider
our findings in terms of a minimal clinically important difference.

our  review  may  overestimate  the  effect  of  exercise  interventions
on  reducing  fear  of  falling.  We  thus  downgraded  the  quality  of
evidence for fear of falling by a further level for publication bias. We
downgraded fear of falling measured at short and long term follow-
up after the end of the intervention by one further level because of
the small number of studies contributing these data.

Although  all  studies  tested  exercise  in  older  people  living  in  the
community and reported on fear of falling, there was considerable
variation in study characteristics. Where there were sufficient data
available  for  discrete  subgroups,  none  of  our  subgroup  analyses
provided  robust  evidence  of  differences  in  effect  in  terms  of
either  the  study  primary  aim  (reduction  of  fear  of  falling  or
other  aim),  the  study  population  (recruitment  on  the  basis  of
increased falls risk or not), the characteristics of the study exercise
intervention,  the  study  control  intervention  (no  treatment  or
alternative intervention), or the method of outcome measurement.
The  potential  for  differences  of  effect  in  different  populations  or
from different exercise interventions cannot be ruled out but the
currently available evidence is insufficient to provide these insights.

We were also unable to explore the effect of exercise adherence on
fear of falling, either during the intervention period or beyond the
end of the intervention period due to some studies not measuring
adherence  and  the  use  of  varying  definitions  by  other  studies.  It
is  possible  that  participants  in  the  trials  included  in  our  review
may  have  been  more  physically  active  and  more  interested  or
motivated to participate in an exercise programme than the general
population  of  older  people.  If  this  is  the  case,  our  findings  may
overestimate  the  effect  of  exercise  interventions  if  they  were
implemented in a wider population of community-dwelling older
people. The majority of the studies in our review come from high-
income countries, so our findings may not be generalisable to low-
and middle-income countries.

The  relationship  between  fear  of  falling  and  falls  occurrence  is
important,  because  one  potential  unintended  consequence  of
reducing  fear  of  falling  may  be  increased  exposure  to  activities
associated with a higher risk of falls. Our review therefore reported
on  falls  outcomes  as  well  as  on  fear  of  falling.  While  the  studies
included in our review are only a subset of studies examining the
effect of exercise on preventing falls, the results of our analyses are
consistent with those of reviews focusing on the prevention of falls
(Gillespie 2012b; Sherrington 2008b).

Quality of the evidence

Due  to  the  nature  of  the  intervention  and  outcome  measures,
blinding  of  participants  and  outcome  assessors  was  not  possible
and therefore we judged all studies to be at high risk of performance
and detection biases. Most studies were not reported in sufficient
detail  to  judge  the  risk  of  other  biases,  particularly  in  terms  of
selection bias and reporting bias. We judged 12 studies to be at high
risk of attrition bias. However, a sensitivity analysis including only
the 17 studies at low risk of attrition bias showed similar results for
the primary analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for all
outcomes by one level for study limitations reflecting the high risk
of bias from lack of blinding.

We  did  not  downgrade  the  quality  of  the  evidence  for  fear  of
falling immediately post intervention for heterogeneity, including
that relating to wide variety of exercise interventions tested in the
included studies. As well as drawing on the findings of the subgroup
analyses, this decision reflected that the significant heterogeneity
between effect sizes in the meta-analysis for our primary outcome
measure was mainly due to one outlier study (Nguyen 2012). This
evaluated group-based Tai Chi classes lasting for one hour, twice
weekly  for  six  months  in  adults  aged  60  to  79  years.  There  is  no
obvious  explanation  for  the  much  larger  effect  on  fear  of  falling
favouring the intervention group than other studies included in our
meta-analysis.

We downgraded the quality of evidence for all secondary outcomes
by  two  further  levels  for  indirectness.  This  is  because  our  review
includes  only  a  subset  of  studies  reporting  the  effect  of  exercise
interventions on these outcomes, as studies had to report fear of
falling and these outcomes to be included in our review. Thus these
results  cannot  be  considered  representative  of  the  effects  of  the
interventions under test.

In  consequence,  we  judged  the  quality  of  the  evidence  for  the
outcome 'fear of falling immediately post intervention' to be 'low',
and  the  quality  of  evidence  for  all  other  outcomes  including  fear
of falling at short and long-term follow-ups to be 'very low'. Where
the quality of evidence is 'low' this suggests further research is very
likely  to  change  the  estimate  of,  and  confidence  in  the  estimate
of, the effect of exercise on those outcomes. Where the quality of
evidence is 'very low', there is considerable uncertainty about the
effect of exercise on those outcomes.

Potential biases in the review process

Since  many  studies  included  in  our  review  did  not  measure  fear
of  falling  as  a  primary  outcome,  it  is  likely  that  our  searches
failed  to  identify  some  studies  that  measured  but  did  not  report
fear  of  falling.  To  reduce  potential  bias,  we  contacted  authors  of
studies  that  met  our  criteria  for  study  design,  participants  and
interventions  but  did  not  report  fear  of  falling  as  an  outcome
measure  although  they  reported  on  fear  of  falling  at  baseline
or  mentioned  it  in  their  methods.  We  tried  also  to  minimise
reporting bias by contacting authors of included studies to obtain
unpublished data and were successful in obtaining data for seven
studies, enabling their inclusion in the meta-analyses. We tried to
minimise publication bias by searches of a range of databases, by
examining reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews
and by contacting authors and experts in the field of fear of falling
and exercise. However, the funnel plot (Figure 5) and the Egger's
test  (P  value  =  0.01)  indicate  funnel  plot  asymmetry  suggesting
publication  bias  from  the  non-availability  of  small  studies  with
negative findings.

The funnel plot and Egger's test for data from our primary outcome
of  fear  of  falling  immediately  post  intervention  indicated  the
potential  that  we  had  failed  to  identify  and  include  some  small
studies  with  negative  findings.  This  suggests  that  the  findings  of

These  are  currently  awaiting  assessment  as  more  details  are
required on the content of the comparator treatment to decide on
inclusion of these studies and to consider the implications of the
current decision not to include these studies in terms of introducing
bias into the review.

As stipulated in our protocol, we performed sensitivity analyses to
check  on  various  decisions  that  we  had  made  in  presenting  the
data. These suggested that our findings for fear of falling were very
similar  when  we  used  the  Activities-specific  Balance  Confidence
(ABC)  scores  instead  of  the  Falls  Efficacy  Scale  (FES)  scores  for
two  studies  that  reported  both  scores  and  when  we  varied  the
intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) used to adjust the results
from  cluster-randomised  controlled  trials.  Restricting  analyses  to
studies at low risk of attrition bias also produced similar results to
the analysis containing all studies.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

Notably,  the  narrative  and  dated  (search  date  January  2006)
systematic  review  by  Zijlstra  2007  provided  separate  conclusions
for  different  types  of  exercise 
interventions.  Zijlstra  2007
concluded that community-based Tai Chi and home-based exercise
interventions  reduced  fear  of  falling  in  community-dwelling
older  people,  but  that  community-based  group  exercise  and
computerised balance training did not. While we categorised our
interventions  in  various  ways  (Table  3),  our  primary  analysis
included  all  exercise  interventions.  Our  subgroup  analyses  did
not provide evidence that different types of exercise interventions
differed in their effect on fear of falling.

Our review included only a limited subset of the studies included
in  other  reviews  evaluating  the  effect  of  exercise  interventions
on  the  risk  and  rate  of  falls.  In  consequence,  our  review  does
not  comprise  the  totality  of  evidence  in  this  area.  However,  our
findings  on  exercise  interventions  are  consistent  with  those  of
the  Cochrane  review  on  preventing  falls  in  older  people  living  in
the  community  (Gillespie  2012b).  This  found  group  and  home-
based  exercise  programmes  containing  strength  and  balance
training  exercises,  including  Tai  Chi,  are  effective  in  preventing
falls.  A  review  by  Bula  2011b,  examining  interventions  aimed  at
improving balance confidence in older adults, found the majority
of  effective  interventions  included  some  component  of  exercise,
with no superiority of one type of exercise. Whilst our review did
not  find  evidence  of  a  significant  effect  of  exercise  interventions
on  symptoms  of  depression,  a  review  by  Bridle  2012  found
exercise  to  reduce  the  severity  of  symptoms  in  older  people
suffering  from  depression.  A  Cochrane  review  including  35  trials
(1356  participants)  also  found  exercise  had  a  significant  effect,
of  moderate  size,  in  improving  symptoms  of  depression  (Cooney

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2013).  As  well  as  only  a  small  number  of  studies  included  in  our
review reporting measures of depression, the populations included
in studies in the reviews by Bridle 2012 and Cooney 2013 comprised
people with pre-existing depression, whereas none of the studies
reporting  depression  as  an  outcome  in  our  review  specifically
recruited people with depression.

Implications for practice

interventions 

Exercise 
in  community-dwelling  older  people
probably  reduce  fear  of  falling  to  a  limited  extent  immediately
after  the  intervention,  without  increasing  the  risk  or  frequency
of  falls.  There  is  insufficient  evidence  from  the  included  studies
to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling
beyond  the  end  of  the  intervention  or  their  effect  on  other
outcomes.

Implications for research

Further  well-designed  randomised  trials  are  required  to  assess
the  effect  of  exercise  interventions  on  fear  of  falling  amongst
community-dwelling  older  people.  However,  priority  should  be
given  to  establishing  a  core  set  of  outcomes  that  includes  fear
of  falling,  and  other  related  outcomes,  for  all  trials  examining
the  effects  of  exercise  interventions  in  older  people  living  in  the
community.  The  variety  of  the  tools  used  to  measure  fear  of
falling  is  likely  to  continue  to  be  a  problem,  but  a  pragmatic
approach  is  that  all  trials  should  be  explicit  about  the  tools  they
use  to  measure  fear  of  falling  and  the  constructs  measured  by
the tools. Consideration is needed regarding the time of outcome
measurement;  in  particular,  outcome  should  be  measured  at
suitable  time  points  beyond  the  end  of  the  intervention  period.
Trials should also measure and clearly define exercise adherence.
Discussion  in  the  research  community,  with  consumer  and  other
stakeholder  input,  is  required  to  identify  priorities  for  future
research  and  trials.  This  includes  informing  the  decisions  on  the
target  population  and  the  exercise  interventions  to  be  tested  in
trials whose primary aim is to reduce fear of falling.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Study population: recruited from general practice clinics or 2 acute physiotherapy departments

Inclusion criteria: participants were aged 65 years and older recruited from general practice clinics with
1 or more physical performance impairments known to be important risk factors for falls (i.e. lower
limb weakness, poor balance and slow reaction time)

Exclusion criteria: cognitive impairments, degenerative conditions or medical condition involving neu-
romuscular, skeletal or cardiovascular system which could prevent them from taking part in an exer-
cise programme

1. Exercise group (n = 83). Weekly structured exercise group in a community setting, combined with a
home exercise programme and written information on practical strategies for avoiding falls. Classes
ran for 1 hour, over 4 terms for 1 year (37 classes) and steadily increased in speed and complexity. Class
content was designed by a physiotherapist to specifically address physical falls risk factors and was de-
livered in groups of 6 to 18. Content included stretching, balance, co-ordination, aerobic capacity and
muscle strengthening exercises. The home exercise programme was based on the class content with
diaries to record participation. ProFaNE taxonomy classification: gait, balance, co-ordination, function-
al tasks

2. Control group (n = 80). Provided with the same information about falls prevention, but no alternative
'non-exercise' activity

Number of falls (recorded by retrospective monthly fall calendars); fear of falling (single-item measure -
recorded as % of participants who are afraid of falling); physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the
Elderly (PASE)). Outcomes were measured at baseline and 6 months post baseline. Falls were measured
over the 12-month intervention period

The outcomes for the study were measured at 6 months into the 12-month trial as this was deemed a
sufficient period to achieve the beneficial results of the exercise programme. Adherence: 91% were still
attending exercise classes at the end of the trial and performing home exercises at least once a week

Methods

RCT

Participants

Country: New Zealand

n = 233

100% female

Mean age in years (SD) = 84 (3.3)

Study population: recruited from general practice registers

Inclusion criteria: women aged 80 and over who lived in the community recruited from general prac-
tice, able to move around within their own home and not receiving physiotherapy

Exclusion criteria: score < 7 from 10 on the Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ)

1. Exercise group (n = 116). 1-year home-based exercise programme prescribed by a physiotherapist.
Exercises took approximately 30 minutes to complete and participants were to complete them at least
3 times a week, and walk outside the home at least 3 times per week. The programme included mod-
erate intensity strengthening exercises with ankle cuff weights (0.5 kg and 1 kg), strength, balance and
"active range of movement" exercises. The physiotherapist visited participants 4 times over 2 months
prescribing a selection of exercise at appropriate and increasing levels of difficulty, and a walking plan.
Participants were telephoned regularly to maintain motivation. ProFaNE taxonomy classification:
strength/resistance

2. Control group (n = 117). Participants received a social visit from the research nurse 4 times during the
first 2 months and telephoned them regularly during the year of follow-up

Number of falls (recorded by monthly fall calendars); falls efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale (FES)); physical
activity (PASE). Outcomes were measured at baseline and post intervention. FES and PASE only pre-
sented as % change from baseline

Adherence: after 1 year 42% were still completing the exercise programme 3 or more times a week

ommended modifications

3. Education group (n = 50). Participants received 1 social visit of 30 to 40 minutes every 2 weeks over
the study period, plus pamphlets on falls prevention, including stretching and strengthening exercises
to encourage initiation and persistence in activities

The intervention group used for this review comprised the home-based exercise group and the control
group comprised the home safety assessment and modification group

Fear of falling (visual analogue scale); 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); number of falls (self re-
ported). Measured at baseline, and 2 and 4 months post intervention

Fear of falling was assessed using a 10 cm visual analogue scale, marked with the labels "No fear" and
"Extremely fearful" where participants were asked to place a mark on the line at the point representing
the extent of their fear

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Study population: recruited by advertisements in newspapers and from an independent living facility

Inclusion criteria: aged 70 years and older, living in unsupervised environments, ambulatory and agree-
ing to participate weekly for 15 weeks with 4-month follow-up

Exclusion criteria: the presence of debilitating conditions such as cognitive impairments, metastatic
cancer, crippling arthritis, Parkinson's disease or major stroke, or profound visual defects that could
compromise balance or ambulation

1. Computerised Balance Training (BT) group (n = 64). Individual balance training on a computerised
force platform. Participants had 1 hour of instruction per week (with approximately 45 minutes individ-
ual contact time with an instructor) for 15 weeks. ProFaNE taxonomy classification: gait, balance, co-
ordination, functional tasks

2. Tai Chi Quan (TC) group (n = 72). Classes of Tai Chi Quan focusing on all components of movement
that typically becomes limited with ageing. Participants had 2 hours of instruction per week (2 separate
sessions) with a total of approximately 45 minutes contact time with an instructor. Participants were
encouraged to practice at least 15 minutes twice a day at home. ProFaNE taxonomy classification: 3D
(Tai Chi, Qi Gong, dance, yoga)

3. Education group (n = 64). Weekly 1-hour meetings for 15 weeks were held with a gerontological
nurse/researcher to discuss a variety of topics such as pharmacological management, sleep disorders,
cognitive deficits, coping with bereavement and other issues important to each group

The intervention group used in the analysis comprised the combined BT and TC groups

Number of falls (recorded by weekly fall calendars); falls efficacy (FES) and Center for Epidemiolog-
ic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. Falls were defined using the FICSIT definition ("unintentional-
ly coming to rest on the ground, floor or lower level") and the Atlanta site definition ("falls resulting in
fractures, dislocation, sprains, bruises, lacerations, scrapes and other medical problems"). Mean and
SD for FES presented at baseline and categories of fear of falling (not at all afraid, somewhat afraid, fair-
ly afraid, very afraid of falling) presented at follow-up. Measured at baseline, post intervention and at 4-
month follow-up

We used falls defined using the FICSIT definition in the meta-analysis. A subset of participants (n = 72)
who "tended to be reclusive" were reported on in Wolf 1997. Adherence: over 90% adhered to the exer-
cise programme

Several co-authors of this review are involved in the NIHR HTA-funded PROACT65+ study (Iliffe 2010a). The study is a multicentre cluster-
randomised  trial  comparing  a  community  group  exercise  programme  with  home-based  exercise  with  usual  care  to  increase  physical
activity for people aged 65 and over in primary care. The trial may be included in future versions of the review.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

To  improve  clarity,  we  changed  the  terminology  for  the  overall  intervention  to  "exercise  interventions"  from  "prescribed  or  provided
exercise" as described in the protocol.

In the primary outcomes section, we subdivided 'falls efficacy' into two categories ('falls efficacy' and 'concern about falling') because
some falls efficacy scales (e.g. FES-I, amFES, Modified Efficacy Scale) measure "concern" or "worry" (e.g. SAFFE) about falling as opposed
to falls efficacy.

Since physical activity can be regarded as a measure of compliance or adherence to exercise interventions, we reported on this.

We  did  not  undertake  a  subgroup  analysis  for  age  group  based  on  a  cut-off  of  75  years.  This  was  because  only  two  studies  restricted
recruitment to participants aged 75 years and over and the remaining studies included participants aged 75 and over; hence it was not
possible to identify distinct age groups for a subgroup analysis. We also did not undertake a subgroup analysis for baseline fear of falling.
This was because only two studies specified a fear of falling as an inclusion criterion, in both cases the criterion was a history of falls or
fear of falling, and baseline fear of falling scores appeared similar to studies that did not have fear of falling as an inclusion criterion. One
study included concern about falling as an inclusion criterion, but the prevalence of this appeared similar to studies not specifying this as
an inclusion criteria. Therefore it was not possible to identify distinct groups based on fear of falling for a subgroup analysis. In addition,
the protocol stated we would use sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of the primary aim of the study (to reduce fear of falling or other
primary aim). We undertook a subgroup analysis instead of a sensitivity analysis, as we considered this more appropriate for this purpose.

We undertook a sensitivity analysis for fear of falling excluding the data from Nguyen 2012, as this study had a much larger effect size
than other studies included in the meta-analysis. We also undertook sensitivity analyses using the upper and lower 95% CI for intra class
correlation coefficients where we adjusted studies for clustering. Two studies measured fear of falling using both the FES and ABC. We used
FES scores in the main analysis and undertook a sensitivity analysis replacing FES scores with ABC scores for these two studies.
