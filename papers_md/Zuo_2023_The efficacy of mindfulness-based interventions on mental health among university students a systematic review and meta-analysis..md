Introduction: We aimed to estimate the effect of mindfulness therapy on mental 
health.

Methods:  Two  researchers  searched  12  databases  to  identify  relevant  trials 
that  were  published  from  1  January  2018  to  1  May  2023.  We  performed  a 
meta-analysis  to  determine  the  effect  of  mindfulness  therapy  on  depression, 
which  was  measured  by  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI),  Patient  Health 
Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9),  Quick  Inventory  of  Depressive  Symptomatology 
(QIDS),  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  (HDRS),  Patient-Reported  Outcomes 
Measurement  Information  System  (PROMIS),  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression 
Scale  (HADS),  and  Depression  Anxiety  Stress  Scales  (DASS);  anxiety,  which  was 
measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), PROMIS, and DASS, Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); stress, which was measured by the Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS), DASS, and GAD-7; mindfulness, which was measured by the GAD-7, 
Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale 
(MAAS), Short Form-12 Mental Component Score (SF-12 MCS) and Short Form-12 
Physical Component Score (SF-12 PCS); and sleep quality, which was measured 
by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). After screening studies based on the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 
1,824 participants were ultimately included.

Results: All these studies demonstrated positive effects of mindfulness therapy on 
depression (SMD = −0.33, 95% CI: [−0.44, −0.22], p < 0.00001, I2 = 29%), anxiety 
(SMD = −0.35, 95% CI: [−0.46, −0.25], p < 0.00001, I2 = 40%), stress (SMD = −0.39, 
95% CI: [−0.48, −0.29], p < 0.00001, I2 = 69%) and sleep quality scores (SMD = 
−0.81, 95% CI: [−1.54, −0.09], p = 0.03, I2 = 0%) . However, there was no significant 
difference in mindfulness (SMD = −0.12, 95% CI: [−0.36, −0.12], p = 0.34, I2 = 34%) 
between the mindfulness therapy group and the control group.

Discussion:  In  future  studies,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  investigation  on 
whether  the  strategies  of  improving  the  mindfulness  therapy  in  adherence  and 
fidelity can work on the improvement of the outcomes in mental health.

1 Introduction

Anxiety and depression are the most common mental disorders. 
Due to their negative impact on work capability and performance, 
mental disorders have received widespread attention. When young 
people go to college, they experience a variety of stressors, such as 
leaving  home  and  becoming 
independent,  assuming  new 
responsibilities,  and  embracing  new  academic  challenges  (1).  In 
addition to the effects of academic and social lives and personal habits, 
this sudden independence brings numerous choices to students. As a 
result, many college students report increasing levels of stress and an 
inability to cope with their stressors, thus leading to an overwhelming 
feeling (2). Frequently, college students make sacrifices in some major 
aspects of life, and sleep quality is thus often neglected. To this end, 
early psychological interventions may contribute to the prevention of 
mental  disorders  (3).  Moreover,  the  prevalence  of  mental  health 
disorders varies widely among university students; in some countries, 
the  prevalence  of  depressive  symptoms  reaches  up  to  50%  (4). 
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple, economical, feasible and 
effective  intervention  for  addressing  mental  health  issues  among 
university students.

To  date,  researchers  have  developed  many  mental  health 
interventions. Among them, mindfulness therapy is recommended 
as a nonpharmacological treatment method because it has very few 
side effects (5, 6). According to a recent meta-analysis, potential 
advantages of mindfulness therapy include lower levels of depression 
(7),  anxiety  (8)  and  stress  (9)  as  well  as  improvements  in  sleep 
quality (10) among both university students with clinical symptoms 
and  healthy  individuals.  Mindfulness  therapy  originates  from  a 
tradition of Buddhism in the east, which has a history of more than 
2,500 years. Mindfulness mainly entails (1) paying attention to the 
current moment, (2) being nonjudgmental, and (3) being intentional 
(11). Moreover, mindfulness is defined as an individual’s ability to 
account for the details of currently occurring events (12). According 
to the use context, mindfulness has the following definitions: first, a 
method of concentrating the mind; second, a meditation technique; 
third, a skill; and fourth, a specific method of treatment (13). The 
include 
essential  components  of  mindfulness 
awareness  cultivation,  experience  enhancement,  responsiveness 
fostering,  and  tolerance  increase  (14).  As  a  kind  of  effective 
intervention,  mindfulness  training  (or  interventions  based  on 
mindfulness)  has  gained  popularity  among  scientists  circle  and 
within the general public due to its role in promoting well-being and 
health.  With  the  adaptation  of  oriental  Buddhist  practices  and 
techniques, mindfulness training was first introduced to Western 
culture in the 1970s. It was designed to alleviate stress as well as 
reduce  psychological  distress  through  numerous  secular  and 
contemplative  practices  (15).  Subsequently,  many  mindfulness 
training with varying contents have been developed; they share the 
same objective of paying attention to and fostering awareness of 
experiences at the current moment with a nonjudgmental, accepting 
attitude (16). There are numerous types of nonreligious psychological 
interventions centered around mindfulness, including mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy (MBCT) (17, 18), mindfulness-based stress 
reduction  (MBSR)  (11,  19)  and  brief  mindfulness  meditation 
training  (20,  21).  Many  interventions  based  on  mindfulness 
incorporate  mindfulness  training  into  an  all-around  treatment 
program as an essential part, such as acceptance and commitment 

interventions 

therapy (ACT) (22–24) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) (25, 
26). Additionally, many interventions include mind–body training 
(27). The  operating  mechanism  is  to  concentrate  on  the  current 
moment with a nonjudgmental attitude while preventing oneself 
from  being  absent-minded,  thereby  triggering  the  reperception 
experience and achieving emotional regulation. In this way, negative 
emotions can be effectively reduced (28). Currently, mindfulness 
training is well established in cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT), 
which is also most prominently used in manualized and structured 
group settings, such as groups practicing stress reduction based on 
mindfulness (11) or cognitive therapy based on mindfulness (29).

such  widely  applied  mindfulness  training  is  still  in  need  of 
careful scrutiny.

On one hand, mindfulness therapy has been viewed as a potential 
clinical  intervention  strategy  for  treating  mental  health  (30).  In 
addition,  due  to  its  significant  effects,  mindfulness  has  become 
popular among healthy subjects (31). Many studies have reported that 
college students may benefit from mindfulness interventions (32–35).
However, conflicting results were recently reported in two meta-
analyses. Vøllestad et al. (36) assessed the effects of mindfulness-based 
interventions (MBIs) on individuals suffering anxiety disorders; they 
reported  significant  reductions  in  both  anxiety  (g = −0.83)  and 
depression symptoms (g = −0.72). On the other hand (37), assessed 
the  effects  of  MBIs  on  individuals  with  anxiety  and  depression 
disorders; they failed to find an obvious effect of MBIs on anxiety 
disorders (p = 0.09). Thus, clinical data on the effect of mindfulness 
therapy on mental health remain controversial. Hence, it is essential 
to assess both the effect of mindfulness therapy and the factors that 
contribute to the efficacy of MBIs, such as the treatment duration, 
group  vs.  individual  formats,  and  the  target  groups.  Due  to  the 
inconsistencies in these factors among the abovementioned meta-
analyses, it is difficult to determine the underlying reasons for the 
different findings. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect 
of  mindfulness  therapy  on  mental  health  and  further  provide  a 
reference for clinical practice.

2 Methods

This systematic review was performed in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines (Multimedia Appendix 1 Checklist 2020) (38). 
We registered the study in PROSPERO (CRD42023469301).

2.1 Selection criteria

In this study, the eligibility criteria were made in accordance with 
the PICOS principles. (1) P: The subjects had at least one indicator 
indicating emotional problems, and their age was 16 years or older. (2) 
I: MBIs (mindfulness-based interventions) were implemented among 
university students in the experimental group (e.g., ACT, MBSR, DBT, 
MBCT,  mindfulness  walking  in  nature,  mindfulness  meditation, 
mind–body training) without restrictions on the time of intervention. 
(3) C: The control group received a different intervention (e.g., routine

included depression, anxiety, mindfulness or sleep quality in college 
students. (5) S: The type of study was RCTs.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) reviews, non-RCTs, 
articles for which the full text was unavailable, or case reports; (2) 
duplicate publications or animal experiments; and (3) incomplete or 
unavailable data.

Moreover,  the  PICOS  principles  were  used  to  identify  eligible 
studies (Table 1). All included studies were published in Chinese or 
English.  Studies  wherein  the  results  are  interpreted  from  the 
perspective of college students were deemed eligible.

2.2 Search strategy

The  following  database  were  searched  to  identify  literature: 
PubMed,  the  UWE  Library  database,  MEDLINE,  the  Cochrane 
Library,  Embase,  PsycINFO,  Scopus,  SinoMed,  China  National 
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Wanfang MED 
ONLINE, Yiigle and Web of Science.

The  search  terms  used  in  the  different  databases  were  slightly 
different. Keywords such as “quality or Mood or Stress,” and “a pilot 
study or Randomized Controlled Trial or RCT,” and “Mindfulness-
Based or Mindfulness or Web-Based or Mobile,” as well as “University 
student or College student or Young people” were used to search for 
articles published from 1 January 2018 to 1 May 2023. The “snowball” 
method was adopted to trace the references of the included literature. 
Additionally, the references of the included studies were manually 
searched to identify eligible articles. Unpublished academic literature 
was not considered to be eligible. The search strategy for the PubMed 
databases is shown in Box 1.

The  search  strategies  are  demonstrated  in  Figure  1.  Four 
researchers (ZXY, TY, CYF and ZZM) screened all the literature for 
inclusion. After removing duplicates, all studies were initially screened 
based on titles and abstracts. Then, the researchers carefully read the 
full texts of the remaining articles in accordance with the inclusion 
and  exclusion  criteria.  Finally,  the  data  were  extracted  from  the 
included  literature.  For  the  identification  of  further  related 
publications, we also retrieved the gray literature (opengrey.eu).

2.3 Data extraction

After  the  removal  of  duplicate  studies  (EndNote  X9).  Four 
reviewers (ZXY, TY, CYF and ZZM) independently screened the titles 
and abstracts of the studies. Then, the full texts of the remaining studies 
were evaluated in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

“Young people”(Title/Abstract)

#5  “A  pilot  study”(Title/Abstract)  OR  “Randomized  Controlled  Trial”(Title/

Abstract) OR “RCT”(Title/Abstract)

#6 #3 AND #4 AND #5

The following data were extracted from the included studies: (1) the 
information  of  the  literature  included  (name  of  author,  region, 
publication year, and publication type); (2) characteristics of the subjects 
(sample  size,  participant  age,  participant  details,  participant  health 
conditions);  (3)  interventions  (setting,  intervention  type,  control 
conditions, intervention dose, study design, intervention provider); (4) 
information on quality of the study (Jadad score); and (5) main outcomes.

2.4 Assessment risk of Bias and quality

Using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool (39). Four 
researchers (ZXY, TY, CYF and ZZM) independently assessed the risk 
of bias. Additionally, the quality of the literature was assessed using 
the Jadad scale (40). The Risk of Bias tool assesses seven domains: 1. 
random sequence generation; 2. concealment of allocation; 3. subjects 
and experimenter blinding; 4. outcome assessor blinding; 5. resulting 
data integration; 6. selective reports; 7. other risk of bias. Each study 
was categorized as having an unclear risk of bias, low risk of bias or 
high  risk  of  bias.  We  also  performed  the  Begg  and  Egger  tests  to 
evaluate the degree of publication bias (41).

2.5 Statistical analysis

Data analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software 
and stata15.1. Forest maps were constructed to intuitively illustrate the 
results.  In  the  included  literature,  the  outcomes  were  measured  as 
continuous variables, and the same indicator was assessed by different 
tools. Such indicators were represented as standard mean differences 
(SMDs). α = 0.05 was used to indicate significance. The heterogeneity was 
assessed by I2 statistics, which were categorized as low (<50%), moderate 
(50–75%)  or  high  (>75%)  (42).  In  the  case  of  high  heterogeneity, 
sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave one out method to 
identify the sources of heterogeneity. In the analysis, numerous weeks 
were compared as subpoints to check the results. Begg’s test (43) and 
Egger’s test (44) were employed to check the possibility of publication 
bias. p < 0.05 indicated significant results. When at least 10 studies were 
included in a meta-analysis, a funnel plot (45, 46) was used to assess the 
publication bias. In this study, the standard mean difference (SMD) and 
95%  CI  were  examined  (47).  According  to  the  overall  effect,  when 
p < 0.05, MBIs had statistically significant effects.

2.6 Subgroup analyses

Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  based  on  country  of 
intervention  (outside  Europe  or  not)  and  length  of  intervention 
(weeks).

3 Results

3.1 Selection of studies

Figure  1  shows  the  screening  process,  and  the  screening 
results are shown in Figure 1. After searching 12 databases, 2,835 

relevant  records  were  identified.  For  the  purpose  of  duplicate 
removal, we imported all studies into EndNote X8 (Bld, 10,063) 
(48). After the removal of 1,528 duplicates and the elimination of 
1,296  articles  by  a  strict  screening  process,  11  trials  (49–59) 
involving  1,824  participants  were  ultimately  included.  Studies 
were excluded due not reporting the sd values (60), being a review 
article (61), and not being within the scope of this metaanalysis 
(the study used a mindfulness intervention (MIND), in contrast 
to  the  intervention  plus  support  from  nonspecialist  peer 
counsellors (MIND+) (62). All the included studies reported a 
positive impact of mindfulness on mental health, and the primary 
outcomes of interest were a reduction in depression, assessed by 
the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI),  Hamilton  Depression

by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), PROMIS, and DASS, and 
the  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7);  a  reduction  in 
stress, assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), DASS, and 
GAD-7;  and  improved  sleep  quality,    measured  by  by  the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). However, there was no 
significant  difference  in  mindfulness  scores,  mindfulness, 
measured by the GAD-7, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire 
(FFMQ),  Mindful  Attention  Awareness  Scale  (MAAS),  Short 
Form-12  Mental  Component  Score  (SF-12  MCS)  and  Short 
Form-12 Physical Component Score (SF-12 PCS).

3.2 Study characteristics

Table 2 shows the overall characteristics of the included studies. 
All eleven studies were published before 2023 (Table 2). The sample 
sizes ranged from 52 to 386, and 1,824 college students above 16 years 
old were enrolled in the included studies, including 846 participants 
in the experimental group and 849 participants in the control group. 
All participants were university students with mood disorders, but 
they  had  not  been  diagnosed  with  a  psychiatric  disorder.  All  the 
interventions were based on mindfulness, and their durations ranged 
from 15 days to 2 months. The interventions took from 0.5 to 1.5 h 
each week. Both group training and individual training methods were 
used  (49–59).  All  studies  (49–59)  were  subdivided  into  training 
methods  (mindfulness-based  intervention)  such  as  MBSR,  ACT, 
MBCT, DBT, mindfulness walking in nature, mindfulness meditation, 
and mind–body training.

3.3 Risk of Bias and quality assessment

Figure 2 shows the risk of bias assessment. All 11 articles (49–59) 
described the randomization methods in detail. The blinding method 
was detailed in four studies, and all were single-blinded trials (49, 51, 
55, 56). Two articles reported the dropout rate (49, 57). The average 
Jadad score across all included studies was 4.9, indicating fair to mild 
quality (Figure 3).

3.4 Meta-analyses

3.4.1 Depression scores

Nine included studies (49–52, 54, 55, 57–59) involving 1,635 
university students (753 from the experimental group and 753 
from the control group) assessed the effects of MBIs on college 
students’ depression scores based on the PHQ, DASS, QIDS, BDI, 
HDRS  and  PROMIS.  Because  different  evaluation  tools  were 
used, the SMD was employed as the pooled effect size measure. 
There was a low degree of heterogeneity among studies (p = 0.17, 
I2 = 29%). The MBI group had lower depression scores than the 
control group (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.44 to −0.22, p < 0.00001). 

The  results  indicated  that  the  MBI  significantly  alleviated  the 
depressive symptoms scores of university students (Figure 4).

3.4.2 Anxiety indicators

Nine articles involving 1,635 subjects, including 753 students in 
the  experimental  group  and  753  students  in  the  control  group, 
assessed anxiety. There was a medium level of heterogeneity (I2 = 40%, 
p  = 0.14).  The  mindfulness  group  had  significantly  lower  anxiety 
scores than the control group [SMD = −0.35, 95% CI (−0.46, −0.25), 
p  <  0.00001],  indicating  that  the  mindfulness  intervention  had  a 
significant effect on the reduction of anxiety among college students 
(see Figure 5).

3.4.3 Stress indicators

Seven articles involving 1,278 subjects, including 573 students in 
the  experimental  group  and  576  students  in  the  control  group, 
assessed stress. There was a high degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 69%, 
p = 0.003). The mindfulness group had significantly lower stress score 
than  the  control  group  [SMD = −0.39,  95%  CI  (−0.48,  −0.29), 
p < 0.00001]. This finding indicated that there was a significant effect 
of  mindfulness  on  the  reduction  of  stress  levels  among  college 
students (see Figure 6).

3.4.4 Mindfulness score indicators

Eight articles involving 1,229 subjects, including 548 students in 
the  experimental  group  and  552  students  in  the  control  group, 
assessed mindfulness scores. There was a low level of heterogeneity 
(I2 = 34%, p = 0.15). The mindfulness group had significantly lower 
mindfulness scores than the control group [SMD = −0.12, 95% CI 
(−0.36, −0.12), p = 0.34]. This finding indicated that there was no 
significant  effect  of  MBIs  on  the  reduction  of  mindfulness  scores 
among college students (see Figure 7).

3.4.5 Sleep quality indicators

Two articles involving 153 subjects, including 79 students in the 
experimental group and 74 students in the control group, assessed 
sleep quality. There was no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.71).  The 
mindfulness group had significantly higher sleep quality scores than 
the control group [SMD = −0.81, 95% CI (−1.54, −0.09), p = 0.03]. 
This finding indicated that the mindfulness intervention training had 
improved the improvement of sleep quality among college students 
(see Figure 8).

In  conclusion,  the  included  studies  reported  scores  on  the 
PHQ-9, BDI, QIDS, HDRS, HADS, PROMIS, DASS, GAD-7, BAI, 
PROMIS, PSS, DASS, GAD, MAAS, FFMQ scale, SF-12 PCS and 
SF-12 MCS. A total of five outcomes were evaluated: depression, 
anxiety,  stress,  mindfulness  scores  and  sleep  quality.  The 
mindfulness group (MG) had significantly lower total scores for 
depression symptoms than the control group (SMD = −0.33, 95% 
CI: [−0.44, −0.22], p < 0.00001, I 2 = 29%; Figure 4). In addition, a 
reduction in stress was observed based on the PSS, DASS, and 
GAD-7. The MG had reduced anxiety symptoms (SMD = −0.35, 
95% CI: [−0.46, −0.25], p < 0.00001, I 2 = 40%; Figure 5) and stress 
symptoms  (SMD = −0.39,  95%  CI:  [−0.48,  −0.29],  p < 0.00001, 
I2 = 69%; Figure 6) compared to the CG. Moreover, an increased 
in sleep quality (SMD=−0.81, 95% CI: [−1.54, −0.09], p = 0.03,  
I2 =0%). However, there was no statistically significant difference

3.5 Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses of the anxiety, depression and sleep quality 
scores were performed based on the continent and duration of the 
intervention (weeks).

3.5.1 Continent

For depression, significant differences were found in the SMD of the 
two subgroups: Europe (51, 54, 58) (p = 0.0005) and outside Europe (49, 
50, 52, 55, 57, 59) (p < 0.00001). MBIs showed a significant effect on the 
outcome in the outside Europe group (SMD = −0.31, 95% CI: −0.42 to 

−0.20, p < 0.00001; see Figure 9). For anxiety, significant differences were 
found in the SMD of the two subgroups: Europe (51, 54, 58) (p = 0.001) 
and  outside  Europe  (49,  52,  55,  57)  (p  < 0.00001).  MBIs  showed  a 
significant effect on the outcome in both the Europe (SMD = −1.86, 95% 
CI: −2.99 to −0.73, p = 0.001) and outside Europe groups (SMD = −0.34, 
95% CI: −0.45 to −0.23, p < 0.00001). For stress, there were significant 
differences in the SMD between the two subgroups: Europe (51, 58) 
(p < 0.00001) and outside Europe (52, 55–57, 59) (p < 0.00001). MBIs 
showed  a  significant  effect  on  the  outcome  in  both  the  Europe 
(SMD = −1.93,  95%  CI:  −2.67  to  −1.19,  (p  < 0.00001)  and  outside 
Europe groups (SMD = −0.36, 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.26, (p < 0.00001). 
However, for mindfulness scores, no significant differences in SMD were 
found in the two subgroups: Europe (51, 53, 58) (p = 0.34) and outside 
Europe (49, 50, 52, 55, 56) (p = 0.80). MBIs did not show significant 
intervention effects in either the Europe (SMD = −0.12, 95% CI: −0.36 
to 0.12, p = 0.34) or outside Europe groups (SMD = 2.89, 95% CI: −19.04

3.5.2 Intervention duration (weeks)

Regarding depression, 6 out of the 9 studies showed a pooled 
effect (51, 52, 54, 55, 59) with a duration of intervention of ≥8 weeks 
[SMD = −0.32,  95%  CI:  (−0.43  to  −0.21),  p  < 0.00001].  For  the 
remaining  three  studies  (49,  57,  58),  the  pooled  effect  within  the 
intervention  period  was  [SMD = −2.29,  95%  CI  (−3.85,  −0.72), 
p = 0.04]. Compared with the control group, the effects of mindfulness 
therapy on depression during the two periods of intervention were 
significantly different, and a significant difference between the two 
groups was found (p < 0.00001). It was found that an intervention 
period of 8 weeks or more had a significant effect on reducing college 
students’ levels of depression. For anxiety, no significant differences 
were shown in the SMD of the two subgroups with a period of more 
than 8 weeks (51, 52, 54, 55, 59) (p < 0.00001) or <8 weeks (49, 57, 58) 
(p = 0.09). Among the 9 studies of stress indicators, 5 of them had a 
combined effect (51, 52, 55, 56, 59) in an intervention cycle ≥8 weeks 
[SMD = −0.39, 95% CI: (−0.48 to −0.29), p < 0.00001]. For two studies 
(57,  58),  the  combined  effect  within  the  intervention  period  was 
[SMD = −6.79, 95% CI (−28.63, −15.05), p = 0.54]. Within comparison 
with  the  control  group,  mindfulness  therapy’s  effects  in  the  two 
intervention  periods  on  stress  were  significantly  different,  and  a 
significant difference was found between the groups (p < 0.00001). 
Intervention lasting ≥8 weeks can significantly reduce college students’ 
stress levels. Regarding mindfulness scores, no significant differences 
in SMD were found between the interventions lasting ≥8 weeks (50–
52, 55, 56) (p = 001) and those lasting <8 weeks (49, 53, 58) (p = 0.23). 
MBIs were not found to have a significantly different effects based on 
whether the intervention lasted ≥8 weeks (SMD = −5.14, 95% CI: 2.04 
to 8.23, p = 0.001) or <8 weeks (SMD = −0.15, 95% CI: −0.39 to 0.09, 
p  = 0.23).  For  sleep  quality,  no  significant  differences  were  shown 
between the interventions that lasted >15 days (57) (p = 0.33) and 
those that lasted ≤15 days (53) (p = 0.04). There was no significant 
difference in the effect of MBIs that lasted >15 days (SMD = −0.62, 
95%  CI:  −1.88  to  0.64,  p  = 0.33)  or  those  that  lasted  ≤15 days 
(SMD = −0.91, 95% CI: −1.80 to −0.02, p = 0.04).

3.6 Sensitivity analysis

In the sensitivity analysis (Table 3), we excluded the study by Krifa 
et al. (59) and observed a significant change in heterogeneity from 
69% to 0%. Then, we excluded the study by Küchler et al. (51) and 

to 24.83, p = 0.80). In terms of sleep quality, there were no significant 
differences in the SMD of the two subgroups: Europe (53) (p = 0.04) and 
outside  Europe  (57)  (p  = 0.33).  MBIs  did  not  show  significant 
intervention effects in either the Europe (SMD = −0.91, 95% CI: −1.80 
to 0.02, p = 0.04) or outside Europe groups (SMD =0.62, 95% CI: −1.88 
to 0.64, p = 0.33).

found that the level of heterogeneity also decreased to 0%, indicating 
a  significant  change.  It  is  hypothesized  that  the  outcome  of  stress 
indicators may have been the possible source of heterogeneity in both 
studies. Additional possible reasons include the inclusion of patients, 
specific treatment modalities, and inconsistencies in clinical indicators 

between domestic and foreign countries. The included patients and

3.7 Publication bias

We discovered that the funnel plots for depression, stress, anxiety, 
mindfulness scores and sleep quality were all symmetrical, indicating 
the  absence  of  publication  bias.  Moreover,  p  > 0.05  indicate  the 
absence of obvious publication bias. Begg’s tests (p = 0.02) and Egger’s 
regression (p = 0.037) also indicated a lack of publication bias.

4 Discussion

4.1 Discussion of pooled results

the  statistical  heterogeneity  in  the  findings,  the  results  should  be 
interpreted with caution. This study explored each study’s effect on the 
overall risk via sensitivity analysis, thus investigating the main sources 
of heterogeneity. Major differences in intervention types, sample sizes 
(ranging from 52 to 386), intervention durations (ranging from 15days 
to 2months), intervention hours (ranging from 10 to 90min/week) on 
a weekly basis, type of control group (routine health care, waitlist, etc.), 
cultural background, measurement instruments, or other factors may 
contribute to heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-
analysis  and  systematic  review  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of 
mindfulness therapy on five outcomes in university students. In our 
study, mindfulness therapy was found to significantly reduce depression, 
anxiety and stress symptoms, raise sleep quality, but it was not found to 
have a significant effect on mindfulness scores. Of course, mindfulness 
therapy does not have a magical effect on enhancing mindfulness rating 
scores and improving the sleep quality of college students.

In this systematic review of studies including 1,824 participants, we 
found  that  MBIs  significantly  reduced  depression  (SMD=−0.33), 
anxiety (SMD=−0.35) and stress (SMD=−0.39) scores. Compared with 
the control interventions, MBIs had increased sleep quality and no 
significant effect on mindfulness scores in university students. Due to 

4.2 Comparison of this study with other 
studies

To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the association 
between  MBIs  and  mental  health  (depression,  anxiety,  stress,

mindfulness, and sleep quality) in university students. Previous studies 
have explored the relationship between college students with common 
mental health problems and mindfulness therapy. Huang et al. (63) 
performed a prospective study of mindfulness-based interventions 
and  found  that  college  students  with  depression  and  generalized 
anxiety  disorder  (GAD)  showed  improvements  after  receiving 
mindfulness-based interventions. Reangsing et al. (64) conducted a 
systematic review with university students and observed that online 
MBIs  improved  their  depressive  symptoms.  Chen  et  al.  (65)  also 
reported that mobile mindfulness meditation (MMM) groups were 
more  effective  than  control  interventions  at  decreasing  stress  and 
alleviating anxiety. However, there was no difference in depression 
scores between the MMM and control groups. Previous studies have 
indicated  inconsistencies  in  the  effects  of  mindfulness  therapy  on 
depression symptoms. The current review included recent literature 
(2018–2023) and assessed five indicators of the effect of mindfulness 
therapy on mental health problems among college students. Previous 
studies have consistently shown positive effects of mindfulness therapy 
on  stress  symptoms.  The  current  study  also  found  an  association 
between mindfulness and a lower likelihood of anxiety and depression 
Symptoms, and a higher likelihood of sleep quality(measured by the 
PSQI).  However,  there  was  no  significant  increase  in  mindfulness 
rating scores (measured by the GAD, MAAS, FFMQ, SF-12PCS and 
SF-12MCS).

4.3 The influence of MBIs on mood

through 

Mindfulness originated from Buddhism, and the most frequently 
mentioned definition in the context of secular therapy is as follows: 
“awareness  emerging 
focusing,  on  purpose  and 
nonjudgmentally, on the moment-by-moment experience unfolding” 
(66).  Mindfulness-based  cognitive  therapy  (MBCT)  (67)  and 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) (11) are two prevailing 
programs based on mindfulness. Mindfulness is rooted in Eastern 
traditions. Due to the widespread and rapidly developing standardized 
MBI applications, mindfulness has recently become highly popular in 
Western psychology. To improve psychological functioning and well-
being, the programs combine the essential practices of traditional 
mindfulness  with  the  practices  of  contemporary  psychology.  A 
previous  meta-analysis  examined  mindfulness  as  a  mind–body 
exercise and found that the effects are primarily reflected in improved 
psychological well-being (9), individual emotion (68), mental health 
(9), symptoms of pain and depression and life quality (69). In addition, 
according  to  some  studies,  mindfulness  therapy  exerts  positive 
influences on people with depression and anxiety (70) and affects the 
symptoms of anxiety among older adult individuals in their residential 
care (71), which is helpful for improving sleep quality (72). However, 
anxiety, depression (70), stress, and sleep quality (72) are very complex 
and  multifactorial  outcomes.  In  university  students,  anxiety, 
depression,  stress,  sleep  quality  and  mindfulness  are  particularly 
varied and complex. As reported, common risk factors for mental 
disorders  include  female  sex,  senior  age,  nonreligious  affiliation, 
unmarried/deceased  parents,  nonheterosexual  behavior  and 
identification, low ranking of secondary school, and college entrance 
extrinsic  motivation  among  first-year  college  students  (73).  In 
addition, Becker et al. (74) reported that mental health symptoms are 
related to poor sleep. In contrast, current studies have pointed out that 

academic stress still plays an adverse role in mental health as well as 
the well-being of students (75). Accordingly, mental health is different 
among populations and is subject to different factors. According to 
our meta-analysis, mindfulness therapy had overall positive effects on 
reducing  depression,  anxiety,  stress  and  increasing  sleep  quality; 
however, the benefit of improved mindfulness scores for university 
students was not significant due to many different factors. Therefore, 
mindfulness therapy needs to be further evaluated to determine its 
applicability among individuals experiencing mental health problems, 
including  university  students  (61).  Moreover,  variance  in  the 
demographic characteristics of the participants across the 11 included 
studies may have contributed to the heterogeneity.

5 Limitations

This meta-analysis is the first to demonstrate that MBIs have a 
significant effect on reducing the depression, anxiety, and stress scores, 
and increasing the sleep quality scores of college students but have 
little effect on mindfulness scores.

In this study, there are several strengths. First, it was based on 
studies from 12 global databases. We only included RCTs, which made 
the  samples  more  representative.  Due  to  the  large  sample  size, 
we performed a subgroup analysis and a sensitivity analysis. However, 
the limitations of this study should be considered. Due to the design of 
the  systematic  review,  a  causal  relationship  with  a  clear  structure 
cannot be obtained. The outcome indicators of both pain (BPI score) 
and perceived social support (PSS score) also had an impact on the 
mental health of university students. However, with only one study 
reporting  these  outcomes,  a  comparison  could  not  be  made,  so 
we  could  not  include  all  outcome  indicators.  Third,  although  all 
included  studies  were  randomized,  the  included  studies’  blinding 
methods  were  seldom  reported  in  detail.  Because  of  the  design 
limitations of the study, only four studies detailed the single blinding 
randomization method. Fourth, potential regulatory variables, such as 
intervention types, missing rates, and control group types, may impact 
the results to varying degrees. Because of the design limitations of the 
study, this study did not analyze the possible influencing factors in a 
stratified manner. Sixth, due to the number of studies included, the 
difficulty arising from carrying out more subgroup analyses may result 
in  study  heterogeneity.  Fifth,  at  the  academic  level,  this  study  was 
performed,  but  at  the  patient  level,  we  find  it  is  a  difficult  task  to 
incorporate or address individual factors. Seventh, since the capability 
of detecting publication bias was limited by the quantity of included 
studies, it is impossible to rule out the possibility of publication bias. 
Eighth, for the same type of outcome index, no prevailing measurement 
instrument was available. Although SMD was selected as the indicator 
for  effect  size,  attention  should  be  given  to  the  result  during 
the interpretation.

5.1 Research and practical implications

For clinical practice, these findings have meaningful implications 
since the use of MBIs plays a role in depression, anxiety, stress and sleep 
quality among university students. First, further research is necessary on 
the methods of increasing participants’ motivation, reducing the missing 
rate,  and  maintaining  the  MBI  effect.  Second,  due  to  the  study 

Frontiers in Public Health

11

frontiersin.org

Zuo et al. 

10.3389/fpubh.2023.1259250

limitations,  it  was  impossible  to  perform  subgroup  analyses  for  the 
intervention types. Consequently, in-depth and stratified discussions and 
comparisons  of  different  intervention  types  were  conducted.  In  the 
coming years, it is necessary for researchers to conduct more quality 
studies  with  ample  samples  to  verify  the  effectiveness  of  MBIs  for 
menopausal women.

6 Conclusion

The results of this study indicated that mindfulness therapy may 
be associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, 
mindfulness therapy may increased the sleep quality of university 
students but did not significantly improve their mindfulness rating 
scores . The current findings emphasize the effects of mindfulness 
therapy on students’ moods. However, to verify the findings of the 
authors, further large-scale and prospective studies are necessary. In 
future studies, adherence and fidelity should be monitored to make 
the association exploration on a more extensive basis. There were trial 
heterogeneity and down-grading Jadad score, which led to the low 
evidence certainty. Therefore, it can only draw limited conclusions.
