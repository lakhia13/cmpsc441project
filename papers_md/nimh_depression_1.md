## What is depression?

Everyone feels sad or low sometimes, but these feelings usually pass with time. Depression (also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is different. It can cause severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. It is an illness that can affect anyone—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors play a role in depression.

## Why is NIMH studying depression?

Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. The symptoms range from mild to severe and can disrupt a person’s ability to carry out everyday activities. It is linked to increased health care costs and other health conditions like heart disease and diabetes. It is also a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

## How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

NIMH is funding and conducting research to learn more about what causes depression, how it affects the brain, and how to treat it effectively. We're working to improve existing treatments like medications, talk therapy (including telehealth and online options), and brain stimulation therapy.

We're investigating ways to identify which treatment will work best for a specific person and tailor treatments based on a person's unique characteristics and traits. We’re supporting research to develop and test therapies for people with treatment-resistant depression who don’t improve after trying multiple treatment options. We are also exploring new methods to prevent and treat depression and improve the delivery of care for people living with depression.
