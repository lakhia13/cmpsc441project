Abstract
Background: Chronic orofacial pain (COFP) is a complex condition that requires
multidisciplinary management grounded in the biopsychosocial model. This study
examined the associations between temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and headache
symptoms and psychological factors within a university-based multidisciplinary care
setting, providing insight into the integration of mental health in COFP management.
Methods: A retrospective review of 162 patient records from the University
of Alberta Multidisciplinary Orofacial Pain Clinic (2020–2023) was conducted.
Psychological assessments included the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale,
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ).
Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between psychological factors and
pain severity. Results: The cohort (aged 13–93) was predominantly female (84.0%).
Fifteen percent declined psychological measures. Significant associations were observed
between PCS (p = 0.036) and IEQ (p = 0.005) scores and reported pain severity.
Moderate-to-high PCS scores were associated with a 3.67-fold increase in the odds of
moderate to severe TMD symptoms (Odds Ratio (OR): 3.67, 95% Confidence Interval
(CI): 1.09–12.35), while high PCS scores predicted severe headaches (OR: 3.91, 95% CI:
1.50–10.17, p = 0.005). Elevated IEQ scores were similarly associated with increased
odds of severe headaches (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.08–7.05, p = 0.034). Conclusions:
Psychological factors such as pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice are strongly
associated with symptom severity of TMD and headache symptoms in COFP. These
findings underscore the importance of integrating targeted psychological assessments
into multidisciplinary care. Further research should explore barriers to implementation
and advance biopsychosocial approaches to improve outcomes for patients with COFP.

1. Introduction

Chronic pain significantly affects patients’ physical and emo-
tional well-being and imposes a substantial financial burden on
healthcare systems [1, 2]. In the United States, 25% of people
reported having pain every day in the previous 3 months [3]. In
Canada, approximately one in five individuals is estimated to
experience chronic pain [4]. Chronic orofacial pain (COFP),
which presents as ongoing discomfort in the face, mouth,
head, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), is commonly linked
to conditions such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD),
trigeminal neuralgia and various headache types [5]. The
persistence and variability of COFP are influenced by psycho-
logical, social, genetic, and environmental factors, including
stress and trauma highlighting the importance of a personal-
ized, multidisciplinary approach to treatment [6].

The biopsychosocial model offers a comprehensive frame-
work for understanding and managing COFP, emphasizing the
integration of biological, psychological and social dimensions
[7]. Pharmacologic interventions target underlying neurobi-
ological mechanisms, while psychological therapies address
maladaptive cognitive and emotional patterns contributing to
chronic pain [8, 9]. Social interventions such as patient ed-
ucation and peer support also play a critical role [10, 11].
Multidisciplinary pain clinics exemplify this model, combin-
ing pharmacological, psychological, and social interventions
to address the complexity of chronic pain. There is strong
evidence that this approach improves pain severity, function,
and psychological outcomes [12].

Psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, and stress
are now recognized as critical modulators of pain perception
and chronicity [13]. Recent research has shifted from general

emotional distress to examining specific psychological con-
structs that influence chronic pain experiences. Tools such as
the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) survey [14, 15], the
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) [16–18] and the Injustice Ex-
perience Questionnaire (IEQ) offer structured ways to identify
vulnerabilities associated with pain amplification, persistence,
and treatment resistance. The ACE survey captures the impact
of early-life adversity on stress regulation and neurobiological
sensitivity [14, 15]. The PCS measures maladaptive thought
patterns like rumination, magnification and helplessness [17,
19]. The IEQ assesses perceived injustice, feelings of unfair-
ness or blame, that may contribute to anger, intrusive thoughts,
and reduced coping capacity [16].

The decision to include the ACE, PCS and IEQ instruments
was guided by the biopsychosocial framework of chronic pain,
with each tool selected for its relevance to psychological mech-
anisms implicated in pain persistence and disability. Specifi-
cally, the ACE captures early-life adversity, the PCS addresses
maladaptive cognitive-emotional responses to pain, and the
IEQ measures perceived injustice, a construct with growing
empirical support in chronic pain literature. While screen-
ing tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-
9), Generalized Anxiety-7 (GAD-7), and Beck Depression
Inventory 2nd Edition (BDI-II) offer insight into broader emo-
tional symptomatology and are standardized in other orofacial
pain literature, our objective was to focus on psychological
constructs with more direct relevance to pain modulation and
functioning. Notably, recent evidence suggests that perceived
injustice not only exacerbates pain-related interference but
also contributes to the progression of depressive symptoms

inclusion in the present study was intended to provide a deeper
understanding of psychosocial risk factors unique to individu-
als with COFP, building upon insights gained from landmark
studies related to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibu-
lar Disorders (DC/TMD) framework [21].

Although psychological distress has been widely studied
in broader chronic pain populations, its specific impact on
chronic orofacial pain subtypes, particularly TMD and chronic
headache, remains underexplored [13]. While the PCS has
been applied to general chronic pain cohorts, its use in oro-
facial multidisciplinary clinics is limited [17, 19]. Similarly,
although the IEQ has been validated in musculoskeletal popu-
lations, it has rarely been applied to COFP cohorts [16]. Few
studies have assessed these psychological constructs within
real-world multidisciplinary care settings where psychological
assessments are embedded into patient management pathways.
Addressing this gap is critical to advancing biopsychosocial
models of COFP care, in particular TMD and headache.

Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the associations
between psychological factors,
including ACE, PCS, and
IEQ scores, and reported pain severity related to TMD
and headaches in patients attending the University of
Alberta’s orofacial multidisciplinary pain clinic (OMPC).
By identifying these associations, we sought
to provide
insight into how integrated psychosocial assessments (Fig. 1),
which illustrate the care model employed at OMPC, could
inform personalized, patient-centered strategies within a
biopsychosocial framework.

2. Material and methods

This retrospective chart review study involved the examination
of consecutive patient records from the Outpatient Chronic
Orofacial Multidisciplinary Pain Clinic, part of the Oral
Medicine Graduate Program Clinic at
the University of
Alberta, Canada. Data were collected for the period between
February 2020 and December 2023 to ensure a comprehensive
sample while also accounting for disruptions resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a six-month clinic
closure from March to August 2020. Ethical approval was
granted by the University of Alberta Research Ethics Board
(Pro00112133_REN3). Due to the retrospective nature of the
study, the requirement for participant consent was waived
by the Ethics Board. The inclusion criteria encompassed all
patients treated at the OMPC during the specified timeframe,
with no exclusions applied. This study was conducted as part
of a larger MSc thesis by Dr. Parvaneh Badri, titled “Analysis
of Referral Pathways, Diagnosis, and Treatment Patterns in
a University-Based Orofacial Multidisciplinary Pain Clinic”,
completed at the University of Alberta, under the supervision
of Dr. Reid Friesen and Dr. Maryam Amin.

The chart review was conducted using a structured ten-
step methodology for retrospective medical record analysis,
as described by Vassar and Matthew (Table 1) [22]. This
approach allowed for systematic and consistent data extraction
aligned with the study’s predefined objectives. Extracted vari-
ables included pre-existing mental health diagnoses, intensity
ratings for jaw and headache pain, and psychological screening
the Adverse
results based on three validated instruments:
Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale, the Pain Catastrophiz-
ing Scale (PCS) and the Injustice Experience Questionnaire
(IEQ). To enhance data quality assurance, a random sample
of 10 records was re-reviewed by the principal investigator
to confirm accuracy and consistency in data entry. While a
formal pilot was not undertaken, this verification step helped
to support the reliability of the review process.

TMD diagnoses were established using the DC/TMD frame-
work, applied by trained clinicians during initial assessment
[21]. This ensured standardized classification within a multi-
disciplinary care context but other variables were not directly
tied to the study’s analytic variables.

In this study, “jaw pain” referred to pain arising from ei-
ther TMJ arthralgia or masticatory myalgia, as defined by
the 2014 DC/TMD criteria. Although these conditions have
different etiologies, both are musculoskeletal disorders of the
masticatory system and present similarly, typically as pain
in the jaw, temple, ear, or preauricular area, often worsened
by jaw movement, function, or parafunctional habits such as
clenching and grinding. Clinical findings commonly include
familiar pain reproduced by palpation or jaw movement tests,
including maximum opening and lateral excursions. Psycho-
logical and behavioral factors, such as stress and anxiety, may
further exacerbate symptoms [23]. For this study, the two
conditions were combined under the umbrella term “jaw pain”
to reflect their overlapping clinical features and the functional
impact experienced by patients. Jaw pain severity was assessed
using a standard 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), with
0 representing no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.
Scores were categorized as no/mild (0–3), moderate (4–6), or
severe (7–10), consistent with the thresholds used for chronic
musculoskeletal pain [24].

In this study, the diagnosis of headaches encompassed pri-
mary headache types, predominantly tension-type headaches
(TTH), with less than 20% classified as migraine headaches,
both with and without aura. Although these headache types dif-
fer in pathophysiology, they frequently co-occur with chronic
orofacial pain, particularly in patients with TMD. Multiple
studies have found that both migraine and TTH are highly
prevalent among TMD populations, with migraine present in
over 40% and TTH in nearly 19% of cases [25, 26]. Headache
pain severity was assessed using a standard 0–10 Numeric
Rating Scale (NRS) completed at clinical intake, where 0 rep-
resented no pain and 10 represented the worst pain imaginable.
Patients were grouped into three categories based on their
reported headache pain and TMD NRS scores: no/mild (0–
3), moderate (4–6) and severe (7–10), following conventions
established in prior pain research. This aligns with established
research, which categorizes pain intensity based on patient-
reported severity using a numerical pain scale, where scores
of 1–3 are mild, 4–6 are moderate, and 7–10 are severe [24,
27, 28].

The psychological and emotional dimensions of pain were
assessed using three validated tools: the ACE survey, the PCS,
and the IEQ. These tools were selected for their ability to pro-
vide a structured framework for evaluating key psychological
factors that influence chronic pain experiences. Scoring of
these three tests is detailed in Table 2. All available patient
charts were incorporated into the descriptive analysis, with no
exclusions applied.

uniformity and dependability in data extraction. Two inde-
pendent reviewers conducted the chart abstraction. Discrep-
ancies between reviewers were resolved through consensus
discussions to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the data.
All patients assessed in the clinic during the study period
were eligible for inclusion. Formal exclusion criteria were not
applied for psychiatric comorbidities, cognitive impairments,
or medical conditions. However, patients with incomplete
psychological assessments or unclear diagnoses were excluded
from the inferential analysis. Those who declined psychologi-
cal screening were still included in descriptive analyses when
demographic and clinical data were available.

2.2 Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 29
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics were applied
to summarize demographic and clinical data, with categori-
cal variables expressed as frequencies and percentages, while
continuous variables were reported as means with standard
deviations.

Associations between psychological variables

(ACE,
PCS and IEQ scores) and response variables (jaw pain and
headaches) were assessed using Pearson’s chi-square test.
Fisher’s exact test was applied when expected cell counts were
less than five. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value
< 0.05. Given the modest sample size, we minimized the risk
of overfitting by grouping predictor variables (ACE, PCS and
IEQ) into low, moderate, and high-risk categories and limiting
the number of predictors included in each logistic regression
model. Although a formal power analysis was not conducted,
findings, particularly those with marginal significance, should
be interpreted with caution.

Logistic regression models were used to assess the rela-
tionship between psychological risk categories and NRS pain
severity (moderate/severe vs. no/mild). Odds ratios (ORs)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to de-
termine the likelihood of experiencing moderate to severe
symptoms based on psychological scores. Pain severity was
dichotomized into “no/mild” and “moderate/severe” categories
for both jaw pain and headaches. Psychological factors (ACE,
PCS and IEQ) were grouped into relevant risk levels based
on validation and utilization of the questionnaire; with ”low
risk” serving as the reference category. Logistic regression

models were limited to psychological predictors to maintain
analytic focus and avoid model overfitting. Although variables
such as age, gender, and socioeconomic factors were available
in some patient records, they were not captured consistently
across participants and exhibited substantial heterogeneity,
precluding their reliable inclusion as covariates.

3. Results

3.1 Descriptive results

A total of 162 patient charts from the OMPC, covering the
period from February 2020 to December 2023, were reviewed.
Patient demographics, including age and gender, were pre-
sented in Table 3. Regarding mental health conditions, 40.1%
of patients reported having two or more diagnoses, while
25.9% had no documented history of a mental health diagnosis.
Anxiety was the most prevalent standalone mental health con-
dition (20.4%), followed by insomnia (5.6%), post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (4.3%), and depression (3.7%).

The most frequently reported primary chief complaint was
TMJ dysfunction, including limited movement and locking,
affecting 43.2% of the cohort. Jaw pain was the second most
common complaint (33.3%), followed by sleep difficulties,
such as bruxism or parafunction (17.3%). Other complaints,
including headaches and ear pain, were reported by 6.3% of
patients (Table 3).

Psychological assessment data indicated that 14.81% (n
= 24) of participants chose not to complete the ACE, PCS
and IEQ tools. Among those who responded, 67.90% were
classified as high risk on the ACE, 25.93% on the PCS and
20.99% on the IEQ (Table 4).

For the final clinical diagnosis, jaw pain, including masti-
catory myalgia and/or TMJ arthralgia, was identified in 140
patients (86.4%). Degenerative changes were noted in 85
patients (52.5%), headaches were diagnosed in 50 patients
(30.9%), and TMJ internal derangements were found in 60
patients (37.0%).

3.2 Inferential results

While chi-square tests found no significant associations for
ACE scores and headache or jaw pain severity, chi-square tests
did show significant associations for PCS and IEQ scores with
headache pain severity. Specifically, moderate PCS scores

were associated with approximately fourfold higher odds of
experiencing moderate to severe TMD symptoms (OR: 3.67,
95% CI: 1.09–12.35, p = 0.036). High PCS scores were also
significantly associated with severe headaches (OR: 3.91, 95%
CI: 1.50–10.17, p = 0.005). Additionally, high IEQ scores
were associated with a 2.76-fold increase in the likelihood of
severe headaches (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.08–7.05, p = 0.034)
(Table 5). Although prior literature suggests that NRS pain
categories may be influenced by catastrophizing tendencies,
the mean PCS scores in our sample fell within the moderate
range. These findings suggested that the applied severity
thresholds were likely appropriate for our population and not
significantly biased by high levels of catastrophizing [24].

4. Discussion

The findings highlight the significant impact of psychological
factors, such as PCS and IEQ, on COFP symptoms, under-
scoring the need for targeted psychological interventions in
multidisciplinary pain management (Fig. 2).

The findings supported our hypothesis, revealing signifi-
cant associations between COFP symptoms and psychological
factors. Moderate and high PCS scores were associated with
greater odds of severe jaw pain and headaches, while elevated
IEQ scores were tied to severe headaches. Interestingly, while
moderate PCS scores were significantly associated with jaw
pain severity, high PCS scores were not, despite similar sample
sizes in each group. One possible explanation for this dis-
crepancy is the presence of unmeasured confounding factors,
such as age, gender and socioeconomic factors, which were
not included in the regression models.
It is also possible
that individuals with high PCS scores reflect a more complex
or heterogeneous subgroup, where psychosocial influences
interact differently with clinical presentation. The exclusion
of potential confounders introduces a risk of residual con-
founding, and thus the observed association in the moderate
PCS group should be interpreted with caution. Conversely, no
significant correlations were identified between ACE scores

and COFP symptoms, despite the notably higher prevalence
of elevated ACE scores in this cohort (67.9%) compared to
the general population (30%). This finding differs from pre-
vious research, which has associated elevated ACE scores
with heightened pain intensity and greater emotional distress
[29–31]. Although ACE scores have been associated with
the development of chronic pain conditions in adulthood [32],
limited research specifically addresses their relationship with
COFP. This finding may reflect differences specific to the
COFP cohort compared to other pain conditions, potentially
influenced by factors such as resilience or social support. Ad-
ditionally, the financial means required for patients to access
our clinic may indicate a unique subset of individuals with
greater resources, which could mitigate some of the impacts
of early-life trauma. These distinctions highlight the need
for further research to explore how such factors modulate
the relationship between ACE scores and COFP symptoms.
Moreover, the retrospective design limited our ability to ex-
amine the type and timing of ACEs in detail, which may
have obscured more specific associations. Specific types of
adverse experiences (e.g., physical assault) may differentially
impact COFP symptoms, but this level of granularity could
not be captured in our retrospective data. For example, it
may be the case that patients who survived physical assault
as children may have more intense COFP symptoms, but this
data was not compared on that granular level. Additionally,
further data about client symptomatology may help clarify this
part of the study. Data regarding PTSD incidence rates in
people exposed to trauma content reports rates between 5.6%
and 9.4%, indicating that this exposure may not be sufficient
for developing trauma symptoms, but rather increase overall
vulnerability [33, 34]. Further nuance and symptom sampling
may clarify this facet of the data.

Similarly, high IEQ scores have been shown to negatively
impact chronic pain management [35], with a systematic re-
view associating IEQ with poorer outcomes in musculoskele-
tal pain conditions [36]. However, no studies to date have
explored the relationship between IEQ and COFP within a

vs. moderate to severe pain. The odds ratios (OR) represent the likelihood of experiencing moderate to severe pain compared
to no to mild pain, based on psychological score levels (low, moderate and high risk). “Low risk” is the reference category for

multidisciplinary orofacial pain setting. This study is among
the first to examine the IEQ in a chronic orofacial pain cohort,
particularly within a multidisciplinary care setting. Our find-
ing that elevated IEQ scores were associated with headache
severity highlights its potential clinical relevance for screening
and management. By contrast, the connection between PCS
and COFP has been studied, though findings suggest that
catastrophizing alone may not be a decisive factor in TMD
outcomes [18].

Mental health conditions were prevalent among the clinic
patients, with 74.1% of patients having at least one mental
health diagnosis, and 40.1% having two or more of anxiety,
depression, PTSD or insomnia. Given the retrospective na-
ture of this study, these diagnoses were derived from chart
review rather than standardized psychiatric interviews, which
may underestimate the true prevalence. These conditions are
known to exacerbate pain perception and complicate treatment
strategies, aligning with prior research [37, 38]. The high
prevalence of anxiety and depression, in particular, under-
scores the need for integrated psychological interventions.
Strategies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy are considered
to be the gold standard in treating these features and further
inclusion of techniques from this modality may be particu-
larly effective in addressing these comorbidities [39]. The
overlap between COFP and mental health disorders under-

scores the importance of treatment strategies that target both
physical pain and psychological well-being. Therefore, im-
plementing a multidisciplinary approach that combines phys-
ical, psychological, and social aspects of care is essential
for improving patient outcomes [38]. For example, novel
treatment/assessment paradigms such as the “Life Stress EAET
Model” [40] may assist clinicians in gathering historical data
while reducing patient stress symptoms. Emerging literature
highlights the role of structural and physiological factors, such
as sleep-disordered breathing, cervical posture, vagal nerve
involvement and craniofacial morphology, in modulating both
pain and psychological symptoms [41, 42]. Features like
retrognathia, narrow dental arches, Class II malocclusion, and
vertical growth patterns may reduce airway space and im-
pair sleep, contributing to altered pain processing and neuro-
transmitter imbalances, including gamma-aminobutyric ccid
(GABA)-related mechanisms [43]. Although these variables
were not captured in our dataset, we acknowledge their clin-
ical relevance and recommend that future studies incorpo-
rate airway and structural assessments alongside psychologi-
cal screening to better understand the multifactorial nature of
chronic orofacial pain.

To enhance statistical robustness and maintain analytic sta-
bility, we dichotomized pain severity scores for both jaw
and headache symptoms into “no/mild” and “moderate/severe”

categories. This decision was methodologically grounded in
the context of our retrospective design and modest sample size,
where overly granular categorization would have increased
the risk of model overfitting and reduced the power to detect
meaningful associations. In clinical pain research, particularly
in studies involving patient-reported outcomes such as the
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), dichotomization is frequently
used to facilitate interpretability, simplify model structure,
and highlight clinically relevant thresholds of symptom sever-
ity. The thresholds applied in this study are consistent with
previously validated cutoffs in chronic musculoskeletal pain
populations [24].

Many of this study’s limitations stem from its retrospec-
tive design. Psychological questionnaire data were missing
for 14.8% of participants, potentially impacting our findings.
Patients cited non-completion reasons such as mistrust in the
healthcare system, stigma surrounding psychological condi-
tions and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which

also led to a six-month clinic closure. Financial barriers related
to the fee-for-service model may have further limited access for
some patients, introducing selection bias. Due to inconsistent
documentation, we were unable to apply formal exclusion
criteria for important confounding factors such as severe psy-
chiatric disorders, cognitive impairments, substance use, and
systemic medical conditions. Similarly, variables such as age,
sex, sociodemographic characteristics, and prior mental health
conditions were not consistently recorded and thus were not
incorporated into regression models. Although the sample size
and event rates would have supported additional predictors, we
deliberately restricted the analysis to psychological variables.
Important potential confounders were not included because the
underlying data were incomplete and highly heterogeneous.
As a result, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be
excluded and should be considered when interpreting the study
findings. In addition, our reliance on self-reported measures
introduces potential reporting bias, and the generalizability

160

of the results may be limited to multidisciplinary, university-
based clinic populations. While dichotomization can reduce
statistical power and obscure subtle gradations in symptom
intensity, in our context it provided a streamlined analytic
framework that enabled robust detection of significant asso-
ciations between psychological constructs and pain severity
[44, 45]. This approach was particularly important given
the exploratory nature of the study and the need to balance
statistical rigor with practical constraints inherent in real-world
clinical datasets. Nonetheless, we recognize that this ana-
lytic choice may have attenuated sensitivity to specific patient
subgroups, particularly those experiencing overlapping TMD
and headache symptoms, and may have contributed to the
absence of significant findings in some comparisons. Although
widely used tools such as the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were not
included, our focus on the ACE, PCS, and IEQ reflected a
targeted effort to examine psychological constructs directly
relevant to chronic orofacial pain mechanisms. Despite these
limitations, the findings underscore the critical role of psy-
chological factors in jaw pain and headache management.
The observed associations between PCS and IEQ scores and
pain severity suggest that multidisciplinary clinics may benefit
from routine psychological screening to identify patients at
higher risk for severe symptoms.
Incorporating these tools
into clinical intake could support targeted referrals to thera-
pies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, while also enabling
tailored education, improved communication about prognosis
and strategies to enhance adherence. This integrated approach
may be especially valuable for patients with high levels of
perceived injustice or maladaptive pain beliefs, and supports
the broader implementation of biopsychosocial care models in
COFP treatment.

Future research should investigate how psychological fac-
tors, including ACE, PCS and IEQ, contribute to the persis-
tence and progression of chronic orofacial pain over time.
Longitudinal designs with larger, more diverse samples would

rate assessments of airway patency, sleep quality, Mallampati
score, vagal tone, and craniofacial and cervical posture, as
these variables may influence pain modulation through au-
tonomic and neurochemical mechanisms. Anatomical fea-
tures such as retrognathia, narrow dental arches, and vertical
growth patterns have been associated with reduced airway
space, which may contribute to alterations in neurotransmitter
systems such as GABA, with downstream effects on both
pain and psychological symptoms. Evaluating the contribu-
tion of these physical and physiological variables alongside
validated psychological measures would help clarify the com-
plex interplay between somatic and emotional dimensions of
chronic orofacial pain. Further, research into the effectiveness
of targeted interventions addressing cognitive and affective
processes, including perceived injustice, remains a promising
direction. Attention should also be given to reducing barri-
ers that limit engagement with psychological screening and
care, including stigma, mistrust, and lack of access. Finally,
prospective designs should include standardized collection of
demographic, psychological, and clinical variables to support

more refined modeling and control of potential confounders.

5. Conclusions

This study underscores the importance of psychological fac-
tors, such as PCS and IEQ scores, in COFP, particularly their
association with severe jaw pain and headaches. Integrating
psychological assessments into multidisciplinary management
is crucial to address the cognitive and emotional aspects of
COFP. Although no significant association was identified be-
tween ACE scores and COFP symptoms, the notably high
prevalence of elevated ACE scores emphasizes the need for
further investigation into the impact of early-life trauma on
various chronic pain conditions. Future research should aim
to expand the biopsychosocial understanding of COFP and in-
form the creation of comprehensive, patient-centered treatment
strategies. As chronic orofacial pain continues to challenge
traditional care models, studies like this one underscore the
urgency of integrating psychological assessment and support
into front-line dental and medical care.
