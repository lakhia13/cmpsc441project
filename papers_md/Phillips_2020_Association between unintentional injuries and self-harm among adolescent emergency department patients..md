Abstract

Background—Unintentional injury, a leading cause of morbidity among adolescents, may also 
be a risk factor for deliberate self-harm. To inform clinical and public health prevention efforts in 
adolescent populations, we examined whether distinct subtypes of unintentional injury were 
differentially associated with deliberate self-harm.

Methods—Statewide, all-payer, individually linkable administrative data on adolescent patients 
presenting to any California emergency department (ED) in 2010 (n=490,071) were used to 
investigate longitudinal associations between subtypes of unintentional injury and deliberate self-
harm. Adolescents aged 10–19 years presenting with unintentional drug poisoning, other 
poisoning, fall, suffocation, or cutting/piercing injuries formed the exposure groups; adolescents

presenting with unintentional strike injuries formed the primary referent group. Study patients 
were followed back in time (2006–2009) to compare the groups’ odds of a prior ED visit for 
deliberate self-harm, as well as forwards in time (2010–2015) to compare their risks of subsequent 
self-harm.

Results—Unintentional drug-poisoning injury was strongly associated with increased likelihood 
of ED visits for deliberate self-harm, assessed both retrospectively (adjusted OR=4.52; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 3.08, 6.64) and prospectively (adjusted RR=3.74; 95% CI=3.03, 4.60). 
Positive associations with odds of prior self-harm and/or risk of subsequent self-harm were also 
observed for patients with unintentional non-drug poisoning, suffocation, and cutting/piercing 
injuries.

Conclusions—Certain subtypes of unintentional injury, particularly drug poisoning, are strongly 
associated with risk for deliberate self-harm among adolescents, a finding with implications for 
targeting clinical assessment and intervention in emergency department settings. More research is 
needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these associations.

INTRODUCTION

Unintentional and deliberate self-harm injuries are leading causes of morbidity among 
adolescents in the United States.1,2 In 2017, adolescents made 3.2 million emergency 
department (ED) visits for unintentional injury (UI) and 132,000 ED visits for deliberate 
self-harm.3 Determining intent among injury patients has long been recognized as a 
challenge,4,5 and many “accidental” injuries may actually involve suicidal or self-harm 
intent.4–9 This may be particularly true in adolescents, who engage in deliberate self-harm at 
higher rates than any other age group3,10 yet frequently deny or lack awareness of self-
injurious intent at the time of clinical assessment.11,12 There is also a small literature 
reporting that unintentional injury serves as an independent risk factor for subsequent self-
harm, including among adolescents.13–15 A better understanding of the association between 
unintentional injury and deliberate self-harm could inform clinical and public health 
prevention efforts aimed at reducing injury morbidity in adolescence.

One question of particular clinical relevance is how distinct subtypes of adolescent 
unintentional injury are associated with risk for deliberate self-harm, as specificity in this 
association would have immediate implications for patient screening, treatment and referral 
protocols. Two prior studies have reported positive associations between experiencing any 
nonfatal UI and risk of subsequent self-harm, but did not investigate how this relationship 
varied by UI subtype.14,15 Different UIs occur at markedly different rates – for example, 
injuries caused by the patient being struck by/against an object are far more common than 
unintentional poisonings16 – and some UI subtypes are likely to be more strongly associated 
with deliberate self-harm than others. Unintentional poisoning, fall, suffocation, and cut/
piercing injuries, especially, are relatively infrequent but may be likely to share common 
etiologic factors with deliberate self-harm (e.g., poor executive functioning, impulsivity, and 
psychopathology).17–19

The goal of the current study was to examine longitudinal, within-individual associations 
between key unintentional injury subtypes and deliberate self-harm in an adolescent ED

patient population. We identified distinct groups of adolescents presenting with the UI 
subtypes of interest and compared their relative frequencies of both prior history of any 
deliberate self-harm ED visit as well as their subsequent risk for self-harm. We focused on 
adolescents presenting with the UI subtypes identified above as most plausibly linked to 
deliberate self-harm behavior: poisonings, falls, suffocation, and cutting/piercing injuries. 
We compared each of these groups to two separate referent groups. The first referent group 
was adolescents with unintentional strike injuries, which we chose because strike injuries 
(many of which are sports-related)19 are the leading cause of unintentional injury among 
adolescents.1,15 The second referent group was all adolescents seen for any other condition, 
including both other injuries and non-injury complaints. These separate analyses allowed us 
to examine how the magnitude of any excess risk among adolescent UI patient subtypes 
changed based on the composition of the comparison group.

METHODS

Data

This study used nonpublic individual-level ED data from all California state-licensed 
hospitals for the years 2006 through 2015, provided by the California Office of Statewide 
Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). For this study, the dataset consisted of ED 
records for all adolescent patients aged 10 to 19 years with a unique identifier (encrypted 
social security number) and a California residential zip code in 2010 (n=490,071). 
Adolescents with missing sex and/or age were excluded. Unique identifiers were used to link 
multiple ED visits per patient for several years, including encounters at any ED in the state 
prior (2006–2009) and subsequent (2010–2015) to the adolescent’s index visit to an ED in 
2010 (defined below).

Definition of the study groups

We defined five patient exposure groups using each patient’s primary International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) External 
Cause of Injury code (E-code) at his or her index visit, defined as the first visit to the ED 
with an unintentional injury in 2010. The five exposure groups comprised patients with: (1) 
unintentional drug poisoning (ICD-9-CM codes E850E858); (2) unintentional poisoning 
from non-drug substances (E860-E869); (3) unintentional fall injury (E880-E888); (4) 
unintentional suffocation injury (E910-E915); and (5) unintentional cutting/piercing injury 
(E920). For the first analyses, the reference group was defined as adolescent patients whose 
first ED visit in 2010 included a primary E-code diagnosis of E917, an injury caused by the 
individual striking against or being struck unintentionally by objects or persons (hereafter 
termed “strike-injury reference patients”). This type of injury is the leading cause of nonfatal 
UI among youths aged 10–19.16,20 The second set of analyses compared the five UI 
exposure groups to all other adolescent ED patients who presented for any other condition in 
2010 (“general reference patients”). Each reference patient’s index visit was defined as his 
or her first visit in 2010.

Outcome measures

Page 4

Covariates

The study outcome was ED visits for deliberate self-harm, assessed in both follow-back and 
follow-forward analyses. A deliberate self-harm ED visit was defined as one with a primary 
diagnostic position of ICD-9-CM code of E950.0-E958.x. Codes E950–958 do not 
distinguish between events involving self-inflicted injury with intent to die and those 
involving no lethal intent (i.e., non-suicidal self-injury); therefore, our case definition 
captured both kinds of injury events. We assessed both patients’ odds of a prior self-harm 
visit (follow-back analyses) and their prospective risk of any self-harm visit (follow-forward 
analyses). Observation for follow-back analyses began on January 1, 2006 (the earliest year 
high-quality ED data are available) and ended on December 31, 2009. Observation for 
follow-forward analyses began on the date following each patient’s index visit and ended on 
Sept. 30, 2015, to avoid diagnosis misclassification problems related to the mandatory 
transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD10-CM coding on Oct. 1, 2015.21

Characteristics at index visit—Patient-level characteristics assessed at index visit 
included age, sex, race/ethnicity (collapsed into White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific 
Islander, or other), and payer type (collapsed into private insurance, Medicaid, self-pay, or 
other).

Patient visit histories—For each patient, we constructed a visit history variable 
indicating the total number of ED visits made in the four years prior to 2010 (2006–2009), 
which was used in both the follow-back and prospective risk analyses. We considered this 
variable a measure of patients’ overall propensity to use the ED, which would influence their 
subsequent likelihood of visiting the ED for unintentional injury and deliberate self-harm 
injury.14 Patient visit history of any self-harm visit (ICD-9CM codes E950.0-E958) was also 
included as a covariate in the prospective risk analyses, to control for the fact that families 
and providers may be more likely to recommend that an adolescent engaging in self-harm 
behavior go to the ED if he or she has previously received ED treatment for a similar crisis.

Statistical Analyses

For the follow-back analyses, each unintentional injury group’s odds of a prior deliberate 
self-harm visit was compared to that of the reference group using logistic regression models. 
Covariates for this model included patient demographic characteristics assessed at index 
visit and total ED visit history. For the follow-forward analyses, we estimated risk ratios 
(RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to assess whether risk of having a 
subsequent self-harm visit differed between the five UI exposure groups when compared to 
the reference group. Covariates for this model included patient demographic characteristics 
assessed at index visit, patient’s total ED visit history, and the prior self-harm visit history 
variable, to account for the fact that prior serious self-harm is strongly predictive of ED 
utilization for subsequent self-harm.14 Risk ratio models used robust standard errors and 
included an offset term comprising each patient’s follow-up time in days, to account for 
patients’ repeated observations over time and their varying index visit dates.

For both models, the five unintentional injury groups of interest were first compared to the 
strike-injury reference group. We then replicated both analyses using the general reference 
group. STATA 15 (College Station, Texas) was used for all analyses.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics assessed at index visit and during 2006–2009 for the five 
unintentional injury exposure groups, and the strike-injury reference group, are shown in 
Table 1. Of the five exposure groups, unintentional falls (n=39,591) and unintentional 
cutting (n=11,679) were the most common injuries. On average, patients in the exposure 
groups were 14.8 years old at index visit and 36.8% were female. However, unintentional 
drug poisoning patients were slightly older, with an average age of 16.3 years (SD=2.3); fall 
patients were the youngest, with an average age of 14.4 years (SD=2.9). Females were the 
minority in all injury groups except for the unintentional drug poisoning group, in which 
females made up 55.4% of the group. Although the relative proportions differed by patient 
group, the majority of patients were either White or Hispanic, and most used either private 
insurance or Medicaid. Patients in the strike-injury reference group were slightly less likely 
than the exposure-group patients to be female, but were similar in other respects.

Percentages of each UI exposure group with a prior or subsequent ED visit for deliberate 
self-harm, and results from multivariate models using strike-injury patients as the referent 
group, are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. Patients in the unintentional drug-poisoning group 
were most likely to experience the outcomes: 2.7% had a prior self-harm visit and 7.0% 
made a subsequent self-harm visit. Compared to strike-injury patients, patients in the 
unintentional drug-poisoning group had four-fold higher odds of a prior self-harm visit (OR 
= 4.52, 95% CI = 3.08, 6.64) and 3.7-fold higher risk of a subsequent self-harm visit (RR = 
3.74, 95% CI = 3.03, 4.64). Patients in the unintentional suffocation and cutting/piercing 
injury groups, meanwhile, had nearly two-fold higher odds of a prior self-harm visit. These 
patients also exhibited elevated risk of subsequent self-harm, but at a smaller magnitude 
compared to unintentional drug-poisoning patients. Patients with index injuries for 
poisoning from non-drug substances had elevated risk for subsequent but not prior self-
harm.

We then re-ran all analyses using the general reference group comprised of all other 
adolescent ED patients (n=434,228). The most common primary diagnoses among this 
reference group included sprains and strains (7.2%), abdominal pain (6.8%), and upper 
respiratory infections (2.7%). Less than 1% (n=3,679, or 0.9%) had a prior deliberate self-
harm visit, and 2.2% (n=9,714) made a subsequent self-harm visit. With these patients as the 
referent group, associations between unintentional drug poisoning and both self-harm 
outcomes were reduced in magnitude but remained statistically significant (Table 3). Cutting 
injury patients also had elevated odds for prior deliberate self-harm. Increased risk of self-
harm was seen among patients with poisoning by non-drug substances (RR=1.63, 95% CI = 
1.12, 2.37) and among those with suffocation injuries (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.64). 
Unintentional fall patients were at reduced likelihood of both prior and subsequent self-harm 
visits when compared with the general reference patient group.

DISCUSSION

Page 6

This is the first study, to our knowledge, that uses longitudinal population-based emergency 
department data to examine associations between different subtypes of unintentional injury 
and deliberate self-harm among adolescents. We found that adolescents with drug-poisoning 
injuries consistently demonstrated the highest risk for self-harm, both prospectively and 
retrospectively, although there were also significant positive associations between several 
other types of unintentional injury – including non-drug poisoning, cutting/piercing, and 
suffocation – and self-harm. We also found that fall patients were at lower risk of self-harm. 
We conclude that all subcategories of unintentional injury patients included in this study 
appear to be at excess risk of self-harm, with the exception of fall patients.

Various factors may explain why adolescents who seek ED care for ostensibly accidental 
poisoning, cutting/piercing, and suffocation injuries experience elevated risk of self-harm 
ED visits. First, underlying vulnerability factors may predispose adolescents to both 
unintentional injury and self-harm behavior. Such factors include poor executive 
functioning, impulsivity, and psychopathology,17–19 lack of parental supervision and low 
familial socioeconomic status;17,22 and involvement with risk-taking peers.17,23 Second, the 
strong association we observed specifically between visiting the ED for accidental drug 
overdose and for self-harm may arise from access to over-the-counter or prescription drugs.
24,25 Our findings thus reinforce the importance of restricting access to such drugs and 
educating adolescents about the risks of abusing drugs, especially among those with 
histories of mental health problems.26,27 It is possible that clinicians would be more likely to 
interpret a new injury as involving self-harm if the patient has a history of prior drug 
overdose. Third, unintentional injury may also influence adolescents’ risk of subsequent 
self-harm through direct causal pathways. Serious injuries can result in psychological 
trauma,28 significant recovery periods during which the adolescent is isolated from peer-
based social support networks,29 and depression symptoms stemming from adjustment to a 
new disability, systemic inflammation pathways, or other injury-related effects.30,31 These 
processes may, over time, give rise to psychological disorder, suicidal thoughts and self-
harm behavior. Future research is needed to separate out the independent contributions of 
these various processes to the observed associations between unintentional injury and self-
harm.

The magnitude of our estimates differed according to specification of the reference group 
(strike-injury patients vs. all other patients). When using strike-injured patients as the 
reference group, the relative risks for self-harm visits among drug-poisoning adolescents 
were substantially larger, and unintentional suffocation and cutting/piercing injury patients 
had significantly elevated risk. When using all other patients as the reference group, 
however, the signal was more mixed. The likeliest explanation for these differences is that 
the general reference group included a substantial number of patients who sought care in 
2010 for self-harm and/or mental health problems, who therefore would be expected to 
experience higher-than-average likelihood of prior or subsequent self-harm. Whether 
adolescent strike-injury patients, or the general population of adolescent ED patients, should 
be viewed as the most relevant comparison group may depend on each clinician’s specific 
clinical context and the composition of the patient pool.

Prior research reports that unintentional injury in youth is an independent risk factor for 
subsequent self-harm.14,15 Our results temper and clarify this conclusion, by indicating that 
certain subtypes of unintentional injury – drug poisoning, other kinds of poisoning, and 
suffocation and cutting patients – convey the majority of this excess risk. From a clinical 
perspective, emergency department providers should incorporate this information when 
diagnosing, treating, and referring injured adolescent patients; moreover, interventions 
aimed at early identification and mental health risk reduction among adolescents should 
consider specifically targeting those with a documented history of unintentional overdose, 
cutting, and suffocation injuries. In addition, future research should incorporate independent 
assessments of injured adolescent patients’ self-harm intent, to further elucidate the extent to 
which diagnostic misclassification may be responsible for the associations we observed here. 
Future research should also attempt to identify the causal relationships underlying the 
associations between unintentional injuries and self-harm (e.g., shared propensity for 
impulsivity). In doing so, there would be an opportunity for the development of targeted 
clinical assessment and treatment of these causal factors, further improving clinical 
interventions. For example, adolescents presenting with unintentional poisoning and 
suffocation injuries could be flagged for suicide risk screening and potential referral to 
outpatient mental health services.32

This study had several limitations. First, diagnostic coding in administrative healthcare 
datasets is known to contain inaccuracies, and classification of injury intent is particularly 
difficult;33,34 therefore, misclassification of intent among the injured adolescent patients in 
our data is likely present. Because the administrative dataset did not contain detailed 
information from clinician notes, we were unable to perform a validation study confirming 
whether the diagnostic codes truly matched the clinical description of the visits. Similarly, 
because codes E950–958 do not distinguish between events involving self-inflicted injury 
with intent to die and those involving no lethal intent (i.e., non-suicidal self-injury), we 
could not distinguish between these types of injury events in our outcome definition. This 
study also created mutually exclusive patient groups to which adolescents were assigned 
based on their index injury type. Some adolescents may have received diagnoses for multiple 
injuries during their index visit and/or visited the ED multiple times for injuries during the 
study period; we think it unlikely, however, that alternative groupings would substantively 
change our findings. We also lacked the ability to longitudinally track adolescents whose ED 
records did not contain a unique identifier (approximately 30%).14 Lastly, there may be 
unobserved confounders that we could not control for in our administrative dataset.

Our study also had several notable strengths. The data are population-based, and the study 
was conducted in California, where E-coding has been mandatory for 20 years. Additional 
advantages include our ability to track patients longitudinally as they made visits to any ED 
in California, follow-up periods of several years, and statistical controls for patients’ prior 
ED utilization patterns.

Results from this study have the potential to improve clinical practice by highlighting a 
population of adolescent patients – those with unintentional drug and non-drug poisoning 
overdose, cutting, and suffocation injuries – who exhibit elevated risk of self-harm, but 
whose need for mental health services might otherwise go unrecognized. Future studies
