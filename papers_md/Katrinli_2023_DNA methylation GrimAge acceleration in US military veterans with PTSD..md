Epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation might mediate gene expression effects of trauma underlying PTSD symptoms, or effects of
PTSD on related health problems. PTSD is associated with all-cause morbidity and premature mortality, suggesting accelerated
biological aging. We measured genome-wide DNA methylation (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) in whole blood in a treatment
study for combat-related PTSD - “PROGrESS”, a multisite RCT comparing sertraline plus enhanced medication management
(SERT + EMM), prolonged exposure (PE) therapy plus placebo (PE + PLB), and the combination (SERT + PE). DNA methylation was
measured in 140 US military veterans who served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan (112 current PTSD cases enrolled in a PTSD treatment
study and 28 veterans without PTSD history controls), and also 59 non-trauma exposed controls at baseline posttreatment (24 weeks
after baseline). Increased DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration (p = 8.8e−09) was observed in patients with PTSD compared to a
pooled control group (trauma exposed and non-trauma exposed), suggesting a higher risk of premature mortality in those with PTSD.
There was no difference in GrimAge acceleration between combat trauma and non-trauma exposed controls. No treatment-related
changes in GrimAge acceleration were found in within-subject comparisons of PTSD patients pre- to post-treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Trauma burden and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may
potentially lead to poor health outcomes, higher risk of chronic
medical conditions, and mortality, independent of lifestyle factors
[1–5]. This higher risk of mortality may be due to accelerated
cellular aging, which is a potential consequence of dysregulated
autonomic function and increased oxidative stress and inﬂamma-
tion, often observed in those with PTSD [6–8].

[6, 13, 14].

Cellular aging is associated with highly reliable changes in the
epigenome; hence, investigators have been able to leverage DNA
methylation data to design epigenetic clocks that accurately
capture age [9–12]. Multiple studies
that used Hannum’s
epigenetic clock showed that individuals with PTSD have higher
DNAm age values compared to their chronological age (i.e., DNAm
age acceleration)
In contrast, studies that used
Horvath’s epigenetic clock reported that DNAm age acceleration
was negatively associated with PTSD [15] and development of
PTSD symptoms [16]. The most recent epigenetic clock, DNAm
is a better predictor of age-related health outcomes
GrimAge,
(e.g., time to death, cancer, and coronary heart disease) compared
to earlier clocks, since it has been speciﬁcally trained on time-to-
death, as well as age-related biochemical markers and smoking
packs per year [12]. Recent evidence demonstrates a signiﬁcant
association between PTSD and GrimAge acceleration [17–19].
Speciﬁcally, in a predominantly African American cohort, Katrinli

et al. showed that individuals with current and lifetime PTSD have
accelerated GrimAge, which also associated with cortical thickness
in brain areas related to emotion processing and threat response
[17]. Yang et al. reported accelerated GrimAge in male veterans
with PTSD, as well as a signiﬁcant positive association between
longitudinal increases in GrimAge acceleration and increases in
PTSD symptoms at 3-years follow-up [18]. The longitudinal study
from Mehta et al. demonstrated that
following exposure to
traumatic events, PTSD symptom severity score associated with
accelerated GrimAge [19]. The association between PTSD and
accelerated GrimAge might partly be explained by immune
system dysfunction, since GrimAge acceleration is associated with
decreased lymphocyte and increased neutrophil proportions (i.e.,
higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), which is an indicator of
immune senescence and inﬂammation [12, 17].

PTSD can be effectively treated with medications or psychother-
apy, and PTSD in veterans is most commonly treated with a
combination of medication and psychotherapy [20]. The VA/DOD
PTSD Treatment Clinical Practice Guidelines [21] (VA/DOD, 2017)
recommend both trauma-focused psychotherapy (e.g., prolonged
exposure (PE) therapy) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) as effective treatments for PTSD. Indeed, the treated veterans
we examined in the current genetic analyses were enrolled in a
randomized controlled trial of PTSD treatment symptom outcome
that included PE + SERT, SERT + EMM, and PE + PLB. a “head-to-

[22]. Successful

To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have examined
the effect of PTSD treatment and PTSD remission on GrimAge
acceleration prospectively. So far, one cross-sectional study reported
that GrimAge acceleration did not signiﬁcantly differ between
current PTSD cases and individuals who do not meet current PTSD
criteria but had a previous history of PTSD, suggesting that the effect
of PTSD on GrimAge acceleration might not be reversible [17] or
might reﬂect differences that were present prior to trauma exposure.
In the present study, we ﬁrst aimed to evaluate the association
between PTSD and mortality at baseline, using the most recent
epigenetic predictor of
lifespan, GrimAge. Then, we sought to
investigate whether the impact of PTSD on accelerated GrimAge
might be reversible by PTSD treatment and PTSD remission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The participants included in the study were part of a larger study of the
PROlonGed ExpoSure and Sertraline Trial (PROGrESS), a four-site [VA Ann
Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS), Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center
(CHSVAMC), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and VA San Diego
Healthcare System (VASDHCS) randomized-controlled trial (RCT; N = 223),
designed to examine: (1) the comparative effectiveness of Prolonged
Exposure plus placebo (PE/PLB), Sertraline plus Enhanced Medication
Management (SERT/EMM), or combined treatment (PE/SERT) on PTSD, and
(2) neurobiological predictors and potential biomarkers of treatment
response including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, brain, and genetic/
genomic biomarkers [22, 25]. PROGrESS was approved by the institutional
review boards at VHAAAHS,
the University of Michigan, VASDHCS,
CHSVAMC, MGH and the Department of Defense Human Research
Protection Ofﬁce. Participants provided written informed consent before
enrollment. Participants and clinicians were blinded to pill condition
through week 24, and independent evaluators were blinded to treatment
assignments for the duration of the study.

The PROGrESS study methods were published in detail [22, 25]. Brieﬂy,
inclusion criteria were service members or veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan
wars with combat-related PTSD and signiﬁcant impairment (Clinicians-
Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV [CAPS-IV] [26] score ≥ 50) of at least
3 months’ duration. Exclusion criteria included factors related to safety and
appropriateness of psychotherapy and sertraline treatment [25, 27].

Measures
Demographics, childhood adversity, and combat experiences history were
obtained by self-report at intake, and psychiatric symptoms were assessed
by self-report and clinician-administered measures at intake and weeks 6,
12, 24, 36, and 52; blinding was broken at week 24. Adverse childhood
experiences were assessed by the Deployment Risk and Resilience
Inventory (DRRI) section A - Prior Stressors [28] using a 0–5 point score
of dichotomous endorsement (yes vs no) of physical, sexual, and emotional
abuse items. Exposure to combat trauma was measured with the Combat
Experiences Scale (CES) [29]. PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity in the
past month were measured with the CAPS-IV (for DSM-IV) clinician
interview [26], and self-reported symptoms of PTSD were assessed using
the PTSD Checklist [PCL] Speciﬁc Stressor Version [30]. PTSD remission was
deﬁned as a CAPS score of 35 or less at week 24 (or last observed CAPS
score) [22]. Additional details on measures can be found in the methods
and main outcomes publications [22, 25].

samples were centrifuged at 4 C at 2000 × g to separate plasma from
cellular components, and care was taken to exclude buffy coat (white
blood cells, WBC) from the supernatant. Separate aliquots of packed red
blood cells + buffy coat WBC pellet and plasma supernatant were frozen,
stored at −80C, and shipped to VAAAHS overnight on dry ice with no
thaw. Genomic DNA extracted from blood pellets was assayed using the
Methylation EPIC BeadChip (Illumina, Inc) at the University of Michigan
Advanced Genomics Core. R package CpGassoc was used for quality
control steps, including (i) removal of samples with probe detection call
rates <90% and an average intensity value of either <50% of
the
experiment-wide sample mean or <2000 arbitrary units; (ii) setting probes
with detection p values >0.01 as missing; and (iii) ﬁltering out missing
probes for >10% of samples [31]. Probes that were known to cross-
hybridize between autosomes and sex chromosomes were ﬁltered out
[32]. Methylation data was preprocessed and normalized using single-
sample Noob background correction implemented in R package minﬁ [33].
Batch effects of chip and position were removed using ComBat [34].

calculator

GrimAge and GrimAge acceleration (i.e., age-adjusted GrimAge) were
computed using the DNA methylation age
(https://
dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/new) [12]. DNA methylation data were used
to estimate cellular heterogeneity (i.e., the proportion of CD8 + T, CD4 + T,
natural killer (NK), B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils), using the Robust
Partial Correlation method implemented in R package Epidish [35] and the
blood reference panel generated by Salas and colleagues [36]. To validate
our ﬁndings regarding changes in cellular composition, we also used
Houseman method [37] with the blood reference panel generated by
Reinius et al. [38] as an alternative. DNA methylation data was used to
generate methylation-based ancestry principal components
(mPCs),
following the method described by Barﬁeld et al. [39]. The components
mPC1 and mPC2 correlated most with self-reported ancestry (Spearman
rho = 0.75, p < 2.2e−16 for mPC1 and Spearman rho = −0.81, p < 2.2e−16
for mPC2; Fig. S1) and were included as covariates in subsequent analyses
to adjust for ancestry. DNA methylation based smoking scores for each
sample were computed using the weights of 39 CpG sites associated with
smoking pack years [40], as previously described [41].

Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration
IL-6 levels were measured in the plasma (supernatant) using Immulite™
(Siemens,
Inc.), a rapid highly sensitive and precise semi-automated
chemiluminescent assay that has an intra-assay variability of <5%.

Statistical analysis
We tested the correlations between GrimAge acceleration and potential
confounders, including sex, self-reported ancestry, cellular heterogeneity,
and methylation-derived smoking score. Associations of GrimAge accel-
eration with trauma exposure and PTSD at baseline were evaluated using
linear regression models, adjusting for sex, methylation-based ancestry
principal components (mPC1 and mPC2), and the estimated proportions of
CD8 + T, CD4 + T, NK, B cells and monocytes. Pre- to post-treatment
differences in CAPS, cellular variables,
IL-6 concentration, and GrimAge
acceleration were assessed by non-parametric paired samples Wilcoxon
tests, since the variables are not normally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk
normality test, p < 0.05). To evaluate whether the pre- to post-treatment
change in GrimAge acceleration associated with PTSD remission (as
dichotomous PTSD remission variable and as percent change in CAPS
score), we conducted longitudinal analyses using linear regression models,
where post-treatment GrimAge acceleration was modeled as a function of
PTSD remission (as dichotomous PTSD remission variable and as percent
change in CAPS score), while adjusting for pre-treatment GrimAge
acceleration,
in
estimated CD8T+, CD4T+, NK, B cell, and monocyte cell proportions.
Since smoking has already been included in training of GrimAge, we did
not include methylation-derived smoking score as a covariate in our initial
analyses, as this redundance could introduce error due to overﬁtting
for signiﬁcant ﬁndings, we conducted post-hoc
of models. However,

correlated with GrimAge acceleration either at baseline or at
post-treatment (Fig. S3).

Although CAPS score signiﬁcantly declined after 24 weeks post-
treatment (p < 2.2e−16), we did not observe a signiﬁcant change
in GrimAge acceleration pre- to post-treatment (p = 0.14; Table S1).
In addition, the change in GrimAge acceleration did not associate
with percent change in CAPS score and PTSD remission (Table S5).

Changes in cellular variables and GrimAge acceleration based

signiﬁcant differences in remission (Rauch et al., 2019), PTSD
in SERT + EMM and

sample (Tables S2 and S3). The demographic analysis conducted
in this smaller sub-sample was not adjusted for site, sex, or
baseline CAPS. GrimAge acceleration did not signiﬁcantly change

treatment arm (Table S3).
Furthermore,
the change in GrimAge acceleration did not
associate with percent change in CAPS score and PTSD remission
in either treatment group (Table S5). However, the estimated
proportions of CD4T, CD8T, and B cells were decreased in
SERT + PE, and neutrophil proportions were elevated in both
SERT + EMM and SERT + PE after treatment (Table S3, Fig. 3),
which may indicate dysregulated immune response in these

DISCUSSION
Recent consortium studies show that PTSD associates with
changes in DNA methylation patterns involved in inﬂammatory
and oxidative stress pathways [42–44].
In addition to the
alterations in DNA methylation signatures, PTSD is associated
with accelerated GrimAge, which is an epigenetic marker of
mortality [12, 17–19]. While some previous studies show PTSD-
associated changes in DNA methylation markers were reversed
with successful treatment [24, 45], the effect of PTSD treatment
and remission on accelerated GrimAge is yet to be elucidated.

In our sample and consistent with previous ﬁndings, PTSD
associated with GrimAge acceleration at baseline; and thus,
premature mortality in those with PTSD could be inferred
[17–19]. GrimAge acceleration positively correlated with estimated
neutrophil proportion, and negatively correlated with T and B
lymphocyte proportions.
Increased neutrophil and decreased
lymphocyte proportions indicate inﬂammation and immune
dysfunction, and also associate with mortality [46]. Our ﬁndings
align with previous research that reported a positive correlation
between GrimAge acceleration and CD8 + CD28 − T (CD8T cells
without CD28 surface marker) proportions, which is a biomarker of
suggesting the immune system as an
immunosenescence,
important contributor to epigenetic aging [18].

In the present study, we did not observe a signiﬁcant change in
GrimAge acceleration between baseline and treatment follow-up
at 24 weeks. Moreover, pre- to post-treatment change in GrimAge
acceleration did not associate with PTSD remission when all
treatment arms were combined or analyzed separately. Interest-
ingly, estimated neutrophil proportions increased pre- to post-
treatment in the overall sample, SERT + EMM and SERT + PE, while
proportions of T and B lymphocytes decreased in the overall
sample and SERT + PE. We also observed increase in IL-6 levels
pre- to post-treatment in the overall sample. Taken together, these
ﬁndings indicate that successful PTSD treatment may not change
the association betweenPTSD and accelerated GrimAge, at least
not within 24 weeks.
Immune dysregulation represented by
increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes, alongside with
increased IL-6 levels, may explain the lack of treatment effect on
GrimAge acceleration. Of note, it may be true that the impact of
treatment on GrimAge acceleration and even on the immune
response may require a longer period of follow-up and assess-
ment. Indeed, these markers may take a period of months post-

treatment or even years to be reﬂecting in neurobiology [47]. In a
recent clinical trial aimed to regenerate the thymus, authors
observed protective changes in immunological markers and
reversal of epigenetic aging [48]. Speciﬁcally, the rate of GrimAge
reversal relative to chronological age accelerated from −0.72 year/
year from 0–9 month to −6.48 year/year from 9–12 month,
suggesting that the rate of reversal accelerates substantially with
In addition, a 3-year follow-up
increasing treatment time [48].
study reported that longitudinal changes in GrimAge acceleration
correlated with longitudinal changes in PTSD symptom severity,
albeit the study did not prospectively assess treatment status [18].
Additional examinations in large ethnically diverse cohorts over a
longer follow-up period is warranted to fully understand the effect
of PTSD treatment on reversal of GrimAge acceleration.

This study is not without limitations. First, due to relatively low
sample size, our association studies are underpowered. Even so,
we report signiﬁcant associations of GrimAge acceleration with
PTSD at baseline. However, we are underpowered to test the
interaction effect of treatment type, which would be useful to
further characterize the observed associations. Second, since all
follow-up over time occurred in the context of treatment,
it is
unclear how these may compare to no treatment time control
group. Third, our ﬁndings are based on combat-related PTSD;
therefore, may not extrapolate to other types of PTSD.
It is
possible that GrimAge acceleration results from other factors that
increase risk for PTSD development and not reﬂective of the
impact a speciﬁc trauma that results in PTSD.

In conclusion, accelerated GrimAge was apparent in those with
PTSD, suggesting a shorter lifespan. In addition, the effect of PTSD
on GrimAge acceleration may not revert with successful treat-
ment, at least not within 24 weeks. Further prospective studies
with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up times are required
to investigate the effect of successful PTSD treatment on
accelerated GrimAge.
