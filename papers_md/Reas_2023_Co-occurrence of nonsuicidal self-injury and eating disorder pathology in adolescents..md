Abstract

Objective: Little is known about the co-occurrence of nonsuicidal self-injurious

(NSSI) behaviors and eating disorder (ED) pathology in community samples of

adolescents.

Methods: A total of 1558 Norwegian upper secondary school students (Grades

11, 12, and 13) completed the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory and a measure of ED

pathology.

Results: Adolescents (53.1% F, 46.9% M) were a mean age of 17.1 years. A higher

level of ED pathology was reported (12.1 vs. 5.3, p < .001) among adolescents who

had a history of NSSI. Significantly higher levels of ED pathology were found among

females who reported hitting themselves until bruised, head banging, severe scratch-

ing, and burning with a lighter, but not cutting, or the other forms of self-injury. Of

adolescents with a history of NSSI, 60% of females and 15% of males scored above a

cutoff for ED pathology. Of adolescents scoring above a cutoff for ED pathology,

42.5% of females and 37.1% of males had engaged in lifetime NSSI.
Discussion: Adolescents—in particular, females— with a history of NSSI reported sig-

nificantly greater ED pathology. Notably, a higher proportion of males with ED

pathology reported lifetime self-injury than vice versa, underscoring the importance

of carefully screening for the presence of self-harm among males with ED pathology.

Public Significance Statement: Over 1500 upper secondary school students with an

average age of 17 years completed an online survey assessing current ED pathology

and lifetime NSSI. Adolescents, particularly females, with a history of self-harm

reported significantly more ED pathology. Findings also indicated the need to care-

fully screen for self-harm among males with ED pathology. Parents, schools, and

health professionals should be aware that self-harm and ED pathology commonly co-

occur and warrant assessment.

the influence of other psychiatric comorbidities such as

depression or anxiety on the association between self-injury and ED

pathology was not assessed. Psychometric support exists for the

validity and reliability of the EDE-QS as a screening tool in commu-

nity settings (Prnjak et al., 2020) and rates concurred with prior

research, yet varying the stringency of the eating pathology thresh-

old may have yielded different proportions. Time frames differed for

the measurement of NSSI (lifetime) and ED pathology (past 7 days);

however, some research suggests that ED pathology remains high in

those with a lifetime history of self-harm, even among adolescents

who stop self-injuring (Ross et al., 2009). Data on gender identity

were not available, as few valid responses were obtained, and data

on sample diversity were limited to country of birth. More extreme

(less common) forms of self-injury commonly co-occurred with ED

pathology, yet due to the few participants engaging in some of these

methods, especially males, findings may not generalize and warrant

further study.

In summary, NSSI and ED pathology frequently co-occurred in a

community sample of adolescents attending upper secondary schools

in Norway. Less common/more severe methods of self-injury were
