Abstract: The study focused on the analysis of linear relations between personality, self-regulation,
coping strategies and achievement emotions. The main objective was to establish a model of
linear, empirical, associative to infer needs and proposals for intervening in emotional health in the
diﬀerent proﬁles of university students. A total of 642 undergraduate students participated in this
research. Evidence of associative relations between personality factors, self-regulation and coping
strategies was found. The neuroticism factor had a signiﬁcant negative associative relationship
with Self-Regulation both globally and in its factors; especially important was its negative relation
to decision making, and coping strategies focused in emotion. The results of Structural Equation
Model showed an acceptable model of relationships, in each emotional context. Results and practical
implications are discussed.

1. Introduction

The behavioral study of the learning process in university students has traditionally focused on
analyzing cognitive and metacognitive processes to explain optimal learning and achievement [1–3].
The prevailing psychological paradigm, however, has reoriented research interest toward the study of
emotional processes, and the analysis of personality and emotional factors has become important [4,5].
For this reason, the present study has focused on the analysis of linear relations between diﬀerent
student variables, to date insuﬃciently examined by the dominant cognitivist paradigms, namely,
the variables of personality, self-regulation, coping strategies and achievement emotions.

1.1. Emotional Health at University

The emotional health needs of students and young people seem to be on the rise. At the global level,
mental health problems will be one of the main causes of disability, morbidity and mortality within the
next two decades [6]. Personality factors can inﬂuence one’s vulnerability to emotional problems and

disorders, including anxiety, depression, aggression and personality dysfunction [7]. Recent research
has put forward two types of psychological disorders. On one side, there are internalizing disorders
(inhibition and negative aﬀect), referring to depression, generalized anxiety, phobias, post-traumatic
disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders; these can be manifest in adults, children and adolescents.
On the other side are externalizing disorders (aggression, behavior problems, lack of control over
behavior), which are associated with temperament issues. In this category we ﬁnd antisocial behavior,
related to low scores in the traits of Agreeableness (A) or Conscientiousness (C), and high scores in
Neuroticism (N). Personality traits have also been related to impulsivity, hostility and low self-esteem,
which have been associated with diﬀerent indices of aggression, delinquency and illegal behaviors [8].
Recent research has contributed plentiful evidence with respect to their positive or negative attitude at
work [9] healthful behaviors in pregnant women [10]. Elsewhere, diﬀerent personality types have been
established, in relation to the Big Five, with pathogenic components. For example, perfectionism [11]
has been deﬁned with two elements, perfectionist concerns and perfectionist eﬀorts [12], although it
has also been diﬀerentiated from excellence and eﬃciency [13].

1.2. Big Five Personality Model in Educational Context of University

The psychological construction of personality refers to the relatively stable diﬀerences in behavior
and in aﬀective dispositions that are generalized to a broad range of environmental situations [14–16].
For this reason, it is especially important in the educational context. Personality has an important role
because of its relationship to students’ goal orientations, self-esteem, well-being and cognitive level.
Personality traits are associated with positive and negative emotions because they determine students’
aﬀective and motivational experiences [17]. Pervin, Cervone, & Oliver [18] deﬁne the FFM’s ﬁve
factors: (1) Neuroticism characterizes the tendency to experience negative emotions. Typical adjectives
describing neuroticism are moody, nervous, and touchy. (2) Extraversion characterizes sensation
seeking and the quantity and the intensity of interpersonal relationships. Typical adjectives describing
extraversion are sociable, assertive, and energetic. (3) Openness to experience characterizes autonomous
thinking, a willingness to examine unfamiliar ideas, and an inclination to try new things. Typical
adjectives describing openness are inquisitive, philosophical, and innovative.
(4) Agreeableness
characterizes the quality of interpersonal interactions along a continuum from social antagonism to
compassion. Typical adjectives describing agreeableness are kind, considerate, and generous. (5) Lastly,
Conscientiousness characterizes a sense of duty, persistence, and self-disciplined goal-directed behavior.
Typical adjectives describing conscientiousness are organized, responsible, and eﬃcient.

Zeidner and Matthews [19,20] have established the importance of the Big Five personality
model in the sphere of educational psychology. Foundational to this model is its characterization
of each of its dimensions [13,21,22]: (1) the hereditary nature of personality traits; (2) validation by
consensus: multiple studies have identiﬁed the same factors; (3) cross-cultural invariance: research
has shown its existence in all cultures; (4) predictive utility: model characteristics have demonstrated
their predictive ability in achievement, in laboratory tasks, in vocational interests and on the job.
The model establishes ﬁve personality characteristics, predictive of other measures of intelligence and
of academic achievement:

(1) Openness (O). Involves intellectual perception, creativity, curiosity, originality, development
of the imagination, foresight, nonconventional thinking, and broad-ranging artistic and intellectual
interests. The relationship between openness, learning and scholastic achievement is mediated by
other factors like intelligence, the value of the academic materials, learning strategies and activities,
expectations of success, and the value of the task. A large body of empirical evidence shows that
students high in openness attain better achievement than those low in openness. Notwithstanding,
according to other research studies, this variable paradoxically becomes an academic disadvantage in
the university context.

(2) Conscientiousness (C). Refers to a set of personal attributes needed for learning and academic
achievement, such as goal-setting, seeking success, sustained eﬀort, self-control, sense of duty,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

organization, conﬁdence and eﬃciency. The exercise of self-discipline and emotional self-regulation is
particularly important in learning. A signiﬁcant body of research has evaluated and conﬁrmed the
predictive value of this personal characteristic in academic achievement [23]. Kanfer et al. [24] found
this to be the factor most closely linked to regulation of eﬀort, with signiﬁcatively association between
the total complex and the average grade. Research has also shown it to be an independent variable
with a clear causal eﬀect on achievement, while also modulated by other factors.

(3) Extraversion (E). Students with these characteristics show ease in externalizing; they are sociable,
energetic, enthusiastic, adventurous and assertive. Extraverted students prefer other activities to study,
and extraversion is found in a moderate, negative correlation to achievement [25]. Introverts have low
distraction and better study habits, more ability to stay on task and better consolidation of learning [26].
Extraversion has shown diﬀerent relations to behavior in primary education, behavior in secondary
education and behavior at university, due to the diﬀerent working environments, more cooperative in
the former and more competitive in the latter.

(4) Agreeableness (A). These students are characterized by group-orientation, altruism, compliance,
warmth, empathy. A positive relationship has been found with academic achievement, in that kindness
facilitates cooperation in learning processes [27]. By contrast, antisocial personality traits are associated
with the opposite eﬀects.

(5) Neuroticism (N). Students with high scores in neuroticism have lower cognitive achievement,
because of their anxiety, vulnerability, impulsivity, low self-esteem, low aﬀect and diﬃculties coping
with stressful situations. People that are high in neuroticism (low in emotional stability) tend to focus
their attention on their state of emotional tension and frequently experience self-referent cognitions,
which interfere with their cognitive performance [19]. Likewise, neuroticism is positively related to
low self-eﬃcacy judgments and negatively related to academic achievement. Some meta-analyses have
placed this relation between the anxiety trait and measures of academic achievement at about −0.20.
Consequently, personality traits constitute one of the non-intellectual factors that most impacts
learning and academic achievement. These factors are nonetheless mediated by multiple variables,
such as motivational variables, ability self-concept, test anxiety and achievement motivation, which may
have an increasing value in predicting achievement [28]. One recent study has analyzed how personality
factors are stable or change over time [5]; stability of scores and change in the mean level at university
were examined, both for the general domains of the Big Five (e.g., neuroticism) and the narrower facets
that underlie these domains (i.e., self-consciousness, anxiety and depression). Moreover, the study
evaluated the longitudinal associations between the Big Five domains and facets, and three aspects
of adjustment: self-esteem, academic adjustment and social adjustment at university. The results
suggested that the rank order stability of the facets was generally large in all samples, and comparable to
that observed for the trait domains. The positive aﬀect facet of Extraversion, and the Conscientiousness
facets of achievement striving and reliability, were positively associated with the three adjustment
indicators in both samples, while the Neuroticism facets of depression and self-consciousness were
negatively associated with adjustment. In summary, the ﬁndings show that it can be useful to consider
the facets of the Big Five in order to discover the nuances of how personality develops along with
adjustment at university.

1.3. Big Five Personality Model, Self-Regulation, and Coping Strategies

In an already classic study, Mathews et al. [29] showed how self-regulation is a more interactive
and adaptable psychological variable, allowing the more crystallized and static personality construct to
materialize under the demands of each situation. “We conceptualize self-regulation as a generic umbrella
term for the set of processes and behaviors supporting the pursuit of personal goals within a changing
external environment. Self-regulative constructs overlap to a large degree with constructs derived from
the transactional theory of stress, such as appraisal and coping [30]”. When they establish the relations
between personality and vulnerability to stress, they affirm: “we identify personality traits which relate to
adaptive outcome, and self-regulative processes which may mediate these associations . . . The research

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

area is that of reactions to life stressors. Traits associated with vulnerability to stress may influence
appraisal and coping processes”. Research on relations between the two constructions has held the interest
of researchers until our day, with an abundance of important contributions [31,32]. Relations between five
large personality factors and self-regulation have been hypothesized and confirmed by findings:

(1) The Conscientiousness (C) factor is considered to have a set of attributes belonging to the
domain of self-regulation (for example, goal orientation, self-control, industriousness, deliberation,
organization and punctuality); it is therefore the factor most clearly associated with diﬀerent aspects of
self-regulation [7]. A meta-analysis has shown a moderate relationship between C and other key factors
of motivation, including academic goals, expected outcomes and self-eﬃcacy; a positive relationship
was also found with focusing on cognitive tasks, high levels of self-eﬃcacy and low worry [33]. A later
study that related the C factor, self-regulated learning and achievement in 52 secondary students
concludes that this trait is the most signiﬁcant predictor of academic achievement [34].

(2) By contrast, Neuroticism (N) is associated with several maladaptive behaviors in learning
situations, including a low sense of personal control, low self-eﬃcacy as a social agent, and frequently
dysfunctional coping strategies, such as avoidance. The N factor has been related to high levels of
anxiety, and depletion of cognitive and coping abilities, resulting in reduced learning goals in the face
of task demands, and reduced self-regulated performance, processes that require considerable mental
resources [35]. Recent research on anxiety has associated deﬁcits in executive processes, including
inhibited execution, with deterioration in attentional change processes, leading to a lack of ﬂexibility
in deploying one’s attention [36]. Consequently, students high in N would have poorer self-regulation
and greater diﬃculty with coping and adapting to tasks that require activation of eﬀective strategies
for overcoming problems in learning situations;

(3) The Agreeableness (A) trait relates to social interaction with others. In addition, agreeable
students use problem-focused coping strategies related to cooperation [37]. These students can
self-regulate in social situations, as part of their competence in individual self-regulation, in cooperative
learning situations;

(4) The Extraversion (E) trait is especially related to the individual’s conﬁdence when facing settings
that have cognitive demands or are socially threatening [38]. Introversion, for its part, has been related
to vulnerability caused by stress and certain negative aspects of self-regulation, such as worry and low
self-eﬃcacy [29]. Thus, high extraversion is predictive of self-regulated learning;

(5) A limited group of research studies has established a relationship between certain elements of
Openness (O) and intellectual engagement and self-regulated learning [39]. The relationship between
the O factor and learning strategies indicates a connection to one’s engagement in learning [40].

1.4. Big Five Personality Model and Achievement Emotions

The role of personality in being responsible for emotions is important in the educational
context [41,42]. Personality traits are positively or negatively associated with educational experience.
Extraversion (E) and neuroticism (N) have been considered the two most important traits in relation to
achievement emotions.

The E students have more positive emotions and state of happiness, while introverts depend more
on the context and the speciﬁc situation. Students high in N have more negative emotional experiences,
along with anxiety and frequent anger. Biological models of personality [43] have conﬁrmed these
tendencies, demonstrating greater sensitivity to rewards and a greater state of happiness in extraverted
persons. By contrast, N people are especially sensitive to punitive stimuli that aﬀect their state of
mind [38]. Personality also aﬀects cognitive processes, with greater inﬂuence on emotional states.
The E students tend to appraise their life events in order to change them. Furthermore, they use
problem-focused coping strategies, with thoughts and actions for maintaining positive emotional states.
By contrast, N students perceive and cope with events diﬀerently, using self-critical coping strategies
that produce negative states. This involves indirect eﬀects on emotions, with interpersonal conﬂicts
and self-inﬂicted life problems [14].

1.5. Aims and Hypotheses

Based on the prior evidence, our research objectives were: (1) to establish a model of linear,
empirical, associative relations that validates the relationships between the variables (personality,
self-regulation, achievement emotions, and coping) established by previous research, (2) to infer needs
and proposals for intervening in emotional health in the diﬀerent proﬁles of university students.
Speciﬁcally, the following hypotheses were posed:

(1) The personality variables C, O, A, E will have an associative and signiﬁcant positive, predictive
relationship with respect to self-regulation (SR), while N will have an associative and negative predictive
relationship with SR.;

(2) The personality variables C, O, A, E and the SR variable will have an associative and signiﬁcant
positive, predictive relationship with respect to positive achievement emotions, and a negative
relationship to negative achievement emotions; the opposite will occur in the case of N.;

(3) The personality variables C, O, A, E will have an associative and significant positive, predictive
relationship with respect to problem-focused coping strategies, while the N variable will be positively
associated with the use of emotion-focused strategies and negatively associated with problem-focused
strategies. However, SR will be associated with and negatively predicted by the use of both emotion-focused
and problem-focused coping strategies, since SR is associated with fewer experiences of stress;

(4) Emotion-focused coping strategies will positively and signiﬁcantly predict negative
achievement emotions, while they will negatively predict positive achievement emotions.
With problem-focused coping strategies, however, the opposite will occur.

2. Method

2.1. Participants

We used a total sample of 642 undergraduate students from two universities of Spain. The sample
was composed of students enrolled in Psychology, Primary Education, and Educational Psychology
degree programs; 85.5% were women and 14.5% were men. Their ages ranged from 19 to 25 years,
with a mean age of 21.33 years; 324 national students were from one university and the rest from
another. An incidental and non-randomized design was used. The participation was anonymous
and voluntary, based on an invitation from the teachers (teaching and learning process) of this degree
programs in each University. The invitation made to the teachers and students of each university was
direct, through the Orientation unit of each University. The completion of the questionnaires in each
subject (speciﬁc teaching-learning process) was online.

2.2. Instruments

Big Five. BFQ-N [44], based in Barbaranelli et al. [45] was used. An adaptation for young university
students was used [46]. The Conﬁrmatory Analysis (CFA) have reproduced a pentafactorial structure
corresponding to the Model of the Big Five. The results have shown adequate psychometric properties
and acceptable adjustment rates. The conﬁrmatory model second order showed a good ﬁt [Chi-square
= 38.273; Degrees of freedom (20–15) = 5; p < 0.001; Normed Fit Index, NFI = 0.939; Relative Fix Index,
RFI = 0.917; Incremental Fix Index, IFI = 0.947; Tucker-Lewis Index TLI = 0.937, Comparative Fit Index,
CFI = 0.946; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, RMSEA = 0.065; HOELTER index = 2453
(p < 0.05) and, 617 (p < 0.01)]. The internal consistency of the total Scale is good (Alpha = 0.956;
Part 1 = 0.932, Part 2 = 0.832; Spearman-Brown = 0.962; Guttman = 0.932).

Self-Regulation. This variable was measured using the Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire,
SSRQ [47]. It has already been validated in Spanish samples [48], and possesses acceptable validity
and reliability values, similar to the English version. The Short SRQ is composed of four factors (goal
setting-planning, perseverance, decision making and learning from mistakes) and 17 items (all of them
with saturations greater than 0.40), with a consistent conﬁrmatory factor structure (Chi-Square = 250.83,
df = 112, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.90, GFI = 0.92, AGFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.05). Internal consistency was

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

6 of 20

acceptable for the total of questionnaire items (α = 0.86) and for the factors of goal setting-planning
(α = 0.79), decision making (α = 0.72) and learning from mistakes (α = 0.72). However, the perseverance
factor (α = 0.63) showed low internal consistency. Correlations have been studied between each
item and its factor total, among the factors, and between each factor and the complete questionnaire,
with good results for all, except for the decision-making factor, which had a lower correlation with
other factors (range: 0.41–0.58). The correlations between the original version and the complete
version, and between the original and the short versions with a Spanish sample (complete SRQ with
32 items and short SRQ with 17 items) are better for the short version (short-original: r = 0.85 and
short-complete: r = 0.94; p < 0.01) than for the complete version (complete-original: r = 0.79; p < 0.01).
Coping strategies. The Escala Estrategias de Coping (Coping Strategies Scale, EEC), was used
in its original version [49], as validated for university students [50]. It was constructed according
to theoretical-rational criteria, considering the Lazarus and Folkman questionnaire [30] and taking
coping assessment studies by Moos and Billings [51] as a basis. Although the original instrument
contained 90 items, the validation produced a ﬁrst-order structure of 64 items and a second order with
10 factors and two dimensions, both of them signiﬁcant, with adequate ﬁt values in the latter case
(Chi-square = 878.750; degrees of freedom (77–34) = 43, p < 0.001; NFI = 0.901; RFI = 0.945; IFI = 0.903,
TLI = 0.951; CFI = 0.903). Reliability measures are Cronbach alpha of 0.93 (complete scale), 0.93
(ﬁrst half) and 0.90 (second half), Spearman-Brown of 0.84 and Guttman of 0.80. This questionnaire
is composed of 11 factors and two dimensions: (1) Dimension: emotion-focused coping: F1. Fantasy
distraction; F6. Help for action; F8. Preparing for the worst; F9. Venting and emotional isolation;
F11. Resigned acceptance. (2) Dimension: problem-focused coping: F2. Help seeking and family counsel;
F5. Self-instructions; F10. Positive reappraisal and ﬁrmness; F12. Communication of feelings and social
support; F13. Seeking alternative reinforcement.

Learning Related Emotions, AEQ [52]. This instrument to include scales for nine diﬀerent emotions
(enjoyment, hope, pride, relief, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, shame, and boredom) was based on
two criteria. The AEQ addresses activity emotions (enjoyment, boredom, and anger), prospective
outcome emotions (hope, anxiety, and hopelessness), and retrospective outcome emotions (pride,
relief, and shame). In terms of valence, the instrument measures both positive and negative emotions,
and in terms of activation, it assesses both activating and deactivating emotions. As such, the AEQ
makes up the four emotion categories comprising the valence and activation dimensions: positive
activating (enjoyment, hope, pride); positive deactivating (relief); negative activating (anger, anxiety,
shame); and negative deactivating (hopelessness, boredom). In this sample, the Conﬁrmatory Factorial
Analysis (CFA) have reproduced a structure corresponding to the AEQ Model:

(1) Academic Emotions Class [53]. The results have shown adequate psychometric properties and
acceptable adjustment rates. The conﬁrmatory model showed a good ﬁt [Chi-square = 843.028; Degrees
of freedom (44–25) = 19; p < 0.001; NFI = 0.954; RFI = 0.967; IFI = 0.953; TLI = 0,958, CFI = 0.971; RMSEA
= 0.081; HOELTER=156 (p < 0.05) and, 158 (p < 0.01)]. The internal consistency of the total Scale is good
[Alpha = 0.904; Part 1 = 0.803, Part 2 = 0.853; Spearman-Brown = 0.903 and 0.853; Guttman = 0.862].
An example of items are: item 1: I get excited about goint to class; item 36: I get bored; item 75: I feel
so hopeless all my energy is depleted.

(2) Academic Emotions Study [54]. The results have shown adequate psychometric properties and
acceptable adjustment rates. The conﬁrmatory model showed a good ﬁt [Chi-square = 729,890; Degrees
of freedom (44–25) = 19; p < 0.001; NFI = 0.964; RFI = 0.957; IFI = 0,973; TLI = 0.978, CFI = 0.971;
RMSEA = 0.080; HOELTER = 165 (p < 0.05) and, 178 (p < 0.01)]. The internal consistency of the
total Scale is good (Alpha = 0.939; Part 1 = 0.880, Part 2 = 0.864; Spearman-Brown = 0.913 and 0.884;
Guttman = 0.903]). An example of items are: item 90: I get angry when I have to study; item 113:
In study sense of conﬁdence motivates me; item 144: I´m proud of myself.

(3) Academic Emotions Test [55]. The results have shown adequate psychometric properties and
acceptable adjustment rates. The conﬁrmatory model showed a good ﬁt [Chi-square = 376.658; Degrees
of freedom (44–25) = 19; p < 0.001; NFI = 0,978; RFI = 0.969; IFI = 0.983; TLI = 0.978, CFI = 0.963;

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

7 of 20

RMSEA = 0.080; HOELTER = 169 (p < 0.05) and, 188 (p < 0.01)]. The internal consistency of the
total Scale is good (Alpha = 0.913; Part 1 = 0.870, Part 2 = 0.864; Spearman-Brown = 0.824 and 0.869;
Guttman = 0.868). An example of items are: item 170: Before the exam I feel nervous and uneasy. Item
181: I enjoy taking the exam; item 224: I am very satisﬁed with myself.

2.3. Procedure

Informed consent was obtained from the study participants. The students completed the scales
voluntarily using an online platform [56] covering a total of ﬁve speciﬁc teaching-learning processes,
in diﬀerent university subjects imparted over two academic years. Presage variables was evaluated in
September–October of 2018 and of 2019, Process variables in February−March of 2018 and of 2019,
and Product variables in May–June of 2018 and of 2019. The procedure was approved by the respective
Ethics Committees of the two universities, in the context of R & D Project (2018–2021).

2.4. Data Analysis

Correlation analysis. For the hypothesis 1 to 3 we are correlated the Personality variables,
with Self-regulation, Achievement emotions and Coping strategies variables. As well as the calculation
of reliability (Pearson bivariate correlation) through IBM-SPSS Program, v.25 (IBM, New York,
NY, USA) [57].

Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis and Reliability. For the hypothesis 4, a Structural Equation Model
(SEM) analysis was conducted in this sample. Model ﬁt was assessed by ﬁrst examining the chi-square
to degrees of freedom ratio as well as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Normed Fit Index (NFI),
Incremental Fit Index (IFI), and Relative Fit Index (RFI). Ideally, these should be greater than 0.90.
We also used the Hoelter Index to determine adequacy of sample size [58]. It´s used the statistical
program AMOS Program (v.22) [59].

3. Results

3.1. Big Five and Self-Regulation

Evidence of associative relations was found in several ways. First, the personality factor
conscientiousness (C) had the most signiﬁcant association with self-regulation (SR), both globally and
in its constituent factors (especially in strength of association with perseverance (r = 0.600; p < 0.001) and
goals (r = −0.587; p < 0.001)), although it was also positively associated with the factors extraversion,
agreeableness and openness. Second, the personality factor neuroticism (N) had a signiﬁcant negative
associative relationship with self-regulation (SR), both globally and in its factors; especially important
was its negative relation to decision making (r = −0.365; p < 0.001) and learning from mistakes
(r = −0.302; p < 0.001) (see Table 1).

3.2. Big Five and Coping Strategies

A signiﬁcant positive association appeared between each of the personality factors and total
strategies used, although the weakest associative strength corresponded to conscientiousness.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

The degree of strategy use, however, varied according to the personality factor. While the neuroticism
factor was associated positively with total emotion-focused strategies and not associated with total
problem-focused strategies, the opposite was true of all remaining factors.

Speciﬁc analysis of strategy proﬁles associated with each personality factor revealed commonalities
and diﬀerences. The conscientiousness factor was positively associated with all problem-focused coping
strategies, especially with the strategies positive reappraisal and ﬁrmness (F10) and communicating
feelings and social support (F12), and negatively associated with the strategies reducing anxiety and
avoidance (F7), preparing for the worst (F8), and emotional venting and isolation (F9). The neuroticism
factor, however, had the opposite proﬁle, being positively associated with the former strategies of
emotional venting—F9’s high value [r = 0.509; p < 0.001] warrants special mention, as a health-related
risk factor—and negatively associated with the strategies of self-instructions (F5) and positive
reappraisal and ﬁrmness (F10).

In complementary fashion, the factors of extraversion, agreeableness and openness to experience
showed similar associative patterns. In all cases they were associated with certain emotion-focused
strategies, either signiﬁcantly and positively (strategy F6) or signiﬁcantly and negatively (strategy F9),
and above all, with diﬀerent problem-focused strategies, although use of these strategies was somewhat
less in the case of openness to experience (See Table 2).

3.3. Big Five and Achievement Emotions

Evidence of important relations was found in the associative relationships. On one hand,
a generalized, positive, signiﬁcant relationship is observed between all the factors of personality and
positive emotions, except in the case of neuroticism, which is inversely related, holding a negative
association with positive emotions. On the other hand, there is a signiﬁcant negative relationship
between all the personality components and negative emotions, except in the case of neuroticism,
which is positively associated with negative emotions. Moreover, the conscientiousness factor
was the factor most strongly associated with positive emotions (especially with hope and pride),
while neuroticism was the factor with the strongest signiﬁcant negative association with positive
emotions (hope and enjoyment). In complementary fashion, conscientiousness held the strongest
negative association with negative emotions (boredom, hopelessness and anger), while neuroticism

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

9 of 20

was the factor with the strongest signiﬁcant positive association with negative emotions (anxiety,
hopelessness and anger). On the other hand, extraversion, agreeableness and openness to experience
showed similar relations to those of conscientiousness, in connection with positive and negative
emotions. These relationships held constant in the three situations evaluated (class, study time and
testing), with a consistent, stable tendency. See Table 3.

In the three models constructed, the Personality (P) variable was a signiﬁcant positive predictor of
Self-regulation (SR) and its components, although diﬀerentially by component, with neuroticism being
a negative prediction factor (−0.271). It also diﬀerentially predicted Coping Strategies: negatively
predicting Emotion-Focused Strategies (EF) and positively predicting Problem-Focused Strategies (PF).
The same was true of Achievement Emotions (AE), since it positively predicted Positive Emotions
(PE) and negatively predicted Negative Emotions (NE). Moreover, the Personality (P) factor positively
predicted the components of SR.

For its part, Self-Regulation (SR)—unlike the former factor—negatively predicted the use of Coping
Strategies, both emotion-focused (EF) and problem-focused (PF), as well as negatively predicting
Negative emotions (NE), but was not a positive predictor of Positive emotions (PE).

Emotion-Focused coping strategies, particularly F9 (emotional venting and isolation) positively
predicted negative emotions (NE), but not positive emotions (PE). However, problem-focused coping
strategies, with special weight in Factor F2 (Search for help and family advice), did not predict emotions
of any type, whether positive or negative.

Finally, positive emotions (PE), with special weight in hope and enjoyment, negatively predicted

negative emotions (NE), whose greatest exponents were hopelessness and anger.

A diﬀerential eﬀect on these relations appeared in the Tests situation, where the weight of the
indices in the relationships increased, showing greater relational strength. Tables 5–7 and Figures 1–3
shows the total eﬀects of the variables included in the model.

4. Discussion

The empirical results have unevenly endorsed the fulﬁllment of our hypotheses, in the context
of relations in a Top-down model of personality, coping, and emotion [60]. (1) The ﬁrst hypothesis—
that personality variables C, O, A, E would have an associative and signiﬁcant positive, predictive
relationship with respect to self-regulation (SR), while N would have an associative but negative
predictive relationship with SR—was fulﬁlled in its entirety. All the association eﬀects as well as
structural prediction eﬀects found in the three situations have shown that every personality factor,
excepting neuroticism (low SR), is positively related to SR, albeit not all of them have the same
weight or associative strength. As prior research has shown, the Conscientiousness factor had the
strongest association with SR (high SR), following by Extraversion, Openness, and Agreeableness
(medium SR) [5,34,61].

(2) The second hypothesis—that personality variables C, O, A, E, and SR, would have an associative
and signiﬁcant positive, predictive relationship with respect to positive achievement emotions,
and a negative relationship to negative achievement emotions; while the opposite would occur in the
case of N—was also fulﬁlled, though partially. While relationships with the P construct fulﬁlled the
prediction, SR fulﬁlled only the negative prediction of negative emotions, but not the expected positive
prediction of positive emotions. The fact that the SR construct depends linearly on P is probably the
reason that its prediction strength is minimized. In any case, the diﬀerential eﬀect of the P factors on
experiencing positive emotions in the three situations is undeniable, as well as the dampening eﬀect of
SR in inhibiting positive emotions. This seems to endorse that the SR construct has a buﬀering eﬀect on
negative emotionality, while having less eﬀect in promoting positive emotionality [62]. Consequently,
these aspects should be further investigated in the future.

(3) The third hypothesis projected that personality variables C, O, A, E would have an associative
and signiﬁcant positive, predictive relationship with respect to problem-focused coping strategies,
and negative with emotion-focused strategies, while the N variable would be positively associated
with the use of emotion-focused strategies and negatively with problem-focused strategies. At the
same time, SR would be associated with and negatively predict the use of both emotion-focused
and problem-focused coping strategies, since SR is associated with fewer experiences of stress [63].
Both hypotheses were fulﬁlled. In the ﬁrst case, the results conﬁrm prior evidence, since personality
components were associated with relatively stable coping strategies [64–66]. The more harmful
emotion-focused strategies were predicted by the N factor, characterized by low self-regulation,
while the C factor was usually associated with problem-focused strategies, typical of high self-regulation,
and strategies associated with factors E, O, and A were mixed, typical of medium SR [67–69].
These tendencies, however, ought to be empirically reviewed, in more precise fashion, before drawing
any deﬁnite conclusion.

(4) Finally, the fourth hypothesis aﬃrmed that emotion-focused coping strategies would
positively and signiﬁcantly predict negative achievement emotions, while negatively predicting
positive achievement emotions; the opposite would occur with problem-focused coping strategies.
This hypothesis was only partially fulﬁlled. In eﬀect, emotion-focused strategies were predictive of
negative emotions (hopelessness, anger, anxiety, etc.), but they did not negatively predict positive
emotions (enjoyment, hope, pride). Moreover, problem-focused strategies failed to predict any type of
emotion. This fact is consistent with the result referring to SR, presented above. SR and problem-focused
coping strategies in and of themselves do not predict positive emotionality [70]. These aspects should
also be investigated in more depth, in diﬀerential fashion, for each BF component and proﬁle.

Limitations

The present study also has its limitations, which should be addressed in future research. On one
hand, the weight of each personality factor in the global weight of the construct has been analyzed,
but we have not considered possible combinations or personality typologies using the Big Five
model [71]. Nor have we related the possible diﬀerential proﬁles from the model with their associated

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3602

16 of 20

degree of SR. In other words, could the personality factors be categorized according to their associated
degree of SR, in a graded sequence? This possibility should be analyzed in greater depth. It is also
vital to make further comparison of clinical and non-clinical samples, in order to establish diﬀerences
in psychological processes between these two sample types (normalized and psychopathological).
Another limitation is that sample was composed of students enrolled in Psychology, Primary Education,
and Educational Psychology degree programs; and 85.5% were women and 14.5% were men. Therefore,
it would be necessary for future studies to examine if the results are similar in other university studies,
as well as in samples with more male participants. Finally, an important limitation is the correlational
design used.
Indeed, the relationships they observed may reﬂect other confounding variables.
Experimental and longitudinal evidence is needed to make such mechanistic and directional claims.

5. Practical Implications

5.1. Academic Implications

Research on the role of personality in education can oﬀer great beneﬁts if we incorporate the
variables of personality, motivation and aﬀective processes into existing theories [72]. More studies are
needed that show the relations between these variables and adaptive behaviors. Future research also
needs to show the existence of nonlinear relations between achievement, motivation and mental health.
In short, research on personality can contribute elements of interest to educational psychology if it
addresses students’ emotional processes [73] and integrates these into the commonly used cognitive
and metacognitive models [74].

5.2. Professional Implications

From a practical point of view, personality assessment can be a critical help to diﬀerent types
of university students. For example, students high in N and anxiety and low in self-esteem will
need teacher support, receiving positive feedback after successful outcomes, to help them improve
their self-esteem; they will also need programs to help with anxiety and stress management [75].
Students high in E may need help dealing with distractions and focusing more on their learning goals.
Students low in C may need help to maintain their interest and application to learning, in other words,
an external regulatory context that promotes their self-regulation [76–78]. Students high in O will need
to be involved in routine practices and exercises. Students high in A will need to learn to be more
assertive with others in the classroom. Finally, teachers can organize activities more ﬂexibly, taking into
account students’ aﬀect and performance needs, including goals, learning strategies, and plans.

6. Conclusions

As has already been suggested in prior research, self-regulation (as a meta-behavioral construct)
may be considered a behavioral materialization of personality factors [21,79]. Something similar
also occurs with coping strategies, and hence, with achievement emotions, whether positive or
negative. Moreover, this behavior tends to be maintained with a similar pattern in all three
situations of the university academic context that we have analyzed here. All this points to the
need to place the personality construct in its rightful place in psychoeducational assessment and
intervention [80,81] during university academic processes, notwithstanding the consideration that
the person x context interaction is an essential aspect of understanding the variability in how students
experience achievement emotions, as recent research has shown [76,77,82,83] and as the authors of the
Control-Value Theory have themselves reported [84–88].
