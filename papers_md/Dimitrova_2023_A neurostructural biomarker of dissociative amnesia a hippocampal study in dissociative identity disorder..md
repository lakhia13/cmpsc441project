Abstract

Background. Little is known about the neural correlates of dissociative amnesia, a transdiag-
nostic symptom mostly present in the dissociative disorders and core characteristic of dis-
sociative identity disorder (DID). Given the vital role of the hippocampus in memory, a
prime candidate for investigation is whether total and/or subfield hippocampal volume can
serve as biological markers of dissociative amnesia.
Methods. A total of 75 women, 32 with DID and 43 matched healthy controls (HC), under-
went structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using Freesurfer (version 6.0), volumes
were extracted for bilateral global hippocampus, cornu ammonis (CA) 1–4, the granule cell
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), fimbria, hippocampal−amygdaloid tran-
sition area (HATA), parasubiculum, presubiculum and subiculum. Analyses of covariance
showed volumetric differences between DID and HC. Partial correlations exhibited relation-
ships between the three factors of the dissociative experience scale scores (dissociative
amnesia, absorption, depersonalisation/derealisation) and traumatisation measures with hip-
pocampal global and subfield volumes.
Results. Hippocampal volumes were found to be smaller in DID as compared with HC in
bilateral global hippocampus and bilateral CA1, right CA4, right GC-ML-DG, and left presu-
biculum. Dissociative amnesia was the only dissociative symptom that correlated uniquely and
significantly with reduced bilateral hippocampal CA1 subfield volumes. Regarding traumatisa-
tion, only emotional neglect correlated negatively with bilateral global hippocampus, bilateral
CA1, CA4 and GC-ML-DG, and right CA3.
Conclusion. We propose decreased CA1 volume as a biomarker for dissociative amnesia. We
also propose that traumatisation, specifically emotional neglect, is interlinked with dissociative
amnesia in having a detrimental effect on hippocampal volume.

Introduction

Dissociative amnesia is a dissociative symptom common in the dissociative disorders and is
characterised by recurrent gaps in recalling everyday events and/or of important personal
(trauma-related) information, distinct from ordinary forgetting. The most severe of the dis-
sociative disorders is dissociative identity disorder (DID). DID is a debilitating psychiatric con-
dition and is related to, among others, alternating states of consciousness and distinct
personality states with changing access
information (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although dissociative amnesia is a core symptom of DID
and of other dissociative disorders little is known about its neurobiological foundations.

to autobiographical

A few studies have found a negative correlation between dissociative symptoms and hippo-
campal volume. Ehling, Nijenhuis, and Krikke (2008) found bilateral global hippocampal vol-
ume reductions in individuals with DID, which negatively correlated with dissociative
symptoms. Similarly, Chalavi et al. (2015b) found evidence for hippocampal global and sub-
field volume reductions in relation to dissociative symptoms and/or traumatisation. Left hip-
pocampal volume reduction has further been associated with dissociative symptoms in
individuals who suffered childhood sexual abuse as compared with healthy controls (HC)

(Stein, Koverola, Hanna, Torchia, & McClarty, 1997) indicating
that early traumatisation is a potential mediator of dissociative
symptoms. Adverse childhood experiences further increase in
the likelihood of childhood autobiographical memory deficits
(Brown et al., 2007). Amnesia has also been linked to the presence
of psychological stress and/or traumatisation (Markowitsch &
Staniloiu, 2012; Staniloiu & Markowitsch, 2012). On the other
hand, there is also information to suggest absence of hippocampal
volume reductions in individuals with a dissociative disorder
(Weniger, Lange, Sachsse, & Irle, 2008) and a study by Mutluer
et al. (2018) did not show significant correlations between hippo-
campal volume and dissociative symptoms in a group of PTSD
patients. Thus, although most studies reported decreased hippo-
campal volume, evidence for a negative correlation between hip-
pocampal volume and dissociative symptoms
fully
consistent. Variations of findings across these studies may be dri-
ven by the low numbers of participants and/or inconsistent meas-
urement of the dissociative symptoms. Therefore, there is a need
for further research into the role of the hippocampus in dissocia-
tive amnesia in DID.

is not

The hippocampus plays an integral role in consolidating long-
term memories and in learning (Preston & Eichenbaum, 2014).
As such, it is relevant to consider the hippocampus in relation
to dissociative amnesia. The hippocampus consists of different
anatomical subfields, namely the cornu ammonis 1, 2, 3 and 4
(CA1–4), the parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum and the
hippocampal tail, as well as other regions, namely the granule
cell molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), the hippo-
campal–amygdaloid transition area (HATA), the fimbria, the hip-
pocampal fissure and the molecular layer of the hippocampus
(Amaral & Lavenex, 2006). Research has shown that excessive
stress from traumatic experiences, particularly childhood trau-
matic experiences, contributes to the dysregulation of the hypo-
thalamic pituitary adrenal axis (Kuhlman, Vargas, Geiss, &
Lopez-Duran, 2017; Shea, Walsh, MacMillan, & Steiner, 2004),
which may damage hippocampal
function and structure
(Bidzan, 2017; Teicher, Anderson, & Polcari, 2012; Woon,
Sood, & Hedges, 2010). Certain hippocampal regions have been
identified as more important in memory and amnesia including
the CA1 (Bartsch, Döhring, Rohr, Jansen, & Deuschl, 2011;
Spiegel et al., 2017). CA1 is a subfield known to be critically
involved in the process of memory consolidation and could be
2017).
amnesia
involved in dissociative
Vulnerability and susceptibility of the CA1 to the detrimental
effects of stress could therefore lead to dissociative amnesia. To
date, only one study has investigated the global volume of the
hippocampus and of its composite smaller regions in relation to
dissociative symptoms in DID participants and showed a negative
correlation between total dissociation scores and hippocampal
regions (Chalavi et al., 2015b).

Dissociative symptomatology is of a complex nature. Many dif-
ferent theoretical and definitional frameworks have endeavoured
to conceptualise it (Dell & O’Neil, 2009; Dorahy et al., 2014;
Holmes et al., 2005; Nijenhuis, 2015; Reinders & Veltman,
2020; Şar, Dorahy, & Krüger, 2017). Most research into patho-
logical dissociation has used total scores from the dissociative
experience scale (DES) (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986) to assess psy-
choform dissociative symptoms in relation to, for example, cogni-
tive functioning or neurobiology (Roydeva & Reinders, 2021).
However, the DES is considered to have a three-factor structure,
the factors being dissociative amnesia, absorption and deperson-
alisation/derealisation. Increasingly evidence shows that amnesia,

absorption and depersonalisation/derealisation are
separate
unique dissociative components that need to be examined as sep-
arate entities in research (Lyssenko et al., 2018; Soffer-Dudek,
Lassri, Soffer-Dudek, & Shahar, 2015). For instance, unlike
amnesia and depersonalisation/derealisation, absorption has
been found to be normally distributed among healthy populations
(Soffer-Dudek et al., 2015) and it is suggested that absorption
involves an alternation of consciousness that is not dissociative
(Nijenhuis, Van der Hart, & Steele, 2002b). Therefore, this raises
concerns as to whether absorption could diminish statistical
effects when pathological dissociation is examined as a cumulative
overall phenomenon. Consequently, it is important to assess indi-
vidually the core diagnostic features of DID and their neural cor-
relates as well as to investigate the three dissociative constructs in
relation to hippocampal morphology, which could provide a com-
structural
prehensive understanding of
alterations.

The aims of the current study are to extend previous research
by Chalavi et al. (2015b) by increasing the sample size and to
investigate the distinct contributions of the three separate DES
factors, that is amnesia, absorption and depersonalisation/dereal-
isation, to decreases in hippocampal global and subfield volumes
in a large sample of individuals with DID. In addition, due to the
inter-linked nature of trauma and dissociation, we aim to investi-
gate the global volume of the hippocampus and of its composite
smaller regions in relation to self-report measures of traumatisa-
tion related to emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse,
sexual abuse and sexual harassment. We hypothesise that hippo-
campal global and subfield volumes will be smaller in individuals
with DID as compared to HC and that within the DID group the
global and subfield hippocampal volumes will negatively correlate
with higher severity of dissociative amnesia as well as with greater
traumatisation.

Methods

Design and participants

Data of a total of 75 women (only female participants with DID
volunteered) were included in the current study which follows a
between-group research design: 32 female volunteers with DID
and 43 HC matched for age, gender, years of education and eth-
nicity. Data were collected in the Netherlands in the University
Medical Centre in Groningen (UMCG) and the Amsterdam
Medical Centre (AMC), and in Switzerland at the University
Hospital in Zurich. Participant information has been detailed pre-
viously (Chalavi et al., 2015a, 2015b; Reinders et al., 2018, 2019;
Schlumpf et al., 2013, 2014). The DID participants were recruited
from psychiatric departments, outpatient psychotherapists and
psychiatrists. Initial diagnosis fulfilled DSM-IV criteria and was
confirmed by trained clinicians with the Structural Clinical
(SCID-D)
Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders
(Steinberg, 1993). Twenty-nine volunteers with DID had a
co-morbid diagnosis of PTSD and three had PTSD in remission.
Additional co-morbidity was confirmed by participants and their
personal therapists based on DSM-IV classification (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994), see for details Reinders et al.
(2018, 2019) and online Supplementary Table S1. The HC
group was recruited through local newspaper advertisements.
Exclusion criteria for all participants included age outside the
range of 18–65, pregnancy, systemic or neurological illness, claus-
implants in the body and substance abuse.

Additional exclusion criteria for the HC group included the pres-
ence of dissociative symptoms and a history of trauma, past or
current psychiatric disorders and medication use (see for details
Chalavi et al. 2015a, 2015b; Reinders et al. 2018; Schlumpf et al.
2013, 2014). HC were required to score below 25 on the DES.
The DES is a 28-item self-report screening tool for dissociative
disorders which is often used in clinical research and as a basis
for guiding diagnosis in the clinical
interview (Carlson &
Putnam, 1993). The DES scale has received meta-analytic valid-
ation (Van Ijzendoorn & Schuengel, 1996). The HC were also
required to have a score below and 29 on the Somatoform
Dissociation Questionnaire (Nijenhuis, Spinhoven, Van Dyck,
Van der Hart, & Vanderlinden, 1996). Traumatic experiences
were measured with the traumatic experience checklist (TEC), a
self-report measure
events
(Nijenhuis, Van der Hart, & Kruger, 2002a). TEC total scores
were previously calculated for each category of abuse, namely
emotional neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse
and sexual harassment (Reinders et al., 2018). As expected and
previously reported (Reinders et al., 2018, 2019) dissociative
symptoms and traumatic experiences were significantly higher
in the DID group (all data obtained in the predominant person-
ality state) than in the HC group (all p-values <0.001, see for
details online Supplementary Table S1).

Ethical considerations

All participants gave informed written consent in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and as dictated by ethical require-
ments of the Medical Ethical Committees of UMCG (Reference
number: METC2008.211) and the AMC (Reference number:
MEC09/155), and by the cantonal ethical commission of Zurich
(Kantonale Ethikkommission Zürich; reference number: E-13/
2008). All participants were given the right to withdraw and
were fully debriefed in line with the ethical requirements of the
Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2013).

Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected using 3-T
Philips whole-body scanners (Philips Medical Systems, Best,
Netherlands) from centres in the Netherlands (The AMC, and
in Zurich,
the UMCG) and Switzerland (University Hospital
UHZ). Ratios of DID to HC participants were approximately
equal across the centres (10 DID participants and 17 HC included
from the UMCG, 7 DID participants and 11 HC from the AMC,
and 15 DID participants and 15 HC from Zurich). The number
within each group did not differ across centres (χ2 = 1.01, p =
0.603). An optimised T1-weighted anatomical MRI protocol
with the following settings was utilised which has been demon-
strated to have high reproducibility within and between centres
(Chalavi, Simmons, Dijkstra, Barker, & Reinders, 2012; 3D

Fischl et al., 2002), volumetric measures for the global hippocam-
pus, CA1, CA3, CA4, fimbria, HATA, subiculum, GC-DG, para-
subiculum and presubiculum, for each hemisphere (Fig. 1), in
addition to total intercranial volume (TIV), were extracted. For
one participant from the HC group FreeSurfer was not able to
complete the hippocampal segmentation, and therefore this par-
ticipant was excluded from subsequent statistical analyses.

Dissociative amnesia

Dissociative amnesia was measured as part of the DES. In add-
ition to total dissociation the three core dissociative symptoms,
namely absorption, amnesia and depersonalisation/derealisation
were calculated.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed using SPSS (v25) (IBM Corp., 2017).
To confirm the findings of Chalavi et al. (2015b) ‘that hippocam-
pal global and subfield volumes are smaller in individuals with
DID compared to a control group’, in the extended sample we
performed a similar group comparison between DID and HC par-
ticipants. If group differences are found between the two groups
further correlation analyses are warranted. Then independent
samples t tests were used to test differences between the groups
in age, education and total dissociation, absorption, amnesia
and depersonalisation/derealisation. Mann–Whitney U tests
were applied to analyse group differences in traumatisation mea-
sures because of skewness in the data. Analyses were then con-
ducted within the DID group only to assess dissociation and
traumatisation measures and maintain the validity of the results
to pathological samples.

Hippocampal volumes

examined with analyses of

Between-group differences in hippocampal volumes for each
hemisphere were
covariance
(ANCOVA). Hippocampal volumes acted as the dependant vari-
able, group and centre as fixed categorical effects, and age and
estimated TIV as continuous covariates. Controlling for TIV
allows the examination of volumetric changes with respect to
maximal adult brain size (O’Brien et al., 2012). Significant
group differences were assessed by comparing the estimated mar-
ginal means of the main effects in post-hoc with the Bonferroni
confidence interval adjustment. Partial eta squared measures of
effect size were reported for main effects, interpreted as small
(0.01), medium (0.06) or large (0.14) (Cohen, 1988). Cohen’s d
was calculated for the post-hoc pairwise comparisons by dividing
the adjusted mean difference by the square root of the mean
squared (MS) error from analysis of variance (Howell, 2010),
and were interpreted using Cohen (1988) benchmark of small
(0.2), medium (0.5) and large (0.8).

2000; Fischl, Liu, & Dale, 2001; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale, 1999a;

Hippocampal volume in relation to dissociation and traumatisa-
tion was evaluated within the DID group only to preserve validity.
Including the HC group would lead to spurious results because
per exclusion criteria the HC are free from dissociation symptoms

(see for discussion Chalavi et al. 2015a, 2015b; Dimitrova et al.
2020; Preacher, Rucker, MacCallum, & Nicewander, 2005).
Partial correlations were conducted between volumetric measures
and dissociation total and subscale measures, controlling for age
and TIV. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test detected no deviations
from normality in the dissociation measures within the DID
group. Within the DID group, the associations of total TEC scores
and subscale scores of abuse categories with hippocampal
volumes for each hemisphere were explored with partial correla-
tions, controlling for age and TIV. Due to the ordinal nature of
the TEC data and lack of normality as assessed by the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (all p < 0.05), Spearman’s partial corre-
lations were conducted using a script in the SPSS syntax editor.
Results were controlled for co-morbidity by repeating the par-
tial correlations and adding the co-morbid diagnosis as a third
variable to the analyses, in a similar manner as Chalavi et al.
(2015a). This meant that the correlations between dissociation
measures and hippocampal volumes were controlled for age,
TIV and co-morbidity. Additionally, we created a ‘total’ covariate
variable, data coded with 1 if any co-morbidity was present, and a
0 if none was present. PTSD was not included as a co-morbidity
because all individuals with DID also had a diagnosis of PTSD (in
remission). Adding PTSD as a covariate would therefore invali-
date the analyses.

Discussion

The current study is the first to investigate decreased hippocampal
global and subfield volumes in relation to dissociative amnesia,
absorption and depersonalisation/derealisation symptoms in the
largest cohort of individuals with DID to date. Our most import-
ant finding is that in the DID group only dissociative amnesia and
total dissociation symptom scores and not absorption or deper-
sonalisation/derealisation correlated significantly and negatively
with hippocampal volume. Our second most important finding
is that these negative correlations were only found for the CA1
hippocampal subfield.

We propose that the volume of CA1 can serve as a biomarker for
dissociative amnesia because only dissociative amnesia and not
absorption or depersonalisation/derealisation correlated with smal-
ler CA1 hippocampal subfield volume in individuals with DID.
Research has previously shown that the total DES score correlates
negatively with hippocampal volume in patients with DID and
PTSD (Chalavi et al., 2015b; Ehling et al., 2008; Mutluer et al.,
2018; Stein et al., 1997), but our results indicate that this effect
might be driven by dissociative amnesia. Further to this, the associ-
ation of CA1 with dissociative amnesia remained significant even
after controlling for co-morbidity. This indicates that CA1 volume
reduction is primarily driven by dissociative amnesia in DID, not
other disorders, and presents a specific dissociative disorder effect.
Our novel findings can be linked to amnesia and memory
because damage to hippocampal subfield CA1 has been shown
to lead to memory impairments (Bartsch et al., 2015, 2011;
Ocampo, Squire, & Clark, 2017). Furthermore, CA1 has been
found to be of particular importance for autobiographical mem-
ories (Bartsch et al., 2011), which constitute building blocks of
a person’s identity. Moreover, CA1 impairments have been linked
to damage in extinction learning (the gradual decrease in response

to a conditioned stimulus) in individuals presenting trauma,
implicating accurate context evaluation of non-threatening set-
tings (Chen et al., 2018). Consequently, damage to or lack of mat-
uration of CA1 regions may be related to memory disturbances.
The CA1 projects to the medial prefrontal cortex and the orbito-
frontal frontal cortex (Zhong, Yukie, & Rockland, 2006) and it
could be speculated that damage to the CA1 may contribute to
dissociation mechanisms and the formation of dissociative per-
sonality states (Forrest, 2001).

We also found a link between the severity of childhood trau-
matisation, specifically emotional neglect and reductions in hip-
pocampal volume including CA1. In support of our finding
research has demonstrated an association between emotional neg-
lect and dissociation severity accentuating the relationship
between traumatisation, dissociation and hippocampal volume
reductions (Şar, 2011; Şar, Akyüz, & Doğan, 2007; Schalinski
et al., 2016; Schimmenti, 2016). CA1 impairment in relation to
childhood traumatisation can possibly lead to fragmentation of
the mind and a scattered sense of self (Brown et al., 2007).
Interestingly, Huntjens, Dorahy, and van Wees-Cieraad (2013)
present lack of self-referential processing as a possible mechanism
to explain the link between dissociation and fragmentation of the
mind. Furthermore, research has shown memory source misattri-
bution as a specific cognitive characteristic of dissociation, par-
ticularly for dissociative amnesia (Chiu et al., 2016, 2019). The
association between dissociative symptoms and misattributing
self-generated representations as an external doing suggests an
amnestic barrier regarding access to self-relevant information.
Chiu et al. (2016) state that this misattribution error could not
be fully explained by intellectual function and general psycho-
pathology, which suggests that this cognitive blockage of informa-
tion is a specific cognitive characteristic of dissociation. They also

810

Lora I. Dimitrova et al.

found that source misattribution of self-generated representations
correlated significantly with DES assessed dissociative amnesia
(Chiu et al., 2016). Furthermore, it has been found that there is
a link between dissociation proneness and reduced self-reference
ability, particularly for individuals with high dissociation prone-
ness and high childhood relational trauma (Chiu et al., 2019).
The inability to establish a self-referential perspective during trau-
matisation prevents processing the experience as own and self-
relevant and inhibits assimilating those memories into the auto-
biographical memory base (Huntjens et al., 2013). This supports
the altered sense of individuality prevalent in DID and the amnes-
tic blockage of information as evident with dissociative amnesia.
Furthermore, there are consistent reports on associations between
abuse and dissociation severity across a range of clinical presenta-
tions including PTSD, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and
psychosis (Schalinski & Teicher, 2015; Schalinski et al., 2016). A
multitude of factors interplay with dissociation severity including
the relationship to the perpetrator (Plattner et al., 2003), attach-
ment style (Kong, Kang, Oh, & Kim, 2018) and genetics
(Dackis, Rogosch, Oshri, & Cicchetti, 2012; Savitz et al., 2008;
Wolf et al., 2014).

Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to show that
decreased hippocampal subfield volume is related to dissociative
amnesia and is interlinked with emotional neglect. These findings
need to be confirmed in future research because emotional neglect
is the only nonviolent traumatisation measure, while past research
has emphasised the importance of physical and sexual abuse in dis-
sociative disorders (Mutluer et al., 2018; Stein et al., 1997; Twaite &
Rodriguez-Srednicki, 2004). For instance, there are reports correlat-
ing dissociative symptoms with various adverse events, including
emotional neglect by family of origin,
in addition to research
suggesting emotional neglect (e.g. parental unavailability) during
childhood as a major predictor for developing a dissociative dis-
order (Dutra, Bureau, Holmes, Lyubchik, & Lyons-Ruth, 2009;
Lyons-Ruth, Dutra, Schuder, & Bianchi, 2006; Nijenhuis,
Spinhoven, Van Dyck, Van der Hart, & Vanderlinden, 1998;
Ogawa, Sroufe, Weinfield, Carlson, & Egeland, 1997).

implications

in the clinical

Our finding of the importance of CA1 in dissociative amnesia
is of interest as it provides insight into further understanding bio-
markers of dissociative disorders. Furthermore, by showing the
variation of significance of the three subscales of the DES, that
is amnesia, absorption and depersonalisation/derealisation, we
emphasise with others (Lyssenko et al., 2018; Soffer-Dudek
et al., 2015) the importance of examining the subscales as separate
entities and not as a total cumulative unit. By identifying a region
of interest that is linked to dissociative amnesia we provide evi-
dence of
realm (Reinders &
Veltman, 2020). Our study has possible clinical relevance because
there is some evidence to suggest hippocampal volume increase/
recovery after medication (Vermetten, Vythilingam, Southwick,
Charney, & Bremner, 2003) and with phase-oriented psychother-
apy (Ehling et al., 2008), but not with brief eclectic psychotherapy
(Lindauer et al., 2005). However, to date, there is little evidence
regarding treatment outcomes for DID and future research
could investigate the role of CA1 hippocampal subfield volume
during treatment of and recovery from dissociative disorders.
We also recommend that future studies provide more precise
results in terms of hippocampal head, body and tail and their
respective connectivity in a larger sample of DID participants.
This is of interest because the anterior hippocampus has been
associated with trauma-related memories and intrinsic functional
connectivity with the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, medial

prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, midline thalamus
and periventricular hypothalamus (Abdallah et al., 2017; Blessing,
Beissner, Schumann, Brünner, & Bär, 2016). Future studies could
also formulate hypotheses about and include a wider range of mea-
sures of dissociative symptomatology such as positive and negative
dissociative symptoms (Spiegel et al., 2013), detachment and com-
partmentalisation (Cardeña & Carlson, 2011) and trait and state
dissociation (Roydeva & Reinders, 2021).

Our study presents the following limitations. Firstly, our study
only included participants with DID and future research should
assess dissociative amnesia across other psychiatric disorders to
confirm our proposal of CA1 as a biomarker for dissociative
amnesia. Furthermore, smaller hippocampal volume has been
found in various mental disorders with and without dissociative
symptoms (Belli, 2014; Chalavi et al., 2015b; Luoni, Agosti,
Crugnola, Rossi, & Termine, 2018; Roydeva & Reinders, 2021;
van Huijstee & Vermetten, 2017). Due to the polysymptomatic
presentation of symptoms in DID it is important that future
research controls for comorbidity findings. Secondly, our study
is limited by the exclusively female sample. Therefore our results
may not extend to men with DID. Nevertheless, by focusing on
women exclusively, our study design is optimised to minimise
the neuroanatomical and clinical heterogeneity that could have
been introduced by analysing data across gender categories
(Reinders et al., 2018). It can be argued that seeing a correlation
of hippocampal volume and (self-report) severity of amnesia in
the DID group is evidence that this neural substrate is relevant
to the severity of amnesia in DID, rather than the presence of dis-
sociative amnesia because amnesia is a defining symptom of DID
and is therefore expected to be present in all participating indivi-
duals with DID. Although this is indeed the case and symptom
scores of absorption and depersonalisation/derealisation are 4–
5% higher
than for dissociative amnesia, our proposal of
decreased CA1 volume as a biomarker for dissociative amnesia
is also based on the absence of a correlation between hippocampal
(sub-)volumes and symptoms of absorption and depersonalisa-
tion/derealisation instead of only the presence of dissociative
amnesia. Therefore, we propose that our findings are of interest
for neurobiological biomarker research.

In conclusion, our study proposes decreased CA1 volume as a
biomarker for dissociative amnesia. We also propose that emo-
tional neglect is interlinked with dissociative amnesia in having
a detrimental effect on hippocampal subfield volume.
