Abstract: The transition to parenthood has been identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant relationship stressor.
Many couples report declines in relationship satisfaction and diﬃculty with individual stress
and co-parenting—problems that have been associated with both child temperament as well as
emotional and behavioral problems. Several parenting and relationship interventions have been
developed to buﬀer against these diﬃculties. In the current study, we report secondary analyses of a
randomized controlled trial of brief (6-h) interventions that focused on improving either relationship
satisfaction or co-parenting, delivered during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. In this
trial, 90 opposite-sex couples (180 participants), who were pregnant with their ﬁrst child, and were
assessed as being at high risk for declines in relationship satisfaction, were randomized to receive
either (1) a relationship intervention, (2) a co-parenting intervention, or (3) an information control.
At 12 months postpartum, couples who received either the relationship or co-parenting intervention
rated their infants as having lower negative emotionality and as having fewer externalizing symptoms
compared to the information-only control. Lower externalizing symptoms at 12 months were, in turn,
associated with reduced externalizing symptoms at 24 months postpartum. Whereas, lower ratings
of child negative emotionality at 12 months were associated with reduced internalizing symptoms at
24 months postpartum. These results indicate that brief relationship or co-parenting interventions
delivered during the transition to parenthood have secondary beneﬁts for child mental health.

1. Introduction

A large body of research has shown that children who grow up exposed to marital conﬂict
and low parental relationship satisfaction are at higher risk for developing internalizing and
externalizing symptoms [1]. Parents’ collaborative eﬀorts in fulﬁlling child-rearing responsibilities
(i.e., co-parenting) [2] are also associated with child adjustment and attachment to parents above and
beyond the quality of the marital relationship [3]. Moreover, co-parenting is thought to at least partially
account for the link between inter-parental relationship and child outcomes [2,4,5].

The transition to parenthood has been identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant relationship stressor that is
associated with declines in relationship satisfaction [6,7]. A number of individual, relationship,
and infant characteristics have been shown to be associated with greater relationship declines
postpartum [8]. Therefore, without adequate supports, many couples experience relationship decline,
exposing their infants to less favorable contexts for optimal emotional and behavioral development
and placing them at higher risk for later mental health problems.

1.1. Parental Interventions and Child Outcomes

Harold and Sellers (2018) make the case that, while there has been “compelling scientiﬁc
evidence” for decades linking parental conﬂict to child outcomes, the development and dissemination
Interventions designed to improve the quality of
of relevant treatments has lagged behind [1].
parental relationships have varied in their long-term impact on child functioning; some studies
show no long-term beneﬁts [9,10] while others suggest long-term reductions in child behavioral
problems [11–13]. Programs focusing on co-parenting/parenting have shown more consistent positive
short- and long-term impacts on child adjustment [14–19], including some evidence of positive eﬀects
on infant temperament related to regulatory ability and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in
children [17,20–22].

1.2. Developmental Origins of Child Emotional and Behavioural Problems

The foundations of child development begin in-utero and throughout the ﬁrst years of life. One of
the earliest indicators of later child mental health is infant temperament, which refers to individual
diﬀerences in emotional reactivity and regulation [23]. Negative emotionality in particular captures
an aspect of temperament that includes the expression of negative emotions, including fear, anger,
irritability, sadness, and distress to limitations or discomfort [24]. Negative emotionality has strong links
to the later emergence of adult neuroticism and is predictive of later mental health outcomes [25–27].
Although there is a clear biological basis to temperament [25], changes in infant temperament are
inﬂuenced not only by biological maturation but also through environmental inputs. For example,
increases in infant fear over the ﬁrst year are accelerated among infants whose mothers have higher
levels of depressive symptoms [28]. Maternal anxiety and maternal negative emotionality have also
been shown to predict increases in infant negativity over time [29]. Conversely, responsive and
sensitive parenting is associated with decreases in infants’ high reactivity [30]. Drawing together
ﬁndings from the animal and human literature, even in situations where infants may be biologically
primed to express higher levels of negative emotionality placing them at risk for later mental health
problems—this tendency can be buﬀered through better family functioning, higher parental sensitivity,
more positive parenting, and lower levels of neglect [1,31].

1.3. Relationship Intervention in the Transition to Parenthood

Given that in-utero and early childhood represent critical periods of development, as well as a
period when parents are at high risk for relationship decline, it makes sense that relationship-focused
interventions delivered during this time frame might yield secondary beneﬁts for child mental health.
Fortunately, programs have been developed and shown to support parent relationship quality and
co-parenting behaviors in the perinatal period and to prevent declines in at-risk couples [8,32]. As one
example, one study randomized couples to one of three conditions: a brief co-parenting-focused
intervention, a brief relationship-focused intervention, or an information-only control group [33].
Results showed that, compared to the control group, both active interventions reduced declines in
relationship satisfaction over the ﬁrst two years of a child’s life in women and in high-risk men.
Both groups, compared to the control, also produced improvements in women’s perceptions of
parenting alliance and lower maternal stress; however, the potential secondary beneﬁts on infant/child
outcomes were not investigated.

1.4. The Present Study

The primary aims of this secondary data analysis are to determine the eﬀect of the interventions
described above on (1) child negative emotionality and (2) internalizing and externalizing problems.
Behavioral expressions of negativity increase during an infant’s ﬁrst 12 months of life as their behavioral
repertoire increases [34–37] and their cognitive and neurobiological maturation allow them to anticipate
and act upon the environment [36]. For this reason, our analyses focus on assessment of temperament
and externalizing and internalizing symptoms beginning at the 12-month postpartum assessment and
extending to the 24-month postpartum assessment.

Given ﬁndings of previous studies of relationship and co-parenting interventions on child
outcomes, we hypothesized that couples who received either the couple or co-parenting intervention
would rate their children lower on negative emotionality and externalizing and internalizing symptoms
compared to couples in the information-only control group. As the larger trial did not show signiﬁcant
diﬀerentiation between the two interventions compared to the information only control group on
parental outcomes, we made no hypotheses about their relative strengths compared to each other.
Finally, we hypothesized that lower infant negative emotionality at 12 months would be a pathway
through which group diﬀerences emerge in children’s externalizing and internalizing symptoms at
24 months.

2. Materials and Methods

All procedures were approved by the Texas A&M University Institutional Review Board (protocol

#2005-0210).

2.1. Participants and Procedures

In the original study, 90 opposite-sex couples (180 individuals) who were married or cohabitating
and were between 6–8 months pregnant with their ﬁrst child were recruited. The sample was restricted
to couples for whom one or both partners met at least one of the seven risk factors for problems in
relationship adjustment during the transition to parenthood identiﬁed through a literature review
(e.g., [37,38]). The seven variables identiﬁed as risk factors included: (a) Parental divorce in family
of origin; (b) father-to-mother violence in the family of origin; (c) not being currently married; (d) a
previous marriage; (e) reporting that they were unsure they wanted to have a baby at this time;
(f) mild-to-moderate violence in the relationship as indicated by endorsing one or more items assessing
physical aggression or injury (e.g., pushing, slapping); and (g) mild-to-clinical levels of depressive
symptoms, as indicated by a score of 14 or greater on the Beck Depression Inventory II upon screening.
Exclusion criteria included one member of the couple not being between 18–65 years of age, if the
pregnancy was not the ﬁrst child for both partners, if either partner reported severe interpersonal
violence (i.e., punching or more severe) in the relationship, or if either partner was unable to speak
English ﬂuently.

2.1.1. Couple Characteristics

Couples were married (86%) or cohabitating (14%). At baseline, participants were on average
27.8 years old (SD = 5.00) and had been married for an average of 2.52 years (SD = 2.47). The sample
was primarily non-Hispanic White (88.3%), followed by white, Hispanic (7.8%), Native American or
Alaskan Native (3.3%), Asian or Paciﬁc Islander (2.2%), and African American (1.1%). Over half of the
sample reported having either a bachelor’s degree (31%) or graduate-level degree (29%). The average
individual yearly income before taxes was $25,967 (SD = 1652/month).

Stratiﬁcation occurred based on whether the couples’ risk factors were distal (e.g., divorce in the
family of origin) or included at least one proximal risk factor (e.g., mild-to-moderate violence in the
relationship). Ninety couples were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions, which included:
co-parenting intervention, relationship intervention, or an information-only control (30 couples in each

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 766

4 of 16

group). Couples were paid a total of $500 ($250 per person) for completing all assessments; no payment
was provided for attending the intervention sessions.

Couples were also randomly assigned to work with one of ﬁve intervention coaches. The coaches
were Ph.D. level graduate students in clinical psychology who worked with an equal number of couples
in each intervention. The coaches met with each couple separately. At pre-treatment, the couples
did not diﬀer on baseline measures of relationship or individual functioning, cumulative risk factors,
or most demographic variables. The only exception was that women in the co-parenting condition had
higher mean total education than women in the other two groups (F(2) = 3.458, p = 0.04).

2.1.2. Information Control Group

Couples who were randomized to the information-only control group attended a single 90-min
session before the birth of the child. The information session discussed topics associated with the
transition to parenthood such as budgeting, breastfeeding, etc. The couple were able to choose topics
that they were most interested in and discuss those in more depth. At the end of the session the couples
were oﬀered the option of taking home handouts and pamphlets about the aforementioned topics.

2.1.3. Relationship Intervention

Couples randomized to the relationship intervention participated in four 90-min sessions (6 h in
total), with two sessions conducted before birth and two session conducted approximately 3.5 months
after birth. The intervention was based on Integrative Behavioral Couples Therapy (IBCT [39]). In the
pre-birth sessions, couples identiﬁed a “theme” for their relationship strengths and a conversation
was facilitated as to how positive relationship qualities might erode over the transition to parenthood.
Current relationship diﬃculties and problematic communication around these were also identiﬁed
and the coach helped the couple to engage in problem-solving exercises for the relationship problems.
Postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress were discussed, but only as they related to the romantic
relationship. The two post-birth sessions focused on how the couple’s relationship “theme” had
changed. The third session focused on resolving relationship problems through acceptance-focused
interventions or problem-solving exercises, as appropriate. In the fourth and ﬁnal session, couples
were asked to reﬂect on how positive aspects of their relationship had changed since becoming parents
and to brainstorm ways to maintain these.

2.1.4. Co-Parenting Intervention

Couples randomized to the co-parenting intervention participated in four 90-min sessions (6 h
in total) with two prenatal sessions and two postnatal sessions at roughly 3.5 months postpartum.
The intervention was designed to address the four components of co-parenting identiﬁed by Feinberg
(2003): support/undermining, joint family management, division of labor and childrearing agreement [2].
The ﬁrst prenatal session was focused on having couples discuss their expectations about the transition
to parenthood, particularly pertaining to common co-parenting tasks, such as expectations about the
division of labor, anticipated changes to schedules, or strategies to handle child rearing disagreements.
In the second prenatal session, the coach encouraged the couple to make a “co-parenting plan” to
help operationalize their expectations into a detailed behavior plan, including anticipated obstacles of
implementing the plan. The couple also discussed the potential impacts of postpartum depression,
anxiety, and stress on the co-parenting (but not romantic) relationship. During the ﬁrst postnatal
session, the couple revised the co-parenting plan and targeted problem-solving techniques were
incorporated if needed. In the ﬁnal session, couples worked together to create a co-parenting plan for
the remainder of their child’s ﬁrst year. For example, couples came up with ways to ensure consistency
in limit setting as a way to both promote supportive (vs. undermining) co-parenting behavior and
increase the likelihood of more eﬀective management of interactional patterns. A more detailed
description of the interventions is provided in the main outcome paper.

2.1.5. Adherence

A detailed description of adherence coding can be found in the original randomized controlled
trial (RCT) manuscript [33]. Brieﬂy, adherence was rated as “excellent” across conditions, deﬁned as
covering all major and minor points of the respective interventions.

2.2. Measures

All participants completed assessment packages upon study entry and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18,
and 24 months postpartum. The baseline and 12-month assessments were completed in person
while the other assessments were completed by mail. Individual packages were mailed to each partner
to ensure their conﬁdentiality. Temperament measures were collected at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month
postpartum time points. Information about child externalizing and internalizing problems were
collected at the 12-, 18-, and 24-month postpartum time points.

2.2.1. Demographic and Relationship Information

At the baseline assessment, information was collected about the highest level of education, annual
household income, relationship status, previous marriages, and family of origin information (i.e.,
parental divorce, parental violence).

2.2.2. Infant Behavior Questionnaire—Revised (IBQ-R)

The IBQ-R [40] is a 191-item, multi-dimensional, parent-report measure of infant temperament.
In the current study, only the 32 items of the Distress to Limitations and Fear scales were administered.
These two scales are part of the Negative Emotionality composite of the IBQ-R, therefore scores from
the two scales were combined into one average score. Parents reported their observations of speciﬁc
infant behaviors in the previous two weeks using a 7-point Likert scale that ranged from “never”
to “always.” Scores can range from 1–7 with higher scores reﬂecting more negative emotionality.
Reliability and validity of the IBQ-R has been supported by a very large literature (e.g., Parades and
Leerkes, 2008 [41]).

2.2.3. Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)

The ITSEA is a parent-report questionnaire assessing social-emotional problems and competencies
of children ranging from 12 to 36 months of age. Parents completed a total of 166 items. The respondent
rates each item on a 3-point scale (0 = not true/rarely, 1 = somewhat true/sometimes, 2 = very
true/always). For certain items a respondent may also respond “N” which means no opportunity to
observe the behavior. This study focused on the domains of externalizing and internalizing problems.
Externalizing problems was composed of 24 items, which yielded three subscales (ranges 0–2) that
included activity/impulsivity, aggression deﬁance, and peer aggression. The externalizing score was the
mean of these three subscales, scores can range from 0–2 with higher scores reﬂecting more externalizing
symptoms. The ITSEA domain of internalizing problems was composed of 30 items, which yielded
four subscales (ranges 0–2) that included depression/withdrawal, general anxiety, separation distress,
and inhibition to novelty [42,43]. The internalizing score was the mean of these four subscales, scores
can range from 0–2 with higher scores reﬂecting more internalizing symptoms. The validity of the
ITSEA has been established through associations between independent evaluator ratings and parental
ratings of child behavior problems, temperament, and parental distress [42].

2.3. Statistical Analysis

Mother and father ratings of their child were highly correlated and there were no signiﬁcant
parental gender diﬀerences on ratings of infant temperament, internalizing, or externalizing symptoms
at any of the time points (p > 0.05). Therefore, aggregate scores were created for the outcomes of
negative emotionality, internalizing, and externalizing symptom by averaging parent ratings at each

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 766

6 of 16

time point. The direct and indirect eﬀects of the interventions on negative emotionality, externalizing,
and internalizing symptoms were investigated in the steps described below. Candidate mediators
(indirect eﬀects) of 24-month externalizing and internalizing symptoms that were investigated included
12-month negative emotionality, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms.

2.3.1. Mediation Analysis in Randomized Controlled Trials

In a basic mediation model, an indirect eﬀect is represented by a path from treatment to outcome
via a mediator (calculated as the product of paths a and b) and the direct eﬀect is represented by the c’
path, after controlling for the a and b paths. An indirect or mediating eﬀect of an independent variable,
in this case treatment, can still be present even if there is no direct eﬀect [44]. This may occur when,
for example, an intervention has an eﬀect on proximal outcomes and those more proximal outcomes
have eﬀects on distal outcomes. In the context of our RCT, an indirect eﬀect (a*b path) represents the
proportion of the intervention eﬀect on outcomes at 24 months through the eﬀects of treatments on
outcomes at 12 months [45].

The mediation analyses were conducted in several steps. First, the eﬀects of the intervention on
each of the potential mediators (e.g., 12-month negative emotionality, internalizing, and externalizing)
were examined using basic ANOVAs in Mplus 8.1(Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
The eﬀects of the intervention on 24-month outcomes were also examined. Since a variable can
only be a mediator of treatment if there is a signiﬁcant eﬀect (p < 0.05) of treatment on the mediator
(a path), the mediation models were only ﬁtted to variables that were signiﬁcantly associated with
the treatment [44]. Next, mediation models were conducted to estimate the direct and indirect eﬀects
of intervention on outcomes with regression-based path analyses in Mplus 8.1 using bias corrected
95% bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals (CI) with 10,000 resamples. This approach accounts for the
non-normality of the sampling distribution of the indirect eﬀects [44]. Indirect eﬀects are indicated
when the CI does not contain zero [46]. As described by Hayes et al. mediation analysis with a
multi-categorial independent variable were speciﬁed with indicator coding such that each intervention
was compared to the information only control group [47]. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted in
line with CONSORT guidelines (i.e., all participants who were randomized were included) [48].

2.3.2. Missing Data

Missing values analysis indicated 16.02% of the child data points were missing at any point,
and covariance coverage for path analyses ranged from 0.80 to 1.00. A non-signiﬁcant Little’s MCAR
test suggests that data are likely missing completely at random (χ2 = 42.75, p = 0.61). Missing data
was handled using full information maximum likelihood (FIML), which produces unbiased parameter
estimates and standard errors [49].

3. Results

Results of the ANOVA showed that there were signiﬁcant group diﬀerences on at 12-months
on negative emotionality and externalizing symptoms. Compared to the information only control
group both the couples therapy and co-parenting interventions had lower negative emotionality
and lower externalizing symptoms. There were no other signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the groups
(see Tables 1 and 2).

Univariable regression analyses of intervention eﬀects on potential mediators and outcomes
identiﬁed two potential meditators, speciﬁcally, compared to infants in the control group, infants
in both intervention were rated as having lower negative emotionality (relationship intervention:
B = −0.315, p = 0.038; co-parenting intervention: B = −0.445, p = 0.003) and lower externalizing
symptoms (relationship intervention: B = −0.093, p = 0.021; co-parenting intervention: B = −0.091,
p = 0.021) at 12-months postpartum. In terms of outcomes, there were no signiﬁcant direct eﬀects of
either intervention on child internalizing or externalizing symptoms at 24 months postpartum.

3.1.1. 24-Month Externalizing

The direct and indirect eﬀects of each of the tested models are presented in Table 3. The indirect
eﬀect of intervention group through negative emotionality on 24-month externalizing symptoms was
not signiﬁcant for either the couple or co-parenting interventions. However, the indirect eﬀects of
group through 12-month externalizing on 24-month externalizing were signiﬁcant for both couple
and co-parenting interventions. As shown in Figure 1, intervention was associated with decreased
12-month externalizing which was subsequently associated with decreased 24-month externalizing.

The indirect eﬀect of group through negative emotionality on 24-month internalizing was
signiﬁcant for both the couple and co-parenting interventions (see Table 4). As shown in Figure 2,
intervention was associated with decreased 12-month negative emotionality that was subsequently
associated with decreased 24-month internalizing.

4. Discussion

Many couples perceive the transition to parenthood as stressful and experience declines in
relationship satisfaction during this time period [6,7]. Fortunately, programs have been developed
that mitigate declines in relationship adjustment and decrease parental stress, especially in high-risk
couples [33]. The results of this study showed that brief relationship interventions in the transition
to parenthood conferred secondary beneﬁts to children, such that couples who received either
the co-parenting or relationship intervention in pregnancy and the early postpartum period
rated their infants as having lower negative emotionality and fewer externalizing symptoms at
12 months postpartum.

Although no statistically signiﬁcant direct treatment eﬀects were observed on child functioning at
24 months, both the relationship and co-parenting interventions were indirectly associated with reduced
internalizing or externalizing symptoms at 24 months through improvements in child functioning
at 12 months postpartum. These ﬁndings suggest that the brief (4-session) intervention conducted
during the perinatal period had a long-lasting impact on child outcomes through an inﬂuence on
infant functioning at 12 months postpartum. The ﬁndings build upon an expanding area of research
showing that improving parental relationship quality and co-parenting has secondary beneﬁts for
children that may reduce the likelihood of later mental health problems. Our ﬁndings are particularly
encouraging as they show that these beneﬁts are possible through brief interventions. The indirect
eﬀects ﬁndings also raise questions about the “dose” of the intervention required to have long-term
child impact and whether follow-up or booster sessions may be helpful in order to enhance the impact
of the intervention on later child mental health outcomes.

The ﬁndings raise the question of what intervention works best for whom? Co-parenting and
relationship satisfaction have both been shown to be modiﬁable during the transition to parenthood,
and both appear to be reciprocally linked during the early parenting years both longitudinally and on a
daily basis in two parent families, so change in one can potentially have eﬀects on the other [34,50–52].
However, co-parenting interventions may be more attractive than other types of therapy interventions
to parents and may engender greater buy in, from fathers in particular, who describe parenting
as important [33]. The potentially greater appeal to fathers is important as men are generally less
amenable to help-seeking than women, and this has been observed for couple-based interventions
speciﬁcally [53]. Additionally, work in other populations has shown that co-parenting is likely a link
between relationship satisfaction and child adjustment [2,13,54]. Co-parenting interventions may be
easier to train for delivery by para-professionals, and thus improve accessibility and cost-eﬀectiveness.
In real world settings, it may also be important to blend these intervention types depending on the
speciﬁc needs of the couple. Future research is needed to determine under which circumstances a
co-parenting or relationship intervention is most indicated, and whether a combined approach yields
greater beneﬁt for some couples.

Psychological and Physiological Mechanisms

The intervention described began in pregnancy and extended into the early postpartum period.
This raises questions about the potential mechanisms by which perinatal interventions may aﬀect
child development outcomes. On a physiological level, it is well-known that stress-related hormones,
such as cortisol, cross the placenta and blood brain barrier, resulting in “programming” of oﬀspring
stress physiology and behavior. Furthermore, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is highly
responsive to social relationships [55]. Positive social relationships can buﬀer the eﬀects of maternal
stress on child outcomes by reducing physiological stress responses in mothers during pregnancy
and in infants postnatally [56,57].
In addition to physiological mechanisms, perceived support
from a partner is associated with reduced depression in mothers during pregnancy and improved
maternal–infant interaction postnatally, [57] suggesting that modeling and quality of care may be
additional psychological mechanisms by which improvements in parental relationships contribute to
improved child outcomes.

In a theoretical model linking interparental conﬂict to youth psychopathology, conﬂict is theorized
to be linked to children’s neurobiological and psychophysiological arousal systems in addition to
children’s cognitive and emotional processing, leading to increased risk of child psychopathology [1].
An implication of this theorized pathway is that children exposed to parental conﬂict will also have
worse health outcomes. Conversely, brief therapy interventions delivered to expectant couples have
the potential to improve both the mental and physical health proﬁles of the children. Although research
in this area is sparse, in women who received Family Foundation (FF), a transition to parenthood
program to improve co-parenting quality, FF buﬀered the impact of maternal mental health on birth
weight and hospital stay length [58], suggesting that infants exposed to the intervention were born
healthier. The long-term potential for caregiver relationship interventions to improve child health is an
important future area of research.

5. Limitations

There are several important limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this study.
First, child outcomes were assessed solely through parental reports. Parental reports have been
shown to be reliable in intervention studies and to yield comparable eﬀect sizes to clinical ratings [59];
however, parental reports may also have been inﬂuenced by the intervention received. Another possible
interpretation of these ﬁndings is that instead of improving objective child outcomes, the interventions
instead improved parental perceptions of their children, a limitation that could be overcome with
use of objective assessments of child behavior in future studies [13]. Nevertheless, we note that
improvement in parent perception of their children may be accompanied by improvement in perceived
parent competence, [60] which is likely to have downstream positive eﬀects on behavior. Additionally,
the mechanisms of change driving the eﬀects were not evaluated and so it is unclear if the intervention
inﬂuenced child development through relationship factors or changes in parental mood and/or stress,
each of which have been associated with parent–child interactions. Previous results from this RCT
have shown that both active interventions lead to less decline in relationship satisfaction and that
women experienced less perceived stress during the transition to parenthood, which may have been
the mechanism of change through which child mental health was inﬂuenced. Future research with
larger sample sizes should investigate these mechanisms of change. Finally, the study was also limited
by a relatively small sample size, including only 30 couples per intervention group, which limited
power to detect small diﬀerences in outcomes between the two active interventions.

6. Implications and Future Directions

Notably, the interventions tested in this trial were only four sessions in length. Despite being
brief, these interventions had signiﬁcant impact on child functioning that persisted for up to two years
postpartum in addition to relationship and parenting beneﬁts. The results of this study suggest that
brief and low resource interventions designed to improve new parents’ relationship satisfaction have
the potential to yield secondary eﬀects on their child’s health. The brevity of the interventions makes
their implementation and use very feasible for both administrators and parents in the perinatal period.
These ﬁndings directly align with a recent strategic patient-oriented research (SPOR) initiative that
found that new parents (conception to age 2) rated research aimed to improve relationship satisfaction
and parenting conﬁdence in the transition to parenthood as a high priority [61]. Given that child
mental health problems are prevalent and rising, and that the majority of families do not have access
to evidence-based treatment options, delivery of brief relationship interventions provide a potential
pathway for prevention and could promote child health.

For the wide dissemination necessary to reach new parents in need of relationship intervention,
e-health options are a potential avenue for further exploration [62]. In fact, results from two studies
found that parents reported a preference for online formats compared to face-to-face when receiving
parenting interventions [63,64]. Meta-analyses suggest that that parenting-based e-health interventions

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 766

12 of 16

yield positive shifts in parenting and produce change in child outcomes, with moderate eﬀect sizes [65]
and recent evidence suggests a similar outcome for online couples therapy intervention [13].

A ﬁnal consideration is that these ﬁndings are building on an accumulating literature showing
that couples interventions are cost-eﬀective and have associated secondary gains. Previous studies
have shown that mental health and medical service utilization decrease following couple therapy,
particularly in high utilizers [66–68]. Additionally, in the case of family therapy, secondary declines
in service utilization have been observed even in individuals who did not participate directly in
therapy [69]. Results from this study suggests that intervention delivered in pregnancy has a secondary
beneﬁt of decreasing negative emotionality and child externalizing symptoms, even though child
behavior was not a direct focus of treatment. Interventions delivered in pregnancy have long lasting
beneﬁts and are theorized to be more cost eﬀective than those delivered later in life [70–72]. Findings
from this study suggest that brief interventions targeting couple satisfaction and co-parenting may be
added to the list of cost-eﬀective treatments that improve child functioning.

7. Conclusions

These ﬁndings suggest that delivering low intensity, relationship-enhancing interventions during
the transition to parenthood has the potential to meet parents’ identiﬁed needs and confers secondary
beneﬁt to their children. Future research should continue to work to identify for whom relationship
versus co-parenting interventions are most eﬀective and to investigate modalities that can reach the
largest number of couples in a cost-eﬀective way in order to improve parental and child outcomes.
