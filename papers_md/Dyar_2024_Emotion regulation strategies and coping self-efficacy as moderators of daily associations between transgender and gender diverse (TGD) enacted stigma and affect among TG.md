Abstract

Background:  Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies have begun to establish links 
between sexual minority enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect at the daily level. However, 
few of these studies have examined the effects of the unique stigma experienced by transgender 
and gender diverse (TGD) people. Further, the potential moderating roles of emotion regulation 
strategies (i.e., strategies used to up- or down-regulate emotions) and coping self-efficacy (i.e., 
individuals’ perceptions of their ability to cope effectively with stressors) have been neglected in 
EMA research on enacted stigma.

Methods:  The current study aimed to extend this literature by examining the moderating roles of 
six emotion regulation strategies (i.e., reflection, reappraisal, rumination, expressive suppression, 
distraction, social sharing) and coping self-efficacy on concurrent and prospective associations 
between TGD enacted stigma and affect using EMA data from 115 sexual minority gender diverse 
individuals assigned female at birth.

Results:  Results indicated that coping self-efficacy buffered prospective associations between 
TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect, while rumination exacerbated these effects. 
Some unexpected buffering effects were identified in concurrent associations between enacted 
stigma and negative affect, with suppression and distraction temporarily tempering this 
association. However, suppression also prospectively predicted increases in negative affect, 
suggesting that any benefit of this emotion regulation strategy is temporary.

Conclusions:  Findings highlight emotion regulation strategies that may be effective in reducing 
negative affect, identify coping self-efficacy as a promising buffer of effects of enacted stigma, and 
confirm emotion regulation strategies that may exacerbate effects of enacted stigma.

Introduction

Page 2

Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals (i.e., people who do not identify with 
the gender typically associated with their sex assigned at birth) are at elevated risk for 
mood and anxiety disorders compared to cisgender individuals (Connolly et al., 2016; Su 
et al., 2016; Tebbe & Budge, 2022; Veale et al., 2017). Gender diverse individuals assigned 
female at birth (i.e., those who identify outside of the gender binary; e.g., nonbinary) may be 
affected by larger disparities in depression and anxiety, but this remains unclear given mixed 
findings across studies (Conn et al., 2023; Newcomb et al., 2020; Parodi et al., 2022). These 
disparities have been attributed to the unique stressors experienced by TGD individuals as 
a result of the stigmatization of gender diversity, referred to as TGD minority stress (e.g., 
discrimination and microaggressions experienced by TGD individuals such as misgendering; 
Hendricks & Testa, 2012). Further, nonbinary and genderqueer individuals also experience 
unique stigma as a result of the gender binary, such as invisibility, exclusion, and erasure of 
nonbinary and genderqueer individuals (Matsuno et al., 2024).

However, very little longitudinal research has examined the association between TGD 
minority stress and anxious and depressed affect or symptoms, with studies focused on the 
daily level being particularly rare (for an exception see Puckett et al., 2023). Further, there 
is a dearth of research at the daily level examining the potential buffering and exacerbating 
roles of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., strategies used to up- or down-regulate emotions; 
Gross, 2015) on these associations. Understanding the impact of these strategies in emotion 
regulation processes is particularly necessary for informing the development of interventions 
that aim to reduce the impact of TGD minority stress by teaching effective skills for coping 
with these stressors.

The current study aimed to extend our understanding of concurrent and prospective 
associations between TGD enacted stigma (i.e., biased treatment based on one’s TGD 
identity) and anxious/depressed affect at the daily level. We also aimed to examine 
the moderating roles of six emotion regulation strategies (i.e., reflection, reappraisal, 
rumination, expressive suppression, distraction, social sharing) and individuals’ perceptions 
of their ability to cope effectively with stressors (i.e., coping self-efficacy) among a sample 
of gender diverse individuals assigned female at birth.

Enacted Stigma and Affect at the Daily Level

A growing body of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) research (i.e., research using 
one or more surveys per day) has demonstrated daily associations between sexual and 
gender minority stress and affect (see systematic review; Nicholas & Bresin, 2024). Anxious 
and depressed affect are commonly used in EMA studies examining the effects of minority 
stress as the timeline for affect is often more appropriate than measures of anxious and 
depressive symptoms (Nicholas & Bresin, 2024). However, this body of work has three 
major limitations. First, these studies have primarily demonstrated concurrent associations 
between enacted stigma and affect, with enacted stigma associated with elevations in 
anxious/depressed affect during the same observation (Livingston et al., 2020; Mereish 
et al., 2021; Newberger et al., 2022; Nicholas & Bresin, 2024). Far less research has 
examined whether enacted stigma prospectively predicts increases in anxious/depressed

affect and these studies have produced mixed results, with some finding evidence to support 
prospective effects (Dyar, 2024; Puckett et al., 2023) while others have not (Feinstein et al., 
2022).

Second, existing EMA studies of minority stress have focused almost exclusively on sexual 
minority stress. A recent systematic review identified 43 EMA studies examining sexual 
minority stress, two examining TGD minority stress, and four that combined sexual minority 
stress and TGD minority stress into a single variable (Nicholas & Bresin, 2024). We 
are aware of only two studies that have examined associations between TGD enacted 
stigma and affect. One examined enacted stigma based on both sexual minority and 
TGD enacted stigma as a single variable, demonstrating concurrent associations between 
enacted stigma experiences and elevated anxious/depressed affect (Mereish et al., 2023). 
The other focused on TGD-specific enacted stigma and demonstrated both concurrent and 
prospective associations between TGD enacted stigma and increases in anxious/depressed 
affect (Puckett et al., 2023). Given the unique types of enacted stigma experienced by TGD 
individuals (e.g., misgendering; Hendricks & Testa, 2012) and the current anti-transgender 
political climate in the United States, it is particularly important to document the effects 
of TGD-specific enacted stigma and to identify emotion regulation strategies that may be 
effective in reducing the impact of these experiences.

Emotion Regulation Strategies as Potential Moderators

Third, EMA research on the association between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/
depressed affect has rarely examined the role of emotion regulation strategies. These 
strategies have been conceptualized as both mediators and moderators of the associations 
between minority stress and mental health. Hatzenbuehler (2009) posited that emotion 
regulation strategies associated with increases in negative affect and internalizing symptoms 
(e.g., rumination and expressive suppression) are more likely to be used following 
experiences of minority stress, thus acting as mechanisms through which minority stress 
contributes to poor mental health. There is also some evidence to support these theorized 
mediating effects at the daily level. For example, Dyar (2024) demonstrated that elevations 
in the use of rumination (i.e., repetitively thinking about one’s negative emotions) and 
expressive suppression (i.e., inhibiting the expression of emotions) mediated associations 
between sexual minority enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect. Among TGD 
individuals, Puckett et al. (2023) found that rumination mediated the association between 
TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect in concurrent associations, but this 
mediation was not evident in prospective analyses. These studies suggest that minority stress 
experiences may lead to an increased use of emotion regulation strategies that are associated 
with increases in negative affect.

However, individuals utilize a range of emotion regulation strategies following experiences 
of enacted stigma. Which strategies are effective when deployed against enacted stigma? 
Does the use of strategies that are associated with increases in negative affect (e.g., 
rumination and expressive suppression) amplify the effects of enacted stigma? These 
questions can only be answered by examining emotion regulation strategies as moderators 
of the association between enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect at the daily level.

Despite this, limited work has examined emotion regulation or other coping strategies as 
moderators of the effects of enacted stigma on affect or internalizing symptoms and we are 
not aware of any research that has done so at the daily level. Few of these studies have 
examined the types of emotion regulation strategies that are typically examined in research 
with the general population (e.g., rumination, suppression, reflection). Instead, researchers 
have examined the moderating roles of a range of coping strategies, like problem-solving 
and mindfulness, with each study often examining unique coping strategies not examined by 
others (Baams et al., 2018; Toomey & Anhalt, 2016). This provides researchers with little 
information about which emotion regulation strategies are effective in reducing the effects 
of enacted stigma at the daily level and which may magnify the effects of enacted stigma. 
This is problematic as the development of interventions that aim to teach effective skills 
for coping with enacted stigma require robust data about the efficacy of specific emotion 
regulation strategies.

Despite the limited research on this topic among sexual and gender minorities, numerous 
EMA studies have documented associations between the use of different emotion regulation 
strategies and anxious/depressed affect. Results of a recent meta-analysis indicate that 
rumination and suppression are concurrently and prospectively associated with elevations in 
negative affect, while reappraisal predicted subsequent decreases in negative affect (Boemo 
et al., 2022). This meta-analysis did not find significant associations between distraction 
and negative affect (Boemo et al., 2022). Findings are more mixed for whether reflection 
and social sharing are linked with changes in negative affect, with some studies finding no 
significant associations (Brans et al., 2013b; Cameron & Overall, 2018; Heiy & Cheavens, 
2014; Pauw et al., 2021) while others have linked reflection with decreases in negative 
affect (Blanke et al., 2022) and social sharing with increases in negative affect (Brans et al., 
2013b). The current study aimed to test whether the use of six emotion regulation strategies 
(i.e., rumination, expressive suppression, distraction, reflection, reappraisal, and social 
sharing) at the daily level moderated associations concurrent and prospective associations 
between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect.

Coping Self-Efficacy

Another potential moderator of the association between enacted stigma and affect may be 
the extent to which an individual feels capable of coping with negative emotions arising 
from stressful experiences. Hatzenbuehler (2009) proposed that minority stressors may 
deplete sexual minority and TGD individuals’ coping resources, making it more difficult 
to cope with these stressors. While there is some evidence to support the mechanistic 
role of reductions in coping self-efficacy in the association between enacted stigma and 
anxious/depressed affect (Dyar, 2024), individuals also vary in how capable they feel of 
coping with a stressor on a given day. Therefore, coping self-efficacy may also moderate 
this association, with the effect of enacted stigma on anxious/depressed affect being weaker 
on days when coping self-efficacy is high and stronger on days when coping self-efficacy is 
low. At the daily level, higher coping self-efficacy has been concurrently and prospectively 
linked to reductions in negative affect in a sample of sexual minority and TGD individuals 
(Dyar, 2024) as well as in a sample from the general population (Kleiman et al., 2023). 
In qualitative research, TGD participants have also highlighted the importance of coping

self-efficacy during the transition process (Budge et al., 2013). The current study aimed to 
build upon this prior work to determine whether coping self-efficacy moderated associations 
between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect.

Current Study

The current study aimed to address the lack of EMA research on the potential moderating 
roles of emotion regulation strategies on the effects of enacted stigma by testing whether 
the use of six emotion regulation strategies (i.e., rumination, expressive suppression, 
distraction, reflection, reappraisal, and social sharing) moderated concurrent and prospective 
associations between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect among a sample 
of TGD individuals. We focused on a TGD sample as this population experiences frequent 
enacted stigma and elevated rates of mood and anxiety disorders, while also receiving 
substantially less research attention than sexual minority individuals. At the within-person 
level, we expected that the association between experiencing TGD enacted stigma and 
anxious/depressed affect would be moderated by the types of emotion regulation strategies 
deployed. Specifically, we hypothesized the following:

1.

2.

3.

When individuals utilized more rumination, suppression, and distraction, the 
association between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect would be 
stronger, such that experiencing TGD enacted stigma would be associated with 
more concurrent anxious/depressed affect and subsequent increases in anxious/
depressed affect.

When individuals used more reflection, reappraisal, and social sharing, the 
association between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect would be 
weaker, such that experiencing TGD enacted stigma would not be significantly 
associated with concurrent or prospective anxious/depressed affect.

When individuals perceived themselves as more capable of coping with negative 
affect arising from stressors, the association between TGD enacted stigma 
and anxious and depressed affect would be weaker, such that experiencing 
TGD enacted stigma would not be significantly associated with concurrent or 
prospective anxious/depressed affect.

Methods

Participants and Procedures

The current analyses used data from a longitudinal study of substance use among 429 
sexual minority women and gender diverse individuals assigned female at birth conducted 
between August 2020 and May 2021 (Dyar et al., 2022). Participants were recruited via 
paid advertisements on social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram). Advertisements included 
a range of different images. Some included images of same-gender couples, while others 
included individuals or groups with Pride colors and flags. Ads asked members of the 
LGBTQ+ community to share their experiences by participating in the study. Ads were 
targeted to a range of interests relevant to the LGBTQ+ community (e.g., LGBTQ+ rights, 
media with LGBTQ+ characters, prominent LGBTQ+ individuals) and limited to individuals 
between age 18 and 25 in the United States. Ads were posted in individuals’ feeds so

that only individuals who met targeting criteria saw the advertisements. Ads generated 
618,815 impressions and 12,114 link clicks. 7,835 began the eligibility surveys and 5,563 
completed the eligibility survey. 2,009 were eligible, and 429 were ultimately enrolled in 
the study, with stratified recruitment quotas by race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual 
identity. Participants who appeared eligible based on their responses to the eligibility survey 
were text messaged by study team members to verify their eligibility and their access to 
a mobile phone with text message capabilities. To verify their eligibility, participants were 
asked to text demographic information (i.e., age, state of residence, email address), which 
was cross-checked with their responses in the eligibility survey. Participants who passed the 
eligibility verification were invited to participate and sent a link to the baseline assessment.

The study included a baseline assessment (day 0), a 30-day EMA study (days 1-30), and 
a follow-up assessment. Analyses presented in this paper used data from the baseline 
assessment and the 30-day EMA study. During the EMA period, participants were asked 
to complete two surveys per day. Invitations for morning surveys were sent via email or text 
message (based on participant preference) at 8:00am in their time zone and participants had 
until 1:00pm to complete the survey. Invitations for evening surveys were sent at 6:00pm 
in their time zone and participants had until 12:00am to complete the surveys. These times 
were chosen to give participants with varied schedules adequate time to complete surveys 
while also ensuring a gap of several hours between morning and evening surveys to allow 
for the examination of within-day lagged effects. Surveys took approximately two minutes 
to complete. The study received IRB approval at Northwestern University (where data were 
collected) and Ohio State University (where data are stored).

Eligible participants were 1) United States residents, 2) 18-25 years old, 3) assigned female 
at birth, 4) identified as women or under the nonbinary/gender diverse umbrella (e.g., 
nonbinary, genderqueer), 5) identified as lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, or queer, and 6) met 
alcohol or cannabis use criteria (i.e., reported having four or more drinks at least twice 
and/or using cannabis on at least three days in the past month). Participants were paid up 
to $150: $20 for baseline, $20 for follow-up, $1 for each EMA survey, and a $5 bonus for 
every six EMA surveys completed in a row.

Analyses for the current study focused on the 115 TGD individuals included in the sample. 
TGD participants were comprised predominately of people of color, with only 30.4% 
identifying as non-Latinx White. See Table 1 for additional demographics.

Measures

Baseline Demographics—Race and ethnicity were assessed by asking participants 
to select all options that best described their race/ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska 
Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino/Latina/Latinx/Latine, Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, and a different identity. Given the small number 
of individuals who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or 
Other Pacific Islander, or with a different identity. These three categories were collapsed into 
a single “other race/ethnicity” category.

Gender Identity was assessed by asking participants to indicate their current gender 
identity. Options included: man, woman, transgender, transgender man, transgender woman, 
gender non-conforming, genderqueer, nonbinary, and a different identity.

Sexual Identity was assessed by asking participants to identify the term that best 
described their sexual orientation: gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, unsure/questioning, straight/
heterosexual, pansexual, asexual, or provided a different identity.

EMA Measures—TGD Enacted Stigma was assessed by asking participants two 
questions. First, participants were asked an item adapted from Mohr and Sarno (2016): 
“Did you experience anything stressful or negative related to your gender identity since 
the last survey? This could be something that was relatively minor (e.g., feeling that your 
gender identity was not respected) or major (e.g., being physically attacked because of 
your gender identity).” Participants were asked to indicate yes or no. Regardless of their 
response, participants were asked to “indicate which of the following events you have 
experienced since the last survey because of your gender identity” and provided with a list 
of 10 experiences of enacted stigma that have been utilized in previous EMA studies (e.g., 
“someone misgendered me”; Dyar & London, 2018; Flanders, 2015; Puckett et al., 2023). 
Utilizing both measures allowed us to capture a wider range of experiences of TGD enacted 
stigma than either measure alone. Given that few participants endorsed multiple experiences 
of TGD enacted stigma on the same day, we created a binary variable from these measures.

Emotion regulation strategies were assessed using a daily diary measure capturing six 
emotion regulation strategies (Brans et al., 2013a). These items were administered only 
during the evening survey and participants were asked to indicate, “Today, how much did 
you do the following to cope or deal with any negative feelings you had.” A single item 
captured each emotion regulation strategy: reflection (“I calmly reflected on my feelings”), 
reappraisal (“I changed the way I thought about what was causing my feelings”), rumination 
(“I could not stop thinking about my feelings”), social sharing (“I talked about my feelings 
with others”), expressive suppression (“I avoided expressing my emotions”), and distraction 
(“I engaged in activities to distract myself from my feelings”). Participants indicated how 
much they had engaged in each strategy on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much).

Coping self-efficacy was assessed using two items adapted from the Coping Strategy 
Questionnaire (Rosenstiel & Keefe, 1983), which have been used in previous daily diary 
studies (Keefe et al., 1997; Massey et al., 2009; Stappenbeck et al., 2015), including those 
with sexual and gender minorities (Dyar et al., 2021). Participants were asked “Based on 
all the things you did to cope or deal with any negative thoughts or feeling since the last 
survey, how much control do you feel you had over the negative thoughts or feelings?” (0 
[no control] to 6 [complete control]) and “How much were you able to decrease the negative 
thoughts or feelings (0 [couldn’t decrease them at all] to 6 [could completely decrease 
them]). These items were averaged and internal consistency calculated using procedures 
recommended by Nezlek (2017) for longitudinal data and was strong (.91).

Anxious/depressed affect was assessed using four items from the Profile of Mood States 
Short Form’s depressed (discouraged; sad) and anxious (anxious; on edge) affect subscales

(Cranford et al., 2006; Curran et al., 1995). Participants were asked to indicate how much 
they felt each emotion since the last survey. Response options ranged from 0 (not at all) to 4 
(extremely). Affect was assessed prior to any other items on the daily survey to avoid order 
effects and was assessed in the morning and evening. Internal consistency was estimated 
using procedures recommended by Nezlek (2017) for longitudinal data and was acceptable 
(.76).

Analytic Plan

Analyses were conducted in Mplus version 8.8. There were 4,556 completed surveys 
from 115 participants. The median completion rate was 76.7%. Within completed surveys, 
less than 1% of data were missing. Missing data were handled using Bayesian methods 
(Asparouhov & Muthén, 2010). Frequencies, means, variances, and intra-class correlations 
were calculated for variables of interest and are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Bayesian multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) with diffuse (non-informative) 
priors was used. We examined concurrent and prospective associations between TGD 
enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect. In each model, within- and between-person 
components of TGD enacted stigma predicted within- and between-person components 
of anxious/depressed affect. In this and all subsequent models, we controlled for day of 
assessment and assessment type (weekend/weekday; morning/evening) at the within-person 
level. Further, we included first-order autocorrelations for the outcome in all lagged models 
(i.e., correlation between variable at t-1 with variable at t), which effectively controls for 
the prior timepoint of the outcome. Within-person associations among TGD enacted stigma, 
moderators (in the context of moderation models), and anxious/depressed affect as well 
as autocorrelations were allowed to vary across individuals. Age, sexual identity, and race/
ethnicity were included as covariates at the between-person level.

Next, we examined models in which the moderation of unlagged (i.e., concurrent) and 
lagged (i.e., prospective) associations between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed 
affect were tested. In each model, a single moderator was examined to reduce the total 
number of random effects estimated in each model, thus reducing the likelihood of 
nonconvergence. In lagged and unlagged models, TGD enacted stigma and the moderator 
were examined at one timepoint (t), while anxious/depressed affect was included at the 
same timepoint (t) in unlagged models and at the subsequent timepoint (t+1) in lagged 
models. An interaction term was created by multiplying TGD enacted stigma and the 
moderator. The moderator and the interaction term were then both entered as predictors 
at the within and between-person levels in each model. This further disaggregates within 
and between person variance of TGD enacted stigma, moderators, and their interaction. 
Models examining coping self-efficacy as a moderator used all available timepoints; 
however, emotion regulation strategies were only assessed during the evening survey. As 
a result, unlagged moderation analyses of coping self-efficacy focused on only evening 
surveys. Lagged coping self-efficacy moderation analyses involved TGD enacted stigma 
and emotion regulation strategies that were reported during an evening survey (capturing 
TGD enacted stigma and emotion regulation strategies used since that morning) predicting

anxious/depressed affect as reported in the next morning survey (capturing affect that 
evening and into the next morning).

Results

Participants experienced TGD enacted stigma during 14.0% of observations. See Table 
2 for means, standard deviations, and intraclass correlations for all variables. Intraclass 
correlations indicated that the majority of variability in emotion regulation strategies, 
perceived coping efficacy and affect occurred within individuals over time (ICCs ranged 
from .29-.42).

Unmoderated Effects of TGD enacted stigma

In the unlagged model, TGD enacted stigma was associated with anxious/depressed affect (b 
= .11, p = .01). Specifically, during observations when participants experienced TGD stigma, 
they reported more anxious and depressed affect than they typically did (i.e., compared 
to their average across all observations; Table 3). However, this association was no longer 
significant in lagged models (b = .05, p = .31; Table 4).

Unlagged Moderation Models

Two emotion regulation strategies significantly moderated within-person associations 
between TGD enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect in unlagged moderation models: 
suppression and distraction. Simple slopes for the suppression moderation indicated that 
TGD enacted stigma was associated with elevated anxious/depressed affect during the same 
observation at all levels of suppression (Table 5). However, contrary to hypotheses, the 
strength of the association was significantly weaker at higher levels of suppression (b = .20, 
p = .01 at high suppression) compared to lower levels of suppression (b = .41, p = .002 
at low suppression). Simple slopes for the distraction moderation demonstrated a similar 
pattern, with TGD enacted stigma being associated with elevated anxious/depressed affect 
during the same observation at all levels of distraction, but the magnitude of the effect of 
TGD enacted stigma was weaker at high levels of distraction (b = .20, p = .002) compared to 
low levels of distraction (b = .48, p = .004).

While no other interactions were significant, there were several significant main effects. 
Specifically, engaging in more rumination than usual was associated with higher anxious/
depressed affect during the same observation (b = .26, p < .001). Engaging in more 
reflection (b = −.15, p < .001) or reappraisal (b = −.12, p < .001) or perceiving oneself 
as more capable of coping with negative affect (b = −.32, p < .001) were all associated with 
lower anxious/depressed affect during the same observation.

Lagged Moderation Models

Rumination and coping self-efficacy moderated within-person associations between TGD 
enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect in lagged moderation models. Simple slopes 
for the rumination moderation indicate that TGD enacted stigma was not significantly 
associated with subsequent anxious/depressed affect between plus one standard deviation 
from the mean (b = −.03, p = .72) or minus one standard deviation from the mean of

rumination (b = −.24, p = .14). While the association between TGD enacted stigma and 
anxious/depressed affect did not become significant at high rumination, the significant 
interactions indicates that the association was significantly stronger at higher levels of 
rumination. Simple slopes for the coping self-efficacy moderation indicate that TGD 
enacted stigma during one observation was associated with subsequent increases in anxious/
depressed affect at all levels of coping self-efficacy. However, the strength of this association 
was significantly weaker at high levels of coping self-efficacy (b = .16, p = .02) compared to 
low levels of coping self-efficacy (b = .32, p = .01).

There were also several significant lagged main effects. When participants engaged in 
more suppression than usual during one observation, they reported subsequent increases in 
anxious/depressed affect. When participants engaged in more reflection and reappraisal than 
usual during one observation, they experienced subsequent decreases in anxious/depressed 
affect.

Discussion

The current study substantially advances our understanding of the moderating role of 
emotion regulation strategies in the associations between enacted stigma and anxious and 
depressed affect at the daily level. This study was the first to examine these associations at 
the daily level among a TGD sample despite their frequent experiences of enacted stigma 
and high rates of mood and anxiety disorders. Results indicate that rumination may amplify 
the effects of TGD enacted stigma on subsequent anxious/depressed affect, while coping 
self-efficacy acted as a buffer. Findings also revealed temporary buffering effects of two 
emotion regulation strategies that are generally linked to increases in negative affect (i.e., 
suppression and distraction). However, these effects were no longer detectable in prospective 
analyses and suppression prospectively predicted increases in negative affect, suggesting that 
these buffering effects are brief and use of these strategies may simply delay, rather than 
reduce, the experience of negative affect following enacted stigma. Despite a lack of support 
for reflection and reappraisal as buffers of the effects of TGD enacted stigma on affect, these 
two strategies did prospectively predict decreases in anxious/depressed affect, suggesting 
that they may help to counteract the effects of enacted stigma to some extent.

Counter to our hypotheses, suppression and distraction acted as buffers of the effects of 
TGD enacted stigma in concurrent associations. Although limited research has examined 
the moderating roles of suppression and distraction at the daily level, a recent meta-
analysis demonstrated a strong concurrent association between suppression and negative 
affect and a nonsignificant association between distraction and negative affect (Boemo 
et al., 2022). Given these associations, we expected suppression and possibly distraction 
would exacerbate the effects of TGD enacted stigma, contrary to the buffering effects 
identified. We propose two potential interpretations of these counterintuitive findings. First, 
suppression and distraction may help to reduce the impact of TGD enacted stigma in 
the moment, possibly by delaying emotional reactions to enacted stigma. Some studies 
with the general population have found similar buffering effects of suppression on the 
effects of stressors (Franz et al., 2021; Liverant et al., 2011; Livingstone & Isaacowitz, 
2018), consistent with our findings. However, these buffering effects appear short-lived as

moderation is no longer detected in prospective analyses and suppression even becomes 
a significant predictor of subsequent increases in anxious/depressed affect, suggesting 
a rebounding of negative affect following the use of suppression. Notably, expressive 
suppression has been linked with poorer mental health in many studies examining the use 
of this strategy over longer timeframes among sexual minority individuals (Hatzenbuehler et 
al., 2009; McGeough et al., 2021; Szymanski et al., 2014), suggesting that suppression is not 
an ideal emotion regulation strategy for coping with minority stress. In qualitative research, 
TGD participants have identified avoidance strategies like suppression and distraction as 
approaches that may be protective in the moment but have long-term negative consequences 
(Budge et al., 2013; Mizock et al., 2017). Second, experiences of TGD enacted stigma that 
are less severe and therefore have a weaker impact on affect may be more likely to trigger 
the use of suppression and distraction. Given that this is the first time such moderation 
effects have been documented among TGD individuals and the negative longer-term impacts 
of these strategies on affect and mental health, these findings should be replicated by 
future studies and the underlying processes contributing to these effects should be examined 
in more detail to advance our understanding of the impact of these emotion regulation 
strategies.

Consistent with hypotheses, rumination moderated prospective associations between enacted 
stigma and anxious/depressed affect. Although simple slopes were not significant, the 
pattern of moderation was consistent with rumination amplifying the effect of TGD enacted 
stigma on subsequent negative affect. This finding builds upon research with sexual minority 
and TGD populations (Dyar, 2024; Puckett et al., 2023) and research with the general 
population (Boemo et al., 2022) linking rumination with subsequent increases in negative 
affect. It demonstrates that rumination is not only more likely following experiences of 
enacted stigma (Dyar, 2024) but that when it is deployed to cope with enacted stigma, it 
exacerbates anxious and depressed affect. These results support the use of interventions that 
aim to reduce the use of rumination in response to minority stress and teach alternative 
skills for coping with these stressors (Pachankis et al., 2015; Pachankis et al., 2020). Future 
research should examine mechanisms through which rumination may amplify negative 
reactions to experiences of minority stress, such as by increasing hypervigilance for bias.

In contrast to our hypotheses, no other specific emotion regulation strategies moderated 
prospective associations between enacted stigma and anxious/depressed affect. However, 
when individuals perceived themselves as more capable of coping with negative affect 
arising from stressors, the prospective effects of TGD enacted stigma on affect were 
attenuated. This finding is consistent with theories of stress appraisal and coping, which 
posit that individuals assess their coping resources when faced with a stressor (Folkman, 
1984). If they perceived themselves as unable to mount a sufficient response to cope with the 
stressor, they react more negatively to the stressor (Benight & Bandura, 2004). This implies 
that perceiving oneself as capable of dealing with a stressor can thus reduce the perceived 
stressfulness of an event and its impact. Our finding suggests that an individual’s confidence 
in their ability to cope may be more important than the specific type of emotion regulation 
strategy deployed. This has potential implications for clinical practice and intervention 
development, suggesting that matching emotion regulation strategies to individuals based 
on which strategies are most effective for them and which boost their coping self-efficacy

may be particularly useful in reducing the day-to-day impact of experiences of TGD enacted 
stigma. Future research should continue to explore the role of coping self-efficacy in the 
association between minority stress and affect.

While reflection and reappraisal did not moderate associations between TGD enacted 
stigma and affect, we did find significant prospective associations between the use of 
these strategies and subsequent reductions in negative affect. This finding is consistent with 
research in the general population documenting direct effects of reflection and reappraisal on 
subsequent reductions in negative affect (Blanke et al., 2022; Boemo et al., 2022). Reflection 
and reappraisal may therefore still help to counterbalance the effects of TGD enacted stigma 
by directly reducing negative affect, despite the lack of buffering effects. These findings 
suggest that reflection and reappraisal may be effective strategies for coping with minority 
stress.

Clinical Implications

Findings from the current study have several potential clinical implications for practitioners 
working with TGD clients. Given the buffering role of coping self-efficacy on the 
association between TGD enacted stigma and affect, strategies that increase TGD 
individuals’ coping self-efficacy may be particularly effective. This may be achieved by 
exploring a range of strategies for coping with minority stress and focusing on utilizing 
those that make a client feel more capable of coping with TGD enacted stigma. Prospective 
associations between reflection, reappraisal, and subsequent decreases in negative affect also 
suggest that these may be effective coping strategies despite not moderating the effects of 
TGD enacted stigma. Findings also highlight the exacerbating role of rumination in the 
association between TGD enacted stigma and negative affect.

Together, findings from this study support the use of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral 
therapy approaches, like ESTEEM and EQuIP, which include content aiming to reduce 
rumination and teach more effective strategies for coping with enacted stigma (Pachankis 
et al., 2015; Pachankis et al., 2020). Although these interventions focus predominately 
on sexual minority stressors rather than TGD stressors, adaptations of such interventions 
to address the unique stigma experienced by TGD individuals may be effective given 
the overlap in emotion regulation strategies identified by this study and those targeted 
by these interventions. These interventions also aim to reduce the use of suppression. In 
the current study, suppression demonstrated some immediate buffering effects; however, 
suppression was also associated with subsequent increases in negative affect suggesting that 
these benefits are temporary. Combined with studies linking suppression with depressive 
symptoms (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009; McGeough et al., 2021; Szymanski et al., 2014), this 
suggests that reducing suppression is also likely to yield positive mental health benefits. 
Although further research is needed to advance our understanding of the effects of other 
emotion regulation strategies, it is promising that the results of this study broadly support 
targeting mechanisms incorporated in current interventions aiming to reduce the impact of 
minority stress.

Individual level interventions that teach skills for coping with TGD stressors place the onus 
on marginalized individuals. Unfortunately, this is necessary at this time given the ubiquity

of anti-transgender legislation passed in the past few years in the United States. These 
policies have been linked poorer mental health (Dhanani & Totton, 2023; Hughto et al., 
2021; The Trevor Project, 2023) and increases in exposure to enacted stigma from peers and 
family among youth and young adults (Dhanani & Totton, 2023; Schanzle et al., 2023; The 
Trevor Project, 2023; Truszczynski et al., 2022), highlighting the need for interventions that 
help TGD individuals cope with the added stressors arising from the current hostile social 
and political climate.

Study findings should be considered in light of their limitations. Only sexual minority 
gender diverse individuals assigned female at birth who used alcohol or cannabis regularly, 
lived in the United States, and were between ages 18 and 25 were included in this study. 
As a result, it is unclear whether similar patterns will be found among TGD individuals 
assigned male at birth, TGD individuals who live outside the United States, older individuals 
or adolescents, or those who do not use alcohol or cannabis or use these substances less 
frequently. Notably, monthly cannabis use and binge drinking are common in this age group, 
with 20-22% of 18-25 year old individuals living in the US engaging in cannabis use in 
the past 30 days from 2015-2019 (Palamar et al., 2021). Examination of 2021 data from 
NSDUH indicates that the majority of 18-25 year old individuals who used cannabis at least 
monthly, used on 3 or more days in the past month (24.3% used cannabis at least monthly 
and 19.6% used cannabis 3+ days per month)(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2023b). Similarly, 29.2% of 18-25 year old individuals living in the US are 
also estimated to have engaged in binge drinking in the past month (Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration, 2023a). Therefore, while the alcohol and cannabis 
inclusion criteria used for this study limit the generalizability of these findings, they likely 
generalize to a large proportion of TGD individuals between ages 18-25 who live in the US.

Second, recruitment took place via paid advertisements of social media, and this may have 
biased the sample toward LGBTQ+ individuals who were more likely to interact with 
advertisements about LGBTQ+ research. Third, given space limitations in EMA surveys, we 
did not assess all possible coping strategies and we focused on enacted TGD stigma rather 
than incorporating other types of TGD stigma (e.g., internalized stigma). Future research 
should continue to examine additional coping strategies and types of TGD stigma at the 
daily level. Fourth, we used two surveys per day, which allowed for the examination of 
within-day lagged effects but did not as much temporal precision as studies with more 
surveys per day.

Overall, study findings advance our understanding of the role of emotion regulation 
strategies in moderating the effects of TGD enacted stigma on affect. Results highlight the 
buffering role of coping self-efficacy and the promising prospective effects of reflection and 
reappraisal on subsequent reductions in negative affect. Findings also confirm the theorized 
exacerbating role of rumination on the effects of enacted stigma. Some unexpected buffering 
effects were identified in concurrent associations between enacted stigma and negative 
affect, with the use of suppression and distraction temporarily tempering this association.

Notably, however, suppression went on to prospectively predict increases in negative affect, 
suggesting that any benefit of this emotion regulation strategy is temporary. Findings have 
several potential clinical implications as they highlight emotion regulation strategies that 
may be effective in reducing negative affect, identify coping self-efficacy as a promising 
buffer of the effects of TGD enacted stigma, and confirm emotion regulation strategies that 
may exacerbate the negative effects of TGD enacted stigma.
