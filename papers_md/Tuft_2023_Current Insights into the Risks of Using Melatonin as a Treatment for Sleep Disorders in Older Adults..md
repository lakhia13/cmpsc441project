Abstract: Exogenous melatonin is commonly used for sleep disorders in older adults, and its use is increasing over time. It appears to 
have modest efficacy in treating insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Melatonin is commonly perceived to be a safe 
alternative  to  other  hypnotics  and  is  available  without  prescription  in  some  jurisdictions.  New  evidence  suggests  that  endogenous 
melatonin has pleomorphic effects on multiple organ systems, many of which are poorly understood. This narrative review summarizes 
the  current  evidence  regarding  the  safety  of  melatonin  in  older  adults  (defined  by  age  over  65  years).  Melatonin  appears  to  have 
a favorable safety  profile in this population, however there is a dearth of  evidence regarding the safety of  prolonged use.  There are 
several  factors  which  increase  the  risk  of  adverse  effects  of  melatonin  in  older  adults,  and  these  should  be  taken  into  consideration 
when prescribing to this population.

Introduction
Melatonin  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used medications  for  sleep  disorders  that  can  be  obtained without  prescription  in 
many  countries.1,2  It  is  a  synthetic  version  of  the  naturally  occurring  hormone  which  is  primarily  synthesized  in  the 
pineal gland from the precursor amino acid L-tryptophan and released into the third ventricle, subsequently reaching the 
systemic  circulation.  Melatonin  synthesis  and  release  is  under  the  inhibitory  control  of  the  suprachiasmatic  nucleus 
(SCN),  which  receives  light  input  from  retinal  ganglion  cells.  Bright  light  suppresses  melatonin  secretion,  which  rises 
during the early evening, is maximal in the early hours of the night and falls to virtually undetectable levels in the early 
morning and during daylight hours.3  Melatonin is also produced in numerous other tissues apart from the pineal gland, 
including  the  thymus,  gastrointestinal  tract,  as  well  as  in  innate  and  adaptive  immune  cells  in  the  bone  marrow  and 
systemic  circulation.4  Overall,  the  daily  endogenous  production  of  melatonin  is  relatively  small  (less  than  100  µg) 
compared to the doses commonly administered exogenously.5

Melatonin’s primary function is regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Highly sensitive melatonin receptors (MT1  and 
MT2) in the SCN and other areas of hypothalamus are primarily responsible for the effect of melatonin on sleep-wake 
rhythms.  Melatonin  receptors  are  also  found  throughout  the  brain  and  likely  have  other  neurological  effects  beyond 
promoting sleep initiation. Recent research has suggested a role in regulating the stages of sleep, as well as affecting the 
duration  and  proportion  of  rapid-eye  movement  (REM)  and  non-  rapid-eye  movement  (NREM)  sleep.6  Furthermore, 
melatonin receptors have been found in numerous other tissues including adipose tissue, coronary arteries, alpha and beta 
pancreatic  cells,  myometrium  and  testis.  Thus,  exogenous  melatonin  could  be  expected  to  affect  numerous  other 
physiological  processes  in  addition  to  regulation  of  sleep.  Melatonin  has  also  been  shown  to  be  a  potent

of academic inquiry.9

Several changes in sleep behavior and physiology occur with aging, though these can be difficult to decouple from 
concomitant  pathology  and  medication  effects.  Ageing  is  associated  with  a  reduction  of  total  sleep  time  and  an 
advancement  in  sleep  phase,  with  peak  sleepiness  and  wake  times  occurring  earlier.10  Also,  the  proportion  of  slow 
wave  or  deep  (N3)  sleep  is  reduced,  and  arousals  occur  more  frequently.11  Although  initially  contested,  there  is  now 
growing  evidence  supporting  a  natural  decline  in  peak  melatonin  secretion  with  age,  which  has  been  implicated  as 
a mechanism for these observed changes12,13 Furthermore, sleep disorders are more common in older adults, with rates of 
insomnia rising dramatically with age. Insomnia symptoms have been reported in up to 50% of individuals over the age 
of 60, with rates of diagnosed insomnia disorder between 12% and 20%.14 Circadian rhythm sleep-wake phase disorders, 
especially advanced-sleep phase disorder, also occur more frequently in older persons.15  It is also well established that 
sleep-wake disturbance is a key feature of most neurodegenerative diseases including dementia, being present in up to 
70% of patients with early dementia and 86% of patients with Parkinson’s disease.16,17

Exogenous  melatonin  has  been  well  studied  as  pharmacotherapy  for  insomnia  and  circadian  rhythm  disorders  in 
adults. It is taken orally and has oral bioavailability of 15% due to extensive first-pass metabolism, though this is highly 
variable.  When  prescribed  as  a  hypnotic,  it  is  usually  taken  30  minutes  before  bedtime  and  is  available  as  immediate, 
slow-release or a combined formulation.

In Europe and Australia, prolonged-release melatonin is available as an over-the-counter monotherapy for the short- 
term treatment of primary insomnia in patients aged 55 or over. Trials in adults have shown exogenous melatonin to have 
modest efficacy in primary insomnia, with an increase in total sleep time of 12.8 minutes, and a reduction in sleep latency 
of 4 minutes.18  A more pronounced effect has been observed in young adults with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, 
with  a  dose  of  0.5mg  of  melatonin  advancing  sleep  by  34  minutes  in  a  recent  randomized  controlled  trial.19  Several 
smaller trials in adults over 55 years of age have shown modest improvements in sleep latency and subjective measures 
of sleep quality with doses of melatonin between 0.3 and 1mg.20–24  Some studies have claimed efficacy of melatonin in 
reducing  the  symptoms  of  REM  sleep  behavior  disorder,  however  recent  randomized  control  trials  have  not  shown 
benefit.25,26  Melatonin  is  also  prescribed  to  assist  in  withdrawing  from  hypnotic  medications,  although  a  systematic 
review revealed minimal efficacy.27 There is currently much interest in the use of melatonin for treating the sleep-related 
symptoms  of  neurodegenerative  diseases  and  even  potentially  to  prevent  their  development,  though  there  is  limited 
evidence for this at present.28

For these reasons, melatonin is one of the most commonly used medications for sleep disorders in older adults. The 
pattern  of  use  of  melatonin  and  regulations  dictating  its  availability  vary  globally.  Clinicians  should  consult  local 
guidelines when considering prescribing melatonin. In the United States, melatonin is considered a dietary supplement 
and has been available without prescription since 1994. Substances classed as dietary supplements by the United States 
Food  and  Drug  Administration  are  not  assessed  for  safety  or  efficacy  and  are  not  subject  to  the  same  quality  control 
requirements as those classed as medications. In most European countries and Australia, doses below a certain threshold 
are available without prescription but are regulated as medications by the relevant authorities. Regulations vary within 
Europe, but several countries classify products containing up to a certain dose of melatonin (usually 1mg) as a dietary 
supplement, with higher doses available over-the-counter or with a prescription. In the United Kingdom, it is available 
with  prescription  only,  and,  in  Japan,  it  is  not  approved  as  a  pharmaceutical.  The  use  of  melatonin  is  rising,  with  an 
increase  in  prevalence  of  use  in  the  US  in  those  65  or  older  from  0.6%  to  2.1%  in  the  years  from  1999  to  2018,  and 
a similar trend in the UK.2,29

This review aims to summarize the current evidence for the safety of melatonin use for sleep disorders in older adults.

Results
General Safety Data
Our literature search found two recent systematic reviews on the safety of melatonin in the general population.30,31  In the 
analysis of safety data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials, minimal adverse effects were reported with both melatonin 
and placebo. A systematic review by Besag et al of randomized controlled trials including 2130 patients reported that the most 
common  adverse  effects  (compared  to  placebo)  were  daytime  sleepiness  in  1.66%,  headache  in  0.74%  and  dizziness  in 
0.74%.31 The rates of adverse effects were more common with melatonin than placebo but were considered of minor clinical 
significance given the mild nature of reported symptoms. The mean age of participants was not able to be precisely determined 
but was in the 5th decade of life, with the doses of melatonin used between 0.15mg/day to 15mg/day. The majority of the 
included trials were of a short duration (<12 weeks) and thus give no evidence for long-term safety.

Trials  performed  without  a  placebo  arm  have  naturally  reported  greater  rates  of  adverse  effects.  However, 
a  systematic  review  of  such  trials  concluded  that  the  rate  of  adverse  events  is  similar  to  data  from  placebo-controlled 
studies,  with  the  most  commonly  attributed  adverse  effects  being  headache and  dizziness.  The  age  of  participants  was 
between 20 and 80 years, and the doses of melatonin used varied from 0.13mg/day to 15mg/day. A systematic review by 
Foley et al including those with and without placebo arms reported at least one adverse effect potentially attributable to 
melatonin  in  24  of  the  50  trials  studied.30  Such  effects  were  generally  mild  and  related  to  sleepiness  or  daytime 
performance and were considered related to daytime dosing of melatonin. The trials included in these reviews were of 
a longer duration (between 2 months and 12 years) and included patients between the ages of 1 and 80 years but with the 
majority  in  adults  less  than  65  years  old.  Doses  of  melatonin  were  mostly  between  2  mg  and  10  mg  daily;  however, 
exceptions to this ranged from 0.3mg to 1600mg daily. The authors concluded that there was no increased risk of adverse 
effects in the melatonin arms compared to placebo in the trials included in the analysis.

Post-marketing  surveillance  data  provide  longer-term  evidence  regarding  melatonin  safety  in  the  general  population. 
A report from Germany reported adverse effects in less than 10% of the 597 surveyed patients taking long-term controlled- 
release  melatonin  at  a  dose  of  2mg.  The  most  common  adverse  effects  were  nausea  and  dizziness,  with  less  than  2% 
discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects.32  A much larger post-marketing study of almost 1 million adults reported 
a much lower rate of adverse effects of 0.008%, with headaches and dizziness being the most commonly reported.33

Melatonin appears to have a very low risk of dependence or withdrawal effects. However, there has been a case of an 
emergent movement disorder and agitation following melatonin withdrawal has been reported in a 22-year-old woman with 
severe deficits from cerebral palsy.34 There may be an increased risk of adverse neurological effects in those with significant 
organic brain injury, though to the authors’ knowledge no cases have been reported in studies of older adults with dementia.
There is a great variability in the doses of melatonin used in trials. A randomized controlled trial in children reported 
a greater rate of adverse effects with higher doses.35 However, a systematic review found no association between adverse 
effects and melatonin dose.31  A more recent systematic review into the safety of melatonin at doses in excess of 10mg/ 
day found an increase in the rate of minor adverse effects such as drowsiness, headache and dizziness, but no increase in 
the  rate  of  serious  adverse  effects  in  the  four  trials  included  in  the  meta-analysis.36  In  the  United  States,  the  usage  of 
melatonin at doses of 5mg/day or higher is increasing.2  Furthermore, there is much interest in higher doses of melatonin 
as therapy or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, with some mouse models using doses equivalent to 600mg/day in 
humans.37 Given the evidence for higher rates and severity of adverse effects at doses in excess of 10mg/day, appropriate 
scrutiny should be employed in trials using higher doses in older adults.

There  are  fewer  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trials  of  melatonin  specifically  in  older  adults.  The  indications  for 
melatonin in these studies are more varied and include patients without sleep disorders. Data from these trials generally report

similar frequencies and types of adverse events to data from the general population. A large, 26-week randomized controlled 
trial of 791 patients with primary insomnia noted no increased rate of adverse effects compared to placebo.39 A 6-month study 
of patients with Alzheimer’s disease reported an increased rate of diarrhea (4.4%) and respiratory tract infection (3.7%) in 
those taking melatonin, though these were not considered to be related to treatment.40 An 8-week trial of melatonin for REM- 
behavior disorder in 30 patients with Parkinson’s Disease with a mean age of 65 noted adverse events including headaches, 
fatigue, lightheadedness, and morning sleepiness, but with similar rates to placebo.41 No statistically significant differences in 
the number of adverse effects reported between the melatonin and placebo groups were observed in a 3-month trial of 25mg 
melatonin to prevent depression following acute coronary syndrome involving 252 patients over 60 years of age.

A Cochrane review of the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapies in dementia provides the most detailed analysis of 
safety data in older adults,38 This review included two trials of 164 patients over the age of 52 with detailed safety data. It 
concluded with low certainty that there was no difference in rates of adverse events between the melatonin and placebo 
arms (mean difference 0.2 events/person).

Three  other  systematic  reviews  of  melatonin  in  older  adults  were  found  in  our  literature  review,  though  none 
specifically investigated for adverse effects. The review by Vural et al examined 16 studies of patients over 55 years 
of age and concluded that the effects of melatonin were mainly positive, though no specific analysis of adverse events 
was  performed.42  A  review  of four  randomized  controlled  trials  in  243  patients  over  77  years  of  age  with  dementia 
noted no adverse effects.43 A third by Almond et al found one case of increased sedation with melatonin and two self- 
limiting cases of pruritus in their analysis of three randomized controlled trials, but minimal other adverse effects.44 
No  systematic  reviews  specifically  on  the  topic  of  adverse  effects of  melatonin  in  older  adults  were  found.

Evidence from randomized control trials suggests that melatonin may have a mildly increased rate of minor adverse 
effects, but there is a dearth of long-term safety data in older adults. A summary of the most important systematic reviews 
is provided in Table 1.

Regulation of Melatonin
In  countries  where  melatonin  is  available  as  a  dietary  supplement,  there  is  a  risk  of  inappropriate  use  and  a  lack  of 
medical  supervision  for  potential  adverse  effects.  The  majority  of  melatonin  consumption  in  the  US  and  a  substantial 
proportion in Europe is in the form of a dietary supplement.2

Pharmacological agents categorized as dietary supplements are not subject to the same quality control and regulatory 
scrutiny  as  medicines,  whether  prescribed  or  over  the  counter.  There  is  a  risk  of  poor  quality-control  resulting  in 
inaccurate dosing and formulation of the active ingredients, as well as the presence of active contaminants. A study of 31 
supplements containing melatonin in Canada found a measured content of −83% to +478% of the labeled melatonin dose. 
There  was  variability  in  content  within  the  same  product  of  up  to  465%.45  In  addition,  a  pharmacologically  active 
contaminant, serotonin, was found in eight of the supplements.

There is no post-marketing surveillance performed by regulatory bodies for adverse effects of dietary supplements. 
Adverse events from particular formulations and products are thus less likely to be reported. The safety data presented in 
this  paper  relate  to  products  containing  melatonin,  which  has  been  regulated  as  a  medicine,  not  a  dietary  supplement 
(with the exception of the telephone survey by Brodner et al). Physicians should caution patients to purchase melatonin in 
a form that is regulated as a medicine to avoid under- or over-dosing and potential exposure to contaminants.

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Several melatonin formulations are available, including extended-release, immediate-release and combined immediate and 
extended-release. Melatonin has demonstrated substantial variability in bioavailability, primarily due to first-pass metabolism 
and poor absorption. Absorption is also affected by food. Studies in healthy adults have reported bioavailability ranging from 
1% to 37%.46–48 Food delays the absorption of melatonin, with the time of peak concentration increasing from 0.75 hours in 
a  fasted  state  to  3  hours  when  taken  with  food.  Peak  concentrations  after  oral  administration  have  been  reported  as 
substantially  higher  in  older  adults,  up  to  240%  greater  than  in  adults  under  the  age  of  45  years.42,49  Other  studies  have 
found lower peak serum concentrations but approximately 50% higher mean concentrations with a greater variability in those 
aged 50 years and above.50 It is reasonable to expect that the same dose administered to an older individual would have more 
pronounced  effects.  Combined  with  the  variation  in  bioavailability,  there  is  a  compounded  risk  of  unpredictable  serum 
concentration. This may result in an increased variability and risk of other adverse effects in older adults.

Melatonin is metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome-P450 enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 enzymes 
to form 6-hydroxymelatonin and is finally excreted as 6-glucuronylmelatonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin via the kidneys. 
Clearance  of  melatonin  is  reduced  in  the  presence  of  liver  disease,  although  most  research  has  been  in  cirrhotic 
patients.51,52  There is little evidence of the effects of chronic liver disease on melatonin metabolism in older adults.

Drug Interactions
Melatonin is metabolized by the same enzymes as many drugs commonly prescribed in older adults. The magnitude of 
interactions appears to be quite variable, and only a small fraction of potential interactions have been studied.

Several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to substantially increase serum melatonin concentra-
tions including fluvoxamine and citalopram. These medications are commonly prescribed in older adults and have been 
found  to  be  used  by  20%  of  older  patients  in  nursing  homes.53  Fluvoxamine  has  been  shown  to  result  to  increase 
maximum serum concentrations by a factor of 2.8 to 12.54,55 Citalopram on its own does not appear to increase melatonin 
concentration.  However,  citalopram  when  given  with  a  proton-pump  inhibitor  (both  CYP2C19  substrates)  has  been 
shown to double the concentration of melatonin metabolites in the urine.56 Nortriptyline is an even more potent inhibitor 
of  CYP2C19  and  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  interaction  with  melatonin,  though  no  in  vitro  studies  have  been 
performed.  A  case  of  severe  sedation  after  commencing  melatonin  in  a  patient  taking  oxycodone,  citalopram  and 
nortriptyline  has  been  reported.57  There  appears  to  be  a  significant  risk  of  adverse  effects  with  concomitant  use  of 
melatonin and antidepressants. The high prevalence of use of these medications and the high incidence of polypharmacy 
in  older  adults  increases  this  risk  further.  Careful  interaction  checking,  low  initial  doses  of  melatonin  and  close 
monitoring for adverse effects after initiation should be performed in this population.

Melatonin  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  efficacy  of  the  calcium  channel  blocker  nifedipine.  A  dose  of  5mg  of 
melatonin for four weeks in those taking nifedipine resulted in an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 6.5 
and  4.5  mmHg,  respectively.58  Interactions  with  other  antihypertensives  have  not  been  reported.  Given  the  blood- 
pressure lowering effect of melatonin, there is a potential for unpredictable changes in blood pressure with the addition 
of melatonin to older adult patients taking antihypertensive medications. Monitoring for changes in blood pressure should

be performed after commencing melatonin in such a population, in order to avoid increasing cardiovascular risk or the 
possibility of presyncope and falls.

Another potentially significant interaction is between melatonin and warfarin. There is some evidence that concomi-
tant  administration  of  melatonin  and  warfarin  increases  the  prothrombin  time  and  international  normalized  ratio, 
particularly in older adults. There are case reports of increased bleeding in patients taking both melatonin and warfarin, 
though no life-threatening bleeding has been reported.59 Clinicians should consider increased frequency of monitoring of 
coagulation for patients taking this combination.

There is a risk of compound effects with co-administration of melatonin with other sedatives. A study in middle-older 
aged adults found that melatonin potentiated the effect of zolpidem in impairing psychomotor function and driving skills.60 
Concomitant administration of caffeine with melatonin in younger adults has been shown to increase maximum concentra-
tions of melatonin by 42%, presumably due to the effect of inhibition of the CYP1A2 enzyme on first-pass metabolism.61

Sedation, Cognition and Psychiatric Risks
As  melatonin  is  used  primarily  as  a  hypnotic  agent,  there  is  a  concern  that  it  may  be  associated  with  sedation  and 
impaired functional and cognitive performance. Other hypnotic agents can cause sedation the following morning: the so- 
called “next-day hangover” effect. Numerous trials have evaluated for this as an expected adverse effect of melatonin. 
There are occasional reports of impaired daytime performance, though these mostly occur with daytime administration 
and resolve with a change in the timing of dosing.31,62

Three  randomized  controlled  trials  reported  increased  subjective  sleepiness  with  melatonin  compared  to  placebo  at 
doses between 2mg and 100mg, without impairment of psychomotor performance.63 Numerous small trials have reported 
sedation  as  an  adverse  effect,  though  the  prevalence  varies  greatly.  Systematic  reviews  of  studies  primarily  involving 
younger individuals reported rates of increased sedation in 1.66% of patients compared to placebo, though this was not 
considered significant.30,31  It is  not clear if  this was  related to early administration of  melatonin. Short-  and long-term 
studies  (duration  of  3  weeks  or  less)  in  older  adult  patients  with  delirium  and  insomnia  have  not  reported  significant 
sedation in the treatment arms.21,22,40,43,64–67

Worsening of insomnia symptoms after sudden withdrawal of sleep-promoting agents (so-called rebound insomnia) 
has been reported with benzodiazepines and “Z-drugs” such as zolpidem.68  This phenomenon has not been reported in 
large randomized trials of melatonin. A three-week trial in 170 patients aged over 55, specifically evaluating for rebound 
insomnia with a withdrawal phase, found no evidence of increased sleep disturbance after cessation of therapy.21

Melatonin has been studied as a treatment for depression in conjunction with traditional pharmacotherapy. Systematic 
reviews in patients aged between 18 and 90 years have found no significant therapeutic or adverse effect of melatonin in 
depression.69  No other psychiatric adverse effects have been associated with melatonin in systematic reviews.31

Cardiovascular Risks
There  is  increasing  interest  into  the  potential  cardioprotective  effects  of  melatonin.  Slow-release  melatonin  has  been 
shown to have an antihypertensive effect, with a meta-analysis reporting fall in blood pressure of 6.1mmHg.70 Melatonin 
has been shown to have an unpredictable effect on the diurnal variation of blood pressure.71  While further research may 
find a therapeutic use for this effect, it may be prudent to monitor blood pressure after commencement of melatonin to 
avoid hypotension. Palpitations were reported by a 68-year-old participant in a study of prolonged-release melatonin and 
were considered possibly drug-related.64

Systematic  reviews  have  not  found  a  significant  increase  in  major  cardiovascular  events  with  melatonin  use.30,31,36 
However,  older  adult  populations  are  rarely  included  in  randomized  controlled  trials  of  melatonin,  and  the  risk  in  this 
population is not well known.

Endocrine Risks
Melatonin  has  been  demonstrated  to  have  pleomorphic  effects  on  the  endocrine  system.72–74  The  minor  effect  of 
melatonin  on  levels  of  luteinizing  hormone,  follicle  stimulating  hormone,  prolactin  and  growth  hormone  that  have 
been demonstrated in younger adults are likely to be not clinically significant in older adults.

Exogenous  melatonin  at  doses  of  1–10mg  has  been  shown  to  worsen  glucose  tolerance  and  insulin  sensitivity 
compared to placebo in men as well as in pre- and post-menopausal women after a single dose and persisting after up 
to 3 months of treatment.75–77  However, as melatonin is usually not administered during the waking hours when food is 
consumed, the risk of clinically significant effects on glucose tolerance is likely to be minimal.

Furthermore, a 3-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 2mg of prolonged-release melatonin in patients with 
a mean age of 63 years with established type 2 diabetes and insomnia showed no effects on glucose markers, but sleep 
was improved. An uncontrolled, open-label follow-up period for 5 months was associated with a mild improvement in 
HbA1c of 0.66% ± 1.15%.78  There are few trials that had follow-up of sufficient duration to find an association between 
melatonin use and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults.

Endogenous  melatonin  is  thought  to  have  a  role  in  bone  health,  primarily  by  influencing  the  circadian  rhythm  of 
osteoblastic  and  osteoclastic  hormones.79  There  are  mixed  results  of  randomized  controlled  trials  of  melatonin  in 
perimenopausal  women, but  a  modest  improvement  in  bone  mineral  density  was seen  in  women  with  osteopenia  after 
12  months  of  3mg  of  melatonin.80,81  Randomized  controlled  trials  have  reported  infrequent  fractures  in  those  taking 
melatonin  but  were  assessed  as  not  associated  with  treatment.67  One  12-month  trial  of  2mg  of  prolonged-release 
melatonin reported three falls resulting in fracture. Musculoskeletal adverse events were not associated with older age.30
There  are  few  and  conflicting  studies  concerning  the  role  of  exogenous  melatonin  on  body  weight.  Melatonin  at 
a dose of 10mg in addition to caloric restriction has been shown to produce significant weight loss in young, obese adults 
(7% versus 4% of body weight in caloric restriction only).82 Whilst a recent meta-analysis and systematic review of trials 
including patients between the ages of 31 and 68 years found a mean reduction in weight of only 0.48kg.83  A study of 
melatonin  supplementation  in  postmenopausal  women  with  normal  BMI  and  a  mean  age  of  56  years  demonstrated  no 
significant  weight  loss.84  The  effect  of  melatonin  on  weight  loss  in  older  age  groups  is  unknown,  but  melatonin  is 
unlikely to cause harmful weight loss in older adult patients.

The effects of endogenous melatonin on thermoregulation are well described. Studies of melatonin administration in 
older  adult  patients  have  demonstrated  only  modest  falls  in  body  temperature  (0.05  degrees).85  There  appears  to  be 
minimal risk of causing deleterious hypothermia with melatonin administration in older adults.

Conclusion
Overall, melatonin appears to be a safe medication in older adults relative to other commonly prescribed medications in 
this  age  group  such as  benzodiazepines, antidepressants,  antiplatelets and  antipsychotics.86  The vast  majority  of  safety 
data is from younger populations, as is the case for most medications, and thus the risk in older adults therefore cannot be 
as precisely quantified. However, the small number of trials for dementia and insomnia in older adults are reassuring in 
their safety profile.

A general principle in the investigation of potential adverse effects in pharmaceutical development is the number of 
patients required to detect rare events.87 Small trials can detect frequent adverse effects associated with treatment, whilst 
large  trials  are  required  to  detect  infrequent  effects.  Infrequent  adverse  effects  can  have  a  significant  impact  in 
medications  taken  by  tens  of  millions  of  people  (as  melatonin  is  in  the  US).  A  serious  adverse  effect  from  melatonin 
occurring at a rate of 0.1% would not be detected in trials involving less than 10,000 participants but would affect tens of 
thousands of patients in the US. Recent post-marketing surveillance data is reassuring in this regard, but the potential for 
serious adverse effects in older adults is significant given melatonin’s very widespread use.

There is still a risk of idiosyncratic adverse effects as detailed above, and these are likely to have a higher chance of 
adverse  outcomes  given  the  increased  frailty  and  organ  dysfunction  in  older  adults.  In  countries  where  melatonin  is 
available  as  a dietary  supplement,  there is  robust  evidence  that  melatonin content can  vary  wildly.  Combined  with the 
higher variation in absorption in older adults in addition to known and unknown drug interactions, there is considerable 
uncertainty in the plasma concentrations that will occur with administration. Appropriate timing of administration, 30–60 
minutes before bedtime, is important to avoid sedation.

Furthermore, given the diverse systemic actions of melatonin, due diligence should be exercised during prescribing 
with  regard  to  related  comorbidities,  such  as  in  those  with  liver  disease  and  at  risk  of  labile  blood  pressure  or  falls. 
Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for potential adverse effects after commencing therapy.

In  view  of  the  above,  melatonin  should  thus  be  considered  a  medication,  albeit  a  relatively  safe  one,  rather  than 
a harmless dietary supplement. In relevant jurisdictions, clinicians should advise patients to consume melatonin in a form 
that is regulated as a medicine rather than a dietary supplement. The judicious use of melatonin is also advised, noting 
that the most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine provide only a weak recommendation for 
its use in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder in adults, and recommend against the use of melatonin for sleep onset or 
sleep maintenance insomnia in adults.1,88 The lowest effective dose should be administered, with recommendations from 
the European Food Safety Authority and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommending maximum doses of 
1mg and 2mg, respectively.1,89

Further  research  into  the  long-term  safety  of  melatonin  in  older  adults  is  warranted  given  its  widespread  use.  The 
recent interest in its use in dementia and delirium will hopefully provide more evidence for its safe use in this population. 
Several trials in older adults have not reported safety data, and future trials should screen thoroughly for adverse events.
