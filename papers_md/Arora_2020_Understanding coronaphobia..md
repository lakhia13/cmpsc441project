Coronaphobia 
Fear 
Anxiety 
Pandemic 

COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to being a global health emergency, has multiple socioeconomic and psycho-
logical ramifications. COVID-19 research and media reports have revealed a rise in fears related to contracting 
the  virus.  Though  fear  is  a  common  psychological  outcome  during  pandemics,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  a 
continuously evolving disease outbreak and has unique risk factors. Therefore, fear related to COVID-19 might 
manifest  in  not  only  fear  and  anxiety  related  to  disease  contraction  and  dying,  but  also  associated  socio-
occupational stress. We attempt to understand the psychosocial process of the development of coronaphobia and 
postulate what constitutes coronaphobia, a new emerging phobia specific to COVID-19. We present a conceptual 
model  delineating  the  risk  factors  causing  coronaphobia  and  the  underlying  mechanisms,  for  a  better  under-
standing of its developmental process. From review of relevant research, the factors identified are, an unforeseen 
reality, unending uncertainties, need of acquiring new practices and avoidance behavior, loss of faith in health 
infrastructure, contraction of COVID-19 by head of states, cautionary statements from international bodies, and 
infodemia. These factors are assumed to cause interference with routine life, catastrophizing interpretation of 
benign symptoms, and social amplification of risk which lead to coronaphobia. The conceptualization of coro-
naphobia and the model will aid future research in developing psychometric measure of coronaphobia for use in 
clinical and research settings and design of policies and interventions for mitigating risk factors.   

1. Introduction 

In the COVID-19 pandemic, as in other pandemics, fear, anxiety, and 
worries  have  been  the  major  psychological  consequences  (Roy  et  al., 
2020;  Tandon,  2020a;  Xiang  et  al.,  2020).  COVID-19  related  fear, 
mortality rates, unemployment, protective strategies have become the 
most searched topics in Google search history (Charlton, 2020; Sullivan, 
2020).  Researchers  have  used  the  expressions  “fear  of  COVID-19” 
(Ahorsu  et  al.,  2020;  Mertens  et  al.,  2020)  and  ‘coronaphobia’ 
(Asmundson  and  Taylor,  2020)  to  indicate  the  fear  of  contracting 
COVID-19. Now that there is unanimity that COVID-19 is an endemic 
(BBC, 2020b; Kissler et al., 2020) and living with the coronavirus with 
constant precautions becomes the new normal, fear may become more 
pronounced (Tanner, 2020). COVID-19 affects all spheres of life and the 
risk  factors  are  more  unique,  numerous,  and  diverse  than  in  other 
pandemics. Therefore, fear may extend beyond falling ill or dying due to 
contracting  the  virus  and  evoke  other  fears  such  as  that  of  economic 
adversity  (Yoon,  2020)  and  infecting  others.  This  paper  attempts  to 

postulate  the  contents  and  antecedents  of  coronaphobia,  identify  the 
associated risk factors and the underlying mechanisms of its develop-
ment which might inform policy decisions and healthcare activities. 

2. Conceptualizing coronaphobia 

A phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by persistent, exces-
sive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity or situation. 
Phobia makes people avoid the triggers of fear; when such avoidance is 
not possible, it causes anxiety and distress (American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation, 2013). 

A search in the Scopus database using the keywords "COVID-19" and 
"Coronavirus"  with  "fear",  "anxiety/anxious",  "uncertainty",  "worry/ 
worries/worried", "phobia", "public place" and "public transport" resul-
ted in 499 studies after excluding studies with no abstract or in a lan-
guage other than English. Various components and outcomes of COVID- 
19  fear  have  been  reported  such  as  functional  impairment  leading  to 
hopelessness,  suicidal  ideation,  and  coping  deficits  (Lee,  2020),  fatal

like  meeting  people  or  overindulges 

and standing in queue (Tanner, 2020). The individual fears and/or 
avoids  situations 
into 
health-related  safety  behaviors  (like  washing  hands).  Reassurance 
behaviors  such  as  constantly  checking  body  vitals,  confirming 
absence of illness, self-medicating or rechecking sanitation perpet-
uates fear (Li et al., 2020), leading to phobia. Besides, the zoonotic 
origin of the virus (Andersen et al., 2020), may further lead to the 
fear of having exotic meat based food. Though the fear is realistic, it 
can  disturb  the  overall  quality  of  everyday  functioning  of  the 
individual. 

2.1. Comparing coronaphobia with other phobias 

To  understand  the  spectrum  of  pathology  where  coronaphobia  be-
longs, we present a comparative analysis with three other phobias as laid 
down in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) (Table 1). We 
observe  fear  of  specific  stimuli  in  all  kinds  of  phobia,  accompanying 
triggered  physiological  responses,  cognitions  of  lack  of  control,  help-
lessness, and/or death. Phobias share pattern of behavioral avoidance 
and  reassurance  which  is  beyond  realistic  proportions.  While  corona-
phobia shares similarities with the other phobias, the fear in it is not only 
limited  to  public  places/situations/objects,  but,  primarily  coming  in 
contact  with  humans,  physically.  Given  the  novelty  and  transmission 
rate of the COVID-19, the coronaphobia is intense, widespread, and in-
volves  sociooccupational  and  personal  domains,  with  apprehensions 
ranging beyond the self and the present time. It might be perceived as an 
equivalent entity in syndromes of phobia, given the presence of unique 
triggers and fear of the unknown. 

2.2. Risk factors of coronaphobia 

Traumatic events can lead to specific phobias (Garcia, 2017). With 
377,889 casualties, and 6,389,493 confirmed cases in 213 countries and 
territories (Worldometer, 2020a), and global socioeconomic and polit-
ical  consequences,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  a  traumatic  event  of 
greater  proportions  than  previous  disease  outbreaks  of  recent  times. 
Given below are the factors that make COVID-19 pandemic unique and 
form the basis for development of coronaphobia. 

2.2.1. The unending uncertainties 

The uniqueness of the COVID-19 pandemic lies in the uniqueness of 
the  agent,  SARS-Cov-2.  Even  after  five  months  of  being  identified, 
studies  are  still  divided  whether  the  SARS-Cov-2  originated  due  to 
zoonotic transfer, through either Malayan Pangolins or bats (Anderson 
et al., 2020) or whether it is a lab-engineered virus (Goodenough, 2020). 
The genetic mutation of the virus is quite mysterious with asymptomatic 
cases, fast mutation, incubation period of 2–14  days with some cases 
even reaching 19–27 days, adaptability to changing environments, and

cognitions leading to association of COVID-19 with terminal end (Dubey 
et al., 2020; Goyal et al., 2020), and anxiety and depression while coping 
with the ‘new normal’  (Cao et al., 2020; Chakraborty and Chatterjee, 
2020; Haleem et al., 2020, Huang and Zhao, 2020). 

Based  on  a  review  of  these  studies,  we  define  coronaphobia  as  an 
excessive  triggered  response  of  fear  of  contracting  the  virus  causing 
COVID-19, leading to accompanied excessive concern over physiolog-
ical symptoms, significant stress about personal and occupational loss, 
increased reassurance and safety seeking behaviors, and avoidance of 
public  places and situations, causing marked impairment  in daily  life 
functioning. The triggers involve situations or people involving proba-
bility  of  virus  contraction,  such  as,  meeting  people,  leaving  house, 
travelling,  reading  the  updates  or  news,  falling  ill  or  going  for  work 
outside. 

The definition implies three essential components (Figure 1), which 

reinforces the process of fear:  

i  Physiological: The fight or flight response of fear is triggered, on being 
exposed to antecedent event. Constant worry can cause symptoms 
such  as  palpitations,  tremors,  difficulty  in  breathing,  dizziness, 
change in appetite, and sleep (Wang et al., 2020).  

ii  Cognitive:  Fear  of  virus  would  involve  preoccupation  with  threat 
provoking cognitions (Chakraborty and Chatterjee, 2020), e.g. ‘I will 
die if I contract the virus, ‘I will not be able to go to my job and will be 
unemployed’; ‘My family is under danger and they may die’. The cog-
nitions may further trigger emotional responses, like sadness, guilt, 
and anger.  

iii  Behavioral: In order to prevent the consequences, individuals engage 
in avoidance behaviors. There is marked fear of using public trans-
portation,  touching  any  surface,  being  at  open  places  (markets, 
beaches, stadiums) and at enclosed places (hotels, shopping malls, 
movie theatres, indoor stadiums), attending any public gatherings,

variable  strains  (Kaplan  et  al.,  2020;  Kumar,  2020;  Worldometer, 
2020b). 

2.2.2. Unforeseen reality 

Change in any form is threatening initially, as it disturbs the equi-
librium  and  the  stability,  seeding  insecurity.  The  enforced  instability 
due to COVID-19 is threatening, compulsive, and unpleasing. The terms 
— lockdown, quarantine, and self-isolation, which now are frequently in 
use among the masses, normally carries negative connotations and were 
assigned  to  prisoners,  making  them  experience  chronophobia  (Naguy 
et al., 2020). Similarly, people locked during the early and peak days of 
this  pandemic,  dwelt  over  thoughts  related  to  the  unlocking  of  the 
lockdown and the hardships. 

2.2.3. Acquiring new practices and avoidance behavior 

Acquiring  new  behavioral  change  requires  considerable  thoughts, 
mindfulness,  and  change  in  habits.  The  recent  forced  behavioral 
changes— social distancing, wearing mask, consistent hygiene practices 
of hand washing, and avoidance behavior including avoiding touching 
face  and  large  gatherings—  will  initiate  a  vicious  loop  of  discomfort, 
fear, and anxiety. A human normally touches their face on an average 23 
times an hour (Kwok et al., 2015). Now that touching face is a risk factor, 
people  have  to  be  mindful  of  not  engaging  in  a  practice  which  was 
practiced mindlessly since birth (Markman, 2020). Inculcating a habit of 
not  performing  a  practice  is  primarily  discomforting,  ineffective,  and 
requires a habit reprograming, which further requires 68–254 days to 
acquire and done involuntarily (Lally et al., 2010). Unable to acquire 
such changes in a short span will further create fear and anxiety. People 
then tend to panic more and lose control, making them more susceptible 
to the coronaphobia. Even our unconscious mind operates to reduce the 
contagion  and  produce  unconscious  psychological  responses,  termed 
behavioral immune system (Murray and Schaller, 2016), acting as a first 
line of defense, warning us from the possible infection. However, being 
instinctive in nature, the system attacks rationality and leads to alter-
nations and errors in decision-making. 

2.2.4. Statements from the international organizations 

People  deeply  rely  on  international  organizations  and  their  pre-
dictions for hope and optimism. UN and IMF terming the COVID-19 as 
the  worst  global  crisis  ever  since  the  Great  Depression  of  1930s 
respectively  (BBC,  2020a;  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and 
Development,  2020),  has  further  set  the  tone  for  a  scary  future  and 
uncertainty.  World  Economic  Forum  (Scott,  2020),  has  even  referred 
this pandemic as several crises packed in one, namely, healthcare crisis, 
economic crisis, energy crisis, and humanitarian crisis, worsening the 
geopolitical  risks,  globally.  WHO  and  recent  studies  have  further 
cautioned that COVID-19 hasn’t run its full course with the worst yet to 
unravel (Tandon, 2020b). 

2.2.5. Failure of powerhouses and lack of faith in health care facilities 

Countries (mostly developed) on the top of the ladder in providing 
health securities and capabilities globally such as US, UK, France, Spain, 
and Italy (Global Health Security Index, 2019) have not been able to 
address the crisis effectively. During crisis such as this, the faith and trust 
of  people  in  their  national  healthcare  facilities  become  paramount. 
Failure of national healthcare systems could set a ripple effect across the 
globe. Moreover, one can imagine the plight in middle and lower income 
countries  where  people  were  already  suspicious  of  their  country’s 
healthcare facilities, associated poor hygiene, and lack of infrastructure, 
furthering anxiety and panic during the pandemic. 

2.2.6. Leaders and famous celebrities contracting COVID-19 

The  powerful  leaders  and  their  close  ones  of  developed  countries 
have contracted COVID-19, such as Boris Johnson (Prime Minister, UK), 
Jair  Bolsonaro  (President,  Brazil),  Prince  Charles  (Prince  of  Wales), 
wives  of  Canadian  and  Spanish  Prime  Ministers,  and  few  health 

ministers. A leader represents the collective bestowed faith of the citi-
zens,  a  face  of  valor  and  spirit,  and  is  viewed  as  the  most  powerful 
person of that country or even globally. Witnessing their leaders con-
tracting the virus, might induce a sense of helplessness and deepens the 
anxiety of the citizens. Furthermore, the perception that their leaders 
and governments are not doing enough or are incapable can also lead to 
despair  (Prado,  2020).  Also,  rich  and  famous  celebrities  and  sports-
persons testing positive might make people feel that even the rich and 
privileged are not safe, which may further create a sense of helplessness. 

2.2.7. The relentless infodemia taking the shape of an infodemic 

The  pandemic  is  witnessing  global  infodemia  facilitated  by  social 
media and other online resources. WHO had warned of the infodemic 
accompanying  COVID-19,  an  over-abundance  of  information  –  some 
accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy 
sources  and  reliable  guidance  (World  Health  Organization,  2020a, 
February 2). The COVID-19 infodemic is considered as the first true social 
media  infodemic  (Hao  and  Basu,  2020).  It  has  established  how  social 
media  can  be  global  public  health  threat  (Larson,  2018)  due  to  con-
flicting and manipulative misinformation in the form of fake news about 
possible cures, symptoms, and mortalities. These platforms have become 
breeding  grounds  for  distorted  thinking,  leading  to  panic,  confusion, 
racism, and threat perception of an unrealistic intensity (Kulkarni et al., 
2020). 

2.3. How coronaphobia builds up? 

2.3.1.

Interference with routine life 

Why do people become fearful or fall into a panic state? Epidemic 
psychology has seen its roots in the order and routine of human species 
(Schutz, 1970). The human brain is pre-wired to thrive on certainty and 
has disdain for uncertainty, which represents danger (Robinson, 2020). 
For the brain, anticipating a pain is acceptable, but not an uncertainty. 
Stability  is  indispensable  to  humans’  schema  and  meaning-making. 
Normally,  people  have  a  blueprint  of  each  day,  with  a 
taken-for-granted array of solutions for the life tasks which is a part of 
their personal consciousness (Strong, 1990). A daily life is more assumed 
rather  than  planned.  We  do  innumerous  tasks  daily,  pay  attention  to 
few, while others are done on ‘auto-pilot’ mode. A crisis like the current 
pandemic disturbs the set system and questions the certainty with which 
we were habituated, forcing us to reset. The mystery over the origin of 
the virus and the associated and prolonged uncertainties give rise to fear 
of  the  unknown,  considered  a  fundamental  fear  of  human  (Carleton, 
2016). Less portion of our life remains steady, demanding us to change 
our ways and coping mechanisms. Such an attack of uncertainty on our 
fragile  life  and  temporal  stability  lead  to  outburst  of  irrational  and 
negative  emotions,  like  panic  and  phobia.  Furthermore,  humans  are 
cognitive miser (Fiske and Taylor, 1984), making them more vulnerable 
during crisis to fall for decision-making biases, fueling anxiety and fear. 

2.3.2. Cognitive behavioral perspective 

Based  on  the  cognitive-behavioral  model,  it  can  be  said  that 
pandemic reactions such as misinterpretations of health-related stimuli, 
cognitive  distortions,  irrational  beliefs,  maladaptive  behaviors,  and 
attention processes have a central role in coronaphobia (Leventhal et al., 
2016; Taylor and Asmundson, 2017). For instance, in agoraphobia, the 
person fears getting a panic attack in a ‘specific’ situation (Mineka and 
Zinbarg,  2006)  or  appraises  the  bodily  sensations  in  catastrophizing 
manner (Barlow, 2004). Hence, it is the appraisal of the threat in the 
situation which causes phobia. 

Appraisal of bodily sensations, such as fever, cough, tiredness, and 
breathing  difficulty,  reported  as  the  most  felt  symptom  of  COVID-19 
(World Health Organization, 2020b), together with the self-evaluation 
of inability to cope with such threatening cues can lead to health anxi-
ety.  Subsequently,  individuals  may  then  seek  consultation,  not  only 
because of the physical discomfort, but also due to presence of varied 

AsianJournalofPsychiatry54(2020)1023843A. Arora et al.

anxiety-provoking  cognitive  events.  For  instance,  the  knowledge  that 
COVID-19  spreads  through  human  contact,  may  get  connected  to  an 
outside visit the person might have made, say to a nearby grocery shop 
recently. Later, the appraisal of any physical symptom may be labeled as 
‘contraction of infection’. Moreover, many of the COVID-19 cases are 
asymptomatic  (ICMR  COVID  Study  Group  and  VRDLN  Team,  2020) 
further  spiraling  a  cycle  of  fear  among  the  people  and  making  them 
scrutinize even the mildest of bodily signs or any social engagement. In 
the  current  pandemic,  as  in  past  disease  outbreaks  (HIV-AIDS,  H1N1 
Influenza, and Ebola; Taylor, 2019), helplines have been flooded with 
distress  calls  from  people  worried  that  their  benign  symptoms  are 
related  to  COVID-19  (Sinha  and  Dev,  2020).  Such  catastrophic  in-
terpretations  may  not  be  satisfied  by  the  clinical  measurements  and 
hence,  they  are  preoccupied  with  symptoms  and  seek  repeated  reas-
surance, leading us to the behavioral part of coronaphobia. 

Reassurance  can  be  sought  in  a  variety  of  subtle  ways,  including 
repeated  checking  of  bodily  sensations,  measuring  fever,  self- 
medicating,  reading  news,  and  discussing  with  family,  as  in  agora-
phobia,  where  patients  seek  presence  of  a  ‘safe’  reassuring  person 
(Carter  et  al.,  1995)  to  cope.  Long  term  engagements  in  such  safety 
seeking behaviors may lead to overdoing of activities which will provide 
them gratification and sense of protection, or prevent the threat fueling 
physical  changes  and  elevation  of  the  stress,  consequently  leading  to 
state of coronaphobia. 

The  ‘amplification  stations’  enormously  influence  the  social  con-
struction of the risk presentation and transmission. These include loved 
ones, scientists, researchers, risk managing organizations, leaders, and 
news agencies (Kasperson, 2017) with social media and networking sites 
being the latest entrants. During the SARS outbreak in 2002(cid:0) 03, news 
agencies  were  held  responsible  for  the  exaggerated  display  of  news, 
leading to mass anxiety, and xenophobia (Muzzatti, 2005). Hence, the 
perception of the health threat comes from the perceptual and symbolic 
representation, created by the media and digital platforms. At present, 
two of the widely used social media platforms – Facebook and WhatsApp 
–  are  flooded  with  unverified  information  related  to  COVID-19  and 
contain  inaccurate  information  (Tewari,  2020).  The  rapid  spread  of 
unverified news can create a ripple effect of misinformation. Elevated 
worries  and  avoidance  behavior  has  been  reported  in  people  with 
agoraphobia,  wherever  they  were  exposed  to  catastrophic  visuals  of 
infections, deaths, and separation from family (Day et al., 2004). Such 
unreliable information creates panic and phobia for even neutral things, 
places, and situations (Figure 2). 

Hence, we postulate that coronaphobia develops out of the interac-
tion of external causes which act as risk factors with the psychosocial 
processes of interference with routine life, catastrophic interpretations, 
and  social  amplification  of  risk,  which  act  as  underlying  route  of 
development.  Managing  coronaphobia  shall  hence  require  measures 
specific to these dual mechanisms. 

2.3.3. Sociocultural amplification of risk 

3. Contribution 

The  social  and  cultural  model  of  pandemic  encapsulates  fear  and 
phobia  as  born out  of  risk  perception and  response  based  on psycho-
logical, sociological, and cultural factors, commonly referred as ‘social 
amplification of risk’ (Kasperson, 2017). Factual risk of events combines 
with  sociocultural  perspectives  and  amplifies  public  responses.  This 
occur through two processes —  (a) transfer of information about risk, 
and (b) mechanism of social response. In the former, individuals learn 
about  risk  from  various  sources,  called  ‘amplification  stations’.  Such 
information colors risk perceptions and levels of concern and act as a key 
factor in deciding the volume of risk, disputation of information, and its 
symbolic connotations. This is followed by the interpretation of the risk 
in the context of social, institutional, and cultural factors, such as social 
groups, stigma attached, and polarized social views. Hence, an amplified 
risk  perception  builds  up,  leading  to  heightened  behavioral  response, 
like phobia. 

The paper attempts to extend the existing limited research on fear of 
COVID-19  through  a  detailed  conceptualization  of  coronaphobia 
including definition, risk factors, and underlying psychosocial processes. 
This conceptualization can aid future research on development of psy-
chometric  measures  of  coronaphobia  and  help  all  stakeholders  in  un-
derstanding the cause, framing the diagnosis, and devising policies and 
interventions for the masses to mitigate coronaphobia.
