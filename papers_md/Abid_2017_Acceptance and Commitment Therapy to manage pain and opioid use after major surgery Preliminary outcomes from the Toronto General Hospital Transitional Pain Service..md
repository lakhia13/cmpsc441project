ABSTRACT
Background: Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) and associated long-term opioid use are major
public health concerns.
Aims: The Toronto General Hospital Transitional Pain Service (TPS) is a multidisciplinary, hospital-
integrated program developed to prevent and manage CPSP and support opioid tapering. This clinical
practice–based study reports on preliminary outcomes of the TPS psychology program, which pro-
vides acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to patients at risk for CPSP and persistent opioid use.
Methods: Ninety-one patients received ACT, whereas 252 patients did not (no ACT group). Patient
outcomes were compared for the two groups at first and last TPS visits. Pain, pain interference,
sensitivity to pain traumatization, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and opioid use were
analyzed using two-way (Group [ACT, no ACT] × Time [first, last visit]) analyses of variance (ANOVAs).
Results: Patients referred to ACT were more likely to report a mental health condition preoperatively
(P < 0.001), had higher opioid use (P < 0.001) at the first postsurgical visit, and reported higher
sensitivity to pain traumatization (P < 0.05) and anxiety (P < 0.05) than the no ACT group at both time
points. Both groups showed reductions in pain, pain interference, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and
opioid use by the last TPS visit (P < 0.05). The ACT group demonstrated greater reductions in opioid
use and pain interference and showed reductions in depressed mood (P = 0.001) by the end of
treatment compared to the no ACT group.
Conclusion: Preliminary outcomes suggest that ACT was effective in reducing opioid use
while pain interference and mood improved.
RÉSUMÉ
Contexte: La douleur chronique post-chirurgicale (DCPC) et l’usage à long terme d’opioïdes qui y
sont associées sont des préoccupations majeures en santé publique.
Objectifs: Le Service de la douleur transitionnelle (STD) de l’Hôpital général de Toronto est un
programme multidisciplinaire qui a été mis sur pied au sein même de l’hôpital pour prévenir et
prendre en charge la douleur chronique post-chirurgicale et diminuer l’usage d’opioïdes. Cette
étude clinique axée sur les pratiques porte sur les résultats préliminaires du programme de
psychologie du STD. Ce programme offre une thérapie d’acceptation et d’engagement (ACT)
aux patients à risques de douleur post-chirurgicale chronique et d’usage persistant d’opioïdes.
Méthodes: Quatre-vingt onze patients ont bénéficié de l’ACT, tandis que deux-cent cinquante-deux
patients n’en ont pas bénéficié (groupe sans ACT). Les résultats obtenus ont été comparés pour les
patients des deux groupes lors de la première et de la dernière visite d’ACT. Une analyse de variance à
deux facteurs (groupe [ACT - sans ACT] x moment [première, dernière visite]) a été effectuée pour la
douleur, l’interférence de la douleur, la sensibilité au traumatisme de la douleur, la catastrophisation
de la douleur, l’anxiété, la dépression et l’usage d’opioïdes.
Résultats: Les résultats suggèrent que les patients référés à l’ACT étaient plus susceptibles de
souffrir d’un problème de santé mentale avant l’opération chirurgicale (p < 0,001) et présentaient un
plus grand usage d’opioïdes (p < 0,001) au moment de la première visite post-chirurgicale. De plus,
ils manifestaient une plus grande prédisposition a la douleur en lien avec un sensibilité au trauma-
tisme (p < 0,05) et à l’anxiété (p < 0,05) comparativement au groupe sans ACT. Une diminution de la
douleur, de l’interférence de la douleur, de la catastrophisation en lien à la douleur et de l’usage
d’opioïdes au moment de la dernière visite au STD (p < 0,05) a été observée chez les sujets des deux
groupes. Une plus grande diminution de l’usage d’opioïdes, de l’interférence de la douleur et de
l’humeur dépressive (p = 0,001) ont été observées chez le groupe avec ACT à la fin du traitement,
ceci comparativement au groupe sans ACT.
Conclusion: Les résultats préliminaires suggèrent que l’ACT a été efficace pour réduire l’usage
d’opioïdes tout en diminuant l’interférence de la douleur et en améliorant l’humeur des patients.

Introduction

Public health concerns related to high-dose, long-term
opioid use for the treatment of persistent pain have
reached a fever pitch. These concerns are fueled by the
lack of evidence for the effectiveness of opioids in ade-
quately treating or alleviating many chronic pain
conditions,1 risks of harmful side effects,2 drug diversion
and illicit opioid use,3 addictions,4 and fatal overdoses.5 A
significant proportion of chronic pain and problematic
opioid use issues can be linked to the acute phase after
major surgery, when patients are commonly prescribed
opioid analgesics to manage their postsurgical pain.6,7
Most patients are provided little more than pharma-
cotherapy for pain after surgery and are generally offered
no intervention targeting the psychological vulnerability
factors that are associated with a greater probability of
pain chronicity, including pain catastrophizing,8 sensitiv-
ity to pain traumatization,9 anxiety and depressive
symptoms.10 In addition, although behavioral interven-
tions have been shown to reduce the impact of persistent
pain in terms of reducing pain interference (i.e., the
impact of pain on work, sleep, relationships, enjoyment
of life, etc.),11 postsurgical patients have not historically
been offered these interventions. Furthermore, they are
typically offered very little medical or behavioral guidance
to support opioid weaning,12 given the general expecta-
tion that postsurgical pain will resolve and pain medica-
tion use will naturally taper in parallel. However, between
5% and 70% of surgery patients develop chronic postsur-
gical pain (CPSP), depending in part upon the surgical
procedure.13 Moreover, 3% and 0.4% of previously
opioid-naïve patients continue to use opioids 3 months7
and 1 year after major surgery, respectively, likely due to
persistent postsurgical pain.6

be

combined with

Recent U.S. national guidelines for managing postsur-
gical pain have emphasized that opioids should not con-
stitute a stand-alone treatment for postoperative pain and
should
nonpharmacological
approaches to prevent long-term opioid use.12 Patients
taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a
benzodiazepine prior to surgery to treat depression or
anxiety have been identified as having the highest risk of
persisting on opioids following major surgery.6,14 The
combination of postsurgical pain, disability, and contin-
ued psychological symptoms can be overwhelming for
patients in the early recovery period. Thus, a concerted
effort must be made to address depression and anxiety in
the months after surgery because they have the potential
to amplify pain, pain interference, and opioid use.

The Toronto General Hospital has developed an
innovative Transitional Pain Service (TPS) that uses
multidisciplinary methods to prevent and manage

CPSP.15 The TPS provides physician-guided opioid
medication management and tapering, as well as
(e.g.,
opioid-sparing, nonopioid pharmacotherapy
for postsurgical neuropathic
alpha-2-delta ligands
pain). The TPS also offers behavioral
interventions
grounded in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(ACT) that are tailored to the postsurgical population
and address pain education, pain coping, pain interfer-
ence, and mood and anxiety concerns.16

reductions

ACT has garnered significant research support as an
effective behavioral chronic pain intervention in a rela-
tively short amount of time17,18 and has been rated as
having strong research support in the treatment of
the American
chronic pain by Division 12 of
Psychological Association.19 Systematic review has sug-
gested that ACT is particularly effective in terms of
reducing distress and improving functioning, particu-
larly physical functioning, in people living with long-
term pain.20 Acceptance-based interventions have also
been shown to reduce pain intensity21; however, there
are indications that acceptance-based interventions that
focus on mindfulness mediation training (e.g., mind-
fulness-based stress reduction) may be associated with
greater
in pain intensity than ACT
interventions.21,22 This is consistent with the theoretical
framework of ACT for the treatment of chronic pain,
which does not emphasize reductions in pain intensity
per se, because single-minded pursuit of pain relief is
considered ineffective and unworkable once pain has
become entrenched.18 Instead, ACT intervention is
focused on fostering committed engagement with
valued life activities, while promoting mindfulness
and acceptance of difficult private experiences, such as
pain. This is consistent with the sometimes controver-
sial perspective that multidisciplinary treatments for
chronic pain, including medication management, are
most effectively targeted at reducing pain-related dis-
tress
than reducing pain
rather
intensity.23 At the TPS, psychology services consist of
individual and group sessions of ACT led by a clinical
psychologist and supervised trainees who help patients
to develop behavioral skills that make pain more man-
ageable and thus support opioid tapering, so that
patients can achieve “a balance between the benefits
and potential harms of opioids” (p. 2098).23

and disability,

The TPS psychology service provides proactive,
timely support in a multidisciplinary setting to out-
patients with complex postsurgical pain for up to 6
months after surgery. TPS patients are flagged for pre-
surgical psychosocial or mental health problems,
chronic opioid use, and/or pre-existing chronic pain
in order to ensure that an intensive intervention is
provided to patients who are at the highest risk for

developing CPSP and persistent high-dose opioid use.15
To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-integrated,
long-term postsurgical pain manage-
comprehensive,
ment program of its kind. Thus, little data are available
on clinical outcomes of postsurgical patients who
receive psychological support to help them manage
complex and persistent postsurgical pain, opioid use,
and psychosocial symptoms.

We undertook analyses on preliminary data from
the TPS based on patients’ usage of psychological ser-
vices, specifically examining changes in pain, pain
interference, sensitivity to pain traumatization, pain
catastrophizing, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and
opioid use throughout the duration of their TPS treat-
ment. We hypothesized significant decreases in pain,
opioid use, pain interference, pain catastrophizing, sen-
sitivity to pain sensitization, and anxiety and depressive
symptoms in patients who received psychology services.
Given that TPS psychology services were provided to
patients with a high risk of developing CPSP and long-
term, high-dose opioid use, we also explored pain,
psychosocial outcomes, and opioid use in patients
who did not receive any psychology treatment to exam-
ine the extent of improvement between the two groups.

Methods

The study was reviewed and approved by the research
ethics boards of Toronto General Hospital (University
Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada) and York
University (Toronto, ON). All patients provided
informed written consent to participate.

Participants

Data were collected on 382 patients (194 male, 172
female, mean age = 51.96 years, SD = 14.4, range =
19–83 years) attending the TPS clinic between April
2014 and November 2016. Patients were referred to
the TPS by one of three care pathways: (1) referred
and followed prior to their surgery date due to risk
factors for postsurgical pain and followed as TPS out-
patients after surgery (n = 89, 23.30%); (2) referred by
the Acute Pain Service (APS) after surgery and followed
by the TPS as surgical inpatients, with continued care
as outpatients after hospital discharge (n = 155, 40.6%);
or (3) referred by surgeons or primary care physicians
to the TPS outpatient clinic when pain persisted after
postsurgical hospital discharge (n = 118, 30.89%). Two
postsurgical patients self-referred to the TPS. Overall,
364 patients attended the TPS clinic for post–hospital
discharge visits after major surgery (cardiac 11.1%;
thoracic 23.2%; ear, nose, and throat 13.1%; general

19.9%; transplant 8.1%; vascular 8.4%; other 10.4%).
Patients who attended the TPS and received treatment
for chronic pain unrelated to major surgery were
excluded from this study (n = 18).

Patients were referred to the TPS clinical psychologist
by a TPS physician or an APS nurse. Criteria for receiv-
ing psychology services included report of moderate-to-
severe acute postsurgical pain or persistent postsurgical
pain (≥4 on the 0–10 numeric rating scale for pain
intensity) or any one or more of the following: (1) pre-
existing chronic pain; (2) physician- or nurse-assessed
clinical depression, anxiety, and/or problematic opioid
use; (3) physician or nurse clinical judgment that the
patient was demonstrating marked difficulty coping
with postsurgical pain, compared to the average post-
surgical patient who has undergone an equivalent pro-
cedure; or 4) daily opioid use higher than expected and/
or persisting at high doses for longer than expected in
the postsurgical recovery period, with possible psycho-
logical barriers to opioid tapering. Because this was not a
controlled trial, referral criteria were not strictly opera-
tionalized but were based on clinical judgment.

Study groups

Patients who received one or more ACT intervention
sessions after postsurgical hospital discharge (n = 91)
were classified as belonging to the ACT group.
Postsurgical patients who did not receive any psychology
services were classified as belonging to the no ACT
group (n = 252). Twenty-one patients were assessed by
psychology services but did not elect to participate in
ACT sessions. These 21 patients were excluded from the
analyses in order to avoid confounding the study groups.

Psychology treatment—ACT intervention

All psychology sessions were provided by a registered clin-
ical psychologist (AZW) with 10 years of experience using
ACT and/or one of two supervised PhD-level clinical psy-
chology graduate students (MAA, LCB). Treatment was
primarily delivered in one-on-one sessions, with a minority
of patients attending a pilot series of group sessions. All
sessions followed an ACT treatment protocol designed to
reduce struggle against difficult inner experiences (such as
pain) while, at the same time, fostering long-term patterns
of behavior aimed at building a rich and rewarding life.24,25
The ACT approach to behavioral pain management was
taught to patients using a visual diagram called the ACT
matrix (Figure 1a).24 Patients were guided in using the
matrix to observe their internal reactions to pain; practice
awareness of avoidance behaviors (“away moves”) that aim
to control pain, including taking pain medication; and

40

engage in activities (represented in the “toward moves”
quadrant) that nurtured their connections with loved
ones and fulfilled their values (e.g. better health, strong
family ties, enjoyment of life; Figure 1b). During sessions,
patients were guided through brief mindfulness practices
that taught them a new way of cultivating present moment
awareness and non-reactivity to pain sensations, while
observing pain-related emotions and thoughts.26–28 They
were encouraged to practice mindfulness at home for 10
minutes per day. Each session lasted ~45 minutes and
consisted of a combination of ACT matrix and mindfulness
practices designed to provide new skills for coping with
persistent pain as patients tapered their opioids and worked
toward their desired level of activity.

Measures

Demographic and clinical health information (history of
diagnosed and treated mental health disorders, medica-
tion use, number of morbidities, history of chronic pain)
was collected by nurses in the surgical pre-admission
clinic as part of routine clinical care by (1) use of a
standardized pre-admission interview and (2) review of
the patient’s hospital-based electronic medical record.
Health information from the pre-admission visit note
was later abstracted from the electronic medical record
by the research team. Patients were asked to complete
questionnaire packages at pre-surgery, post-surgery in-
hospital, and post-hospital discharge outpatient TPS vis-
its. For the purposes of analyses, we used the first and last
post-hospital discharge outpatient questionnaire data.
The questionnaire package included the following
inventories.

perspective on their pain and their responses to pain and
developing awareness of their behavioral choices, in order to
build a life of meaning and purpose.

The Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form
The Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form (BPI-SF)29 is a
16-item scale that assesses current, least, average, and
worst pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS)
of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). It
contains seven pain interference subscales that measure
how pain interferes with various daily activities includ-
ing general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of
life, relations with others, and sleep. Patients rate each
aspect of pain interference using an 11-point NRS (0 =
does not interfere; 10 = interferes completely). Pain
interference is measured as a mean of the seven sub-
scales, with higher scores meaning that pain interferes
to a higher degree in the patient’s functioning. The pain
interference subscale has good internal consistency (α =
0.80) in clinical samples.30 Internal consistency of the
BPI-SF pain interference subscale for the present study
was 0.94.

Sensitivity to Pain Traumatization Scale–12
The Sensitivity to Pain Traumatization Scale–12 (SPTS-
12)31 is a 12-item, self-report scale that measures vul-
nerability to developing anxiety-related cognitive, emo-
tional, and behavioral reactions to pain that resemble
symptoms of a traumatic stress reaction (sample items:

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PAIN/REVUE CANADIENNE DE LA DOULEUR

41

“When I’m in pain, things don’t feel real”; “Pain sensa-
tions terrify me”; “When I’m in pain, everything I see
or do reminds me of the pain”; “When I’m in pain, I
feel distant from people even when I’m talking to
them”). Each item is rated on a five-point rating scale
using the following response options: 0 = not at all true;
1 = slightly true; 2 = somewhat true; 3 = very true; and 4
= entirely true. Total scores (sum of 12 items) range
from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating higher levels
of sensitivity to pain traumatization. The SPTS-12 has a
one-factor structure, good convergent and divergent
validity, and excellent internal consistency (0.84–0.92)
in community and clinical samples.31,32 The SPTS-12
predicts pain intensity and pain interference post–hos-
pital discharge in patients who have undergone major
surgery.33 Internal consistency of the SPTS-12 for the
present study was 0.92.

Pain Catastrophizing Scale
The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)34 is a 13-item scale
that measures catastrophic thinking in relation to pain.
Each item is rated on a five-point rating scale using the
following response options: 0 = not at all; 1 = to a slight
degree; 2 = to a moderate degree; 3 = to a great degree; and 4
= all the time. The PCS yields a total score and three
subscale scores assessing rumination (e.g., “I can’t seem
to keep it out of my mind”), magnification (e.g., “I wonder
whether something serious may happen”), and helplessness
(e.g., “There’s nothing I can do to reduce the intensity of
the pain”). The PCS has demonstrated good convergent
and divergent validity and excellent internal consistency (α
= 0.95) in a sample of chronic pain patients.35 Internal
consistency of the PCS for the present study was 0.96.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)36 is a
widely used 14-item scale that assesses symptoms of anxiety
(HADS-A; seven items) and depression (HADS-D; seven
items) among medical inpatients, outpatients, and in the
general population. For each item, the patient is asked to
select from among five possible responses (very often, quite
often, not very often, not at all) the one that best describes
how they have been feeling over the past week. Suggested
clinical cutoffs for the HADS are 8–10 for mild, 11–15 for
moderate, and ≥16 for severe depression or anxiety.37 The
HADS has demonstrated good internal consistency in clin-
ical samples (HADS-A; α = 0.76; HADS-D; α = 0.80).37
Internal consistencies of HADS-A and HADS-D for the
present study were 0.82 and 0.83, respectively.

Opioid use
The amount of opioids used in a 24-hour period was
recorded in the medical charts by TPS physicians at each

(including deviations

patient visit
from prescribed
amounts) and abstracted from the medical record. Opioid
use was calculated as total morphine equivalent dose
(MED) per 24 hours based upon the scientific literature38,39
and the conversion methods used by physicians and nurses
at UHN. Values obtained at the first and last outpatient
TPS visits for all outcomes were included in the analyses to
examine changes over the duration of TPS involvement.

Data analyses

Data were transformed when assumptions of normality
were not met, as was the case for MED (log trans-
formed), depressive symptoms (log transformed), and
pain catastrophizing (square root transformed).

Age was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Preoperative MED, number of weeks of TPS
attendance, number of medical visits, and number of
comorbidities were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis H
test with group (ACT, no ACT) as the independent vari-
able. Sex, preoperative chronic pain, preoperative opioid
use, preoperative mental health conditions, and preopera-
tive mental health medications were analyzed using
Pearson’s Chi-squared tests of likelihood followed by
inspection of standardized residuals within cells to deter-
mine the pattern of significance among cells. Separate Chi-
squared tests were used to examine differences in TPS
discharge opioid status (on opioids, opioid-free), between
ACT and no ACT groups according to preoperative opioid
status (opioid-naïve, opioid users). Clinical outcomes were
analyzed by two-way ANOVA using group (ACT, no ACT)
and time (first TPS visit, last TPS visit) as factors and
current pain, opioid use, pain interference, sensitivity to
pain traumatization, pain catastrophizing, anxiety symp-
toms, and depressive symptoms as dependant variables.
Significant interaction effects were followed by tests of
simple main effects. Partial eta-squared (η2
p) were used to
interpret effect sizes for two-way ANOVAs (small = 0.01,
medium = 0.06, large = 0.14).40 Wilk’s Lambda values (^)
were used to interpret the percent variance in dependent
variables not accounted for by independent variables.

Group characteristics

Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical variables for
the two groups of TPS participants. The ACT group
received a mean of 4.90 (SD = 6.46) sessions (median = 2,
range 1–33). Eighty patients received one-on-one sessions,
eight received both one-on-one and group sessions, and
three received only group sessions. ANOVA revealed a
significant main effect of group for age, F(1, 326) = 8.08, P

= 0.005, showing that the ACT group was significantly
younger than the no ACT group. Chi-square test indicated
a significant association between group and preoperative
mental health condition, χ2(1) = 17.38, P < 0.001:
Participants in the ACT group were significantly more
likely to have reported a mental health problem at their
pre-admission visit (e.g., a mood or anxiety disorder, post-
traumatic stress disorder, etc.) than those in the no ACT
group. Fifty percent of patients in the ACT group had been
taking medications such as SSRIs and anxiolytics preopera-
tively for mental health conditions compared to 28.5% in
the no ACT group. The Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that
there was a significant difference in duration (weeks) of TPS
involvement between groups, χ2(1) = 40.69, P < 0.001
(ACT: Q1 = 5.0, median = 17.5, Q3 = 30.75; no ACT: Q1
= 1.0, median = 2.0, Q3 = 11.57), and number of medical
visits, χ2(1) = 51.02, P < .001 (ACT: Q1 = 3, median = 7, Q3
= 10.50; no ACT: Q1 = 1.0, median = 2.0, Q3 = 3.0), with the
ACT group having greater weeks of involvement and num-
ber of medical visits with the TPS. Sex, number of comor-
bidities, preoperative chronic pain condition, preoperative
mental health medications, preoperative opioid use, and
preoperative MED did not differ significantly between the
groups. Data on numbers of ACT and no ACT group

patients using opioids at TPS discharge according to pre-
operative opioid use are presented in Table 2. Chi-squared

Discussion

This study reports on treatment outcomes for two
groups of postsurgical patients treated by a novel, multi-
disciplinary, transitional pain service in which one group
received an ACT-based behavioral pain management
intervention and the other did not. The results indicate
that both groups improved over the course of the study,
showing significant decreases in pain intensity, pain
interference, pain catastrophizing, anxiety symptoms,

needs for follow-up care over time, because their symp-
toms may have persisted or intensified over a longer
period after surgery requiring continued follow-up.
Findings of this study should be interpreted with caution
due to the inability to attribute symptom improvements
among patients in the ACT group mainly to the ACT
intervention, because these patients also received signifi-
cantly more physician-guided care.

It is important to note that these data were obtained
in the course of routine practice in the Transitional Pain
Service operating in a hospital setting, rather than in the
idealized and rigorously controlled conditions of a ran-
domized controlled trial
limit external validity.
that
Accordingly, the present findings should be generalizable
to real-world clinical care settings in many hospitals
around the globe in which patients have complex pain
histories, a variety of mental health conditions, and often
a history of presurgical, chronic opioid use. As an inves-
tigation of naturalistic clinical care, there were significant
differences between the two groups at baseline. Patients
who were referred to the ACT-based pain psychology
program had significantly higher daily opioid use at their
first TPS visit, as well as more anxiety, higher sensitivity
to pain traumatization scores, and a greater prevalence
of preoperative mental health conditions. Thus, the ACT
group was at higher risk of persistent pain, pain-related
disability, depression, and long-term, high-dose opioid
use.6,13,41 However, by the last TPS visit, daily opioid
consumption did not differ significantly between the
groups, suggesting that the ACT group was able to
taper their opioid use by a greater amount. In addition,
pain interference decreased to a greater extent in the
ACT group. Moreover, only the ACT group showed
significant reductions in depressive symptoms by the
last TPS visit. Taken together, the results suggest that a
higher-risk group of patients who learned the ACT
approach to behavioral pain management were able to
wean further off opioid medications, while experiencing
improvements in mood and less interference from pain
in important daily life activities, in comparison to the
lower-risk, no ACT group. The results of the present
study provide preliminary support for ACT-based inter-
vention targeting patients after surgery who are at risk of
CPSP and long-term, high-dose opioid use.

There is a dearth of research investigating the effi-
cacy of psychosocial treatments in reducing opioid use
among people living with chronic pain.42,43 Meanwhile,
concerns continue to rise with regard to the risks of
long-term, high-dose opioid use44 and dose escalation
triggered by postsurgical opioid prescribing practices
with little in the way of opioid tapering assistance.12
The present study provides preliminary evidence that
there is a potentially powerful role for behavioral

interventions in supporting opioid tapering among
complex pain patients who have undergone major sur-
gery. In addition to the ACT group’s greater mean
reductions in daily opioid consumption at TPS dis-
charge, a greater percentage of opioid-naïve ACT
group patients tapered their opioid use to zero in com-
parison to the no ACT group (Table 2). Preventing
opioid-naïve patients from becoming chronic opioid
users is an important objective in addressing the opioid
public health crisis.44 To this end, this finding supports
the promise of ACT being used in combination with
early multimodal medication management to prevent
new cases of chronic opioid use after surgery in patients
at high risk of persistent postsurgical pain. At the time
of TPS referral, patients in the ACT group were taking
high doses of opioid medication—well above the 90 mg
MED maximum upper limit recommended by the 2017
Canadian guideline for opioids for chronic non-cancer
pain.45 To change this clinical picture and bring opioid
dosing for “legacy patients” in line with current guide-
lines, empirically supported behavioral protocols are
urgently needed to assist patients in tapering their
opioid medications,16 without a negative impact on
functional status or quality of life.

There is a debate among health care professionals
who treat people with chronic pain as to the importance
of reduced pain intensity as an outcome of multidisci-
plinary treatment. The present results indicate that both
groups showed significant reductions in pain—with the
ACT group decreasing by 17% and the no ACT group
by 8%—although the magnitude of
the difference
between groups was not
significant.
Nonetheless, the mean reductions in pain intensity of
the ACT group fell within the 10%–20% range consid-
ered to reflect minimally important changes on the 0–10
pain NRS.46 Taken together with the ACT group’s
reductions in pain interference, this finding is consistent
with the literature on ACT interventions that have led to
improved functioning in the absence of significant
between-group differences in pain intensity.47–49

statistically

Surgical patients who are highly distressed and
anxious are more likely to develop persistent post-
surgical pain13,50
and to use higher doses of
opioids.6 The ACT intervention demonstrated dif-
ferential effects on the various psychological con-
structs of anxiety and distress assessed across the
treatment period. Anxiety and pain catastrophizing
decreased in both groups over time but did not
decrease more dramatically in the ACT group.
Anxiety and catastrophizing may have resolved as
time passed, postsurgical healing progressed, and
pain decreased in both groups. To date, there has
been little investigation on behavioral interventions

to reduce postsurgical pain catastrophizing, though
a recent uncontrolled pilot study of a single-session
pain psychology class specifically tailored for pain
catastrophizing has shown large treatment effects in
reducing catastrophizing in chronic pain outpatients
after 4 weeks.51 It is possible that pain catastrophiz-
ing reductions would have been greater in the ACT
group compared to the no ACT group had the
intervention focused more on changing cognitive
reactions to postsurgical pain. However, the ACT
intervention placed more emphasis on awareness of
pain-related cognitions, while reducing their impact
on behavior, as reflected in greater reductions in
pain interference in the ACT group. In terms of
sensitivity to pain traumatization, this was higher
in the ACT group at both time points. This is a
newer construct
in pain psychology, and it may
take time to elucidate its importance in predicting
clinical outcomes, as well as how best to target it via
behavioral interventions. Finally, depression scores
improved in the ACT group but not in the no ACT
group, despite the fact that many patients are pre-
scribed serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibi-
tors

atypical
adjunct, opioid-sparing medications for postsurgical
neuropathic pain, though perhaps not at adequate
doses for mood effects. The behavioral activation
component of the ACT matrix intervention, which
emphasizes engaging in meaningful activities,
is
designed to alleviate depression at the same time
that functioning improves.

Limitations and future directions

There are several limitations to the present study. First,
this research was observational in nature without ran-
dom assignment to treatment groups; thus, our results
may be subject to confounding by treatment indication.
However, as described above, the ACT group was more
severe with respect to risk factors for postsurgical pain
at baseline and thus would be expected to have poorer
outcomes—that is, the selection bias observed in the
present study would bias our analyses toward the null
hypothesis of no difference in outcomes between
groups or better outcomes for the no ACT group. The
fact that we nonetheless observed decreases in pain,
pain interference, pain catastrophizing, anxiety symp-
toms, and opioid use with outcomes comparable in
both the ACT and no ACT group suggests that the
strength of effect of the ACT intervention outweighed
confounding in the opposite direction. Of particular
note, our findings that the ACT group demonstrated
greater reductions in depression scores, opioid use, and

pain interference than the no ACT group speak to the
strength of the ACT intervention.

Another limitation of the present study is that our
relatively small sample size precluded full multivariate
adjustment and reduced our power to detect underlying
treatment effects. If we had sufficient power to control for
higher rates of perioperative risk factors for CPSP (such as
preexistent chronic pain)13 and long-term presurgical
opioid use, we may have observed greater effect sizes
and additional significant effects of psychological treat-
ment on reducing poor postsurgical outcomes.

The patients in this study underwent a heterogenous
set of surgical interventions typical of hospital settings,
which may limit the precision of our findings. Different
surgical modalities are known to yield different rates of
CPSP13 and extended opioid use.6 Due to small numbers
of individuals with each surgery, we lacked sufficient
power to run subgroup analyses of differential responses
to psychological intervention and TPS treatment overall.
Furthermore, heterogeneity of surgical intervention con-
tributes to reduced power to detect potentially real treat-
ment effects and accordingly we are planning randomized
controlled trials with intent-to-treat analyses within a
given high-risk surgical population.

Finally, all follow-up comparisons were based on
group differences at the conclusion of TPS visits, a clini-
cally relevant time point where specialist treatment is
discontinued and patients are transitioned back to their
primary care physicians. A drawback of this approach is
that differences in treatment duration observed between
the ACT and no ACT groups represent a confounding
variable in this study. Thus, the extent to which the no
ACT group would have achieved additional reductions in
opioid weaning, pain interference, and depressive symp-
tomology given an equivalent follow-up time is not
known. It is also not known whether participation in the
ACT treatment protocol increased patient engagement
with the service, leading to an increased willingness to
attend additional appointments, or whether distressed,
yet adherent, patients were more drawn to the option of
ACT treatment.

To address these limitations, we aim to run addi-
tional analyses with an increased sample size, allowing
sufficient power for multivariate adjustment for con-
founding by indication, follow-up duration, and sur-
gery type subgroups.

Conclusion

This study reports promising preliminary outcomes
from a multidisciplinary transitional pain service that
addresses a substantial gap in treatment for patients
who have undergone major surgery and are at high

risk of developing CPSP and prolonged, high-dose
opioid use. The Transitional Pain Service bridges the
gap between in-hospital, acute postsurgical pain manage-
ment and specialized care for chronic pain that is often
long delayed and difficult to access. Patients presenting
with complex pain problems after surgery receive timely,
state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary intervention that pro-
vides them with a full repertoire of options for managing
their pain in order to reduce reliance on opioid medica-
tion. Patients living with pain after surgery understand-
ably want pain relief and need assurance that tapering
their opioid medication will not result in more pain,
disability, and suffering. The Transitional Pain Service
model aims to address these issues in the critical post-
surgical period, as part of a new generation of solutions
for pain management that address the current public
health challenges associated with pain-related high-
dose, long-term opioid use.
