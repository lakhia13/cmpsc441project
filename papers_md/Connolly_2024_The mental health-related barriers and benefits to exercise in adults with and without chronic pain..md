Background: Qualitative evidence points to the importance of both mental health-related barriers and benefits to 
exercise in chronic pain, yet this bidirectional relationship has not been established quantitatively. 
Methods: 89 adults with chronic pain (75 female, Age: M = 34.7, SD=13.2), and 89 demographically-matched 
individuals without chronic pain (73 female, Age: M = 32.0, SD=13.3) self-reported demographic and health 
information, mental health-related barriers and benefits to exercise, and leisure-time exercise activity. 
Results: Adults with chronic pain had significantly higher scores on mental health-related barriers to exercise, and 
lower leisure-time exercise participation than adults without chronic pain. The groups did not differ on mental 
health-related benefits of exercise scores. Benefits scores positively predicted exercise, yet there was a significant 
negative interaction between pain and benefit scores, indicating a weaker positive relationship between benefits 
and  exercise  for  adults  with  chronic  pain  than  for  those  without  chronic  pain.  Barrier  scores  significantly 
negatively predicted exercise engagement, but did not interact significantly with chronic pain. 
Conclusion: Mental health-related barriers and benefits to exercise are important considerations when prescribing 
exercise for adults with chronic pain. Adults with chronic pain may require individualised support to address 
mental health-related barriers to leisure-time exercise.   

Introduction 

Chronic pain disorders are highly common, affecting approximately 
21 % of the population worldwide in any given year (Cieza et al., 2020). 
Chronic pain is defined as persistent pain lasting longer than 12 weeks, 
and can be due to specific pathophysiology (e.g., arthritic or rheumatic 
conditions, connective tissue disorders), or can be idiopathic, requiring 
patient  report  for  diagnosis  (e.g.,  fibromyalgia,  chronic  widespread 
pain, non-specific low back pain) (Ambrose & Golightly, 2015). 

personal  enjoyment  or  improved  health  outcomes  (Caspersen  et  al., 
1985). Despite the benefits of exercise for chronic pain, one large-scale 
study of 4839 individuals with chronic pain found that approximately 
23 % of respondents felt unable to exercise, and a further 50 % felt less 
able to exercise since pain onset (Breivik et al., 2006). Thus, the uptake 
and adherence of exercise may prove difficult. But it is unclear whether 
it is solely pain which may inhibit exercise, or if co-occurring factors 
such  as  affective  symptoms,  including  anxiety  and  depression  also 
contribute. 

Exercise is the gold standard treatment for chronic pain, given its low 
cost, overall safety, and efficacy for treating pain (Geneen et al., 2017; 
Shipton,  2018).  Exercise  is  here  defined  as  effortful  and  planned 
movement  or  physical  activity,  completed  in  leisure-time,  for  either 

Given the high comorbidity rates between chronic pain and depres-
sion and anxiety (Gureje et al., 2008a), treatment courses should address 
both  physical  and  mental  health  presentations,  including  individual’s 
perceived  barriers  and  benefits  to  leisure  time  exercise.  Mental

leisure-time  exercise  of: 

Evidence of mental health-related barriers and benefits to exercise in 
chronic  pain  is  currently  limited  to  qualitative  research,  where  in-
dividuals  with  chronic  pain  have  reported  the  mental  health-specific 
benefits 
in  self- 
confidence, overall motivation, enjoyment, improved sleep, and cogni-
tion, as well as decreases in exercise-related anxiety (Dnes et al., 2020; 
Joelsson et al., 2017; Vader et al., 2019). Mental health-related barriers 
reported by participants with chronic pain include low motivation, fear 
of injury or future pain (separate to current pain), low self-efficacy for 
exercise,  fatigue,  poor  self-image,  low  mood,  high  anxiety,  and 
perceived lack of exercise knowledge (Dnes et al., 2020; Joelsson et al., 
2017; Vader et al., 2019). In the general population, scores of anxiety 
and 
predicted  mental 
health-related  barriers  to  exercise.  Furthermore,  leisure-time  exercise 
participation  was  positively  predicted  by  the  benefits  scores,  and 
negatively predicted by the barriers scores [8]. However, the predictive 
patterns  of  mental  health-related  barriers  and  benefits  to  exercise  for 
individuals with chronic pain are unclear. 

depression-like 

symptoms 

positively 

We therefore aim to determine whether mental health-related bar-
riers and benefits differentially predict leisure-time exercise participa-
tion between groups of individuals with chronic pain and those without. 
We hypothesise the following:  

1.  Individuals  with  chronic  pain  will  report  higher  levels  of  mental 
health-related  barriers  and  lower  levels  of  mental  health-related 
benefits of exercise than those without chronic pain;  

2.  The  mental  health-related  barrier  scores  will  negatively  predict 
leisure-time exercise engagement more strongly for individuals with 
chronic pain than those without chronic pain;  

3.  The  mental  health-related  benefit  scores  will  positively  predict 
leisure-time  exercise  participation  more  strongly  for  individuals 
without chronic pain than for individuals with chronic pain. 

Method 

Participants 

The  present  dataset  (total  n  = 178)  comprises  two  groups:  1)  a 
chronic pain group (n = 89), and 2) a demographically matched group of 
individuals without chronic pain (n = 89). The study was advertised via 
social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn), online stu-
dent noticeboards, and by email from physiotherapy and allied health 
clinics. The study was primarily advertised toward individuals residing 
in Australia, however, individuals residing overseas were also eligible. 
The recruitment of participants with chronic pain was completed first, 
allowing  for  follow-up  advertisements  to  target  particular  age  and 
gender demographics of individuals without chronic pain, for a balanced 
design. Overall sample size was determined by power analysis for a two- 
tailed student’s t-tests with a conservative estimated effect size of d =
0.65, with p = .001 (see Giesecke et al., 2005 for comparison between 
chronic  pain  and  healthy  controls  on  depressive  scores).  The  power 
analysis gave a minimum sample size of 85 participants per group. After 
the recruitment of 89 adults with chronic pain, a stopping point of 89 
adults without chronic pain was implemented for recruitment. 

Participants were eligible based on the following inclusion criteria: 
1)  aged  18–75;  2)  no  reported history  of  severe  mental illness;  3)  no 
physical disability that impacts > 50 % of daily function. The chronic 
pain sample had additional inclusion criteria of i) self-reported muscu-
loskeletal pain lasting over 3 months. Individuals who reported pain for 
a period of less than 3 months were excluded. Demographic information 
is presented in Results. 

Procedure 

Participants completed a short online questionnaire via the online 
survey management site Qualtrics to assess eligibility. Upon completion 
of the short survey, all participants were eligible to enter a draw for 1 of 
5 gift card vouchers of $25AU. If eligible, participants were redirected to 
a second Qualtrics webpage, which contained a longer set of question-
naires  to  assess  the  psychological  symptoms,  pain,  and  exercise  mea-
sures of interest. Upon completion of the total battery, participants were 
eligible to enter the draw for 1 of 10 gift card vouchers of $50AU. 

Measures 

The Mental health-related barriers and benefits to EXercise scale (MEX) 
(Connolly  et  al.,  2023).  The  MEX  is  a  30-item  scale  (15  benefits  of 
leisure-time exercise, 15 barriers to leisure-time exercise engagement) 
designed to assess the extent to which common transdiagnostic mental 
health symptoms can be alleviated with leisure-time exercise (benefits), 
and  the  extent  to  which  such  symptoms  can  hinder  the  practice  of 
leisure-time  exercise  (barriers).  A  further  two  items  were  included  in 
analysis: ‘benefit facilitation’  and ‘barrier interference’, in which par-
ticipants were asked to rate the extent to which the benefits on the MEX 
scale facilitated exercise, and the barriers on the MEX scale interfered 
negatively with exercise. 

Depression, Anxiety, and  Stress  Scales (DASS-42) (Lovibond  &  Lovi-
bond,  1995).  The  DASS-42  is  a  42-item  scale  designed  to  measure 
depression, anxiety and stress on a continuum (Lovibond & Lovibond, 
1995).  This  measure  was  chosen  due  to  its  well-established  psycho-
metric properties (Page et al., 2007), and its utility in both research and 
clinical settings. 

Subjective activity and fitness: Participants were presented with two 
questions regarding their evaluation of their current levels of physical 
activity (on a four-point scale of ‘I am very physically active’ to ‘I am not 
active at all’), and fitness (on a four-point scale of ‘I am very fit’ to ‘I am 
very  unfit’).  Participants  were  also  asked  a  further  two  questions  to 
ascertain an evaluation of self-comparisons with peers of their own age 
in terms of physical activity (on a five-point scale of ‘I am much more 
active  than  the  average  person’,  to  ‘I  am  much  less  active  than  the 
average person) and fitness (on a five-point scale of ‘I am much more fit 
than the average person’, to ‘I am much less fit than the average person). 
Questions  on  subjective  activity  and  fitness  were  chosen  as  previous 
research  indicates  a  negative  association  between  mental  health  and 
subjective activity, where associations may not be present with mental 
health  scores  and  recalled  physical  activity  in  metabolic  equivalents 
(Baceviciene et al., 2019; Lang et al., 2019). 

The McGill pain questionnaire - Short form (The  MPQ-SF) (Melzack, 
1975). The MPQ-SF is a 22-item questionnaire to assess the strength and 
type of pain. Perceptions of pain are described by 22 short descriptions 
(e.g.,  ‘throbbing  pain’  or  ‘aching  pain’).  The  participant  rates  their 
current levels of each of the 22 pain types from 0 to 10, where 0 corre-
sponds to no pain, and 10 corresponds to ‘worst possible pain’ (Melzack, 
1975). This scale was selected due to its simplicity in administration, 
and its established psychometric properties. 

The  Habitual  Physical  Activity  Questionnaire  -  Leisure-time  Exercise 
Score (Baecke et al., 1982). The habitual physical activity questionnaire 
is  a  three-factor  questionnaire  designed  to  capture  habitual  physical 
activity across three domains: 1) activity at work, 2) sport and exercise 
activity  in  leisure  time  (referred  to  here  as  the  Leisure-time  Exercise 
Score),  and  3)  other  leisure-time  physical  activity  (e.g.  incidental 
walking  in  leisure  time,  transport-related  activity,  and  general  inac-
tivity).  The  present  study  uses  only  the  second  domain  in  analysis, 
deriving  the  leisure-time  exercise  score  as  an  index  of  intentional 
leisure-time  sport  and  exercise  participation.  Within  the  leisure-time 
sport  and  exercise  component,  the  first  question  asked  participants 
whether or not they participated in regular leisure-time sport or exer-
cise.  If  ‘yes’,  participants  were  then  asked  to  list  up  to  two  activities

which they participated in most frequently on a regular basis. The two 
activities  could be either sports (e.g. tennis, football) and/or types of 
exercise (e.g. gym-based exercise, running, yoga). Participants were also 
asked for an estimation of their regular time spent participating in each 
activity, and the intensity of the activity. The resulting leisure-time sport 
and  exercise  index  is  scored  from  0  to  4,  where  0  corresponds  to  no 
leisure-time  exercise  participation,  1  corresponds  to  a  low  level  of 
low-intensity  activity  in  leisure  time,  and  4  corresponds  to  a  high 
amount of high-intensity activity in leisure-time. 

Pain Management and Exercise Prescription: Individuals with chronic 
pain were asked a single-item binary question of whether or not they 
take  pharmaceutical  medication  for  their  pain.  All  participants  were 
asked  whether  they  had  been  prescribed  exercise  by  a  health  profes-
sional  in  the  previous  three  months;  whether  this  prescription  was 
specific  or  general,  and  which  type  of  health  professional  prescribed 
their  exercise(s)  (e.g.,  physiotherapist,  exercise  physiologist,  general 
practitioner).  Examples  of  specific  and  general  exercise  prescriptions 
were  given  to  participants.  The  examples  of  specific  exercise  pre-
scriptions from healthcare providers were: "do 10 reps of squats for 3 
sets, twice a week", "go for a walk for half an hour per day", or a full 
exercise  routine  to  do  a  set  number  of  times  per  week.  The  example 
given of a general exercise prescription from a healthcare provider was: 
"you should get some more exercise". 

Results 

Demographics 

There were no significant differences between groups at the a = 0.05 
level on any of the collected demographic information. All descriptive 
statistics and group difference calculations are shown below in Table 1. 
Additional information was collected regarding chronic pain char-
acteristics for the chronic pain sample and are presented in Appendix A: 
Table A1, including self-reported diagnoses. Information about exercise 
prescriptions for both samples was also collected and presented in Ap-
pendix  A:  Table  A2.  Participants’  self-reported  diagnoses  were  also 
recategorized by the authors in terms of the International Classification 
of Diseases - 11 (ICD-11) categories of chronic pain diagnoses (Treede 
et al., 2015), as reported in Appendix A: Table A1. 

Group differences on affect, pain, exercise and activity levels, and mental 
health-related barriers and benefits to exercise 

The  differences  between  the  groups  on  all  experimental  measures 
can  be  seen  below  in  Table  2.  Significance  was  adjusted  for  multiple 
comparisons; the Bonferroni-corrected value of p = .005 was determined 
equivalent to nominal a = 0.05. Although some heterogeneity of vari-
ance was observed on MPQ scores, t-tests are typically robust to such 
assumption  violations  when  sample  sizes  are  equal  between  groups 
(Rasch, Teuscher & Guiard, 2007). Differences were observed between 
groups  on  mental  health-related  barriers  to  exercise,  the  amount  to 
which endorsed mental health-related barriers interfered with exercise 
(barrier interference), pain, depression, anxiety, stress, and leisure-time 
exercise scores. However, there was no statistically significant difference 
between  groups  on  subjective  activity  scores,  mental  health-related 
benefits  to  exercise,  nor  the  amount  to  which  the  endorsed  mental 
health-related benefits facilitated exercise (benefit facilitation).

pain management pharmaceuticals by a health professional (yes: n = 33; 
no: n = 56). Mean differences were compared between the binary sub-
groupings  of  the  chronic  pain  sample,  on  the  key  variables  of  MEX  - 
benefits, MEX - barriers, the MPQ, DASS - depression, DASS - anxiety, 
DASS  -  stress,  leisure-time  exercise  scores,  and  subjective  activity. 
Spearman’s rank-ordered correlation was used to analyse the associa-
tion between the number of pain sites and the key variables, due to the 
nature of the ordinal data. Per the large number of analyses, significance 
for  each  of  the  24  t-tests  was  considered  at  the  bonferroni-corrected 
value of p<.002. 

The number of pain sites was not significantly correlated with any of 
MEX  -  benefits,  MEX  -  barriers,  the  MPQ,  DASS  -  depression,  DASS  - 
anxiety, DASS - stress, leisure-time exercise scores, and subjective ac-
tivity. Further, there were no significant differences at the a = 0.01 level 
on any of the key variable outcomes between any of the three binary 
indicator groupings (1. Whether or not exercise was prescribed; 2. type 
of  exercise  prescription:  general  or  specific;  3.  Whether  or  not  pain 
management pharmaceuticals were prescribed). A table of chronic pain- 
specific analysis results is presented in Appendix B, Table B1. 

Additionally,  participants  with  chronic  pain  were  further  grouped 
based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the World 
Health  Organization  (WHO),  the  ICD-11  chronic  pain  diagnostic 
nomenclature  (Treede  et  al.,  2015).  Of  the  89  total  participants  with 
chronic  pain,  76 participants  had  chronic  pain  diagnoses  which  were 
categorised under only one of the following parent chronic pain entities: 
musculoskeletal  (n  = 36),  neurological  (n  = 2),  primary  (n  = 22), 
post-surgical or post-traumatic (n = 10), or visceral (n = 6). The other 13 
participants  had  diagnoses  with  multiple  parent  entities:  i)  musculo-
skeletal and post-surgical or post-traumatic (n = 5), ii) musculoskeletal 
and  neurological  (n  = 2),  iii)  musculoskeletal  and  head  (n  = 2),  iv) 
musculoskeletal and visceral (n = 1), v) neurological and head (n = 1), 
vi) primary and head (n = 3), and vii) post-traumatic and visceral (n =
1). Eight separate One-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were per-
formed using the ICD-11 based chronic pain groupings (excluding the 
neurological chronic pain group due to the small sample size of n = 2) on 

each of the key outcome variables of MEX - benefits, MEX - barriers, the 
MPQ,  DASS  -  depression,  DASS  -  anxiety,  DASS  -  stress,  leisure-time 
exercise scores, and subjective activity. No significant differences were 
found across ICD-11 chronic pain type groups on any of the eight vari-
ables. A table of ICD-11 chronic pain type ANOVA results, along with the 
means and standard deviations for each group on each key variable, is 
presented in Appendix B, Table B2. 

Linear regression models predicting reported leisure-time exercise 
participation 

To specify which variables from the collected data were significant 
predictors  of  leisure-time  exercise  for  each  sample,  simple  regression 
analyses were conducted with each continuous variable as single pre-
dictors separately for the chronic pain and the general population group

(see  Table  3).  Simple  regression  analyses  were  completed  using  vari-
ables theorised to either predict or be covariates of leisure-time exercise, 
in light of the significant difference in leisure-time exercise scores be-
tween groups. The simple regression analyses were conducted to allow 
for clearer comparison with multiple regression analyses to follow. Due 
to the large number of analyses, significance for each of the 24 simple 
regression models was considered at the bonferroni-corrected value of 
p< .002. Leisure-time exercise scores were significantly predicted by the 
following variables in both samples: MEX - mental health-related bar-
riers to engagement, Subjective Activity and Fitness Scores, and MEX - 
interference of barriers on exercise. Although the variables MEX - ben-
efits and MEX - facilitation of MEX benefits on exercise were both sig-
nificant  predictors  of  leisure-time  exercise  for  the  general  population 
control sample, they were not significant predictors of leisure-time ex-
ercise  for  the  chronic  pain  sample.  The  following  variables  were  not 
significant predictors of leisure-time exercise scores in simple regression 
in neither the chronic pain nor the general population control samples: 
MPQ  -  total  current  pain  scores,  DASS  -  Depression,  DASS  -  Anxiety, 
DASS - Stress, age, education levels, nor income levels. 

Forward entry stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed 
including  the  entire  sample  (n  = 188),  but  using  the  chronic  pain 
grouping  as  a  secondary  independent  variable,  to  account  for  any 
interaction  effects  between  the  mental  health-related  benefits  and 
experience  of  chronic  pain  in  the  prediction  of  leisure-time  exercise 
scores  in  model  1,  or  between  the  mental  health-related  barriers  and 
chronic pain in the prediction of leisure-time exercise scores in model 2. 
Results  of  the  best  fitting  models  for  predicting  leisure-time  exercise 
scores from benefits, group, and the interaction of benefits and group are 
presented below in Table 4, as Model 1. Model 1 was significant overall, 
and  included  a  significant  negative  interaction  between  the  benefits 
score and group, with  the benefits score as a  significant positive pre-
dictor  within  the  model.  However,  group  alone  was  not  statistically 
significant  as  a  predictor  of  leisure-time  exercise  scores  within  the 
model.  The  results  from  the  model  predicting  leisure-time  exercise 
scores  from  barriers  and  chronic  pain  with  an  interaction  term  are 
presented below in Table 4, as Model 2. Model 2 was significant overall, 
however, only the barriers score was significant as a predictor of leisure- 
time  exercise  scores  within  this  model.  Group  was  not  a  significant 
predictor of leisure-time exercise scores within this model, nor was the 
interaction  term  between  pain  grouping  and  barrier  scores.  In  both

Discussion 

The current study aimed to quantify differences between individuals 
reporting chronic pain to a demographically-matched sample of those 
without chronic pain on mental health-related barriers and benefits to 
leisure  time  exercise.  Individuals  with  chronic  pain  reported  signifi-
cantly higher levels of perceived mental health-related barriers to lei-
sure time exercise than those without chronic pain. Those with chronic 
pain also reported higher interference  from the mental health-related 
barriers  for  leisure  time  exercise  than  those  without  chronic  pain. 
There  was,  however,  no  significant  difference  between  the  groups on 
perceived mental health-related benefits to exercise or perceived facil-
itation of exercise from the mental health-related benefits to exercise. 
Additionally,  and  in  line  with  previous  quantitative  evidence  (Gureje 
et  al.,  2008b),  the  individuals  with  chronic  pain  reported  higher 
anxiety-like, depression-like symptoms, and self reported stress levels, 
and lower scores on leisure-time exercise participation as well as sub-
jective activity levels, compared to individuals without chronic pain. 

Interestingly, individuals with chronic pain reported similarly high 
levels  of  mental  health-related  benefits  to  exercise  as  those  without 
chronic  pain.  Yet,  a  multiple  regression  model  showed  that  mental 
health-related  benefits  more  strongly  predicted  exercise  participation 
for those without chronic pain than for those with chronic pain. Thus, 
seemingly, unique aspects of the chronic pain experience may include 
barriers to exercise that may supersede the experience of mental health- 
related benefits to exercise. This finding corresponds to evidence from 
qualitative  research,  showing  that  although  individuals  with  chronic 
pain may understand and recognize the benefits of exercise - both for 
their chronic pain condition and for their mental health - participating in 
exercise remains challenging due to barriers to exercise such as fear of 
pain with movement, lack of motivation and lack of support and access 
(Vader et al., 2019). Accordingly, in another multiple regression model 
from our  dataset,  there  was  no interaction  between  chronic  pain  and 
barriers to exercise in the prediction of exercise participation, with re-
sults  for  both  groups  indicating  that  the  more  mental  health-related 
barriers reported by participants, the lower the rate of exercise partici-
pation. Yet, importantly, in this cross-sectional analysis the individuals 
with  chronic  pain  had  significantly  higher 
levels  of  mental 
health-related barriers than those without chronic pain. Thus, the im-
plications  of  both  mental  health-related  benefits  and  mental 
health-related barriers to exercise for individuals with chronic pain may 
be essential to review clinically in the prescription of exercise treatment 
and rehabilitation. 

For clinical settings, the findings of the current study suggest that 
psychoeducation surrounding the mental health-related benefits of ex-
ercise is valuable where appropriate to increase exercise motivation, and 
remains a viable option for individuals with and without chronic pain. 
Given  the  delicate  interplay  between  chronic  pain  and  mental  health 
barriers and benefits to exercise, the results of the present study support 
the notion of a holistic approach to pain management. Present results 
indicate that physical therapists and exercise professionals involved in 
the rehabilitation of chronic pain should be psychologically informed of 
the  increased  level  of  mental  health-related  barriers  to  exercise  in 
chronic pain, and the potentially decreased influence of mental health- 
related  benefits  to  exercise  in  chronic  pain.  The  contemporary  pain 
clinic  model,  which  includes  pain  and  exercise  specialists,  as  well  as 
clinical  psychologists  (Bell,  2015),  also  has  the  possibility  to  provide

holistic  care  with  recognition  of the  mental  health-related  barriers  to 
exercise for individuals with chronic pain, and to support clients indi-
vidually to overcome such barriers, and identify meaningful and indi-
vidualised  benefits.  Indeed,  future  clinical  trials  will  be  necessary  for 
investigating  the  ongoing  role  of  barriers  and  benefits  to  exercise  in 
chronic pain rehabilitation. 

The primary strength  of this study is that this is the first study  to 
quantitatively model the mental health-related barriers and benefits to 
exercise in individuals with chronic pain and compare these barriers and 
benefits to individuals without chronic pain. The present study adds to 
an existing body of qualitative research on barriers and benefits to ex-
ercise in chronic pain (Dnes et al., 2020; Joelsson et al., 2017; Vader 
et al., 2019) by using quantitative methods to predict exercise partici-
pation  from mental health-related barriers and benefits to exercise in 
individuals with and without chronic pain. Furthermore, using a vali-
dated mental health-related barriers and benefits scale lends credence to 
the  generalizability  of  results,  and  allows  for  further  replicability 
(Connolly et al., 2023). 

The  present  study  has  limitations  which  warrant  consideration. 
Firstly and most importantly, the study focused solely on mental health- 
related barriers and benefits to leisure time exercise. Whilst the area of 
mental  health-related  barriers  and  benefits  to  exercise  is  particularly 
understudied,  the  narrowed  scope  of  the  present  research  may  have 
missed quantifying other important benefits and barriers to exercise that 
may be unique to the experience of chronic pain, for example, lack of 
social support, or lack of access to facilities (Vader et al., 2019). Sec-
ondly, the sampling of two groups of only 89 participants each limited 
statistical  power  when  modelling  covariates  in  the  prediction  of 
leisure-time exercise participation. Further, the final two models chosen 
to represent the data were optimised to each only include two predictor 
variables (i. Group, and ii. either the mental health-related benefits or 
barriers to exercise) and an interaction term each, to allow for increased 
statistical power. Future research in this area with larger sample sizes 
may  seek  to  increase  explanatory  power  by  using  further  predictor 
variables  to  account  for  the  complexities  of  the  pain-affect-exercise 

relationship.  The  small  sample  size  also  potentially  limited  statistical 
power in analysing differences in experimental outcomes by subgroups 
of chronic pain participants based on pain-specific characteristics (e.g., 
ICD-11  chronic pain subtypes, prescriptions  of exercise or  pain medi-
cation). It remains unclear from the present analysis whether null results 
found  on  all  experimental  outcomes  by  all  chronic  pain  subgroups 
simply reflect overall commonalities across chronic pain characteristics, 
or if such results are due to the small sample sizes occurring as a function 
of subgrouping only 89 participants on various characteristics. The na-
ture of the study design using convenience sampling does unfortunately 
limit  interpretation  of  results  also.  Future  research  may  benefit  from 
clinical  recruitment  for  adults  with  chronic  pain. Finally,  comparison 
was limited to a cross-sectional design of individuals with chronic pain 
diagnoses and to individuals without chronic pain in the general pop-
ulation, thus  potential differential  levels, effects,  and determinants  of 
mental health-related barriers and benefits to exercise between chronic 
pain and clinical anxiety or depression are yet to be established. 

The present study has provided evidence of differences between in-
dividuals with chronic pain and those without in terms of their mental 
health-related  barriers  and  benefits  to  leisure  time  exercise,  and  po-
tential  implications  for  leisure-time  exercise  participation.  The  rela-
tionship between benefits and exercise was stronger for the individuals 
without chronic pain than for those with chronic pain, and higher levels 
of barriers were reported by individuals with chronic pain compared to 
individuals without chronic pain. Identifying and addressing the mental 
health-related barriers and benefits to exercise in chronic pain may be 
critical  in  the  successful  prescription  of  exercise  for  individuals  with 
chronic pain.
