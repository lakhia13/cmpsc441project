## What is anxiety?


Feeling anxious is a normal part of life. Many people worry about things such as health, money, school, work, or family. But anxiety disorders involve more than occasional worry or fear. For people with these disorders, anxiety does not go away, is felt in many situations, and can get worse over time.

There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

- Generalized anxiety disorder

- Social anxiety disorder

- Various phobia-related disorders

## Why is NIMH studying anxiety disorders?


Abouta third of U.S. adolescents and adults experience an anxiety disorderat some point in their lives. Anxiety disorder symptoms can interfere with daily life and routine activities, such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships. In severe cases, a person might feel intense fear in common situations, avoid social encounters, or refuse to leave their home.


## How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?


NIMH conducts and funds research to examine environmental and genetic factors that contribute to anxiety disorders. These include studies comparing brain development and biology among people with and without anxiety disorders. Our supported research also focuses on family and other environmental factors that may influence the risk for anxiety disorders in infants, children, adolescents, and adults.

NIMH-supported research is examining rates and symptoms of anxiety disorders after major life events like pregnancy or after trauma or illness. Of particular interest are predictors and symptoms of anxiety disorders among youth, including during the college transition and in relation to social media use.

Additionally, NIMH supports research on interventions and treatments for different types of anxiety disorders. We’re supporting studies that explore the overlap of anxiety with other disorders, such as depression and eating disorders, as well as how anxiety symptoms, severity, and treatment needs change with age.
