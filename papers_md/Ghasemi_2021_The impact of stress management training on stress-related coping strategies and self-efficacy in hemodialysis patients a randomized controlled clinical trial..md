Abstract 
Introduction:  Dialysis causes many psychological and social problems, such as stress and inefficiency in patients, 
which should be considered in health promotion interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the impact 
of stress management training on stress coping strategies and the self-efficacy of these patients in southeastern Iran.

Methods:  This quasi-experimental study was a randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on hemodialysis 
patients from December 2019 to January 2020. Patients who met inclusion criteria were selected with the conveni-
ence sampling method and divided into the two groups of intervention (n 
 30) by using the 
block randomization method. Participants in the intervention group were trained in a stress management training 
program in 8 one-and-a-half-hour sessions, held twice a week. Data were measured with stress coping strategies and 
general self-efficacy questionnaires before, immediately, and 1 month after the intervention. SPSS18 was used for data 
analysis.

Results:  The study results showed that the scores of stress coping strategies and the self-efficacy score in all their 
dimensions were significantly different between the intervention and control groups (P < 0.001).

Conclusion:  The present study results showed that stress management training programs promoted stress coping 
strategies and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients. Health planners and nurses are recommended to use these easy, 
feasible, and inexpensive interventions to reduce stress and increase self-efficacy.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease is the gradual loss of kidney func-
tion over time. The primary treatment for end-stage renal 
disease is dialysis and kidney transplantation [1]. In most 
countries, the incidence of this disease is more than 200 
individuals per million people a year [2]. Hemodialysis is 
the most common treatment for patients with end-stage 
renal disease [3]. Dialysis is a stressful process with many 
psychological and social problems that can lead to mental

disorders  in  patients  [4].  In  addition  to  chronic  disease, 
these  patients  face  many  stressors,  including  problems 
related  to  treatment,  pain,  feeling  of  restlessness,  food 
and  fluid  limitations,  fatigue,  weakness,  stress,  and  feel-
ing of inefficiency [5]. Rapid changes in the physical and 
mental  conditions  of  patients  undergoing  hemodialysis 
put them at serious risks [6]. Paying attention to the men-
tal  stressors  of  these  patients  is  very  important  because 
they  lead  to  reduced  adherence  to  therapeutic  regimens 
and  increased  mortality  and  admission  [7].  The  adverse 
effects  of  stress  can  put  pressure  on  people  and  have 
physical,  behavioral,  and  psychological  consequences 
such  as  anxiety,  worry,  mood  swings,  and  physical  ill-
nesses. Therefore, recognition of stress and its factors is 
essential [8].

In  Iran,  the  number  of  patients  undergoing  dialysis  is 
estimated  at  30,800,  of  which  29,200,  or  about  95%,  are 
undergoing hemodialysis [9]. According to available sta-
tistics, there is a 16% annual increase in patients under-
going  hemodialysis  in  Iran.  Because  home  care  nursing 
has not made significant progress, patients’ psychological 
problems are not commonly addressed [10].

Stress  management  is  a  helpful  skill  in  people.  Stress 
coping skills prepare individuals to better cope with life’s 
needs and challenges [11]. Stress coping skills are behav-
ioral-cognitive  activities  and  processes  to  prevent,  man-
age,  and  reduce  stress.  Coping  with  stress  and  the  type 
of  stress  response  is  more  important  than  the  nature  of 
stress  [12].  According  to  studies,  stress  management 
improves mental health and performance because it acti-
vates  cognition  and  beliefs.  Preventive  strategies  usu-
ally involve trying to achieve various stress management 
techniques,  so  people  can  learn  to  manage  stress  before 
it  causes  psychological  and  physical  problems  [13]. 
El-Monshed’s  study  showed  that  cognitive-behavioral 
nursing  interventions  reduce  the  rate  of  depression  and 
anxiety in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis 
[14]. El-rtreby’s study showed that self-management pro-
grams positively affect the deterioration of quality of life 
in patients with chronic kidney disease [15]. Nohi’s study 
showed that problem-based coping strategies are associ-
ated with reduced perceived stress and improved quality 
of  life  in  coronary  heart  patients  [16].  One  of  the  most 
effective ways to achieve this result is stress management 
training, which is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy. 
Stress management group training is an accurate, multi-
dimensional  therapeutic  intervention  that  does  not  aim 
to  eliminate  stress  completely  but  encourages  clients  to 
consider  stressors  as  a  threat  and  solve  them  [17].  The 
SMT  program  increases  the  individual’s  awareness  of 
the  subtle  stress  response  processes  through  cognitive 
restructuring,  coping  skills  training,  and  social  support 
[18].

Self-efficacy is the belief one has in executing a specific 
task  successfully  to  obtain  a  certain  outcome.  Bandura 
et al. believe that self-efficacy is strengthened in individu-
als when facing challenges with sequential behaviors [19]. 
Self-efficacy is one’s sense of mastery over certain activi-
ties. It is a person’s judgment of their ability to perform a 
particular  activity;  thus,  self-efficacy  plays  an  important 
role  in  regulating  emotional  states  [20].  Self-efficacy  is 
a  psychological  concept  that  focuses  on  the  individual’s 
perception of his skills and abilities to successfully deliver 
a good performance [21]. People with strong self-efficacy 
are  diligent  and  perseverant  in  performing  tasks  com-
pared  with  those  with  poor  self-efficacy.  People  with 
strong  self-efficacy  believe  that  they  can  increase  their 
ability to change environmental challenges, while people 
with poor Self-efficacy generally believe that they cannot 
act in a significant way [22]. Among people’s true beliefs, 
self-efficacy  plays  a  significant  role  in  facing  obstacles, 
failures, and setbacks. Belief in self-efficacy is one of the 
important  and  influential  factors  in  changing  health-
related behaviors [22, 23].

In general, with the high prevalence of chronic kidney 
disease and a significant increase in the number of hemo-
dialysis  patients,  the  need  to  perform  hemodialysis  last-
ing  2  to  4  h  twice  a  week  and  being  on  the  waiting  list 
for  a  kidney  transplant  can  cause  stress  and  inefficiency 
in  these  patients.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  plan  and 
implement  interventions  to  improve  stress  and  increase 
self-efficacy  in  these  patients.  A  review  of  the  literature 
showed limited studies on stress management training in 
such  patients.  Therefore,  this  study  aimed  to  determine 
the impact of stress management training on stress cop-
ing  strategies  and  the  self-efficacy  of  these  patients  in 
southeastern Iran.

Methods
Design and participants

This  quasi-experimental  study  was  randomized  con-
trolled  clinical  trial,  with  allocation  ratio  of  1:1.  was 
conducted  in  the  hemodialysis  department  of  a  hospital 
affiliated  with  Jiroft  University  of  Medical  Sciences. The 
reason  for  choosing  this  center  was  the  number  of  and 
ease of access to patients. This study lasted from Decem-
ber 2019 to January 2020.

Inclusion criteria

1.  Physical and mental ability to complete the question-

naire.

2.  Ability to understand the Persian language.
3.  Absence of a stressful event at least 6 months before 

the study.

4.  Not participating in stress management workshops.

5.  Being between 17 and 65 years old.
6.  At least 3 months have passed since the beginning of 

their dialysis.

7.  No  substance  abuse  or  mental  illness  that  requires 

medication.

Exclusion criteria

1.  Not participating in training sessions (two sessions).
2.  Occurrence of a stressful and severe event during the 

study.

Sample size and sampling

All  85  patients  in  the  dialysis  center  were  purposefully 
evaluated  in  terms  of  inclusion  criteria.  Inclusion  cri-
teria  included  patients  aged  17–65  years  with  physical 
and  mental  ability  to  complete  the  questionnaire  and 
understand Persian, with no stressful experience at least 
6  months  before  the  study,  no  participation  in  stress 
management workshops, the passage of at least 3 months 
since  the  beginning  of  dialysis,  and  no  substance  abuse 
or mental illness that required medication. Exclusion cri-
teria  included  absence  from  training  sessions  (two  ses-
sions) and a stressful and severe event during the study.

Randomization

Out of 85 patients, 65 eligible patients were divided into 
intervention  and  control  groups  with  block  randomiza-
tion method. Five samples were excluded from the study 
for various reasons, including the use of sedatives and the 
death of first-degree relatives, so the results of 60 samples 
were analyzed. According to CONSORT 2010 Flow Dia-
gram (Fig. 1).

Data collection
Instrument

A  three-part  questionnaire  was  used  to  collect  demo-
graphic  and  background  information  form,  the  Billings 
and Moss coping strategy scale (CSS), and Sherer general 
self-efficacy  scale  (GSES).  The  tools  used  in  this  study 
were translated into Persian, and the language of the used 
instruments was Persian.

Demographic  information  included  age,  sex,  level  of 
education, underlying illness, history of mental disorders, 
use of psychiatric drugs, history of participating in stress 
management  programs,  the  experience  of  a  severely 
stressful event during the previous 6 months, disease sta-
tus,  whether  fistulas  were  used  for  dialysis  or  catheters, 
how  many  times  they  were  hemodialyzed  weekly,  and 
how long they had been hemodialyzed.

The  coping  strategy  scale  was  developed  by  Billings 
and Moss (1982). This scale has 32 questions and meas-
ures  five  areas  of  coping  strategies:  emotion-focused 
coping  (11  questions),  problem-focused  coping  (3  ques-
tions), coping based on the evaluation of the situation (5 
questions),  coping  based  on  achieving  social  support  (4 
questions), and coping based on physical inhibition or on 
the  somatization  of  problems  (9  questions). The  scale  is 
scored from zero (never) to three (always). The minimum 
score is 0, and the maximum is 96. Scores 0–32 show that 
coping strategy use is low. Scores 32–48 show that cop-
ing strategies use is moderate. Scores above 48 show that 
coping strategy use is high. The internal consistency reli-
ability  coefficient  was  0.78,  and  the  content  validity  was 
verified by experts [24].

Sherer  et  al.  (1982)  developed  the  general  self-efficacy 
scale  to  measure  people’s  beliefs  in  their  capabilities  to 
overcome  different  situations.  Seventeen  items  measure 
general self-efficacy, with three educational, professional, 
and social dimensions rated on a five-point scale. Items 1, 
3, 8, 9, 13, 15 increase their scores from right to left from 
strongly  disagree  to  strongly  agree  (1:  strongly  disagree, 
2:  disagree,  3:  relatively  agree,  4:  agree,  and  5:  strongly 
agree). The scores of other items increase reversely from 
left to right (5: strongly disagree, 4: disagree, 3: relatively 
agree,  2:  agree,  and  1:  strongly  agree). The  total  score  is 
between  17  and  85.  The  scores  17–34  show  poor  lev-
els  of  SE,  the  scores  34–51  show  moderate  levels  of  SE, 
and scores above 51 show very high levels of SE. Sherer 
reported  the  internal  consistency  and  reliability  coeffi-
cients as 0.76, and the validity of this scale was obtained 
through construct validity [25].

Intervention

To  conduct  the  study,  the  researcher  referred  to  the 
dialysis  ward  of  Imam  Khomeini  hospital  in  Jiroft  and 
obtained  the  necessary  permits.  After  selecting  eligible 
patients, she allocated participants into intervention and 
control  groups  (n = 60)  using  the  convenience  sampling 
method.  Then,  informed  written  consent  was  obtained 
from  the  patients,  and  the  necessary  information  about 
the study objectives was provided to them. The patients 
of  both  groups  completed  the  tools.  Then,  the  patients 
in the intervention group and were trained in eight one-
and-a-half-hour sessions twice a week in addition to their 
routine dialysis treatment. The training sessions included 
group  discussions,  questions  and  answers,  and  home-
work  and  exercises  to  be  done  at  home.  The  training 
sessions were as follows (20) (Table 1). The patients and 
trainer were not blind to group tasks. However, outcome 
assessor did not know the purpose and hypothesis of the 
study, and was blind to when the statistical analysis had 
been completed.

Fig. 1  Explanation of sample size and sampling

The  patients  in  the  control  group  received  only  rou-
tine care during this period. Both groups completed the 
coping strategy scale and general self-efficacy scale again 
immediately and 1 month after the intervention (follow-
up). The language of the instruments used was translated 
into  fluent  Persian.  A  trained  researcher  performed  the 
intervention  on  participants  in  groups  of  5  to  6  during 
dialysis  when  their  vital  signs  and  physical  condition 
were  stable. The  sessions  were  conducted  on  days  when 
the patients in the control group were not present in the 

dialysis center to control the effect of training on the con-
trol group.

Data analysis

SPSS18  was  used  in  this  study.  Descriptive  statistics 
(frequency,  percentage,  mean  and  standard  deviation) 
were used to describe the demographic and background 
characteristics  of  the  research  groups  and  other  study 
variables.  Independent  t-test  and  Fisher’s  exact  test 
were used to compare the demographic and background

Ethical considerations

This  study  was  conducted  with  the  code  of  ethics 
IR.KMU.REC.1398.325  issued  by  Kerman  University  of 
Medical  Sciences  and  after  acquiring  permission  from 
Razi  School  of  Nursing  and  Midwifery  and  the  hospital 
management. The  participants  were  informed  about  the 
voluntary entrance to and withdrawal from the study and 
the study objectives and application of results. The results 
of  the  study  were  also  given  to  the  authorities  if  neces-
sary. This research was conducted based on the religious, 
legal, and professional principles of society. the study was 
registered  retrospectively:

control  of  physical  problems;  in  other  words,  the  scores 
of stress coping strategies in the intervention group in all 
of the dimensions were higher than those of the control 
group during the study (P < 0.001). At the same time, the 
treatment  group  improved  compared  to  the  initial  state 
(Table 3).

The results of the study showed that the score of self-
efficacy  was  significantly  different  between  the  two 
groups  before  the  intervention  in  educational,  profes-
sional,  social  dimensions;  in  other  words,  the  scores  of 
self-efficacy in the intervention group in all of the dimen-
sions were higher than those of the control group during 
the study (P < 0.001). The self-efficacy score was higher in 
the  intervention  group  than  in  the  control  group  at  the 
beginning of the study. Therefore, to control the effect of 
the confounding variable, the pre-intervention score was 
entered as a confounding variable in the analysis variance 
model in repeated measurment. The results showed only 
that variable of the group was the cause of differences in 
the score of self-efficacy. In contrast, the treatment group 
improved compared to the initial state (Table 4).

Results
The  mean  ages  of  the  samples  in  the  intervention  and 
control  groups  were  46.00 ± 2.00  and  49.37 ± 1.91.  No 
significant difference was found between the two groups 
of  intervention  and  control  in  age,  sex,  level  of  educa-
tion,  history  of  mental  disorders,  being  on  the  waiting 
list  for  the  transplant,  underlying  disease,  experience  of 
a  severely  stressful  event  during  the  previous  6  months, 
history of participating in stress management programs, 
and history of using psychiatric drugs (Table 2).

The results of the study showed that the score of stress 
coping  strategies  was  significantly  different  between  the 
two groups in dimensions of coping with cognitive evalu-
ation,  problem-solving,  excitement,  social  support,  and 

Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the effect of stress man-
agement  training  on  stress  coping  strategies  and  self-
efficacy  in  hemodialysis  patients,  and  the  results  of  the 
present  study  demonstrated  the  effect  of  this  training 
method on the scores of stress coping strategies and self-
efficacy. According to the present study results, the mean 
score of stress coping strategies in the intervention group 
increased  immediately  and  1  month  after  the  interven-
tion. Poorgholami et al. reported that the level of stress in 
patients of the intervention group significantly decreased 
after  the  intervention  compared  with  the  control  group 
[26].  Stächele  et  al.  found  that  an  internet-based  short-
term stress management program improved stress coping

skills, sleep quality, and well-being and reduced the per-
ceived stress of the staff [27]. Alkhawaldeh et al. showed 
a  significant  difference  between  intervention  and  con-
trol  groups  in  both  levels  of  job  stress  and  coping  strat-
egies  [28].  Ertekin  Pinar  et  al.  found  a  reduction  in  the 
mean depression  score of  both groups  during the study, 
but  this  decrease  was  greater  in  the  intervention  group. 
In the post-training evaluation, the mean stress score in 
the  experimental  group  was  lower  than  that  of  the  con-
trol group, and the intervention group had higher scores 
in self-confidence and social support, which are subscales 
of stress coping strategies [29]. Ata et al. also stated that 
stress  management  programs  reduced  stress  indicators, 
risk  of  mental  disorder,  and  the  caregiver’s  burden  and 
increased problem-solving and emotion-focused skills in 
the study group [30]. Oztürk et al. showed that the mean 
score  of  stress  coping  styles  was  significantly  different 
between  the  intervention  and  control  groups  after  the 
intervention [31]. Nazer et al. showed that the interven-
tion group’s mean pre- and post-test stress scores differed 
significantly,  showing  reduced  stress  in  the  intervention 
group  [32].  All  of  these  studies  supported  the  results  of 
the  present  study.  It  is  inferred  that  coping  patterns  are 
important  because  they  facilitate  handling  a  stressful 
experience.  If  someone  is  going  through  a  tough  time, 
positive  coping  patterns  provide  extra  resources  to  help 
that person deal with the demands caused by the stressor.
According to the results of the present study and pre-
vious studies, a stress management training program can 
effectively  improve  stress  coping  strategies  and  reduce 
stress  in  patients  and  individuals.  Patients  undergoing 
hemodialysis  experience  stress  in  their  lives  due  to  fac-
tors such as physical dependence on devices, limitations 
in physical function, changes in sexual function and diet, 

fluid restriction, consumption of large amounts of drugs 
for treatment, and loss of appetite and energy [33], so it 
seems necessary to use an effective intervention in order 
to reduce stress and help them cope with it. Today, it has 
been recognized that people respond differently to stress-
ful situations. Using different methods to cope with stress 
has  different  consequences  on  individuals’  physical  and 
mental  health.  Coping  skills  are  passive  or  active  efforts 
used in response to threatening situations, and they help 
patients  reduce  emotional  distress  [34].  Dealing  with 
chronic  illness  is  always  a  challenging  and  threatening 
process, and if coping strategies are used effectively, they 
can help improve performance and well-being [35]. Stress 
management training is one of the most effective meth-
ods,  and  it  is  an  accurate,  multidimensional,  and  thera-
peutic  intervention.  The  purpose  of  this  intervention  is 
not  to  completely  eliminate  stress  but  to  encourage  cli-
ents  to  consider  stressful  situations  as  threats  and  solve 
them  [36];  this  method  can  be  used  for  chronic  kidney 
patients.  It  seems  that  stress  coping  strategies  can  help 
patients’ minds and bodies adapt. Without it, their bodies 
might always be on high alert. Over time, chronic stress 
can lead to serious health problems. Patients should not 
wait  until  stress  damages  their  health,  relationships,  or 
quality of life.

The  present  study  results  showed  that  the  mean  score 
of self-efficacy in the intervention group increased imme-
diately  and  1  month  after  the  intervention,  and  it  was 
significantly  higher  than  that  of  the  control  group.  The 
researchers  showed  that  stress  management  counseling 
and training could improve and increase self-efficacy [20, 
37, 38]. Terp et al. showed that students in the interven-
tion group were better able to manage stress, self-efficacy 
and  self-esteem  than  those  in  the  control  group  [36].

Moharrami  et  al.  also  showed  a  significant  difference  in 
the  mean  scores  of  job  stress  and  SE  between  the  inter-
vention  and  control  groups  after  the  intervention  [20]. 
Jajormaneh  et  al.  argued  that  the  self-efficacy  score  in 
the intervention group was significantly higher than that 
of the control group immediately and 1 month after the 
intervention  [21].  These  results  suggest  that  encourag-
ing flexibility in coping strategies would help to improve 
patients’ self-efficacy.

According to the results of the present study and other 
studies, a stress management training program can be an 
effective intervention to promote self-efficacy in individ-
uals. Evidence suggests that increasing the self-efficacy of 
dialysis patients improves weight control between dialy-
sis sessions, reduces admission, reduces amputation, and 
improves the quality of life, especially in dialysis patients 
with  diabetes.  In  addition,  increasing  self-efficacy  leads 
to behavioral changes, acceptance of treatment, and pro-
motion  of  physical  and  mental  health  [20].  Because  the 
results of studies have shown poor self-efficacy in dialy-
sis  patients  [20,  39],  appropriate  methods  to  improve 
self-efficacy  in  these  patients  are  vital.  According  to  the 
studies  and  the  positive  effect  of  stress  management 
training, it seems that this training method can be useful 
and effective in improving the self-efficacy of the patients 
undergoing hemodialysis.

Fatigue and long duration of hemodialysis were among 
the  limitations  of  the  study  and  patients  were  reluctant 
to  attend  training  classes.  We  tried  to  motivate  patients 
to  participate  in  classes  and  hold  sessions  at  times  that 
did  not  interfere  with  patients’  activities  and  treatment. 
Questionnaires  were  also  completed  by  patients  before 
hemodialysis.

Conclusion
The present study results showed that the stress manage-
ment training program promoted stress coping strategies 
and  self-efficacy  in  hemodialysis  patients.  Given  these 
results and the importance of stress and poor self-efficacy 
in these patients, it is recommended that the healthcare 
staff  and  nurses  use  this  easy,  feasible,  and  inexpen-
sive  intervention  while  providing  healthcare  for  dialysis 
patients.  Furthermore,  managers  and  nursing  education 
authorities  can  use  this  educational  method  to  reduce 
stress and improve the self-efficacy of these patients.

Questionnaires  were  also  completed  by  patients  before 
hemodialysis.
