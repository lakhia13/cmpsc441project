ABSTRACT
Objectives  To evaluate the available virtual reality (VR) 
applications for treating perinatal mental health disorders, 
focusing on their effectiveness in reducing symptoms such 
as anxiety and depression, which are common during the 
perinatal period.
Design  Rapid scoping review adhering to the Joanna 
Briggs Institute guidelines and Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses extension for 
Scoping Review (PRISMA- ScR), with adjustments based on 
the Cochrane Rapid Reviews guidelines.
Data sources  Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, Evidence- 
Based Medicine (EBM) Reviews using Ovid and Web of 
Science were searched through 20 February 2024.
Eligibility criteria  Studies were included if they were 
written in English or French, provided details on the VR 
technology, described the assessment of perinatal mood 
disorders and specified the outcomes measured and 
the methodological approach used. Review and editorial 
articles were excluded as well as abstracts and posters.
Data extraction and synthesis  One reviewer extracted 
study characteristics (eg, design, participants, VR 
components, outcomes) and a second reviewer verified 
accuracy; study quality was assessed using the National 
Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment of Controlled 
Intervention Studies tool, and findings were synthesised 
narratively and in tabular form.
Results  A total of 425 records were identified. After 
removing duplicates, 308 records were screened by title 
and abstract. Of these, 74 full texts were assessed for 
eligibility, resulting in 10 studies being included for data 
extraction. These final studies were primarily conducted 
in high- income countries from 2019 to 2024. 8 of 10 
(80%) were randomised controlled trials, employing VR 
through head- mounted displays. Studies predominantly 
targeted non- severe cases of anxiety and depression, 
with VR environments ranging from nature scenes to 
therapeutic content. Results suggest a positive impact of 
VR interventions on reducing anxiety and depression levels 
among participants.
Conclusions  Studying VR appears to be a promising 
avenue for developing options to manage perinatal 
mental health. The immersive nature of VR may provide 
opportunities for emotional relief and support during this 
critical period through engaging experiences which can 
reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, 
the body of research remains limited, indicating a need 
for further studies to explore the long- term benefits 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ The study results are reported following the estab-
lished  guidelines  of  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items 
for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta- Analyses  exten-
sion  for  Scoping  Review  (PRISMA- ScR),  ensuring 
all essential reporting items for systematic reviews 
were included.

 ⇒ A thorough search across five major databases was 
conducted to capture relevant studies related to VR 
and perinatal mental health.

 ⇒ Stringent  eligibility  criteria  were  set  to  ensure  the 

relevance and quality of the selected studies.

 ⇒ The  focus  on  primarily  medical  and  psychological 
databases  may  have  excluded  studies  from  other 
fields, such as computer science, which could pro-
vide additional insights into VR technology.

 ⇒ The  restricted  examination  of  grey  literature,  con-
fined to citations within included studies, may have 
missed  relevant  but  unpublished  or  non- peer- 
reviewed  research  that  could  provide  additional 
context or data.

and potential integration of VR into perinatal healthcare 
practices. The promising results from initial studies 
encourage continued exploration and development within 
this innovative therapeutic field.

INTRODUCTION
Mental health struggles are common during 
the  perinatal  period,  defined  as  the  time 
frame from 1 year before birth to 24 months 
after,1 based on growing evidence that mental 
health  challenges  frequently  persist  beyond 
the first year.2 In fact, approximately 23% of 
mothers in Canada report experiencing symp-
toms  of  postpartum  depression  or  anxiety 
disorders,3 two distinct conditions that often 
co- occur.4  Specifically,  prevalence  rates  of 
symptoms for prenatal depression range from 
20%  to  40%  and  are  around  17%  for  post-
partum  depression.5  Similarly,  prevalence 
rates  range  from  13%  to  21%  for  prenatal 
anxiety symptoms and from 11% to 17% for

postpartum  anxiety.6  These  rates  increased  during  the 
COVID- 19  pandemic,6–12  with  meta- analyses  reporting 
symptoms  of  postpartum  depression  around  26%  and 
those  of  prenatal  and  postnatal  anxiety  exceeding  32% 
during the pandemic period.13 In fact, a population- based 
cohort in Ontario found postpartum individuals were 2.6 
to 3.3 times more likely to screen above threshold levels 
for depression during the early pandemic compared with 
pre- pandemic.14

If  left  untreated,  maternal  and  paternal  mood  disor-
ders can have long- term negative effects on the parents, 
the  child  and  thus  the  family  as  a  whole.15  Since  peri-
natal  mood  disorders  are  heterogenous  and  of  varied 
severity,  a  variety  of  treatments  exist.  Current  treatment 
methods  include  psychotherapies  (most  notably  cogni-
tive–behavioural therapy (CBT)16), psychopharmacology 
(though pregnant individuals frequently express a strong 
preference  to  avoid  taking  medication  due  to  potential 
fetal and neonatal risks, although a minority are willing 
to  consider  antidepressant  medication17),  well- being 
enhancement  (such  as  exercise,  behavioural  activation 
and  mindfulness),18  larger  systems  approaches  (such  as 
community  therapy  and  peer  support  therapy)19  and 
eHealth  programs.20  eHealth  offers  promising  treat-
ment  modalities  consisting  of  technology- based  thera-
pies  including  app- based  or  web- based  psychoeducation 
modules,  video  or  phone  sessions,  and  text  messages. 
Burgeoning  evidence  points  to  the  effectiveness  of 
eHealth programs to support perinatal mental health and 
the  well- being  of  new  parents.21  In  fact,  a  recent  meta- 
analysis22 indicated that there is a small effect of eHealth 
interventions for depression and anxiety, and a moderate 
effect for insomnia, during pregnancy.

One of the eHealth modalities that has been growing 
in popularity is virtual reality (VR), defined as a ‘set of 
technologies  that  enables  people  to  immersively  expe-
rience  a  world  beyond  reality’.23  24  VR  is  commonly 
used  with  head- mounted  displays  (HMDs)  which 
create  an  immersive  experience  that  allows  someone 
to  interact  with  a  computer- generated  world.24  Alter-
natively,  semi- immersive  VR  exists  in  the  form  of  cave 
automatic  virtual  environment  systems  (ie,  projector 
screens)  or  non- immersive  VR  in  the  form  of  monitor 
screens.  These  latter  two  methods  have  been  proven 
to  be  less  effective  than  fully  immersive  VR  when  elic-
iting feelings of presence compared with HMDs.25 26 In 
fact, immersion in a VR environment elicits a sense of 
presence that allows the user to experience the gener-
ated environment rather than the actual physical one,27 
which in VR- based therapy is positively correlated to a 
decrease  in  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression.28  29 
Furthermore, having a higher immersion increases the 
emotional  impact  for  the  user.26  There  is  substantial 
evidence regarding the effectiveness of immersive VR in 
the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms for 
non- pregnant populations across a range of settings,30 31 
with  emphasis  on  social  anxiety,  general  anxiety  and 
public speaking anxiety.30

2

However,  the  effectiveness  of  VR  to  treat  mood  disor-
ders  and  improve  mental  health  during  the  perinatal 
period is relatively unexplored. A previous scoping review 
of nine studies that used VR to help people during their 
pregnancy and delivery found that VR is effective in the 
treatment  of  pregnancy- related  anxiety  and  delivery 
pain  management.32  Suggested  mechanisms  include 
providing  information  about  what  to  expect  during 
delivery,  through  experiential  exposure,  and  distraction 
from  stressful  pregnancy  and  childbirth- related  events. 
However, the review was limited to VR being used to treat 
symptoms  of  anxiety  and  pain  reduction,  or  as  an  exer-
cise tool. VR has mainly been used in the perinatal period 
for  assisting  during  specific  procedures  such  as  during 
labour or surgery, as well as during various assisted repro-
ductive procedures. This has provided evidence on how 
VR may be able to mitigate anxiety symptoms and stress 
related  to  a  specific  event.  As  a  result,  three  systematic 
reviews  and  meta- analyses  have  been  conducted,  all  of 
which found VR to be an effective and safe way to reduce 
labour- related pain and anxiety.33

Nonetheless,  there  is  a  lack  of  evidence  summarised 
in  one  review  that  focuses  on  the  overall  mental  health 
of new and expecting parents. Given that poor perinatal 
mental health can lead to poor health outcomes for the 
child  and  the  parent,11  there  is  a  high  importance  in 
identifying treatment options for perinatal mood- related 
disorders  and  improving  the  overall  mental  health  of 
parents. There is thus a clear need to synthesise and eval-
uate the research conducted to date using fully immersive 
VR to treat symptoms related to perinatal mood disorders 
and to support mental health during the perinatal period. 
Considering the novelty of the field of VR and the limited 
literature  available,  a  rapid  scoping  review  presents  the 
most feasible option to summarise the available evidence. 
Particularly,  it  is  important  to  understand  what  kind  of 
VR technology has been used, how it has been used and 
what  the  outcomes  have  been,  in  order  to  comprehen-
sively  present  the  available  knowledge  and  guide  future 
development and testing.

Study aims
To  thoroughly  investigate  the  literature  available  about 
VR in supporting perinatal mental health, we conducted 
a rapid scoping review, which aims to answer the following 
research question: What virtual reality (VR) applications are 
available  for  the  treatment  of  perinatal  mental  health?  Our 
synthesis  focused  on  the  following  key  objectives:  (1) 
determining the types of VR technology employed in peri-
natal mental health treatment and the various ways they 
have been implemented; (2) identifying specific mental 
health symptoms that have been evaluated following VR 
interventions for perinatal mental health; (3) examining 
the characteristics of research studies that employ VR for 
perinatal mental health, including study settings, partic-
ipant characteristics and research designs; and (4) high-
lighting the principal findings of VR outcomes (feasibility

concepts and identification of knowledge gaps, providing 
an overview of the current evidence base.

METHODS
Study design and registration
To  appropriately  answer  the  research  question  and  the 
objectives in our scoping review, we followed the guide-
lines set by the Joanna Briggs Institute34 and the Preferred 
Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta- 
Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA- ScR);35 
we also followed the interim guidance from the Cochrane 
Rapid Reviews Methods Group.36 As such, we conducted 
the  rapid  scoping  review  in  the  following  stages:  pilot 
search,  pilot  screening,  search  strategy  update,  search, 
screening, extraction, synthesis. The review was registered 
with  OSF37  on  6  March  2024.  This  review  method  is  an 
established methodological approach that combines the 
broad  mapping  purpose  of  a  scoping  review  with  meth-
odological streamlining typical of rapid  reviews.38 It was 
selected due to the emerging nature of the intervention 
and  therefore  limited  body  of  literature  available.  The 
rapid approach allowed for an efficient mapping of key 

Eligibility criteria
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  studies  can  be 
seen in table 1.

Information sources
Five  databases  were  searched:  Medline,  PsychInfo, 
Embase, Evidence- based Medicine (EBM) Reviews using 
Ovid  and  Web  of  Science.  The  search  was  done  on  20 
February  2024  (CZ).  The  search  strategy  was  drafted 
in  consultation  with  a  psychology  and  psychoeducation 
librarian of the Université de Montréal, who also advised 
on the review type. Following a preliminary review of the 
topic and existing indexing terms, three key conceptual 
domains were identified to structure the search: “virtual 
reality”,  “mental  health”,  and  “perinatal  period”.  These 
concepts  were  selected  to  capture  the  intersection  of 
immersive  technologies  with  psychological  well- being 
during the perinatal period. The final search strategy can 
be found in the online supplemental material.

Selection of sources of evidence
Following the search, all identified studies were collected 
and uploaded into EndNote 21 (Clarivate Analytics, Penn-
sylvania, USA). Records were then imported to the Covi-
dence platform, where duplicates were removed, for the 
screening  of  the  articles.  The  screening  was  conducted 
following  all  the  steps  set  by  PRISMA- ScR35  for  scoping 
reviews,  with  adjustments  regarding  the  number  of 
screeners per step based on the recommendations from 
Cochrane  Rapid  Reviews.36  Step  1:  one  screener  (CZ) 
screened for titles and abstracts. All the excluded studies, 
as  well  as  20%  of  the  included  studies,  were  screened 
by an additional independent screener (JJ). Step 2: one 
screener  (CZ)  screened  the  full  texts.  All  the  excluded 
studies  were  screened  by  the  additional  independent 
screener (JJ). Any disagreements that arose between the 
screeners  at  each  round  of  the  selection  process  were 
resolved through a consensus discussion, or with a third 
reviewer (ALM). The reference list of the studies included 
for full text in the review was also scanned to identify any 
relevant grey literature; however, none was found.

Data extraction and quality assessment
The  following  data  were  extracted:  study  title,  year  of 
publication, country, study design, sample size and partic-
ipant characteristics, VR components (hardware and soft-
ware), time between data collection sessions if applicable, 
mental health condition being investigated, quantitative 
data collected related to mental health or VR, qualitative 
data if applicable, and study outcomes (such as informa-
tion on usability, acceptability and VR’s effect on mental 
health  results).  One  extractor  (CZ) 
independently 
extracted  all  the  data  required,  and  a  second  extractor 
(JJ) checked for correctness.

Study  quality  was  assessed  with  the  National  Institute 
of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment of Controlled Inter-
vention Studies tool39 by a single reviewer (CZ), with an 
additional  reviewer  verifying  the  judgements  (JJ).  The 
tool includes 14 questions answered with yes, no, cannot 
determine,  not  applicable  and  not  reported.  The  tool 
is  designed  to  assist  reviewers  in  the  critical  appraisal 
of  internal  validity,  including  risk  of  bias  and  method-
ological  flaws,  without  focus  on  a  numeric  score.  After 
answering the 14 questions, the studies are judged to be 
good  (considers  results  to  be  valid),  fair  (acknowledges 
the results may contain some bias but not enough to be 
deemed invalid) or poor (indicates significant risk of bias 
or flaws). Any studies included in the form of a registra-
tion or protocol were not assessed.

Synthesis of results
To answer the research question, all the information found 
was  synthesised  both  narratively  and  in  tabular  form  so 
that the available VR treatments can be comprehensively 
presented. Results were categorised and reported based 
on the included studies’ general characteristics (author’s 
name, year of publication, country, type of study, sample 
size, participant characteristics, study objective) in online

supplemental  table  1,  and  specific  characteristics  (VR 
hardware  and  software,  mental  health  measures,  time 
between data collection and reported findings) in online 
supplemental table 2.

Patient and public involvement
None.

RESULTS
A  total  of  425  records  were  found.  After  removing  all 
duplicates,  a  total  of  308  records  were  left  for  title  and 
abstract screening. Out of these, 74 records were assessed 
for  full- text  eligibility,  out  of  which  10  records  were 
included for data extraction (figure 1).

General study characteristics
As  seen  in  online  supplemental  table  1,  the  included 
studies  (k=10)  were  published  between  2019  and  2024, 
with  most  in  2023  (k=6,  60%).40–45  The  majority  of  the 
studies (n=8, 80%)40–44 46–48 were randomised controlled 
trials  (RCTs),  while  one  was  a  pilot  trial45  and  one  was 
a  laboratory  experiment.49  Out  of  the  included  studies, 
some  (k=3)  have  not  yet  been  conducted  at  the  time 
of  our  search;  one  was  a  registration  of  a  RCT  that  is 
still  in  the  process  of  recruiting  participants,41  and  two 
were  study  protocols.42  45  The  included  studies  were 
conducted  across  several  countries,  including  Turkey 
(k=3),40 44 48 Spain (k=2),42 47 the USA and China (k=1),49 
Korea  (k=1),43  Denmark  (k=1),41  Switzerland  (k=1)41 
and the Netherlands (k=1).46 Out of the studies already 
conducted (k=7),40 43 44 46–49 there was an average of 130.3 
participants  (N=912  total),  with  an  average  age  of  30.3 
years  old  (two  studies43  47  did  not  mention  an  age  limit 
criteria) and an average of 31.6 weeks’ gestation among 
those who were pregnant.

Most studies only investigated the effects of VR with the 
pregnant  person  (k=9),40–45  47–49  while  one  also  investi-
gated the effects with their partner.46 The objectives of the 
included studies were varied, with some measuring aspects 
beyond mental health. The included studies targeted non- 
severe mental health cases including symptoms of anxiety 
(k=5, 50%),40 44 46–48 stress (k=2, 20%)44 49 and depression 
(k=1, 10%).41 As seen in the data extracted (online supple-
mental table 2), most studies measured multiple mental 
health  symptoms  outcomes.  Most  studies  (k=9)40  42–49 
used validated questionnaires to measure mental health 
symptoms, with only one study not mentioning the ques-
tionnaires  to  be  used.41  Anxiety  was  most  commonly 
assessed (k=8)40 42 44–49 through the State Anxiety Inven-
tory  (STAI)  (k=5,  62.5%),40  42  44  47  48  which  is  a  40- item 
questionnaire that measures both state anxiety (ie, expe-
rienced  in  that  exact  moment  and  experienced  gener-
ally) and trait anxiety (ie, persistent, affecting the person 
long- term).50  This  is  followed  by  depression  (k=5),41–45 
which was most frequently measured with the Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (k=2, 40%),42 43 which 
assesses depressive symptoms experienced in the previous

week.42 One registration (k=1, 10%)41 did not report their 
planned measure for depression. Most of the instruments 
used  in  the  included  studies  to  evaluate  the  effective-
ness of VR were not specifically validated or adapted for 
perinatal  populations.  However,  some  perinatal- specific 
measures were applied, such as questionnaires addressing 
childbirth and pregnancy, and these are listed in online 
supplemental table 2.

Specific study characteristics
As seen in online supplemental table 2, the studies used 
different VR hardware. Half of the studies (k=5)40 43 46–48 
used a VR device compatible with a smartphone, whereas 
the  other  half41  42  44  45  49  used  standalone  VR  headsets. 
Half of the studies (k=5, 50%)40 44 47–49 had nature envi-
ronments  as  the  visual  stimuli  in  VR  with  the  aim  of 
aiding the participant to relax, whereas the other types of 
stimuli were fetal/baby images (k=2, 20%)43 45 to help the 
bonding experience between parent and baby, cesarean 
delivery  informative  videos  (k=1,  10%)46  and  activities 
such  as  mindfulness/breathing  exercises  (k=1,  10%)42 
and  cognitive  exercises  (k=1,  10%).41  The  interventions 
and data collection were carried out over different periods 
of time, ranging from one session to daily sessions over a 

period of 16 weeks depending on the study, with almost 
half (k=4, 40%)40 47–49 only requiring one VR session. The 
time in between VR sessions for the studies that adminis-
tered more than one session is reported in online supple-
mental  table  2  under  ‘Time  between  data  collections’. 
Most  studies  (k=8,  80%)40  42–44  46–49  collected  pre  and 
post  VR  intervention  data  relating  to  the  mental  health 
symptoms  of  the  participants.  Out  of  these,  a  minority 
(k=3, 37.5%) also conducted follow- up assessments after 
the VR intervention had been administered (1 week and 
1 month after birth,45 1–2 weeks after birth46 and up until 
10 months after birth41).

Of  the  studies  that  were  already  conducted  and  thus 
reported  findings  (k=7,  70%),40  43  44  46–49  the  outcomes 
of the VR interventions were positive. Regarding anxiety, 
studies  (k=6,  85.7%)  found  a  decrease  in  symptoms 
after  VR  intervention.40  44  46–49  Specifically,  it  was  found 
that  VR  environments  with  more  green  spaces,  such  as 
parks, were associated with decreased anxiety symptoms 
and increased happiness compared with urban VR envi-
ronments without green spaces.49 It was also found that 
a VR intervention showing fetal images led to lower self- 
reported  depression  scores  compared  with  participants

receiving no VR intervention.43 Undergoing VR interven-
tion  was  also  associated  with  a  decrease  in  self- reported 
stress.44  Results  were  positive  for  the  subjective  experi-
ence  of  VR  interventions,  with  studies  reporting  partic-
ipant  satisfaction  and  willingness  to  recommend  VR  to 
other pregnant women.40 44 48

Quality assessment
Study quality was assessed using the NIH Quality Assess-
ment  of  Controlled  Intervention  Studies  tool,39  except 
for the registrations and protocols. Thus, 7 out of the 10 
studies included (70%) were assessed, and both reviewers 
(CZ and JJ) agreed on the outcomes. Four out of seven 
(57%)  were  rated  as  fair40  46  48  49,  while  the  other  three 
(42%) were rated as good43 44 47. Thus, the results of the 
included studies can be considered valid.

DISCUSSION
Summary of evidence
Perinatal  mood  disorders  can  have  long- term  negative 
effects  on  the  parent  and  the  child  if  left  untreated.11 
Among the treatment options, more eHealth approaches 
are  now  being  offered  including  VR,  which  has  been 
shown to be an effective tool to treat symptoms of social 
anxiety, general anxiety and other forms  of  anxiety and 
depression  in  the  general  population.30  31  However, 
little is known about whether VR can be used to support 
mental health during the perinatal period, beyond inter-
ventions  that  focus  on  mental  health  changes  arising 
due  to  fear  of  childbirth  or  medical  procedures  related 
to  pregnancy.  Thus,  this  rapid  scoping  review  aimed  to 
identify  the  current  literature  available  that  uses  VR  in 
supporting  perinatal  mental  health  by  answering  the 
following  research  question:  What  virtual  reality  applica-
tions are available for the treatment of perinatal mental health?

We  found  limited  literature  in  the  field,  with  the 
earliest  study  being  published  in  2019  and  most  studies 
being  published  in  2023.  This  indicates  how  novel  the 
research is to date and that this field is growing in popu-
larity. Thus, it may be possible that in the upcoming years, 
more research will be available. All of the included studies 
provided fully immersive VR experiences by using HMDs 
as their VR hardware. The type of HMD varied among the 
studies, with half of included studies using HMDs compat-
ible with a smartphone. These latter types of HMDs work 
by  inserting  a  smartphone  in  front  of  the  headset,  thus 
allowing users to view the VR environment through the 
HMD  lenses  played  on  the  smartphone.  These  types  of 
HMDs  are  a  more  affordable  alternative  to  other  head-
sets,  but  often  lack  direct  user  interaction  and  strong 
computing power.51 In fact, all the studies that used this 
device showed images or videos, often of nature environ-
ments,40 43 46–48 and did not allow interaction with the envi-
ronment. Contrarily, two of the studies using standalone 
HMDs  described  more  interactive  VR  experiences,  with 
Jimenez- Barragan  et  al42  using  mindfulness  techniques 
and  Miskowiak41  conducting  cognitive  exercises.  Out  of 

6

the  studies  that  developed  their  own  VR  environment, 
one49 created urban spaces (with different levels of green 
nature  spaces)  and  found  that  green  spaces  increased 
happiness  and  decreased  symptoms  of  anxiety,  whereas 
another  study43  that  developed  VR  images  of  the  fetus 
specific  for  each  participant  found  greater  attachment 
between the mother and the fetus. One study46 found their 
developed VR environment, a cesarean delivery informa-
tion program, to have no significant effect on the anxiety 
symptoms  of  the  patients  or  their  partner  compared 
with  the  control  group,  except  for  those  with  a  history 
of emergency cesarean delivery. No study compared the 
effectiveness  of  different  VR  interventions,  or  different 
environments within the same intervention, which would 
be helpful to determine whether one VR intervention can 
be more beneficial over another or differential effects by 
outcome.

VR  interventions  were  most  commonly  used  to  miti-
gate  symptoms  of  non- severe  cases  of  anxiety,  which 
was  often  measured  through  questionnaires  such  as  the 
STAI, as well as non- severe cases of depression, which was 
most frequently measured with the EPDS questionnaire. 
Although  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression  were 
measured,  mitigating  these  was  not  always  the  primary 
objective  of  the  study.  In  fact,  only  five  out  of  the  eight 
studies measuring anxiety aimed to test the effect of VR 
on decreasing anxiety symptoms and only one out of the 
five studies measuring depression aimed to test whether 
VR has the potential to decrease symptoms of postpartum 
depression.  Furthermore,  all  studies  monitored  symp-
toms  of  the  pregnant  person  but  only  one  study  also 
included the partner, even though it has been observed 
that symptoms of paternal mental illness have a negative 
effect on child development.12

Overall, the results of the studies were positive for the 
effects  of  VR  on  mental  health,  with  studies  showing 
lower  anxiety40  44  46–49  and  depression43  symptoms  after 
the  intervention.  Participants  also  indicated  a  willing-
ness to recommend VR to other pregnant people. While 
other  treatment  methods  for  perinatal  mood  disor-
ders  are  considered  well  established  and  credible,  the 
evidence base for VR’s effectiveness is promising but still 
in its infancy. However, VR enables more flexibility with 
various ways in which it could be employed and explored 
as a mental health treatment modality. The trend noticed 
while conducting this review is that research in this field 
is  growing,  implying  that  the  next  years  will  bear  more 
evidence  about  VR’s  use  for  perinatal  mood  disorders. 
The increase in research may lead to the development of 
standardised  treatments  using  VR,  which  could  thereby 
establish its credibility as a treatment modality.

Quality  assessment  suggested  that  all  included  studies 
were deemed to be of fair to good quality. The number 
of  participants  included  was  appropriate  for  all  the 
studies, as well as the participant randomisation method. 
This  may  be  attributed  to  most  studies  being  RCTs  and 
thus  sample  size  was  determined  based  on  power  anal-
yses. Most studies explicitly set the inclusion criteria for 

Zorzi C, et al. BMJ Open 2025;15:e094901. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094901pregnant  participants  to  not  have  a  history  of  mental 
health  illness;  however,  one  proposed  study41  purposely 
included  participants  with  a  history  of  mental  illness  to 
compare their outcomes to those without a history. As this 
is a registration, its findings are yet to be published. Almost 
half of the studies40 47–49 already conducted and one study 
protocol45 administered VR in one session only, and their 
interventions  still  showed  positive  results.  Being  able  to 
successfully  implement  VR  in  one  session  may  increase 
its  feasibility,  as  it  could  be  offered  for  therapy  during 
in- patient visits without requiring each participant to own 
a  headset  for  at  home  use.  Furthermore,  most  studies 
only assessed the outcomes of the VR immediately post- 
intervention, with only three conducting follow- up assess-
ments (1 week and 1 month after birth,45 1–2 weeks after 
birth46 and up until 10 months after birth41). Thus, most 
studies are only able to determine the immediate effects 
of  VR.  These  results  may  also  be  skewed  by  the  excite-
ment of trying the new technology, a concept known as 
the ‘novelty effect’,52 especially for the studies which only 
had  one  VR  session,  and  may  not  accurately  represent 
the  long- term  effectiveness  of  the  intervention.  Future 
research  should  consider  evaluating  mental  health  over 
a  longer  period  and  implementing  VR  across  multiple 
sessions  to  assess  long- term  and  dose- response  effects. 
Psychotherapy  typically  requires  12–16  sessions  to  show 
meaningful change in treating postpartum depression,53 
with  some  cases  requiring  fewer;  therefore,  VR  therapy 
may need similar standards to ensure efficacy. Addition-
ally,  the  VR  interventions  included  in  this  review  were 
standalone;  it  would  therefore  be  beneficial  for  future 
studies to explore the benefits of using VR as an adjunct 
to treatment such as CBT, third- wave psychotherapies or 
interpersonal  psychotherapy.  Considering  the  potential 
long- term  effects  of  perinatal  mood  disorders  on  infant 
development,  it  may  be  interesting  to  evaluate  how  VR 
interventions for parents may influence outcomes among 
their children.

Limitations
Our  review  focused  on  synthesising  existing  evidence 
on  the  use  of  VR  to  support  perinatal  mental  health. 
Given the emerging nature of this field, a rapid scoping 
review was determined as the most feasible approach to 
capture  the  breadth  of  research  within  a  limited  time-
frame.  While  comprehensive,  this  methodology  might 
not provide the depth of insights that a systematic review 
conducted over a longer period could offer, especially as 
relevant  studies  continue  to  emerge.  Additionally,  our 
search was primarily concentrated in medical and psycho-
logical  databases.  Important  contributions  catalogued 
in different databases from fields like computer science 
or  engineering  discussing  more  in- depth  technological 
aspects of the VR technology could have been overlooked. 
The  search  of  grey  literature  was  limited  and  examined 
only  citations  within  included  studies  in  adherence  to 
rapid  review  protocols,  which  might  have  restricted  our 
access to some pivotal works. It must also be noted that 

Open access

although  the  search  terms  used  to  identify  the  studies 
for  this  review  were  broad  and  encompassed  all  aspects 
of  mental  health,  the  results  predominately  focused  on 
anxiety and depression. In this regard, the review focuses 
on  individuals  experiencing  low- to- moderate  symptoms 
of  anxiety  and  depression,  rather  than  those  with  clini-
cally diagnosed disorders. This distinction is important, as 
symptoms do not necessarily equate to a formal diagnosis, 
and  our  review  may  therefore  exclude  populations  with 
severe conditions. As a result, it must be emphasised that 
the  effectiveness  of  VR  to  support  individuals  suffering 
from clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression cannot 
be  determined.  Additionally,  the  reliability  of  findings 
may  be  limited  as  most  studies  included  in  this  review 
relied  on  self- report  questionnaires  of  symptoms  rather 
than  standardised  clinical  assessments.  While  not  all  of 
these tools were validated specifically for use in perinatal 
populations,  many  have  been  used  reliably  during  this 
period.54–57 Language barriers also pose a limitation; most 
included studies were conducted in non- Anglophone and 
non- Francophone  countries,  raising  the  possibility  that 
other relevant studies were conducted in these countries 
however  not  published  in  English  or  French  and  thus 
were not included.

CONCLUSION
This rapid scoping review highlighted the growing interest 
in  VR  technologies  in  the  treatment  of  mental  health 
problems  during  the  perinatal  period,  particularly  for 
anxiety and depression. Despite the limited body of liter-
ature, the available studies, published between 2019 and 
2024, indicate that VR interventions are being explored as 
supportive tools for individuals experiencing non- severe 
cases for conditions such as perinatal anxiety and depres-
sion,  which  are  prevalent  during  this  sensitive  period. 
However,  the  research  remains  in  its  beginning  stages, 
lacking  comparative  analyses  to  establish  the  effective-
ness of different VR approaches. The positive outcomes 
reported in these initial studies, such as reduced anxiety 
and  depression  symptoms,  as  well  as  subjective  satisfac-
tion with VR interventions, offer a hopeful perspective on 
the  potential  role  of  VR  in  perinatal  mental  health  and 
warrant further systematic investigation.
