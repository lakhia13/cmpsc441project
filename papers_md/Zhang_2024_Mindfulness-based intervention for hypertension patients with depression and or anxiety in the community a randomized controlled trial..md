Abstract 
Objective  To evaluate mindfulness-based intervention for hypertension with depression and/or anxiety.

Methods  10-week mindfulness-based intervention, including health education for hypertension, exclusively 
for the control group, was administered to the intervention group to assist sixty hypertension patients with depres-
sion/anxiety. Among them, the intervention group comprised 8 men and 22 women, with a mean age of 60.02 years 
and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.29 years. The control group consisted of 14 men and 16 women 
with a mean age of 57.68 years and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.32 years. The severity of depressive and/
or anxiety symptoms was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), along with blood pressure (BP) measurements taken twice daily. The study utilized 
a self-made self-efficacy scale and awareness of physical and mental health to evaluate mental health and state.

Results  The depression PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores reduced by 21.1% or 17.8% in the mindfulness-based intervention 
group, compared to the control (Z = -2.040, P = 0.041) post 10-week period, suggesting significant reduction in anxi-
ety/stress. These results were consistent with a reduction in systolic BP of 12.24 mm Hg (t = 6.041, P = 0.000). The 
self-efficacy score of the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to the control (t = 7.818, 
P < 0.001), while the awareness of physical and mental health in the mindfulness intervention group significantly 
improved compared to the control (χ2 = 5.781, P = 0.016).

Conclusion  Mindfulness-based, short-term focused interventions provide modest relief for depression and/or anxi-
ety and are effective in lowering blood pressure and improving self-efficacy scores.

Introduction
Hypertension,  a  common  chronic  disease  with  a  high 
prevalence  (27.9%)  among  Chinese  adults  [1],  usually 
requires lifelong management of blood pressure (BP) with 
medications [2]. A high number of hypertensive patients 
also experience co-existing depression and/or anxiety [3]. 
Additionally,  a  significant  portion  of  these  hypertensive 
patients  are  non-compliant  with  medical  practitioners’ 
instructions, resulting in serious complications and com-
promised quality of life [4]. Therefore, managing depres-
sion  and/or  anxiety  is  equally  as  important  as  treating 
hypertension.

There  has  been  documented  a  close  association 
between  hypertension  and  depression  or  anxiety,  which 
are  independent  risk  factors  for  hypertension  [5].  Stress 
relief is therefore an ideal approach in the ongoing man-
agement  of  hypertension  [6].  Psychotherapy  for  hyper-
tensive patients with depression and/or anxiety improves 
both  psychological  symptoms  and  blood  pressure  [7]. 
Studies  on  psychotherapy  typically  focus  on  hyperten-
sive  patients  in  hospitals  with  severe  depression  and/or 
anxiety [8]. Only a few reports review the management of 
these hypertensive patients with depression and/or anxi-
ety in the community [9]. Despite the lack of studies, it is 
acknowledged that the majority of hypertensive patients 
with  depression  and/or  anxiety,  except  for  extremely 
severe  cases,  are  managed  at  the  community  level  in 
China  [10].  Hypertensive  patients  are  usually  managed 
with  a  cocktail  of  pharmacological  agents  to  control 
blood pressure; however, the outcomes may not be satis-
factory [11], partly due to medical non-compliance.

Mindfulness  has  been  used  for  self-regulation  of 
chronic pain since 1985 and has shown short- and long-
term improvements [12]. Hofmann and Gómez describe 
mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  and  mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy as “a combination of the essence 
of  Eastern  mindfulness-based  practices  with  Western 
cognitive-behavioral  practice”  [13].  The  three  compo-
nents  of  mindfulness-based  therapy  include  avoiding 
judgment,  enhancing  awareness,  and  focusing  on  the 
present  moment.  Paying  attention  to  the  present  helps 
individuals  to  process  their  cognitive,  physiological,  and 
behavioral  activities.  Such  modification  occurs  through 
the  regular  practice  of  mindfulness-based  activities, 
which makes individuals become aware not only of their 
daily activities but also of the automatic function of their 
mind in the past and future [14]. Interestingly, functional 
training  (TF),  which  has  similar  effects  to  mindfulness, 
can also reduce anxiety levels and improve poor lifestyle 
habits [15, 16].

The  standard  practice  for  mindfulness-based  therapy 
among  hypertensive  patients  is  a  group-based  program, 
including  daily  group  practice  and  quiet  individual 

practice  to  harmonize  their  thoughts,  emotions,  feel-
ings, and behaviours [17]. Global health has been devel-
oped  over  the  last  decade  to  improve  health  for  people 
in need at the global level, including mental health [18]. 
For  example,  mindfulness-based  therapy  has  become  a 
standardized treatment with rather impressive outcomes 
and  may  be  a  potential  non-pharmacological  alternative 
approach  to  managing  hypertension  in  the  community 
[19–21].  Mindfulness-based  therapy  provides  hyperten-
sive  patients  with  depression  and/or  anxiety  a  tool  to 
deal  with  their  negative  feelings  and  physical  symptoms 
through a relaxing approach, perhaps by increasing their 
threshold or reducing their sensitivity to problems [22].

We  aimed  to  evaluate  whether  mindfulness-based 
intervention can reduce psychological stress and, subse-
quently,  hypertension  among  hypertensive  patients  with 
depression and/or anxiety.

Methods
Participants

Using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale 
(PHQ-9)  [23],  the  sample  size  was  calculated  based  on 
the baseline or final score, which were set as 4.58 or 9.27, 
respectively, as the outcome indicators.

The  specific  calculation  formula  used  for  the  current 

study is as follows [24]:

N = 2(tα + tβ )2S2/2

Among, tα = 1.96, tβ = 1.64, S = 4.77, = 4.69

Therefore,  N≈26.81,  indicating  that  27  participants  in 
each of the intervention and control groups would need 
to be included, totalling 54 participants. Initially, 80 vol-
unteers  were  recruited,  but  only  60  participants  were 
involved in the trial.

We  recruited  60  participants  with  hypertension 
(defined as a mean awake ambulatory systolic or diastolic 
BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) and depression (PHQ-9 evaluation 
score ≥ 5) between August 2020 and October 2020. They 
were  recruited  from  referrals  by  physicians  and  posters 
in the local community surrounding Gem Flower Hospi-
tal, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China. Among these par-
ticipants,  depression  and  anxiety  levels  were  measured 
using the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-items) 
and GAD-7 scale (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 
items) to assess comorbid depression and/or anxiety. The 
study officially commenced on November 6th, 2020, and 
concluded  on  January  2nd,  2021,  comprising  a  total  of 
77 days of continuous intervention.

The  PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  scales  are  relatively  favoured 
for depression screening among individuals with depres-
sion  and/or  anxiety  due  to  their  simplicity  and  time

efficiency. We selected the PHQ-9 depression and GAD-7 
anxiety  scales  because  they  are  believed  to  possess  high 
reliability and validity and are widely used internationally 
as generic questionnaires for depression [25] and anxiety 
[26]. Therefore, in the current study, we chose the PHQ-9 
and  GAD-7  scales  to  evaluate  depression  and/or  anxi-
ety in participants, while participants’ mental health was 
also  assessed  through  a  simple  self-efficacy  scale.  This 
self-efficacy  scale,  which  has  been  widely  used  over  the 
last few decades [27], was adopted for the current study. 
The reliability and validity of the self-efficacy scale are as 
follows: the results for construct, convergent, and discri-
minant validity of the scale are good. Exploratory factor 
analysis  produced  eigenvalues  between  2.27  and  3.28, 
with the factors explaining a total cumulative variance of 
91.1%. Overall, the reliability and consistency of the self-
efficacy scale are good [28].

The  self-efficacy  scale  primarily  assesses  participants’ 
subjectivity,  initiative,  and  social  and  family  support, 
likely  reflecting  their  mental  health  and  the  importance 
of self-management for disease recovery [29].

Participants’  BP  was  measured  twice  daily  at  10  am 
and 2 pm using a mercury sphygmomanometer in a rela-
tively quiet state, with the average BP used for the current 
study.

The  effect  of  mindfulness-based  meditation  on  hyper-
tensive patients in the community in controlling BP fol-
lowing  10  weeks  of  intervention  was  evaluated,  with  a 
particular  focus  on  whether  such  intervention  could 
improve negative emotions in hypertensive patients. The 
current study adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki and 
has  been  approved  by  the  Human  Ethics  Committee  of 
Gansu Gem Flower Hospital (No. 201902)."

Study design and intervention

This  study  was  a  prospective,  double-blind  research 
(where  treatment  assignments  were  concealed  from 
those  who  organize  and  analyze  the  data)  randomized 
trial. A random number table was used to assign these 60 
participants into the mindfulness-based intervention and 
control groups (n = 30 each).

The recruited patients had comorbid hypertension and 
anxiety/generalized anxiety disorders. The control cohort 
received  a  2-h  lecture  weekly  on  general  information 
about  hypertension,  provided  by  specialized  cardiolo-
gists. In addition to the lectures, the intervention group 
also  received  weekly  education  on  mindfulness-based 
therapy  from  specialized  psychologists  in  hypertension 
mindfulness,  along  with  Tai  Chi  sessions  accompanied 
by  relaxing  background  music  and  post-session  consoli-
dation. The specific teaching contents of the mindfulness 
therapy and hypertension health education are presented 
in Table 1. The primary outcomes (depression and anxi-
ety scores) were assessed between the initial baseline and 
10 weeks after with or without mindfulness-based inter-
vention.  Secondary  outcomes,  such  as  systolic  or  dias-
tolic  blood  pressure  (BP)  and  self-efficacy  scores,  were 
also assessed between the initial baseline and 10 weeks of 
intervention for all participants. This data could provide 
objective value for evaluating the severity of stress and/or 
depression [30].

In this randomized controlled trial, we did not establish 
a  special  project  management  team;  however,  in  actual 
practice,  our  staff  assumed  the  responsibility  of  project 
management. Our staff held meetings during the partici-
pant  recruitment  period,  the  trial  period  (the  fifth  week 
of  the  trial),  and  the  data  collection  period  (weekly)  to 
review the RCT. The main contents of the review mainly 
included  assessing  whether  the  participants  met  the 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  reviewing  the  duration 
and  content  of  the  intervention,  ensuring  that  the  out-
come indicators were measured, and checking for errors 
or omissions in the collected data.

Measurement scales and scoring criteria

The initial baseline data in this study included age, educa-
tion level, marital status, BMI, duration of hypertension, 
presence  of  diabetes  mellitus,  systolic  blood  pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, depression score, anxiety score, 
and self-efficacy score.

The  PHQ-9  is  a  brief  and  self-explanatory  question-
naire,  serving  as  an  efficient  self-assessment  tool  for 
depression  based  on  the  American  Diagnostic  and  Sta-
tistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM  IV)  [31].  It 
comprises  9  items,  each  with  four  options:  "completely 
impossible," "several days," " > 1 week," and " ~ every day," 
with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 points, respec-
tively. The highest combined score is 27 points, reflecting 
the severity of depression. The PHQ-9 scoring system has 
been  reported  as  follows:  0–4  for  normal,  5–9  for  mild, 
10–19  for  moderate,  and  20–27  for  severe  depression 
[32].

The GAD-7, primarily applied to patients with chronic 
diseases  or  the  elderly  population,  is  considered  to  pos-
sess reliability and validity [33]. It was utilized to validate 
the PHQ-9 system. The GAD-7 scale consists of 7 items, 
with  the  highest  score  being  21  points.  Scores  of  0–4 
indicate normal anxiety, 5–9 indicate mild anxiety, 10–14 
indicate moderate anxiety, and 15–21 prompt for severe 
anxiety [34].

In  addition,  the  self-efficacy  scale  consists  of  6  items, 
with  scores  ranging  from  0  to  10,  measuring  perceived 
confidence in managing one’s health. A higher score indi-
cates a healthier psychological state.

Statistics

Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  SPSS  25.0  soft-
ware  (International  Business  Machines  Corporation). 

Measurement  data  that  followed  a  normal  distribution 
are  presented  as  mean ± SD  and  were  compared  using 
Student’s t-test. For data that did not follow a normal dis-
tribution, median and interquartile range [M (IQR)] were 
used, and comparison was made using the Wilcoxon rank 
sum test. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and power analy-
sis  were  conducted  to  compare  the  results  between  the 
two groups. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used for 
hypothesis testing.

Comparison of Intention to treat between two groups

To  avoid  selection  bias  and  maintain  comparability 
between  the  two  groups,  the  study  conducted  an  inten-
tion-to-treat (ITT) analysis using the PHQ-9 scale score 
as an outcome measure. Through ITT and power analy-
sis, significant differences were observed between the two 
groups  (χ2 = 29.433,  P < 0.0001,  χ2 = 30.583,  P < 0.0001) 
(Table 2).

Results
Participants flow

It  initially  recruited  80  volunteers,  of  whom  11  were 
excluded  for  the  reasons  stated  above.  Among  the 
remaining  69  participants,  8  declined  to  further  par-
ticipate,  and  1  had  a  history  of  antidepressant  medica-
tion.  Thus,  only  60  participants  were  finally  recruited 
for  the  current  study  with  informed  consent  (Fig.  1).

In  our  study,  we  found  that  a  10-week  mindfulness-

blood pressure may be attributed to the relaxation of an 
overactive  sympathetic  nervous  system  caused  by  long-
term stress. Additionally, while there was initially a minor 
reduction  in  anxiety  levels,  this  reduction  became  sig-
nificant  by  the  end  of  the  10-week  intervention.  These 
findings  suggest  that  mindfulness-based  therapy  has 
a  positive  effect  on  both  depression  and  anxiety,  with  a 
particular  emphasis  on  depression.  It’s  noteworthy  that 
hypertension  often  coexists  with  anxiety  and/or  depres-
sion.  Our  data  further  supports  a  proactive  approach  to 
mindfulness-based intervention, particularly in the early 
stages,  for  hypertensive  patients  predisposed  to  anxiety 
or depression, to minimize or reduce disease progression.
Effective  management  of  blood  pressure  (BP)  can 
reduce the incidence of depression [35], anxiety, and BP 
fluctuations.  Furthermore,  exercise  therapy  included  in 
mindfulness  therapy  can  lower  blood  pressure,  primar-
ily  by  helping  participants  adopt  healthy  lifestyle  hab-
its,  as  demonstrated  in  Oliveira’s  study  [36].  Therefore, 
intervention  for  depression  and/or  anxiety  is  an  impor-
tant  and  effective  auxiliary  in  managing  hypertensive 
patients with depression and/or anxiety. Our aim was to 
effectively  manage  BP  in  these  stressed  and  depressed 
patients.  Our  current  study  demonstrated  that  mind-
fulness  therapy  improved  the  level  of  depression  in  the 
patients.  We  observed  a  significant  reduction  in  sys-
tolic  BP  with  mindfulness-based  therapy,  in  addition

to  reductions  in  depression  and  anxiety,  compared  to 
the  conventional  approach  among  patients  in  the  com-
munity.  Our  findings  are  consistent  with  previous  stud-
ies  showing  that  mindfulness-based  therapy  can  reduce 
hypertension  [20]  or  stress  levels  among  in-hospital

patients  [35].  Interestingly,  we  observed  no  significant 
difference in diastolic BP between the mindfulness-based 
therapy group and the control group.

We recognize that stress and generalized anxiety disor-
der are not always identical or directly related. However, 
there are linkages between stress and generalized anxiety 
disorder,  with  chronic  stress  contributing  to  the  relapse 
of  generalized  anxiety  disorder  [37].  This  observation 
provides some explanation for our current finding, which 
suggests  that  mindfulness  intervention  appears  effective 
in  managing  hypertension,  as  well  as  reducing  anxiety 
and depression levels, despite the fact that stress was not 
the  primary  focus  of  the  study  [21].  Our  data  suggests 
that  mindfulness-based  therapy  is  more  effective  than 
simple health education in managing systolic BP and psy-
chological  stress  among  hypertensive  patients.  It  is  well 
known that systolic BP is closely related to both physical 
and  psychological  status  [38],  particularly  in  immediate 
responses.

Thus,  mindfulness-based  therapy  may  help  soothe  the 
minds  of  participants  with  high  stress  levels  and  sym-
pathetic  signaling  via  noradrenaline  [39].  This  specula-
tion  is  supported  by  Strandberg  and  Pitkala,  who  found 
positive  intervention  outcomes  for  hypertension  par-
ticipants  with  reduced  depression  [40].  In  our  study,  we 
did  not  observe  a  significant  reduction  in  diastolic  BP 
following  mindfulness-based  therapy  compared  to  the 
control.  Diastolic  BP,  reflecting  the  elasticity  of  arteries, 
is  not  easily  or  rapidly  modified,  even  with  strong  med-
ication  [41].  However,  while  there  may  not  be  a  signifi-
cant effect of mindfulness-based therapy on diastolic BP, 
we did observe an improving trend compared to that of 
the  healthy  educational  intervention  alone.  Conversely, 
systolic  BP  is  partially  regulated  by  environmental  tem-
perature  [42].  Seasonal  variations,  with  our  study  start-
ing  in  the  summer  and  drawing  comparisons  with  data 
collected in winter, may have had a partial impact on BP 
measurements  [43].  Our  participants  were  recruited  in 
early  autumn  (September)  and  completed  the  study  by 
winter  (February),  suggesting  seasonal  dependence.  We 
will investigate seasonal interference in future studies.

Our data demonstrated that the self-efficacy score and 
mental  health  state  of  participants  in  the  mindfulness-
based  group  were  significantly  higher  than  those  in  the 
control  group  after  intervention.  Affected  by  hyperten-
sion and poor mental state, participants experience vary-
ing  degrees  of  negative  psychological  emotions,  such  as 
anxiety and depression. These negative emotions not only 
impact  the  patient’s  compliance  with  treatment  but  also 
exacerbate  mental  stress,  further  contributing  to  mental 
deterioration,  creating  a  dangerous  cycle  [44].  Mindful-
ness-based therapy guides patients to manage themselves 
through  mindfulness  meditation,  helping  them  to 

observe the generation and dissolution of their own emo-
tions.  This  intervention  method  significantly  improves 
the  patient’s  attention  [45]  through  long-term  mindful-
ness meditation training. Consequently, the intervention 
enhances the patient’s mindfulness level, thereby further 
improving  the  participant’s  mental  health  in  a  positive 
feedback loop [46].

The  awareness  rate  mainly  refers  to  the  cognition 
or  opinion  of  an  objective  situation  or  fact,  especially 
regarding various health issues that require raising pub-
lic  awareness  [47].  There  was  a  significant  difference  in 
the awareness rate between the intervention and control 
groups, further supporting the effectiveness of the inter-
vention  for  managing  patients  with  comorbid  hyper-
tension  and  anxiety/generalized  anxiety  disorders.  Our 
current  findings  are  consistent  with  others,  showing 
that  mindfulness  intervention  appears  to  be  effective  in 
managing  hypertension,  as  well  as  reducing  anxiety  and 
depression  levels,  although  stress  was  not  the  focus  of 
the current study [21]. Our study demonstrated that after 
completing the dual intervention of mindfulness therapy 
and health education, the awareness rate of physical and 
mental  health  among  participants  in  the  intervention 
group increased significantly. Consequently, participants 
are better equipped to deal with blood pressure changes 
effectively,  in  addition  to  experiencing  improvements  in 
physical and mental health.

Following  the  intent-to-treat  analysis,  the  statistical 
power  of  the  trial  has  been  maintained,  despite  the  rel-
atively  low  number  of  patients  who  did  not  progress  to 
the final follow-up. The results showed that mindfulness 
therapy  has  a  beneficial  effect  following  clinical  applica-
tion.  We  observed  that  one  participant  in  the  interven-
tion group, who was in a state of mild depression but did 
not  complete  all  treatment  sessions,  experienced  a  sig-
nificant decrease in depression score and improved men-
tal  health.  Conversely,  Ma  et  al.  adhered  to  medication 
and  maintained  good  mental  health  [48].  In  the  control 
group,  two  participants  who  completed  all  hyperten-
sion  health  education  sessions  experienced  significantly 
decreased depression scores and improved mental health. 
Our data suggest that scientific and health education can 
improve the mental health of hypertension patients with 
depression/anxiety. However, a small number of patients 
did not achieve significant improvement, which warrants 
further study.
We  would 

like  to  emphasize  that  hypertensive 
patients  combined  with  depression  and  anxiety  have 
a  strong  impact  on  their  personal  lives,  in  addition  to 
incurring  significant  costs  for  medical  attention  and 
social  support.  Mindfulness  therapy  reduces  financial 
costs  as  well  as  adverse  effects  associated  with  medi-
cal  intervention.  Furthermore,  group  psychotherapy 

Zhang et al. Trials  (2024) 25:299

(mindful  therapy)  has  brought  convenience  with  the 
development  of  networks.  Among  patients  with  poor 
responses to drug treatment, the combined application 
of  mindfulness-based  cognitive  therapy  can  serve  as  a 
promotional model to alleviate symptoms of depression 
and anxiety in hypertensive patients.

There  are  several  limitations  in  the  present  study. 
The  random  numbers  generated  were  kept  in  opaque 
envelopes,  which  were  blinded  to  both  the  individu-
als organizing and analyzing the data. The intervention 
group was assigned to the West Campus of Gem Flower 
Hospital,  while  the  control  group  was  assigned  to  the 
East  Campus.  Although  this  approach  aimed  to  mini-
mize interference between the intervention and control 
individuals,  it  remains  a  limitation  in  the  double-blind 
RCT, which will be further investigated in the future.

Originally,  there  were  60  participants;  however, 
several  participants  were  withdrawn  from  either  the 
intervention  (four)  or  the  control  group  (one)  due  to 
physical  reasons  or  antidepressant  medication.  The 
study  started  in  September  (autumn)  and  was  com-
pleted  in  early  February  (winter)  of  2020,  which  could 
have  interfered  with  blood  pressure  (BP)  and  depres-
sion/anxiety  scores.  BP  and  depression/anxiety  scores 
may have been affected by the following reasons: Firstly, 
people typically engage in fewer outdoor activities and 
have fewer social connections in the winter [49], which 
can exacerbate anxiety and depression caused by home 
isolation.  This  could  lead  to  bias  in  the  detected  out-
comes  because  isolation  can  contribute  to  depression 
or anxiety [50], resulting in deteriorated mental health.

Secondly,  outcomes  might  be  affected  due  to  the 
impact  of  COVID-19.  Measures  and  public  awareness 
campaigns  about  COVID-19  were  stricter  and  more 
frequent  in  winter  [51,  52],  which  could  increase  peo-
ple’s  psychological  pressure.  The  participants  were 
from  one  community;  however,  future  studies  will  be 
conducted  across  multiple  community  health  centres. 
Additionally,  our  registry  protocol  was  retrospective; 
however,  during  program  implementation,  we  strictly 
followed  the  outcome  measures  and  reported  them. 
In  future  research,  we  will  conduct  multicentre,  large-
sample  intervention  studies  to  provide  more  clinical 
evidence for mindfulness-based interventions.

Conclusion
Mindfulness-based,  short-term  focused  interventions 
provide modest relief for depression and/or anxiety and 
are effective in lowering blood pressure and improving 
self-efficacy scores.
