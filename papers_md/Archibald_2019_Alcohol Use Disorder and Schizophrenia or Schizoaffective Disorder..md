Alcohol Use Disorder 
and Schizophrenia or 
Schizoaffective Disorder

Luke Archibald, Mary F. Brunette, Diana J. Wallin, and Alan I. Green 

Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders that cause significant disability. Among individuals who 
have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, alcohol use disorder 
(AUD) is common, and it contributes to worse outcomes than for those 
who do not have co-occurring substance use disorder. Common 
neurobiological mechanisms, including dysfunction in brain reward 
circuitry, may explain the high rates of co-occurrence of schizophrenia 
and AUD or other substance use disorders. Optimal treatment combines 
pharmacologic intervention and other therapeutic modalities to address 
both the psychotic disorder and AUD. Further research on the etiology of 
these co-occurring disorders and on treatment of affected individuals 
is needed.

Introduction

Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are heterogeneous psychotic 
disorders that often cause significant disability, with symptoms that 
include delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, and cognitive 
impairment.1 In schizoaffective disorder, the psychotic symptoms are 
present, along with mood episodes of depression or mania.2 People with 
these schizophrenia spectrum disorders have high rates of co-occurring 
substance use disorder, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). This 
article provides an updated review of the epidemiology, neurobiologic 
basis of co-occurrence, assessment, and treatment of people with 
co-occurring AUD and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Epidemiology

The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be about 
1%.1 The lifetime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is unknown,

in differentiating this disorder from other 
diagnoses, but it is believed to be less common than 
schizophrenia, with regional estimates between 
0.3% and 1.1%.2,3

Individuals with these psychotic disorders have 

three times the risk of heavy alcohol use relative 
to the general population.4,5 One meta-analysis of 
individuals with schizophrenia found a lifetime 
prevalence of AUD of 24.3%.6 One American 
study reported that 36.4% of 404 participants 
had experienced AUD before their first episode of 
psychosis.7 In both the general U.S. population 
and among people with schizophrenia, AUD is 
associated with male gender and Caucasian race.7 
For individuals who have schizophrenia, AUD is 
associated with depression, suicidality, medication 
nonadherence, chronic physical problems, 
homelessness, aggression, violence, incarceration, 
and high rates of hospitalization.7-10

Basis of Co-Occurrence

The genetic risk for schizophrenia has been 
fairly well-established. Heritability is estimated 
to be 80% to 85% for schizophrenia.11 Studies 
of twins have been a way to isolate genetic risk 
from environmental risk. The concordance rate, 
the likelihood that a second twin will receive a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia after the first twin, has 
been estimated at 41% to 65% for monozygotic 
and 0% to 28% for dizygotic twins.11 In addition, 
multiple genetic determinants of risk for 
schizophrenia (especially within neural systems) 
may contribute to the risk for both psychosis and 
addiction. For disorders such as schizophrenia 
that stem from variation at multiple genetic loci, 
the various risk alleles can be summed together to 
determine a polygenic risk score. Strong associations 
between substance use disorder, including AUD, 
and the polygenic risk score for schizophrenia 
indicate that shared genetic liability may contribute 
to the co-occurrence of these disorders.12 

Several polymorphisms (genetic variations) 

of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) protein correlate with co-occurring 
schizophrenia and alcohol dependence but not 
with alcohol dependence alone, suggesting that 
these polymorphisms may contribute to a specific 

e2 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

vulnerability to these co-occurring disorders.13 
Recently, a large genome-wide association study of 
individuals with alcohol dependence (diagnosed 
using the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) revealed 17 
traits, including schizophrenia, that had significant 
genetic correlations to alcohol dependence.14 These 
studies support the notion that certain genetic 
factors can lead to an increased risk for developing 
co-occurring schizophrenia and AUD. 

Several theories have emerged to explain the 
high prevalence of co-occurring schizophrenia and 
substance use disorder.8,15 Rosenthal first proposed 
the diathesis-stress model in 1970 to describe 
the combined interaction of a neurobiological 
vulnerability with an environmental vulnerability 
that leads to the development of schizophrenia.16 
This theory is also called the “two-hit” model. For 
the development of schizophrenia and AUD, for 
example, the two hits could be a genetic risk for 
schizophrenia combined with alcohol drinking 
during adolescence. Although alcohol use in 
adolescence predicts future co-occurring mental 
health disorders and substance use disorder, 
adolescent exposure to alcohol was not found to 
be associated with the age of onset of psychosis.17 
A variant of the two-hit model is the cumulative 
risk factor hypothesis, which posits that among 
people with schizophrenia, the increased risk for 
developing substance use disorder stems from the 
added risks of poor cognitive development, poor 
social functioning, effects of poverty, and poor 
social environments.1 

Another theory explaining the high rate of 

substance use disorder among individuals who have 
schizophrenia is the self-medication hypothesis, 
which suggests that people use substances to 
find relief from symptoms or in an effort to 
decrease side effects that arise from antipsychotic 
treatments.18 Although clinically plausible, this 
theory has not been supported by research. Studies 
indicate that negative symptoms are not necessarily 
elevated in individuals with schizophrenia and 
substance use disorder, and that among young 
people who experienced first-episode psychosis, 
substance use disorder often developed before the 
use of medications.7,19

In 2018, Khokhar and colleagues reviewed the 

unifying hypothesis that the co-occurrence of 
schizophrenia and substance use disorder may 

relate to a dysregulation of the mesocorticolimbic 
reward system in the brain.15 Sometimes 
called the primary addiction hypothesis20 or 
reward deficiency syndrome,21 this circuit-level 
dysregulation has been studied using functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). People 
with co-occurring schizophrenia and nicotine 
dependence have been shown to have reductions 
in resting-state connectivity between the 
insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, and 
people with co-occurring schizophrenia and 
cannabis use disorder have been shown to have a 
hypoconnectivity between the nucleus accumbens 
and frontal cortical regions.22,23 Moreover, studies 
using task-based fMRI have reported dysfunction 
in the ventral striatum.24

The neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia 

suggests that an early insult in brain development 
may lead to onset of symptoms of schizophrenia 
in late adolescence or early adulthood.25 This 
theory led to the development of a putative animal 
model of schizophrenia—the neonatal ventral 
hippocampal lesion (NVHL) model. In this 
model, rats receive small, bilateral, hippocampal 
lesions at the end of the first week of life, and in 
adulthood they display many of the memory and 
social deficits associated with schizophrenia.26 This 
line of research is also promising for co-occurring 
substance use disorder, since NVHL rats consume 
more substances than their control group 
counterparts, and, after access to alcohol during 
adolescence, they drink more alcohol as adults.27 
Thus, the NVHL rat may be a promising model 
for studying changes in the reward circuits of the 
brain among individuals who have schizophrenia 
and AUD, and for identifying potential therapeutic 
targets for those who have schizophrenia and 
co-occurring substance use disorder. 

Although models of co-occurring AUD or 
substance use disorder and schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder continue to evolve, 
understanding the basis of the co-occurrence 
may inform treatment approaches, especially 
pharmacologic treatment for the co-occurring 
disorders. Moreover, regardless of the model, it 
appears that AUD or substance use disorder and 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are linked. 
Thus, treatment for such co-occurring disorders 
must address both the psychotic symptoms and the 
alcohol or other substance misuse.

Assessment, Treatment, 
and Prognosis

Given the high rates of co-occurring AUD among 
individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder, as well as the clear evidence that such 
use can worsen the course of the psychotic 
disorder, diagnostic assessment for any individual 
presenting with symptoms of psychosis should 
include screening for alcohol and other substance 
use. In emergency departments, consideration of 
possible substance-induced psychosis is important. 
In one study, 18.9% of those with a diagnosis of 
substance-induced psychosis had alcohol as the 
primary substance.28 In 39.6% of cases, alcohol was 
used with cocaine or cannabis. 

Because alcohol can precipitate psychotic 

symptoms during acute intoxication, withdrawal, 
or chronic use, obtaining a detailed history 
and creating a timeline of periods of psychotic 
symptoms and substance use can help clinicians 
differentiate between substance-induced psychosis 
and a primary psychotic disorder. Individuals with 
psychotic disorders may not be able or willing to 
provide these details of their history, particularly 
during periods of symptom exacerbation. 
Therefore, collecting information from collateral 
sources, such as family members, is often necessary. 
For initial evaluations and assessments of treatment 
response, laboratory examinations, such as testing 
for ethyl glucuronide, can provide useful evidence 
of recent alcohol use.29 

Treatment for substance-induced psychosis 

focuses on acute management, often with 
reduced stimulation, in a supportive, abstinent 
environment, and sometimes with short-term 
antipsychotic treatment. Once an individual 
becomes abstinent and withdrawal has resolved, 
psychotic symptoms also usually resolve, but 25% 
of cases may persist, resulting in diagnoses of 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders.30 By contrast, 
treatment for individuals who have primary 
psychotic disorders with co-occurring AUD usually 
requires long-term antipsychotic medication and 
psychosocial interventions, in addition to other 
interventions for AUD noted in this section. 
Moreover, for individuals with co-occurring AUD 
and psychotic disorders, both disorders should 
be treated simultaneously. Thus, comprehensive 

Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder | e3

treatment—combining medication with behavioral 
and psychosocial interventions—is appropriate. 

Pharmacologic treatment

This section reviews the evidence for the efficacy of 
medications used to treat AUD in individuals who 
have co-occurring schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder. In addition, this section includes a review 
of the effects of antipsychotic medications on 
alcohol intake among individuals who have these 
co-occurring disorders. 

AUD medication implications for schizophrenia 
or schizoaffective disorder

Several studies have examined the safety and efficacy 
of medications (i.e., naltrexone, disulfiram, and 
acamprosate) used to treat AUD in individuals 
with co-occurring schizophrenia and AUD.31 In 
a small, randomized controlled trial of patients 
with schizophrenia and AUD, those treated with 
naltrexone reported significantly fewer drinking 
days, fewer heavy-drinking days, and less craving, as 
compared to those receiving placebo.32 In a small, 
open-label study of naltrexone administered to 
individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 
investigators found improvements in various measures 
of alcohol intake, as well as in psychotic symptoms.33 
Another study of patients with serious mental 

illnesses, including schizophrenia, compared 
naltrexone and disulfiram individually and 
in combination with placebo.34 In this study, 
participants who received active medication had 
better alcohol use outcomes than those who received 
placebo. However, the majority of participants with 
a psychotic spectrum disorder had a diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder, limiting the potential applicability 
for individuals who have schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder. 

No known studies have assessed extended-release 
naltrexone for AUD in a population that includes 
individuals with psychotic disorders. However, given 
the cognitive and executive dysfunction associated 
with schizophrenia, this formulation (injectable with 
slow release and gradual absorption over 4 weeks) of 
naltrexone may have potential benefits for increasing 
medication adherence. 

A small, randomized controlled trial examined the 

use of acamprosate for individuals with psychotic 

e4 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

disorders.35 In that study, all participants reduced 
drinking, and there was no difference between 
acamprosate and placebo in increasing the number of 
consecutive days of abstinence. 

Theoretically, disulfiram has a risk of worsening 
psychosis in predisposed individuals because of its 
action of inhibiting dopamine beta-hydroxylase, 
but this phenomenon appears to be rare in clinical 
practice.36 Other than the study that compared 
naltrexone, disulfiram, or a combination of 
naltrexone and disulfiram, no known randomized 
controlled trials have examined disulfiram among 
individuals with psychotic disorders. However, in a 
chart review of 33 patients treated with disulfiram 
who had a diagnosis of alcoholism and also had 
severe mental illness, 64% experienced remission 
of the alcoholism for at least 1 year during a 3-year 
follow-up period.37 

Few studies have examined use of other 
medications for off-label treatment of AUD in 
individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. 
For example, the effects of topiramate on alcohol 
outcomes have not been studied in this population, 
although it has been used to potentially control 
weight in people with schizophrenia.38 There is some 
evidence that the mood stabilizer valproic acid may 
reduce alcohol consumption in a population that 
has dual diagnoses, which may have relevance for 
treating individuals with schizoaffective disorder. 
Specifically, in a randomized controlled trial of 
valproic acid versus placebo, in addition to treatment 
as usual, individuals with bipolar I disorder and 
alcohol dependence demonstrated a significantly 
smaller proportion of heavy-drinking days and 
a trend toward fewer drinks per heavy-drinking 
day.39 However, no known trials have examined 
valproic acid in a population of individuals with 
schizophrenia and AUD. 

Varenicline, which has been approved by the U.S. 

Food and Drug Administration for the treatment 
of nicotine use disorder, has been shown to decrease 
alcohol consumption among participants with 
AUD.40 However, the only study of this medication 
in patients with schizophrenia and AUD reported 
poor tolerability.41 Benzodiazepines, although useful 
for treating alcohol withdrawal and as adjunctive 
agents for acute manic episodes, are not effective 
for treatment of AUD and are associated with 
worse outcomes, including risk of overdose when 
combined with alcohol.

In summary, although few studies have examined 

the effects of medications (i.e., naltrexone, 
disulfiram, and acamprosate) that treat AUD among 
individuals with psychotic disorders, evidence of the 
safety and potential benefit is sufficient to encourage 
increased use in this population (see Table 1).

Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
medication implications for AUD

The choice of medication for treating psychotic 
or affective symptoms in people with psychotic 
disorders may have implications for alcohol 
consumption. First-generation antipsychotic 
medications do not appear to decrease alcohol use 
and actually may increase substance use and craving 
in people with schizophrenia and co-occurring 
substance use disorder.42 Long-acting injectable 
formulations of second-generation antipsychotics, 
as well as clozapine, a novel second-generation 
antipsychotic, may be preferred.

A hypothetical framework has been delineated 
that supports the use of clozapine to ameliorate the 
brain circuit dysfunction experienced by people 
with schizophrenia and substance use disorder and 
is related to clozapine’s weak dopamine D2 receptor 
blockade coupled with its noradrenergic effects.21,43 
Some evidence supports the superiority of clozapine 
for people who have schizophrenia and AUD.43 In a 
naturalistic, prospective study that followed patients 
with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
and co-occurring substance use disorder, a larger 
proportion of individuals receiving clozapine, versus 
those taking another atypical antipsychotic, achieved 
remission from AUD.44 During the following 
year, the participants who were in remission and 
were being treated with clozapine had lower rates 
of relapse to substance use than participants who 
were treated with other antipsychotics.45 Additional 
evidence from chart reviews and retrospective studies 
(see Table 2) favors the use of clozapine over other 
atypical antipsychotics.46

Individuals (N = 31) with schizophrenia and co-occurring 
alcohol abuse or dependence* were treated with 
naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo, in addition to neuroleptic 
medication, for a 12-week, randomized controlled trial.

Participants treated with naltrexone, compared to those who 
received placebo, had significantly fewer drinking days and 
fewer heavy-drinking days (defined as more than five drinks), 
and they reported less craving.

Individuals (N = 254) with alcohol dependence* and 
heterogeneous psychiatric disorders were treated with 
disulfiram and naltrexone alone and in combination. They 
also received intensive psychosocial treatment during the 
12-week, randomized controlled trial.

Individuals with a psychotic spectrum disorder who received 
an active medication had better alcohol use outcomes 
when compared with those who received placebo. Neither 
disulfiram nor naltrexone nor the combination had a 
clear advantage.

In this retrospective review, individuals (N = 33) with 
alcohol abuse or dependence* and severe mental illness 
had been treated with disulfiram.

At a 3-year follow-up, 64% of individuals experienced 
remission of alcohol abuse or dependence* for at 
least 1 year.

Individuals (N = 23) with a diagnosis of alcohol 
dependence* and co-occurring schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder, or nonspecified psychosis 
received acamprosate or placebo in a randomized 
controlled trial.

All participants reduced drinking. Acamprosate was not 
superior to placebo in increasing consecutive days of 
abstinence. Participants who received acamprosate reported 
significantly fewer obsessive thoughts of drinking than those 
who received placebo.

Individuals (N = 59) with bipolar I disorder and alcohol 
dependence* received either valproate or placebo in 
a randomized controlled trial. All participants received 
treatment as usual (which included lithium). 

The group that received valproate had a significantly smaller 
proportion of heavy-drinking days and a trend toward fewer 
drinks per heavy-drinking day when compared to the group 
that received placebo. 

Individuals (N = 55) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder and concurrent alcohol and nicotine 
dependence* received varenicline or placebo in a pilot, 
8-week, randomized controlled trial.

Because of safety concerns or loss to follow-up, only 
10 participants started the study. Five received varenicline 
and five received placebo. Adverse gastrointestinal effects 
such as severe abdominal pain limited study completion to 
four participants.

*Study used the classifications of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence as defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder | e5

Long-acting injectable formulations of 

antipsychotics may help improve adherence or 
clarify when nonadherence is present, which may be 
particularly relevant in a dual-diagnosis population. 
In a randomized controlled trial comparing oral 
and long-acting injectable risperidone treatment 
for individuals with schizophrenia and AUD, heavy 
drinking worsened over time for those in the oral 
risperidone group compared to those treated with 
the long-acting injectable formulation.47 However, 
another study comparing long-acting injectable 
versus oral risperidone did not find differences in 
alcohol use outcomes between the two groups.48 
Lastly, a randomized, open-label, review board–
blinded study comparing once-monthly paliperidone 
palmitate to daily oral antipsychotics examined 
real-world outcomes for participants, a majority of 
whom had a diagnosis of co-occurring substance use 
disorder.49 This trial demonstrated the superiority of 

long-acting injectable paliperidone, including for the 
primary outcome of time to first treatment failure. 
Other second-generation antipsychotics that 
do not have potent dopamine D2 blockade may 
have theoretical benefit over typical antipsychotic 
medications, although evidence in prospective 
controlled trials is limited. It has been postulated 
that the unique mechanism of action of aripiprazole 
(a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A 
receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors) 
may have beneficial effects for alcohol use.50 
Uncontrolled trials provide support for use of 
aripiprazole among people who have co-occurring 
schizophrenia and cocaine or tobacco use disorder 
but not co-occurring schizophrenia and AUD.51 
Quetiapine, which weakly blocks dopamine D2 
receptors, has support from small, open-label trials 
that showed reductions in alcohol use.52 However, 
no randomized controlled trials of these medications

outcomes were examined.

e6 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

A larger proportion of participants who received clozapine, 
versus those taking a different atypical antipsychotic, 
achieved remission from AUD (79% vs. 34%). Participants in 
remission who had been treated with clozapine had lower 
rates of relapse to substance use (8%) than those treated 
with other antipsychotics (40%).

Abstinence rates were significantly higher for participants 
treated with clozapine than for those treated with risperidone 
(54% vs. 13%, p = .05).

In the group that received risperidone by mouth, heavy 
drinking significantly worsened over time (p = .024). A slight 
difference between groups was shown for change in the 
number of heavy-drinking days per week, with the long-acting 
injection group showing a small decrease (p = .054). The 
long-acting injection group had significantly fewer drinking 
days per week than the by-mouth group (p = .035).

Patients treated with long-acting injectable risperidone and 
those treated with by-mouth risperidone had no difference in 
alcohol use outcomes.

Results demonstrated superiority of long-acting injectable 
paliperidone, including for the outcome of time to first 
treatment failure.

occurring schizophrenia and AUD. 

Psychotherapeutic and 
psychosocial interventions 

Chronic psychotic illness is often accompanied 
by cognitive deficits and diminished executive 
functioning, which may be worsened by the effects 
of alcohol in those who have co-occurring AUD. 
Therefore, integrated and tailored care for both the 
psychotic disorder and AUD can improve access to 
care, deliver consistent messages about treatment and 
recovery, provide interventions that support attempts 
to reduce substance use, and manage behavioral 
health conditions.53 

Group therapy using cognitive behavioral therapy, 
motivational enhancement therapy, or contingency 
management has a role in treating AUD and 
co-occurring schizophrenia.54,55 Considerations for 
this particular population include using active and 
ongoing motivation enhancement approaches and 
modifying cognitive behavioral therapy to account 
for cognitive, interpersonal, and motivational 
deficits that commonly occur among people with 
schizophrenia.29 

Contingency management involves agreed 
on, immediate, tangible rewards to reinforce 
positive behaviors, such as treatment attendance 
or abstinence that has been verified by biologic 
measures. Such a management strategy for alcohol 
abstinence has been shown to be effective for people 
who have schizophrenia or other serious mental 
illness and who also have AUD. For example, one 
study demonstrated that participants who received 
contingency management intervention were 
3.1 times more likely than participants from the 
control group to have a negative result on a urine 
test for the alcohol biomarker ethyl glucuronide.56 
Also, these participants were more likely to attain 
1.5 weeks of additional alcohol abstinence during 
a 12-week trial as compared to participants in the 
control group.

More intensive interventions, including assertive 

community treatment (ACT) and residential 
programs, may benefit individuals with co-occurring 
schizophrenia and AUD. ACT is the most widely 
tested model of community care for people 
with severe mental illness. ACT consists of an 
interdisciplinary team (i.e., the psychiatrist, social 

workers, nurses, occupational therapists, and peer 
support) with a low participant-to-staff ratio. This 
team provides a range of comprehensive services, 
including community outreach, 24-hour availability 
for emergency communication, and integrated 
pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments 
for substance use disorder. For people with dual 
disorders, faithful implementation of and adherence 
to the ACT model is associated with superior 
outcomes in substance use, including significantly 
fewer days of alcohol and drug use.57 Residential 
programs that integrate treatment for mental health 
and substance use disorders can be effective and 
may be especially indicated for individuals who are 
homeless or have had suboptimal response to other 
interventions.53 

Alcoholics Anonymous is underused among 
individuals with co-occurring AUD and psychotic 
disorders, although this population has unique 
considerations. People who have psychotic disorders 
benefit from the education and support they receive 
by attending and processing 12-step meetings, but 
people who have acute psychosis may not be able to 
tolerate these meetings.58 Dual Recovery Anonymous 
(Double Trouble or Double Trouble in Recovery) 
is a 12-step program tailored for individuals with 
co-occurring mental illness and substance use 
disorder. Evidence shows higher rates of abstinence, 
better adherence to psychiatric medication, and 
improved personal functioning for people who 
attended dual-focused groups as compared to those 
who attended Alcoholics Anonymous.59 

Future Research Directions

Additional research related to co-occurring AUD and 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder is needed. 
Environmental factors, including substance use, that 
contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia 
continue to be investigated. Prospective longitudinal 
markers of neurobiological function in adolescence 
before onset of psychotic symptoms and alcohol 
consumption could further elucidate the etiology of 
these disorders. Moreover, further development of 
evidence-based interventions to address alcohol and 
other substance use in adolescents before and during 
first-episode psychosis is required. Lastly, additional 
investigations into the efficacy of various treatment 
modalities are necessary, particularly because
