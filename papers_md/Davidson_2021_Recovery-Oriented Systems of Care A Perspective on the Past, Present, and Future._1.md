This paper provides a perspective on the recent concept of recovery-oriented systems of 
care with respect to its origins in the past and its status in the present, prior to considering 
directions in which such systems might move in the future. Although influential in practice, 
this concept has yet to be evaluated empirically and has not been the object of a review. 
Recovery-oriented systems of care emerged from the efforts of persons with mental health 
and/or substance use disorders who advocated for services to go beyond the reduction 
of symptoms and substance use to promote a life in the community. Subsequent efforts 
were made to delineate the nature and principles of such services and those required 
of a system of such care. Coincident with the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration dropping reference to behavioral health in its revised definition of 
recovery, confusions and limitations began to emerge. Recovery appeared to refer more 
to a process of self-actualization for which an individual is responsible than to a process 
of healing from the effects of a behavioral health condition and associated stigma. In 
response, some systems are aiming to address social determinants of behavioral health 
conditions that transcend the scope of the individual and to develop a citizenship-oriented 
approach to promote community inclusion.

This perspective focuses on the relatively recent 
topic of recovery-oriented systems of care; 
although influential in practice, this concept has 
yet to be evaluated empirically and thus cannot 

yet be the object of a review. In lieu of such 
evidence, this article offers one perspective on 
the origins of this concept and its present status 
prior to considering possible directions in which 

1

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021such systems might move in the future. In the 
process, areas in which research is especially 
needed are highlighted to evaluate the utility of 
this concept in meeting its stated aim of moving 
behavioral health systems of care beyond an 
acute care model to better meet the needs of 
persons with prolonged mental illness and/or 
substance use disorder (SUD). Throughout 
this perspective, “substance use” refers to both 
alcohol use and other drug use. 

This story begins with the decade between 
2000 and 2010, which saw a flurry of activity 
at the federal level in the United States focused 
on defining what was then the relatively new 
concept of recovery in both mental health and 
substance use. Although other concepts of 
recovery may be as old as the treatment and 
study of mental health (e.g., Phillippe Pinel 
and moral treatment)1 and SUD (e.g., 12-step 
tradition),2 the term was given new meanings 
in the 1980s and 1990s through the consumer/
survivor movement in mental health3 and 
the new recovery advocacy movement in 
substance use.4 These new definitions were then 
operationalized in terms of their implications for 
transforming mental health and SUD services to 
promote these new forms of recovery. At least 
two central arguments for the shift to recovery 
and recovery-oriented care were consistent 
across the mental health and substance use 
divide.

First, there was a growing recognition 
that although full (“clinical”) recovery was 
possible following an acute episode of a mental 
or substance use disorder for some people, a 
more personal sense of recovery—involving a 
process of learning how to manage daily life 
in the presence of, or within the limitations 
imposed by, an ongoing disorder—was required 
and appropriate for others. Second, there 
was a parallel recognition that mental health 
and substance use services were primarily 
oriented to providing acute care that targeted, 
and hopefully lessened, signs and symptoms 
of mental disorder and substance use while 
paying considerably less attention to promoting 

functioning and living a full, meaningful life in 
the community of one’s choice.

This perspective considers the implications 
of these two arguments for transforming mental 
health and substance use services under the 
broad vision of recovery-oriented systems of 
care, which has since been developed with 
support from the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). 
In addition to describing the initial steps taken 
during the 2000–2010 decade, this article 
considers the current status of additional 
efforts made between 2010 and 2020, prior to 
offering possible strategies to overcome some 
of the confusions and limitations that have 
been identified within the context of efforts to 
implement this ambitious vision. In the absence 
of empirical studies of this relatively new 
way of organizing behavioral health care, this 
perspective uses as a case study the evolution 
of mental health and substance use services 
in Connecticut, which was the first state in 
the country to envision and attempt to achieve 
a recovery-oriented system of care that both 
integrates mental health and substance use 
services and reorients them to promoting the new 
senses of recovery articulated by the recovery 
community itself.5,6 Given that recovery-oriented 
systems of care emphasize prevention, health 
promotion, and outreach to, and inclusion of, 
persons with multiple conditions, no recovery-
oriented system of care to date has specifically 
targeted persons solely with alcohol use disorder. 

THE PAST: 2000–2010

The concept of recovery has been pushed to the 
forefront of behavioral health policy and practice 
in the United States (and elsewhere) over the last 
3 decades largely through the advocacy efforts 
of people with behavioral health disorders rather 
than through advances in the effectiveness of 
new psychiatric medications or an accumulating 
body of research on clinical improvements or 
positive outcomes in the treatment of SUD.7 
Before it referred to innovations in practice, 

2

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021recovery referred to the right of people with 
behavioral health conditions to “live, work, 
learn, and participate fully in the community.”8 
Based most recently on the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 19909—but grounded in 
30 years of consistent federal law preceding it 
(e.g., the Rehabilitation Act of 1973)10—this right 
cannot be made contingent on improvements in 
the person’s clinical or functional status, nor can 
it be delayed indefinitely based on a system’s 
lack of resources to support community tenure. 
Persons with behavioral health disorders have 
a right to live in the community alongside their 
peers and to participate in the treatment and 
rehabilitative interventions and make use of the 
community supports they need to manage their 
behavioral health conditions and pursue their 
own life goals. The challenge for a recovery-
oriented system of care is to carry out this work 
in the most efficient and effective, and the 
least coercive and restrictive, manner possible, 
respecting the dignity and autonomy of clients 
while ensuring the safety and well-being of the 
broader community. 

To guide these efforts, SAMHSA first 
held consensus development conferences 
separately for the mental health and substance 
use communities. The agency later brought 
them together around 2010 to come up with an 
integrated definition, reviewed below. It is worth 
citing the initial definitions, however, to get a 
sense of the direction in which SAMHSA was 
moving during the first decade of the 2000s. 
As defined by the 2004 National Consensus 
Statement on Mental Health Recovery, “Mental 
health recovery is a journey of healing and 
transformation enabling a person with a mental 
health problem to live a meaningful life in a 
community of his or her choice while striving 
to achieve his or her full potential.”11 “Recovery 
from alcohol and drug problems,” on the 
other hand, was defined in a 2005 SAMHSA 
consensus statement as “a process of change 
through which an individual achieves abstinence 
and improved health, wellness, and quality of 
life.”12 These definitions can be seen for the most 

part as compatible, the only real difference being 
that one focuses on mental health problems and 
the other on alcohol and drug problems.

While it is clear from these definitions that 
this form of recovery is viewed as a process in 
which the person must be actively engaged, they 
hold implications for the nature of behavioral 
health treatment and supports as well. In other 
words, although a person needs to engage in 
their own recovery, making use of recovery-
oriented services and supports can be one 
element of one’s personal recovery efforts. 
This notion was first introduced in 2000, when 
Anthony published an important paper, “A 
recovery-oriented service system: Setting some 
system level standards.”13 This article laid out 
the argument for what standards should be 
used in evaluating treatments and community 
supports as to their recovery-orientation—that 
is, the degree to which the services and supports 
offered are aimed at promoting this new vision of 
recovery as the person’s living a meaningful life, 
achieving one’s full potential, and improving 
one’s health and wellness in the presence of a 
behavioral health problem. Building on these 
efforts, in 2002 Connecticut became the first 
state behavioral health authority to adopt a 
commissioner’s policy on promoting a recovery-
oriented system of care. In this early stage, such 
a system was defined as one “that identifies and 
builds on each individual’s assets, strengths, 
and areas of health and competence to support 
each person in achieving a sense of mastery over 
mental illness and/or SUD while regaining his or 
her life and a meaningful, constructive sense of 
membership in the broader community.”14

Expanding upon these and similar efforts 
around the country, in 2010, SAMHSA came out 
with its own definition of a recovery-oriented 
system of care: “a coordinated network of 
community-based services and supports that 
is person-centered and builds on the strengths 
and resiliencies of individuals, families, and 
communities to achieve improved health, 
wellness, and quality of life for those with or 

3

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021at risk for mental health and substance use 
problems.”15 SAMHSA’s vision of a recovery-
oriented system of care encompasses a menu of 
individualized, person-centered, and strength-
based services within a self-defined network. 
This menu includes clinical services and 
alternative therapies (such as acupuncture and 
meditation) as well as recovery support services. 
Recovery support services include peer recovery 
coaching and other forms of peer support, peer-
run programs, recovery community centers, 
employment and educational assistance, social 
and family support, childcare, care management, 
and housing support. It also provides individuals 
and families with more options with which to 
make informed decisions regarding their care; is 
designed to be accessible, welcoming, and easy 
to navigate; involves people in recovery, their 
families and allies, and the broader community 
to continually improve access to and quality of 
services; and supports the premise that there are 
many pathways to recovery.

Finally, recovery-oriented systems of 
care have been the focus of various technical 
assistance resources issued by SAMHSA, in 
which such systems are described as adhering 
to a list of principles and as serving specific 
functions.15-18 But what does such a system 
actually look like? Based on the stages of 
change model first introduced into treatment 
of substance use, the overarching principle for 
design of this system and its various components 
is that people should be able to access effective 
and responsive services and supports regardless 
of where they are in the process of recovery 
from SUD, mental illness, or both combined. 
Realizing that substance use and mental health 
disorders frequently co-occur, this model further 
allows for a person to be in different stages with 
respect to each of the conditions they may have. 
Most importantly, being unaware of, or choosing 
not to accept having, a behavioral health 
condition is to be viewed as a point of departure 
for treatment, rehabilitation, and support 
efforts as opposed to being viewed as cause for 
discharge from care. Based also on the input of 

people who are in recovery, this model places 
central emphasis on the role of recovery support 
services, including services provided by peers, at 
each point along the continuum of care. 

It could be argued that within a recovery-
oriented system of care, all services should be 
supportive of recovery. The term “recovery 
support services” has been used, however, 
to refer more specifically to a subgroup of 
interventions—particularly those that focus on 
enhancing a person’s abilities and resources, or 
recovery capital, to manage their own behavioral 
health condition(s) and/or to increase their 
participation in the community activities of 
their choice.18,19 Importantly, these services and 
resources are to be offered to persons entering 
recovery prior to (as well as during and after) 
any expectations that they accept and benefit 
from active treatment rather than being reserved 
as rewards for doing so. People may need a 
basic amount of recovery capital to be able to 
make effective use of such treatments, whether 
medication or psychosocial. Finally, recovery 
support services are often provided by people 
who are in recovery themselves, but do not need 
to be exclusively so. Being a relatively recent 
development and given their central role in 
knitting such systems of care together, recovery 
support services will be an especially important 
topic for future research.

As shown in Figure 1, these services and 
supports also can be used during various stages 
of recovery and are conceptualized with a 
recovery management model, in which they 
assertively strive, according to White and Kelly, 
to “enhance early pre-recovery engagement, 
recovery initiation, long-term recovery 
maintenance, and the quality of personal/family 
life in long-term recovery.”20 The stages span 
from recovery priming (i.e., having experiences 
that prepare the person to make the decision 
to pursue recovery), to recovery initiation and 
stabilization, to recovery management and, 
finally, recovering one’s full citizenship as a 
valued member of one’s community. This model 
has been developed based on the arguments cited 

4

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021in the introduction: that is, that many substance 
use disorders, like many mental illnesses, 
are prolonged rather than acute in nature, 
calling for services and supports to be offered 
to persons over longer periods of time and 
consistent with where they may be in recovery 
at the time. According to White and Kelly,20 
this model thus involves focused attention at 
several points along a continuum of care and 
across levels and components of the system 
that is managed by an overall integrated mental 
health and substance use authority (whether at 
the local, regional, or state level), including the 
following: (1) public education and prevention; 
(2) continuity of contact over a sustained
period of time; (3) patient/family education and
empowerment to promote self-management of
the condition (including mobilization of family
resources); (4) access to the latest advances in
medication-assisted treatment; (5) access to peer-
based recovery support groups and advocacy
organizations; and (6) sustained monitoring

(checkups), recovery coaching, and when 
needed, early re-intervention.

As can be seen in this figure, the continuum of 
care begins with public education, prevention, and 
mental health promotion. Then, for those who do 
not seek care on their own, assertive outreach and 
engagement efforts can take place anywhere—from 
the streets to faith communities, college campuses, 
and workplace settings—reaching out to people 
in distress or need wherever they might be found. 
At this point, recovery support services can be 
introduced to overcome barriers to access to care, 
to offer environments supportive of recovery, or to 
help to increase the person’s recovery capital so that 
treatment, when accessed, can be fully effective. 
These kinds of recovery support should be available 
to persons in recovery throughout the remainder of 
their journey, either in different forms depending 
on the stage of change (e.g., case management until 
the person has established a firm foundation for 
recovery) or in a consistent form depending on 
the person’s choice (e.g., 12-step group, recovery

active treatment (e.g., detox/inpatient, intensive 
outpatient, outpatient), support is available for 
ongoing monitoring (e.g., wellness checkups) and 
early reintervention as needed. This continuum 
of care is developed in collaboration with a wide 
range of stakeholder partners, including education 
and faith community leaders, police and criminal 
justice representatives, business owners and other 
employers, family members and allies, and, perhaps 
most important, representatives of the recovery 
community itself. 

THE PRESENT: 2010–2020

Such was the vision put forth beginning around 
2000 as new meanings of recovery began to take 
hold, along with implications for transforming 
services, supports, and systems of care. And 
much progress has been made in the past 20 years 
in bringing this vision to life. Public education, 
including school-based efforts, have begun to 
address the roles of stigma and discrimination as 
barriers to access to care and to recovery, including 
the role of medications in the treatment of both 
mental illness and SUD. Inroads have been made 
into faith communities and onto college campuses 
to promote behavioral health and to increase 
access to needed services and supports. Increasing 
numbers of highly visible role models of recovery 
have disclosed their own struggles with mental 
illness and/or SUD and encouraged their followers 
and fans to know that help is available and how to 
ask for it. An expanding array of recovery support 
services are being offered and are beginning to 
be shown useful in increasing access to and the 
effectiveness of care.21-24 So, other than continuing 
to follow this blueprint in building systems of 
recovery-oriented care, what remains to be done?

Unfortunately, over the last 10 years, confusion 

has arisen and limitations have been identified 
related to these notions of recovery and recovery-
oriented care, threatening further progress toward 
a recovery orientation and with the potential, 
perhaps, to turn the clock backward. Although 
this confusion and these limitations do not stem 

directly from the more recent SAMHSA definition 
of recovery, they nonetheless seem to be best 
captured in the differences between the initial 
definitions cited above and the integrated version 
issued as a working definition in 2012. Hoping to 
integrate mental health and substance use services 
under a single umbrella, SAMHSA initiated 
another consensus development process in 2010 
that involved representatives from both recovery 
communities and other stakeholders; this resulted in 
the following working definition of recovery from 
mental illness and/or SUD: Recovery is “a process 
of change through which individuals improve their 
health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and 
strive to reach their full potential.”25 Possibly due to 
pushback from some mental health and substance 
use recovery advocates who opposed the idea 
of behavioral health conditions being framed as 
disorders, what is conspicuously absent from this 
definition is what the person is recovering from. 
This definition appears to apply equally well to 
those without, as well as to those with, a mental 
illness or SUD. In this sense, the definition could 
apply equally well to everyone while saying nothing 
specific about anyone.

The advocates’ point is well-taken and 

important, however. Persons with what has been 
described as mental illness or SUD are first and 
foremost, and most fundamentally, human beings 
just like everyone else. But if they remain human 
beings just like everyone else in all respects, 
then they lose their justification for laying claim 
to funding for behavioral health services and 
supports. If all that a person is doing is engaging 
in “a process of change” through which they are 
hoping to improve their “health and wellness, 
live a self-directed life, and strive to reach” their 
“full potential,” then society has no obligation to 
provide them with different types of support or any 
more support than anyone else. In addition, this 
process is not only self-directed, but also appears 
to be entirely up to the individual. It appears to be 
their responsibility, and theirs only, to live their 
self-directed life as they wish. If they encounter 
difficulties in doing so, they are entirely responsible 
for managing these challenges, and they have no 

6

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021fundamental right to claim any relief or intervention 
from anyone else.

How different this is from the framing of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which 
ushered in the recovery movement, in which mental 
illness and SUD were considered to be disabilities 
that entitled persons to request and receive 
reasonable accommodations and community 
supports necessary to live as full a life as desired 
alongside their peers without disabilities in the 
community of their choice.26 That too was the result 
of considerable advocacy efforts. At least one major 
confusion and one major limitation have emerged 
from the shift from a disability model, in which 
services and supports are essential to ensuring 
persons’ rights to community inclusion, to what 
may be called a self-actualization model, in which 
everyone could be recovering from something and 
so no one has a particular right to anything. This 
perspective addresses each of these in turn.

First, in the self-actualization model, there is 
the perception, or the implication, that recovery is 
the sole responsibility of the individual. Although 
people certainly play a central role in their own 
recovery, neither the person nor their recovery 
occurs in a vacuum and most often benefits from 
a supportive social context inclusive of accessible 
services and supports. Viewing recovery as solely 
the person’s own responsibility delegitimizes the 
important roles that services and supports can play 
in lessening the suffering, burdens, and intrusions 
of the disorders and in promoting and enabling the 
degree of functioning required to lead a satisfying 
and meaningful life in one’s community. Most 
often, such a confusion of viewing personal 
recovery as a personal responsibility has been used 
as justification for drawing arbitrary limits on the 
use of, or denying access entirely to, behavioral 
health services and supports to persons in need.27 
Either people claiming to be “in recovery” are 
considered too well to require care any longer or 
their ongoing challenges are viewed as requiring 
a different type of service than those provided 
based on medical necessity, thus garnering fewer 
resources. That is, if recovery is simply and 
solely an individual’s journey to “reach their full 

potential,” then “Good luck with that journey,” the 
behavioral health system need only provide them 
with minimal, if any, support.

Second, understanding recovery as a personal 

journey for which the individual is largely 
responsible has the added byproduct of leading to a 
discounting of all those forces beyond the individual 
that are known to influence the onset, course, and 
outcomes of mental illness and SUD. These social 
determinants of mental illness and SUD include 
poverty, unstable housing, prolonged involuntary 
unemployment, social exclusion and isolation, and 
various forms of stigma and discrimination based 
on health status, gender, race and ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, religious and cultural orientation, and 
other markers of difference.28-31 Understanding 
recovery as an individual’s responsibility may draw 
attention away from the array of social conditions 
and collective resources needed for even the 
possibility of recovery (i.e., it is extremely difficult 
to recover without having a home, a family or 
friends, and an income). This use of recovery as a 
diversion of attention away from social, political, 
economic, and cultural factors has become such 
a serious concern among some earlier recovery 
proponents that articles have begun to appear with 
titles such as “Uses and Abuses of Recovery,”32 
and coalitions have begun to form to combat the 
political use of recovery as an excuse for preserving 
current inequities. One such coalition, Recovery 
in the Bin, clearly expresses this concern on its 
website as follows: “We recognise that the growing 
development of [mental health] ‘Recovery’ . . . has 
been corrupted by neoliberalism and capitalism is 
the crisis! Some of us will never feel ‘Recovered’ 
living under these intolerable inhumane social . . . 
and economic conditions, such as poor housing, 
poverty, stigma, racism, sexism, unreasonable work 
expectations, and countless other barriers.”33
The confusion of personal recovery with 
(solely) personal responsibility appears to have 
limited the concept of recovery to an artificially 
decontextualized personal sphere that is somehow 
immune to the social determinants of mental health 
and substance use. If so, what might the future hold 
for still developing recovery-oriented systems of 

7

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021care? Although research is still sorely needed on 
this topic, a case study of Connecticut’s experience 
sheds some light on an answer to this question. 

A POSSIBLE FUTURE 

In Connecticut, in order to address and overcome 
these issues, this perspective found it necessary to 
incorporate an explicit focus on the array of social, 
economic, political, and cultural determinants of 
mental health and substance use and an emphasis 
on community inclusion and community life as a 
collective phenomenon into the state’s recovery 
transformation work.34-40 Doing so has required 
returning to the consumer/survivor and new 
recovery advocacy movements, which themselves 
are rooted, in part, in the civil rights movement of 
the 1950s and 1960s and the independent living 
and disability rights movement of the 1970s.41 It 
was these movements, and the legislation inspired 
by them (e.g., the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990), that 
established the rights of persons with functionally 
disabling conditions (based on a medical assessment 
of functional impairment) to be provided not only 
with medical care for their health condition but also 
with the community supports needed to be able 
to live full and dignified lives in the communities 
of their choice. Were mental illness and SUD not 
recognized as legitimate health conditions, it is 
difficult to see how funding such supports could 
be justified. This may mean that some tensions 
between a state mental health and substance use 
authority and various advocacy communities are 
inevitable to some degree, although hopefully there 
remains much common ground to be found and put 
to good use. 

In addition to returning to its roots in a disability 

rights paradigm,7,28 this national shift in the 
direction of transformation is grounded in more 
than 20 years of research and scholarship related 
to the concept of “citizenship.”36,37 Although this 
concept has begun to gain traction in the mental 
health field over the last decade,38-41 it is relatively 
new and less widely known than the concept of 
recovery. A rich and important topic for research 

in its own right, the concept of citizenship also 
has been especially effective as a counterbalance 
to the overemphasis on the individual nature of 
recovery discussed above. It is in this spirit—as 
drawing attention both to the social determinants 
of behavioral health and to the collective nature of 
community life—that the state of Connecticut’s 
Department of Mental Health and Addiction 
Services has proposed a few modifications to the 
model of a recovery-oriented system of care under 
the rubric of “recovering citizenship.”42 

Rowe has defined citizenship in the technical 
sense as a person’s strong connection to the rights, 
responsibilities, roles, resources, and relationships 
(the 5 Rs) that a democratic society makes 
available to its members through public and social 
institutions, the associational life of voluntary 
organizations such as faith communities and 
neighborhood organizations, and social networks 
and everyday social interactions. It also involves a 
sense of belonging in a person’s own community 
that must be validated by others’ recognition of their 
value as a member of society.41 This concept thus 
builds on the aspect of “a life in the community” 
that has been core to the definition of personal 
recovery, spelling out concretely, and helpfully, 
what such a life is made up of in terms that are 
not limited to the individual. It recognizes that a 
person cannot effectively belong to a community 
unless they are treated as such by others, and that 
membership in a community comes with certain 
entitlements and obligations. To recover (or to 
develop for the first time) the sense of being a full 
citizen, the person must have certain rights (e.g., the 
right to community inclusion) and resources (e.g., a 
home, an income) and be able to take on certain 
roles and responsibilities (e.g., neighbor, voter) 
while having meaningful relationships with others 
that offer the person a sense of belonging. Once 
spelled out in this way, it becomes obvious how 
recovery involves more than an individual’s own 
efforts. A person cannot will themselves to have 
a sense of belonging to a community; that sense 
must be conveyed by how others treat the person. 
Recovery happens in a social context, and that 
context matters a great deal.

8

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 41 No 1 | 2021What implications does this emphasis have 
for our recovery-oriented systems of care? In the 
model depicted in Figure 1, both state agencies 
and community collaborators must act as partners 
in expanding the scope of the behavioral health 
system to include the full community of people 
it serves. Although housing may have been 
recognized decades ago as an essential cornerstone 
of recovery, similar steps now need to be taken 
with respect to other components of community 
life including education, employment, finances, 
and social, leisure, and artistic pursuits. Along 
with partnering between the behavioral health 
authority and the state, county, or city departments 
that oversee these aspects of community life, 
inroads can be made into the voluntary sector, 
civic institutions (e.g., libraries), faith communities, 
and neighborhood organizations. Just as people 
with SUD and/or mental illness need to take steps 
in their own recovery that require courage and 
risk of failure, communities also need to take 
steps to welcome, include, and support those 
with behavioral health disorders. Systems of care 
oriented toward recovering citizenship recognize 
the importance of working collaboratively with 
an array of community leaders and institutions to 
cultivate opportunities for win-win strategies in 
which people with disabilities make valuable and 
valued contributions to their communities that 
benefit everyone. Giving back in this way has long 
been a core component of the 12-step tradition 
in substance use recovery. Forging pathways for 
people in recovery to have opportunities to do 
so can be a core component of behavioral health 
systems more broadly, and empirical studies will be 
needed to show the influence of this component on 
health outcomes. 

CONCLUSION

Behavioral health conditions continue to be among 
the most poorly understood and most stigmatized 
conditions in the United States. As a result, 
persons affected by these conditions often face 
discrimination in how they are viewed and treated 
by others in numerous arenas, including where they 

will live, whether they will complete their education 
or be employed, and which opportunities they will 
have for participating in community life. To the 
degree to which the recovery movement remains 
rooted in a human rights movement, addressing 
and eliminating these forms of discrimination must 
be considered a pressing and ongoing priority for 
systems of care. Doing so is identified as a core 
function of recovery-oriented practice because 
little progress will be made either in system 
transformation or in the social inclusion of persons 
with behavioral health conditions until they are seen 
as full citizens of the society to which they belong, 
with all of the rights and responsibilities associated 
with membership. 

As long as stigma and discrimination continue 
to exist, persons with behavioral health needs are 
discouraged from seeking care, but that is not all. 
They also are being denied the very resources 
and supports they need to enter into and sustain 
recovery, such as hope, a sense of meaning and 
purpose in life, a sense of agency and efficacy, 
a sense of self-worth, and confidence in their 
own ability to make good choices. Without these 
capacities, it becomes extremely difficult for people 
to voluntarily choose treatment or to take up and 
persist in the challenging work of recovery. And 
restoration of these capacities, as well as other 
forms of recovery capital, cannot be postponed until 
the person no longer shows any signs or symptoms 
of behavioral health difficulties.

In this respect, it is important to note that 
citizenship, including the right to social inclusion, 
is considered to be a foundation for recovery rather 
than to be viewed as one of its rewards.43 The task 
of addressing stigma and discrimination comes 
first, rather than last, because all people have 
the right to be treated with dignity and respect, 
regardless of their behavioral health condition or 
status. In the past, many of the practices of the 
behavioral health system, as well as of society at 
large, conveyed the message that people were not 
welcome in the community as long as they were 
experiencing behavioral health difficulties. They 
might be accepted back once recovered (e.g., on 
release from residential treatment or the hospital),

has been this combination of stigma and hopeless 
attitudes that has discouraged many people from 
seeking care and led others to believe that recovery 
was not possible for them. Organizations oriented 
toward recovering citizenship play a key role in 
shifting the culture both of the behavioral health 
system and of the broader society in the positive 
direction of embracing the reality of recovery and 
valuing the contributions that are made by the 
recovery community.
