Sex differences and hormonal effects in presumed cisgender individuals have been well-studied and support the concept of a
mosaic of both male and female “characteristics” in any given brain. Gonadal steroid increases and ﬂuctuations during peri-puberty
and across the reproductive lifespan inﬂuence the brain structure and function programmed by testosterone and estradiol
exposures in utero. While it is becoming increasingly common for transgender and gender non-binary individuals to block their
transition to puberty and/or use gender-afﬁrming hormone therapy (GAHT) to obtain their desired gender phenotype, little is
known about the impact of these manipulations on brain structure and function. Using sex differences and the effects of
reproductive hormones in cisgender individuals as the backdrop, we summarize here the existing nascent neuroimaging and
behavioral literature focusing on potential brain and cognitive differences in transgender individuals at baseline and after GAHT.
Research in this area has the potential to inform our understanding of the developmental origins of gender identity and sex
difference in response to gonadal steroid manipulations, but care is needed in our research questions and methods to not further
stigmatize sex and gender minorities.

INTRODUCTION
Deﬁnitions
The term gender identity refers to a person’s innermost sense of
their own gender, while sex is the sex assigned at birth by a
physician, typically based on chromosomal, hormonal, physical, or
anatomical characteristics [1] (Table 1). For clarity in this review,
sex will be used interchangeably with natal sex, biological sex,
and sex assigned at birth. Most people identify as cisgender
(abbreviated cis), a term which describes an alignment of gender
identity with natal sex. For transgender people (abbreviated trans),
gender identity, expression (i.e., the gender one presents to
others as), and/or behavior (i.e., how the person chooses to
express their gender identity through actions) are different from
that typically associated with their natal sex, as deﬁned by the
norms of a given culture [1–3]. Studies to date have focused
primarily on the two binary populations of transgender indivi-
duals: male-to-female (MTF) and female-to-male (FTM). MTF
individuals, also referred to as transgender
females, were
assigned male at birth but identify as female. FTM individuals,
also referred to as transgender males, were assigned female at
birth but identify as male. Prevalence rates of gender dysphoria
transgender-identifying individuals
(GD) and the number of
seeking help with transition have been rising worldwide over
the past two decades [4]. In 2016, the Williams Institute estimated
that ~0.6% of US adults identify as transgender when considering
a binary deﬁnition [5]. Previous studies of transgender popula-
the gender
tions have not considered individuals across
spectrum,
including those who identify as gender non-binary,
gender ﬂuid, transmasculine, or transfeminine. Transmasculine is
an umbrella term that includes FTMs and is used to describe

people who were assigned female at birth but identify with
masculinity to a greater extent than femininity, while transfemi-
nine is an umbrella term that includes MTFs and describes those
who were assigned male at birth but identify with femininity to a
greater extent than masculinity [6].

Previous attempts to codify the transgender experience labeled
it as a pathological condition called Gender Identity Disorder (GID)
in the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) Third and Fourth
Editions [7, 8]. Thus, transgender individuals automatically carried
a “psychiatric” disorder. In contrast, DSM-5 criteria for GD is given
to transgender individuals only if they feel signiﬁcant distress or
impairment in functioning as a result of experiencing a “strong
and persistent incongruence between their gender identity and
assigned sex at birth” [9]. There is an ongoing debate about
whether this newer deﬁnition of GD should even be included in
the DSM given the continued potential stigma of characterizing
the difﬁculties transgender individuals experience as an illness in
our predominantly gender-binary society. However, the diagnosis
of GD can sometimes be necessary to receive services covered by
health insurers [10]. Epidemiologic data about the prevalence of
GD are unreliable, especially considering the sociocultural varia-
tions among different countries and societies, but in 2013 the
DSM-5 offered conservative approximations of 0.005–0.014% for
biological males and 0.002–0.003% for biological
females [9].
These estimates are considerably lower than the aforementioned
statistic for transgender identiﬁcation reported by the Williams
Institute because individuals may identify as transgender without
experiencing gender dysphoric symptoms or
receiving the
diagnosis of GD.

Early research seeking to determine the underlying causes of
GD and the transgender identity focused almost primarily on sex
differences and whether the brain of individuals with GD are more
like their natal sex or that of their preferred gender. While we
review the brain imaging studies related to this focus, we propose
that this line of research can further stigmatize this population and
does not address basic questions about the long-term safety of
gender-afﬁrming hormone therapies (GAHT) with respect to brain
health. While low-quality evidence based on 247 transgender
adults
studies
from three uncontrolled prospective cohort
suggests that hormone therapy may lead to improvements in
psychological functioning [11–13], there are no major longitudinal
studies of GAHT use beyond 18 months with respect to brain
structure,
function, or cognition among adolescent or adult
transgender individuals. Reproductive hormones have profound
and broad impact on neurochemistry, neuronal structure, glial
architecture, and regional brain function during development as
well as adulthood [14, 15]. Moreover, loss of estradiol [16–18] and
declines in testosterone [19, 20] can result in cognitive and
mood difﬁculties among adult cisgender women and men,
respectively, suggesting that research focusing on the long-term
safety of GAHT with respect to the central nervous system (CNS) is
needed.

some unique concerns

The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on sex
differences from the novel perspective of gender identity, to
address deﬁcits in our knowledge surrounding the transgender
and gender non-binary patient population, and emphasize the
importance of considering the long-term effects of GAHT on brain
health, particularly the mental skills comprising executive function
that enable us to accomplish daily tasks. Based on the literature in
cisgender populations, which is summarized below, we believe
that GAHT presents
for executive
functioning and cognitive control in transgender individuals. We
will then present data on both “baseline” differences in MTF and
FTM individuals before they have taken any GAHT, as well as how
their CNS responds to GAHT. More attention and research
dedicated to studying this growing population will ensure that
all people receive optimal care regardless of gender identity. In
fact, the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Ofﬁce (SGMRO) of
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was ofﬁcially established in
2015 to address health and research disparities in the LGBTQ +
(lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) populations. Investiga-
tion of risk for long-term executive functioning difﬁculties related
to GAHT use in the transgender community would be conducive
to the SGMRO mission.

The brain as a gender mosaic
To understand the status of neuroimaging research in transgender
samples, it is important to appreciate the origins of sex differences
in the brain across development in cisgender individuals. The
presence of the androgen testosterone and its aromatization to
estradiol in utero cause the fetal brain of the male to organize in
such a manner to result in a more masculine phenotype across the
lifespan [15, 21]. The absence of androgen production by the
female fetus and estrogen-binding activity of alpha-fetoprotein in
the female fetus lead to a more feminine brain phenotype [22].
However, the distinction between the female and male brain is
not always clear-cut, as brain regions may be more or less
programmed by androgens and estrogens leading to greater or
lesser masculinization of various brain regions during prenatal
development. This “mosaic” of maleness and femaleness occurs
even among cisgender individuals [23].

One compelling hypothesis for the development of transgender
experiences is a disconnect between an individual’s brain “sex/
gender” and the sex associated with their reproductive organs due
to the relative maturation of these organs across gestation, with
genital development completed in ﬁrst
trimester and brain
development continuing throughout pregnancy [24, 25]. A
genetic component may also be involved, as
siblings of
transgender
individuals are more likely to be transgender
compared with the general population [26].

At puberty, gonadal steroids act upon the programmed brain
and,
together with life experience and genetics, create a
phenotype that is along the gender continuum [2, 16, 27]. Older
studies of presumed cisgender individuals in the adolescent
period noted that the structure of the prefrontal cortex undergoes
signiﬁcant changes during puberty and adolescence, with
important physical and psychological variations between males
and females [14, 28–30]. More recently, a study of a large cohort of
children, adolescents, and young adults (n = 674) demonstrated
that sex differences in patterns of cognition (spatial, motor,
language, nonverbal reasoning, and emotion identiﬁcation) are
related to sex differences in patterns of resting-state functional
connectivity, with males demonstrating more between-network
connectivity, while similarly aged females displayed more within-
network connectivity [31]. Whether this is a true sex difference or
due to variations in pubertal status between similarly aged
females and males is not clear, as within and between network
connectivity typically increases and decreases, respectively, across
development [32, 33].
In another cohort of 1189 youth, data
demonstrated mean brain gray matter density increased from

childhood to young adulthood, while total brain gray matter
volume and mean cortical thickness decreased with age [34]. Total
gray matter mass only shows a slight decline. There is a male
advantage in gray matter volume, though females have higher
gray matter density throughout the brain. Two regions in which
sex differences are most commonly reported are the medial
temporal lobe structures of the hippocampus and amygdala [35,
studies have also demonstrated changes during

adolescence to the frontal
lobes, a region strongly associated
with executive function [37]. Executive function is a major branch
of cognition,
including sustained attention, cognitive control,
inhibition, error monitoring, and working memory [33]. One
possible explanation for these structural differences in the frontal
lobes is the regionally speciﬁc actions of sex steroids during
pubertal maturation [27], particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex [38]. It follows that puberty blocking with gonadotropin
releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist injections or implants, and/or
exogenous hormone administration would have important
implications for executive function development during the
transition from childhood to young adulthood. At the moment,
this area of research remains largely unexplored in adolescents
and emerging adults and therefore warrants further investigation.
By adulthood, absolute brain and corpus callosum volume is
larger in males than in females, even after accounting for body
size [39, 40]. A recent meta-analysis of MRI studies conﬁrms that,
on average, absolute intracranial volume, total brain volume,
cerebrum, gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal ﬂuid volume,
and cerebellum are greater in males than females [41]. Men also
have a higher proportion of white matter, though women have a
higher proportion of gray matter [40, 42]. The volume of the
central subdivision of the bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNSTc), a
brain region implicated in anxiety and stress regulation [43], has
been shown to be larger in men than women [44, 45]. On the
other hand, females tend to have thicker cortices than males as
well as higher global cerebral blood ﬂow [42], perhaps secondary
to the vasodilatory effects of estradiol [46]. Sex differences among
reproductive-aged, cisgender adults have also been consistently
reported in functional connectivity during a resting state [47–51].
With respect to cognitive function, verbal and spatial tasks show
a female and male sex bias, respectively. Adult women are also
reported to outperform men on tasks involving perceptual speed

abilities are typically greater in males [52, 53]. In general, males
tend to process verbal stimuli in a more lateralized way and show
a weaker right-hand preference than females [54, 55].

Figure 1 summarizes the relative sex differences in brain
structure and function across development among presumed
cisgender individuals. Though few asked participants about their
gender identity, these studies regarding sex differences have
motivated an entire area of research that aims to understand the
etiology of being transgender. Causal mechanisms are unknown,
though brain imaging methods are being applied with some
promising, if inconsistent, results.

Reproductive hormones and the cisgender brain
Overall, estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone, as well as its
neurosteroid metabolite allopregnanolone (Allo) have great
inﬂuence on neurotransmitter levels and receptors, and neuronal
and glial architecture and function in presumably cisgender
individuals, as described above. Thus, ﬂuctuations in these
gonadal and adrenal steroids can produce profound effects on
brain and mental health.

The effect of a natural or premature menopause on the brain
and behavior of cisgender females has been well-studied and
could theoretically inform our understanding of the long-term
impact of GAHT in trans males. While the cis-gender postmeno-
pausal woman is hypogonadal with respect to sex hormones and
neuroactive steroids, the trans-male using GAHT will have low
levels of estradiol, progesterone and Allo, but levels of testosterone
that are typically supraphysiologic for individuals with two X
chromosomes. While transitioning to menopause, many presum-
ably cis-gender women report a decline in cognitive function [56],
particularly in memory and attention [17, 18, 57] and increase in
functional
risk for major depressive disorder
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans highlight
the importance of estradiol for intact prefrontal executive network
function and connectivity among menopausal women [16, 59–61].
Longitudinal studies reveal that women who experience prema-
ture hormonal menopause and estrogen deﬁciency before reach-
ing the median age of natural menopause are at heightened risk
for ﬁrst onset depression, as well as morbidity (e.g., cardiovascular
disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases) and mortality
[62]. However, some of these adverse outcomes may be prevented
by exogenous estrogen treatment initiated proximal to the ﬁnal
menstrual period and continued into the postmenopause [63].

[58]. Moreover,

Conversely, androgens have varying impact on brain and
behavior across the female lifespan and have been well-studied in
cis-gender males and females [64]. Increased levels of androgens
have been linked to increases in irritability, hostility, and clinical
mood disorders in women [64, 65]. For example, higher free
testosterone levels have been associated with premenstrual
syndrome and depression in normally cycling women, with anger
and depression among pregnant and postpartum women and
with increased hostility in post-menopausal women [64].

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a natural model for the
study of androgen excess among cisgender females. PCOS affects
almost 15% of women of
reproductive age [66] and is
characterized by chronically high free testosterone levels and
low levels of progesterone and estradiol from puberty onward
[64]. Females with PCOS are at substantial risk for psychological,
metabolic, reproductive, and cardiovascular abnormalities [67, 68],
such as acne, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and mood
disorders like depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, as well as
lowered health-quality of life [65, 69–74].

On the contrary, low testosterone in cisgender men is linked to
numerous physical and mental health problems. In a population-
based cohort of cisgender men, serum testosterone levels are
inversely related to mortality due to cardiovascular disease and
cancer [75]. The presence of low testosterone also predicts the

Neuropsychopharmacology (2019) 44:22 – 37

development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, frailty, and
depressive symptoms in males [76–78]. In an observational cohort
of middle-aged cisgender men (n = 398) with low total testoster-
one levels and high chronic medical morbidity, testosterone
treatment was associated with decreased mortality compared
with no testosterone treatment [79].

In combination, these ﬁndings that indicate the physical and
mental health ramiﬁcations of ﬂuctuations
in reproductive
hormones in the cisgender population warrant further investiga-
tion into the long-term safety of GAHT for transgender individuals.
Of particular interest is high-dose testosterone that suppresses
estradiol levels in FTMs due to the potential long-term effects of
low levels of estradiol and supra-physiologic levels of testosterone.

Transgender sex differences prior to GAHT
Although sex differences in presumably cisgender individuals
have been well-studied, little is known about how gender identity
intersects with these sex differences in brain function and
structure among people who identify as transgender, particularly
prior to GAHT. Early brain studies on the transgender population
compared the brain structures of MTFs and FTMs prior to GAHT
with both cisgender male and cisgender female controls to
identify whether there are existing brain differences in MTF and
FTM individuals at baseline (before hormone treatment) that set
them apart from cisgender individuals. Most studies focused on
MTFs, resulting in limited information about FTMs. Additionally,
the majority of these studies were cross-sectional and limited to
the above brain regions already showing sex differences among
cisgender populations, while neglecting structures underlying
cognitive and emotion processing tasks required for optimal day-
to-day functioning.

Recent application of neuroimaging techniques has advanced
our understanding of baseline differences between brain regions
as well as the impact of GAHT on performance in cognitive tasks
that exhibit sex-biased responses. These studies only examined
the sex-biased verbal and spatial tasks, while overlooking other
cognitive domains. To the best of our knowledge, studies thus far
have not systematically considered executive functions such as
sustained attention and focus, working memory, impulse control,
affective regulation, and motivation and activation for work.

Presently, ﬁndings are conﬂicting about whether the neuroa-
natomy of transgender individuals prior to GAHT resembles that of
their biological sex or their gender identity, but most cross-
sectional neuroimaging research indicates that brain morphology
and activation patterns at rest and during cognitive performance
are more congruent with gender identity than natal sex in
untreated MTFs and FTMs. Among transgender individuals meet-
ing criteria for GD, cortical thickness [80, 81], gray matter volume
[80, 82], white matter microstructure [83, 84], structural con-
nectivity [85], and corpus callosum shape [86] have been found to
be more similar
the same
preferred gender compared with those of the same natal sex.
Likewise, transgender individuals feature a unique pattern of
connections in the resting state functional connectivity network
that differ from those of their natal sex [87].

to cisgender control subjects of

Performance on cognitive tasks by MTFs and FTMs prior to GAHT
is often more congruent with gender identity.
In most cases,
investigators have focused on verbal and spatial tasks which display
a clear sex bias. Verbal tasks show a female sex bias, while spatial
tasks show a male sex bias. Multiple studies conclude that MTFs
perform signiﬁcantly better on female-favoring verbal tests com-
pared to cisgender male controls [88–90], whereas FTMs perform
signiﬁcantly worse than cisgender female controls on verbal tests
[90]. Measuring conceptual styles, MTFs and FTMs perform in
congruence with their gender identity [91]. This suggests that the
tendency towards “feminization” in MTFs and “masculinization” in
FTMs is an innate quality unrelated to exogenous hormonal

in

intervention, and more closely tied to brain development
transgender individuals.

Functional neuroimaging also conﬁrms that activation pat-
terns in FTMs and MTFs before GAHT intervention are more
representative of their gender identity than natal sex. MTFs
exhibit a pattern of hypothalamic activation consistent with
their preferred gender when smelling odorous steroids 4,16-
androstadien-3-one and estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3ol, occupy-
ing an intermediate position with predominantly female-like
features [92]. Furthermore, cerebral activation pattern in MTFs
are similar to that of cisgender female controls during viewing of
erotic stimuli, indicating female-like cerebral processing in MTFs
[93]. When evaluating voice gender perception of male and
female voices in MTFs compared with cisgender men and
cisgender women, neural activation in the superior frontal gyrus
in MTFs was more similar to that of cisgender women than
cisgender men [94].

Nevertheless, approximately one-quarter of the literature has
presented conﬂicting data. More speciﬁcally, these cross-sectional
in vivo studies suggest the opposite – that brain morphology and
cognitive performance show greater congruence with natal sex
than gender identity in untreated MTFs and FTMs. In the context
of morphology, gray matter distribution and regional volumes in
MTF and FTM adolescents are in accordance with their respective
natal sex [95]. MTFs have regional gray matter variation more
similar to that of healthy male controls (natal sex) than to female
controls (gender identity) [96]. However, MTFs show signiﬁcantly
larger volumes of regional gray matter in the putamen compared
with the male controls,
indicating that the putamen is more
feminized (cisgender
females typically have the largest gray
matter volumes out of all groups). Likewise, FTMs share a similar
pattern with heterosexual cisgender female controls concerning
cortical thickness, surface area, gray matter volume, structural
volumes (amygdala, hippocampus, caudate), and resting state
functional connectivity from the amygdala [97]. Performance has
also been found to align more with natal sex than gender identity,
according to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) [91] and
when testing four potentially sex-sensitive cognitive factors
(rotation, visualization, perception, and verbalization) [98]. While
the majority of the literature indicates that brain structure and
function are more in line with gender identity than natal sex, even
in trans individuals who have not undergone GAHT, the equivocal
nature of some ﬁndings suggests that perhaps we ought to
consider a continuum of gender identity where individuals may
not ﬁt neatly into binary characterizations. Furthermore,
it is
important to consider that many studies were undertaken with
small sample sizes and results should be interpreted cautiously.
Given these contradictory ﬁndings, replication of this research in
larger samples is needed.

Gender-afﬁrming hormone therapy
Over the past few years, it has become increasingly common and
accepted for transgender people to socially transition to their
gender identity. This includes both medical and non-medical
steps. Some choose to present as their gender
identity by
changing their appearance (e.g., hair, clothing), pronouns, and/or
name. Other transgender individuals decide to seek medical
treatments, such as GAHT and surgery (e.g., breast augmentation,
phalloplasty), to achieve the desired physical anatomy of their
gender identity. An early intervention for children who express
gender non-conformity or GD during the pre- and early-pubertal
years includes blocking pubertal development. Puberty blockers
are a reversible strategy to delay puberty and give patients and
families time to develop a transition plan [99]. After puberty, GAHT
can be taken to reduce endogenous hormone levels of the
biological sex and to replace them with those of the desired
gender [100]. MTFs typically take estradiol and androgen blockers

– At least 7 months of androgen GAHT changes white matter
microstructure in FTMs, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA)
values. After 7 months of GAHT, FA increased in the right superior
longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and right corticospinal tract (CST)
compared with pre-GAHT values.
– These increments in FA in the SLF and CST were predicted by
the free testosterone index before GAHT, but not after GAHT.
– Six months of estrogen GAHT in MTFs decreased cortical
thickness and subcortical volumetric measures, and increased
ventricle volume.
– Six months of testosterone GAHT in FTMs increased cortical
thickness.
– A positive correlation between serum testosterone and free
testosterone index changes and cortical thickness changes was
found in the parieto-temporo-occipital regions of FTMs.
– MTFs receiving estradiol and anti-androgens for at least
4 months had gray matter decreases in the right hippocampal
region. These decreases were reﬂected by increases in the third
and lateral ventricles.
– Changes in gray matter structures in MTFs were correlated with
changes in progesterone levels.
– Prior to GAHT, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was thicker
in FTMs than in both FCs and MCs, and remained unchanged
after GAHT.
– Compared with the FCs and MCs, testosterone GAHT in FTMs
resulted in increased bilateral cortical thickness in the insular and
superior cortices, changes in cortico-cortical thickness
covariation between mPFC and occipital cortex, increased
fractional anisotropy in the posterior portion of the fronto-
occipital tract connecting these regions, and increased functional
connectivity between mPFC and temporo-parietal junction.
– FTMs showed testosterone-related reductions in mean
diffusivity in the lateral hypothalamus. Signiﬁcant reductions
were shown unilaterally after 1 month and bilaterally after
4 months of testosterone GAHT.
– The magnitude of reductions in mean diffusivity were
signiﬁcantly associated with GAHT-induced increases in free
androgen index and bioavailable testosterone.

to feminize their bodies, while FTMs typically take testosterone to
masculinize their bodies. Examining the effects of GAHT on the
brain during these neuroplastic periods is critical.

Numerous studies have focused on the effects of endogenous
and exogenous hormones in cisgender individuals, but research
about GAHT is in its early stages. The National Transgender
Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care ﬁnds that
at least 80% of transgender people have either taken GAHT or
want to take GAHT at some point [101]. The beneﬁt of GAHT to
behavioral health and quality of life acutely is considerable [102].
However, there is little information about the safety and efﬁcacy of
these therapies. Transgender and gender non-binary patients,
their families, and their providers are concerned about whether
clinically prescribed GAHT will affect cognitive domains that are
important for everyday function, particularly if initiated during
windows of development such as peri-adolescence to young
adulthood when the executive network is under rapid develop-
ment. Unfortunately, there is little information to guide clinical
decision-making at
to this
this time. To be most helpful
population,
research should now embrace gender expansive
identities (including those that do not fall within the gender
binary) and focus on collecting data that have the potential to
improve health over the entire lifespan, namely by conducting
studies that evaluate long-term cognitive and behavioral effects of
GAHT.

While sex hormones can exert an organizational inﬂuence on
brain morphology during prenatal and peri-pubertal develop-
ment, as discussed above, sex steroids can still affect the brain
later in adulthood when the brain has fully developed, as in the
case of GAHT. Most research on the effects of GAHT thus far has
focused on metabolism and the vascular, epithelial, and
musculoskeletal systems, while neglecting the central nervous
[103]. For instance, testosterone GAHT causes
system (CNS)
transgender men to develop a different body composition with
more muscle mass and strength, less fat mass, and an altered
bone geometry with larger bones compared with female
controls [104].

Only a few studies have prioritized brain health as a function of
exogenous hormone administration, sex, and gender identity –
which is the focus of this review. Below is a summary of the
existing literature in the English language on how brain imaging
outcomes, performance on cognitive tasks, and mood within the
adult transgender population are affected by GAHT. Note that
transgender individuals who were not taking GAHT at the time of
respective studies were sometimes labeled as “gender
their
dysphoric” by researchers, while those who were taking or had
previously taken GAHT were considered “transgender.”

METHODS
All studies relevant to the topic and written in English were
included. Most research articles featured in this review were
found using Google Scholar and PubMed. Publications cited by
these articles were also referenced. Search terms included
“transgender,” “transsexual,” “hormones,” “brain,” and “ima-
ging.” Only studies that directly focused on subjects who do not
identify with their sex assigned at birth and looked at GAHT
effects were included. Publications that did not look at brain
structure, function, or behavior were not included. Furthermore,
we did not use a cutoff date for the year of publication or a limit
on country of study. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal
studies were accepted, but data from longitudinal studies were
given greater emphasis. Articles were excluded if it was not
clear from the description whether participants were naïve to
GAHT. Adolescents and children taking puberty blockers rather
than cross-sex hormones were also not considered in this
review.

RESULTS
GAHT effects on brain structure
Cross-sectional studies. One small cross-sectional study assessed
the effects of at least 2 years of GAHT in 18 FTMs and 17 MTFs
after gender-afﬁrming surgery. Neuroanatomical differences in the
brain were found to be region-speciﬁc between transgender
individuals and their biological sex as well as their gender identity,
suggesting localization of inﬂuence by sex hormones on brain
structure [105]. More speciﬁcally,
the mean neuroanatomical
volume for the amygdala, putamen, and corpus callosum of MTFs
was found to be signiﬁcantly different from those of cisgender
women, but not cisgender men (consistent with the natal sex of
MTFs). FTMs, on the other hand, differed from cisgender women in
the third ventricle and nucleus accumbens, which is consistent
with their preferred gender, and differed from cisgender men in
the medial
lobe structures and cerebellum. FTMs
differed from both cismen and ciswomen in fusiform volume.
These ﬁndings suggest that brain structures are not uniformly
inﬂuenced by GAHT, and that while some structures become more
like those of
fall
somewhere in the middle. This lends credence to the concept of
the gender mosaic, which falls between the two rigidly deﬁned
binary gender identities.
A similar ﬁnding of

region-speciﬁc volumetric differences
between gender and natal sex was noted in a study with 20
GAHT-naïve MTFs, 20 MTFs treated with GAHT for at least 1 year,
20 cisgender men controls, and 20 cisgender women controls
[106]. The cisgender women had lower global brain volumes and
regional gray matter volumes
the
posterior–superior frontal cortex compared with treated MTFs
and cisgender men. However, both transgender groups presented
lower bilateral
insular gray matter volumes than the cisgender
women group. Given that the insula is linked to body awareness,
one possible interpretation of these results is that this difference
in insular volume could be characteristic of MTFs and related to
the neural network of body perception, reﬂecting the distress
associated with GD.

the preferred gender, others may not, or

in a large portion of

Longitudinal studies.
Six studies examining the long-term effects
of GAHT on the brain structure of transgender individuals (Table 2)
have been published [107–112]. Overall, these morphological
studies have shown that GAHT either feminizes brain structures in
MTFs or defeminizes brain structures in FTMs.

In MTFs, 4 months of anti-androgen and estrogen GAHT
resulted in decreased brain volumes and increased ventricle
volumes “toward female proportions” compared with male
controls [108, 111]. This decrease in brain volume was ten times
more than the average annual decrease in non-transgender adults
[111], occurred speciﬁcally in the right hippocampal region, and
was correlated with changes in progesterone levels
[108].
Conversely, FTMs in the Hulshoff Pol et al. [111], study displayed
an increase in total brain and hypothalamic volume and decreased
ventricle volumes toward male proportions compared with female
controls after 4 months of androgen GAHT. These results suggest
plastic changes of the transgender adult human brain structure,
speciﬁcally subcortical structures related to memory and emo-
tional processing, toward the typical size of the identiﬁed gender
under the inﬂuence of GAHT.

Similarly, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies showed that
GAHT alters white matter microstructure in FTMs such that they
become more like cisgender males and less like their cisgender
female counterparts [107, 110, 112]. After at least 7 months of
fractional anisotropy (FA) values – a measure of con-
GAHT,
nectivity – increased in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus
(SLF) and the right corticospinal tract (CST) compared with pre-
treatment values among 15 FTMs [107]. This suggests that
prescribed exogenous hormones mimic endogenous hormone

– FTMs on GAHT showed no speciﬁc pattern of
cerebral activation.
– MTFs on GAHT showed a speciﬁc pattern of cerebral
activation during a 3D mental rotation task that
differed from MCs in the parietal region and from FCs
in the orbital prefrontal region.
– A negative correlation in MTFs was found between
the number of months of GAHT and the cerebral
activation in the parietal, occipital, and temporal
regions.
– The activation differences in key mental rotation
areas in MCs compared with untreated MTFs and
MTFs undergoing GAHT were largely independent of
GAHT. In other words, the brain activation pattern for
the mental rotation task did not seem to be
signiﬁcantly affected by hormonal therapy.
– No signiﬁcant differences in mental rotation
performance were found between MCs, untreated
MTFs, and treated MTFs after 6 months of GAHT.
– Both treated and untreated MTFs more often used
verbalization (typically associated with females) as a
strategy for solving mental rotation problems.
Both untreated MTFs and treated MTFs showed
greater temporo-occipital activation than MCs.

– Cerebral activation during language and mental
rotation tasks may be affected by GAHT.
– Activation during the language tasks increased after
three months of GAHT in both MTFs and FTMs. Total
language task related activity in both MTFs and FTMs
was correlated with post-GAHT estradiol levels.
– Activation during the mental rotation task did not
increase during GAHT, but post-GAHT testosterone
levels were associated with total activation during the
mental rotation task.
– Cerebral lateralization of language and spatial
functioning was not affected by GAHT.
– At baseline, MTFs show unique resting state
functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns in a network
around the supramarginal gyrus, a region related to
empathetic processing.
– Changes within this network (central to
interpersonal emotion processing) over gender
transition are likely due to changes in emotion
recognition, emotion description, and emotion
contagion (proneness for transfer of emotion), rather
than due to the 4-16 weeks of GAHT.
– Similar functional connectivity patterns were found
across groups within the default mode network
(DMN), salience network (SN), and left working
memory network (WMN).
– Within the right WMN, MCs had signiﬁcantly greater
functional connectivity in the right caudate nucleus
compared with FCs.
– No sex difference in functional connectivity was
found between MTFs and FTMs. Also, MTFs and FTMs
did not differ signiﬁcantly from either MCs or FCs.
– GAHT (in FTMs and MTFs) and circulating sex steroid
levels (in MCs and FCs) did not affect functional
connectivity.

– Estrogen treated MTFs scored higher on Paired
Associate Learning compared with the untreated
MTFs. Possible inﬂuence of estrogen in MTFs on
verbal memory tasks, but cross-sectional design
limits interpretation of causality.
– No differences between the treated and
untreated MTFs were detected on the Digit Span
(control memory) task or on other cognitive
tasks, including Mental Rotations, Controlled
Associations, and Vocabulary.
– Androgen treated FTMs performed
signiﬁcantly better than untreated FTMs on

– Androgen treated FTMs also achieved
signiﬁcantly higher scores for copy accuracy on
the ROCF.
– No signiﬁcant differences were found between
groups for any verbal memory test.
– MTFs demonstrated less exclusive right-
handedness compared with MCs.
– No signiﬁcant differences between MTFs and
MCs were observed on any of the cognitive
tasks.

– FTMs only improved signiﬁcantly on the Visual
Paired Associates immediate recall task after
6 months of androgen GAHT.
– There were no signiﬁcant differences on any
verbal memory test (Logical Memory, Verbal
Paired Associates immediate and delayed recall),
nor on any measure of the Rey-Osterrieth
Complex Figure Test (copy and delayed recall).
– At baseline, MTFs and MCs left an equal
number of items unanswered. But during retest,
MCs left fewer items unanswered that MTFs.
– No signiﬁcant difference was found between
FCs and FTMs at any time point.

– For FTMs, testosterone had an enhancing and
not quickly reversible effect (even 5 weeks after
termination) on 3D spatial ability performance
over 1.5 years. There was no deteriorating effect
on verbal ﬂuency.
– For MTFs, anti-androgen and estrogen therapy
had no declining effect on 3D spatial ability.
There was no enhancing effect on verbal ﬂuency.
– On the 3D spatial task, untreated MTFs initially
perform better than untreated FTMs. After
3 months of GAHT, MTF and FTM performance is
roughly equal. After 10 months of GAHT, MTFs
perform worse than FTMs, showing that
testosterone enhances visuospatial ability, while
estrogen suppresses visuospatial ability.
– No hormonal inﬂuence was found in either
MTFs and FTMs on any of the following
cognitive functions: verbal ﬂuency, form
recognition, ﬁne motor mvmt, perceptual speed,
hidden ﬁgures, verbal reasoning/general
intelligence.
– In FTMs, 3 months of androgen GAHT were
associated with an increase in spatial ability
(improved Rotated Figures performance), a
decrease in verbal ﬂuency (decreased Word
Production and Sentence Production scores),
and no effect on verbal reasoning.

– After 3 months of androgen GAHT, FTMs
showed increased anger proneness, aggressive
tendencies, sexual arousability and motivation,
and visuospatial ability. FTMs also demonstrated
a decrease in verbal ﬂuency.
– After 3 months of estrogen and anti-androgen
GAHT, MTFs showed a decrease in anger
proneness, aggressiveness, sexual interest,
sexual arousability, and visuospatial ability.
However, they exhibited an improvement in
verbal ﬂuency.

– No differential effect on cognitive performance
over time was found between FCs and MCs, and
MTFs and FTMs.
– A highly signiﬁcant parallel improvement of
performance was found over time (i.e., the
learning effect) for all cognitive factors for all
groups, esp. in younger and more educated
individuals. That is to say, MTFs, FTMs, FCs, and
MCs all showed an identical time-dependent
improvement in cognitive performance.

Three to 12 months of estrogen GAHT for MTFs
has little or no inﬂuence on sex-typed aspects of
cognition (visuospatial, verbal performance) or
memory.

– No differences between the groups were
found on the Verbal Reasoning Test, showing
that the groups were comparable with respect
to general intelligence.
– Performance on four of the ﬁve different
visuospatial tests pretreatment showed a
signiﬁcant linear increase from FCs to FTMs to
MTFs to MCs (biological males > biological
females). These data were consistent with an
organizing effect of sex hormones on cognitive
performance, but there was no evidence of an
activating effect
– There was a sex difference on all ﬁve spatial
tests, with biological males obtaining higher
scores than biological females.
– 14 weeks of GAHT demonstrated no effect on
the visuospatial ability of MTFs or FTMs,
indicating a lack of activating effects from GAHT
[150–165].

effects on brain structure as previous work has shown that the
right SLF, the forceps minor, and the CST of cisgender males are
characterized by signiﬁcantly higher FA values than those of
cisgender females. Interestingly, greater increases in FA values in
the SLF and CST were associated with higher free testosterone
index values in FTMs even before beginning a course of GAHT,

leading to the conclusion that the right SLF in FTMs is inherently
masculinized prior to hormone treatment. Testosterone adminis-
tration further increases (masculinizes) the FA values in the SLF.
Likewise, testosterone GAHT in FTMs has been found to change
adult hypothalamic microstructure and potentially related neural
activity toward “male” patterns
[112]. Testosterone-related

reductions in mean diffusivity were observed in the lateral
hypothalamus, with signiﬁcant reductions occurring unilaterally
after 1 month and bilaterally after 4 months of GAHT. These
reductions in mean diffusivity were signiﬁcantly correlated with
GAHT-induced increases in free androgen index and bioavailable
testosterone. Additionally, 14.4 ± 6 months of masculinizing GAHT
in 22 FTMs was found to increase FA in the posterior portion of the
fronto-occipital tract connecting the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) and occipital cortex, as well as increase functional
connectivity between the mPFC and temporo–parietal junction
[110]. Therefore, testosterone GAHT seems to result in functional
changes in brain areas potentially linked to self-referential and
own-body perception.

In FTMs, at least 6 months of testosterone therapy also increases

regions among these FTM individuals, as reported by Zubiaurre-
Elorza et al. [109]. However, Burke et al. [110] described that the
mPFC in FTMs remained unchanged after GAHT, even though the
mPFC was thicker in FTMs than in both FCs and MCs to begin with.
In MTFs, at least 6 months of estrogen and anti-androgen therapy
is associated with decreased cortical
thickness, decreased
subcortical volumetric measures, and an enlargement of the
ventricular system [109].

Taken together,

the above six studies suggest

that even
relatively short-term administration of GAHT inﬂuences the gross
morphology and white matter microstructure of the brain in such
a manner that trans individuals become more like their identiﬁed
gender with respect to these brain outcomes. Additional research
would need to elucidate the speciﬁc mechanisms behind these
changes as well as the clinical consequences of using GAHT for
years instead of months.

GAHT effects on neuronal activation
Cross-sectional studies.
Three cross-sectional studies in adults
assessed brain activation patterns using fMRI in response to GAHT
[113–115]. No pre-GAHT baseline measures were obtained and
these studies focused primarily on tasks for which there is a
known sex-bias in either performance or brain response. Both
performance differences as well as brain activation differences
between groups are highlighted in Table 3. In a four-group study
which included cisgender and transgender male and female
adults, cisgender males performed more accurately on a 3D
mental rotation task than cisgender females, as expected [115].
Surprisingly, performance as assessed by reaction time among
FTMs using high dose testosterone was slower than that of
cisgender females suggesting that for this measure, testosterone
treatment did not make FTMs more consistently “masculine” in
their performance. Again, baseline behavioral differences in
performance cannot be ruled out, but worse performance in the
testosterone treated group is of concern and should be evaluated
using a longitudinal study design.

(BOLD)

In this same study, brain activation outcomes as measured by
the blood oxygen level dependent
signal during
performance of the mental rotation tasks suggests that trans
and cisgender individuals differ in several brain regions when
trans
individuals have undergone GAHT. Typically, parietal
activation during task performance differs by sex, with greater
activation among cisgender males than cisgender females [116,
117]. Although the expected occipito-parietal-frontal pattern of
brain activation during mental rotation was observed in all groups,

31

parietal activation was less in MTF individuals compared with
cisgender males.
In addition, number of months of GAHT was
negatively correlated with parietal activation among MTF partici-
pants. While it is tempting to conclude from these data that GAHT
“de-masculinizes” parietal activation, one must remember that
these differences between cis and trans XY chromosome
individuals could have been present at baseline, prior to GAHT.
Interestingly, FTM individuals in this study did not differ from
either control group. In a smaller study of MTFs using estrogen,
MTFs not using estrogen, and cisgender male controls, there were
no group differences in BOLD signal during task performance.
However, MTFs relied on verbal strategies for task performance to
a greater degree than cisgender males, providing additional
support for baseline differences in cognition between MTFs and
cisgender male controls. This ﬁnding is further indication that
transgender individuals have cognitive processes that align with
their gender identity rather than natal sex. In contrast, those in

long-term GAHT (FTM for a mean duration of 84.52 months, MTF
for 81.56 months) compared with cisgender men and cisgender
women, differences between FTMs and cisgender female controls
were reported on both intensity of spontaneous resting-state
activity and local synchronization of speciﬁc brain areas in the
frontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and cerebellum [113]. For
FTMs, resting-state activity in the cerebellum and frontal cortex
was correlated with circulating androgen levels.

Longitudinal studies. Again,
longitudinal studies of GAHT on
brain activation during task performance (Table 3) are uncommon
and focus solely on tasks with known sex differences in
performance (i.e., verbal ﬂuency and mental rotation). Sommer
et al. [118] reported that 3 months of GAHT may inﬂuence cerebral
activation patterns during language and mental rotation tasks in
transgender individuals (MTF = 8, FTM = 6), but lateralization of
language and spatial functioning is stable. The total
language-
related activation increased after GAHT compared with baseline in
both FTMs and MTFs (p = 0.08), and correlated to post-treatment
levels (p = 0.05). However, activation during
serum estradiol
mental rotation did not increase during treatment (p = 0.34), but
post-GAHT testosterone levels correlated with total activation
rotation (p = 0.01). The investigators did not
during mental
conduct whole brain analyses of effects of sex steroid treatment
on activation patterns for either task, but instead focused on task-
activated ROIs.

Another study also focused on whether activation patterns in
trans people were either more sex-typical or sex-atypical, but this
time with respect to resting state functional connectivity patterns
[119]. Similar functional connectivity patterns were found in 21
FTMs, 13 MTFs, 20 cisgender female controls, and 17 cisgender
male controls within the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and
working memory (WMN) networks. However, cisgender males
displayed signiﬁcantly greater functional connectivity in the right
caudate nucleus within the right WMN compared with cisgender
females. MTFs and FTMs did not differ signiﬁcantly in functional
connectivity, and they did not differ signiﬁcantly from either of the
cisgender groups as well. Functional connectivity also did not
appear to be affected by 4 months of GAHT in MTFs and FTMs or
by circulating sex steroids in the cisgender individuals. Therefore,
it is possible that the right WMN undergoes sexually dimorphic
differentiation between cisgender males and females, but this
differentiation is reduced in transgender individuals.

Performance on measures of empathy and emotional proces-
sing are also known to vary by sex [120–122]. Empathy scores and
resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) measurements were

examined in male and female controls as well as both MTFs and
FTMs prior to, and after 4 weeks and 4 months of GAHT [123].
MTFs differed at baseline from all other groups in a rsFC network
around the supramarginal gyrus, a region important for inter-
personal emotion processing, but became more similar to the
other groups over the course of GAHT administration. While taking
GAHT was not correlated with rsFC in this network, a GAHT-
independent association between empathy scores and rsFC was
found.

tasks for which there are typical sex
differences and in the direction that one would expect. No effect
was observed on at least one task (digit symbol) for which there is
no gender bias among cisgender individuals (Table 4) [124]. In
another sample, no differences in mental rotation performance
were observed between cisgender men, MTF individuals naïve to
GAHT, and MTF individuals after at least 6 months of GAHT
(Table 3) [113]. However, deﬁnitive conclusions from this study are
limited given its small sample size, cross-sectional methodology,
and lack of cisgender female control group.

FTM transgender individuals on androgen treatment for at least
6 months performed better than FTM subjects off treatment on
the same two visual memory tasks, but no differences were noted
for a verbal memory test [125]. Like the studies above, this ﬁnding
signiﬁes some correlation between GAHT and alignment of
performance to gender identity as opposed to natal sex. While
their performance on the male-biased task improved, no negative
effect was observed for performance on the female-biased task.
With regard to cerebral lateralization, which has been shown to
vary between the sexes in cis-gender populations, MTF transgen-
der subjects who received at least 3 months of GAHT demon-
strated less exclusive right-handedness as opposed to cisgender
control males, but did not differ signiﬁcantly in cognitive tests that
have been shown to favor one sex over the other (identical
pictures, 3D mental
rotation, building memory). No group
differences were found on the visual-split-ﬁeld or cognitive tasks
[126]. The cognitive test battery included three sex-speciﬁc tasks: a
female-biased perceptual speed test, a map memory test, and a
male-biased mental rotations test. Furthermore, there are no

Longitudinal studies. Cognitive performance also seems to be
affected by GAHT. Most studies (Table 4) suggest that GAHT in
FTMs enhances performance on visual memory [125] and 3D
spatial memory tasks [127, 128], and worsens verbal ﬂuency [128,
129] and arithmetic answering strategies [130].

A small sample of FTM transgender participants (n = 14)
tested before and after 6 months of androgen treatment
showed signiﬁcant improvement in their performance on a
visual memory task, a skill that generally tends to favor males
[125]. However, androgen GAHT did not have any inﬂuence on
verbal memory, which is a domain that typically favors females.
This indicates that androgens may have an activational effect on
visual memory in FTM transgender individuals, causing greater
alignment with the performance of their identiﬁed gender.
However, this study lacked an untreated transgender control
group for comparison.

An investigation on whether GAHT inﬂuenced test answering
strategy found no baseline differences between untreated
gender dysphoric (GD) males and cisgender male controls in
number of questions left blank on an arithmetic test.
In
subsequent retests 3 and 12 months post-GAHT initiation for
the GD group, cismale controls appeared to gain conﬁdence and
leave fewer items unanswered than the transgender group,
indicating that GAHT is associated with a lack of adjustment in
answering strategy in MTF individuals. No difference was found
between FTM individuals and cisgender control females at any
time point [131].

A pronounced effect of androgen treatment was found on
spatial ability in FTM subjects over a period of 18 months [127].
Untreated MTF individuals originally performed better on visuo-
spatial tasks than untreated FTMs, reﬂecting the typical male
bias on spatial ability. However, after about 10 months of GAHT,
the sex difference reversed, with both groups performing more
in line with their identiﬁed gender. This study demonstrates that
testosterone has an enhancing effect on spatial ability perfor-
mance, but no deteriorating effect on verbal ﬂuency in FTMs.

There is further evidence that androgens quickly affect cognitive
performance in FTM individuals [128]. For example, enhanced spatial
ability and deteriorating verbal ﬂuency are clearly associated with as
little as 3 months of androgen treatment, though there was no
control group for comparison in this sample of 22 FTM participants.
Later, this study followed up with an even bigger sample of FTM and
MTF transgender individuals and worked with a large battery of tests
on aggression, sexual motivation, and cognitive functioning [129].
Administration of androgens to FTMs over 3 months was strongly
associated with an increase in aggression, sexual arousal, and spatial
ability, as well as a decrease in verbal ﬂuency. Conversely, androgen
deprivation in MTFs was linked to a decrease in anger and
aggression, sexual arousal, and spatial ability, as well as an increase
in verbal ﬂuency. These ﬁndings offer support for the hypothesis
that GAHT can affect gender-speciﬁc behaviors, likely as a result of
speciﬁc brain changes.

Studies on the cognitive performance effects of GAHT over-
whelmingly support the gender-afﬁrming effect on cognitive tasks
that have shown well-established sex differences. Androgens
enhance “male-like” characteristics among FTMs and are associated
in performance on typically male-dominated
with decreases
cognitive tasks among MTFs.
longitudinal studies
suggest that the opposite is true for hormone manipulations used
by males transitioning to female. MTFs show a reduction in
performance on 3D visuospatial tasks [127, 129] and increased
verbal ﬂuency. Relatively few studies have concluded that GAHT
results in no change in verbal or visual spatial performance among
those transitioning from one gender to the other [25, 131, 132].

In contrast,

No differential effect on six cognitive abilities (perception,
arithmetic, rotation, visualization, logic, and verbalization) was found
between untreated cisgender control subjects and gender dysphoric
patients tested before initiating GAHT and 3 and 12 months after
[131]. Both the gender dysphoric individuals and controls show an
identical time-dependent improvement in cognitive performance,
perhaps implying that GAHT does not change sex-sensitive
cognitive performance in gender dysphoric patients. However, this
conclusion is weakened by the fact that the study used cisgender
individuals as the control rather than untreated gender dysphoric
patients.

In MTF individuals, there is reportedly no evidence that duration
or dosage of treatment over the course of 3–12 months was related
to any verbal ﬂuency, visual-spatial, verbal memory, and visual
memory outcomes [132]. These results suggest that MTF transgen-
der patients do not need to anticipate any appreciable changes in
sex-typed aspects of memory or cognitive function due to estrogen
treatment.

transgender individuals. Performance on four different visuospatial
tests revealed a linear increase in accuracy from cisgender female
controls, to FTMs (before GAHT), to MTFs (before GAHT), and ﬁnally
to cisgender male controls. Furthermore, after 14 weeks of GAHT,
there was no effect of sex hormones on the visuospatial ability of
transgender individuals, highlighting the lack of activational effects
of short-term GAHT with respect to this particular cognitive task.
Using a medium-sized sample of ~20 for each transgender group,
this study used standardized levels of GAHT, which makes for more
reliable conclusions across individuals.

GAHT effects on psychology and behavior
Studies of mental health among transgender people consistently
report alarmingly elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and
suicide risk [11, 133–138]. Though behavioral health risks generally
decline with GAHT [102], risk remains elevated above that of
cisgender
individuals matched for age, natal sex, and new
assigned sex [138]. No consensus has been reached regarding
the sex speciﬁcity of psychopathology; while some studies report
higher
incidence of psychopathology in transgender women
relative to transgender men [125, 140, 141], one study suggested
the opposite [142]. These symptoms of psychopathology are
thought to be the result of distress stemming from incongruence
between appearance and gender
identity, as well as social
rejection – prejudice, discrimination, and stigma [134, 143].
Consequently, many transgender people face greater socio-
economic barriers and disproportionately higher rates of sexual
abuse and assault.

Although being trans is associated with increasing mental
health problems due to social circumstances,
there is now
growing evidence suggesting that gender-afﬁrming social support
and GAHT are linked to better mental health outcomes. A 2-year
follow-up study observed a signiﬁcant reduction (p < 0.01) in body
dissatisfaction and GD after 3 months of GAHT in MTFs and FTMs,

[11]; and greater self-esteem,

Though GAHT is thought to enhance overall well-being, there
are different effects of estrogen versus testosterone therapies.
Androgen GAHT in FTMs has been shown to signiﬁcantly enhance
anger proneness, aggressive tendencies, sexual arousability, and
motivation, while feminizing treatment is associated with the
reverse in MTFs [129]. Anti-androgenic therapy, using the pure
antiandrogen nilutamide (Anandron®, Sanoﬁ Aventis) and no
estradiol, reduced sexual arousal and sexual desire after 8 weeks in
MTFs [146]. Nilutamide functions by blocking the biological effects
of androgens produced by the organism through competition at
the level of hormone receptors in androgen-sensitive tissues (skin,
prostate, pituitary, central nervous system, etc.). MTFs receiving 12
or more months of estradiol and progesterone were less likely to

Summary and future research directions
The extant literature describing neuroimaging outcomes among
transgender populations focuses primarily on questions of how
similar the brain of the transgender individual is to their natal
sex and whether use of GAHT enhances similarity between the
brain of their natal sex and that of their desired gender. Most,
but not all studies, indicate that the transgender individual is
more similar to their preferred gender with respect to cerebral
and gray matter volume and performance on gender-biased
cognitive tasks (e.g., verbal and spatial tasks). There is a signal
for GAHT to enhance the transgender individuals’ similarity to
their preferred gender.

While these outcomes may have been of interest in previous
decades, this information is not particularly useful or relevant to
most transgender individuals and their health care providers with
respect to their day-to-day quality of life. As discussed earlier, the
prefrontal cortex – the site of estrogen modulation of executive
function – is necessary for cognitive processes such as sustained
attention, working memory, organization, and planning. It is well
known that premature loss of estradiol among cisgender women
leads to signiﬁcant
risk for medical comorbidities of aging
including increased risk for executive dysfunction [18] and
dementia [63]. Whether the same is true for FTM individuals is
not known, but high dose testosterone variably diminishes
endogenous estradiol production in FTMs, leaving the individual
in a relative hypoestrogenic state. Therefore, the long-term effects
of hypoestrogenism in the context of hypertestoteronism should
be investigated.
If the logic behind PCOS and lower levels of
estrogen post-menopause were applied to current GAHT, then
one would expect
that suppression of estrogen levels and
increased testosterone levels in FTM individuals would impact
cognition and possibly adversely impact psychological well-being,
increasing irritability and impulsivity [73]. While cisgender males

steroids in utero for the transgender individual would create a
scenario that alters their need for various gonadal steroids for
optimal brain health across the lifespan.

Currently, investigations on the neuroanatomical changes in
transgender individuals after prolonged GAHT are too few in
number to examine the putative effects of GAHT on neuroa-
natomy. To date, there are no studies assessing the effects of
GAHT on functional network connectivity. Recent ﬁndings from
our laboratory indicate enduring impact of childhood adversity
on within network connectivity among early postmenopausal
cis-gender women [17]. That estradiol
treatment enhanced
within network connectivity among those women with high
levels of childhood adversity, but had no appreciable impact on
those with low levels of childhood adversity, suggests a
differential impact of gonadal steroids on brain structure and
function based upon adverse exposures during critical windows

Application of fMRI to the investigation of the transgender brain
and effects of GAHT is in its infancy, but holds promise as a tool to
determine regional and network effects of GAHT. Gonadal steroids
have a profound impact on brain structure, function, regional
connectivity, and neurochemistry [16] which underpin executive

functions, affect, and reward processing. It is critical that future
research considers these cognitive domains and focus substan-
tially less on “sexually dimorphic” cognitive processes which
typically show sex differences among cisgender individuals. We
would argue that learning and memory, the capacity to organize,
focus and manage one’s affect as well as appreciate the rewarding
nature of appetitive stimuli
is critical to long-term health and
quality of life. Special attention should be paid to effects of GAHT
on the neural correlates of behavior during the transition process
since research to date has not examined emotional or affective
responding despite high rates of affective disorders in this
population.

The currently available structural MRI studies also contain small
numbers of transgender adults and even fewer
transgender
adolescents. Given the profound impact of post-pubertal levels of
and ﬂuctuations in gonadal steroids on brain structure and
function, data obtained from transgender adults who are many
years post-puberty should not be extrapolated to adolescents who
choose to block their transition to puberty. Similarly, individual
factors such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, education,
exposures to childhood adversity, and lifetime stress or trauma
could dramatically impact central nervous system function during
critical windows of development leading to risk or resilience to
cognitive and mood changes during hormonal manipulations [2,
3, 149].

Furthermore, most studies to date have been cross-sectional
in nature, included small samples, and examined the effects of
short-term GAHT (≤18 months), though most individuals will use
GAHT for decades. There are no randomized controlled trials of
GAHT. Therefore experimental, longitudinal studies (>18 months)
must be prioritized, using neuroimaging methods to focus on
the effects of GAHT on brain regions/networks directly related to
accomplishing daily tasks, to allow direct comparison between
baseline and post-GAHT values. And given that the current
literature has almost exclusively treated gender as a binary thus
far (e.g., a person can be either male, female, FTM, or MTF),
future studies should consider gender as a spectrum to be more
inclusive to those who are transgender, gender non-binary,
gender non-conforming, gender ﬂuid, etc. In particular, research
should seek to include transfeminine and especially transmascu-
line individuals. Considering the majority of
transgender
research studies thus far have looked at MTFs, there are many
unanswered questions regarding the potential impact of high
dose testosterone on long term brain health of FTM and
transmasculine patients, with signiﬁcant causes for concern, as
mentioned above.

risk with hormonal

With more people identifying as transgender and requesting
GAHT, the ﬁeld of transgender health needs to be able to
provide better information about the potential brain effects of
long-term GAHT. Importantly, the bulk of the data suggests that
self-reported level of function and quality of life is improved
with GAHT, though still below that of cisgender individuals. The
relevance of neuroanatomical changes after
precise clinical
GAHT remains unknown. Characterizing the different modula-
tions associated with GAHT is critical, considering reports of
physiological
treatment and rates of
psychopathology in transgender individuals. Future studies are
required to replicate previous ﬁndings and examine whether
these neuroanatomical differences are associated with func-
tional or cognitive changes. In summary, we recommend that
upcoming brain imaging studies examine long-term (years) use
of GAHT, study sufﬁciently large samples to address potential
modiﬁers of hormone response (e.g., early life stress, hormone
levels),
for executive
function, broaden gender deﬁnitions beyond binarized male
and female identities, and enroll more FTM and transmasculine
individuals.
