health sector be mobilized to address these
problems (1).

In this issue of AnnalsATS, Suen and
colleagues (pp. 1709–1717) call attention to
the special challenges to social connectedness
that are experienced by persons living with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (7). In their study, the authors used
the Health and Retirement Study, a long-
running nationally representative cohort of
Americans over age 50, to compare the
prevalence of social isolation and loneliness
among community-living adults with and
without COPD. Social isolation was
ascertained using a measure drawing from
three distinct domains (household and core
contacts, social network interaction, and
community engagement), whereas loneliness
was deﬁned using the University of
California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale.
COPD and oxygen use were ascertained
through self-report. After accounting for
clinically relevant characteristics, the
predicted probabilities of both social isolation
and loneliness were signiﬁcantly higher
among persons with COPD. The difference
was particularly striking among the subgroup
of persons with COPD who required
supplemental oxygen, whose rates of social
isolation and loneliness were twice as high as
those among persons without COPD. In the
secondary analysis, the authors evaluated
factors associated with social isolation and
loneliness. They found that current cigarette
use, male gender, and self-reported non-
Hispanic White race and ethnicity were
associated with social isolation, whereas
younger age, being unmarried, and self-
reported diabetes or heart disease were risk
factors for loneliness. Lower socioeconomic
status, difﬁculty with functional activities
(activities of daily living), and depressive
symptoms were associated with both
outcomes.

A minor limitation of the study is that
the information used for the social isolation

and loneliness measures came from a paper
questionnaire that participants had to
complete on their own and return by mail
(a “leave-behind questionnaire”). For this
reason, it is possible that there is some
residual selection bias, if, for example,
persons with a particularly complex illness or
particularly severe social disconnectedness
returned their questionnaires at lower rates.
Suen and colleagues have deﬁned the

scope of a problem that many of us who
provide care for patients with chronic lung
disease have long suspected in our clinical
practices. In 2020, approximately 12.5
million Americans reported living with
COPD (8). Patients living with COPD report
a high burden of symptoms, functional
limitations, and conditions such as frailty
that limit their ability to be socially
connected in traditional ways such as
attending community groups or religious
services (9). Supplemental oxygen adds an
extra and substantial barrier to social
engagement. In addition to the stigmatizing
visibility of the oxygen tubing and delivery
device, the equipment poses logistical
barriers to social participation, including the
physical burden of carrying oxygen cylinders,
limited mobility because of being tethered to
an oxygen device, and fear of running out of
oxygen when leaving the home (10).

Tackling these issues in a meaningful

way will require efforts on multiple different
fronts. The most socially isolated patients
with COPD may have decreased their social
engagement to the point that their only
regular out-of-home interaction is at the
doctor’s ofﬁce, making the clinic perhaps the
only reliable setting in which to screen for
social isolation and loneliness. One could
envision asking patients to complete a brief
social isolation and loneliness questionnaire
before their visit, through the patient portal
or during intake. The clinic social worker
could then follow up with patients who
screen in and offer information about

Since the mid-1970s, hundreds of studies
have demonstrated the strong relationship
between social connectedness and health (1).
Social isolation, which involves an objective
lack of contact with other people, and
loneliness, which involves the perception of
insufﬁcient social contact, confer an
increased risk of mortality that is on par with
cigarette smoking (2). Both have been
associated with the development of chronic
illness, including heart disease, stroke, and
dementia (3, 4). Although social isolation
and loneliness were rising in prevalence
among Americans, even before the
coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic,
the pandemic exacerbated these trends (5).
Earlier this year, the Surgeon General
released an advisory identifying social
isolation and loneliness as an “epidemic” (6).
The advisory echoed a recent report from the
National Academies of Science, Engineering,
and Medicine in recommending that the

community resources to address social
isolation and loneliness. In many parts of the
country, there are “friendly visitor”
programs, with trained volunteers who
provide companionship and support, that
may be especially helpful for individuals who
are isolated or lonely because they have
difﬁculty leaving their homes (11).
Alternatively, connecting patients to support
groups for persons living with COPD may
help to address two of the key (and
modiﬁable) drivers of social isolation found
in this study: low community engagement
and infrequent social interaction. Telehealth
options are being increasingly recommended
for treatments such as pulmonary
rehabilitation in chronic lung disease (12);
whether telehealth support groups are
effective in reducing social isolation and
loneliness among patients living with COPD
should be an area of future research.
Furthermore, for patients with oxygen-

dependent COPD, policymakers should
advocate to increase insurance coverage of
portable concentrators, which are easier to
carry and facilitate mobility and social
engagement but are cost-prohibitive for
many patients (10).

There is also nascent but growing
momentum toward asking hospitals to help
in these areas. In 2020, for instance, nearly
half of the institutions providing data to the
American Hospital Association Annual
Survey reported that they already had some
sort of screening program and strategy in
place to address social isolation (13), and the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
have mandated that hospitals collect
screening data for health-related social
needs starting in ﬁscal year 2025 (14). Because
well over half a million Americans are
hospitalized with COPD every year (15), one
question of particular interest is whether
there are opportunities to identify those who

are vulnerable to developing worsening social
isolation or loneliness after hospital discharge.
Patients with COPD exacerbations experience
acute muscle dysfunction, which can lead to
functional disability and diminished mobility
(16). Work is needed to determine whether
social engagement deteriorates in the
aftermath of such episodes, and, if so, how to
prevent this from occurring.

Social isolation and loneliness have

become urgent public health issues of
our time. Suen and colleagues have
demonstrated just how common these issues
are among patients with COPD. It now
falls on all of us—clinicians, researchers,
policymakers, and health systems—to take
steps to identify and address social isolation
and loneliness as we care for our patients
with chronic lung disease. (cid:1)
