Abstract

Background: Improving the training of physicians about communication skills and patient health literacy (HL) is a
major priority that remains an open question. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of communication skills
training for physicians on the hypertension outcomes and the health literacy skills, self-efficacy and medication
adherence in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP).
Methods: A randomized, controlled trial method was conducted on 240 hypertensive patients and 35 physicians
presenting to healthcare clinics in the Mashhad, Iran, from 2013 to 2014. Using stratified blocking with block sizes
of 4 and 6, eligible patients with uncontrolled blood pressure were randomly allocated to the intervention and
control groups. Physicians in the intervention group received educational training over 3 sessions of Focus –Group
Discussion and 2 workshops. The control group received the routine care. The primary outcome was a reduction in
systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 6 months. The secondary outcome was promoting HL skills in
hypertensive patients. Data were analyzed using the regression model and bivariate tests.

Results: After the physician communication training, there was a significant improvement in physicians-patient
communication skills, hypertension outcomes, medication adherence, and self-efficacy among the patients being
managed by the physicians receiving training, compared to the control group.

Conclusion: The educational intervention leads to better BP control; it may have been sufficient training of
physicians change to impact counseling, HL and self-efficacy and adherence. The quality of physician-patient
communication is an important modifiable element of medical communication that may influences health
outcomes in hypertensive Iranian patients.

Background
Hypertension is an important chronic disease with a
high rate of mortality globally [1, 2], which has affected
about 1 billion people, and over 7 million people die
from it in the world, annually. According to recent stud-
ies, hypertension affects approximately 25–35% of the
middle-aged people in Iran [3, 4] which is introduced as
the first cause of mortality in Iran [5, 6].

There is growing evidence that developing patient ex-
perience is a potential way to improve the clinical health
outcomes and quality of life for patients with a chronic
condition; in part, this may be due to increasing patient
cooperation in the treatment process [7, 8]. Today, pa-
tient’s cooperation in the treatment process is not only
considered as a certain right but is also known as an
international gold standard for providers of medical care
services who are expected to achieve it [6, 9]. Thus, pa-
tients with chronic diseases need adequate HL skills to
control their disease and relevant side effects of disease
[10]. Several studies showed that effective physician-
patient communication has a strong incentive to im-
prove medical outcomes, patient HL, safety patient ad-
herence and psychosocial support [9, 11].

In the recent decade, health organizations have a focus
on using HL-informed provider-patient communication
strategies as a “universal precautions” approach. Further-
more, they tried to develop an inter-professional care
environment and a collaborative practice, which occur
when physician and healthcare providers work with pa-
tients from outside their profession and within their
own profession. This approach is sensitive to health pro-
fessional’s education program, and are in the pathway
linking medical outcome to medical education interven-
tions [12]. According to these strategies, health profes-
sionals can be trained to make better use of
their
knowledge and skills and they are able to more effect-
ively coordinate health care according to patients’ needs
[13], therefore, patients could receive a higher quality of
health care.

Poor physician-patient communication has been impli-
cated as the main barrier to improve HL and blood pres-
sure control in the Iranian population [14, 15]. Despite
the importance of communication skills training, little
experimental research has linked skilled physician com-
munication with patient HL and medical outcomes. Fur-
ther, the interaction between HL skills development and
health education interventions has not been well investi-
gated [9, 16] because it is unclear how/where physicians’
communication skills can influence patient HL skills and
medication adherence to control blood pressure targets
[17, 18]. Thus, there is an increasing need for assess-
ments of strategies, which improve physician-patient
communication quality, patient HL and health outcomes
in the medical care context [11, 19].

In this study, the primary objectives were to evaluate
the effectiveness of physician communication training
on hypertension outcome, level of HL skills, self-efficacy
and medication adherence among hypertensive patients.
Our hypothesis was that there is a direct association be-
tween effective physician communication training and
successful therapy for patients with hypertension. It is
also postulated that because medical system training can
overcome most of
that
directly link physician education to successful thera-
peutic. However, the link between health outcomes and
physician-patient communication skills is still unpredict-
able and thus available data are rare.

Methods
Study design
CONSORT guideline was used for conducting this trial.
This randomized, controlled clinical trial with two parallel
arms recruited 35 physicians and 240 hypertensive pa-
tients presenting to primary health care centers in Mash-
had, Iran, from September 2013 to August 2014. In Iran,
healthcare centers are a public sector to provide primary
health care services. This primary health care services are
provided free of charge in public facility and run by health
care professionals such as physicians, family health ex-
perts, nutritionists, midwives, and psychologists.

Participants
In this study, physicians were eligible for inclusion in the
study if they (a) did not attend in the communication
skills training, (b) participated as member in the Minis-
try of Health (MOH) sites, and (c) have experience to
provide health care services to at least five patients with
blood pressure. Physicians’ ages ranged from 26 to 51
(32.03 ± 9.12); they were residents and they provide pri-
mary care services, diagnosis, and treatment for patients
in the healthcare centers.

This study involved hypertensive patients in interaction
with the study of physicians. Patients were eligible for this
work if they (a) have uncontrolled blood pressure; (b)
carry a diagnosis of hypertension on at least five previous
clinic visits; (c) used at least one antihypertensive medica-
tion in the last 3 months, and (d) were age 18 or older.
They were excluded if patients (a) did not give informed
consent; (b) had suffered mental illnesses and disability.

Sampling and randomization
Sampling began upon the approval of
the ethics
committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences
(IR.MUMS.REC.1392.125) and the registration of the
study
Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials
(IRCT20160710028863N24). Data collection and recruit-
ment are conducted based on standard guidelines that
are described in detail elsewhere [20].

In this study, random allocation of healthcare centers
was conducted prior to individual recruitment (Fig. 1).
Six healthcare centers were randomly selected from a list
of centers. Healthcare centers were randomly assigned
(as the unit of randomization) to control with usual care
(n = 3 health care centers) and intervention (n = 3)
groups. All physicians in 6 healthcare centers were
screened, of whom 35 physicians meet the inclusion cri-
teria and they were invited to participate in the study.
Then,
they completed a Health Literacy Assessment
Questions (HLAQs) to assess their communication skills
before and after the intervention. The ratio of physicians
to patients in his study was 1:7 in each of the clinics.
Physicians in the intervention group received educa-
tional training, while the control group did not receive
educational training.

In this study, 940 patients’ medical records were ran-
domly screened, of whom 242 met the inclusion criteria
and 2 participants were lost from follow up. Finally, 240
hypertensive patients were included in the data analysis.
These patients were invited to attend in this survey and
asked to submit an informed consent form. Eligible pa-
tients who had completed the pretest questionnaires
were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 119)

and control (n = 121) groups (Fig. 1) using a computer-
ized table of random numbers and block randomization
with block sizes of 4 and 6. The randomization was per-
formed by a member of the study team who was blind
to patient assignment and sampling. During the study
period, health team members and physicians were aware
of allocated groups. Primary and secondary outcomes
were assessed by a person not involved in the sampling
and group allocation.

After the physicians’ training was conducted, all en-
rolled patients returned to the health care centers (both
control and intervention) for follow-up office visits and
asked them to complete a survey. A socio-demographic
questionnaire, HLAQs, patient medication adherence,
and provider counseling were completed by the patients.
The sample size used for this study was estimated
based on power analysis in which a power of 0.8 with a
confidence interval of 95% and an alpha of 0.05 for all
statistical analyses.

Data collection tools
The primary outcome in the 6th month included the
proportion of patients with controlled BP based on a re-
duction in systolic and diastolic BP. The secondary

outcomes were promoting patients’ health literacy skills,
self-efficacy and medication adherence in hypertensive
patients.

In this study, we used guidelines for cross-cultural adap-
tation (CCA) to translate all questionnaires into Persian
[20] (Additional file 1: Table S1). The structure intent and
content of questionnaires and their relevant items were
maintained in the Persian version, which leads to main-
taining the original scoring system in the adapted ques-
tionnaire. In this study, we used the content and face
validity assessment methods to measure the validity of the
relevant questionnaires (Additional file 1: Table S1). The
reliability of the HLAQs, self-efficacy, and adult primary
care were confirmed using a test-retest on 30 people.

The content validity index (CVI) for the HLAQs, self-
efficacy, and adult primary care questionnaire scales were
87, 86.2, 89% and content validity ratio (CVR) for these
questionnaires were 88, 82 and 91% respectively. The
Cronbach’s alpha was estimated as 0.91 for HLAQs, 0.92
for self-efficacy, and 0.93 for adult primary care question-
naire. Likewise, the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (95%
Confidence Interval) was estimated as 0.97 (0.79 to 0.99)
for HLAQs, 0.93 (0.82 to 0.95) for self-efficacy, and 0.95
(0.87 to 0.98). A demographic questionnaire, health literacy
assessment questions (HLAQs), Chew’s screening ques-
tions (CSQ), adult primary care questionnaire, and chronic
disease self-efficacy questionnaire were used in this study.
The demographic questionnaire, CSQ, adult primary care
questionnaire, and chronic disease self-efficacy question-
naire were completed by patients in both groups before
(baseline) and 1 and 6 months after completion of the
intervention (follow up) through a self-report. To assess
providers–patients’ communication skills, the HLAQs was
also completed by physicians in both groups before and 1
and 6 months after completion of the intervention.

In this work, uncontrolled BP was considered as an
“average systolic BP exceeded 140 mm/Hg or diastolic
BP above 90 mm/Hg; or BP above 130/80 for patients
with diabetes or renal insufficiency” [20]. Three BP mea-
sures were conducted in each medical checkup accord-
ing to the BP guideline, using an appropriately sized cuff
and a calibrated automated BP monitor (Snoqualmie,
WA, USA, BPTru device) after 5 min of rest, in the sit-
ting position, with no less than 1 min between measure-
ments. The average of the second and third measures
was used [21]. Measurements were completed for eli-
gible patients and physicians in both the control and
intervention groups at baseline (before educational train-
ing), and 1 and 6 months after completion of the educa-
tional training (follow up).

Physician communication skills
Health Literacy Assessment Questions (HLAQs) were
used to examine physician’s communication skills at

baseline and follow-up [22, 23]. This is a reliable and
in health care concepts to assess
valid instrument
provider-patient communication skills. This tool
in-
cludes three sections (spoken, written, and communica-
tion skills, patient-provider collaboration and support of
patient). This scale contained 33 items with a five -point
scale ranging from 0 (poor) to 4 (excellent) and higher
scores suggesting physicians have sufficient skills to im-
prove patients’ communication needs, quality of care
(e.g., respect and friendliness) and health-literacy limita-
tions, and successfully address them [23].

Patient health literacy
The Chew’s Screening Questions (CSQ) was used to
examine patients’ HL level. This scale has been devel-
oped based on the rapid estimate of a test of functional
HL in adults (TOFHLA) and adult literacy in medicine
(REALM) [24, 25]. This questionnaire includes 4 ques-
tions related to a problem learning about medical condi-
tions, confident to fill medical
forms and help read
hospital material. Responses for all items range from 1
(never) to 5 (always), which combined into a single pa-
tient satisfaction composite.

Medication adherence
We used the Adult Primary Care Questionnaire to
examine the effect of physicians’ communication train-
ing on improving medication adherence through 29
items [26]. Responses for the 2 first items were bi-
optional (1 = no, 2 = yes), while other items were 4-
points Likert Scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
These items asked the patients to assess whether or not
physicians guide them to hypertension-related issues in
improving medical care and patient concerns about
medications [23, 27].

Patients’ self-efficacy
The Chronic Disease Self-efficacy Questionnaire was im-
plemented to examine patients’ confident related to their
regularity tasks or certain activities [28]. This tool in-
cluded 33 items to examine the following scales: pa-
tients’
exercise,
communicate with the physician, manage the disease,
obtain help from the community, social activities, de-
pression items and manage/control
symptoms and
shortness of breath. All these items are scored based on
five points- Likert from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (to-
tally confident) [28].

Intervention
Eligible physicians in the intervention group were invited
to receive training, aiming to promote their communica-
tion skills with hypertensive patients. The intervention
in this study was conducted based on 3 sessions of Focus

Tavakoly Sany et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2020) 20:60 

Page 5 of 10

–Group Discussion (FGD) and 2 workshops (10 h per
session).

The FGD sessions, which involved physicians in the
intervention group (17 physicians), was conducted by a
health educator and cardiologist. In these sessions, phy-
sicians expressed their views and experiences of HL im-
provement in health care clinics with focusing on social
problems and patient’s communication needs. In the
FGD session, physicians also discussed the existing chal-
lenges used to create a successful therapeutic physician-
patient relationship. A third session, they concluded that
poor clinician support system, patient HL skills and
physician communication abilities (medical writing skill,
verbal ability, and collaboration) are main barriers to
control BP because the physicians do not regularly use
HL informed skills in communicating with patients and
their families (Table 1).

Two full-day workshops were conducted by a cardiolo-
gist in two consecutive weeks to improve communica-
tion skills between physicians and their patients. These
workshops were designed based on the Health Literacy
in Practice (HLP) model and standard treatment algo-
rithms for hypertension care and management based on
the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure Guidelines (JNC 7). HLP is a facili-
tated method to increase HL skills, medication adher-
ence and patients’ self-efficacy among patients with
chronic disease. Based on this method, physicians must
first understand their patients’ HL limitations and com-
munication needs to effectively communicate with them.
Likewise, this method emphasizes on patients’ under-
standing of the self-management abilities and patients’
concerns (side effect and medications) in order to teach
them correct methods to take medications [22, 23].

In the intervention group, the physician’s training was
conducted using a self-assessment checklist and training
package. The main target of these workshops was en-
hancing the physicians’ counseling skills that affect the
behavior change in hypertensive patients. All physicians
were trained to: help the patient in overcoming barriers
improve engagement with
to hypertension treatment,
patients, advice the patient about specific health behav-
ior, detect the patient’s sources in changing this behav-
ior, and improve patients’ HL skills to take higher
responsibility for their own self-care behaviors (Table 1).

Data analyses
In the present study, the bivariate analyses (t-test, chi-
square, ANOVA) were used to compare clinical and
socio-demographic characteristics between experimental
and control groups. The linear regression testing the ef-
fects of selected covariates (physition-patients’ commu-
nication skill) on the dependent variable (pations’ skills,

medication adherence, self-efficacy, diastolic blood pres-
sure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) scores).
The random-effects least squares regression model was
conducted to cluster patients within the physician. This
model included the main effects of study arm assign-
ment (control vs. intervention), time period (baseline vs.
follow-up), and their interaction. Statistical Package for
Social Sciences software (SPSS 16, Chicago, Illinois) and
R version 3.0.2 were used to produce accurate estimates.

Results
Physician and patients’ characteristics
In this study, the majority of eligible physicians were fe-
male (64%), had a mean age of 37.08 ± 7.52 years with
more than 8 years’ experience to provide primary health
care. The majority of hypertensive patients were female
(77.34%), married (82.3%), had a mean age of 54.8 ± 11.5,
less than diploma degree (42.8%) and employed (86.7%)
with an income of 100–200$ monthly (52.1%). Clinically,
a high percentage of patients had diabetes (43.6%) and
some patients were diagnosed with other comorbid con-
ditions (Table 2).

At baseline, 70% of hypertensive patients showed inad-
equate and marginal levels of HL (Chew). The results of
the physician-patient communication skills showed that
66.7% of the patients needed more support from the
physician and they had difficulty in written and spoken
communication. Self-efficacy was poor (58%; n = 139) or
moderate (40.8%; n = 98) for most patients and good for
only 1.2% (n = 3). The level of adult primary care ques-
tionnaire was low (160 patients; 67%) for most of the pa-
tients, while it was temporarily acceptable for 12.4% (30
patients) (Table 2).

Based on our results, patients with adequate HL were
significantly showed better medication adherence (ß =
0.19, p = 0.001), self-efficacy (ß = 0.14, p = 0.023), DBP
(ß = 0.13, p = 0.032) and SBP (ß = 0.12, p = 0.03) scores
than patients who have lower level of HL and communi-
cation skills. Similarly, educational attainment was sig-
nificantly associated with patients’ HL (ß = 0.15, p =
0.02) (Additional file 1: Table S2).

Educational intervention
A significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between
participants (physicians and patients) of
intervention
versus control groups at follow-up, and in change from
baseline to follow-up in all scores including physician’s
communication skills, patient’s HL skills, medication ad-
herence, patients’ self-efficacy, SBP and DBP (Table 3).
Random effects least squares regressions models also
showed the significant evidence in the change in physi-
cian’s communication skills (CI: 0.27, 0.91, P: 0.00), pa-
tient’s HL (CI: 0.22, 0.83, P: 0.00), medication adherence
(CI: 0.20, 0.67, P: 0.00), patients’ self-efficacy (CI: 0.14,

Discussion
Our findings showed that physician communication
training may directly impact hypertensive outcomes
(DBP and SBP), and more often it had an indirect effect
on hypertensive outcomes through its influence on
intervening variables (e.g., patients self-efficacy, patients’
HL skills, and adherence to treatment). As matter of
fact, health providers communication skills intervention
may do so directly by activating patients to talk about
their problem (medication, side effects, social and finan-
cial and problem), which prompts the physitions to im-
prove their communication skills, counseling behaviors,
clinical support and change medication, which leads to
better blood pressure control among patients [29, 30].
This result is in agreement with recent studies that
found effective physician-patient communication is the
heart of medicine in the delivery of health care [9, 11,

31]. In a sample of diabetic patients, 11% absolute modi-
fication in medication was observed in patients who per-
ceived by their physician to be effective communication
behavior [32]. Similarly, Schneider et al. in 2004 found
that higher level of the physician-patient adherence dia-
logue about chronic disease treatment, evaluated as the
ability to understand problems, the quality of physician’s
information-sharing methods, and suggest help with
medications, described the main variance between medi-
cation adherence and perceived quality of the physician-
patient communication [33].

Furthermore, we found that patients with higher edu-
cation were significantly associated with a high level of
HL and better medication adherence, which is in con-
trast with recent studies in hypertensive patients [29,
30]. These studies indicated that usually patients with
lower educational qualifications observed to be less
less healthy, to have
knowledge about medical care,
lower HL skills and more difficulties to understand and
read health care information [11, 34, 35].

This study is the first evaluation of communication skills
training implemented for physicians, which examine the

association between physician-patient communication
skills and medical outcomes among hypertensive patients
with low HL skills, who at much greater risk for the poor
quality of life and medication adherence to treatment than
that other populations [6, 23]. This study indicates the
short-term experiential physician communication skills
training to modify medical outcomes, patient HL for up to
6 months. This intervention program seemed to benefit all
health professionals, irrespective of baseline patient ex-
perience/HL skills.

Some limitations are worth noting. First, the duration of
the medical communications between the physician and pa-
tient was not evaluated. The importance of regular primary
care provider is well documented in hypertensive patients
because lead to significant patient satisfaction with the diag-
nostic than who do not have a continuity of care [6, 36].
Second, a self-report item was used to determine medica-
tion adherence and HL skills, which may overestimation of
each score level. Although, we checked overall authenticity
responses and we approved that these responses are closely
linked to clinical characteristics of patients. Further study is
still required to consider the strengths of subjective and ob-
jective assessment to detect the relevant compounds that
modify physician-patient communication and make actual
health outcomes. Likewise, a future investigation would
benefit from evaluating patient and physicians characteris-
tics (e.g., race, personality traits, age).

These findings highlighted the urgent need to develop
an effective intervention program during routine prac-
tice to improve collaboration between patient and phys-
ician. Despite the negative implications of low physician-
patient communication skills and patient’s health HL on
health outcomes, physicians and other health care pro-
viders are usually unaware of HL problems in their pa-
tients. Therefore, physicians need to be, first, aware of
what HL skills is, and how it can compromise caregivers’
ways to modify health outcomes in their patients. Sec-
ondly, the physician should be able to identify patients
with low HL skills and to plan appropriate educational
health education. In addition, the training program must
be systematically implemented for graduate medical edu-
cation to achieve effective collaborative communication
by a physician and other health providers. This is im-
portant to increase opportunities for medical students to
use open discussions and narratives into the curricula
because the use of these narratives is more likely to en-
courage their self-reflection during residency, a value
shared decision-making, increase their satisfaction and
confidence when using these communication skills dur-
ing patient interactions.

medical outcomes, medication adherence, and self-
efficacy. Our finding showed that physician with high
communication skills with their patients was associated
with better HL skills to improve their medical care.
Therefore, physician communication skills training ap-
pears to be an efficient way to clarify the needs of pa-
tients with limited HL and improve communication
challenges between patients and their physicians.
