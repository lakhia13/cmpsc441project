Abstract

Objectives:  To identify scalable evidence-based suicide prevention strategies.

Methods:  Searching PubMed and Google Scholar between September 2005-December 2019 
identified 20,234 articles. These included 97 RCTs with suicidal behavior or ideation as primary 
outcomes, and epidemiological studies of limiting access to lethal means, educational approaches 
and antidepressant studies.

Results:  Training primary care physicians in depression recognition and treatment prevents 
suicide. Educating youth regarding depression and suicidal behavior, and active outreach of 
psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses 
find antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual RCTs appear under-powered. 
Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. 
CBT and DBT prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for suicidal ideation or behavior 
is not proven to be better than just screening for depression. Education of gatekeepers about 
youth suicidal behavior lacks effectiveness. No RCTs are reported for gatekeeper training for 
adult suicidal behavior prevention. Algorithm-driven electronic health records (EHR) screening, 
internet-based screening and smartphone passive monitoring to identify high-risk patients are 
under-studied. Means restriction, including firearms, prevents suicide, but is rarely employed in 
the U.S., even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.

Conclusions:  Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and testing in other 
non-psychiatrist physician settings. RCTs are required to compare effectiveness of education of 
adult gatekeepers versus educating higher risk adults including most psychiatric patients. Active 
follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine and restricting 
firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider-use. Combination approaches in healthcare

systems show promise in reducing suicide in U.K., Denmark and U.S., but evaluating benefit 
attributable to each component is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating 
newer approaches like EHR-derived algorithms, internet-based screening methods, ketamine’s 
benefit for preventing attempts and passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change.

Introduction

Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. with 48,344 suicide deaths in 2018, 
and the second leading cause of death in ages 15–34 yrs.(1) Alarmingly, the age-adjusted 
suicide rate has steadily risen 36.7% from 2000 to 2018 (10.4/100,000 to 14.2/100,00).(2, 
3) This situation may be even worse. The 40.7% increase in the unintentional death rate 
from 2000 to 2017 is almost entirely due to unspecified falls (up 86.5%) and unintentional 
poisonings (up 98.5%), two causes that include misclassified suicides. The first U.S. national 
suicide prevention plan was proposed in 2000,(4) but from 2000 to 2012, the U.S. slipped 
from the 72nd to the 31st percentile worldwide in terms of suicide rate.(5) We will show that 
U.S. suicide rate increase relative to the rest of the world has happened in the context of 
under-utilized, proven suicide prevention options.

A critical review of suicide prevention methods is facilitated by an exponential increase 
in effectiveness data. The most widely cited review of suicide prevention was published 
in 2005.(6) From 2005 to 2019, over four times as many articles on suicide prevention 
were published compared with the previous 40 years (1966–2005). Therefore, we review 
all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining suicide, nonfatal suicide attempts and 
suicidal ideation. Benefits of reducing access to the most lethal methods used for suicide 
and the impact of prescribing antidepressants were examined using epidemiologic studies, 
mostly time series studies, some with contemporaneous geographic controls, identified using 
the same search engines. We focused on suicidal behavior as an outcome and not suicidal 
ideation, because there is closer a relationship between suicide deaths and nonfatal suicide 
attempts than there is between suicidal ideation and suicide deaths.(7)

Suicide risk can be understood in terms of a stress diathesis model (8) (Figure 1) where 
stress results from an internal stressor, usually a psychiatric illness, present in about 90% 
of all suicides and most commonly major depression, and/or an external stressor involving 
life events. The diathesis is a combination of heightened perception of emotional distress, 
a greater propensity to act on emotion, less learning and problem-solving capacity and 
a hypersensitivity to negative social signals and diminished sensitivity to positive social 
signals.(8) The diathesis moderates suicide risk, and that risk can be influenced by acute 
alcohol or drug abuse adversely via mood or disinhibition (Figure 1). Prevention measures 
can be aligned with these model components (Figure 1). Each method was judged by two 
criteria: (1) Does it prevent suicide attempts and not just suicidal ideation? and (2) Can 
it be scaled up to city, county, state and national levels, a requirement for broader suicide 
prevention?

The search used PubMed and Google Scholar for the period 2005 to 2019, in accordance 
with PRISMA standards for systematic reviews.(9) Search identifiers were suicide, suicide 
attempt, suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation combined separately with each of the 
following identifiers: prevention, control, depression, health education, health promotion, 
public opinion, mass screening, family physicians, medical education, primary health 
care, antidepressant medications, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, psychotherapy, 
schools, adolescents, methods, firearms, overdose, poisoning, gas poisoning, internet and 
mass media. The search was restricted to articles in English. RCTs with primary outcomes 
of interest: completed suicide, attempted suicide or suicidal ideation, were included because 
RCTs provide strongest evidence of efficacy of a prevention strategy. As evaluation of 
restricting access to more lethal methods of suicide, use of EMRs for screening algorithms 
and medication effects on suicide as an outcome, require large population studies due to 
the low base rate of suicide, we reviewed epidemiological studies emphasizing time-series 
designs, and studies at the city, county or general practitioner (GP) network level that 
employed a geographic control or practice control sites. Such studies, together with system 
level studies, provide an indication of prevention methods that can be scaled up to a 
national level (10). These studies were identified using the same search terms and engines 
as were employed for RCTs. From the 20,234 articles identified or their bibliographies, 
97 RCTs and 30 epidemiologic studies with suicide, attempted suicide or suicidal ideation 
as primary outcomes of interest were selected to evaluate prevention strategies (Table 1; 
Figure 2). Abstracts were reviewed to select studies for inclusion, and methods and results 
were obtained from the full text. Results are summarized for the main suicide prevention 
approaches in Table 1 in terms of proportion of positive outcome studies, and where there 
were replicated positive findings for reducing suicide attempts, we made a judgement as 
to whether that method is scalable based on complexity in terms of training and delivery 
as well as cost in terms of time and personnel. This approach is consistent with what 
others have recommended(10), as it builds from individual RCTs, preferably carried out in 
different localities or countries, in determining whether a prevention method can potentially 
be deployed more widely.

We examined education directed at health care professionals, patients or gatekeepers 
(military, first responders, school staff, clergy, college campus counselors, human resource 
departments and the general public).

General Practitioner and Non-Psychiatrist Physician Education—Doctors in 
primary care and other non-psychiatric care settings see 45% of future suicide decedents 
in the 30 days prior to suicide, and 77% within 12 months of suicide,(11) about double the 
rate consulting mental health professionals. Therefore, educating non-psychiatrist physicians 
may prevent far more suicides than further training for psychiatrists. Training primary 
care doctors and nurses at the local and state level to better screen and treat depression

with supplemental help available from psychiatrists, lowered suicide rates,(12–19) nonfatal 
suicide attempts(20, 21) and ideation(22) (Table 2). These findings support results from 
earlier studies (23–25) and studies of self-harm.(26) Repeated education sessions reduced 
suicide rates progressively for years.(12, 21) In contrast, a single day training session 
produced no benefit for suicide deaths over 3-years.(27) Areas with suicide rates 3–10 times 
higher than the U.S., have shown that screening for depression combined with referral for 
depression treatment by a primary care doctor or psychiatrist lowered suicide rates relative 
to a contemporaneous geographic control.(12, 15–17) Conversely, a study of 40 primary care 
medical practices in the Netherlands found a drop in depression recognition from 65% to 
44% was associated with higher suicide attempt rates in men.(28)

Education for Youth Suicidal Behavior Prevention—Although 4/9 prevention 
studies in youth reported less suicidal behavior (Table S1), 7/9 found less ideation (Table 
S1). A key factor appears to be the population targeted for education. Targeting high school 
students prevented student suicide attempts (29, 30) whereas targeting teachers (29) and all 
but one parent study (Table S1), did not find benefit. Of the two successful educational 
programing studies in high schools, the first study, involving 168 high schools and 11,110 
students, randomizing high schools to either a teacher/staff gatekeeper education program, a 
professional screening program with referral of identified at-risk students, student education 
about mental health (YAM) or a control group. YAM prevented suicidal behavior relative to 
the control condition, but the screening intervention and educating teachers/staff gatekeepers 
did not. In the second study, 4,133 high students were randomized to a mental health 
and suicide education program or control group. Less suicidal behavior was observed in 
the active intervention group relative to the control group over the next year. There are 
no controlled trials of targeted gatekeeper education in adults. Depression-management 
education of doctors lowers adult suicide rates (Table 2), but extending the education to 
other gatekeepers and the general public is not proven to further lower nonfatal and fatal 
suicide attempt rates.(31)

System-Level Education—A system-level approach shows promise in lowering suicide 
risk and involves applying a combination of education, training and screening. Such an 
approach lacks the capacity to measure the separate effect of each intervention component. 
One study examined the impact on suicide rates in 1,126 U.S. counties of interventions, 
funded by the Garrett Lee Smith Act, directed at young persons (ages 10–24 yrs.).(32) The 
legislation funded a range of interventions, including gatekeeper training (N=125,000) and 
screening programs to identify at risk youth (N=29,000 were screened). Of note, 73% of 
education recipients were students, and based on the Wasserman et al high school study(29), 
emphasizing student education may have been crucial for gatekeeper education being 
effective. Education also included mental health professionals and emergency department 
staff. The intervention counties exhibited a decline in youth suicide rates that did not extend 
to other causes of death in youth or to adult suicide rates, compared with 969 demographical 
and sociologically comparable counties where this program was not implemented. These 
findings indicate the benefit for suicide was found in the intervention counties and confined 
to the demographic group targeted by the intervention. Moreover, this benefit lasted for 2 
years beyond the intervention, and was proportional to the number of years the program

ran.(32) Follow-up found the benefit faded once programming stopped regardless of years it 
was implemented.

System-wide health care changes have not been tested in a randomized study but promising 
results have emerged from opportunistic before and after studies.(33) One study in the 
United Kingdom (34) found benefit for an array of clinical service changes including 
improved depression management, continuity of care from adolescent patient services to 
adult patient services, improved community services and lower staff turnover and found 
reduced suicide rates with incident rate ratios of .71–.79. The decline in suicide rates was 
observed in the study sample of 19,248 suicides who were in treatment within 12 months 
of death studied 1997–2012. This study did not control for changes in the secular suicide 
rate, and there was no randomization of the intervention, despite the fact that the poorest 
districts where the interventions were deployed had the greatest declines in suicide rates.(35) 
Denmark used to have one of the highest suicide rates in the World. In 1980, the annual 
suicide rate was 38/100,000 in those over age 15 yrs. Since 2007, the rate has stabilized 
at 11.4/100,000. The Danish suicide prevention effort has many components, and one of 
the most important was means restriction but other elements included a 66% increase in 
psychiatric services since 2000, establishment of Suicide Prevention Clinics, Psychiatric 
Emergency Outreach Teams and post-discharge program called Strengthening Outpatient 
Care After Discharge.(36) A U.S. study examined the effect of staff education and frequent 
screening of suicide risk in all psychiatric patients in the Henry Ford Health System that 
resulted in 9 consecutive quarters without a suicide compared with 80/100,000 suicides in 
2000. The program ran from 2001–2007, and the rate declined to zero in the period 2008–
2010, inspiring the notion of zero suicide as a goal for health care systems.

Implementing and sustaining such results is aspirational and is worthy of further evaluation.
(33)

Screening for suicide risk to identify otherwise undetected at-risk individuals,(30, 37) if 
coupled with effective referral for evaluation and treatment, was found by some studies to 
prevent suicidal behavior.(15–17, 37, 38) However, other studies did not finding screening 
and referral of at-risk high school students to be effective.(29) Brief screening tools like 
the P4, that assesses the 4P’s (past suicide attempt, suicide plan, probability of completing 
suicide and preventive factors), or the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), 
that assesses severity of previous suicidal behavior and current suicidal ideation, may 
improve triage.(37, 39) The 2014 United States Preventative Services Task Force report 
concluded there is insufficient evidence that screening, specifically for suicide risk in 
primary care, identified new cases beyond screening for a psychiatric disorder, distress 
or a past suicide attempt.(40) The C-SSRS predicted suicide attempts with an OR of 4.8 
(95% CI 2.23–10.32, p<.001) in adolescents and young adults following an emergency 
psychiatric evaluation.(41) Screening in the U.S. military(42) indicated current ideation 
added predictive power to a history of a previous suicide attempt. More complex EMR-
based screening, bypassing gatekeepers, may improve identification of higher risk patients.

TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS

Pharmacotherapy—Seventeen pharmacotherapy trials with suicidal behavior as an 
outcome (Table S2a), including twelve studies in adults, five pediatric studies and seven 
RCT meta-analyses(48–54), have appeared since the FDA(51) adopted black box warnings 
in 2004 and 2006 regarding psychotropic medication-related suicide risk in children and 
young adults, respectively. Medications reduced suicidal behavior in 4/12 adult studies,(55–
58) but those effective medications belonged to pharmacologically diverse classes. More 
promisingly, antidepressants reduced suicidal ideation in 9/12 studies that reported effects 
on suicidal ideation.(55, 57, 59–65) Meta-analyses of RCT data show more impressive 
benefit for suicidal behavior than individual RCTs. Meta-analyses of both RCT and 
pharmaco-epidemiological studies often found stronger effects than single RCTs, perhaps 
because they included a larger sample. Pharmaco-epidemiologic studies often involve a 
much larger sample and follow outcomes over a longer time frame and apply less stringent 
participant exclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of a more clinically relevant patient 
population, including dual diagnosis and more severe presentations. A meta-analysis of all 
FDA-registered randomized placebo-controlled studies of fluoxetine and venlafaxine found 
these medications decreased suicidal ideation and behavior.(49, 52) An FDA meta-analysis 
found antidepressants lowered risk of suicidal behavior in older age groups, but subsequent 
pharmaco-epidemiological studies found SSRIs reduced suicidal behavior more broadly, 
including in young adults.(66, 67)

There may be advantages for specific types of antidepressants. SSRIs target serotonin, and 
appeared more effective than noradrenergic drugs for suicidal ideation.(59, 61) Contrary 
to earlier FDA findings, SSRIs may work without increasing risk of treatment-emergent 
suicidal ideation or behavior, even in youth.(67–69) Longitudinal pharmaco-epidemiologic 
studies in adolescents, young adults and older adults indicated that the greatest risk for 
a suicide attempt was in the month before antidepressant medication began, and after 
the medication was initiated, the risk declined progressively over months.(66, 67, 70) 
Ketamine, an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, reduced suicidal ideation within 1–4 
hours in major depression(71–75) and bipolar disorder.(76, 77) Used adjunctively with other 
psychotropic medications, one RCT found ketamine’s benefit for suicidal ideation persisted 
for weeks,(72) but its effect on suicidal behavior has never been evaluated. The FDA 
approved intra-nasal esketamine for the treatment of depression with suicidal ideation, but 
not for the treatment of suicidal ideation. A meta-analysis found that intravenous ketamine 
improved suicidal ideation but other routes of administration lacked proof of efficacy.(78) 
The intra-nasal route may be less effective because of more erratic absorption and more side 
effects than the more slowly administered intravenous dose.(78)

Two of four RCTs showed benefit for suicidal behavior with lithium compared with 
various other medications.(55, 58, 79, 80) A meta-analysis of RCTs in bipolar disorder 
found no data on lithium’s effect on suicide prevention(81), however a meta-analysis of 
non-randomized studies suggested that risk of attempts and suicide was 5 times less with 
lithium treatment.(82) Although one study found no correlation between bipolar disorder 
and many other psychiatric disorders with lithium levels in drinking water (83), 11/16 
ecological studies report these levels were linked to lower suicide rates.(84)

Three adolescent and young adult RCT studies found antidepressants reduced suicidal 
ideation,(62, 64, 65) one did not,(85) and none found a reduction in suicide behavior. One 
systematic review of antidepressants in pediatric populations found SSRIs increased odds 
of a suicide attempt,(53) but most subsequent meta-analyses and epidemiological studies in 
both pediatric(48),(50) and adult populations(49, 52, 66, 67, 86) reported a more favorable 
risk-benefit ratio than the FDA analyses,(51, 87) including benefits for suicidal behavior. 
The FDA meta-analysis of pediatric RCTs did not find a difference in suicidal behavior 
between placebo and active drugs(88), and even in the adolescent studies that reported more 
suicidal events compared with placebo, the number needed to harm (suicide-related event or 
ideation) is much greater than the number needed to benefit.(89)

Psychotherapy—Psychotherapy RCT studies are summarized in Table S3a. Cognitive 
behavior therapy (CBT) decreased suicidal behavior risk in adults and adolescents with 
depression, adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and halved suicide re-attempt 
rates in patients presenting to an emergency department following a recent suicide 
attempt compared with treatment as usual (TAU).(90) CBT for suicidal individuals is 
designed to help high-risk individuals apply more effective coping strategies (e.g., cognitive 
restructuring) in the context of stressors and problems that trigger suicidal behaviors. 
Therapists also are trained to identify patient-specific factors that maintain suicidal 
behaviors (90, 91). In substance use disorders, CBT reduced attempt frequency compared 
with TAU in adolescents(92) but not in adults.(93) CBT may work by improving negative 
problem orientation and emotion regulation,(94) reducing impulsiveness(95) and attenuating 
suicidal ideation.(96)

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for BPD in adolescents, college students and adults 
prevented suicide attempts, hospitalization for suicidal ideation and lessened medical 
consequences of self-harm behaviors compared with treatment as usual (Table S3a). 
Treatment dose may be a factor because a single-session of dialectical behavior therapy 
did not reduce suicidal ideation,(97) whereas most effective studies employed a 20-week 
DBT intervention.(98, 99)

Psychodynamic psychotherapies for BPD prevent suicidal or self-harm behavior in 
most controlled studies (Table S3a). There are no replicated studies of other types 
of psychotherapeutic interventions showing prevention of suicidal behavior. Even if 
psychotherapies were effective, only CBT appears to be scalable (Table 2).

Comparison of Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy—Given efficacy evidence 
for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy separately, combinations of both showed no 
advantage for suicidal behavior (Table S3b).

Group Psychotherapy—Group psychotherapies reduced suicidal ideation in 5/10 
studies(100–109) and suicide in one,(100) but none reported reducing nonfatal suicide 
attempts (Table S3c). Cost effectiveness and potential for scaling are moot without 
replicated efficacy for suicidal behavior.

Contact and/or Active Outreach following a Suicide Attempt or Suicidal 
Ideation Crisis—The greatest risk of suicidal behavior is after discharge from the 
emergency room (ER) or hospital inpatient units.(110–112) Follow-up contact interventions 
as simple as sending postcards prevented suicide attempt in 2/4 studies (Table S4), 
consistent with older studies that found a robust benefit for reducing suicidal behaviors.
(110) Enhancing treatment engagement and compliance following an ER visit or hospital 
stay through follow-up contact calls, reduced attempts or ideation in 4/5 studies (Table 
S4). These interventions are scalable as shown by a multi-national study reporting 
psychoeducation paired with phone or in-person contact reduced the suicide rate over 18-
months in suicide attempters.(113) Another study used a similar approach by sending caring 
text messages over one year to active military personnel who had reported a suicide attempt 
(50%) or suicidal ideation, but not in the context of discharge from hospital or ED. The 
intervention lowered subsequent suicide attempts by almost half.(114) A cohort comparison 
study of safety planning interventions, administered in ED with follow-up telephone contact 
produced a 45% reduction in suicidal behaviors vs. TAU.(115)

Brain Stimulation—Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and 
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) reduced suicidal ideation, but samples were too small to 
evaluate effects on attempts (Table S2b). Deep Brain Stimulation has also not been shown to 
prevent suicide attempts (Table S2b).

Collaborative Care—Collaborative care involves embedding psychiatric healthcare 
expertise within a primary care setting, army units and schools to enhance mental health 
care. This benefited suicidal ideation, but mostly did not prevent suicidal behavior. The 
exceptions are a collaborative care program involving lay health workers in both primary 
and private care settings(116), and depression screening studies in which psychiatrists 
oversaw the antidepressant treatment resulting in reduced suicide rates in both men and 
women (Table 2). By contrast, when GPs delivered this treatment, it worked in women but 
not men (Table 2).

Internet-Based Interventions—Internet-based interventions have not been shown to 
prevent suicidal behavior (Table S5) but are highly scalable. Only 3/10 studies reported 
benefit for suicidal ideation(117–123) (Table S5). Internet-based interventions can reach 
most untreated at-risk individuals and provide low-cost screening, psychoeducation and 
web-based psychotherapeutic treatment interventions. Adolescents disclosed comparable 
information about their mental health via web-based and paper-and-pencil screening forms.
(123) Online interventions increased suicide-prevention related knowledge,(124) but not all 
improved suicide literacy or reduced suicide stigma.(122) Internet CBT, with or without 
phone follow-up, was not more effective compared with waitlist controls for reducing 
suicidal ideation.(121, 125) A game-like mobile app showed promise in reducing self-injury 
and suicide plans, but not suicidal ideation.(126)

MEANS RESTRICTION

Restricting access to the most available and lethal means for suicide, such as firearms, 
lowered suicide rates using the restricted method,(127–137) and lowered overall suicide

rates when the method was sufficiently widely used.(127, 130–135) Pesticide ingestion 
was employed in approximately one-third of suicides worldwide, mostly in rural Asia and 
Latin America.(138) Centralized locked or guarded storage facilities combined with use of 
less toxic chemicals have contributed to a worldwide decline in pesticide suicides.(129) 
Banning pesticides in Sri Lanka reduced pesticide-related suicide rates without a concurrent 
increase in non-pesticide suicide deaths.(139) Firearm suicide rate was closely related to 
firearm ownership rate.(140) Firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.(130, 131) 
Gun access restriction and gun safety robustly reduced firearm suicides with only modest 
method substitution.(127, 132–135) Firearm buyback programs have reduced firearm-related 
suicides (141), but legal precedents and public opinion have undermined gun control and 
buyback programs, so the U.S. has not been able to emulate implementation of such 
programs, or achieve the reduction in firearm suicides seen in other countries. Improved 
gun safety is more feasible than reducing gun ownership in the U.S. because of legal 
impediments to national gun control, and most guns used for suicide were purchased years 
prior to the suicide.(132) Other proven means restriction approaches include better car 
catalytic converters that reduce carbon monoxide content,(136, 142) switching from coal gas 
to natural gas, which has low carbon monoxide content,(128) and barriers at hotspots such as 
bridges and railway stations.(137)

Discussion

Applying the criteria of replicated efficacy for preventing suicidal behavior (Table 1) and 
scalability means that the best options for suicide prevention are: (1) educating primary care 
physicians in depression management and evaluating the expansion of such programs to 
other non-psychiatric medical specialties such as internists and obstetrician gynecologists; 
(2) educating high school students about mental health and evaluating extension of 
this approach to college students; (3) means restriction; and (4) pre-discharge education 
and follow-up contact and outreach for ER and hospital psychiatric patient discharges 
and in patients following a suicide crisis. Effective, but less scalable, are (5) specific 
psychotherapies (CBT, DBT). Finally, there are unproven options that are scalable and 
promising: (6) fast-acting medications like ketamine; and (7) internet-based screening and 
treatment delivery and continuous passive monitoring of risk.

Educating non-psychiatrist primary care physicians to better diagnose and treat major 
depression prevents suicide and non-fatal suicide attempts (Table 2). Several related 
observations explain why. Approximately 90% of suicides have a current diagnosable 
psychiatric disorder, most commonly a major depression that was untreated at time of 
death.(111, 143, 144) In 2015, 9.8 million persons (4% of all those aged 18 years and older) 
in the U.S. had serious thoughts about attempting suicide and yet more than half received 
no mental services in the prior year. The result: 1.47 million persons (0.6%) made a suicide 
attempt.(145) Despite a large increase in antidepressant prescription rates,(49, 52, 59, 66, 86, 
146) when suicide decedents seek help, they go to non-psychiatrist physicians.

The debate about the safety of antidepressant in adolescents and young adults needs to be 
informed by the 17 RCTs (Table S2a) as well as meta-analytic and pharmaco-epidemiologic 
studies(48–50, 52–54, 66, 67, 86) published since the FDA promulgated the black box

warnings for many classes of psychotropic medications. Both pediatric and adult studies 
of antidepressant effects on suicidal behavior show reductions in suicidal behavior in meta-
analyses, more readily than in individual RCTs, probably because the low base rate of 
suicide attempts requires larger sample sizes. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation within 1–4 
hours, instead of weeks like other antidepressants, in major depression(71–73) and bipolar 
disorder.(76, 77) Rapid, robust reduction of suicidal ideation may dramatically increase 
patient safety, but its effect on suicidal behavior is unknown and a priority for suicide 
prevention research. More information is needed on the relative efficacy of intra-nasal and 
intravenous ketamine. The urgency around finding effective COVID-19 antiviral medications 
needs to be brought to the evaluation of medications that may act as rapidly to prevent 
suicide.

Educating other gatekeepers about the signs of suicide risk and need to refer for help 
raises questions about who to focus on for the best results (Table S1). Two studies in high 
schools found pupil education prevented suicide attempts (29, 30), with one finding it more 
effective than teacher/gatekeeper training, the latter was no better than the control arm of the 
study.(29) In the absence of data from RCTs on whether training adult gatekeepers prevents 
suicidal behavior in adults, colleges, universities, military and police try educate everyone in 
their system.

Screening for suicidal ideation in school, college, medical clinic and military populations, 
seeks to identify otherwise undetected at-risk individuals. Although it does not induce 
subsequent suicidal ideation,(38, 147) screening a non-help-seeking population for suicidal 
ideation and nonfatal suicide attempts, beyond screening for major depression, remains 
a debated approach.(40) Newer promising approaches may involve using smartphone 
technology to detect risk(148, 149) and algorithm-guided electronic medical record 
screening.(43, 44, 46, 150)

CBT, DBT and individual psychodynamic psychotherapies prevent suicide attempts, but 
aside from CBT, scalability limits their value in suicide prevention. Combining medication 
with individual psychotherapy does not offer any measurable advantage. No brain 
stimulation therapies have demonstrated suicide behavior prevention.

Sleep disturbance(151) and effects on mood and decision-making by acute alcohol 
intake(152) are risk factors for suicidal behavior that warrant further evaluation as potential 
prevention targets.

The greatest risk for repeating a suicide attempt is in the month following an index attempt, 
and particularly after discharge of a psychiatric patient from an emergency department 
or inpatient hospital unit.(110–112) Pre-discharge education and assertive outreach after 
discharge, prevent suicide attempts (Table 2; Table S1). Surprisingly, this approach has not 
been widely adopted in the U.S. and may reflect gaps in continuity of care between inpatient 
and outpatient systems and between emergency departments and outpatient care. Calibrating 
suicide prevention efforts to times of greater risk as well as to patients showing higher risk 
clinical profiles would be more efficient and potentially effective.

The internet has great potential for suicide prevention by screening, education, outreach, 
referral, monitoring of ongoing risk and treatment, but applications are new and testing their 
efficacy still in progress.(120–122, 153) Internet-based interventions are economical and 
scalable, reaching untreated at-risk individuals and offering help to anyone with a phone and 
WiFi access. Passive monitoring via a smartphone is an inexpensive, but untested, method 
for tracking risk.

Most suicide attempter survivors do not ultimately die by suicide, which is why means 
restriction, targeting the most lethal methods, saves many lives.(154, 155) Surprisingly, 
faced with no access to their chosen method, most individuals do not turn to alternative 
means for suicide, as shown for coal and gas(156) or firearm restriction.(127) Means 
restriction needs to target the main means used in each region. Firearms are used in half 
of all suicides in the U.S.(1) Yet restricting access of at-risk individuals to firearms in the 
U.S. is under-utilized.(132) Gun buy-back programs have worked in other countries(141) 
and, together with safer gun storage, are needed in the U.S. because most firearms used for 
suicide were purchased years earlier.(157) Pesticides are highly lethal, the leading suicide 
method worldwide, and the decline in suicide deaths worldwide is largely due to restricting 
access to pesticides where those deaths happen, namely in rural China,(138, 158) India(129) 
and Sri Lanka.(159)

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY

The major limitation of this review is the uneven quality and quantity of data available 
for different suicide prevention strategies. Within strategies there is heterogeneity of study 
populations in terms of psychiatric illness, proportion of higher risk patients such as 
those with a history of a past suicide attempt, age, ethnicity and proportion of males 
(because males have 3–4 times the suicide rate of females). Higher risk groups (e.g., Native 
Americans, First Nations), demographic groups like children and the elderly, and psychiatric 
disorders like schizophrenia, eating disorders or substance use disorders, are understudied. 
Small sample sizes, too few studies and lack of replication studies prevent firm conclusions 
about many approaches. Suicidal ideation as an outcome measure is not as closely related 
to suicide as are nonfatal suicide attempts. Evaluating complex interventions with multiple 
components makes it hard to determine the effective elements. Finally, there is a need for 
objective criteria for determining which interventions are capable of being scaled up from 
local studies to national level deployment.

CONCLUSIONS

Education of primary care physicians, and potentially internists and obstetricians, in the 
diagnosis and treatment of depression is a robust suicide prevention approach. Other proven 
scalable strategies (Table 1) are: (1) follow-up of discharged and other acutely suicidal 
patients with active outreach; (2) CBT; and (3) means restriction. Education directed at 
youth prevents suicidal behavior but when directed at teachers does not; no RCT data 
are available for prevention of adult suicide. Any prevention program requires outcome 
assessment that must include suicidal behavior and preferably mediating effects such as 
help-seeking behavior, treatment provision and treatment compliance. The biggest challenge 
in suicide prevention is improving the identification of who is at high risk and when.

Determination of imminent risk is needed for calibration of prevention efforts to high 
risk periods by employment of rapid reduction of suicidal ideation and means restriction. 
Fast-acting medications like ketamine may have a role during acute suicide risk but are 
untested for prevention of suicide attempts. Determination of imminent risk has evolved 
towards continuous monitoring via mobile devices.(148, 149) Future work is needed to 
evaluate such approaches and how to integrate them into prevention responses.

Greater female suicide 
reduction in intervention region 
compared with control region 
(IRR =.35). No regional 
difference in male suicides.

Greater reduction in 
intervention region female 
suicide at a trend level 
compared with control region 
(IRR =.23). No regional 
difference in male suicides.

Greater reduction in female 
suicide rates in intervention 
region compared with control 
region (IRR =.43). No regional 
differences in male suicides.

Trend level reduction in female 
suicide rate in the intervention 
region (IRR=.26) but not in the 
control region. No change in 
male suicide rate.

Pre-intervention (1970–1994), 
suicide rate was higher in 
Jamtland county than Sweden 
(p<.05), but during intervention 
period (19952002) it dropped in 
intervention region, so the two 
rates no longer differed.

Decrease in suicide rate in 
intervention region greater than 
the larger county (p<.001) and 
Hungary (p<.001).

Intervention group more likely 
than to receive antidepressants 
or psychotherapy (p<.001), and 
those with major depression 
had lower rates of SI at 4, 
8, and 24 months (p=.04). No 
difference in SB.

Intervention region had greater 
reduction in suicidal acts 
(suicides + SA) (p<.0065) and 
SA (p<.0005) versus control 
from baseline to 1-year follow-
up of the 2-year intervention 
(2000–2003). The reduction in 
SA was more pronounced for 
high-lethality than low-lethality 
methods and persisted for four 
years.

The suicide rate declined in the 
intervention region (p=.02) but 
not in the control region.

Studies used a control region as a comparison and examined time periods before and after intervention onset. For such community level 
intervention studies there were no inclusion or exclusion criteria employed.

**

Study used physicians who did not attend GP training as control group for two regions and had one region as additional control, pre-post 

intervention time periods were examined.

General Practitioner Inclusion Criteria: on a list provided by Australasian Medical Publishing Company, worked at least 2 days per week, had at 
least 50 patients aged 60+ who spoke English, and were not planning to retire or move practice within the next two years. Sample size: GP N=373 
(with N=21,762 patients aged 60+), intervention GP N=188 (N= 11,402 patients aged 60+), control GP N=185 (N= 10,360 patients aged 60+).

##

Patient Inclusion Criteria: treated at one of the 20 primary care practices participating in the study, aged 60+, met DSM-IV criteria for major or 
minor depression, defined as 3–4 depressive symptoms, score on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) ≥10, and a duration of at 
least 1 month. Sample size: Patients N=599, intervention N=320, control N=279.
