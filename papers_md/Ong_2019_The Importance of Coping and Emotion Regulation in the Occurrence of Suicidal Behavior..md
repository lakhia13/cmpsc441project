Abstract
Research has shown that the use of maladaptive coping strategies and difficulties in
regulating mood are linked to increasing risk of suicide. This study measured the
impact of coping and emotion regulation on suicidal behavior in a sample of Asian
students. The aim was to determine whether different coping strategies and methods
of expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal would be associated with suicidal
behavior. One hundred and twenty undergraduate students were recruited from
The Open University in Hong Kong and all completed questionnaires that measured
coping, emotional regulation, and suicidal behavior. The results showed that
increased avoidance coping was associated with increased suicidal behavior,
whereas increased cognitive reappraisal was associated with reduced risk of suicidal
behavior. Specifically, in an Asian student population, avoidance coping appears to
be a risk factor for suicide, while cognitive reappraisal may be seen as a positive,
protecting strategy.

Introduction

Suicide is not an isolated process, but rather is conceptualized as a continuum of
processes starting with suicide ideation (SI; the recurrent thoughts of committing
suicide), moving to the formation of a suicide plan, a suicide attempt, and then
ﬁnally suicide completion (Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 1996). These stages are
all referred to as aspects of suicidal behavior, and to prevent suicide at an early

point, it is important to identify the risk factors that lead an individual to engage
in SI and then continue through the suicide path.

Although researchers have established risk factors associated with suicide
including depression, poor coping abilities, higher avoidance of stressors, and
a lack of close social relationships (John & Gross, 2004), the work has had
limited success in predicting and preventing suicide based on the identiﬁcation
of these risk factors. This is because many individuals experience similar nega-
tive situations but not all will consider suicide (Bazrafshan, Jahangir, Mansouri,
& Kashﬁ, 2014). Therefore, it is postulated that when faced with a situation,
some individuals are more motivated to proceed to a suicide act, while others are
more resilient and will not engage in suicidal behaviors. This raises the question
as to whether some individuals may have speciﬁc capabilities that make them
less prone to suicidal behavior.

Emotion regulation and suicidal behavior

Rajappa, Gallagher, and Miranda (2011) examined how suicidal behavior was
linked to diﬃculties in managing negative mood (also referred to as emotion
regulation). Emotion regulation is a set of regulatory processes that can be used
to redirect emotions in order to modify the magnitude, latency, and duration
of aﬀective responses (Miranda, Gaudreau, Debrosse, Morizot, & Kirmayer,
2012; Thompson, 1994). It includes the management of both positive and
negative emotions that arise under a wide range of stressful and non-stressful
situations (Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen, & Wadsworth, 2001).
Rajappa et al. (2011) studied the links between emotion regulation and suicide
by measuring diﬀerent emotion regulation strategies (e.g., awareness, clarity,
non-acceptance, impulse, goals, and strategies) among young adults with vary-
ing experience of suicidal behavior. The sample included 17 adults who reported
current SI, 20 with one past suicide attempt, 17 with multiple suicide attempts,
and 42 control participants with no history of suicide. Results showed
that failure to adopt these emotion regulation strategies and non-acceptance
of emotional responses signiﬁcantly predicted SI. Rajappa et al. (2011) suggest
that suicidal behaviors are attempts to escape negative emotions and they
present when individuals lack emotion regulation strategies in response to
emotional distress. The ﬁnding shows the importance of emotion regulation in
suicidal behavior.

The process model of emotion regulation (Gross & John, 1998) outlines two
emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression.
Cognitive reappraisal is deﬁned as the attempt to reinterpret an emotion-eliciting
situation in a way that alters the meaning and changes the emotional impact
(Gross & John, 2003). Cognitive reappraisal aims to reduce negative emotions
by changing the interpretation or appraisal of aﬀective stimuli. For example, an
individual experiencing anxiety at a job interview may try to reframe the

1194

Psychological Reports 122(4)

stressful situation as a learning experience. In contrast, expressive suppression is
an attempt to hide, inhibit, or reduce on-going emotion-expressive behavior.
For example, an individual may try to disguise their anxiety at a job interview
by breathing slowly and trying to appear conﬁdent. Cognitive reappraisal is
employed before an emotional response has been fully generated or activated
(Gross & Thompson, 2007; Ochsner, et al., 2004; Ochsner, et al., 2004) and is
focused on altering the eﬀect of emotion-generating cues. It is referred to as an
antecedent-focused strategy (Gross, 1998). Expressive suppression is a response-
focused strategy that acts later in the emotion generation process and attempts
to modify the behavioral expression of the emotion after it has been experienced
(Gross, 2002; Gross & John, 2003).

The importance of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression

Cognitive reappraisal is considered to be a more eﬀective method to regulate
emotion and physiological arousal, because it requires fewer cognitive and
physiological resources compared to expressive suppression (Ochsner, Silvers,
& Buhle, 2012). In addition, because cognitive reappraisal occurs before the
complete activation of emotion response tendencies has taken place, regulating
emotion in this way does not create a discrepancy between inner experience and
outer expression that is experienced in expressive suppression. Individuals who
frequently use expressive suppression are less aware of their own feelings and
often experience disruptions in social relationships (Butler et al., 2003; Gross &
John, 2003). It is argued that this strategy is accompanied by a resistance to seek
and receive help, and consequently, individuals who engage in expressive sup-
pression tend to have less social support, poor coping abilities, higher avoidance
of social situations, and a lack of close social relationships. All of these factors
are known to increase the risk of suicidal behavior (John & Gross, 2004).

In contrast to the negative impact of expressive suppression, Gross and John
(2003) have found that those who primarily engage in cognitive reappraisal are
more likely to share their emotions (both positive and negative) with others and
maintain close relationships with friends. They also use more self-regulation stra-
tegies in the form of coping and have a stronger social network compared to
expressive suppressors. Coping involves both cognitive and behavioral eﬀorts
aimed at reducing or controlling a stressor (Stone, Helder, & Schneider, 1988,
p. 183). Coping is associated with maximizing the experience of positive
emotions, reducing the impact of negative emotions, and enabling adaptive out-
comes in individuals (Bonanno & Burton, 2013; Carlson et al., 2015; Sheppes
et al., 2014). Although coping is sometimes conceived as a special category of
emotion regulation under the presence of stress (e.g., Eisenberg et al., 2007), it is
primarily directed at decreasing negative aﬀect to a stressor (Compas et al., 2013;
Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). In contrast, emotion regulation can be applied to a
wider range of circumstances (stressful and non-stressful) than coping (e.g., Gross

Ong and Thompson

1195

& Thompson, 2007). For example, emotion regulation may involve the management
of positive emotional responses such as suppressing a laugh when seeing someone
trip over on the street, whereas coping is exclusively limited to responses to stressors
(Compas et al., 2013). In addition, coping is generally considered to be longer lasting
and is often applied to stressors such as bereavement or diagnosis of a chronic
condition (Carver, Scheier, & Weintraub, 1989). In contrast, emotion regulation
usually occurs over a relatively short time frame and varies considerably with dif-
ferent goals and situations (Gross & John, 2003).

In a series of ﬁve studies, Gross and John (2003) investigated individual dif-
ferences in the use of suppression and reappraisal among undergraduate stu-
dents (N ¼ 1483). All participants were asked to complete self-report measures
of depression (indexed by the Beck Depression Inventory; Beck, Steer, & Brown,
1996), positive wellbeing (using the Ryﬀ Scales of Psychological Well-Being;
Ryﬀ & Keyes, 1995), and emotion regulation (using the Emotion Regulation
Questionnaire [ERQ]; Gross & John, 2003). They found that the use of expres-
sive suppression was associated with lower levels of positive wellbeing and
higher levels of depression. It was suggested that when participants try to sup-
press negative emotions, they mask their inner feelings and minimize outward
displays of emotion. Consequently, these individuals are less honest about how
they are feeling, they are less eﬀective in regulating their negative emotions, and
they view their emotions in a less favorable or accepting way (as indicated by
low scores on the subscale of ‘‘self-acceptance’’
in the wellbeing measure).
Contrary to the use of expressive suppression, individuals who used cognitive
reappraisal showed improved wellbeing and reported fewer negative emotions
than those who reappraised less frequently. Consequently,
individuals who
use cognitive reappraisal often experience more positive emotions and fewer
negative emotions than those who use this strategy less often.

The beneﬁts of using cognitive reappraisal in preventing suicide have also
been found in more recent studies. Using self-report measures of the ERQ,
Richmond, Hasking, and Meaney (2017) found that while depression, anxiety,
and stress each exerted a direct eﬀect on non-suicidal self-injury among 1586
university students, the increased use of cognitive reappraisal had a greater
impact on reducing suicide risk than the use of expressive suppression.
Similarly, Forkmann et al. (2014) found that increased use of expressive sup-
pression and reduced use of cognitive reappraisal signiﬁcantly predicted
increased SI. These results highlighted possible interventions for students experi-
encing psychological distress such as having workshops or training on the use of
adaptive emotion regulation strategies.

The importance of adaptive coping

In addition to emotion regulation, research has shown that the use of coping
strategies also has an impact on suicidal behavior, and both cognitive and

1196

Psychological Reports 122(4)

behavioral aspects of managing emotions are important in an individual’s resili-
ence against suicide (Go¨ rgen, Joormann, Hiller, & Wittho¨ ft, 2015; Zhang, Wang,
Xia, Liu, & Jung, 2012). Coping is often categorized into adaptive and maladap-
tive strategies. For example, Zuckerman and Gagne (2003) propose that adaptive
coping consists of approach, self-help, and accommodation coping and maladap-
tive coping consists of avoidance and self-punishment. Past ﬁndings generally
support the notion that adaptive coping strategies are more eﬀective in diﬃcult
situations and when managing negative emotions than maladaptive strategies. For
instance, higher scores on measures of self-punishment and avoidance coping
(maladaptive) are positively associated with SI in veterans (Pietrzak, Russo,
Ling, & Southwick, 2011) and police oﬃcers (Pienaar, Rothmann, & van de
Vijer, 2007). In contrast, lower scores on measures of approach coping (adaptive)
are negatively associated with SI (Pienaar et al., 2007).

Richard-Devantoy, Yang, Gustavo, & Fabrice, 2017) argue for the importance
of exploring coping and emotion regulation in suicidal behavior, because they
found that individuals are at greater risk of attempting suicide when they lack
adaptive coping skills and are less able to regulate their emotions and emotional
responses. However, because the constructs of coping and emotion regulation are
similar in many ways, the independent study of each can be diﬃcult.

Cross-cultural differences in coping and emotion regulation

Despite the fact that coping and emotion regulation are both important in sui-
cide, it is noteworthy that there are signiﬁcant cultural variations in coping and
emotion regulation and these should be accounted for. To date, much of the past
research has been conducted in the West with little understanding of how the
ﬁndings extrapolate to an East Asian sample (Wong, Wong, & Scott, 2006). It is
suggested that the emotion regulation strategies most often used by individuals
in the West may not be used by those living in East Asian cultures, for example,
the extensive use of cognitive reappraisal but reduced use of suppression in the
studies conducted by Gross and John (2003) and Richard-Devantoy et al.
(2017). An example of an East Asian culture is Hong Kong and Yuan, Liu,
Ding, and Yang (2014) proposed that Hong Kong is immersed in Chinese cul-
ture that is characterized by collectivistic cultural norms with relational har-
mony and self-discipline. To some extent, individuals are culturally trained to
suppress the expression of negative emotions. Therefore, it may be argued that
suppression may be an adaptive and eﬀective emotion regulation strategy in East
Asian cultures. This suggestion is consistent with studies that have found expres-
sive suppression to be culture-speciﬁc. For instance, research shows that the use
of suppression may relate to fewer negative emotional experiences, improved
social interactions, and more positive physiological responses in individuals with
East Asian cultural values (Butler, Lee, & Gross, 2007; Mauss & Butler, 2010;
Soto, Perez, Kim, Lee, & Minnick, 2011).

The fact that the use of coping and emotion regulation may diﬀer cross-
culturally and the focus of past research on Western cultures means it is import-
ant to explore the impact of these factors in East Asian cultures. In contrast to
suicide being the 10th leading cause of death for all age groups (see the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015), it is the second leading cause of
death for young people aged 15 to 24 years. The high numbers of suicide in
this age group is an even bigger concern in the Chinese culture as suicide is the
leading cause of death among adults aged 15 to 34 in China and accounts for
19% of deaths in this age group (Phillips, Li, & Zhang, 2002). This again high-
lights the importance of studying risk factors associated with suicide in this
population.

In addition to the high rates of suicide in young people, ﬁndings also show
that those attending college or university report more SI than their non-college
peers (Mortier, et al., 2018). In the academic year 2015–2016, a total of 22 young
people in Hong Kong committed suicide within a six-month period, and 10 of
these were university students (South China Morning Post, 2016). This contrib-
uted to a suicide rate of 8.3 per 100,000 in 2016 which is a relatively high ﬁgure
compared to previous ﬁgures of 6.2 per 100,000 in 2014. This indicates a con-
cerning increase in suicide in this population (see the University of Hong Kong’s
Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention 2010 to 2014). Pereira and Cardoso
(2015) explained that this may be due to the critical transition students go
through during their academic life, which in turn exposes them to more stress
and challenges (compared to their non-student peers). Therefore, it is crucial
that university students have adaptive ways to cope with the challenges they are
exposed to as poor coping and emotional regulation strategies may be detrimen-
tal to their development and progress.

Aims and intentions of the current study

The present study explored the relationship between emotion regulation, coping,
and suicidal behavior in a non-clinical student population from Hong Kong.
The intention of the work was to investigate the eﬀects of coping and emotion
regulation on a group who are at risk of suicidal behavior, but showing relatively
minimal signs of this behavior. This will help to determine whether coping and
emotion regulation could be used to identify and prevent suicidal behavior
before it reaches a critical point and leads to a suicide attempt. By studying
coping and emotion regulation in a population from Hong Kong, the work will
determine whether cultural diﬀerences have an impact on the use of coping
strategies and whether this has a diﬀerent impact on resilience to suicide in
comparison to past studies that focus on Western populations.

Participants were asked to complete three self-report measures of suicidal
behavior, coping, and emotion regulation. It was predicted that increased use
of emotional suppression and maladaptive coping strategies would be associated

1198

with increased suicidal behavior, whereas the use of cognitive reappraisal and
adaptive coping would be associated with reduced suicidal behavior.

Method
Design

This investigation was a correlational study to explore the relationship between
suicidal behavior and strategies of coping and emotion regulation. The variable of
suicidal behavior gave a measure of the extent to which participants were experien-
cing SI and took account of past suicide attempts and thoughts. Coping was
measured on ﬁve dimensions of self-help, approach, accommodation, self-punish-
ment, and avoidance. The variable of emotion regulation was separated into cog-
nitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the School of Health Sciences at the University of Salford.

Participants

One hundred and twenty undergraduate students from The Open University in
Hong Kong (51 males, 69 females) were recruited for this study using conveni-
ence sampling. Their ages ranged from 18 to 28 years, with a mean of 23.14 years
(SD ¼ 5.51). Prospective participants were prescreened for any history of neuro-
logical and cognitive deﬁcits (based on the ﬁndings of Richard-Devantoy et al.,
2017). Three participants were excluded leaving a sample size of 117
participants.

Materials

Three questionnaires were used for this study in order to measure each of the
variables. All were presented in English. Suicidal behavior was measured using
the Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire–Revised (SBQ-R; Osman et al., 2001).
This is a 4-item inventory that measures past, current, and future suicidal
thoughts and attempts. Item 1 measures lifetime SI and/or suicide attempts,
item 2 assesses the frequency of SI in the previous 12 months, item 3 quantiﬁes
the threat of a suicide attempt, and item 4 is the self-reported likelihood of future
suicidal behavior. Each question is answered using a Likert scale and the scale
for each question diﬀer slightly. The scales range from a minimum of 0 to a
maximum of 6, with lower numbers indicating a relatively low risk of suicide.
Total scores on the questionnaire range from 3 to 18 and represent overall
suicide risk whereby higher scores represent greater risk. Scores of 7 or above
indicate signiﬁcant risk of suicidal behavior. Cronbach’s alpha for the SBQ-R in
an undergraduate student population ranges from 0.76 (Osman et al., 2001) to
0.80 (Aloba, Ojeleye, & Aloba, 2017).

Ong and Thompson

Emotion regulation was measured using the ERQ (Gross & John, 2003). This
is a 10-item questionnaire measuring individual diﬀerences in respondents’
habitual use of two strategies for regulating their emotions, cognitive reappraisal
(six items), and expressive suppression (four items). Each question is rated on a
seven-point Likert scale (from 1 ¼ ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 7 ¼ ‘‘strongly agree’’)
and a higher score indicates greater use of a particular strategy. The range of
scores for reappraisal is 6 to 42, and for suppression is 4 to 28. Internal reliability
for the ERQ in a student population is acceptable with Cronbach’s alpha
reported as 0.82 for cognitive reappraisal and 0.76 for expressive suppression
(Gross & John, 2003).

Coping strategies were measured using the revised COPE (R-COPE;
Zuckerman & Gagne, 2003). This is a 40-item inventory that assesses ﬁve
forms of coping in response to stress: self-help, approach, accommodation,
avoidance, and self-punishment. Self-help coping signiﬁes seeking support and
dealing with an incident by understanding and expressing one’s own emotions.
Approach coping focuses on problem solving and accommodation coping meas-
ures the ability to accept that a problem cannot be resolved and the willingness
to use positive reframing to develop an optimistic outlook of the incident.
These three strategies of coping are collectively called adaptive coping as they
relate to positive mental outcomes. The remaining two coping strategies, avoid-
ance and self-punishment are grouped as maladaptive coping strategies.
Avoidance coping aims to direct the individual away from a problem via disen-
gagement, denial, and blaming external forces for the situation. Self-punishment
measures maladaptive coping strategies such as self-focused rumination and
self-blame regardless of whether these contributed to the incident (Zuckerman
& Gagne, 2003).

The R-COPE has been modiﬁed from the classic coping inventory
(COPE; Carver et al., 1989). Each question is answered using a four-point
scale (from 1 ¼ ‘‘I usually don’t do this at all’’ to 4 ¼ ‘‘I usually do this a
lot’’). Each dimension of coping is measured using eight questions, giving
a minimum score of 8 and a maximum of 32, with higher scores indicating
reported high
greater use of a particular
internal validity with a Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.81 to 0.92
(Zuckerman & Gagne, 2003).

Procedure

All participants were given an information sheet and consent form together with
the questionnaires. All materials were distributed to students during a lecture
and they were asked to read the instructions and then individually complete each
questionnaire at their own pace. The completion of the questionnaires took
approximately 30 min, and following completion participants were debriefed
by the researcher.

Results

Psychological Reports 122(4)

Results included scores on the SBQ-R, the scores for the two emotion regulation
strategies, and scores for the ﬁve dimensions of coping. The descriptive statistics
for each measure can be found in Table 1. There were 70 participants (59.83%)
who scored below 7 on the SBQ-R (median ¼ 4.00, range ¼ 3–6), and a total of
47 participants (40.17%) who scored higher than 7 (indicating a relatively high
suicide risk (median ¼ 9.00, range ¼ 7–15). Five participants (4.24%) reported at
least one past suicide attempt. A series of Spearman’s correlations were con-
ducted to analyze the relationship between suicidal behavior and the diﬀerent
strategies of coping and emotion regulation (see Table 2). Out of the ﬁve coping
strategies, suicidal behavior was positively correlated with avoidance coping,

r(117) ¼ .25, p < .01, indicating that higher levels of suicidal behavior were related
to increased use of avoidance coping. Suicidal behavior was negatively corre-
lated with accommodation coping, r(117) ¼ (cid:2).20, p < .05, and self-help coping,
r(117) ¼ (cid:2).23, p < .05. This shows that participants who reported less use of
accommodation and self-help coping showed higher levels of suicidal behavior.
There was no signiﬁcant correlation between suicidal behavior and self-punish-
ment, r(117) ¼ .17, p > .05, or approach coping, r(117) ¼ (cid:2).09, p > .05.

There was a negative correlation between scores on the SBQ-R and cognitive
appraisal, r(117) ¼ (cid:2).34, p < .01, with increased use of cognitive reappraisal relat-
ing to reduced suicidal behavior. However, there was no relationship between
suicidal behavior and expressive suppression, r(117) ¼ .01, p > .05.

To assess the impact of cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, accommodation,
and self-help coping on suicidal behavior, a multiple regression analysis was
performed with scores on the SBQ-R as the dependent variable and the diﬀerent
coping and emotion regulation strategies as predictor variables (Table 3).
Using the enter method, a signiﬁcant model emerged, F(4,114) ¼ 10.77, p < .001,
adjusted R2 ¼ 0.255. The variables that were shown to signiﬁcantly predict sui-
cidal behavior were avoidance coping (Beta ¼ 0.275, p < .001) and cognitive
reappraisal (Beta ¼ (cid:2)0.343, p < .001). While they were associated with scores
on the SBQ-R, accommodation coping (Beta ¼ (cid:2) 0.102, p ¼ .28) and self-help
coping (Beta ¼ (cid:2)0.148, p ¼ .11) did not predict suicidal behavior.

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the use of speciﬁc coping
and emotion regulation strategies could statistically predict suicidal behavior in a
non-clinical sample of Asian students. This population has a high incidence of
suicide, and currently, the ﬁndings in this ﬁeld focus primarily on Western samples.
Findings show cross-cultural diﬀerences in coping and emotion regulation strate-
gies, and this study was unique in exploring risk factors associated with suicide in an
East Asian sample. Identifying the risk factors and predictors in a non-clinical

sample may also help to identify those at risk at a relatively early stage in the suicide
process, therefore reducing suicidal behavior before it becomes more extreme.

Based on the existing literature regarding the link between emotion regulation
strategies and suicidal behavior (Rajappa et al., 2011; Richard-Devantoy et al.,
2017; Richmond et al., 2017; Sheppes et al., 2014), it was predicted that higher
levels of expressive suppression and lower levels of cognitive reappraisal would
be associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior. As hypothesized, the
results showed that increased use of cognitive reappraisal was related to reduced
suicidal behavior; however, there was no relationship between suicide and
expressive suppression. This partially supports the majority of past ﬁndings
which indicate that limited use of cognitive reappraisal is related to increased
symptoms of mental health disorders and suicide risk (Campbell-Sills, Barlow,
Brown, & Hofmann, 2006a; Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Gross & John, 2003;
Joormann, Siemar, & Gotlib, 2007; Moore, Zoellner, & Mollenholt, 2008).
The results support the argument that the ability to regulate emotion by reinter-
preting an emotion-eliciting situation is a beneﬁcial way of coping with stressful
situations. One possible explanation for this is that individuals who use appraisal
are less likely to assess a diﬃcult situation as defeating or feel entrapped due to
the situation. They may be more likely to seek alternative ways to cope by means
of interpersonal problem solving and strengthening social support (Johnson,
Gooding, & Tarrier, 2008; Johnson, Gooding, Wood, & Tarrier, 2010).

In relation to the process model of emotion regulation (Gross & John, 1998),
the current ﬁndings support the proposal that an antecedent-focused strategy in
the form of cognitive reappraisal might be more important in moderating sui-
cidal behavior than a response-focused strategy such as expressive suppression
that occurs later in the emotion generation process. Previous research has shown
that more frequent use of expressive suppression is related to increased SI and
suicide desire (Campbell-Sills et al., 2006a, Campbell-Sills, Barlow, Brown, &
Hofmann, 2006b; Forkmann et al., 2014; Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006; Gross &
John, 2003; Moore et al., 2008); however, the current results show no association
between the use of expressive suppression and suicidal behavior. This may be
due to the population of the current work. The majority of past studies were
conducted using European and American participants (Butler et al., 2007;
Forkmann et al., 2014; Soto et al., 2011) and the impact of expressive suppres-
sion has been shown to vary across diﬀerent cultures. For instance, Butler et al.
(2007) observed that while emotional suppression was associated with increased
negative emotions and hostile behaviors in European Americans, suppression
reduced or reversed negativity and hostility in Asian Americans who held Asian
values. Consistent with this, Soto et al. (2011) conducted a cross sectional study
with 71 European American students and 100 Chinese students from Hong
Kong. All participants provided self-report measures of expressive suppression,
life satisfaction, and depressed mood and results showed that expressive sup-
pression was associated with adverse psychological functioning for European

Ong and Thompson

American participants but not for Chinese participants. Indeed, suppression
might be as eﬀective as, or even more eﬀective than, acceptance in regulating
negative emotion in Chinese individuals. It should however be noted that this
argument is based on ﬁndings from individuals reporting relatively mild levels of
suicidal behavior. The beneﬁts of suppression in this sample may not extend to
individuals reporting more severe symptoms.

The current ﬁndings highlight the importance of the target population when
investigating suicidal behavior and identifying suicide risk and they show that
cultural background is a critical factor in understanding the relationship
between emotion regulation and psychological functioning. To account for
how emotional expression is moderated by diﬀerences in cultural norms, previ-
ous studies have shown that western cultures are characterized by individualistic
cultural values encouraging free emotional expression (Butler, Lee, & Gross,
2009; Soto, Levenson, & Ebling, 2005; Yuan et al., 2014). For example, com-
pared to Westerners, East Asians generally consider themselves as belonging to a
collectivism-oriented, interdependent or low individualism culture (Hofstede,
1994; Kuo, 2011; Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001). Hofstede (2008)
measured the level of individualism across 65 countries including the UK and
Hong Kong and reported that the UK was rated higher in terms of individual-
ism compared to Hong Kong.

The results from the current study showed that increased suicidal behavior (SI,
past suicide attempts, possible future engagement in suicide) was related to
increased avoidance coping and reduced levels of accommodation and self-help
coping (however, accommodation and self-help coping did not predict suicidal
behavior). Avoidance coping is considered to be a maladaptive coping
strategy (John & Gross, 2004; Zuckerman & Gagne, 2003) and the current ﬁnd-
ings support this. If individuals choose to use avoidance coping to avoid unwanted
thoughts and negative emotions (rather than trying to alter them), these emotions
may still be readily available despite the eﬀort to keep them out of awareness. The
negative thoughts and feelings that are avoided may therefore persist to a greater
extent because they have not been resolved (Najmi, Wegner, & Nock, 2007).

Bijttebier and Vertommen (1999) have argued for the importance of investi-
gating individual diﬀerences that may contribute to the use of maladaptive
coping, such as those relating to personality traits and/or psychopathology.
They studied the coping strategies of psychiatric inpatients with personality
disorders, grouping coping into three factors of problem solving, seeking
social support, and avoidance (using the Coping Strategy Indicator of
Amirkhan, 1990). The ﬁndings showed a relationship between personality
disorders and avoidance coping, particularly for individuals with avoidant or
borderline personality disorder. It may be argued that the increased use of
avoidance coping may make individuals with avoidant-type personality dis-
orders more at risk of engaging in suicidal behaviors. Related to this,
Klonsky, Oltmanns, and Turkheimer (2003) explored self-harm in a large

1204

Psychological Reports 122(4)

group of military recruits and found those who engaged in deliberate self-harm
reported more traits associated with personality disorders (although not specif-
ically avoidant personality disorder). If certain personality traits are associated
with maladaptive coping strategies such as avoidance coping, and if these
increase the risk of suicidal behaviors, it would be prudent to take account of
them when trying to identify those at risk.

In the current study, increased use of accommodation and self-help coping
was signiﬁcantly associated with a reduced risk of suicidal behavior. This sug-
gests that individuals who seek support and express emotion (self-help coping)
or accept a problem and positively reframe a situation (accommodation
coping) are more likely to be protected against suicidal behavior. While
three of the coping strategies (accommodation, self-help, and avoidance
coping) proposed by Zuckerman and Gagne (2003) were associated with a
risk of suicidal behavior, self-punishment and approach coping showed no
relationship with scores on the SBQ-R. This conﬂicts with previous research
showing that suicidal behavior is best predicted by reduced use of approach
coping (Pienaar et al., 2007) and increased use of self-punishment coping
(Pietrzak et al., 2011). Again, one reason for the disparity in the ﬁndings is
that the samples used across the diﬀerent studies vary quite substantially and
the individuals within each study may be exposed to diﬀerent stressors. For
example, Pienaar et al.’s (2007) study recruited uniformed police oﬃcers from
South Africa and Pietrzak et al. (2011) studied veterans in the US. Coping
strategies and behavior of individuals from those groups may not be applicable
to students who tend to be younger and have less experience in mastering their
approach coping (this requires problem solving based on knowledge and past
experiences). The use of diﬀerent coping strategies with regard to suicidal
behavior has not been extensively investigated among university students
and the present study has therefore shown that it is important to take account
of the population and the stressors they may experience before trying to
encourage speciﬁc coping strategies. This does however highlight a limitation
of the current work as it did not consider speciﬁc negative life events that may
have inﬂuenced coping and emotion regulation strategies. The study also did
not account for problem-solving ability, or aﬀective disorders that are known
to impact suicidal behavior (Chen, 2016; Wagner & Zimmerman, 2006). A
further limitation to the current work was the use of a convenience sample,
and consequently, the ﬁndings are only representative of this group and may
not reﬂect the wider student population.

Comparisons to studies that use a similar population highlight the draw-
backs of the current research with regard to both the size and the representa-
tiveness of the sample. The students in this study showed a very high level of
suicidal behavior, with over 40% classiﬁed as having a signiﬁcant risk of sui-
cidal behavior (based on the criteria of the SBQ-R) and 4.24% reporting a past
suicide attempt. A meta-analysis by Mortier, Cuijpers, et al. (2018b) assessed

Ong and Thompson

1205

lifetime prevalence of ‘‘suicidal thoughts and behaviors’’ across a number of
studies conducted using college students (with a total of 634,662 participants)
and found a prevalence of 22.32% for SI and 3.22% for suicide attempts.
It should be noted that suicidal behavior was separated into thoughts (SI)
and behaviors, whereas in the current study, participants were given a single
score for suicidal behavior that incorporated SI. Indeed, research in this ﬁeld
often uses diﬀerent measures of recording suicidal behavior; therefore, it is
diﬃcult to make comparisons, yet the disparity between this study and previ-
ous work is a concern. The prevalence of suicide in the current sample is much
higher, and it is unlikely this can be attributed to cultural diﬀerences as a meta-
analysis focusing on Chinese college students found that the prevalence of SI in
studies conducted between 2004 and 2013 (including 160,339 participants) was
10.72% (Li et al., 2014). There are many factors that can aﬀect suicidal behav-
ior such as depression, family circumstances, gender, ﬁnancial situation, and
physical health, and the present study did not account for these. This was not
the aim of the research but the limitations of the sample should be acknowl-
edged when considering the results.

Overall, the ﬁndings show that lower levels of avoidance coping, in combin-
ation with higher levels of cognitive reappraisal may explain the resilience of
some individuals against suicidal behavior. This was found in a group of under-
graduate students reporting relatively mild symptoms of suicidal behavior and
therefore the results may be used to improve identiﬁcation and prevention of
suicide at an early stage. A further important point raised by the research is that
the use of coping and emotional regulation may be inﬂuenced by cultural con-
text and the psychological processes that may be considered risk factors in some
populations may be beneﬁcial
in others. The research therefore raises the
importance of accounting for the background and situation of the individual
when trying to identify risk factors to suicide.
