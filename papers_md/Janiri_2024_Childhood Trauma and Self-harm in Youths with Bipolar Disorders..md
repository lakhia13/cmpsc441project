Abstract: Background: Bipolar disorders (BD) in youth are associated with a high risk of self-harm 
behaviors. Childhood trauma (CT) is a relevant environmental stressor that is related to both BD diag-
nosis  and  self-harm  in  adulthood.  It  is  not  yet  established  whether  CT  may  impact  self-harm  risk  in 
youth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the distribution patterns of CT in youth BD 
with and without self-harm.  

Methods: We assessed 273 participants (aged 13-25 years), 96 youths with BD according to DSM-5 
criteria and 177 healthy controls (HC). History of CT was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Ques-
tionnaire  (CTQ).  The  association  between  CT  and  self-harm  was  tested  using  multivariate  statistical 
models. 

Results: Over 45% of participants with BD reported lifetime self-harm. The BD Self-harm group re-
ported more emotional abuse, emotional neglect, sexual abuse, and physical abuse than HC. The BD 
No-Self-harm  group  reported  more  emotional  abuse  than  HC.  The  BD  Self-harm  group  reported  more 
emotional  abuse  and  neglect  than  the  BD  No-Self-harm  group.  The  BD  Self-harm  group  also  reported 
separated parents, hospitalizations, smoking, use of antiepileptics, antipsychotics and lithium. Emotional 
abuse was an independent predictor of self-harm in youths with BD.  

Conclusion: Findings support the importance of assessing CT, in particular emotional abuse, in youth 
with BD at risk for self-harm. 

Keywords: Bipolar disorders, youth, childhood trauma, self-harm, pediatric, childhood trauma questionnaire. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Self-harm  rates  in  youths  have  been  steadily  increasing 
over  the  last  decade  [1,  2].  Self-harm  is  defined  as  self-
poisoning  or  self-injury  irrespective  of  the  suicidal  intent, 
with  self-injury  being  the  most  prevalent  [3].  Self-injurious 
behaviors include self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and 
skin damage by other methods. The usual onset of self-harm 
is  in  adolescents  aged  around  14  years,  with  an  estimated 
prevalence that is higher in girls than in males and that range 
between  10%  and  25%  in  community  samples  [4].  Youth 
psychopathology is the most robust risk factor for self-harm.

Previous studies found that anxiety and mood symptoms, in 
particular,  have  the  highest  odds  ratios  for  both  occasional 
and repetitive self-injury. Environmental risk factors, includ-
ing family-related variables, have been also found as predic-
tors of self-injurious behaviors.   

  Bipolar disorders (BD) typically present with an age at the 
onset that averages 15-25 years and with a strong association 
with  an  increased  risk  of  suicide  and  non-suicidal  self-harm 
[5]. Even though many studies have previously highlighted the 
increased  suicide  risk  in  adolescents  and  young  adults  with 
BD [6-8], less attention has been given so far to the relation-
ship between self-harm and BD in youth. Recent studies indi-
cated a lifetime self-harm prevalence in adolescents with BD 
ranging between 31-37% [9, 10], with a peak that occurs in 
the first 3 months following initial diagnosis [11].

Childhood Trauma and Self-harm in Youths with Bipolar Disorders 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 1    153 

  Among  early  stressors,  childhood  trauma  (CT)  has 
emerged as one of the most important risk factors for psychi-
atric  disorders  [12],  including  mood  disorders  [13].  Distinct 
types  of  traumatic  experiences  (i.e.,  sexual,  physical,  emo-
tional  abuse  and  neglect)  may  impact  psychiatric  illnesses 
differently, modulating their clinical expression in adult age 
[14]. Early adverse events have been associated with biolog-
ical  alterations  underlying  mood  disorders  [15],  as  well  as 
with negative clinical outcomes, including increased suicide 
risk  [8,  16].  Despite  the  emphasis  given  to  childhood  trau-
matic  experiences  in  the  course  of  BD  during  adulthood, 
relatively little is known about youth age [17], with very few 
studies that are specifically focused on the clinical correlates 
of  CT  on  juvenile  BD  [18-20].  Romero  et  al.  reported  that 
20%  percent  of  their  sample  experienced  physical  and/or 
sexual  abuse  [20].  Youths  with  CT  presented  with  a  more 
severe  clinical  course  as  compared  with  the  non-abused 
group [20]. Marchand et al. [18] also highlighted that expo-
sure  to  adverse  events  is  common  among  pediatric  patients 
with BD and may have a negative impact on prognosis. They 
specified that 53% of youths with BD experienced childhood 
maltreatment. A similar prevalence was observed by Cazala 
and colleagues [19], who found that the severity of CT types 
was  from  low  to  moderate  and  that  more  than  50%  of  indi-
viduals with pediatric BD reported having experienced emo-
tional abuse.  

Interestingly,  two  studies  found  a  significant  impact  of 
early  adverse  events  on  suicide  risk  [19,  21].  Specifically, 
Cazala et al. [19] showed that females with BD and histories 
of  physical  abuse  were  more  likely  to  report  suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors than the rest of the sample. Goldstein 
et  al.  [21]  reporting  data  on  over  400  children  and  adoles-
cents aged 7-17 year, found that youths with a lifetime histo-
ry of suicide attempt were more likely to present with physi-
cal and/or sexual abuse than non-attempters.  

  However,  no  study  to  date  has  focused  on  the  relation-
ship between self-harm and CT in youths with BD. Accord-
ingly, the prime aim of our study was to fill this gap by in-
vestigating  the  link  between  self-harm  and  CT  in  a  large 
sample  of  adolescents  and  youths  with  BD  compared  to  a 
group  of  healthy  controls  (HC).  We  were  specifically  inter-
ested in identifying distribution patterns of different CT sub-
types  in  patients  with  and  without  self-harm.  We  hypothe-
sized that self-harm in youth is associated with early adverse 
events. Additionally, we also investigated whether childhood 
traumatic  experiences  and  familial  characteristics  may  dif-
ferently impact self-harm behaviors in youths with BD. 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. Participants  

For  the  primary  aim  of  the  study,  we  focused  on  the 
prevalence  of  self-harm  in  patients  with  bipolar  disorders 
(BD) and on its relation with childhood trauma (CT). Given 
that BD typically presents with an age at onset that averages 
15-25  years,  we  considered  patients  aged  13-25,  in  order  to 
include teenage age and to encompass BD onset. Additional-
ly, to avoid biases in identifying distribution patterns of dif-
ferent  CT  subtypes  in  patients  with  and  without  self-harm, 
we  applied  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  described  below. 
We  consecutively  assessed  96  young  outpatients  with  a 

DSM-5  diagnosis  of  BD  type  I,  II  or  unspecified.  Patients 
were  enrolled  at  the  Early  Intervention  for  Mood  Disorders 
Unit  at  Fondazione  Policlinico  Universitario  Agostino  Ge-
melli  IRCCS  in  Rome,  Italy.  Patients  were  screened  by 
trained  staff  for  DSM-5  disorders,  and  clinical  diagnoses 
were  confirmed  using  the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for 
DSM-5-Research Version [15]. In addition to a diagnosis of 
BD,  inclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  (i)  age  between  13 
and 25 years, in order to include teenage age and to encom-
pass  BD  onset  [22],  (ii)  stable  phase  of  illness  according  to 
psychometric evaluation (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 
HAM-D ≤ 7; Young Mania Rating Scale ≤ 12), (iii) fluency 
in  Italian,  and  (iv)  at  least  five  years  of  school  education. 
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) traumatic head injury 
with  loss  of  consciousness;  (ii)  lifetime  history  of  major 
medical or neurological disorders; (iii) cognitive impairment; 
(iv)  recent  (past  six  weeks)  changes  in  any  psychotropic 
medication;  (v)  current  use  of  stimulant  medications;  and 
(vi)  a  history  of  psychosis  unrelated  to  the  primary  mood 
disorder.  We  also  recruited  117  healthy  controls  (HC), 
matched  for  age,  sex,  and  educational  level,  from  the  same 
geographical area. All HC were screened for current or life-
time history of DSM-5 disorders. For the aims of this study, 
they were also interviewed to determine their potential self-
harm  behaviors;  none  of  them  reported  lifetime  self-harm 
behaviors.  Participants  were  also  interviewed  to  assess 
whether any first-degree relative  was affected by mood dis-
orders or schizophrenia. If they had a positive family history, 
they  were  excluded.  Other  exclusion  criteria  were  the  same 
as  those  for  the  patient  group.  The  study  was  approved  and 
undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  the  Fonda-
zione  Policlinico  Universitario  Agostino  Gemelli  Ethics 
Committee and in accordance with the Principles of Human 
Rights, as adopted by the World Medical Association at the 
18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 
and  subsequently  amended  at  the  64th  WMA  General  As-
sembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013. All participants and 
their  parents,  if  patients  <  18  years  old,  gave  their  written 
informed  consent  to  participate  in  the  study  after  they  had 
received a complete explanation of the study procedures. 

2.2. Clinical Assessment 
(cid:2) We used the short form of the Childhood Trauma Ques-
tionnaire (CTQ) to measure early adverse childhood events. 
This  is  a  28-item,  retrospective,  self-report  questionnaire 
[23]  that  investigates  traumatic  experiences  in  childhood. 
The  questionnaire  assesses  five  types  of  CT:  emotional 
abuse,  emotional  neglect,  physical  abuse,  physical  neglect 
and sexual abuse. For each type of trauma, scores range from 
5  to  25.  Higher  scores  indicate  greater  childhood  maltreat-
ment. The CTQ has been used in youths in both non-clinical 
[24] and clinical populations [19] with a high degree of reli-
ability.  

  Clinical  characteristics  were  collected  during  a  clinical 
interview.  Lifetime  self-harm  was  assessed  with  a  semi-
structured  questionnaire  consisting  of  two  parts,  one  related 
to the past 6 months and the other lifetime. Each part includ-
ed  two  questions:  [1]  “Have  you  ever  intentionally  (i.e.,  on 
purpose) performed each type of self-harm (i.e., self-cutting, 
biting,  banging,  hitting,  burning,  self-poisoning)  [2]  Have 
you  ever  performed  each  type  of  self-harm  without  suicidal

intent  (i.e.,  not  for  suicidal  reasons)?  Respondents  had  to 
answer only “Yes” or “No”. If they answered “yes” to both 
the questions listed above, they were considered in the self-
harm group. The wording of the questions can be changed to 
improve/  check  understanding  and  the  final  evaluation  was 
also based on information from parents (always present dur-
ing  visits)  and  from  any  medical  documentation.  All  demo-
graphic,  familial  and  clinical  data  collected  were  entered  in 
preprinted medical records. 

2.3. Statistical Analyses 

  We compared the three groups' (i.e., BD youths with and 
without  self-harm,  and  HC)  socio-demographic  and  clinical 
characteristics on the basis of the chi-square test for nominal 
variables  and  one-way  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  fol-
lowed by post-hoc Scheffé tests for continuous variables and 
by pairwise post-hoc analyses for nominal variables. Signifi-
cance was set at a p < 0.05 level. 

For the first aim of this study, we focused on the distribu-
tion patterns of CT subtypes. First, we conducted a series of 
multivariate  analyses  of  variance  (MANOVA)  using  all  the 
CT  subtypes  as  dependent  variables  and  the  diagnostic 
groups (i.e., BD(cid:2)No Self-harm, BD(cid:2)Self-harm and HC) as an 
independent  factor.  When  the  initial  model  was  significant, 
we  conducted  a  series  of  one-way  ANOVAs,  followed  by 
Scheffé post-hoc tests, to compare means among groups. For 
the  ANOVA  comparative  measurements,  we  used  a  statisti-
cal  model  corrected  for  multiple  comparisons  according  to 
the  Bonferroni  procedure  (p  <  .05/number  of  comparisons) 
to minimize the likelihood of type I statistical errors. For the 
secondary  aim  of  the  study,  we  focused  on  which  variables 
significantly  contributed  to  differentiate  youth  with  and 
without  self-harm  among  childhood  traumatic  experiences 
and  familial  characteristics.  Accordingly,  we  performed  a 
multivariate logistic regression model considering self-harm 
as  the  dependent  variable  and  CT  subtypes,  number  of  co-
habitants and having divorced parents as independent varia-
bles together with age, sex and significant clinical variables 
associated with self-harm in the univariate analyses. Signifi-
cance was set at a p < 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS v. 25 (IBM Corp., USA). 

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics  
(cid:2) The  final  sample  included  273  individuals,  211  females 
(77.3%)  and  62  males  (22.7%),  with  a  mean  age  of  18.51 
(SD  =    3.41)  years.  In  the  overall  group  of  patients  with  a 
diagnosis  of  BD  (n  =  96),  44  (45.8%)  youths  reported  non-
suicidal  lifetime  self-harm  (BD-SH)  and  52  did  not  report 
self-harm (BD-NSH). The three diagnostic groups (i.e., BD-
NSH,  BD-SH  and  HC)  did  not  differ  significantly  for  age, 
gender  or  educational  level.  The  three  group  significantly 
differed  for  number  of  cohabitants,  having  divorced  parents 
and  smoking  status.  Specifically,  post-hoc  analyses  clarified 
that HC reported higher number of cohabitants then BD-NSH 
(p = 0.01); both BD-SH (Chi-square = 5.88, df = 1, p = 0.003) 
and BD-SH (Chi-square = 14.51, df = 1, p < 0.001) present-
ed with higher percentage of separated parents than HC; BD-
NSH  reported  less  smoking  use  than  BD-SH  (Chi-square  = 

9.97, df = 1, p = 0.002) and HC (Chi-square = 9.17, df = 1,  
p = 0.002) groups (Table 1). 

  With  respect  to  clinical  characteristics,  BD-SH  reported 
more hospitalization, and more use of antiepileptics, antipsy-
chotics and lithium than BD-NSH (Table 1). 

3.2. Distribution Patterns of Childhood Trauma Subtypes 
in Patients with and Without Self-harm  
(cid:2) A  preliminary  MANOVA  found  a  significant  global  ef-
fect (Wilk's Lambda = 0.72, F = 9.11, df = 10, p < 0.0001) of 
CTs  on  the  presence  of  lifetime  self-harm  (categorized  as 
YES/NO). Factorial ANOVAs indicated a main effect for all 
types of CT, except psychical neglect, which did not survive 
multiple  comparison  correction.  In  particular,  a  series  of 
pairwise  Scheffé  post-hoc  analyses  clarified  that  BD-SH 
reported  more  emotional  abuse,  emotional  neglect,  sexual 
abuse,  and  physical  abuse  than  HC,  as  well  as  more  emo-
tional abuse and neglect compared to BD-NSH. In addition, 
BD-NSH reported more emotional abuse than HC (Table 2).  

3.3.  Effect  of  Childhood  Traumatic  Experiences  and  
Familial Characteristics on Self-harm  

In  the  multivariate  logistic  regression  only  emotional 
abuse, among childhood, traumatic experiences and familial 
characteristics  significantly  predicted  self-harm  during  life-
time  (p  =  0.008).  Specifically,  increasing  emotional  abuse 
during childhood was associated with an increased likelihood 
to  present  with  self-harm  (OR  =  1.30,(cid:2) 95%  CI  =  1.07-1.58, 
Wald = 7.01).  

4. DISCUSSION  
(cid:2) To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the 
relationship between self-harm and childhood trauma (CT) in 
youths  with  bipolar  disorders  (BD).  Results  showed  that 
around  45%  of  youths  with  BD  reported  having  performed 
nonsuicidal  self-harm  during  lifetime.  Youths  with  BD  and 
self-harm reported more emotional abuse, emotional neglect, 
physical  abuse  and  sexual  abuse  than  HC,  while  only  emo-
tional  abuse  differentiated  patients  without  self-harm  from 
HC. When we directly compared BD with and without self-
harm, we observed significant differences only in emotional 
abuse  and  emotional  neglect.  Notably,  after  modelling  CT 
and  familial  characteristics,  emotional  abuse  showed  the 
most consistent association with self-harm in BD.  

  The distribution of childhood trauma in youths appears in 
line with previous findings in adults, where CT was associat-
ed  with  both  BD  diagnosis  and  life  time  self-harm/suicidal 
behaviors [25]. In adulthood, self-harm seems to be correlat-
ed with a high frequency of early adverse events, in particu-
lar sexual abuse, per se [26]. In parallel, the link between BD 
diagnosis  and  CT  has  been  solidly  established,  with  emo-
tional  abuse  being  the  most  frequent  type  of  early  adverse 
event in adult patients with BD [13]. In the youth population, 
BD and self-harm presented together with a prevalence rang-
ing between 31-37% [9, 10], slightly smaller than the one we 
found in the current study. In parallel, a significant associa-
tion  was  recently  found  between  CT  and  BD  diagnosis  in 
youth  [19].  Furthermore,  a  large  population-based  cohort 
study  recently  showed  that  adverse  childhood  experiences

were associated with increased self-harm risk in adolescents 
[27].  Here,  for  the  first  time,  we  specified  that  the  co-
occurrence of the two conditions (i.e., BD diagnosis and CT) 
might be particularly at risk for the development of self-harm 
behaviors in youth. Future longitudinal studies are needed to 
confirm these initial observations.  
(cid:2)
In  our  study,  we  found  higher  emotional  abuse  in  BD 
without  self-harm  compared  to  HC,  suggesting  emotional 
abuse  as  a  characteristic  trait  of  BD  in  youth.  The  evidence 
that  emotional  abuse  is  particularly  linked  to  BD  is  con-
sistent with previous findings in adults highlighting that this 
is the most frequent type of childhood traumatic experiences 
in  patients  with  BD  [13].  Meta-analytic  findings  confirmed 
these  results,  showing  that  emotional  abuse  was  four  times 
more  likely  to  occur  in  BD  than  in  HC,  a  larger  effect  than 
for  other  types  of  early  adversities  [13].  Furthermore,  a  re-
cent study found that childhood maltreatment, and emotional 

abuse,  in  particular,  may  increase  the  risk  to  develop  BD 
even when the genetic load is low [28]. Our study seems to 
suggest  that  these  observations  may  be  extended  to  adoles-
cents and youths with BD. Future studies with larger samples 
may confirm this initial hypothesis.  

It  is  noteworthy  that  in  our  study,  when  the  two  BD 
groups were compared (i.e., BD with and without self-harm), 
we found significant differences only in emotional abuse and 
emotional  neglect.  Furthermore,  after  modelling  CT  and  fa-
milial  characteristics,  emotional  abuse  showed  the  strongest 
association with self-harm. These results are consistent with 
previous studies in adults showing a specific association be-
tween  emotional  abuse  and  suicidal  behaviors  in  patients 
with  mood  disorders  [16].  They  are  also  in  line  with  recent 
neuroimaging studies separately investigating neural circuits 
implicated  in  BD,  childhood  abuse  and  self-harm.  A  very 
recent  study  found  altered  resting-state  functional  connec-

tivity between amygdala and the dorsolateral and orbitofron-
tal cortex in adolescent BD with self-harm [29]. Interesting-
ly, the same brain areas have also been implicated in the neu-
robiological effects of childhood abuse in adulthood [30]. In 
particular, in a previous study, we found that CT in BD has a 
specific  effect  on  volumetric  abnormalities  in  the  amygdala 
[15].  Intriguingly,  a  recent  systematic  review  found  that 
amygdala  hyperactivity  to  emotional  stimuli  was  the  most 
commonly reported finding in youth with BD compared to HC 
[31].  Furthermore,  hyperactivity  to  emotional  stimuli  has 
been separately reported in both patients with BD and emo-
tional  abuse  [32]  and  in  patients  with  self-harm  [33].  Even 
though no neuroimaging study is available to date on CT in 
youth BD, we could speculate that specific neural underpin-
nings may be shared between self-harm and CT, in particular 
emotional  abuse.  These  early  speculations  may  be  used  to 
plan future neuroimaging studies in youths with BD, as well 
as  to  tailor  prevention  and  intervention  strategies  for  self-
harm risk.   

  Considering  the  effect  of  familial  characteristics  on  self-
harm, we found a higher percentage of separated parents in the 
BD Self-harm than in BD No-Self-harm group. Results are in 
line  with  previous  community-representative  studies  showing 
parental separation or divorce as a risk factor for suicidal be-
haviors and self-harm in adolescents [34, 35]. Nevertheless, 
after modelling CT and familial characteristics in the logistic 
regression  analysis,  only  emotional  abuse  resulted  in  a  sig-
nificant  predictor  of  self-harm  in  youths  with  BD.  Interest-
ingly,  previous  authors  attempted  to  frame  emotional  child 
abuse in the context of parental separation or divorce [36]. It 
is  possible  that  when  parents  are  in  open  conflict  children 
may develop harmful reactions and behaviors in response to 
a  high  degree  of  psychological  burden  [36].  Accordingly, 
high levels of family conflict are linked to suicidal behaviors 
in pediatric age [8]. Further investigations are needed to clar-
ify  the  relationship  between  parental  separation/family  con-
flict, emotional abuse and self-harm in youths with BD.  

  Our  results  showed  that  self-harm  is  associated  with 
more hospitalization, more smoking, more use of antiepilep-
tics,  antipsychotics  and  lithium.  These  findings  are  in  line 
with previous studies highlighting increasing rates of hospi-
tal-treated self-harm among young people and with the need 
of  more  complex  pharmacological  treatments  patients  with 
BD presenting with a severe clinical course [37, 38]. 

In this regard, our study corroborates the literature asking 
for  targeted  interventions  in  key  transition  stages  for  young 
people at risk for self-harm. 

  Before presenting our conclusions, we must acknowledge 
some  points  that  might  limit  the  generalizability  of  our  re-
sults. First, the cross-sectional design of our study limits our 
ability  to  investigate  a  causal  relationship  between  the  as-
sessed  variables.  Second,  history  of  lifetime  self-harm  was 
assessed using a not validated, semi-structured questionnaire. 
Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  the  instrument  we  used  might 
not  be  sufficiently  sensitive  in  detecting  self-harm  risk.  In 
particular,  it  did  not  provide  a  quantitative  measure  of  the 
risk. Furthermore, it did not provide information on the type 
and the frequency of self-harm. This is a potential shortcom-
ing because different type of self-harm patterns may be dif-
ferently associated with distinct type of CT. Third, the relia-

bility of the retrospective assessment of childhood traumatic 
experiences, as assessed with the CTQ, may be influenced by 
uncontrolled  recall  bias.  Nevertheless,  the  CTQ  is  currently 
used in youths [19, 24] in both non-clinical [24] and clinical 
populations [19] and it is indicated as the best instrument for 
evaluating CT in BD [39]. Fourth, in our study females were 
overrepresented than males, accounting for over 70% of the 
total  sample.  Because  the  prevalence  of  self-harm  in  com-
munity  samples  is  higher  in  females  than  in  males,  this  im-
balance  may  have  influenced  the  high  percentage  of  youths 
presenting with self-harm. Nevertheless, the three diagnostic 
group  (i.e.,  BD-Self-ham,  BD-No-Self-harm  and  HC)  were 
balanced  for  gender  (p  >  0.05).  Fifth,  in  our  study  we  only 
compared  individuals  with  BD  to  HC.  Previous  studies 
demonstrated  a  strong  association  between  CT  and  other 
psychiatric  diagnoses  [40-43].  Accordingly,  patients  with 
BD  and  CT  might  be  compared  not  only  to  HC  but  also  to 
other diagnostic categories. Future studies may further focus 
on  this  specific  point.  Finally,  despite  the  relatively  large 
number  of  recruited  patients,  due  to  splitting  our  samples 
according  to  diagnostic  group,  the  final  samples  were  rela-
tively small.  

CONCLUSION  
(cid:2)
In conclusion, our study can be considered as a first step 
towards  a  better  understanding  of  the  relationship  between 
BD diagnosis, CT and self-harm in youth. The results of our 
study indicate the importance of assessing CT in youth with 
BD  at  risk  for  self-harm.  Indeed,  this  is  important  for  both 
research and clinical purposes. First, CT might unveil slight 
differences between youths with BD, that are normally diffi-
cult  to  identify.  Individuals  with  CT  might  represent  a  sub-
group of patients, who may present with more severe clinical 
outcomes  and  with  different  life-course  biological  trajecto-
ries.  Future  investigations  with  prospective  longitudinal  de-
signs could confirm this initial speculation. Second, the rela-
tionship  between  self-harm  and  CT  in  youths  has  obvious 
clinical relevance. All youths with BD who have undergone 
CT,  in  particular  emotional  abuse,  should  be  treated  with 
particular  attention  because  of  their  possible  self-injury  be-
haviors. The routine assessment of CT might allow an early 
identification  of  patients  at  risk  for  self-injurious  behaviors 
even  before  the  clinical  onset  of  symptoms.  This  would  al-
low to implement specific prevention strategies. Psychother-
apeutic and psychoeducational programs purposely designed 
to  the  elaboration  of  traumatic  events  may  be  useful  in  en-
hancing  resilience  process  for  self-harm  risk.  Furthermore, 
the  use  of  pharmacological  treatments  specifically  targeting 
hyperreactivity to emotional stimuli might be useful in treat-
ing self-injurious behaviors in patients with BD and a history 
of CT.  

  The  assessment  of  early  trauma  should  be  definitely  in-
cluded in the clinical evaluation of youths with BD to better 
tailor  prevention  and  intervention  strategies  for  self-harm 
risk. (cid:2)
