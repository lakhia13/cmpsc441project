Abstract

Background/Purpose:  The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has called for an 
increased priority to improve cancer care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations, due 
to heightened risk of receiving disparate treatment and having suboptimal experiences, including 
perceived discrimination. We demonstrate how integrating trauma-informed care (TIC) principles 
across the cancer continuum is a key strategy to improving care delivery and outcomes among 
SGM populations.

Method:  This empirically-informed perspective expands on the concepts generated through 
the ASCO position statement and utilizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Association (SAMHSA) “Four R’s” Toward Trauma Informed Care: Realize, Recognize, 
Response, and Resist Traumatization.

Results:  Recommendations for each component of TIC include: (1) Realize: Implement 
SGM cultural humility training, including modules on SGM-specific trauma, discrimination, 
harassment, and violence; (2) Recognize: Routinely screen for emotional distress using methods to 
ensure privacy, and/or normalize mental health screenings to cancer patients; (3) Respond: Create 
and widely disseminate policies and patients’ rights that prohibit discrimination and ensure access 
to gender-neutral clinical environments; and (4) Resist Traumatization: Establish and respond to

Introduction

A cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment is an often-traumatic experience for anyone, 
but for sexual and gender minority (SGM) patients it comes with unique challenges that can 
exacerbate historical and existing traumas. SGM patients bear a disproportionate cancer 
burden and face disparities in cancer-specific outcomes stemming from unique cancer 
risks, needs, challenges, as well as gaps in quality of care.1 This disproportionate burden 
is even higher for SGM people of color, older SGM adults, and SGM people living in 
poverty.2 The broader healthcare system has not always been inclusive and respectful of 
SGM patients’ diverse identities and experiences, leading to potential interpersonal and 
institutional stigma.3 These experiences can also exacerbate the personal trauma histories of 
SGM patients, creating barriers to quality cancer care.

Recent calls by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) highlight the urgent 
need to address cancer care disparities and improve outcomes for SGM cancer patients.1 In 
this perspective, we build on these existing ASCO recommendations and argue the added 
value of a complementary trauma-informed approach.4

While the past decade has witnessed the enhanced discussion of trauma-informed 
frameworks, trauma-informed principles have not been regularly applied to the cancer care 
field, particularly as it relates to improving care quality and experiences for systematically 
marginalized populations.4 Through this perspective, we advance the concept of trauma-
informed cancer care with a heightened sensitivity to SGM-related issues that recognizes the 
widespread nature of trauma in SGM populations, integrates knowledge about this trauma 
into practices and procedures, and minimizes further re-traumatization for these populations. 
We argue that the integration of trauma-informed principles in cancer care can reform the 
screening, care experiences, treatment engagement, and health-related outcomes for SGM 
patients. Practical applications corresponding to each trauma-informed “R” can be seen in 
Table 1 and are briefly summarized below.

What is Trauma-informed Care and Why is it Important to Incorporate 

Throughout the Cancer Care Continuum for SGM Patients?

Trauma can be an enduring reality for cancer patients, occurring at various stages 
along the cancer care continuum (i.e., effecting risk behaviors, screening, treatment, and 
survivorship care).4–6 For SGM patients with cancer, previous traumas may exacerbate 
and compound psychosocial challenges, such as estrangement from families of origin and 
experiences of discrimination in healthcare settings.1,7,8 Evidence has shown that SGM 
patients face disproportionate incidences of trauma and violence outside of healthcare 
and familial spaces.2,9,10 This is especially true for SGM patients facing intersectional 
forms of oppression.11 Intersectionality theory can serve as a framework in this regard to 
better understand how these various intersecting social identities (race, gender, sexuality, 
disability, class, and others) systems of oppression shape ones experiences and cancer care 
outcomes.12,13 Thus, it is crucial to incorporate trauma-informed principles into cancer care 
for SGM patients to mitigate the negative impact of these experiences and improve overall 
cancer care experiences, treatment engagement, and outcomes for this patient population.

The concept of trauma-informed care is a healthcare approach that recognizes the universal 
impact of trauma and how it affects healthcare interactions, including how patients receive 
or respond to services. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Association (SAMHSA), being trauma-informed involves realizing the widespread impact of 
trauma, recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma, responding with TIC, and actively 
resisting retraumatization.14 Additionally, we propose the addition of a fifth “R” – reflection. 
This concept involves reflection of one’s biases, trauma histories, and organizational climate 
to understand how that might promote recovery or create barriers to equitable care for SGM 
patients. Incorporating these five R’s, we propose applying the SAMHSA trauma-informed 
care principles to cancer care for SGM patients and highlight examples of how trauma-
informed care can be implemented to provide better care for this patient population.

1.  Realize the widespread impact of trauma on SGM people.

To create a trauma-informed space throughout the cancer care continuum, it is imperative 
to recognize the disproportionate impact of trauma and violence on SGM people and 
acknowledge the historical harms they may have already experienced interacting with the 
medical system. SGM individuals face a higher risk of poverty, stigma, marginalization, 
hypersexualization, and hate-motivated violence compared to their cisgender, heterosexual 
peers, making them more susceptible to experiencing trauma.15–17 In addition, there is 
often a multiplicative effect of intersectional minoritized identities on exposure to, and 
experiences of, trauma, making it imperative to recognize various intersecting factors and 
their impact on patient health and care engagement.18,19

SGM populations are more likely to have had adverse childhood experiences and secondary 
trauma from systems they seek help from.20 Healthcare settings can also exacerbate 
traumatic experiences. For example, it is estimated that only around 8% of SGM people 
who have experienced violence seek help from medical professionals.21–23 The estimated 
perceived helpfulness of medical support from those that have sought care ranges from

7–78%,21,24 pointing to inconsistent treatment of these individuals across healthcare spaces. 
Enacted stigma (e.g., verbal and physical violence targeted to SGM identity) can shape the 
cancer care experiences of SGM patients not only from providers but from other sources, 
like hospital staff and other patients.25 Stigma and fear of discrimination can also prevent 
SGM individuals from seeking care, with concerns of being blamed, not taken seriously, or 
being outed by those caring for them.23,26 This fear may lead to SGM patients not disclosing 
their sexual orientation to healthcare providers, which can create additional barriers to 
care.27 The intersectionality of the SGM patient, including other minoritized identities 
and comorbidities, such as diagnosis with HIV/AIDS,28 may also impact their experiences 
receiving care. Figure One describes other overlapping sources of trauma SGM patients 
may be disproportionately exposed to prior to entering a cancer care setting. Realizing this 
context and appreciating its impact on clinical presentation and healthcare interactions is 
crucial to providing affirming, high-quality, and effective care.29

Applying this to cancer care practice.—To ensure that providers across the cancer 
care continuum realize the unique impact of trauma on SGM populations, content related 
to this should be integrated into curricula, training requirements, and certification exam 
content. Additionally, including SGM status as a required data element in cancer registries 
and clinical trials could help us better understand the impact of trauma on cancer incidence 
and outcomes among SGM populations. This would ultimately promote better treatment 
outcomes for these populations. In addition, it is important to train future scientists to 
incorporate trauma history as a non-stigmatizing and non-discriminatory covariate to avoid 
missing opportunities to improve patient understanding, engagement, and quality cancer care 
across sexual orientation and gender identity spectrums. By doing so, we can ensure that all 
patients receive the best possible care and treatment, regardless of their sexual orientation or 
gender identity.

2.  Recognize the signs, symptoms, and impacts of trauma.

The long-term effects of trauma exposure on physical, mental, and psychosocial wellbeing 
are well established.30 In cancer care settings, the associated symptoms can affect cognitive 
processes and behaviors. For example, traumatic exposure impact the reactivity of the 
prefrontal cortex’s threat and fear responses, thus potentially decreasing patients’ abilities 
to manage emotions, build trusting relationships with cancer care providers, adhere to 
treatment, and adapt to stressful clinical environments..31 32 Trauma can also arise from 
negative healthcare experiences,33 which may influence patients’ decision-making regarding 
treatment14 and lead to greater distrust of oncology clinicians and institutions. Healthcare-
related trauma often stems from discrimination and stigma (i.e., racism, sexism, ableism, 
etc.),34 which disproportionately impact SGM patients. For example, SGM populations 
may exhibit lower rates of cancer screening due to enacted (i.e., previous experiences 
of unfair treatment) and/or felt (i.e., expectations of future unfair treatment) stimga.35–37 
Consequently, SGM patients with cancer are more likely to present with late-stage disease.38

Recognizing that healthcare-related trauma can occur at any point in a patient’s care journey, 
including before, during, or after cancer treatment, and during non-cancer-related care and 
being prepared for its potential consequences can help provide more proactive support for

patients across the cancer care continuum. By understanding that these experiences can 
be re-triggering for patients with trauma histories we can better understand and mitigate 
the barriers they face for cancer care engagement. For example, Kohler et al.39 found 
that women with sexual trauma histories may avoid Pap screenings altogether due to the 
potential for re-traumatization. Similarly, Farley et al.’s studies40,41 showed that some 
women may skip mammograms as a preventative measure against breast cancer to avoid 
further trauma. West et al found that disclosure of sexual orientation was a way to build 
trust in oncology providers, but often that trust was violated by the stigmatizing actions of 
providers.42 Regardless of the source, experiences or fears of healthcare-related trauma can 
contribute to cancer patients choosing to delay and/or avoid care.43,44 Overall, recognizing 
the signs, symptoms, and impacts of trauma on cancer patients and taking steps to create 
a trauma-informed approach to care can improve SGM patient outcomes, increase trust in 
healthcare providers, and ultimately lead to more effective and equitable cancer care.

Applying this to cancer care practice.—To effectively address and recognize the 
impact of trauma on cancer care, it is essential to collect and use SGM-relevant data for 
quality improvement, organizational growth, and understanding correlations between SGM 
trauma and treatment outcomes, in accordance with ASCO guidelines. This can include 
gathering demographic information on SGM patients, inquiring about trauma histories, and 
assessing potential symptoms of healthcare-related trauma throughout the patient’s care 
journey. Additionally, it is crucial to train clinicians on recognizing signs and symptoms of 
trauma and to educate patients on how their previous trauma histories can be exacerbated 
through cancer care. Engaging in conversations about patient triggers, preferences, and 
awareness of their histories can help providers integrate trauma-informed approaches into 
cancer care delivery, which can ultimately reduce potential harm and improve patient 
outcomes.

3.  Respond by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and 
practices.

Trauma-informed care has gained traction in healthcare over the past decade and has been 
increasingly integrated into various healthcare settings. In healthcare settings more broadly, 
trauma-informed care has been implemented through changes in policies, procedures, and 
practices. This includes the adoption of patient-centered communication techniques, the 
incorporation of trauma screening and assessment tools into routine care, and the provision 
of trauma-specific services and resources. Key principles of trauma-informed care involve 
prioritizing safety, providing opportunities for patient collaboration, and promoting patient 
voice and choice. See SAMHSA’s Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma-Informed 
Approach for a more detailed description of key principles of Trauma-informed care.14

While the application of this may look different depending on the healthcare setting, several 
studies have explored the application of trauma-informed care principles within healthcare 
practices and policies to improve treatment outcomes. For instance, a review of trauma-
informed care in oncology settings4 found that interprofessional collaboration in trauma-
informed care enhanced healthcare providers’ understanding of their patients’ physical and 
psychosocial needs, resulting in improved quality of life, maximized patient safety, and

increased trust between patient and provider.32,45,46 “Sensitive practice” tools can be used to 
identify potentially triggering aspects of cancer care (e.g., breast radiotherapy) for individual 
patients and relay that information to providers.47 Similar approaches, such as trauma-
informed reproductive health services, increase patient satisfaction and empowerment to 
manage their health risks.4,48,49

Trauma-informed approaches must include SGM-specific considerations to give providers 
the tools they need to adequately meet the needs of these populations. These considerations 
must address the intersectional identities of SGM cancer patients, which may affect how we 
deliver trauma-informed cancer care. Some examples of how cancer centers can attend to 
intersectional identities include offering translation services in multiple languages; creation 
of a patient advisory council that includes SGM members from different racial, ethnic, and 
socioeconomic backgrounds; and partnering with a local LGBTQ+ organization to provide 
outreach and engagement to SGM cancer patients. These learnings must then be integrated 
into all aspects of care delivery, including revising policies and procedures to reflect trauma-
informed practices. This includes using patient-centered communication techniques that 
validate patient experiences, avoiding re-traumatizing procedures whenever possible, and 
creating a safe and supportive environment for patients to share their trauma history if they 
feel comfortable doing so. For SGM patients, trauma-informed care should also involve 
creating gender-affirming and culturally competent spaces that promote inclusivity, respect, 
and understanding. Additionally, healthcare providers should provide additional resources 
and support, such as connecting patients with SGM-specific support groups or counseling 
services that are equipped to address the unique mental health needs of this population. 
Finally, it is crucial for providers to consider the impact that systemic discrimination and 
oppression may have on the physical and mental health of SGM patients, and work to 
critically examine policies at their clinical settings that perpetuate systemic inequities. By 
taking these steps, healthcare organizations can create a more supportive and inclusive 
environment for SGM patients who have experienced trauma, ultimately improving their 
overall health outcomes and quality of life.

Applying this to the cancer care setting.—To create trauma-responsive policies and 
practices, in alignment with ASCO guidelines, healthcare organizations should start by 
establishing and implementing policies that ensure equitable, culturally competent cancer 
care is accessible to all patients. The provision of trauma-informed care should not be a 
one-time training or initiative, but rather an ongoing process that is continually assessed, 
improved, and reinforced through regular staff development opportunities and education. 
This is particularly vital for improving care for SGM patients, as it can help decrease 
healthcare-related trauma. Also, trauma-informed care may ultimately enhance patient 
outcomes by enabling SGM patients to feel listened to and feel empowered to actively 
participate in their own care. In addition, healthcare organizations should expand patient 
access to culturally competent support services that are tailored to meet the unique needs 
of SGM patients, and implement policies that prohibit discrimination, as well as offer 
education and training to all healthcare providers and staff on the particular health disparities 
that affect SGM patients. Additionally, healthcare organizations should prioritize research 
that aims to comprehend the distinctive health needs and experiences of SGM patients

with cancer to develop evidence-based interventions that enhance health outcomes for this 
population. Creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all patients, regardless 
of their sexual orientation or gender identity, is crucial to reducing health disparities and 
ensuring that SGM patients receive the high-quality care they deserve.

4.  Resist Retraumatization actively by building awareness of and changing practices that 
perpetuate trauma and re-enact traumatizing relationships with SGM patients and their 
families.

A critical part of trauma-informed care is to proactively resist retraumatization before 
it occurs.4,50 Retraumatization is the reactivation of feelings/memories from negative 
past experiences.51 This requires integrating trauma-informed principles and changing 
practices that perpetuate trauma and re-enact traumatizing relationships with SGM patients 
and their families. By prioritizing safety, promoting trust and transparency promoting 
patient empowerment, and acknowledging socio-cultural and historical contexts, healthcare 
providers can reduce instances of retraumatization that SGM patients could experience in 
the cancer setting. By implementing these principles, healthcare providers are better able 
to create a safe and inclusive environment that is responsive to the unique needs and 
experiences of SGM patients and their families. These principles align with the ASCO 
guidelines for SGM Populations and may improve treatment outcomes, maximize patient 
safety, and increase trust between patient and provider.

In addition to the initiative-taking measures mentioned above, healthcare organizations 
may also benefit from reflecting on past experiences and practices to identify areas where 
they may have inadvertently caused harm or retraumatization to SGM patients. This could 
involve conducting an audit of patient complaints or conducting focus groups with SGM 
patients and their families to better understand their experiences in the healthcare setting. By 
identifying areas for improvement and committing to ongoing reflection and improvement, 
healthcare organizations may continuously work towards providing trauma-informed care 
that is responsive to the unique needs and experiences of SGM patients. It is essential to 
recognize that trauma-informed care is an ongoing process that requires a commitment to 
ongoing learning, growth, and reflection to ensure that all patients receive the best possible 
care.

Applying this to the cancer care setting.—To provide trauma-informed care for SGM 
patients, it is crucial to proactively resist retraumatization before it occurs. This involves 
integrating the trauma-informed principles discussed earlier to reduce the likelihood of SGM 
patients experiencing further trauma. Ensuring safety for SGM patients means creating 
policies that prohibit discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity and training all staff members to recognize and respond to situations where SGM 
patients may be at risk of harm or re-traumatization. It also means seeking feedback from 
SGM patients and their families and using it to make changes that promote a safer and more 
inclusive environment.

Building trust and transparency involves providing clear and consistent messaging around 
confidentiality, informed consent, and the patient’s right to control their own healthcare

decisions. It also includes providing prompt follow-up and continuity of care as suggested 
by the ASCO SGM Population guidelines. Collaboration and mutuality require healthcare 
providers to work with SGM patients and their families to develop culturally sensitive care 
plans that are responsive to their unique needs and experiences. It also involves equalizing 
power dynamics between clinicians and patients and involving SGM patients in all aspects 
of their care.

Peer support includes creating safe spaces where SGM patients can share their experiences 
and feelings, such as support groups or counseling services tailored to their needs. It 
also involves providing resources and referrals for legal support, mental health services, 
and community-based organizations that specialize in serving SGM patients and their 
families. Acknowledging cultural, historical, and gender issues means providing education 
and training to all staff members on the unique challenges and historical trauma faced by 
SGM patients and delivering culturally responsive and sensitive care.

It also means creating a welcoming and inclusive physical environment that reflects the 
diversity of SGM patients. Finally, promoting empowerment, voice, and choice for SGM 
cancer patients involves seeking out and incorporating feedback from SGM patients and 
their families in all aspects of care, providing education and resources to support informed 
decision-making, and encouraging SGM patients to participate in advocacy and leadership 
roles. These principles align with the ASCO SGM Population guidelines and aim to create 
safe spaces for SGM patients, expand and promote cultural competency training, ensure 
prompt follow-up and continuity of care, and ensure policies that prohibit discrimination.

5.  Reflect on our own biases, trauma histories, and organizational make up to understand 
how that might promote recovery or create barriers to equitable care for SGM patients.

Finally, while trauma-informed guidelines end there, we propose a fifth “R” to reflect on 
our own biases, trauma histories, and organizational make up to understand how that might 
promote recovery or create barriers to equitable care for SGM patients. This reflection 
can involve examining our own assumptions and beliefs about gender identity and sexual 
orientation, identifying any unconscious biases that may exist, and actively working to 
address them. By engaging in this ongoing reflection, healthcare providers can better 
understand and address the unique challenges faced by SGM cancer patients, and work 
towards providing more equitable and compassionate care for all individuals. This approach 
requires a fundamental shift in the way healthcare providers think about and deliver care, but 
it is essential to ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their sexual and gender identity, 
have access to high-quality cancer care that is grounded in respect, compassion, and cultural 
sensitivity.

Applying this to cancer care practice.—Encouraging provider reflection and 
debriefing can be a powerful tool in helping them deliver high-quality, trauma-informed 
care. In addition, healthcare organizations must prioritize the recruitment and training of 
staff who reflect the diversity of their patient population and have experience working 
with SGM patients. Community-based organizations that serve SGM individuals can be 
valuable partners in informing cancer care programs and services. Healthcare organizations

must prioritize the retention of diverse staff by fostering a supportive and inclusive work 
environment that values the unique perspectives and experiences of all employees. Safe 
and brave spaces are important not only for patients but also for healthcare providers and 
staff, who may themselves identify as SGM individuals. By implementing these strategies 
and creating a culture of inclusivity, healthcare organizations can improve the quality of 
care provided to SGM cancer patients, promote the well-being and job satisfaction of their 
staff, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. To achieve this, healthcare organizations and 
providers must commit to examining their biases and assumptions, actively working towards 
creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace and prioritizing the unique needs of SGM 
cancer patients in all aspects of care delivery.

Policy-Level Barriers to Trauma-informed SGM Cancer Care

A number of recently passed “anti-LGBTQ” laws may limit the capacity of cancer care 
organizations to implement trauma-informed SGM cancer care in a number of states. 
In 2022 alone, 315 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in state legislatures across the 
U.S.52 These laws, such as Florida Senate Bills 254 and 1580,53,54 can directly limit 
access to SGM-affirming care and license discrimination based on sexual orientation 
and/or gender identity. They can also create perceptions of hostile healthcare environments 
among SGM patients, erode trust in healthcare providers, and ultimately exacerbating 
feelings of trauma and marginalization. Additionally, such policies may directly and 
indirectly impede healthcare organizations’ efforts to implement trauma-informed practices 
by limiting resources, inhibiting data collection on SGM populations, and discouraging 
staff from receiving adequate training in providing culturally competent care. Cancer care 
organizations and providers should actively advocate for policies that protect the rights and 
well-being of SGM populations. They can also engage in research that examines the impact 
of anti-LGBT state policies on SGM cancer patients in order to support policy changes and 
strengthen the case for trauma informed care.

Conclusions

Trauma-informed care is vital to improving care quality for SGM cancer patients. Trauma-
informed cancer care is prepared for SGM patients’ past or future traumatic experiences, 
while also recognizing and responding to structural and historical harms. In addition, it 
recognizes the role of the surrounding community, particularly how violence, substance use, 
hunger, poverty, and housing insecurity may contribute to further trauma and/or negatively 
impact healing. Infusing trauma-informed care with ASCO SGM Population guidelines, 
highlights the complementary nature of these approaches and the necessity of using a 
trauma-informed lens when trying to prioritize patient empowerment, reduce potential harm, 
and improve outcomes for SGM cancer patients. Future research in this area should focus on 
developing tailored trauma-informed interventions and understanding the impact of trauma-
informed care on cancer care outcomes and patient satisfaction. It is also important to 
investigate the effectiveness of training healthcare providers in trauma-informed care and 
the experiences of SGM cancer survivors to provide appropriate post-treatment support. 
By acknowledging and addressing the impact of trauma on the physical and mental health 
outcomes of SGM cancer patients, healthcare providers can create a safe and supportive
