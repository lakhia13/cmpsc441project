Abstract

Background: Underserved and minoritized patients with cancer often experience more psychosocial concerns and inferior quality of
life (QOL) compared with majority populations. This study compared patient-reported psychosocial characteristics and QOL among
self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority patients with cancer vs cisgender-heterosexual patients with cancer treated at a National
Cancer Institute–designated comprehensive cancer center in the United States.

Methods: Self-report data from 51 503 patients were obtained from an institutional standard-of-care electronic patient questionnaire
that was completed prior to, or on the day of, the patient’s initial visit. The electronic patient questionnaire collects demographic
information, including sexual orientation and gender identity, psychosocial variables, and QOL using the validated Short Form
Health Survey–12. Sexual orientation and gender identity information was used to identify self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority
and cisgender-heterosexual persons (ie, non–self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority). Using parametric analyses, psychosocial
variables and QOL measures were compared for self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority vs non–self-identiﬁed sexual and gender
minority patients with cancer.

Results: Compared with non–self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority patients (n ¼ 50 116), self-identiﬁed sexual and gender
minority patients (n ¼ 1387, 2.7%) reported statistically signiﬁcantly greater concerns regarding getting help during treatment (2.6%
vs 4.3%, respectively; P ¼ .001) and concerns with ability to seek care (16.7% vs 21.6%, respectively, P < .001). Self-identiﬁed sexual and
gender minority patients reported statistically signiﬁcantly elevated mental health concerns and daily emotional and pain interfer-
ence (all P < .001), whereas there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in daily interference due to physical functioning.

Conclusion: These data reveal real-world disparities among self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority patients with cancer, which
can be used to develop psychosocial interventions tailored to address the unique psychosocial and QOL needs of this underserved
and minoritized population and to ultimately improve cancer care.

Sexual and gender minority persons are those who identify as,
but are not limited to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
asexual, and/or nonbinary (1). Self-identified sexual and gender
minority populations are medically underserved and marginal-
ized and experience substantial disparities across the cancer care
continuum from prevention to survivorship (2). This is a pressing
public health concern as the number of people comfortable iden-
tifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or something other
than heterosexual has doubled over the last decade to 7.2% (3).

Self-identified sexual and gender minority patients often expe-
rience barriers to appropriate care, which can be attributed to
limited knowledge of providers regarding self-identified sexual
and gender minority health-care needs, lack of self-identified
sexual and gender minority–inclusive and –specific guidelines,
and lack of health-care clinics creating a welcoming and

inclusive environment
(4-9). For example, sexual minority
patients with cancer compared with heterosexual patients
reported statistically significantly lower satisfaction with overall
cancer care because of unmet needs (eg, lack of involvement in
decision making) (5). Concealment of self-identified sexual and
gender minority identity (9) and various forms of romantic rela-
tionships among self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients (eg, same-sex partner) (6) may preclude opportunities
for a full range of support in cancer care, which may adversely
impact general health outcomes in this population (9,10). In par-
ticular, self-identified sexual and gender minority patients with
cancer reported that the quality of cancer care was negatively
affected by the providers’ lack of self-identified sexual and gen-
der minority knowledge and skills, safety concerns in disclosure
of self-identified sexual and gender minority identities, concerns

about intersectionality (eg, quality of care affected by an intersec-
tion of race, partner status, and self-identified sexual and gender
minority status), and lack of integration of nontraditional care-
givers (eg, partner vs spouse) in their care (4,11).

One step for addressing unmet needs of self-identified sexual
and gender minority patients with cancer is the systematic col-
lection of sexual orientation and gender identity as a standard-
of-care demographic in oncology settings. Extant literature has
shown self-identified sexual and gender minority persons with
cancer compared with cisgender-heterosexual patients with can-
cer experience higher rates of discrimination (12), greater rates of
psychosocial and mental health concerns (12-16), and poorer
quality of life (QOL) (12,13). Evidence suggests mental health con-
ditions can have a detrimental impact on cancer outcomes (17)
and adherence to cancer treatment (18). However, lack of routine
sexual orientation and gender identity data collection in the med-
ical record raises pragmatic challenges in understanding and
addressing disparities and inequities among self-identified sexual
and gender minority patients, unmet needs in cancer care (eg,
psychosocial concerns), and improving quality care (19).

The goal of this study was to analyze self-reported question-
naire data including sexual orientation and gender identity infor-
mation on more than 50 000 patients from a tertiary cancer
center in the United States to determine if self-identified sexual
and gender minority patients with cancer compared with
cisgender-heterosexual patients with cancer report greater psy-
chosocial concerns and lower QOL. The results from this study
could be leveraged to develop interventions to reduce cancer-
related health disparities among self-identified sexual and gen-
der minority patients with cancer.

Methods
Study population
This analysis includes patients who came to the H. Lee Moffitt
Cancer Center and Research Institute (Tampa, FL, USA) between
September 2016 and January 2021 and completed the institu-
tional standard-of-care electronic patient questionnaire. During
this time period, the catchment area of the cancer center
included 15 counties spanning from West Central to Central
Florida, which includes approximately 30% of Florida’s total pop-
ulation. All patients were aged 18 years and older. The study was
approved by an institutional review board (Advarra, institutional
review board protocol #20549).

Electronic patient questionnaire
The primary source of data was the institution-wide electronic
patient questionnaire, which every new patient completes prior
to or on the day of first visit. Patients can complete the electronic
patient questionnaire either through a web-based patient portal
or on a tablet in the clinic prior to appointment. The electronic
patient questionnaire is comprised of 12 modules collecting dem-
ographic information, personal and family history of cancer,
medical history, current physical symptoms, cancer risk behav-
iors, psychosocial factors, and QOL. For this analysis, data were
analyzed from the demographic, psychosocial, and QOL modules.
In September 2016, the demographic module was modified to
begin collecting sexual orientation and was modified again in
April 2018 to begin collecting gender identity. The questions and
response options were based on Fenway Institute’s “Do Ask, Do
Tell” guidelines (20). Specifically, one question collected sexual
orientation (“Do you think of yourself as [options]?”), and the
other question collected gender identity (“What is your current

gender identity?”). The sexual orientation question response
options are lesbian, gay, or homosexual; straight or heterosexual;
bisexual; something else with an option of providing free text
responses; and don’t know. The response options for gender iden-
tity include male; female; transgender; gender queer or nonbi-
nary; additional gender category or other; and decline to answer.

Measures
Outcome measures included items in the psychosocial and QOL
modules of the electronic patient questionnaire. The 5-item psy-
chosocial module assessed psychosocial needs and concerns
including having someone who can help during treatment; living
alone; considering having a child or children in the future; want-
ing to discuss fertility-related issues; and concerns about the abil-
ity to seek care at Moffitt (eg, transportation, financial, family
care, or spiritual concerns). Response options were yes or no to
each item.

The QOL module comprised 13 items including the single-item
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status
Scale (5-point Likert scale: 1 ¼ completely disabled, 5 ¼ fully
active) (21) and 12-item Short-Form Health Survey–12 (22,23).
The Short Form Health Survey–12 assessed physical and mental
health indexed by 2 scales: physical component summary and
mental component summary. The physical component summary
functioning, role-
comprised items that measured physical
physical (experienced difficulties due to physical functioning),
bodily pain, and perceived general health. The mental compo-
nent summary included items that measured vitality, social
functioning, role-emotional (experienced limitations due to emo-
tional difficulties), and mental health (eg, feeling blue). Per the
scoring instruction (22), the scores of 2 scales (physical compo-
nent summary and mental component summary) were standar-
dized (mean ¼ 50 [standard devation ¼ 10]). The 8 subscales,
mentioned above, were scored as recommended in the literature
(range ¼ 0-100) (24). Lower subscale scores refer to greater diffi-
culty in each scale and subscale.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the Stata 14.0 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) and SPSS Statistics 26
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity questions were used to generate a new variable to identify
patients as self-identified sexual and gender minority or
cisgender-heterosexual patients (ie, non–self-identified sexual
and gender minority). Patients who responded “Don’t know/
Decline to answer” to the sexual orientation and gender identity
questions were not included in our analyses because we were
unable to identify them as either a sexual minority or gender
minority. Because the Short Form Health Survey–12 was one of
the main outcome measures, those who did not provide any
responses to the Short Form Health Survey–12 were also not
including frequencies, percen-
included. Descriptive statistics,
tages, means, and standard deviations, were used to quantify
electronic patient questionnaire responses comparing self-
identified sexual and gender minority vs non–self-identified sex-
ual and gender minority patients. Pearson v2 test and independ-
ent sample t test were used for categorical and continuous
dependent variables, respectively. Correlation analyses were con-
ducted between the outcome variables and demographic varia-
bles. Multivariable linear regression was conducted to adjust for
demographic variables. Additional self-identified sexual and gen-
der minority subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sub-
groups, specifically, 1) sexual minority vs non–self-identified

sexual and gender minority after excluding gender minority
patients; 2) bisexual vs lesbian, gay, or homosexual patients; and
3) bisexual vs non–self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and statistical signifi-
cance was determined at a P value less than .05.

Results
Demographics
Complete electronic patient questionnaire data for the modules
of interest were available on 51 503 patients (Table 1). Self-
identified sexual and gender minority patients represented 2.7%
of the study population. Compared with non–self-identified sex-
ual and gender minority patients with cancer, self-identified sex-
ual and gender minority patients were younger (P < .001), more
likely to identify as Hispanic or Latinx (P ¼ .001), and a racial
minority (P < .001).

Psychosocial concerns
Self-identified sexual and gender minority patients were statisti-
cally significantly (Table 2) less likely to have a family member or
friend who could help during their illness and treatment than
non– self-identified sexual and gender minority patients (95.7%
vs 97.3%; P ¼ .001). Self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients as compared with non–self-identified sexual and gender
minority patients were statistically significantly more likely to
live alone (19.2% vs 13.8%; P < .001), considering or unsure of hav-
ing a child or children in the future (8.6% vs 4.6% and 6.4% vs

3.1%, respectively; P < .001), wanting to discuss fertility-related
issues (4.7% vs 2.5%; P < .001), and be concerned about their abil-
ity to seek care at Moffitt Cancer Center (21.6% vs 16.7%; P < .001).

Quality of life
There were no statistically significant differences between self-
identified sexual and gender minority and non–self-identified
sexual and gender minority patients for ECOG Performance
Status Scale and Physical Component Summary–12. However,
there was a statistically significant difference in Mental
Component Summary–12. Specifically, self-identified sexual and
gender minority patients reported statistically significantly lower
mental health functioning as indexed by Mental Component
Summary–12. Among the 4 Mental Component Summary–12
subscales, self-identified sexual and gender minority individuals
reported lower levels of vitality, social functioning, and mental
health (ie, feeling calm or peaceful less frequently, feeling down-
hearted or blue more frequently), as well as greater levels of per-
ceived limitations due to emotional difficulties (all P < .001).
Among the 4 Physical Component Summary–12 subscales, self-
identified sexual and gender minority patients with cancer
reported statistically significantly greater interference with daily
activities due to bodily pain (P < .001) and poorer general health
(P ¼.02). No statistically significant differences between self-
identified sexual and gender minority and non–self-identified
sexual and gender minority patients were observed in either
physical functioning or perceived difficulties due to physical
functioning.

b Statistically signiﬁcant difference between self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority and non–self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority patients when

controlling for age, ethnicity, and race as compared with the non–self-identiﬁed sexual and gender minority individuals.

Because age, ethnicity, and race were statistically significantly
different between self-identified sexual and gender minority and
non–self-identified sexual and gender minority patients, multi-
variable regression was used to control for potential confounding.
After controlling for age, ethnicity, and race in each model, the
overall results did not change except for the models with
Physical Component Summary–12, physical functioning, and
role-physical. Specifically, the multivariable model revealed that
self-identified sexual and gender minority individuals compared
with non–self-identified sexual and gender minority individuals
reported statistically significantly worse levels of general physical
health as indexed by Physical Component Summary–12 (P ¼ .01),
physical functioning (P ¼ .02), and role-physical (P ¼ .001).

Exploratory subgroup analyses
The results from the subgroup analyses (Supplementary Tables
1-3, available online) were largely similar to the main results.

Discussion

In this analysis of more than 50 000 patients with cancer treated
at a tertiary cancer center, we found self-identified sexual and
gender minority patients with cancer were more likely to report
statistically significantly greater psychosocial concerns and lower
mental health QOL. Specifically, self-identified sexual and gender
minority patients reported statistically significantly higher rates
of concerns regarding getting help during treatment as well as
higher perceived interference with ability to seek care and daily
emotional and/or pain interference. These findings have impor-
tant implications in that self-identified sexual and gender minor-
ity patients with cancer have unique psychosocial concerns and
needs in their cancer care and may enter their cancer treatment
with mental health concerns, which may interact with their
engagement in cancer care and relevant outcomes. The explora-
tory subgroup analyses revealed bisexual patients with cancer
reported statistically significantly greater psychosocial concerns

and lower mental health QOL as compared with lesbian, gay, or
homosexual patients or non–self-identified sexual and gender
minority patients. These findings are consistent with the extant
literature that reported bisexual individuals are more prone to
experience depressive and anxiety symptoms (25) and lower per-
ceived connection to self-identified sexual and gender minority
community (26). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first that presents the psychosocial concerns and mental health
concerns among self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients with cancer using standard-of-care sexual orientation
and gender identity data collection at a National Cancer Institute
(NCI)–designated cancer center.

Unique psychosocial needs and concerns among self-
identified sexual and gender minority patients are aligned with
extant qualitative (4) and descriptive findings (12-16). For exam-
ple, self-identified sexual and gender minority patients with can-
cer experience individual- and structural-level barriers to
appropriate care and/or support because of providers’ lack of
knowledge and/or skills in working with self-identified sexual
and gender minority patients and premature assumptions of dis-
crimination over the course of cancer care (eg, misgendering,
intersection between racism and heterosexism, mistreatment)
(4). Transgender patients with cancer are more likely to receive a
cancer diagnosis at a late stage and are less likely to receive
appropriate treatment along with poor survival rates compared
with cisgender patients (27). The likelihood of self-identified sex-
ual and gender minority patients with cancer seeking support
from nonbiological family members (9) and to be younger and
unmarried (12,27) may also contribute to the concerns of getting
help for their cancer treatment. Furthermore, our results suggest
a need for consultation on fertility-related issues and family
planning in this population (28). We also note these results are
not confounded by self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients being statistically significantly younger than the non–
self-identified
patients
sexual
(Supplementary Table 4, available online).

and

A stark contrast emerged in the QOL results between mental
health and physical health. Although there were no statistically
significant differences between self-identified sexual and gender
minority and non–self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients in physical QOL indices (with the exception of bodily
pain and perceived general health), mental QOL was statistically
significantly lower among self-identified sexual and gender
minority patients. These results are not surprising given low QOL
as indexed by Mental Component Summary–12 is reported
among disadvantaged and marginalized populations. For exam-
ple, sexual minority adults as compared with heterosexual adults
reported lower QOL as indexed by the Mental Component
Summary–12 even after accounting for various demographic and
psychosocial
factors (29). Mental QOL indexed by Mental
Component Summary–12 has been negatively associated with
HIV stigma (30) and racial discrimination exposure (31), which
supports the role of minority stress in low mental QOL among
self-identified sexual and gender minority individuals as posited
in Minority Stress Theory (32). Our findings indicate self-
identified sexual and gender minority patients with cancer are
more likely to suffer from poor mental health, which may make
them vulnerable to experiencing high distress throughout their
cancer care (eg, because of minority stress from the interaction
with providers, less engagement in self-care, and/or lack of sup-
port system).

Though self-identified sexual and gender minority patients
were statistically significantly younger, there were no differences

between self-identified sexual and gender minority and non–self-
identified sexual and gender minority patients in perceived phys-
ical functioning as indexed by the ECOG, Physical Component
Summary–12, and 2 Physical Component Summary–12 subscales
(physical
functioning, role-physical), whereas perceived pain
interference and perceived general health were statistically sig-
nificantly lower among self-identified sexual and gender minor-
ity patients with cancer. When controlling for age, ethnicity, and
race, the self-identified sexual and gender minority patients (vs
non–self-identified sexual and gender minority) reported statisti-
cally significantly worse physical health, physical functioning,
and role-physical. Pain is a complex construct that cuts across
objective sensory and subjective emotional experiences that can
occur without medical cause (33). Evidence shows pain is linked
to emotional difficulties (eg,
loneliness, depression) among
patients with cancer (34) and individuals with mental health con-
cerns (35). Thus, greater pain interference reported by self-
identified sexual and gender minority individuals is well aligned
with our findings on mental health concerns.

Limitations of the current study include the results are cross-
sectional and do not measure potential temporal changes of psy-
chosocial concerns and/or QOL. Second, the study population
comprised patients from a single cancer center and are predomi-
nantly non-Hispanic White. Thus, the generalizability of the cur-
findings may be limited. The study population is
rent
heterogenous as it includes patients across different cancer diag-
noses and stages. The minority representation of the study popu-
lation was slightly lower than the catchment area and the United
States (Supplementary Table 5, available online). Where possible,
future studies need to examine the impact of intersectionality on
psychosocial concerns and needs in a more diverse study popula-
tion. Another limitation was limited number of transgender
patients (n ¼ 21) and other gender minority patients (n ¼ 10), who
are often underrepresented in research (14). The gender identity
question was added 18 months after the sexual orientation ques-
tion, so some individuals may be misclassified; however, the
results were unchanged when we analyzed only sexual minor-
ities using the sexual orientation question (Supplementary Table
6, available online). Finally, patients who selected “don’t know”
for sexual orientation and “decline to answer” for gender identity
question were not included in the analysis because they could
not be classified as a sexual or gender minority or as a non–sex-
ual and gender minority.

(which is an antiquated term)

We do acknowledge limitations and issues to consider related
to the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity and
provide some recommendations. The 2-item sexual orientation
and gender identity questions allowed patients to select only a
single response, which limited consideration of multi-identities.
Though patients can skip any question, the sexual orientation
question did not have “decline to answer” allowing for nondisclo-
sure. The sexual orientation question grouped lesbian, gay, and
homosexual
into 1 response
option. To address these complexities, we offer some recommen-
dations based on our experiences: allow for multiple responses
for the sexual orientation and gender identity questions, include
“decline to answer” for those who are reluctant to identify, do not
group identities or orientations into a single response, avoid anti-
quated and offensive terminology, and include a diverse com-
munity advisory board to provide feedback on best ways to
collect such information. Our institution is currently revising the
response options of the sexual orientation and gender identity
questions to overcome these limitations.

This analysis demonstrates the importance of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity collection. Standard-of-care institution-
wide sexual orientation and gender identity collection is uncom-
mon as evidenced by the results from a survey led by the self-
identified sexual and gender minority task force of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology Health Equity Committee (19). The
NCI recently launched the sexual orientation and gender identity
data collection initiative, providing funding to 14 of 71 NCI-
designated cancer centers as of December 2022 (36). Although
Moffitt Cancer Center was ahead of such initiatives and has
included sexual orientation and gender identity questions as a
standard-of-care since 2016, unless patients voluntarily disclose
or providers carefully review the medical records including elec-
tronic patient questionnaire, it is still the patients’ burden to dis-
close their self-identified sexual and gender minority status.
Institutional commitment to collect and include sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity data as part of standard cancer care is
strongly recommended. The needs of self-identified sexual and
gender minority patients should be distinctively identified at
both individual (eg, the impact of intersectionality on concerns
and/or needs, mental health conditions, existence of social sup-
port) and structural levels (eg, providers’ own biases and further
training, policy advocacy) for a systematic approach to this popu-
lation’s needs (32,37). In particular, attention should be given to
unique needs among specific self-identified sexual and gender
minority subgroups (eg, bisexual).

To address the unique health-care needs of self-identified sex-
ual and gender minority populations, interventions at system
and individual levels should be provided. Through a standardized
regular provider training for self-identified sexual and gender
minority patients at cancer center level, oncology providers
should be equipped to provide culturally and clinically compe-
tent care to self-identified sexual and gender minority patients
(38). Examples include providing safe environments by using
inclusive language and checking desired pronouns and names,
being aware of one’s premature assumptions about the impact of
self-identified sexual and gender minority status on cancer care
(eg, relationship with caregiver) (6), demystifying the belief that
self-identified sexual and gender minority patients would feel
uncomfortable to discuss their self-identified sexual and gender
minority status (11,19), and being aware of history of disclosure
and planned transition (eg, surgeries, hormone therapy, fertility
plans) (4,39). Institutional commitment to train providers regu-
larly on self-identified sexual and gender minority cancer care
would also be crucial (19). At the individual-level, psychosocial
interventions for self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients with cancer and survivors need to be implemented as
part of their cancer care, along with research that examines the
impact of early intervention on cancer outcomes (12). Examples
include connecting self-identified sexual and gender minority
patients to self-identified sexual and gender minority peer men-
tors with cancer experiences and providing self-identified sexual
and gender minority caregiver support, psychoeducation on self-
identified sexual and gender minority cancer, and a self-
identified sexual and gender minority patient support group (11).
Understanding disparities among self-identified sexual and
gender minority patients is crucial to providing personalized can-
cer care for this minoritized population. This is the first study
reporting the psychosocial concerns and mental health concerns
among self-identified sexual and gender minority patients with
standard-of-care sexual
cancer based on institution-wide,

orientation and gender identity collection. Importantly, these
data provide specific areas to prioritize resources such as ensur-
ing access to quality mental health services. Findings also sup-
port efforts for expanding the routine collection of sexual
orientation and gender identity data to all health-care facilities
including cancer centers. Once implemented, patient-level data
collected across cancer centers can be leveraged to reveal crucial
information on the unique health-care needs among self-
identified sexual and gender minority patients, which will ulti-
mately contribute to improving cancer care and mitigate dispar-
ities and inequities. Our results add to the existing literature by
elucidating difficulty that patients anticipate in cancer treatment
and interference with daily functioning among self-identified
sexual and gender minority patients with heterogeneous cancer
types.
