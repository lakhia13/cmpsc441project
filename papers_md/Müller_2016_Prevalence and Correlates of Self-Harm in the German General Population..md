Abstract

The study aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of the German version of the
Self- Harm Inventory (SHI) and examining the lifetime prevalence and correlates of self-
harm in a representative German population sample (N = 2,507; age mean = 48.79, SD =
18.11; range 14 to 94 years; 55.5% women) using the SHI. All participants answered the
German SHI, the short form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-15), the ultra-brief
Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4), and provided sociode-
mographic information. The one-factorial structure of the SHI was replicated using a confir-
matory factor analysis. Internal consistency coefficients were sufficient and in line with
previous studies. Almost half of the sample (49%) acknowledged at least one self-harming
behavior over the life-span, most frequently indirect forms of self-harm. The rate of partici-
pants who engaged in at least one SHI behavior was higher among men than women
(51.6% vs. 46.9%, respectively, χ2 = 5.38, p = 0.020). Higher SHI scores were related to
younger age, male gender, living alone, more symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-
4), higher impulsivity scores (BIS-15), and suffering from obesity grade 2. Women engaged
more often in discreet forms of self-harm than men, e.g., preventing wounds from healing,
exercising an injury, starving, and abusing laxatives. In terms of other indirect self-harming
behaviors, men admitted more often driving recklessly, being promiscuous and losing a job
on purpose, while women reported more frequently engaging in emotionally abusive rela-
tionships. With respect to direct self-harm, women were more likely to endorse suicide
attempts and cutting, while men admitted more often head-banging. The findings suggest
that self-harm constitutes a common problem. Future longitudinal studies are required to
examine the natural course, sociodemographic and psychopathological risk factors, as well
as possible time-trends of self-harming behaviors in more depth.

Self-Harm in the German Population

Introduction

Self-harm is conceptualized as a wide range of self-directed harmful behaviors, regardless of
their suicidal intent. According to Sansone, Wiederman, and Sansone [1], it “probably exists
along a continuum from graphic, self-harm behavior to milder forms of self-sabotaging behavior
that might be viewed as self-defeating” (p. 973). This means that the broad category of deliberate
self-harm includes both, direct as well as indirect forms of self-damaging behaviors. It is note-
worthy that terms such as “self-harm” and “self-injury” are often used synonymously in the lit-
erature, which can be a source of confusion [2, 3]. Self-injury refers to socially unaccepted direct
and deliberate destruction (i.e. direct self-harm) of one’s own body surface (e.g. cutting, burning,
scratching, biting) without suicidal intent and does not involve indirect forms of self-damaging
behaviors [2, 4, 5]. Indirect self-harm is conceptualized as behavior that is also damaging to the
self but does not encompass deliberate damage to body tissue. Typical indirect self-harming
behaviors are engagement in risky and recklessness behaviors or abusive relationships, disor-
dered eating, substance abuse, etc. [6]. Another discrepancy in the literature pertains to the
inclusion vs. exclusion of suicidal intention in the definition of self-harm. Researchers from the
UK define self-harming behaviors regardless of suicidal intention, whereas in the U.S.A. self-
injury is considered as self-damaging behavior without suicidal intent [7]. Non-suicidal self-
injury (NSSI) has been included as a separate clinical syndrome in Section III of the 5th edition
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [8]. Although NSSI refers
to the direct injury of one’s own bodily tissue without suicidal intent, it can increase the risk for
suicide attempts [4, 9]. Accordingly, many authors argue that it is essential to routinely assess
the frequency and the functions of NSSI in order to prevent death by suicide [4, 5, 10]. Nock
and Prinstein [11] described four primary functions of NSSI that differ along two dichotomous
dimensions. The first dimension refers to contingencies that are related to the self (autonomous)
or to others (social); the second dimension refers to positive (i.e., the presentation of a favorable
stimulus) or negative reinforcement (i.e., the removal of an aversive stimulus). By crossing these
two dimensions, four primary function domains appear: automatic-positive reinforcement (e.g.,
engaging in NSSI to feel pain, which is considered as positive), automatic-negative reinforce-
ment (e.g., engaging in NSSI to remove negative feelings), social-positive reinforcement (e.g.,
NSSI is followed by attention from others), and finally, social-negative reinforcement (e.g.,
engaging in NSSI to escape from social demands). Automatic-negative reinforcement is the
most frequently reported function of NSSI [11].

Thereinafter, we use the term “self-harm” focusing on the phenomenon in a broader sense,
including direct and indirect forms of self-harm with and without suicidal intent. It may occur
at all ages, with a peak in adolescence and young adulthood [12]. The large-scale Child and
Adolescent Self-harm in Europe (CASE) Study (n = 30,477) indicated that 2.6% of the 15 to 16
years old school students had single and 3.2% had multiple episodes of suicidal and non-sui-
cidal self-harm during the past year [13]. Findings from an Australian longitudinal study using
a single item question to assess self-harm (“In the last reference period have you ever deliber-
ately hurt yourself or done anything that you knew might have harmed you or even killed
you?”) suggested that most self-harming behaviors in adolescents resolve spontaneously to
young adulthood [14]. NSSI [15] as well as suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm [16] ooccur in
the general population but are especially common in clinical samples. According to the litera-
ture, both suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm are associated with high levels of impulsivity,
anxiety, and depression [13, 17–20]. Individuals who engage in self-harm may suffer from sev-
eral mental disorders. The link between NSSI [21] and non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm [7]
and the borderline personality disorder, affective disorders and substance use disorders is well
established [22]. There exists also evidence for the association between NSSI (i.e. self-injurious

behaviors) and eating disorders [23–25]. Furthermore, it appears that patients with extreme
obesity seeking bariatric surgery exhibit high levels of suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm [26].

While the majority of previous studies indicated that female gender is predictive, some
researchers have reported equal rates of non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm among men and
women [16, 27, 28]. Findings from a study investigating non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm in the
UK suggest that individuals living alone are more likely to engage in self-harming behaviors than
those in a relationship [29]. No link was found between educational level and non-suicidal and
suicidal self-harm among individuals who attended emergency departments in Scandinavia [22].
The Self Harm Inventory (SHI) developed by Sansone et al. [1] is a widely used self-report
measure that generates information about a broad range of self-harming behaviors over the life
span. The behaviors are—according to Latimer, Covic, Cumming, and Tennant [30]—charac-
terized by physical vs. non-physical (i.e., burn self vs. self-defeating thoughts), direct vs. indi-
rect (i.e., cut self vs. starve oneself), and intrapersonal vs. interpersonal (i.e., overdose vs. be
promiscuous) self-harm. The pilot version of the SHI consisted of 41 items that were created in
accordance with the literature and the clinical experience of the authors and their teams [1]. In
developing the final version of the SHI, items were selected based on their correlation with the
Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB; [31]. Items which did not correlate with the DIB
were deleted, leading to the final SHI with 22 items. Later on, a SHI cut-off score of 5 [1] or 11
[30] was suggested to be indicative of borderline personality disorder. However, there is some
discussion whether it is appropriate to assess the borderline personality disorder solely based
on self-harming behaviors given that this is only of the nine diagnostic criteria of the borderline
personality disorder listed in DSM-5 [8].

The items of the SHI were preceded by the following statement “Have you ever inten-
tionally, or on purpose . . . (e.g.) engaged in cutting yourself?”. The questions ask for lifetime
history of engagement in self-harming behaviors and are answered on a Yes / No format; the
total score is determined by the total number of endorsed items [1]. In line with the UK defini-
tion of self-harming behaviors, the SHI does not differentiate between self-harming behaviors
with and without suicidal intent.

The factor structure of the SHI inventory was empirically investigated by Latimer et al. [30],

who found support for a one-factor structure of the SHI. Sansone, Songer, and Sellbom [32]
rationally derived six symptom clusters, which were however never empirically validated. They
referred to a suicidal cluster (e.g., overdosed, attempted suicide), a self-injury cluster (e.g., cut,
burned, hit, scratched self, banged head), a substance abuse cluster (e.g., abuse prescribed med-
ication, laxatives, alcohol), a cluster referring to abusive relationships (e.g., engage in emotion-
ally abusive/sexually abusive relationships) and a cluster of medically self-defeating behaviors
(e.g., prevent wounds from healing, exercised an injury on purpose).

The reliability or internal consistency of the total SHI was investigated in different samples
and proved to be very good, with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.80 to 0.90; 0.80 in a sample
of 107 psychiatric inpatients (57% female; 18–65 years; [32]), 0.83 in a sample of 423 Australian
university students 81% females, 17–30 years; [30], 0.89 in a sample of 52 women seeking treat-
ment in an internal medicine clinic (24–70 years; [33]) and, finally, 0.90 in a sample of 94 inter-
nal medicine outpatients (60.6% females, 18–65 years; [34].

Latimer et al. [30] investigated the association between the SHI total score and gender and
age in a sample of 423 university students (81% females). Females reported significantly more
self-harming behaviors than males; whereas younger students (17 to 19 years) reported signifi-
cantly less self-harm behaviors compared to older students (20 to 30 years) [30].

In addition, Latimer et al. [30] studied the link between the SHI and depression, anxiety
and stress. They divided their student sample in three groups based on the SHI total score: low
(1 to 4), medium (5 to 10) and high (11+). The results showed significant differences between

Self-Harm in the German Population

the three groups concerning depression, anxiety and stress; with increasing levels of depression,
anxiety and stress from the low SHI group, over the medium, to the high SHI group [30].
Moreover, several studies have investigated the association between the SHI total score and dif-
ferent measures of borderline personality disorder [1, 35].

While many studies assessed self-harm (most often NSSI) in German adolescents [3, 36,

37], no study to date examined the prevalence and correlates of self-harm (including both
direct and indirect self-harming behaviors) in a representative sample of German adults,
including older age groups. To the best of our knowledge, the German translation of the SHI
was never validated. To fill up this gap, the aims of the present study were twofold. The study
was designed to 1) evaluate the psychometric properties of the German version of the SHI, and
2) examine sociodemographic and psychopathological correlates of self-harm in a large-scale
population-based adult German sample.

Based on existing studies [1, 30] we hypothesised that the German version of the SHI would

be a one-dimensional instrument with good internal consistency. With respect to sociodemo-
graphic correlates, we expected higher rates of self-harm among women, no link between self-
harm and educational level, and less self-harm among individuals being single compared to
those living with a partner. In terms of associated psychopathology we hypothesized to find
strong positive correlations between the occurrence of self-harming behaviors and symptoms
of anxiety and depression, and impulsivity. Given that previous research reported high preva-
lence rates of self-harm in extremely obese individuals [26] we presumed a positive association
between self-harm and higher weight.

Procedure

Ethics Statement

The survey met the ethical guidelines of the International Code of Marketing and Social
Research Practice by the International Chamber of Commerce and the European Society for
Opinion and Marketing Research. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Uni-
versity of Leipzig.

Data Sampling

Data were collected between March and May 2015. A random sample of the German general
population older than 14 years of age was selected with the assistance of a demographic con-
sulting company (USUMA, Berlin, Germany). The sampling procedure followed the estab-
lished guidelines on how to construct a random population sample in Germany when no
access to a population roster is possible. This sampling design involves three consecutive steps:
in the first step, a grid of 258 regional sampling areas was randomly selected from a roster of
such non-overlapping grids that have been centrally assembled to enhance representativeness
in stratified regional sampling in Germany. In the second step, a random procedure to select
households of the respective area was implemented within all sampling areas. In the final step,
one member of the selected household fulfilling the inclusion criteria (age 14 or older, able to
read and understand the German language) was sampled randomly in a pre-specified stan-
dardized manner. The sampling procedure is designed to yield random samples representative
in terms of age, gender, and education of the German population. A first attempt was made for
4,844 addresses. If not at home, a maximum of three attempts was made to contact the selected
person. All subjects were visited by a study assistant who informed them about the investiga-
tion, obtained written informed consent, and presented them with the questionnaire.

A total sample of 2,576 individuals agreed to participate, of which 63 individuals did not

provide information resulting in a sample of 2,513 individuals (51.9% of the addressed

individuals). Of those, 130 had missing data on one or more SHI items. There were six cases
with missing values on all SHI items. Those cases were removed from the sample leading to a
final sample of 2,507 participants.

Methods

Instruments. All participants provided sociodemographic information and filled-out the
self-rating instruments described below. The Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated based on
the self-reported current weight in kilogram divided by the squared length in meters (kg/m2).
We used a German translation of the SHI that was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Plener from

the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Ulm,
Germany. The translation of the questionnaire was authorized by the authors of the original
version and followed the guidelines for the process of translation of self-reports, including the
use of back-translation.

Impulsiveness was measured using the short form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale [38]
(German version: BIS-15 [39]). The questionnaire contains 15 items that are answered on a
4-point scale ranging from 1 = rarely/never to 4 = almost always/always. Cronbach’s α of the
BIS-15 in the present sample was 0.83, which is very similar to the study of Meule, Vögele and
Kübler [39] who reported a Cronbach’s α of 0.81 in their validation study.

The ultra-brief Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) [40] was
used to assess core symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder. The questionnaire consists of
four items that assess the frequency (ranging from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day) of feel-
ing depressed, loss of interest in doing things, feeling nervous/anxious/on edge and not being
able to stop or control worrying over the past two weeks. Cronbach’s α of the PHQ-4 in the
present sample was 0.84.

Statistical Analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using Mplus 7.3 and IBM SPSS Sta-

tistics version 23, as appropriate. As mentioned above, six cases with missing values on all SHI
items were deleted. The remaining dataset (N = 2,507) was used without imputation. The full infor-
mation maximum likelihood (FIML) method was used to handle missing data in order to estimate
the model parameters and standard errors in all remaining cases (including those with incomplete
SHI data). This method is superior to other methods like pairwise or listwise deletion [41].

Given that previous studies had confirmed a one-factorial structure for the SHI and in order
to test the original structure, the one-factor model was tested in the present sample using confir-
matory factor analysis (CFA). Second, it was investigated whether this structure generalizes to
both gender subsamples. As the SHI responses are dichotomous (Yes or No), a weighted least
squares means and variances adjusted estimation method (WLSMV option, MPLUS 7.3) was
used for estimating all model parameters. Model fit was assessed by multiple criteria: comparative
fit index (CFI) for fit relative to a null model, complemented with the root mean squared error of
approximation (RMSEA) for overall fit. The criteria for good model fit were defined according to
Hu and Bentler [42] as CFI > 0.95 (0.90 is acceptable), and RMSEA > 0.06 (0.09 is acceptable).
The final solution for both gender subsamples was compared to the CFA solution of the total
sample using factor congruence coefficients.

Previous research demonstrated a strong relationship between the SHI and measures of
impulsivity, depression, and anxiety. Therefore, construct validity was determined calculating
correlations between the SHI and the BIS-15 (impulsivity) and the PHQ-4 (depression/anxi-
ety). Because the SHI scores were not normally distributed (i.e. significant Kolmogorov-Smir-
nov test, significant Shapiro-Wilk test) we used two-tailed Spearman rank correlations.

Weight status was classified using the World Health Organization categories of underweight

(BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.50 to 24.99 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25 to

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157928 June 30, 2016

29.99 kg/m2) and obesity grade 1 (BMI 30 to 34.99 kg/m2), grade 2 (BMI 35 to 39.99 kg/m2),
and grade 3 (BMI (cid:1) 40 kg/m2).

Because of the skewed distribution of the SHI total scores we reported the median and the
inter-quartile range (IQR) of the SHI total scores besides the mean and standard deviation. In
line with research that indicates differences in the occurrence of self-harming behaviors in
function of gender, age, years of education, marital status, and weight status, differences in SHI
scores in function of these variables were examined using nonparametric tests (i.e. Kruskal-
Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U tests). Categorical variables were compared by means of the χ2-
test statistic. The significance level for all tests was set at α = 0.05.

differences with respect to age, years of education, and nationality. Women were more often
living without a partner than men. Men had more often a BMI of (cid:1) 25 kg/m2 than women
(61.1% vs. 50.3%, respectively, χ2 = 29.10, p < 0.001).

Factor Structure, reliability, and construct validity of the German SHI

The results of the CFA are listed in Table 2. According to the cut-off values for the fit indices,
the one-factor model showed a reasonable fit in the total sample. Subsequently, the sample was
split into a male (n = 1,115) and a female subgroup (n = 1,392). In both subsamples, a one-fac-
tor model was fitted by means of CFA. For the male sample, items 21 and 22 had to be removed
because they were endorsed by less than 0.04% of the sample, resulting in insufficient variation
in the responses to allow for a reliable estimation of the parameters associated with those
items. For the female sample, all items could be included as in the total sample. The results of
the CFA indicated an acceptable fit for the one-factor model for both, the male and the female
sample separately (Table 2).

Factor congruence coefficients for the one-factor solution for females and for males versus
the total sample were both equal to 0.99, meaning that the pattern of factor loadings was very
similar in the total sample and both gender groups. Table 3 displays the factor loadings for the
one-factor solution in the total sample as well as in the male and female participants. Factor
loadings of item 17 were substantially lower than loadings of any other item, though the
endorsement was high. The total SHI showed acceptable internal consistency (reliability) with
Cronbach’s α coefficients of 0.78 for the total sample, 0.75 for men (same result if items 21 and
22 were excluded), and 0.80 for women.

Table 4 displays the results of the Spearman correlations between the SHI and the BIS-15,
and the PHQ-4 in the total sample, and separately for men and women. As expected, higher
scores on the SHI were moderately related to more impulsiveness (BIS-15) and more symp-
toms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-4).

Prevalence and correlates of self-harming behaviors

Table 5 summarizes the frequencies of self-harming behaviors as measured with the SHI in the
total sample and separately for men and women. Overall, 1,228 participants (49.0% of the total
sample) endorsed at least one SHI item. The behaviors with the highest prevalence rates were
“torturing oneself with self-defeating thoughts” (29.8%), “lost a job on purpose” (24.4%), and
“abused alcohol” (13.60%). Seventy-one individuals (2.8%) acknowledged “suicide attempts”.
Gender. The rate of participants who engaged in at least one SHI behavior was higher
among men than women (51.6% vs. 46.9%, respectively, χ2 = 5.38, p = 0.020). In the same vein,
men exhibited significantly higher SHI total scores than women (meanm = 1.33, SDm = 2.03,
medianm = 1, IQRm = 2 vs. meanw = 1.20, SDw = 2.05, medianw = 0, IQRw = 2; U = 735777.50,

the aforementioned gender differences (see Fig 1). Only among participant younger than 24

higher in male than in female individuals. With regard to total SHI scores, men and women
did not differ significantly across the seven age groups. There was a trend toward higher SHI
total scores in men compared to women in participants between 25 and 34 years (meanm =

We also examined whether there was a gender difference in rates of endorsement for each
of the 22 SHI items separately. As can be seen in Table 5, more men than women endorsed the
items “banged your head”, “abused alcohol”, “lost a job on purpose”, “driven recklessly”, and
“been promiscuous”. In contrast, more women than men admitted “cutting”, “preventing
wounds from healing”, “engaging in emotionally abusive relationships”, “exercising an injury”,
“starving”, and “abusing laxatives”. In addition, more women than men acknowledged “suicide
attempts”.

Although the direction of the aforementioned findings did not differ by age groups, there
were only two items with consistently significant gender differences, regardless of age. These
items were “abused alcohol” and “driven recklessly”, which were more often approved by men
than women within all seven age groups (all p.s < 0.035). Most gender differences (i.e. five out
of 22 SHI items) were found in participants aged between 35 and 44 years. In this age group,
more men than women admitted that they had “abused alcohol”, “driven recklessly”, and “lost
a job on purpose” (all p.s < 0.025), while more women than men indicated “cutting” and “pre-
venting wounds from healing” (all p.s < 0.026). “Banged your head” was more often indicated
by men aged <24 years, between 45 and 54 years, and those between 65 and 74 years (all p.

s < 0.040). The item “been promiscuous” was more often affirmed by men between 25 and 34
years, and in those aged between 45 to 54 years (all p.s < 0.010).

Age. Higher SHI scores were related to lower age in the total sample (r = -0.19, p < 0.01),
as well as in the male (r = -0.15, p < 0.01) and female (r = -0.10, p < 0.01) subsamples. 0 1 indi-
cates a decrease in the number of self-harming behaviors from the younger to the older age
groups in the total sample (Kruskal-Wallis test: χ2 = 48.52, df = 6, p < 0.001). The two oldest
age groups (years: 75 to 74 and 75+) differed significantly from all other age groups (all p.
s < 0.01). Separate overall group comparisons for men (χ2 = 31.06, df = 6, p < 0.001) and
women (χ2 = 22.05, df = 6, p = 0.001) revealed similar results. In the male sample the two oldest
age group scored lower on the SHI than all individuals (cid:3) 54 years (all p.s < 0.05), and in the
female sample lower than all participants (cid:3) 64 years (all p.s < 0.03).

Partnership status and education.

Individuals currently living together with a partner

scored considerably lower on the SHI (n = 1,102; mean = 0.91, SD = 1.56, median = 0, IRQ = 1)
than those without a partner (i.e. living apart, being single, divorced or widowed; n = 1,396;
mean = 1.53, SD = 2.31, median = 1, IQR = 2; U = 646214.50, p < 0.001). Subsequent separate
analyses for men and women revealed similar differences.

Individuals who had completed 12 or more years of education reported higher SHI scores
(n = 517; mean = 1.49, SD = 2.14, median = 1, IQR = 2) than those with less years of education
(n = 1,990; mean = 1.20, SD = 2.01, median = 0, IQR = 2; U = 470116.50, p = 0.001). A compari-
son between men and women indicated a gender effect. Women with 12 or more years of edu-
cation exhibited higher SHI levels (n = 278; mean = 1.47, SD = 2.10, median = 1, IQR = 2) than
women reporting less years of education (n = 1,114; mean = 1.13, SD = 2.04, median = 0,
IQR = 1; U = 137180.00, p = 0.001). In men, no relationship was found between SHI scores and
years of education ((cid:1)12 years: mean = 1.51, SD = 2.19, median = 1, IQR = 2; <12 years:
mean = 1.28, SD = 1.98, median = 1, IQR = 2; U = 99253.00, p = 0.188).

Weight Status. We also explored if the number of participants who endorsed at least one

SHI item was related to weight status. In the total sample, we assessed the following rates of
any self-harm within BMI groups: underweight 40%, normal weight 50%, overweight 46.3%,
obesity grade 1 52.9%, obesity grade 2 60.8%, and obesity grade 3 57.8% (χ2 = 12.96, df = 5,

p = 0.024). Between-group comparisons revealed significant differences between individuals
with obesity grade 2 and those with underweight, normal weight, and overweight (all p.
s (cid:3) 0.038), in that individuals with grade 2 obesity reported significantly higher levels of self-
harm. No significant relationships between SHI and BMI groups were observed for men (χ2 =
7.18, df = 5, p = 0.208) and women (χ2 = 8.13, df = 5, p = 0.149) separately.

Continuous SHI total scores were not related to BMI scores according to bivariate correla-
tions (r = 0.004, p = 0.832). Nonetheless, Fig 2 suggests higher SHI scores in obese participants
(Kruskal-Wallis test: χ2 = 15.28, df = 5, p = 0.009). Pairwise comparisons showed that the obe-
sity grade 2 group exhibited higher SHI scores than all groups with a lower BMI (all p.s < 0.046).
The overweight group had lower SHI scores than the obesity grade 3 group (p = 0.046). No dif-
ferences were found between the other groups. In terms of gender differences, subsequent anal-
yses did not show a significant relationship between BMI groups and SHI scores in the male
(χ2 = 9.86, df = 5, p = 0.079) but in the female sample (χ2 = 11.79, df = 5, p = 0.038) (see Fig 2).
Pairwise group comparisons showed that women from the normal and the overweight group
exhibited significantly less self-harm than women with obesity grade 2 or 3 (all p.s < 0.032).
The remaining groups did not significantly differ from each other.

Discussion

Below we discuss our findings with regard to the factor structure and reliability of the German
SHI, the occurrence of non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm in the present German population
sample, and the sociodemographic and psychopathological correlates of self-harm.

Factor structure and reliability of the German SHI

Overall, the present findings support our hypothesis pertaining to the one-factorial structure of
the German SHI. Testing the fit of the single-factor model proposed by Sansone et al. [1] by
conducting a CFA, the model provided a reasonably acceptable, although not excellent, fit to

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157928 June 30, 2016

Self-Harm in the German Population

the data. Internal consistency coefficients (reliability) of the German version of the SHI for the
total sample, males and females were sufficient and in line with previous data [30, 32, 33, 35].
With regard to the low loadings of item 17 (“Lost a job on purpose”), we may assume that this
item refers to a form of self-harming behavior which is less related to the direct and/or indirect
harm to the body compared to the other SHI items (e.g. like self-cutting, sexual abusive
relationships).

Prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of self-harm

This was the first study that investigated frequencies of self-harming behaviors in the general
German population using the SHI. Almost half of the sample acknowledged at least one self-
harming behavior, most frequently cognitive (“torturing with self-defeating thoughts”), inter-
personal (“losing a job on purpose”), and other forms of indirect (”abused alcohol”) self-harm.
This is partially in line with the findings of Latimer et al. [30]. In their study, “torturing with
self-defeating thoughts” and “abused alcohol” were the most frequently endorsed items. “Lost a
job on purpose” was less often acknowledged, which can be explained by the fact that Latimer
et al. investigated university students who might not have had many chances to lose a job.

Past research indicated higher prevalence rates of NSSI behaviors among women compared

to men [21, 47]. Though, some researchers reported equal prevalence rates among men and
women in non-clinical samples [27]. When considering the total sample, our findings suggest
that men are even more likely to engage in NSSI than women. A more detailed analysis by age
groups, however, suggested that this was only true for two out of seven age groups, particularly
those younger than 34 years. No gender effect was found in older age groups, which is in line
with earlier findings [27] and highlights the occurrence of self-harm in both gender groups.

Consistent with past research concerning gender differences in NSSI [43], we found discrep-

ancies between male and female participants in the methods of self-harm. There were gender
differences in the frequencies of 12 out of 22 self-harming behaviors in the present sample (see
Table 5). With respect to direct self-harm, women were more likely to endorse suicide attempts
and cutting, while men admitted more often head-banging. It is noteworthy that cutting has
been described as a typically female NSSI method in earlier studies investigating gender differ-
ences in psychiatric inpatients [44] and in undergraduate students [45].

In the present sample, women exhibited more often discreet forms of self-harm than men,
e.g. preventing wounds from healing, exercising an injury, starving, and abusing laxatives. In
terms of indirect self-harming behaviors, men admitted more often driving recklessly, being
promiscuous and losing a job on purpose, while women reported more frequently engaging in
emotionally abusive relationships. This gender-related pattern of indirect non-suicidal and sui-
cidal self-harm methods is in line with the study of Claes, Vandereycken and Vertommen [44]
who found that male compared to female patients admitted more often alcohol abuse, driving
recklessly, promiscuity, and losing a job on purpose, while female patients acknowledged more
often starvation and laxative abuse than male patients.

The observed negative correlation between age and self-harm raises the question of whether
self-harm declines with older ages. It is noteworthy that the SHI does not assess the current but
the life-time prevalence of self-harm. Unfortunately, we did not assess the age of onset of self-
harming behaviors and the cross-sectional design prevents any causal interpretation of the neg-
ative association between age and self-harm frequency. Alternative explanations of the negative
correlation between SHI scores and age include reasons such as selective mortality and time
trends in self-harm incidence. It is well known that self-harm constitutes a risk factor for sui-
cide [9]. The lower level of self-harm in older age groups may be explained by the death of a
significant proportion of individuals suffering from self-harm earlier in life, regardless of the

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157928 June 30, 2016

Self-Harm in the German Population

cause of death. With regard to time trends, the underlying assumption is that the occurrence of
self-harm may have increased over the last decades resulting in higher prevalence rates among
younger age groups. In fact, Hawton et al. [46] referred to rising numbers of non-suicidal and
suicidal self-harm patients in Oxford (United Kingdom) between 1985 and 1995, most
markedly in young men, and to changes in the characteristics of self-harm patients between
1990 and 2000 [29]. The same research group examined trends in self-harm incidence in
Oxford between 1996 and 2010 and described an initial increase of self-harm until 2003 and a
subsequent decline [47]. The question of whether aging decreases the occurrence of self-harm
requires further testing using a longitudinal study design.

With regard to education, our results pertaining to male participants support the findings of

others [22, 47] who did not find an association between non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm
and education history. Though, at least in the present sample women with more years of educa-
tion reported more self-harming behaviors. The latter finding can be connected with findings
from a previous study in a representative British community sample [48]. This study suggested
an increase in the prevalence of borderline personality disorder symptoms in higher social clas-
ses that might imply a link between self-harm and higher educational level [49].

In line with previous studies concerning correlates of borderline personality disorder [50,
51], participants currently living with a partner exhibited less self-harm than those being single,
living apart, being divorced, or widowed. This result leads to the question if marital status con-
stitutes a protective factor against self-harm or if self-harm prevents successful partnership.
Due to the cross-sectional design and the lack of information about the characteristics and
quality of existing partnerships we are not able to draw causal conclusions.

Self-harm and associated psychopathology

The present study replicated the positive association between the level of non-suicidal and sui-
cidal self-harm and symptoms of anxiety and depression as suggested by many other authors
[7, 13, 17–19, 22, 30, 32], and the positive association between the level of non-suicidal and sui-
cidal self-harm and impulsivity [18–20]. These findings confirm the good construct validity of
the German SHI. The correlations between the SHI and the PHQ-4 (anxiety/depression), and
the BIS-15 (impulsivity) were not strong but moderate, which may be explained by the use of a
community sample. One may assume that the correlations would have been stronger in a clini-
cal sample with higher level of general psychopathology.

Another interesting outcome is the link between obesity and increased levels of self-harm,
especially among female participants. Sansone, Wiederman, Schurmacher, and Routsong-Wei-
chers [26] investigated non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm in 121 morbidly obese bariatric sur-
gery candidates and found a relatively high rate of self-harm (53.7%) in this population,
without gender differences. In the present community sample, we found similarly high rates of
self-harm among obese participants ranging from 52.9% to 60.8%. At present, the literature
concerning self-harm in morbid obesity is still sparse. The growing research indicating elevated
risk of suicide after bariatric surgery [52, 53] and the fact that recurrent self-harm is associated
with increased risk for suicide attempts [9] underscores the need for future studies investigat-
ing the association between obesity and self-harming behaviors in more detail.

Strengths and limitations

The replication of the one-factorial structure facilitates the comparison of German SHI data
with studies that utilized the original SHI version. Another strength of the present study is the
use of a large representative population sample and the availability of sociodemographic data
and information about clinical symptoms and weight status. To date, this is the first study that

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157928 June 30, 2016

13 / 17

Self-Harm in the German Population

examined a broad range of self-harming behaviors in the adult German population; however,
not making a differentiation between the non-suicidal or suicidal intent of the behaviour. The
present findings add to an overall body of evidence demonstrating that self-harm is a signifi-
cant public health problem.

Several limitations are important to note. Although the one-factor structure was consistent

with the original SHI, other factor structures were not examined. The cross-sectional design
prevents causal conclusions about the relationships between variables. Future longitudinal
studies are needed to examine the natural course of self-harm in nonclinical samples and its
correlates. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the rates of self-harming behaviors were dis-
torted by social desirability bias, which is another shortcoming. Additionally, it is possible that
the correlations between variables are increased due to shared method variants (all self-
reports); so future studies should include interviews or performance-based measures (besides
self-report measures) of the variables under study.

Conclusions

The German version of the SHI represents a brief, useful measure to assess a broad variety of
concrete self-harming behaviors in clinical practice as well as in empirical studies. By using this
instrument, the rate of those who exhibited at least one self-harming behavior over the life-
span was relatively high (49%) in the present representative German sample. This finding sug-
gests that self-harm constitutes a common problem. Future longitudinal studies are required to
examine the natural course, sociodemographic and psychopathological risk factors, as well as
possible time-trends of self-harming behaviors in more depth.
