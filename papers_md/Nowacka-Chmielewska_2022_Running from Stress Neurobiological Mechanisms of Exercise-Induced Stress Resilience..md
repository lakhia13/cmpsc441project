Abstract: Chronic stress, even stress of a moderate intensity related to daily life, is widely acknowl-
edged to be a predisposing or precipitating factor in neuropsychiatric diseases. There is a clear
relationship between disturbances induced by stressful stimuli, especially long-lasting stimuli, and
cognitive deﬁcits in rodent models of affective disorders. Regular physical activity has a positive
effect on the central nervous system (CNS) functions, contributes to an improvement in mood and
of cognitive abilities (including memory and learning), and is correlated with an increase in the
expression of the neurotrophic factors and markers of synaptic plasticity as well as a reduction
in the inﬂammatory factors. Studies published so far show that the energy challenge caused by
physical exercise can affect the CNS by improving cellular bioenergetics, stimulating the processes
responsible for the removal of damaged organelles and molecules, and attenuating inﬂammation
processes. Regular physical activity brings another important beneﬁt: increased stress robustness.
The evidence from animal studies is that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with stress vulnerability,
whereas a physically active lifestyle is associated with stress resilience. Here, we have performed a
comprehensive PubMed Search Strategy for accomplishing an exhaustive literature review. In this
review, we discuss the ﬁndings from experimental studies on the molecular and neurobiological
mechanisms underlying the impact of exercise on brain resilience. A thorough understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective potential of preconditioning exercise and of the role of
exercise in stress resilience, among other things, may open further options for prevention and therapy
in the treatment of CNS diseases.

Stress is a well-characterized factor causing changes in the brain function and structure
by, for example, modifying the neurochemical and neuroendocrine processes, and causing
physiological alterations [1]. Long-term stress impairs the function of negative feedback
loops within the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis so that they no longer serve
their purpose. It may cause the increased secretion of both the corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone (CRH) and glucocorticosteroids (GCs) [2]. Cortisol/corticosterone (CORT), acting via
steroid receptors, inhibits the production and secretion of hormones in brain structures [3].
In particular, glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are ex-
pressed at high levels in the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and other limbic
and midbrain structures, where they modulate the neural circuitry and neuroendocrine
systems that underlie the behavioural responses to stress [4]. The stress-induced synthesis

of GCs [5] causes the sustained hyperactivity of neurons, leading to excitotoxicity and the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [6,7]. A long-term exposure to social stress
affects the levels of monoamine in the limbic regions, which are known to be particularly
sensitive to stress [4]. Following stress, decreased levels of dopamine (DA) in the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), increased norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) in the den-
tate gyrus, and decreased NE in the dorsal raphe, have been observed [8,9]. In addition,
stress exposure disrupts neuronal plasticity as a result of suppressed neurogenesis, cell
atrophy, or enhanced apoptosis [10]. In humans, chronic stress is recognized as a major
risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression [11,12]. In-
terestingly, most individuals do not develop such disorders after experiencing stressful
life events and are thus thought to be resilient. In this context, stress resilience is deﬁned
as an active, adaptive process, which allows the individual to cope successfully with
acute stress, trauma, or chronic adversity [13]. As with humans, in laboratory animals
there is a clear relationship between the disturbances induced by stressful stimuli, espe-
cially long-lasting stimuli, and cognitive deﬁcits [14]. In numerous studies, it has been
demonstrated that chronic stress leads to the development of depression- or anxiety-like
behaviours [15–18]. However, the remaining stressed animals, those considered “resilient”,
exhibit some physiological symptoms without deleterious behavioural changes. Resilient
animals do not exhibit social avoidance, anhedonia-like symptoms (for example reduced
sucrose consumption), or metabolic disturbances deﬁned by over-eating, a preference for
high-fat food, obesity, and obesity-associated changes (e.g., central leptin resistance) [19]. It
should be noted that stress-resistant individuals are characterized by a high sympathetic
system activity, a low parasympathetic system activity (for example, high heart rates), as
well as a low production of glucocorticoids in response to stress [20,21], a high resistance
to mental illness [22], and a high motor activity (active exploratory reactions, aggression,
etc.). Additionally, mice with a high baseline physical activity (high voluntary activity in
“running wheels”) demonstrated a resistance to chronic social stress compared to animals
neglecting exercises [23,24].

Both preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that moderate-intensity exercise is
beneﬁcial during a lifetime because it promotes a variety of physiological adaptations that
reduce the anxiety response [25,26]. Chronic and regular physical activity has a positive
effect on the central nervous system (CNS) functions, contributes to the improvement of
one’s mood and cognitive abilities (including memory and learning) [27,28], and corre-
lates with an increase in the expression of neurotrophic factors and markers of synaptic
plasticity [29], as well as a reduction in the inﬂammatory factors [30]. Studies published
so far show that the energy challenge caused by physical exercise can affect the CNS by
improving cellular bioenergetics, stimulating the processes responsible for the removal of
damaged organelles and molecules, and attenuating the inﬂammation processes reviewed
in [31]. In addition to the well-documented neural mechanism for exercise, the facilitation
of synaptogenesis and stabilization of newly formed synapses were found in the cortical
region after chronic treadmill exercise [32,33]. Finally, regular physical activity brings
another important beneﬁt: increased stress robustness. The evidence from human and
animal studies suggests that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with stress vulnerability,
whereas a physically active lifestyle is associated with stress robustness [34,35], which is
deﬁned as a state of both stress resistance and stress resilience.

Revealing the mechanisms involved in the beneﬁcial effect of physical activity/exercise
on stress resilience could contribute to an understanding of how it can induce positive
physiological improvements, protect against the effects of stressful events, and prevent or
minimize several CNS diseases. In this context, this review will consider the following
question: what molecular mechanisms/signalling pathways related to physical activity can
contribute to stress resilience, and can physical exercise contribute to the resilience of the
brain to stress in some neurological disorders? Here, we discuss the ﬁndings only from ani-
mal experiments and studies of the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying
the preventive effect of exercise on stress. Even though exercise might act as a stressor, it

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13348

has been widely demonstrated that it reduces the deleterious effects of harmful stressors.
For clariﬁcation, we focus on the neuroprotective potential of exercise as a preconditioning
to a further exposure to a variety of stressors, considering the molecular targets involved in
exercise-induced neuroprotection: increased neurogenesis, the expression of neurotrophic
factors, the modulation of neurotransmission and HPA activity, the reduction in cerebral
inﬂammation and oxidative stress, and improved cognition [36,37].

2. Literature Search Strategy

A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted to identify studies investigating
the role of exercise in stress resilience and the possible molecular mechanisms underlying
exercise-induced stress resilience. The literature search was conducted between July and
August 2022. The results were sorted by date and included all papers from 2010 to 2022.
For further information, older publications were also included. Original (experimental and
clinical) studies, letters, and reviews, written in English, were included.

Studies that did not address physical activity/exercise for stress resilience were ex-
cluded. The following terminology was applied: (physical activity AND stress resilience),
(“exercise” OR “physical activity”) AND (“stress-resistant” OR “stress-resilience” OR
“brain resilience”) AND (“psychiatric disorders” OR “depression” OR “anxiety” OR “brain
diseases”), (“exercise prior to stress” AND “brain”). While reviewing the literature, special
attention was paid to the frequently interchangeable terms of exercise and physical activity.
It is worth noting that physical activity should be deﬁned as any bodily movement pro-
duced by the skeletal muscles which results in an energy expenditure, while exercising is a
physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful.

3. Results

A PubMed database search revealed 935 potentially relevant articles; 252 studies
concerned physical activity or exercise and stress resilience. Most records were excluded
because they did not address physical activity or exercise or the stress resilience outcome.
Of the 252 articles, 156 studies referred to clinical research, 68 studies addressed pre-clinical
research, and 28 were reviews. Of the 68 studies, conducted on mice or rats, 36 were not
eligible, resulting in 30 articles that involved exercise prior to stress and focused on the
brain molecular targets of stress resilience (Figure 1, ﬂow chart).

All of these aspects are affected by exercise. Physical exercise has been proposed as an effective and low-cost therapy to prevent CNS disorders, especially those related to long-lasting stress. Previous studies have mainly focused on the therapeutic effects of exercise on stress-induced CNS disorders, while only a few have described exercise as a precondi-tioning for a subsequent exposure to stress. Recently, exercise has been associated with cognitive improvement and stress resilience [13,39–41], but the underlying neurobiology remains unclear. In this review, attention is focused on animal models, since these have played a crucial role in searching for and identifying the neural mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resilience.

4. Discussion

As a result of the high prevalence of stress-related psychiatric disorders, including
major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety, and the limited efﬁ-
ciency of current pharmacological treatments, there is a need to identify novel therapeutic
strategies. It has been suggested that mechanisms involving a decrease in neurogene-
sis, changes in the neurotransmitter levels, the modulation of neuroinﬂammation, brain
plasticity, and glutamate imbalance contribute to the stress-related disorders reviewed
in [38]. All of these aspects are affected by exercise. Physical exercise has been proposed
as an effective and low-cost therapy to prevent CNS disorders, especially those related
to long-lasting stress. Previous studies have mainly focused on the therapeutic effects of
exercise on stress-induced CNS disorders, while only a few have described exercise as
a preconditioning for a subsequent exposure to stress. Recently, exercise has been asso-
ciated with cognitive improvement and stress resilience [13,39–41], but the underlying
neurobiology remains unclear. In this review, attention is focused on animal models, since
these have played a crucial role in searching for and identifying the neural mechanisms
underlying exercise-induced stress resilience. Tables 1–6 sets out a summary of animal
studies regarding the stress resilience induced by physical exercise and studies utilizing
the exercise paradigm (voluntary wheel running, treadmill, or swimming exercise) before
stress. For more details please see Supplementary Materials (Table S1).

4.1. Neurogenesis, Neuroplasticity, and Cognition

The hippocampus is a very well-studied brain structure because of its structural plastic-
ity and vulnerability to a wide range of experiences [42–44]. It is well known that exogenous
corticosterone or stress induces dendritic atrophy in the apical dendrites of the CA3 regions
and has a minor effect on the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus [45].
Stress or hypercortisolism suppresses the hippocampal excitability and long-term potentia-
tion, which is always associated with an impaired hippocampus-dependent memory [46].
Changes in neuroplasticity following social adversities are strongly related to the individual
vulnerability to stressful stimuli [9]. Repeated exercise improves the cognitive functions,
spatial learning and memory, and also reverses stress-induced changes in the behavioural
parameters reviewed in [47]. The beneﬁcial impact of exercise is probably regulated by
hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, physical exercise is one of the strongest positive
physiological modulators of the hippocampal structure and function [48]. Therefore, it is
not surprising that both forced (treadmill) and non-forced spontaneous (activity wheel)
physical exercise increased hippocampal neurogenesis and cell proliferation [49,50]. For
example, voluntary exercise increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the rostral hip-
pocampus of eight-month-old female mice and also stimulated neurogenesis in adult mice
subjected to early life stress, affecting the postmitotic DCX-positive cells [51]. Finally, exer-
cise minimized, or even reversed, the stress-induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis,
which correlated with improved cognitive functions in aged mice [52] and humans [53].
Treadmill exercise following or at the same time as an exposure to the social stressors
induced by social defeat [54] or a PTSD model [55,56] resulted in the prevention of anxiety-
and depression-like behaviour. Here, it is noteworthy that, as a result of a review by
Holmes (2014) [57], the anxiolytic effects of exercise in rodents are most consistent when
the subjects have previously been exposed to a stressor, thus distinguishing the preventive
and the therapeutic effects of exercise.

In a recent study by Sun et al. (2021) [58], swimming exercise reduced the vulnerability
of mice to CUMS (chronic unpredictable mild stress) and contributed to the AKT/GSK-
3β/CRMP2 pathway and microtubule dynamics (assessed by measurement of Tyr-tubulin
expression in the hippocampus) mediated protective effects on neuroplasticity. Five weeks
of swimming exercise also prevented mice from engaging in the depression-like behaviour
induced by CUMS. The authors concluded that exercise contributes to stress resilience via
the AKT/GSK-3β/CRMP2 pathway and by maintaining microtubule dynamics [58]. On the
other hand, six weeks of endurance exercise provided stress resilience to the morphological

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13348

changes (dendritic length, dendrite spine density) induced by a later exposure to PSS
(predator scent stress). Animals who had exercised before stress showed an increase in
resilience of the cytoarchitecture of the neurons in the dentate gyrus subregion of the
hippocampus [59]. Another possible mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of exercise
prior to stress in regard to the hippocampal region was shown by Kim et al.
(2011).
These authors showed a protective effect of eight weeks of preconditioning exercise on
hippocampal neuronal death induced by an exposure to repeated restraint stress and the
i.c.v.
injection of kainic acid. Prior chronic treadmill running suppressed kainic acid-
induced hippocampal neuronal death, assessed by the number of Nissl-positive neuronal
cells in the hippocampal CA3 region of the stressed mice. These results were accompanied
by lower ROS levels (lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels), and enhanced
levels of pCREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), which were mediated by
ERK1/2 and CaMKII [60]. Among the molecules regulated by the neuronal cells to cope
with stressful stimuli, CREB is known to play a crucial role in neuronal survival [61].
It could be suggested that the activation of pro-survival pathways is involved in the
phenomena of stress resilience (Table 1). Taken together, the data presented above support
the hypothesis that chronic and regular exercise has neuroprotective properties in regard to
neurodegenerative disorders.

4.2. Neurotransmitter Systems

One of the proposed mechanisms for the different responses to stress among individu-
als may be related to differences in the baseline physical activity. The involvement of the
dopamine (DA) system has been proposed as one of the possible mechanisms. Growing
evidence suggests that stress causes changes in the brain areas associated with a reward,
and the dysfunction of mesolimbic DA neurons has a negative impact on the behavioural
responses to social stress [62,63]. Voluntary wheel running as a natural reward for rodents
may be associated with the DA system [64,65].

In a recent study by Zhang et al. (2021), the authors divided wild-type mice into
those with a low and those with a high baseline physical activity, based on the results from
three days of voluntary wheel running. The mice with a high baseline physical activity
displayed a greater resilience to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), showing a higher
expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and more TH-positive neurons in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) than the mice with a low baseline physical activity. Furthermore,
the activation of the TH neurons in the VTA of mice with a low physical activity by the
DREADD method increased their physical activity and resilience to stress. The opposite

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13348

6 of 20

effects, namely a reduced level of wheel running and increased susceptibility to stress, were
observed after the inhibition of the TH neurons in the VTA of mice with a high physical
activity. The authors concluded that the dopamine system may affect the resilience to CSDS,
possibly via an alteration of the baseline physical activity [23] (Table 2). Similarly, rats
with a low adaptive response to treadmill exercise showed structural anomalies in their
noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC). Furthermore, rats with a high adaptation to exercise
showed higher levels of serum ACTH, increased pERK activation in response to two
hours of physical restraint stress, and diminished processing of fear-associated memories
compared to the rats selectively bred for a low adaptation [24]. In a study by Mul et al.
(2018) that used a molecular and viral gene transfer approach, it was demonstrated that
the sustained inhibition of ∆FosB in the NAc (nucleus accumbens) of mice is likely to
be a contributor to greater stress resilience. The authors demonstrated that 42 days of
voluntary wheel running induced ∆FosB in the subregions of the NAc and ameliorated
stress-induced social avoidance behaviour and anhedonia [66]. The chronic induction of
∆FosB in the NAc, which is a crucial reward-related brain area, is strongly associated with
neuronal adaptations to drugs of abuse and stress [67]. In previous studies, wheel running
for several weeks has been shown to result in an increase in ∆FosB in the NAc in both
rats [61] and mice [68]. Rats housed in an enriched environment with running wheels
recovered much faster from the inescapable footshock (IFS) paradigm, which is a model
of PTSD, than animals housed under standard conditions. Moreover, this behavioural
recovery was correlated with an increased cell proliferation in the hippocampus, a decrease
in the tissue levels of noradrenaline, and the increased turnover of 5-HT in the prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus [69]. In female rats, six weeks of voluntary wheel running before
uncontrollable tail-shock stress buffered against the behavioural changes—avoidance and
exaggerated fear—produced by stress [70]. Tanner et al. (2019) have suggested a role for
the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in mechanisms underlying the observed stress resilience
induced by wheel running in female rats. This suggestion is based on the results from
studies by Greenwood et al.
(2003) in which wheel running exercise constrained the
activation of DRN 5-HT neurons during stress in male rats [71]. Additionally, six weeks of
wheel running lessens the stress-induced 5-HT neural activity, assessed by c-Fos protein
expression in the DRN and lateral ventral region of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
(BNST), which probably contributes to the exercise-induced prevention of the behavioural
consequences of uncontrollable stress [72]. Recently, in a mice model of chronic stress,
the GABA receptors within the habenula and a subregion of the mPFC were shown to
play an important role in stress resilience and vulnerability [73,74]. Another possible
mechanism underlying stress resilience involves GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus.
Chowdhury et al. (2019), using electrophysiological techniques, showed that exercise
promotes resilience to food-restriction stress by enhancing the GABAergic inhibition of
pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus of female rats [75].

4.3. Neurotrophic Factors

The neurotrophic factors are a group of proteins possessing similar structures that are
synthesized in peripheral tissues innervated by sensory and sympathetic neurons and in
the neurons of some brain structures [76]. Neurotrophins diminish neuronal degeneration
and induce and enhance synaptic plasticity [77]. Among the members of the neurotrophin
family, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most intensively studied.
BDNF expression is sensitive to stress. Findings from previous studies have shown that
both acute and chronic stress decrease the BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus. Recent
ﬁndings suggest that the neural plasticity supported by the trophic mechanisms is vital
for establishing and maintaining stress resilience [78,79]. However, behaviourally resilient
rodents do not necessarily show a higher basal BDNF expression [80–82].

Many studies have shown the magnitude of the exercise-induced expression of trophic
factors in the brain and periphery, such as the BDNF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the inﬂammatory protein VGF. However,
most of these studies focused on BDNF signalling in the hippocampus [83–87]. It is widely
reported that voluntary running results in an increase in the BDNF expression in the hip-
pocampus, cerebral cortex, and other areas of the brain [88], as well as the protein level of
BDNF in the sera of physically active humans [89–91]. In previous studies, it has been estab-
lished that a long-term exposure to exercise reverses chronic stress-induced memory deﬁcits
via the BDNF induction [92], and molecular mechanisms regulating this plasticity may
include the SIRT1/microRNA, CREB/BDNF, and AKT/GSK-3β signalling pathways [93].
Physical exercise and stress have been shown to modulate, in a different manner, the
brain expression of BDNF transcripts by possibly different epigenetic mechanisms [94].
In particular, the BDNF transcripts expression induced by exercise was associated with
increased levels of H3Ac, while no post-translational histone modiﬁcations induced by
two-hour restraint stress were found (Table 3).

Rats subjected to six weeks of endurance training before acute stress developed a stress
resilience and reﬂected reduced anxiety and reduced ASR (Acute Startle Response), which
corresponded with the increased expression of BDNF, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and phospho-
delta opioid receptor (DOR) signalling in the hippocampus. It might be suggested that an
increase in the BDNF, NPY, and DOR enhances the synaptic plasticity, leading to stress
resilience [95]. In a recent study, it was proposed that the BDNF/TRKB pathway is involved
in the enhancement of resilience by voluntary exercise. Voluntary exercise promotes
resilience to stress, through the exercise-regulated PGC1a/FNDC5 pathway known to
induce hippocampal BDNF signalling. Exercise increases the levels of the transcriptional
coactivator PGC1a, which in turn activates the expression of FNDC5. FNDC5 is a protein
that is processed and secreted, and that induces BDNF/TRKB activation. The results
obtained suggest that exercise may mediate stress resilience by engaging the BDNF/TRKB
signalling pathway [96].

Wheel running both before and concurrently with CORT administration in rats pre-
vented the depressive phenotype and reductions in neurogenesis that normally accompany
a high-dose CORT administration [97]. In the hippocampi of these animals, an increase in

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13348

8 of 20

the hippocampal levels of synaptophysin and PSD-95 protein levels, but no changes in the
levels of BDNF or IGF-1, was observed. The results presented above suggest that exercise
can promote stress resilience by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis and increasing the
synaptic protein levels, thereby reducing the deleterious effects of stress. Furthermore, in
the study by Munive et al. (2015), treadmill running for two weeks enhanced the resilience
to stress in female mice only. Authors have postulated that exercise modulates mood in both
sexes acting through different mechanisms addressing distinct components of mood. Addi-
tionally, exercise increased the hippocampal levels of IGF-1 only in cycling females. IGF-1
was proposed as a factor probably involved in the mechanism underlying the observed
differences in sex incidence of mood disorders [98,99]. The BDNF is a known cAMP target
gene involved in stress-related disorders. Adenylyl cyclase (ADCY) and cAMP regulate
synaptic plasticity, which may be involved in coping with stress [100]. In a recent study by
Yang et al. (2020), the overexpression of Adcy1 prevented the two-hour restraint-induced
down-regulation of BDNF and NPY. This overexpression caused the concurrent elevation
of the basal CORT level and behavioural resilience to stress, which suggests that Adcy1
may play a role in stress resilience [101]. Finally, a very recent study provided results that
strongly support previous reports that prior exercise can prevent the harmful effects of
exposure to stress through, among other routes, the BDNF modulation. In a rat model
of PTSD, four weeks of treadmill exercise protocol ameliorated stress-induced enhanced
anxiety levels, serum CORT, the BDNF protein level in the hippocampus and serum, and
apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase 3) as compared to the sedentary rats [102].

4.4. Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal Axis Activity

Physical exercise alters the action of the HPA axis [103], and the response of the HPA
axis to both acute and chronic stress is changed in exercised rodents [104,105]. The HPA
activity may differ depending on the exercise model (voluntary versus forced) and the dura-
tion (short-term or long-term) [104,106,107]. The results from the experimental studies are
inconsistent, depending on the stress stimuli (acute vs. chronic), when HPA axis-mediated
responses are studied. While some reports identify behavioural and biochemical changes
in response to acute stress with prior exercise, limited studies are available regarding the

effects of long-term stress on the HPA responses in exercise rodents (Table 4). In one study
utilizing the rat model of PTSD (one week of social defeat), which involves aggressive
encounters between the resident and intruder, prior treadmill exercise was found to be
protective against depressive and anxiety-like behaviour. Two weeks of moderate tread-
mill exercise provided a resilience to following stressful stimuli by modulating the CORT
levels [108]. Campenau et al. (2010) presented data showing that six weeks of voluntary
wheel running in rats decreased the HPA response (assessed by plasma levels of ACTH and
CORT) to low-intensity stressors such as an exposure to a novel environment accompanied
by a central mechanism. In particular, exercise resulted in a lower c-fos mRNA expression
following stress in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus [104]. Relatively few
studies have reported that exercise enhances the HPA axis response to subsequent acute
restraint stress. Four weeks of voluntary wheel running reduced anxiety-like behaviour,
which was associated with a more rapid CORT response and CORT decay to acute re-
straint stress, increased adrenal gland size, and elevated sensitivity to ACTH [109]. These
observations suggest that exercise may promote stress resilience partly by the different
responses of HPA to a stressor, thus affecting the overall exposure to the possible negative
effects of a more sustained activation of the HPA axis. Similarly, voluntary running for
three weeks before the two-hour immobilization of stress resulted in increased CORT levels
both immediately after and ten hours after the cessation of the stressor. Authors have
suggested that CORT mediates stress-induced decreases in the BDNF but is not a primary
mediator for exercise-related increases in the BDNF levels [5]. Further, treadmill exercise
for two weeks modulates the acute stress-induced release of ACTH and has a noradrenergic
effect in the brain areas of female rats. It has been suggested that two weeks of exercise
protects against the stress-induced NE decrease in the amygdala, hippocampus, and LC of
rats [110]. Another positive impact of exercise in regard to stress resilience was connected
with an increase in the hippocampal expression of Nr3c1, which was correlated with a
down-regulation of miR-124, an epigenetic regulator of Nr3c1 [111].

Sasse et al. (2013) showed changes in the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and
BDNF systems in several brain regions that were associated with a habituation to repeated
noise stress in prior exercised rats [112]. On the other hand, rats exposed to chronic
isolation plus swimming exercise were shown to have fewer deleterious effects induced
by social isolation stress on the limbic-HPA axis, as assessed by the brain levels of GR and
Hsp70 [113]. Furthermore, heat shock proteins (HSPs), induced by a variety of stressors,
have been implicated in stress resilience. Prior voluntary running facilitates the inescapable
tail-shock stress-induced HSP72 induction in the rat brain regions [114]. A greater and
faster increase in HSP72 after stress in the exercised rats may contribute to exercise-induced
stress resilience at the cellular level.

4.5. Oxidative Stress

Exercise protects against chronic stress-induced deleterious effects, namely an increase
in oxidative stress markers. The induction of oxidative stress is associated with anxiety-
like behaviour in rats. Namely, acute sleep deprivation increases the oxidative stress in
the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, while a prior treadmill exercise prevents this
increase [115] (Table 5). The authors of this study proposed that the brain expression of
enzymes involved in the oxidative stress pathway, glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) and glutathione
reductase-1 (GSR1), are associated with anxiety-like behaviours. Moreover, the reported
prevention of anxiety-like behaviour observed in exercised rats might be mediated via
oxidative mechanisms [116]. Another anti-oxidative potential of preconditioning exercise
arose from the study by Gerecke et al. (2013). In this study, restraint stress caused the
up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax protein in the mouse cortex, but not the hippocampus.
Voluntary wheel running alone resulted in a decreased Bax level in comparison to stressed
sedentary animals, and also Cox-2 expression in the hippocampus in relation to the control
and stressed sedentary mice. Moreover, exercise protected against an increase in the number
of hippocampal Iba1/Cox-2 positive cells [116]. Treadmill exercise introduced before
chronic variable stress (CVS) improves aversive memory and oxidative status changes in
the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus
of rats. The results obtained suggest that physical activity applied in developmental life
stages ameliorates the brain resilience to stress later in life [117].

4.6. Galanin System in Locus Coeruleus

Galanin, widely distributed in the brain, modulates stress, mood, cognition, food
intake, nociception, and seizures [118]. This neuropeptide is synthesized in noradrenergic
LC, which is a region activated by stress, and NE release plays a crucial role in the stress
response [119]. Chronic clomipramine treatment resulted in an increase in galanin expres-
sion in the LC in a similar way to exercise [120]. The exercise and galanin treatment each
prevented anxiety-like behaviour after stress [121]. Moreover, mice with a knockout for
the galanin receptor (GalR2) showed anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, suggesting
GalR2 may be involved in the antidepressant-like effects of galanin and may be a valid
drug target for depressive disorders [122]. Moreover, the activation of GalR2 mediates a
variety of actions related to neurite dynamics and the mechanisms for protection against
the dendritic spine atrophy induced by stress [123,124]. The maintenance of the dendritic
spine in some stress-vulnerable brain regions has been suggested as a cellular mechanism
for brain resilience [125,126]. In rats, three weeks of wheel running increased the galanin
levels in the LC, and this was associated with behavioural resilience as a result of exer-
cise [127,128]. Recently, Tillage et al. (2020) have demonstrated ﬁndings that support the
important role of exercise and galanin in stress resilience (Table 6). These authors have
shown that the overexpression of galanin in noradrenergic neurons in mice ameliorates
stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour [129].

4.7. RNA Methylation

The epitranscriptome refers to the dynamic and reversible chemical post-transcriptional
modiﬁcation of RNA. The most abundant internal RNA modiﬁcation is the generation of
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which occurs in a region-speciﬁc manner within the brain,
reviewed in [130]. In the CNS, the m6A signalling is involved in several physiological pro-
cesses [131], neurodevelopment [132–134], cognitive functions [135], and stress response,
reviewed in [136]. In mice, restraint stress leads to global methylation changes in the PFC
and amygdala. Moreover, the deﬁciency of Mettl3 and Fto indicates the role of m6A/m
regulatory genes in stress resilience [137]. m6A-mRNA methylation in the VTA increases
in response to CUMS in comparison to unstressed animals [138]. Yan et al. (2022) showed
that treadmill exercise in RNA m6A homeostasis in the PFC plays a role by improving the
resilience against CRS for one hour for 14 days [139]. RNA methylation in mPFC neurons

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13348

12 of 20

depends on methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) liver biosynthesis. CRS suppresses
the cortical and circulating SAM levels, and physical activity potentiates the liver synthesis.
The results indicate that Map1a (methionine adenosyltransferase 1A) hepatic expression is
essential for this protective effect of physical activity against the CRS. In summary, treadmill
exercise maintains epitranscriptome homeostasis, affecting neural activity and reducing
anxiety-like behaviour via the liver–brain pathway as a mechanism of stress resilience [140].

5. Limitation of the Study

It should be noted that there are some discrepancies in this review study compilation.
First, there are various forms of physical exercise, such as running and swimming, and
these differ in duration and intensity. Additionally, the motivation of animals to engage
in physical activity (voluntary or forced) has an impact on their response to stress. Even
though forced treadmill running induces a stress response, manifested as increased CORT
levels and anxiety-like behaviour, the role of physical activity in stress resilience is un-
doubted. Second, in the same way as animal physical activity models, stress response
depends on the type and duration of the introduced stimuli. Therefore, the changes induced
by different stress models may also be contradictory.

Based on the literature, it might be suggested that physical activity does affect stress re-
silience, but the initial phenotype (stress-resistant or more susceptible) has a great impact on
the response to stress and this phenotype might inﬂuence the direction of changes induced
by physical activity. In support of this, voluntary wheel running prior to chronic stress
increased the proportion of resilient mice [66,96]. On the other hand, the initial exercise sen-
sitivity of animals (related to a low and high adaptive response to exercise) should be taken
into account since it is known that the acquired exercise capacity plays a role in regulating
the response to stress [65]. Therefore, it appears quite straightforward that the increased
physical activity of individuals with a stress-resistant phenotype may prevent them from
developing psychopathology. More importantly, on the basis of reviewed publications,
we may postulate that neurobiological mechanisms of exercise-induced brain resilience
are diverse and complex and need to be further explored. However, we can summarize
that physical activity may promote the development of a stress-resilient phenotype. The
proposed mechanisms which involve how exercise can promote the development of the
stress-resilient phenotype brain resilience are presented in Figure 2.

Finally, the studies mentioned were conducted on both mice and rats of different ages.
Moreover, the underrepresentation of female animal research possibly contributes to a
divergence in explaining brain resilience to stress among genders. Numerous studies may
relate to the question of whether the behavioural paradigm measures acute stress reactivity
or the continuation of the brain coping with stress. Anxiety- and depression-like behaviours
are also taken into consideration as determinants of stress resilience in the above literature.
Therefore, these limitations should be considered in future studies.

6. Conclusions and Future Directions

The ability to cope with stress is crucial for maintaining appropriate behavioural adap-
tation and for mental health. Factors that promote resilience to stress may be important for
treatment strategies for CNS disorders such as anxiety and depression. As summarized
above, a number of animal studies have shown that regular exercise can reduce or prevent
stress-induced behavioural, biochemical, and molecular abnormalities. Exercise can signiﬁ-
cantly alter the CNS expression pattern of several genes and pathways strongly related to
vulnerability to stress, and various molecules have been already identiﬁed.

A full understanding of the neurobiological adaptations during exercise is critical
in order to develop the rational and optimal treatment of many disorders and has the
translational beneﬁt of gaining an understanding of the contribution of physical exer-
cise to stress resilience in the general population, but it may have a special importance
in numerous psychiatric as well as neurological conditions. These include numerous
mental [141,142], neurodegenerative, and other disorders [143], many of them related to
aging [144]. Particular emphasis should be paid to the long-term effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. Maintaining good levels of physical activity during lockdown was a protective
factor against developing stress-related symptoms in older people [145–147]. Some studies
on human subjects and clinical observations conﬁrm the importance of physical activity and
exercise in attenuating neurobehavioral disturbances [148–150]. This deserves a separate
analysis of the current status of scientiﬁc investigations. The role of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) in these processes should receive more attention in the future. The BBB is formed by
tightly connected endothelial cells, which together with pericytes and astrocytes, regulate
the exchange of nutrients and systemic factors between the brain and the periphery, re-
viewed in [151]. As shown in recent studies, the BBB and its neuroprotective role is altered
in many neurological disorders and in response to stress and physical activity [152–154].
Molecules involved in stress-related disorders and in response to physical activity, such as
glutamate, cAMP, glucocorticoids, oestrogen, and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, can alter
the expression of the prominent BBB tight junction protein claudin-5 either by direct or
indirect mechanisms, resulting in a change in the BBB permeability with direct effects on
the neuronal function, reviewed in [152]. Claudin-5 as a direct oestrogen target [155–157]
is one of the proteins which mediates sex differences in neurological disorders such as
depression and anxiety [158,159]. Additional molecular targets involved in the cellular
responses to physical activity and different types of stress and stress resilience need to
be identiﬁed.

On the other hand, the initial ex-ercise sensitivity of animals (related to a low and high adaptive response to exercise) should be taken into account since it is known that the acquired exercise capacity plays a role in regulating the response to stress [65]. Therefore, it appears quite straightforward that the increased physical activity of individuals with a stress-resistant phenotype may prevent them from developing psychopathology. More importantly, on the basis of re-viewed publications, we may postulate that neurobiological mechanisms of exercise-in-duced brain resilience are diverse and complex and need to be further explored.
