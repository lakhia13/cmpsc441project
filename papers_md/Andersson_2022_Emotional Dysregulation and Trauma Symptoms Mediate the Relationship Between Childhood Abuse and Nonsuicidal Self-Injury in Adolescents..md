dysregulation has been identiﬁed as a core mechanism in the development and
maintenance of NSSI and it is therefore an important target when addressing NSSI.
The pathogenic connection between different kinds of childhood abuse, difﬁculties in
emotion regulation and NSSI needs further investigation. The objective of this study
was to examine whether difﬁculties with emotion regulation and trauma symptoms,
separately and together, mediate the relationships between sexual, physical and
emotional abuse and NSSI.

Method: Cross-sectional data was collected from 3,169 adolescent high-school
students aged 16–19 years (M = 18.12, SD = 0.45). Data from self-reported experiences
of childhood abuse, current difﬁculties with emotion regulation (measured with the
Difﬁculties with Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS-16) and trauma symptoms (measured
with the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, TSCC), and NSSI were collected.
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to test the proposed relationships
between variables.

Results: The prevalence of life-time NSSI was 27.4%. Prevalence of reported childhood
abuse was 9.2, 17.5, and 18.0% for sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, respectively.
Childhood abuse, difﬁculties with emotion regulation and trauma symptoms exhibited
signiﬁcant positive associations with NSSI in adolescents. Emotional dysregulation and
trauma symptoms were both found to mediate the relationship between childhood
abuse and NSSI. Latent variable models were found to ﬁt data well.

NSSI, Abuse and Emotional Dysregulation

Conclusion: Results indicate that increased levels of emotional dysregulation and
trauma symptoms in relation to childhood abuse contribute to the increased risk of
NSSI. Further, results point to some aspects of emotional dysregulation and trauma
symptoms being more important in this regard. Clinical implications are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is deﬁned as the direct and
deliberate destruction of one’s own body tissue without suicidal
intent (1). Diﬀerent methods include hitting, cutting and burning
oneself (2). There is a curvilinear relationship between age
and NSSI (3), and NSSI is most common in adolescents,
with a community prevalence around 17% (4–6). Recent data
even suggest a potential increase in adolescent NSSI during
the COVID-19 pandemic (7), making it a highly relevant and
concerning behavior. NSSI is associated with negative long-
term consequences such as mental health issues,
lower self-
esteem, social isolation and increased risk for suicide attempts
(8). Emotion regulation (ER), or rather dysregulation, has
been identiﬁed as a core mechanism in the development and
maintenance of NSSI. A meta-analysis revealed that greater
diﬃculties with ER were associated with greater likelihood to
engage in NSSI (9). Especially limited access to ER strategies,
non-acceptance of emotional responses, diﬃculties with impulse
control and diﬃculties engaging in goal-directed behavior when
experiencing negative emotions, according to the deﬁnition of
emotion dysregulation (ED) by Gratz and Roemer (10), increased
the risk of NSSI. There is ample empirical support that NSSI
regulates emotion (11) and engaging in NSSI with the aim
of changing an unwanted internal state has consistently been
reported as the most common reason why an individual engages
in NSSI (12). That NSSI is performed to change unwanted
emotional experiences has also been emphasized in the proposed
criteria of the suggested NSSI disorder diagnosis (13).

How NSSI and diﬃculties with ER develop during childhood
and adolescence, speciﬁcally in relation to early detrimental
childhood experiences, such as diﬀerent kinds of abuse, is an area
in need of further investigation.

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury and Childhood
Maltreatment
In order to detect, prevent and treat NSSI, research has
focused on identifying potential risk factors for the behavior.
Childhood maltreatment is one risk factor that has received
instance,
considerable attention in relation to NSSI. For
childhood maltreatment
is
associated with the presence of NSSI (14), and an increased risk of
later NSSI (15, 16). People with a lifetime history of NSSI report
signiﬁcantly more experiences of childhood maltreatment than
people without a lifetime history of NSSI (17).

(both maternal and paternal)

Even though there is an association between childhood
maltreatment and NSSI, the relationship is complex. One factor
contributing to the complexity is that the association seems to

be aﬀected by which type of maltreatment is being measured
(emotional neglect and abuse, physical neglect, and abuse or
sexual abuse). Some earlier studies (17) have reported that
emotional abuse and neglect were the only types of childhood
maltreatment that were directly associated with NSSI, whereas
physical and sexual abuse were not. Others (18) have reported
associations between physical neglect and NSSI, and between
sexual abuse and NSSI. Weierich and Nock (19), in contrast,
found a relationship only between sexual abuse and NSSI, and not
between non-sexual abuse and NSSI. Experience of sexual abuse
in relation to NSSI was also stressed in the review by Seraﬁni
et al. (15). Taken together, the research regarding the relationship
between diﬀerent subtypes of childhood maltreatment and NSSI
is somewhat inconclusive and further research is needed.
Another factor that adds to the complexity,

is that the
relationship between childhood maltreatment, such as sexual
abuse, and NSSI becomes much less pronounced when variables
family environment, depression, dissociation and
such as
alexithymia are controlled for (20). The relationship between
childhood maltreatment and NSSI also depends on the sample
examined. Liu et al. (21), for instance, found that the relationship
between childhood maltreatment and NSSI was stronger in non-
clinical samples. Moderating factors such as gender (15) and how
childhood maltreatment and NSSI is measured also play a role.

Childhood Maltreatment, Emotion
Dysregulation, Trauma Symptoms, and
NSSI
How childhood maltreatment is related to NSSI, and whether
the relationship is mediated through a third variable, has
been investigated in earlier research. Potential mediators that
have been examined are for instance symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (19), self-criticism (18), anxiety
and depressive symptoms (17), self-blame, alexithymia, and
dissociation (16), and also diﬃculties with ER (14, 22). Diﬀerent
types of diﬃculties with ER mediate the relationship between
diﬀerent types of childhood maltreatment and NSSI. Swannell
et al. (16) found alexithymia, the inability to identify and describe
to mediate the relationship between childhood
emotions,
maltreatment and NSSI in women, and this was especially salient
for physical abuse. Guérin-Marion et al. (14) found that ER
diﬃculties, measured as limited access to ER strategies and
emotional clarity, to mediate the relationship between childhood
maltreatment (measured as neglect, physical and psychological
abuse) and NSSI. Emotional expressivity is another aspect of
ER that has been identiﬁed to mediate the relationship between
speciﬁcally emotional abuse and NSSI (22). Another study (23)

NSSI, Abuse and Emotional Dysregulation

found ED to mediate the relationship between both physical and
emotional childhood maltreatment and NSSI frequency. Sexual
abuse, however, was not associated with ED in this study (23).
Further considering diﬃculties with ER, Brown et al. (17) found
emotional maltreatment, in terms of abuse and neglect, to be
directly associated with NSSI. In their study no other type of
childhood maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse or neglect)
was directly associated with NSSI. These types of abuse were
fully mediated through symptoms of depression and anxiety
(17). Other studies (24, 25) conﬁrm the relationship between
emotional maltreatment and NSSI, which together emphasize the
central role of emotional abuse and ED in relation to NSSI.

Existing research thus shows mixed results regarding the
relationship between diﬀerent types of childhood maltreatment
and NSSI and whether the relationship is direct or rather indirect,
and explained by a third variable. Emotional abuse seems to be
of particular interest considering the potential risk of developing
diﬃculties with ER, and NSSI.

Another potential mediating factor is PTSD or trauma
symptoms (TS). Weierich and Nock (19), for instance, found
reexperiencing and numbing/avoidance symptoms of PTSD to
mediate the relationship between sexual abuse and NSSI (19).
PTSD or TS evoked after experiencing childhood maltreatment
may also be connected to experiencing diﬃculties with ER.
Numbing, for example, may cause discomfort of feeling “empty”
and therefore trigger dysfunctional behaviors to generate feelings,
to avoiding feeling numb, which is a commonly reported function
of NSSI (12). Both TS and diﬃculties with ER are therefore of
particular interest when investigating the relationship between
childhood maltreatment and NSSI.

Taken together, the pathogenic connection between diﬀerent
kinds of childhood abuse, diﬃculties with ER, TS and NSSI
needs further investigation. The objective of this study was
to examine whether diﬃculties with ER and TS, separately
and together, mediate the relationship between childhood abuse
(sexual, physical and emotional abuse) and NSSI.

It was hypothesized that there would be a signiﬁcant positive
relationship between childhood abuse and NSSI, especially
between emotional abuse and NSSI, and that diﬃculties with ER
and TS would mediate this relationship.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

lecture time in the presence of ﬁeld workers. Students received
written information, were informed that study participation was
voluntary and gave informed consent to participate by answering
the questionnaire. According to the Swedish Ethical Review Act
(26) (SFS 2003:460), active consent is not required from parents
when adolescents are 15 years of age or older. The survey was
anonymous. To ensure conﬁdentiality when participants ﬁlled
in the questionnaire in school, the participants used their own
computer and were placed with suﬃcient distance to others.
Specially appointed staﬀ was present. If participants ﬁlled in the
questionnaire outside of school a unique identity was created,
which was not revealed to anyone. Mandatory reporting was
not possible due to the anonymity of the survey. To assure
the students safety and wellbeing, participants received written
information about where to turn for help and support, if needed.
A total of 210 schools with 7,752 students were selected
and of these 110 schools with 3,286 students competed the
questionnaire. Four non-serious questionnaires were excluded
rendering 3,282 students and yielding a response rate of 42.3%.
Due to the COVID-19-pandemic and the periodic closure
of Swedish high schools the data collection was interrupted,
extended, and changed to an online version that was possible to
get access to from other places than the classroom. This resulted
in three periods of data collection during 2020 and 2021, the
spring of 2020 (n = 1,195), the autumn of 2020 (n = 737),
and the spring of 2021 (n = 1,350). The response rate diﬀered
between the three periods of data collection. During the data
collection in classrooms the response rate was 57.1 and 58.4%,
while the response rate during the third period was 30.7%. Of
the 3,282 participants, 114 were older than 19 years and were
therefore excluded in the present study, following the United
Nations deﬁnition of adolescence as the period between 13 and
19 years (27), which resulted in 3,169 adolescent participants in
the present study.

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review

Authority (2019-05013-31, 2020-03611, 2020-06556).

Participants
In the present study, 3,169 adolescent high-school students aged
16–19 years (M = 18.1, SD = 0.5) were included. Of these,
1,383 (43.6%) were male, 1,761 (55.6%) were female and 25
(0.8%) identiﬁed as non-binary. For participants’ background
information and demographic data, see Table 1.

Procedure
Data was collected online in classrooms and during home studies
in a representative sample of third year students in Swedish high
schools during 2020–2021.

The schools were selected based on information from the
national school register and stratiﬁed to represent a normal
population of third year Swedish high school students regarding
school size and study program, and were then randomized.
Principals of selected schools were informed by e-mail and then
contacted by phone. If no contact was established after three
attempts the school was excluded. Participation was voluntary,
if the principal agreed a date was set for gathering information
through an online questionnaire that was ﬁlled in during

Measures
The questionnaire used was a slightly modiﬁed version of a
questionnaire used in three previous studies carried out in 2004,
2009 and 2014 (28–30). This study emanates from the survey
“Young people, sex and the internet after #metoo” (31) and
the questionnaire comprised 110 main questions concerning
socio-demographic background, experiences of abuse, and risk
behaviors. In addition, four standardized self-report instruments
measuring psychosocial health, diﬃculties with emotional
regulation, resilience and feelings of guilt and shame were used.

In the present study questions relating to sociodemographic
background, NSSI, experiences of abuse, TS and diﬃculties
with ER were used.

NSSI, Abuse and Emotional Dysregulation

Demographic Information
Demographic questions were created for the purpose of the
study assessing characteristics such as gender, type of study
program (theoretical education programs, e.g., science, social
studies, preparing for college/university; vocational programs,
e.g., motor mechanics, electronics, hairdressing, preparing for a
trade; individual programs for students who lack formal merits
for high-school), parents’ occupation and education, perception
of family’s economy, own and parents’ immigrant background
and living situation. Adolescents self-reported demographic
information in ﬁxed answer categories (Table 1).

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
Life-time prevalence of NSSI was assessed with the NSSI-
item from the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview
[SITBI; (32)], short-form and self-report version: “Have you
ever actually engaged in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI; that is,
purposely hurt yourself without wanting to die, for example by
cutting or burning)?”

Childhood Maltreatement
Emotional and physical abuse were measured with an
introductory single-item question: “Do you have experience
before the age of 18 that an adult has done any of the following

to you?”. Several examples were given of diﬀerent kinds of
emotional and physical abuse and participants could respond
“never,” “on single occasions,” or “on several occasions.”

Emotional Abuse
A dichotomous variable of emotional abuse was constructed
where emotional abuse was deﬁned as having experience of being
insulted (called worthless, stupid, ugly) or being treated like you
didn’t exist on several occasions; or locked in to cellar, closet or
similar; being locked out of your home; threatened to hit or harm
you on single or several occasions.

Physical Abuse
A dichotomous variable of physical abuse was constructed where
physical abuse was deﬁned as having experience of being pulled
by the hair or ear; slapped with hand; punched with hand or ﬁst;
kicked; burnt or scalded; pressed on neck/throat; hit with cain,
belt or ruler or other; threatened or hurt you with knife or gun;
hurt you with knife on single or several occasions.

Sexual Abuse
An introductory statement: ”People can be pressured, convinced
or forced to sexual acts that they cannot defend yourself against.
Have you ever been exposed to any of the following?” was
followed by diﬀerent examples of sexual abuse with response
alternatives “yes” or “no.” A dichotomous variable of sexual
abuse was constructed where sexual abuse was deﬁned as having
experience of either penetrating sexual, oral or anal abuse. Only
adolescents who reported that the sexual abuse had occurred
before the age of 18 were included in the analysis.

Childhood Abuse
A dichotomous total childhood abuse variable was also created
based on self-reported experiences of either emotional, physical
or sexual abuse or no-abuse experience.

Trauma Symptoms
Trauma symptoms were measured using the Trauma Symptom
Checklist for Children [TSCC; (33)]. The questionnaire includes
54 questions that can be divided into six categories; anxiety,
depression, post-traumatic stress, sexual concerns, dissociation
and anger. Response options are “never,” “sometimes,” “often,”
and “almost all of the time” and scores range from 0 to 162 for
the total scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of trauma
symptoms. When the instrument was psychometrically evaluated
(33), Cronbach’s alpha was 0.84. The Swedish translation by
Nilsson et al. (34) was used on the current sample. Cronbach’s
alpha in the present sample was 0.96 for the full instrument,
and 0.90 for subscale depression, 0.84 for anxiety, 0.88 for post-
traumatic stress, 0.87 for dissociation, 0.85 for anger, and 0.82 for
sexual concerns, indicating good to excellent internal consistency
for all subscales and total scale.

Difﬁculties With Emotion Regulation
Diﬃculties with ER were measured using the Diﬃculties with
Emotion Regulation Scale, 16-item version [DERS-16; (35)].
DERS-16 is a brief version of the 36-item original DERS version
(10). DERS-16 consists of 16 items rated on a ﬁve-point Likert
scale from “almost never” to “almost always.” Scores range from

16 to 80, where higher scores indicate more diﬃculties with
regulating emotions. Cronbach’s alpha in the present sample was
0.95 for the total scale, indicating excellent internal consistency.
DERS-16 includes ﬁve subscales: Nonacceptance (0.82), Goals
(0.89), Impulse (0.90), Strategies (0.89), and Clarity (0.83), which
all separately indicated good to excellent internal consistency in
the present sample.

and standard deviations,

Data Analysis
Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics using frequencies,
percentages, mean values
and
cross-tabulation with chi-square and odds ratio for categorical
data, and independent samples t-test for group comparisons
of continuous data. Internal consistency was assessed using
Cronbach’s alpha (α) for the self-report measures. Statistical
analyses were performed using the SPSS 28.0 software package
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), the R software package (36) and RStudio
IDE (37). For Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the lavaan
package (38) was employed.

Mediation eﬀects were investigated using a series of structural
equation models. The diﬀerent subtypes of abuse were speciﬁed
as independent variables and NSSI as outcome. Mediation was
evaluated using DERS-16 and TSCC sum scores as well as sub-
scale scores.

To examine whether the hypothesized mediation eﬀects
could be represented as relationships between latent constructs
reﬂected in sample data latent variable models were constructed.
As several indicators were dichotomous, and as non-normal
distribution could be assumed, models were ﬁtted using the
WLSMV estimator in lavaan (39, 40). Models were evaluated by
means of ﬁt indices Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker Lewis
Index (TLI), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR),
and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Chi-
square results could a priori be assumed not to be useful given the
large sample size (41). Robust (scaled) ﬁt indices were used and,
following Hu and Bentler (42), cut-oﬀ values for “relatively good
ﬁt” were set at “close to or under” 0.06 for RMSEA, “close to or
over” 0.95 for TLI and CFI and “close to or under” 0.08 for SRMR.
Correlation and covariance matrices available in the Appendix.

RESULTS

The lifetime prevalence of NSSI amounted to 27.4%. Childhood
emotional abuse from an adult was reported by 18.0% of
the participants, childhood physical abuse from an adult was
reported by 17.5% and childhood sexual abuse by 9.2%. A history
of childhood emotional (34.8%), physical (29.5%), and sexual
abuse (20.9%) was signiﬁcantly more commonly reported in
those with NSSI compared to those without NSSI (11.8, 12.9,
and 4.6%, respectively, all p < 0.001), although the eﬀects
to medium (ϕ = 0.268, ϕ = 0.196, and
sizes were small
ϕ = 0.253). Of those with NSSI, 51.2% had experienced at
least one form of abuse, compared to 21.6% of those without
NSSI, p < 0.001. Also, total scores on both DERS-16 and
TSCC were signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.001) in those with NSSI
(M = 48.1, SD = 15.5; M = 51.0, SD = 24.9) compared to
those without (M = 32.2, SD = 13.4; M = 26.6, SD = 18.8). See
Table 2.

In the subgroups reporting abuse, NSSI was also more
prevalent. Among adolescents reporting emotional abuse, 58.9%
reported that they had self-injured without suicidal intent. The
prevalence of NSSI in the groups reporting physical and sexual
abuse were, 46.3 and 62.0%, respectively. Among those reporting
history of at least one form of abuse, the prevalence was 46.9%.
In the group not reporting abuse, the prevalence of NSSI was
19.2%. The risk of ever having engaged in NSSI was signiﬁcantly
higher with a history of abuse (for emotional abuse OR 4.03, 95%
CI 3.34–4.87; for physical abuse OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.34–3.43; for
sexual abuse OR 5.47, 95% CI 4.24–7.06; for any abuse OR 3.81,
95% CI 3.22–4.50).

Mediation was investigated using a series of models with ED
and TS as mediators, by themselves and in parallel, using all three
subtypes of abuse as independent variables (Model 1A-D; see
Figure 1). Both ED and TS, by themselves, turned out to partially
mediate the relationship between both abuse (emotional, physical
as well as sexual) and NSSI (see Table 3).

Combined in parallel, in Model 1d, ED and TS mediated the
relationship completely, regardless of abuse subtype (the direct
eﬀect became non-signiﬁcant except in the case of physical abuse
where it was signiﬁcant but small and negative; see Table 4).

NSSI, Abuse and Emotional Dysregulation

FIGURE 1 | Models 1a–d: Modeling direct effect, single and parallel mediation.

Follow-up analysis to investigate the relative strengths of
diﬀerent aspects of ED and trauma symptom factors (i.e.,
sub-scales of DERS-16 and TSCC) as mediators revealed that
all factors partially mediated the eﬀect using the three abuse

variables. In a further step, when ED factors were modeled
as parallel mediators and allowed to correlate (model 2a; see
Figure 2), results echoed those of model 1b (see Table 5). The
factor Strategies was found to be the most important mediator
(see Table 5). Nonacceptance, Clarity, and Goals carried smaller

but signiﬁcant mediation eﬀects, while the Impulse factor was
found not to have a mediating eﬀect. The pattern was similar
regardless of abuse subtype used as independent variable. Similar
results were found when TS factors were modeled as parallel
mediators (model 2b; Figure 3 and Table 6). In this case,
the Depression and PTSD Symptoms factors were the most
important mediators (see Table 6). Anxiety carried a signiﬁcant
but small and negative mediation eﬀect, while the eﬀect of
Sexual Concerns was found to be non-signiﬁcant. The factor
Dissociation was signiﬁcant only when the eﬀect mediated was
that of emotional or physical abuse, while the factor Anger was
signiﬁcant only for sexual abuse.

With the objective to examine whether the eﬀects previously
indicated could be described as
relationships between
phenomena of a general character, SEM models were constructed
using latent variables. Models were speciﬁed with abuse
indicated by the three dichotomous survey items concerning
sexual, physical and emotional abuse. ED and TS were speciﬁed
as separate constructs indicated by the sub-scale/factor scores.
The latent variables were then arranged in a standard mediation
fashion (Models 3a for ED and 3b for TS; Figures 4, 5). Parallell
mediation was modeled using both the ED and TS latent variables
(Model 3c; Figure 6). Lastly, to examine to which degree ED and
TS could be understood to represent a general psychopathology
dimension, a model was ﬁtted using both DERS-16 and TSCC
sub-scale scores as indicating the same underlying construct,
which was used as mediator between childhood abuse and

NSSI (Model 3d; Figure 7). In order to obtain better ﬁt, models
including TSCC sub-factors (3b, c, and d) were adjusted, after
inspection of modiﬁcation indices, to estimate a correlation
between the factors Anger and Sexual Concerns. Crossloadings
of items belonging to these factors have been documented [e.g.,
(43)], and they were also found not to carry mediation (see
Table 6).

Models 3a and 3c were found to ﬁt the data well, while Model
3b was only approaching good ﬁt (RMSEA slightly above cut-
oﬀ; please see Table 7). This suggest that these are meaningful
representations of how data are distributed. Mediation eﬀects in
these models were partial, similar to what had been found when
evaluating mediation in models 1b and 1c. Model 3d was found
not to ﬁt data and is hence not a meaningful way to represent the
relationships here investigated.

DISCUSSION

NSSI is a prevalent and serious mental-health concern in
adolescents, and ED has been shown to be a core mechanism
in the development and maintenance of NSSI. Childhood
maltreatment is another factor that has received considerable
attention in relation to NSSI. The nature of these associations
are, however, not clear and this study contributes important
information on this topic by examining the relationship between
diﬀerent types of childhood abuse and NSSI in a large community
sample of Swedish adolescents, and to what degree diﬃculties
with ER and TS mediate this relationship. NSSI was found to
be highly prevalent in this sample, and experience of physical,
emotional and sexual abuse were signiﬁcantly more common in
adolescents with NSSI, compared to those without NSSI, as were
higher rates of TS and diﬃculties with ER. The results in the
current study found a signiﬁcant and positive association between
all subtypes of childhood abuse and NSSI. As hypothesized, ED
and TS was found to mediate this eﬀect. With ED and TS as
parallel mediators, the mediation was complete (the direct eﬀect
became non-signiﬁcant). Thus, it is likely that increased levels
of ED and TS in relation to childhood abuse explain part of the
increased risk of NSSI.

The life-time prevalence of NSSI in this sample (27.4%) was
higher than reported in prior studies of adolescents (4, 44).
This potential increase in NSSI in community adolescents needs
to be investigated further, to determine whether it is a stable

or temporary trend due to some external factor, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic (7).

Concerning rates of abuse in our sample, results were
strikingly similar to an earlier study that examined prevalence
rates of diﬀerent kinds of abuse in a large Swedish high-school
sample (45) and found self-reported rates of emotional abuse
(16.6 vs. 18.0%), sexual abuse (10.2 vs, 9.2%) and a somewhat
higher rate of physical abuse (26.5 vs. 17.5%) than the present
study. However, in a later study, the prevalence of physical
abuse was reported to have declined in Sweden from 18.2% in
2008 to 13.2% in 2017 (46), which is more consistent with our
results. In the current study, more adolescents with a history
of childhood abuse reported NSSI. Also, more adolescents with
NSSI reported experiences of some form of childhood abuse, as
well as more diﬃculties with emotion regulation (DERS-16) and
trauma symptoms (TSCC) compared to those without NSSI. This
diﬀerence between groups conﬁrms results from earlier studies
both in clinical (47) and community samples of adolescents (6),
and implies that adolescents with NSSI are more burdened by
adversitities and distress. Inversely, as indicated by odds ratios,
the risk of having engaged in NSSI was signiﬁcantly heightened
for victims of childhood abuse.

The results further showed that all types of maltreatment
investigated (sexual, physical and emotional abuse) were
signiﬁcantly associated with NSSI. As hypothesized, diﬃculties
with ER and TS fully mediated the relationship between all
subtypes of childhood maltreatment and NSSI. The relationship
between abuse history and NSSI prevalence in the present sample
can be described as an eﬀect of abuse history on ED and TS,
such that abuse seems to increase these symptoms. A history of
physical abuse seems to be a little bit weaker than sexual and
emotional abuse as a predictor.

Regarding the association between childhood abuse and NSSI,
results in the current study are consistent with prior studies (14,
15, 17–19, 22), and also add to the research ﬁeld by contributing
data in a large community sample. Although some earlier
studies only found an association between speciﬁc subtypes of
maltreatment and NSSI (18, 19, 22), the current study found a
signiﬁcant relationship between all types of maltreatment and
NSSI. One potential explanation for this diﬀerence may be that
childhood maltreatment was measured in diﬀerent ways. Some
of the previous studies [for example (16, 17, 19, 22, 23)] used
CTQ to measure childhood maltreatment, whereas the present
study did not. The mediating eﬀect of diﬃculties with ER is also

consistent with previous studies (14, 16, 22, 23). Concerning the
relationship between ED and NSSI, this conﬁrms the important
role of ED in relation to NSSI (9) and that one important
function of NSSI is to regulate emotions and changing an
unwanted internal state (12). Likewise, the mediating eﬀect of TS
is consistent with the earlier study by Weierich and Nock (19),
even though TS were measured with a diﬀerent questionnaire. TS
was measured by TSCC in this study, which includes symptoms
of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, dissociation, sexual
concerns and anger. The relationship between TS and NSSI could
potentially be understood as a maladaptive way of trying to
cope with or reduce these symptoms. Inspection of individual
path coeﬃcients indicate that the mediating eﬀect of TS was
somewhat stronger than that of ED. The important ﬁnding in
the present study is the fact that ED and TS combined mediate
the relationship between childhood maltreatment and NSSI,
pointing to a pathway between childhood maltreatment and
NSSI, via ED and TS.

In consistence with the results of Wolﬀ et al. (9), the DERS-
16 subscale Strategies seemed to be the most salient predictor

of NSSI pointing to this aspect of ED as being important to
address when working with NSSI in victims of childhood abuse.
Strategies, in fact, carried more than half of the eﬀect mediated
by ED while Impulse was found not to be a signiﬁcant mediator.
Limited access to ER strategies has been found to mediate this
association also in other studies (14), and the results of the
current study contribute further information by conﬁrming this
association in a much larger sample. An interpretation of the
mediation eﬀect via Strategies could be that victims of childhood
abuse to a higher degree lack adaptive ER strategies and thus are
more likely to engage in NSSI instead as a way to regulate intense
emotions. These results emphasize the role of focusing on speciﬁc
ER skills in the treatment of NSSI.

NSSI, Abuse and Emotional Dysregulation

This

important

study contributes

information on the
relationship between childhood abuse, ED, TS and NSSI in
adolescents. Strengths include using data from a large community
sample, including several diﬀerent types of abuse and validated
measures of ER and TS. The study is not without limitations,
however, and these need mentioning. First and foremost, all
data are cross-sectional, which limits casual interpretations of
pathways. ED and TS could cause an urge to engage in NSSI,
but the relationship could also potentially be bidirectional with
NSSI resulting in symptoms of depression and post-traumatic
stress, for example, and limited access to emotion regulation
skills. The reported abuse in the current study, however, occurred
before the age of 18 and symptoms of emotional dysregulation
and trauma were assessed as current experiences, whereas
NSSI was assessed as life-time prevalence. Longitudinal studies
are needed to further examine this pathogenic association.
The reliability of the data regarding abuse history could also
be limited as data is based on retrospective recall. Another
limitation is that experience of abuse was not measured with
a validated abuse measure, but instead questions created for
the present study. Results from other large epidemiological
studies of abuse rates in the same age group in Sweden conﬁrm
our prevalence rates, which, however, validated our prevalence
rates. The response rate of 42.3% also needs mentioning.
This was in part due to interruption of data collections due
to COVID-19, and caution must thus be taken when results
are generalized. In addition, the results cannot be generalized
beyond community samples of older adolescents. Finally,
as several of
the variables in our sample were based on
dichotomous survey items, there was no way to account for
severity or frequency of abuse or NSSI severity. There is reason
to believe that the eﬀects and relationships here presented
could be demonstrated in a better fashion given measures of a
higher resolution.

The results emphasize the role of ED and TS in the relationship
between childhood abuse and NSSI, which gives rise to several
implications. It is important to screen for childhood abuse in
adolescents with NSSI, and also to screen for NSSI in adolescents
with a history of childhood abuse. The results also stress the need
for ER skills training for children, adolescents and caregivers,
especially when there is a history of childhood abuse. Both as a
way of preventing future ED problems, and also to treat NSSI.
Based on our results, it would be speciﬁcally meaningful to focus

on decreasing symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress,
and also to increase strategies for ED.

In conclusion, the current study found a signiﬁcant and
positive relationship between all subtypes of childhood abuse
and NSSI in a large community sample of Swedish adolescents.
ED and TS were found to completely mediate this relationship.
Results indicate that increased levels of emotional dysregulation
and trauma symptoms in relation to childhood abuse contribute
to the increased risk of NSSI.
