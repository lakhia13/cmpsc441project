Abstract: Given the involvement of balance system abnormalities in the pathophysiology of panic
disorder and agoraphobia (PD-AG), we evaluated initial evidence for feasibility, acceptability, and
potential clinical usefulness of 10 sessions of balance rehabilitation with peripheral visual stimulation
(BR-PVS) in an open-pilot 5-week intervention study including six outpatients with PD-AG who
presented residual agoraphobia after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment and
cognitive–behavioral therapy, dizziness in daily life, and peripheral visual hypersensitivity measured
by posturography. Before and after BR-PVS, patients underwent posturography, otovestibular
examination (no patients presented peripheral vestibular abnormalities), and panic-agoraphobic
symptom and dizziness evaluation with psychometric tools. After BR-PVS, four patients achieved
postural control normalization measured by posturography, and one patient exhibited a favorable
trend of improvement. Overall, panic-agoraphobic symptoms and dizziness decreased, even though
to a lesser extent in one patient who had not completed the rehabilitation sessions. The study
presented reasonable levels of feasibility and acceptability. These ﬁndings suggest that balance
evaluation should be considered in patients with PD-AGO presenting residual agoraphobia and
that BR-PVS might be an adjunctive therapeutic option worth being tested in larger randomized
controlled studies.

1. Introduction

Clinical and experimental evidence has suggested the involvement of balance system
abnormalities in the pathophysiology of panic disorder, especially with comorbid agora-
phobia (PD-AG). Around 50–70% of patients with panic disorder complain of dizziness or
unsteadiness both during and outside panic attacks (PAs) [1,2]. Preliminary associations
between dizziness during PAs and agoraphobia have been found, and observations in
clinical practice have suggested a link between dizziness outside PAs and the presence and
severity of agoraphobia [3].

Otoneurologic examinations have revealed a higher prevalence of peripheral vestibular
abnormalities in patients with PD-AG [4–8]. Even when full-blown vestibular abnormalities
are absent, these patients often present impaired inter-sensory integration in balance control
during posturography and unusual dependence on information from non-vestibular sen-
sory channels, primarily visual. Consequently, they exhibit reduced adaptability to postural

challenges and misleading sensory clues, with subjective intolerance and objective impair-
ment in balance-challenging situations such as in moving visual environments [3,9–14].
In line with these results, we found postural hypersensitivity to visual stimuli moving in
the peripheral visual ﬁeld during posturography in patients with PD-AG compared with
healthy controls [15]. Finally, dizziness and unsteadiness in patients with PD-G may belong
to the spectrum of persistent postural–perceptual dizziness (PPPD), possibly sharing some
common mechanisms [16,17].

Unfortunately, despite the possibility that some patients with panic disorder may
have a “balance vulnerability” to agoraphobia [18,19], balance system evaluation is not
part of routine clinical practice, even when persistent agoraphobia or complaints about
dizziness and/or subjective visual hypersensitivity in daily life are present. Unrecognized
balance system abnormalities might explain part of the unsatisfactory therapeutic responses
in patients with PD-AG [20], and at least a portion of these patients might beneﬁt from
interventions to regain the inter-sensory integration in balance control.

Only one preliminary open study has explored this potential therapeutic option by
applying vestibular rehabilitation in patients with PD-AG and various balance system ab-
normalities. Patients obtained an additional improvement in panic-agoraphobic symptoms
to the partial beneﬁts previously achieved with a 4-week behavioral therapy phase [21].

Considering our previous ﬁndings of postural hypersensitivity to peripheral visual
stimulation in patients with PD-AG [15], this open-pilot intervention study aimed to
evaluate initial evidence for feasibility, acceptability, and potential clinical usefulness of a
newly developed balance rehabilitation with peripheral visual stimulation in patients with
PD-AG who presented residual agoraphobia after recommended treatments and a balance
system-related clinical proﬁle. Throughout the manuscript, reporting and related discussion
follow the current guidelines and recommendations for reporting non-randomized pilot
and feasibility studies [22–24].

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants

This 5-week open-pilot intervention study included a sample of 6 participants (3 fe-
males and 3 males) with DSM-IV-TR-deﬁned PD-AG [25], who were consecutively recruited
among outpatients referring to a single senior psychiatrist (D.C.), which delivered psychi-
atric visits for 24 h per month, at the Anxiety Disorders Clinical and Research Unit of San
Raffaele Turro Hospital, Milan. The entire study lasted from the beginning of March to the
end of October 2009. Due to time and personnel constraints, the last possible enrollment
was scheduled at the beginning of October to conclude the 3 week-balance rehabilitation
by the end of the same month. Finally, due to organizational issues, enrollment was
temporarily suspended during August. Hence, enrollment was conducted in 6 months.

A senior psychiatrist (DC) and a senior otorhinolaryngologist (RT) recruited partici-
pants assessing their eligibility via clinical interviews and static posturography (SP) with
peripheral visual stimulation (PVS) (SP-PVS) according to the inclusion and exclusion
criteria listed below. During clinical interviews by a senior psychiatrist (D.C.), psychi-
atric diagnoses were assessed through a DSM-IV-TR-based unstructured interview, and
information concerning medical history and medications was collected.

In addition to the current diagnosis of PD-AG, inclusion criteria were the following:
age ≥ 18 years; receiving recommended ﬁrst-line antipanic medications [26] for at least
3 months, with adequate and stable dosages for at least 3 weeks before the beginning of the
study, and having completed an adequate cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) program of
at least 12 sessions, delivered by a licensed psychologist, according to guidelines for PD-
AG [26]; being bothered by persistent residual agoraphobia despite appropriate treatments;
presenting a balance system-related clinical proﬁle including (1) having been bothered
by at least 15 dizzy days per month in the last 3 months, (2) a Visual-Romberg Quotient
(Visual-RQ) < 0.77 (see below) during the ﬁrst static posturography with peripheral visual
stimulation (SP-PVS) one week before the ﬁrst rehabilitation session, indicating the pres-

Audiol. Res. 2023, 13

ence of hypersensitivity to peripheral visual stimulation, and (3) a Visual-RQ < 0.77 also
during the second SP-PVS just before the ﬁrst rehabilitation session, as conﬁrmation of the
peripheral visual hypersensitivity; ﬁnally, voluntarily provided written informed consent
to participate.

Patients were excluded in case of current co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders;
lifetime psychotic disorders; drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within the past 6 months;
assumption of medications not recommended for PD-AG; assumption of benzodiazepines
on a regular daily basis; lifetime neurological disorders, except for migraine; and pregnancy.
No changes in the type or dosages of antipanic medications were allowed during
the study, while the occasional use of benzodiazepines, no more than twice a week, was
allowed. Likewise, no CBT or other psychological interventions were allowed.

The study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the

Local Health Authority (ASL) of Milan Ethics Committee ASL “City of Milan”.

2.2. Procedure and Measures

At the beginning (T0, a week before the ﬁrst session) and end (T1, a week after the last
session) of rehabilitation, participants underwent comprehensive instrumental and clinical
assessment, as follows. The entire assessment was conducted at the outpatient facilities of
the Anxiety Disorders Clinical and Research Unit of San Raffaele Turro Hospital, Milan.

2.2.1. Balance System Function Evaluation

Conducted by a senior otorhinolaryngologist (RT), including SP-PVS [15], otovestibu-
lar evaluation with videonystagmography (Interacoustics–Assen–Denmark), and collection
of medical history on vestibular disorders (only at T0). An additional SP-PVS with the
same methodology was performed just before the ﬁrst rehabilitation session to conﬁrm the
reliability of the visual hypersensitivity of each participant.

Patients had to refrain from alcohol and benzodiazepine use for at least 2 days, xan-
thines for at least 8 h, and food or smoking for at least 2 h before posturography-PVS [27].
Static posturography usually measures postural sway as the displacement of the center
of pressure (CoP) of an individual when he/she stands on a platform with pressure trans-
ducers recording oscillations under different sensorial conditions. It provides information
on the individual’s ability to integrate multiple inputs in the control of posture [28].

For the aim of this study, we speciﬁcally evaluated peripheral visual hypersensitivity
by SP-PVS, which encompassed three sequential conditions: open-eyes pre-visual stimula-
tion, moving visual stimulation in the peripheral visual ﬁeld, and open-eyes post-visual
stimulation [15]. We used a force platform (Amplaid SveP, 10 Hz-signal acquisition) that
conformed to the standards of the International Society of Posturology [29]. The recording
in each condition took 30 s. Participants were instructed to stare at a white vertical line
(20 cm long by 4 cm wide) on a black background projected on a 17-in. display in front of
them without moving their heads or gazes during all three conditions. Peripheral visual
stimulation was produced by a video-ﬁlm (32 times-accelerated), showing people moving
in various contexts of everyday life, and projected on two lateral 150-cm2 screens; each
screen formed a 30◦ angle with the line connecting the head of subjects and the central
display and covering an angle from 10◦ to 50◦ of the visual ﬁeld (Figure 1). Different
moving scenes were used during the ﬁrst SP-PVS (T0), the second one (just before the ﬁrst
rehabilitation session), and the ﬁnal one (T1). In each progressive SP-PVS, the moving
scenes were the same for all patients.

The same apparatus was used to deliver the balance rehabilitation (BR) with peripheral

visual stimulation (BR-PVS) described in Section 2.3.

the procedures.

The posturographic outcome of interest in this study was peripheral visual hypersensi-
tivity as identiﬁed by the Visual-RQ, a modiﬁed version of the Romberg Quotient (RQ) [27].
The Visual-RQ was the ratio between the length of body sway (i.e., the sum of the distances
between the sequential sampled positions of CoP) [28] during the open-eyes-condition
pre-peripheral visual stimulation and that during the open-eyes-condition with peripheral
visual stimulation. The lower the Visual-RQ, the greater the postural instability induced by
visual stimulation; the Visual-RQ cut-off value to identify the visual hypersensitivity was
<0.77 [27].

Visual analog scales (VASs) for anxiety (VAS-A) and dizziness (VAS-D) (continuum
from 0, no anxiety/dizziness, to 100, the worst anxiety/dizziness imaginable, on a horizon-
tal line 100 mm in length) [30] were administered immediately before and after SP-PVS; the
VASs-after included those referring to the visual stimulation and to the moment immedi-
ately after the end of SP-PVS.

The otovestibular evaluation included bedside head impulse test, head-shaking test,
positional testing, research of skull vibration nystagmus, and Unterberger test; maneuvres
to rule out benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were also performed.

2.2.2. Panic-Agoraphobic Symptom and Dizziness Evaluation

Conducted by a senior psychiatrist (D.C.) and a licensed psychologist (C.C.), including
the Panic-Associated Symptom Scale (PASS), Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia (MIA),
and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), which are validated tools widely used for clinical
and research purposes.

The PASS is a clinician-administered psychometric tool to quantify the frequency and
intensity of unexpected and expected PAs and levels of anticipatory anxiety and AG during
the last week. It provides a total score of 0 to 28 and subscale scores, assessing unexpected
PAs (scores between 0 and 6), expected PAs (scores between 0 and 6), limited symptom PAs
(scores between 0 and 4), anticipatory anxiety (scores between 0 and 7), and agoraphobia
(scores between 0 and 5). The PASS has been widely used to measure clinical improvement
during treatments [31].

The MIA is a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the agoraphobic avoidance
of different daily life situations. It includes two scales, namely the Avoidance Accompanied
by a trusted Companion (AAC) scale and the Avoidance Alone (AAL) scale (26 and 27 items
on a Likert-type scale, respectively; for each item, a rating of 1 indicates the situation was
never avoided, and 5, always avoided). The ﬁnal score of each scale is obtained by dividing
the sum of all items by the number of items, producing scores between 1 and 5 [32,33].

The DHI is a self-administered 25-item questionnaire that assesses the self-perceived
handicapping effects caused by dizziness in functional, emotional, and physical domains

of daily life, producing a total score of 0 to 100. Scores between 0 and 29 indicate a mild
dizziness-related handicap, 30–60, moderate handicap, and >60 severe handicap [34,35].
As additional information, we evaluated the perception of dizziness during agoraphobic
situations via an ad hoc modiﬁed version of the MIA (MIA-Dizziness, MIA-D). In the
MIA-D, the 27 items of the MIA-AAL are listed; participants rate each item as “0” (never),
“2” (sometimes), or “4” (always) to indicate how much they usually perceived dizziness
when exposed to each situation, producing a total score ranging from 0 to 108.

For compilation of MIA, DHI, and MIA-D, participants were asked to refer to the last

two weeks.

2.3. Balance Rehabilitation with Peripheral Visual Stimulation

Patients received 10 sessions of BR-PVS on an individual basis over 3 weeks (i.e.,
3 sessions per week during the ﬁrst 2 weeks and 4 sessions during the last week). Each
session lasted 45 min. Rehabilitation was conducted by a senior otorhinolaryngologist (RT).
During each session, a battery of standardized exercises [21] was combined with
continuous moving visual stimulation in peripheral visual ﬁelds lasting the entire duration
of the session in order to promote habituation to stimuli with destabilizing effects. The
visual stimulation methodology resembled that used during posturography to assess visual
hypersensitivity, as described above (Figure 1). The moving scenes changed at each session.
In each progressive session, the scenes were the same for all patients.

The battery of standardized exercises included the following: quickly turning the head
every 5 s towards the right, middle, and left after vocal command (2 min of duration) while
staring at the white line on the display; looking at a point on the display while oscillating
the head at 1-hertz frequency on the yaw and pitch plane for 1 min each (Point de Mire);
dynamic exercises: all the previous exercises performed while stepping (1 min). Exercises
were repeated 4 times with intervals of 5 min.

Before, during, and after each BR-PVS session, VAS-A and VAS-D (continuum from 0,
no anxiety/dizziness, to 100, the worst anxiety/dizziness imaginable, on a horizontal line
100 mm in length) [30] were administered.

2.4. Statistical Analysis

We provided descriptive statistics as mean, standard deviation (SD), median, interquar-

tile range (IQR), and minimum and maximum values for each variable considered.

We also calculated the percentage of change of each variable after the BR-PVS, as
follows: 100 × (T1 − T0)/T0; for each calculated change, we provided the same above-
mentioned descriptive statistics. For all variables, changes presenting the “minus” sign
indicated improvement, except for the Visual-RQ, in which the “minus” sign indicated
worsening.

Due to the study design and the very small sample size, we did not provide statistical
comparisons according to the available guidelines concerning open-pilot intervention
studies [22–24].

The Statistical Package for Windows (Statistica 10.0, Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA)

was used.

3. Results

According to the Consort Transparent Reporting of Trials [23,36], the ﬂow diagram of

enrollment is presented in Figure 2.

Eight patients (three men and ﬁve women) provided their informed consent to partici-
pate. No eligible patient declined to participate. One patient was subsequently excluded
because her second Visual-RQ just before the ﬁrst rehabilitation session was 0.77, while an-
other dropped out after the ﬁrst rehabilitation session due to unexpected family problems.

Our ﬁnal sample included six patients (three men and three women) (mean (SD) age,
44 (6) years; median (IQR) age, 44 (9); minimum and maximum age, 38 and 55 years,
respectively). Three patients had 13 years of education, and three had 8 years of education.
All patients were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as follows: two
patients, 40 mg of citalopram per day (one of them was the partial completer mentioned
below); two patients, 40 mg of paroxetine per day; one patient, 30 mg of paroxetine per
day; one patient, 100 mg of sertraline per day.

Five patients attended all 10 rehabilitation sessions regularly (completers), whereas
one patient attended only 7 sessions on an irregular basis (partial completer) due to his
numerous work commitments.

3.1. Balance System Function Evaluation

Three patients presented a persistent non-paroxysmal bipositional apogeotropic nys-
tagmus as a unique vestibular symptom, which was considered a sign of a central vestibular
disorder and compatible with their history of probable vestibular migraine [37]. Video
HIT, as well as the remaining bedside examination (Head Shaking, skull vibration test,
Unterberger), were normal in all patients. No patients reported previous attacks of vertigo
during their lifetime.

As required as inclusion criteria, the Visual-RQ of all patients was <0.77 both at T0
(Table 1) and during the second SP-PVS just before the ﬁrst rehabilitation session (data not
shown).

At T1 (Table 1), the completers presented a general improvement of the Visual-RQ,
ranging from 7% to 65.8%. Considering each patient individually, four patients achieved
Visual-RQ values >0.77, and one achieved a value of 0.76 starting from 0.71 at T0. Only the
partial completer reported a decrease in Visual-RQ value at T1 (0.59), starting from 0.75 at
T0 (22.4% worsening).

3.2. Dizziness and Panic–Agoraphobic Symptom Evaluation

At T1 (Table 1), the completers exhibited a general improvement in the total DHI
score, whose decrease ranged from 15.4% to 66.7 %; the partial completer presented a more
limited decrease in DHI total score (8.3%).

Most clinical measures assessing panic–agoraphobic symptoms and dizziness in daily
life indicated a considerable improvement at T1 among completers, while the partial
completer had only limited improvement (Table 1).

Anxiety and dizziness during the SP-PVS at T1 and the last rehabilitation session

globally decreased, even though to a lesser extent in the partial completer (Table 1).

4. Discussion

In this open-pilot intervention study, we evaluated initial evidence for feasibility,
acceptability, and potential clinical usefulness of 10 sessions of a newly developed BR-
PVS in six outpatients with PD-AG who presented residual agoraphobia, even after SSRI
pharmacotherapy and CBT, and a balance system-related clinical proﬁle, namely persistent
dizziness in daily life and peripheral visual hypersensitivity as identiﬁed by SP-PVS.

No patients presented peripheral vestibular abnormalities, while three patients re-
ported signs and symptoms compatible with a history of migraine, in line with the previ-
ously reported association between PD and migraine [7].

The intervention was dedicated to patients with PD-AG who exhibited a highly
speciﬁc clinical proﬁle, and the sample size was very small. However, this pilot study
showed reasonable levels of feasibility, acceptability, and potential clinical usefulness of BR-
PVS, suggesting this intervention is worth being tested in larger and adequately powered
randomized controlled studies.

Approximately 9% of patients with PD visited by a single psychiatrist in 6 months
during a limited amount of monthly hours dedicated to outpatient visits were eligible.
Even considering the rates of patients excluded or dropping out for different reasons
after written informed consent, it seems plausible that future enrollments conducted by
larger psychiatric personnel in specialized centers for treating anxiety Disorders may
reach adequate sample sizes to calculate statistical signiﬁcance and effect sizes. Similarly,
larger personnel dedicated to the study may partly decrease potential partial completers
due to personal, familial, or work commitments. Offering the opportunity to choose
between different time slots during which BR-PVS can take place may increase the chance of
completing the relatively high number of BR-PVS sessions. Furthermore, future multicenter
studies involving different specialized centers may contribute to enlarging sample sizes
and increasing the generalizability of the results.

A limitation of our study is the lack of questionnaires to assess participants’ percep-
tions, opinions, and satisfaction related to the BR-PVS. However, the fact that no eligible
patients declined to participate and no patients dropped out due to intervention-related
issues may be indirect preliminary indications of reasonable acceptability. Future studies
should address this limitation by using validated tools to evaluate BR-PVS acceptability
directly.

Finally, instrumentations and set-up were relatively easy to implement and had lim-
ited costs, increasing the replicability and facilitating future BR-PVS-related studies in
different centers.

Although the sample size was not suitable for statistical comparisons, the observation
of both posturographic and clinical measures revealed improvement after the intervention,
suggesting the potential clinical usefulness of BR-PVS in these patients.

Audiol. Res. 2023, 13

322

Four patients achieved normalization of postural control during posturography-PVS,
as indicated by Visual-RQ values > 0.77. One patient showed consistent improvement
relative to her Visual-RQ before rehabilitation, achieving a value of 0.76. Although this
value did not indicate complete normalization, it is conceivable that additional sessions
could have promoted further amelioration. Only the partial completer reported a decrease
in his Visual-RQ after rehabilitation, possibly related to the lower number of attended
sessions and discontinuous attendance.

In line with the improvement of posturographic measures, anxiety and dizziness
perceived during both the last rehabilitation session and posturography decreased, even
though to a lesser extent in the partial completer.

After BR-PVS, patients exhibited a global decrease in panic–agoraphobic symptoms,
dizziness perceived in agoraphobia-related situations, and self-perceived handicapping
effects caused by dizziness in daily life, as measured by the PASS-total score, PASS-
anticipatory anxiety, PASS-agoraphobia, and expected PAs in agoraphobic situations, MIA-
AAL, MIA-D, and DHI, respectively. Only the partial completer showed minimal clinical
improvement.

Notably, residual pre-BR-PVS panic-agoraphobic symptoms of participants encom-
passed a variety of agoraphobia-related symptoms, whereas no patients presented unex-
pected PAs. This picture was coherent with the expected remission of unexpected PAs
achieved with antipanic medications, while the visual hypersensitivity may have con-
tributed to the persistence of agoraphobia despite treatment. It is conceivable that small
postural modiﬁcations or stimuli from complex sensorial environments (e.g., shopping
malls, trafﬁc, and crowds) may provoke dizziness, instability, and discomfort in patients
with panic disorder and visual hypersensitivity, thus contributing to triggering situational
anxiety or panic. Defensive avoidance mechanisms induced by repeated signals of instabil-
ity, interoceptive and exteroceptive conditioning processes related to destabilizing stimuli,
and operant learning processes related to the avoidance of disturbing environments in
everyday life may inﬂuence the development, severity, or maintenance of agoraphobia in
these patients [18,19,38,39]. Consistently, our results suggest that the decrease in periph-
eral visual hypersensitivity during posturography after rehabilitation may be associated
with the improvement of agoraphobia and dizziness in daily life, possibly via sensory
re-integration processes and habituation mechanisms that promote physical and emotional
desensitization to complex sensorial environments.

However, the study design does not allow us to conclude that the clinical improvement
was entirely attributable to the speciﬁc effects of BR-PVS. Although participants had
previously completed an adequate CBT program, we cannot exclude those additional
CBT sessions that would have provided beneﬁts on the residual symptoms. Likewise, we
cannot rule out that other kinds of rehabilitation, not including visual stimulation, would
have led to similar improvements. For these reasons, future randomized studies with
active comparators in larger samples are warranted to understand whether our preliminary
suggestions can be conﬁrmed and generalized.

This study did not include follow-up monitoring, and further studies should evaluate

the long-term stability of improvements obtained during BR-PVS.

We applied BR-PVS using conventional instruments. However, it is conceivable that
future applications of virtual reality-based rehabilitation may provide greater beneﬁts
by offering experiences that are more immersive and more closely resemble daily life
environments, as demonstrated in other clinical conditions [40–42].

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, this open-pilot intervention study showed reasonable levels of fea-
sibility and acceptability, and potential clinical usefulness, of BR-PVS in patients with
PD-AGO, residual agoraphobia, and a balance system-related clinical proﬁle. Overall, this
study suggests BR-PVS as a potential therapeutic option worth being tested in larger and
adequately powered randomized controlled studies. Within the framework of personalized

Audiol. Res. 2023, 13

323

psychiatry and a multidisciplinary approach to psychiatric disorders [43], balance system
evaluation should be considered in clinical practice in patients with residual agoraphobia,
especially in case of complaints about dizziness or subjective discomfort in complex visual
environments. If conﬁrmed in adequate and reliable studies, BR-PVS might be a future
adjunctive therapeutic option for these highly suffering patients.
