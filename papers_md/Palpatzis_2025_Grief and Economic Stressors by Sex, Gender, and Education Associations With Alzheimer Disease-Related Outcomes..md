Abstract

Background and Objectives
The prevalence and impact of stressful life events (SLEs) on age-related and Alzheimer disease
(AD)–related pathways may depend on social determinants including gender and education.
We investigated whether speciﬁc SLEs are associated with AD pathology and neuro-
degeneration and how these associations diﬀer by gender and education.

Methods
This cross-sectional study included cognitively unimpaired participants, most with a family
history of sporadic AD, from the ALzheimer’s and FAmilies (ALFA) cohort, based in Bar-
celona, Spain. Participants had available assessments on occurrence and type of lifetime SLEs
and lumbar puncture and/or structural MRI. We performed multiple regression analyses to
examine the associations of speciﬁc SLE type with (1) AD pathologies (CSF phosphorylated
tau 181 [p-tau181] and β-amyloid [Aβ] 42/40) and (2) neurodegeneration markers (CSF
neurogranin and GM volumes voxel-wise) including interaction and stratiﬁcation analyses by
gender (women/men) and education.

Results
In total, 1,290 cognitively unimpaired participants (mean age = 59.4 years, range: 48–77 years,
99% White participants, 61% women) were included (393 with lumbar puncture and 1,234 with
spectroscopic MRI assessments). Less educated participants and women reported more grief-
related and economic-related SLEs. Furthermore, women reported more abuse and re-
productive SLEs. Grief-related SLEs were associated with AD and neurodegeneration CSF
outcomes while economic SLEs were associated with MRI-based GM outcomes, both in an age-
independent manner. Speciﬁcally, partner’s death was associated with lower Aβ42/40
(B = −5.19; 95% CI −9.61 to −0.76; p = 0.022) and higher p-tau181 (B = 0.18; 95% CI
0.05–0.32; p = 0.007) and neurogranin (B = 0.19; 95% CI 0.05–0.32; p = 0.007). The asso-
ciations with Aβ42/40 were driven by less educated participants and men and associations with
p-tau181 and neurogranin driven by women. Unemployment and economic loss were asso-
ciated with lower GM volumes in limbic and frontal areas, driven by more educated participants
and men and by women, respectively.

Discussion
Older adults at risk of cognitive decline with less education and women may be more susceptible to experience more SLEs. Men
who have experienced widowhood and unemployment and women who have experienced ﬁnancial diﬃculties may beneﬁt from
interventions.

Introduction

A largely unexplored potential risk factor of Alzheimer disease
(AD) and dementia is the lifetime exposure to stressful life
events (SLEs). SLEs are objective and observable major
events that typically require life readjustment1 and perceived
as threats to an individual’s well-being, identity, or social
status.2 Our previous work suggests a mechanistic link be-
tween increased exposure to SLEs and higher AD patho-
inﬂuenced by history of
physiologic markers later in life,
psychiatric disease and gender.3

Previous research has suggested that SLEs play a signiﬁcant
role in shaping social disparities among racially and ethnically
minoritized groups.4 It is well established that AD prevalence
is higher among women and less educated individuals,5,6
groups that also experience a higher prevalence of SLEs.7,8
The prevalence and impact of speciﬁc SLEs may also diﬀer
within groups, as, for example, unemployment is more com-
mon among individuals with less education.9 However, the
impact of speciﬁc SLEs on AD remains understudied, with few
existing studies focusing on isolated SLEs rather than on
multiple SLEs. These studies have shown associations of
losing a parent10 and having worse socioeconomic circum-
stances in childhood11 or getting divorced12 with an increased
AD risk. Widowhood was associated with accelerated
β-amyloid (Aβ)–related cognitive decline among cognitively
unimpaired older men and women.13

Therefore, we aim to examine the association of speciﬁc SLEs
with AD pathophysiology and brain structure and assess the
eﬀect of gender and education among cognitively unimpaired
individuals at risk of cognitive decline. We hypothesized to
observe a higher prevalence of SLEs among women and those
less educated and a diﬀerential impact of SLEs on brain health
depending on gender and educational level.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, and Participants
This cross-sectional cohort study consists of participants of the
ALFA (for ALzheimer’s and FAmilies) parent cohort that
includes 2,743 cognitively unimpaired participants at an

increased risk of AD (86% have at least 1 parent diagnosed with
AD14) who were enrolled between 2013 and 2014 (eFigure 1).
Participants were recruited through press recruitment (eTable 1
provides inclusion and exclusion criteria).14

A subset (n = 419) of the ALFA parent cohort participants are
part of the nested longitudinal ALFA+ study invited based on
their enriched AD risk proﬁle (AD parental history, APOE e4
status, verbal episodic memory score, and the Cardiovascular
Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia risk score).14
The ALFA+ participants underwent advanced protocols of
structural MRI, amyloid PET, and lumbar puncture for CSF
biomarker assessments.

In this study, we included all participants from the ALFA+
cohort with complete-case data available on CSF measure-
ments and across all other variables (AD pathophysiology
sample) and all participants from the ALFA parent cohort
with complete-case data available on MRI-based gray matter
volume and across all other variables (brain structure MRI
sample). eFigure 1 depicts the ﬂow diagram of participant
selection for this study. This study followed the Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
reporting guideline.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations,
and Patient Consents
The ALFA and ALFA+ study protocols have been approved
by the Independent Ethics Committee “Parc de Salut Mar,”
Barcelona, and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identiﬁers:
NCT01835717, NCT02485730). Participants provided in-
formed consent at baseline with a form approved by the In-
dependent Ethics Committee “Parc de Salut Mar,” Barcelona.
All methods were performed in accordance with the ethical
standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki
and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Demographic and Other Characteristics
Demographic and lifestyle characteristics used in this study
were collected at participants’ latest study visit between 2016
and 2021 through interviews and self-reported questionnaires
and included age; gender; years of education as a continuous
covariate; and history of cardiovascular disease and psychiatric
disease, both as binary covariates. Participants self-reported

their race-ethnic self-identiﬁcation (White, North African,
Sub-Saharan African, Latin American, Asian, Roma, and other
ethnicities) and their gender using a binary label (i.e., woman/
man). Sex refers to an individual’s sex chromosome comple-
ment (XX vs XY) and is typically assigned at birth based on
external anatomy while gender is a social construct referring
to socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities.15 Sex
and gender are intrinsically linked, but because the aim in our
study is to mainly understand the eﬀects of stressors in
a gender-oriented framework, in which women and men have,
for example, diﬀerent socially constructed roles and oppor-
tunities for work/education, we will,
therefore, refer to
women/men throughout the article. Conversely, we will refer
to female/male when discussing potential biological path-
ways. Participants were regarded as having a history of car-
diovascular or psychiatric disease if they self-reported having
received a clinical diagnosis at any point during their lifetime.
Participants were also genotyped for 2 single-nucleotide var-
iants, rs429358 and rs7412, which dictate the protein isoform
generated from APOE. APOE e4-carrier status was included as
a binary covariate.

Specific SLEs
Participants underwent clinical interviews between 2016 and
2021. Exposure to 18 diﬀerent stressors was examined with
a structured interview with predeﬁned events adopted from
the SNAC-K study,16 based on Miller and Rahe’s list of life
change events (eTable 2).1,17 Assessing SLEs through struc-
tured interviews have been found to have better test-retest
reliability and reduce intracategory variability compared with
traditional SLE checklists.18 Indeed, our SLE measurements
showed high test-retest correlation.3 We ran test-retest cor-
relations to assess the reliability of our measurement in par-
ticipants with 2 assessments. The SLE measurements showed
a high test-retest correlation within the whole CSF (r = 0.93,
p < 0.001) and MRI (r = 0.93, p = 0.001; mean time in-
between assessments = 4.0 and 3.9 years, respectively)
samples.3

Participants reported whether each event had happened
during their lifetime at least once. For participants who un-
derwent the interview more than once, only their last in-
terview was considered. The events were categorized into
binary variables based on whether the event occurred at least
once (0 = event not experienced, 1 = event experienced once
or more). Information on the count of repeated events and
timing of events within the sample has been described else-
where.3 For this study, we included SLEs with a prevalence of
5% or more within our samples, resulting in the inclusion of
13 diﬀerent SLEs (Table 1).

CSF Measurements
Participants underwent lumbar puncture between years 2016
and 2019. The average number of days elapsed from lumbar
puncture to assessment of SLEs was 511.36 days (SD =
593.78, range = −582 to 1,512 days). CSF phosphorylated tau
181 (p-tau181) was measured using the Elecsys Phospho-Tau

(181P) CSF electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on
a fully automated cobas e 601 instrument (Roche Diagnostics
International Ltd., Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Aβ42/40 ratio and
neurogranin were measured with the NeuroToolKit, a panel
of robust prototype assays (Roche Diagnostics International
Ltd.), on a cobas e 411 or e 601 instrument. All CSF meas-
urements were performed at the Clinical Neurochemistry
Laboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden.19

Owing to non-normality of the residuals in the models of
Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau, and neurogranin, these variables were
log10-transformed.

MRI Acquisition and Image Preprocessing for
Voxel-Based Morphometry
Participants underwent MRI scans between years 2016 and
2019. The average number of days elapsed from MRI scans
to assessment of SLEs was 56.04 days (SD = 209.95,
range = −371 to 1,573 days). The T1-weighted 3D turbo ﬁeld-
echo sequence was acquired in a Philips (Best, the Nether-
lands) 3T Ingenia CX scanner with a voxel size of 0.75 ×
0.75 × 0.75 mm3, ﬁeld of view of 240 × 240 × 180 mm3,
sagittal acquisition, ﬂip angle of 8°, repetition time of 9.9
milliseconds, echo time of 4.6 milliseconds, and inversion
time of 900 milliseconds. The VBM preprocessing was per-
formed using SPM12 software running on MATLAB R2010a.
Images were ﬁrst segmented into gray matter, white matter,
and CSF using an extended set of probability maps. Next,
Dartel was used to estimate accurate spatially normalizing
transformations, after which the gray matter maps were
smoothed by convolving with an isotropic Gaussian kernel
of 8-mm full width half maximum. A mean normalized
group-level gray matter mask was generated from in-
dividual segmented masks and thresholded at gray matter
probability >0.3. Cerebellar and vermian areas were re-
moved from the mask.

Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of the sample were summarized as means and
SDs for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages
for categorical variables. We used χ2 tests to examine whether the
prevalence of SLEs diﬀered by gender and educational level. To
examine the association of speciﬁc SLEs with the CSF outcomes,
we performed 3 sets of multivariable regression analyses
adjusting for age, gender, years of education, APOE e4-carrier
status, history of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases, and all
other SLEs. Moreover, analyses were stratiﬁed by gender and
educational level, and interaction analyses were performed. For
stratiﬁed and interaction analyses, education was categorized into
low (12 or fewer years) and high (13 or more years) levels of
education.

Because we considered the occurrence of SLEs alone, in
sensitivity analyses, to ensure the robustness of our results,
we repeated the analyses with CSF variables as outcomes by
adjusting for the total accumulated life events (taking into
account how many times each SLE was experienced) and

we also repeated the analyses by not adjusting for any
other SLEs.

p Values were 2-sided with statistical signiﬁcance set at less
than 0.05. All analyses were prespeciﬁed and performed with
Stata SE, version 17.0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX).
Given that all analyses were prespeciﬁed and we expected low-
to-moderate eﬀects of SLEs in a preclinical sample, we did not
use correction for multiple comparison methods because they
are too conservative and increase type II error.20

Voxel-Wise Statistical Analyses
We used multiple regression in SPM to investigate the associ-
ation of speciﬁc SLEs with gray matter volume including age,
gender, years of education, APOE e4 status, history of cardio-
vascular and psychiatric diseases, total intracranial volume as
covariates, and all the speciﬁc SLEs in the statistical analyses. All
the SLEs were considered. We considered signiﬁcant results
surviving an uncorrected p value of 0.001 at voxel level and
a cluster-level p < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) correction.

Results

Characteristics of the participants included in the study are
given in Table 2 and characteristics by gender and educational
level in eTables 3 and 4. Among the 393 participants included
in the CSF sample, the mean (SD) age was 61.2 (4.7) years at
lumbar puncture, and among the MRI participants, the mean
(SD) age at MRI was 59.2 (6.6) years. There was an overlap of
337 participants in the CSF and MRI samples. The diﬀerences
in participant characteristics between the ALFA parent cohort
and the participants included in this study are provided in
eTable 5.

Prevalence of SLEs by Education and
Gender Groups
Within the whole study sample (n = 1,290), participants with
a lower educational level (≤12 years), compared with those
with a higher educational level (≥13 years), reported a higher
prevalence of death of partner (8.6% vs 4.6%; p = 0.004),
unemployment (37.5% vs 28.1%; p < 0.001), and severe ﬁ-
nancial loss (19.1% vs 13.2%; p = 0.004; Figure 1A). Within
the whole study sample (n = 1,290), women, compared with
men, reported a higher prevalence of having been a victim of
abuse (14.4% vs 8.4%; p = 0.001), terminated pregnancy
(within the partnership) (29.6% vs 14.7%; p < 0.001), death of

results were independent of gender, age, APOE e4-carrier sta-
tus, history of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases, years of
education, and other SLEs. No other speciﬁc SLEs were asso-
ciated with gray matter volumes.

Association of Specific SLEs With Amyloid, Tau,
and Neurogranin
Within the whole CSF sample, independent of all covariates
and other SLEs, death of partner was associated with a lower
Aβ42/40 ratio (p = 0.022) and higher p-tau (p = 0.007) and
neurogranin (p = 0.007) levels (Table 3). No other stressors
were associated with any of the CSF outcomes.

Voxel-Wise Association of Specific SLEs With
Brain Structure
Associations of speciﬁc SLEs and regional gray matter volumes
are shown in Figure 2. Becoming unemployed was associated
with reduced gray matter volume in the right and left anterior
cingulate gyrus, extending to the left paracingulate gyrus and in
the subcallosal cortex (Figure 2A). Severe ﬁnancial loss was
associated with reduced gray matter volume bilaterally in the
lingual gyrus, precuneus, precentral gyrus, and anterior cingu-
late gyrus, extending to the juxtapositional lobule cortex and the
paracingulate gyrus, as well as with reduced gray matter volume
in the left angular and supramarginal gyrus (Figure 2B). These

Association of Specific SLEs With Amyloid, Tau,
Neurogranin, and Brain Structure by Gender
In analyses stratiﬁed by gender, death of partner was associ-
ated with a lower Aβ42/40 ratio (p = 0.011; eTable 8) only
among men and with higher p-tau (p = 0.008; eTable 9) and
neurogranin (p = 0.006; eTable 10) levels only among
women. There was no interaction of death of the partner with
gender on Aβ, p-tau, or neurogranin (eTable 11).

Stratiﬁed voxel-wise analyses showed that the associations of
gray matter volumes with unemployment were driven by men,
whereas those with ﬁnancial loss were driven by women with
only partial support from interaction analyses. Thus, be-
coming unemployed was associated with reduced gray matter
volume bilaterally in the postcentral and precentral gyrus,
juxtapositional lobule cortex, superior frontal gyrus, anterior

found between becoming unemployed and gray matter
volumes.

Severe ﬁnancial loss was associated with reduced gray matter
volume bilaterally in the precuneus and posterior cingulate
gyrus (Figure 3B) only among women. However, this result
was not supported by a signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect. At un-
corrected 0.005 at voxel level and FWE correction at cluster
level, there was no interaction between gender and ﬁnancial
loss on gray matter volume.

Association of Specific SLEs With Amyloid, Tau,
Neurogranin, and Brain Integrity by
Educational Level
In analyses stratiﬁed by educational level, death of partner was
associated with a lower Aβ42/40 ratio (p = 0.012; eTable 12),
higher p-tau (p = 0.003; eTable 13), and higher neurogranin
(p = 0.011; eTable 14) only among less educated individuals.
There was no interaction of death of partner with education
on Aβ, p-tau, or neurogranin (eTable 11).

Finally, stratiﬁed and interaction voxel-wise analyses showed
that among those with a higher educational level, becoming
unemployed was associated with reduced gray matter vol-
ume bilaterally in the lingual gyrus, occipital fusiform gyrus,
anterior parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, insular cortex,
anterior and posterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, su-
perior frontal gyrus,
frontal orbital cortex,
frontal pole,
frontal medial cortex, precentral and
subcallosal cortex,
postcentral gyri, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus
and in the left anterior temporal fusiform cortex and left
putamen (Figure 3C). This pattern was similar in interaction
analyses, but restricted to the posterior areas at uncorrected
0.005 at voxel level and FWE correction at cluster level
(eFigure 3). Among those with a lower educational level, no
associations were found of any SLEs with gray matter
volumes.

Sensitivity Analyses
To rule out the eﬀects of the total accumulated SLEs on the
results, we repeated the analyses for death of partner, un-
employment, and ﬁnancial loss by adjusting for the total ac-
cumulated SLEs. We also repeated the analyses, adjusting

remained unchanged in both CSF and SPM analyses (eTables

history of psychiatric disease for the SPM and CSF main
analyses that were signiﬁcant and found that history of psy-
chiatric disease interacted with death of partner on p-tau and
neurogranin (eTable 17).

Discussion

In cognitively unimpaired individuals at an increased risk of
AD dementia, we found that (1) less educated participants
and women showed a higher prevalence of SLEs and (2) grief-
related stressors—notably death of partner—were related to
AD pathophysiology while economic stressors were related to

gray matter volume. Furthermore, our results suggest (3) sex- or
gender-related stress pathways—involving Aβ in men and tau
and neurogranin in women—and (4) an SLE-dependent in-
ﬂuence on gray matter volumes, with unemployment showing an
eﬀect among men and those with higher education and ﬁnancial
loss showing an eﬀect among women.

Our results indicate that having experienced death of partner
is associated with all CSF biomarkers within the whole sample
in an age-independent manner. Indeed, death of partner is
considered to be one of the most stressful events in life1 and is
associated with an increased dementia risk.21 However, our
results are not consistent with those of a previous cross-
sectional study among cognitively unimpaired participants
and patients with mild cognitive impairment reporting no
association between spouse bereavement and AD patholo-
gies.22
among
community-dwelling cognitively unimpaired older adults,
found no diﬀerence in baseline Aβ levels by widowhood status
but did report widowhood to be associated with accelerated
Aβ-related cognitive decline.13 It is possible that participants

study,

in our cohort—enriched by a family history of sporadic AD
and with a higher percentage of APOE e4-carriers compared
to the population—are more vulnerable to stress eﬀects on
AD pathophysiology. Furthermore, our study’s participants
were younger and lost their partner earlier. It is also possible
that unhealthy lifestyles (that could have contributed to
partner’s death) could explain some of the association be-
tween partner’s death and higher AD pathophysiology be-
cause spouses often tend to share a similar lifestyle.23
Diﬀerential results could also be due to cultural diﬀerences
among cohorts aﬀecting family attachments and, therefore,
bereavement eﬀects. Although our ﬁnding is novel and war-
rants replication in other cohorts, it indicates that widowed
individuals could be particularly susceptible to higher AD
pathophysiology and as a high-risk group could possibly
beneﬁt from stress-coping interventions.

We found moderate evidence suggesting a gender-related eﬀect
of death of partner. Analyses stratiﬁed by gender indicated that
the association of death of partner with Aβ might be driven by
masculine gender. Men might be disproportionally aﬀected by

losing a partner because they typically have a smaller social
network than women,24 so their loss could cut more deeply
into their social network. Conversely, because women tend to
have higher social support and greater social circles,24 this may
buﬀer against the negative eﬀects of losing a partner. However,
we also observed that the association of death of partner with
p-tau and neurogranin might be driven by feminine gender. It is
possible that stress could have sex-speciﬁc and gender-speciﬁc
eﬀects on AD pathophysiology, having stronger eﬀects on Aβ
among men and stronger eﬀects on p-tau among women.
These results are in line with ﬁndings suggesting higher levels of
tau pathology in women compared with men.25 Whether
higher tau accumulation in women is linked with the prevalence
and/or impact of speciﬁc risk factors, such as depression, which
could confound the association between stress and AD path-
ophysiology, warrants further research. It is also possible that
the observed moderate gender diﬀerences in CSF outcomes are
due to limited statistical power as suggested by signiﬁcant dif-
ferences but overlapping CIs. Therefore, replication of these
analyses in other cohorts is warranted. In addition, we found
that death of partner is associated with higher p-tau and neu-
rogranin only among those with lower educational level. This
could be due to smaller social networks or limited ﬁnancial
resources and increased ﬁnancial stress after the death of
partner26 among the less educated.

We found that having experienced unemployment is associ-
ated with lower brain structure in areas of the limbic system,
speciﬁcally in the anterior cingulate gyrus and paracingulate
gyrus. These areas are known to be involved in emotion and
behavior regulation,27 and lower gray matter volume of these
areas is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in indi-
viduals with AD.28 Thus, our results could reﬂect the impact
of unemployment-related stress in the limbic system. On the
contrary, it is possible that the association of unemployment
with lower brain structure could be explained by lower levels
of cognitive stimulation.29 Previous research has shown an
association between higher education and higher gray matter
volumes in the cingulate among cognitively unimpaired
individuals.30 It is also well documented that unemployment
is associated with an increased dementia risk and has a nega-
tive impact on mental health, particularly among men.31

the association between un-
employment and lower brain structure might be driven by
men and those with a higher educational level as supported by
stratiﬁed and interaction analyses. Men might be more af-
fected by unemployment and consequent ﬁnancial strain
because of cultural expectations of men generally being the
breadwinners and stigmatization being stronger against un-
employed men compared with unemployed women.32 Fur-
thermore,
those with a lower educational
level—and often fewer ﬁnancial resources—already have
higher levels of stress and unemployment, whereas those
more highly educated are at lower risk of unemployment9 and
the impact of unemployment may be thus greater, explaining
our results.

in general,

We further found that having experienced ﬁnancial loss is
associated with lower gray matter volume in the frontoparietal
lobe. Because these results are novel, they are diﬃcult to
compare with previous research. However, they are in line
with evidence showing ﬁnancial hardship to be associated
with lower volumes of the amygdala and hippocampus in the
general population.33 Our stratiﬁed analyses showed that the
association of experiencing ﬁnancial loss with lower brain
structure could be driven by women. This could be due to
sociocultural aspects that lead to inequities between men and
women. Historically, women have had less access to education
and the workforce, occupations have been segregated by
gender, and women often face discrimination in the work-
place that can lead to excess stress and reduced income.34
Indeed, it has been found that women stress about their
ﬁnances more, aﬀecting their mental health, compared with
men.35 Furthermore, women, compared with men, are more
likely to ﬁll roles that are considered unpaid labor, such as
caregiver roles.

Taken together, speciﬁc stressors, notably grief-related and
economic-related stressors, seem to aﬀect AD pathophysiol-
ogy and brain structure, respectively. Exposure to SLEs may
increase AD vulnerability through multiple mechanisms, for
example, through physiologic changes, taking place in the
immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems. Stress acti-
vates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis releasing glu-
cocorticoids that can cause structural brain damage.36,37
Furthermore, exposure to SLEs might increase unhealthy
behaviors, such as smoking, which themselves are associated
with an increased AD risk.38 In addition, exposure to stressors
can increase negative aﬀect, such as depressive symptoms.39
Indeed, SLEs have a substantial causal association with major
depression, which is also associated with higher AD risk.38
The observed gender diﬀerences could be explained by dif-
ferential cultural expectations and gender roles. Conversely,
there are established sex diﬀerences in the stress response
explained by gonadal hormone eﬀects and sex chromosomes
that could account for some of the sex and gender diﬀerences
found in our study.40,41

The strengths of this study include the life-course evaluation
of SLEs and the large sample size that allowed the stratiﬁca-
tion of analyses. Several limitations also do exist. These in-
clude the cross-sectional design, calling for future studies to
investigate the change in AD pathophysiologic markers and
brain structure in relation to SLEs. The possibility of reverse
causality with some of the SLEs exists, for example, severe
ﬁnancial loss, where individuals in the AD continuum might be
more inclined to engage with risky ﬁnancial decisions. Fur-
thermore, we cannot exclude the possibility of recall bias,
especially regarding early life events. However, the events
were evaluated through a structured interview translating to
lower possibility of bias compared with traditional SLE
checklists, and we found good test-retest correlation within
our study. We did not consider the salience, duration, timing,
type of events. Future studies would beneﬁt
from
or

examining whether the timing or age at which speciﬁc SLEs
are experienced is important.42 Furthermore, this study fo-
cused on gender as a self-reported and self-identiﬁed binary
category (i.e., woman/man), and it was presumed that all
participants were cisgender. Therefore,
in this study, the
speciﬁc distinction between biological sex and gender was not
explicitly investigated. Finally, the study sample consisted
primarily of participants who identiﬁed as White, limiting the
generalizability of the results to other populations. It is im-
portant to note that race and ethnicity data were not collected
in a standardized manner, requiring participants to select from
a combined set of race and ethnicity categories. Future re-
search examining whether these results generalize to indi-
viduals from more diverse backgrounds is needed.

Our ﬁndings provide novel evidence suggesting that lifetime
exposure to grief-related and economic-related SLEs may af-
fect brain health. We demonstrate that the death of a partner
is associated with AD pathophysiology and that un-
employment and ﬁnancial loss are associated with reduced
gray matter volume, and that the strength of these associations
level. Psychosocial
depends on gender and educational
interventions may represent strategies to improve stress
coping among these susceptible groups identiﬁed in our
study. Future research is warranted to replicate these results
and to reﬁne the risk proﬁles that would most beneﬁt from
these interventions, as well as to explore the optimal timing
for these interventions.
