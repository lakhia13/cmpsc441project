Abstract

The  coming  years  are  likely  to  be  turbulent  due  to  a  myriad  of  factors  or  polycrisis, 
including  an  escalation  in  climate  extremes,  emerging  public  health  threats,  weak  productivity, 
increases  in  global  economic  instability  and  further  weakening  in  the  integrity  of  global 
democracy. These formidable challenges are not exogenous to the economy but are in some cases 
generated by the system itself. They can be overcome, but only with far-reaching changes to global 
economics.  Our  current  socio-economic  paradigm  is  insufficient  for  addressing  these  complex 
challenges,  let  alone  sustaining  human  development,  well-being  and  happiness.  To  support  the 
flourishing  of  the  global  population  in  the  age  of  polycrisis,  we  need  a  novel,  person-centred  and 
collective  paradigm.  The  brain  economy  leverages  insights  from  neuroscience  to  provide  a  novel 
way of centralising the human contribution to the economy, how the economy in turn shapes our 
lives  and  positive  feedbacks  between  the  two.  The  brain  economy  is  primarily  based  on  Brain 
Capital, an economic asset integrating brain health and brain skills, the social, emotional, and the 
diversity of cognitive brain resources of individuals and communities. People with healthy brains 
are  essential  to  navigate  increasingly  complex  systems.  Policies  and  investments  that  improve 
brain  health  and  hence  citizens’  cognitive  functions  and  boost  brain  performance  can  increase 
productivity,  stimulate  greater  creativity  and  economic  dynamism,  utilise  often  underdeveloped 
intellectual  resources,  afford  social  cohesion,  and  create  a  more  resilient,  adaptable  and 
sustainability-engaged population.

Introduction

The 

term 

economy’  was 
‘knowledge 
first  coined  in  the  1960s  by  Peter  Drucker.  A 
knowledge  economy  is  a  system  where  goods 
and  services  are  produced  based  on  knowledge-
intensive activities. It is an economic system that 
relies more on intellectual property than natural 
resources or tangible assets. 

Much  has  changed  since 

the  1960s, 
however.  Today,  the  knowledge  economy  is 
increasingly  driven  by  generative  artificial 
intelligence 
(AI)-based  knowledge.  Further, 
current  economic  systems  have  failed  to  turn 
around  low  productivity  growth.  Productivity 
is  key  to  the  wealth  of  nations  and  their  living 
standards  (1).  With  higher  productivity,  such 
problems  as  budget  deficits,  poverty  reduction, 
healthcare and the environment become far more 
manageable.  Boosting  productivity  growth  is  a 
fundamental economic challenge.

The  brain  economy,  therefore,  offers  a  new 
opportunity. It integrates the latest insights from 
the  knowledge  economy  while  making  primary 
Brain  Capital  and  other  vital  brain  science-
based  social,  technology,  economic  and  policy 
dynamics.  These  are  all  new  levers  to  boost 
productivity.  

Brain  Capital 

is  gaining  traction  as  a 
framework  that  explains  why  human  brains, 
both  individually  and  collectively,  are  at  the 
centre  of  society’s  future  and  prosperity  (2). 
Brain  Capital  is  inherently  transdisciplinary, 
combining  academic,  policy,  corporate,  health 
and  education  interests,  towards  a  common 
goal.  It  aligns  and  consolidates  disparate 
academic,  professional,  and  business  disciplines 
and  provides  a  basis  for  integrated  systems 
understanding,  policy, 
investment,  economic 
and  coordination  (3).  We  seek  to  establish 
Brain  Capital  as  a  fundamental  national  asset, 
as  important  as  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP) 
and road infrastructure in the eyes of society and 
politicians. 

In  this  paper,  we  provide  further  reasons 
why  the  brain  economy  is  a  vital  new  paradigm 
spanning  brain  science-inspired  technological, 
economic and financial innovations. See Figure 1 
for a graphical overview.

There  are  a  range  of  new  breakthroughs

methods,  including  polygenic  risk  scores  and 
novel  techniques  (i.e.  long  reads),  are  now 
helping  to  predict  the  development  of  certain 
psychiatric  and  neurological  conditions,  offering 
novel  insights  into  measures  that  can  prevent 
brain  disorders  and  slow  the  progression  of 
disease  and  cognitive  decline.  Human  neural

understanding of the brain. Finally, technological 
advancements  in  machine  learning  and  AI  allow 
us to capture vast data-sets and through analysis 
with  the  appropriate  computational  methods,  to 
uncover  novel  insights  of  the  human  brain  and 
its diseases. 

Several  of  these  advancements  in  brain 
and  mind  science  were  possible  through  the 
concerted  contribution  and  collaboration  of 
relevant  stakeholders  such  as  neuroscientists, 
policy  makers  and  research  centers  within  the 
framework  of  country,  regional  and  continental 
brain  initiatives  (5).  Nevertheless,  there  are  still 
several fundamental questions on brain structure 
and  function  that  remain  elusive,  including  the 
mechanisms  subserving  brain-derived  emergent 
properties  such  as  perception,  cognition  and 
innovations  and 
behaviour.  Extending  these 
applying  these 
learnings  across  traditionally 
underserved  communities  is  also  an  ongoing 
priority.  In  Box  1  we  show  updates  from  the 
(DAC) 
Davos  Alzheimer’s  Collaborative’s 
Malaysia  programme.  To  leverage  and  capitalise 
on the brain economy, further public and private 
investment in brain science is critical.

Box 1. DAC’s Malaysia programme

This  is  the  first  international  cohort  to  deploy  the  DAC  minimal  viable  protocol,  which  exemplifies 
how  DAC  tapped  ubiquitous  research  methods  to  promote  brain  health.  DAC  capitalises  on  the  worldwide 
penetration  of  tablets  and  smartphones,  along  with  the  collection  of  blood  to  collect  data  that  is  feasible  by 
anyone,  anywhere.  Application  of  deep  machine  learning  and  AI  analytics  to  these  data  will  likely  accelerate 
the  identification  of  causes,  predispositions  and  prevention  factors  that  will  translate  into  rapid  drug 
discovery, clinical care and disease prevention. Current estimates indicate that 8.5% of Malaysians aged over 
60 years old have dementia, resulting in an estimated dementia population of 260,345.

The  conduct  of  brain  health  assessments  is  already  underway  through  a  DAC  collaborative  effort  that 
includes  Dr.  Rhoda  Au  and  colleagues  from  Boston  University  and  the  research  team  in  Malaysia.  DAC 
anticipates  that  the  study  design  and  learnings  can  serve  as  a  model  across  the  world,  contributing  to  the 
overarching goals of building support for the brain economy. One research finding that is likely the first of its 
kind is voice analysis of a similar test given in U.S. English, Malay, English, Mandarin, Cantonese evidenced 
high  degree  of  similarity  in  feature  correlation  patterns  and  factor  structures—suggesting  the  potential  for  a 
common measure of cognition across multiple languages.

The application of smartphone technology for accurately detecting brain-related changes and predicting 
Alzheimer’s  disease  is  revolutionising  the  study  of  brain  health.  Unlike  traditional  neuropsychological 
assessments,  which  are  limited  by  cost,  participant  burden  and  administration  by  trained  examiners, 
smartphone  applications  provide  a  more  flexible  and  frequent  monitoring  option  that  people  can  do  on 
their own and in their home. This approach offers an effective, cost-efficient and scalable means of detecting 
significant  changes  in  cognitive  and  other  brain  related  functions  earlier  and  more  accurately  during  the 
preclinical neurodegenerative process. To date, Malaysia has collected both digital data and blood from about 
535 participants, with plans to try and achieve 1,200 participants over the next year.

High and Rising Global Burden of Brain 
Disorders 

Brain  disorders,  including  mental  illness 
and  neurologic  conditions  like  dementia  and 
stroke,  account  for  more  than  15%  of  all  health-
related  disability  worldwide—more  than  either 
cardiovascular  disease  or  cancer.  This  comes  at 
a  huge  cost  to  healthcare  systems  and  society, 
according  to  an  analysis  of  data  from  the 
most  recent  Global  Burden  of  Disease  (GBD) 
study  presented  recently  at  the  Congress  of 
the  European  Academy  of  Neurology  (EAN 
2023)  (6).  Data  from  the  Brain  Health  Atlas, 
powered  by  the  Institute  for  Health  Metrics  and 
Evaluation,  suggest  this  burden  will  increase  in 
coming  years,  which  is  clearly  unsustainable  to 
the global economy given the yearly cost is in the 
trillions  -  in  effect  this  will  reduce  the  economic 
security  of  nations  (7).  The  universality  and 
ubiquity  of  these  disorders,  from  psychiatric 
to  neurological  conditions  (8)  and  aggravated 
by  the  publicly  known  stress  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic,    negatively  impacting  on  two  of  the 
more common forms of mental disorders, anxiety 
and  depression,  as  well  as  suicide,  are  some 
reasons why there is increasing public discussion 
on these issues. 

AI is Manipulating Minds on a Massive Scale 

Beyond  the  positive  benefits  of  AI  to  help 
us  generate  new  understanding  of  the  human 
brain  for  the  treatment  of  brain  disorders  (9), 
there  are  increasing  capabilities  of  AI-based 
algorithms to negatively influence human minds, 
communications  and  behaviour.  This  is  best 
seen  via  social  media  platforms,  whose  use, 
at  times,  is  associated  with  worsening  youth 
mental health (10, 11) and by malign actors who 
prolifically  disseminate  mis-  and  disinformation 
(particularly  wedge  political 
and  health 
misinformation) (12). 

Current 

advanced 

algorithms 

are 
primarily  text-based.  The  technology  industry 
is  currently  shifting  towards  real-time  voice 
and  photorealistic  digital  personas  that  can 
increasingly  look,  move  and  express  like  real 
people.  These  algorithms  are  thus  predicted 
to  become  much  more  effective  at  influencing 
humans  (13).  Given  the  rapid  progress  of 
generative  AI,  the  future  internet  is  bound 
to  be  more  interactive,  for  better  but  also  for 
worse.  This  is  concerning  and  has  led  Yuval 
Noah  Harari,  a  renowned  scholar  and  author, 
to  warn  about  the  ability  of  AI  to  hack  our 
human  operating  system  within  the  digital

AI is Making Work Hyper-Cognitively Intense

Rapid  advancements  in  generative  AI  are 
set  to  reshape  society,  revolutionise  industries 
and  change  the  nature  and  future  of  work  (22). 
Estimates  by  the  Brookings  Institution  (23) 
suggest  that  in  the  US  alone,  approximately 
60%  of  work  tasks  are  facing  medium  to 
high  exposure  to  displacement  by  AI  in  the 
coming  decades.  Work  will  therefore  become 
increasingly  cognitively  intense  as  workers  learn 
how to integrate AI into their daily practices and 
refocus  on  high  level  conceptual  and  strategic 
priorities  given  that  AI  can  do  much  repetitive 
and mundane work (24).

is 

While 

society  has  made 
true 
tremendous  progress  in recent decades  (25), the 
convergent  issues  of  climate  change,  political 
instability,  wars,  mis-  and  disinformation 
escalation  have  led  some  experts  to  describe  the 
world as in a ‘polycrisis’ (26). A number of these 
issues  are  set  to  become  increasingly  acute  in 
the  coming  years,  such  as  climate  change  and 
disinformation  increases.  These  changes  will 
resonate  with  and  amplify  the  other  threats  and 
innovations  discussed  in  this  paper.  Climate 
change  itself  with  weather  extremes,  increased 
air  pollution  and  plastic  pollution  are  known 
to  undermine  brain  health  (27).  A  recent  study 
showed  large-scale  societal  dynamics are related 
to  brain  structure  and  function.  Lebedev  et  al. 
large-scale  United  Kingdom 
(28)  correlated 
biobank  data  over  14  years  with  the  local  stock 
market  index  (FTSE1000)  and  residents’  mood. 
They  showed  maximal  stock  market  volatility

affective  brain  regions.  These  types  of  analyses 
may  continue  to  yield  findings  between  major 
societal  challenges  and  population  level  brain 
dynamics.

Neuroscience Unlocks Personalised Education 
Approaches Across the Lifespan 

The 

application 

of  neuroscience 

in 
unlocking  personalised  education  approaches 
across  the  lifespan  is  crucial  for  society  as  it 
fosters  an  inclusive  learning  environment  that 
respects  individual  differences  and  optimises 
educational  outcomes.  Moreover,  it  empowers 
individuals  to  reach  their  full  potential,  thereby 
contributing  to  societal  progress  and  innovation 
through  the  cultivation  of  a  diverse,  skilled  and 
adaptable  workforce.  Neuroimaging  techniques 
that  have  been  traditionally  used  in  the  medical 
sector  are  increasingly  being  applied  to  study 
the  neurobiology  of  learning  (15).  By  combining 
non-invasive,  portable,  wireless,  and  more  and 
more  handheld  and  relative  low-cost  features, 
electroencephalography 
technologies 
and 
spectroscopy 
are  making  possible  to  monitor  learning  in 
real  time  with  increasing  ecological  validity, 
i.e.  in  naturalistic  educational  settings  (16). 
Educational  applications  of  such  technologies 
include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  describing  brain 
changes in learning via structural and functional 
measures (17), characterising brain dynamics for 
typical  and  atypical  learning  trajectories  (18), 
identifying  biomarkers  to  support  the  diagnosis 
of  learning  disorders  using  neuroanatomical 
variations  (19),  detecting  inter  brain-to-brain 
synchronisation  through  hyperscanning  studies 
(20)  and  predicting  educational  outcomes 
combining brain parameters and modeling (21).

interprofessional 

To  respond  to  the  high  and  rising  burden 
of brain disorders, many countries are exploring 
their  own  nation-wide,  systemic  brain  health 
plans. For example, the Swiss Brain Health Plan 
(29)  was  recently  launched  with  the  vision  for 
promoting  brain  health  for  all  across  the  entire 
life  course.  The  five  key  strategic  objectives 
are:  i)  to  raise  awareness;  ii)  strengthen  cross-
training/
disciplinary  and 
educational 
healthcare 
professionals; iii) foster research on brain health 
individualised  prevention 
determinants  and 
iv)  prioritise  a  holistic 
of  brain  disorders; 
(non-disease-specific), 
person-
centered  public  health  approach  to  promote 
brain  health  and  prevent  brain  disorders 
through  collaborations  across  scientific,  health 
care,  commercial,  societal  and  governmental 
stakeholders  and 
insurance  providers;  v) 
engage  patients, 
and 
support, 
caregivers, and patient organisations, and reduce 
the  stigma  and  discrimination  related  to  brain 
disorders.  Other  countries  have  implemented 
such  plans,  including  Norway,  Finland  and 
Germany.  These  country-wide  brain  plans  open 
up  opportunities  for  new  clinical  pathways  and 
clinical  instruments.  The  Brain  Care  Score  is 
one  such  tool,  a  motivational,  multidimensional 
tool for use in primary care for stroke, dementia 
and  depression  prevention  and  management 
(30).  Recent  analyses  of  this  Score  from  the 
UK  Biobank  showed  individuals  with  a  higher 
score  had  a  lower  risk  of  developing  dementia 
or  having  a  stroke  later  in  life.  Other  innovative 
clinical  approaches  include  the  development 
of  a  field  of  brain  medicine  (31),  preventive 
neuroscience  (32),  preventive  neuroradiology 
(33)  and  other  recommendations  from  the 
European Task for Brain Health Sciences (34).

National Well-being Accounting Frameworks 
are Increasingly being Implemented 

Well-being  accounting  frameworks  have 
gained  prominence  as  nations  seek  to  measure 
societal  progress  beyond  GDP.  The  OECD  and 
World  Bank  have  developed  guidelines  for  these 
frameworks, 
emphasising  multidimensional 
aspects  of  well-being  (35).  These  initiatives 
reflect a shift towards comprehensive assessment 
of  national  well-being.  For  example,  Scotland 
has  developed  a  comprehensive  well-being 
framework  known  as  the  National  Performance 
Framework (NPF) (36). This framework includes 
‘increased  well-being’  as  part  of  its  purpose  and

combines  economic  measures  with  a  broader 
range  of  well-being  measures.  It  sets  out  the 
direction  and  ambition  for  Scotland  with  11

in  2019,  providing  a  guide  for  ethical  and  legal 
challenges in neurotechnology (37). In 2021, the 
Chilean  Parliament  modified  the  Constitution 
and became the first nation in the world to have 
a  constitution  in  force  that  explicitly  addresses 
the  challenges  of  emerging  neurotechnologies 
(38).  UNESCO  held  a  conference  on  the  Ethics 
of  Neurotechnology  in  2023,  emphasising  the 
need  for  a  governance  framework  to  harness 
neurotechnology’s  potential  and address  societal 
risks.  Both  organisations  stress  the  importance

of 
frameworks in neurotechnology.

Understanding Cognitive Warfare is a Priority 
in Global Politics, Strategy and Security 

and/or 

and  behaviours  by 
disrupting 

The  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization 
that  cognitive 
(NATO)  notes  concerningly 
warfare  is  a  key  new 
‘battleground’  among 
nations  (39).  Specifically,  the  NATO  Strategic 
Warfare  Development  Command  defines  this 
as  ‘the  activities  conducted  in  synchronisation 
with  other  instruments  of  power,  to  affect 
influencing, 
attitudes 
protecting, 
individual 
and  group  cognitions  to  gain  an  advantage’. 
Think  of  scrambling  the  enemy’s  sense  of 
reality:  rampant  disinformation  to  sow  enemy 
confusion, degrading their mental resilience and 
provoking them to lose trust in their government 
and  society.  Scientists  recently  explored  the 
connections  between  misinformation  and  the 
epistemic  integrity  of  democracy  (40).  They 
noted that democracy relies on a shared body of 
knowledge  among  citizens,  in  particular,  trust 
in  elections  and  reliable  expertise  to  inform 
policy-relevant  debates.  In  their  review,  they 
note  how  mis-  and  disinformation  campaigns 
are  undermining  shared  knowledge  and  they 
outline  ways  psychology  can  contribute  to 
countermeasures,  e.g.  regulation,  media  literacy 
education  and  inoculation.  The  vulnerabilities 
of  our  cognitive  processes  are  laid  bare,  raising 
concerns  about  the  ethical 
implications  of 
such  manipulation.  Countries  must  now  take 
steps  to  prepare  their  citizens  for  such  types  of

of  brain  health  and  well-being  to  the  national 
security of their nations (42). 

Brain Capital Can Drive Progress Towards the 
Sustainable Development Goals 

transformative  nature 

The  UN  published  a  progress  report  in 
July  of  2023,  in  which  it  warned  that  the  SDGs 
were  ‘in  peril’,  with  a  mere  12%  of  targets  on 
track  (43).  We  recently  published  a  report 
noting  how  Brain  Capital  can  contribute  to 
all  of  these  goals  through  its  human-centric, 
systemic  and 
(27). 
Crucial  to  being  inclusive  in  brain  research  is 
leveraging  innovation  to  drive  down  costs—so 
implementation of new brain health applications 
are  accessible  in  low-resourced  settings.  Brain 
Capital provides a lens for dealing with economic 
strain,  productivity  slowdown,  sustainability, 
gender  equity,  creativity  shortcomings,  mental 
health and well-being, erosion of the social fabric 
of communities and the need for more industrial 
innovation. 

Brain Science-inspired Private Sector 
Dynamics

Brain and Mind Start-up Activity is on the Rise 

There 

is  a  burgeoning  mental  health 
venture  capital  industry  searching  for  scalable 
brain  health  solutions  (44).  The  level  of  yearly 
venture  capital  investment  into  mental  health 
start-ups went from very minor to around USD5 
billion  in  2021.  Levels  have  now  reduced  post-
COVID  but  remain  in  the  multiple  billions  per 
year.  An  example  of  a  mechanism  to  support 
the development of this area of innovation is the 
One  Mind  Accelerator  which  provides  services, 
guidance  and  funding  to  support  founders  of 
early-stage brain health technology start-ups. 

The  traditional  VC  model  drives  profits 
over  health  outcomes,  such  that  investments 
are  not  likely  to  generate  a  future  of  effective 
mental  health  solutions.  We,  therefore,  recently 
proposed the need for a dedicated public-private 
industrial  innovation  strategy  to  support  the 
sustainable  and  impact-oriented  nature  of  this 
field  of  innovation  (43).  Industrial  innovation

innovation.  We  must  consider  creating  a 
dedicated  technology  platform  to  support  early-
stage  developments,  acceleration  of  start-ups, 
guaranteed  contracts  for  production  to  parallel 
development,  flexible  contracting  mechanisms 
for 
issues, 
technology  certification  that  assured  prompt 
market  entry,  and  mapping  and  filling  supply

Private Companies are Collecting and Using 
Vast Amounts of Personal Data

The  prominent  neuroscience  lawyer,  Nita 
Farahany  PhD  (45),  has  well  documented  how 
private  companies  are  collecting  and  using  vast 
amounts  of  personal  data.  Given  advances  in 
brain  technology,  these  data  have  the  ability  to 
reduce  our  cognitive  liberty,  the  right  to  self-
determination  over  one’s  brain  and  mental 
the  aforementioned 
experiences.  Therefore, 
regulatory 
responsible 
frameworks  for  neurotechnology  are  vital  to 
safeguard neural sovereignty.

Private Companies Increasingly Investing in 
Employee Brain Health 

increasingly 

Employers  are 

focused  on 
the  mental  health  and  well-being  of  employees, 
with  some  reports  estimating  90%  or  more  of 
employers  investing  more  in  mental  health  and 
well-being  programmes  (46).  While  some  of 
this  new  focus,  particularly  on  mental  health, 
is  driven  by  employee  demand,  employers  are 
increasingly  recognising  the  impact  of  brain 
health  on  workforce  productivity,  retention 
and  overall  business  success  (47).  Several 
employer  initiatives,  for  example,  the  Business 
Collaborative for Brain Health and work done by 
the international design firm HKS, Inc. (48), are 
now  recognising  that  a  broader  focus  on  brain 
may  be  an  effective  framework  to  address  the 
skills gap. Topping the World Economic Forum’s 
list  of  skills  most  needed  are  problem-solving, 
critical  thinking,  creativity,  analytical  reasoning, 
learning agility, cognitive flexibility and complex 
problem-solving (49). Taking a broader approach 
to brain health merges the need for whole-health 
approaches, effective mental health solutions and 
a  workforce  equipped  with  the  cognitive  skills 
for the future  economy—building  more resilient, 
prepared human capital.

In Table 1, we outline our recommendations 

to advance the brain economy movement.

Table 1. Recommendations to advance the brain economy

Investments

To  better  unlock  understanding  and  new  approaches  to  managing  our  brains,  we  require  much  more 

investment in brain science, neurotechnology, start-ups, health and educational systems. 

We  recommend  not  just  to  consider  conventional  investment  approaches  which  are  purely  profit-
seeking,  but  also  other  impact-oriented  and  longer-term  approaches.  For  example,  public-private-
philanthropic  partnership  models  are  engineered  to  tackle  challenges  requiring  deep,  system-level 
transformation,  which  in  turn  require  patience,  an  understanding  of  the  needs  and  constraints  of  a  broad 
set  of  actors,  the  ability  to  bring  these  actors  together  around  well-defined  objectives,  the  willingness  to 
take  a  longer-term  perspective,  the  capacity  to  run  a  robust  day-to-day  operation,  and  an  appetite  for 
experimentation.  4P  models  aligned  to  the  brain  economy  include  the  Baycrest  Centre  for  Brain  Health  and 
Aging, the Davos Alzhiemer’s Collaborative, the Ontario Brain Institute and the UCSF Dyslexia Center. Such 
models must be assessed and developed across the lifespan and in health and skill domains. 

We also encourage the development of novel industrial innovation strategies, as outlined in text. 
Finally,  moving  forward,  we  will  need  longer-term  forms  of  investing  and  we  suggest  that  impact 
investors  with  more  ‘patient  capital’  (e.g.  a  10–20  year  time  horizon  such  as  public  pension  funds  and 
sovereign wealth funds) are better suited for effective brain capital investments compared to politicians with a 
2-to-5-year time horizon and venture capital’s 5-to-7-year time horizon.

We  note  the  Japanese  Government’s  MIRAI  Moonshot  Project  has  bold  ambitions  for  transformative 
society enhancing technologies for 2050. Their Goal 9 aims to realise a mentally healthy society by increasing 
peace of mind and vitality by 2050.  

Policy innovation

Infusing brain science into public policy is a key component of the transition to the brain economy. If the 
brain economy is to be comprehensive, we must therefore consider brain science innovation in all policy areas, 
from healthcare, to nature, to digital, foreign affairs, built environment, sustainability and social services. For 
example, we have previously extensively profiled the importance of reforms to the industrialised food system 
which is currently undermining population-level Brain Capital (50). 

Continuing to advance the regulatory and responsible innovation neurotechnology frameworks outlined 

in this paper are vital. 

We  must  also  explore  the  development  of  some  kind  of  Brain  Capital  Pact,  to  enable  extensive, 
international  collaboration  towards  a  transformative  impact  of  brain  capital.  Such  a  collaboration  should  be 
‘neural’—a  constellation  of  inter-dependent  regions,  nodes  and  pathways,  bridging  and  activating  between 
sectors, disciplines, systems and jurisdictions, inc sub-national. Given Brain Capital’s cross-cutting nature, it 
is  ideally  placed  to  serve  as  a  platform  for  defining  the  post-UN  Sustainable  Development  Goal  (SDG)  post-
2030  framework.  Such  a  pact  must  consider  cross-government  coordination  and  supporting  policies,  the 
role of public-private partnerships in fostering economic prosperity and social wellness, and new models for 
mental well-being. It must consider the concept of a global parliamentary working group on brain health and 
the brain-based economy driven by large middle-income countries (India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria).

Measurement

Further refinement of the recently released Global Brain Capital Dashboard is key to advancing the brain 

economy transition (51). 

To  build  the  complete  Dashboard,  novel  indicators  were  extracted  from  a  wide  range  of  data  sources 
under the banner of three pillars: Brain Capital Drivers, Brain Health and Brain Skills. Brain Capital Drivers 
refers to the factors that boost or impede the accumulation of brain capital throughout the life course. Some of 
these factors include digitalisation, health services, the natural environment, education and social connections. 
Brain Health examines the mental and neurological health of the population at scale. The domain chronicles 
the  absence  of  disorders,  as  well  as  different  issues  throughout  the  human  lifespan  (childhood,  adolescence 
and  aging-related  issues).  The  Brain  Skills  domain  captures  key  areas  for  the  accumulation  of  Brain  Capital 
such as cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, mental flourishing and mental resilience.

The  concept  of  a  brain  economy  is  not  just 
timely  but  critical  for  addressing  the  complex 
challenges  of  the  21st  century.  Traditional 
paradigms are insufficient as the world struggles 
with  unprecedented  socio-economic,  democratic 
and  environmental  stressors.  Integrating  Brain 
framework 
Capital 
may  have  a  transformative  impact,  leveraging 

into  a  novel  economic 

intrinsically  human  resources  to  foster  a  more 
resilient,  innovative,  empathic  and  prosperous 
collaborative  efforts  of  our 
society.  The 
transdisciplinary  group  bridging  disciplines 
and  sectors  are  crucial 
this 
movement  forward.  As  we  move  into  2024,  we 
must  continue  to  invest  and  capitalise  on  brain 
science,  develop  and  test  policies  and  financing 

in  propelling
