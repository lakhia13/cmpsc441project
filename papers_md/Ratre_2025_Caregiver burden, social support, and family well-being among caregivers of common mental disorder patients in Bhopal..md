Caregiver burden, social support, and 
family well‑being among caregivers of 
common mental disorder patients in 
Bhopal

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders (CMDs) are distress states manifesting with anxiety, 
depression, and unexplained somatic symptoms. CMD patients require care and attention, which 
places additional demands on the caregivers and the family members. This study aimed to determine 
the caregiver burden, social support, and family well‑being among caregivers of CMD patients in 
Bhopal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross‑sectional survey was held among 236 caregivers of CMD 
patients  presenting  to  a  tertiary  healthcare  center  in  Bhopal.  Primary  caregivers  aged  18  years 
and above and providing care for more than 1 month were included. Data were collected through 
interviews by using the sociodemographic proforma, Zarit burden interview scale, multidimensional 
scale of perceived social support, and family health scale.
RESULT:  About  31.3%  of  caregivers  had  a  high  burden,  53%  had  a  mild‑to‑moderate  burden, 
and 15.7% had a no‑to‑mild burden. Most caregivers (75.8%) perceived moderate social support, 
and 15.7% perceived high social support. A total of 48.3% of caregivers rated family well‑being as 
moderate, 45.8% as poor, and only 5.9% as excellent. Perceived social support and family well‑being 
showed a moderate, positive relationship (r = 0.584, P < 0.01), and both accounted for 18.5% of the 
variance in the caregiver burden. Perceived social support (r = −0.384) and family well‑being (r = 
−0.394) demonstrated an inverse relationship with caregiver burden (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: There is a need to enhance social support for caregivers and the family well‑being 
of CMD patients. Healthcare providers at all levels should identify the need for social support for 
caregivers and plan suitable strategies for family‑centered care of CMD patients.

Introduction

Common mental disorders (CMD) refer 

to a group of psychiatric conditions that 
are widespread and significantly impact an 
individual’s functioning and quality of life. 
Depression and anxiety disorders, which are 
commonly classified as CMD.[1] CMD is the 
transient feeling of sadness, stress, or fear 
everyone may encounter at various points 
in life. According to the WHO, 970 million

people around the world were living with 
a  mental  disorder  in  the  year  2019,  with 
anxiety  and  depressive  disorders  being 
the  most  common.  A  total  of  56  million 
Indians suffer from depression, and another 
38 million suffer from anxiety disorders.[2] 
Depression is a major contributor to mental 
illness in India. As late adolescence and early 
adulthood  are  crucial  periods  for  making 
important  life  decisions,  young  people 
transitioning to adulthood are particularly 
susceptible to mental disorders.[3]

The  overall  weighted  current  prevalence  of  CMD 
among  Indian  adults  was  5.1%  (70  million),  and 
the  lifetime  prevalence  of  depressive  disorder, 
phobic  anxiety  disorder,  other  anxiety  disorders, 
o b s e s s i v e ‑ c o m p u l s i v e   d i s o r d e r   ( O C D ) ,   a n d 
post‑traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  was  5.3%, 
3.7%,  1.3%,  0.8%,  and  0.2%,  respectively.[4]  National 
Mental  Health  Survey  2015–16  reports  that  the 
lifetime  prevalence  of  depressive  disorder,  phobic 
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety 
disorder, other anxiety disorders, and OCD in Madhya 
Pradesh was 4.18%, 1.4%, 0.3%, 0.15%, 0.64%, and 0.4%, 
respectively.[5]

Living  with  and  caring  for  an  individual  with  a 
psychiatric  disorder  seems  inherently  stressful. [6] 
Koujalgi et al.[7] (2021) reported a notably high level of 
family care burden among caregivers of individuals with 
chronic  mental  disorders.  Evidence  from  developed 
nations suggests that over 70% of individuals providing 
care  for  those  with  mental  illness  encounter  a  sense 
of  burden.  Almost  40%  of  primary  caregivers  for 
individuals  with  mental  health  issues  experience  this 
burden due to the responsibilities associated with caring 
for the patient. Family members could not go to work 
because  of  the  care  of  the  patient,  and  the  treatment 
gap  among  the  mentally  ill  was  huge  (90.7%). [5] 
Caregivers  encountered  challenges  such  as  assisting 
the  patient  with  self‑care  activities  such  as  cooking, 
eating,  maintaining  personal  hygiene,  and  grooming. 
They are also responsible for tasks related to treatment, 
such as visiting physicians, administering medication, 
and protecting the patient from engaging in high‑risk 
behaviors  such  as  aggression,  violence,  substance 
abuse, and risky sexual activities. These challenges are 
encompassed  under  the  term  “numerous  caregiving 
tasks.”[8]

Study novelty
As there was no data on the caregiver burden, perceived 
social support, or family well‑being status of caregivers 
of  CMD  patients  in  the  Bhopal  district  of  Madhya 
Pradesh,  India,  a  study  was  planned  to  generate 
evidence in this direction. This study is a first of a kind 
in Madhya Pradesh measuring family well‑being status 
among  caregivers  of  CMD  patients.  The  study  aimed 
to  assess  the  relationship  between  caregiver  burden, 
social  support,  and  family  well‑being  of  caregivers  of 
CMD patients.

Materials and Methods

Study design and setting
The present study was a cross‑sectional survey among 
caregivers  of  CMD  patients  presenting  to  a  1400‑bed 
government tertiary care hospital in Madhya Pradesh.

Theoretical framework
The  foundation  of  this  study’s  conceptual  framework 
draws upon the principles of General System Theory, 
as  articulated  by  Ludwig  Von  Bertalanffy  in  1968. 
The framework encompasses key components such as 
input, process, output, and feedback. In this conceptual 
framework, a system is defined as a collection of elements 
that  collaborate  to  attain  a  specific  objective  through 
interactions. The conceptual framework is presented in 
Figure 1.

Study participants and sampling
Caregivers aged 18 years and above, residing with and 
providing care to CMD patients for more than 1 month, 
without a history of mental illness in the past, able to 
respond  in  Hindi  or  English  language,  and  willing  to 
participate  in  the  study  were  included.  The  sample 
size  was  calculated  using  the  formula  (n  =  z2  p*q/d2) 
based  on  the  lifetime  prevalence  of  mental  morbidity 
and  current  mental  disorders  in  the  state  of  Madhya 
Pradesh (16.7%)[5] and the margin of error as 0.05. The 
estimated  sample  size,  considering  the  non‑response 
rate of 10%, was 236. A convenience sampling technique 
was used.

Ethical considerations
Ethical  clearance  was  obtained  from  the  institutional 
human ethical committee (Ref No.: IHEC‑SR/July/22/
MSc  Nursing/26).  Caregivers  meeting  the  inclusion 
criteria  were  explained  the  purpose  of  the  study,  and 
informed consent was obtained. Privacy, anonymity, and 
confidentiality of the data were assured and maintained.

Data collection: Tools and techniques
Data were collected from October 2, 2023 to November 8, 
2023 through interviews in a separate room (Psychiatry 
OPD/ward). The total time taken for the interview was 
30–35 minutes. The following tools were used:
a.  Sociodemographic  proforma:  The  first  section  of 
this  questionnaire  included  questions  related  to 
caregivers’  age  (in  years),  gender,  marital  status, 
educational  status,  religion,  relationship  with 
the  patient,  residential  area,  employment  status, 
occupation, family income per month, and attendance 
in any training program on the care of a person with 
mental illness.

  The  second  part  included  information  on  CMD 
patients’  age,  gender,  and  diagnosis,  which  were 
filled by reviewing patient’s charts.

b.  Zarit  burden  interview  scale:  This  standardized 
12‑item  interview  scale  measures  subjective  and 
objective  caregiver  burdens  and  items  are  rated 
on  five  points:  never  (0),  rarely  (1),  sometimes  (2), 
frequently (3), and nearly always (4). The minimum 
score  is  0,  and  the  maximum  is  48.  The  total 
scores  obtained  were  classified  as:  no‑to‑mild

significance was fixed at 0.05. Karl‑Pearson correlation 
was  used  to  determine  the  relationship  between 
caregiver burden, social support, and family well‑being. 
Linear regression was used to identify the predictors of 
caregiver burden.

c.  Multidimensional scale of perceived social support: 
This  is  a  12‑item  multidimensional  standardized 
scale of perceived social support scale with response 
options  ranging  from  very  strongly  disagree  (1)  to 
very  strongly  agree  (7).  The  sum  of  12  items  was 
divided by 12, and the obtained score was interpreted 
as low support (1–2.9), moderate support (3–5), and 
high  support  (5.1–7).[10]  The  internal  consistency 
reliability  (Cronbach’s  alpha)  of  the  Hindi  Version 
was 0.92. Permission for using the tool was obtained 
from the authors.

d.  Family  health  scale:  A  10‑item  family  health  scale 
developed by Crandall A. et al.[11] was used to assess 
the family’s well‑being. The response options in the 
scale ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly 
agree (5). A score of 4 or 5 was coded as 1, and less 
than 4 as 0. The total scores were classified as poor 
family  health  (0–5),  moderate  family  health  (6–8), 
and  excellent  family  health  (9–10).  Permission  to 
use the scale was obtained from the authors. As the 
scale was available only in the English language, the 
forward (Hindi) and reverse translations of the scale 
were  performed  by  bilingual  experts.  The  internal 
consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of the Hindi 
version of the family health scale was 0.78.

Data analysis
The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. 
The  data  had  a  normal  distribution.  The  level  of 

Results

The mean age of the CMD patient was 36.02 years (standard 
deviation: 13.62). The minimum age of the patients with 
CMD  was  14  years,  and  the  maximum  was  82  years. 
All 236 patients were from Madhya Pradesh. The mean 
age of caregivers was 39.73 (standard deviation: 13.05). 
Table  1  reveals  that  the  majority  of  the  caregivers 
were  in  the  age  group  of  20–39  years,  male,  married, 
employed, Hindu, had an income above Rs. 18,229, and 
did not attend any training program on the care of the 
mentally ill.

Table 2 presents the level of caregiver burden, perceived 
social support, and family well‑being. The majority of 
the caregivers expressed mild‑moderate burden (53%), 
moderate social support (75.8%), and moderate family 
well‑being  (48.3%).  However,  45.8%  with  poor  family 
well‑being and 31.3% with high caregiver burdens are 
of equal concern.

Table  3  informs  that  there  is  a  negative,  moderate 
relationship between caregiver burden with perceived 
social support and family well‑being at a 0.05 level of 
significance;  thus,  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.  It 
can be inferred that as the caregiver burden increased, 
the  perceived  social  support  and  family  well‑being 
decreased.  A  positive  moderate  relationship  between

perceived social support and family well‑being depicts 
the  potential  of  social  support  in  improving  family 
well‑being.

Table 4 shows the frequency distribution of the level of 
caregiver burden, social support, and family well‑being 
against the age, gender, and diagnosis of CMD patients. 
The data reveals that the majority of the patients with 
CMDs  were  male  (62.3%),  aged  20–39  years  (59.3%), 
and  had  anxiety  and  fear‑related  disorders  (47.5%). 
High caregiver burden and poor family well‑being were 

noted among patients diagnosed with PTSD, followed by 
depression. However, the majority of caregivers received 
moderate social support irrespective of age, gender, or 
diagnosis of patients

A  stepwise  linear  regression  analysis  was  conducted 
to  determine  the  predictors  of  caregiver  burden,  with 
caregiver burden score as the dependent variable. The 
multiple regression model, which included all predictors 
for the caregiver burden of patients with CMD, yielded 
an  adjusted  R²  of  0.185,  indicating  that  the  predictors 
accounted  for  18.5%  of  the  variance  in  the  outcome 
variable. This model was also statistically significant in 
identifying the predictors (F (2, 233) =2.99, P < 0.001).

After applying a two‑step linear regression model to the 
caregiver burden score for patients with CMDs, significant 
predictors  were  identified:  social  support  score  (B  = 
−0.149, P < 0.001) and family well‑being score (B = −0.938, 
P  <  0.001).  Both  social  support  and  family  well‑being 
have a significant negative impact on caregiver burden. 
This means that as social support and family well‑being 
improve, caregiver burden decreases [Table 5].

Discussion

The availability of 236 patients with CMDs at the tertiary 
care hospital within a month’s duration at the psychiatry 
OPD/ward  reveals  the  magnitude  of  CMDs  in  the 
region.  The  National  Mental  Health  Survey  report  of 
2016 in India recommended the use and strengthening 
of mental health facilities in India to decrease the burden 
of mental health illness. The use of mental health services 
at the tertiary care facility by the CMD patients in this 
study informs that services are used, treatment‑seeking 
behavior is promoted, and caregivers in the region are 
concerned for the care of the mentally ill.

The majority of the caregivers had a moderate burden 
in the present study in central India, and the caregiver 
burden was higher when the CMD patient’s diagnosis 
was PTSD or depression. Similar studies in South and 
Northeast India have also reported moderate caregiver 
burden among chronically ill mental patients (57.3% in 
Kerala, 59.1% in Karnataka, and 52.2% in Imphal).[12‑14] 
The findings across north Indian cities such as Delhi and 
Lucknow  varied:  mild‑to‑moderate  caregiver  burden 
while  caring  for  OCD  patients[15]  moderate  caregiver 
burden  while  caring  for  schizophrenia  patients,[6] 
and  higher  caregiver  burden  among  fear  and  anxiety 
patients.[16] A study among depressive patients in south 
India reported that the burden increased when depressive 
patients  were  hospitalized.[17]  By  and  large,  caregiver 
burden was associated with caregiver age, educational 
status,  marital  status,  occupation,  relationship  with  a 
patient, and the duration of caregiving.[18]

burden were linked to increased depressive symptoms 
in  patients.[20]  Many  caregivers  reported  having  less 
time  for  themselves  due  to  caregiving  duties,  feeling 
embarrassed, encountering social life challenges, facing 
financial strain, and receiving inadequate support from 
healthcare facilities.[21] Caregiving was associated with 
the  patient’s  gender,  age,  marital  status,  duration  of 
illness, and type of illness.[18] Studies in Spain and Egypt 
reported  severe  burdens  among  caregivers  looking 
after severe mental disorder patients.[22,23] Khan et al.[24] 
in India found that the social support perceived by the 
male  and  female  caregivers  was  equal.  Studies  across 
countries  (India,  Egypt,  Shanghai,  and  China)  report 
that caregivers received moderate social support while 
caring for the mentally ill.[24‑27]

In the present study, nearly half of the caregivers (45.8%) 
expressed poor family well‑being, a finding contradictory 
to the observations of Nalini et al.[28] in South India where 
only a quarter of participants perceived (23%–25%) low 
family well‑being. It is noteworthy to mention here that 
there is a vast difference in the healthcare infrastructure 
and  population  characteristics  of  South  and  Central 
India.  While  bridging  this  gap  may  be  a  challenge 
in  the  current  scenario  for  India,  strengthening  the 
caring abilities of the caregiver may be a cost‑effective 
alternative. The majority of the caregivers lack training 
in the care of the mentally ill; the present study reveals

Ratre, et al.: Caregiver burden, social support and family well‑beingthat the healthcare providers of Central India must focus 
attention  toward training and empowering  caregivers 
in  the  family  with  requisite  knowledge  and  skills.  In 
the present study, social support and family well‑being 
predicted  caregiver  burden,  a  finding  similar  to  the 
studies reported in different regions.[29‑32] A study in Iran 
concluded that caregivers of patients with mental illness 
were found to require social support from family and 
emotional domains.[31] Thus, a focus on social support 
and  family‑centered  care  delivered  at  the  doorsteps 
through the Health and Wellness Center team would be 
the most appropriate strategy to rebuild family health 
and  reduce  caregiver  burden  in  India.  Nursing  and 
allied  healthcare  professionals  placed  in  both  health 
centers  or  the  periphery  should  take  an  active  part  in 
rendering social support to the caregivers and ensuring 
family  health.  Nurses  function  with  the  important 
role  of  facilitating  communication,  identification,  and 
cooperation  between  caregivers  of  CMD  patients  to 
decrease  the  burden.  Guidance  and  counseling  of 
caregivers should be considered as a priority intervention 
along with other patient care.

The  present  study  reveals  the  present  situation  of 
caregiver burden, social support, and family well‑being 
of caregivers of CMD patients in the Bhopal district of 
Madhya  Pradesh.  Policymakers  can  use  our  findings 
to  create  more  targeted  programs  to  enhance  social 
support and well‑being, despite encountering challenges 
in accessing healthcare facilities. Training may also be 
organized for nurses and healthcare workers on early 
identification of caregiver’s burden. Social support may 
be extended to the caregivers of CMD patients by the 
peripheral healthcare providers to improve the family 
health of CMD patients and their caregivers.

Limitation and recommendation
The major limitation of the present study findings may 
be interpreted in the context of the sampling technique 
used and the likely social desirability bias from the use of 
the rating scales. The majority of the caregivers are male 
and the majority of interviews place in OPD.

Strength of the study
The  findings  of  the  present  study  could  be  important 
to see the present situation of caregiver’s burden, social 
support, and family well‑being in Madhya Pradesh.
•	 A  study  using  a  mixed‑method  design  may  be 
planned  to  explore  the  relationship  between  social 
support,  family  well‑being,  and  caregiver  burden 
beyond the Bhopal district or across Madhya Pradesh.
•	 Intervention  can  be  planned  to  improve  family 
well‑being, and its effectiveness can be assessed.
•	 The  caregiver  burden  may  be  assessed  through 
qualitative approaches to supplement data collected 
using standardized tools.

Conclusion

The  study  revealed  that  the  caregivers  perceived 
moderate caregiver burden, social support, and family 
well‑being.  Social  support  and  family  well‑being  had 
an  inverse  relationship  with  the  caregiver  burden. 
Enhancing  social  support  would  reduce  the  caregiver 
burden and in turn improve family well‑being. There is a 
need to reduce caregiver burden if the burden of mental 
illness is reduced. Healthcare providers have a greater 
responsibility to address the problem of caregiver burden 
now  than  later,  especially  in  Central  India.  Providing 
social support and training the caregivers on the care of 
the mentally ill should be considered a priority measure 
to  improve  family  health  and  reduce  the  caregiver 
burden and the magnitude of mental illness in India.
