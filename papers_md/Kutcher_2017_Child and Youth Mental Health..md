When the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and
Technology released its seminal 2006 report Out of the
Shadows at Last,1 one sentence, perhaps somewhat lost in the
voluminous amount of text, stood out for all those who work
at the front end of addressing mental health care: “Children
and youth are at a significant disadvantage when compared to
other demographic groups affected by mental illness, in that
the failings of the mental health system affect them more
acutely and severely. The Committee believes it is imperative
to move aggressively to tackle key problems now” (item 6.1).
It is well appreciated that the mental disorders are the
chronic diseases of young people, and we have known for
some time now that the majority of mental disorders can
be diagnosed by age 25 years.2 Early identification, fol-
lowed by rapid access to effective interventions, can be
expected to lessen the burden of illness significantly, with
substantial return on initial investments in the delivery of
care.3 Early investment in treatment for young people can
also be expected to pay a population dividend, because
the burden and cost of illness will be lessened as they age
along the life span.

About a decade has passed, and there are concerns that the
pace of change has been slow,4 with, as the report from
Children’s Mental Health Ontario5 noted, continued long
wait times for mental health care, challenges with data col-
lection and management, and fragmentation of services. Sui-
cide rates in young people have begun to rise after years of
decreasing and in 2012 were about 50% higher than their
2006 nadir.6 According to the Canadian Institute of Health
Information,7 the rate of emergency room visits and hospi-
talisations for mental health reasons by young Canadians has
increased substantially, while the prevalence of mental dis-
orders has not so increased. Media coverage of this situation
demonstrates the human face of this lack of progress (e.g.,
http://www.lfpress.com/2017/01/31/mental-health-kids-
with-serious-mental-illness-waiting-months).

Evergreen, the 2010 child and youth mental health frame-
work created for the Mental Health Commission of Canada
under the leadership of its Child and Youth Advisory Com-
mittee (see http://www.mentalhealthcommission.ca/sites/

default/files/Diversity_Evergreen_Framework_Summar
y_ENG_0_1.pdf), was a first national attempt to sketch out a
framework that could be used by provincial/territorial gov-
ernments and interested organisations to move forward an
agenda that could advance child and youth mental health
across Canada addressing domains of promotion, prevention,
intervention and ongoing care, research, and evaluation.8
More recently, an application of this framework was success-
fully completed in the Yukon Territory (http://www.degroo
te.mcmaster.ca/files/2012/08/final-yukon-child-and-youth-
research-report-reduced-size.pdf), where it informed the
development of the child and youth mental health policy.9
Some innovative research interventions are under way (e.g.,
the Canadian Institute for Health Research [CIHR] and Boeck
Foundation–funded ACCESS project nationally [http://
www.douglas.qc.ca/news/1268?locale¼en] and the Project
ECHO Ontario [http://www.echoontario.ca/Register/Child-
and-Youth-Mental-Health.aspx]), but results of substantial
enough impact to influence care directions, if they are posi-
tive, may yet be years out.

In the interim, a number of initiatives that have already
demonstrated positive or promising results could be frugally
applied and modified as new information becomes available.
Using the Evergreen framework as a reference point, the
following could be considered as new federal funds begin
to flow to provinces and territories that have agreed to the
new funding arrangement.

Promotion

Much effort is being expanded in mental health promotion
with enthusiastic uptake at the population level and within

professional organisations. The national initiative by Bell
“Let’s Talk” is a good example. While there may be many
benefits of such enthusiasms, recent research cautions that
not all promotion activities may have the hoped for results.
Indeed, there is some emerging evidence that some kinds of
social marketing campaigns may increase demand for ser-
vices amongst those at low risk for negative outcomes yet
decrease demand for services for those at high risk.10
Community-based suicide intervention programs that
encourage talking about suicide may not prevent suicide,
nor is there evidence to show that they do not result in
increased rates of self-harm or suicide attempts.11 Thus,
one important intervention that could be considered is
requesting that mental health–related social marketing
campaigns undertake the necessary research needed to pro-
vide a reasonable degree of comfort that both the message
that they promote and the method in and by which they
promote it be more likely to lead to wanted rather than
unwanted outcomes, before they launch.

Prevention

As of yet, it is not clear which mental disorders arising in
young people can be prevented, and while there has been
great interest in application of numerous potentially preven-
tive interventions (such as cognitive behaviour therapy for
youth with symptoms of depression), well-designed con-
trolled studies12,13 have not come to the same conclusions
as less robust evaluations (http://childhealthpolicy.ca/wp-
content/uploads/2014/10/RQ-4-14-Fall.pdf).

Here, then, is yet another opportunity for relatively sim-
ple better address of interventions purported to prevent men-
tal disorders. There is a plethora of well-marketed mental
health prevention programs (http://childhealthpolicy.ca/wp-
content/uploads/2014/10/RQ-4-14-Fall.pdf) for which some
modest impact on some measures of emotional and beha-
vioral features exists but for which there is little or no robust
evidence for prevention of mental disorders. Policy makers
and those who apply prevention programs in their settings
should be clear about the goals for which those programs are
being applied and should favor the application of those inter-
ventions for which there is good evidence based on indepen-
dent systematic critical review of preventive impact. The
Public Health Agency of Canada or Health Canada could
consider establishing such a review process, setting accep-
table standards and providing a regulatory framework that
would independently and critically evaluate vendor submis-
sions prior to marketing. Such regulation already exists for
pharmaceutical products, and that model could be applied to
other health-related interventions as well.

Intervention and Ongoing Care

One reality that cannot be ignored and that was identified as
an action item in the Out of the Shadows at Last report (item
6.2.1) is that most young people spend considerable portions

of their day in school. Indeed, the education system has
solved the problem of access—a problem that the health
system has not solved. Schools are the ideal location to
address mental health literacy14 and should be the site of
health services that integrate mental health with all health
care, either through school-based health centers or smaller
site-based activities with appropriate mixes of health and
mental health providers.15 This “health for all just down the
hall” model can certainly be built into some of the innovative
school mental health literacy16,17 and structural school men-
tal health initiatives (such as SMH-ASSIST: http://smh-assis
t.ca/) that are currently under way. This approach not only
promotes site-based integration of human services needed by
young people but also can help ensure that education and
health services, the 2 most frequently used human services
by youth, are also integrated. Such an approach fits well with
recent evidence for positive results in enhancing capacity for
mental health care for youth with high-volume/low-intensity
mental disorders into primary health care (e.g., http://
www.gpscbc.ca/what-we-do/professional-development/psp/
modules/child-and-youth-mental-health/tools-resources), a
health system development that is essential for future
improvements in population mental health care.18

Research and Evaluation

While there is attention being drawn to the concern that
mental health care is underfunded (see http://www.healthcar
ecan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/B.-Funding-for-men
tal-health.pdf), there is growing concern that mental health
research is itself significantly underfunded, with child and
youth mental health research funding well below what may
be expected to be able to bring forward the much-needed
evidence upon which best-in-class mental health care can be
built (http://childhealthpolicy.ca/mental-health-funding/;
http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases2016/
underfundedcamhsresearch.aspx). While there has been
some additional new dollars dedicated to child and adoles-
cent mental health research from national funding agencies
such as CIHR, these fall far short of what is needed. Novel
funding mechanisms should be considered and moved for-
ward. A possible path in this direction is the example of the
innovative joint CIHR and Boeckh Foundation funding for
TRAM: Transformative Research in Adolescent Mental
Health. Without this agency and private philanthropic colla-
boration, this initiative would not have been able to move
forward. While credit must be given to those who came
together to create this initiative, Canada may benefit if a
framework could now be developed that would marry the
best of both these worlds: a solid, respectful partnership
between federal and provincial health funding agencies and
private philanthropic organisations. Federal leadership on
this would be welcomed.

In short, while much work needs to be done on improving
mental health care in Canada, the recent federal health fund-
ing initiative provides an opportunity to move forward on

this. As movement occurs, it is essential that substantial
investment in effective address of mental health care needs
of young people takes front and center. We cannot afford to
ignore the fact that most mental disorders can be diagnosed
prior to age 25 years and that while effective treatments are
available, most youth who need care cannot access it in a
timely manner. We cannot continue trying to patch up the
back end without paying attention to the front end. Investing
our resources where they may have the most long-lasting
impact, early in the life span, is essential to improving men-
tal health outcomes for Canadians.
