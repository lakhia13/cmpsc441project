Almost one-third of the U.S. population meets alcohol use disorder (AUD) criteria on a lifetime 
basis. This review provides an overview of recent research on the prevalence and patterns 
of alcohol-related improvement and selectively reviews nationally representative surveys 
and studies that followed risk groups longitudinally with a goal of informing patients with 
AUD and AUD researchers, clinicians, and policy-makers about patterns of improvement 
in the population. Based on the research, alcohol use increases during adolescence and 
early adulthood and then decreases beginning in the mid-20s across the adult life span. 
Approximately 70% of persons with AUD and alcohol problems improve without interventions 
(natural recovery), and fewer than 25% utilize alcohol-focused services. Low-risk drinking 
is a more common outcome in untreated samples, in part because seeking treatment is 
associated with higher problem severity. Sex differences are more apparent in help-seeking 
than recovery patterns, and women have lower help-seeking rates than men. Whites are 
proportionately more likely to utilize services than are Blacks and Hispanics. Improving 
recovery rates will likely require offering interventions outside of the health care sector 
to affected communities and utilizing social networks and public health tools to close the 
longstanding gap between need and utilization of AUD-focused services.

INTRODUCTION
Substance use disorder (SUD) is among the 
most prevalent mental health disorders in the 
United States and in general clinical practice, 
with 7% of the U.S. population age 12 and older 
(19.7 million people) having an SUD of some 

kind in 2018.1 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the 
most prevalent SUD, with 5% of persons age 12 
and older reporting AUD in 2018.1 Of persons 
with an SUD in 2018, and excluding those with a 
tobacco use disorder, 60% had AUD, 27% had an 
illicit drug use disorder, and 13% had disorders

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020involving alcohol and illicit drugs.1 On a lifetime 
basis, almost one-third of persons in the United 
States meet criteria for AUD.2 In addition to the 
high AUD prevalence, many more individuals 
engage in risky drinking or experience alcohol-
related negative consequences that fall short of 
meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for AUD.3 
Thus, harmful alcohol use is a major public health 
problem, costing the United States approximately 
$250 billion per year, and it is the third leading 
cause of preventable death.4

Most individuals who develop an AUD or have 

subclinical alcohol-related problems will reduce 
or resolve their problem on their own or with 
assistance from professional alcohol treatment 
or mutual help groups.5-9 The epidemiology 
of this robust phenomenon is the focus of this 
article. After initial consideration of complexities 
involved in defining improvement in alcohol-
related problems, which is discussed in depth 
by Witkiewitz et al.,10 this article describes the 
prevalence and heterogeneity of pathways to 
recovery and examines relationships between 
patterns of seeking help for and improvements 
in alcohol-related problems. Then, the topic 
is examined from a life span developmental 
perspective, which is less well-researched and 
involves relationships among age-related rates of 
problem onset, reduction, and persistence. The 
final section discusses differences in the overall 
patterns previously discussed as a function of 
gender and race/ethnicity. Emphasis is placed on 
illustrative recent findings. Earlier work is covered 
in prior literature.11,12

DEFINING IMPROVEMENT 
IN ALCOHOL-RELATED 
PROBLEMS
As discussed by Witkiewitz et al.,10 the 
conceptualization and measurement of 
improvements among persons with AUD and 
the constellation of improvements that define 
“recovery” have been debated for decades and 

continue to evolve. Clinical diagnostic criteria 
for AUD are offered by the American Psychiatric 
Association’s fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)3 
and the World Health Organization,13 with the 
former predominating in the United States. 
Numerous reputable organizations offer definitions 
of low- and high-risk drinking practices4,14 as well 
as AUD recovery or remission.15 These various 
criteria have been revised over time as research 
evidence has accumulated, generally in the 
direction of recognizing that alcohol consumption 
and AUD occur on severity continua. Furthermore, 
most individuals who engage in harmful alcohol 
use either do not meet AUD criteria or meet 
criteria for a mild disorder characterized by lower 
levels of symptomology.16

Characterizations of improvement in alcohol-
related problems have correspondingly become 
more nuanced over time in recognition of the 
heterogeneity of pathways, processes, and 
outcomes relevant to understanding how people 
reduce or resolve alcohol-related problems.10 
The term “recovery” is generally reserved for 
broad-based, sustained improvements in drinking 
practices and other areas of functioning adversely 
affected by drinking. Therefore, this article uses 
the term “recovery” to refer to a broadly conceived 
process resulting in sustained improvements in 
multiple domains, and uses the term “remission” 
to refer to more limited improvements in specific 
symptoms or problem behaviors (e.g., drinking 
practices). This is in line with the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s 
(NIAAA) recent definition of recovery from AUD 
as distinct from remission from AUD, defined 
symptomatically based on DSM-5 criteria, or 
cessation of heavy drinking without characterizing 
the presence or absence of other symptoms or 
improvements. It also is consistent with other 
recovery definitions, including those from the 
recovery community or patient perspectives, that 
encompass improved well-being and functioning 

2

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020and are not limited to attainment of abstinence or 
stable low-risk drinking.8,17

It is also important to acknowledge the 

association of the term “recovery” with Alcoholics 
Anonymous (AA) and other mutual support 
groups. Even though the term is widely used in 
the clinical literature, many persons attempting 
to resolve their alcohol problems do not identify 
with being in recovery8 and reject clinical labels 
indicative of AUD, especially those individuals 
attempting to resolve a drinking problem on 
their own.9 Moreover, salutary improvements 
can occur in circumscribed areas of alcohol-
related dysfunction, and reductions in drinking 
can contribute to improved health and well-being 
even if ongoing drinking falls short of traditional 
definitions of recovery that emphasize abstinence 
as a required element.18

As discussed by Witkiewitz and Tucker,16 a core 

issue debated for decades is the extent to which 
drinking practices should be central to defining 
improvement or recovery. Early writings regarded 
sustained abstinence as the hallmark of recovery 
among persons with severe alcohol problems 
who had repeatedly been unable to limit their 
drinking or abstain.19 Newer clinical diagnostic 
systems such as DSM-5 emphasize development of 
tolerance and physical dependence and drinking in 
harmful ways and under conditions that increase 
risk for adverse consequences.3 Drinking practices 
are not a criterion in accepted diagnostic systems 
for AUD, including DSM-5, and most schemes 
define recovery based on symptom reduction, 
improved functioning, and well-being and are not 
heavily focused on drinking practices per se. Yet, 
the large treatment outcome literature concerned 
with promoting recovery has relied heavily on 
drinking practices as the major outcome metric, 
typically by using quantity-frequency criteria 
considered indicative of higher-risk drinking 
practices (any occasions of more than 14 drinks 
weekly or more than five drinks daily for men; 
more than seven drinks weekly or more than four 
drinks daily for women in the past year).4,14

Recent work, however, has shown that such 
consumption-based thresholds lack sensitivity 
and specificity for predicting problems related 
to drinking and do not differentiate individuals 
based on measures of health, functioning, and 
well-being.20,21 Improvements in functioning 
and life circumstances are considered central 
features of recovery in many models, including 
AA, but assessment of these domains is a 
relatively recent development, primarily evident 
in clinical research.18,21 It is generally lacking 
in survey research that has provided the bulk of 
epidemiological data on population patterns of 
alcohol-related improvement, so this body of work 
only partially addresses the multiple domains 
considered important for investigating recovery, 
broadly defined.

A second core issue is that improvement in 
alcohol-related problems, including recovery 
from AUD, is a dynamic process of behavior 
change. Thus, longitudinal studies provide 
superior information to cross-sectional studies 
with retrospective assessments of drinking status, 
although the latter are common in the literature. 
Cross-sectional surveys have utility if they employ 
sound retrospective measures of past drinking 
status, but this is another qualification of the 
current epidemiological database on alcohol-
related improvement and recovery. Longitudinal 
research has become more common in recent 
years. However, the intervals over which repeated 
measures are obtained rarely exceed 3 to 5 years, 
although there are notable exceptions with follow-
ups of 8 to 10 years or more.22-24 Following large 
nationally representative samples for decades 
would be ideal, but the inevitable limitations on 
research resources have resulted in a collective 
body of work that generally comprises large 
representative studies that are cross-sectional or 
have short-term (e.g., 1 year) follow-ups. Studies 
with longer-term follow-ups tend to employ 
smaller, less representative samples. These core 
issues should be kept in mind when considering 
the epidemiology of improvements in alcohol-

as discussed next.

RECOVERY PATHWAYS AND 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN 
HELP-SEEKING AND 
DRINKING-RELATED 
OUTCOMES

Population-based survey research conducted 
over many decades has consistently revealed the 
following patterns with respect to improvements 
in alcohol-related problems:
• The majority of individuals who develop AUD 
reduce or resolve their problem over time.7,8,25 
Rates of improvement vary widely depending 
on features of the research, such as the intervals 
over which drinking status was assessed (e.g., 
lifetime basis, shorter-term assessment based 
on a year or more); demographic characteristics, 
problem severity, and help-seeking status of 
respondents; and how improvement or recovery/
remission was measured. But improvement 
over time is a reliable pattern and one that 
argues against a view of AUD as an inevitably 
progressive disease process.

• Seeking help for drinking problems from 
professional treatment or community and 
peer resources such as mutual help groups is 
uncommon,1,26 and a large gap persists between 
population need and service utilization. Most 
surveys indicate that less than 25% of persons in 
need utilize alcohol-focused helping resources.
• The great majority of persons who resolve their 
drinking problems do so without interventions, 
and such “natural recoveries” are the dominant 
pathway to problem resolution. Survey research 
has typically found that more than 70% of 
problem resolutions occur outside the context of 
treatment.7,9

• Stable low-risk drinking (moderation) is a 

relatively more common outcome in untreated 
samples, in part because seeking treatment is 
associated with higher problem severity,7,12 and 
most treatment programs emphasize abstinence.

For example, Fan and colleagues7 reported on 
the past-year prevalence of AUD recovery in the 
United States by using data from the NIAAA-
funded 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic 
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 
(NESARC-III)2 and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.3 
Survey respondents who met AUD criteria prior 
to the past year (n = 7,785) were assessed with 
respect to their current (past-year) AUD and risk 
drinking status. Drinking status was determined 
based on quantity-frequency criteria considered 
indicative of higher-risk drinking practices and 
DSM-5 AUD symptom counts. Measures of 
functioning and well-being were not collected.
Only 34% of respondents had persistent 
AUD, and most respondents had some degree 
of problem reduction; 16% achieved abstinence 
without symptoms, and 18% achieved low-risk 
drinking without symptoms. In addition, only 
23% of the Fan et al. sample reported having 
ever received alcohol treatment, and those who 
did tended to fall into the persistent AUD (26%) 
or abstinent without symptoms (43%) outcome 
groups that generally are associated with higher 
problem severity.7 In contrast, among the subset of 
respondents who reported abstinence or low-risk 
drinking without symptoms, 87% of those who 
reported low-risk drinking without symptoms 
were never treated, and only 12% were treated. 
An additional 15% of the sample reported low-
risk drinking with symptoms, and 15% reported 
high-risk drinking without symptoms.7 This is a 
refinement in outcome measurement compared to 
earlier surveys and illustrates the heterogeneity of 
recovery-relevant outcomes even in the absence of 
assessment of functioning and well-being.

This illustrative representative sample survey, 

among others,8,9 reveals a more optimistic and 
variable view of recovery pathways and outcomes 
than suggested by early research using treatment 
samples, which emphasized the chronic, relapsing 
nature of alcohol problems and the difficulty of 
maintaining remission. Population data indicate 
that, even though alcohol problems are prevalent, 
most affected individuals have less serious 
problems than the minority who seek treatment, 

4

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020and many improve on their own, including 
achieving stable abstinence or low-risk drinking 
without problems.

In contrast to these encouraging findings 
concerning rates of improvement, population 
research on the prevalence and patterns of help-
seeking for alcohol-related problems indicates 
that the gap between need and service utilization 
is large and chronic. This is the case even 
though alcohol-related services have improved 
and expanded considerably over the past 
several decades27,28 and reliably yield benefits 
for a majority of recipients. Among the 25% or 
fewer who seek care, sources of care span the 
professional, community, and peer-helping sectors. 
Within the professional sector, care is diffused 
through mental health, medical, and community 
services systems, and only a minority receive 
alcohol-focused services from qualified programs 
or professionals.8,27 

Prevalence estimates for utilization of different 
types of alcohol services are not reliably available 
for several reasons. For example, specialty 
treatment programs are often addiction-oriented 
and not alcohol-specific, most include mutual help 
group participation as a program requirement, and 
the anonymity principle of mutual help groups 
deters determination of utilization rates apart from 
treatment. Nevertheless, membership estimates for 
AA (2.1 million members worldwide, including 1.3 
million U.S. residents; https://www.aa.org) suggest 
that AA participation is relatively widespread. 
Comparable membership data are not available 
for other mutual help groups such as Self-
Management and Recovery Training (SMART 
Recovery), which holds more than 3,000 meetings 
per week worldwide (https://www.smartrecovery.
org/), and LifeRing Secular Recovery, which 
offers more than 140 face-to-face meetings in 
the United States as well as online meetings and 
other electronic supports (https://www.lifering.
org/). Regarding professional treatment, the 
2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health 
estimated that about 3.8 million U.S. residents age 
12 and older received any type of substance use 
treatment in the past year,27 but these numbers are 

not specific to alcohol treatment. Also missing are 
data on relative remission rates as a function of 
type of care-seeking.

Higher problem severity predicts help-seeking, 

with higher severity reflected in greater alcohol 
dependence levels and alcohol-related impairment 
in areas of life functioning such as intimate, 
family, and social relationships; employment and 
finances; and legal affairs.29 Perceived need also 
predicts help-seeking; however, even among those 
who perceive a need, only 15% to 30% receive 
help,30 and problem recognition often precedes 
seeking care by a decade.28 Thus, although most 
individuals who develop AUD will eventually 
resolve their problem, treatment utilization 
remains less used as a pathway to recovery. This 
pattern has persisted for decades despite recent 
expansion in the spectrum of services beyond 
clinical treatment to offer less costly and less 
intensive services that often can be accessed 
outside of the health care system and are suitable 
for those with less severe problems.28 In addition, 
provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act expanded access to and coverage of 
services for SUD.

RECOVERY ACROSS THE 
LIFE SPAN
Studies that followed risk groups and people with 
drinking problems longitudinally—typically 
using smaller samples than survey research—
provide information on patterns of improvement 
and recovery across the life span. Some studies 
assessed functioning and life circumstances, in 
addition to drinking practices, and revealed the 
following age-related patterns with respect to 
the onset of and improvements in alcohol-related 
problems:
• Drinking to intoxication, binge drinking, 

and alcohol-related problems increase during 
adolescence and early adulthood, generally 
peaking between ages 18 and 22. Prevalence of 
past-year binge drinking (45%) and AUD (19%) 
is highest in the early 20s31 and then decreases 
beginning in the mid-20s and continuing well 

5

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020after early adulthood. This nonlinear trajectory 
for the majority of adolescents and young adults, 
often termed “maturing out,” has been found in 
cross-sectional and longitudinal research using 
large national samples2,32,33 and by the annual 
cross-sectional National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health.1 

• Adult role transitions (e.g., employment, 

marriage, parenthood) and personal maturation 
(e.g., decreased impulsivity) are associated with 
remission or recovery in early adulthood.31,34-36 
As is the case for the general adult population 
with AUD, only about a quarter of adolescents 
and young adults in need of treatment receive it.1

• A subset of young adults who engage in 

harmful alcohol use and develop AUD in 
early adulthood show persistent or escalating 
problems in later life. Alcohol use before age 21 
predicts persistence and severity of harmful use 
throughout the life span;37 however, reductions 
in problem drinking in early adulthood are more 
likely to occur among individuals who had the 
most severe problems at earlier ages.34

• Development of AUD is less common after 
age 25, and reductions in problem drinking, 
including recovery from AUD, continue past 
early adulthood and across the adult life span, 
including through late middle and old age (ages 
60 to 80 and older).22,34 Reductions in problem 
drinking at older ages are predicted by relatively 
heavier alcohol use in early old age that prompted 
complaints from concerned others.22

These trends favoring increased remission rates 

over the life span are generally representative of 
the population, but can mask important nuances 
about age-related associations between problem 
onset, remission, and recurrence rates.31,34-36 For 
example, Vergés and colleagues35,36 used NESARC 
data from Waves 1 and 2 (from 2001–2002 
to 2004–2005) to “deconstruct” age-related 
patterns of three different dynamic changes that 
contributed to overall age-related trends in the 
prevalence of DSM-IV alcohol dependence at each 
wave. Although rates of new alcohol problem onset 
and recurrence of or relapse to earlier problems 
declined with age, rates of persistence of alcohol 

problems over time were relatively stable across 
ages 18 to 50 and older. These different processes 
that contributed to the overall trend of decreased 
alcohol-related problems with increasing age 
suggest that “maturing out”—as young people 
assume adult roles—is not a sufficiently complete 
account of remission rates across the life span.
In related research that also used NESARC 
data from Waves 1 and 2, Lee and colleagues 
examined how rates of remission, which they 
termed “desistance,” from mild, moderate, or 
severe levels of AUD varied across age groups 
ranging between ages 20 to 24 and 48 to 55.34 
Using Markov models to characterize patterns of 
longitudinal transitions in drinking status, they 
found differences in rates of AUD desistance 
from young adulthood to middle age as a function 
of AUD severity levels. Desistance rates from 
severe AUD, defined as six or more DSM-IV 
symptoms, were considerably higher in earlier 
age groups (ages 25 to 29 and 30 to 34) relative 
to older age groups (ages 35 to 39, 40 to 47, and 
48 to 55) as compared to rates found in surveys 
that aggregated data across AUD severity levels. 
Desistance rates from moderate AUD showed 
a similar, but less dramatic pattern across age 
groups, whereas desistance rates from mild 
AUD were relatively stable across age groups. 
When considered with the work of Vergés 
and colleagues,35,36 these studies (1) show that 
resolution of severe AUD contributes heavily 
and distinctively to early adulthood remission 
prevalence, and (2) highlight the importance of 
deconstructing overall AUD prevalence curves 
by taking into account onset, remission, and 
recurrence of different levels of AUD severity 
over the life span.

Finally, a few studies observed increased 
binge drinking among middle-aged and older 
adults,33 suggesting dynamic changes may occur 
in binge drinking in midlife; these changes are 
not well researched. Similarly, most natural 
recovery research comprises samples showing 
that midlife recovery from AUD is normative.9,38 
Middle age is also when treatment entry tends 
to occur.5 Recovery in midlife and later ages is 

6

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020associated with an accumulation of alcohol-related 
problems coupled with life contexts that support 
and reinforce maintenance of drinking reductions 
and involve post-resolution improvements in 
functioning and well-being.38,39

ROLE OF GENDER AND 
RACE/ETHNICITY
Remission
In addition to age, rates of recovery or remission of 
AUD symptoms vary by gender and race/ethnicity. 
Using NESARC Wave 1 data, Dawson et al. 
found that older age and female gender predicted 
abstinence, but not low-risk drinking, in both 
treated and untreated respondents who had alcohol 
dependence prior to the past year.5 Compared to 
non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks had 
proportionately higher rates of abstinence than 
low-risk drinking. In the Fan et al.7 replication  
of Dawson et al.5 using NESARC-III data,  
female gender predicted both abstinence and  
low-risk drinking.

Also using NESARC-III data, Vasilenko et 
al. examined AUD prevalence by age and race/
ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic).40 Although 
AUD prevalence generally peaked in the 20s and 
declined steadily with age, prevalence was higher 
for Whites at younger ages and higher for Blacks 
at older ages. This cross-over pattern typically 
occurred around age 60. In midlife, prevalence 
was similar for Blacks and Whites. Also, Whites 
reported higher AUD rates than Hispanic 
respondents at all ages, and men reported higher 
AUD rates than women until older age, when 
women were more likely than men to report AUD 
in their 70s. However, the number of participants 
older than age 70 was very small.

The study by Lee et al. that investigated age-
related patterns of AUD desistance as a function 
of AUD severity also found gender and race/
ethnicity differences.34 Desistance patterns for 
males were generally consistent with the full 
sample findings—namely, elevated desistance 
rates for severe AUD in early adulthood and 
relatively stable rates for mild and moderate 

AUD. In contrast, females showed markedly 
higher rates of desistance from moderate AUD 
in early adulthood compared to older ages and 
attenuated rates of desistance from severe AUD 
compared to males during ages 30 to 34 only. 
With respect to race/ethnicity, results for Whites 
were generally consistent with the full sample, 
but findings differed for Hispanics and Blacks. 
For Hispanics, the early adulthood spike in 
rates of desistance from severe AUD was more 
time-limited, occurring only during ages 30 to 
34 with much lower rates during ages 25 to 29. 
For Blacks, desistance rates for mild AUD also 
were relatively stable but were elevated for both 
moderate AUD (ages 25 to 29 and 30 to 34) and 
severe AUD (ages 25 to 29). For severe AUD, 
desistance rates among Blacks were very low 
during ages 30 to 34.

Patrick and colleagues analyzed age and 
gender relations with binge drinking using data 
from 27 cohorts of the annual Monitoring the 
Future surveys (1976 to 2004).41 Participants 
were followed from 12th grade (modal age 18) 
through modal age 29/30. Across cohorts, the 
age of peak binge drinking prevalence increased 
from age 20 in 1976–1985 to age 22 in 1996–2004 
for women, and from age 21 in 1976–1985 to age 
23 in 1996–2004 for men. Similar to the typical 
population life span trajectory for AUD remission, 
for men the high prevalence of binge drinking 
persisted through ages 25 to 26, followed by 
reductions during the late 20s. For women ages 21 
to 30, more recent cohorts reported significantly 
higher binge drinking prevalence than in earlier 
cohorts, with risk remaining high throughout the 
20s. These shifts toward older age of peak binge 
drinking prevalence indicate an extension of risks 
associated with harmful alcohol consumption in 
young adulthood, especially for women.

Taken together, these studies on rates of 

improvement by gender and race/ethnicity suggest 
that many of the differences observed involve 
variations in the timing and extent of reductions 
in binge drinking and AUD during either young 
adulthood or older age, even though all groups 
tended to show overall patterns similar to the 

7

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020population as a whole. Differences during midlife 
were less extensive, although this developmental 
period has not been the focus of much research.

Help-Seeking
Help-seeking patterns and preferences also vary 
by gender and race/ethnicity. The gap between 
need and receipt of treatment is larger for women 
than for men, even after controlling for the higher 
prevalence of AUD and greater problem severity 
among men.42,43 For example, using NESARC 
data from Waves 1 and 2, Gilbert et al. found 
that women identified as having DSM-IV alcohol 
abuse or dependence at Wave 1 had significantly 
lower odds than men at Wave 2 of having used any 
alcohol service, specialty treatment, or mutual help 
groups.42 These utilization differences occurred 
even though women and men reported similar 
low perceived need for help and similar numbers 
of treatment barriers. Women were more likely 
to report expecting that their problem would 
improve without intervention, whereas men were 
more likely to report prior help-seeking that was 
unhelpful. No differences in service utilization 
or perceived need were found for race/ethnicity 
among White, Black, and Hispanic respondents. 
Consistent with the larger literature, greater 
alcohol problem severity was associated with 
higher odds of service utilization.

Studies using pooled data from multiple waves 

of the national probability samples collected in 
the National Alcohol Surveys found differences in 
service utilization as a function of gender and race/
ethnicity.44,45 Zemore et al. used pooled data from 
three waves (1995–2005) to investigate lifetime 
alcohol treatment utilization and perceived 
barriers among Latinx respondents (N = 4,204).44 
Among respondents, 3.4%, 2.7%, and 2.1% 
reported any lifetime treatment, AA participation, 
and institutional treatment, respectively. Men were 
significantly more likely than women to report 
receipt of any treatment services (5.6% vs. 1.1%), 
AA (4.7% vs. 0.6%), or institutional treatment 
(3.2% vs. 1.0%). Completion of the study interview 
in English (4.3%) versus Spanish (2.3%) also 
predicted higher utilization. These patterns were 

similar among the subsample of respondents who 
reported lifetime alcohol dependence, among 
whom rates of service utilization were much 
higher (20.4% for men and 15.3% for women). 
The authors suggested that underutilization 
of treatment by women and Spanish speakers 
may be due to cultural stigma against women 
with an alcohol problem, concerns about racial/
ethnic stereotyping or stigmatization when 
seeking treatment, and additional barriers faced 
by individuals who are uncomfortable speaking 
English.

A later study using pooled data from the 
2000–2010 National Alcohol Surveys included 
Whites, Blacks, and Latinx participants and found 
lower service utilization among Latinx, Blacks 
(vs. Whites), and women (vs. men).45 Racial/ethnic 
differences in utilization were moderated by 
gender. Among women, only 2.5% of Latinas and 
3.4% of Blacks with lifetime AUD used specialty 
treatment compared to 6.7% of Whites; among 
men, the corresponding figures were 6.8% for 
Latinos, 12.2% for Blacks, and 10.1% for Whites.45 
Higher utilization among Whites than among 
Blacks and Hispanics also was found using the 
2014 cohort from the National Survey on Drug 
Use and Health.46

Overall, research on race/ethnicity and help-
seeking is not extensive, and groups other than 
Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics/Latinx have not 
been well studied.47 Available research suggests 
that the gap between need and service utilization 
common among those with an alcohol problem 
is accentuated among ethnic and racial minority 
groups; however, research is in its infancy on why 
this is the case and how to address it.

DISCUSSION

Research on the epidemiology of recovery 
from AUD is somewhat uneven in scope and 
methods, and gaps remain in the knowledge base. 
Nonetheless, the bulk of evidence converges 
in showing that (1) improvements in alcohol-
related problems, including recovery from AUD, 
are commonplace; (2) natural recovery is the 

8

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020dominant pathway; (3) greater problem severity 
is associated with treatment utilization; and 
(4) low-risk drinking outcomes are more common 
among untreated samples. Problem prevalence and 
rates of remission of AUD symptoms in the U.S. 
population peak during the 20s and are followed by 
a slow, steady decline over the adult life span. The 
specific ages when these characteristic dynamics 
in the temporal patterning of harmful alcohol use 
and remission of symptoms occur vary somewhat 
as a function of gender and race/ethnicity, but the 
overall general pattern is well established.

These findings provide a rich foundation 
concerning population patterns and dynamics 
of recovery, remission, and help-seeking. Future 
research aimed at disaggregating these complex 
associations at the population level should be a 
priority and can inform approaches to promoting 
remission and recovery in two general ways.48 
First, longitudinal studies of the onset of and 
improvements in alcohol-related problems31,34-36 
exemplify how epidemiological risk factors are 
reliably associated with the course of alcohol 
problem development and improvement and can 
be used to target at-risk individuals for preventive 
interventions. Second, “upstream” population-
level interventions can be applied to prevent or 
reduce the determinants of risk (e.g., through 
changes in policy, taxation, and health and 
community infrastructure). The latter approach, 
although less common, takes advantage of the 
well-established prevention paradox—small 
reductions in harmful alcohol use by risky 
drinkers with less serious problems result in far 
greater health improvements at the population 
level than do changes in harmful alcohol use by 
the minority of persons with AUD.

This body of research qualifies the usual 
characterization of AUD as a chronic, relapsing/
remitting disorder for which intensive intervention 
is essential for recovery. That characterization may 
be representative for a small minority of persons 
with more severe AUD, but it is inaccurate for the 
large majority of persons with mild to moderate 
problems, many of whom resolve their problems 
the first time they attempt to quit and often without 

interventions.9,49 Whether this qualification applies 
to SUD other than AUD is not established.

The recovery literature is characterized by a 
mix of cross-sectional population surveys with 
short-term retrospective assessments (1 year is 
typical) and prospective follow-ups of smaller-
sized samples of risk groups that, with some 
notable exceptions,22-24 also had relatively short 
follow-ups. Use of data from the multiple waves of 
the NESARC dominates this research literature. 
Although the NESARC obtained data from a very 
large nationally representative sample of the U.S. 
population age 18 and older (e.g., N = 36,309 in 
NESARC-III), it shares limitations inherent to 
most survey research—namely, assessments must 
be relatively brief, meaning that the domains of 
inquiry must be limited and selected carefully 
and cannot be probed to obtain the detail typically 
useful in clinical applications.

These design characteristics have contributed 

to gaps in the literature due to overreliance on 
drinking practices as the major outcome metric 
and less common measurement of functioning, 
well-being, and life circumstances, which are 
central features of recovery and can occur with 
or without reductions in drinking. Correlates of 
remission rates are being reported with increasing 
frequency in survey research, but tend to be 
limited to demographic characteristics, problem 
severity variables related to drinking practices, 
help-seeking history, and, in some cases, 
psychiatric comorbidity. Other than the seminal 
research program of Moos and colleagues,22,39 
assessment of functioning, context, and well-
being surrounding drinking behavior change is a 
relatively recent development, primarily evident 
in clinical research18,21 and process-oriented 
research on natural recovery.38 Connecting these 
research literatures in meaningful ways in future 
investigations is essential for broadening scientific 
knowledge about how affected individuals reduce 
and resolve their alcohol-related problems and for 
guiding improvements in alcohol services that are 
responsive to heterogeneity in recovery-related 
outcomes and pathways.

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020Another issue in need of further research 
involves deconstruction of separable processes 
that contribute to overall problem prevalence 
and remission rates across the life span. As 
highlighted in the research of Vergés, Lee, Sher, 
and colleagues,31,34-36 overall population rates are 
influenced by age-related associations between 
problem onset, remission, and recurrence rates, 
which raises questions about whether remission 
patterns reflect a simple “maturing out” of 
harmful alcohol use that began in early adulthood. 
Based on the available data, Lee and Sher31 
concluded: “[T]he continual declines in AUD 
rates observed throughout the life span . . . appear 
mainly attributable to reductions in new onsets 
. . . whereas potential for desistance from an 
existing AUD may peak in young adulthood . . . 
[especially] for those with a severe AUD” (p. 37).
The timing and targeting of prevention and 
treatment programs could be refined to enhance 
intervention effectiveness if these age-related 
associations between problem onset, remission, 
and recurrence rates were firmly established and 
used to guide intervention delivery. Conducting 
this kind of research is challenging because it 
requires collecting data on all three processes 
over the life span, and there are additional 
complexities in studying the tails of the age 
distribution. For example, clinical diagnostic 
systems may overdiagnose AUD in adolescence, 
which would inflate estimates of remission 
rates in early adulthood.50 Attrition biases are 
of concern with advancing age as poor health 
and death may remove proportionately more 
older adults with AUD from population samples, 
thereby inflating estimates of remission rates in 
old age particularly from severe AUD.5,34

A final generalization from this research 
concerns the limited contribution of alcohol 
treatment or other alcohol-focused services to 
recovery prevalence in the population. Low 
rates of service utilization have persisted despite 
improvements in AUD treatment and lower 
threshold options28 and the expansion of access 
and coverage of services for SUD provided by 

the Affordable Care Act. The enduring gap 
between population need and service utilization 
despite these advances strongly suggests that 
alternative avenues are needed to increase 
intervention diffusion and uptake. It has 
proven insufficient to offer improved treatment 
predominately through the health care sector, and 
priority needs to be given to reaching broader 
segments of the at-risk population of drinkers 
who contribute most of the alcohol-related 
harm and cost. Nevertheless, a sizable subset 
of individuals with AUD improve or recover 
without interventions, and recent evidence 
suggests that individuals with more severe 
AUD exercise some degree of appropriate self-
selection into treatment.29 Empirical questions 
warranting further investigation are how to 
distinguish among individuals or risk groups 
for whom natural recovery is a high probability 
outcome and how to segment the market so that 
treatment services are targeted and available 
for those in need who are not likely to achieve 
recovery without treatment.

Further improvements in reducing the 

prevalence of AUD and increasing the prevalence 
of recovery likely depend on dissolving the 
silos that have long existed between clinical and 
epidemiological research and applications11 and 
finding novel ways to disseminate evidence-based 
services to the large underserved at-risk population 
of drinkers who will not use professional services, 
at least in their present form. It is also important to 
consider a broader public health approach to dispel 
long-held beliefs that alcohol is a problem only for 
those with severe AUD and that those with AUD 
can resolve their problem only through abstinence. 
Perpetuation of these myths over many decades 
has stigmatized the disorder and deterred help-
seeking among the millions of people who would 
benefit from drinking reductions.

In conclusion, recovery from AUD and 
alcohol-related problems is the most common 
outcome among those with problem alcohol use, 
and recovery without abstinence is possible, 
even among those with severe AUD. Changing 

10

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020the narrative to highlight the high likelihood of 
recovery could help engage more individuals 
in alcohol-related services and may encourage 
individuals to reduce their drinking in the absence 
of formal treatment.
