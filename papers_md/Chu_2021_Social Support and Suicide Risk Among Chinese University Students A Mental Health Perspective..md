Background: World Health Organization recognizes suicide as a public health priority.
This study aimed to investigate the risk life events which led university students to
consider suicide and explore the protective mechanism of social support (including
subjective support, objective support, and support utilization) on suicide risk.

Methods: Three thousand nine hundred and seventy-two university students were
recruited in Harbin, China. Social Support Rating Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the
Beck Depression Inventory, and the 25-item scale of suicide acceptability were used
to collect participants’ information. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation, and
mediation analysis were employed for statistical analysis.

“Drug addict,” “infected with HIV,” and “incurable illness” were the top
Results:
three events that led university students to consider suicide. Social support played an
important protective role against suicide risk. Subjective support and support utilization
had total effects on suicide acceptability, including direct and indirect effects. Anxiety
(indirect effect = −0.022, 95% CI = −0.037 ∼ −0.009) and depressive symptoms
(indirect effect = −0.197, 95% CI = −0.228 ∼ −0.163) mediated the relationship
between subjective support and suicide acceptability; meanwhile,
the association
between support utilization and suicide acceptability was mediated by anxiety (indirect
effect = −0.054, 95% CI = −0.088 ∼ −0.024) and depressive symptoms (indirect
effect = −0.486, 95% CI = −0.558 ∼ −0.422). However, the protective impact of
objective support worked totally through decreasing anxiety (indirect effect = −0.018,
95% CI = −0.035 ∼ −0.006) and depressive symptoms (indirect effect = −0.196, 95%
CI = −0.246 ∼ −0.143). Moreover, the mediation effects of depressive symptoms had
stronger power than anxiety in the impact of social support on suicide risk.

Conclusions: Among Chinese university students, suicide acceptability was elevated
when there was a health scare. Social support effectively reduced suicide risk via
decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms. From the mental health perspective,
families, peers, teachers, and communities should work together to establish a better
social support system for university students, if necessary, help them to seek professional
psychological services.

Social Support and Suicide Risk

INTRODUCTION

According to the latest available data from the World Health
Organization (WHO), there are close to 800,000 suicide deaths
every year, numbering one person every 40 s (1). Suicide has
continued to be a serious public health problem around the
globe, which is the second leading cause of death among 15–
29-year-olds worldwide. In China, suicide has become the ﬁrst
cause of death in the Chinese population aged 15–34 (2).
Adolescence and young adulthood are a time for development
and changes in biological, psycho-social, and spiritual aspects
of life. University students are in the most critical onset period
for various mental health problems and experience high suicide
leaving
risk (3) because of a new academic environment,
home, new relationships, and academic pressure (4, 5). Suicide
risk has been the focus of increasing attention in research
and public awareness campaigns over the past decade (6).
Prevention of suicide is signiﬁcantly necessary. WHO reported
that many suicides happened impulsively in moments of crisis
with an inability to deal with life stresses, such as chronic
illness, ﬁnancial problems, and relationship break-up,
pain,
etc. (1) As a reliable screening tool
for early suicide risk
(7), suicide acceptability refers to the possibility of accepting
suicide in various stressful life events (8). To assess the suicide
acceptability among university students, Phillips summed up
25 events in which they would consider suicide: HIV/AIDS,
incurable illness, drug dependence, a burden on others and no
future hope, chronic mental illness, elderly and no family to
provide support, severe depression, large debt due to gambling,
raped, imprisoned, homosexuality, death of a spouse, frequently
beaten by the spouse, severe economic loss, poor with no
prospects for improvement, chronic alcohol abuse, changed with
a crime, marriage plans interfered with by others, severe loss
of face, major fright, serious interpersonal conﬂict, divorce,
penalized at work, the suicide of family members or friends and
failed university entrance exam (8). Given the insidious suicidal
behavior, suicide acceptability can widely and accurately identify
high-risk populations before individual encounters real stressful
events (9).

WHO made suicide prevention a high priority on the global
public health agenda (1), and social support was recognized
as a signiﬁcant protective factor of suicide prevention (10).
Social support is deﬁned as the care, support, and assistance
from families,
friends, and communities (11). Adolescence
for many young people and involves identity
is stressful
formation and changes in sexuality, self-concept, social roles,
and relationships (12, 13). Social support, including objective
support and subjective support, may strengthen adolescents to
process their stress, facilitate coping, and increase adjustment
(14). Research on suicide found that: most university students
with a history of suicide attempts suﬀered from a poor
social support system and had a positive attitude toward
suicide behavior; while receiving more social support,
the
risk of suicide would be reduced (15). Gauvin suggested that
tangible assistance was the strongest predictor for suicide
prevention (16). Of course, no matter how excellent the social
support network is, it would not be very worthy until it is

utilized. A close network of families, friends, and community
connections is highly valued in Chinses society, which is
important
for adolescents and young adults to resist and
eﬀectively cope with the stressful events related to mental
health (17).

Despite growing evidence for the positive impact of social
support among adolescents and young adults, the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly deﬁned. The interpersonal theory of
suicide (18), an explanation from the relationship perspective,
emphasizes the positive eﬀects of relationships, and the negative
eﬀects of mental health problems.

Outbreaks of major life events put a lot of pressure on
an individual,
leading to many psychological problems and
challenges (19). Anxiety and depressive symptoms are the
most common mental problems of adolescents and young
adults (20), which are generally caused by negative life events
and a lack of social support (21). Anxiety symptoms are an
adaptive emotional response to physical or mental challenges
and have been shown to have protective functions and damaging
eﬀects, producing anxiety disorder (22). Depressive symptoms
are about bad mood and negative beliefs and may lead
to some consequences, such as pessimism, personal quarrel,
and even suicide behavior (23, 24). Studies have reported
increasing rates of mental disorders in the university setting.
For instance, Wahed et al. revealed that
the prevalence
of anxiety and depression in medical Fayoum University
students were 64.3% and 60.8%, respectively (25). A lot
of behavior problems—such as drop-out of school,
internet
addiction, narcotics, alcohol, and other substance abuse—occur
because of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues
(26, 27). Suicide behavior is the most severe consequence
of mental disorders. Evidence supported that mental health
services could eﬀectively reduce suicide rates (28), such as
pharmacotherapy, cognitive therapy, and behavior therapy (29,
30). A review summarized the role of psychopharmacons in
suicide prevention and showed 40–81% reductions for suicide
risk after taking antidepressants, and psycho-social interventions
further improved the eﬀect (31). Mental health disparities are
present early in adolescence and increase throughout young
adulthood. Early intervention of these mental problems must be
a priority.

theory of suicide, high-

events which led university students to consider suicide and
explore the protective mechanism of social support (including

on suicide risk. The hypothesis was: anxiety and depressive
symptoms would play mediation roles in the association
between social support and suicide acceptability in Chinese
university students.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants and Processes
This study was cross-sectional research and conducted in Harbin,
Heilongjiang Province, China. We recruited the participants by
stratiﬁed random cluster sampling method and done as follows:
First, six universities were selected randomly from a dozen
universities; Next, we calculated the distribution of samples
from these universities as the proportion of participants; Finally,
we selected classes from all grades randomly, and students
in these classes were recruited as participants of this study.
Identiﬁed students were notiﬁed by administrators to come to
the classroom at a speciﬁc time. The students were told about
the purposes, content, and possible eﬀects of this study. The
survey was completely voluntary, and students had the right to
refuse to participate in the survey. All participants were advised
that the questionnaires should be ﬁnished within 30 min. Once
completed, the survey was brieﬂy reviewed by coordinators.
Eventually, we recruited 4,000 university students for our study.

Ethics Statement
The research met the ethical guidelines, and its approval was
granted by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University.

Instruments
The social support level was assessed with the Social Support
Rating Scale, which was created by Xiao (34). It included
three dimensions (subjective support, objective support, and
support utilization). There were ten items. And seven items
were answered on a 4-point Likert scale, and the others were
answered in a special way (calculating numbers of support
sources). Responses were calculated, and the scores of subjective
support, objective support, and support utilization ranged 8–
32, 1–22, and 3–12, respectively (35). Higher scores indicated a
higher social support level.

Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (36), created by Zung, was used to
measure the anxiety symptoms of university students. There were
20 items, which was evaluated by 1–4 score. In order to generate
the index score, the raw score was multiplied by 1.25, and only
the integer part was kept. The cut-oﬀ score for anxiety symptoms
was an index score of 50 (original raw score of 40) (37). Higher
index scores on the SAS indicated increasing levels of anxiety.

The Beck Depression Inventory (38), created by Aaron T.
Beck, was used to assess the depressive symptoms of university
students in this study. There were 21 items, which were evaluated
by a 0–3 score. The total score ranged from 0 to 63, and the cut-
oﬀ score for depression was 14 (39). Higher scores indicated a
higher depression level.

Suicide acceptability level was identiﬁed with the 25-item
scale of suicide acceptability (8). This scale was developed by
the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center and was
used to assess the likelihood that students would consider suicide
when they encountered diﬀerent types of life problems. All items
were answered on a 5-point Likert scale. The score of scale was
obtained by expressing the raw score converted to 100 points
scale. Higher scores indicated a higher suicide acceptability level.

Data Analysis
All data analyses were performed by SPSS 24.0 and MPLUS
7.0. The results were evaluated at a signiﬁcance level of P <
0.05 (two-tailed).

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic
characteristics (age, gender, major, family economic situation,
religion, and love status), social support, anxiety, depressive
symptoms, and suicide acceptability of this study samples.
Pearson’s correlation was performed for assessing associations
between social support, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and
suicide acceptability. Parallel multiple mediation analysis was
employed to test
the hypothetical model. Based on 1,000
bootstrap samples, direct and indirect eﬀects were evaluated
with 95% bias-corrected conﬁdence intervals. When the 95%
conﬁdence interval (CI) did not contain zero, the mediation
eﬀect was signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics
Three
valid
thousand nine hundred and seventy-two
questionnaires were collected from 4,000 (eﬀective response
rate: 99.3%). There were 1,929 (48.6%) males and 2,043 (51.4%)
females in this study. The average age of university students was
20.71 ± 1.397 years, ranging from 17 to 23. The 3,972 university
students were from diﬀerent majors as follows: Science 626
(15.8%), Engineering 1,690 (42.5%), Agronomy 463 (11.7%),
Medicine 306 (7.7%), Literature 548 (13.8%), and Management
339 (8.5%). There were 337 (8.5%) religious and 3,635 (91.5%)
non-religious in this study. Of these students, 1,825 (45.9%) were
not in love, 2,136 (53.8%) were in love, and 11 (0.3%) are in other
situations. In addition, 283 (7.2%), 2,687 (67.6%), and 1,002
(25.2%) students reported that they were in good, moderate, and
poor family economic situations, respectively.

As Table 1 showed, according to the mean score of each item,
all university students considered “drug addict,” “infected with
HIV,” and “incurable illness” as the three situations that would
most likely lead them to consider suicide. Table 2 indicated
that the mean score of suicide acceptability was 34.83 ± 10.05,
ranging from 1 to 100. University students of this study showed
a moderate possibility of accepting suicide in various stressful life
events. The mean scores for anxiety symptoms and depressive
symptoms were 39.98 ± 5.74 and 27.19 ± 5.84. According to the
norms for scales, university students had a low level of anxiety
symptoms and a high level of depressive symptoms. Moreover,
the mean scores for subjective support, objective support, and
support utilization were 18.79 ± 3.39, 6.57 ± 1.63, and 8.11 ±
1.85, respectively. Chinese university students presented better
subjective support and support utilization and a low objective
support level in this study.

support
showed that correlations between social
(subjective support, objective support, and support utilization)
and suicide acceptability were signiﬁcantly negative (P < 0.01).
But the relationship between objective support and suicide
acceptability was in the small association size (r = −0.055, P

< 0.01). In addition, anxiety and depressive symptoms were
associated with suicide acceptability (P < 0.01), as well as social
support among university students (P < 0.01).

Parallel Multiple Mediation Analysis
Figure 1 showed the ﬁnal parallel multiple mediation model of
the relationship between social support and suicide acceptability
among Chinese university students, with age, gender, major,
family economic situation, religion, and love status controlled.
As Figures 1A,C displayed, subjective support and support
utilization not only had a signiﬁcant direct negative eﬀect on
suicide acceptability but also had indirect eﬀects via anxiety
and depressive symptoms. While as Figure 1B presented, the
protective impact of objective support on suicide acceptability
totally worked through anxiety and depressive symptoms. The
statistical goodness of ﬁt of the multiple mediation model was
as follows: (1) in the mediation model of subjective support on
suicide acceptability, χ 2/df =7.362, CFI = 0.968, TLI = 0.935,
RMSEA = 0.040, and SRMR = 0.032; (2) in the mediation model
of objective support on suicide acceptability, χ 2/df =7.577, CFI
= 0.961, TLI = 0.922, RMSEA = 0.041, and SRMR = 0.034;
and (3) in the mediation model of support utilization on suicide
acceptability, χ 2/df =7.656, CFI = 0.968, TLI = 0.936, RMSEA
= 0.041, and SRMR = 0.032.

Additionally, mediation eﬀects of anxiety and depressive
symptoms were showed in Table 3. Anxiety (indirect eﬀect
= −0.022, 95% CI = −0.037 ∼ −0.009) and depressive
symptoms (indirect eﬀect = −0.197, 95% CI = −0.228 ∼
−0.163) mediated the relationship between subjective support
and suicide acceptability; meanwhile, the association between
support utilization and suicide acceptability was mediated by
anxiety (indirect eﬀect = −0.054, 95% CI = −0.088 ∼ −0.024)
and depressive symptoms (indirect eﬀect = −0.486, 95% CI =
−0.558 ∼ −0.422). However, the protective impact of objective
support worked totally through decreasing anxiety (indirect
eﬀect = −0.018, 95% CI = −0.035 ∼ −0.006) and depressive
symptoms (indirect eﬀect = −0.196, 95% CI = −0.246 ∼
−0.143). Moreover, the mediation eﬀects of depressive symptoms
had a stronger power than anxiety in the protective impact of all
kinds of social support on suicide acceptability among university
students. In the eﬀects of subjective support, objective support,
and support utilization on suicide acceptability, the mediation

DISCUSSION

Suicide has been recognized as a public health priority,
particularly during major life events. In the current study,
university students considered “drug addict,” “infected with HIV,”
and “incurable illness” as the three events that would most likely
lead them to consider suicide, indicating that health was the most
signiﬁcant point in suicide acceptability. Furthermore, for suicide
prevention, we found that social support negatively predicted
suicide acceptability of university students in 25 suicide-related
predicaments; moreover, diﬀerent types of social support had
diﬀerent eﬀect sizes and pathways on suicide risk.

As for suicide acceptability of university students, subjective
support and support utilization played the main protective
role, while the association between objective support and
suicide acceptability turned out
to be small. Adolescence
and young adulthood are stressful for students and involve
identity formation in self-concept, social roles, and interpersonal
relationships. According to the interpersonal theory of suicide, a
close network and social support contribute to the mental health
of adolescents and young adults (18). With a possible explanation
for social support’s buﬀer function in previous studies, suicide
risk had been decreasing when individuals received more social
support from their surroundings (40). All types of social support
were associated with increased mental health and decreased
suicide acceptability. Perception of spiritual and material support
from families, friends, and others, could provide power for
university students to deal with life stresses and overcome
life dilemma (41). Note that diﬀerent contexts may not allow
students to fully draw on the beneﬁts of social support. Our
ﬁndings indicated that social support could play a protective role
against suicide acceptability among Chinese university students
only when it was perceived. This suggested an urgent need to
cultivate adolescents’ ability to perceive social support and their
gratitude for providers of social support.

Furthermore, the results of this study showed that anxiety and
depressive symptoms of university students played mediation
roles in the associations between all types of social support
and suicide acceptability. Particularly, subjective support and
support utilization not only had a signiﬁcant direct negative
eﬀect on suicide acceptability but also had indirect eﬀects
via reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms; however, the
protective impact of objective support on suicide acceptability
totally worked through decreasing anxiety and depressive
symptoms. Chinese culture is highly collectivist (42). Chinese
university students are more likely to seek social support from
members of the in-group, such as families, peers, classmates, and
teachers. Social support, one of the most important protective
factors for adolescence to adjust to university, contributes to
fewer negative feelings, such as loneliness (43), anxiety, and
depressive symptoms (44). In China setting, university students
had more opportunities to get good social support and then
recovery from negative life events. Objective support, such as
ﬁnancial assistance, was negatively associated with suicide risk
by improving individual mental health. Subjective support had
impacts on both mental health and suicide risk in this study,
suggesting that university students needed essential subjective
care and help from families, peers, and society, not only objective
support. Support utilization was essential in the reduction of
suicide acceptability. More perceived social support was related
to increased personal growth and decreased mental health
problems (45). After reducing psychological distress, particularly
anxiety and depressive symptoms, university students live with
hope, motivation, and conﬁdence for life, and then suﬀer from
lower suicide risk (46). Moreover, the mediation eﬀects of
depressive symptoms turned out to have stronger power than
anxiety in the protective impact of all types of social support
on suicide risk in this study. When establishing a social support
network, more attention should be paid to reducing the level of
depression among university students. Improvement of mental
health beneﬁted from providing more individualized care and
support for university students.

Overall, the current study indicated that more attention
should be given to university students who encountered negative

Social Support and Suicide Risk

life events: “drug addict,” “infected with HIV,” and “incurable
illness.” Social support played an important protective role
against suicide risk, as well as in mental health. In this study,
mental health served as a nice explanation of the protective
mechanisms of social support on suicide acceptability. From the
mental health perspective, families, friends, classmates, teachers,
and communities should work together to establish and maintain
a better social support system for university students, if necessary,
help them seek professional mental health services.

Limitations
There were some limitations. First, since the study was cross-
sectional, we could not draw the conclusion that the associations
between factors were truly causative. Second, we assessed the
suicide acceptability level with the 25-item scale of suicide
acceptability, which was created in the Chinese university
setting. We are not sure whether our results generalize to other
populations. Third, depressive symptoms were assessed with the
Beck Depression Inventory, which was a scale focused on the
psychological symptoms of depression. Future studies should use
a clinician-rated scale such as the Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale, which is more focused on both physical and psychological
symptoms of depression (47). Moreover, given the self-report
instruments, there might be response bias. Improvement of
assessment instruments is necessary for future studies.

CONCLUSIONS

Among Chinese university students, suicide acceptability was
elevated when there was a health scare. “Drug addict,” “infected
with HIV,” and “incurable illness” were the top three events
for accepting suicide. Social support could eﬀectively protect
adolescents and young adults away from suicide risk. Speciﬁcally,
social support not only had a direct negative eﬀect on suicide
acceptability but also reduced the suicide risk via decreasing
anxiety and depressive symptoms.
