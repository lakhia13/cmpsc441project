Abstract
We examined the role of menopausal status in daily mood and cognitive performance among women with bipolar disorder 
(BD) compared to healthy comparison women. We analyzed the association of menopausal status, bipolar diagnosis, and 
their interaction on daily mood assessed by mobile surveys and attentional performance measured multiple times over 2 
weeks. Menopausal status was associated with more daily negative affect in women with BD, but not related to attentional 
performance.

Keywords  Bipolar disorder · Menopausal status · Daily mood · Attentional performance

Introduction

Sex differences have been observed in bipolar disorder (BD), 
a psychiatric disease characterized by alternating depression 
and mania and cognitive deficits. Compared to men, women 
with BD experience more depressive symptoms, more rapid 
cycling, and a higher rate of suicide (Perich et al. 2021), 
suggesting a possible role for reproductive hormones. Given 
the major hormone changes during menopause, it is sur-
prising that few studies have examined how pre- and post-
menopausal BD women differ in mood and cognition. BD 
patients experience more severe and chronic depression and 
higher anxiety peri-and post-menopause than those cycling 
(pre-menopausal) (Perich et al. 2021). Attention is one of 
the  most  affected  cognitive  domains  in  BD;  complaints 
of concentration are commonly found  in women  during

menopausal transition, associated with objective cognitive 
decline as well (Hogervorst et al. 2022).

Most studies used retrospective designs, with data col-
lected at one timepoint, making it unclear if changes in 
mood/cognition occur. Few examined mood ratings or atten-
tion over time in women with BD in different reproductive 
stages. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a pow-
erful technique to collect data about real-time mood states 
in daily settings, though used in women with premenstrual 
dysphoric disorder (Beddig et al. 2020), has not been used to 
understand the relationship of female reproductive status to 
mood in BD. Furthermore, despite evidence that the number 
and severity of prior mood episodes were strong indicators 
of cognitive impairments in BD (Burdick et al. 2022), the 
association between daily mood and cognition has not been 
assessed in the context of menopausal status in BD.

We examined mood, attention, and reproductive status 
in women with and without BD aged 25–60 years cross-
sectionally. Women with BD were expected to have less 
positive and more negative daily affect and worse attention 
compared to HC women. In BD and HC, though lesser in 
HC, we hypothesized post-menopausal women would have 
less positive and more negative daily affect and worse atten-
tion than pre-menopausal women. We expected less posi-
tive and more negative mood to relate to poorer attention, 
particularly in BD.

Methods

Data came from first-year visits of a longitudinal study 
of cognitive aging in BD and HC. Pregnant women, indi-
viduals younger than 18 years, and non-English speakers 
were excluded. In an initial visit, all subjects completed 
diagnostic and clinical interviews and self-rated their sleep 
quality (PSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Buysse 
et al. 1989; higher scores = worse sleep). Trained raters 
determined that all patients met DSM-IV diagnostic cri-
teria for BD or were free of any diagnosis (HC) and rated 
depressive (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; Hamilton 
1960) and manic (Young Mania Rating Scale; Young et al. 
1978) symptom severity.

Participants received surveys three times daily—morn-
ing, early afternoon, and evening—delivered to their own 
mobile device via SMS (text) messaging over 14 days. 
At in-person visits at the beginning, middle, and the end 
of this period, they completed a 5-choice computerized 
continuous performance test (5C-CPT; Bhakta and Young 
2017). Data from 86 participants who were women and 
completed at least 14 mobile surveys (minimum one sur-
vey per day), minimum one assessment of attention, and 
provided covariate data were analyzed. Participants were 
self-declared  as  cycling  or  post-menopausal  using  the 
Menstrual History Questionnaire, adapted from Roy-Byrne 
et al. (1986).

Mobile self-report surveys evaluated momentary affect 
for 7 items on a scale of 1, “not at all,” to 7 “very much.” 
Ratings were combined into positive (“energetic,” “con-
fident,” and “happy”) and negative (“sad or depressed,” 
“angry or upset,” “anxious or nervous,” and “stressed”) 
affect scores. We calculated means across all surveys dur-
ing the 2-week period. Participants completed 14 to 42 
(mean ± SD: 33 ± 6) surveys.

5C-CPT requires participants to respond to visual target 
stimuli with a button press while withholding response for 
non-targets. A sensitivity index (SI) was calculated based 
on hit rate (proportion correct responses to targets) and 
false alarm rate (proportion responses to non-targets) and 
averaged across the three administrations.

Analyses were performed using Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences 28. Continuous demographic variables 
were compared using general linear model, while the cat-
egorical race/ethnicity was compared using binary regres-
sion. General linear models examined group, menopausal 
status, and a group x menopausal interaction as predictors 
of the mean SI or mean affect scores. Age, years of edu-
cation, race/ethnicity, and PSQI scores were included as 
covariates to control for group differences in our sample 
and based on literature linking sleep changes to meno-
pause and to mood (Lee et al. 2008; Perich et al. 2021). 

Y. Liu et al.

For mood composites with a significant group x menopau-
sal status interaction, follow-up models examined indi-
vidual affect ratings. We reran mood models after remov-
ing outliers to see if results were held. We also examined 
the relationship of positive and negative affect to SI and 
whether this differed by diagnostic group, reproductive 
status, or diagnostic group x reproductive status interac-
tion. Level of significance was alpha = 0.05 (two-sided).

Results

Of the 86 women included, 47 were cycling (19 BD) and 
39 were menopausal (17 BD). Of the cycling group, 7 BD 
and 4 HC participants reported irregular cycling, and 2 
BD and 1 HC were over 50 years old, suggesting possible 
peri-menopausal status. As expected, compared to cycling, 
menopausal women had a higher average age (p < 0.001, 
Table 1). HC completed more years of education than BD 
patients (p = 0.002). BD women had higher average PSQI 
scores (p < 0.001), indicating worse sleep, and lower global 
cognitive T-score (p < 0.001) compared to HC. BD women 
showed higher variability in both mood and attention than 
HC groups.

No significant difference was found in 5C-CPT SI, nor was 
there a main effect of reproductive status (Table 1). Positive 
affect was lower in BD than HC (F(1,25.2) = 34.7, p < 0.001, 
𝜂2
 = 0.297), but no diagnosis x menopausal status significant 
interaction was found. However, negative affect was higher in 
BD than HC (F(1,31.2) = 70.8, p < 0.001, 𝜂2
 = 0.463), and there 
was a diagnosis x menopausal status interaction (F(1,2.9) = 6.5, 
p = 0.012, 𝜂2
 = 0.074); menopausal women with BD had more 
negative affect than the other three groups (Fig. 1A), even 
after considering covariates (F(1,1.9) = 4.0, p = 0.050, 𝜂2
 = 
0.058). Follow-up analyses found that “sad or depressed” and 
“stressed” affect in menopausal women with BD was higher 
compared to other groups (F(1,3.6) = 5.1, p = 0.027, 𝜂2
 = 0.058; 
F(1,5.9) = 6.4, p = 0.013, 𝜂2
 = 0.073); “stressed” in menopausal 
BD remained significantly higher when considering covariates 
(F(1,4.5) = 4.3, p = 0.043, 𝜂2
 = 0.062). Composite and individ-
ual affect differences persisted after sensitivity analysis remov-
ing one outlier (negative affect: F(1,2.3) = 5.9, p = 0.017, 𝜂2
 = 
0.068; sad or depressed: F(1,2.9) = 4.4, p = 0.039, 𝜂2
 = 0.052; 
stressed: F(1,5.1) = 5.8, p = 0.018, 𝜂2
 = 0.067). There was no 
diagnosis x reproductive status interaction for the 5C-CPT SI 
(Fig. 1B). Furthermore, there was no significant association 
between attention performance and negative and positive daily 
affect scores in either diagnostic (F(1,0.005) = 0.385, p = 0.537, 
𝜂2
 = 0.026) or repro-
ductive status group (F(1,0.002) = 0.170, p = 0.681, 𝜂2
 = 0.002; 
F(1,0.004) = 0.290, p = 0.592, 𝜂2

 = 0.005; F(1,0.025) = 1.995, p = 0.162, 𝜂2

 = 0.004).

Discussion

This study is the first using EMA to compare daily mood 
between menopausal and cycling women with and without 
BD. The results support our hypothesis that menopause is 
associated with daily negative mood in BD. Contrary to 
expectations, menopausal women with BD did not expe-
rience significantly lower positive mood in their daily life 
compared to other groups; menopausal women, whether in 
BD or HC groups, did not exhibit significantly poorer atten-
tional performance.

Our findings are consistent with prior research (Perich 
et al. 2021; Gilden et al. 2021) and persist after accounting 
for disparities in age and sleep quality. Collectively, these 
data support the premise that menopausal status, through 
mechanisms such as female sex hormone levels that continue 
to drop and remain low during post-menopause, elevates 
daily negative affect in BD women. That we did not see 
higher anxiety in menopausal BD might be due to assessing 
stress and anxiety separately or because momentary meas-
ures may be more representative of daily anxiety and less 
influenced by memorable high anxiety events than retrospec-
tive measures.

Attention was not impaired in BD vs HC in this sam-
ple, nor did we observe a relationship to reproductive sta-
tus or associations that differed by diagnostic group. Our 
BD participants may have been those with relatively intact 
cognition. The lack of difference by reproductive status in 
either HC or BD might be due to the less complex nature of 
5C-CPT cognitive test (Hogervorst et al. 2022).

Cognitive performance and daily mood were not sig-
nificantly related in either group. Our BD patients were 

generally experiencing only mild mood symptoms at the 
time of data collection. Prior studies found SI deficits only 
during BD mania, not when mood symptoms were mild 
or absent (Young et al 2020). Mild daily negative mood, 
although elevated somewhat in menopausal BD, might 
be too subtle to have a noticeable effect on attentional 
performance.

Study  limitations  include  (1)  lack  of  assessment  of 
reproductive history and hormone levels, (2) inability to 
compare individuals with different menstrual phases or 
within menopausal transition, (3) statistical control of age 
differences across menopausal status, which might not be 
adequate to isolate the unique effect of menopause, and 
(4) sample size too small to compare across ethnicities. 
In general, our findings suggested that women with BD 
may need additional support for negative mood symptoms 
during menopause and their treatment should emphasize 
reduction of depressive symptoms, particularly by allevi-
ating stress.
