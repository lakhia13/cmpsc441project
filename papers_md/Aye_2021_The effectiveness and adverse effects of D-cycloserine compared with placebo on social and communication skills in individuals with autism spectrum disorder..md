Background

A B S T R A C T

Symptoms  of  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  have  been  associated,  in  part,  with  the  dysfunction  of  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)
glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses and glutamate abnormalities. Medications related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such
as D-cycloserine - which is a partial agonist of the NMDA glutamate receptor - are potential treatment options for the core features of
ASD. However, the potential effect of D-cycloserine on the social and communication skills deficits of individuals with ASD has not been
thoroughly explored and no systematic reviews of the evidence have been conducted.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of D-cycloserine compared with placebo for social and communication skills in individuals with
ASD.

Search methods

In November 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases and two trials registers. We also searched the reference
lists  of  relevant  publications  and  contacted  the  authors  of  the  included  study,  Minshawi  2016,  to  identify  any  additional  studies.  In
addition, we contacted pharmaceutical companies, searched manufacturers' websites and sources of reports of adverse events.

Selection criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any duration and dose of D-cycloserine, with or without adjunct treatment, compared to placebo
in individuals with ASD.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted relevant data, assessed the risk of bias, graded the certainty of
the evidence using the GRADE approach, and analysed and evaluated the data. We provide a narrative report of the findings as only one
study is included in this review.

Main results

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We included a single RCT (Minshawi 2016) funded by the United States Department of Defense. It was conducted at two sites in the USA:
Indiana University School of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Centre. In the included study, 67 children with ASD aged
between  5  and  11  years  were  randomised  to  receive  either  10  weeks  (10  doses)  of  (50  mg)  D-cycloserine  plus  social  skills  training,  or
placebo plus social skills training. Randomisation was carried out 1:1 between D-cycloserine and placebo arms, and outcome measures
were recorded at one-week post-treatment. The 'risk of bias' assessment for the included study was low for five domains and unclear for
two domains.

The study (67 participants) reported low certainty evidence of little to no difference between the two groups for all outcomes measured at
one week post-treatment: social interaction impairment (mean difference (MD) 3.61 (assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale), 95%
confidence interval (CI) -5.60 to 12.82); social communication impairment (MD -1.08 (measured using the inappropriate speech subscale of
the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)), 95% CI -2.34 to 0.18); restricted, repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour (MD 0.12 (measured
by the ABC stereotypy subscale), 95% CI -1.71 to 1.95); serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31); non-core symptoms
of ASD (RR 0.97 (measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale), 95% CI 0.49 to 1.93); and tolerability of D-cycloserine (RR
0.32 (assessed by the number of dropouts), 95% CI 0.01 to 7.68).

Authors' conclusions

We are unable to conclude with certainty whether D-cycloserine is effective for individuals with ASD. This review included low certainty
data from only one study with methodological issues and imprecision. The added value of this review compared to the included study is
we assessed the risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Moreover, if we find new trials in future
updates of this review, we could potentially pool the data, which may either strengthen or decrease the evidence for our findings.

P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y

Is D-cycloserine effective and safe for social and communication skills deficits in people with ASD?

What is the aim of this review?

Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  a  relatively  common  disorder  involving  the  abnormal  development  of  the  brain.  It  often  leads  to
repetitive  behaviours,  restrictive  activities,  limited  interests,  reduced  social  functioning  and  language  skills.  There  are  no  effective
treatments for these features of ASD but recent research suggests that D-cycloserine might improve social and communication skills in
people  with  ASD.  D-cycloserine  is  a  type  of  medicine  used  to  treat  tuberculosis  (a  contagious  infection  that  usually  affects  the  lungs)
and schizophrenia (a serious mental disorder of thought, emotion and behaviour).  We wanted to know whether D-cycloserine, alone or
in combination with other treatment, was better or worse than placebo (dummy pill) at improving social and communication skills in
individuals with ASD. We also wanted to know if there were any harmful side effects from using this medication.

Key messages

There  appears  to  be no  clear  difference  between D-cycloserine  plus  social  skills  training  and  social  skills  training  alone  on social  and
communication skills in individuals with ASD. However, we are uncertain about these results.

What was studied in the review?

We searched databases of scientific studies and found one relevant study to include in this review. The study took place in the USA and
did not have industry funding. A total of 67 children aged 5 to 11 years were included in the study. One group took a medicine called D-
cycloserine once a week plus social skills training, and the other group took a placebo pill (dummy pill which does not include medicine)
plus social skills training. The treatment lasted for 10 weeks.

What are the main results of the review?

One  week  post-treatment,  there  was  no  difference  in  social  interaction,  repetitive  behaviours  and  language  skills  between  the  D-
cycloserine and placebo groups. Compared to placebo treatment, D-cycloserine may not increase the number of harmful side effects, the
number of people dropping out of the study and treatment responsiveness.

D-cycloserine may make little or no difference to social and communication skills deficits in individuals with ASD. These findings may
change if more studies are included. We do not know the long-term effects of D-cycloserine due to the short duration of the study.

How up-to-date is this review?

The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to November 2020.

Description of the condition

'Autism'  is  derived  from  the  Greek  word  autos,  which  means
'self'.  The  term  was  first  used  by  the  German  psychiatrist  Eugen
Bleuler  in  1911  to  describe  social  withdrawal  in  people  with
schizophrenia  (Moskowitz  2011).  The  child  psychiatrist  Dr  Leo
Kanner described infantile autism, a lifelong neurodevelopmental
condition,  in  1943  (Kanner  1943).  However,  the  first  two  editions
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
labelled  it  as  a  type  of  schizophrenia  occurring  in  childhood
(DSM;  DSM-II).  It  was  not  until  1980  that  infantile  autism  was
officially  recognised  as  a  separate,  stand-alone  category  in  the
DSM-III. When the DSM-IV was published in 1994, people could be
diagnosed  with  four  pervasive  developmental  disorders  (PDDs):
autistic  disorders;  Asperger’s  disorder;  childhood  disintegrative
disorder;  and  PDD–not  otherwise  specified.  Recently,  the  DSM-5
has  subsumed  all  four  PDDs  under  the  umbrella  term  'autism
spectrum disorder' (ASD). This classification is in line with the 10th
revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).

The definition of ASD comprises five criteria in the DSM-5, and the
ICD-11:

• social communication and social interaction impairment;
• restricted,  repetitive,  stereotyped  patterns  of  behaviour  and

interests;

• symptoms must be present in the early developmental period;
• symptoms  cause  clinically  significant  impairment  in  current

functioning; and

• these  disturbances  are  not  better  explained  by  intellectual

disability or global developmental delay.

It  is  estimated  that  one  in  160  children  worldwide  are  currently
diagnosed  with  ASD  (WHO  2018).  In  2014,  the  prevalence  of  ASD
in  eight-year  olds  in  the  USA  was  16.8  per  1000,  or  1  in  59  (Baio
2018).  Brugha  2011  reported  a  prevalence  among  adults  in  the
UK  as  one  in  100.  In  a  middle-income  country  such  as  Iran,  the
overall  prevalence  of  ASD  was  6.26  per  10,000  for  five-year  olds
(Samadi  2011).  By  contrast,  in  Nepal,  a  low-income  country,  the
prevalence  of  ASD  in  children  aged  nine  to  13  years  was  three  in
1000 (Heys 2018). The prevalence of ASD increases to 28% in people
with learning disabilities (Bryson 2008). In general, the prevalence
of  ASD  has  been  increasing  in  recent  decades,  due  to  increased
recognition, awareness and changes in diagnostic criteria for ASD
(Elsabbagh 2012).

ASD  is  more  common  in  males,  with  a  male-to-female  ratio  of
3:1  reported  in  a  recent  meta-analysis  (Loomes  2017).  Many  girls
with  ASD  may  be  undiagnosed  or  diagnosed  late  (Gould  2017).
According  to  Gould  2017,  girls  tend  to  be  more  passive,  and
the  interests  of  girls  with  ASD  are  similar  to  those  of  typically
developing girls (for example, a special interest in animals, music,
art and literature). Therefore, it can be more difficult for parents,
teachers  or  paediatricians  to  identify  girls  who  are  struggling  in
social situations (Cola 2020).

Aetiology

ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with symptoms becoming
noticeable 
in  early  childhood.  Genetic  problems,  such  as
mutations,  syndromes,  and  de  novo  copy  number  variations
(a  genetic  alteration  in  which  specific  sections  of  genome  are
deleted or duplicated and can lead to phenotypic diversity among
individuals),  are  thought  to  be  the  underlying  cause  in  10%  to
20% of people with the condition (Abrahams 2008). The chance of
people with ASD also having significant medical conditions ranges
from 0% to 16.7%; tuberous sclerosis and fragile X syndrome are
the  conditions  most  commonly  associated  with  ASD  (Lyall  2017).
Neuroimaging  findings  of  abnormalities  in  the  brain  structure
(dysfunctional  activation  and  abnormal  connectivity)  of  people
with  ASD  reflect  the  clinical  diversity  of  the  condition  (Ha  2015).
Advanced paternal age, birth complications associated with trauma
or ischaemia and hypoxia, vitamin D deficiency, and heavy metals
(mercury  and  lead)  poisoning  have  shown  a  strong  association
with  ASD  (Modabbernia  2017).  Immune  abnormalities,  such
as  maternal  infection  during  pregnancy,  maternal  autoimmune
diseases,  immune  dysfunction  and  gastrointestinal  dysfunction,
are  consistently  reported  in  ASD  (Matelski  2016).  A  recent  review
found that immune activation may be a cause of ASD or may just be
an epiphenomenon (a secondary effect that occurs simultaneously
with a disease but is not directly related to it) (Estes 2015).

ASD is comorbid with a number of other conditions. For example,
20% to 30% of children with ASD have seizure disorders (Tuchman
2010),  14%  to  78%  have  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder
(ADHD)  (Gargaro  2011),  and  11%  to  84%  have  anxiety  disorders
(White  2009).  A  systematic  review  that  focused  on  outcomes  for
people with ASD found that children with ASD whose early language
acquisition  was  not  considerably  behind  those  of  their  peers  at
the age of five or six have better adult outcomes than those who
showed a delay in language acquisition (Magiati 2014). That review
reported positive associations between these predictors and better
adaptive  outcomes  particularly  in  daily  living  skills  and  possibly
communication skills in adulthood (Magiati 2014).

A  glutamate  dysfunction  has  been  implicated  in  comorbidities
of  ASD.  For  example,  there  is  an  increase  in  the  downstream
effects of glutamate signalling in people with tuberous sclerosis, of
whom 20% to 40% have ASD (Rojas 2014). Blaylock 2009 theorised
that  the  male  predominance  in  ASD  is  attributable  to  foetal
testosterone,  which  enhances  glutamate  receptor  hyperactivity.
Although glutamate is implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD,
it  is  still  not  clear  how  glutamate  dysfunction  leads  to  the  core
symptoms  of  ASD  (Rojas  2014).  As  such,  glutamate,  a  major
excitatory neurotransmitter, and its receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA), have become targets in the treatment of ASD (Posey 2008).

Impact

Most children with ASD have reduced social functioning, cognitive
ability and language skills, and increased mental health problems
such as schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression
and anxiety (Magiati 2014). Because of these problems, adolescents
and  young  adults  with  ASD  can  face  many  challenges  with
independent  living,  friendship,  education  and  job  opportunities
(Magiati 2014). Parents of children and adolescents with ASD have
reported lower quality of life and higher levels of distress, anxiety
and  depression  than  parents  of  typically-developing  children
(Padden  2017).  In  addition,  parents  may  experience  high  levels

of stress related to finding diagnostic and treatment services, the
financial burden, and adapting family routines and daily activities
(Schiltz  2018).  Mothers  of  children  with  ASD  have  been  found
to  exhibit  higher  levels  of  parenting  stress  than  fathers  (Pisula
2017). Parenting stress is often associated with poor mental health
and  emotional  well-being,  which  reduce  involvement  in  social
activities  and  worsen  the  negative  social,  emotional,  academic
and  behavioral  outcomes  for  both  children  with  ASD  and  their
parents (Schiltz 2018). For example, heightened parental stress and
depression  can  worsen  challenging  behaviours  in  children  with
ASD, such as internalising (anxiety, sadness, reticence, fearfulness
and  oversensitivity)  and  externalising  behaviours  (aggression
towards  others,  hyperactivity,  self-harm  and  conduct  problems),
because parents who are under stress may have difficulty in coping
with the demands of parenting a child with ASD, and may not know
how to respond best to challenging behaviours (Schiltz 2018).

The  large  social  and  financial  burden  of  ASD  affects  the  families
of children with ASD, through lower levels of savings and reduced
income,  and  is  a  potential  burden  for  society  as  a  whole  (Ganz
2007).  In  the  USA,  the  total  annual  societal  costs  of  autism  were
estimated to be 35 billion US dollars (USD) for the entire cohort of
individuals with autism in 2007 (Ganz 2007). In the UK, the annual
cost of supporting people with ASD was estimated to be 2.7 billion
pounds sterling (GBP) for children and GBP 25 billion for adults; cost
calculation adjusted to 2005/2006 price levels (Knapp 2009). In the
USA, the annual cost of caring for people with ASD is expected to
exceed USD 461 billion by 2025 (Leigh 2015).

Description of the intervention

Pharmacological interventions have been shown to be ineffective
in treating the core features of ASD (NICE 2013), and drug treatment
is  currently  considered  a  short-  to  medium-term  intervention
for  co-existing  psychiatric  or  neurodevelopmental  conditions  in
individuals  with  ASD  (SIGN  2016).  D-cycloserine  has  been  widely
researched in neuropsychiatric studies and findings suggest it may
improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as affective
flattening  (lack  of  emotional  reactions),  loss  of  drive,  anhedonia
(loss of interest), and alogia (loss of fluency of thought) (Heresco-
Levy  2002).  D-cycloserine  acts  as  a  dose-dependent  agonist  or
antagonist  to  the  NMDA  receptor,  and  thus  its  dose  needs  to  be
optimised wisely (Goff 2012). Only low-dose D-cycloserine (50 mg/
day) is associated with an improvement in the negative symptoms
of  people  with  schizophrenia.  A  higher  dosage  (more  than  250
mg/day)  does  not  show  any  greater  improvement  than  50  mg
dosage and has more side effects (Goff 2012). Similarly, low-dose
D-cycloserine  given  intermittently  (once  a  week)  up  to  11  times
appears to be effective in the extinction of fear in anxiety disorders
(Rodrigues 2014).

Research in neuropsychiatric diseases suggests that D-cycloserine
may  be  of  use  in  ASD,  given  the  similarity  between  the  negative
symptoms of people with schizophrenia and the social impairment
of  people  with  ASD  (Goff  1999),  as  well  as  the  glutamate
dysfunction found in both disorders (McDougle 2005). Specifically,
an intermittent, once-weekly dosage of D-cycloserine persistently
improves  memory  consolidation  and  the  negative  symptoms  of
schizophrenia, whereas the efficacy of D-cycloserine is lowered in
schizophrenia with regular and repeated use, due to tachyphylaxis
(receptor down-regulation) (Goff 2008).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

For  over  50  years,  D-cycloserine  has  been  approved  by  the  US
Food  and  Drug  Administration  for  use  as  a  second-line  drug  for
the  treatment  of  advanced  tuberculosis,  at  a  dose  of  up  to  1  g
(Schade 2016). The most common adverse effects of D-cycloserine
occur  at  doses  higher  than  500  mg  (Schade  2016).  With  high-
dose  D-cycloserine,  the  reported  rate  of  neurological  adverse
effects  (commonly,  seizure  and  neuropathy)  is  1.1%,  whereas
the  proportion  of  psychiatric  adverse  effects  (notably  psychosis,
depression,  risk  of  suicide)  is  higher,  at  5.7%  (Hwang  2013).
Pyridoxine  deficiency  may  also  occur  during  treatment  with  D-
cycloserine,  since  D-cycloserine  is  a  pyridoxine  antagonist  and
causes increased renal excretion of pyridoxine. D-cycloserine is safe
at low doses because, at low doses, the side effects are minimal or
almost negligible (Schade 2016).

How the intervention might work

The specific mechanism by which D-cycloserine may improve social
and communication problems in ASD is not clear. D-cycloserine is
a  partial  agonist  of  the  NMDA  glutamate  receptor  with  subunits
known as NMDA Receptor 1 (NR1) and NMDA Receptor 2 (NR2) (A,
B, C, D), which are activated by glycine and glutamate, respectively
(Sheinin  2001).  In  addition,  D-cycloserine  has  partial  agonistic
action at NR1/NR2C receptors at low doses, and antagonistic action
on NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors at high doses (Danysz 1998).

NMDA  receptors  are  mainly  found  in  the  frontal  cortex  and
hippocampus,  and  are  responsible  for  sociability.  Diminished
NMDA  receptor–mediated  signalling  activity  is  associated  with
impaired  sociability  (Crino  2011).  Blood  glutamate  levels  are
higher  in  people  with  ASD  than  in  neurotypical  people  (Zheng
2016), and dysfunction of NMDA receptors at excitatory synapses
has  been  found  in  people  with  ASD  (Zhou  2013).  As  such,  low-
dose  D-cycloserine,  as  an  NMDA  receptor  agonist,  has  been  used
in  the  treatment  of  ASD  for  the  improvement  of  social  and
communication skills.

Why it is important to do this review

ASD  is  one  of  the  most  common  neurodevelopmental  disorders,
which can significantly reduce quality of life for both the person and
his or her family. At present, there are no first-line, evidence-based
pharmacological  treatments  recommended  for  the  core  features
of  ASD.  However,  some  medications  are  used  for  associated
characteristics; for example, behaviours of concern, hyperactivity
(Sturman 2017), and anxiety or depression (Hurwitz 2012; Williams
2013).

There  is  some  suggestion  that  D-cycloserine  may  be  an  effective
treatment for people with ASD. However, the effectiveness of the
drug  has  not  been  thoroughly  explored  and  there  are  currently
no  systematic  reviews  of  the  evidence.  At  present,  any  decisions
about dosage and schedule of treatment rest on assumptions that
what works in schizophrenia might work in ASD, because of some
symptom similarities (Goff 2012). This review will, for the first time,
collate all randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence of the effect
of  D-cycloserine  compared  to  placebo  for  people  with  ASD.  We
will  also  explore  the  effectiveness  of  different  dosages  and  drug
administration frequencies.

and  pharmacological  co-interventions 
(e.g.  antipsychotics,
psychostimulants,  antidepressants  or  mood  stabilisers)  with  a
stable dosage for a minimum of two weeks before randomisation.
We  also  included  non-pharmacological  co-interventions  such  as
behavioural  therapy,  speech  therapy,  occupational  therapy  and
dietary  modifications.  However,  we  excluded  participants  with
more  than  two  psychotropic  medications  and  glutamatergic
modulators  (e.g.  riluzole,  memantine,  etc.).  We  also  excluded
participants  with  social  and  communication  problems  due  to
other  established  causes  such  as  acquired  brain 
injury  or
neurodegenerative  diseases.  We  planned  to  exclude  studies  that
included initial treatment with a different medication because of
potential carry-over effects (Evans 2010).

Types of interventions

D-cycloserine  for  the  treatment  of  ASD,  irrespective  of  dose  or
duration and with or without adjunct treatment, versus placebo.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

measured  by  validated 
instruments,  such  as  the  Social
Responsiveness  Scale  (SRS)  (Constantino  2005),  Vineland
Adaptive Behaviour Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II) (Sparrow 2005),
and other valid scales

• Restricted,  repetitive,  stereotyped  patterns  of  behaviour  and
interests,  assessed  by  valid  scales,  such  as  the  Aberrant
Behaviour  Checklist  (ABC)  for  stereotypies  (Aman  1985),  and
other validated instruments

• Adverse events associated with D-cycloserine, assessed by the
number  of  non-serious  adverse  events  (headache,  vomiting,

scales

• Tolerability  of  D-cycloserine  (adherence  to  treatment  and
follow-up), assessed by the number of participants dropping out
from studies, as well as the timing and reason for exclusion from
studies, before study endpoints

On 

Data collection and analysis

We were unable to use all of our preplanned methods (Aye 2019),
due to only one RCT being included in the review. These methods
have been archived for use in future updates of this review in Table
1, pending the inclusion of more studies.

Selection of studies

Two  review  authors  (SZA;  HN)  independently  screened  titles  and
abstracts using Covidence. Next, we retrieved the full-text reports
of  all  potentially  relevant  records  and  assessed  them  against  the
inclusion criteria (Criteria for considering studies for this review).
Then, we categorised them as included studies, excluded studies,
studies awaiting classification, or ongoing studies (Higgins 2017).
We resolved any disagreements through discussion or, if required,
by consulting a third review author (HHS).

We  recorded  the  reasons  for  excluding  ineligible  studies  that
appeared relevant in the second stage of screening (Characteristics
of excluded studies tables).

We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a
PRISMA flow diagram (Moher 2009).

Data extraction and management

Using a pre-designed, piloted, standardised data collection form,
two  review  authors  (SZA,  HN)  independently  extracted  the
following information from the one included study.

• Methods: study design; total duration of study; number of study
centres and locations; study settings; withdrawals; date of study.
• Participants: number; mean age; age range; gender; severity of
condition; diagnostic criteria; inclusion and exclusion criteria.

• Interventions: 

intervention; 

comparator; 

concomitant

medications; excluded medications.

• Outcomes:  primary  and  secondary  outcomes,  with  reported

time points.

Two  review  authors  (SZA;  HN)  compared  the  extracted  data  for
accuracy,  resolving  any  discrepancies  through  discussion,  or  by
involving  a  third  review  author  (HHS).  One  review  author  (QZ)
transferred data into Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020)
and  a  second  review  author  (HHS)  checked  the  data  entry  for
accuracy (RevMan Web 2020).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Following the guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions  (Higgins  2017),  two  review  authors  (SZA,
HHS) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included study
across  each  of  the  following  seven  domains:  random  sequence
generation;  allocation  concealment;  blinding  of  participants  and
personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome
data; selective outcome reporting; and other bias. We considered
blinding of outcome assessment separately for different outcomes,
where necessary (e.g. for unblinded outcome assessment, risk of
bias  for  all-cause  mortality  might  be  very  different  to  that  for
participant-reported stress levels). We assigned a rating of low, high
or unclear (uncertain) risk of bias for each domain using the criteria
set out in Appendix 2, and provided a quote from the study report
together with an explanation for the judgment in the 'Risk of bias'
table.  We  resolved  any  disagreements  through  discussion  or  by
involving a third review author (STM). When we considered the risk
of bias to be unclear due to insufficient information, we contacted
the study authors for additional detail and recorded this in the 'Risk
of bias' table.

Measures of treatment effect

Dichotomous data

We  report  dichotomous  outcome  data  as  risk  ratios  (RR)  and
present these with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Continuous data

As we have included only one study, we report mean difference (MD)
with 95% CIs.

Unit of analysis issues

We did not encounter any unit of analysis issues.

Dealing with missing data

We  contacted  the  study  authors  and  requested  them  to  supply
any missing numerical outcome data, or to provide an explanation
about why they were missing and not available in the study report.
If data were made available to us, we included them in the analyses.
If  not,  we  reported  our  attempts  to  obtain  the  missing  outcome
data and its potential impact on the findings of the review in the
Discussion  section.  We  did  not  impute  the  missing  data,  and  we
only  analysed  the  available  data,  to  avoid  any  potential  artificial
inflation of the precision of the effect estimate (Higgins 2019).

Assessment of heterogeneity

We could not test for heterogeneity in this review due to only one
RCT being included in the analysis.

Assessment of reporting biases

We  obtained  the  protocol  of  the  included  study,  to  compare  the
outcomes  reported  in  the  protocol  with  those  reported  in  the
published paper. We made explicit judgements about whether the
included study was at high risk of reporting bias, according to the
criteria for selective outcome reporting set out in Appendix 2.

Data synthesis

We  were  unable  to  perform  a  meta-analysis  in  this  review  due
to  only  one  RCT  being  included.  Consequently,  we  provide  a

narrative  summary  of  the  results,  as  presented  in  the  original
study  report,  in  the  Effects  of  interventions  section.  To  illustrate
the  findings,  we  entered  the  data  into  RevMan  5.4  (RevMan  Web
2020) and generated forest plots. We present the data using a fixed-
effect model with inverse-variance weighting because we included
continuous data from only one study that had assessed different
outcomes from the same participants.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We could not carry out subgroup analyses in this review due to only
one RCT being included in the analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We could not perform sensitivity analysis in this review due to only
one RCT being included in the analysis.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence

We  created  a  'Summary  of  findings'  table  using  GRADEpro  GDT
software  for  the  comparison:  D-cycloserine  plus  social  skills
training  group  versus  placebo  plus  social  skills  training  group.
We  included  in  this  table  all  primary  and  secondary  outcomes,
assessed at one week post-treatment follow-up:

• social communication and social interaction impairment;
• restricted,  repetitive,  stereotyped  patterns  of  behaviours  and

interests;

• adverse events;
• non-core symptoms of ASD; and
• tolerability of D-cycloserine.

Following  the  recommendations  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for
Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2017;  Schünemann

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2019), two review authors (SZA; HN) independently evaluated the
certainty of the evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low
or very low, according to the five GRADE criteria: study limitations,
consistency  of  effect,  imprecision,  indirectness,  and  publication
bias. High certainty of evidence reflected that we are very confident
that the true effect is close to the estimated effect, and low certainty
of  evidence  indicated  that  we  have  very  little  confidence  in  the
effect we found. We resolved any conflicts in certainty of evidence
by consulting a third review author (QZ). We report these ratings in
the table, along with our decisions for downgrading the certainty
of the evidence, if relevant. We also include comments to facilitate
better understanding of our review by readers.

Results of the search

We  ran  searches  for  this  review  up  to  November  2020.  We  found
a total of 688 records and discarded 177 duplicates. We screened
the remaining 511 titles and abstracts in Covidence and excluded
501 irrelevant records (Figure 1). We obtained the full-text reports
of  the  remaining  10  records  for  eligibility  assessment.  Of  these,
we  excluded  three  studies  (six  reports)  and  reported  the  reasons
for  their  exclusion  in  the  Characteristics  of  excluded  studies
tables.  We  identified  one  ongoing  study  in  which  recruitment  of
participants  was  completed  but  results  were  not  yet  available
(Characteristics  of  ongoing  studies  table).  Finally,  we  identified
one randomised, placebo-controlled trial (three reports) that was
eligible  for  inclusion  according  to  our  selection  criteria  (Included
studies).

Included studies

We  identified  two  publications  and  one  trial  registry  record  of
one  randomised  controlled  trial  in  this  review  (Minshawi  2016).
This clinical trial reported ASD core symptoms at one week post-
treatment  and  12  weeks  post-treatment  (see  Characteristics  of
included studies table).

Study design

The  included  trial,  Minshawi  2016,  was  of  parallel  design  and
compared D-cycloserine plus social skills training with placebo plus
social skills training; randomisation was carried out  1:1 between D-
cycloserine and placebo arms.

Location and funding

The  included  study,  Minshawi  2016,  was  carried  out  in  the  USA
and  was  funded  by  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense.
The participants were recruited from academic autism treatment
centres, local schools and community organisations of the two sites
(University of Cincinnati and Indiana University).

Participants

The trial included 67 children with ASD (Minshawi 2016). The age
of  the  children  ranged  from  5  to  11  years,  with  55  males  and  12
females.  All  67  children  completed  the  one-week  post-treatment
assessment  and  60  completed  assessments  at  12  weeks  post-
treatment.

All the children were diagnosed with ASD by clinical assessment,
based  on  diagnostic  criteria  from  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fourth  Edition,  Text  Revision  (DSM-IV-
TR), and corroborated by administration of the Autism Diagnostic
Observation  Schedule  (ADOS)  (Lord  2000)  and  the  Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (Lord 1994).

In order to be eligible for inclusion, the children also had to exhibit
an  intellectual  quotient  of  more  than  70  on  the  Stanford-Binet
Intelligence  Scales,  Fifth  Edition,  and  a  standard  score  of  more
than 70 on the Communication domain of the Vineland Adaptive
Behavioural  Scale,  Second  Edition  (VABS-II).  These  criteria  were
used  to  ensure  that  the  children  had  the  minimum  cognitive  or
language skills for group social skills training.

Interventions

Treatment took place over 10 weeks, with children receiving either
one  dose  of  D-cycloserine  (50  mg)  or  one  dose  of  placebo  per
week,  30  minutes  prior  to  a  weekly,  group  social  skills  training
using  a  curriculum  that  included  Applied  Behaviour  Analysis
(ABA)  methodologies  (Baer  1968).  Social  skills  sessions  focused
on  shaping,  incidental  teaching,  positive  reinforcement,  visual
schedules, social stories, and weekly, parent-mediated homework
assignments.

Concurrent  psychotropic  medication  use  was  permitted  if  the
children were required to be treated for symptoms associated with
ASD (e.g. insomnia, inattention, hyperactivity, anxiety, irritability).
However,  the  children  had  to  have  been  on  stable  doses  for
a  minimum  of  two  weeks  (four  weeks  for  fluoxetine)  before
randomisation.  In  addition,  concomitant  psychotropic  treatment
had  to  remain  stable  throughout  the  treatment  intervention
and  the  follow-up  period  (Minshawi  2016),  for  the  durability  of
treatment effect analysis.

Outcomes

The  included  study  reported  four  different  standardised  primary
outcomes  for  the  core  features  of  ASD  and  adverse  effects  at
one  week  post-treatment  and  12  weeks  post-treatment.  The
first  primary  outcome  for  Minshawi  2016  was  social  interaction
impairment  measured  by:  Social  Responsiveness  Scale  (SRS);
Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC); Triad Social Skills Assessment
(TSSA);  and  Vineland  Adaptive  Behaviour  Scales,  Second  Edition
(VABS-II).  Minshawi  2016  used  the  Aberrant  Behavior  Checklist
(ABC)  and  Vineland  Adaptive  Behaviour  Scales,  Second  Edition
(VABS-II)  to  assess  the  outcome  of  social  communication
impairment  in  children  with  ASD.  The  primary  outcome  for
restricted,  repetitive,  stereotyped  patterns  of  behaviour  and
interests  was  measured  by  Aberrant  Behaviour  Checklist  (ABC)
stereotypic  behaviour  subscale.  According  to  the  stated  primary
outcomes of our review, we selected the SRS and ABC as our main
primary outcomes measures assessed at one week post-treatment
(Characteristics of included studies).

In  Minshawi  2016,  the  site  physician  recognised  and  recorded
adverse events in a log, along with the date of onset and resolution,
severity  and  relationship  to  study  intervention  (e.g.  definite,
probable, possible, remote or none).

In  order  to  measure  the  secondary  outcome  of  treatment,  non-
core  symptoms  of  ASD,  Minshawi  2016  used  the  Clinical  Global
Impression-Improvement  (CGI-I)  at  one  week  post-treatment
follow-up. Individuals with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 were considered
as having a significant improvement in non-core symptoms of ASD
while those with a CGI-I score of 3 or higher were not considered to
have had a significant improvement. The last secondary outcome
of  tolerability  to  D-cycloserine  was  measured  by  the  number  of
dropouts in both treatment and placebo groups.

Excluded studies

We  excluded  three  studies  (six  reports)  after  full-text  review.  We
excluded one study (two reports) because it was a pilot study and
not an RCT (Posey 2004). We excluded another study (three reports)
because it did not include the control group (Urbano 2014). We also
excluded NCT00198107 because the study participants received 24
weeks of initial treatment with aripiprazole, immediately followed
by  eight  weeks  subsequent  treatment  with  D-cycloserine.  There

Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Ongoing studies

One  study,  NCT00198120,  is  an  ongoing  RCT  entitled  'Safety  and
effectiveness of D-cycloserine in children with autism'. It is being
conducted at the Indiana University School of Medicine, USA, with
80 participants with ASD aged 3 to 12 years. This study compared
eight  weeks  of  treatment  with  D-cycloserine  with  placebo  in
children with ASD. The outcome measures used were the lethargy
subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Clinical
Global  Impression-Improvement  (CGI-I)  scale.  The  results  of  the

study are not yet available and the trial author did not respond to
our requests for further information. For further details, please see
the Characteristics of ongoing studies table.

Risk of bias in included studies

We judged the risk of bias for the included trial across the seven
domains  of  the  Cochrane  'risk  of  bias'  assessment  tools  (Higgins
2017). We stated the detailed assessment methods for the risk of
bias  in  our  protocol  (Aye  2019)  and  Appendix  2.  An  overview  of
the  risk  of  bias  is  summarised  below  and  in  a  graph  (Figure  2).
Further details can be found in the 'Risk of bias' table beneath the
Characteristics of included studies table.

Allocation

Blinding

The  included  study,  Minshawi  2016,  did  not  clearly  disclose  the
method of randomisation. It was reported as "randomly assigned
the participants to two groups" but no further details were provided
about how the randomisation process was executed. In addition,
no  details  were  available  on  method  of  allocation  concealment
after contacting the trial investigators for additional details. Thus,
we  rated  the  study  at  unclear  risk  of  bias  for  random  sequence
generation and allocation concealment.

Participants  and  caregivers  remained  blinded  to  study  group
assignment  and  treatment  for  the  included  study.  We  judged
performance bias to be at low risk because it was clearly stated as
triple blind in the trial register, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, before full
publication.

Outcome assessors were unaware of the treatment allocation until
after 12 weeks post-treatment follow-up visits and the data set was
locked. We judged the potential for detection bias to be low.

Incomplete outcome data

We  considered  Minshawi  2016  to  be  at  low  risk  of  attrition
bias.  Minshawi  2016  reported  outcome  data  for  at  least  98%  of
randomised children at the one week post-treatment time point,
with  only  one  child  dropping  out  before  treatment.  At  the  12
week  post-intervention  assessment,  60  children  completed  the
assessments.  Two  children  were  lost  from  the  treatment  group
and  six  from  the  placebo  group.  The  reasons  for  these  dropouts
were  stated  as  follows:  five  children  were  lost  during  follow-up,
one was excluded due to schedule conflict, one child discontinued
due  to  increased  irritability,  and  one  moved  to  another  area.
We  judged  Minshawi  2016  to  be  at  low  risk  of  attrition  bias
because the investigators provided sufficient information for loss
of participants.

Selective reporting

The study protocol was available online at www.ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01086475).  Across  all  of  the  publications  for  this  study,  data
were provided for all outcomes listed on the trial register. We rated
the  included  study  at  low  risk  of  selective  reporting  bias  as  the
outcome reports were comprehensive.

Other potential sources of bias

We identified no additional sources of bias and thus rated the study
at low risk of bias on this domain.

Effects of interventions

See: Summary of findings 1 D-cycloserine versus placebo for the
treatment of social skills deficits in people with autism spectrum
disorder

See Summary of findings 1 for the comparison: D-cycloserine plus
social  skills  training  versus  placebo  plus  social  skills  training  for
individuals  with  ASD.  We  extracted  change  from  baseline  to  one
week post-treatment data from the included study.

For this review, we were not able to perform a meta-analysis as only
one study was included. In Minshawi 2016, 67 children completed
the study and were assessed for the outcomes at one week post-
intervention. Of these, 60 children also completed assessments at
12  weeks  post-intervention,  which  was  reported  in  a  secondary
publication of Minshawi 2016.

D-cycloserine plus social skills training versus placebo plus
social skills training

Primary outcomes

Social communication and interaction impairment: social interaction

Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), parent-rated total scores

One week post-treatment

Minshawi 2016 reported change from baseline to one week post-
treatment scores on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale
(SRS)  (range  =  0  to  195)  using  the  items  that  measure  the  core
features of ASD, including social awareness, social cognition, social
communication,  social  motivation  and  autistic  mannerisms.  In
Minshawi 2016, SRS scores suggested that D-cycloserine plus social
skills  training  (SST)  resulted  in  little  or  no  difference  in  the  SRS
scores  compared  to  placebo  plus  SST  (MD  3.61,  95%  CI  -5.60
to  12.82;  67  participants;  low  certainty  evidence;  Analysis  1.1).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

A  positive  score  would  reflect  a  greater  improvement  in  social
communication for participants in the placebo group compared to
the  intervention  group,  whereas  a  negative  score  would  reflect  a
greater  improvement  in  the  intervention  group  compared  to  the
placebo group.

12 weeks post-treatment

Compared  to  the  placebo  plus  SST  group,  the  D-cycloserine  plus
SST  group  reported  a  large  increase  in  SRS  total  scores.  This
suggested that children who have received active treatment with
D-cycloserine were more likely to show sustained benefits of SST
at  12  weeks  post-treatment  (MD  -6.40,  95%  CI  -10.18  to  -2.62;  60
participants; Analysis 1.2).

Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II), parent-rated
scores for the socialisation subscale

One week post-treatment

VABS-II parent-rated scores for the socialisation subscale (range =
0 to 198 points) were reported at one week post-treatment and not
reported at 12 weeks post-treatment. The study reported little or
no difference in parent-rated scores on the socialisation subscale
of the VABS-II between the D-cycloserine plus SST group and the
placebo  plus  SST  group  at  one  week  post-treatment  (MD  0.24,
95%  CI  -9.91  to  10.39;  67  participants;  Analysis  1.3).  A  positive
VABS-II  score  would  reflect  greater  improvement  in  socialisation
skills  for  participants  in  the  intervention  group  compared  to  the
placebo  group,  whereas  a  negative  score  would  reflect  a  greater
improvement in the placebo group compared to the intervention
group.

Triad Social Skills Assessment (TSSA), parent-rated scores for social
interaction

One week post-treatment

TSSA  parent-rated  scores  (range  =  4  to  140)  for  social  interaction
were  reported  at  one  week  post-treatment  and  not  reported  at
12  weeks  post-treatment.  The  study  authors  of  Minshawi  2016
reported  little  or  no  difference  in  parent-rated  TSSA  scores  for
social  interaction  between  the  D-cycloserine  plus  SST  group  and
the  placebo  plus  SST  group  at  one  week  post-treatment  (MD
-1.95,  95%  CI  -5.46  to  1.56;  67  participants;  Analysis  1.4).  A
positive  TSSA  score  would  reflect  greater  improvement  in  social
interaction for participants in the intervention group compared to
the placebo group, whereas a negative score would reflect a greater
improvement in the placebo group compared to the intervention
group.

Social communication and interaction impairment: social
communication

Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), parent-rated scores for the
inappropriate speech subscale

One week post-treatment

ABC parent-rated scores (range = 0 to 12) for inappropriate speech
were  reported  at  one  week  post-treatment  and  not  reported  at
12  weeks  post-treatment.  In  Minshawi  2016,  ABC  parent-rated
scores  for  inappropriate  speech  at  one  week  post-treatment
suggested  little  or  no  difference  between  the  D-cycloserine  plus
SST  group  and  the  placebo  plus  SST  group  (MD  -1.08,  95%  CI
-2.34 to 0.18; 67 participants; low certainty evidence; Analysis 1.5).

A  positive  ABC  parent-rated  score  for  the  inappropriate  speech
subscale  would  reflect  a  greater  improvement  in  inappropriate
speech  for  participants  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  the
intervention  group,  whereas  a  negative  score  would  reflect  a
greater  improvement  in  the  intervention  group  compared  to  the
placebo group.

Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II), parent-rated
scores for the communication subscale

One week post-treatment

Minshawi  2016  used  parent-rated  scores  (range  =  0  to  194)  on
the  Vineland  Adaptive  Behaviour  Scales  2nd  Edition  (VABS-II)
communication subscale to rate overall change in communication
skills of children with ASD at one week post-treatment assessment.
There was little or no difference in the efficacy index of this scale
between  the  D-cycloserine  plus  SST  group  and  the  placebo  plus
SST group (MD -3.14, 95% CI -7.85 to 1.57; 67 participants; Analysis
1.6). A positive VABS-II score would reflect a greater improvement
in communication skills for participants in the intervention group
compared to the placebo group, whereas a negative score would
reflect a greater improvement in the placebo group compared to
the intervention group.

Restricted, repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour and interests

Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), parent-rated scores for the
stereotypy subscale

One week post-treatment

little  or  no  difference 

Minshawi  2016  used  the  parent-rated  scores  (range  =  0  to  21)
on  the  Aberrant  Behavior  Checklist  (ABC)  stereotypy  subscale.
The  analysis  showed 
in  stereotypy
symptoms  for  the  D-cycloserine  plus  SST  group  as  opposed  to
the  placebo  plus  SST  group  (MD  0.12,  95%  CI  -1.71  to  1.95;
67  participants;  low  certainty  evidence;  Analysis  1.7).  Higher
ABC  scores  reflected  severe  problem  in  stereotyped  patterns  of
behaviours  whereas  negative  scores  reflected  improvement  of
the  stereotyped  behaviour.  A  positive  ABC  parent-rated  score  for
the  stereotypy  subscale  would  reflect  a  greater  improvement
in  stereotyped  behaviour  for  participants  in  the  placebo  group
compared  to  the  intervention  group,  whereas  a  negative  score
would  reflect  a  greater  improvement  in  the  intervention  group
compared to the placebo group.

Adverse events

One week post-treatment

The  site  physician  monitored  adverse  events  at  all  visits  and
recorded  them  in  a  log  that  included  the  date  of  onset,  date  of
resolution,  severity  and  relationship  to  study  intervention  (e.g.
definite,  probable,  possible,  remote,  or  none).  Only  one  serious
adverse  event  (a  suicidal  comment  at  school  when  angry)  was
reported  in  the  placebo  plus  SST  training  group.  No  serious
adverse events were reported in the D-cycloserine plus SST group.
There  was  little  or  no  difference  in  non-serious  adverse  events
(headache, vomiting, cold, cough, increased motor activity, sleep
problems, aggression, restlessness, irritability, sadness, sedation,
etc.)  between  the  D-cycloserine  plus  SST  group  and  the  placebo
plus SST group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31; 67 participants; low
certainty evidence; Analysis 1.8). The number needed to treat for an
additional harmful outcome was 11 (95% CI -20 to 4).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Secondary outcomes

Non-core symptoms of ASD

Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global
Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) clinician-rated scores for treatment
response

One week post-treatment

In Minshawi 2016, the trained clinician blinded to treatment used
the  CGI-S  at  baseline  to  rate  symptom  severity  and  the  CGI-I  at
each follow-up visit to assess treatment response and efficacy of D-
cycloserine in children with ASD. Treatment responders were those
with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2, while non-responders to treatment were
those with a CGI-I score of 3 or higher. At one week post-treatment,
33.3%  of  the  D-cycloserine  plus  SST  group  were  responders  to
treatment compared to 32.3% in the placebo plus SST group. There
was  little  or  no  difference  in  responder  analysis  of  CGI-I,  which
assessed  the  therapeutic  effect  of  D-cycloserine  (RR  0.97,  95%
CI  0.49  to  1.93;  67  participants;  low  certainty  evidence;  Analysis
1.9).  The  number  needed  to  treat  for  an  additional  beneficial
outcome (NNTB) was 100 (95% CI -5 to 4).

Tolerability of D-cycloserine

One week post-treatment

In Minshawi 2016, 67 children completed the course of treatment
and the assessments at one week post-treatment. Only one child
dropped out before treatment began in the placebo plus SST arm
while  none  of  the  children  were  lost  in  the  D-cycloserine  plus
SST  group.  There  was  little  or  no  difference  in  tolerability  of  D-
cycloserine between the two groups at one week post-treatment
assessment  (RR  0.32,  95%  CI  0.01  to  7.68;  67  participants;  low
certainty evidence; Analysis 1.10). The NNTB was 33 (95% CI -20 to
9).

12 weeks post-treatment

Sixty  out  of  67  children  completed  the  12  weeks  post-treatment
assessment in the second phase. Two children were lost to follow-
up in the D-cycloserine plus SST group. Of the six children lost in
the  placebo  plus  SST  group,  one  child  was  lost  due  to  increased
irritability, three were lost during follow-up, one due to schedule
conflict,  and  one  moved  to  another  area.  There  was  little  or  no
difference in tolerability of D-cycloserine between the two groups
at 12 weeks post-treatment assessment (Minshawi 2016) (RR 0.29,
95% CI 0.06 to 1.33; 60 participants; Analysis 1.11). The NNTB was
3 (95% CI 1 to 17).

Summary of main results

We  found  only  one  completed  trial,  which  precluded  performing
a  meta-analysis.  The  included  study  reported  the  benefits  and
harms  of  D-cycloserine  in  the  treatment  of  ASD  (Minshawi  2016).
It  was  conducted  in  the  USA  with  a  total  of  67  children  from
5  to  11  years  old.  Minshawi  2016  compared  D-cycloserine  plus
social  skills  training  to  placebo  plus  social  skills  training  in
children with ASD. D-cycloserine was given to the children before
social  skills  training  -  with  the  hypothesis  being  that  it  may
boost  the  effects  of  this  training  -  rather  than  being  used  as
a  standalone  intervention  in  individuals  with  ASD.  The  duration
of  treatment  was  10  weeks.  At  short-term  follow-up  (one  week

post-intervention), we found no clear evidence that D-cycloserine
plus  social  skills  training  might  improve  the  primary  outcomes
of social interaction, communication and stereotyped patterns of
behaviour, although we rated the certainty of the evidence as low
and  so  we  are  uncertain  as  to  whether  these  findings  reflect  the
true effect. Although no serious adverse event was reported in the
D-cycloserine plus social skills training group, one serious adverse
event  (a  suicidal  comment  at  school  when  angry)  was  reported
in  the  placebo  plus  social  skills  training  group.  However,  there
was  little  or  no  difference  in  non-serious  adverse  events  such  as
headache,  vomiting,  cold,  cough,  increased  motor  activity,  sleep
problems, aggression, restlessness, irritability, sadness or sedation
between the two groups at short-term follow-up of one week post-
treatment.

We  also  found  little  or  no  difference  between  the  D-cycloserine
plus social skills training and the placebo plus social skills training
groups  for  the  secondary  outcomes  defined  in  this  review,  such
as  non-core  symptoms  of  ASD  and  tolerability  at  one  week  post-
treatment. See Summary of findings 1.

We  are  unable  to  draw  a  confident  conclusion  about  the
effectiveness  of  D-cycloserine  due  to  the  low  certainty  of  the
evidence,  meaning  that  the  actual  effect  may  differ  from  the
predicted effect at one week post-treatment and short-term follow-
up.

We identified one ongoing trial in which recruitment of participants
is completed (NCT00198120). However, the results of this trial are
not yet available.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

When interpreting the results of this review for completeness and
applicability,  we  need  to  consider  the  following  issues.  Only  one
randomised  controlled  trial  (RCT),  with  a  relatively  small  sample
size  of  67  children  (Minshawi  2016),  is  not  adequate  to  provide
clear  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  D-cycloserine  for  people
with  ASD.  The  study  included  children  ranging  in  age  from  5  to
11  years  and  was  conducted  in  the  USA.  Although  our  inclusion
criteria  did  not  place  any  limit  on  age,  we  still  do  not  have
any evidence regarding effectiveness in adults. These issues limit
the  applicability  of  the  results  to  the  wider  population  because
different  subgroups  of  population  may  have  different  thresholds
of  effect.  Moreover,  this  study  used  D-cycloserine  in  conjunction
with  social  skills  training  in  order  to  assess  the  impact  of  the
former  on  the  latter.  Hence,  it  is  unclear  what  impact,  if  any,  D-
cycloserine  alone  has  on  the  social  skills  deficits  in  individuals
with  ASD.  The  inclusion  criteria  for  participants  in  the  included
study  was  limited  to  people  with  ASD  who  are  high  functioning.
There was no available evidence regarding the effectiveness of D-
cycloserine for people with ASD who are low functioning. Reporting
of the methods of randomisation and allocation was incomplete,
meaning  we  were  unclear  as  to  whether  there  was  the  potential
for selection bias. Outcomes assessments in Minshawi 2016 were
at  one  week  and  12  weeks  post-treatment  follow-up.  Hence,  the
completeness  and  applicability  of  evidence  was  limited,  as  long-
term efficacy data was not reported.

Quality of the evidence

We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low for all outcomes
on the basis of our GRADE analysis because of imprecision (there

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

was  only  one  study  with  a  small  sample  size  of  67  participants)
and  unclear  risk  of  selection  bias  (insufficient  reporting  of
random  sequence  generation  and  allocation  concealment).  More
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with large sample sizes, from
multiple locations, are required to confirm the effectiveness of D-
cycloserine in people with ASD.

Potential biases in the review process

We used a comprehensive search strategy to find all relevant RCTs,
without  limiting  by  language  or  publication  status.  We  searched
multiple sources for ongoing and unpublished studies, but found
only one study with three reports. We also contacted the authors
of the included trial to obtain additional information for that study
and  any  ongoing  study.  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  that  we  missed
relevant trials. We attempted to minimise the bias in review process
by  using  pairs  of  independent  review  authors  to  screen  studies
for  eligibility,  and  to  extract  data,  assess  the  risk  of  bias  and
rate  the  certainty  of  the  evidence  from  the  included  study.  Any
discrepancies  arising  from  this  process  were  resolved  by  a  third
review author.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

We  were  unable  to  compare  our  results  with  other  systematic
reviews  because  there  were  no  systematic  reviews  addressing  a
similar question. We found two published randomised trials of D-
cycloserine in individuals with ASD (Posey 2004; Urbano 2014). We
excluded these studies because they had no placebo group. Posey
2004 was a prospective and single-blind trial with 10 participants
aged  5  to  27  years  old.  D-cycloserine  was  effective  in  improving
ABC  social  withdrawal  score  from  baseline  (P  =  0.02).  However,
there was no improvement in SRS and ABC (irritability, stereotypic
behaviour,  hyperactivity,  inappropriate  speech)  (Posey  2004).  No
serious  adverse  events  were  reported  in  Posey  2004.  Analysis  of
data from a double-blind, randomised, 10-week trial revealed that
D-cycloserine was effective in improving stereotypic symptoms in
21 participants with ASD aged 14 to 25 years old (P = 0.003) (Urbano
2014).  It  also  reported  D-cycloserine  may  improve  social  skills  in
terms of both the SRS and ABC lethargy/social withdrawal scores (P
<  0.001).  Additionally,  Urbano  2014  found  that  D-cycloserine  was
well tolerated in both daily and weekly dosage groups. The results
of our included study, Minshawi 2016, with respect to social skills
improvement and adverse events of D-cycloserine were similar to
those provided by Posey 2004 and Urbano 2014.

Implications for practice

This review provided low certainty evidence that D-cycloserine plus
social skills training might result in little or no difference in social
skills  deficits  for  individuals  with  ASD.  The  evidence  was  judged
as  being  of  low  certainty  due  to  methodological  issues  (e.g.  only
one included study, low participant numbers, and uncertain risk of
bias).  We  are  unable  to  make  any  firm  conclusions  regarding  the
benefits and harms of D-cycloserine in terms of social interaction,
communication  and  stereotypical  behaviour  in  individuals  with
ASD.

Implications for research

The  present  review  highlighted  the  critical  need  for  more
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) - with bigger sample sizes and
better  reporting  of  methodology  to  aid  judgements  of  bias  -  for
D-cycloserine in people with ASD. One main area of improvement
for  future  trials  is  to  separate  targeted  participants  by  age
(children  versus  adolescents  versus  adults)  due  to  the  potential
psychopharmacological effects of D-cycloserine on the developing
brain. Future research for ASD should be conducted by considering
the effect of D-cycloserine in combination with other medications
(e.g.  fluoxetine,  methylphenidate  (Ritalin),  sertraline)  and  other
behavioural  interventions  because  many  young  people  with  ASD
have  co-morbid  medicated  conditions.  Moreover,  future  trials
should  compare  various  doses  (e.g.  low  dose  <  50  mg  versus
high  dose  >  50  mg)  and  schedules  of  D-cycloserine  (e.g.  once-
weekly dose versus daily dose), and head-to-head comparison of
D-cycloserine with other medications. Furthermore, future studies
should utilise social skills as outcome measures of interest for D-
cycloserine because it is the main area of improvement through this
medication. To ensure maximum generalisability of the outcomes,

long-term follow-up (up to 12 months) should be planned in future
trials.

• Duration: 10 weeks
• Adminstration: 10 doses of placebo were given 30 minutes prior to weekly, group social skills training
• Age group: 5 to 11 years old

Outcomes

Primary outcomes

Outcome 1: social interaction impairment, measured by:

• Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)

◦ Outcome type: continuous outcome
◦ Reporting: fully reported
◦ Scale: 4-point Likert scale
◦ Range: within normal limit to severe range of impairment
◦ Unit of measure: 0 to 195
◦ Direction: lower is better
◦ Data value: endpoint
◦ Notes: the 65-item SRS is a standardised measure of the core symptoms of autism. Each item is
scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score of each individual item is summed to create a total raw
score. Total score results are as follows: 0 to 62 = within normal limit; 63 to 79 = mild range of im-
pairment; 80 to 108 = moderate range of impairment; and 109 to 149 = severe range of impairment.

• Triad Social Skills Assessment (TSSA)

◦ Outcome type: continuous outcome
◦ Reporting: fully reported
◦ Scale: 4-point scale
◦ Range: not very well to very well
◦ Unit of measure: 1 to 4
◦ Direction: higher is better
◦ Data value: endpoint
◦ Notes: the TSSA is a 35-item, parent-rated questionnaire with four subscales: (1) ability to under-
stand emotions and perspectives of others (affect) (8 items); (2) ability to initiate interaction (11
items); (3) ability to maintain interaction (11 items); (4) ability to respond to others (5 items). Each
item is scored on a 4-point scale: 1 (not very well) to 4 (very well).

• Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II)

◦ Outcome type: continuous outcome
◦ Reporting: fully reported
◦ Scale: 3-point scale
◦ Range: never performed to habitually performed
◦ Unit of measure: 0 to 2
◦ Direction: higher is better
◦ Data value: endpoint
◦ Notes: the Socialisation domain is a 99-item, parent-rated questionnaire with 3 subscales: (1) In-
terpersonal relationships (38 items); (2) play and leisure time (31 items); (3) coping skills (30 items).
Each item is scored on a 3-point scale: 0 (never performed), 1 (sometimes performed), 2 (habitually
performed).

Outcome 2: social communication impairment, measured by:

• Inappropriate Speech subscale (4 items) of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC)

◦ Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 (never a problem), 1 (slight problem), 2 (moderately serious

problem), or 3 (severe problem).

• Communication domain (97-items) of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II)

◦ Parent-rated questionnaire with 3 subscales: (1) Receptive (20 items); (2) Expressive (54 items);
(3) Written (23 items). Each item is scored on a 3-point scale: 0 (never performed), 1 (sometime
performed), 2 (habitually performed).

Outcome 3: restricted, repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour and interests, measured by:

• the Stereotypic Behaviour subscale (7 items) of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC)

◦ Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 (never a problem), 1 (slight problem), 2 (moderately serious

problem), or 3 (severe problem)

Outcome 4: adverse events

• Outcome type: dichotomous outcome
• Reporting: fully reported
• Range: serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events

Secondary outcomes

Outcome 1: non-core symptoms of ASD, measured by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)
scale

• Outcome type: dichotomous outcome
• Reporting: fully reported
• Scale: 7-point scale
• Range: very much improved to very much worse
• Unit of measure: 1 to 7
• Notes: at the end of treatment, participants were assessed with CGI-I and categorised as either re-
sponders to treatment (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) or non-responders to treatment (CGI-I score of 3 or higher)

Outcome 2: tolerability of D-cycloserine

• Outcome type: dichotomous outcome
• Reporting: fully reported

Risk of bias

Bias

Random sequence genera-
tion (selection bias)

Unclear risk

Quote: "Children with ASD were randomised to receive 10 weeks (10 doses) of
DCS or placebo in a 1:1 ratio."

Judgement comment: it was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial but did not state the method of randomisation clearly. We asked the au-
thors for clarification, but did not receive a response.

Allocation concealment
(selection bias)

Unclear risk

Judgement comment: the method of allocation concealment was not report-
ed.

Blinding of participants
and personnel (perfor-
mance bias)
All outcomes

Low risk

Quote: "10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low dose (50 mg)
DCS given 30 min prior to weekly group social skills training was conducted at
two sites, Indiana University School of Medicine and Cincinnati Children’s Hos-
pital Medical Center."

The study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 81 participants younger than 18 years. The
study participants were randomised to receive 8 weeks of initial treatment with aripiprazole or
placebo. If responsive to treatment, participants might have been assigned to an additional 16
weeks of aripiprazole and then an additional 8 weeks of aripiprazole with D-cycloserine. This study
was excluded because the initial treatment of aripiprazole could have a potential carry-over effect
on D-cycloserine treatment.

The study was a prospective single-blind pilot study which lasted for 8 weeks. Twelve participants
aged older than 5 years and with ASD were enrolled. Following a 2-week placebo lead-in phase, the
participants were administered three different ascending doses of D-cycloserine, 0.7, 1.4 and 2.8
mg/kg/day, each for 2 weeks. D-cycloserine treatment resulted in significant improvement in social
withdrawal. This study was excluded because it was not a randomised controlled trial.

The study was a double-blind randomised 10-week trial with no control group. Twenty-one par-
ticipants, aged 14-25 year, were enrolled and randomised to either 50 mg weekly or 50 mg daily
dosage of D-cycloserine for 8 weeks. At 2-week post-treatment follow-up, D-cycloserine resulted in
an improvement in social skills deficit in individuals with ASD in both daily and weekly groups. This
study was excluded because there was no control group.

Method

Approach

Types of outcome measures

In keeping with time frames of other ASD intervention reviews (e.g. Williams 2013), we would have
assessed outcomes at the following time points: short-term (up to three months); medium-term
(three to 12 months); and long term (over 12 months).

Measures of treatment ef-
fects

Dichotomous data

We planned to calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or harmful out-
come (NNTB or NNTH); that is, the number of participants needed to obtain a beneficial or harmful
outcome with the intervention, using the pooled RR.

Continuous data

We planned to report continuous data as either mean differences (MD), when studies assessed the
same outcome using the same scale, or standardised mean differences (SMD) when studies used
different scales to measure the same outcome, along with their 95% confidence intervals. For the
SMD, we planned to interpret the effect sizes using Cohen's 'rule of thumb', i.e. 0.2 represents a
small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect (Cohen 1988).

Unit of analysis issues

Cross-over trials

For cross-over trials, we believe that there might have be a carry-over effect of D-cycloserine that
outlasts any washout period, thereby making it impossible to gain 'clean' results unaffected by the
first period (Attari 2014). Hence, we had planned to include data from the first period only.

Studies with different doses of D-cycloserine

Assessment of heterogeneity

Had we identified studies assessing different doses of D-cycloserine in one trial, we would have
combined all dose groups and compared them with the results of the placebo group, making single
pair-wise comparisons; for dichotomous outcomes, we would have summed the sample sizes and
the numbers of people with events across groups, whereas for continuous outcomes, we would
have combined the means and standard deviations using the formula described in Section 6.5.2 of
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).

If primary studies had reported the results as a single value for the placebo arm (e.g. in a trial of D-
cycloserine with low-dose, high-dose and placebo arms, where the outcomes for the placebo group
were reported as one whole value), we would have split the data proportionately according to the
number of dosage groups, to avoid double counting the participants. For dichotomous outcomes,
we would have divided both the number of participants and the number of events by the number
of dosage groups in the study. For continuous outcomes, we would have divided the total number
of participants only, leaving the means and standard deviations unchanged.

If we had included at least two studies, we would have assessed clinical, methodological and statis-
tical heterogeneity. For clinical heterogeneity, we would have compared the distribution of partic-
ipant characteristics between studies (e.g. age, gender), whereas for methodological heterogene-
ity, we would have compared trial characteristics such as randomisation, allocation concealment,
blinding, and loss to follow-up. For statistical heterogeneity, we would have visually identified the
horizontal lines representing each trial on the forest plot for overlapping CIs. We would have used
the Chi2 test for homogeneity (interpreting a P value less than 0.10 as heterogeneity) and the I2 sta-
tistic to quantify the degree of heterogeneity. We would have interpreted the I2 values using the
following thresholds:

• 0% to 40%: might not be important;
• 30% to 60%: moderate heterogeneity;
• 50% to 90%: substantial heterogeneity; and
• 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.

As these thresholds can be misleading, when considering the importance of I2, we would have tak-
en into account the magnitude and direction of effects, and strength of evidence for heterogeneity
based on the P value from the Chi2 test (Deeks 2019).

Had the I2 value exceeded 50%, we would have used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. We
would have reported Tau2, a measure of between-study variance, when reporting results from the
random-effects model (Data synthesis).

Had we considered the studies to be too clinically heterogeneous, we would not have conducted a
primary meta-analysis but provided a narrative synthesis of the results instead (Data synthesis).

We would have explored the possible sources of heterogeneity by conducting prespecified sub-
group analyses (Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).

Assessment of reporting bi-
ases

Had we been able to pool more than 10 studies in a meta-analysis, we would have drawn a fun-
nel plot and examined it for any asymmetry, which might have been due to the following reasons
stated in Section 13.3.5.3 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Page
2019).

• Publication bias.
• Selective outcome reporting.
• Poor methodological quality causing spuriously inflated results in smaller studies.
• True heterogeneity, where the size of the effect differs according to the size of the study.
• Sampling variation leading to an association between the intervention effect and its standard

error.

While funnel plots might be useful in investigating reporting biases, there is some concern that
tests for funnel plot asymmetry (e.g. Egger's regression test; Egger 1997) have limited power to de-
tect small-study effects, particularly when there are fewer than 10 studies or where all studies are

of similar sample size. We would have consulted with a statistician before implementing such tests
( Page 2019).

Data synthesis

Had we been able to identify two or more studies with sufficient clinical and methodological ho-
mogeneity, we would have pooled the data in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model in Review
Manager 5 (RevMan Web 2020).

Subgroup analysis and inves-
tigation of heterogeneity

We would have carried out subgroup analyses if a sufficient number of trials had reported the fol-
lowing factors.

• Dose of D-cycloserine: low dose (< 50 mg) versus high dose (> 50 mg).
• Dosing interval of D-cycloserine: once-weekly dose versus daily dose.
• Age range: early childhood (two to five years old); middle childhood (six to 11 years old); adoles-

cence (12 to 21 years old); and adults (more than 21 years old) (Williams 2012).
• Intellectual disability: participants with intellectual disability versus those without.
• Comorbity: participants with comorbidity (e.g. anxiety, ADHD, other mental health disorders) ver-

sus those without.

Sensitivity analysis

We would have performed sensitivity analyses by repeating the meta-analyses after excluding trials
with:

• unclear or high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of appropriate blinding; and
• trials where missing data were imputed by the authors.

We would have conducted additional sensitivity analyses if we had identified other issues that
might have impeded our confidence in the estimated pooled effect sizes such as source of recruit-
ment (population or clinical), non-compliance or protocol violation, different definitions for the
outcomes, outliers or baseline imbalance across the intervention arms in primary studies.

Had we found substantial differences in effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses, we
would have presented the results separately; that is, we would not have presented the pooled da-
ta.

Appendix 2. 'Risk of bias' assessment

We judged the risk of bias in the included studies according to the criteria described below (see Higgins 2017).

Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)

We judged the risk of selection bias related to random sequence generation as follows.

• Low: investigators described a random component in the sequence generation process such as referring to a random number table,
using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots, or minimisation.
• High: investigators described a non-random component in the sequence generation process, for example, sequence generated by odd
date or even date of birth, sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission, or sequence generated by some
rule based on hospital or clinic record number. Other non-random approaches that could have happened much less frequently would
usually have involved judgement or some method of non-random categorisation of participants, such as allocation by judgement of
the clinician, allocation by preference of the participant, allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, and
allocation by availability of the intervention.

• Unclear: information about the sequence generation process was not clearly stated or was insufficient to permit a judgement of low

or high risk of bias.

Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)

We judged the risk of selection bias related to allocation concealment as follows.

• Low:  participants  and  investigators  enrolling  participants  could  not  have  foreseen  assignment  because  one  of  the  following,
or  an  equivalent  method,  was  used  to  conceal  allocation:  central  allocation  (including  telephone,  web-based,  and  pharmacy-
controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, or sealed
envelopes.

• High:  participants  or  investigators  enrolling  participants  could  possibly  have  foreseen  assignments  and  thus  introduced  selection
bias; for example, allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); using assignment
envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation
or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.

• Unclear: information about allocation concealment was not clearly stated or was insufficient to permit a judgement of low or high risk

of bias.

Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)

We judged the risk of performance bias as follows.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Low: blinding of participants and key study personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; no

blinding or incomplete blinding, but the outcome was not likely to have been influenced by the lack of blinding.

• High: no blinding or incomplete blinding and the outcome was likely to have been influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of key study
participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome was likely to have been
influenced by the lack of blinding.

• Unclear: study did not address this outcome; or there was insufficient information to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.

Blinding of outcome assessors (checking for possible detection bias)

We judged the risk of detection bias as follows.

• Low: no blinding of outcome assessment, but the outcome measurement was not likely to have been influenced by the lack of blinding;

blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.

• High: no blinding of outcome assessment and the outcome measurement was likely to have been influenced by the lack of blinding;
blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome measurement was likely to have
been influenced by the lack of blinding.

• Unclear: study did not address this outcome; or there was insufficient information to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.

Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias)

We judged the risk of attrition bias as follows.

• Low: no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring
unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing
data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk was not enough
to have had a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference
in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have had a clinically relevant impact on
observed effect size; missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.

• High: reasons for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing
data across intervention groups; for dichotomous outcome data, proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk
was enough to have induced clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect
size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was enough to have induced clinically relevant
bias in observed effect size; 'as-treated' analysis was done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned
at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.

• Unclear: study did not address this outcome; or there was insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit a judgement of low

or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).

Selective outcome reporting (checking for possible reporting bias)

We judged the risk of reporting bias as follows.

• Low: study protocol was available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that were of interest to the
review were reported in the pre-specified way; or the study protocol was not available, but it was clear that the published reports
included all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified.

• High:  not  all  of  the  study’s  pre-specified  primary  outcomes  were  reported;  one  or  more  primary  outcomes  were  reported  using
measurements, analysis methods, or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting was provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one
or more outcomes of interest in the review was reported incompletely so that it could not be entered in a meta-analysis; or the study
report failed to include results for a key outcome that was expected to be reported for such a study.

• Unclear: information was insufficient to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.

Other sources of bias (checking for other potential sources of bias)

We judged the risk of other bias as follows.

• Low: study appeared to be free of other sources of bias.
• High: at least one important risk of bias existed (for example, the study had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design

used, or had been claimed to have been fraudulent, or had some other problem).

• Unclear:  potential  risk  of  bias,  but  there  was  either  insufficient  information  to  assess  whether  an  important  risk  of  bias  existed  or

insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem would have introduced bias.

Swe Zin Aye (SZA) is the guarantor of the review and wrote the draft protocol and full text of the review. SZA and Han Ni (HN) independently
selected trials for inclusion and extracted data using Covidence. SZA and Htwe Htwe Sein (HHS) assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane
‘risk of bias’ tool. HHS resolved differences in opinion regarding study selection and data extraction, while San Thidar Mon (STM) resolved
differences in opinion regarding the ‘risk of bias’ assessment. Qishi Zheng (QZ) entered the data into RevMan, which HHS checked for
accuracy. SZA and QZ prepared the 'Summary of findings' table. QZ and Yoko Kin Yoke Wong (YKYW) contributed methodological advice
on the review and in interpreting the data. SZA and HN conducted the GRADE assessment, which was subsequently approved by QZ. All
review authors contributed to writing the protocol and review.

Title

We  included  ‘social  and  communication  skills’  in  the  title  of  the  review,  as  these  are  the  key  ASD  symptoms  that  D-cycloserine  is
hypothesised to target.

Objectives

We modified the objective of this review, by referring to the social skills deficits in people with ASD, as these are postulated to be targeted
by D-cycloserine.

Background > Description of the condition

Based on a suggestion from an Editor with Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems (CDPLP), we added a paragraph
on ASD in girls, the fact that it is often diagnosed later, and the different ways in which this presents (e.g. with masking of social skills
deficits).

Methods > Criteria for considering studies for inclusion in this review > Type of participants

Based on a suggestion from an Editor with CDPLP, we added more details about the types of participants eligible and not eligible for
inclusion. Specifically, we added the text below.

"We  intended  to  include  participants  with  any  intelligence  quotient  (IQ),  comorbid  disorders  (e.g.  anxiety,  depression),  and
pharmacological co-interventions (e.g. antipsychotics, psychostimulants, antidepressants or mood stabilisers) with a stable dosage for
a minimum of two weeks before randomisation. We also included non-pharmacological co-interventions such as behavioural therapy,
speech therapy, occupational therapy and dietary modifications. However, we excluded participants with more than two psychotropic
medications and glutamatergic modulators (e.g. riluzole, memantine, etc.). We also excluded participants with social and communication

problems due to other established causes such as acquired brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases. We planned to exclude studies that
included initial treatment with a different medication because of potential carry-over effects (Evans 2010)."

Methods > Criteria for considering studies for inclusion in this review > Types of interventions

In our protocol (Aye 2019), we wrote that we intended to compare D-cycloserine for the treatment of ASD, irrespective of dose or duration,
versus placebo. For clarity and to specify that adjunct treatments were eligible for inclusion, we added that this could have been with or
without adjunct treatment.

Methods > Criteria for considering studies for inclusion in this review > Types of outcome measures

We included the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II) scale to assess the social communication and social interaction
status of ASD because Vineland is often used to assess functional status of ASD.

Methods > Search methods for identification of studies > Electronic searches

WHO ICTRP was not available to search in November 2020 because the website was experiencing heavy traffic due to COVID-related activity.

We replaced WorldCat with ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global which recently became available to us and is a larger database.

Methods > Data collection and analysis

We were not able to use all of our preplanned methods due to including only one eligible study. See Table 1 of unused methods.

Methods > Data collection and analysis > Data extraction and management

We had originally planned to spot check the data entry for accuracy. However, we actually checked all data extraction thoroughly, as only
one study was included in the review. We have revised this sentence in this section of the review accordingly.

Methods > Data collection and analysis > Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We planned to assess outcomes at three- to six-months follow-up. However, we changed this to one week post-treatment follow-up, as the
included study used this time frame for follow-up assessment.

We changed 'quality of evidence' to 'certainty of evidence' throughout the review, in keeping with current recommendations.
