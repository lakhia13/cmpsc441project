Abstract

Objective: To assess whether patient socioeconomic status (SES) moderates the ef-

fectiveness of coordinated specialty care for first-episode psychosis and to investi-

gate possible mechanisms.

Data  Sources:  A  secondary  analysis  of  data  from  the  RAISE-ETP  Trial,  which  was 

conducted from 2010-2014.

Study  Design:  RAISE-ETP  was  a  cluster-randomized  trial  comparing  a  coordinated 

specialty care (CSC) intervention called NAVIGATE with usual community care. We 

constructed a patient SES index based on parental education, parental occupational 

prestige, and race/ethnicity. After identifying correlates of SES, we used OLS regres-

sion analysis to estimate treatment effects on the major study outcomes across quar-

tiles of the index. We also examined whether correlates of SES including the duration 

of untreated psychosis (DUP), and participation in NAVIGATE might account for the 

observed difference in effectiveness of CSC by SES.

Principal Findings: The trial sample had a similar SES distribution to the US popula-

tion, and SES was positively correlated with all mental health outcomes and several 

potential moderators at baseline. CSC substantially improved the main trial outcomes 

compared to community care for patients in the highest SES quartile but had small 

and statistically insignificant benefits for the remaining 75% of patients. Intervention 

participation rates and several potential moderators did not explain this disparity.

Conclusions: CSC may be more effective for high-SES patients with early psychosis 

than low-SES patients. Additional research is needed to understand why CSC is less 

effective for low-SES patients and to develop methods to increase effectiveness for 

this subgroup.

(N = 404 at 34 sites) comparing a coordinated specialty care (CSC) 
intervention called NAVIGATE to standard community care (CC) for 

patients  with  first-episode  psychosis  (FEP).  The  trial  showed  that 

NAVIGATE  improved  quality  of  life,  reduced  psychosis  symptoms, 
and was cost effective.2

Through the secondary analysis of clinical trials, researchers can 

identify  moderators  that  indicate  which  patients  benefit  the  most 

from treatment and therefore should be sure to receive it, and which 

patients benefit less, and may need a modified version of the inter-

vention.  Studies  of  the  moderators  in  clinical  trials  typically  focus 
on  known  prognostic  factors.3  To  date,  the  duration  of  untreated 

psychosis  (DUP)  is  the  only  significant  moderator  identified  in  the 

RAISE-ETP  trial,  with  virtually  all  clinical  benefits  accruing  to  pa-
tients with below-median DUP.2

Patient  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  is  a  complex  concept  that 

is challenging to measure and has not been commonly studied as a 
moderator  of  intervention  effectiveness  in  medical  research.4  The 

moderating role of SES may help illuminate persistent mental health 

disparities and high rates of psychiatric disability among low-SES pa-
tients.5 For example, low-SES psychiatric patients may have worse 

medication  adherence,  more  severe  symptoms,  poorer  cognition, 

What This Study Adds

•  Although patient socioeconomic status (SES) may influ-

ence the effectiveness of psychiatric treatment through 

several  channels,  few  studies  in  psychiatry  or  other 

fields examine the role of SES as a moderator.

•  The RAISE-ETP trial found moderate effects of coordi-

nated specialty care (CSC) on quality of life and psycho-

sis symptoms.

•  We show that CSC substantially improved the main trial 

outcomes for patients in the top 25% of the SES distri-

bution but had small and statistically insignificant ben-

efits for the remaining 75% of patients.

•  Additional  research  is  needed  to  understand  why  CSC 

is less effective for low-SES patients and to increase ef-

fectiveness for this subgroup.
