Abstract

Objective: The objective of this article was to provide an overview of the development and recommendations from the 
Australian evidence-based clinical practice guideline for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The guideline 
aims to promote accurate and timely identification and diagnosis, and optimal and consistent treatment of ADHD.

Methods: Development integrated the best available evidence with multidisciplinary clinical expertise and the prefer-
ences of those with lived experience, underpinned by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The 23 guideline development group members included psychiatrists, paediatricians,

general practitioners, psychologists, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, educators, Indigenous psychologists, 
and people with a lived experience; with two independent chairs and a methodologist. Where appropriate, evidence 
reviews from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2018 ‘Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Dis-
order:  Diagnosis  and  Management’  guideline  were  updated.  Fifty  prioritised  clinical  questions  were  addressed  in  14 
systematic reviews (new and updated from NICE 2018) and 28 narrative reviews.

Results: The 113 clinical recommendations apply to young children (5 years and under), children, adolescents and adults. 
They provide guidance for clinicians on identification, screening, diagnosis, multimodal treatment and support, including 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The guideline and supporting information are available online: 
https://adhdguideline.aadpa.com.au/

Conclusions: The guideline was approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Austra-
lia and relevant medical and allied health professional associations. It is anticipated that successful implementation and 
uptake of the guideline by organisations, health care providers and other professionals will increase delivery of evidence-
based treatment and improve health outcomes for the more than 800,000 Australians with ADHD.

Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neu-
rodevelopmental condition with an onset before 12 years of 
age (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). It is often a 
lifelong  condition  with  persistence  into  adulthood  in  60–
86%  of  individuals  (Cherkasova  et  al.,  2021). The  symp-
toms cause clinically significant difficulties with attention 
and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity, which are inconsist-
ent  with  a  person’s  chronological  or  developmental  age 
(American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013;  Cherkasova 
et al., 2021). To meet diagnostic criteria, the symptoms of 
ADHD must negatively impact areas of functioning such as 
academic and occupational functioning, family, social and 
intimate relationships, psychological functioning including 
self-view and self-esteem, the ability to complete daily liv-
ing  activities  and  participation 
leisure  activities. 
Moreover,  symptom  presentation  must  be  pervasive  and 
present  in  two  or  more  settings  (American  Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). ADHD occurs in approximately 6–10% 
of Australian children and adolescents and 2–6% of adults 
(Graetz et al., 2001; Sawyer et al., 2018). Given these prev-
alence  figures  and  the  current  population,  it  is  estimated 
there  are  at  least  800,000 Australians  living  with ADHD. 
The economic and well-being costs of ADHD in Australia 
are  estimated  to  be  $20  billion  annually  (Deloitte Access 
Economics, 2019; Sciberras et al., 2022).

in 

To date, there has not been a cross-discipline, evidence-
based  Australian  ADHD  clinical  guideline  approved  by 
Australia’s peak medical research body, the National Health 
and  Medical  Research  Council  (NHMRC).  This  has 
resulted in an absence of clear and consistent guidance for 
organisations and clinicians in the identification, diagnosis 
and treatment of ADHD across the lifespan. It has also had 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 57(8)

the unintended consequence of devaluing the lived experi-
ence of those with ADHD.

The  recently  NHMRC-approved  Australian  evidence-
based clinical practice guideline for ADHD (the Australian 
ADHD  guideline)  aims  to  promote  accurate  and  timely 
diagnosis, and provide guidance on optimal and consistent 
assessment  and  treatment  of  ADHD  across  the  lifespan 
(AADPA,  2022).  The  guideline  details  best-practice  for 
ADHD diagnosis and treatment and outlines a roadmap for 
ADHD research and policy. It includes a focus on everyday 
functioning, participation and quality of life for care based 
on  age,  gender,  culture,  setting  and  geography  of  people 
who are living with ADHD, and those who support them. 
The  Australian  ADHD  guideline  was  developed  through 
addressing the priorities of people with a lived experience 
of ADHD, health professionals, educators, and service pro-
viders. It integrates the best available evidence with multi-
disciplinary clinical expertise and consumer preferences to 
provide clinicians, educators, consumers and policy makers 
with guidance through 113 clinical recommendations.

Method

The Australian ADHD Professionals Association (AADPA) 
was invited by the Australian Government’s Department of 
Health  (Grant  Agreement  ID:  4-A168GGT)  in  2018  to 
deliver  the  Support  for  People  Impacted  by  ADHD 
Program.  Monies  from  this  grant  were  used  to  fund  the 
development  of  the  guideline.  No  other  funding  was 
received or used in the development of the guideline. The 
guideline  development  process  defined  by  the  NHMRC 
(2016) was closely followed to ensure transparent develop-
ment and conflict of interest processes.

The Australian ADHD guideline is based, in part, on the 
evidenced-based UK National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) guidance on the diagnosis and manage-
ment of ADHD (NICE, 2018). It was developed by updat-
ing the NICE evidence reviews, conducting new evidence 
or narrative reviews for questions not addressed by NICE, 
and  adopting  or  adapting  the  NICE  guidance  to  the 
Australian context.

The  methods  used  to  develop  the  Australian  ADHD 
guideline  were  aligned  with  international  gold  standard 
Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation (AGREE 
II) criteria, ADAPTE II, and Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment,  Development  and  Evaluation  (GRADE)  to 
meet  the  comprehensive  NHMRC  criteria  for  approval  of 
evidence-based  guidelines.  All  methods,  administrative 
documentation and the guideline, all recommendations and 
the  technical  report  can  be  found  at  https://adhdguideline.
aadpa.com.au/. Factsheets and other supporting information 
can also be found at this website.

Review of existing guidelines

Searches  for  existing  ADHD  evidence-based  guidelines 
were  conducted  by  the  project’s  methodologist,  with  25 
guidelines  published  between  2001  and  2018  identified. 
Only three completed evidence review searches within the 
previous  5  years.  The  most  current  of  those,  the  UK 
National  Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence  2018 
guideline 
‘Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder: 
Diagnosis  and  Management’  [NICE  guideline  NG87] 
(NICE,  2018),  covered  similar  content  to  the  other  two 
(German  Association  of  the  Scientific  Medical  Societies 
[AWMF],  2017;  Kemper  et  al.,  2018),  and  was  therefore 
selected for adaptation.

Development of priority clinical questions

Clinical questions were identified by the Australian ADHD 
Professionals  Association  (AADPA)  in  consultation  with 
stakeholders. The preliminary list of clinical questions was 
refined  through  a  structured  prioritisation  process  con-
ducted  by  a  multidisciplinary  group  representing  a  broad 
range of perspectives including clinicians, academics  and 
people with lived experience of ADHD, conducted over 2 
days of face-to-face workshops. Contributors reached con-
sensus on the resulting 50 clinical questions to be addressed 
by this guideline and the method for answering each (either 
a  new  or  updated  NICE  systematic  review  or  narrative 
review).

Guideline development group (GDG) and 
conflict of interest process

The multidisciplinary GDG was convened by inviting peo-
ple with experience living with ADHD, people caring for 

people  with  ADHD,  and  academics  with  experience  in 
ADHD, to participate in the development of the guideline. 
Disciplines  represented  included  psychology,  child  and 
adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry, paediatrics, general 
practice, applied neuroscience, speech pathology, occupa-
tional  therapy,  nursing,  education,  clinical  pharmacology, 
and  government  and  private  health  services.  There  were 
eight content subgroups led by members of the GDG.

A formal process was followed to identify and manage 
competing  interests  among  GDG  members. A  Conflict  of 
Interest (COI) was defined as an interest of a member of the 
GDG that conflicted with, or could be perceived to conflict 
with, the duties and responsibilities of membership and the 
process of guideline development. This included any out-
side interest which could introduce any bias into the deci-
sion  making  of  committee  members.  Potential  members 
were asked to declare any COIs over the 3 years preceding 
the formation of the group and any arising during guideline 
development.

Conflicts or potential conflicts were managed by a COI 
Management  Group,  which  comprised  the  two  GDG 
Chairs, and an ethicist (who also acted as the independent 
observer), who did not otherwise participate in the guide-
line development process. This group operated within the 
AADPA  policy  for  the  Identification  and  Management  of 
Potential  Conflict  of  Interests,  which  was  developed  to 
align  with  standard  A6  of  the  NHMRC  ‘Procedures  and 
Requirements for Meeting the 2011 NHMRC Standard for 
Clinical  Practice  Guidelines’  (NHMRC,  2011). The  inter-
ests of the Chairs were scrutinised by the independent eth-
ics expert of the COI Management Group and the President 
of AADPA.

Evidence review methodology

Update  of  NICE  evidence  reviews.  Where  appropriate,  evi-
dence  reviews  in  the  NICE  guideline  were  updated,  with 
permission. The selection criteria and search methods used 
in the NICE guideline (NICE, 2018) (https://www.nice.org.
uk/guidance/ng87) were adopted and rerun from the NICE 
2018  search  date  specific  for  each  question.  Additional 
identified evidence was tabulated using the same outcomes 
as NICE, assessed for certainty and GRADE (The GRADE 
Working  Group,  2009),  and  integrated  with  the  existing 
NICE evidence.

New evidence reviews.  Where no evidence review existed in 
the  NICE  guideline  to  address  the  clinical  questions,  the 
patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes 
(PICO) framework was used to explore the components of 
each question and finalise the selection criteria. These com-
ponents  were  used  to  design  the  search  strategies  and  to 
include and exclude studies in the evidence review screen-
ing  stage.  A  broad-ranging  systematic  search  strategy  for 
terms  related  to  ADHD  was  adopted  from  the  NICE 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 57(8)

guideline (NICE, 2018) (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/
ng87). It was combined with specific searches tailored for 
the clinical question according to the selection criteria and 
PICO framework. The search terms used to identify studies 
addressing  the  population  of  interest  were  not  limited,  so 
that  studies  addressing  people  with  ADHD  in  all  cultural, 
geographical and socio-economic backgrounds and settings 
would be identified by the search. The search strategy was 
limited to English language articles, and there were no lim-
its  on  year  of  publication.  Searched  databases  included 
Medline, PsycINFO, EBM Review, and EMBASE.

Study  selection  criteria  and  methodological  quality.  Studies 
were screened by the methodologist based on whether they 
met  the  PICO  selection  criteria  established  a  priori.  Full 
articles were retrieved for further assessment if the infor-
mation in the citation and abstract suggested the study met 
the selection criteria. Uncertainty was resolved through dis-
cussion among the methodologist and the leads of the eight 
GDG content subgroups. In addition to articles of primary 
studies, systematic reviews that met benchmark criteria and 
selection criteria were used if they reported outcomes and 
data,  additional  to  the  highest  quality  included  evidence. 
Risk of bias for each trial and GRADE quality for the body 
of evidenced was assessed using criteria developed a priori 
according to study design as outlined in GRADE.

Data  extraction  and  synthesis.  Data  were  extracted  from 
included  studies  into  ‘Characteristics  of  included  studies’ 
tables  with  relevant  details  (AADPA,  2022).  To  make  a 
summary statement about the effect of the intervention to 
inform  evidence-based  recommendations,  data  were  pre-
sented  in  tables,  and  where  appropriate,  using  statistical 
methods  such  as  meta-analyses.  When  participants,  inter-
ventions, outcome measures and timing of outcome mea-
surements were considered sufficiently similar, the Review 
Manager 5.3 software was used for meta-analyses.

Certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE evidence pro-
files.  A  GRADE  evidence  profile  was  prepared  for  each 
comparison within each clinical question, listed by outcome. 
For each prioritised outcome, a certainty rating was deter-
mined based on consideration of the number and design of 
studies  addressing  the  outcome,  and  on  judgements  about 
the risk of bias of the studies and/or synthesised evidence, 
inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and any other con-
siderations that may have influenced the quality/certainty of 
the  evidence.  This  overall  quality/certainty  of  evidence 
reflected the extent to which the confidence in an estimate 
of the effect was adequate to support a particular recommen-
dation (The GRADE Working Group, 2009).

All search strategies, PRISMA flow charts, and results 
for new and updated searches can be found in the guideline 
Technical  Report 
(https://adhdguideline.aadpa.com.au/
about/technical-report/).

Narrative reviews

Narrative  reviews  were  completed  where  questions  were 
less well suited to a systematic evidence review format, and 
where there was insufficient evidence identified for a ques-
tion  where  an  evidence  review  was  conducted.  Narrative 
reviews were prepared by small groups of GDG members 
according to their content expertise. Reviews included key 
information to answer the clinical question and to guide the 
GDG to draft clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) 
or clinical practice points (CPP) and were informed by pub-
lished research and clinical experience.

Recommendation development

Evidence-based  recommendations  were  underpinned  by 
the  GRADE  framework.  This  considers  the  volume  and 
quality of evidence informing a recommendation, and the 
feasibility, acceptability, applicability, cost and implemen-
tation considerations of the recommendation.

Specific,  unambiguous,  actionable  recommendations 
were  drafted  by  the  GDG  taking  into  consideration  evi-
dence certainty, relevance to the Australian population, the 
balance of benefits and harms, the values and preferences 
of the community and clinicians, resource implications, and 
feasibility  and  fairness,  using  the  GRADE  framework. 
Three types of recommendations were made, as described 
in Table  1.  Recommendation  wording  reflected  the  GDG 
overall interpretation of the evidence and other considera-
tions.  The  word  ‘should’  indicates  the  GDG’s  judgement 
that  the  benefits  of  the  recommended  action  exceed  the 
harms.  ‘Could’  indicates  that  the  quality  of  evidence  was 
limited,  the  available  studies  did  not  clearly  demonstrate 
advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of 
benefits to harm was unclear. ‘Should not’ indicates either 
a  lack  of  appropriate  evidence,  or  that  the  harms  were 
judged to outweigh the benefits.

The 50 prioritised clinical questions were addressed in 
14 systematic reviews (new and updated from NICE, 2018) 
and  28  narrative  reviews,  generating  113  clinical  recom-
mendations and an additional 21 education, service, policy 
and research recommendations.

Results

The  evidence-based  recommendations  derived  from  the 
evidence reviews can be found in Table 2. The full set of 
recommendations is available online at: https://adhdguide

CPP

Evidence-based recommendation: a structured/systematic evidence review was performed to answer a prioritised 
question to inform the recommendation.

Clinical consensus recommendation: recommendation was developed in either of the following ways:
• 

 Evidence to answer a prioritised question was sought, but there was insufficient evidence to inform an EBR. 
Therefore, a narrative review was prepared by an expert subgroup of the guideline development group (GDG)
 For questions of lower priority, or where high-quality evidence is known to be limited or non-existent, evidence 
was not sought and an expert subgroup within the GDG prepared a narrative review.

• 

Clinical practice point: guidance based on expert opinion and clinical experience, provided on important issues arising 
from discussion of evidence-based or clinical consensus recommendations, outside the scope of the evidence-finding 
process.

EBR: evidence-based recommendations; CCR: clinical consensus recommendations; GDG: guideline development group; CPP: clinical practice points.

also  covers  information  about  the  course  of  ADHD  and 
changes  across  the  lifespan,  as  well  as  information  about 
co-occurring difficulties associated with ADHD.

Screening and identification

High risk groups.  Fifteen studies were found to update the 
NICE 2018 evidence review. In children and adolescents, 
12 different high-risk groups were explored, and 8 had sig-
nificantly  higher  risk  of  having  ADHD  than  the  control 
groups (in order of risk):

•• People with autism
•• Children in out of home care
•• People with epilepsy
•• People with intellectual disability
•• People with oppositional defiant disorders
•• People with anxiety disorders
•• People with extremely preterm birth
•• People with tic disorders

In  adults,  nine  different  high-risk  groups  were  identified 
and seven of the nine had significantly higher risk of ADHD 
than the control groups (in order of risk):

•• People with borderline personality disorder
•• People with Internet addiction
•• People with psychotic disorders
•• People with substance use disorder
•• People with intermittent explosive disorder
•• People with a family history of ADHD
•• People with suicidal ideation/behaviour

A further narrative review identified additional groups, for 
example,  people  with  foetal  alcohol  spectrum  disorder 
(Lange et al., 2018), extremely low birth weight (Momany 
et al., 2018), eating disorders such as binge eating disorder 
(Wentz  et  al.,  2005;  Yates  et  al.,  2009),  sleep  disorders 
(Cortese et al., 2009; Sedky et al., 2014), or problem gam-
bling  (Dowling  et  al.,  2015).  These  groups  were  not 

identified  in  the  NICE  recommendation,  nor  were  those 
with  suicidal  ideation/behaviour  and  Internet/gambling 
addictions. The narrative review also identified people with 
ADHD at risk of not being diagnosed, particularly women 
and girls (Hinshaw et al., 2022; Quinn and Madhoo, 2014).

Recommendations summary.  Clinicians should be aware 
that some groups of people are more likely to meet criteria 
for a diagnosis of ADHD, such as people with a family his-
tory of ADHD, people with other neurodevelopmental and 
mental health conditions and people in some settings, such 
as in out-of-home care. They should be aware that ADHD 
could be under-recognised in girls and women.

Screening.  A  narrative  review  was  conducted  given  the 
existence of a recent systematic review with meta-analysis 
on  this  topic  (Mulraney  et  al.,  2021).  Screening  rating 
scales for ADHD include clinician observation, self-report, 
parent-report, teacher-report or other informant-report. For 
children and adolescents, screening tools include (but are 
not  limited  to)  the  Vanderbilt  ADHD  Diagnostic  Rating 
Scale, Conners’ Rating Scales and Strengths and Difficul-
ties Questionnaires, and for adults the Adult ADHD Self-
Report  Scale  (ASRS)  and  Wender  Utah  Rating  Scale 
(WURS).

Mulraney  et  al.  (2021)  explored  the  sensitivity  and  
specificity  of  screening  tools  for  ADHD  in  children  and 
adolescents.  They  found  none  of  the  screening  tools  met 
acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity (defined as 
both  over  80%).  The  meta-analysis  comparing  high-risk 
with community-based study populations found no signifi-
cant difference in sensitivity and specificity.

In adults, there have been mixed findings in screening 
studies. A study of the ASRS found sensitivity and specific-
ity  rates  below  80%  for  the  general  population  (Kessler 
et al., 2005). Another study of individuals with ADHD and 
randomly selected controls from the population found both 
sensitivity and specificity levels at 80% and above for both 
the ASRS and WURS. There was better performance by the 
longer  WURS  than  the  ASRS  for  specificity  at  higher

sensitivity levels (Brevik et al., 2020). Other studies of the 
DSM-5 version of the ASRS, the ASRS-5, have found both 
specificity and sensitivity levels above 80% in non-clinical 
controls (Baggio et al., 2021; Ustun et al., 2017).

In high-risk groups, sensitivity and specificity have var-
ied. In individuals with major depression, the ASRS-v1.1 
showed both specificity and sensitivity below 80% (Dunlop 
et al., 2018). There was acceptable sensitivity but not speci-
ficity in studies of substance use disorders (Daigre Blanco 
et  al.,  2009;  Van  de  Glind  et  al.,  2013)  and  incarcerated 
women (Konstenius et al., 2015). A modified version of the 
Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale (BAARS-IV) showed 
sensitivity and specificity levels above 80% in adult prison 
inmates (Young et al., 2016). Studies of the ASRS-5 found 
acceptable sensitivity but not specificity in individuals with 
bipolar  disorder  and/or  borderline  personality  disorder 
(Baggio et al., 2021) and other clinical groups (Ustun et al., 
2017). Thus, screening measures may have difficulties dif-
ferentiating adult ADHD from other psychiatric conditions 
that have similar or overlapping symptoms.

The guideline acknowledged there may be underdiagno-
sis of ADHD in a range of education (primary, secondary or 
tertiary), health and correctional settings. However, the rec-
ommendations  were  based  on  the  levels  of  screening  test 
accuracy noted above and costs/benefits.

Recommendations 

summary.  Routine  screening 

for 
ADHD should not occur at the population level (for exam-
ple, in preschools, primary, secondary schools and univer-
sities/TAFEs).

Services and clinicians should be aware of the sensitiv-
ity and specificity of screening tools used. Positive screen-
ing  should  be  followed  by  comprehensive  clinical 
assessment for ADHD.

Diagnosis

Narrative  reviews  were  completed  for  making  an ADHD 
diagnosis,  co-occurring  conditions  and  differential 
diagnosis.

Assessment and diagnosis.  A recent review of the quality of 
five  major  international  diagnostic  guidelines  (National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, Scot-
tish  Intercollegiate  Guidelines  Network,  Canadian  Atten-
tion  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  Resource  Alliance 
[CADDRA],  British  Association  of  Psychopharmacology 
and the American Academy of Paediatrics) reported that all 
guidelines recommended a categorical diagnosis approach 
based  on  the  DSM  or  ICD  classifications  (Razzak  et  al., 
2021).  All  recommended  using  interview  and  question-
naires, as well as multiple informants, as key components 
of the diagnostic process. Also identified was a CAADRA 
review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published 
between  2006  and  2016  on  the  diagnosis  of  ADHD.  It 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 57(8)

found no strategies that achieved additional benefit beyond 
that of clinician interview in combination with rating scales. 
Direct observations such as observing children in their edu-
cational setting, neuropsychological and psychoeducational 
assessments,  computerised  cognitive  assessments,  neuro-
imaging  and  electroencephalography  (EEG)  did  not 
increase the accuracy of diagnosis. The recommendations 
for  diagnosis  were  consistent  with  NICE  and  CAADRA 
recommendations.

Co-occurring  conditions.  A  high  proportion  of  people  with 
ADHD  have  co-occurring  neurodevelopmental,  mental 
health and medical conditions. In children, the most com-
mon co-occurring disorders are oppositional defiant disor-
der,  language  disorders,  autism  spectrum  disorders  and 
anxiety disorders, with depressive disorders and substance 
use  disorders  emerging  in  adolescence.  Specific  learning 
disorders also commonly occur in people with ADHD and 
involve difficulties in reading, written expression or math-
ematics (DuPaul et al., 2013). Among adults with ADHD, 
the most common co-occurring mental health disorders are 
depressive  disorders,  bipolar  disorder,  anxiety  disorders, 
personality disorders and substance use disorders (Kessler 
et al., 2006). Medical conditions, such as epilepsy, can co-
occur with ADHD (Ilie et al., 2015; Lange et al., 2018). For 
people with ADHD and a co-occurring condition, the onset, 
duration and pattern of functional impact may help differ-
entiate the effects of ADHD from those of the other condi-
tion, to help guide the treatment plan.

Differential diagnosis.  Some medical disorders can be pres-
ent and have symptoms and signs similar to those of ADHD, 
such as obstructive sleep apnoea/sleep deprivation. Several 
medications can also produce symptoms similar to those of 
ADHD, for example, anti-epileptics such as Keppra (Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association, 2013). Clinicians should con-
duct  a  comprehensive  assessment  (including  history  and 
examination) to identify any possible differential medical 
causes for ADHD.

In addition to medical conditions, neurodevelopmental 
and mental health conditions should be considered during 
differential  diagnosis. These  disorders  may  be  potentially 
misdiagnosed as ADHD due to overlapping symptoms and 
consequences  (American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013). 
Careful consideration of the onset and course of symptoms 
is required to make decisions about differential diagnosis. 
For  example,  difficulties  with  concentration  and  focusing 
attention  that  are  associated  with  a  major  depressive  epi-
sode  are  usually  limited  in  duration,  whereas  attention 
problems  due  to ADHD  are  often  ongoing.  There  are  no 
specific conditions that must be excluded for a diagnosis of 
ADHD. DSM-5 provides further specific advice on differ-
ential  and  co-occurring  diagnoses  (American  Psychiatric 
Association, 2013).

Figure 1.  Non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.

Recommendations  summary.  A  thorough  assessment  by 
an appropriately trained clinician is needed to make a diag-
nosis  of  ADHD.  A  person  with  ADHD  may  have  one  or 
more other neurodevelopmental, mental health or medical 
conditions  that  make  diagnosis  and  treatment  more  com-
plex. Careful assessment of possible co-occurring or alter-
native conditions is required.

treatments,  in  a  way  that  instils  hope  and  motivation  and 
focuses on strengths. Information should be provided in a 
format that best suits the unique needs of the person with 
ADHD.  People  with  ADHD  and  their  families  should  be 
provided  with  information  about  support  and  advocacy 
groups, and financial support such as government disability 
support and benefits.

Information needs after diagnosis

Multimodal treatment

There is no robust research evidence on what information 
and  support  should  be  routinely  provided  at  diagnosis  to 
people with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD have 
expressed the need for concise, tailored and reliable infor-
mation (Ahmed et al., 2014). This includes information on 
the  causes,  mechanisms  and  potential  impacts  of  having 
ADHD  (Ahmed  et  al.,  2014).  There  is  a  need  to  provide 
information  to  the  person  with ADHD,  parents,  families, 
education institutions and workplaces about the symptoms 
and  functional  impact  of  ADHD,  treatment  and  support 
required, and to dispel myths. Given a lack of research in 
this  area,  the  NICE  guideline  recommendations  were 
adapted to suit the Australian context.

Recommendations  summary.  After  diagnostic  assessment, 
clinicians should provide the person with ADHD and their 
carers  with  education  and  information  on  the  causes  and 
potential  consequences  of  ADHD  and  evidence-based 

An  updated  evidence  review  was  conducted  and  no  
new  evidence  was  found,  as  such  the  recommendations  
from NICE were accepted and adapted for the Australian 
context.

Recommendations  summary.  Clinicians should offer multi-
modal  treatment  and  support.  Figure  1  summarises  the 
treatments  recommended  by  the  guideline.  Clinicians 
should  explain  that  pharmacological  treatment  is  most 
effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms and that non-
pharmacological  treatments  provide  additional  support  to 
minimise the daily impact of ADHD symptoms and associ-
ated  difficulties  (see  Table  3).  Clinicians  should  describe 
the  typical  benefits,  adverse  effects,  efficacy,  treatment 
length,  and  time  taken  before  symptom  or  functional 
improvements occur for each mode of treatment.

The  treatment  plan  and  sequence  of  treatments  should 
accommodate  the  person’s  preferences,  unique  needs  and

individual goals, and take into consideration their personal 
strengths and the impact of any co-occurring conditions.

As a child with ADHD grows up, their clinicians should 
plan for a smooth move from health services for children/
adolescents to adult health services.

Non-pharmacological interventions

An updated evidence review was conducted, and an addi-
tional  28  randomised  controlled  trial  were  identified  and 
included in new GRADE evidence tables (AADPA, 2022). 
NICE outcomes adopted for the guideline included the pri-
mary  outcome  of  ADHD  symptoms  and  secondary  out-
comes  including  quality  of  life,  other  symptoms  (e.g. 
executive  functioning  or  symptoms  of  other  conditions), 
functional outcomes, clinical global impression, academic 
performance, emotion dysregulation and self-harm, as well 
as  adverse  events.  Additional  important  secondary  out-
comes  for  parent/family  training  such  as  parent  self-effi-
cacy  and  family  functioning  were  explored  narratively. 
Non-pharmacological  interventions  were  categorised  by 
type  of  intervention  and  included  cognitive  behavioural 
interventions  delivered  via  parent/family 
training  or 
directly to individuals with ADHD; cognitive training; neu-
rofeedback; and organisational/school-based interventions. 
Narrative  reviews  were  conducted  to  explore  the  role  of 
ADHD coaching and peer support workers.

Table 4 and Figure 1 summarise the non-pharmacologi-

cal interventions.

Regarding parent/family training, the effectiveness var-
ied according to raters (parents, clinicians or teachers), with 
more benefits evident by parent report. There is limited evi-
dence to suggest improvements in child ADHD symptoms 
and/or functioning by teacher report, which is not surpris-
ing given the focus of parent/family training is on the home 
context.  Parents  are  typically  unblinded  when  rating  out-
comes, whereas clinician and teacher ratings can be blinded, 
which could introduce bias in parent ratings. As such, the 
quality of the evidence for parent/family training was low 
to moderate for children under 5 and low for children and 
adolescents.  It  is  also  noted  the  narrative  review  which 
explored additional outcomes of parent family functioning 
suggested benefits of parent/family training in one or more 
of these domains, but again through parent ratings.

Recommendations  summary.  Non-pharmacological  inter-
ventions  can  improve  broader  aspects  of  functioning  for 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 57(8)

individuals  with  ADHD  and/or  their  families.  Clinicians 
should offer guidance on lifestyle changes, such as promot-
ing  a  healthy  and  active  lifestyle,  including  considering 
sleep patterns, as these have the potential to improve day-
to-day functioning. Parent/family training should be offered 
to parents/carers of children and adolescents with ADHD to 
support the functioning of the family and child with ADHD. 
Cognitive-behavioural  interventions  should  be  offered  to 
adolescents and adults with ADHD. Making changes in a 
person’s school, university or workplace can help the per-
son with ADHD succeed. This can include physical changes 
or educating other people on how to most helpfully interact 
with the person with ADHD.

Pharmacological interventions

An  updated  evidence  review  was  conducted  regarding 
starting,  adjusting,  and  discontinuing  pharmacological 
treatment;  however,  new  studies  were  not  integrated  into 
the  NICE  findings  as  their  qualitative  assessment  had 
reached saturation (i.e. no further themes identified). A nar-
rative review was also conducted.

Starting,  adjusting  and  discontinuing  treatment  recommenda-
tions summary.  Evidence indicated that before prescribing 
medication  to  treat  ADHD  symptoms,  clinicians  should 
carefully assess the person’s general health, including the 
person’s  physical  health  such  as  medical  history,  current 
medications, height and weight, and conduct a cardiovascu-
lar  assessment.  Clinicians  should  explain  all  medication 
options including potential benefits and side effects. Clini-
cians and people with ADHD (and/or their parents/carers) 
should make treatment decisions together. Choice and dos-
age of medication must be optimised for each person. Clini-
cians  should  provide  adequate  information  about  the 
benefits  and  side  effects  of  medication  treatment  and 
address any concerns around long-term effects. The treat-
ing  clinician  should  review  progress  regularly  during  the 
dose-titration  period.  The  dose  should  be  titrated  against 
symptoms,  level  of  functioning  and  adverse  effects  until 
the optimal dose has been identified (i.e. the dose at which 
symptoms  are  reduced  and  functional  outcomes  are 
improved, with minimal adverse effects).

An updated evidence review of the efficacy of pharma-
cological treatments found 16 new studies. The same out-
comes for non-pharmacological treatments were used with 
primary  outcomes  being  ADHD  symptom  reduction  and

secondary  outcomes  including  improved  functioning  and 
quality of life. Evidence was combined  for studies of the 
same design, age range and medication types. There was a 
paucity of evidence for the effectiveness of medications in 
children under 5 years of age. As such, no evidence-based 
recommendation  about  medication  use  in  this  age  range 
was made.

Medication choice recommendations summary.  An expert in 
child  development  and  treating  ADHD  in  young  children 
should be involved in assessment and treatment decisions. 
For  children,  adolescents  and  adults,  evidence  showed 
monotherapy  with  methylphenidate,  lisdexamfetamine  or 
dexamfetamine was associated with a clinically important 
benefit, compared with placebo or other agents. It was rec-
ommended  that  methylphenidate  or  dexamfetamine/  lis-
dexamfetamine  should  be  the  first-line  treatment  for 
children  aged  5 years  and  over,  adolescents  and  adults, 
given the minimal difference in efficacy and tolerability in 
these agents. If one medication type or duration of action of 
stimulant  medication  is  not  effective  or  poorly  tolerated, 
then other stimulant types or duration of action should be 
trialled before trialling other medications such as non-stim-
ulants.  Practice  points  regarding  starting  either  short-  or 
long-acting  medications  were  made  that  differed  from 
NICE  recommendations,  using  an  informed  and  shared 
decision-making approach rather than specifying first-, sec-
ond- and third-line stimulants.

No new evidence was identified for sequence of phar-
macological/non-pharmacological  treatment  to  be  offered 
when the initial treatment is ineffective, inadequate or treat-
ment is not tolerated. If stimulants are not tolerated or are 
ineffective,  atomoxetine,  or  guanfacine,  and  additionally 
clonidine in children and adolescents, should be offered as 
a second-line treatment. Atomoxetine and guanfacine were 
the non-stimulant drugs with the most convincing evidence. 
For adults, third-line treatments with very low certainty of 
evidence  based  on  the  evidence  review,  that  could  be 
offered included bupropion, clonidine, modafinil, reboxe-
tine and venlafaxine. A practice point based on GDG clini-
cal expertise was made regarding fourth-line treatments for 
adults that could be offered and included lamotrigine, ari-
piprazole,  agomelatine,  armodafinil,  desvenlafaxine.  The 
third- and fourth-line medications included for adults in the 
Australian ADHD guideline were not included in the NICE 
guidance.

There was very little evidence on medication choice for 
people  with  ADHD  and  most  co-occurring  conditions. 
However, the available evidence did not suggest a different 
approach  was  warranted  for  a  different  choice  of ADHD 
medication  for  people  with ADHD  and  coexisting  condi-
tions, but there should be careful baseline assessments and 
consideration  of  drug  interactions,  slower  titration  and 
more  careful  monitoring  of  adverse  effects,  and  regular 
contact.

No  new  evidence  was  found  for  an  updated  evidence 
review  exploring  whether  planned  breaks  from  stimulant 
medication  should  be  taken. An  updated  evidence  review 
was conducted for medication monitoring and discontinua-
tion and one new study was identified. Evidence identified 
concerned  inadequate  follow-up  and  medication  review. 
Limited  evidence  showed  possible  worsening  of  ADHD 
symptoms on stopping medication but supported a reduc-
tion in adverse effects after withdrawal. The importance of 
assessing  the  overall  benefits  and  harms  of  medication 
should be examined as part of the annual review.

Monitoring treatment and discontinuation of treatment recom-
mendations summary.  Evidence showed the clinically impor-
tant  differences  in  sleep  disturbance,  decreased  appetite 
and weight changes in people with ADHD taking medica-
tion and that ongoing monitoring for these unwanted effects 
should be undertaken. People taking medication for ADHD 
should be encouraged to monitor and record their adverse 
effects. Standard symptom and adverse effect rating scales 
should be used for clinical assessment and throughout the 
course of treatment. A yearly review with an ADHD spe-
cialist is recommended including a comprehensive assess-
ment  that  revisits  the  areas  discussed  when  starting 
treatment and evaluates the effect of current treatment. This 
helps ensure that decisions around continuing or stopping 
treatment are fully informed.

Regarding adherence to pharmacological and non-phar-
macological  treatment,  an  updated  evidence  review  was 
conducted with four new studies identified. The evidence 
highlighted  time  management  and  forgetfulness  as  com-
mon barriers to adherence.

Medication  adherence  recommendations  summary.  Clini-
cians  should  be  aware  that  the  symptoms  of  ADHD  can 
reduce adherence, for example, forgetting to collect medi-
cation and/or organise review appointments to ensure unin-
terrupted supply of prescriptions.

Subgroups

Narrative reviews were conducted for three important sub-
groups identified in the guideline.

People  in  the  correctional  system.  ADHD  prevalence  is 
higher in custodial settings than in the general population, 
estimated to be 5 times higher among youth prisoners and 
10 times higher among adult prisoners (Konstenius et al., 
2015;  Moore  et  al.,  2016;  Westmoreland  et  al.,  2010; 
Young et al., 2015; Young and Thome, 2011). Unidentified 
and untreated ADHD increases the likelihood of offending, 
being arrested and incarcerated, being involved with prison 
incidents and recidivism. Many prison health systems are 
overstretched  and  focus  their  resources  on  the  acutely 
unwell. There are challenges in identification, assessment

and treatment including screening, psychological services, 
and  medication  administration,  particularly  stimulants.  If 
these  challenges  can  be  overcome,  there  are  many  likely 
benefits for prisoners, their families, the prison and its staff, 
the  criminal  justice  system  and  the  community.  Recom-
mendations  therefore  include  the  provision  of  screening 
and  treatment  opportunities,  including  coordination  and 
integration of care with community services.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  Currently, there 
is a lack of research on understanding, identifying, assessing 
and treating ADHD in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples  (Loh  et  al.,  2016).  This  lack  of  knowledge  may 
result in either over- or under-diagnosis and cause harm to 
Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  peoples  through 
stigma or a lack of treatment. For example, there could be 
misidentification of symptoms that could be otherwise con-
sidered as culturally appropriate behaviours. There is a need 
to provide culturally appropriate and competent care to all. 
Recommendations  include  the  need  to  conduct  culturally 
appropriate screening, assessment and treatment of ADHD 
in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. A strengths-
based focus should be employed wherever possible. Clini-
cians should be aware that ADHD symptom questionnaires 
and  other  tools  used  for  screening  and  assessing  ADHD 
may  not  be  valid  in  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander 
peoples and should be used with caution. Clinicians should 
seek  the  assistance  of  a  cultural  interpreter  or  Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander health worker.

ADHD  in  people  with  co-occurring  substance  use  disor-
ders.  ADHD  is  a  risk  factor  for  the  development  of  sub-
stance use disorders, and people presenting with substance 
use  disorders  are  at  increased  risk  of  ADHD  (Groenman 
et  al.,  2013;  van  Emmerik-van  Oortmerssen  et  al.,  2012; 
see also Faraone et al., 2021; Ozgen et al., 2020). Recom-
mendations include the need for those working in mental 
health  settings,  and  addiction  settings  to  be  aware  of  the 
high co-occurrence of substance use disorders and ADHD. 
Clinicians  treating  people  with  ADHD  in  these  settings 
should  routinely  screen  for  problematic  substance  use  or 
substance  use  disorders,  and  clinicians  treating  substance 
use disorder should routinely screen for ADHD, using best-
practice screening questionnaires. Formal diagnosis of sub-
stance  use  disorders  in  an  individual  with  ADHD,  and 
ADHD  in  individuals  with  substance  use  disorder  should 
follow  recommended  guidelines  for  both.  Treatment  rec-
ommendations are also made.

Conclusions

This  is  the  first  multidisciplinary,  evidence-based  clinical 
practice guideline for ADHD in Australia to be approved 
by  the  NHMRC.  It  has  attempted  to  balance  traditional 

medical,  biopsychosocial  and  social  disability  models,  to 
ensure a considered approach to the identification, diagno-
sis and support of people with ADHD. Through adoption of 
these recommendations, the guideline aims to improve the 
experience  and  health  outcomes  for  the  estimated  more 
than 800,000 Australians with ADHD. It is hoped that the 
guideline will make clinical practice more consistent across 
Australia by providing clear advice about evidence-based 
ADHD identification, diagnosis and treatment.

In  addition  to  the  clinical  recommendations  presented 
here,  the  guideline  makes  recommendations  for  research, 
service development, professional development and educa-
tion.  This  includes  recommending  that  primary  care  and 
public  mental  health  services  should  make  diagnosis  and 
treatment available to people of all ages with ADHD. This 
is underpinned by a need for ADHD training to be added to 
the curriculum of relevant clinical programmes and be pro-
vided  to  clinicians  working  in  organisations  that  provide 
services to people with ADHD, including all public health 
services (child, adolescent, adult).

It is noteworthy that of the 113 recommendations made 
in this guideline, a relatively small number (i.e. 12) were 
evidence-based  recommendations.  This  highlights  limita-
tions  in  the  extant  research  literature  of ADHD,  wherein 
there  is  a  lack  of  appropriately  designed,  controlled  and 
powered  studies  that  can  be  drawn  upon  to  make  recom-
mendations for best care in response to key questions raised 
by the ADHD community. It is also noteworthy that the cer-
tainty of the evidence underpinning the evidence-based rec-
ommendations  was  more  often  rated  as  either  low  or 
moderate  rather  than  high.  We  therefore  call  upon  the 
ADHD  research  community  to  work  with  clinicians  and 
individuals who have lived experience of ADHD to priori-
tise research questions and increase and focus their efforts 
to design high-quality studies. This can advance the scien-
tific  evidence-based  of ADHD  with  a  view  to  enhancing 
clinical  practice  and  improving  health  outcomes  for  indi-
viduals with ADHD.

In summary, this guideline provides a roadmap not only 
for ADHD clinical practice, but for research and policy, and 
highlights opportunities for further improvements in health 
care, research and policy to come.
