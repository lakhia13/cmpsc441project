Abstract

Anxiety and depression are prevalent among cancer patients, with significant negative impact. 
Many patients prefer herbs for symptom relief to conventional medications which have limited 
efficacy/side effects. We identified single-herb medicines that may warrant further study in cancer 
patients. Our search included PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Embase, and 
Cochrane databases, selecting only single-herb randomized controlled trials between 1996-2016 in 
any population for data extraction, excluding herbs with known potential for interactions with 
cancer treatments. 100 articles involving 38 botanicals met our criteria. Among herbs most studied 
(≥6 RCTs each), lavender, passionflower, and saffron produced benefits comparable to standard 
anxiolytics and antidepressants. Black cohosh, chamomile, and chasteberry are also promising. 
Anxiety or depressive symptoms were measured in all studies, but not always as primary 
endpoints. Overall 45% of studies reported positive findings with fewer adverse effects compared 
with conventional medications. Based on available data, black cohosh, chamomile, chasteberry, 
lavender, passionflower, and saffron appear useful in mitigating anxiety or depression with 
favorable risk-benefit profiles compared to standard treatments. These may benefit cancer patients 
by minimizing medication load and accompanying side effects. However, well-designed larger 
clinical trials are needed before these herbs can be recommended and to further assess their 
psycho-oncologic relevance.

characterized by anhedonia, the reduced ability to experience pleasure, insomnia or 
hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or 
guilt, difficulty concentrating, and repetitive thoughts of suicide or death.

According to the American Psychiatric Association, more than 25 million people in the 
United States suffer from anxiety disorders involving persistent, excessive worry or fear of 
objects or situations, and recurrent panic attacks (2016). Depression and anxiety are 
especially common in cancer patients (Anderson and Taylor, 2012), and negatively impact 
quality of life (Brown et al., 2010; Bultz and Carlson, 2005). One in three patients (32%) 
experience anxiety, depression, or adjustment disorder, which is characterized by feelings of 
stress in response to a major event such as a cancer diagnosis. Breast cancer patients were 
reported to be most affected (42%), followed by those with head and neck cancer (41%) and 
melanoma (39%). Risk factors for depression include poor performance status, as 
determined by using a validated version of The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale 
to measure functional status, pain, old age, and low-level education, while poor performance 
status, old age, and female gender were predictors of anxiety (Mols et al., 2013; Hong and 
Tian, 2014).

Depression and anxiety also contribute to long-term strain in cancer patients. In a recent 
survey of 3370 survivors, 40% reported moderate to high anxiety, and in approximately 
20%, moderate to high levels of depression lasted up to 6 years post-diagnosis (Inhestern et 
al., 2017). Depression can lead to serious consequences that include worsening quality of 
life (Higginson and Costantini, 2008), lower adherence to anticancer treatments (Mathes et 
al., 2014), suicide (Henriksson et al., 1995), prolonged hospital stays (Prieto et al., 2002), 
and reduced survival (Pinquart and Duberstein, 2010).

Conventional management of depression and anxiety disorders is based on pharmacotherapy 
and psychotherapy. However, antidepressants and anxiolytics act by modulating 
neurotransmitters that play a crucial role in both central and peripheral nervous system 
function (Schatzberg, 2015), and current drugs are not very effective in cancer patients 
(Ostuzzi et al., 2015). Of greater concern is their association with substantial side effects 
which include addiction, seizures, sexual dysfunction, headaches, and suicide (Fajemiroye et 
al., 2016), as well as interactions with anticancer treatments (Desmarais and Looper, 2009).

The last few decades have seen a significant rise in the use of natural remedies to treat 
various ailments including depression and anxiety. These products are perceived as safer 
alternatives to pharmacotherapy, with lower risk of adverse effects or withdrawal. Some, like 
chamomile (Srivastava and Gupta, 2007) and black cohosh (Henneicke-von Zepelin et al., 
2007) also have anticancer activities making them attractive choices for cancer survivors. 
Analyses of data from the National Health Interview Survey show that compared to the 
general population, cancer survivors reported greater use of complementary therapies, with 
one-third having taken an herbal medicine (Anderson and Taylor, 2012). In the United 
States, because these are regulated as dietary supplements available without a prescription, 
patients tend to self-medicate without informing their healthcare providers. While many 
herbs used in traditional medicine have been shown to have anti-cancer activities (Tariq et 
al., 2017), and some even have the potential to develop into treatments for cancer (Chen, SR

et al., 2016) or to address the adverse effects of chemotherapy (Chen, MH et al., 2016), few 
herbs have been studied in cancer patients and their mechanisms of action, adverse effects, 
and potential interactions with anticancer treatments are among the unknowns.

Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence from clinical trials 
involving botanical supplements for depression and anxiety independent of disease state. We 
hope that our findings will provide information that is clinically relevant to oncologists and 
cancer patients, facilitate physician-patient communication on this important topic, and 
provide guidance on the groundwork laid for herbs that may be worthy of further study in 
cancer populations.

Previous reviews have documented herbal remedies for the treatment of depression and/or 
anxiety (Farah et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2017; Muszynska et al., 2015; Bandelow et al., 2015; 
Sarris et al., 2011; Lakhan and Vieira, 2010; Ernst, 2006). One study used polyherbal 
formulas for both symptoms (Liu et al., 2015). Although such combinations are thought to 
have greater therapeutic value compared with single herbs (Parasuraman et al., 2014), it is 
difficult to identify the level to which each herb may contribute to overall effects. Therefore, 
we restricted our review to studies involving single herbs or extracts that are available in the 
United States as dietary supplements, and to randomized controlled trials. We also excluded 
those with known potential for herb-drug interactions that should be avoided by cancer 
patients, so as to better identify the herbs that have been studied, or may warrant future 
study, in this population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We conducted this systematic review according to the Cochrane Collaboration framework. A 
review protocol is not available. A comprehensive electronic literature search for articles in 
multiple languages was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Allied and 
Complementary Medicine (AMED), Embase, and Cochrane. The date filter was applied on 
each database to capture the last 20 years of the literature (1996–2016).

Three broad concept categories were searched, and results were combined using the 
appropriate Boolean operators (AND, OR). The broad categories included: clinical trials, 
botanical supplement products, and select mood disorders. Related terms were also 
incorporated into the search strategy to ensure all relevant papers were retrieved (Table 1).

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Meeting abstracts, 
comments, review articles and case reports were excluded. Studies involving St. John’s Wort 
were also excluded because it has been extensively researched, revealing many potential 
interactions with drugs that are P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A substrates (Whitten et al., 
2006). Also, the large body of literature merits a separate review.

Details of our screening selection process are provided in Figure 1.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Two reviewers (KSY, JG) independently reviewed the articles to be included. Any 
discrepancies were identified and resolved by additional deliberation. Details of herbs 
evaluated in multiple studies are summarized in Table 2, and include study design, sample 
population, intervention, control, treatment length, outcomes, and adverse events. Study 
details of herbs for which there is currently only 1 RCT available are described in Table 3.

RESULTS

A total of 100 articles involving 38 botanicals were identified that met the inclusion criteria. 
They appear here in the order of most to least studied botanicals, but appear alphabetically 
for ease of location in the tables. Among RCTs that met our criteria and had more than two 
RCTs (Table 2), saffron, kava, ginkgo, lavender, brahmi, and passionflower appeared to be 
the most studied.

Saffron, derived from the stigma of Crocus sativus flower, is commonly used as a spice and 
as medicine in the Middle-East and in South Asia. In patients with mild to moderate anxiety, 
extracts of saffron were reported to be effective in relieving symptoms in several RCTs 
(Mazidi et al., 2016; Akhondzadeh et al., 2005; Talaei et al., 2015). Studies also show that 
the effects are comparable to standard antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine (Noorbala et 
al., 2005)(Moosavi et al., 2014; Shahmansouri et al., 2014) and imipramine (Akhondzadeh 
et al., 2004). In addition, the less expensive petal extracts have also been tested and found to 
be effective substitutes (Akhondzadeh Basti et al., 2008; Akhondzadeh Basti et al., 2007; 
Movafegh et al., 2008). Saffron reduced anxiety and depression scores in women with 
premenstrual syndrome as well (Agha-Hosseini et al., 2008).

Kava kava (Piper methysticum) originated from tropical islands and is used in traditional 
medicine. Dietary supplements containing kava extracts are promoted as a natural treatment 
for anxiety and insomnia. WS®1490, a standardized dry root extract, has been employed in 
several clinical trials (Gastpar and Klimm, 2003; Geier and Konstantinowicz, 2004; Malsch 
and Kieser, 2001; Volz and Kieser, 1997) and shown to have anxiolytic effects that were 
superior to placebo. Another extract demonstrated effects similar to those of buspirone and 
opipramol, prescription drugs used for anxiety and depression (Boerner et al., 2003). 
Aqueous extracts of kava have also been investigated by Sarris et al. who reported their 
anxiolytic activity to be better than placebo with short-term (3 weeks) use (Sarris et al., 
2009), but not as effective as oxazepam when given in acute doses for one week (Sarris et 
al., 2012). In another study, this extract increased sexual drive in female users and reduced 
anxiety significantly (Sarris et al., 2013b). Kava extract also reduced anxiety and depression 
scores in both peri- (Cagnacci et al., 2003) and postmenopausal women (De Leo et al., 
2000).

Ginkgo biloba is an ancient plant recognized for its medicinal value throughout history, and 
is cultivated around the world. The leaf extract is marketed as a dietary supplement to 
improve memory because it promotes blood flow. Quite a few clinical trials over the last two 
decades used EGB 761®, a standardized dry leaf extract of G. biloba. In patients with 
cognitive impairment (Gavrilova et al., 2014; Scripnikov et al., 2007; Cieza et al., 2003; van

Dongen et al., 2000), this product was shown to be superior to placebo in relieving anxiety 
and depression. Similar findings were reported in patients with anxiety (Woelk et al., 2007) 
or multiple sclerosis (Johnson et al., 2006), with significant reductions in anxiety scores 
following use of EGB 761® compared to a placebo. However, results from a pilot study 
indicate that EGB 761® is no better than the prescription drug donepezil in Alzheimer’s 
patients (Yancheva et al., 2009), and another G. biloba extract (PN246) was no better than 
placebo in preventing seasonal affective depression (Lingaerde et al., 1999).

The flower of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is used in perfumes and in aromatherapy 
because its fragrance has a purported calming effect. Oral supplements from this plant are 
also available for a wide variety of symptoms. Silexan®, a product derived from steam 
distillation of lavender flowers, has been tested in several human studies that show its 
anxiolytic activity to be better than placebo (Kasper et al., 2010; Kasper et al., 2014; Kasper 
et al., 2015), and comparable to prescription drugs such as paroxetine (Kasper et al., 2014) 
and lorazepam (Woelk and Schlafke, 2010) with fewer adverse effects. Lavender tea may 
also enhance the effect of the antidepressant citalopram (Nikfarjam et al., 2013). Similar 
benefits were observed when lavender extract drops were taken with imipramine 
(Akhondzadeh et al., 2003).

Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) is a plant native to South Asia and commonly used in Ayurvedic 
medicine. Preliminary studies show that it acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 
suggesting it may benefit those with cognitive dysfunction. KeenMind®, an ethanolic extract 
derived from the stem, leaves, and root, was tested in adults in two studies. Results showed 
positive effects in improving cognitive function but not anxiety (Benson et al., 2014; 
Roodenrys et al., 2002). Studies using other extracts showed a general reduction in anxiety 
scores (Sathyanarayanan et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2011; Calabrese et al., 2008; Stough et 
al., 2001). However, all studies were conducted only in healthy subjects with placebo 
controls. Whether similar benefits could be conferred on patients with anxiety and 
depression, and how this herb compares with standard medications for anxiety or depression 
remains unclear.

Passionflower is derived from the flower of Passiflora incarnata, a plant prevalent in 
Southeastern parts of the Americas. Native Americans used it as a remedy to improve sleep 
and to reduce anxiety. One study that employed a traditional tea preparation taken before 
bedtime found that it can improve sleep quality, but had no significant effect on anxiety 
when compared to a placebo (Ngan and Conduit, 2011). An aqueous extract of 
passionflower produced a slight but statistically significant improvement in anxiety scores in 
patients undergoing spinal anesthesia without disrupting psychomotor function or sedation 
(Aslanargun et al., 2012). In another trial, a standardized P. incarnata extract was reported to 
reduce preoperative anxiety in patients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy (Movafegh et al., 
2008). When used as an adjuvant, passionflower extract improved mental symptoms more 
effectively than clonidine alone for opioid withdrawal (Akhondzadeh et al., 2001a). In 
patients with anxiety disorder, passionflower extract was no better than oxazepam in 
reducing symptoms, but had fewer adverse effects (Akhondzadeh et al., 2001b). Similar 
findings were reported in another study that compared passionflower with sertraline 
(Nojoumi et al., 2017).

Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea) is a perennial plant used in traditional medicine in Asia and in 
Eastern Europe to improve physical endurance and mental performance. Results from 
studies of the root extract involving patients with anxiety (Cropley et al., 2015) and 
depression (Darbinyan et al., 2007) show that it can reduce symptoms when compared with 
placebo. In adults with stress-related fatigue, an R. rosea extract was no better than a placebo 
in reducing depression scores (Olsson et al., 2009). A root extract was also less effective 
than the standard antidepressant drug sertraline in patients with mild to moderate depression, 
but was associated with fewer adverse events and was better tolerated (Mao et al., 2015).

Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) is an herb chiefly marketed for menopausal symptoms. 
But in a study of postmenopausal women, it was not as effective as fluoxetine in reducing 
depression, although it had a positive effect on hot flashes (Oktem et al., 2007). Another 
study in the same population showed that a standardized black cohosh extract Remifemin® 
was as effective as low-dose transdermal estradiol treatment in reducing hot flashes, anxiety, 
and depression, but without the hormonal changes exhibited with estradiol (Nappi et al., 
2005). However, one trial that employed a different black cohosh extract did not find it more 
effective than a rice flour placebo (Amsterdam et al., 2009b). Variations in methods of 
preparation and dosage may account for the lack of effects.

Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) is an herb popular for its relaxant effects. In patients with 
mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder, a chamomile extract demonstrated modest 
anxiolytic activity when compared with placebo (Amsterdam et al., 2009a). A follow-up 
study of chamomile’s long-term effects showed that it continued to be effective after 38 
weeks although there was no significant reduction in relapse time (Mao et al., 2016).

Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is an herb indigenous to South America. Its extract is marketed 
as a dietary supplement mainly for its stimulant effects, which are likely due to the high 
caffeine content. However, in healthy volunteers, guarana was ineffective in reducing 
anxiety or improving well-being and mood (Silvestrini et al., 2013). In post-chemotherapy 
breast cancer patients, guarana was better than placebo in reducing fatigue, but not anxiety 
or depression (de Oliveira Campos et al., 2011). And in breast cancer patients undergoing 
radiation therapy, there were no significant differences in either fatigue or depression when 
compared to a placebo (da Costa Miranda et al., 2009).

Asian Ginseng (Panax ginseng) found in Northeast Asia has been used as a “cure all” in 
Traditional Chinese Medicine. P. ginseng root extract reduced anxiety in patients with 
fibromyalgia, but it was not as potent as amitriptyline, an antidepressant drug (Braz et al., 
2013). In another trial of postmenopausal women, Ginsana®, a standardized P. ginseng root 
extract, reduced depression but not general well-being scores (Wiklund et al., 1999).

Chasteberry (Vitex agnus castus) is often recommended for relief from premenstrual 
symptoms. Studies show that chasteberry drops are similar to placebo in relieving depressive 
symptoms (Zamani et al., 2012). When compared to fluoxetine, chasteberry was more 
effective in reducing physical symptoms, while fluoxetine was better for relieving 
psychological symptoms (Atmaca et al., 2003).

Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is a plant indigenous to South America. It has been used to 
enhance fertility and sexual performance in both men and women, and to relieve menopausal 
symptoms. Powdered roots (Stojanovska et al., 2015) as well as the dried methanolic extract 
(Brooks et al., 2008) have been tested on postmenopausal women in two studies with a 
crossover design. These products alleviated depression and anxiety without exerting 
hormonal effects.

Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is commonly used to address premenstrual and menopausal 
symptoms because it acts as a phytoestrogen. In studies of postmenopausal women, 
standardized T. pratense capsules were reported to relieve anxiety and related symptoms 
(Lipovac et al., 2010; Hidalgo et al., 2005).

Studies of soy isoflavones (de Sousa-Munoz and Filizola, 2009), whole soy, and daidzein 
(Liu et al., 2014) failed to find any reductions in depressive symptoms.

Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is known for its calming effects, and valerian tea is often 
used to aid sleep. In patients with anxiety disorder, a valerian root extract had anxiolytic 
effects similar to diazepam (Andreatini et al., 2002). When used as a sleep-aid, its benefits 
and adverse event profile were comparable to oxazepam (Dorn, 2000).

Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) is used both as an herbal medicine and as a spice in 
alcoholic drinks. Two studies were conducted using SedaCrohn®, a standardized A. 
absinthium leaf and stem powder, on patients with Crohn’s disease. When compared to 
standard medications (Krebs et al., 2010) or a placebo (Omer et al., 2007), this product 
improved depression symptom scores.

There were a number of herbal medicines for which our criteria yielded only 1 RCT (Table 
3).

American skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora) has been compared with stinging nettle leaf 
(Urtica dioica folia) for its effects on improving mood in healthy participants (Brock et al., 
2014). No significant differences were found, but this may be due to low levels of anxiety at 
baseline.

Flax oil is derived from the seed of Linum usitatissimum. Flax oil containing alpha-linolenic 
acid (α-LNA) was reported to be similar to olive oil in reducing depressive symptoms in 
children and young adults with bipolar disorder (Gracious et al., 2010).

Garlic (Allium sativum) has been investigated in a study to determine its cholesterol-
lowering activity. Psychopathologic parameters including depression were also evaluated, 
but no changes were observed (Peleg et al., 2003).

Sage (Salvia officinalis) is generally used as a spice. Essential oil and extracts of sage are 
thought to inhibit cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine. In a study that compared different dosages of a dried leaf extract with 
placebo, a lower dose (300 mg/d) was more effective than the higher dose (600 mg/d) in 
reducing anxiety in healthy young adults (Kennedy et al., 2006).

In menopausal women, extracts of blue green algae (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) 
(Genazzani et al., 2010), Cimicifuga foetida (Zheng et al., 2013), grape seed (Vitis vinifera) 
(Terauchi et al., 2014), rhapontic rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) (Kaszkin-Bettag et al., 
2007), rose tea (Tseng et al., 2005), and wild yam (Dioscorea alata) (Hsu et al., 2011) helped 
decrease symptom scores related to anxiety and depression. Whereas wild yam appears to 
work via estrogenic pathway, the blue green algae extract did not demonstrate any hormonal 
effects.

Extracts from gotu kola (Centella asiatica) (Bradwejn et al., 2000), green tea (Camelia 
sinensis) (Zhang et al., 2013), holy basil (Ocimum sanctum) (Sampath et al., 2015), and 
Sceletium tortuosum (Terburg et al., 2013), when administered to healthy adults were more 
effective than placebo in reducing anxiety and/or depression scores.

Bitter orange blossom (Citus aurantium) (Akhlaghi et al., 2011), curcumin (Curcuma longa) 
(Yu et al., 2015), Melissa officinalis (Alijaniha et al., 2015), and Siberian ginseng 
(Eleutherococcus senticosis) (Schaffler et al., 2013) were also found to have some benefit in 
lowering anxiety and depression in clinical studies, but these symptoms were not the 
primary endpoints.

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) (Chengappa et al., 2013), black cumin (Nigella sativa) 
(Bin Sayeed et al., 2014), and Chlorella vulgaris (Panahi et al., 2015) were not effective in 
relieving anxiety and depression in patients with related symptoms.

DISCUSSION

In this review, we found that the majority were early-phase studies, with no phase III trials. 
Study designs varied considerably with subjects including menopausal women and patients 
with anxiety disorders. Some studies that used healthy volunteers with low baseline 
symptom levels may have produced misleading results. Anxiety or depressive symptoms 
were measured in all the studies, but were not always the primary endpoints. In addition, 
different scales were used to measure the severity of symptoms. We chose to include only 
RCTs to reduce bias. Most trials used placebos or standard pharmaceutical agents in the 
control group. Overall, 45% of studies reviewed indicate significant improvements in 
anxiety or depression scores. Many studies that compared the effects of herbs with standard 
pharmaceutical agents reported that herbs are not as potent, but are safer than prescription 
drugs. These include saffron (Noorbala et al., 2005; Moosavi et al., 2014; Shahmansouri et 
al., 2014; Akhondzadeh Basti et al., 2007), black cohosh (Oktem et al., 2007; Nappi et al., 
2005), and chasteberry (Atmaca et al., 2003). These herbs did not outperform fluoxetine, but 
were associated with fewer adverse events, which can include changes in appetite, sexual 
dysfunction, nausea, headache, insomnia, and tremors.

Although several studies reported herbal supplements to be safe, their potential for 
interactions with other drugs were not discussed. For example, black cohosh (Li et al., 
2011), chasteberry (Ho et al., 2011), chamomile (Ganzera et al., 2006), and rhodiola 
(Hellum et al., 2010) are known to modulate the actions of cytochrome P450 enzymes, and 
may increase the toxicity or decrease therapeutic effects of substrate drugs (Gurley et al.,

2012) including many used in cancer treatment, like cyclosporine (Sridharan and 
Sivaramakrishnan, 2016) and most of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Gay et al., 2017). Even 
though the clinical significance of these interactions is yet to be determined, the potential 
exists and therefore should be given due consideration. In addition, herbs such as chamomile 
(Segal and Pilote, 2006) and lavender (Denner, 2009) have anticoagulant/antiplatelet 
properties, and may therefore elevate the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of drugs that 
have similar actions (Ge et al., 2014). These include warfarin and heparin drugs that are 
often used to treat or prevent deep vein thrombosis in bedridden cancer patients. These herbs 
may also further increase the cardiovascular complication of antiangiogenic drugs like 
bevacizumab (Totzeck et al., 2017). In addition, the debate continues about phytoestrogenic 
herbs that include lavender (Diaz et al., 2016) and chasteberry (Dugoua et al., 2008), and 
their potential for interference with anti-hormonal therapies or for exerting pro-proliferative 
effects in patients with hormone-sensitive cancers (Fritz et al., 2013). It is prudent to 
understand these risks because cancer patients often tend to use herbal products 
concomitantly with prescription drugs. Another concern is the intrinsic toxicity associated 
with some herbs. For instance, kava is a traditional herbal remedy with proven anxiolytic 
and antidepressant properties, but has been associated with hepatotoxicity (Teschke, 2010). 
This can be detrimental for cancer patients who often have compromised liver function as a 
side effect from chemotherapy (Vincenzi et al., 2016). However, aqueous extracts were 
reported to be safe in preclinical testing (Sarris et al., 2009; Sarris et al., 2013a). Clinical 
trials are needed to determine safety in humans.

Based on these data, black cohosh, chamomile, chasteberry, lavender, passionflower, and 
saffron appear to be worthy of consideration for the treatment of depression and anxiety with 
minimal risk of serious side effects. They appear to be reasonable options for patients who 
prefer a natural approach. Future research efforts should focus on elucidating the 
mechanisms of action as well as the safety and efficacy of these herbs. Also, clinical trials 
should employ well-characterized standardized agents. Optimal dosages, potential 
interactions, and adverse effects should be determined in early phase trials, preferably in 
cancer survivors.

Other limitations of this review include significant variability among the studies included 
along with publication bias, as many trials were sponsored by the manufacturers, and 
employed proprietary products.

CONCLUSIONS

Available evidence suggests utility of some herbal medicines in mitigating anxiety and 
depression, but conclusive data to show superiority in benefit/risk ratio of these products 
over current pharmaceuticals are lacking. Due to the heterogeneity of previous trials, future 
studies should focus on using the standardized forms of these products in large-scale trials 
with robust methodology to determine their comparative effectiveness. A just-published 
review reported increased participation in studies with longitudinal design compared to 
randomized trials (Wakefield et al., 2017). Studies to elucidate mechanisms and 
pharmacokinetics are also needed. The findings can help establish reliable dosage guidelines 
and effectiveness of herbal products, which appear to have a better benefit-to-risk profile

depression and anxiety, might especially benefit from such research as conventional 
management is often not favorable.
