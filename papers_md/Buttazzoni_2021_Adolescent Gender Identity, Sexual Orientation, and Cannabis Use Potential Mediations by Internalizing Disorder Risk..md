Abstract
Background/Aims. Adolescents who identify as nonbinary gender or as not heterosexual report higher levels of mental illness 
than  their  counterparts.  Cannabis  use  is  a  commonly  employed  strategy  to  cope  with  mental  illness  symptoms  among 
adolescents; however, cannabis use can have many deleterious health consequences for youth. Within the frame of minority 
stress theory, this study investigates the relationships between gender identity and sexual orientation, internalizing disorder 
symptoms, and cannabis use among adolescents. Method. A national cross-sectional survey of a generalizable sample of high 
school students in Canada from the 2017 wave (N = 15,191) of the Cancer Risk Assessment in Youth Survey was analyzed 
in  spring  2019.  Mediation  analyses  were  completed  to  examine  risk  of  internalizing  disorder  symptoms  as  a  potential 
mediator  of  the  association  between  (1)  gender  identity  and  (2)  sexual  orientation,  and  cannabis  use.  Results.  Indirect 
effects in all models show significantly higher levels of reported internalizing disorder symptoms for female (OR = 3.44, 
95% CI [2.84, 4.18]) and nonbinary gender (OR = 3.75, 95% CI [2.16, 6.51]) compared with male students. Sexual minority 
adolescents had higher odds of internalizing disorder risk relative to non–sexual minority adolescents (OR = 3.13, 95% CI 
[2.63, 3.74]). Students who reported higher rates of internalizing disorder symptoms were more likely to have ever used 
cannabis. Patterns of partial mediation are also present among all groups.
Discussion/Conclusions. Findings can be used to better inform mental health interventions for adolescents. Future study should 
explore specific mental health stressors of vulnerable adolescent groups with respect to cannabis use as a coping mechanism.

Globally, anxiety and mood disorders are the most preva-
lent health conditions (Whiteford et al., 2015). Legal thera-
peutic  cannabis  use  is  a  common  coping  strategy  for 
affected  individuals  due  to  its  potential  to  improve  sleep 
(Walsh et al., 2017), regulate moods (Hill et al., 2009), and 
serve as an alternative to addictive opiates for pain reduc-
tion (Lucas & Walsh, 2017). However, cannabis is also the 
most widely used illicit drug in the world among both the 
general population (World Health Organization, 2010) and 
adolescents  (United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime, 
2018). Adolescent cannabis use may put youth at a greater 
risk for developing future mental health disorders (Malone 
et al., 2010; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration  &  Center  for  Behavioral  Health  Statistics 
and  Quality,  2013).  There  is  also  growing  concern  that 

exposure to cannabis during adolescence can have a variety 
of harmful effects in the maturing brain (Giedd et al., 1999; 
Gilman  et al.,  2014;  Lenroot  &  Giedd,  2006).  In  Canada, 
these  issues  are  particularly  concerning  as  the  nation  has 
the  highest  prevalence  of  adolescent  cannabis  use  in  the 
developed world (Currie et al., 2012)—almost one in four 
adolescents aged 15 to 17 years has consumed cannabis at 
least once in their lifetime (Rotermann & Langlois, 2015).

Mental Health and Cannabis

Several links between adolescent cannabis use and mental 
illness  exist.  Early  cannabis  use  has  been  associated  with 
schizophrenia  risk  (Shapiro  &  Buckley-Hunter,  2010), 
depressive symptoms (Degenhardt et al., 2003; Moore et al., 
2007), depression (Meier et al., 2016), and other mood dis-
orders  (Patton  et  al.,  2002;  Rubino  et  al.,  2012).  Frequent 
adolescent  cannabis  use  has  also  been  linked  to  increased 
risk of developing psychotic symptoms such as early onset 
psychosis (Casadio et al., 2011; Wilkinson et al., 2014) and 
paranoia  (Griffith-Lendering  et  al.,  2013).  Perhaps  most 
concerning  is  the  connection  between  adolescent  cannabis 
use and a heightened proclivity for suicidal behaviors (Cho 
et al., 2007; Hockenberry et al., 2010; Patton et al., 2002). 
Cannabis  use  during  these  important  developmental  years 
has many potential adverse consequences and can contrib-
ute to long-term issues such as deficits in individual cogni-
tive and executive functioning, including decision making, 
memory,  problem  solving,  and  sustained  attention  (Fontes 
et al., 2011; Lisdahl et al., 2014; Tapert et al., 2007).

Internalizing Disorders

Internalizing disorders are characterized by inward expres-
sions  of  distress  and  are  typically  linked  with  anxiety  and 
mood  disorders  (e.g.,  major  depressive  disorder  see 
Cosgrove et al., 2011). Anxiety  and depression are two of 
the most common disorders among young people, globally, 
with the former being estimated to affect between 4% and 
20% of children and adolescents (Martin & Volkmar, 2007) 
and the latter around 2% to 8% of children and adolescents 
(Hazell,  2009).  Moreover,  internationally,  depression  is  a 
leading  cause  of  disability  (World  Health  Organization, 
2018). These internalizing disorders can begin early on dur-
ing childhood and can negatively affect an individual’s rela-
tionships,  development,  and  daily  functioning  (Whalen 
et al., 2017). In the longer term, such disorders may lead to 
functional impairment (Rapee et al., 2009), an increased risk 
for suicide (Gould et al., 1998), and substance abuse issues 
(Compton et al., 2002). Overall, internalizing disorders pos-
sess  the  ability  to  create  high-societal  burdens  (Konnopka 
et al., 2009).

Gender and Sexuality and Cannabis Use

Notable  gender  differences  in  cannabis  use  among  adoles-
cents also exist. Adolescent boys, compared with girls, initi-
ate  cannabis  use  earlier  (Moss  et  al.,  2014;  Swahn  et  al., 
2011). They are also more likely to engage in cannabis use 
(Goncy & Mrug, 2013; Leatherdale et al., 2007; Lee-Winn 
et al., 2018), and report being subject to fewer parental con-
trols and monitoring (Laird et al., 2008; Webb et al., 2002). 
Findings are less clear with respect to cannabis use being a 
significant factor for predicting suicide planning or personal 

endorsement of suicide among boys compared with girls as 
some study suggests (Cho et al., 2007), while other literature 
has noted this trend among both groups (Swahn et al., 2011). 
While  research  on  gender  minority  (i.e.,  any  noncisgender 
identity) youths is still emerging (Austin, 2016), initial study 
has found that transgender adolescents have relatively higher 
levels  of  cannabis  use  compared  with  their  peers  (Clark 
et  al.,  2018).  Similar  trends  also  highlight  that  transgender 
youths have an increased likelihood for early onset use and 
exhibit more recent usage patterns than their nontransgender 
counterparts  (Day  et  al.,  2017).  Conversely,  though,  high-
quality relationships, connectedness to parents, development 
opportunities (Gower et al., 2018), and living in areas with 
more  community  support  (e.g.,  community  events,  youth 
organizations  providing  specific  services;  Eisenberg  et  al., 
2020) have all been linked to reduced odds of substance use 
among transgender and gender diverse youth. Noting these 
developments,  recent  studies  have  called  for  more  inquiry 
into  examining  the  role  and  influence  of  different  gender 
identities in cannabis use in future analyses (Bassir Nia et al., 
2018; Sherman et al., 2016).

In addition to gender differences, differences in adoles-
cent  cannabis  use  by  sexual  orientation  have  also  been 
observed: adolescents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) are at higher risk for 
substance use and disorders when compared with their het-
erosexual counterparts (Corliss et al., 2010; Watson et al., 
2018).  An  emerging  body  of  literature  has  specifically 
noted this relationship between LGBTQ status and adoles-
cent cannabis use (Hatzenbuehler, Jun, et al., 2015; Marshal 
et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2014). Among the adolescent 
LGBTQ  population,  bisexual  girls  have  been  singled  out 
for  being  at  a  particularly  high  risk  for  drug  use  (Caputi, 
2018). Taken together, cannabis use (Whiteford et al., 2013) 
and minority status stressors (Saewyc, 2011) can place sub-
stantial burden on adolescents’ quality of life. To date, there 
is  a  paucity  of  research  examining  relationships  among 
adolescents who identify as nonbinary gender or as LGBTQ 
and substance use (Mereish, 2018).

Theoretical Framework

Minority  stress  theory  offers  an  instructive  framework  for 
examining  the  pathways  by  which  external  stressors  in 
response  to  an  individual’s  minority  identity,  in  this  case 
sexual and gender minority status, can affect their well-being 
and health. Broadly, the theory postulates that environmental 
or external events (e.g., emotional violence, discrimination), 
expectation  of  stress  (e.g.,  anticipation  of  bullying,  contin-
ued vigilance about an event), and internalization processes 
(i.e., the internalization of negative attitudes and prejudices 
about one’s identity) that occur in response to one’s minority 
status  are  central  drivers  of  maladies  (Hendricks  &  Testa 
2012;  Meyer,  2003).  In  addition  to  the  impacts  on  overall 
health, these different pathways and processes can ultimately 

84 

Health Education & Behavior 48(1) 

reduce  an  individual’s  resiliency;  however,  resilience  may 
also be built in response to these experiences via coping strat-
egies or membership within supportive groups (Hendricks & 
Testa,  2012;  Meyer,  2003).  Investigating  the  role  of  mental 
health in the gender and sexual minority youth and canna-
bis  use  relationship  within  this  framework  provides  the 
opportunity  to  explore  a  serious  public  health  concern 
from  a  theoretically  informed,  multilevel,  and  multipath-
way perspective.

Research Objectives and Questions

Understanding  disparities  among  youth  cannabis  use  can 
facilitate development of effective, targeted policies and pro-
grams to reduce cannabis use and associated mental health 
impacts  among  vulnerable  populations  (Thompson  et  al., 
2018). In fact, a recent review noted the need for more larger 
scale evaluations of substance use among sexual and gender 
minority youths to better understand ways to support these 
at-risk groups (Kidd et al., 2018). A more in-depth investiga-
tion of the potential relationships between adolescent mental 
health, gender, and sexual minority status and cannabis use is 
therefore justified. To explore these connections within the 
frame of minority stress theory, this study posed the follow-
ing research questions:

To what extent does poor mental health mediate the asso-
ciation between gender and cannabis use?
To what extent does poor mental health mediate the asso-
ciation between sexual orientation and cannabis use?

Method

Data from the 2017 wave of the Cancer Risk Assessment in 
Youth Survey (CRAYS) were used for this study. CRAYS is 
a national level, classroom-based, cancer risk behavior sur-
vey  of  a  generalizable  sample  of  adolescents  from  seven 
provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Nova 
Scotia,  Ontario,  Quebec,  and  Saskatchewan)  throughout 
Canada. The primary focus of the survey is to explore under-
lying factors (e.g., bullying, mental health, and school con-
nectedness) and risky behaviors (e.g., tobacco and drug use, 
ultraviolet exposure, and poor dietary intake) likely to influ-
ence the development of cancer. Distribution and collection 
of  the  surveys  was  completed  during  class  time  and  took 
approximately  35  minutes  for  students  to  complete.  The 
quality of data was ensured through multiple measures, most 
notably:  (1)  CRAYS  protocols  were  based  on  previously 
validated strategies documented in other studies of school-
based data collection regarding youth smoking, in particular 
the  2002 Youth  Smoking  Survey  (Government  of  Canada, 
2007), (2) teachers and participating students were provided 
detailed  instructions  throughout  the  survey  process  to  pro-
mote consistency in survey completion, and, (c) verification 
of processing logic was conducted through multiple coding 

and  editing  quality  checks.  All  completed  questionnaires 
were returned to and collated at the University of Waterloo 
and subsequently machine-scanned using optical mark rec-
ognition technology. Approval for all procedures and proto-
cols  contained  in  this  study  were  granted  by  the  Office  of 
Research Ethics at the University of Waterloo and the partici-
pating school boards’ ethics review committees.

Study Sample

Schools and their corresponding school boards that partici-
pated  in  CRAYS  were  recruited  via  emails  and  follow-up 
calls. To generate a simple random sample, the selection of 
schools  was  completed  by  utilizing  the  Propel  School 
Database  of  schools  located  in  each  province.  The  2017 
wave of CRAYS consisted of 15,191 respondents in our tar-
get population of high school students who were attending 
private, public, and Catholic secondary schools. Given that 
the  average  age  of  cannabis  use  initiation  in  Canada  is  14 
years  old  (Health  Canada,  2018),  the  sample  of  this  study 
reflected  an  appropriate  population  as  participants  ranged 
from Grades 9 to 12, or roughly 13 to 18 years old. Descriptive 
statistics of the sample population are presented in Table 1.

Measures

Dependent  Variable.  Ever  use  of  cannabis  by  participants 
was  collected  through  asking  students  if  they  had  “ever 
tried marijuana (a joint, pot, weed, hash, or oil).” Partici-
pants’ response options to the question were dichotomously 
coded (yes [1]; no [0]).

Independent Variables.  Personal demographic data were gath-
ered  through  questions  asking  students  to  self-report  their 
gender identity, sexual orientation, and grade. Gender iden-
tity response options included female, male, and nonbinary 
(e.g.,  trans,  intersex,  genderqueer,  gender  neutral,  gender 
fluid,  two-spirited).  Sexual  orientation  response  options 
included: 100% heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual 
(attracted  to  both  males  and  females),  mostly  homosexual, 
100% homosexual, and not sure. Grade responses included 
Grades 9 to 12 (i.e., secondary school in Canada).

Mediator.  Internalizing disorder symptoms were assessed by 
aggregating the responses to four mental health questions: (1) 
“When was the last time you had significant problems with 
feeling very trapped, lonely, sad, blue, depressed, or hopeless 
about the future”; (2) “When was the last time you had sig-
nificant problems with feeling very anxious, nervous, tense, 
scared,  panicked,  or  like  something  bad  was  going  to  hap-
pen”; (3) “When was the last time you had significant prob-
lems  with  sleep  trouble,  such  as  bad  dreams,  sleeping 
restlessly, or falling asleep during the day”; and (4) “When 
was the last time you had significant problems with becoming 
very distressed and upset when something reminded you of

the past?” The variable used in this analysis was modified 
from  the  GAIN-SS  (Global  Appraisal  of  Individual  Needs 
Short  Screener)  measure  (Dennis  et  al.,  2016),  which  mea-
sures internalizing problems across four distinct time periods: 

past month, 2 to 12 months, more than a year ago, and never. 
In this study, responses to the four questions were rated on an 
aggregate scale of 0 to 4 based on the number of symptoms 
(i.e., a yes answer to any of the above questions) endorsed by 
an individual. The original GAIN-SS measure was modified 
by (1) adding an “I don’t know” response option to be consis-
tent with the rest of the survey and because survey pilot test-
ing with youth indicated that they preferred this option and 
(2) omitting the question related to suicide ideation. The sui-
cide ideation item was removed because the large-scale, mail-
out  nature  of  the  survey  prohibited  the  research  team  from 
attending each classroom and intervening with mental health 
supports in the case of a student having a negative response to 
that particular question. Participants were subsequently orga-
nized into three severity levels: no/low risk (0–1 symptoms), 
moderate  risk  (2–3  symptoms),  or  high  risk  (4  symptoms). 
These  category  outlines  were  based  on  previous  studies, 
which  demonstrated  their  predictive  validity  (Dennis  et  al., 
2006; Garner et al., 2013).

Statistical Analysis

To examine the potential role of mental health in explaining 
any statistically significant associations between gender and 
sexual  identities  and  cannabis  use  while  controlling  for 
grade, internalizing disorder symptoms was tested as a medi-
ator in three separate models using the procedure outlined by 
Baron  and  Kenny  (1986).  Analysis  was  conducted  in  the 
spring of 2019 using SAS 9.4 software, and testing was com-
pleted using PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC to model pathways 
a, c, and c′ and b. In order to test for mediation, four steps 
were followed for each model. First, path c was explored by 
separately regressing the dependent variable (cannabis use) 
on the independent variables (gender identity; sexual orien-
tation). In the Barron and Kenny procedure, it is suggested 
that path c be statistically significant to continue; however, 
others (Shrout & Bolger, 2002) have argued this is not neces-
sary if there is a strong a priori belief or background about 
the nature of the relationship. Next, to explore indirect effects 
in each of the models, the independent variables (path a) and 
dependant  variable  (path  b)  were  tested  with  the  mediator. 
Finally, the mediator was included in a model with the prior 
relationships (path c′) to determine if mediation had occurred.
The Sobel test and bootstrapping process macro outlined 
by Hayes (2017) was not possible due to the outcome vari-
able  being  dichotomous. Additionally,  the  process  and  the 
mediation macros by Valeri and VanderWeele (2013) could 
not be used as it would not produce reliable results due its 
inability to incorporate the design information of the CRAYS 
survey  (i.e.,  sample  weight,  stratified  cluster  sampling 
design,  whereas  most  tests  assume  a  random  sampling 
design). Survey weights were used in order to achieve esti-
mates  generalizable  to  the  population  of  each  province. A 
description  of  the  method  used  to  calculate  the  weights  is 
detailed  in  the  microdata  user  guide  (Rynard  et  al.,  2018). 
Missing data patterns were assessed: Ever use of cannabis was

was missing for 5.10% (n = 775), and 26.32% (n = 3,999) 
was missing for internalizing symptoms. Regarding the lat-
ter,  this  was  largely  due  to  how  the  internalizing  symptom 
scale was created as values for “I don’t know” were recoded 
as missing, and that four separate questions were combined. 
If any of the four questions were missing a value, they were 
not included in the internalizing symptom scale.

Results

The potentially mediating role of mental health in the asso-
ciations between gender and sexual identities and cannabis 
use are shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3. Two important over-
arching trends are present in the indirect effects (paths

CI  [2.84,  4.18]),  nonbinary  (OR  =  3.75,  95%  CI  [2.16, 
6.51]),  and  sexual  minority  (OR  =  3.13,  95%  CI  [2.63, 

3.74])  adolescents  all  report  much  higher  likelihoods  of 
internalizing  disorder  symptoms  than  their  counterparts. 
Second, there is a strong relationship between higher likeli-
hood of using cannabis and high and moderate risk of inter-
nalizing  disorder  symptoms  (mental  health  stress,  high 
OR  =  2.50,  95%  CI  [2.02,  3.09];  moderate  OR  =  1.33, 
95% CI [1.09, 1.63]).

Total effects (path c) observed in each of the models var-
ied,  however,  together  with  the  subsequent  direct  effects 
(path c′) the findings show a consistent pattern of internaliz-
ing  disorder  symptoms  mediating  cannabis  use  across  the 
three  groups.  Regarding  gender,  the  total  effect  of  gender 
identity on cannabis use was significant for nonbinary (OR 
= 2.26, 95% CI [1.56, 3.27]) but not females (OR = 0.98, 
95% CI [0.81, 1.18]), whereas with respect to sexual orienta-
tion, the total effect on cannabis use was marginally signifi-
cant  (OR  =  1.17,  95%  CI  [0.99,  1.34]).  When  adding 
internalizing  disorder  symptoms  to  the  model,  the  direct

effect of gender identity on ever using cannabis is significant 
and  somewhat  reduced  for  those  identifying  as  nonbinary 
(OR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.04, 2.39]) and somewhat reduced for 
females (OR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.64, 1.01]), albeit marginally 
significant.  Similarly,  compared  with  the  total  effect,  the 
direct effect of sexual orientation on cannabis use is some-
what  reduced  (OR  =  1.05,  95%  CI  [0.90,  1.23])  with  the 
addition  of  internalizing  disorder  symptoms  to  the  model, 
however, not at a statistically significant level.

Discussion

This  study  used  a  large,  generalizable  sample  of  Canadian 
high  school  students  from  seven  provinces  to  examine  the 
extent to which risk of internalizing disorders mediated the 
association between cannabis use and (1) gender identity and 
(2) sexual orientation. Better understanding of the relation-
ship between adolescents’ mental health and cannabis use is 
important  given  the  drug’s  potential  negative  impacts  on 
future  growth  (Lisdahl  et  al.,  2014)  and  overall  health 
(Griffith-Lendering  et  al.,  2013).  These  consequences  are 
especially  important  for  teens  who  identify  as  a  gender 
(Clark et al., 2018) or sexual (Caputi, 2018) minority, as such 
groups have disproportionately higher rates of cannabis use. 
Below, three key findings as interpreted within the theoreti-
cal frame of minority stress theory, implications for practice, 
strengths and limitations of the current study, and future ave-
nues for study are discussed.

First, students identifying as females, nonbinary gender 
identity  (i.e.,  any  noncisgender  identity),  and  not  hetero-
sexual all report significantly higher risk of internalizing 
disorders relative to their counterparts. Poor mental health 
accounts  for  a  significant  proportion  of  disease  burden 
among adolescents and is strongly correlated with a myriad 
issues,  including  violence,  substance  use,  and  poor  future 
educational  attainment  (Patel  et  al.,  2007).  Cannabis  use 
during  adolescence  can  potentially  worsen  these  mental 
health outcomes, since associations exist between cannabis 
use and individual cognitive and executive functioning defi-
cits (Fontes et al., 2011; Lisdahl et al., 2014; Tapert et al., 
2007),  schizophrenia  risk  (Shapiro  &  Buckley-Hunter, 
2010), depression (Meier et al., 2016), and the development 
of other mood disorders (Patton et al., 2002; Rubino et al., 
2012). Our finding that nonbinary gender identity and sex-
ual minority adolescents report significantly higher risks of 
internalizing disorders, when examined alongside the tenets 
of minority stress theory, could be indicative of cannabis use 
among  these  particular  groups  partly  being  the  result  of 
higher rates of engagement in harmful internalization pro-
cesses of negative attitudes and prejudices stemming from 
lived experiences or expected stressful events. If left unad-
dressed,  this  phenomenon  may  ingrain  self-stigmatization, 
which  is  associated  with  diminished  self-esteem  and  self-
efficacy (Link et al., 2001), and ultimately reduce individual 
resilience and potentially contribute to the development of 

future comorbidities (e.g., depression and substance abuse 
issues).  This  may  be  particularly  concerning  for  specific 
groups of cannabis using minority youth (i.e., regular, prob-
lematic users) relative to  others (i.e.,  experimenters, occa-
sional users).

Second, there appears to be a dose-response relationship 
between risk of internalizing disorder symptoms and odds of 
cannabis use. This is similar to other research findings that 
observe continued cannabis use in adolescence is associated 
with increasing depressive symptoms (Horwood et al., 2012) 
and  risk  of  anxiety  disorder  (Degenhardt  et  al.,  2013). 
Moreover, use during these formative years has been tied to 
increased rates of subsequent illicit drug use and use disor-
ders (Lynskey et al., 2012), as well as suicidal ideation and 
personality disorders (Copeland et al., 2013). Within the con-
text  of  minority  stress  theory,  this  potential  dose-response 
relationship  might  reflect  the  increased  levels  of  expected 
stress that youth of minority identities are known to experi-
ence  given  their  reporting  higher  rates  of  emotional  and 
physical violence (Goldenberg et al., 2018), depression (Day 
et al., 2017), suicidal ideation (Olson et al., 2015), and per-
ceived lack of safety (Kosciw et al., 2016) acting concomi-
tantly  with  lowered  levels  of  resilience  producing  an 
increased engagement in a risky coping behavior (i.e., can-
nabis use). Such patterns should be studied in greater depth 
across more robust cannabis using profiles (e.g., occasional 
vs.  problematic  user),  but  generally  these  findings  would 
support the need for health care providers and practitioners 
to help support and develop resilience for these vulnerable 
youth  groups;  suggestions  for  which  we  offer  later  in  the 
discussion.

Third,  in  most  countries,  cannabis  is  the  most  widely 
used drug among young people (United Nations Office on 
Drugs  and  Crime,  2018). Although  a  number  of  different 
factors  contribute  to  this  phenomenon  and  affect  different 
groups to varying degrees, gender (Clark et al., 2018) and 
sexual  (Corliss  et  al.,  2010; Watson  et  al.,  2018)  minority 
identity adolescents have been observed to use substances at 
higher rates than other groups of adolescents. While we dis-
cussed  earlier  the  potential  of  cannabis  use  deriving  from 
engagement in harmful internalizing processes, our findings 
could  also  suggest  that  internalizing  disorder  symptoms 
may  be  an  aggregated  or  latent  explanatory  factor  in  this 
relationship.  Specifically,  from  the  lens  of  minority  stress 
theory, these results may be emblematic of multiple poten-
tial  community-  or  societal-level  stressors  such  as  nonbi-
nary  youths  having  to  live  within  unsupportive  family 
environments (Gridley et al., 2016), as well as pediatricians 
not being adequately trained in gender-affirming health care 
(Shumer & Spack, 2013; Vance et al., 2015), driving minor-
ity  youth’s  cannabis  use.  Such  pathways  are  not  unprece-
dented as extant research has reported transgender youth are 
more  likely  to  experience  discrimination  resulting  in  eco-
nomic  marginalization  leaving  them  at  a  greater  risk  for 
drug abuse (Wilson et al., 2009).

Implications for Future Study: Practitioners

Having deliberated on the potential role of cannabis use in 
the  development  of  future  comorbidities,  the  prospective 
relationship between increased risk of internalizing disorders 
and  higher  likelihood  of  cannabis  use,  and  the  larger  scale 
stressors  potentially  affecting  sexual  and  gender  minority 
youths, it is instructive to delineate a few important consid-
erations for practitioners. Motivational enhancement therapy 
and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs targeting 
youth  with  cannabis-related  disorders  have  been  employed 
with success and have led to reductions in both substance use 
frequency  and  substance  use  problems  (Ramchand  et  al., 
2011).  CBT  methods  for  substance  abuse  that  implement 
motivational  interviewing  to  address  behavioral  change, 
contingency  management  (i.e.,  nondrug  reinforcements  for 
demonstrated substance abstinence), and skills training (e.g., 
emotional regulations) strategies (McHugh et al., 2010) may 
be  constructive  approaches  for  practitioners  to  intervene 
against the development of future comorbidities or problem 
usage behavior, to identify some of the key social stressors 
influencing a patient, or help build individual resiliency.

However, such interventions should not be undertaken in 
isolation  for  reasons  of  access  and  scale.  Study  has  shown 
that there are important environmental factors such as paren-
tal attitudes, which can vary from shock, sadness, and anger 
in response to their child’s minority identity (Malpas, 2011), 
and bullying and harassment (Kosciw et al., 2016) that can 
contribute to mental illness meaning larger scale initiatives 
are  thus  also  needed.  Initiatives  such  as  promoting  school 
nurses as advocates for improving parental education (Gower 
et al., 2018), gender-affirming interventions to enhance fam-
ily support (Simons et al., 2013), and school policies, which 
address bullying based on youth’s perceived or actual sexual 
orientation and gender (Hatzenbuehler, Schwab-Reese, et al., 
2015),  may  be  community-  and  policy-level  solutions  for 
health care practitioners to pursue in furtherance of combat-
ing community- and society-level stressors affecting vulner-
able youth.

Limitations

There are a few limitations to note with our study. First, the 
cross-sectional  nature  of  the  data  precludes  this  study  from 
making causal claims. Second, identities such as sexual orien-
tation have been connected to differences in social connected-
ness,  which  can  have  far-reaching  health  consequences  for 
adolescents (Seil et al., 2014). Questions and measures relat-
ing to social connectedness were not collected for this sam-
ple,  and  thus,  could  not  be  tested  as  potential  mediators. 
The measure used to identify cannabis users in this study is 
also  fairly  crude.  In  only  assessing  a  dichotomy  of  “ever 
users” versus “never users,” a significant variation of dif-
ferent user profiles such as experimenters, occasional, reg-
ular, and problematic users is not accounted for or analyzed 

in this study. Last, as a Canadian sample, interpretations of 
this  study’s  findings  should  proceed  with  some  caution 
when  being  applied  to  other  jurisdictions  given  Canada’s 
changing national context, specifically the potential effects 
of the recent legalization of recreational cannabis (Government 
of  Canada,  2018),  and  the  comparatively  high-perceived 
social  acceptability  (Hathaway  et  al.,  2011;  Tahirali  2016) 
that were present during data collection. While pertinent limi-
tations for this study have been discussed, the main goal of 
this study was to explore the mediating effect of internalizing 
disorder symptoms on the relationships between cannabis use 
and gender and sexual identities. Moreover, the combination 
of statistically significant results and across group mediation 
patterns  in  a  nationally  representative  and  diverse  sample 
suggests some generalizability of findings, at least within the 
Canadian context.

Conclusion and Future Areas of Study

In this large, cross-sectional study, adolescents who identified 
as female, nonbinary, or as a sexual minority all had higher 
odds of reporting risk of internalizing disorder. Students who 
were at high or moderate risk for internalizing disorders had 
significantly higher odds of using cannabis. And finally, risk 
of internalizing disorders appeared to mediate the relationship 
between these different gender and sexual identities and can-
nabis  use,  although  to  varying  degrees  among  the  different 
groups.  Having  observed  these  findings,  future  research 
should qualitatively explore specific mental health stressors 
of  gender  and  sexual  minority  adolescents  with  respect  to 
cannabis use, and quantitatively compare the perceptions of 
high risk groups regarding the role of cannabis use as a cop-
ing mechanism. Additionally, given our theoretical interpreta-
tions from minority stress theory regarding the different stress 
pathways that may potentially explain minority adolescents’ 
internalization processes and subsequent links to the use of 
cannabis, future study should seek to examine specific soci-
etal- and community-level mental health stressors potentially 
triggering cannabis use in these minority populations, as well 
as  across  different  user  profiles  (e.g.,  experimenters,  occa-
sional  users,  regular,  problematic).  In  support  of  substance 
abuse prevention, studies may consider more specific investi-
gation into isolating and identifying moderating factors in the 
relationship between cannabis use and various comorbidities 
among gender and sexual minority youths. Finally, practice-
oriented  inquiry  regarding  most  effectual  CBT  and  motiva-
tional  enhancement  therapy  strategies  for  reducing  cannabis 
use or preventing early onset use specifically with respect to 
gender and sexual minority youths is also warranted.
