Abstract
Police officers carry a high risk of exposure to traumatic events in their everyday work duties and are at an increased risk 
for work-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Practitioners lack clear guidance on how to support these individu-
als to facilitate both mental health recovery and return to work, particularly for those receiving treatment in the context of 
a claim with a workers’ compensation board. The following case study describes the treatment of a female police officer 
who  had  experienced  numerous  traumatic  events  over  the  course  of  her  career,  and  subsequently  filed  a  claim  with  the 
workers’  compensation  board  of  British  Columbia.  She  was  referred  to  an  interdisciplinary  program  that  involved  both 
psychology and occupational therapy interventions, including a trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy intervention 
followed by a gradual return to work. The outcome suggests that intensive, interdisciplinary trauma-focused treatment is 
a promising approach for supporting police officers with their recovery and return to work.

Introduction

Workplace  trauma  as  a  risk  for  both  primary  and  second-
ary traumatization has increasingly been acknowledged by 
workers’ compensation boards, scientists, and in the diag-
nostic  criteria  for  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD). 
Police officers carry a particularly high risk of exposure to 
traumatic events, and a meta-analysis estimated that 14.2% 
of  police  personnel  worldwide  have  PTSD  (Syed  et  al., 
2020). A number of empirically supported interventions are 
now  available  to  treat  individuals  with  PTSD.  Numerous 
clinical  practice  guidelines  make  strong  recommendations 
for trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapies (Hamblen 
et  al.,  2019).  This  term  refers  to  treatment  protocols  that 
involve processing the trauma memory to resolve trauma-
related feelings, make meaning of the experience, and inte-
grate  corrective  information.  Some  protocols  also  include 
in  vivo  exposure  which  involves  confronting  feared  and

avoided situations without escaping or using safety behav-
iours  (Blakey  & Abramowitz,  2019).  Meta  analyses  have 
demonstrated that trauma-focused cognitive behaviour ther-
apies achieve medium to large effect sizes for PTSD symp-
tom  reduction  and  loss  of  diagnosis  (e.g.,  Morina  et  al., 
2021). A randomized controlled study among first respond-
ers found that trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy 
resulted in large reductions of PTSD severity, and 56–59% 
of participants no longer met criteria for PTSD at the 2-year 
follow up (Bryant et al., 2021).

If a claim of work-related PTSD was accepted by a work-
ers’ compensation board, the individual is entitled to receiv-
ing  treatment  for  their  PTSD.  Typically,  expectations  are 
related to both symptom reduction and resumption of work. 
However,  research  reporting  return-to-work  outcomes  of 
interventions  for  individuals  with  work-related  PTSD  has 
remained  scant  (Torchalla  &  Strehlau,  2018).  In  addition, 
despite  the  strong  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  expo-
sure-based  psychotherapies,  they  remain  underutilized  by 
community-based  clinicians  (Pittig  et  al.,  2019).  Barriers 
include  clinicians’  beliefs  that  exposure  might  exacerbate 
symptoms and lead to treatment non-compliance and drop-
out or a disruption of the therapeutic relationship (Michael 
et al., 2021), or that it does not work for complex cases and

individuals with cumulative trauma or trauma-related feel-
ings other than fear (Cook et al., 2018).

Information  regarding  the  treatment  of  PTSD  in  police 
officers is important because they often present with a num-
ber of these perceived challenges. For example, cumulative 
traumatic experiences are common in this profession (Car-
leton et al., 2019). Furthermore, police officers are trained 
to remain calm in stressful situations and  to  supress  emo-
tional  responses  at  the  time  of  an  event.  This  emotional 
detachment  is  valuable  for  their  functioning  at  work,  but 
may result in them being unwilling or unable to access and 
describe their emotions even when they are off duty (Lennie 
et  al.,  2020).  Many  first  responders  also  struggle  with  the 
impact of morally challenging experiences that might trig-
ger emotions beyond fear-based distress. For example, they 
frequently  report  a  sense  of  failure  to  protect  members  of 
the public, and their moral outlook might be shattered by the 
repeated witnessing of cruel acts by others (Bryant, 2021).

In  summary,  although  effective  interventions  for  PTSD 
exist,  many  aspects  of  work-related  PTSD  have  not  been 
adequately researched or translated into practice, and practi-
tioners lack clear guidance on how to support these individu-
als to facilitate both recovery and return to work, particularly 
workers  with  highly  stressful  jobs  and  complex  presenta-
tions such as police officers, and those receiving treatment 
in the context of a workers’ compensation board claim. It has 
been suggested that clients who struggle to return to work 
after workplace trauma might benefit from interdisciplinary 
treatment that includes counselling for trauma processing as 
well as occupational therapy to support graded work-related 
exposures  (Torchalla  et  al.,  2019).  The  following  report 
describes the treatment of a police officer who participated 
in a psychotherapy program and subsequent gradual return 
to work as part of her claim with WorkSafeBC, the workers’ 
compensation board of British Columbia. The report aims to 
demonstrate  how  interdisciplinary  trauma-focused  therapy 
can facilitate PTSD recovery and return to work after police 
work-related trauma, and to highlight specific components 
that may be helpful for treating police officers or other first 
responders with work-related PTSD.

Referral Process

WorkSafeBC  accepts  claims  for  mental  disorders  that 
arise from traumatic work events. First, the worker will be 
referred  to  a  diagnostic  assessment,  to  determine  if  they 
have a mental disorder which was predominantly caused by 
work-related  factors.  If  a  claim  is  accepted,  benefits  such 
as  wage-loss  compensation  and  health  care  treatment  will 
be provided, including referral to specialized trauma recov-
ery programs. WorkSafeBC has contracted multiple clinics 

1 3

across the province to deliver these services, including the 
current  clinic.  In  this  program,  each  client  works  with  a 
team consisting of a psychologist and an occupational thera-
pist, who collaborate closely in delivering trauma-focused, 
exposure-based  psychotherapy  and  return-to-work  sup-
port. If a worker does not reside within driving distance to 
the  clinic, WorkSafeBC  will  cover  the  costs  of  travel  and 
accommodation  to  facilitate  participation  in  the  program. 
During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  clients  participated  in 
telehealth  sessions  if  this  mode  was  considered  clinically 
appropriate.  Potential  clients  first  participate  in  an  intake 
assessment with one of the team psychologists to determine 
their eligibility for the program. The treatment program is 
8 to 12 weeks long (the exact duration depends on the cli-
ent’s progress). If the client progresses well and feels ready 
to attempt a return to work to their pre-injury position, they 
participate in a 4-8-week gradual return to work plan which 
is monitored by the team. If the client is not able to return to 
their pre-injury position, they will be discharged with rec-
ommendations  for  restrictions  and/or  limitations  to  move 
forward with vocational rehabilitation or further treatment.

Case Introduction

Client Background and History

Susan  (pseudonym),  a  Canadian  female  in  her  fifties,  was 
referred to the clinic after being diagnosed with PTSD as a 
result of her work duties. She reported a happy childhood 
without abuse or neglect. She is married and has two adult 
children. She had been working as a police officer in vari-
ous units for over 20 years. Her claim was accepted based 
on specific recent incidents, but she reported having experi-
enced and witnessed many traumatic events over the course 
of her career, such as exposure to victims of homicide, sui-
cide,  abuse,  assaults,  and  accidents;  her  life  being  threat-
ened; and dealing with aggressive and violent individuals. 
She was involved in a shooting early in her career. She sub-
sequently  struggled  emotionally  though  did  not  make  the 
connection  to  the  work  event.  Eventually  she  sought  help 
from  a  psychologist  who  diagnosed  her  with  PTSD.  Her 
mental  health  improved  following  psychoeducation  and 
discussing  anxiety  management  techniques.  Subsequently, 
to cope with work-related stressors, she would take her holi-
days or take a day off if needed, so that she could “get back 
on her feet” and continue working. She also attended critical 
incident  debriefs  at  work  and  sought  additional  assistance 
from  her  physician  and  her  psychologist.  Psychotherapy 
involved supportive counselling and discussion of personal 
stressors  (e.g.,  parenting  concerns,  interpersonal  relation-
ships).  She  signed  off  work  during  a  wire  tap  operation, 

Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy (2022) 52:319–327where  she  overheard  domestic  violence  occurring  and  lis-
tened to individuals making suicide plans. She filed a claim 
with  WorkSafeBC  and  started  seeing  a  psychologist.  She 
found this helpful but noted “I needed deeper help.” Hence, 
she was referred to the trauma recovery program. Treatment 
was delivered by a Doctoral level psychologist and a Mas-
ter’s level occupational therapist.

Intake Interview

At the time of her intake interview, Susan had been off work 
for  seven  months.  She  had  requested  an  in-person  assess-
ment  because  she  felt  this  would  facilitate  building  trust. 
She  appeared  tense  for  most  of  the  session.  She  provided 
extensive information about stressful work events and had 
at  times  difficulty  containing  her  memories.  She  reported 
experiencing  intrusive  auditory  memories  associated  with 
the wire tap operation, visual memories related to her work 
with a victim of domestic violence, and brief visual “flashes” 
of other seemingly random calls. She often woke up at night 
with her heart pounding and sweaty palms, and lay awake 
thinking  about  work.  She  was  feeling  sad,  anxious  and 
guilty, and often found herself ruminating about events for 
which she blamed herself (e.g., not having done enough to 
prevent  deaths).  She  tried  to  push  her  memories  and  feel-
ings away because they seemed overwhelming and she did 
not know what to do with them. She avoided listening to the 
news, getting into arguments with others, watching certain 
TV  series  and  going  to  places  that  reminded  her  of  calls. 
She endorsed increased irritability, being impatient with her 
family, and being tense around people. She reported feeling 
constantly on guard and on the edge, feeling easily startled, 
crying  more  than  usual,  and  having  difficulty  concentrat-
ing.  She  had  developed  hives  and  headaches  in  response 
to stress, was grinding her teeth and was wearing a mouth-
guard at night because of this. She had stopped participating 
in sports activities, and she used to be an outgoing person 
but now she preferred to be alone. She denied having ever 
had any suicidal ideation. She reported occasional alcohol 
use but no tobacco or recreational drugs use. At the time of 
the  intake,  Susan  stated  that  she  would  like  to  retire  from 
policing upon treatment completion.

Psychometric Assessment

PTSD and depressive symptoms were measured at intake, 
every four weeks during treatment, at the end of the gradual 
return to work, and at the 9-month follow-up. PTSD symp-
toms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 
(PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013), which measures symptom 
severity on 20 items using a 5-point scale, resulting in a score 
between 0 and 80. A cut-score of 31–33 points is indicative 

321

of a probable PTSD diagnosis. Depressive symptoms were 
assessed  using  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9; 
Kroenke & Spitzer 2002), which measures the severity of 
depression on 9 items using a 4-point scale. The total score 
can  range  from  0  to  27,  reflecting  none-minimal  (0–4), 
mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), moderately-severe (15–19), 
and severe (20–27) depression. A cut-score of > 9 has been 
recommended  for  detecting  clinically  significant  depres-
sion.  The  Inventory  of  Psychosocial  Functioning  (IPF; 
Bovin et al., 2018) was administered at intake, the end of 
the gradual return to work, and the 9-month follow-up. The 
IPF is an 80-item measure to assess difficulties in function-
ing in seven life domains using a 7-point scale. Clients skip 
domains that do not apply. The responses yield an index of 
functioning between 0 and 100 for each domain, reflecting 
no (0–10), mild (11–30), moderate (31–50), severe (51–80), 
and extreme (81–100) impairment.

Treatment Planning

A  shared  decision-making  approach  is  recommended  for 
PTSD treatment where clients and clinicians review treat-
ment options together to determine which intervention best 
meets  the  client’s  needs  and  preferences  (Hamblen  et  al., 
2019).  Susan  received  information  about  prolonged  expo-
sure (Foa et al., 2019), cognitive processing therapy (Resick 
et  al.,  2016),  and  cognitive  therapy  for  PTSD  (CT-PTSD; 
Ehlers  et  al.,  2005).  She  chose  CT-PTSD. The  underlying 
model  suggests  that  PTSD  develops  when  a  person  inter-
prets a traumatic event in a way that produces an ongoing 
external  (e.g.,  “The  world  is  dangerous”)  and/or  internal 
(e.g.,  “I’ve  let  myself  down”)  sense  of  threat.  The  sense 
of  threat  is  maintained  by  three  processes:  First,  the  per-
son  has  developed  excessive  negative  appraisals  of  them-
selves  and  others.  Second,  because  the  trauma  memory  is 
disjointed and poorly elaborated due to avoidance, the per-
son is unable to access information that could correct their 
negative  appraisals  and  make  sense  of  their  experiences. 
Third, the individual uses cognitive and behavioural strate-
gies that reduce their sense of threat (e.g., memory suppres-
sion, rumination, safety behaviours, avoidance) but prevent 
reappraisal  of  the  events.  CT-PTSD  aims  to  elaborate  and 
update the trauma memory, modify negative appraisals and 
make meaning of the event, and reduce unhelpful strategies. 
Core  interventions  are  psychoeducation,  an  individualized 
case formulation, reclaiming your life assignments, trauma 
processing, trigger discrimination and exposure to triggers.
Susan’s  treatment  consisted  of  12  weeks  of  CT-PTSD 
involving an initial joint session with the team, followed by 
two occupational therapy sessions and two psychology ses-
sions  per  week.  Most  sessions  were  completed  via  secure

videoconferencing platform due to the recent Covid-19 out-
break, but the first two trauma processing sessions with the 
psychologist and several exposure sessions with the occu-
pational therapist were held in person. Working together as 
a  team,  the  psychologist  provided  education  and  the  case 
formulation and then focused primarily on trauma process-
ing.  The  occupational  therapist  reinforced  education,  and 
then focused on improving functioning in the areas of self-
care, leisure and productivity, supporting Susan in confront-
ing  situations  and  activities  that  were  triggering  or  being 
avoided as a result of her work experiences, and developing 
and overseeing the gradual return to work plan.

Treatment Structure

Psychoeducation and Individualized Case 
Formulation

Both  the  psychologist  and  the  occupational  therapist  pro-
vided  education  to  help  Susan  understand  PTSD,  normal-
ize  her  symptoms,  and  instill  hope  for  recovery.  Aspects 
of  PTSD  that  are  particularly  relevant  for  first  responders 
were  also  addressed,  such  as  the  need  to  suppress  emo-
tional responses while on duty to perform in a safety critical 
role; the police culture; dynamics of accumulative stressful 
events; trained safety behaviours (e.g., increased vigilance, 
scanning  for  threats  and  planning  escape);  and  the  range 
of emotional reactions associated with moral distress. The 
psychologist  also  worked  with  Susan  to  develop  an  indi-
vidualised  case  formulation.  This  included  a  depiction  of 
her experiences of current threat (e.g., feeling like a failure), 
and  identifying  the  processes  that  maintained  it  (e.g.,  her 
high moral standards, emotional suppression at the time of 
the  events,  specific  cues  that  triggered  her  symptoms,  her 
tendency to ruminate and to avoid exploring her memories 
and  emotions,  resulting  in  disjointed  memories  and  unre-
solved  emotions  which  maintained  her  negative  beliefs 
about herself). Following this discussion, the psychologist 
and  Susan  developed  strategies  to  drop  rumination  and 
allow  memories  and  emotions  to  come  and  go  instead  of 
pushing them away.

Reclaiming Your Life Assignments

Like many individuals with PTSD, Susan felt that she had 
permanently changed for the worse and had become a dif-
ferent person as a result of her work experiences. She used 
to be social, curious and an avid athlete, but had given up 
many  activities  and  relationships  that  had  been  a  signifi-
cant  part  of  her  life.  The  occupational  therapist  discussed 
with  her  what  she  could  do  to  reclaim  previously  valued 

and  enjoyed  activities.  Susan’s  goals  included  increased 
socialization with friends and enjoyable activities with her 
husband,  increased  physical  activity,  regular  quiet  activi-
ties such as reading, improving her proficiency in a second 
language, improved sleep quality, and regular mindfulness 
practice. Susan was initially ambivalent about returning to 
work, though the team encouraged her to focus on treatment 
and make this decision at the end of program. Behavioural 
goals  were  discussed  weekly  and  broken  down  into  more 
specific and targeted goals. Susan and the occupational ther-
apist  agreed  on  achievable  first  steps  in  these  areas  using 
a weekly planner and Susan completed assigned activities 
between  sessions.  Sleep  hygiene  was  also  discussed  and 
Susan implemented several strategies, including establish-
ing a sleep routine (a gratitude journal, worry journal, sleep 
and  meditation  apps),  setting  a  consistent  sleep  and  wake 
schedule,  regular  sunlight  exposure  in  the  morning,  and 
avoiding naps during the day.

Trauma Processing

Trauma  processing  following  CT-PTSD  protocol  involves 
accessing  the  trauma  memory,  identifying  meanings  that 
maintain  a  sense  of  threat,  and  integrating  updating  infor-
mation into the trauma account. Trauma-related discussion 
began by drawing a timeline of events that covered the entire 
period of Susan’s career. Three events were identified that 
were highly distressing as well as representative of diverse 
emotional experiences (fear, sadness, guilt, moral distress): 
working with a victim of domestic violence; dealing with an 
aggressive man who held his spouse and child captive; and 
the wire tap operation. Accessing the trauma memory in CT-
PTSD can be completed using imaginal reliving or narrative 
writing. Susan chose narrative writing which involves writ-
ing a detailed account of the trauma while engaging with the 
associated emotions.

Trauma  processing  began  with  addressing  her  work 
with  an  indigenous  woman  who  was  the  victim  of  exces-
sive domestic violence. Susan wrote an account of the event 
as  an  assignment  and  read  it  out  loud  to  the  psychologist 
during  sessions.  Although  she  had  a  strong  grasp  of  the 
rationale  for  experiencing  and  expressing  emotions  dur-
ing  therapy  and  did  not  share  commonly  held  beliefs  that 
discussing emotions is unacceptable, she had difficulty rec-
ognizing when she was distraught, struggled with describ-
ing and naming her feelings, and tended to focus on factual 
information that lacked description of her inner experiences. 
She appeared detached from her emotions while reading the 
account. Therefore, time was spent slowing down the read-
ing, alternating reading with pausing to scan her body for 
physical  sensations  that  might  be  suggestive  of  emotional 
experiences,  and  exploring  the  associated  thought  and 

Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy (2022) 52:319–3271 3feelings. Early on she still tended to focus on other people’s 
experiences (e.g., the victim’s or the perpetrator’s feelings), 
but her awareness of her emotional and physical reactions 
increased over time.

The next step involved identifying the moments associ-
ated  with  the  highest  distress  and  negative  appraisal  (the 
‘hot spots’). Susan’s hot spots involved disturbing images of 
the assaulted victim, accompanied by feelings of horror and 
helplessness and negative appraisals (“the world is cruel”, 
“I  am  powerless  and  my  work  is  meaningless  because  I 
could not prevent this”). Another hot spot involved the vic-
tim crying and in distress, blaming Susan for pushing her to 
go to court, accompanied by feelings of guilt and negative 
self-appraisal (“I am cruel and a terrible person”). The trial 
went well, but months later the victim died from an illness, 
resulting in feelings of guilt, sadness and numbness, associ-
ated with a sense of defeat, and thoughts that she has failed 
to protect the woman and has let the woman and her family 
down. After identifying the hot spots and allowing herself to 
feel the associated emotions, updating information was col-
lected via guided discovery and Socratic questioning. This 
involved  considering  the  situation  from  different  perspec-
tives, reviewing the context and circumstances and the steps 
she  did  take  to  help,  discussing  what  she  knows  now  but 
did  not  know  at  the  time,  and  exploring  her  expectations 
and intentions related to her actions. This enabled her to put 
the  meaning  of  the  hot  spot  into  perspective  (e.g.,  “There 
are cruel people in the world but I can still do my part to 
make  the  world  a  better  place”),  consider  knowledge  that 
was unavailable at the time of the event (“I am glad I pushed 
her to go to court even though it was hard for her, because 
afterwards  she  was  feeling  so  much  stronger”)  and  reflect 
on evidence for and against her negative appraisal (“I sup-
ported her as much as I could but there was nothing I could 
have done to prevent her death”). A collaborative working 
style is essential for these discussions, and the psychologist 
has to assume a perspective of curiosity rather than trying 
to  prove  the  client’s  perspective  to  be  wrong. After  every 
session,  Susan  incorporated  the  updating  information  into 
her narrative, which she read to the psychologist in the fol-
lowing session. To find closure, Susan and the occupational 
therapist went to one of the sites associated with the woman. 
In addition, she wrote a letter to the woman, which she read 
to the psychologist and subsequently burned in a ritual with 
her husband.

Susan and the psychologist then proceeded to the second 
work  event:  a  call  involving  a  violent  man  who  was  high 
on drugs and attacking his spouse and their newborn. Susan 
first  provided  a  detailed  narrative  of  the  event.  Because 
she  had  suppressed  her  feelings  at  the  time  of  the  call  in 
order  to  be  able  to  do  her  job,  time  was  spent  to  explore 
her current emotional and physical reactions while she was 

323

remembering  the  event.  The  dominant  emotion  was  fear 
for the victims, herself and her partner, and hot spots were 
associated  with  three  moments:  the  perpetrator  dragging 
his  spouse  by  the  hair,  whose  face  was  covered  in  blood; 
the perpetrator holding the baby; and Susan and her partner 
fighting with the perpetrator to take him down. The personal 
meaning of these moments was explored (e.g., “What was 
the worst thing about this?”, “What did you think was going 
to  happen?”,  “What  did  this  mean  to  you  at  the  time?”, 
“What does this mean to you now?”), along with exploring 
current physical and emotional reactions. In the next step, 
updating  information  was  identified  (e.g.,  the  woman  sur-
vived; Susan was able to secure the baby unharmed; another 
police officer arrived on scene and helped them to take the 
perpetrator  down),  which  was  subsequently  incorporated 
into the trauma account. To find closure, Susan visited the 
site of the call with the occupational therapist.

The third event involved participating in a high-pressure 
wire  tap  operation  where  Susan  overheard  domestic  vio-
lence occurring and listened to delinquents making suicide 
plans.  This  was  associated  with  feelings  of  fear,  horror, 
helplessness,  and  anger,  and  various  negative  appraisals 
related  to  moral  distress  (e.g.,  “I  am  a  horrible  person  to 
let  this  happen  without  doing  anything  about  it”)  as  well 
as  a  general  sense  of  inadequacy  (“I  can’t  do  this,  I  am  a 
failure”).  Identifying  hot  spots,  exploring  personal  mean-
ings and identifying and incorporating updating information 
was completed using the same strategies as described for the 
other two work events.

Exposure to Triggers

Exposure to triggers following CT-PTSD protocol involves 
trigger  identification,  trigger  discrimination,  confronting 
triggers,  and  visiting  trauma  sites  while  dropping  safety 
behaviours.  Discussions  were  held  to  create  a  list  of  trig-
gering and avoided situations. A subjective units of distress 
(SUDs) scale was used to rate the situations on a 0–10 scale 
based on Susan’s anticipated distress in each situation. The 
hierarchy  included  situations  that  she  found  to  be  gener-
ally stressful (e.g., crowded locations such as transit during 
rush hour and large malls) as well as several places she had 
avoided  due  to  experiencing  difficult  calls.  Safety  behav-
iours  were  also  identified  and  coping  strategies  reviewed. 
All  of  this  was  primarily  completed  by  the  occupational 
therapist but the psychologist added information emerging 
from their sessions.

Susan  completed  ten  exposures  accompanied  by  the 
occupational  therapist,  and  additional  exposures  indepen-
dently. To prepare her for returning to work it was important 
to identify and confront all relevant situations, to increase 
her  confidence  in  her  ability  to  function  in  these  places. 

Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy (2022) 52:319–3271 3324

During  exposures,  the  occupational  therapist  facilitated 
trigger  discrimination  by  encouraging  Susan  to  describe 
what  was  different  between  ‘then’  (the  traumatic  event) 
and ‘now’ (the reminder). He also assessed Susan’s distress 
level regularly using the SUDs scale, coached her through 
breathing and grounding strategies, and highlighted safety 
behaviours.  However,  when  working  with  police  officers, 
therapists  need  to  be  aware  that  many  of  their  avoidance 
and  safety  behaviours  are  adaptive  and  based  on  training 
and experience to keep them safe. In the following sessions, 
Susan discussed what she had learned from the exposures 
and reflected on themes such as civilian versus police officer 
level of vigilance; noticing civilians as regular people rather 
than threats to her safety; and accepting that there is some 
level of risk involved in police officers’ daily activities, but 
that it is important to not overestimate the risk.

Susan and the occupational therapist also completed site 
visits  to  places  that  were  associated  with  the  events  that 
Susan was processing with the psychologist. For example, 
they  went  to  the  house  where  Susan  had  taken  down  the 
violent man, and she was able to highlight differences in the 
neighbourhood  (‘then’  versus  ‘now’),  recognize  the  house 
where  the  event  had  occurred  and  walk  around  the  prop-
erty to get a different perspective. She experienced physical 
and emotional reactions during exposures though had good 
insights  during  each  outing  and  made  excellent  improve-
ment over time. Collaboration between the psychologist and 
occupational  therapist  involved  discussion  around  coordi-
nating  the  timing  of  exposures  with  trauma  processing  to 
facilitate closure. However, it should be noted that trauma 
processing does not always need to occur prior to in vivo 
exposure.

Gradual Return to Work

Although  Susan  had  initially  informed  the  team  that  she 
wished to retire from policing following therapy completion, 
as her treatment progressed, she reported increased interest 
in returning to work as a police officer. Graded exposure to 
work-related  triggers  was  initiated  mid  treatment  and  was 

an important precursor to returning to work. A seven-week 
gradual return to work plan was then created. Susan was an 
additional (supernumerary) worker on shift, so that schedul-
ing shifts was flexible and work duties and hours could be 
adjusted and gradually increased, and to allow her to take 
micro-breaks  for  practicing  symptom  management  strate-
gies and pacing her duties as needed. This was particularly 
important as police officers hold safety sensitive positions 
and the team needed to assess how she responded to various 
work-related stressors. A relapse prevention plan was also 
created which included strategies for maintaining a healthy 
routine  and  work-life  balance  as  she  transitioned  back  to 
work.

The  occupational  therapist  met  with  Susan  weekly 
throughout the gradual return to work, and the psychologist 
met with her twice for check-ins and for the firearm clear-
ance. Susan continued to report some anxiety early on and 
worried about her ability to manage stressors, whether she 
would ultimately be successful in returning to police work, 
and  how  to  best  navigate  conversations  with  colleagues 
regarding her absence. The occupational therapist normal-
ized and validated her anxiety, spent some time role-playing 
and developing strategies for navigating conversations, and 
reviewed stress management strategies and her relapse pre-
vention plan. Subsequently Susan presented in good spirits, 
expressed no concerns about her gradual return to work, and 
reported feeling positive about being back in the workplace.

Outcomes

Throughout  her  time  in  the  program,  Susan  never  missed 
a session, demonstrated excellent engagement and partici-
pation  in  all  sessions,  diligently  completed her  homework 
assignments, and made steady progress with all aspects of 
her  therapy.  She  demonstrated  an  increased  awareness  of 
her inner experiences and ability to express her emotions. 
She reported improvements in her mood, sleep, anxiety and 
ability  to  relax,  and  she  no  longer  experienced  intrusive 
memories,  ruminated  about  the  events  and  her  perceived

teeth  grinding  subsided.  At  the  end  of  the  gradual  return 
to work, she reported being able to perform her work well 
with full duties and full hours which was confirmed by her 
employer.  She  was  discharged  from  the  program  as  fit  to 
return to work without restrictions or limitations. She noted 
a plan to retire, though not in the immediate future.

Psychometric Assessment

Susan’s psychometric scores at each assessment time point 
are presented in Table 1. At intake, her responses indicated 
clinically significant PTSD and moderately-severe depres-
sive  symptomatology,  and  significant  impairment  in  her 
daily functioning. Her scores steadily improved over time. 
From week 8 onwards, her PCL-5 score was below the cut-
score for a probable PTSD diagnosis and her PHQ-9 score 
was  below  the  cut-score  for  clinically  significant  depres-
sion. At discharge, her scores indicated minimal PTSD and 
depressive symptomatology, excellent functioning in all life 
domains measured, and no impairment in her ability to per-
form her work. She was able to maintain her improvements 
through the 9-month reassessment.

Follow-Up and Client Perspective

The psychologist met with Susan via telephone nine months 
after her discharge. Susan shared that she continued to enjoy 
working following completion of her gradual return to work. 
She had retired 1.5 months prior to the follow-up appoint-
ment. She noted she has been able to maintain her mental 
health, and was able to participate in her retirement party at 
the department in good spirits and receive her service award. 
As part of the informed consent process for this article, the 
team had offered Susan the opportunity to describe her own 
perspective of the treatment. In her account, she commented 
on the challenges related to exposure-based treatment com-
ponents  and  highlighted  the  importance  of  the  therapeutic 
relationship:

I knew my greatest need was to dig deep into memories 
that  had  ripped  into  my  soul  over  time.  I  also  needed  to 
develop full trust with my therapists to share such darkness 
and personal struggles. My first session with my psycholo-
gist, Dr. Torchalla was especially important to me. My heart 
was  pounding  and  I  was  tense  and  not  myself.  My  hopes 
for recovery were riding on this relationship. I was treated 
with such respect, dignity, and kindness that I had hope for 
finding my way again. Dr. Torchalla gently and persistently 
encouraged  me  to  write  and  speak  about  experiences  that 
were impacting me. The sessions were intense and challeng-
ing on one hand but enlightening on the other hand. At the 
end of one series of sessions, I wrote a letter to the person 

325

who had died unexpectedly after an investigation. To help 
me let go of this painful memory, I burned the letter with 
sage. Dr. Torchalla had cut sage from her own garden and 
gave it to me for this purpose! The symbolism of this, along 
with that of the action taken, has impacted me immensely. 
It  has  been  the  only  way  I  was  able  to  put  this  matter  to 
rest in my mind and heart over a twelve-year time period. 
After deep discussion over another difficult incident, I used 
another strategy to put a matter to rest that had a long-term 
impact on me. That also worked well. At the same time, I 
was  also  engaged  in  sessions  with  John,  the  occupational 
therapist.  His  approach  to  treatment  was  very  pro-active, 
which I liked, and worked hand in hand with my psychology 
sessions. We went to places that I had spent time in while 
working  and  that  held  dark  memories.  I  hadn’t  realized  I 
avoided them as much as I did. John helped me recognize 
the  impact  I  felt  while  there,  and  view  them  from  today’s 
perspective.  The  negative  feelings  are  no  longer  an  issue 
when I attend those places and I now have an internal dia-
logue that helps me keep it that way. This brings me hope so 
that I look forward with a positive mindset to my life ahead.

Discussion and Conclusions

Intensive  PTSD  treatments  with  active-duty  military,  and 
more  recently,  first  responders  have  gained  increasing 
empirical  support  for  reducing  trauma-related  symptoms. 
The current case report extends this body of knowledge by 
using  an  interdisciplinary  intervention  that  includes  evi-
dence-based psychotherapy to facilitate both PTSD recov-
ery  and  return  to  work.  In  this  program,  existing  PTSD 
therapy protocols are adapted to the workers’ specific needs 
and clinical presentation in various ways: Including an occu-
pational therapist in the treatment of work-related PTSD is 
beneficial  for  addressing  the  increased  functional  impair-
ments  of  individuals  who  are  off  work  (e.g.,  due  to  lack 
of  structure,  routine  and  social  interactions  and  decreased 
necessity to leave the house). Close collaboration between 
the  occupational  therapist  and  the  psychologist  allows  for 
both  reiteration  and  more  in-depth  exploration  of  therapy 
components, and enables the team to address multiple facets 
of treatment concurrently. Because the occupational thera-
pist  took  over  the  ‘reclaiming  your  life’  assignments  and 
exposure to triggers, the psychologist was able to focus pri-
marily on trauma processing. As such, Susan could process 
several events involving a range of emotional experiences, 
both  typical  for  police  officers  and  other  first  responders. 
Early engagement in enjoyable and relaxing activities also 
assisted her with improving her mood and ability to tolerate 
the distress that is associated with the trauma-focused treat-
ment components. Furthermore, although therapy protocols 

Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy (2022) 52:319–3271 3326

often include recommendations that clients engage in expo-
sure  to  triggers  and  avoided  situations  between  sessions, 
they provide little guidance on how to support individuals 
who  struggle  with  exposure  assignments.  Because  of  her 
long  career  there  were  many  places  in  the  city  that  Susan 
avoided,  and  confronting  some  of  them  together  with  the 
occupational therapist diminished her sense of overwhelm. 
Close communication between the psychologist and occu-
pational  therapist  was  beneficial  for  coordinating  the  site 
visits with trauma processing to facilitate closure.

Interdisciplinary  treatment  programs  are  increasingly 
recommended  for  individuals  who  did  not  recover  after 
receiving  standard  PTSD  treatment.  For  example,  Martin-
mäki  and  colleagues  described  a  day  clinic  program  for 
police officers, which took place on one day per week for 9 
months  and  included  trauma  processing,  sociotherapy  and 
psychomotor  therapy. At  the  end  of  the  program,  47%  of 
participants  had  improved  or  recovered  from  their  PTSD 
symptoms (Martinmäki et al., 2021). However, the program 
did not include a return-to-work component. Existing treat-
ment manuals usually lack information on how to address 
return to work, and the few studies that did modify therapy 
protocols to facilitate this were conducted with workers who 
had experienced a single trauma, most notably workers with 
industrial  injuries  (see  Torchalla  &  Strehlau  2018  for  an 
overview). Occupational therapists are trained in functional 
capacity  evaluation  and  thus  are  well  qualified  to  address 
work-related psychological impairments and return to work. 
Consultation with the psychologist prior to and during the 
gradual  return  to  work  process  can  assist  with  determin-
ing  treatment  strategies  and  appropriate  work  duties.  The 
psychologist can also help monitoring the client’s function 
during  the  plan  (even  though  this  was  not  necessary  with 
Susan). Additionally, the team can collaborate to support the 
worker through creating a relapse prevention plan, review-
ing coping strategies, challenging unhelpful beliefs, normal-
izing symptoms, processing unforeseen circumstances, and 
managing setbacks.

The  integrative  treatment  was  comprehensive  and,  for 
Susan,  very  effective.  Like  many  police  officers,  she  was 
highly motivated to recover and she engaged in her therapy 
and the associated assignments with much of the same com-
mitment and diligence as she approached her work duties. 
This was likely a significant factor in her recovery as adher-
ence  to  homework  is  associated  with  better  PTSD  treat-
ment outcomes (Barawi et al., 2020). Susan also identified 
the  therapeutic  relationship  as  important  for  her  recovery, 
which is in line with research suggesting that the therapeutic 
alliance is an essential element of any effective intervention. 
For  example,  in  a  study  using  CT-PTSD,  a  strong  work-
ing alliance at the very start of treatment predicted greater 
symptom  improvement  at  the  end  of  treatment  (Beierl  et 

al., 2021). A collaborative approach between the client and 
the team is imperative, where therapists are compassionate, 
patient,  and  non-judgmental  and  create  an  atmosphere  in 
which clients can safely express feelings of fear, anger, hor-
ror,  guilt,  shame,  frustration  or  sadness.  Handling  clients’ 
distress calmly and with non-judgmental curiosity is helpful 
for  building  trust  and  rapport,  and  after  such  experiences 
many police officers report that sharing their trauma mem-
ory has been relieving and validating.

Limitations of this case study include its generalizability 
and the limited follow-up time period. Despite this, it sug-
gests  that  interdisciplinary,  trauma-focused  treatment  with 
police officers who are off work with PTSD resulting from 
cumulative  traumatic  experiences  is  effective  to  support 
them with their recovery and return to work to an inherently 
stressful job. Although resource intensive and expensive, it 
might  help  workers  return  to  work  earlier  than  less  inten-
sive  treatment.  Larger  studies  are  needed  to  better  under-
stand  how  to  support  police  officers  with  PTSD  recovery 
and a sustainable return to work. Studies are also required 
to  infer  recommendations how  to  best  support  police offi-
cers who are not able to return to work to their pre-injury 
position. Furthermore, prevention is essential. Even though 
Susan had significant training to manage stressful situations 
on the job, she had received little training on mental health. 
Integrating  education  about  first  responder  stress,  coping 
strategies, self care and the importance of talking about dif-
ficult experiences into police departments in a more ongo-
ing, even preventive way could be beneficial. Working with 
police officers who present with PTSD can be very reward-
ing for clinicians, and it is important that they acquire the 
appropriate skills because this will benefit not just the offi-
cers but the communities they serve as well.
