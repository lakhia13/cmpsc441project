Abstract: Background: Mental health services are currently experiencing much systemic and organi-
sational change. Many countries have adopted a recovery approach to service provision through the
development of national policies and frameworks. Within an Irish context, co-production has been
identiﬁed as one of the four pillars required for services to become recovery orientated. However,
there is a paucity of literature relating to the concept within child and adolescent mental health
services. This paper aims to synthesise the peer-reviewed evidence on co-production within such
services. Methods: A PRISMA compliant systematic review was undertaken. This includes how
the reviewer retrieved, shortlisted, and selected studies for inclusion in the review. It outlines the
inclusion/exclusion criteria and how these were further developed through the PICO framework.
Finally, the methods also outline how the reviewer assessed bias and quality, as well as the process of
data synthesis. Results: Two studies were included in this review, both focusing on co-production,
but in different contexts within child and adolescent mental health. Two themes were identiﬁed: ‘road
less travelled’ and ‘co-producing equality’. These themes and the associated sub-themes describe how
co-production works in these services. Discussion: These results highlight the paucity of quality
literature in co-production within child and adolescent mental health. Both studies scored poorly
in terms of quality. Resulting from this review, a number of actions relating to the therapeutic
environment need to be taken into account for co-production to be further implemented. Other: The
reviewer has not received any funding for this paper. A protocol was not created or registered for
this review.

1. Introduction

The presence and primacy of biomedical services in mental health dates back to
1838, when Dr. John Thurman pioneered the use of medical treatment in the care of
those experiencing mental health difﬁculties [1]. The biomedical model is still dominant
in today’s mental health services. However, these same services are in the middle of
substantial systemic and organizational change, as the primacy of the biomedical model is
beginning to be questioned. In an Irish context, such questioning culminated in a national
policy, ‘A Vision for Change’ [2], which was released in 2006. This policy followed other
international reports, such as the UK policy document ‘A National Service Framework for
Mental Health’ [3], which had similar ideology to the Irish document. ‘A Vision for Change’
was groundbreaking in the sense that it envisioned major service reform. It idealized
the closure of traditional asylums while congruently creating community-based services
that allowed for the introduction of numerous initiatives to support the recovery journey
of those with a mental health challenge, for example, multidisciplinary teams and peer
support. The next iteration of this policy, named ‘Sharing the Vision’ [4], was published
in 2020. It envisioned further changes in order to support those in the community before
they even require the help of secondary services. ‘Sharing the Vision’ adds to the work of its

predecessor but also discusses further transformation of services, for example, the adoption
of a trauma orientation to service delivery. Additionally, the focus of this document rests
in the arena of prevention rather than cure, resulting in a recent editorial questioning the
validity of this policy within the context of mental health recovery and secondary mental
health service provision [5].

Most strikingly, ‘A Vision for Change’ included the growing empirical evidence base of
the recovery movement, which promises a more inclusive, holistic mental health service.
Within an Irish context, services provisionally advanced this work by investing heavily in
recovery expertise, particularly within the NHS and the University of Nottingham, through
the adoption of the ImROC (Implementing Recovery through Organizational Change)
methodology. However, since 2017, Irish services have moved away from ImROC, as
evidenced by the adoption of their own recovery framework [6], which focuses on four
key principles of recovery. One of these is co-production. In particular, the document
emphasizes embedding this principle into all aspects of mental health service provision [7].

1.1. Co-Production—A Brief Introduction

According to the Brudney and England [8], co-production is deﬁned as a process
whereby service users/family members/carers/supporters work in an equal and reciprocal
manner with service providers in all aspects of mental health service provision. However,
contrary to popular belief, it is not a new concept. It dates back to the work of Elinor
Ostrom, who ﬁrst developed it within the economics ﬁeld in the 1970s. This was further
conceptualized in later years by both Anne Coote and Edgar Cahn, who adopted it for use
within the public sector [9]. Additionally, the work of Kleinman [10,11] sought to create a
partnership without using the term ‘co-production’. Recently, the mental health recovery
movement adopted the concept and transformed it into the key recovery principle we
use today [12]. The concept, despite existing for almost ﬁfty years, still does not have a
universally acceptable deﬁnition. As such, scholars and organisations such as the Health
Service Executive and others have created their own deﬁnitions of the concept to suit their
given services. For instance, The New Economics Foundation [13] deﬁnes co-production
as “delivering public services in an equal and reciprocal relationship between professionals, people
using services, their families and their neighbours”. In contrast, Vennik and colleagues [14]
suggest that co-production is a process whereby “patients contribute to the provision of health
services as partners of professional providers”.

There are numerous reasons for such disparities in deﬁnitions, including the time
gap evident since conceptualization and the variety of areas/specialties that utilizes the
term [15,16]. Swords [17] adds to this, suggesting that the lack of a universally acceptable
deﬁnition for co-production within the mental health context is explained by the infancy
of co-production in mental health services; therefore, it is currently the subject of scrutiny,
with a universal deﬁnition necessary in order to assess its validity within this speciﬁc
context. However, as this paper observes and discusses co-production through a mental
health context, Norton’s [18] deﬁnition was chosen as most beneﬁcial to use as it adequately
deﬁnes the concept as it appears in mental health. Here, Norton [18] deﬁnes co-production
as “the creation of a dialogical space where the service user, family members, carers and service
providers enter a collaborative medical partnership to improve their own care and service provision”.
Although this deﬁnition is being used, it does not deﬁne co-production in its fullest
context, as a “medical partnership” would not be appropriate in other contexts in which
co-production is used. Co-production differs from other types of involvement noted in
the literature, as it represents transparent, equal, and sincere involvement between all
stakeholders. This approach values each person equally, regardless of experiences or other
categorical differences within the dialogical space. However, as stipulated by Arnstein [19],
other types of involvement do not compare to that of co-production, as they, to a certain
degree, support a hierarchical system whereby some experiences are more credible than
others (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Arnstein’s Ladder of Participation.

For instance, on the bottom of Arnstein’s ladder of participation lies therapy and
manipulation. These are noted by Arnstein to represent non-participation, whereby the
service user has no control or say over their treatment regimes. This type of involvement is
noted within the history of mental health service spanning over many decades [20]. The
middle of the ladder is where we, as a service, presently lie. Placation, consultation, and
informing are all in some way tokenistic practices. Although they involve service users in
their care, the person themselves is not seen as an equal. Instead, their involvement, to some
degree, only occurs to satisfy local policy and procedures. Co-production lies somewhere
within the citizen control realm of Arnstein’s ladder [21]. Within an academic context, this
ladder has been amended on several occasions since 1969, when it was ﬁrst published.
However, the evidence from subsequent ladders has suggested that co-production is graded
at the highest level of participation, whereby all stakeholders are viewed as equal partners
within the organization. As such, they work mutually and reciprocally with one another so
that the people using the service and the organization itself beneﬁt from the co-productive
activity. Figure 2 represents the latest iteration of the ladder of participation and is widely
used in the co-production literature to explain and rationalize it’s use in mental health care.

1.2. Rationale

This review was required for several reasons. First, it is well acknowledged that there
is a paucity of peer-reviewed, quality literature on co-production within adult mental health
services [22]. To date, much of the evidence has been anecdotal and grey in nature, often
presenting itself in the form of organizational reports, guidelines, and editorials. However,
little is known regarding the true extent of peer-reviewed evidence into co-production
within child and adolescent mental health services, and this warrants further investigation.
This information will also be useful for others who wish to grow the evidence base of
co-production in this sector to meet the identiﬁed gap for more practical research into the
concept as noted by multiple scholars in the ﬁeld, including Redman and colleagues [23].
Second, to the best of the author’s knowledge, there has been no synthesis of the co-
production literature within child and adolescent mental health. Such synthesis would
be useful in bridging this publication gap but also in supporting others in future research
projects. Finally, this review was also required as Ireland’s recovery framework, A National
Framework for Recovery in Mental Health, is currently being updated to meet new service

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11897

demands. As a result, this review is timely, as it is hoped to support the creation of
new actions and measures for the next iteration of the framework so that it can be more
applicable to all sectors within mental health service provision.

Objectives

The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the peer-reviewed, academic,
and best-available evidence on the concept of co-production within child and adolescent
mental health. This aim has several objectives underpinning it, including:

1.

2.

3.

4.

To determine the extent of the peer-reviewed literature into the concept of co-production
within child and adolescent mental health,
To synthesise and grade the available peer-reviewed literature captured within the
search strategy,
To create recommended actions to support the implementation of the principle for
the next iteration of ‘A National Framework for Recovery in Mental Health’ and for those
interested in implementing co-production within their local child and adolescent
mental health service (CAMHS), and
To make recommendations for future research into the concept of co-production
within CAMHS.

2. Material and Methods

This systematic review was compliant with the newly updated Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standardised reporting guide-
lines [24]. PRISMA is an approach used to provide guidance on best practices in conducting
and reporting both systematic reviews and meta-analyses so that the approach used can be
transparent and reproducible [25]. PRISMA was ﬁrst created in 2009 but has since been
updated due to advancements in systematic review methodology and terminology [24].

2.1. Epistemological Position

The word epistemology is used to determine what constitutes acceptable knowl-
edge [26]. Based on the premise that recovery, of which co-production is a principle, cannot

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11897

5 of 22

be studied in the same way as adopted in the natural sciences, the reviewer’s epistemologi-
cal stance is based on other researchers’ positions within the ﬁeld and therefore is based
on constructionism [27]. According to Edwards and Titchen [28], constructionists’ views
of the social world include an “emphasis on understanding, appreciation of context, and
acceptance of human beings as active constructors of meaning, rather than as recipients of
externally and objectively deﬁned means”.

2.2. Eligibility Criteria

Inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 1) were created to support the reviewer in select-
ing the appropriate articles for review. To further aid the author in creating the research
question, the PICO method was used [29]. PICO is useful in creating research and review
questions as it divides the potential question into four separate components: population,
intervention, comparison, and outcomes [30]. All of these support the reviewer in creat-
ing the review question. Appendix A provides further information on how the review
questions were formulated, using PICO and Appendix A.3 for the deﬁnition of terms used
in this review. PICO supported the reviewer in creating the review question using the
four important criteria of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome(s). Through
creating the review question, synonyms of the key terms that created the question were
used as part of the search strings for the review.

A primary search was undertaken using eight databases: CINAHL, JSTOR, PsycAR-
TICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library
(Appendix A.2). Following this, a secondary search was conducted using the references of
the already included papers (Appendix A.7, Table A3). This occurred to further strengthen
the rigor of this review.

Search Strategy

The following search terms were used:

“young people” OR “children” OR “adolescents” OR “adolescence” OR “teenagers”
OR “child”
AND
“co-production” OR “co-design” OR “co-delivery” OR “partnership working” OR “in-
volvement” OR “participation” OR “co-creation” OR “co-innovation” OR “co-evaluation”
AND
“mental health” OR “mental illness” OR “psychiatric illness” OR “mental ill health” OR
“mental” OR “psychiatric”
AND
“recovery” OR “mental health recovery” OR “mental well-being” OR “wellness” OR
“self-care” OR “quality of life.”

The pairing of search terms for databases that would not allow full search term input
is documented in Appendix A.6. No limits in years searched and only peer-reviewed
journal articles were inputted into the database search order to align with the aim and
objectives of this paper.

2.4. Selection Process

The selection process occurred through three phases of screening. In round one, all
titles from the search results were screened. When reviewing titles, the reviewer saved all
documents relating to co-production or co-creation or participation or child or adolescent
into a round one folder. This folder was further sub-divided to show how many articles
were saved from each database. Round two incorporated the reading of abstracts of all
articles from the round one saved folder. During this round, duplicates were removed and
placed in the duplicate folder within the round two folder. For the remaining documents
the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 1) were applied, and any documents unrelated
to the research question were excluded. In the ﬁnal screening round, the full text of all
remaining articles was examined and read to ensure it complied with the inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Once this screening process was completed, the remaining articles were
included in this review. To ensure that all possible articles were retrieved and screened
correctly, an independent researcher also undertook a database search using the above
search terms, criteria, and search strategy. They also reviewed the initial search conducted
by the reviewer. Any disagreements between parties were discussed at length until a
consensus was reached.

Data Collection Process

To aid data collection, a data collection tool was used. Study data were extracted and
placed in a Microsoft Word document for the purposes of data collection. A trial of the data
collection form was conducted on the ﬁrst paper reviewed that met the inclusion/exclusion
criteria. This was necessary to ensure that all aspects and intricacies of the ﬁndings
were captured. Data extracted from the studies included authors, year, geographical
location, study aim, sample, sample size, age range, setting, methodological approach, and
theoretical orientation of the given study, if stated. Themes, if possible, were taken from
the raw data (quotes). However, if this was not possible, the raw data and the author’s
interpretation as per the Section 3 were treated equally. This created a limitation, but only
took place in the event of a lack of raw data available due to poor reporting standards by
the authors of the included papers.

2.5. Data Items

Deﬁnitions for key terms that may otherwise be misconstrued (young people, mental
health, and recovery/wellbeing) were documented within the search strategy (Appendix A.3)
and were strictly adhered to throughout the search phases of this review. In addition, even
though the search strategy incorporated both qualitative and mixed method studies, only
the qualitative data of any included mixed method study were extracted. This was decided
at the search strategy development phase, as the research question for this systematic
review required data to demonstrate experiences and effects on a person’s recovery journey,
which cannot be measured using only quantitative methods of analysis. Therefore, all
included papers had to have qualitative data in order to meet the eligibility criteria. As
such, the qualitative data within the included individual studies were extracted.

2.6. Risk of Bias Assessment

As part of this review, bias was assessed by the reviewer as part of the quality appraisal
process. Additionally, during assessment, bias was also assessed under the headings of per-
formance, selection, and attrition bias, and an automated tool developed by McGuiness and
Higgins [31] was utilized to visualize the risk of bias evident in included studies. Robvis is
a web-based application, ﬁrst developed in 2019 to support researchers in assessing and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11897

7 of 22

demonstrating the results of their risk of bias assessments through the use of a trafﬁc light
plot ﬁgure [31]. It has been described as a stable, well-trusted method of demonstrating risk
of bias in a timely and efﬁcient manner [31]. Although this study examined the qualitative
data of included studies, robvis was utilized for two reasons: (1) an included article in
this review is mixed-method in nature, with quantitative aspects to its study design, and
(2) the tool was useful in demonstrating the original authors’ biases in their reporting of
the data. To further support the rigor of this review, risk of bias was also assessed by an
independent researcher to ensure accuracy. Any disagreements between the reviewer and
the independent researcher were discussed at length until consensus was reached.

Assessing the Quality of Evidence

To support the assessments of quality, an adaptation of the tool created by Hawker
and colleagues [32] was used. This tool was initially comprised of nine questions. The
answers were ranked from good to very poor. However, the adaptation by Lorenc et al. [33]
of Hawker’s tool converts such ratings into numerical values, which can then be used to
score a paper’s quality. Each study can score a minimum of nine up to a maximum of
36 points [33]. The tool was used by the reviewer, as it provided numerical values and
grades to the study that other tools like CASP did not. This is useful, as the reviewer and
reader can understand the quality of the included study via the grade given to the study
by the reviewer. This tool was useful to the reviewer because it allowed him to validate
included papers, as it initiated a process whereby a systematic reﬂection of included papers
could occur [34]. To ensure that the assessment of quality was accurate and unbiased,
an independent researcher assessed the quality of both papers using the same tool. Any
disagreements between the reviewer and independent researcher were discussed at length
until consensus was reached.

2.7. Synthesis Methods

This review adopted a thematic analysis approach [35] to analyse and synthesise the
data that came from the included papers. This involved the reviewer becoming familiar
with the data through reading the included studies on numerous occasions. The initial
codes were generated from the original author’s Section 3 of their paper and then combined
to form themes and sub-themes. Over time, these were revised, adjusted, and reﬁned by
the reviewer. This process was supported by the reviewer’s own critical engagement with
their own subjectivities and pre-conceived ideas regarding the research question under
inquiry. This was further supported throughout the process through reﬂection.

2.8. Reporting Bias Assessment

The credibility of evidence presented within a systematic review can be compromised
by reporting bias [36]. Reporting bias describes a process whereby publications/evidence
that should be included/reported in a systematic review are disregarded by the reviewer
due to the nature and direction of the individual study results [37]. To address this, the
reviewer used Berkman and colleague’s algorithm for assessing the risk of reporting bias
(Appendix B) [38].

3. Results

The following presents the results of the above processes, which were undertaken
in accordance with the updated PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-
analyses [23].

3.1. Study Selection

Initially, there were 71 hits related to the concept of co-production in mental health.
This was further narrowed down to 56 results due to the removal of 15 duplicates from
the round two inclusion folder. Further restrictions were applied based on the research
question and predeﬁned inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 1). Following from this, two

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11897

8 of 22

studies remained. A reference search was then compiled on these two papers, resulting in
three additional studies being identiﬁed. However, these were eliminated for a variety of
reasons, which are explained in Appendix A.7, Table A3. This resulted in the ﬁnal tally of
studies included in this systematic review being two (Figure 3).

Figure 3. PRISMA (2020 Edition) Flow Chart. Please note that full reasons for exclusion of studies can be found in
Appendix A.7.

Although this review included studies that were mixed-method in nature, only the
qualitative aspects of such studies were extracted and included in this review in order
to satisfy the review aim and associated objectives. Additionally, meta-synthesis papers
were excluded from this review; their results could not be a true reﬂection of the papers
reviewed, as the reviewers were at least two times removed from the original data [39]. As
such, in lay terms, meta-syntheses are interpretations of previous ﬁndings and may or may
not accurately reﬂect the true ﬁndings of the reviewed papers [25].

3.2. Study Characteristics

The studies consisted of two research papers. One employed a qualitative methodol-
ogy [40], whereas the other utilised a mixed-method approach [41]. It is important to note
here that only the qualitative elements of the mixed-method study were used to inform this
review. These two papers covered a variety of methodologies and perspectives regarding
co-production in child and adolescent mental health. For example, one paper [40] described
how the use of co-production can be useful in supporting service users to regain power
after experiencing childhood sexual abuse. The other paper examined how involvement
in a Discovery College, where co-production with young people occurs, has inﬂuenced
the users’ mental well-being [41]. Fisher and colleagues [40] used an autoethnographic
methodology, whereas Hopkins et al. [41] employed a grounded theory methodological
orientation. See Table 2 for a comparative appraisal of the two included studies. Table 3
also provides further information through a synopsis of each included study.

Childhood sexual abuse has been known to cause power disparities not just in childhood
but also in adulthood if not appropriately addressed. This study utilises an
autoethnographic methodology to explore such power differential experiences while also
examining the potential use of co-production to counteract such disparities of power and
the associated othering that are experienced by survivors of such abuse.

The Discovery College is a new initiative in Australia that aims to provide co-produced
recovery education delivered through an andragogical approach, whereby facilitators and
participants learn together through an equal relationship. Despite the growth in
popularity of such initiatives in mental health services, little evidence thus far is available
to demonstrate the effectiveness nor participant experiences of such colleges. This
mixed-method study was therefore carried out to explore the reasons why young adults
and adults enrol in such colleges and their experiences of participating and also to
measure attitudinal changes resulting from course participation.

3.3. Risk of Bias in Studies

Performance, selection, and attrition bias were checked using McGuiness and Hig-
gins’ [31] automated tool. As noted in Figure 3, both Fisher et al. [40] and Hopkins and
colleagues [41] had an overall score of high risk of bias. These results are presented using
both a table and a trafﬁc light system, which are depicted in Table 4 and Figure 4 below.

As the studies in question used a qualitative methodology to examine co-production
within child and adolescent mental health, the depth of evidence was assessed using an
adaptation of Hawker and colleagues’ [32] quality assessment tool. As per Table 4 above
the results of the quality appraisal process in Table 5 identiﬁed a poor to medium quality
of the included studies, with Fisher and colleagues [40] attaining a C grade and Hopkins
and colleagues having a B grade.

3.4. Results of Synthesis

Through the process of thematic analysis [35], two overarching themes were cre-
ated: ‘road less travelled’ and ‘co-producing equality’. These two themes explore how ill-
ness/traumatic life events can have a negative impact on the self and how engaging in
the process of co-production, particularly within child and adolescent mental health, can
have positive impacts on both an individual’s mental health and sense of self. This occurs
through the sub-themes of redistributing power, changing the environment, and working
within and engaging in the key principles of co-productive practice. Such themes and their
associated sub-themes are illustrated in Table 6 and are further discussed below.

3.4.1. Road Less Travelled

From the papers included, both studies contributed to the theme of ‘road less trav-
elled’. This theme describes how a traumatic event that occurs in childhood can create an
environment where the survivor is stigmatised and effectively silenced by wider society,
thus allowing mental health challenges to manifest within the individual. However, as
the theme progresses, survivors ﬁnd the means to safely express themselves and their

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11897

difﬁculties through the processes of co-production. Such stages in the ‘road less travelled’
are described through the themes of identity in society/services and acceptance.

Identity in Society/Services

One paper [40] describes the accounts of two authors’ experiences of childhood
sexual abuse and the associated othering that occurred as a result. Within this paper,
othering is used to describe the exclusion of survivors from society, thus making these
individuals subordinates to a dominant person or group [40]. This sense of othering ﬁrst
occurs during the abuse, but constantly reoccurs due to a society that prefers not to speak
of such events [40]. This results in further re-traumatisation, as individuals struggle to
ﬁnd an accepting environment that will allow them to explore and move on from such
abuse. Othering also causes the survivor to be observed as damaged and a product for the
abuser’s amusement [40], thus resulting in further re-traumatisation while also creating
feelings of injustice [40]. Fisher and colleagues [40] also suggest that such individuals are
silenced by society due to the blame and silencing culture that modern society endorses.

Acceptance

Hopkins et al. [41] may have addressed one such difﬁculty expressed within Fisher
and colleagues’ [40] paper in terms of ﬁnding a safe space to express one’s life experiences
or difﬁculties. Here, Hopkins et al. [41] suggest that peer involvement in a recovery
educational programme, co-delivered within a recovery college, may support young
people to express themselves safely while also learning speciﬁc skills that they can use
to support themselves. Both of these support the individual to accept their current life
situation and empower them to move forward towards a future that they ﬁnd fulﬁlling [41].

3.4.2. Co-Producing Equality

From the papers examined in this review, both Fisher et al. [40] and Hopkins and
colleagues [41] contribute to the second theme: ‘co-producing equality’. This theme describes
how co-production can be used within child and adolescent mental health to support and
empower individuals in their self-deﬁned recovery journey. Co-production in this context is
explored through the sub-themes of re-distribution of power, environment, and principles.

Re-Distribution of Power

Only one paper [40] discussed the topic of redistributing power. Fisher and col-
leagues [40] discuss how othering, when one experiences childhood sexual abuse, is similar
to that experienced by mental health service users. The aim of this othering is often well
intentioned as it is used to prevent harm to or by service users. However, it is important to
note that a turning point in a person’s recovery from mental ill health is the redistribution
of this power from the mental health professional back to the service user [40]. This can be
done through the process of co-production, as this approach values both learned (profes-
sional) and experiential (service user) knowledge [40]. It allows service users to have an
equal standing in the decisions regarding their own treatment and recovery.

Environment

Both included papers discussed how co-production creates an environment whereby
recovery can occur. According to Fisher and colleagues [40], co-production within the
clinical space offers service users the opportunity to reauthor their narrative. Within this
co-produced space, power is shared in a way that challenges the othering experienced
by service users because of their childhood trauma and subsequent use of mental health
services [40]. Hopkins et al. [41] discuss the co-productive space within a recovery college
environment. An item to note here is how such college environments allow service users
and their families to be central in the co-productive learning environment through the use
of andragogical means of course delivery [41].

Principles

Only one paper discussed the principles of co-productive practice necessary for those
wishing to provide an environment conducive to recovery within child and adolescent
mental health. According to Fisher et al. [40], there are six principles pertinent to creating
this environment. Such principles are listed in Box 1 below.

Assets rather than passive recipients of services
Developing capacity by moving from deﬁcit- to strength-based
Encouraging mutuality in traditional relationships
Blurring traditional boundaries that separate service providers from service users
Network development to enable the transfer of knowledge between partners
Facilitate rather than deliver services

3.5. Reporting Bias

Using Berkman and colleagues’ [38] reporting bias assessment tool (Appendix B),
it was found that there was little evidence of reporting bias on behalf of the reviewer.
Berkman and colleagues’ tool works using an approach similar to that of an algorithm.
Appendix B outlines the algorithm used. The answer to the questions posed determines
where one lands next in the process and ultimately decides whether or not there is reporting
bias evident in the review. This section is new within the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and
is used to assess any bias resulting from missing results in a synthesis [24]. However,
despite this, there is a possibility of reporting bias on two counts. First, a protocol was not
created for this systematic review. This was an error on the reviewer’s part, as protocols
help maintain the rigor of the review itself and as such are now seen as a best practice
when developing both systematic and scoping reviews [25]. Finally, this review also only
captured the qualitative elements of included studies in order to meet the review aims.
This was despite the fact that one included paper [41] employed a mixed-method approach
to their research.

4. Discussion

The ﬁndings of this review suggest that there is paucity of peer-reviewed, evidence-
based literature on co-production within child and adolescent mental health services. This
is in line with evidence relating to co-production within adult mental health services,
where there is a similar shortage [22]. Much of the current literature on the concept of
co-production requests data that would provide clear guidance on how to implement and
work within the conﬁnes of the concept within mental health services [23]. Although this
review does not adequately answer this question, it does provide some insight into what is
needed to practice in a co-productive manner within child and adolescent mental health
services. For instance, creating an environment that allows individuals to discuss and
work through past traumas without dismissing them is vital to the co-productive work
in CAMHS. This need for a suitable environment is in line with previous literature, such
as Norton [18], who suggests the need for “a dialogical space” for true “collaboration” to
occur [18]. Additional to this, the review identiﬁed six key principles that are fundamental
to such collaborations. These principles support services in the redistribution of power so
that both the user and provider are equal within the “dialogical space” [18,40].

4.1. Results in the Context of the Current Literature and Areas for Future Research

To the best of the author’s knowledge, no previous synthesis of peer-reviewed aca-
demic literature has occurred on the topic of co-production within child and adolescent
mental health. From the ﬁndings of this review, it is evident that there needs to be more at-
tention brought to co-production within this specialised area of mental health so that it can
be in line with adult mental health services. For example, in Irish services, co-production

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11897

13 of 22

is a buzzword within adult services, with evident guidance on its implementation [7,18].
However, it is rarely used or even spoke of within CAMHS. This is despite the presence of
a national framework on recovery for all mental health services in Ireland [6].

The present review also documents speciﬁc items to be aware of when practicing
co-production within child and adolescent mental health. These include the use of an
appropriate, safe environment [40,41] and the six principles of co-productive practice [40].
This adds to the knowledge base for co-production within CAMHS as these are now
essential thinking points to consider when working with young people. However, in order
to truly understand the environment necessary for co-production and the pathway towards
using the six principles, further research is required. Additionally, further research is also
required to build the theoretical and practice-based components of co-production within
the arena of child and adolescent mental health.

4.2. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Current Review

This review is possibly the ﬁrst to examine co-production within child and adolescent
mental health under the speciﬁc parameters identiﬁed. The reviewer used robust methods
to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise the included articles. The review also followed
the updated PRISMA guidelines for the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
in order to ensure rigor in the reporting.

However, despite these strengths, the review ﬁndings are limited in terms of general-
isable conclusions due to the low number of studies included. Limitations also result from
the poor quality of both included papers within all of the domains of the critical appraisal
tool. The small number of papers included in this review also presents a challenge, possibly
incorrectly representing the available literature relating to co-production in child and ado-
lescent mental health. This possibly occurred due to the strict and rigorous search strategy.
However, reviewers should conduct future reviews using a scoping methodology that is
less rigorous, so that the true presence of the literature pertaining to co-production in such
settings is adequately demonstrated. Additionally, due to the poor reporting standards of
the included papers, the raw data (quotes) and the original authors’ interpretations of the
same via the Section 3 of the included papers were treated as equal data. This may cause
bias in interpreting the results of this review, as the interpretation relied heavily on other
authors’ interpretations of the raw data.

5. Conclusions

This review examined the peer-reviewed academic literature on co-production in
child and adolescent mental health. It identiﬁed the paucity of literature currently in place
relating to co-production for this cohort of service users. However, despite this, there was
some evidence that reﬂected how co-production works in practice within these services.
From the identiﬁcation of such practices, areas of importance for the next iteration of ‘A
National Framework for Recovery in Mental Health’ as it relates to CAMHS can be noted and
addressed. However, this review does acknowledge the need for more comprehensive
and rigorous research to be undertaken in order to build on the theoretical and practical
elements of co-production, which were highlighted here. Finally, as co-production expands
in popularity in adult mental health services, it is imperative that the same eagerness and
expertise is awarded to the development of this recovery topic within CAMHS.
