Abstract
Background  General Practitioners (GPs) are involved in preconception, pregnancy, and postnatal care. Overall, 
mental health remains a significant contributor to disease burden affecting 1 in 4 pregnant women. Psychotropic 
medication prescribing occurs in almost 1 in 12 pregnancies, and appears to be increasing, along with the prevalence 
of mental health disorders in women of reproductive age. Perinatal mental health management is therefore not 
an unlikely scenario within their clinical practice. This scoping review aims to map current research related to GPs 
perceptions and experiences of managing perinatal mental health.

Method  A comprehensive search strategy using nine electronic databases, and grey literature was undertaken 
between December 2021 and February 2023. Relevant studies were sourced from peer review databases using key 
terms related to perinatal mental health and general practitioners. Search results were screened on title, abstract and 
full text to assess those meeting inclusion criteria and relevance to the research question.

Results  After screening, 16 articles were included in the scoping review. The majority focused on perinatal 
depression. Findings support that GPs express confidence with diagnosing perinatal depression but report issues of 
stigma navigating a diagnosis. Over the last two decades, prescribing confidence in perinatal mental health remains 
variable with concerns for the safety profile of medication, low level of confidence in providing information and a 
strong reliance on personal experience. Despite the establishment of perinatal guidelines by countries, the utilisation 
of these and other existing resources by GPs appears from current literature to be infrequent. Many challenges exist 
for GPs around time pressures, a lack of information and resources, and difficulty accessing referral to services.

Conclusion  Recommendations following this scoping review include targeted perinatal education programs 
specific for GPs and embedded within training programs and the development of practice guidelines and resources 
specific to general practice that recognises time, services, and funding limitations. To achieve this future research is 
first needed on how guidelines and resources can be developed and best delivered to optimise GP engagement to 
improve knowledge and enhance patient care.

Introduction
Mental health conditions are a common presentation for 
women of reproductive age and occur in over a quarter of 
women during the perinatal period, defined as the period 
from  conception,  through  pregnancy  and  the  year  after 
birth  [1,  2].  General  Practitioners  (GPs)  are  involved  in 
preconception,  early  pregnancy  care  and  postnatal  care. 
They  also  manage  the  majority  of  patients  with  mental 
health  disorders,  including  high  prevalence  disorders 
such  as  anxiety  and  depression,  commonly  with  pre-
scribed antidepressant medications [3]. More and more, 
GPs  also  manage  women  with  severe  mental  illnesses 
who may be planning to conceive or are pregnant as part 
of  the  shared  care  system  which  exists  within  our  com-
munity mental health care system [4].

Almost 1 in 12 pregnancies are associated with psycho-
tropic  prescribing  and  evidence  suggests  that  this  rate 
is  increasing  [5,  6]  alongside  the  prevalence  of  mental 
health disorders in women of reproductive age [7]. Esti-
mates put around 15% of women of reproductive age in 
the  United  States  (US)  as  being  prescribed  antidepres-
sant  medication  [8]  and  combined  with  high  rates  of 
unplanned  pregnancy  in  the  general  population  rates 
of  exposure  to  psychotropic  medication  may  be  higher 
than  suggested.  This  makes  reproductive  planning  and 
psychotropic  medication  counselling  difficult  in  most 
cases, but vital when considering strategies to maximise 
mental wellbeing [9]. Dealing with the scenarios of men-
tal  health,  psychotropic  prescribing  and  pregnancy  is 
therefore likely to be a frequent encounter within general 
practice and one that many GPs would be familiar with.

As part of the overall comprehensive care for pregnant 
women with existing mental illness, including identifica-
tion,  psychoeducation  and  referral  for  support  counsel-
ling services, prescribing practices can have a significant 
impact, not just on the women’s mental health in terms of 
risk of relapse [10], but also on the potential risks to the 
pregnancy and the unborn child. It is a complex issue for 
women and health professionals. Available evidence from 
the  United  Kingdom  suggests  that  many  women  ceased 
taking  psychotropic  medication  when  they  learn  they 
are  pregnant  [11].  Research  in  women  with  anxiety  and 
depression  and  medication  use,  suggest  that  GPs  have  a 
strong influence on early decision-making [12]. Any dis-
continuation, switching, or lowering of doses of medica-
tion during planning or in the earlier stages of pregnancy 
needs to be carefully considered in the context of weigh-
ing up the risks and benefits of treatment, ideally as part 
of  a  shared  decision-making  process.  This  discussion  is 
often led by the woman’s GP, however, there is a need to 
explore what advice GPs give and what sources of infor-
mation they use to aid this process.

Clinical  practice  guidelines  aim  to  reduce  risk  by  out-
lining the research literature with the latest evidence and 

recommendations.  Over  the  last  three  decades  invest-
ment  into  research,  education  and  raising  awareness  of 
perinatal mental health has occurred. Countries like Aus-
tralia, the United Kingdom (UK) and United States have 
developed resources which focus on the area of perinatal 
mental  health  to  assist  community  members  and  health 
professionals  alike  including  clinical  practice  guidelines. 
Further,  however  we  need  to  understand  how  these 
resources  and  clinical  practice  guidelines  are  used  by 
general practitioners and how GPs can best be supported 
in our health system to facilitate best practice to improve 
health  outcomes  for  women  with  mental  illnesses  and 
their babies.

A  scoping  review  was  deemed  the  most  appropriate 
method  of  assessing  the  literature  in  trying  to  examine 
broadly  General  Practitioner  experiences  of  managing 
perinatal  mental  health.  Scoping  reviews  are  often  used 
to  map  existing  research  by  synthesizing  the  evidence 
within  a  given  field  in  terms  of  its  nature,  features,  and 
volume  and  thereby  identify  gaps  and  make  recommen-
dations  for  future  research  [13].  This  method  is  useful 
when  the  nature  of  the  research  question  is  complex  or 
heterogenous.

Method
Guidelines  set  out  by  Arksey  and  O’Malley  [14]  created 
the methodological framework for this review. To ensure 
a  rigorous  scoping  review,  five  stages  were  adhered  to: 
identifying  the  research  question,  identifying  relevant 
studies,  study  selection,  charting  the  data,  and  collating, 
summarizing, and reporting the result.

Identifying the research question

Our  aim  was  to  broadly  explore  what  is  known  about 
GPs’  experiences  with  perinatal  mental  health.  Further, 
we wished to understand aspects related to management 
including  clinical  practice  or  guidelines,  and  psycho-
tropic  prescribing.  We  adopted  a  wide  approach  from 
the  outset  to  gain  a  sense  of  the  scope  of  literature  and 
identify gaps in knowledge and further areas of research. 
As such, the research wanted to question what is known 
from  the  existing  literature  of  General  practitioners’  (or 
equivalent)  perceptions  and  experiences  when  managing 
perinatal mental health conditions.

Search Strategy

A  comprehensive  search  strategy  using  nine  electronic 
databases  was  undertaken  between  December  2021  and 
January  2022,  with  a  final  rerun  of  the  search  strategy 
completed  in  February  2023:  GlobalHealth,  PubMed, 
Informit  Health  Collection,  EMBASE,  MEDLINE, 
PsycINFO,  Scopus,  Best  Practice,  ClinicalKey;  along 
with  a  search  of  alternative  grey  literature  sources  e.g., 
Google Scholar. No limits were set on date, language, or

were created by the authors and tailored for the specific 
requirements  of  each  database  (see  Appendix  A).  Key 
terms were related to the perinatal period, psychotropic 
prescribing,  best  practice  guidelines  and  mental  health. 
The reference lists of included articles were also manually 
searched  for  any  relevant  research,  as  well  as  looking  at 
articles which had cited the included articles.

Citation management

All  citations  were  imported  into  a  software-based  refer-
ence  manager  EndNote.  Duplicates  were  removed  with 
the  aid  of  EndNote’s  software,  with  further  duplicates 
removed later in the review process.

Eligibility criteria

All  articles  were  screened  in  a  two-stage  process;  titles 
and abstracts were screened for relevance, followed by a 
full-text review. If studies appeared to describe the man-
agement  of  mental  health  within  the  perinatal  period, 
they  were  eligible  for  inclusion.  Studies  that  were  not 
written in English, and did not have an available transla-
tion, were excluded. Systematic reviews of perinatal men-
tal health were excluded. Studies that appeared to assess 
general  medication  management  within  the  perinatal 
period or general health within the perinatal period were 
excluded, along with studies that did not have a clear GP 
or equivalent role e.g., a family physician is the US equiv-
alent  of  a  GP.  Studies  that  included  other  roles  in  addi-
tion to the GPs, such as psychiatrists, needed to provide 
a clear separation of findings to be included in the study, 
i.e., if researchers reported scores in aggregate, the article 
was  excluded.  Conference  proceedings  without  full  text 
articles  were  excluded.  Articles  that  focused  on  the  use 
of  alternative  or  complementary  medicines  were  also 
excluded.  Article  screening  was  completed  by  SS  and 
reviewed by JF.

Data charting

To complete a narrative review and synthesis of the arti-
cles, a data charting form was created in Excel to capture 
relevant information needed for analysis. Characteristics 
of  the  articles  were  extracted  by  SS  and  reviewed  inde-
pendently by JF. The information captured in the form is 
shown in Table 1.

From the information extracted, thematic process was 
adopted to highlight common themes within the articles 
included in the scoping review. These themes would then 
explain what the current landscape of GP experiences is 
when managing perinatal mental health, while also high-
lighting areas where there is a lack of research or limited 
understanding.

Results
Overview of the current literature

The original search was conducted over December 2021 
and  January  2022  and  yielded  a  total  of  1,170  poten-
tial  articles.  After  two-stage  screening,  16  articles  were 
included in the scoping review. The flow of articles from 
initial identification to inclusion are represented in Fig. 1.
Of  these  16  included  studies,  44%  were  carried  out 
in  the  UK,  followed  by  18%  in  Australia,  including  one 
Australian  and  Canadian  joint  study.  The  final  six  stud-
ies were undertaken in six separate locations worldwide. 
Methodological  designs  consisted  of  qualitative,  quan-
titative  survey  and  mixed  methods  (see  Table  1).  No 
quality appraisal of the literature was undertaken in this 
review, only the extent and range of the literature is pre-
sented.  To  ensure  all  recent  research  was  captured,  the 
literature search was conducted again in February 2023; 
the  search  yielded  no  new  articles  which  detailed  GPs 
perspectives on prescription of psychotropic medication 
in the perinatal period.

All  studies  were  required  to  assess  the  experiences 
and  perceptions  of  general  practitioners  or  equivalent. 
However, studies within the review also assessed the per-
ceptions of health care visitors, obstetricians and gynae-
cologists, women, and psychiatrists. For the purposes of 
this review, the focus will remain on GP experiences and 
responses.

The  majority  of  the  articles  focused  on  perinatal 
depression  [15–25],  depression  and  anxiety  [26,  27], 
identifying  psychosocial  vulnerability  [28],  post-trau-
matic  stress  disorder  [29]  and  overall  perinatal  mental 
health [30].

Characterisation of general practitioner’s experiences
Identification and diagnosis

The  literature  supports  findings  that  GPs  appear  confi-
dent  in  the  diagnosis  of  mental  health  difficulties,  with 
particularly  awareness  of  postnatal/perinatal  depression 
[16] rather than other less common diagnoses [29]. GPs 
acknowledge that perinatal mental health was an impor-
tant area [24] though not without challenges. There was 
reported hesitancy for some GPs to diagnose due to per-
ceived  associations  with  ‘labelling  and  stigma’  [17,  18], 
women’s  hesitancy  in  seeking  help  or  disclosing  issues 
again reported due to a perceived lack of acceptance of a 
problem, stigma and the interaction between the GP and 
patient [16, 18, 30], and inconsistencies of how symptoms 
are viewed between GPs and patients. This was particu-
larly challenging in women from Culturally and Linguis-
tically Diverse groups [19, 30].

A  biopsychosocial  approach  to  diagnosis  was  used 
most  commonly  by  GPs,  using  perceived  vulnerability 
and  instinct,  risk  factors  including  social  determinants, 
psychiatric and somatic conditions, supportive networks

and inherent resilience [17, 28] with diagnosis conceptu-
alised  using  this  approach  [18,  30].  Although  GPs  liked 
the  idea  of  screening  tools,  there  appeared  to  be  a  lack 
of use of these formal screening tools, such as the Edin-
burgh  Postnatal  Depression  Scale  (EPDS),  to  routinely 
screen  women  [17–19,  24].  These  tools  were  seen  as 
being  more  helpful  in  the  postpartum  period  [24]  and 
used more as an aid to diagnosis or as part of the referral 
process  [30].  GPs  felt  that  consistency  of  care  was  vital 
in  supporting  diagnosis  [17–19,  26,  28–30]  but  also  for 
management.

Pharmacological management

There  was  variability  in  GPs  confidence  in  prescribing 
psychotropic medication. GP initiated antidepressant use 
in the perinatal period was high [26]. However, prescrib-
ing antidepressants as new onset in the perinatal period 
is  viewed  as  second  or  third  line  in  GPs,  with  psycho-
logical  treatments  and  support  structures  taking  prece-
dence [15, 16]. This was  potentially influenced  by a lack 
of resources being available including access to care [16, 
19, 21, 22, 30].

Decisions  around  treatment  choice  were  influenced 
partially  by  patient  factors  [15]  with  a  focus  on  patient 
centred  care  [30].  This  was  not  without  challenges  as 
women  were  reported  to  stop  medication  abruptly  on 
confirming  a  pregnancy  [22].  There  remained  uncer-
tainty  around  the  safety  profile  of  medication  and  low 
confidence in giving advice [15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 30]. Some 
GPs  viewed  treatment  in  pregnancy  as  very  different 
compared to those who were not pregnant due to a per-
ceived  heightened  vulnerability  in  pregnancy  in  general 
and concerns over legal liability regarding medication use 
in  pregnancy  [15,  30].  Inconsistent  prescribing  patterns 
[21,  25]  were  reported,  with  question  concerning  the 
undertreatment  of  women  in  the  perinatal  period  [22]. 
The literature reported a strong reliance on GPs personal 
experience  or  experiences  of  colleagues  in  influencing 
their management [21, 22, 30] combined with a low use 
of guidelines [21, 22] to aid in prescribing practices.

Management resources

A limited knowledge of and access to educational oppor-
tunities,  clinical  exposure  and  appropriate  resources 
impacted GPs in their practice [23, 26, 30]. Training was 

Frayne et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:832  
Page 8 of 10

seen to increase the use of screening tools [24]. There was 
variable confidence in providing reliable information and 
resources to guide women in the decision making around 
these medications [22] and a lack of access of up to date 
safety data [25]. Pharmacy services were commonly used 
by  GPs,  as  well  as  routine  pharmacopeia’s,  the  internet 
[25]  with  often  limited  written  information  on  medica-
tion provided [26], and then mainly sourced from MIMS 
and product information.

The  limited  use  of  guidelines  corresponded  to  reports 
of GPs feeling overwhelmed by the quantity of guidelines 
for various medical conditions [22, 25], the lack of clear 
and specific direction [22, 30], often being too restrictive 
for individual circumstance [22], and too large in content 
to be useful [30].

Systems and service

Systemic limitations add difficulty. Many challenges exist 
for GPs around duration of consultations and how much 
can  be  covered.  Perinatal  mental  health  requires  a  sig-
nificant time investment [16, 26] for adequate disclosure 
and  consultation  for  both  patients  and  clinicians  [18]. 
The absence of clearly defined pathways [19] also impacts 
time commitment and the treatment plan. In some health 
systems it remains unclear where responsibility lies, and 
this  can  be  compounded  by  issues  around  communica-
tion between services [20].

The overwhelming global systemic problem appears to 
be a lack of resources to refer patients on to [17, 19, 22, 
30].  GPs  generally  lack  trust  in  general  psychiatric  ser-
vices,  the  prioritising  of  care  and  long  wait  times  [29]. 
They  would  prefer  to  see  local  perinatal  services  [29]  if 
they  were  readily  available  [30]  but  acknowledge  that 
these services often have time limitations with care.

Discussion
Our  scoping  review  provides  an  overview  of  what  is 
known  in  the  existing  literature  on  the  perception  and 
experiences  of  General  Practitioners  when  managing 
perinatal mental health. Most studies focused on depres-
sion in the perinatal period with limited studies existing 
outside  of  depression  and  anxiety.  The  Royal  Australian 
and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists [31] state that 
perinatal  mental  health  includes  all  mental  health  dis-
orders,  recognising  that  the  pregnancy  and  postnatal 
period provides a time of risk for new onset or relapse of 
symptoms.  GPs  are  cognisant  of  the  breadth  of  mental 
health disorders, with a recent Australian survey, Health 
of  the  Nation  2022  [32],  stating  psychological  issues  are 
one of the most common health conditions they manage.
In  the  literature  GPs  appear  overall  more  confident  in 
diagnosis than management, but areas of stigma for both 
patients and health professionals occur in disclosing and 
navigating  a  diagnosis.  Two  aspects  discussed  in  this 

review include the use of a biopsychosocial approach and 
the importance of consistency of care, which are consid-
ered pillars of general practice and general practice edu-
cation  [33,  34].  The  literature  suggested  that  screening 
tools have their place in general practice but are possibly 
used  more  as  an  adjunct.  It  remains  unclear  if  and  how 
GPs are using these tools in their day-to-day practice cur-
rently  given  that  the  studies  included  in  this  review  are 
over 10 years old and guidelines on screening have been 
introduced  and  updated  subsequently.  Consensus-based 
recommendations  from  the  recently  updated  COPE 
perinatal  management  guidelines  (2023)  [35]  recom-
mend that all women should complete the EPDS prefer-
ably twice, in both the antenatal period and the postnatal 
period,  ideally  6–12  weeks  after  the  birth.  In  Australia, 
GPs  in  the  vast  majority  are  delivering  postnatal  care 
to  women  with  potential  barriers  for  screening  existing 
including time limitations.

There  appears  to  be  support  for  using  nonpharmaco-
logical  therapies  first  line,  with  variation  in  medication 
prescription and use, including some strategies not sup-
ported  by  the  evidence  such  as  tapering  of  medication 
[15]. Delivering education is important, for both women, 
who  were  seen  to  cease  medication  abruptly  on  confir-
mation  of  pregnancy,  consistent  with  studies  in  the  lit-
erature  [36],  and  for  GPs  who  viewed  management  in 
pregnancy  as  distinct  from  those  who  are  not  pregnant 
and  face  uncertainty  around  the  safety  of  medication. 
GPs  disengagement  with  perinatal  care  in  general  is 
regarded as potentially leading to a deskilling in this area 
[27] and there are calls for a standardised GP trainee edu-
cation [30] program specific to perinatal mental health.

The  use  of  clinical  or  best  practice  guidelines  in  this 
area is reported as limited. Several countries have intro-
duced  guidelines  and  other  resources  for  health  pro-
fessionals  during  the  time  of  the  studies  included  in 
this  scoping  review,  but  it  is  not  known  whether  GPs 
are  aware  of,  find  benefit  from  and/or  are  using  such 
resources.  Clinical  practice  guidelines  aim  to  reduce 
risk  by  guiding  clinicians  based  on  the  research  litera-
ture  with  the  latest  evidence  and  recommendations.  A 
review  of  international  clinical  practice  guidelines  for 
perinatal  depression,  and  antidepressant  medication 
published by Molenaar et al. [3]. found the need for up-
to-date and specific perinatal guidelines to help clinicians 
and patients in the shared decision-making process. We 
would  propose  that  this  needs  to  be  specific  and  user 
friendly  for  GPs  as  they  report  feeling  overwhelmed  by 
the  amount  and  volume  of  current  guidelines  for  the 
many conditions that see within their practice.

The  available  literature  suggests  that  GPs  rely  on  per-
sonal  experiences  to  guide  them,  with  reliance  on  their 
own clinical experience and their colleagues. When con-
sidering GPs interaction with other health professionals,

resources  can  be  developed  and  best  delivered  to  opti-
mise GP engagement to improve knowledge and enhance 
patient care.

national  and  international  medication  information  ser-
vices, with requests increasing markedly since 2013 when 
the rate was 15.6% [37]. The consistent demand for these 
services  despite  the  increasing  availability  of  guidelines 
and web-based information indicates a need for clear and 
accessible information for prescribers, above what is pro-
vided by product information and drug categorisation in 
pregnancy [38], which these studies reported GPs used.

The lack of referral resources for ongoing management 
was  a  common  theme  in  this  review.  A  metanalysis  by 
Ford et al. [39] in 2017 concludes that GPs remain frus-
trated  by  the  lack  of  services  and  resources.  It  is  uncer-
tain  whether  the  lack  of  resources  is  resulting  in  the 
undertreatment and underdiagnosis of women [17] or an 
increased use of prescription medication first line. Guide-
lines [35, 40] recommend seeking advice, preferably from 
a  specialist  in  perinatal  mental  health  particularly  when 
initiating  medication  in  pregnancy,  but  is  this  practical 
when resources are stretched? GPs are familiar with initi-
ating  pharmacological  management  with  antidepressant 
and antianxiety medication [26] and would benefit from 
increased resources to support them in this role.

Strengths and limitations

The  strength  of  this  review  includes  its  systematic 
approach to identifying articles related  to  General Prac-
titioners (or their equivalent) experiences around perina-
tal mental health more broadly and to map the research 
area.  Limitations  included  the  different  health  care  ser-
vices and resources available, and therefore variable expe-
riences that occurred in differing countries. Further, the 
quality of literature was not appraised, therefore limiting 
the review to a descriptive account of GPs experiences.

Conclusions and implications for research and practice

Overall, GPs feel somewhat confident in diagnosing men-
tal health disorders within the perinatal period. They rely 
on a biopsychosocial and continuity of care model. Man-
agement  of  these  conditions  becomes  more  challenging 
with  many  depending  on  clinical  experience  and  col-
leagues, with a lack of resources for consultations, refer-
ral,  services,  and  information  provision.  Medication  is 
frequently initiated by GPs with limited use of guidelines.

tations.  Future  research  identified  include  the  use  and
