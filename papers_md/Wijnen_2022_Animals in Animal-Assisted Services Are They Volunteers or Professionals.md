Simple Summary: Animal welfare is a growing concern in Animal-Assisted Services. Although stud-
ies have been conducted on stress signals and—to a lesser extent—positive emotions, no research has
yet been conducted on the motivation of the integrated animal, to the best of our knowledge. Not all
therapy animals are trained to assist. Are they volunteers or professionals? Volunteers have a higher
degree of self-government and can quit when they are not motivated anymore. Professionals might,
however, go the extra mile. Can we compare animal volunteers and professionals to their human
equivalents? If so, this might help to structure discussions about animal welfare and motivation
in interventions. Furthermore, it can provide better arguments for the career planning and career
ending of these animals. Using animal-friendly interventions might inﬂuence motivation and, conse-
quently, the moment at which efforts cease. Studying motivation is not easy, as it requires data on
dopamine, the molecule involved in motivation, reward and repetition of behavior. However, the use
of wearable techniques such as on site electroencephalograms (EEGs) for freely moving animals and
non-invasive dopamine measurements is a developing and promising area of research. The translation
of these data into context-ethograms—ethograms that show behavior in a context/intervention—can
help handlers and therapists to understand the behavior of their therapy animal better and with
less subjectivity.

Abstract: With the increasingly common practice of Animal-Assisted Services (AAS), whether in
therapy, coaching, education, or volunteering programs, the concern over animal welfare has also
risen. However, no standards have yet been established for good practices to ensure the animal’s
mental health. This is largely due to the wide variety of roles played by animals in interventions
and the lack of ‘job descriptions’ for the animal in diverse settings. Some professionals call their
animal a ‘volunteer’, others mention that some directive guidance is given to the therapy animal, and
some assistance animals are highly trained. Misunderstandings could be avoided if the integrated
animal were to receive a justiﬁable label: volunteer or professional. Choosing either one comes
with obligations for the owner, handler, or therapist. In this paper, we compare the roles of human
volunteers and professionals to the roles of animals involved in therapy. We also demonstrate
the obligations that come along with the decision to label animals as such either volunteers or
professionals. Furthermore, we make a plea for animal-friendly interventions, whether in a volunteer
position or as a professional, in order to stimulate the animal’s cooperation and motivation. Studying
dopamine and translating the ﬁndings into context-ethograms can provide a way to judge behavior
more objectively.

At ﬁrst, this started with merely the presence of animals in therapy sessions, planned or by
coincidence, which seemed to have an impact on the client involved [1]. The interventions
evolved and the role of the animals became more active and dominant [2], which has
recently led to growing concerns relating to the welfare of the animals involved in these
interventions [3]. The need for protocols to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both species
has emerged, such as quality measurements and best practices [4]. This raises the following
question: ‘do animals beneﬁt too?’ [5].

In this discussion paper, we focus on the role of the animal and whether its integration
in an intervention should be regarded as voluntary work or a profession. Choosing either
one of these options might inﬂuence the way therapists and handlers integrate the animal
in therapy sessions on the one hand and the competencies of the animal on the other.

We challenge the therapy animal handlers or therapists working with animals to
reconsider their animal’s working conditions. Is the animal working as a volunteer or
as a professional, and how do we decide the difference? A comparison with the rights
of human volunteers and human professionals could help to support and structure the
discussion around animal welfare in AAS. Although research has been carried out to study
stress in animals, little supportive research has been conducted on their positive emotions
during interventions [6], and no research has been conducted on motivation. Motivation
can be seen as the driving force encouraging an animal to show and repeat behavior,
seeking the reward it anticipates and the salience of the reward—a process modulated by
dopamine [7]. In this article, we also suggest a neurological approach in order to obtain a
better understanding of motivation driven by dopamine during AAS, and as such obtain a
better understanding of the welfare and wellbeing of the animal.

Guidelines for housing, feeding, moving space, communications with co-species, and
other physical and mental care are not discussed in this paper, as these have already been
covered by the white paper of the International Association of Human Animal Interactions
(IAHAIO) [8] and Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) protocols [6]. The latter also explains
the presence and absence of stress signs in handled animals in HAI; however, in this paper
we stress the need to label the animal’s performance ﬁrst before stating matching welfare
conditions. They might be different, and the animal’s motivation could play a central role
in this discussion.

The idea of this paper is to encourage and structure the discussion about animal
welfare in AAS by using a human model for comparison and taking a closer look at
motivation of animals.

2. Reconsidering Reciprocal Altruism

Many researchers have theorized about the working mechanisms in AAS, and several
models and theories have been proposed across the literature [9–14]—few to none of them
are supported by robust evidence-based ﬁndings in large samples. Another mechanism
which has almost been forgotten is the theory of reciprocal altruism. Why do animals
cooperate with us?

Although this hypothesis is by no means new in evolutionary biology, the relationship
of two species that mutually beneﬁt each other resembles the relationships seen between
humans and animals in human–animal relationships and in therapeutic sessions. Reciprocal
altruism was ﬁrst used by the biologist Robert Trivers to describe the behavior in which
one organism acts in a way that temporarily reduces its ﬁtness while increasing the ﬁtness
of another, with the expectation that the other organism will act in the same way at a later
date [15]. Examples are the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus, which swim with the client
ﬁsh at the risk of being eaten while they clean the skin or the mouth of the client [16], and
oxpeckers, which remove parasites from the skin of rhinos by picking them up sitting on
their backs and at the same time alarming the rhinos to allow them to detect and evade
human hunters [17].

There is a time tension in this hypothesis: the expectation of the bidding organism is
that the favor will be returned later. This can be in the form of the food, shelter or attention

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

that the other in the dyad offers. In the end, the equilibrium is evolutionarily beneﬁcial
for the ﬁtness of both [18]. In the world of animal-assisted care, we can ﬁnd similarities in
interventions in which animals present themselves to be integrated into the intervention
without resistance, sometimes even with visible pleasure and reciprocity. There is also
criticism of the theory behind reciprocal altruism, particularly because animals live more in
the moment and do not consciously look forward to the future, like humans [19]. Animals
would not be cognitively concerned with the investment they now offer and would adopt
an expectant attitude towards a possible return. However, Schino and Aureli mention that
reciprocity is (not) always cognitively demanding but rather can be seen as emotion-based
mental accounting [20]. In practice, it can be observed that the animals in AAS offer a more
or less conscious investment—they do not refuse, but cooperate, sometimes with visible
pleasure, sometimes stoically [21]. Perhaps the reciprocity is so close that a habituation
or conditioning occurs. After work, the animals eat and rest and there is room for social
behavior with group members. The efﬁcacy of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) depends
heavily on the reciprocity of animals, patients and team members [22].

Altruism in humans and animals feeds the dopamine reward systems in the brain [23];
it feels good to give voluntarily to others, not only to one’s kin [20]. This presumes a kind
of interspecies communication, similar to the study of cow language towards the human
handler [24].

In AAS, the behavior of trained dogs might disguise their original altruism. It is known
that a DNA change in the domesticated dog related to the Williams Beuren Syndrome
(also in humans) is the reason for the hypersocial behavior of many dogs. This has been
attributed to the rapid divergence of dogs and wolves and is thought to have facilitated
their coexistence with humans [25]. However, many untrained animals also show altruistic
behavior. Donkeys are an example of animals showing human’s friendly, cooperative
behavior, without being trained for it [26]. In AAS, they are merely educated but not
trained. Is there an evolutionary beneﬁt for their altruistic comportment?

3. Animal Welfare in AAS

In the scientiﬁc literature, many studies can be found on the positive effects of AAS
on humans of different ages and different diagnoses [27–31]. What we know less about
is what the positive experiences are for the animals. It is difﬁcult to read enthusiasm
from certain animals. A dolphin’s smile is not a smile, but rather an anatomical formation
of its face. Donkeys and dogs are often pleasing animals and do not resist when they
are incorporated; in fact, when a dog shows fear signals, a line may have already been
crossed. There is a growing body of studies on stress signals in dogs and in horses [32]
and on emotions in animals [33]. Glenk pointed out in 2017 the welfare threats therapy
dogs encounter during interventions as possible indicators of the animal’s work-related
stress [6]. However, reducing stress is a form of negative reinforcement, while positive
reinforcement might be more rewarding for animals and contribute to their feelings of
wellbeing [34]. Researchers should be cautious, because sometimes it is difﬁcult to measure
whether physiological responses such as ﬂuctuations in cortisol come from negative stress
or positive excitement [35].

Gentle human–animal interactions can induce positive emotions in cattle and enhance
their welfare [36]. Additionally, some, but not many, animals act spontaneously to help
humans, trusting in their ability to read human’s gestures [37]. In horses, the Equine
Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) has been proven to be valid and useful, except for the
part relating to gregariousness in the questionnaire [38]. In short, many animals are quickly
satisﬁed; some help spontaneously, while others have a helping character. However,
assessing positive emotions and motivation in animals and their willingness to repeat
behavior remains difﬁcult.

One conclusion in an exploratory study is that cats’ and dogs’ emotions are difﬁcult to
determine, and that a complete image can only result from studying their full body and
body movements in a certain context [5]. This supports the need for ﬁeld studies when

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

4 of 15

animals are ‘in action’ and leads us to the following dilemma. What do animals do when
they are in action and how do they experience that? It is difﬁcult to determine to what
extent the question of ‘how do horses feel’ (and other animals, sic) can be answered [39].
The ﬁrst question that arises is ‘what role do animals play in AAS?’ Are they volunteers
who can refuse a task, or should they be considered as professional employees, especially
employed for care tasks? However, whatever role the animal fulﬁlls, it is especially pleasant
for all parties if the animal is motivated and enjoys its task. This not only concerns welfare
factors such as freedom from hunger and thirst, discomfort, pain and fear, and room
for normal behavior (Farm Animal Welfare Committee 2009), but also joy, excitement,
eagerness to perform, and enthusiasm, including the right to ﬂourish. Social, physiologic
beneﬁts and behavioral beneﬁts also count [4]. In the future this might become part of
the civil rights of animals, the right on freedom, family reunion, liberty and equality and
freedom of choices like the American nonhumanrights.org is striving for.

In the following paragraphs we draw a parallel between volunteering and professional
work for humans and animals, to raise questions and stimulate discussions about the role
animals play in AAS, which may lead to job descriptions and formal working conditions.
Furthermore, we press the need for positive interventions during working life of the therapy
animal and ask for awareness of the consequences this will have for the retired animal.
Finally, scientiﬁc research into the motivation of working animals, which might be reﬂected
by dopamine levels, is needed to assess whether animals are motivated to assist in AAS.

4. Volunteers
4.1. Animal Volunteers Compared to Human Volunteers

Animals are often called volunteers in AAS, suggesting that they work with pleasure
and voluntarily join an intervention. Is that comparable to human volunteering? According
to the International Labour Organization (ILO) the deﬁnition for volunteering by people is
work that someone does unpaid and non-compulsory, for others or for society for at least
one hour in a four week or one month reference period. The labor is not proﬁt driven, and
does not replace professionals [40].

That might be an excellent label for animals in health care. They provide a contribution
without being monetarily paid for but cannot be obliged to do so. The question of how
to assess animals’ feelings about having or not having obligations arises. The search for
examples in scientiﬁc research for “animal volunteers in AAS” did not show one result,
contrary to human volunteers working with animals in AAS/AAI. Nevertheless, many
handlers active in AAS state their animals always work voluntarily, as a synonym for
‘working with pleasure’. However, therapy animals have not agreed to work based on
informed consent in contrast to the humans involved [21]. They need to deal with the
client they did not choose. Some animals are incorporated in AAS without any training or
selection criteria, but just for the reason being there, like shelter animals [41].

Many domesticated animals naturally have a curious nature and respond positively
to attention. That does not mean that they want to participate in all activities, which each
animal demonstrates in a different way or not at all. Unlike stress, motivation demonstrated
by body language is not always clear. Moreover, many animal owners and experts appear
to have an inconsistent way of assessing their animal’s behavior, they often disagree [42].
There are some questions to be answered before stating that the animal involved
in AAS is working on a voluntary basis. When considering the animal as a volunteer,
are we sure that the animals have chosen to be a volunteer? An animal that turns away
from a situation can have various reasons for walking away. Not interested, no added
value (sweets), motivation to graze, too many people et cetera. If we assume that he—as a
volunteer—can always walk away, we might exclude him involuntarily from the situation.
Some animals can see this exclusion as punishment or negative reinforcement.

If we have determined that the animal is voluntarily present in the setting, do we
expect anything from him? Or is his presence enough and he decides whether he stays or

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

5 of 15

leaves the context and thus ends the session when leaving? Do we accept this as is where is
or do we try to inﬂuence his behavior?

Human volunteering is unpaid, non-compulsory, but not without obligation. Agree-
ments are made, which the parties must adhere to. This applies to working hours, remuner-
ation, support, group activities with other volunteers, training cetera. On the other hand,
the volunteer work can be terminated by the volunteer at any time. Does that also apply
to the animals? Additionally, how can we be sure that the animal no longer wants to be
involved? Studies on motivation are needed to judge the animal’s willingness to cooperate.

4.2. Animal Rights in Voluntary Work

Human volunteers can stop at any time and can easily make that clear with a written or
spoken message. Animals do not have these possibilities. If we regard them as volunteers,
how can we assess that they do not feel like it (anymore) including the reason for their
restraint? Is the work not satisfying enough? Is it too heavy, too long, too often? Handlers
need to be able to read the body language well to understand when the—usually service
minded by training—animal really does not want to work anymore. Additionally, perhaps
even earlier.

Animal emotions are hard to deﬁne and can be explained in different ways. They
can be studied in terms of mood and affect, behavior or physiological components [33].
Additionally, there might be more to welfare. Additionally, context could be an important
inﬂuence on animal welfare. Furthermore, interspeciﬁc relationships determine the result
of interventions, which directly inﬂuences the welfare of the animal [22]. In this paper
and the following research we study motivation as an indicator of welfare, a not well
documented emotion in therapy-assisting animals.

The discussion of animal rights in voluntary work in AAS can become part of the
debate about animal rights in general, where legal rights, and the (in)ability of animals to
make their own choices are issues to consider for the future [43].

4.3. Beneﬁts from Voluntary Work

Do the animals beneﬁt from volunteering? Therapy sessions can be very emotional,
but also cheerful and enjoyable. In addition, it is possible, at least in humans, that positive
and negative emotions co-occur during stressful periods [44]. It is not difﬁcult for handlers
to estimate whether therapy sessions are stressful, but to what extent. Even experienced
handlers can be unreliable observers [42]. Stress is not always recognized in body language
as opposed to positive emotions that are clearer to observe. Especially in stoic animals,
such as donkeys, negative emotions are difﬁcult to score [26]. There is a need for practical
solutions to score animal emotions objectively to balance the subjective human observations.
This also counts for the professional work that will be discussed later in this paper.

Therapists can try to make therapy sessions more attractive to the animals involved
and focus at evoking positive emotions in humans and animals instead of trying to reduce
stress. Frans de Waal points out in his book Mama’s last hug: give the animals something
positive to do and you will see that they cooperate voluntarily [45]. This can also apply to
AAS. Rewarding the animal for the work carried out might inﬂuence his motivation and
ensure his participation the next day.

Little is yet known about the impact of human emotions on the animal, and if the
animal is really conscious of other species’ emotions when crying, shouting, running,
or freezing.

4.4. Negative Impacts from Voluntary Work

Animals are allowed to refrain from a session, which is potentially damaging to the
human client. A booked group session suddenly stops because the animal leaves the
context. If the animal is a volunteer, he can. Many handlers in therapies and treatment
even see the added value of this: turning away also is a message and the client is invited to
ﬁnd a way to deal with it. However, some animals also walk away when they do not want

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

6 of 15

to be involved anymore or return to their natural behavior. Especially for young human
adolescents with low self-esteem this can cause damage; they can see it as a rejection by the
loved animal. It takes a highly skilled therapist to reverse this conclusion. Would not it be
better for the therapist to motivate the animal and keep it in the process?

Although leaving the context is mostly not possible, in a fenced or closed environment
there never is a real escape, it is important for the handler and therapist to come close to
the reason for this behavior. Finally, another important question remains: Can an animal
refuse a client?

Human volunteers do not retire; they just quit and there are no obligations left for
the employer. That could meet sincere protest in the world of AAS; handlers and owners
remain responsible for welfare of the animal until death.

5. Professionals
5.1. Animal Professionals Compared to Human Professionals

In the human world a professional is someone with special skills, which is mainly
characterized by craftsmanship, knowledge and strong competencies. This often refers
to people who function at a higher level than volunteers. They have years of experience,
a lot of education and training and excel in their work. Can we approach animals as an
professional employee? What selection procedure do we use, on what arguments can we
state that the animal is motivated, can we test its willingness to work? This requires a
different approach than to volunteer work, which is not subject to highly speciﬁc training
and experience requirements. It is not to be forgotten that a certain degree of voluntariness
also applies to a professional. He can also quit his job.

If we confront the therapy animal with complex care questions, clients with strong
emotions or aggression, how do we protect the animal from this? Horses can smell emotions
in humans by odors of fear and happiness [46] and might react correspondingly. Working
with people with Alzheimer and dementia has been proven beneﬁcial for patients, but the
dogs included were not in very close contact with the patients. Their role was playing with
a ball and listening to commands, in a joyful setting and not too long [47].

Since the human therapist remains the director of the process, alone or together with
a separate handler, he should monitor and manage the emotional strain that can be put
on the animal. His therapeutic background determines the protocols and activities in
which the animal is incorporated. In settings with complex care and frequent emotional
outbursts an animal with a strong personality is needed, which is stoic and remains calm in
all circumstances. Temperament tests are needed to qualify the capability of the animals,
like for donkeys which seem ideal therapy animals but also can demonstrate unwanted
traits [48]. Still, passing a test, does not necessarily mean the therapy-assisting animal
enjoys his task. Like assistance dogs, which are highly trained to support the physically
handicapped client, a therapy animal integrated in complex mental health care might
also beneﬁt from a training after a thorough selection. For horses, the selection procedure
of mounted police horses might be helpful, also a stressful animal job, but even this
procedure cannot avoid that human selection of a suitable horse is mostly based on intuition
and sometimes proven wrong [49]. Additionally, this study shows, experience makes
the difference.

Job descriptions with explicit criteria and competencies might be helpful in the se-
lection process of professional therapy-assisting animals. MacNamara et al. point at the
importance of the context when evaluating the appropriateness of an animal for animal as-
sisting therapies and promotes the need for adequate selection procedures. Moreover, prior
to assessing aptitude or skills the expected outcomes should be deﬁned, as well as how the
role of the involved animal is deﬁned [50]. Job descriptions and hence the job requirements
and training demands can differ between professional animals and volunteering animals.
Here, we can observe the thin line between obedience and desirable behavior, compared to
intrinsic motivation and desirable behavior.

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

5.2. Compensation

The animal employed in this heavier work, the more complex health care, deserves a
compensation, a salary or renumeration. What should such compensation consist of? In
addition to good housing, sufﬁcient and high-quality food, socializing with conspeciﬁcs,
the animal is entitled to compensation for the work it provides.

In this realm, the work of Charlotte Blattner and co-authors on animal labor is in-
teresting [51]. They bring up essential questions such as: Do we regard animals as our
co-workers and are they entitled to equal rights and compensations? Should we aim at
a collective labor agreement for the animals working alongside humans? What should
compensation consist of? Can we assess the animals’ consent in labor?

Beyond the need for compensation through positive interventions, such as mindful-
ness, play therapy or positive reinforcement training exercises, we suggest involving the
client in the reimbursement. The therapy-assisting animal may receive a clear message
from the client that he has done his job well. Even in case of emotional and aggressive
expressions by the human client, a session should be concluded with a reward for the
therapy-assisting animal. A reward might be in increasing oxytocin levels (e.g., brushing),
or a dopamine stimulating reward (treat or exclusive attention). The client will beneﬁt
as well, since it can feel good to do good because it activates the mesolimbic dopamine
system [52].

5.3. Secondary Beneﬁts

In addition to salary, a good professional also earns training and education, breaks/rest
and vacation, a health plan and sick leave with continued payment. For human profession-
als this is normal in the Western society. An animal active in complex health care should
be adequately rewarded to assure its willingness to work, which is not easy. Another
question is if reducing social contact with people is the best way for animals to rest. Most
therapy-assisting animals love contact with people and become lonely when they no longer
see them. In addition, old learned good habits can be forgotten. It can be counterproductive
if they receive too many breaks, rest and holidays [53].

5.4. The Right or the Duty to Retire?

Many handlers of therapy animals will agree that these animals have a right to rest
after a working life. This demands a solid deﬁnition of the word ‘rest’ or ‘retirement’.
Living with conspeciﬁcs in an environment such as a natural habitat, with reduced contact
to people is probably not the proper deﬁnition for rest after work life. Furthermore, it is
difﬁcult to determine the age of retirement, taking into consideration the variation in life
expectancy of the various animal species. The intensity of the work can also be decisive;
assistance dogs often work 24 h a day, while therapy horses, donkeys and dogs often have
a certain work rhythm of commitment and breaks [53].

If the therapist has been successful in integrating animals into interventions which are
pleasurable to the animal, the animal may miss those conditions. It has become accustomed
to the rhythm, social interaction with people and pleasant interventions [53].

If the therapist wants to continue his activities with a younger animal, the operating
costs of the therapist or handler go up. The older, retired animal remains part of the
herd or group and deserves care. This care consists not only of food, supplements and
medicines, but also of housing and room for exercise. In larger organizations, this can have
an impact on the stafﬁng need to take care of the animals. Given the rising popularity of
therapy-assisting animals, we need to prepare for aging animals and its consequences.

Therapists and handlers should ask themselves if they are doing the animal a favor
with, an inactive, but quiet life or an activity program for seniors. Retirement comes
with liabilities.

We also need to consider the retirement of the handler/therapist or another reason to
quit work. What happens to the animals? Some animals have a high life expectancy, e.g., a
(therapy) donkey can live up to 40 years and some even more.

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

5.5. Do They Enjoy Their Job?

Re-examining the animal/human partnership from the animal’s viewpoint is a pre-
requisite to imagine what the beneﬁts might be for the animal. Raising, training, and use
of therapy and assistance animals is sometimes causing signiﬁcant degradation in their
welfare [3]. A human professional chooses a job he presumably likes and not the job that
causes the least stress. Handlers and therapists working with animals need to address the
motivation of the animal involved. However, biomarkers for motivation, such as dopamine,
have not been studied in dept in the diverse sectors of AAS.

Human jobs can be stressful but very meaningful at the same time. A human oncologist
will most certainly have a stressful job but can also enjoy his work. It is—in most cases—a
personal choice, and not decided upon by a third party who feels he has the adequate
character for it. Let us extend this comparison for a moment. What makes the work
attractive to an oncologist can be the variation in his work—that stress is interspersed with
fascinating, successful and instructive moments, that his discipline develops, that he has a
good relationship with his clients who are grateful for his care and personal interest. If the
relationship between therapy-assisting animal, therapist and client is seen as a cooperation,
as a collaboration on the way to the best result, in which the animal is also rewarded for
his efforts and is integrated in interventions that are not too mentally disturbing, there is a
reasonable chance that the animal will enjoy his ‘work’. His job must be safe and without
physical strain. To evaluate the animals emotions during its activities we need studies
on conscious feelings as one component of emotional states and the neural correlates of
consciousness and all the methodological challenges that go with it [54]. For other biologists
in studying the behavior of animals, even without neurological data there is already proof
of emotions [45].

5.6. Dismissal

If an animal is not suitable, there should be a follow-up plan to safeguard it’s future.
Does the animal have the right to stay in the group or does it have to leave? Is it succeeded
by another animal, forcing the handler to maintain two animals? What facilities are there
for the therapy-assisting animal, after retirement of its owner or itself? Can the retired
professional therapy animal still join therapy sessions as a volunteer? These questions have
not yet been answered thoroughly by the sector but are already highlighted by Ng and
Fine in their considerations on retirement of therapy dogs [53].

6. A New Challenge: The Non-Invasive Neuroscientiﬁc Approach

In the world of AAS, there is little insight into the effectiveness of working mechanisms,
although several theories exist. A lot of attention is paid to behavior as a result of suspected
stimuli, both in humans and animals [21]. When looking at behavior, many factors play a
role. Inspired by the book ‘Behave’ by Robert Sapolsky, we can depict behavior as a result
of an evolutionary history [52].

Human behavior is the sum of evolutionary development, from development to the
upright human being, the history of thousands of years through the hunter/gatherer living
to today’s technical society, the fertilization by which a person receives his genetic package
from two parents, the period of pregnancy and birth, the childhood that follows and
adolescence where the prefrontal cortex is not yet developed, the memory of events, the
hormones that circulate until ﬁnally the last step, the neurotransmitters determine what
behavior can be seen. Behavior is a sum of history and biology shows that this is also
applicable to animals [52].

If we regard neuroscience as an explanatory discipline for animal behavior during
interventions with humans, a problem immediately arises; neuroscientiﬁc data relating
to animal neurotransmission are mainly derived from experiments in laboratories with
captive laboratory animals and human subjects linked to neuroimaging devices. Testing
neurotransmission is often performed on rodents linked to an electrode. Many of these
studies cause long term stress to the animals involved [55], and the animals need special

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

9 of 15

training to enter a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine [56]. Human
subjects though, cooperate voluntarily based on informed consent and agree to be linked
to an fMRI to monitor brain activity. However, not only is free movement a necessity to
reﬂect the outcome of certain internal cognitive processes in animals, it is also a fascinating
ﬁeld of research since certain crucial behavioral patterns can only be observed and studied
during free movement [57].

Funding institutions in the ﬁeld of AAS often demand non-invasive research methods.
If we want to know what humans and animals think and feel during an intervention in the
natural environment, real-time neurological data are needed from freely moving human
subjects and animals. Heavy equipment can intrude an intervention and muscular activity
can cause alteration of, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG) imaging. Furthermore, it requires
anesthesia to implant electrodes in animals which is only possible in clinical settings [58].
Especially when it concerns large animals, such as horses and donkeys, it is difﬁcult to avoid
the inﬂuence of lab equipment attached to the body on behavior. Animals integrated in
AAS are mostly freely moving and not used to the equipment attached to them. Moreover,
some interventions, such as paddock exercises, training of dogs by inmates, or open-air
mindfulness exercises are not possible at all in lab conditions. However, this also limits
robust research results since, unlike in laboratories, the protocols in AAS vary widely [59].
Nevertheless, discussions, studies and research on animal welfare should exclude invasive
research as it is opposite to welfare.

In recent years, it has become increasingly possible to perform non-invasive measure-
ments of biomarkers, such as cortisol levels in hair and saliva and oxytocine in urine, which
are thought to explain behavior. Cousillas et al. developed a wearable EEG recorder for
freely moving horses which was tested on grazing horses in the meadow [58]. With this de-
vice Stomp et al. showed that individual EEG proﬁles in horses are associated with different
welfare scores and that horses in a good welfare state produce fewer gamma waves in the
right hemisphere [60]. Additionally, d’Ingeo et al. performed a study on brain activity in
horses and concluded that associating brain and behavior analysis, clearly demonstrate that
horses’ representation of human voices is modulated by the valence of prior horse-human
interactions. Horses seem to recognize and interpret human voices [61,62].

The above-mentioned studies were performed on freely moving animals. Studying
real-time welfare states in animals during AAS is becoming more and more possible by
technical solutions.

While the in vivo detection of neurotransmission within the lab is developing
rapidly [63], real-time monitoring of neurotransmission is much more difﬁcult outside the
lab. However, it is neurotransmitters that determine the real-time behavior. The impact
of hormones is slower and is inﬂuenced by brain activity, e.g., the reduction in impulses
driven by the amygdala by the prefrontal cortex [64].

In 2000, Odendaal et al. published a study on various neurotransmitters and hormones
in blood plasma, a study that nowadays would encounter ethical objections. In their
research, oxytocin emerged as the most signiﬁcant increased hormone, lasting until after
the intervention, the hormone associated with social bonding and feelings. Dopamine,
ß-endorphin, oxytocin, prolactin, phenylacetic also showed signiﬁcant increase but only
measured close to the intervention moment. According to the authors this study shows
that the animals and the humans are experiencing the same physiological effects [65].

Taking this as a premise, a new insight might offer some new information. Neurotrans-
mitters and their breakdown components seem to leave the central nervous system at night,
so the moment of measurement might inﬂuence ﬁndings. Neurotransmitters are broken
down in different molecules by enzymes and leave the brain through the glymphatic sys-
tem, a macroscopic waste clearance system from the central nervous system that functions
mainly during sleep [66]. This suggests that the most relevant moment for measuring
neurochemicals would than be a day after the intervention, while the hormone cortisol can
already be detected up to 10 min (not longer) after an intervention in saliva [67]. Studies

are needed for the validation of the theory that neurotransmitters can best be tested the
morning after an intervention.

7. Stress Reduction Versus Motivation Increase

This overview is by no means a plea to refrain from integrating animals in care.
However, it does advocate the introduction of interventions that are as pleasant as possible
for the animal, whether it is integrated as a volunteer or as a professional. Pleasure is often
key in reward and motivation, for which dopamine is an interesting biomarker. A dog that
goes out for a walk often considers this as a great reward, and at the same time it can be
part of an intervention: an intervention that does not cause the animal stress. Moreover,
the intervention—the walk, regardless of the conversation that the therapist is having—ﬁts
in with its natural behavior.

Assistance dogs help with opening doors, using washing machines and picking up
mail. They do not perform natural behavior; it is trained. These dogs are often trained in
a reward-oriented manner and therefore continue to repeat the desired behavior. If the
behavior is rewarded alternately, the dog continues to strive for the correct execution of
the wanted behavior and reward. It is the anticipation of the reward that keeps the animal
focused. The “virtual” (anticipated) reward is mediated by dopamine [68].

What if the animal is highly motivated and likes to be near people? What if we just
skip the volunteer position and only work with animals that clearly want to be involved in
therapy? The handler then could manage the animal’s involvement and inﬂuence staying
or leaving. However, force will induce stress.

Focus on the reduction in stress is not the way; we need to improve motivation. If an
animal is often under stress at work, the work is not suitable. However, if we inﬂuence
motivation with better and more enjoyable working conditions, we can expect something
in return.

7.1. The Client’s Position

The therapies in which animals are involved are predominantly complementary thera-
pies and not curative treatment methods. Animals are hardly integrated in the treatment of
life-threatening diseases but rather incorporated to improve the quality of life of a human
client. Although encouraging results have been achieved in people with very low con-
sciousness [69] and people with dementia [70], most interventions are developed for people
who are approachable and can perform actions on request. In these circumstances, the
therapist and/or the handler could invite the client to enter a collaboration with the animal,
working not only on the relaxation of the client but also on that of the animal. Where two
parties enjoy an intervention, the result could be positively intertwined. Possibilities are,
e.g., mindfulness, relaxing techniques, play therapy, and enjoyable training exercises where
both humans and animals experience positive feelings. Therapists could involve clients in
animal-friendly games.

The client can also be encouraged to express his appreciation in an animal-fun way,
such as a small reward, petting, and complimenting. Dogs, in particular, are good at
understanding people’s facial expressions [71], tonal language and body language. More
animals also understand these. Elephants can understand the difference between the
language of harmless tourists (friendly) and the language of the shepherds they must watch
out for (aggressive) and adjust their behavior accordingly [72].

7.2. The Position of the Handlers

As indicated earlier, handlers do not fully agree in reading the body language of their
animals. This makes it difﬁcult to develop guidelines that translate body language into
labels people can understand. A distinction must also be made between stress-induced
body language, neutral body language and positive body language or enthusiasm. In
certain animal species, this is easier than in others; enthusiastic behavior in dogs is easier
for a layman to read than, for example, enthusiasm in alpacas or donkeys.

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

11 of 15

Organizations such as IAHAO and AWIN provide information about signals that
can be interpreted as stress signals or neutral, but no information about enthusiasm or
motivation is provided, while motivation is seen as an indicator of pleasure. Motivation is
recognizable by the will to repeat the behavior to receive a reward, or to repeat an activity
that is experienced as pleasant. Animals can give signals for this [73]. Handlers must be
open to reading these signals and work on their recognizability.

Animals respond to stimulation through their senses, such as the production of oxy-
tocin and dopamine when touched [65]. Oxytocin and dopamine are often released to-
gether [74]. Handlers can use exercises that have been proven to stimulate oxytocin
and dopamine. This means that more research needs to be conducted on the effect
of certain interventions on animals. After all, the effect on humans is already being
extensively investigated.

7.3. The Value of Context-Ethograms

Ethograms often fall short in the interpretation of animal welfare during interventions
because they picture behavior and not emotions. Some animals show similar behavior in
positive and in negative or sick mood (The Equine Pain and Welfare App). A donkey that
stands still with the head down may sleep, be sick or enjoy grooming. It is therefore about
the context and the interaction with the human being, and we would therefore like to argue
here that more research should be conducted on context-ethograms during interventions
based on dopamine ﬁndings. The full context is needed to interpret a certain behavior.

A context-ethogram is not the same as an ethogram of behavior in a context. It is the
interaction with the human that deﬁnes the qualiﬁcation of behavior in an intervention and
not the environment. Does the animal have eye-to-eye contact with the client, is the animal
showing behavior to stimulate the client to repeat a behavior, is the animal approaching
the client for contact, are the ears of the animal directed to the clients voice? Is the animal
moving backwards after clients’ behavior?

Studying context-ethograms during interventions and combining the information

with data on dopamine might result in more reliable conclusions for welfare.

8. Discussion

The involvement of animals in interventions and therapies for human clients is gaining
increasing popularity but has also led to concern about the welfare of the integrated animals.
However, there is no broadly accepted deﬁnition of welfare. In our opinion, the absence
of stress in an animal is not a measure for welfare. Welfare is more visible as joy, or the
eagerness to repeat behavior, a marker of motivation, the drive that humans pushes forward
in their professional life. Until now, little attention has been paid to the motivation of the
therapy animal.

Therefore, we make the following recommendations:

a

b

Label the animal’s integration in interventions in terms of volunteer work or profes-
sional work and describe desired actions in a job description. This will help to qualify
the competencies of the animal.
Describe all primary and secondary beneﬁts, such as renumeration, social plans, and
retirement in the job description. This will ensure the long-term wellbeing of the
therapy-assisting animal.
Create a retirement plan but offer the animal to get involved in voluntary work such
as presence and contact during daytime activities, walks during coaching sessions,
grooming for children, presence during reading comprehension in school classes.
These animals are well socialized, well raised and appreciate being with humans.
d Make the animal’s job, whether voluntary or professional, as enjoyable as possible.

c

e

Mindfulness and play therapy are good examples.
Stimulate neuroscientiﬁc research on the motivation of freely moving animals inte-
grated in AAS, more speciﬁc on the mesolimbic reward pathway of dopamine. This

Animals 2022, 12, 2564

12 of 15

f

will give more insight in the willingness of the animal to be or stay involved, and
might reveal animals that are not motivated, but participate without resistance.
Focus more research on the use of context-ethograms, animal ethograms related to
the interaction with clients. This enables handlers to go beyond their intuition and
score the animal’s behavior more objectively.

The question remains whether we can make interventions as attractive as possible for
all parties, both the volunteers and the professional animals, the handler and the client.
This requires insight and the recognition of positive interaction and positive emotions.

It is extremely difficult for handlers to distinguish between enthusiasm and stoic partici-
pation. Handlers need better tools to assess motivation. Translation of dopamine/motivation
evoking interventions into context-ethograms may be of assistance when in doubt.

Future research on dopamine levels in animals in AAS, whether as volunteers or
professionals, is needed to assess motivation. Based on these ﬁndings, context-ethograms
can be developed for the diverse animals in order to better understand body language
when dopamine is peaking.

9. Conclusions

Motivation is the driving force in successful cooperation between all dyads in AAS.
The only one that is not easily readable is the animal involved, while he is the special
added value to the intervention. Animal-friendly interventions can boost motivation, and
more research on dopamine—the neurotransmitter involved in motivation and reward—is
needed to reveal the difference between stoic cooperation and motivation. Motivation
comes at different levels; a volunteering animal may be motivated to a different level or for
a shorter time than a professional animal, which might go the extra mile.

Handlers and therapists need tools to assess the presence and absence of job-oriented-
motivation and not just read pleasure in the animal. Context-ethograms can show the
motivational body language of the animal in a certain context and should be made available
for diverse handlers and therapists.
