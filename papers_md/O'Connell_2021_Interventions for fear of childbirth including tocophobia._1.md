Background

A B S T R A C T

Many women experience fear of childbirth (FOC). While fears about childbirth may be normal during pregnancy, some women experience
high  to  severe  FOC.  At  the  extreme  end  of  the  fear  spectrum  is  tocophobia,  which  is  considered  a  specific  condition  that  may  cause
distress, affect well-being during pregnancy and impede the transition to parenthood. Various interventions have been trialled, which
support women to reduce and manage high to severe FOC, including tocophobia.

Objectives

To  investigate  the  effectiveness  of  non-pharmacological  interventions  for  reducing  fear  of  childbirth  (FOC)  compared  with  standard
maternity care in pregnant women with high to severe FOC, including tocophobia.

Search methods

In July 2020, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO)
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We contacted researchers of trials which were
registered and appeared to be ongoing.

Selection criteria

We included randomised clinical trials which recruited pregnant women with high or severe FOC (as defined by the individual trial), for
treatment intended to reduce FOC. Two review authors independently screened and selected titles and abstracts for inclusion. We excluded
quasi-randomised and cross-over trials.

Data collection and analysis

We  used  standard  methodological  approaches  as  recommended  by  Cochrane.  Two  review  authors  independently  extracted  data  and
assessed the studies for risk of bias. A third review author checked the data analysis for accuracy. We used GRADE to assess the certainty
of the evidence. The primary outcome was a reduction in FOC. Secondary outcomes were caesarean section, depression, birth preference
for caesarean section or spontaneous vaginal delivery, and epidural use.

Main results

We included seven trials with a total of 1357 participants. The interventions included psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy,
group discussion, peer education and art therapy.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We judged four studies as high or unclear risk of bias in terms of allocation concealment; we judged three studies as high risk in terms
of incomplete outcome data; and in all studies, there was a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. We downgraded the certainty of the
evidence due to concerns about risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. None of the studies reported data about women's anxiety.

Participating in non-pharmacological interventions may reduce levels of fear of childbirth, as measured by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy
Questionnaire (W-DEQ), but the reduction may not be clinically meaningful (mean difference (MD) -7.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.19
to -1.97; 7 studies, 828 women; low-certainty evidence). The W-DEQ tool is scored from 0 to 165 (higher score = greater fear).

Non-pharmacological interventions probably reduce the number of women having a caesarean section (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89; 5
studies, 557 women; moderate-certainty evidence).

There may be little to no difference between non-pharmacological interventions and usual care in depression scores measured with the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (MD 0.09, 95% CI -1.23 to 1.40; 2 studies, 399 women; low-certainty evidence). The EPDS tool
is scored from 0 to 30 (higher score = greater depression).

Non-pharmacological interventions probably lead to fewer women preferring a caesarean section (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; 3 studies,
276 women; moderate-certainty evidence).

Non-pharmacological interventions may increase epidural use compared with usual care, but the 95% CI includes the possibility of a slight
reduction in epidural use (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.48; 2 studies, 380 women; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

The effect of non-pharmacological interventions for women with high to severe fear of childbirth in terms of reducing fear is uncertain. Fear
of childbirth, as measured by W-DEQ, may be reduced but it is not certain if this represents a meaningful clinical reduction of fear. There may
be little or no difference in depression, but there may be a reduction in caesarean section delivery. Future trials should recruit adequate
numbers of women and measure birth satisfaction and anxiety.

Non-pharmacological interventions for fear of childbirth (tocophobia) in pregnancy

Key messages

While non-medicine  treatments may reduce levels of fear for pregnant women with a high to severe fear of childbirth compared to standard
maternity care, the reduction may not represent a meaningful change in their level of fear.Non-medicine treatments probably reduce the
number of women who have a caesarean section, where the baby is born surgically. Future research in this area should focus on measuring
anxiety levels in women with a high or severe fear of childbirth.

What is fear of childbirth?

Fear of childbirth can range from minor worries and anxieties about giving birth, to a severe fear of childbirth that has a considerable impact
on women's lives, causing distress and affecting their mental well-being. A high to severe level of childbirth fear may include extreme levels
of fear also known as ‘tocophobia’.

It is normal for pregnant women – particularly first-time mothers – to be anxious, worried or fearful about giving birth. However, some
women have high fear related to childbirth and a smaller number have a severe fear of childbirth or ‘tocophobia’. These women:

- may have feelings of isolation, guilt and shame;may choose to terminate a healthy pregnancy, hide a pregnancy or be in denial about
a pregnancy;

- may find it difficult to prepare for birth or access pregnancy information because of their fear and may experience problems bonding
with their baby;

- may have sleeplessness, nightmares, stomach aches, depression and anxiety that leads to panic attacks.

Women with a high to severe fear of childbirth are more likely to have a planned or emergency caesarean birth, instrumental birth and
experience physical effects related to fear, such as prolonged labour. Women with high fear of childbirth without a history of depression
are  more likely to experience postnatal depression.

How is fear of childbirth treated?

The causes of fear of childbirth are complex and unique for each woman. High to severe fear of childbirth is not recognised or provided for
in maternity care in many places in the world. Ways of treating fear of childbirth need to be investigated.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Effective treatments would help women to have confidence in their ability to give birth, give them ways of coping with labour, and empower
their decision-making during pregnancy and the birth process.

Treatments aim to provide extra support to women and include:

- sensitive education about the birth process;development of problem-solving skills;

- teaching coping strategies for labour;

- and affirming that negative childbirth events can be managed.

What did we want to find out?

We  wanted  to  find  out  if  non-pharmacological  (non-medicine)  treatments  were  better  than  the  standard  maternity  care  provided  to
pregnant women in terms of:

- reducing women’s level of fear, as measured by a widely-used questionnaire for childbirth fear;

- reducing the number of women having a caesarean birthsection;

- reducing anxiety and depression.

What did we do?

We  searched  for  studies  that  investigated  non-pharmacological  treatments  aimed  at  reducing  fear  of  childbirth.  We  compared  and
summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and number of
participants.

What did we find?

We found seven studies that involved 1357 pregnant women with a high to severe fear of childbirth including tocophobia. The studies
investigated different types of treatment, including:

- psychoeducation (a structured form of education offered to people with mental health conditions);

- cognitive behavioural therapy (a ‘talking therapy’ that aims to help identify and change underlying thought patterns);

- group discussion;peer teaching from other pregnant women;

- and art therapy.

The studies were conducted in five different countries (Australia, Iran, Sweden, Finland and Turkey).

We found that non-pharmacological treatments:

- may reduce fear of childbirth when measured by a widely-used questionnaire, though the reduction may not represent a meaningful
change in women's level of fear.

- probably reduce the number of women who go on to have caesarean births (28% of women receiving non-drug treatments had caesarean
sections, compared to 40% of women not receiving treatment for fear of childbirth).

- may make little to no difference compared to standard maternity care in terms of women’s depression scores.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Our confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies were done in such a way that their results may be inaccurate, and because
there were low numbers of women in the studies.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence in this review is up to date to July 2020.

In  order  to  be  inclusive  we  have  used  neutral  or  gender  neutral
terms  to  include  all  people  who  experience  pregnancy  and  birth
and  avoid  gendering  the  issue  since  fear  of  childbirth  may  affect
transgender people.

Description of the condition

Introduction

The  childbirth  experience  is  described  as  a  profound  landmark
and  is  a  life-affirming  event  for  many  women  (Larkin  2009).
However,  women  experience  many  different  emotions  during
pregnancy,  from  happiness  and  joy,  to  anxiety,  fear  and  horror.
Therefore,  the  experience  of  pregnancy  and  birth  is  individual,
subjective,  complex  and  multidimensional  (Larkin  2009).  It  is
common for pregnant women - particularly first-time mothers - to
experience anxiety, worry or fear with varying severity in relation
to  childbirth  (Melender  2002;  Nilsson  2018;  Salomonsson  2010;
Zar  2001).  Women  are  three  times  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed
with  an  anxiety  disorder  than  depression  in  the  postnatal  period
(Fairbrother 2007). Yet research on anxiety in the perinatal period
has  lacked  attention  to  date,  in  comparison  with  the  focus  on
perinatal  depression  (Hofberg  2003;  Howard  2014).  There  is  a
growing  body  of  literature  which  recognises  the  importance  of
identifying fear of childbirth (FOC) and pregnancy-related anxieties
in  maintaining  women's  perinatal  mental  health  (Hofberg  2003;
Stoll 2018; Toohill 2014; Weaver 2013). There is cumulative evidence
that  FOC  predisposes  women  to  postnatal  depression  (Alipour
2012;  Räisänen  2014),  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)
(Ayers  2016).  In  addition,  various  epidemiological  studies  and
Cochrane Reviews have identified the significance of recognising -
in  the  antenatal  period  -  the  psychological  and  psychosocial  risk
factors for postnatal depression (Alipour 2012; Ayers 2016; Dennis
2013; Dennis 2017; Räisänen 2014; Stoll 2018).

For  some  women,  FOC  is  so  severe  that  it  affects  their  daily
lives,  and  spoils  their  experience  of  pregnancy  (Salomonsson
2010).  Feelings  of  isolation,  guilt  and  shame,  due  to  perceived
stigma,  have  been  reported  by  women  with  high  to  severe  FOC,
since  pregnancy  is  generally  seen  as  a  time  of  happiness  and
women  may  feel  unable  to  talk  about  their  fears  with  their
partners  or  midwives  (Eriksson  2006;  Lyberg  2010;  Nilsson  2009).
Moreover,  high  to  severe  FOC  can  negatively  impact  partner
relationships  (Salomonsson  2010),  which  is  important  as  low
levels of social support and partner dissatisfaction are significantly
associated with FOC (Gao 2015; Salomonsson 2010; Toohill 2014).
There  is  evidence  that  information  provided  to  women  in  the
clinical  setting  may  have  a  positive  or  negative  influence  on  FOC
(Salomonsson 2010).  In extreme cases, women may use scrupulous
methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy, experience psycho-
sexual  difficulty,  choose  to  terminate  a  healthy  pregnancy,  or
conceal  or  be  in  denial  about  pregnancy  (Gutteridge  2013).  In
the  latter  case,  women  refuse  scans  and  demonstrate  avoidance
behaviours  by  mentally  blocking  out  feelings  of  being  pregnant
such as fetal movement (Gutteridge 2013). Moreover, physical and
psychological effects such as sleeplessness, nightmares, stomach
aches,  depression  and  anxiety  leading  to  panic  attacks  have
been  reported  (Hall  2009;  Laursen  2008;  Räisänen  2014;  Zar
2001).  Women  who  are  in  denial  about  pregnancy  may  avoid
birth  preparation  classes  (Salomonsson  2010),  and  as  a  result,
experience low self-efficacy in the ability to give birth (Lowe 2000).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Furthermore, it is well-established that women with high to severe
FOC  are  more  likely  to  have  a  caesarean  birth  (both  emergency
and due to maternal request), and experience physiological effects
related to fear, such as prolonged labour (Adams 2012; Haines 2012;
Karlström  2009;  O'Donovan  2018;  Räisänen  2014;  Ryding  2015;
Saisto 2001; Weaver 2013).

Women  may  have  different  attitudes  towards  or  cultural  beliefs
about  childbirth,  which  can  influence  how  they  experience  the
birth  process  (Gutteridge  2013;  Haines  2012).  The  culture  of
birth can influence these attitudes and beliefs. For example, risk-
averse medical models tend to influence women's decisions about
interventions during childbirth, and whether women take an active
or  passive  role  during  childbirth  (Haines  2012).  In  general,  a
cultural shift in women's attitudes towards birth has been noted,
corresponding  with  the  increased  use  of  medical  interventions,
such  as  induction  of  labour  and  epidural  use,  leading  to  women
losing  confidence  in  their  ability  to  give  birth  and  to  cope  with
labour pain (Green 2003; Haines 2012). There has also been a shift
in women's expectations of birth (Darvill 2010).

In  theory,  maternity  care  aims  to  place  women  at  the  centre
of  decision-making  about  their  care.  However,  in  actual  clinical
practice,  it  seems  evident  that  the  terms  'woman-centred  care'
and  'informed  choice'  are  often  simply  rhetoric  (Haines  2012).
There  has  been  a  growing  trend  of  neglectful,  disrespectful  or
abusive  behaviour  in  some  contexts  and  settings,  which  has
lacked  attention  from  healthcare  professions,  but  which  has
affected  women  (Bohren  2014;  Freedman  2014).  Examples  of  the
mistreatment  of  women  globally  include  physical  abuse,  such
as  slapping  or  pinching,  sexual  abuse,  verbal  abuse,  stigma,
neglect during the birth, poor or ineffective communication, loss
of autonomy and inadequately resourced health systems which fail
to  provide  women  with  privacy  and  dignity  during  birth  (Bohren
2014). The attitudes of healthcare professionals, such as midwives
and  obstetricians,  play  a  significant  role  in  women's  perceptions
of  risk  and  their  consequent  fear.  In  one  study,  31%  of  female
obstetricians  in  London,  United  Kingdom  (UK),  indicated  a  birth
preference for caesarean sections (CS) for their own births (Al Mufti
1997),  which  suggests  that  there  may  be  a  personal  bias  or  an
influence  when  presenting  information  to  women  (Dahlen  2010).
Aiming  to  provide  pregnant  women  with  a  trusting  relationship
could  help  reduce  fear  (Dahlen  2010;  Hildingsson  2018;  Lyberg
2010).

Social  norms  and  the  emotional  experiences  of  women,  such
as  perceptions  about  lack  of  control  and  safety,  could  influence
women's  decision  to  request  a  caesarean  section,  according  to  a
qualitative systematic review (O'Donovan 2018). In some cultures,
caesarean  section  is  now  perceived  as  'normal'  and  as  a  mark
of empowerment and social status in a consumerist world (Faisal
2014;  Fenwick  2010).  This  shift  in  cultural  beliefs  is  deep-rooted
and ultimately underpinned by fear (O'Donovan 2018). Qualitative
evidence suggests that FOC may be transmitted from generation to
generation through vicarious experiences of family members who
had difficult labours or negative births, leading to the perception of
caesarean section as a 'safer' option (Hull 2011; O'Donovan 2018).

Various  studies  have  investigated  the  causes  and  consequences
of  high  to  severe  FOC.  Typical  sources  of  fear  include  (but  are
not limited to): fear of the unknown, fear of pain, fear of perineal
trauma,  feeling  lack  of  involvement  in  decision-making  during
birth,  being  left  alone  in  labour,  fear  for  the  infant's  health  or

own health or death (Fenwick 2015; O'Donovan 2018; Salomonsson
2010).  FOC  is  strongly  associated  with  intimate  partner  violence,
sexual  abuse,  rape  and  unintended  pregnancy  (Gutteridge  2013;
Miller  2010).  A  large  epidemiological  study  reported  that  women
with  high  to  severe  FOC  were  more  likely  to  have  had  anaemia,
miscarriages, a previous early termination of pregnancy, assisted
reproductive  procedures,  or  chorionic  villus  sampling  (a  test
which may  be  offered  during  pregnancy  to  check  if  the  baby  has
a  genetic  or  chromosomal  condition)  (Räisänen  2014).  A  large
Australian study (n = 510,006) which looked at all singleton births
in  New  South  Wales  in  2000  to  2008  found  that  women  who
experienced severe perineal trauma during their first birth were less
likely to have a subsequent baby (Priddis 2013).

Defining high to severe FOC

FOC exists on a spectrum from low fear to high and phobic fear, but
it is difficult to assess when fear of childbirth becomes 'tocophobia'.
Typically, a phobia is characterised by avoidance behaviours. From
a psychiatric perspective, a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM
5  (SCID-5)  may  be  performed  to  assess  women.  However,  there
is  a  dearth  of  perinatal  psychiatrists  and  such  interviews  are  not
common practice in maternity care (Brockington 2017; Nath 2018).
When  a  psychiatric  assessment  is  performed,  women  with  FOC
will  usually  receive  a  diagnosis  of  generalised  anxiety  disorder;
thus,  high  to  severe  FOC  comes  under  the  umbrella  of  anxiety
disorders (Stoll 2018; Striebich 2018). In Scandinavia, FOC has been
categorised  in  the  International  Classification  of  Diseases,  10th
revision  (ICD-10;  World  Health  Organization  2018).  However,  FOC
has not specifically been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Edition  (DSM-5;  Americian
Psychiatric  Association  2013).  Unlike  most  phobias,  which  are
irrational,  high  to  severe  FOC  is  usually  not  a  pathological  fear,
but a situational fear which is personal to the individual. The most
common definition of tocophobia is a self-reported Wijma Delivery
Expectancy Questionnaire version A (W-DEQ A) score greater than
or equal to 85 (O'Connell 2017; Wijma 1998). Further details of the
tool are outlined below.

Tools for measuring FOC

FOC can be assessed using a range of self-reported questionnaires
or diagnostic interviews (Lowe 2000; O'Connell 2017; Rouhe 2011;
Stoll  2018;  Striebich  2018;  Wijma  1998).  The  most  common  tool
used  to  assess  severity  of  FOC  is  the  W-DEQ  A  in  the  antenatal
period,  with  the  W-DEQ  B  used  to  assess  childbirth  fear  in  the
postnatal  period,  which  can  help  determine  when  women  may
benefit  from  treatment  (Wijma  1998).  The  tool  was  developed
originally in Sweden by Klaas Wijma, and psychometric analysis has
shown  it  to  be  valid  and  reliable  for  women  of  all  parity  (Wijma
1998). The questionnaire consists of 33 questions on a Likert scale
(zero  to  six)  that  aim  to  evaluate  women's  cognitive  appraisal  of
the  upcoming  birth  in  the  antenatal  period,  and  evaluate  their
experiences after birth in the postnatal period (Wijma 1998). Wijma
himself recommended using cut-offs of greater than or equal to 85
to define severe FOC and tocophobia and greater than or equal to
66 to represent high fear (Wijma 1998). However, various other cut-
offs have been used in research studies (W-DEQ A ≥ 71, W-DEQ A ≥
86, W-DEQ A ≥ 100) (Nilsson 2018; O'Connell 2017; Wijma 1998).

Epidemiology of FOC

FOC  exists  on  a  spectrum,  from  minor  worries  and  anxieties,  to
moderate  FOC  which  does  not  impact  women's  everyday  life,  to

high  and  severe  FOC,  and  tocophobia,  which  has  a  considerable
impact on women's lives and affects their psychological well-being
(Areskog 1981; Larsson 2017; Nilsson 2018; O'Connell 2017).

A multidisciplinary approach encompassing a holistic package of
care  may  be  beneficial  to  provide  emotional  support  for  women
with  FOC  (Jomeen  2021).  The  majority  of  people  with  moderate
FOC  may  be  managed  by  midwifery  counselling,  education,
discussing  the  birth  and  continuity  of  care  (Jomeen  2021).
Tocophobia  may  be  treated  by  specific,  targetted  interventions
like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or exposure therapy (Jomeen
2021; Stoll 2018). To date, tocophobia has been examined from a
psychiatric perspective, rather than by obstetricians or midwives,
and  there  is  a  significant  association  between  previous  sexual
abuse  and  rape  (Gutteridge  2013).  Various  definitions  are  used
for  tocophobia  (O'Connell  2017),  which  is  a  key  challenge  when
estimating  prevalence,  assessing  women  for  high  to  severe  FOC,
designing  interventions,  and  evaluating  outcomes.  It  is  possible
that  there  are  cultural  factors  influencing  this  variation,  as  well
as  the  obvious  limitations  of  self-reported  measures  (O'Connell
2017  Haines  2012).  However,  due  to  increased  interest  in  the
topic,  more  women  are  finding  the  courage  to  speak  about
their experience of tocophobia. Prevalence reports of severe FOC
range  from  3.7%  to  43%  and  a  meta-analysis  estimated  a  global
pooled prevalence of 14% (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.16),
using  a  random-effects  model  (O'Connell  2017).  Furthermore,
approximately  20%  of  women  experience  high  fear  (O'Connell
2017;  Toohill  2014).  The  majority  of  prevalence  studies  have
reported that high to severe FOC is more common in nulliparous
women (who have never given birth to a child), but some studies
have  found  the  opposite  (O'Connell  2017).  In  parous  women,
previous  mode  of  birth  (instrumental  or  emergency  caesarean
section)  is  associated  with  high  FOC  (Rouhe  2011;  Toohill  2014),
and high FOC in one pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for high
FOC  in  a  subsequent  pregnancy  (Storksen  2012).  Ternström  and
colleagues have described high FOC in 'foreign-born women', who
report  feeling  isolated  since  they  lack  the  network  of  family  and
friends to support them and may have specific, sensitive cultural
requirements in maternity care (Ternström 2015; Ternström 2016).
Thus, identifying women with high to severe FOC and interventions
for  high  to  severe  FOC  need  to  be  inclusive  of  vulnerable  groups
such  as  migrant  women,  who  may  be  at  even  higher  risk  of
postnatal  depression  (Ternström  2015).  Given  the  prevalence  of
high to severe FOC, the condition is a key concern for midwives and
obstetricians because of its multi-factorial impact on the mother as
well as her partner and infant.

Management of high to severe FOC

The  majority  of  research  in  this  field  has  been  conducted
where  care  pathways  are  well-established,  but  in  parts  of  the
western  world,  high  to  severe  FOC  is  not  currently  recognised  or
provided for in maternity care (O'Connell 2017). Even in countries
where  high  to  severe  FOC  is  recognised,  approaches  to  care
vary  widely  and  are  not  based  on  empirical  evidence  (Bewley
2002;  Richens  2015).  In  Sweden,  women  with  high  to  severe
FOC  are  referred  for  counselling  with  midwives  in  Aurora  clinics
-  specialty  clinics  introduced  by  midwives  with  an  interest  in
childbirth  fear  that  serve  women  using  a  personalised  approach
(Larsson  2016;  Larsson  2017).  This  involves  an  interdisciplinary
team of midwives, obstetricians, social workers and psychologists,
as  appropriate,  for  each  individual  woman  (Larsson  2016).  The
advent of the clinics was not preceded by a randomised controlled

trial,  and  a  retrospective  evaluation  reported  that  they  did  not
reduce  caesarean  section  rates  (Larsson  2017;  Ryding  2003).
However, women were satisfied with the care and half the women
experienced a reduction in FOC (Larsson 2017; Ryding 2003).

There is a lack of information about current services available to
women  with  high  to  severe  FOC.  A  national  survey  in  Sweden  in
2016 revealed that whilst it is usual for obstetric clinics in Sweden
to provide treatment for women with childbirth fear, disparities in
the treatment offered to women exist in the 43 obstetric clinics in
Sweden that responded to the survey (of a possible 45). Moreover,
the survey findings report variations in the education of midwives
and  time  allocated  to  counselling  women  (Larsson  2016).  Thus,
the researchers called for standardisation of care and the potential
for a national healthcare program for high to severe FOC (Larsson
2016). The results of the availability of services in Sweden were in
contrast to the findings of a UK national survey on availability of
services  for  women  with  FOC  (in  which  128  out  of  202  maternity
units  responded)  (Richens  2015).  Specialist  services  for  women
with  high  to  severe  FOC  were  available  in  just  over  half  of  the
UK maternity units surveyed (Richens 2015). It was reported that
52 maternity units did not offer any specialist support for women
with FOC (Richens 2015). As in Sweden, the standards of available
services varied, and a number of different healthcare professionals
were named as leading the care (Richens 2015). Thus, a summary of
the best available empirical evidence is needed to inform the best
practice to support women with high or severe FOC.

treating  women's  anxiety 

A Cochrane Review of mind-body interventions during pregnancy
for  preventing  or 
investigated
interventions such as autogenic training (a relaxation technique),
biofeedback,  hypnotherapy,  imagery,  meditation,  prayer,  auto-
suggestion,  tai  chi  and  yoga  in  comparison  with  standard  care
(Marc 2011). This review included eight trials with 556 participants
in  total;  thus,  no  meta-analysis  (formal  epidemiological  study
to  systematically  assess  the  results)  was  possible.  The  review
concluded  that  mind-body  interventions,  such  as  autogenic
training, may reduce anxiety in pregnancy, and the use of imagery
during  labour  and  in  the  postnatal  period  may  have  benefits  for
women in labour and in the postnatal period (Marc 2011). Moreover,
there  were  no  harmful  effects  from  any  mind-body  interventions
(Marc  2011).  However,  the  evidence  was  limited  because  of
the  small  number  of  studies  included  and  their  methodological
limitations (such as lack of blinding — where study participants are
prevented  from  knowing  certain  information  that  may  somehow
influence  them  —  thereby  tainting  the  results,  and  lack  of  detail
in relation to the randomisation) (Marc 2011). There has been no
Cochrane Review on interventions for high to severe FOC including
tocophobia to date. There has been much debate about FOC, and
an upsurge in research in the field, but little evidence as to which
interventions are effective, limited understanding of the aetiology
of tocophobia and variation in outcomes measured (Moghaddam
Hosseini  2017;  Smith  2019;  Stoll  2018;  Weaver  2013).  To  date,
much of the research has focused on reducing caesarean section
at maternal request, rather than on reducing fear and evaluating
the  overall  outcome  for  the  woman  (physical,  psychological  and
emotional). Therefore, supporting women with FOC to manage fear
and have a positive transition to motherhood  is an emerging area
of concern for women, obstetricians and midwives.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Description of the intervention

Since  the  reasons  for  high  to  severe  FOC  are  multifactorial  and
different for each individual, ideally, interventions should address
the complex nature of the fear, taking into consideration the social,
physical,  psychological  and  emotional  factors  in  women’s  lives.
There  is  a  need  to  investigate:  (a)  the  severity  of  FOC,  and  the
effect  on  women’s  day-to-day  lives;  (b)  the  aetiology,  cause  or
nature  of  the  fear  (i.e.  lack  of  self-efficacy  in  the  ability  to  birth,
previous  sexual  abuse,  previous  negative  birth  experience,  low
social  support,  fear  of  the  unknown);  (c)  concurrent  symptoms
(i.e. antenatal depression, any other complications of pregnancy);
(d)  parity  and  risk  factors;  (e)  social  factors  (i.e.  social  networks
available,  partner  support,  access  to  treatment);  and  (f)  values
and world views in relation to the available treatment (i.e. culture,
religion, beliefs, expectations of the treatment). Therefore, a range
of  different  antenatal  interventions  will  be  considered  in  this
review, such as group and individual cognitive behavioural therapy
(CBT)  in  person  and  via  the  Internet,  group  psychoeducation  by
midwives, counselling for FOC by midwives, childbirth preparation
classes, yoga, relaxation and mindfulness techniques.

How the intervention might work

Given  that  the  potential  risk  factors  for  high  to  severe  FOC  are
low  social  support,  single  marital  status,  low  maternal  age,  and
co-morbid  depression  or  anxiety  (Räisänen  2014;  Rouhe  2011;
Stoll  2018),  the  importance  of  psychosocial  factors  is  evident  for
women  with  FOC.  Therefore,  interventions  usually  target  these
psychosocial  factors  using  a  combination  of  various  approaches.
These interventions aim to promote not only a reduction in fear but
also a positive birth experience, which could then help to prepare
the mother for a positive transition to motherhood (Airo Toivanen
2018). It has been proposed that providing a sense of security and
safety  is  particularly  important  for  women  with  FOC  throughout
the antenatal period (Airo Toivanen 2018). Other approaches have
focused  on  understanding  the  birth  process  and  awareness  of
the  body  in  general,  in  order  to  prepare  women  emotionally  for
childbirth (Airo Toivanen 2018).

There  is  an  increasing  focus  on  applying  a  salutogenic  model
of  health  to  birth  (meaning  an  approach  that  focuses  on
overall  maternal  health  and  well-being  rather  than  pathology)
(Antonovsky  1987;  Greer  2014).  According  to  this  theory,  the
main  aim  should  be  for  mothers  to  make  a  smooth  transition
to  parenthood  with  their  physical,  psychological  and  emotional
health intact, and have a birth experience which they evaluate as
positive.  Whilst  various  interventions  exist,  how  treatment  works
is  still  unclear.  However,  women  have  seen  benefits  from  non-
pharmacological approaches, such as psychological interventions
(CBT  or  psychoeducation)  which  focus  on  psychological  factors,
and 
interventions  which  focus  on  delivering
education  and  preparing  women  for  the  birth  and  transition  to
motherhood (Nieminen 2015; Toohill 2014). CBT has demonstrated
an  improvement  in  symptoms  of  FOC  in  this  population,  as  well
as  decreased  caesarean  section  on  request  (Larsson  2018;  Saisto
2001).  CBT  is  well-recognised  as  an  effective  treatment  for  a
range of psychological disorders (Andersson 2014; Ghazaie 2016),
but  the  causal  mechanism  of  the  treatment  is  largely  unknown.
A  recent  study  investigating  CBT  for  major  depressive  disorder
and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  suggested  that  the
CBT  mechanism  may  work  by  enhancing  the  cognitive  control
region connectivity (the amygdala and fronto-parietal region of the

brain)  (Shou  2017).  The  study  suggests  that  strengthening  these
connections through CBT may lead to improved control of affective
processes (mood or psychological state) particularly (Shou 2017).
The  findings  of  this  study  are  an  important  development  in
understanding the mechanism of CBT, but may not be generalisable
due  to  the  limitations  of  the  study  (small  sample  size  (n  =
65)  and  a  slight  variation  in  the  therapy  used  in  the  study).

Pain  catastrophising 
"an
exaggerated  negative  mental  set  brought  to  bear  during  painful
experiences"  (Sullivan  2001).  It  has  been  suggested  that  women
with high FOC are prone to catastrophise pain in labour and birth,
leading to more intense perceived pain (Rondung 2016). Therefore,
they may be more likely to utilise epidural analgesia during labour
(Rondung  2016).  In  addition,  previous  research  reported  that
women with high FOC had reduced tolerance of labour pain during
labour  and  after  birth  (Saisto  2001  A).  In  a  study  by  Adams  and
colleagues, women with high FOC were significantly more likely to
request an epidural than women without FOC (Adams 2012). More
recently,  a  study  by  Logtenberg  and  colleagues  also  found  that
women with high FOC were more likely to request pharmacological
pain relief in labour, but the finding was not statistically significant
(Logtenberg 2018).

Some  interventions  have  included  partners,  while  others  have
focused  solely  on  the  mother.  The  prevalence  of  high  to  severe
FOC in partners is similar to the prevalence in pregnant women; for
example, 13% in a Swedish study (n = 329) (Eriksson 2005). Thus,
it is conceivable that partners should be included in interventions.
A small study of 100 women in Sweden in 1997 reported that 22%
of  partners  demanded  a  caesarean  section  (Sjogren  1997).  This
study  also  reported  that  partners  of  women  who  had  previously
experienced a complicated birth were significantly more likely to
be  fearful  (Sjogren  1997).  A  qualitative  study  of  20  Swedish  men
with severe FOC highlighted the need for strategies to identify and
support  fathers  as  well  as  mothers  (Eriksson  2007).  Following  on
from this, a qualitative study of Swedish midwives' perceptions of
FOC  indicates  that  partners  with  FOC  may  give  poor  support  to
labouring women, and the researchers recommend that midwives
should  also  ask  partners  about  FOC  (Salomonsson  2010).  Thus,
interventions which welcome both partners should be considered
in comparison with those that focus solely on the woman.

Why it is important to do this review

Traditionally,  research  in  the  area  of  perinatal  mental  health
focuses  on  depression,  but  anxiety  is  prevalent  (Howard  2014).
Therefore,  more  evidence  is  required  to  address  this  knowledge
gap  with  regard  to  anxiety  and  fear  in  the  perinatal  period.
Moreover, it is increasingly apparent that high to severe FOC may
be  a  predictor  for  maternal  psychological  health  and  well-being
in  the  perinatal  period.  There  is  consistent  evidence  that  high
to  severe  FOC  is  strongly  associated  with  impaired  psychological
well-being during pregnancy (e.g. women are more likely to have
antenatal  depression  (Rouhe  2011)),  and  it  may  be  a  predictor
for  their  postnatal  mental  health  (Howard  2014).  Women  with
high  to  severe  FOC  may  ruminate  or  worry;  sometimes,  what
may  start  out  as  a  little  worry  or  anxiety  in  early  pregnancy  can

become  magnified  and  escalate  to  high  or  severe  FOC  as  birth
becomes more imminent. Severe FOC has been linked to physical
complaints,  such  as  sleep  disturbances  such  as  insomnia  and
nightmares,  to  stomach  aches  and  headaches,  which  may  result
in  increased  visits  to  individuals'  general  practitioner,  midwife  or
hospital. Effective treatment for high to severe FOC may have trans-
generational  effects.  If  untreated,  FOC  may  be  passed  on  from
mother to daughter, where a mother had a traumatic experience
which may be experienced in the imagination by her daughter when
she relives the birth as described to her (Hofberg 2003). Therefore,
supporting  mothers  in  the  perinatal  period  may  have  long-term
benefits for their own health and that of their infant.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

All  published,  unpublished  and  ongoing  randomised  controlled
trials  (RCTs)  and  cluster-randomised  controlled  trials  of  non-
pharmacological interventions in which the primary or secondary
aim is to treat fear of childbirth (FOC) were eligible for inclusion.

We  excluded  quasi-randomised  trials  (e.g.  those  randomised  by
even  versus  odd  medical  record  numbers)  and  cross-over  trials
from the analysis. When studies were published in abstract form,
we listed the study as 'awaiting classification' and contacted study
authors to attempt to retrieve raw data or the full publication of the
study as soon as it was available.

Types of participants

We  included  women  with  high  or  severe  FOC  in  pregnancy,  as
defined in each individual trial.

Diagnosis

We included women who were identified as having FOC, according
to each individual study, with levels of severity varying from high
to severe. This included women with high or severe levels of fear,
using the threshold cut-off on each self-report assessment tool as
designated  by  each  individual  trial  protocol  (i.e.  Wijma  Delivery
Expectancy Questionnaire version A (W-DEQ A) (Wijma 1998), and
women  who  received  a  diagnosis  of  tocophobia  according  to  a
clinical  assessment,  using  a  structured  clinical  interview  by  a
psychologist or psychiatrist.

Setting

We  included  women  from  all  settings  (e.g.  primary  care  setting,
outpatients, home and hospital), who participated in the various
clinical trials.

Co-morbidities

We included women with a co-morbid medical condition if the main
focus  of  the  study  was  high  to  severe  FOC,  rather  than  the  co-
morbid condition (such as depression).

aimed  at  reducing  high  to  severe  levels  of  FOC  in  women.
Non-pharmacological  approaches  consisted  of  psychosocial  and
psychological  interventions  (e.g.  behavioural  and  educational
(e.g.  mind-body
strategies),  physical  exercise 
interventions 
relaxation,  yoga  and
Pilates)  and  therapeutic 
interventions  (e.g.  music  and  art
therapy).  Psychosocial  interventions  included  diverse  supportive
interactions.  Examples  of  psychological  interventions  include
(CBT)  and  psychotherapy.
cognitive  behavioural 
Psychosocial  and  psychological  interventions  may  have  been
delivered in group or individual sessions, face-to-face, by telephone
or  via  the  Internet.  The  intervention  may  have  been  delivered
by  a  trained  professional  (e.g.  psychiatrist,  psychologist,  social
worker,  midwife  or  obstetrician)  or  by  a  trained  lay  person
or  a  trained  therapist  (art  or  music  therapist),  and  may,  or
may  not,  have  included  the  partner  in  the  intervention.  Any
type,  frequency  and  duration  of  intervention  were  considered
in  both  clinical  and  non-clinical  settings.  Two  review  authors
(MOC,  SON)  independently  determined  the  type  of  interventions
as  either  psychosocial,  psychological  or  therapeutic.  In  case  of
disagreement, we consulted a third review author (AK) to reach an
agreement. Sometimes interventions are used in combinations.

Comparison interventions

We included comparisons of intervention groups versus standard
or usual maternity care groups, as defined by the trialists. Standard
or usual care included health care as appropriate during the clinical
trial.

Types of outcome measures

We  examined  a  number  of  outcomes  as  relevant  for  the  mother,
infant and family in this review.

We used time points of measurements as reported in the trials and
assessed the outcome measures at the end of treatment.

Primary outcomes

Fear of childbirth as measured by a validated tool such as the Wijma
Delivery  Expectancy  Questionnaire  version  A  (W-DEQ  A)  (Wijma
1998), or a visual analogue scale (VAS) known as the Fear of Birth
Scale (FOBS) (Rouhe 2011).

Secondary outcomes

• Number of women having a caesarean section.
• Anxiety  (as  measured  on  generally  accepted  scales  (e.g.  State
Trait  Anxiety  Index  (STAI)  (Brunton  2015),  Generalised  Anxiety
Disorder Scale (GAD-2) (Nath 2018), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)
(Beck  1993),  the  anxiety  subscale  of  the  Hospital  Anxiety  and
Depression Scale (HADS-A) (Zigmond 1983), Pregnancy Specific
Anxiety Scale (PSAS) (Roesch 2004), Pregnancy Related Anxiety
Questionnaire (PRAQ, PRAQ-R and PRAQ-S) (Brunton 2015)).
• Depression  (as  measured  on  generally  accepted  scales,  e.g.

Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox 1987).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Birth  preferences  (as  reported  by  the  woman  using  any  self-

report scale).

• Epidural analgesia during labour.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register
by contacting their Information Specialist (3 July 2021).

The  Register  is  a  database  containing  over  27,000  reports  of
controlled  trials  in  the  field  of  pregnancy  and  childbirth.  It
represents  over  30  years  of  searching.  For  full  current  search
methods  used  to  populate  Pregnancy  and  Childbirth’s  Trials
Register  including  the  detailed  search  strategies  for  CENTRAL,
MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of hand-searched journals
and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via
the current awareness service, please follow this link.

Briefly,  Cochrane  Pregnancy  and  Childbirth’s  Trials  Register  is
maintained  by  their  Information  Specialist  and  contains  trials
identified from:

1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled

Trials (CENTRAL);

2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
5. hand-searches  of  30  journals  and  the  proceedings  of  major

conferences;

6. weekly  current  awareness  alerts  for  a  further  44  journals  plus

monthly BioMed Central email alerts.

Search  results  are  screened  by  two  people  and  the  full  text  of
all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities
described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described,
each  trial  report  is  assigned  a  number  that  corresponds  to  a
specific  Pregnancy  and  Childbirth  review  topic  (or  topics),  and  is
then  added  to  the  Register.  The  Information  Specialist  searches
the  Register  for  each  review  using  this  topic  number  rather
than  keywords.  This  results  in  a  more  specific  search  set  that
has  been  fully  accounted  for  in  the  relevant  review  sections
(Included studies, Excluded studies, Studies awaiting classification
or Ongoing studies).

In  addition,  we  searched  ClinicalTrials.gov  and  the  World  Health
Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(ICTRP) for unpublished, planned and ongoing trial reports (3 July
2020) (see Appendix 1).

We did not apply any language or date restrictions.

Searching other resources

We  handsearched  the  reference  lists  of  all  relevant  studies
identified.  Where  only  abstracts  of  studies  were  available,  we
contacted  authors  for  further  details.  We  did  not  apply  any
language or publication date restrictions.

Data collection and analysis

The  following  methods  section  of  this  Cochrane  Review  is  based
on  a  standard  template  used  by  the  Cochrane  Pregnancy  and
Childbirth Group.

Selection of studies

Two  review  authors  (MOC,  SON)  independently  assessed  for
inclusion  all  the  potential  studies  identified  by  the  searches.  We
resolved any disagreements through discussion or, if required, we
consulted a third review author (AK).

We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records
identified, included and excluded.

Data extraction and management

We  used  a  standardised  data  extraction  form  for  eligible  studies.
Two  review  authors  (MOC,  SON)  independently  extracted  the
data. This standardised data extraction form included the type of
study, study setting, characteristics of participants, interventions,
main  outcome  measures,  trial  dates,  duration  of  study,  results
of  main  outcome  measures,  sources  of  trial  funding  and  the
trial  authors'  declarations  of  interest.  We  resolved  discrepancies
through  discussion  or,  if  required,  we  consulted  a  third  review
author (AK). One review author (MOC) entered the study data into
Review Manager software (Review Manager 2014), and another (AK)
checked the data for accuracy.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two  review  authors  (MOC,  SON)  independently  assessed  risk  of
bias  for  each  study  using  the  criteria  outlined  in  the  Cochrane
Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2011,
hereafter referred to as the Cochrane Handbook). We resolved any
disagreement through discussion or by involving a third assessor
(AK).

(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible
selection bias)

We described for each included study the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups.

We assessed the method as:

• low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number

table; computer random number generator);

• high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date

of birth; hospital or clinic record number);

• unclear risk of bias.

(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)

We described for each included study the method used to conceal
allocation  to  interventions  prior  to  assignment,  and  assessed
whether  intervention  allocation  could  have  been  foreseen  in
advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.

We assessed the methods as:

• low  risk  of  bias  (e.g.  telephone  or  central  randomisation;

consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• high  risk  of  bias  (open  random  allocation;  unsealed  or  non-

opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth);

• unclear risk of bias.

(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias)

We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We considered studies at low
risk  of  bias  if  they  were  blinded,  or  if  we  judged  that  the  lack  of
blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding
separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.

We assessed the methods as:

• low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.

(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible
detection bias)

We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different
outcomes or classes of outcomes.

We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:

• low, high or unclear risk of bias.

(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete
outcome data)

We  described  for  each  included  study,  and  for  each  outcome  or
class  of  outcomes,  the  completeness  of  data  including  attrition
and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and
exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis
at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants),
reasons  for  attrition  or  exclusion  where  reported,  and  whether
missing  data  were  balanced  across  groups  or  were  related  to
outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be
supplied by the trial authors, we aimed to re-include missing data
in the analyses which we undertook.

We assessed methods as:

• low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome

data balanced across groups);

• high  risk  of  bias  (e.g.  numbers  or  reasons  for  missing
data  imbalanced  across  groups;  ‘as  treated’  analysis  done
with  substantial  departure  of  intervention  received  from  that
assigned at randomisation);

• unclear risk of bias.

(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)

We  described  for  each  included  study  how  we  investigated  the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.

We assessed the methods as:

• low  risk  of  bias  (where  it  is  clear  that  all  of  the  study’s  pre-
specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the
review have been reported);

• high  risk  of  bias  (where  not  all  the  study’s  pre-specified
outcomes  have  been  reported;  one  or  more  reported  primary
outcomes  were  not  pre-specified;  outcomes  of  interest  are
reported  incompletely  and  so  cannot  be  used;  study  fails  to
include results of a key outcome that would have been expected
to have been reported);

• unclear risk of bias.

(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by
(1) to (5) above)

We described for each included study any important concerns we
have about other possible sources of bias.

We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that
could put it at risk of bias:

• low risk of other bias;
• high risk of other bias;
• unclear whether there is risk of other bias.

(7) Overall risk of bias

We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk
of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook
(Higgins  2011).  With  reference  to  (1)  to  (6)  above,  we  assessed
the  likely  magnitude  and  direction  of  the  bias  and  whether  we
considered  it  is  likely  to  impact  on  the  findings.  We  explored  the
impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses;
see Sensitivity analysis.

Where  we

the  same  outcome,  we
synthesised  the  data  in  the  same  meta-analysis.  We  considered
it  reasonable  to  combine  the  results  from  both  if  there  was
little heterogeneity between the interventions, and the interaction
between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation
unit was considered to be unlikely.

Cross-over trials

We did not include cross-over trials.

Multi-armed trials

We included a multi-armed trial in the analysis. This trial included
two  intervention  arms  and  a  control  arm.  To  include  the  data  in
the  analysis  without  double-counting  participants,  we  split  the
denominator  in  the  control  arm  by  two  in  order  to  create  two
pairwise comparisons.

Dealing with missing data

For included studies, we noted levels of attrition.

For  all  outcomes,  we  carried  out  analyses,  as  far  as  possible,
on  an  intention-to-treat  basis;  that  is,  we  attempted  to  include
all  participants  randomised  to  each  group  in  the  analyses,  and
all  participants  were  analysed  in  the  group  to  which  they  were
allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated
intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was
the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes
were  known  to  be  missing.  If  the  study  did  not  report  our
primary outcome, we contacted the study authors to request this. If
there was no reply after one contact and a reminder, we considered
there were no data available.

For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratios
(RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Assessment of heterogeneity

Continuous data

For continuous data, we used the mean difference if outcomes were
measured in the same way between trials.

In  future  updates,  we  will  used  standardised  mean  difference
(SMD)  to  combine  trials  that  measure  the  same  outcome,  but
using different methods. We will use these thresholds to interpret
SMD:

• SMD 0.8 or greater = large effect;
• SMD greater than 0.49 and less than 0.8 = medium effect;
• SMD greater than 0.19 and less than 0.5 = small effect;
• SMD less than 0.2 = trivial or no effect.

Unit of analysis issues

Cluster-randomised trials

We  included  cluster-randomised  trials  in  the  analyses  along  with
individually-randomised  trials.  We  adjusted  their  standard  errors
using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins
2021), using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient
(ICC)  derived  from  other  studies  of  a  similar  population.  Where

We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis firstly
by visual inspection of a forest plot, and then by using Tau2, I2 and
Chi2  statistics.  We  regarded  heterogeneity  as  substantial  if  I2  was
greater than 50% and either Tau2 was greater than zero, or there
was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi2 test for heterogeneity.

Assessment of reporting biases

If there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we planned
to  investigate  reporting  biases  (such  as  publication  bias)  using
funnel plots. We planned to assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.
If asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we planned to
perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.

Data synthesis

We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 (RevMan
5)  software  (Review  Manager  2014).  We  used  a  random-effects
model for combining data because of variation in the interventions,
meaning  that  it  likely  that  the  underlying  treatment  effects
differ between trials.

Where  we  used  random-effects  analyses,  the  results  were
presented  as  the  average  treatment  effect  with  95%  confidence
intervals, and I2.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Where  we  identified  substantial  heterogeneity,  we  investigated  it
using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.

• Mode of Intervention: individual versus group.
• Presence of co-morbidity: depression (yes versus no).
• Timing of the intervention during pregnancy: first versus second

versus third trimester.

However, data were not available for timing of intervention during
pregnancy and so the third subgroup analysis was not performed.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence

We  assessed  the  certainty  of  the  evidence  using  the  GRADE
approach,  as  outlined  in  the  GRADE  handbook,  for  the  following
outcomes in all comparisons.

• Fear  of  childbirth  (measured  by  a  validated  tool  such  as  the
Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire version A (W-DEQ A)).

• Caesarean section.
• Anxiety  (as  measured  on  generally  accepted  scales  (e.g.  State

Trait Anxiety Index (STAI)).

• Depression  (as  measured  on  generally  accepted  scales,  e.g.

Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale).

Subgroup analyses were restricted to the review's primary outcome
(fear of childbirth).

• Birth preference.
• Epidural analgesia during labour.

We  assessed  subgroup  differences  by  interaction  tests  available
within RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2014). We report the results of
subgroup analyses quoting the Chi2 statistic and P value, and the
interaction test I2 value.

Sensitivity analysis

We performed sensitivity analyses according to the risk of bias in
the  included  studies  where  possible.  We  explored  the  impact  of
risk of bias by investigating the change in the effect estimate when
studies at high risk of bias (for allocation concealment and blinding
of outcome assessors) were removed from the analyses.

To investigate the impact of missing data on our primary outcome,
we carried out sensitivity analysis by removing from the analysis
trials with high risk of incomplete outcome data.

We  also  conducted  sensitivity  analysis  to  examine  the  impact  of
different ICC estimates where we included data from cluster-RCTs
in the meta-analysis.

We  used  the  GRADEpro  Guideline  Development  Tool  to  import
data  from  Review  Manager  5  (https://revman.cochrane.org/
#/477318052509241879/dashboard/htmlView/1.31.8?
revertEnabled=true#REF-RevMan-2014) 
create
in  order 
summary of findings tables. A summary of the intervention effect
and  a  measure  of  certainty  for  each  of  the  above  outcomes
was  produced  using  the  GRADE  approach.  The  GRADE  approach
uses five domains (risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision,
indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body
of evidence for each outcome. The evidence was downgraded from
'high  certainty'  by  one  level  for  serious  (or  by  two  levels  for  very
serious) limitations, depending on the assessments for each GRADE
domain.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Included studies

Setting

We  included  seven  randomised  controlled  trials  (involving  1357
women)  in  this  review  (Boz  2020;  Kordi  2017;  Rahmani  2020;
Rondung 2018; Rouhe 2015; Toohill 2014; Wahlbeck 2020).

All  the  included  studies  were  published  in  English  between  2012
and 2020 and were carried out in five different countries (Australia,
Iran,  Sweden,  Finland  and  Turkey).  Three  of  the  studies  were
published in 2020 (Boz 2020; Rahmani 2020; Wahlbeck 2020).

studies 

compared 

These 
the  effects  of  various  non-
pharmacological  interventions  for  childbirth-related  fear  with
usual  maternity  care.  Interventions  under  evaluation  were:
psychoeducation  (group  or  individual)  (Kordi  2017;  Rouhe  2015;
Toohill  2014);  Internet  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT);  art
therapy (Wahlbeck 2020); peer teaching (Rahmani 2020); and group
discussion (Rahmani 2020). In the Wahlbeck study, the art therapy
was  an  adjunct  to  midwifery  counselling,  which  is  the  standard
in  Sweden  (Wahlbeck  2020).  Control  groups  consisted  of:  usual
maternity  care;  antenatal  education  (Boz  2020);  and  midwifery
counselling  (Rouhe  2015;  Wahlbeck  2020).  The  Rahmani  study
had  two  intervention  arms  -  peer  teaching  and  group  discussion
(Rahmani 2020).

Interventions were performed during pregnancy (Boz 2020; Kordi
2017;  Rahmani  2020;  Rondung  2018;  Rouhe  2015;  Toohill  2014;
Wahlbeck 2020). Two trials included one follow-up session in the
postnatal  period  (Rondung  2018;  Rouhe  2015).  The  number  of
intervention sessions during pregnancy ranged from two (Toohill
2014) to 16 (Rahmani 2020). The CBT intervention included eight
modules for which one to three homework items also needed to be
completed and feedback given (Rondung 2018).

Funding and declarations of interest

All  trials  reported  their  sources  of  funding.  One  trial  received
no  financial  assistance  (Boz  2020).  Three  trials  were  supported
by  local  university  research  funding  (Kordi  2017;  Rahmani  2020;
Rondung  2018).  One  received  charitable  funding  (Rouhe  2015).
One  received  funding  from  a  pharmaceutical  company  with  no
commercial interest in the trial (Wahlbeck 2020). One received state
funding (Toohill 2014).

All the trials reported declarations of interest. None of the author
teams declared a conflict of interest in any of the trials. However,
in the Wahlbeck trial, the first author is an art therapist; therefore,
there may be a potential conflict of interest (Wahlbeck 2020).

Designs

Nine  reports  from  seven  randomised  controlled  trials  were
included.  There  was  one  single-blinded  RCT  (Boz  2020),  two
multisite two-armed open trials (Rondung 2018; Toohill 2014), two
single-site  two-armed  open  trials  (Rouhe  2015;  Wahlbeck  2020),
one  single-site  three-armed  open  trial  (Rahmani  2020),  and  one
cluster-RCT (Kordi 2017).

Sample sizes

Sample sizes varied: the smallest trial recruited 24 participants (Boz
2020), whilst the largest trial recruited 371 women (Rouhe 2015).

Studies were conducted in a variety of settings from Australia, Iran,
Sweden, Finland and Turkey. Australia contributed one trial which
was conducted in the antenatal clinics of three public hospitals in
South  East  Queensland,  Australia  (Toohill  2014). Iran  contributed
two trials: one was performed in health centres of Mashhad (Kordi
2017);  and  a  second  took  place  in  community  health  centres
affiliated  to  Gonabad  University  of  Medical  Sciences  (Rahmani
2020).  Finland  contributed  one  trial  which  was  set  in  maternity
clinics at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of
Helsinki, Helsinki University Central Hospital (Rouhe 2015). Sweden
contributed  two  trials:  one  in  a  clinic  in  southern  Sweden
(Wahlbeck 2020); the other took place in a university hospital and
2 referral hospitals (Rondung 2018). The Turkish trial took place in
the antenatal clinic of a Turkish hospital (Boz 2020).

Participants

Participants were women with high to severe fear of childbirth, as
defined  in  each  individual  study  (n  =  1357).  Three  trials  included
nulliparous women (Boz 2020; Kordi 2017; Rouhe 2015), and four
trials included both nulliparous and parous women (Rahmani 2020;
Rondung 2018; Toohill 2014; Wahlbeck 2020).

Interventions and comparisons

1. Psychoeducation

Four trials  compared psychoeducation to a control group.

One  trial  compared  psychoeducation  based  on  human  caring
theory – consisting of relaxation, music, aromatherapy, massage,
education  about  infant  care,  listening  to  each  other,  developing
loving,  trusting  relationships,  problem-solving  and  creating  a
healing environment – to antenatal education, in which the focus
was on the physiology of labour and was not based on a theory or
model (Boz 2020).

One  trial  used  the  Birth  Emotions  and  Looking  to  Improve
Expectant  Fear  (BELIEF)  intervention  which  helps  women  to
develop  individualised  supports  for  the  present  and  near  future,
affirming that negative events can be coped with by using simple
problem-solving skills. In addition, birth expectations are reviewed,
distressing  elements  of  childbirth  are  unpicked,  strategies  to
develop support networks are employed, and a birth plan created
(Toohill 2014).

One trial based the intervention on Rosenbaum's resourcefulness
theory and utilised cognitive rehabilitation training and problem-
solving  skills  for  pregnant  women.  In  the  first  training  session,
stages  of  labour  and  pain  relief  methods  were  discussed  by
a  midwife  for  15  minutes.  At  the  end  of  each  session,  coping
skills  for  labour  were  taught  by  a  clinical  psychologist.  This
involved  relaxation  techniques  (deep-release,  differential,  and
conditioned relaxation techniques, and childbirth-related imagery)
(Kordi 2017).

One  trial  compared  psychoeducation  with  guided  relaxation,
with  usual  maternity  care,  which  is  midwifery  counselling  in
Finland (Rouhe 2015). Partners were also included in one session in
this study.

2. Internet cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)

One  trial  compared  Internet  CBT  to  a  control  group  (Rondung
2018).  This  intervention  used  a  guided,  Internet-based,  self-help
CBT program. The intervention aimed to help participants observe
and understand their childbirth-related fear and find new ways of
coping  with  difficult  thoughts  and  emotions.  The  control  group
received  the  standard  care  in  Sweden,  which  consists  of  two  to
four counselling sessions either by antenatal midwives, counselling
midwives  and  obstetricians,  or  a  psychosocial  unit  consisting  of
midwives,  obstetricians  and  psychologists.  Trialists  describe  the
aims of counselling as: understanding the origin of fear, reducing
fear, preparing for childbirth, empowering women in their ability to
give birth, and making the birth experience as positive as possible,
regardless of birth mode.

3. Peer teaching

One  trial  compared  peer  teaching  using  training,  which  included
the nature of delivery, labour pain and methods for reducing FOC,
with a control group who received usual maternity care (Rahmani
2020). All peers completed training courses under the supervision
of an expert. In the peer teaching group, training was held over four
two-hour sessions over four days for a period of four weeks.

4. Group discussion

The  same  trial  compared  group  discussion  in  the  other  trial  arm
with a control group who received usual maternity care (Rahmani
2020).  In  the  group  discussion  group,  training  sessions  were
conducted  with  the  presence  of  a  specialist  for  four  two-hour
sessions over four days for a period of four weeks.

5. Art therapy and midwifery counselling

One trial (n = 103) compared art therapy and midwifery counselling
with  a  control  group  who  received  usual  maternity  care,  which
is midwifery counselling in Sweden (Wahlbeck 2020). In addition,
participants'  partners  were  invited  to  one  of  the  sessions.
Participants  in  the  intervention  were  invited  to  five  sessions  of
art therapy. This intervention aimed to reduce FOC and motivate
more  women  to  give  birth  vaginally.  When  only  one  participant
was  recruited,  sessions  were  individual.  When  more  than  one
was  recruited,  participants  could  choose  individual  or  group  art
therapy with a limitation of three participants per group. Midwifery
counselling  is  guided  by  the  individual  needs  of  the  woman.
Each  woman  has  a  one-to-one  meeting  with  a  midwife  from  the
specialist  team  to  assess  their  needs.  In  the  case  of  multiparous

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

women, the case notes are used as a guide for the discussion where
the woman is encouraged to talk about her experience of what is
described in the notes. It is an opportunity to discuss and clarify
uncertainties  about  events  in  the  previous  birth,  where  possible.
A visit to the birth unit is offered if the woman is not familiar with
the birthing environment. Usually, the woman and midwife draw up
a plan for the approaching birth together. Continued sessions are
based on the woman’s individual and personally expressed needs.
An obstetrician may be asked to join the discussion when a woman
expresses a wish for a planned induction or caesarean section, in
accordance with Swedish national guidelines.

Outcomes

Primary outcome

All of the included studies reported the primary outcome, fear of
childbirth, which was measured using various scales. The W-DEQ A
was the most commonly-used measure of FOC.

Secondary outcomes 

No study reported a measure of anxiety as an outcome. All of our
other secondary outcomes were reported in at least one study.

Ongoing studies

We 
identified  four  ongoing  studies  (see  Characteristics  of
ongoing  studies),  all  of  which  are  investigating  different  non-
pharmacological interventions: eye movement desensitization and
reprocessing  (Baas  2017);  Beck  cognitive  counselling  therapy
(IRCT20120718010324N43);  a  novel  cognitive  behavioral  protocol
(NCT02972112); peer support (NCT03393637).

Excluded studies

We  excluded  47  trials.  We  describe  reasons  for  excluding  trials
in Figure 1 and Excluded studies. We excluded 36 studies as they did
not include our population of interest (i.e. participants did not have
high or severe fear of childbirth as defined in the trial). We excluded
two studies because they were not randomised. We excluded nine
studies  because  they  were  quasi-experimental  studies  or  cross-
over trials.

Risk of bias in included studies

We describe the risk of bias of included studies in the risk of bias
tables  attached  to  the  characteristics  of  included  studies  tables.
Our judgements about risk of bias are summarised in Figure 2 and

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Allocation

Random sequence generation

We  judged  one  trial  to  have  unclear  risk  of  bias  for  random
it  did  not  report  sufficient
sequence  generation  because 
information about the randomisation process (Rahmani 2020). We
judged  the  other  six  studies  to  be  low  risk  of  bias  because  they
described adequate methods of randomisation, such as computer-
generated random numbers.

Allocation concealment

We  judged  three  studies  as  low  risk  of  bias  for  allocation
concealment  because  they  described  using  adequate  methods
such  as  closed,  sealed  envelopes  (Boz  2020;  Rouhe  2015;  Toohill
2014). We judged one study as high risk because it reported having
assigned women to the intervention groups after having received
their  completed  baseline  questionnaires  (Wahlbeck  2020).  The
remaining three studies did not report sufficient information about
allocation concealment so we judged them as unclear risk of bias
(Kordi 2017; Rahmani 2020; Rondung 2018).

since  we  could  not  locate  the  trial  protocol  to  determine  if  the
planned outcomes were reported (Boz 2020).

Other potential sources of bias

We examined the included trials for other possible sources of bias.
We  assessed  four  studies  as  low  risk  of  bias  (Boz  2020;  Rahmani
2020; Rouhe 2015; Toohill 2014). We assessed two studies as unclear
risk of bias: one because it was conducted by a midwife who was
an art therapist and it was unclear whether this could have affected
the  outcomes  (Wahlbeck  2020);  and  the  other  because  it  used  a
tool to measure FOC that was not validated in the local language
(Kordi 2017). We assessed one study as high risk of bias because of
variation in the treatment received in the control group (Rondung
2018).

Effects of interventions

Blinding

Blinding of participants and personnel

Primary outcomes

Overall reduction in W-DEQ A

As  is  often  the  case  in  trials  evaluating  non-pharmacological
interventions,  blinding  of  participants  and  the 
intervention
provider  was  not  possible  in  most  of  the  trials.  We  judged  six
trials  as  high  risk  due  to  lack  of  blinding  because  knowledge  of
the  intervention  could  have  an  effect  on  self-reported  outcomes
(Boz  2020;  Kordi  2017;  Rondung  2018;  Rouhe  2015;  Toohill  2014;
Wahlbeck 2020). We judged one trial as unclear risk for blinding of
participants  and  personnel  because  the  women  were  not  told  to
which group they were allocated, but it is unclear if they could have
guessed their allocation (Rahmani 2020).

Blinding of outcome assessment

We  judged  two  trials  as  high  risk  of  bias  because  there  was  no
attempt to blind outcome assessors (Kordi 2017; Rondung 2018).
There was insufficient information in the remaining trials for us to
judge whether outcome assessors were blinded or not, so we rated
them  as  unclear  (Boz  2020;  Rouhe  2015;  Toohill  2014;  Wahlbeck
2020).

Incomplete outcome data

We judged three studies which reported low or no attrition in the
trial report as low risk of bias (Rahmani 2020; Rondung 2018; Toohill
2014).  We  judged  one  study  as  unclear  risk  because  it  did  not
provide enough information to ascertain whether women withdrew
from the study for reasons related to the intervention and it did not
report any intention-to-treat analysis (Kordi 2017). We judged three
studies as high risk because they had high or differential attrition,
or both (Boz 2020; Rouhe 2015; Wahlbeck 2020).

Selective reporting

We  evaluated  each  individual  trial  for  possible  risk  of  selective
reporting  bias.  Four  trials  appeared  to  have  low  risk  of  reporting
bias with outcomes reported as per protocol (Kordi 2017; Rondung
2018;  Toohill  2014;  Wahlbeck  2020).  Two  studies  were  judged  to
be  high  risk  for  possible  selective  reporting  bias  since  they  had
planned  to  report  different  outcomes  to  those  actually  reported
(Rahmani  2020;  Rouhe  2015).  We  judged  one  trial  as  unclear  risk

Overall,  participating  in  non-pharmacological  interventions  may
reduce  levels  of  fear  of  childbirth  as  measured  by  W-DEQ  but
the  reduction  may  not  be  clinically  meaningful  (mean  difference
(MD)  -7.08,  95%  CI  -12.19  to  -1.97;  I2  =  63%;  7  studies,  828
women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1; Summary of findings
1). Heterogeneity was noted to be moderately high which might be
explained  by  the  differences  in  the  control  groups  (some  studies
had  midwifery  counselling  as  usual  care)  or  due  to  the  small
sample size. The test for subgroup differences also suggested that
delivering interventions in a group setting or to individuals may be
an effect modifier (P = 0.001, I2 = 85.5%), although the small number
of studies in the subgroups means that we cannot be certain about
the cause of the difference between subgroups.

Sensitivity  analysis  removing  three  trials  at  high  risk  of  bias
for  allocation  concealment  or  blinding  of  outcome  assessors,  or
both, did not change the effect estimate substantially (MD -10.04,
95%  CI  -14.67  to  -5.41)  (Kordi  2017;  Rondung  2018;  Wahlbeck
2020).  Sensitivity  analysis  removing  three  trials  with  high  risk  of
incomplete outcome data changed the size of the effect estimate
but  this  may  not  represent  a  clinically  important  difference  (MD
-5.99,  95%  CI  -11.92  to  -0.06)  (Boz  2020;  Rouhe  2015;  Wahlbeck
2020).

We  also  conducted  sensitivity  analysis  to  examine  the  impact  of
different  ICC  estimates  to  account  for  the  cluster  design  in  one
of  the  studies  (see  Table  1).  The  effect  estimate  did  not  change
substantially when different ICC estimates were used.

There  may  be  little  to  no  difference  between  psychoeducation

Number of women having a caesarean section

Five  trials  reported  numbers  of  women  who  had  a  caesarean
section (Boz 2020; Kordi 2017; Rouhe 2015; Toohill 2014; Wahlbeck
2020).

Non-pharmacological  interventions  probably  reduce  the  number
of  women  having  a  caesarean  section  (RR  0.70,  95%  CI  0.55
to  0.89;  I2  =  0%;  5  studies,  557  women;  moderate-certainty
evidence; Analysis 1.2; Summary of findings 1).

Sensitivity  analysis  removing  two  trials  at  high  risk  of  bias  for
allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessors, or both,
did not change the effect estimate substantially (RR 0.72, 95% CI

We  also  conducted  sensitivity  analysis  to  examine  the  impact  of
different  ICC  estimates  to  account  for  the  cluster  design  in  one

possibility of a slight reduction in epidural use (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.98
to 1.48; I2 = 3%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.5; Summary of

Summary of main results

The  primary  objective  of  this  review  was  to  evaluate  the
effectiveness  of  non-pharmacological  interventions  on  fear  of
childbirth. To date, seven randomised controlled trials with 1357
participants are available for evaluation.

None of the included studies reported anxiety as an outcome.

Non-pharmacological  interventions  may  reduce  levels  of  fear
of  childbirth  as  measured  by  the  Wijma  Delivery  Expectancy
Questionnaire A (W-DEQ A), but the reduction may not be clinically
meaningful (low-certainty evidence; Summary of findings 1).

There may be little to no difference between non-pharmacological
interventions  and  usual  care  in  depression  scores  measured
with  the  Edinburgh  Postnatal  Depression  scale  (low-certainty
evidence; Summary of findings 1).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Non-pharmacological  interventions  probably  reduce  the  number
of  women  having  a  caesarean  section  (moderate-certainty
evidence; Summary of findings 1).

It is uncertain if non-pharmacological interventions have any effect
on  the  number  of  women  preferring  a  caesarean  section  (low-
certainty evidence; Summary of findings 1).

Non-pharmacological  interventions  may  increase  epidural  use
compared with usual care but the 95% CI includes the possibility of
a slight reduction in epidural use (low-certainty evidence; Summary
of findings 1).

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

The studies available for inclusion in this review were few - from
Sweden, Finland, Iran, Turkey and Australia - and the numbers of
participants  were  small.  Therefore,  generalisability  of  the  review
findings  is  limited.  In  addition,  we  found  two  ongoing  trials:
one  investigating  the  use  of  Eye  Movement  Desensitisation  and
Reprocessing  (EMDR)  (Baas  2017),  and  the  other  investigating  a
short CBT intervention (IRCT20120718010324N43). Therefore, this
body of evidence will continue to grow.

This is a relatively new area of research in which interest has grown
exponentially  in  recent  years.  Three  of  the  seven  included  trials
were published in 2020 (Boz 2020; Rahmani 2020; Wahlbeck 2020).
This  review  was  conducted  based  on  the  strength  of  the  W-DEQ
A  tool,  which  has  been  widely  accepted  as  the  optimal  measure
for fear of childbirth to date. Considering the heterogeneity of the
concept of fear of childbirth (Jomeen 2021; O'Connell 2017), and
recent  evidence  which  suggests  that  the  W-DEQ  A  may  be  multi-
dimensional  rather  than  uni-dimensional  and  may  not  be  widely
understood by English speaking women (Martin 2021; Slade 2020),
there is a need to further explore the concept of fear of childbirth
and  tocophobia,  in  order  to  address  women's  needs.  There  have
been preliminary studies into a questionnaire which was developed
in the UK in the English language (Fear of Childbirth Questionnaire
(FCQ) to facilitate the valid, reliable and acceptable assessment of
fear  of  childbirth,  but  further  research  to  determine  its  reliability
and validity are required (Slade 2021).

Moreover,  definitions  of  fear  of  childbirth  and  tocophobia
have  been  further  investigated  and  challenged  in  terms  of
accuracy  (Martin  2021;  Slade  2020).  Since  the  concept  is  poorly
defined  and  measurements  lacking,  efforts  to  better  define  the
concept  and  produce  operational  definitions  would  improve  the
completeness  and  applicability  of  the  evidence.  Furthermore,
secondary outcomes were not reported for the most part in trials.
It  was  surprising  that  anxiety  measures  in  particular  were  not
measured,  considering  the  overlap  with  FOC.  Measuring  birth
satisfaction would be important in terms of women's experience of
birth.

The interventions were described well overall but none of the trials
included in our review described adherence to the trial protocol,
which  is  a  limitation.  Additionally,  different  control  groups  were
used. In Sweden and Finland, midwifery counselling is the normal
pathway of care; thus, it would be unethical not to provide this care
to women identified as having fear of birth.

Quality of the evidence

Despite the contributions made by the authors of the seven trials
and 828 participants included in this review, we found the evidence
to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of women, staff and
outcome assessment (performance and detection bias), allocation
concealment (selection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition
bias)  and  selective  reporting  (reporting  bias),  as  well  as  other
possible  biases.  Small  sample  size  and  high  dropout  rate  were
concerns in some of the trials, as these would reduce the detection
of effects.

We downgraded the certainty of evidence for several reasons. We
judged the risk of bias, as discussed above, to be serious enough to
downgrade one level. Additionally, we downgraded for imprecision
due to the small numbers of women participating in the studies.
See Summary of findings 1.

Potential biases in the review process

interventions 

All  available  randomised  controlled  trials  investigating  non-
pharmacological 
fear  of  childbirth  and
tocophobia  in  pregnant  women  were  included  in  this  review,
with no language restrictions. We attempted to be as inclusive as
possible  by  going  to  great  lengths  to  contact  authors  of  reports,
requesting clarification of methodology or results.

for 

We acknowledge that the review process has a potential for risk of
bias. It is not an exact science and may be considered subjective.
We  attempted  to  minimise  this  risk  of  bias  by:  (1)  having  two
review  authors  independently  assess  risk  of  bias  and  carry  out
data  extraction;  and  (2)  contacting  study  authors  to  clarify  study
methods.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Non-pharmacological  interventions  probably  reduce  the  number
of women having a caesarean section.

Despite an obvious overlap between anxiety and fear of childbirth,
this  was  not  investigated  as  an  outcome  by  trials  included  in
this review. Clinicians and future researchers should recognise the
importance of measuring anxiety.

A small number of included RCTs examined depression following
non-pharmacological  interventions.  There  may  be  little  to  no
difference in depression scores.

Non-pharmacological  interventions  for  high  to  severe  fear  of
childbirth may lead to more epidural use in women.

Focusing  on  how  women  experience  giving  birth  rather  than  the
mode of birth is important for women with high to severe fear of
childbirth, since there is evidence that women who have a vaginal
birth despite requesting a caesarean section may have a negative
experience of birth.

Implications for research

Fear  of  childbirth  may  be  a  predictor  of  poor  psychological
outcomes  for  women  in  the  perinatal  period.  Women  with  fear
of  childbirth  in  pregnancy  may  consider  specific  interventions
to  reduce  their  level  of  fear.  Further  research  is  required  in  the
field  to  determine  a  better  construct  of  the  concept  of  fear  of
childbirth and the underpinning aetiology before further research
on  interventions  is  warranted.  RCTs  with  standardised  protocols,
validated  measurements  and  adequately  powered  samples  are
required.  Future  research  should  investigate  birth  satisfaction  as
well as other measures of psychological well-being such as anxiety
and depression.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

A C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S

Our  findings  with  regard  to  reducing  fear  of  childbirth  scores
are in agreement with three previous reviews that included non-
randomised  studies  as  well  as  RCTs  (Akgun  2020;  Moghaddam
Hosseini  2017;  Stoll  2018).  These  reviews  concluded  that  non-
pharmacological interventions may be beneficial for reducing fear
of  childbirth.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  reduction
should not be conflated with effectiveness of the intervention. The
findings of this review with regard to reduction in caesarean section
are in congruence with another reviews (Striebich 2018). In other
reviews,  authors  highlighted  the  importance  of  social  support
in  addition  to  education,  quality  improvement  strategies  and
counselling (Aguila 2021; Smith 2019).

Implications for practice

Based  on  a  small  number  of  RCTs  (with  small  sample  sizes),  the
effects of non-pharmacological interventions for women with high
to severe fear of childbirth are uncertain. While the interventions
appear  to  reduce  W-DEQ  A  scores,  in  clinical  terms,  this  may  not
translate to a meaningful reduction in fear for women. Participating
in  interventions,  however,  may  facilitate  an  informed  discussion
around the birth process and empower women to decide on mode
of birth.

Methods

Study was conducted as a single-blinded, randomised controlled trial between July and October 2018.

Participants

Inclusion criteria:

The sample of the study consisted of the nulliparous women admitted to the outpatient clinic in their
second trimester. Inclusion criteria were: (a) age between 18 and 45 years old; (b) the 20th or later ges-
tational weeks; (c) at least moderate level (≥ 66) FOC in terms of the Wijma Delivery Expectancy /Expe-
rience Questionnaire A; and (d) could speak and understand Turkish without any communication barri-
er.

Exclusion criteria:

Exclusion criteria were: (a) 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy; (b) a high-risk pregnancy; (c) con-
traindication at physical activity; (d) a communication barrier; and (e) multiparity.

Interventions

Intervention (n = 28): psychoeducation group, based on Human Caring Theory "based on preserving,
developing, and improving the individual’s mind-body-spirit harmony with a holistic approach"

Outcomes

Notes

Control (n = 28): antenatal education

The primary outcome was the level of the FOC in prenatal period, and the secondary outcomes were
the rate of preference for vaginal birth (VB) in prenatal period, the rate of vaginal birth, and the level of
the FOC within 2 weeks following the birth in postnatal period.

Supplementary table not included - authors contacted for this table which included further details of
the intervention according to the manuscript. Received appendix from authors.

On 13/06/2021 Dr Boz commented in relation to the intervention, "As a practitioner of the psychoedu-
cation program, I can say that the decrease in women's fear of childbirth and the change in their birth
preferences are a natural result of such devotedly structured and applied nursing care. The philosophy
of Human Caring Theory is adopted in this program. In this philosophy, individuals are considered as
a whole consisting of mind body and spirit harmony. Ethical, deep transpersonal interaction process

with women has been established. The program was supported by caring healing methods, also known
as complementary therapies. We believe that the combination of the philosophy of Human Caring The-
ory, deeply interactions and some of the complementary therapies may have enabled this program to
run effectively and provided a significant difference between the groups."

Methods

Cluster randomised clinical trial

Participants

This randomised clinical trial was conducted on 122 primigravid women referred to the healthcare cen-
tres of Mashhad, Iran, from 21 January 2016 to 19 February 2017. In this study, the cluster sampling
method was performed, and centres No. 2 and 3 were chosen randomly as clusters among the 5 health-
care centres in Mashhad, Iran (1, 2, 3, 5, and Samen). Thereafter, 2 subsets of each centre (Vahdat and
Shahid Hasheminezhad from centre No. 2, and Sahraee and Ahmadi from centre No. 3) were select-
ed as the study units. The centres were randomly allocated to the control and intervention groups. To
do so, the names of the 2 centres were written on 2 separate sheets and placed in a draw bag. The first
paper was considered as the intervention group and the other one was the control group. Therefore,
the Vahdat and Sahraee Centers were considered to be the intervention group and Shahid Hashem-
inezhad and Ahmadi centres the control group. Sampling was performed using the convenience sam-
pling method in each centre.

Interventions

Inclusion criteria: the inclusion criteria were Iranian nationality, primigravidity, residence in Mashhad,
reading and writing literacy, age between 18 and 35 years, singleton low-risk pregnancy, gestational
age of 14 to 28 weeks, no history of mental illnesses and FOC score of 66 or higher.

Exclusion criteria: the exclusion criteria included congenital anomalies in the fetus as confirmed by ul-
trasonography, abortion, stillbirth and absence from the educational sessions.

Intervention (n = 60): women in the intervention group were divided into 7 groups of 10 members and
received the psychoeducational program for 3 weeks (one 90-minute session per week) by a clinical
psychologist. The overall approach was based on Rosenbaum's resourcefulness theory, and the inter-
ventions based on cognitive rehabilitation training and problem-solving skills for pregnant women.
In the first training session, a midwife described the labour stages and pain relief methods for 15 min-
utes. At the end of each session, a clinical psychologist explained the relaxation techniques (i.e. deep-
release, differential, and conditioned relaxation techniques, as well as childbirth-related imagery) as a
coping skill to deal with labour. 

Control/Comparison intervention (n = 62): routine prenatal care.

Outcomes

Primary outcome: FOC post intervention (6 weeks postpartum) measured using W-DEQ A tool.

Secondary outcome: rates of CS

Variation in standard care (SC) across the 3 study centres. “All hospitals in Swe-
den provide SC for pregnant women with FOB. Although guidelines exist, the
content of SC and the time set aside for it differ between hospitals. Women
with FOB usually receive 2-4 counselling sessions either by antenatal mid-
wives, counselling midwives and obstetricians, or a psychosocial unit consist-
ing of midwives, obstetricians, and psychologists. The counselling aims at un-
derstanding the origin of fear, reducing the fear, preparing for childbirth, em-
powering women in their ability to give birth, and making the birth experience
as positive as possible, regardless of the mode of birth [24]. Since SC is orga-
nized differently across the country, this also applies to SC at the study centres
in this study. Depending on which study centre a participant belonged to, SC
started either in the next meeting with the antenatal midwife or after referral
to a counselling midwife or a psychosocial unit”.

The intervention method used to treat women with severe fear of childbirth was group psychoeduca-
tion with relaxation exercises. "Six group sessions were held during pregnancy (starting at mean the
28th week of pregnancy) and one session 6–8 weeks after delivery. Sessions were led by a psychologist
with specialised skills in group therapy and pregnancy issues. Each group consisted of a maximum of 6
nulliparous women. The sessions (2 hours) had a fixed structure: a focused topic and a 30-minute relax-
ation with mindfulness guided exercise, using a compact audio disk developed for this purpose. Every
session began with the therapist setting the agenda for the coming session and the sharing of feelings
and thoughts that came up after the previous session. Then there was a guided discussion on the topic
of the session and the session ended with the relaxation exercise. The guided relaxation exercise took
participants through all stages of delivery in a relaxed state of mind with positive, calming and support-
ive suggestions or alternatively, a breathing exercise. The development of the group intervention was
based on experience with therapeutic group work, attachment theory, social cognitive theories and
individual coping strategies. The aim of the intervention was to enhance preparedness for childbirth
among nulliparous women with severe fear of childbirth. The focus of the intervention was to share the
difficult emotions and fears concerning the delivery and increase the feelings of safety and trust within
the participants. Another aim was to strengthen the participants’ confidence in themselves regarding
childbirth and motherhood, and also to increase their knowledge of the stages of delivery."

Comparator (n = 240): "those randomised to the control group received a letter in which they were ad-
vised, if necessary, to discuss their fear of childbirth in their maternity unit in primary health care."

Primary outcome: Psycho-emotional and psychosocial evaluations (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
Scale (EPDS), social support, Maternal Adjustment and Attitudes (MAMA), Traumatic Events Scale (TES)
and the Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ B)) were completed twice during pregnancy
(once at mid-pregnancy and again at late pregnancy) and then at 3 months after giving birth.

Study characteristics

Methods

A multisite randomised controlled trial using a 2-arm non-blinded parallel trial design.

Participants

Setting: “Women in their second trimester attending antenatal clinics of 3 hospitals in South East
Queensland, Australia (3 public hospitals)”

Interventions

Inclusion criteria:  Women scoring high for childbirth fear (W-DEQ A ≥ 66). “Women in their second
trimester attending antenatal clinics of 3 hospitals in South East Queensland, Australia able to commu-
nicate sufficiently in English, and aged 16 years or older were recruited by research assistants”. 

Exclusion criteria: “Women requiring an interpreter, younger than 16 years, or more than 24 weeks
pregnant, and anticipating or experiencing a perinatal death (e.g. congenital abnormality incompati-
ble) or stillbirth were excluded”.

Intervention (n = 170): BELIEF is a telephone psychoeducation counselling intervention offered by
midwives. The intervention aims to review women’s current expectations and feelings around fear of
childbirth, support the expression of feelings, and provide a framework for women to identify and work
through distressing elements of childbirth. The intervention was adapted from a midwifery counselling
framework for distressed postpartum women developed by Gamble and Creedy. The BELIEF interven-
tion aimed to help women develop individual situational supports for the present and near future af-
firming that negative things can be managed with a simple plan developed to achieve this. All partici-
pants received a copy of a decision-aid booklet entitled 'Having a baby in Queensland'. The telephone
counselling intervention was offered at 24 and 34 weeks of pregnancy.

Comparator (n = 169): "Women in the control group will receive standard care. All women will be given
the evidence-based consumer resource “Choosing how to birth your baby” developed by the Queens-
land Centre for Mothers and Babies." Comparator group received the same written information as the
intervention group.

Outcomes

Primary outcome: childbirth fear (W-DEQ A).

Secondary outcomes: conducted using independent samples t-test. Change scores for fear (W-DEQ A),
decisional conflict scale (DCS), and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale - EPDS) were cal-
culated for both groups comparing post treatment scores for the intervention and control groups with
the baseline score as the covariate.

Study characteristics

Methods

An open, randomised, controlled trial with 2 arms to compare treatment alternatives for severe FOC.

Participants

Interventions

Setting: Participants were recruited between March 2011 and March 2017 from 10 antenatal clinics in
southern Sweden. At these clinics, all women who register their pregnancy are asked to indicate, on a
visual analogue scale, the extent of their fear of the approaching birth. Scores above 7 are considered
high enough to require treatment and these women are referred to a specialist group at the obstetric
unit at the regional hospital. When contact was made with the specialist group, these women were in-
vited to join the study.

Inclusion criteria: Scores above 7 are considered high enough to require treatment and these women
are referred to a specialist group at the obstetric unit at the regional hospital. When contact was made
with the specialist group, these women were invited to join the study. Statistics from the unit (unpub-
lished) show that 4.3% of pregnant women were referred to the specialist group because of severe FOC
during the data collection period.

Exclusion criteria: Pregnant women who did not understand or speak Swedish, had physical hin-
drance for a vaginal birth or were diagnosed with obstetrical complications, a current depression re-
quiring medical intervention, acute psychosis or current substance abuse were excluded from the
study. Women who registered later than the 35th gestational week were also excluded since there was
a risk that the treatment could not be finished before the birth.

Experimental intervention (n = 55): midwife-led counselling plus art therapy (AT). Women in the inter-
vention group invited to 5 AT sessions. The aims were to reduce FOC and motivate more women to give
vaginal birth. When only 1 participant was recruited, AT was provided individually. When more than 1
was recruited, participants could choose individual or group AT. A group was limited to 3 participants.
27 women were treated individually and 12 in the group. The sessions were given between 28 and 36
gestational weeks and held in a locality outside of the hospital surroundings. Painting was offered as
a tool for self-reflection to release feelings they were unable to express elsewhere, to strengthen the
process of bonding with their baby, and to initiate the counselling component of AT. The sessions were
given once per week and lasted between 90 and 120 minutes. The art therapist was a midwife and first
author in this study.

Comparator (n = 48): midwife-led counselling only

Outcomes

Outcomes: Pregnant women whose FOC decreased from severe (≥ 100 W-DEQ points) to any level be-
low this (≤ 99 W-DEQ points) after treatment in Study Group (SG) or Control Group (CG).

Secondary outcomes:

(1) comparison of changes in the mean W-DEQ between measurements at recruitment and at the end
of treatment for SG and CG;

(2) comparison of number of Midwifery Counselling (MC) sessions required by SG and CG;

(3) comparison of type of birth; normal vaginal birth versus all other types of birth between SG and CG;
and

(4) number of women with higher levels of FOC after treatment.

Notes

Sources of trial funding: This research received a grant of 2,500 US dollars from Procter and Gamble.
The company had no commercial interest in the use of AT.

Trial author declaration of interest: Nothing reported. First author was a midwife and conducted the
art therapy sessions.
