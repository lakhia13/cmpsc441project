Psychedelics, derived from the Greek words “psyche” (soul) and “deloun” (revealing), are substances historical-
ly and currently considered “soul-revealing”. Also termed hallucinogens due to their impact on sensory percep-
tion, they are further categorized into hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and 
mescaline; entactogens or empathogens, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA); and disso-
ciatives, such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine.
The concept of using these substances to enhance psychotherapy emerged in the 1940s, leading to the first 
wave of psychedelic research, which yielded promising initial results. Following a period of restricted research, 
modern investigations began anew around 20 years ago. In this review, we analyze the last 10 years of research, 
exploring the potential of psychedelics in psychotherapy. Current evidence reveals that psychedelic-assisted psy-
chotherapy remains an experimental approach. While preliminary studies suggest potential therapeutic benefits 
in treating various conditions, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive dis-
order, and substance use disorders, a definitive assessment of efficacy and safety is hampered by the scarcity 
of large-scale, rigorous clinical trials. Psychedilics should rather be viewed as integral components of broader 
therapeutic frameworks than as standalone treatment. The unique mechanisms of psychedelics, notably their 
effect on neuroplasticity, hint at the potential to address treatment gaps in patients unresponsive to conven-
tional methods. However, this potential requires validation through larger, more rigorously designed studies. 
Future research must prioritize high-quality, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials encompassing 
diverse populations to produce reliable, generalizable findings and ensure responsible clinical implementation. 
The aim of this article is to review the current status of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

Introduction

Psychedelics, as their name suggests (psyche is Greek for soul, 
and deloun means revealing), are currently, and were in the 
past, considered “soul-revealing substances”. They can also 
be called hallucinogens, to emphasize their effect on sensory 
perception [1]. By definition, psychedelics constitute a class of 
psychoactive substances that induce characteristic alterations 
in perception, mood, cognition, and the sense of self (ego), pri-
marily through agonism at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors with-
in the central nervous system. Classical psychedelics include 
tryptamine derivatives, such as psilocybin and dimethyltrypt-
amine, ergoline derivatives, such as lysergic acid diethylam-
ide (LSD), and phenethylamines, for example, mescaline [2].

A  different  view  divides  psychedelics  into  hallucinogens  – 
tryptamine  derivatives,  such  as  psilocybin,  ergoline  deriva-
tives, such as LSD, and phenethylamine derivatives, such as 
mescaline; entactogens, or empathogens, commonly exempli-
fied by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA); and 
dissociatives, such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine [3].

The idea of using drugs to speed up psychotherapy is not new 
and has been discussed in the literature since the 1940s, when 
substances from the group of barbiturates, amphetamine de-
rivatives, nitric oxide, LSD, and others were proposed for such 
purposes [4]. Psychedelics have been used in various cultures 
in medical and religious contexts for many centuries. The in-
tegration of psychedelics into psychotherapy has been con-
sidered for decades. The psychedelic effects of LSD were first 
discovered by Albert Hofmann in the early 1940s [5]. This dis-
covery initiated the first wave of research on these compounds, 
which continued uninterrupted until the Cultural Revolution 
of the 1960s. During this period, psychedelics were prohib-
ited, leading to a suspension of all related research in 1966, 
for over 20 years [6]. In the early 1950s, psychedelics were re-
garded as a group of compounds that could serve as tools to 
shorten psychotherapy [7]. Initially, during that decade, psy-
chotherapy with psychedelics followed 2 primary approaches. 
The “psycholytic” method involved lower doses administered 
during frequent sessions to enhance the standard therapeu-
tic process. In contrast, the psychedelic method used higher 
doses during less frequent sessions, aiming to induce mystical 
experiences and moments of intense catharsis [8].

A meta-analysis of 19 studies conducted between 1949 and 
1973  revealed  that  79%  of  patients  with  mood  disorders 
showed improvement following the use of psychedelics [9]. 
Although the use of psychedelics in modern treatment remains 
controversial, and past research methodologies have notable 
limitations, the hypothesis of their effectiveness in mental dis-
orders should not be entirely dismissed.

Modern research into psychedelics resumed in the 1990s in 
Germany [10], the United States [11], and Switzerland [12]. 
Since then, more than a dozen studies have been conduct-
ed, including but not limited to investigations into the safety 
and tolerability of psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD), the use of psilocybin and LSD to alleviate psycholog-
ical distress associated with terminal illnesses, psilocybin in 
tobacco and alcohol addiction, and the effects of ayahuasca 
and psilocybin in major depressive disorder. A significant draw-
back of these studies is their failure to meet modern method-
ological standards, mainly due to limited sample sizes and a 
lack of conclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness [1].

The purpose of this study is to critically examine and synthe-
size existing research from the past 10 years regarding the po-
tential use of psychedelics in psychotherapy, with a particular 
focus on evaluating their therapeutic efficacy, safety profiles, 
and  underlying  mechanisms  of  action.  By  reviewing  clinical 
and preclinical studies, this work aims to provide a compre-
hensive understanding of how psychedelics can contribute to 
the treatment of various psychological disorders, as well as 
the challenges and opportunities involved in integrating these 
substances into psychotherapeutic practices.

Methodology

The  review  analyzed  51  studies.  Two  publications  were  ex-
cluded due to their withdrawal from the database following 
author-related  infringements  involving  conflicts  of  interest 
[13,14]. The review was based on publications retrieved from 
the  PubMed/Medline  database.  In  the  search,  we  used  the 
phrase “psychedelic AND assisted AND psychotherapy”. The 
analysis focused on 9 clinical trials and 40 randomized clin-
ical  trials  that  combined  psychotherapy  with  controlled  ad-
ministration of psychedelic substances, including MDMA, psi-
locybin, LSD, and ketamine. The review encompassed studies 
published within the past 10 years.

Overview of Psychedelic Substances

Psychedelics, like antidepressants, influence serotonin trans-
mission, among other mechanisms. Serotonin reuptake inhib-
itors (SSRIs), in addition to their primary action on the sero-
tonin transporter, exert effects on various receptors, including 
the enhancement of postsynaptic 5-HT1A transmission. This 
mechanism is thought to reduce stress, impulsivity, aggres-
sion,  and  anxiety,  while  also  enhancing  resilience  and  miti-
gating emotional shallowness, ultimately leading to improved 
mood. In contrast, psychedelics achieve mood improvement 
through agonism at 5-HT2A receptors, which reduces rigidity in 
thinking and increases sensitivity to environmental stimuli [1].

Hallucinogens: LSD and Psilocybin

The prototype of a substance with hallucinogenic properties 
is  psilocybin  (4-diphosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine),  a 
compound derived from hallucinogenic mushrooms. Psilocybin 
functions as both an active ingredient and a prodrug for an-
other hallucinogen, psilocin. A defining characteristic of hallu-
cinogens is their agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor. This concept 
is further supported by evidence showing that the effects of 
hallucinogens in humans can be reversed by substances acting 
as 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, but not by D2 receptor antag-
onists [3]. The use of hallucinogens is associated with the rap-
id development of tolerance, a phenomenon known as tachy-
phylaxis, which results from the downregulation of the 5-HT2A 
receptor. For instance, daily use of LSD leads to a complete 
loss of sensitivity to its effects by the fourth day of use [15].

LSD  is  the  most  extensively  studied  of  the  substances  dis-
cussed.  It  was  first  synthesized  in  1938  by  Swiss  chemist 
Albert Hofmann in the laboratories of the Sandoz company. 
Early research focused on its potential use in the treatment of 
neuroses, alcohol addiction, and psychosomatic disorders [8]. 
However, this research came to an end in the mid-1960s. In 
1965, Sandoz ceased the production of LSD, and in 1966, the 
use of all hallucinogens was banned in the United States. By 
1970, psilocybin and LSD were added to the list of controlled 
substances [1]. The research was discontinued due to the in-
creasing recreational use of hallucinogens and their political 
consequences. The use of LSD and marijuana within the hip-
pie subculture, which was protesting the Vietnam War, raised 
concerns among U.S. federal and state authorities. The anti-
war stance and rejection of conventional social norms were 
viewed as the result of psychoactive substances that altered 
the minds of young people [14]. The state induced by halluci-
nogen intoxication is often referred to as a “trip” and is asso-
ciated with changes in sensory perception. Despite the term, 
hallucinogens often do not induce true hallucinations but rath-
er illusions – distortions of perceived reality.

Hallucinogens, particularly LSD, are sometimes referred to as 
psychosis-mimicking substances (psychomimetics), although 
it is well-established that stimulants induce similar symptoms 
to a much greater extent. Hallucinogens, on the other hand, in 
addition to inducing visual illusions, can cause visual metamor-
phopsia (macropsias and micropsias), mood swings, a subjec-
tive sense of time distortion, synesthesia, enhanced auditory 
perception, and depersonalization and derealization [3]. LSD, 
in addition to its 5-HT2A receptor agonist effect, shows ago-
nism at the 5-HT2C receptor, while psilocybin acts as an ago-
nist at the 5-HT1A receptor. Both substances are also thought 
to enhance glutamatergic transmission, although this mecha-
nism is not fully understood [2]. A study discussed the use of 
LSD in treating anxiety associated with terminal illnesses, but 

given its receptor profile, this substance could also be used 
in the treatment of mood disorders [8]. Psilocybin, unlike LSD, 
is a naturally occurring substance found in mushrooms of the 
genus Psilocybe [15]. Its use is associated with a lower addic-
tive potential than is ketamine [16]. Research shows that its 
use results in a diminished ability to suppress or ignore sen-
sory stimuli [17].

One of the proposed effects of hallucinogens on the brain is 
the disruption of the cortico-striatum-thalamocortical pathway, 
which plays a key role in conscious activity and the filtering 
of sensory information reaching the cerebral cortex. Impaired 
filtering, inhibition, and suppression of exteroceptive and in-
teroceptive stimuli can result in sensory overload and a break-
down of cognitive integrity. This, in turn, leads to perceptual 
disturbances and alterations in ego functioning [2]. Another 
unique property of hallucinogens is their ability to induce flash-
backs – spontaneous recurrences of experiences from intoxi-
cation episodes, lasting from a few seconds to several hours, 
occurring without subsequent substance use. One hypothe-
sis explaining the occurrence of flashbacks involves emotion-
al conditioning stored in the amygdala. Under the influence of 
an inert stimulus resembling one present during intoxication, 
the memory is thought to be reactivated. This mechanism is 
similar to the reliving of memories observed in post-traumat-
ic stress disorder (PTSD), which has led to contemporary cau-
tion regarding the use of hallucinogens or psychedelics in PTSD 
treatment [3]. Hallucinogens are a group of substances that 
have long been associated with great therapeutic potential. 
Some researchers once suggested that they could become to 
psychiatry what the telescope is to astronomy or the micro-
scope to biology [2]. Future research will determine whether 
these past predictions hold true and whether the use of hal-
lucinogens in treatment will indeed bring the anticipated rev-
olution or pose a threat.

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)

The prototypical empathogen is MDMA. The effects of its use 
include  feelings  of  connectedness,  unity,  kinship,  and  emo-
tional openness, collectively described as empathy. MDMA is 
a synthetic amphetamine derivative that exhibits greater se-
lectivity for the serotonin transporter than for the dopamine 
transporter or norepinephrine transporter, than does amphet-
amine. Within the synapse, MDMA likely acts similarly to hal-
lucinogens,  including  agonism  at  the  5-HT2A  receptor  [3]. 
Historically, MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by Merck, 
with the earliest reports of its use in psychotherapy emerging 
in the early 1970s [13].

The recreational use of MDMA gained popularity in the ear-
ly 1980s, particularly within the rave subculture, when par-
ticipants  consumed  the  substance  in  the  form  of  “Ecstasy”

pills during club events. MDMA is also colloquially referred to 
as “Molly”, a term likely derived from “molecule”. The use of 
MDMA at late-night parties, often accompanied by prolonged 
dancing in enclosed spaces, was associated with dehydration, 
hyperthermia,  and,  in  some  cases,  fatalities.  These  adverse 
outcomes led to the inclusion of MDMA on the list of banned 
substances, in 1985 [3].

Despite its similarities to hallucinogens, MDMA is distinguished 
by its chemical structure and exhibits a more pronounced stim-
ulant-like effect. It produces a “prosocial” effect by reducing 
reactivity to negative emotional stimuli. Additionally, MDMA 
use enhances the desire for socialization and closeness with 
others, an effect that supports both the therapeutic and rec-
reational applications [18]. This prosocial effect is central to 
MDMA’s most extensively studied application: psychotherapy 
for PTSD. By fostering emotional openness, MDMA facilitates 
the exploration of negative emotions and beliefs, such as trau-
matic memories. Interestingly, other stimulants have demon-
strated similar prosocial effects and were historically consid-
ered for use in trauma-focused psychotherapy [19]. The current 
model of PTSD pathophysiology suggests heightened and dys-
regulated amygdala activity in response to trauma, combined 
with insufficient inhibition from the ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex. MDMA appears to counteract these effects by increas-
ing ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity and reducing amyg-
dala activity, potentially addressing some of the neurobiologi-
cal mechanisms underlying PTSD [20]. In addition, MDMA use 
increases oxytocin secretion (Wolfson et al), which can con-
tribute to improving the therapeutic alliance in patients un-
dergoing psychotherapy. The direct effects of MDMA include 
euphoria, reduced general and social anxiety, enhanced emo-
tional  perception  and  expression,  increased  self-reflection, 
decreased defensive attitudes, and a reduction in social anxi-
ety. MDMA also promotes prosocial behaviors, such as a will-
ingness to engage in physical touch and hugging, as well as 
heightened self-esteem and self-acceptance. These effects can 
lead to a reduction in emotional avoidance, an increased tol-
erance for processing difficult emotions (the “window of tol-
erance”), an enhanced ability to recall traumatic events, and 
facilitation of cognitive restructuring [19]. Beyond its applica-
tion in PTSD, MDMA has shown potential for treating social 
anxiety [20] and alcohol addiction [21].

Dissociatives

Dissociatives are NMDA receptor antagonists and include ket-
amine and PCP [3]. These substances were originally developed 
as anesthetics, as they induce a dissociative state character-
ized by catalepsy, amnesia, and analgesia. During this state, 
patients experience perceptual disturbances and a sense of 
detachment (dissociation) from their surroundings. This disso-
ciative state can also be associated with sensory deprivation, 

as well as feelings of being in a dreamlike or trance-like con-
dition. At higher doses, both substances cause sedation. Upon 
awakening, PCP induces a strong psychotomimetic effect, un-
like ketamine, which does not produce similar effects [3].

Ketamine  has  been  successfully  used  as  an  anesthetic  and 
analgesic,  with  fewer  adverse  effects  than  its  parent  com-
pound [3]. In low doses, ketamine is sometimes used as a rec-
reational club drug, commonly referred to as “Special K”. In 
this context, it resembles other hallucinogens; however, un-
like classic hallucinogens, it additionally induces dissociative 
symptoms, including depersonalization and derealization [3].

The first reports on the use of ketamine in psychiatry date back 
to 1973 (Khorramzadeh and Lofty). The earliest accounts of its 
potential antidepressant effects appeared in 1974 in Argentina 
(Fontana). Russian studies later explored its possible role in 
the treatment of alcohol addiction [22].

Since the late 1990s, researchers have investigated ketamine’s 
antidepressant properties while attempting to minimize its psy-
choactive effects, particularly dissociation, which is general-
ly considered an undesirable adverse effect. The most exten-
sively studied patient population consists of individuals with 
treatment-resistant  depression,  defined  as  those  who  have 
not responded to at least 2 conventional antidepressants [23]. 
As a result, the ketamine enantiomer esketamine has become 
the only psychedelic-like substance currently approved by the 
FDA for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression [24]. 
However, its efficacy and long-term safety remain subjects of 
ongoing debate and research.

Additionally, ketamine has been explored as a potential ad-
junct in addiction therapy, with some hypotheses suggesting 
that its effects on prefrontal cortical plasticity can play a role 
[3]. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of these findings re-
mains uncertain. The use of ketamine in psychotherapy is some-
times associated with transient psychological effects, such as 
a dose-dependent reduction in negative emotional states. At 
lower doses, ketamine has been reported to induce a trance-
like state that can facilitate communication and reduce the 
fear associated with recalling difficult memories, potentially 
leading to a temporary decrease in depressive and obsessive 
thoughts. At higher doses, however, it can produce a profound 
dissociative state, characterized by a diminished awareness of 
one’s body and surroundings, the therapeutic value of which 
remains controversial [23].

Ayahuasca and dimethyltryptamine

Ayahuasca, a traditional South American decoction, is common-
ly prepared from the vine Banisteriopsis caapi, which contains 
beta-carboline alkaloids, and the shrub Psychotria viridis, which

supplies the hallucinogenic compound N,N-dimethyltryptamine 
(DMT). Historically, it has been used by Amazonian indigenous 
populations for cultural and healing purposes, particularly in spir-
itual contexts. Over time, interest in ayahuasca has significantly 
expanded, not only for religious ceremonies but also for recre-
ational use. The substance itself acts as 5-HT2A receptor ago-
nist [25]. The acute effects of ayahuasca typically begin about 
40 minutes after administration and gradually subside over ap-
proximately 4 hours. During this time, individuals often report 
heightened self-confidence, a renewed perspective on personal 
conflicts, and the ability to confront profound personal truths [26].

Clinical trials investigating ayahuasca have been conducted 
but  remain  limited  in  scope.  Several  randomized  controlled 
trials have produced promising results, although they neces-
sitate  further  analysis  with  larger  patient  cohorts.  A  recent 
systematic review and meta-analysis [27] examined the ther-
apeutic effects of psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD, and 
ayahuasca, on depressive symptoms in clinical settings. The 
meta-analysis, which included 7 studies (n=223), demonstrat-
ed significant reductions in depressive symptoms at 1 day, 1 
week, and 3 to 5 weeks after treatment. These findings align 
with  the  broader  conclusions  of  the  systematic  review.  The 
results suggest that psychedelics, when combined with psy-
chological support, can offer short- and long-term benefits for 
patients with depression. However, despite these promising 
outcomes, important limitations remain. These include small 
sample sizes, reliance on cross-over study designs for follow-
up, and the need for graphical data extraction in certain in-
stances. As a result, the authors emphasize the necessity for 
further large-scale, rigorously designed randomized controlled 
trials to confirm these findings and establish definitive con-
clusions. Moreover, research on ayahuasca has been extended 
to address a major public health concern – suicide. According 
to the World Health Organization, more than 720 000 people 
die by suicide each year, highlighting an urgent need for in-
novative solutions [28]. A double-blind, parallel-arm, random-
ized placebo-controlled trial investigated the effects of aya-
huasca on suicidality in individuals with treatment-resistant 
depression. While the results did not reach statistical signifi-
cance, the study showed a potential trend toward reductions 
in suicidality, with medium between-group and large within-
group effect sizes favoring ayahuasca over placebo across all 
assessed time points. From a clinical perspective, the findings 
underscore the importance of exploring novel interventions 
for suicidality, particularly in treatment-resistant populations. 
Psychedelics, like ayahuasca, can offer rapid therapeutic ef-
fects within psychotherapy or sustained benefits following a 
single dose. However, it is important to note that suicidal ide-
ation  can  occur  independently  of  depression,  necessitating 
further research to elucidate the specific impact of ayahuas-
ca on suicidality beyond depressive contexts.

The therapeutic outcomes of ayahuasca are strongly influenced 
by psychological support and contextual factors during its admin-
istration. Structured approaches, such as adherence to dietary 
protocols and attention to set and setting, are crucial for mitigat-
ing risks and enhancing the therapeutic experience. Additionally, 
there is a pressing need to establish safety measures addressing 
potential interactions between ayahuasca and prescribed med-
ications, such as SSRIs or dopaminergic stimulants, which can 
increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of ayahuasca 
is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, 
cardiovascular conditions, and liver or gastrointestinal diseas-
es. Furthermore, certain psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar 
disorder or psychosis, can pose increased risks, including man-
ic episodes or psychotic onset, and thus warrant caution [29]. 
As with other psychedelics, ayahuasca can occasionally induce 
dysphoric reactions accompanied by heightened anxiety [30].

Another noteworthy substance is DMT, which, like other psyche-
delics, acts as a 5-HT2A receptor agonist and, aside from that, 
activates the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors [26]. It induces tran-
sient disturbances in consciousness, characterized by vivid and 
complex visual hallucinations, as well as a range of somatosen-
sory, affective, and cognitive effects [31]. Some studies suggest 
that DMT-induced states share similarities with near-death ex-
periences [32], and in some cases, these experiences can lead 
to lasting shifts in beliefs about reality and consciousness [33].

When taken orally, DMT is metabolized in the digestive sys-
tem by monoamine oxidase (MAO), which converts it into an 
inactive form. As a result, DMT is typically consumed in com-
bination with MAO inhibitors, such as those found in the tra-
ditional Amazonian brew, ayahuasca. Ayahuasca contains DMT 
and b-carboline alkaloids, which inhibit MAO, thereby allowing 
DMT to remain active and produce lasting effects. In this form, 
the changes in consciousness typically last between 4 and 6 
hours. Alternatively, DMT can be administered through smok-
ing or parenteral routes, including intravenous or intramus-
cular injections, which produce more immediate effects [29]. 
To date, a single-blind, placebo-controlled study with a sys-
tematic protocol for intravenous DMT administration has been 
conducted with a group of 11 volunteers [29]. Additionally, a 
naturalistic, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 30 
participants at ayahuasca retreats in the Netherlands, Spain, 
and Germany, exploring the effects of the substance on symp-
toms of depression and anxiety [34]. Another double-blind, ran-
domized, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of 
ayahuasca in a group of 29 Brazilian patients with drug-resis-
tant depression, showing promising results [35].

Due to the insufficient quantity and methodological limitations 
of the available research on DMT, and ayahuasca, it is not yet 
possible to draw definitive conclusions regarding their ther-
apeutic potential. As such, the use of DMT in psychotherapy

Clinical Applications

Depression Therapy

Most studies included in this systematic review on the treat-
ment of depression with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy 
focus on psilocybin. In a randomized clinical trial investigat-
ing drug-resistant depression in patients with major depres-
sive disorder, bipolar II disorder, and substance use disorders, 
Rosenblat et al [36] (n=30) found that patients who received 
psilocybin exhibited a significant reduction in depression sever-
ity, compared with a control group. In another study, involving 
patients with a diagnosis of curable or incurable cancer and 
co-occurring severe depression, patients who underwent psilo-
cybin-assisted psychotherapy (n=30) demonstrated a marked 
decrease  in  depressive  symptoms.  Notably,  this  study  used 
group therapy, a form of therapy that is time-efficient and of-
fers the added benefit of being conducted in a group setting, 
in which participants share similar challenges. This structure 
can enhance therapeutic outcomes and improve the efficien-
cy and accessibility of treatment [37]. The efficacy of psilocy-
bin-assisted  psychotherapy  has  also  been  demonstrated  in 
patients with severe depression (n=27) who were not receiv-
ing antidepressant treatment and had no history of psychotic 
disorders, significant suicide attempts, or prior hospitalization. 
However, a key limitation of this study, which was acknowl-
edged by the authors, was that the psychotherapy sessions 
were led by practitioners with varying levels of experience and 
education, including some without formal clinical training [16].

trial conducted by Carhart-Harris et al, which included patients 
(n=20)  with  chronic,  unipolar,  drug-resistant  severe  depres-
sion, demonstrated good treatment tolerability and substan-
tial symptomatic improvement after just 2 sessions of psilocy-
bin treatment, with positive outcomes persisting for 6 months 
after treatment [38]. Similarly, a randomized trial by Gukasyan 
et al, involving individuals with moderate to severe unipolar 
depression (n=27), found that the antidepressant effects of 
psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy  could  last  for  at  least  12 
months following the therapeutic intervention [39].

Despite the still limited number of studies, ketamine-assist-
ed psychotherapy has attracted significant interest among re-
searchers for the treatment of drug-resistant depression. The 
only study included in this review, a randomized proof-of-con-
cept trial involving individuals with a diagnosis of drug-resis-
tant depression (n=42), demonstrated the preliminary utility 
of combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with ketamine 
treatment in this patient population [40].

In summary, psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has shown some 
promising results in treating depression, particularly in drug-re-
sistant cases, with significant symptom reduction lasting up to 
12 months. Studies, including those by Rosenblat et al [36] and 
Agrawal et al [37], have reported positive outcomes in cancer-
related depression and general depression. Psilocybin appears 
to work by modulating serotonin receptors, disrupting nega-
tive neural patterns. Long-term benefits have been confirmed in 
studies like that by Carhart-Harris et al [36], in which improve-
ments persisted for up to 6 months. Despite encouraging re-
sults, limitations such as small sample sizes and variable thera-
pist experience warrant further research to confirm its efficacy.

and LSD, and psychoactive compounds, such as MDMA and 
ketamine. These substances are administered in conjunction 
with  established  psychotherapeutic  approaches  from  tradi-
tional trauma therapy [41] or alongside therapeutic models 
specifically designed for psychedelic-assisted treatment [42]. 
In the treatment of PTSD, strongly recommended psychother-
apeutic interventions include CBT, cognitive processing ther-
apy, cognitive therapy, and prolonged exposure. Conditioned 
recommendations  include  brief  eclectic  psychotherapy,  eye 
movement desensitization and reprocessing, exposure narra-
tive therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, as well as in-
terpersonal psychotherapy. Guidelines for the specificity and 
conduct  of  MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  in  the  treatment 
of PTSD include requirements regarding the preparation and 
competence of the psychotherapist, techniques supporting the 
therapeutic process, session structure at each stage of treat-
ment, and the conditions under which sessions should take 
place. It is recommended that psychotherapists possess ex-
pertise in trauma-informed therapeutic methods, as well as 
competence in using breathing exercises, music, mindfulness-
based techniques, and somatic interventions [42].

Research on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD has gar-
nered considerable interest and offers promising prospects for 
effectively aiding patients. A randomized trial by Mithoefer et 
al [43] (n=26) found that patients who received 75 or 125 mg 
of MDMA, in combination with supportive psychotherapy, ex-
hibited a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared 
with the group receiving a 30-mg dose [43]. Similarly, the study 
by Ot’alora et al [44] (n=28), which compared the efficacy of 
MDMA doses of 100 and 125 mg with a low dose of 40 mg, 
found that the higher-dose group experienced the greatest re-
duction in PTSD symptoms, with a significant number of par-
ticipants maintaining lower symptom levels at 12 months, and 
76% of participants no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria 
for PTSD [44]. A study by van der Kolk et al [45] (n=90) dem-
onstrated that patients receiving MDMA-assisted psychother-
apy showed significantly greater improvement in alexithymia 
than did a control group receiving a placebo. These patients 
also developed higher levels of self-awareness and self-com-
passion, which aligns with studies in non-PTSD patients show-
ing that MDMA facilitates openness, interpersonal connection, 
and enhances positive emotional experiences while reducing 
negative evaluations of distressing memories [45]. The number 
of studies on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for the treat-
ment of PTSD is limited, with most existing research consisting 
of single studies. One such study, an open-label trial involving 
survivors of AIDS, found that psilocybin-assisted psychothera-
py helped reduce symptoms of PTSD, attachment anxiety, and 
demoralization [46]. Also, Khan et al discuss several studies 
suggesting the effectiveness of this form of treatment in con-
fronting traumatic memories, reducing emotional avoidance, 
depression,  anxiety,  pessimism,  and  social  isolation,  while 

simultaneously  increasing  acceptance,  self-compassion,  and 
the capacity to forgive perpetrators of violence [41].

Despite the promising potential of ketamine and LSD in com-
bination with psychotherapy, research in this area remains in-
sufficient. Available studies primarily focus on the effects of 
these substances alone, without incorporating psychothera-
peutic interventions [47].

Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has shown potential in treat-
ing PTSD, with studies demonstrating its effectiveness in re-
ducing symptoms such as attachment anxiety, demoralization, 
and emotional avoidance. It has also been linked to improve-
ments in self-compassion, acceptance, and the ability to con-
front traumatic memories. However, the research in this area 
is limited, with most studies being individual trials rather than 
large-scale investigations. While ketamine and LSD also hold 
promise for PTSD treatment, there is insufficient research on 
their combined use with psychotherapy, as most studies focus 
only on the effects of the substances themselves. More com-
prehensive studies are needed to assess the full therapeutic 
potential of these substances in treating PTSD.

Therapy of Anxiety Disorders

Research on the treatment of anxiety disorders with psyche-
delics remains limited. This review includes studies using LSD 
and MDMA in psychotherapeutic interventions for anxiety dis-
orders. A pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study involving patients (n=12) experiencing anxiety related 
to life-threatening illnesses demonstrated that LSD, when ad-
ministered in a safe, physician-supervised psychotherapeutic 
setting, significantly reduced anxiety levels [8]. Another study 
involving participants (n=39), both with and without terminal 
illnesses, found that LSD-assisted psychotherapy led to a re-
duction in neuroticism and an increase in extroversion, with 
these effects persisting for up to 1 year [48]. In studies inves-
tigating MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, a trial involving pa-
tients (n=12) with autism spectrum disorder experiencing so-
cial anxiety reported significant reductions in anxiety following 
treatment, suggesting that MDMA can support emotional pro-
cessing and social engagement [20].

Research on the use of psychedelics for anxiety disorders is 
still  in  its  early  stages  but  demonstrates  promising  results. 
LSD-assisted  psychotherapy  has  shown  potential  for  reduc-
ing anxiety and improving personality traits in patients with 
both a terminal and non-terminal illness, with lasting effects. 
Similarly, MDMA therapy has proven effective in reducing so-
cial anxiety in individuals with autism. However, larger-scale 
studies  are  needed  to  confirm  these  findings  and  establish 
standardized treatment protocols.

Addiction Therapy

Research on psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy offers prom-
ising avenues for the treatment of substance use disorders, 
although the precise mechanisms underlying its efficacy are 
not always fully understood. A study on psilocybin-assisted 
psychotherapy for nicotine dependence in healthy individu-
als (n=15) highlighted the significance of the mystical experi-
ence induced by the psychedelic, rather than the direct phar-
macological effects of the substance or the psychotherapeutic 
process itself. In this trial, 2 or 3 doses of psilocybin combined 
with CBT led to 80% of participants achieving smoking cessa-
tion, with success correlated to higher scores on measures of 
psilocybin-induced mystical experiences [49].

Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy has also demonstrated ef-
ficacy in the context of heroin addiction treatment. In a study 
involving detoxified patients with heroin dependence (n=59), 
participants received either a single ketamine-assisted therapy 
session prior to discharge or additional sessions of ketamine-
assisted  psychotherapy  combined  with  addiction  counsel-
ing (n=25). The comparison group (n=27) underwent addic-
tion counseling alone. After 1 year, 50% of participants in the 
ketamine-assisted group remained abstinent, compared with 
22.2% in the counseling-only group [50].

Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy demonstrates preliminary 
potential in addressing substance use disorders, but its effi-
cacy  and  safety  require  further  validation.  Psilocybin  thera-
py, while associated with high smoking cessation rates, relies 
heavily on subjective mystical experiences, raising concerns 
about reproducibility and the individual variability of such ef-
fects. Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy has shown promise in 
enhancing abstinence rates among individuals with heroin ad-
diction; however, the study sample sizes are small, and long-
term safety and generalizability remain uncertain. Importantly, 
these interventions should be approached cautiously due to 
potential risks, including the possibility of psychological dis-
tress, adverse reactions, or misuse of the substances. Overall, 
while these initial findings are encouraging, they highlight the 
need for larger, methodologically rigorous trials to assess both 
the efficacy and safety of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy 
in addiction treatment.

Therapy of OCD

One of the studies we reviewed examined the application of 
ketamine-assisted psychotherapy in treating OCD. Rodriguez 
et al [51] investigated the administration of ketamine in com-
bination with a brief course of 10 cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) sessions designed to extend the effects of the psyche-
delic and sustain symptom improvement for up to 2 weeks. 
The study leveraged ketamine’s potential to enhance neural 

plasticity and facilitate the extinction of compulsive behav-
iors. Results from the study group (n=8) demonstrated a rap-
id reduction in OCD symptoms following ketamine administra-
tion and highlighted the supportive role of psychotherapeutic 
interventions in maintaining these effects. However, the ab-
sence of randomization significantly limits the reliability and 
generalizability of the findings [52].

Preliminary research on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for 
OCD suggests promising results, with evidence pointing to rap-
id symptom reduction and potential enhancement of therapeu-
tic effects when combined with CBT. The findings underscore 
ketamine’s potential to promote neural plasticity, offering a 
novel approach to address treatment-resistant OCD. However, 
the small sample size and lack of randomization in the study 
raise critical concerns about the robustness and applicability 
of the results. Safety considerations, including ketamine’s po-
tential for misuse or adverse effects, must also be thoroughly 
addressed. These findings, while encouraging, remain prelim-
inary and highlight the need for rigorously designed studies 
to confirm the efficacy and safety of ketamine-assisted psy-
chotherapy in OCD treatment.

Conditions for Conducting the Session

A fundamental element in conducting sessions as part of psy-
chedelic-assisted psychotherapy is the creation of a safe and 
supportive environment by the therapeutic team. Experimental 
sessions must occur in settings that minimize external distur-
bances, such as noise or other distracting stimuli, ensuring an 
atmosphere conducive to introspection and emotional safe-
ty [8]. The provision of basic needs, such as access to water, 
snacks, and artistic tools for non-verbal expression, is essen-
tial for patient comfort and well-being [42]. The environment 
should be aesthetically pleasing, equipped with comfortable 
seating or couches, allowing patients to focus on their inter-
nal experiences. Additional aids, such as music, headphones, 
and  eye  masks,  can  further  facilitate  introspection  and  en-
gagement with emerging mental and physical sensations [16].

From the psychotherapeutic perspective, the therapeutic alli-
ance – defined as the relationship of trust and collaboration 
between therapist and patient – plays a central role in cre-
ating a secure therapeutic context [52]. This bond supports 
the reduction of anxiety related to challenging memories, en-
hances  self-compassion,  and  fosters  openness  to  exploring 
thoughts,  feelings,  and  experiences.  Studies  indicate  that  a 
strong therapeutic alliance significantly contributes to treat-
ment outcomes in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. For in-
stance, research on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for de-
pression found that a robust therapeutic alliance shortly after 
treatment  predicted  sustained  improvements  in  depressive

symptoms over follow-up periods of up to 1 year [53]. To fos-
ter this alliance, therapists are encouraged to adopt a neutral, 
mindful, and open stance, approaching the patient’s experienc-
es with curiosity and respect. Such an approach builds trust 
and safety, which are vital for supporting the patient’s inter-
nal processes and fostering the psychological coherence con-
ducive to self-healing [44].

Although early findings underscore the importance of a safe 
environment and a strong therapeutic alliance in psychedel-
ic-assisted psychotherapy, the method remains experimental. 
Its therapeutic efficacy, long-term risks, and appropriate safe-
ty protocols are not yet fully understood, necessitating further 
research. Standardized protocols, including clear inclusion cri-
teria and contraindications, are critical to minimize risks and 
ensure patient safety. Until these gaps are addressed, psyche-
delic-assisted psychotherapy cannot be regarded as an estab-
lished treatment method but should be strictly confined to re-
search contexts.

Summary of Current Knowledge on the 
Course of Psychedelic Psychotherapy

At the initial stage of the therapeutic application of psyche-
delics in treating mental disorders, psychoanalytic and psy-
chodynamic approaches – focused on unconscious processes 
and accessing psychic depth – predominated. As Grof noted, 
“The  phenomenology  of  the  psychodynamic  experiences  in 
LSD sessions is to a large extent in agreement with the basic 
concepts of classical psychoanalysis… Observations from LSD 
psychotherapy could be considered laboratory proof of the ba-
sic Freudian premises” [54,55]. However, despite the potential 
of psychoanalytically derived approaches, their role has dimin-
ished over time [56]. This decline coincided with the devel-
opment of structured psychotherapeutic paradigms ground-
ed in biological sciences, which now attract greater interest 
from researchers [55].

Regardless of the substance administered, psychedelic-assist-
ed psychotherapy follows 3 core stages: (1) preparation, (2) 
administration of the psychedelic substance, and (3) integra-
tion. The preparatory phase involves gathering patient infor-
mation, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and preparing par-
ticipants for the experimental session. During the substance 
administration phase, the psychotherapist provides support 
in navigating difficult emotions, processing traumatic memo-
ries, and reframing their meaning. This phase is conducted in 
safe and controlled settings, with the therapist encouraging 
emotional exploration and reflection. The integration stage, 
conducted in the following weeks without medication, focus-
es on helping patients understand and incorporate their psy-
chedelic experiences into daily life. This process aims to foster 

intrapsychic insight, symptom reduction, and improved func-
tioning [38,42,56,57].

Yaden et al [55] suggest that this structured approach aligns 
closely  with  CBT  models,  including  derivatives  such  as  dia-
lectical  behavioral  therapy  (DBT)  and  acceptance  and  com-
mitment  therapy  (ACT).  These  approaches  offer  established 
frameworks for addressing dysfunctional cognitive schemas, 
regulating emotions, and enhancing psychological flexibility 
[58,59]. For instance, during preparation, therapists can use 
psychoeducation, self-monitoring (CBT), pre-treatment strat-
egies, and skills training (DBT). During the substance adminis-
tration phase, techniques such as mindfulness, distress toler-
ance (DBT), cognitive restructuring (CBT), and present-moment 
awareness (ACT) are utilized. Integration can include teaching 
adaptive behaviors, assigning behavioral experiments (CBT), 
cultivating a dialectical stance (DBT), and fostering commit-
ted action and self-as-context (ACT). These methods aim to 
enhance  therapeutic  outcomes  while  adhering  to  evidence-
based principles [55].

Other psychotherapeutic modalities used in psychedelic treat-
ment include interpersonal psychotherapy, Frankl’s logothera-
py, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [60]. A growing 
number of guidelines provide theoretical assumptions, prac-
tical recommendations, and clinical examples to assist spe-
cialists in safely conducting psychedelic-assisted psychother-
apy [42,60,61].

While  structured  psychotherapeutic  models  offer  promising 
frameworks for integrating psychedelics into therapy, these 
approaches  remain  investigational.  The  therapeutic  context 
of psychedelic-assisted interventions requires stringent safety 
protocols, robust inclusion criteria, and a comprehensive un-
derstanding of contraindications to protect patients from po-
tential risks. The current evidence is preliminary, and the long-
term effects, risks, and critical factors influencing outcomes 
remain largely unexplored. Consequently, psychedelic-assisted 
psychotherapy should not yet be regarded as an established 
therapeutic method and must remain confined to rigorously 
controlled research settings.

Safety and Ethical Considerations

Psychiatrists remain skeptical of psychedelic-assisted psycho-
therapy, often expressing caution in offering it to patients [62]. 
Addressing this skepticism requires further studies designed 
with rigorous methodology, including multicenter trials with 
diverse patient populations. One potential advantage of psy-
chedelics in psychiatric treatment is their novel mechanism of 
action, which can provide solutions in cases in which conven-
tional treatments have failed. Another notable benefit is the

rapid onset of therapeutic effects. For example, while SSRIs 
often require several weeks to show benefits, esketamine can 
produce improvements within a day [63]. Additionally, due to 
their probable impact on neuroplasticity, psychedelics often 
result in long-lasting therapeutic effects.

The use of psychedelics is associated with relatively low risks 
of physical adverse effects. However, their potential dangers 
should not be overlooked. These include the risk of addiction, 
or  addictive  behaviors,  unpredictable  psychological  effects, 
and the potential to induce psychosis-like experiences. Case 
reports also suggest that psychedelics could exacerbate men-
tal health conditions, such as triggering PTSD in some individ-
uals [64]. Given the limited number of randomized, double-
blind trials, it remains challenging to definitively assess the 
safety and efficacy of psychedelics in psychiatry. Further re-
search is needed to balance the potential benefits and risks 
of these substances. It is crucial to recognize that psychedel-
ics are not standalone treatments but tools that must be in-
tegrated into broader therapeutic frameworks.

Psychedelics represent a promising but experimental avenue 
in psychiatric care. While early findings suggest rapid and sus-
tained benefits in certain mental health conditions, substantial 
uncertainties about their safety, addiction potential, and psy-
chological risks persist. Establishing rigorous research proto-
cols and exploring their use in combination with established 
therapies are critical next steps. Psychedelics should currently 
remain confined to controlled experimental settings, as their 
benefits and risks are not yet fully understood, and their appli-
cation in psychiatry demands a cautious and evidence-based 
approach. The potential clinical applications of the described 
substances in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy are summa-
rized in Table 2. It is important to recognize several limitations 
that can affect the overall findings. First, the variability in study 
designs across trials must be acknowledged, as differences in 
methodology, sample characteristics, and intervention proto-
cols  can  hinder  the  comparability  of  results.  This  variability 
can contribute to discrepancies in the reported effectiveness 
of psychedelic substances in treating mental health conditions.

Additionally, potential biases, such as selection bias, reporting 
bias, and confirmation bias, need to be considered. These bi-
ases can significantly influence the validity of study outcomes, 
skewing the results and potentially leading to overestimation 
of the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics. For instance, stud-
ies with small sample sizes or lack of randomization can be 
more prone to such biases, affecting the strength and reliabil-
ity of the conclusions drawn.

Furthermore,  the  generalizability  of  the  findings  remains  a 
critical concern. The applicability of results to diverse popula-
tions – especially those with different demographic character-
istics, comorbidities, or cultural backgrounds – should be care-
fully examined. As most trials to date have involved relatively 
homogenous study groups, it is unclear how these findings 
would translate to broader, more varied patient populations.

Acknowledging these limitations is essential for a more com-
prehensive understanding of the state of research on psyche-
delic-assisted psychotherapy. By doing so, we aim in this review 
to provide a balanced perspective on both the potential and 
the challenges of integrating psychedelics into clinical practice.

Key Conclusions on Psychedelic-Assisted 
Psychotherapy and Navigating the Future 
of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy: Research, 
Ethics, and Clinical Practice

Experimental Nature of the Method

Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy remains an experimental 
approach. While preliminary studies suggest potential therapeu-
tic benefits in treating conditions like depression, PTSD, OCD, 
and substance use disorders, the lack of a sufficient number 
of randomized, controlled, and multicenter trials makes it dif-
ficult to definitively assess its efficacy and safety.

Importance of Patient Safety

Need for Rigorous Research

Ensuring patient safety is paramount in the use of psychedel-
ics. Implementing strict protocols for inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is necessary, alongside the establishment of comprehen-
sive guidelines to mitigate risks and manage adverse effects.

Future research must prioritize high-quality studies with ro-
bust methodologies. This includes randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials on diverse populations to generate 
reliable and generalizable findings.

Uncertain Risk Factors

Therapeutic Alliance and Setting

Key risk factors and long-term consequences of psychedelic-
assisted therapy are not yet fully understood. The unpredict-
able nature of psychedelic experiences and potential adverse 
effects, such as psychosis-like symptoms or even post-trau-
matic stress induced by hallucinogens, underscore the need 
for caution.

The  therapeutic  alliance  and  controlled  setting  are  critical 
components  of  psychedelic-assisted  therapy.  Safe  and  sup-
portive environments, along with a strong therapist-patient 
relationship,  significantly  influence  the  therapeutic  process 
and outcomes.

Rapid and Long-Lasting Effects

Integration with Other Therapies

Psychedelics should not be viewed as standalone treatments 
but rather as tools to be integrated into broader psychother-
apeutic  frameworks,  such  as  CBT  or  mindfulness-based  ap-
proaches, to enhance treatment outcomes.

Some psychedelics, such as esketamine and psilocybin, have 
shown rapid therapeutic effects, often within hours or days, 
compared with conventional treatments like SSRIs. Additionally, 
their  impact  on  neuroplasticity  can  contribute  to  sustained 
benefits.

Potential for Unique Mechanisms of Action

Cautious Optimism for Future Applications

The distinctive mechanisms of action of psychedelics, partic-
ularly their ability to influence neuroplasticity, suggest they 
could fill treatment gaps for patients who do not respond to 
conventional therapies. However, this potential requires fur-
ther validation through rigorous research.

While early results are promising and suggest that psychedelics 
can play a transformative role in psychiatry, their use should 
be approached with cautious optimism. Comprehensive stud-
ies and well-defined clinical protocols are essential to ensure 
their safe and effective integration into mental health care.

Ethical and Clinical Challenges

Department and Institution Where Work Was Done

The therapeutic use of psychedelics raises ethical and clinical 
challenges, including ensuring informed consent, understand-
ing cultural implications, and addressing the stigma associat-
ed with these substances.
