Abstract
Background  Research on health anxiety has bloomed in recent years, but summaries of the literature are 
complicated by the use of dissimilar self-report questionnaires. Furthermore, these instruments have rarely been 
administered in parallel, and especially not in clinical samples. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship 
between five widespread health anxiety measures, and to draft guidelines for the conversion of different sum scores.

Methods  Clinical trial participants with principal pathological health anxiety (n = 335) and a sample of healthy 
volunteers (n = 88) completed the 14-item Whiteley Index (WI-14), the Illness Attitude Scale (IAS), and the 14-, 18-, 
and 64-item Health Anxiety Inventory (the HAI-64, HAI-18, and HAI-14). Cross-sectional data from all participants were 
pooled (N = 423) and we conducted a joint factor analysis and approximate equipercentile linking of the WI-14, IAS, 
HAI-64, HAI-18, and HAI-14.

Results  Inter-scale correlations were high (rs ≥ 0.90 and ≥ 0.88 in adjusted analyses), and the scree plot of the joint 
factor analysis spoke for a unifactorial solution where 89/105 items (85%) had loadings ≥ 0.40. Most items at the core 
of this broad trait health anxiety factor pertained to the worry about health, the fear of having or developing a serious 
disease, and to some extent bodily preoccupation. We present a cross-walk table of observed equipercentile linked 
sum scores.

Conclusions  This study speaks clearly in favor of the WI-14, IAS, HAI-64, HAI-18, and HAI-14 all tapping into the same 
trait health anxiety construct, the core of which appears to concern the worry about health, the fear of having or 
developing a serious disease, and to some extent bodily preoccupation. Based on recently reported cut-offs for the

HAI-14, a reasonable cutoff for pathological health anxiety in a psychiatric setting probably lies around 7–8 on the 
WI-14, 52–53 on the IAS, 82–83 on the HAI-64, and 26–27 on the HAI-18.

Introduction
Health  anxiety  is  a  multifaceted  psychological  trait  that 
is primarily characterized by a fear of, or preoccupation 
with,  having  or  developing  a  serious  health  condition 
such as terminal cancer, a severe cardiovascular disease, 
or  a  progressive  neurological  disorder  [1].  Higher  levels 
of trait health anxiety commonly imply increased anxiety 
sensitivity  and  intolerance  of  uncertainty  [2],  increased 
bodily preoccupation [3], increased frequency and inten-
sity of behaviors aimed at reducing health anxiety in the 
short term [4], and a more pronounced fear of death [5]. 
In the general population, trait health anxiety varies on a 
continuum,  from  benign  levels  of  concern  about  health, 
to pathological health anxiety that is both recurrent and 
excessive  [6–9].  Based  on  its  clinical  characteristics, 
pathological health anxiety can be considered a de facto 
anxiety or perhaps obsessive-compulsive spectrum disor-
der [2, 10–14].

Over  the  past  decades,  research  focusing  on  health 
anxiety  has  been  growing  rapidly  for  several  reasons; 
one being the relative success of the cognitive-behavioral 
framework  in  guiding  treatment  efforts  and  promot-
ing interest in experimental work [11, 15]. Other factors 
sparking  an  interest  in  health  anxiety  include  a  rise  in 
work  focusing  on  the  role  of  information  technology  in 
exacerbating  health  concerns  [16],  emergent  discrepan-
cies  in  widespread  diagnostic  taxonomies  [14,  17],  and 
an increased interest in the role of psychological factors 
in somatic disease including covid-19 [18, 19]. However, 
an  obstacle  to  the  interpretation  of  this  increasingly 
diverse  research  field  is  that  a  large  number  of  different 
trait health anxiety measures are in circulation, and that 
these  are  not  easily  compared.  Thus,  it  is  often  difficult 
to  determine  whether  participants  of  different  studies 
suffer from similar levels of trait health anxiety, and if so, 
whether these levels are indicative of pathological health 
anxiety.

Self-report  measures  of  trait  health  anxiety  have 
existed  since  the  mid-1960s.  The  14-item  Whiteley 
Index  with  dichotomous  (“yes”/”no”)  items  (WI-14)  was 
developed  based  on  hospital  staff  definitions  of  “hypo-
chondriasis”  [20].  Its  psychometric  properties  are  usu-
ally  found  to  be  acceptable  but  not  ideal,  and  revised 
versions  with  Likert-type  items  are  now  more  common 
[21].  The  Illness  Attitude  Scale  (IAS;  and  sometimes 
referred  to  in  the  plural)  was  probably  the  most  widely 
used measure of trait health anxiety from about the late 

1980s to the early 2000s [22], and was developed on the 
basis  of  statements  by  patients  who  exhibited  abnormal 
illness behavior or believed they had an undiagnosed dis-
ease  [23].  Its  psychometric  properties  are  usually  found 
to be good, though the factor structure is disputed [24]. 
The  Health  Anxiety  Inventory  [1]  is  perhaps  the  most 
widely  used  self-report  measure  of  trait  health  anxiety 
today, and exists in many forms, the three most common 
probably being the 64-, 18-, and 14-item versions (HAI-
64, HAI-18, and HAI-14). This questionnaire was devel-
oped to capture the cognitive and emotional components 
of  DSM-IV  hypochondriasis  which  was  the  prototypi-
cal  pathological  health  anxiety  diagnosis  up  until  2013. 
Common versions of the Health Anxiety Inventory are all 
widely believed to possess good to excellent psychomet-
ric properties [1, 25]. In a recent study, a cutoff of 22 on 
the  HAI-14  was  found  to  be  appropriate  for  identifying 
patients with pathological health anxiety in the psychiat-
ric setting [26]. When the respondent is known to suffer 
from pathological health anxiety, a score of 28 or higher 
is indicative of moderate symptoms, and 33 of substantial 
symptoms  [26].  In  summary,  the  WI-14,  IAS,  HAI-64, 
HAI-18 and HAI-14 are all examples of widespread mea-
sures  of  trait  health  anxiety,  but  knowledge  about  how 
scores can be converted from one measure to another is 
lacking.

In  this  study,  we  aimed  to  investigate  the  relationship 
between  the  WI-14,  IAS,  HAI-64,  HAI-18,  and  HAI-14 
using a composite dataset derived from two clinical trials 
for  pathological  health  anxiety  and  a  sample  of  healthy 
volunteers. In a joint factor analysis, we aimed to test our 
hypothesis that the scales would be highly correlated and 
tap  into  the  same  latent  trait  health  anxiety  construct. 
Should such a broad latent trait health anxiety factor be 
present,  we  aimed  to  determine  what  cognitive,  emo-
tional,  and  behavioral  characteristics  that  lie  at  the  core 
of this factor. Furthermore, we intended to relate the sum 
scores of the WI-14, IAS, HAI-64, HAI-18, and HAI-14 
by  means  of  equipercentile  linking.  Using  the  resulting 
linking table, we intended to make use of recently devel-
oped guidelines for interpreting the HAI-14 [26] so as to 
draw conclusions about approximate cut-offs and guide-
lines for interpreting severity in terms of the WI-14, IAS, 
HAI-64, and HAI-18.

developing a serious disease. In this study, internal con-
sistency was excellent for the sum scales of all versions of 
the Health Anxiety Inventory, i.e., the HAI-64 (α = 0.99), 
HAI-18 (α = 0.97), and HAI-14 (α = 0.97). On the IAS, 27 
items  are  each  scored  0–4,  and  responses  indicate  the 
frequency  of  various  experiences  pertaining  to  “worry 
about  illness”,  “concerns  about  pain”,  “health  habits”, 
“hypochondriacal  beliefs”,  “tanatophobia”,  “disease  pho-
bia”, “bodily preoccupations”, “treatment experience”, and 
“effects of symptoms”, giving the sum score a theoretical 
range of 0-108. The internal consistency of the IAS in this 
study  was  excellent  (α = 0.97).  On  the  WI-14,  each  item 
is  scored  0  (“no”)  or  1  (“yes”),  resulting  in  a  theoretical 
range of 0–14. The internal consistency of the WI-14 in 
this study was excellent (α = 0.94).

Statistical analysis

We  conducted  all  statistical  analyses  in  Stata  15.1.  First, 
we  validated  that  the  trait  health  anxiety  scales  mea-
sured the latent construct, and were suitable for equipe-
rcentile  linking.  We  calculated  Pearson  correlations  and 
conducted a joint factor analysis of all (64 + 27 + 14 = 105) 
items,  based  on  principal  axis  factoring  with  promax 
rotation.  Considering  that  we  expected  factor  loadings 
to  be  strong,  factors  to  be  few,  and  there  to  be  many 
items  per  factor,  we  regarded  the  sample  size  of  423  as 
sufficient  for  this  purpose  [32,  33].  Because  the  HAI-64 
is considerably longer than the IAS and WI-14, as a sen-
sitivity  analysis,  we  also  conducted  a  secondary  factor 
analysis that only included the items of the HAI-14, IAS, 
and  WI-14.  When  we  had  established  that  all  question-
naires  tapped  into  the  same  latent  trait  health  anxiety 
construct, we proceeded to equipercentile linking of the 
WI-14,  IAS,  HAI-64,  HAI-18,  and  HAI-14.  Equipercen-
tile linking is a procedure whereby scores on scales mea-
suring the same thing are linked by means of percentiles, 
so that scores on two scales are assumed to be equivalent 
if they correspond to the same percentile of each respec-
tive scale distribution. As is commonly done for discrete 
scales [34], we defined the percentile of each score as the 
percentage of participants scoring below that score, plus 
the  percentage  of  participants  having  exactly  that  score 
divided by two. We linked sum scores in the ranges that 
were  observed  (represented  in  the  sample),  and  based 
on  presmoothed  frequency  distributions  that  allowed 
us  to  model  all  sum  scores  (including  those  not  directly 
observed) within each such range. As a sensitivity analy-
sis, we also report linked sum scores based on observed 
(non-smoothed)  frequency  distributions  as  supplemen-
tary material.

Methods
Design

This  was  a  psychometric  study  based  on  cross-sectional 
data from a composite aduld sample (pooled N = 423) of 
335  adult  participants  of  two  clinical  trials  of  cognitive 
behavior therapy for pathological health anxiety [27, 28] 
and 88 healthy volunteers recruited via newspaper adver-
tisements  [29].  Notably,  the  two  clinical  trials  included 
336  participants  but  1  was  dropped  from  the  present 
study  due  to  missing  WI-14  data.  This  study  was  a  col-
laboration between Gustavsberg Primary Care Clinic and 
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. All procedures 
were  approved  by  the  regional  ethics  review  board  of 
Stockholm (2013/375 − 31/5, 2014/1530-31/2), all partici-
pants  gave  informed  consent  to  participate  in  research, 
and both clinical trials were preregistered at ClinicalTri-
als.gov (NCT01966705, NCT02314065).

Procedure

All  participants  in  the  clinical  trials  exhibited  a  fear  of, 
or  preoccupation  with,  severe  illness  and  met  full  crite-
ria for a principal diagnosis of DSM-5 somatic symptom 
disorder  or  illness  anxiety  disorder  as  determined  by  a 
clinical  psychologist  aided  by  the  Health  Preoccupation 
Diagnostic  Interview  [HPDI;  30]  and  the  Mini-Interna-
tional  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  [MINI;  31]. The  main 
exclusion criteria were a serious somatic condition, a sub-
stance use disorder, a psychotic disorder, a bipolar disor-
der,  severe  depression,  and  recurrent  suicidal  ideation. 
The healthy volunteers were assessed using the MINI and 
included only if found to be healthy. Prior to the eligibil-
ity  interview,  all  423  participants  (both  the  clinical  trial 
participants  and  the  healthy  volunteers),  completed  the 
self-report trait health anxiety measures as listed below.

Outcomes

We  administered  the  HAI-64,  IAS,  and  WI-14  online 
in  Swedish,  using  previously  evaluated  translations  [1, 
20,  23,  29].  Participants  completed  the  questionnaires 
via  their  web  browser,  with  black  text  on  white  back-
ground  and  radio  buttons  to  mark  responses.  On  the 
HAI-64, each of the 64 items renders a score of 0–3 and 
the respondent is encouraged to select one of four state-
ments that best corresponds to their level of trait health 
anxiety (e.g., from “I do not worry about my health” to “I 
spend most of my time worrying about my health”). In this 
study,  the  HAI-64  had  a  theoretical  range  of  0-192  and 
was  also  rescored  as  the  HAI-18  with  a  range  of  0–54, 
and  the  HAI-14  with  a  range  of  0–42,  so  as  to  enable 
approximate  linking.  The  main  difference,  besides  the 
number  of  items,  between  the  HAI-14  on  the  one  hand 
and the HAI-64 and HAI-18 on the other, is that the lat-
ter  versions  include  a  “negative  consequences”  subscale, 
which measures the perceived negative consequences of

Results
Sample characteristics

The  pathological  health  anxiety  participants  completed 
their  questionnaires  between  December  4th  2013  and 
March  22nd  2014  (n = 131),  and  December  10th  2014 
and March 15th 2017 (n = 204), in each respective clinical 
trial,  and  the  healthy  volunteers  completed  their  ques-
tionnaires between March 19th 2014 and June 3rd 2014 
(n = 88).  A  typical  pathological  health  anxiety  partici-
pant  was  a  38  years  old  (SD = 12)  female  (240/335,  72%) 
with  a  tertiary  education  (259/335,  77%)  who  scored  in 
the  moderate  pathological  range  of  trait  health  anxiety 
(Table 1). In this subsample, 64/335 (19%) had comorbid 
depression and 207/335 (62%) met full criteria for at least 
one comorbid anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress dis-
order, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. A typical healthy 

volunteer  was  a  49  years  old  (SD = 18)  female  (59/88, 
67%)  with  a  tertiary  education  (80/88,  91%)  who  scored 
low on trait health anxiety (Table 1). None of the healthy 
volunteers  was  found  to  meet  criteria  for  a  psychiatric 
disorder.  In  the  pooled  sample  (N = 423),  the  distribu-
tion  of  trait  health  anxiety  scores  covered  most  but  not 
all theoretically possible sum scores (the WI-14 being the 
exception where all scores, 0–14, were observed; see the 
supplementary material for details).

Joint factor analysis and feasibility of equipercentile 
linking

In  the  pooled  sample,  Pearson  correlations  between 
the  trait  health  anxiety  measures  were  all  high  (≥ 0.90 
and ≥ 0.88 in adjusted analyses; Table 2) and the Kaiser-
Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic was indicative of adequate 
sampling (0.98). Joint factor analysis of the HAI-64, IAS, 
and WI-14 pointed to one factor being clearly dominant, 
as  is  illustrated  in  the  scree  plot  in  Figure  S1.  All  three 
scales  contributed  with  items  that  received  factor  load-
ings  in  at  least  the  high  0.80s.  The  common  theme  of 
these core items appeared to be worry about health and 
the fear of having or developing a serious disease, nota-
ble examples being HAI-64 #8 (i.e., HAI-14 and HAI-18 
#5: “I am […] afraid that I have a serious illness”), IAS #1 
(“Do you worry about your health?“), and WI-14 #1 and 
#4  (“Do  you  often  worry  about  the  possibility  that  you 
have  got  a  serious  illness?“,  “Do  you  worry  a  lot  about 
your  health?“).  Weak  items  were  primarily  found  in  the 
HAI-64  Negative  Consequences  (NC)  subset  (i.e.,  #48 
onwards), and were primarily items that concerned social 
interaction  in  the  case  of  serious  illness  (Tables  S1  and 
S2). When two factors were retained in the analysis, most 
of the 17 NC items mapped onto a relatively weak second 

Axelsson et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:658 Page 5 of 13

factor  (Tables  S3  and  S4).  Overall,  however,  this  factor 
analysis indicated that the WI-14, IAS, HAI-64, HAI-18, 
and HAI-14 tap into one and the same strong trait health 
anxiety  factor  as  their  primary  source  of  variance,  and 
results  were  similar  when  the  factor  analysis  included 
the items of the WI-14, IAS, and HAI-14 only (Figure S2, 
Tables S5 and S6).

Equipercentile linking of trait health anxiety sum scores

Because  all  trait  health  anxiety  scales  appeared  to  be 
closely  associated,  we  proceeded  to  equipercentile  link-
ing of their sum scores. Table 3 can be used for approxi-
mate  linking  of  sum  scores  on  the  WI-14,  IAS,  HAI-64, 
HAI-18,  and  HAI-14.  With  the  help  of  Table  3,  each 
trait health anxiety score that was observed in the pres-
ent  study  can  be  linked  to  its  percentile,  which  in  turn 
can  be  linked  to  a  score  on  another  trait  health  anxiety 
scale. Thus, for example, a score of 22 on the HAI-14 cor-
responds  to  approximately  26–27  on  the  HAI-18.  Link-
ing  based  on  non-presmoothed  frequency  distributions 
resulted in relatively similar outcomes.

Discussion
This  study  was  an  unusual  attempt  at  a  joint  analysis  of 
five  common  trait  health  anxiety  self-report  question-
naires. We found that the WI-14, IAS, HAI-64, HAI-18, 
and  HAI-14  all  loaded  heavily  on  the  same  broad  latent 
trait  health  anxiety  factor,  as  illustrated  by  the  fact  that 
out  of  105  items  in  total,  35  had  loadings ≥ 0.80  and  89 
had loadings ≥ 0.40. A strength of the present study is that 
all non-healthy participants had pathological health anxi-
ety  as  opposed  to  other  primary  psychopathologies,  so 
that a clear gradient in trait health anxiety, without sub-
stantial  interference  of  partially  overlapping  constructs 
such  as  somatic  disease  and  panic  disorder  symptoms, 
could be modelled for the purpose of factor analysis and 
the  linking  of  sum  scores.  The  strong  unifactorial  solu-
tion  seen  in  this  study  speaks  in  favor  of  the  linking  of 
sum scores derived from the WI-14, IAS, HAI-64, HAI-
18, and HAI-14.

Based  on  estimates  derived  from  the  cross-walk  table 
(Table 3), an HAI-14 cutoff of 22 to screen for pathologi-
cal  health  anxiety  in  the  psychiatric  setting  [26]  corre-
sponds to a score of ca. 26–27 on the HAI-18, 82–83 on 
the  HAI-64,  52–53  on  the  IAS,  and  7–8  on  the  WI-14. 
These tentative cutoffs are slightly higher than those pre-
viously reported [35], most probably because the present 
estimates  are  derived  from  an  analysis  where  consecu-
tive  psychiatric  patients  constituted  the  reference  group 
[26]  whereas  previous  estimates  were  derived  from  a 
study  that  employed  a  more  pragmatic  reference  group 
[35].  In  respondents  with  confirmed  pathological  health 
anxiety, based on the recent suggestion that scores below 
28 on the HAI-14 are indicative of mild symptoms [26], 

the same could be said of scores below ca. 33–34 on the 
HAI-18, 105–106 on the HAI-64, 67–68 on the IAS, and 
10–11  on  the  WI-14.  Similar  to  scores  of  at  least  33  on 
the HAI-14 [26], symptoms are probably to be regarded 
substantial  even  within  the  clinical  range  if  the  respon-
dent scores at least ca. 40–41 on the HAI-18, 128–129 on 
the HAI-64, 80–81 on the IAS, or 12–13 on the WI-14. 
These approximate conversions and rule of thumb guide-
lines  for  the  interpretation  of  scores  derived  from  com-
mon  trait  health  anxiety  scales  could  be  of  use  both  in 
research and the clinic.

In  this  study,  items  that  pertained  to  worrying  about 
health  and  fearing  the  prospect  of  having  or  develop-
ing a serious disease were at the heart of the trait health 
anxiety construct. One implication of this finding is that, 
should  a  minimal  set  of  questions  be  used  for  the  pur-
pose  of  identifying  individuals  with  pathological  health 
anxiety, for example by the general practitioner or as part 
of  a  screening  procedure,  these  questions  should  ideally 
focus on worrying about health and the fear of having or 
developing a serious disease. Thus, for example, it would 
probably be more fruitful to ask “Would you say that you 
worry a lot about your health, and the possibility of hav-
ing  a  serious  disease?”  than  to  ask  about  repeated  doc-
tor  shopping  or  other  aspects  of  the  trait  health  anxiety 
construct.  Importantly,  this  view  of  health  worries  and 
the fear of disease as the core of the trait health anxiety 
construct contrasts with certain widespread conceptual-
izations of pathological health anxiety, such as the ICD-
11 hypochondriasis diagnosis, which focuses more on the 
presence  of  excessive  health-related  behaviors.  Results 
for bodily preoccupation were mixed, and our impression 
is that items tapping into worry such as IAS #20 (“When 
you notice a sensation in your body, do you find it difficult 
to  think  of  something  else?”,  0.90–0.94)  had  substantial 
factor  loadings  whereas  items  that  conceived  of  bodily 
preoccupation  in  terms  of  perceptual  changes  or  “being 
aware” of the body only had slightly weaker or even mod-
est  loadings  (e.g.,  HAI-64  #3:  “I  am  constantly  aware  of 
bodily  sensations  or  changes”,  0.74–0.75;  WI-14  #3:  “Do 
you  find  that  you  are  often  aware  of  various  things  hap-
pening in your body?”, 0.53–0.58). Items pertaining to the 
fear  of  death  (IAS  #13–14)  showed  mixed  results  in  the 
0.59–0.78 range, thus only partly corroborating the com-
mon view that the fear of death is an integral component 
of  pathological  health  anxiety  [5,  36].  Interestingly,  not 
responding to medical reassurance (IAS #11, WI-14 #10), 
which used to be a criterion for hypochondriasis during 
the DSM-IV era, had relatively weak loadings (0.50–0.59). 
One  possible  explanation  for  this  is  that  these  medi-
cal reassurance items were phrased in a manner that led 
participants  to  reply  based  on  whether  they  usually  feel 
reassured in the very short term, as opposed to whether 
this reduction tends to persist for a longer period of time

(“When  your  doctor  tells  you  that  you  have  no  physical 
disease  to  account  for  your  symptoms,  do  you  refuse  to 
believe him?”, “Is it hard for you to believe the doctor when 
he tells you there is nothing for you to worry about?”). The 
focus on this short time frame is unfortunate, considering 
that the cognitive-behavioral view of pathological health 
anxiety would contend that it is not so much the lack of 
a short-term reduction in anxiety that is characteristic of 
this clinical problem, but rather the reduced likelihood of 
a reduction in health anxiety being maintained over time 
[e.g., 37, 38]. Generally speaking, many items pertaining 
to  overt  behaviors  such  as  symptom  checking,  reassur-
ance seeking, and various avoidance behaviors were also 
in the lower range, highlighting that whereas high levels 
of  trait  health  anxiety  always  imply  an  increased  fear  of 
or  preoccupation  with  having  or  developing  a  serious 
disease,  different  individuals  engage  in  different  behav-
iors in the hope of reducing or managing this problem in 
the  short  term  [4].  For  example,  an  individual  worrying 
about skin cancer may be more inclined to “examine [his 
or her] body for disease” (IAS #9), than an individual wor-
rying about a severe congenital heart defect or pancreatic 
cancer. Interestingly, both being afraid of seeking health 
care (HAI-64 #22) and the inclination to seek healthcare 
(IAS #23 and #24) loaded on the same latent trait health 
anxiety trait which corroborates the previous finding that 
both patterns are common, and may even be found in the 
same  individual  and  fluctuate  over  time  [39].  Abnormal 
health  behaviors  are  probably  important  for  trait  health 
anxiety,  but  measuring  these  using  specific  examples 
results in clear psychometric challenges.

We  are  aware  of  one  previous  study  where  more  than 
one health anxiety scale was included in the same factor 
analysis  [40].  In  that  study,  503  undergraduate  students 
completed the HAI-18 and the Multidimensional Inven-
tory  of  Hypochondriacal  Traits  [MIHT;  41].  When  a 
second-order health anxiety factor was added, the MIHT 
Affective/Worry subfactor which focuses on worry about 
health and the fear about serious illness had the strongest 
factor  loading  (0.96),  followed  by  a  factor  representing 
the  first  14  items  of  the  HAI-18  (i.e.,  the  HAI-14;  0.83). 
Similar to the present study, the MIHT Behavioral/Reas-
surance  subfactor  had  a  modest  factor  loading  of  0.55, 
and the Negative Consequences (NC) items of the HAI-
18 did worse (0.51). Thus, on the whole, the outcome of 
the previous study was similar to the present one in the 
sense  that  the  worry  about  health  and  the  fear  of  seri-
ous illness was at the core of the trait health anxiety con-
struct [40], which speaks for the validity of our findings. 
The fact that many of the HAI-64 NC items had relatively 
weak  factor  loadings  on  the  broad  trait  health  anxiety 
factor in both studies also has clinical implications in that 
this speaks for further use of the HAI-14 rather than the 
HAI-64  or  HAI-18  if  construct  validity  in  the  field  as  a 

whole is to be promoted. Simply put, the HAI-14 appears 
to focus on the core aspects of trait health anxiety.

This  study  had  notable  strengths.  Several  trait  health 
in  paral-
anxiety  questionnaires  were  administered 
lel  which  is  unusual,  especially  in  clinical  samples.  Fur-
thermore,  data  could  be  derived  from  a  combination  of 
healthy volunteers and patients with pathological health 
anxiety  which  means  that  the  full  range  of  trait  health 
anxiety scores were available for analysis. This study also 
had limitations. Participants were primarily self-referred, 
reported  high  average  educational  attainment,  and  were 
primarily  female.  This  implies  a  threat  that  results  may 
not generalize as well to populations that are not actively 
seeking  treatment,  that  are  less  educated,  and  that  are 
primarily  male.  Notably,  relatively  little  is  known  about 
measurement  invariance  with  regard  to  psychomet-
ric  measures  of  health  anxiety  (for  one  of  few  notewor-
thy  investigations,  see  MacSwain  et  al.,  2009  [42]).  This 
means  that  it  is  not  clear  to  what  degree  the  WI-14, 
IAS,  HAI-64,  HAI-18,  and  HAI-14  behave  differently  in 
psychometric  terms  for  example  as  a  function  of  demo-
graphic  characteristics.  Another  limitation  is  that  the 
HAI-14  and  HAI-18  were  scored  from  the  correspond-
ing  items  of  the  HAI-64  as  opposed  to  administered 
separately, which may have affected the outcome due to 
intermediate  items  giving  rise  to  framing  and  ordering 
effects  [e.g.,  43].  Because  the  HAI-64,  IAS,  and  WI-14 
were  not  administered  in  weighted  or  random  order, 
ordering effects could also have affected the study overall, 
which highlights the preliminary nature of these findings. 
A  limitation  of  this  study  is  also  that  the  full  theoreti-
cal ranges of sum scores were not observed. Specifically, 
none  of  the  participants  had  a  score  of  42  on  the  HAI-
14, 54 on the HAI-18, 0–8 or 175–192 on the HAI-64, or 
0–4 or 104–108 on the IAS. These sum score ranges were 
therefore  not  modelled.  Last,  we  wish  to  highlight  that 
several common trait health anxiety questionnaires were 
not included in the present study. For example, based on 
a  decision  taken  around  2010  [44],  in  the  research  pro-
gram  from  which  these  data  were  derived,  we  adminis-
tered  a  dichotomous  (“yes”/”no”)  item  version  of  the 
WI-14  as  opposed  to  a  Likert-version  which  is  more 
common nowadays [21].

Conclusion
This study indicates that the WI-14, IAS, HAI-64, HAI-
18,  and  HAI-14  are  all  valid  measures  of  the  same  trait 
health anxiety construct, the core of which appears to be 
the worry about health, the fear of having or developing 
a  serious  disease,  and  to  some  extent  bodily  preoccupa-
tion.  Approximate  linking  guidelines  enable  clinicians 
and researchers to convert sum scores between question-
naires,  and  to  determine  how  trait  health  anxiety  levels 
compare over published studies. For the clinician, a take 

Axelsson et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:658 home  message  from  this  study  could  also  be  that  it  is 
probably  more  fruitful  to  identify  patients  with  patho-
logical  health  anxiety  by  asking  them  about  health  wor-
ries and the fear of serious disease (which appears to lies 
at  the  core  of  health  anxiety)  than  to  ask  about  specific 
behavioral  patterns  such  as  healthcare  consumption  or 
reassurance  seeking  which  differ  considerably  between 
patients, and commonly change for the same patient over 
time.
