Abstract

In the field of psychiatry, biological markers are rarely, if ever, used in the diagnosis of mental 
health disorders. Clinicians rely primarily on patient histories and behavioral symptoms to identify 
specific psychopathologies, which makes diagnosis highly subjective. Moreover, therapies for 
mental health disorders are aimed specifically at attenuating behavioral manifestations, which 
overlooks the pathophysiological indices of the disease. This is highly evident in posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) where inflammation and immune system perturbations are becoming 
increasingly described. Further, patients with PTSD possess significantly elevated risks of 
developing comorbid inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases, 
which are likely linked (though not fully proven) to the apparent dysregulation of the immune 
system after psychological trauma. To date, there is little to no evidence that demonstrates 
current PTSD therapies are able to reverse the increased risk for psychological trauma-induced 
inflammatory diseases, which suggests the behavioral and somatic consequences of PTSD may 
not be tightly coupled. This observation provides an opportunity to explore unique mechanisms 
outside of the brain that contribute to the long-term pathology of PTSD. Herein, we provide an 
overview of neuroimmune mechanisms, describe what is known regarding innate and adaptive 
immunity in PTSD, and suggest new directions that are needed to advance the understanding, 
diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD moving forward.

Introduction

Page 2

The immune system protects the host from two primary insults: pathogens and damage. 
Whereas the immune mechanisms for neutralizing pathogens are diverse, those involved in 
physical tissue damage are more limited. With this, the immune system's primary method 
of repairing tissue damage is the orchestration of scar tissue deposition, regardless of 
the organ that is damaged. While this fibrotic repair mechanism likely served a strong 
evolutionary benefit towards physical damage to the skin, it falls short in the ability to 
fully repair intricate and diverse organs such as the heart, kidney, liver, or brain. As our 
species has extended our lifespan long beyond our mating years, this primitive damage 
repair mechanism has become implicated in more diseases associated with age. Moreover, as 
humans evolved to have more complex social and behavioral systems, the immune system 
was presented with a new challenge of experiencing psychological trauma and subsequent 
chronic mental health disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which as we will 
discuss, has pushed this system to its functional capacity.

PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by heightened fear, arousal, 
and avoidance behavior, but is also highly associated with chronic inflammation and an 
elevated risk of various long-term autoimmune and cardiovascular outcomes (Pivac et al., 
2023; Vaccarino et al., 2013). While the specific mechanisms of how psychological trauma 
impacts the immune system and body remain unclear today, the heightened sympathetic 
nervous system response associated with PTSD is believed to be a primary driver of both 
the behavioral and physiological pathological states, even more so than the hypothalamus-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which has demonstrated a paradoxical decrease in cortisol 
levels in patients with PTSD (Yehuda, 2005; Schneider and Schwerdtfeger, 2020; Yehuda 
et al., 1998; Yehuda et al., 1995; Halbreich et al., 1989). While short-term activation of 
the sympathetic nervous system during a “fight or flight” response may provide acute 
survival benefits and positive effects on inflammation, it is possible that the pathological 
chronic activation of this system may cause long-term detriments to the immune system, 
which may underlie the predisposition to somatic pathology after PTSD. Moreover, it 
still remains unclear if current behavioral-targeted therapies are sufficient to attenuate the 
immune dysregulation, inflammation, and risk for inflammatory comorbidities associated 
with PTSD. While more studies are needed to support this notion, this could possibly 
suggest that the inflammatory and physiological sequelae of PTSD are not fully coupled 
with the behavioral manifestations. Therefore, understanding the exact etiology of the 
behavioral, autonomic, and inflammatory consequences is paramount for uncovering the 
cause of the disease for future intervention.

Immune system basics

Immune system development has been described extensively else-where (Weiskopf et al., 
2009; Dorshkind et al., 2009; West, 2002). Therefore, the goal of this section is to provide 
the reader a generalized overview of the various types of immune cells, their primary 
function, and how they interact to set the premise for the following sections regarding 
neuro-immune communication and PTSD. A graphic overview of various immune cells and 
their general functions may be viewed in Fig. 1.

2.1. 

Innate versus adaptive immunity

Classically, the immune system is comprised of “white blood cells” (to contrast with red 
blood cells), or leukocytes, and is broken into two different branches: innate and adaptive. 
Innate immune cells include cell types such as granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, 
dendritic cells, and innate lymphoid cells, and are primarily characterized by their lack of 
specificity towards antigens and their ability to respond in a non-specific or generalized 
fashion. This allows for a rapid response, and also permits immunity towards a diverse 
set of threats. Because of these characteristics, it has long been believed that the innate 
immune system does not possess any type of long-term “memory” of an immune challenge. 
In other words, this would imply that the innate immune system would not “remember” any 
specific antigen no matter how many times it had been encountered and would mount the 
same response each time. However, it has been recently observed that the innate immune 
system may indeed possess the ability to mount a heightened reaction to additional triggers 
of inflammation or infection, known as trained immunity (Netea et al., 2020; Netea et al., 
2016; Netea et al., 2011). While still an emerging concept, this may provide a basis as to 
why 97 % of all earth's organisms thrive in the absence of a classical adaptive immune 
system. Moreover, while not yet investigated, trained innate immunity may play a role in 
PTSD given its chronic and recurring impacts on the immune system.

In contrast to the innate immune system which possesses an array of cell types, the 
adaptive immune system contains primarily T and B-lymphocytes, each of which have 
unique functions. First, antibody-mediated immunity, or humoral immunity, is a major 
component to long-term immune protection after an initial antigen encounter and is 
regulated by B-lymphocytes (Ansel et al., 2000; Gatto et al., 2011; Schuh et al., 2020). 
In contrast, T-lymphocytes provide cell-mediated adaptive immunity. While many subtypes 
of T-lymphocytes exist, there are two primary groups based upon unique surface markers 
on the respective cell types: CD4 and CD8. T-lymphocytes expressing CD4 are known as 
helper T-lymphocytes, and function primarily to augment immune responses from both B-
lymphocytes and the innate immune system. In contrast, CD8 expressing T-lymphocytes are 
known as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and given their namesake, possess the primary function 
of killing infected or potentially harmful cells (Cantor and Boyse, 1977; Shiku et al., 1975). 
In general, T-lymphocytes play a highly centralized role between all arms of the immune 
system, and may act as master orchestrators of a unified immune defense towards foreign 
pathogens or tissue damage.

Both T and B-lymphocytes possess a unique immunological characteristic: immunological 
memory. The fundamental concept of immunological memory is the ability for the immune 
system to respond to additional exposures of the same challenge more rapidly than when 
compared with the initial challenge. To achieve this feat, subsets of adaptive immune cells 
that have been activated by a primary antigen response will differentiate into memory forms 
of those lymphocytes. While these memory cells exist in large numbers scattered throughout 
secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes, their immunological 
functions are mostly dormant. However, upon repeat exposure to their specific antigen, these 
memory cells are able to respond faster than their naïve counterparts. These memory cells 
are highly reactive in their ability to proliferate and produce proinflammatory cytokines,

which has been shown to contribute to the long-term inflammatory states of many chronic 
diseases.

2.2. 

Inflammation

The term inflammation is one of the most widely used descriptors of immune system 
function, but is also vague and possesses varying definitions. For example, inflammation is 
often used to describe a localized reaction in a tissue that consists of enhanced blood flow, 
swelling, redness, heat, and pain. In contrast, inflammation may also be used to describe 
activation of specific immune cells in an organ system, such as activated microglia in the 
brain referred to as neuroinflammation. Additionally, the simple observation of elevated 
immune-mediated proteins such as cytokines and chemokines either locally or systemically 
may be termed inflammation. These varying definitions often lead to confusion when 
utilizing the term inflammation, thus, the word has lost much meaning in the absence of 
specific context.

However, the unifying theme among all definitions of inflammation is the activation of a 
component of the immune system and the release of immune-mediated molecules (Borish 
and Steinke, 2003). The catalyst for inflammation often begins when a damage associated 
molecular pattern (DAMP) receptor or pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) 
receptor are triggered on an innate immune cell by encountering a foreign or endogenous 
antigen (i.e., neoantigen). This initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling in the immune 
cell, which leads to the production and excretion of immune-mediated molecules such as 
cytokines and/or chemokines. Common examples of pro-inflammatory immune proteins are 
C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 17a 
(IL-17a), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In contrast, anti-inflammatory immune proteins 
are interleukin 4 (IL-4, context dependent), IL-6 (context dependent), and interleukin 10 
(IL-10). The production of these immune-mediated molecules is imperative in mounting a 
rapid and appropriate immune response, thus, the assessment of these proteins (which has 
become a primary output of scientific investigations of inflammation) allows for a snapshot 
view into the general status of the immune system at a specific time. However, interpretation 
of immune function by assessment of immune-mediated proteins alone should be performed 
with extreme caution, as communication among immune and non-immune cells is highly 
complex and dynamic, and requires in depth temporal, spatial, cellular, and functional 
evaluation to fully appreciate the immune and inflammatory response in a specific context.

While the immune response is well known to occur in response to pathogens or cellular 
damage, there are additional signals that may also modulate immune cell activation. 
Over the last few decades, it has become highly appreciated that immune cells are in 
constant reciprocal communication with the nervous system and send/receive messages 
via neurotransmitters. The investigations into how immune cells utilize and respond to 
neurotransmitters are still in their infancy, but this neural communication appears to 
significantly affect immune system function and is likely imperative in the control of 
immunity and inflammation in mental health disorders such as PTSD.

3.  Neural communication with immune system

3.1.  Behavioral-immune connections

Since the 1920s, research into Pavlovian behavioral conditioning has yielded 
intriguing findings regarding its potential physiological impact on the immune system 
(Cohen et al., 1994). Early studies uncovered that pairing the taste of saccharin 
with an immunosuppressant led to a conditioned response, wherein the animal 
remained immunosuppressed even when exposed to saccharin treatment without the 
immunosuppressant during subsequent trials (Ader and Cohen, 1975). Additional studies 
have also demonstrated that immune challenges may also associate with specific 
environments or foods due to the sickness behavior being linked with the initial pairing 
(Costa-Pinto et al., 2005). Conversely, the act of avoiding stimuli associated with a 
pathogen or its related illness has been found to trigger an adaptive immune response, 
preparing the body for immune interactions (Mirotti et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2004). 
This avoidant behavior elicits comprehensive physiological changes designed to bolster the 
body's natural defenses against pathogens, now referred to as the “learned placebo effect” 
in such cases (Schedlowski and Pacheco-López, 2010). Moreover, recent therapies have 
put this concept of behavior-influenced immunity to the test, with psychological treatments 
showing promising effects on leukemia prognosis in patients. These treatments have led 
to improved quality of life through enhanced immunity, shortened sickness behavior, 
and overall increased well-being of the patients (Chacin-Fernández et al., 2019). The 
culmination of this body of work, combined with newer evidence such as the innervation 
of the lymphoid organs (Felten et al., 1985) and the discovery of immune cells expressing 
neurotransmitter receptors (Hadden et al., 1970; Pert et al., 1985), underscores the mounting 
evidence suggesting a closer link between the neural and immune systems than previously 
believed.

Interestingly, the interactions between the nervous and immune systems appear to be 
bidirectional. The immune system is able to affect the central nervous system either directly 
(through physical migration of immune cells or cytokines into the brain) or indirectly (via 
immune interactions in the periphery affecting afferent sensory neurons). These interactions 
may affect major neural processes such as memory, behavior, and development (Boahen et 
al., 2023; Lotan and Schwartz, 1994; Matejuk et al., 2021). Additionally, upon receiving 
signals from immune cells, the central nervous system can respond and work through 
efferent pathways, towards the periphery, to signal to other immune cells as to how they 
should respond. However, the specific details underlying behavioral-immune interactions 
remain unknown, but continue to unravel fascinating insights into the complex relationship 
between the mind and the body's defenses.

3.2.  Sympathetic regulation of immunity

Among the potential communication pathways between the nervous and immune systems, 
the autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic arm of the autonomic system, 
has been implicated in playing regulatory roles and making significant contributions to 
numerous mental health disorders. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), also known as 
the fight or flight response system, is a multifaceted mechanism that influences a wide range

of physiological bodily functions, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, 
endocrine, metabolic, and importantly, immune system functions (Bottasso, 2019).

This sympathetic control is exerted through direct influence from key catecholaminergic 
signals, epinephrine (EP) and norepinephrine (NE), which are released into circulation or 
directly from sympathetic neurons (Leach and Suzuki, 2020). These catecholamines are 
released at the synapse at their target organ, where they bind to alpha and beta-adrenergic 
receptors (White et al., 2000; Elenkov et al., 2000; Molinoff, 1984). Notably, these 
adrenergic receptors are expressed on both innate and adaptive immune cell types, and they 
respond to the binding of NE and EP, resulting in the modulation of immune cell function 
(White et al., 2000; Elenkov et al., 2000). In addition to NE and EP, other neurotransmitters 
released by the sympathetic system bind to their own unique receptors as well as adrenergic 
receptors with less affinity, leading to the modulation of immune cells. Some of these 
neurotransmitters include dopamine, neuropeptide Y, and substance P (Levite and Chowers, 
2001; Neve et al., 2004). The specific class of adrenergic receptor stimulated, whether 
alpha or beta, as well as whether the cell is of the innate or adaptive type, can result 
in different immune responses. For instance, stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors on 
adaptive immune cells, such as T and B-lymphocytes, promotes immune cell trafficking, 
circulation, proliferation, and modulates their cytokine production (Elenkov et al., 2000; 
Ramer-Quinn et al., 2000). Notably, adaptive cells typically express a higher number of beta 
receptors than alpha receptors (Nance and Sanders, 2007). Conversely, stimulation of beta-
adrenergic receptors on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and monocytes, has been 
observed to inhibit pro-inflammatory responses (Alaniz et al., 1999; Wohleb et al., 2014a; 
Wohleb et al., 2013), while stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors leads to augmented 
proinflammatory changes (Spengler et al., 1990). These examples highlight generalized 
responses of immune cells to various adrenergic receptor activation, however, extensive 
work has demonstrated that the responses are much more nuanced, context dependent, 
and the inflammatory response is not always binary when referring to a specific type of 
adrenergic receptor stimulation (Padro and Sanders, 2014).

In addition to receiving and responding to sympathetic signals, studies have found that 
immune cells are capable of synthesizing, storing, and releasing their own catecholamines 
to signal in a paracrine and autocrine fashion (Smith and Blalock, 1981; Flierl et al., 
2007). This area of neuroimmunology is still developing, and many of the details regarding 
these immune-derived catecholamines are still being uncovered. Further, the discovery that 
immune cells produce neurotransmitters provides additional evidence of how intertwined the 
nervous and immune systems are within the body, and suggests they work in tandem more 
than previously appreciated.

3.3.  Parasympathetic regulation of immunity

The parasympathetic system, also known as the “rest and digest” system, plays a regulatory 
role in response to the actions of the sympathetic system, particularly by inducing an 
anti-inflammatory response. Unlike the sympathetic system that utilizes several different 
neurotransmitters, the parasympathetic system communicates by releasing one primary 
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (Goehler et al., 2000; Elkhatib and Case, 2019).

Immune cells express various receptors for acetylcholine, including both muscarinic and 
nicotinic receptors, which are crucial in ameliorating the pro-inflammatory response to 
prevent uncontrolled inflammatory consequences. Indeed, genetic knock-out of these types 
of parasympathetic receptors has been shown to be highly detrimental in experimental 
models of infection and sepsis (Elkhatib and Case, 2019; Maldifassi et al., 2018). Therefore, 
it is hypothesized that the parasympathetic system exerts a primary anti-inflammatory 
response that checks and balances the effects of the sympathetic system (though this is still 
highly debated (Elkhatib and Case, 2019)). One of the primary ways the parasympathetic 
system is believed to regulate immune function is by controlling inflammation and inducing 
anti-inflammatory signals, a process known as the anti-inflammatory reflex or cholinergic 
anti-inflammatory response (Goehler et al., 2000). The concept behind this reflex is that 
when peripheral tissues sense inflammation, sensory nerves transmit this information to the 
brain where it triggers the parasympathetic nervous system back in the periphery to attenuate 
inflammation, particularly in secondary lymphoid organs like the spleen (Goehler et al., 
2000). These parasympathetic signals significantly inhibit cytokine production in the spleen 
and improve inflammatory complications by affecting both the innate and adaptive immune 
systems (Rosas-Ballina et al., 2011).

However, there is one major complication with this model: secondary lymphoid organs like 
the spleen do not possess any direct parasympathetic innervation (Padro and Sanders, 2014). 
In fact, most lymphoid organs possess exclusively catecholaminergic innervation, which is 
thought to be sympathetic in nature. So how is it that numerous studies have demonstrated 
parasympathetic actions and the presence of acetylcholine leading to anti-inflammatory 
effects in secondary lymphoid organs? The prevailing theory is that parasympathetic 
nerves communicate to secondary lymphoid organs through their synapses in upstream 
ganglia, which then induces specific immune cells (i.e., T-lymphocytes) to generate/release 
acetylcholine to facilitate the anti-inflammatory effects (Rosas-Ballina et al., 2011; Rosas-
Ballina et al., 2008). There are some significant caveats to this theory including the unknown 
mechanism by which immune cells can decipher sympathetic versus parasympathetic signals 
coming from one singular nerve and set of neurotransmitters, as well as conflicting evidence 
from researchers demonstrating the parasympathetic system plays less of a role than 
currently accepted (Gautron et al., 2013; Bratton et al., 2012). Whatever the mechanism 
may be, it is difficult to overlook the breadth of data demonstrating that the parasympathetic 
branch regulates peripheral immune function.

For example, studies have shown that parasympathetic signals, upon reaching adaptive 
cells, reduce the proliferation of multiple subtypes of T-lymphocytes and suppress the 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-22, and TNFα (Nizri et al., 2009). 
Additionally, follow-up studies on anti-inflammatory regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) 
have concluded that there is an increase in Treg-mediated immune suppression of pro-
inflammatory lymphocytes in response to these parasympathetic signals (Wang et al., 2010). 
Further, acetylcholine has been observed to produce a similar anti-inflammatory effect in 
the innate immune system as well. The parasympathetic system has been shown to be 
responsible for lowering levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, 
and IFN-γ, which primarily originate from innate immune cell populations (St-Pierre et 
al., 2016). Additionally, the close contact observed between certain cholinergic neurons

and innate cells, such as monocytes and macrophages in the gastrointestinal system, 
provides evidence that parasympathetic signaling impacts inflammation via cholinergic 
signals in these populations (Wang et al., 2003; Matteoli et al., 2014). Together, these 
anti-inflammatory effects of the parasympathetic nervous system have provided the basis 
for novel therapeutic approaches, such as vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), that attempt to 
stimulate this arm of the autonomic system and limit inflammation in an array of diseases.

Immunity and PTSD

Aforementioned, PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by heightened 
fear, social withdrawal, chronic stress, inflammation, and an increased risk of various 
long-term autoimmune and cardiovascular outcomes compared to unaffected individuals 
(Pivac et al., 2023; Vaccarino et al., 2013). The heightened sympathetic response 
associated with PTSD is believed to be a primary driver of both the behavioral and 
physiological pathological states, even more so than the HPA axis, which has demonstrated a 
paradoxical decrease in cortisol levels in patients with PTSD (Yehuda, 2005; Schneider 
and Schwerdtfeger, 2020; Yehuda et al., 1998; Yehuda et al., 1995; Halbreich et al., 
1989). This long-term dysregulation of the stress-response systems is also associated with 
an increased systemic level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chronic inflammation, and a 
reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines (Michopoulos et al., 2017). Data also suggests 
that a PTSD score, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), 
may correlate with particular elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and CRP, 
as well as increased sympathetic signatures (Kim et al., 2020; Somvanshi et al., 2020). 
However, as evidenced by one such study, even if the psychiatric manifestations improve 
over the long term, inflammation and the risk for inflammatory comorbidities may still 
persist (Himmerich et al., 2016). In this study, various groups of soldiers with PTSD were 
treated with psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and/or 
traditional antidepressants, and levels of TNFα and its soluble receptors were examined 
both before and after therapy. Interestingly, while PTSD symptoms (as measured by the 
post-traumatic stress diagnostic scale) improved with these therapies, the TNFα system 
in these patients was mostly unchanged. This observation is imperative, as it implies 
that not all inflammatory and physiological sequelae of PTSD are fully coupled with the 
behavioral manifestations. Indeed, a newer study recently reported significant elevations 
in circulating inflammatory proteins in trauma exposed individuals with and without the 
development of PTSD compared to health controls, which further supports the notion of a 
disconnect between behavior and inflammatory outcomes (Koirala et al., 2023). Therefore, 
understanding the exact cause of the behavioral, autonomic, and inflammatory consequences 
is paramount for uncovering the source of the disease in which appropriate therapeutic 
modalities may be applied. A summary of this section, which describes both innate and 
adaptive immune interactions in PTSD, may be found in Table 1.

4.1.  Cytokine dysregulation in PTSD

The majority of research examining immune dysregulation and inflammation in PTSD 
has simply measured levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines. Traditionally, these 
inflammatory proteins play a crucial role in modulating both the innate and adaptive

immune cell populations as signaling molecules, but their specific role in the context of 
PTSD is still unclear (Holtmann and Resch, 1995). The increased cytokine and chemokine 
levels observed in individuals experiencing PTSD (Boscarino, 2008) may be a key factor 
contributing to long-term pathophysiology, including an elevated risk for autoimmune and 
cardiovascular diseases (O'Donovan et al., 2015; Remch et al., 2018), but additional studies 
are highly warranted to understand the mechanistic role of specific cytokines in this disorder.

One important facet of PTSD is that not all cytokines and chemokines are elevated 
indiscriminately in this disease, but specific subsets have been repeatedly identified as 
dysregulated (Breen et al., 2018; Uddin et al., 2010). For example, pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-6, CRP, IL-1β, and TNFα have been consistently implicated in PTSD 
(Spivak et al., 1997; von Känel et al., 2007; Tucker et al., 2010; von Känel et al., 2010; 
Baker et al., 2001). Other studies, though not as prevalent as the aforementioned, have 
also identified IL-17A increases in PTSD (Maloley et al., 2019). This cytokine has been 
highly implicated in autoimmune diseases (Bedoya et al., 2013), which makes it an attractive 
target for investigations studying the links between psychological trauma and autoimmunity. 
Conversely, several studies have also shown elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-4 and IL-10 in PTSD patients, indicating that PTSD is not solely characterized by a 
proinflammatory response and likely involves multiple immune pathways (Guo et al., 2012; 
Renner et al., 2022a; Renner et al., 2022b).

Of the cytokines that have been identified in PTSD, IL-6 and CRP appear to show the 
greatest association with PTSD behavioral manifestations (Marsland et al., 2017; Passos 
et al., 2015; Lima et al., 2019). In fact, baseline plasma CRP concentrations have been 
indicative of PTSD diagnosis and severity in pre-deployment Marines (Eraly et al., 2014). 
Additionally, both IL-6 and CRP levels in the periphery have been associated with PTSD 
following a traumatic event (Cohen et al., 2011). Interestingly, peripherally elevated levels of 
IL-6 have been reported to independently contribute to PTSD severity and are associated 
with enhanced fear and anxiety responses, as well as increasing brain activity in the 
regions responsible for this behavior (Kim et al., 2020; Inagaki et al., 2012; Muscatell 
et al., 2015). Moreover, non-pharmaceutical based PTSD therapies, such as vagal nerve 
stimulation, have also demonstrated the ability to lower IL-6 levels in both acute and chronic 
settings (Bremner et al., 2020; Bremner et al., 2021). At this time, it is unclear if the nerve 
stimulation directly acts on the immune system to lower IL-6 levels which in turn attenuates 
PTSD behavioral manifestations, or conversely acts first on the brain which triggers a 
downstream reduction in IL-6. In either situation, these novel therapeutic approaches that 
address both behavior and inflammation show incredible promise, and may become the 
standard of therapy for mental health disorders in the future. Indeed, direct targeting of 
specific cytokines in mental health disorders is also being investigated, with several clinical 
trials currently underway targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines (primarily IL-6) in mental 
health disorders (Tyring et al., 2006; Abbasi et al., 2012).

While the previous investigations have undoubtedly demonstrated that PTSD is associated 
with elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines, mechanistic insight into the source, 
timing, and effects of these pro-inflammatory proteins are currently lacking in these human 
studies. Due to this, many investigators have turned to preclinical animal models that

recapitulate aspects of PTSD. There are approximately a half a dozen animal models 
that are currently accepted to mimic various features of PTSD (Aspesi and Pinna, 2019; 
Deslauriers et al., 2018). Interestingly, only one model has been shown to recapitulate 
peripheral elevations in cytokines and chemokines similar to human PTSD (Aspesi and 
Pinna, 2019; Deslauriers et al., 2018). This model is known as repeated social defeat stress 
(RSDS), and incorporates aspects of both physical and psychological trauma (Reader et 
al., 2015; Moshfegh et al., 2019; Weber et al., 2017). Animals undergoing RSDS possess 
elevated levels of circulating IL-6, IL-17A, TNFα, and IL-10, which is highly similar to 
human PTSD (Moshfegh et al., 2019; Elkhatib et al., 2020). Further, investigations have 
also found that specific subsets of cytokines associate with RSDS behavioral manifestations 
such as anti-social behavior (Hodes et al., 2014) or anxiety-like behavior (Elkhatib et al., 
2020) . Other preclinical models of PTSD, such as predator stress or social disruption stress 
(SDR), have observed increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, and 
TNFα in the brain after psychological trauma, suggesting neuroinflammatory mechanisms at 
play as well (Wohleb et al., 2014b; Wilson et al., 2013; Deslauriers et al., 2017). Together, 
these studies confirm that psychological trauma, even in rodents, is able to produce a pro-
inflammatory phenotype, suggesting a conserved evolutionary immune response to stress.

However, the question still remains as to how these cytokines and chemokines 
affect behavior and physiology after psychological trauma. To address this question, 
pharmacological and genetic manipulations of inflammation in animal models have been 
primarily utilized. For example, treatments with generalized non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to effectively reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines 
such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in a rat model of PTSD (Levkovitz et al., 2015; Gamble-
George et al., 2016) as well as being generally neuroprotective for their effects on 
neuroinflammation (Ajmone-Cat et al., 2010). Other more specific NSAIDs, such as COX-2 
inhibitors, significantly improved locomotor activity, antianxiety effect, memory retention, 
and attenuated oxidative damage in mouse and rat PTSD models (Kumari et al., 2007; Wang 
et al., 2018). Additionally, the application of NSAIDs has not only diminished anxious 
behaviors but has also alleviated general anxiety symptoms in animals subjected to stress 
(Levkovitz et al., 2015; Gamble-George et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016). However, in stark 
contrast, NSAIDs have shown little benefit in the context of human PTSD (Grau et al., 2022) 
with very few studies to validate their efficacy in this disease. Therefore, additional studies 
are required in order to better understand the impact of PTSD treatments on inflammation in 
humans.

On the opposite end of the spectrum to NSAIDs, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have 
also been examined in the context of PTSD. Interestingly, PTSD has a complex presentation 
regarding endogenous corticosteroid production compared to other mental health disorders 
(which often present with elevated levels), with disparate findings showing either unchanged 
or reduced levels in patients with PTSD (Yehuda, 2002). This raises the question as to the 
role of corticosteroids in PTSD, as well as how they may regulate post-psychological trauma 
inflammation. Regarding exogenous supplementation of corticosteroids, studies have shown 
that a single treatment with corticosterone shortly after stress exposure reduced behavioral 
symptoms in animal PTSD models (Cohen et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2015). Additionally, 
steroidal treatments have been effective for their enhanced memory retrieval effects in

humans (Wingenfeld et al., 2012), their usage to confront traumatic memories in veterans 
with PTSD (Surís et al., 2010), as well as being protective against the development of 
PTSD in certain contexts (Schelling et al., 2001). While these results are promising, there 
have been minimal examination as to how corticosteroids exert these positive effects, and if 
modulating the immune system is a primary target. Moreover, these broad anti-inflammatory 
drugs are highly non-specific, and therefore provide minimal information as to which 
specific inflammatory proteins or cells are important in the context of PTSD-induced 
inflammation and pathology.

Given this limitation in generalized anti-inflammatories, several investigations have 
attempted to target specific cytokines implicated in PTSD. For example, administration 
of antibodies specifically targeting TNFα resulted in diminished peripheral inflammation 
and prevention of anxiety-like behaviors in a preclinical rat model of PTSD (Dib et al., 
2021). Furthermore, the targeting of IL-6 by using antibodies or genetic knock-out animals 
has also shown that blockade of IL-6 reverses psychological trauma-induced behavioral 
changes such as social avoidance or anxiety-like phenotypes (Hodes et al., 2014; Niraula 
et al., 2019). Intriguingly, while the genetic knock-out of IL-6 appeared to reverse negative 
behavior changes as well as limit pro-inflammatory gene signatures in innate immune cells, 
it had minimal impact on innate immune cell release from the periphery and recruitment 
to the brain (Niraula et al., 2019). This suggests the possibility of multiple mechanisms 
involved in the regulation of immunity and inflammation after psychological trauma. With 
that, IL-1β has also been investigated due to its repeated characterization and importance in 
the stress response (Shintani et al., 1995; Goshen and Yirmiya, 2009). For example, systemic 
pharmacological or genetic blockade of the IL-1β receptor has been shown to reverse the 
antineurogenic, anhedonic, and anxiety-like behavior caused by chronic stress exposure 
(Koo and Duman, 2008; Wohleb et al., 2011). Interestingly, blockade of the IL-1β receptor 
specifically in endothelial cells is sufficient to prevent stress-induced behavioral deficits 
such as anxiety-like behavior (Wohleb et al., 2014c). This endothelial effect is believed 
to begin with microglia in the brain becoming activated during chronic stress, which 
causes the recruitment of IL-1β expressing monocytes to the brain (McKim et al., 2018). 
These proinflammatory monocytes appear to be causal in driving stress-induced behavioral 
manifestations, but are trafficked to the brain via IL-1β receptor expressing-endothelial 
cells (McKim et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). This multicellular cascade demonstrates the 
complexity of psychological trauma-induced immune perturbations, but illuminates new 
potential targets in the treating of PTSD behaviors. However, given the limitations of 
performing mechanistic studies in humans, much of this work still remains to be validated in 
human PTSD patients.

Overall, the presence of a unique cytokine milieu in PTSD suggests that specific immune 
cells may be a central element in the development and progression of PTSD (Lindqvist et 
al., 2014). However, static levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines in the absence of 
any other immune system examination, which is how the majority of PTSD studies have 
been performed, provide little evidence as to the source of these proteins, the root cause 
of the actual elevation, or how these inflammatory mediators after affecting specific cell 
types in and out of the immune system. Reports of specific immune mechanisms in PTSD 
are currently sparse in the literature, but are beginning to be investigated. These types of

studies will prove quintessential in unraveling the regulatory pathways involved that link 
psychological trauma to altered immune function.

4.2. 

Innate immune alterations in PTSD

As earlier mentioned, the changes in inflammatory proteins observed among individuals 
with PTSD suggest the potential for immune dysregulation and malfunction. However, the 
available evidence regarding these immune alterations in humans remains limited. Most 
studies have simply explored population shifts of innate immune cells associated with 
PTSD, primarily focusing on monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and granulocytes due to 
their abundance in circulation and their potential role in altered cytokine production of IL-1β 
and TNFα following psychological trauma.

Investigations into the proportions and quantities of these innate immune cells have 
yielded inconsistent findings among PTSD patients. Certain studies, including one involving 
prisoners of war with PTSD, have reported increased circulating monocyte cell counts 
(Skarpa et al., 2001), while lifetime prevalence of PTSD has shown elevated monocyte 
proportions in males (Kim et al., 2019). Additionally, others have demonstrated that stress 
(not PTSD per se) leads to elevated circulating monocyte levels in healthy female volunteers 
(van de Wouw et al., 2021). In contrast, other investigations have failed to identify elevated 
levels of monocytes or NK cells in the circulation of individuals with PTSD (Laudenslager 
et al., 1998; Rohleder et al., 2004). Additionally, while the proportion of neutrophils 
greatly increases in peripheral blood following acute stress (Dhabhar, 2014; Tang et al., 
2022), chronic stress and PTSD contrastingly suppresses these innate cells (Dhabhar, 
2014). For example, in studies investigating acute stress with participants undergoing a 
10-minute paced auditory serial addition stress test or being stressed about an upcoming 
academic examination, participants showed enhanced neutrophil release (Khanfer et al., 
2010; Tsukamoto and Machida, 2014). However, in instances of chronic stress, such as 
individuals who have been kept as prisoners of war or children who have delt with parental 
separation/divorce, neutrophil numbers were attenuated (Dekaris et al., 1993; Bartlett et al., 
1997). Literature on other innate immune cells such as dendritic or innate lymphoid cells 
is even more sparse. For instance, dendritic cells in trauma patients exhibited increased 
levels of apoptosis compared to healthy controls (Maier et al., 2009) while another study 
demonstrated trauma led to an imbalance in dendritic cell subtypes (Henrich et al., 2009), 
but given these patients suffered significant physical trauma, it is unclear if psychological 
factors contributed to these dendritic cell effects. Research on a relatively newer class 
of innate immune cells known as innate lymphoid cells is even more scarce, with only 
speculation at this time as to how these cells may contribute to mental health (Barichello, 
2022).

Beyond merely characterizing cell numbers, select studies have attempted to characterize 
human innate immune cell function in the context of PTSD. For instance, the response of 
NK cells and monocytes to mitogens appears to be impaired in PTSD given that patients 
who developed PTSD showed reduced cell proliferation and cytokine release from these 
cells compared to controls (Gotovac et al., 2010; Wutzler et al., 2009). This diminished NK 
functionality has been consistently replicated in survivors of natural disasters with PTSD

(Kawamura et al., 2001; Inoue-Sakurai et al., 2000). However, a single study (Laudenslager 
et al., 1998) presented contrasting results, indicating increased cytotoxic NK cell activity 
among Vietnam War veterans. Neutrophil function shows a similar pattern to that of their 
numbers; acute stress leads to increases, while chronic stress decreases, phagocytic activity 
(Khanfer et al., 2010; Tsukamoto and Machida, 2014; Dekaris et al., 1993; Bartlett et al., 
1997). Other studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
have potentiated functional responses. For example, when subjected to cytokine response 
tests using mitogens like LPS, PBMCs from individuals with PTSD have demonstrated 
heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα 
(Rohleder et al., 2004; Gola et al., 2013). However, studies utilizing PBMCs are convoluted 
by the fact they contain an array of cell types including adaptive immune cells, which 
precludes any definitive conclusions regarding specific cell types.

Together, it is clear that additional and more controlled studies are highly needed to better 
understand the timing, distribution, and function of innate immune cells in PTSD. The 
disparity in the aforementioned studies likely stems from one of the most significant 
limitations in the field of psychological trauma: an incredibly broad definition of PTSD. 
Currently, the diagnosis of PTSD in the United States is made using the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders volume 5 (DSM-5), which discusses an array 
of symptomology that may be characteristic of PTSD. However, using these extensive 
diagnostic criteria, it has been estimated that there are over 630,000 potential permutations 
of being diagnosed with PTSD (Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013). This vast diversity 
in presentation, time since trauma, and etiology of trauma all likely contribute to the 
impact on the immune system, and thus convolute cross-sectional studies of patients simply 
categorized with a PTSD diagnosis. The nuance of the patients' psychological trauma needs 
to be considered along with other factors relating to the PTSD diagnosis that has been 
previously discussed (Reed and Case, 2023).

Therefore, with the dearth of in-depth immune profiling in human PTSD as well as the 
limitation of studying mechanistic immune interactions in the brains of human patients, 
many researchers have again turned to animal models to obtain a better understanding 
of immune perturbations after psychological trauma. Given that RSDS is one of the only 
preclinical PTSD models that produces systemic inflammation, many animal studies have 
utilized this paradigm to study innate immune function. For example, studies have shown 
that RSDS induces increases in pro-inflammatory monocyte and macrophage populations, 
which produce IL-1β and the chemokine CCL2, and increased brain trafficking to promote 
anxiety-like behavior (Wohleb et al., 2013; McKim et al., 2018). Additionally, psychological 
trauma has also shown an association between increased trafficking of the innate cells to the 
brain and the causal emergence of anxiety-like behaviors (Wohleb et al., 2014a; Reader et 
al., 2015). Monocyte trafficking is believed to be in response to the abundant norepinephrine 
release after psychological trauma, which promotes migration into circulation, the brain, 
and lymphoid organs (Wohleb et al., 2013; Saint-Mezard et al., 2003; McKim et al., 2016). 
As mentioned previously, these monocytes interact with brain-resident microglia, which are 
major contributors to cytokine production and are implicated in various psychiatric disorders 
(Calcia et al., 2016). For example, one study identified an increase in the ratio of microglia 
to other immune cell types in the brain after electric foot-shock-induced psychological

stress in mice, and that both depletion and pharmacological blockade of microglia improved 
stress-induced memory deficits (Li et al., 2021). Other animal models of PTSD, such as the 
predator scent-stress model, demonstrated a direct correlation between microglial activation 
and the levels of anxiety-like symptoms developed (Nahum et al., 2022). Notably, the social 
defeat model has shown to significantly elevate the microglial inflammatory surface markers 
CD14, CD86, and TLR4, as well as increased IL-1β expression (Wohleb et al., 2011). In 
addition to behavioral effects, there is evidence to suggest that microglia are also implicated 
in the physiological comorbidities that afflict PTSD patients. For example, activation of 
microglia in the hippocampus following a single prolonged stress induction in rats has been 
shown to be positively correlated with chronic pain that is associated with the onset of PTSD 
(Sun et al., 2016). Moreover, this activation of hippocampal microglia in the same model 
was correlated with increased cognitive impairment as well as increased permeability of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) after stress induction (Ni et al., 2022). The compromised integrity 
of the BBB may lead to numerous pathologies of the CNS, including inflammatory diseases 
and strokes (Liu et al., 2015), both of which show enhanced risk among PTSD patients.

While the concept of activated microglia driving neuroinflammation and pathology in 
the brain is easy to understand, these findings are possibly refuted by a recent study 
that suggests an anti-inflammatory microglial response in PTSD. In this study, levels 
of the microglial translocator protein (TSPO) in the frontal circuits of human PTSD 
patients via positron emission tomography (PET) scans demonstrated a negative correlation 
between the levels of heightened peripheral inflammation in PTSD patients. These data 
were further confirmed via demonstration of lowered expression of microglia-associated 
genes in postmortem brains of PTSD patients (Bhatt et al., 2020). These findings will 
need to be validated by other groups, but provide a provocative alternative view of 
microglia in PTSD that is not recapitulated in animal models. While this may be a 
fundamental difference between humans and rodents, another possible explanation is simply 
the temporal factor. Virtually every preclinical model of PTSD examines the behavioral, 
molecular, and physiological effects shortly after a relatively acute psychological trauma. 
While these findings have illuminated potential mechanisms of how the immune system 
is initially perturbed after psychological trauma, they provide little insight into the long-
term ramifications of ongoing PTSD that may last decades in humans. Therefore, there 
is a significant need to 1) examine the consequences of psychological trauma in animal 
models at significantly later timepoints than is currently being performed and 2) investigate 
mechanisms of immune system activation in human patients at timepoints closer to the 
exposure to psychological trauma and potentially even prior to the onset of overt PTSD. 
Together, these experiments may illuminate how the immune system evolves over the course 
of PTSD from an acute traumatic experience into a long-term chronic disease.

Outside of monocytes and microglia, granulocyte responses have also been investigated 
in animal models of psychological trauma, which appear to somewhat mimic the 
aforementioned human responses. For example, in a mouse model of acute restraint stress, 
neutrophils were found to be elevated in the blood, which corresponds to what is seen 
in humans after transient stress (Tang et al., 2022). Additionally, elevated neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs) were also found in another acute rat stress model that utilized foot 
shock followed by 3 restraint stress sessions (Corsi-Zuelli et al., 2022), again mimicking

enhanced granulocytic responses after acute stress. However, in a different murine study 
that employed 1- or 2-hour water immersion restraint stress (WIR), neutrophil count and 
bactericidal activity were significantly reduced (Kinoshita et al., 2019). This finding is 
counterintuitive given that this model appears to be acute stress. Moreover, in a mouse 
model of RSDS that is thought to recapitulate chronic psychological trauma, the numbers 
of neutrophils and monocytes significantly increased in the bone marrow, blood, and spleen 
following stress (Ishikawa et al., 2021). Together, these animal findings show paradoxical 
results compared to humans, but these inconsistent findings could simply be due to the 
use of models that simply do not recapitulate specific phenomena that are characteristic 
of psychological trauma in humans. One factor that is often not considered when studying 
PTSD is severity of the psychological trauma, which is difficult to objectively assess, 
but may be a critical factor in understanding how the immune system is affected (even 
more so than time). Additionally, another critical issue lies in the fact that there are many 
mechanisms of trauma, both physical and emotional, that may lead to PTSD. Therefore, 
it would be near impossible to develop one uniform animal model that encapsulates every 
form of trauma and the different ways in which they may alter physiological sequalae. As 
discussed before, in order to overcome this hurdle, additional human studies need to be 
performed that separate PTSD patients based on the type of trauma experienced and their 
resultant physiology. This would allow for the development of more nuanced models that 
can be used to study different forms of PTSD and understand the variable pathophysiology 
that may follow, which includes not only in-depth evaluation of the innate immune system, 
but also the adaptive branch as well.

4.3.  Adaptive immune alterations in PTSD

Similar to monocytes and NK cells, studies examining B- and T-lymphocyte populations 
in PTSD are more common given their relative abundance in circulation. Several studies 
have compared B-lymphocyte populations between PTSD patients and their non-PTSD 
counterparts, and have concluded no differences in these cell types (Boscarino and Chang, 
1999; Vidović et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 1999). In contrast, T-lymphocytes do appear 
to be impacted more robustly by the effects of PTSD. First, PTSD patients have been 
demonstrated to have increased markers of activation in circulation compared to health 
controls (Wilson et al., 1999). Additionally, patients with PTSD exhibit a downward shift in 
the proportion of naive and regulatory T-lymphocytes with a concurrent increase in memory 
T-lymphocytes as compared to controls; a finding that was unable to be reversed when 
utilizing standard therapies for PTSD (Sommershof et al., 2009; Morath et al., 2014). More 
in depth characterization of T-lymphocytes has demonstrated PTSD is associated with a 
decrease in CD4 to CD8 ratio as well as an increase in the ratio of CD8 effector to naïve 
T-lymphocytes (Aiello et al., 2016). Interestingly, these effects were observed in patients 
diagnosed with PTSD within 1 year previous as well as those with lifelong PTSD (Aiello et 
al., 2016), suggesting adaptive immune effects occur relatively quickly after psychological 
trauma and are long lasting. While limited studies exist suggesting T-lymphocyte numbers 
are depressed after PTSD (Kawamura et al., 2001), the overwhelming majority suggest 
PTSD impacts T-lymphocytes to drive increased numbers, activation, and a proinflammatory 
phenotype.

Regarding function of the adaptive immune system, studies have primarily encompassed 
a variety of tests, including evaluations of vaccine response, antibody titer, and delayed 
hypersensitivity tests (DTH) within patients with PTSD. In contrast to chronic stress, 
which has been demonstrated to impair B-lymphocyte mediated immune response to 
vaccinations (Vedhara et al., 1999; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996; Glaser et al., 1998), PTSD 
does not appear to demonstrate this similar kind of antibody depression (Kosor Krnic 
et al., 2007). These studies may elucidate a clear difference between chronic stress and 
traumatic stress as it pertains to the adaptive immune system, and may suggest differential 
mechanisms between the respective conditions. In contrast, in this same study it was 
observed PTSD patients appeared to have lower numbers of antigen-specific T-lymphocytes 
prior to vaccination compared to healthy controls, but after vaccination these numbers 
were not statistically different (Kosor Krnic et al., 2007). This may suggest a potentiated T-
lymphocyte response by PTSD patients given the ability to reach healthy control levels even 
though starting at a lower point, but this observation will need additional follow-up studies 
to confirm this observation. Other investigations have studied the response of T-lymphocytes 
in PTSD patients using both skin-applied antigens and direct in vitro stimulation. In 
the skin application study, an increased number of T-lymphocytes was observed after 
antigen application, accompanied by an enhanced skin response, indicating the presence 
of more reactive T-lymphocytes from patients with PTSD (Boscarino and Chang, 1999; 
Altemus et al., 2006). Moreover, subjecting whole blood PBMCs to a CD3 antibody 
to induce a T-lymphocyte receptor-mediated response resulted in amplified proliferation 
of pro-inflammatory T-lymphocyte subtypes and a 50 % reduction in the availability of 
regulatory or anti-inflammatory T-lymphocytes (Sommershof et al., 2009). While one study 
did demonstrate that through ex vivo mitogen-induced cytokine assays that T-lymphocytes 
from individuals with PTSD exhibited lowered production levels of IFNy and IL-4, coupled 
with reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation (Kawamura et al., 2001), this study was performed 
in only 12 individuals, which does not reach the rigor to make any definitive conclusions. 
Taken together, these studies highly support minimal impact on B-lymphocytes in PTSD, 
but much stronger and likely pro-inflammatory effects on T-lymphocytes in these patients. 
Given these observations, it is imperative to delve into the mechanisms that underlie immune 
cell function in order to shed light on these processes.

While animal models have provided the means to study mechanisms linking psychological 
trauma to adaptive immune alterations, the literature is still conflicted as to the specifics 
of these neuroimmune interactions. Several early studies demonstrated that psychological 
trauma led to a suppression of adaptive immunity. For example, when utilizing restraint 
stress, investigators observed reductions in the number of lymphocytes in the spleen and 
mesentery as well as levels of circulating antibodies after an immune challenge (Fukui et 
al., 1997; Domínguez-Gerpe and Rey-Méndez, 2001). A similar result was observed in rats 
where increased levels of psychological trauma equated to decreased levels of lymphocyte 
and their functional capacities (Keller et al., 1981). Another study mimicked these effects by 
demonstrating decreased numbers of lymphocytes and antibody production in a different 
model of stress (Esterling and Rabin, 1987). However, this latter study uncovered an 
additional layer in that removal of the adrenal gland had no effect on this reduction in 
adaptive immunity (Esterling and Rabin, 1987). This observation is incredibly important,

as it eliminates a major stress-related organ as the potential signal leading to decreased 
lymphocytes and their function. However, the question remains as to why these studies 
demonstrate marked adaptive immune suppression whereas PTSD patients appear to have 
potentiated effects and increased inflammation.

The answer to this question likely lies in the etiology of the stressor as well as the 
timing. Many of these early studies examined immune populations and function immediately 
following a short-term stressor, which likely examines the effect of acute stress on the 
immune system. Indeed, many studies have demonstrated that short-term acute stress 
induces immunosuppression as opposed to activation. Therefore, significant caution needs 
to be taken when examining “stress models” in rodents, as they may not replicate 
true psychological trauma nor have the chronic nature needed to induce a long-term 
inflammatory state. With that, given the more chronic (10 day) nature of the RSDS paradigm 
combined with its reproducible production of systemic inflammation, this model serves as 
an important model in understanding the response of peripheral immunity to longer-term 
psychological trauma. Notably, our laboratory has unveiled that RSDS consistently leads to 
an increase in the levels of both systemic and T-lymphocyte-produced TNFα, IL-6, IL-17A, 
and IL-22 (Moshfegh et al., 2019; Elkhatib et al., 2020), and that this inflammation lasts 
at least 3 months past the initial psychological trauma (unpublished work). Intriguingly, 
blocking sympathetic transmission to the spleen through splenic denervation resulted in a 
complete abrogation of the T-lymphocyte response in this lymphoid organ (Elkhatib et al., 
2021). Notably, systemic inflammation was not totally attenuated, suggesting RSDS induces 
inflammation at multiple sites throughout the body likely through autonomic innervation. 
Additionally, utilizing a T-lymphocyte-specific knock-out of tyrosine hydroxylase, which 
inhibits the ability for T-lymphocytes to produce their own catecholamines, specifically 
inhibited these cells from producing IL-17A and IL-22 (Elkhatib et al., 2022). This finding 
adds an additional layer of complexity to the signaling cascade, as it suggests the brain 
and immune system both produce neurotransmitters during psychological trauma necessary 
for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition to our work, others have 
confirmed a pro-inflammatory T-lymphocyte signature after RSDS, even delineating that 
animals with worsened behavioral outcomes may have increased levels of T-lymphocyte 
inflammation (Ambrée et al., 2019). Additionally, a recent study has shown the potential for 
B-lymphocytes to also be involved in inflammation post-RSDS, but this work is still in its 
infancy and may not recapitulate human PTSD as previously discussed (Shimo et al., 2022).

In summary, the intricate relationship between psychological trauma and the adaptive 
immune system has only begun to be explored through various cellular and functional 
assays, both in human subjects and animal models. From these studies, T-lymphocytes have 
emerged as a key player in the immune dysregulation associated with PTSD. These human 
studies, supported with insights from animal models, shed light on the potential mechanisms 
underlying adaptive immune alterations in PTSD. The role that the autonomic nervous 
system could have in driving these immune changes highlights a potential therapeutic target 
for intervention. Further unraveling the complex interplay between psychological trauma 
and immune cell function holds promise for understanding the increased risk of immune 
dysregulation and disease in individuals with PTSD and developing new therapies for their 
treatment.

5.  Conclusions and considerations moving forward

Current therapies for PTSD focus solely on the behavioral manifestations of the disease, 
with no consideration for the consequences of inflammation. In fact, while it is well-
accepted that elevated inflammation is often associated with somatic diseases such as 
cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, it still remains unclear if the elevated inflammation 
associated with PTSD is mechanistic to the development of these physiological diseases 
after psychological trauma. Furthermore, studies that have examined inflammation before 
and after standard therapies for PTSD are virtually non-existent. Of the few studies that 
have attempted such investigation, the results are mixed as to the impact on inflammation 
with standard PTSD treatment (Himmerich et al., 2016; Sagarwala and Nasrallah, 2019). 
This provocative observation suggests the potential for the uncoupling of PTSD behavioral 
manifestations from physiological/inflammatory consequences. Moreover, this finding 
may also suggest that psychological trauma alone (independent of the development of 
clinical PTSD based on behavior) may lead to physiological and immune alterations (as 
demonstrated recently (Koirala et al., 2023)), which may often go undiagnosed due to a 
lack of seeking help in the absence of behavioral changes. We have observed this exact 
phenomenon in our own laboratory in that not all behavior manifestations of psychological 
trauma correlate with inflammation, which again, suggests multiple mechanisms at play 
(Elkhatib et al., 2020).

Given this, we propose three areas of research that need further investigation and research. 
First, as described previously, in depth immunological analyses need to be performed on 
patients with PTSD. However, cross sectional studies are not appropriate for these types of 
analyses due to the variability of psychological trauma, time since the trauma, and existing 
development of PTSD. Instead, patients should be recruited at the time of psychological 
trauma before the development of PTSD, and followed over time to understand how/when 
inflammation begins, how it may contribute or be predictive of PTSD, and how it may 
lead to other inflammatory diseases later in life. This type of recruitment is already being 
performed and investigated for potential interventions that can prevent the development of 
PTSD after a traumatic incident (Rothbaum et al., 2012; Iyadurai et al., 2018; Kanstrup et 
al., 2021; Horsch et al., 2017). In these studies, patients are screened for traumatic incidents 
at intake of emergency rooms, and then enrolled in prevention studies in attempts to limit 
the development of PTSD. Using this same kind of model, these patients could also be 
screened temporally for immunological and inflammatory parameters, and even assess how 
these change with different therapeutic modalities. Alternatively, pre- and post-deployment 
studies of military personnel would also be appropriate, as they allow for the assessment of 
inflammation even prior to psychological trauma. While these types of studies have been 
performed in the past, the assessment of inflammation and immune function have often been 
significantly limited to only one or a few inflammatory proteins, and should be expanded 
to include additional inflammatory proteins, cellular targets, and the association with the 
known symptom clusters of PTSD. Second, comprehensive assessments of inflammation 
before and after standard PTSD therapies need to be performed. It is imperative that we fully 
understand if attenuation of the behavioral manifestations of PTSD are sufficient to reverse 
the physiological consequences of the disease. We would suggest not limiting these types of

examinations only to the immune system, but to other organ systems that are also affected 
by PTSD, such as the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Last, research into the 
mechanisms linking psychological trauma to inflammation and physiological diseases is 
highly warranted. While these studies will likely first occur in animal models, in depth 
neural, immunological, and inflammatory mechanisms need to be elucidated to understand 
how psychological trauma affects downstream pathology. In doing so, these investigations 
will likely produce novel targets for therapeutic intervention that may alter our thinking of 
PTSD as a disease and how we treat it. In summary, based on the emerging literature, it is 
our belief that PTSD patients need evaluation and treatment beyond the scope of psychiatry, 
and should be considered complex internal medicine patients that require complete somatic 
workups with comprehensive medical therapies. However, we understand that to get to this 
point, the field needs to fully appreciate and understand the mechanisms underlying this 
complex disorder so that we may view it not only as a behavioral disorder, but a systemic 
one.

Fig. 1. 
Overview of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The classic delineation is to break 
the immune system into two major components: innate and adaptive. These two classes 
of immune cells differ in their ability to form long-term memory of previous immune 
challenges, however, this notion is also being challenged. While this classification is still the 
standard in the field, it is well known these two branches do not work independently, but in 
concert with one another to mount a complete immune response.
