Abstract

OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stress disorder that develops in only 
some individuals following a traumatic event. Data suggest that a substantial fraction of women 
recover after sexual violence. Thus, the investigation of stress and anti-stress neuropeptides in this 
sample has the potential to inform the neurochemistry of resilience following trauma. Nociceptin 
is an anti-stress neuropeptide in the brain that promotes resilience in animal models of PTSD.

METHODS: [11C]NOP-1A PET was used to measure the in vivo binding to nociceptin receptors 
in 18 college women who had experienced sexual violence irrespective of whether they met 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD. [11C]NOP-1A data from 18 healthy controls was also 
included to provide a contrast with the sexual violence group. [11C]NOP-1A total distribution 
volume (VT) in the regions of interest were measured with kinetic analysis using the arterial input 
function. The relationships between regional VT and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total 
symptom and subscale severity were examined using correlational analyses.

RESULTS: No differences in [11C]NOP-1A VT were noted between the sexual violence and 
control groups. VT in the midbrain and cerebellum were positively correlated with PTSD total 
symptom severity in the past month prior to PET. Intrusion/re-experiencing and avoidance 
subscale symptoms drove this relationship. Stratification of subjects by a DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis 
and contrasting their VT with that in controls showed no group differences.

CONCLUSION: Decreased midbrain and cerebellum nociceptin receptors are associated with 
less severe PTSD symptoms. Medications that target nociceptin should be explored to prevent and 
treat PTSD.

INTRODUCTION

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stress disorder characterized by altered fear 
conditioning and memory reconsolidation following a traumatic event (1). The traumatic 
event most commonly preceding PTSD in women is sexual violence. A substantial fraction 
of women will experience sexual violence in adolescence or adulthood. An estimated 30 to 
80% of these women will be diagnosed with PTSD during their lifetime, and current PTSD 
prevalence in this group approaches 15% (2–5). In contrast, the lifetime and current 
prevalence rates for PTSD (both genders) from all trauma is 6.8% and 3.6%, respectively 
(6). These trends suggest both higher prevalence of and greater recovery from PTSD 
following sexual violence as compared with other traumas. Understanding the 
neurochemistry of recovery in women who have experienced sexual violence has the 
potential to inform therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat the symptoms of PTSD.

Ross and colleagues outline a framework for PTSD in which the three core DSM-5 symptom 
clusters of intrusive recollection, avoidance, and increased arousal can be viewed as 
abnormalities in classical fear conditioning, negative reinforcement, and sympathetic 
nervous system/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response, respectively (1). This 
allows for the conceptualization of PTSD primarily as a learning and memory disorder in 
which abnormal trauma memory reconsolidation/extinction leads to intrusive thoughts and 
subsequent avoidance of trauma-related memories (i.e., DSM-5 PTSD criterion B and C 
symptoms). Other PTSD symptoms including negative alterations in mood and cognition 
and increased arousal/reactivity (i.e., criterion D and E symptoms) are secondary 
manifestations. FDA approved medications to treat PTSD such as sertraline and paroxetine 
are effective for the most part in treating these secondary symptoms and do not address the 
primary intrusion symptoms (7, 8). The results of recent clinical trials with medications such 
as prazosin and propranolol targeting the primary symptoms in PTSD have been mixed (9–
11). Linking novel neurochemical targets with PTSD symptom clusters may allow for the 
identification of new medications to treat the primary symptoms of PTSD.

Nociceptin (N/OFQ), which binds to the nociceptive opioid peptide receptor (NOP) is an 
anti-stress/resilience-regulating neuropeptide (12). Recent PET studies with [11C] (S)-3-(2’-
fluoro-6’,7’-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,4’-thieno[3,2-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-fluorobenzyl)-N-
methylpropanamide (NOP-1A) allow for the investigation of NOP (13–17). N/OFQ 
stimulation of NOP receptors inhibit calcium and activates potassium ion channels (18). This 
allows NOP receptors to regulate the in vivo release of multiple neurotransmitters, including 
glutamate, gamma-amino butyric acid, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine, (19). This 
mechanism may be of value in targeting the neurochemical abnormalities in PTSD, which 
involve excitatory, inhibitory and monoamine transmission (20). Studies in control animals 
show a reduction in the number of amygdala NOP receptors during fear conditioning and

expression (21). However, in animals with dysregulated fear either an upregulation or no 
change in NOP receptors is observed in regions such as the amygdala, hippocampus and 
midbrain (21, 22). These findings have been interpreted variously as representing either an 
increase or decrease in N/OFQ signaling in PTSD (21, 22). Intriguingly, these contradictory 
interpretations are supported by studies showing a NOP antagonist and NOP agonist are 
both effective in alleviating fear, anxiety and pain in rodent models of PTSD (21, 22). In 
summary, the preclinical literature is mixed with respect to the status of N/OFQ and NOP in 
animal models of PTSD. In a first step to examine NOP receptors in subjects with a history 
of trauma, we used PET to measure the in vivo binding of [11C]NOP-1A in college women 
exposed to sexual violence. Consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) 
initiative, we scanned subjects irrespective of whether they met the full DSM-5 diagnostic 
criteria for PTSD. We focused on sexual violence in adolescence and early adulthood to 
minimize the impact of childhood trauma on NOP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human Subjects

The University of Pittsburgh IRB approved the study. All subjects provided written informed 
consent. Subjects were recruited via advertisements in college newspapers, online ads, a 
university research registry and college campus sexual assault survivor support groups.

Study criteria for women who have experienced sexual violence were: (1) females 18–25 
years old who (2) experienced sexual violence as a teenager or young adult (14 to 25 years 
of age) excluding subjects with acute trauma (< past 30 days); (3) no history of childhood 
physical or sexual abuse; (4) no history of DSM-5 psychiatric or addictive disorders other 
than PTSD; (5) no current use of any drugs of abuse; (6) not currently on psychotropic 
medication; (7) no medical or neurological illnesses; (8) not currently pregnant; (9) no 
significant prior exposure to radiation; (10) no contraindications for MRI.

Study criteria for controls were: (1) females 18–25 years old; (2) no history of exposure to 
actual or threatened sexual violence; (3) no history of childhood physical or sexual abuse; 
(4) no history of DSM-5 disorders; and criteria 5 through 10 as listed above.

Clinical assessments performed included the: (i) Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 to 
exclude any psychiatric and addictive disorders other than PTSD (23), (ii) Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) to assess PTSD symptom severity. This 
scale measured the severity of PTSD symptoms as experienced by the subject in the past 
month prior to PET (past month), and in the worst month after sexual violence (worst 
month). CAPS-5 scores for the worst month were obtained via the subjects’ recall of the 
symptoms suffered months or years ago. CAPS-5 total symptom severity scores were 
calculated by summing severity scores of the individual symptoms in all four clusters: 
intrusion symptoms (cluster B), avoidance symptoms (cluster C), cognitive and mood 
symptoms (cluster D), and arousal and reactivity symptoms (cluster E) (24), (iii) Life 
Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) to exclude any childhood physical or sexual abuse (25), 
(iv) Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Depression (HAM-D) (26, 27), and 
(v) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to quantify alcohol abuse (28).

Image acquisition and analysis

Prior to PET imaging, a structural MRI scan was obtained using a Siemens 3T Trio scanner 
for brain region of interest determination. The synthesis of [11C]NOP-1A was carried out as 
previously described (13). PET imaging sessions were conducted with the Siemens 
Biograph64 mCT scanner. The injected dose and mass of [11C]NOP-1A were restricted to 
12 mCi and ≤ 4.2 μg ( 29). Following a low-dose CT scan of the brain acquired for 
attenuation correction, subjects received an intravenous bolus injection of [11C]NOP-1A and 
emission data were collected for 70 minutes (17). Metabolite-corrected arterial input 
function measurements were performed and analyzed as described in (13, 16, 17, 29, 30). 
Free fraction (fP) was determined in plasma and a saline buffer (to determine filter retention 
of the free tracer) using ultrafiltration (31, 32).

PET data were reconstructed using filtered back projection. The image analysis software 
PMOD was used to conduct frame-to-frame motion correction and MR-PET coregistration. 
Regions of interest were generated for each subject using the built-in brain parcellation 
work-flow within PMOD’s Neuro Tool (PNEURO). Region generation was based on the 
AAL-VOIs atlas (33, 34). Regions of interest (ROIs) included the amygdala, hippocampus, 
insula, midbrain, cerebellum, striatum (ventral striatum, caudate and putamen), and 
prefrontal cortex (specifically the dorsolateral, orbital, medial, and anterior cingulate cortex) 
subdivisions (30). All regions generated were visually inspected and adjusted as deemed 
necessary by an image analyst trained in manual region drawing. Regional volumes and time 
activity curves were also generated in PMOD. Derivation of [11C]NOP-1A volume of 
distribution expressed relative to total plasma concentration (VT) in the regions of interest 
were performed using a two-tissue compartment kinetic analysis using the arterial input 
function implemented in MATLAB (17, 29, 35). VT, which includes both the receptor-bound 
specific and non-specific binding, was used as the outcome measure (16).

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS v.25. Comparisons between the 
sexual violence and healthy control groups on the demographic variables and baseline scan 
parameters (such as injected dose, mass, plasma clearance) were performed with unpaired t-
tests. The primary analyses conducted were correlational in nature, because not all subjects 
who had experienced sexual violence met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD. 
Normality of the data used were confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk tests prior to correlations. 
The relationship between regional [11C]NOP-1A VT and the severity of CAPS-5 PTSD 
symptoms (past and worst months) were examined with Pearson product moment correlation 
coefficient. The same test was also used to explore relationships between regional 
[11C]NOP-1A VT and other clinical rating scales, such as HAM-A, HAM-D and AUDIT. 
DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis-based group differences in [11C]NOP-1A VT were also explored 
with a linear mixed model (LMM) analysis performed with ROI as a repeated measure and 
diagnosis as the fixed factor. Regions and diagnosis by regions interaction were included in 
the model as explanatory variables. A two-tailed probability value of p < 0.05 was selected 
as the significance level for all analyses.

RESULTS

Eighteen women who had experienced sexual violence were matched with 18 controls on 
age, ethnicity, and nicotine status. Nine of 18 subjects in the sexual violence group met 
CAPS-5 PTSD diagnostic criteria in the past month (PTSD-PM); an additional 5 subjects 
met the CAPS-5 PTSD diagnostic criteria in their worst (PTSD-WM) but not past month; 
and 4 subjects did not meet the CAPS-5 PTSD diagnostic criteria in their worst or past 
month (RESILIENT). Table 1 lists demographic variables and clinical characteristics of the 
study sample. Sexual violence subjects had significantly higher anxiety, depression and life 
stressors (other LSC-R traumatic events reported by the sexual violence subjects are 
included in the supplement, Table S1) compared to controls. No significant group 
differences were observed in the AUDIT scores.

[11C]NOP-1A PET scan data

Tables 2 and 3 shows [11C]NOP-1A scan parameters and regional VT in women who have 
experienced sexual violence and controls. No significant between-group differences were 
noted in any of the scan parameters (see Table 2), regional volumes (data not shown) and VT 
(LMM effect of group, F (1, 34) = 0.15, p = 0.70; effect of region, F (11, 374) = 537.07, p < 
0.001, region * diagnosis interaction, F (11, 374) = 0.48, p = 0.92, see data in Table 3).

Relationship between VT and CAPS-5 symptoms:

In the past month prior to PET—There were significant positive correlations between 
VT and past month CAPS-5 total symptom severity scores (bivariate). This relationship was 
significant in the midbrain and cerebellum (Figure 1), but not other ROIs (data not shown). 
These relationships remained significant with the use of non-parametric Spearman’s rank-
order correlation tests (see supplement). These relationships were also significant when 
examined with partial correlations that controlled for the effect of HAM-D scores (midbrain, 
r = 0.77, p = 0.0003; and cerebellum, r = 0.79, p = 0.00015). Although there was no 
relationship between HAM-D scores and VT (see supplement) this was done because the 
spread of the HAM-D scores in the sexual violence group was relatively large (5 to 17; with 
six out of eighteen sexual violence subjects with HAM-D scores ≥ 10). These partial, but not 
bivariate correlations survived the Bonferroni correction (12 regions × 2 sets of CAPS-5 
scores, past-month and worst-month; p = 0.05/24 ≤ 0.002).

Removal of the four RESILIENT subjects who did not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD in 
their worst or past month had no effect on the statistical significance of these correlations. 
Removal of the two subjects who used nicotine did not alter the correlation coefficient (r), 
but it changed the p-values for the relationships between past month CAPS-5 total severity 
scores and VT to trend-level (see supplement, Table S3).

Midbrain and cerebellum VT were positively correlated with past month clusters B (see 
Figure 2) and C (midbrain: r = 0.53, p = 0.02, and cerebellum: r = 0.54, p = 0.02), but not D 
(midbrain: r = 0.28, p = 0.25, and cerebellum: r = 0.28, p = 0.26) and E severity scores 
(midbrain: r = 0.40, p = 0.10, and cerebellum: r = 0.37, p = 0.13).

In the worst month after sexual violence—There were no significant correlations 
between VT and worst month CAPS-5 total symptom (or cluster) severity scores.

Relationship between VT and other clinical parameters

No significant relationships were noted between regional VT and HAM-A, HAM-D and 
AUDIT scores in the control or sexual violence groups. There was also no relationship 
between VT and the time that had elapsed since sexual violence (i.e., trauma window, see 
supplemental data).

DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis and [11C]NOP-1A VT

No differences in [11C]NOP-1A VT were observed in subjects with a diagnosis of PTSD-PM 
(n = 9 out of 18 in sexual violence group) compared to controls (LMM, effect of diagnosis, 
F (1, 25) = 0.27, p = 0.61; effect of region, F (11, 275) = 315.29, p < 0.001, region * 
diagnosis interaction, F (11, 275) = 0.42, p = 0.95).

No differences in [11C]NOP-1A VT were observed in subjects with a diagnosis of PTSD-
WM (n = 14 out of 18 in sexual violence group) compared to controls (LMM, effect of 
diagnosis, F (1, 30) = 0.08, p = 0.78; effect of region, F (11, 330) = 434.95, p < 0.001, region 
* diagnosis interaction, F (11, 330) = 0.55, p = 0.87).

DISCUSSION

In this [11C]NOP-1A PET imaging study, we scanned college women who had experienced 
sexual violence irrespective of whether they met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD in 
the past or worst month. The results of this study show that increased midbrain and 
cerebellum VT is related to greater PTSD symptoms. This relationship with VT was 
significant for PTSD symptoms experienced in the recent past, but not worst month since 
sexual violence. This suggests that increased NOP receptors in women who have 
experienced sexual violence is an adaptive response to ongoing as opposed to historical 
PTSD symptoms. However, these PET data do not exclude the possibility that women with 
increased NOP-R (e.g., genetically determined) may be at greater risk to develop long-
lasting PTSD symptoms. This interpretation is supported by the inclusion of women who 
were resilient and recovered from PTSD in this study. The intrusion, re-experiencing, and 
avoidance symptoms presently considered primary features of PTSD were strongly 
associated with VT (1). No such associations were noted with the secondary mood, 
cognition, arousal and reactivity symptoms of PTSD. DSM-5 based stratification of the 
sexual violence subjects into groups (PTSD-PM, PTSD-WM and RESILIENT) and 
contrasting them with controls revealed no differences in VT.

The positive association observed between PTSD symptom severity and [11C]NOP-1A VT 
in the midbrain and cerebellum suggest a role for N/OFQ and NOP in recovery following 
trauma. An increase in NOP mRNA in the limbic-related brain regions has been reported 
following restraint stress (37), social defeat stress (38), social crowding (39) and the single-
prolonged stress exposure paradigm (22). Increases in N/OFQ signaling could be 
accomplished either via increased N/OFQ release or an upregulation of NOP receptors. 
Studies have reported mixed results and lack consensus with respect to whether N/OFQ

levels increase in the brain following stress (37, 40–42). This has led to the postulation that 
an upregulation of NOP receptors in response to stress is an adaptive physiological response 
to enhance N/OFQ signaling in the brain (37). Further supportive of this is a study in which 
an upregulation of NOP, but not N/OFQ mRNA, was observed in the bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis following an acute increase in the stress-mediating neuropeptide corticotrophin 
releasing factor (43). Increased NOP in more severe PTSD might also reflect lower levels of 
the endogenous neurotransmitter N/OFQ. Such lines of reasoning would support a 
therapeutic role for NOP agonists in promoting both resilience and recovery in PTSD (21, 
44). Intriguingly, a retrospective study found that the weak NOP agonist buprenorphine was 
more effective than opioid agonists, which have no NOP affinity, in improving PTSD 
symptoms in veterans with chronic pain and opioid use disorders (45). However, animal 
studies also support a role for NOP antagonists in treating PTSD (22, 46). The correlational 
results from this PET study implicate NOP, but do not necessarily inform the field as to 
whether a NOP agonist or antagonist will be successful in treating PTSD. Future clinical 
trials with NOP compounds are necessary to clarify their therapeutic role, if any, in PTSD.

The correlational findings in this study involved the midbrain (substantia nigra, raphe 
nucleus, ventral tegmental area and red nucleus) and cerebellum. The involvement of the 
midbrain and cerebellum in a cerebellar-limbic-thalamo-cortical network that functions as an 
innate alarm system in response to a threat is consistent with emerging imaging literature in 
PTSD (47). In addition to the established role of the midbrain in regulating startle, 
hypervigilance and escape, these studies suggest that the midbrain and cerebellum process 
subconscious fear- and trauma-related cues in PTSD (48, 49). The periaqueductal gray 
matter (PAG), a part of the midbrain, elicits adaptive behaviors in response to a threat (50). 
The cerebellum, which receives teaching signals via climbing fibers from the olivary 
nucleus, is involved in the learning of complex cognitive processes including emotions (50). 
Studies also suggest that the cerebellum plays a role similar to the amygdala in the 
consolidation of fear-conditioned memories and fear expression (51). Basic studies have also 
demonstrated direct and indirect (via inferior olivary nucleus) connections between the PAG 
and the cerebellum (50). The PAG gates sensory information to the cerebellum via these 
connections. It also influences the motor output from cerebellar nuclei, which when 
combined with its own control over spinal motor reflex pathways allows an animal to freeze, 
get ready and escape danger (50, 52). In summary, basic data suggest that the clinical 
correlations involving the midbrain and cerebellum are relevant. However, replication of 
these correlational findings in a larger sample of individuals with more diverse traumatic 
experiences is necessary to confirm them.

Numerous investigations have implicated N/OFQ and NOP in animal models of learning and 
memory (reviewed in 44). N/OFQ impairs fear acquisition and memory consolidation in a 
range of behavioral paradigms, including the contextual/auditory fear conditioning, object 
recognition, passive avoidance learning and water maze tests. It also disrupts the retrieval 
and reconsolidation of previously consolidated traumatic memories (53). N/OFQ inhibits K+ 
stimulated glutamate release by ~38% in rodent cerebellum and midbrain slices; the exact 
same regions in which we observed clinical correlations between NOP and intrusive 
symptoms (54). The mechanism by which N/OFQ disrupts trauma-related memory 
consolidation involves its ability to inhibit glutamate release and interrupt NMDA-mediated

long-term potentiation (44, 55). N/OFQ also inhibits the release of monoamine 
neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine; all of 
which are involved in cue-induced and context dependent learning, and likely relevant to its 
ability to disrupt the formation of trauma-related memories (44). Increased NOP receptors in 
women with intrusive trauma-related memories after sexual violence might be reflective of a 
continued effort by the brain to enhance N/OFQ signaling to reduce glutamate and 
monoamine transmission. Imaging studies examining the interactions between NOP – 
glutamate, NOP – dopamine, and linking them with intrusive traumatic memories and fear 
expression in PTSD are necessary to clarify this mechanism. The lack of a relationship 
between [11C]NOP-1A VT and anxiety/depressive symptoms is inconsistent with basic 
reports (56). The relatively low level of anxiety and depressive symptoms (scores on HAM-
A = 7 ± 3; and HAM-D = 8 ± 3) in subjects who had experienced sexual violence may have 
contributed to the inability to detect a relationship with VT. However, the failure to observe 
this relationship is consistent with what we have recently reported with [11C]NOP-1A PET 
in individuals with addictive disorders (30). There were no DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis-based 
group differences in VT compared to healthy controls (see Figure 3). It is tempting to ascribe 
this to an insufficient number of subjects with a diagnosis of PTSD in this study. However, 
the effect size to detect group differences between individuals with PTSD in the past month 
vs. controls is a modest 0.46 (when derived using data from the midbrain, the region in 
which we found the strongest clinical correlation- see Figure 3). Power calculations using 
this effect size suggest a need to enroll n = 124 subjects/group to detect between-group 
differences when using a two tailed unpaired t-test with a p-value < 0.05. Future 
[11C]NOP-1A studies in psychiatric and addictive disorders should focus not only 
demonstrating group differences, but also examine the relationship between NOP VT and 
clinical symptoms.

A limitation of the study is that it is unclear whether factors such as the phase of menstrual 
cycle, hormonal contraceptive use, and nicotine use influenced the correlational findings 
observed in this study. No studies have examined the effects of menstrual cycle phases on 
NOP receptor expression in brain regions such as the midbrain and cerebellum. However, 
recent investigations in the spinal cord trigeminal neurons and hypothalamus (a unique brain 
region, which regulates the synthesis of sex steroids) suggest that the progesterone to 
estrogen ratio, which fluctuates during the menstrual cycle influences NOP receptor 
expression and binding. These studies have reported increases in NOP in the hypothalamic 
nuclei following both estrogen and estrogen + progesterone treatment; and decreases in NOP 
in the trigeminal neurons during the proestrous (high estrogen/low progesterone) compared 
to diestrous (low estrogen/high progesterone) phase of the rodent menstrual cycle (57, 58). It 
is unclear as to whether, and how menstrual cycle phase may have influenced [11C]NOP-1A 
VT measurements in the midbrain and cerebellum in this imaging study. A retrospective 
evaluation of the phase of menstrual cycle based on the subjects’ self-reported last menstrual 
period before the scan shows that the majority of women with a history of sexual violence 
were scanned either in the luteal phase or when on a hormone-based contraceptive (n = 
16/18, see Table 1). This is reassuring as it suggests relative stability in estrogen and 
progesterone levels at the time of the PET scan in women who experienced sexual violence, 
despite higher levels in luteal phase (n = 5), and lower levels on hormonal contraceptives (n

= 11) (59, 60). Furthermore, no significant differences in VT in the midbrain and cerebellum 
in women scanned in follicular phase, luteal phase, or hormone-based contraceptives also 
suggest a limited effect for sex-hormone ratio on NOP binding (Supplement, Table S2). 
Nevertheless, it seems prudent for future [11C]NOP-1A PET studies in women to measure 
serum estrogen and progesterone levels at time of the PET scan to exclude the effects of sex 
hormones on VT. With respect to another confound, the use of nicotine, only 2/18 subjects 
who experienced sexual violence were smokers. Excluding these individuals from the 
analysis did not change correlation coefficient (r), but it changed the p-value to a trend (from 
significant) for the relationship between VT and CAPS-5 total symptom severity (this was 
not the case for the relationship between CAPS-5 intrusion symptoms and VT). This is likely 
attributable to a loss of power as opposed to the influence of smoking status on the 
relationship. This interpretation is supported by our legacy [11C]NOP-1A data in healthy 
controls in which we find no significant differences in VT based on smoking status 
(Supplement, Table S4). Based on this we conclude that the impact of smoking is minimal 
on the findings reported in this study. Other limitations of the study are the exclusion of a 
clinically representative sample of PTSD with more diverse trauma and severe symptoms 
because of the concerns of comorbidity and psychiatric medications. The inability to exclude 
individual differences in [11C]NOP-1A non-specific binding (VND) as a contributor to VT is 
also a concern for which there was no technical solution. This concern is somewhat 
alleviated by prior blocking studies in humans that have demonstrated that 50–75% of 
[11C]NOP-1A VT represents specific binding to NOP (61). In summary, we showed a 
relationship between [11C]NOP-1A VT and the severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms 
in college women who had experienced sexual violence during adolescence/young 
adulthood. These correlational data were also supportive of a role for NOP in mediating 
trauma-related intrusion and avoidance symptoms. The approach used in this study 
highlights the continued need to investigate the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders 
using a DSM-5 agnostic approach as recommended in the NIMH RDoC initiative.

Figure 3. 
shows the lack of DSM-5 based diagnostic group differences in [11C]NOP-1A midbrain 
binding between PTSD in past month (PM) vs. PTSD in worst month (WM) vs. no PTSD in 
past and/or worst month (RESILIENT) vs. healthy controls with no prior history of sexual 
violence.
