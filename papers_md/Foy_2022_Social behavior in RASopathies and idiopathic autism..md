Abstract 
Background:  RASopathies are genetic syndromes that result from pathogenic variants in the RAS-MAPK cellular sign-
aling pathway. These syndromes, which include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous 
syndrome, and Costello syndrome, are associated with a complex array of medical and behavioral health complica-
tions. Despite a heightened risk for social challenges and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), few studies have compared 
different aspects of social behavior across these conditions. It is also unknown whether the underlying neuropsycho-
logical characteristics that contribute to social competence and socially empathetic (“prosocial”) behaviors differ in 
children with RASopathies as compared to children with nonsyndromic (i.e., idiopathic) ASD.

Results:  As compared to children with idiopathic ASD, children with RASopathies were rated as demonstrating more 
resilience in the domain of empathy relative to their overall social competence. Similarities and differences emerged 
in the psychological factors that predicted social behavior in these two groups. Stronger communication skills and 
fewer hyperactive-impulsive behaviors were associated with increased empathy and social competence for both 
groups. Greater emotional challenges were associated with lower social competence for children with RASopathies 
and stronger empathy for children with idiopathic ASD. Among children with RASopathy and a co-occurring ASD 
diagnosis, socially empathetic behaviors were observed more often as compared to children with idiopathic ASD.

Conclusions:  Findings suggest that the development of social behavior among children with RASopathies involves a 
distinct pattern of strengths and weaknesses as compared to a behaviorally defined disorder (idiopathic ASD). Identifi-
cation of areas of resilience as well as behavioral and social challenges will support more targeted intervention.

Background
The “RASopathies” are a set of clinically similar genetic 
syndromes that result from pathogenic variants within 
the  RAS-MAPK  pathway,  a  cellular  signaling  path-
way  whose  functions  include  regulating  growth  fac-
tors and embryological development [1]. Children with 
RASopathies  manifest  physical,  medical,  and  behavio-
ral  characteristics  that  vary  widely  in  severity  across

individuals.  Features  spanning  the  RASopathy  spec-
trum include short stature and growth issues, dermato-
logical findings,  cardiac disease, and increased risk for 
oncologic  conditions.  The  two  most  common  RASo-
pathies  are  neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1;  estimated 
incidence of 1:3000 births) and Noonan syndrome (NS; 
1:1000  to  1:2500),  which  are  caused  by  alterations  of 
genes  encoding  upstream  components  or  regulators  of 
RAS-MAPK  signaling  [2–4].  Less  common  RASopa-
thies  include  cardiofaciocutaneous  syndrome  (CFCS; 
1:810,000)  and  Costello  syndrome  (CS;  1:1.29  million), 
which  are  associated  with  dysregulation  of  molecules 
that function downstream in the signaling cascade [5]. 
Neuropsychological  challenges  occur  more  frequently 
in  all  RASopathies  relative  to  the  general  population, 
including  cognitive  and  learning  disabilities;  problems 
with  attention,  hyperactivity,  and  impulsivity;  lan-
guage impairments; and social and emotional problems 
[6–10]. There is considerable association between gen-
otype  and  neurodevelopmental  phenotype  in  RASopa-
thies. CFCS and CS are frequently associated with mild 
to severe intellectual disability, whereas intellectual dis-
ability is infrequent (< 20%) in NF1 and NS [11–13].

Concerns within the social domain are widely observed 
across  RASopathies,  and  clinical  assessments  indicate 
a  higher  than  expected  prevalence  of  autism  spectrum 
disorder  (ASD)  symptomatology  and  diagnosis  [6,  7, 
14–17].  The  nature  of  social  behavior  in  RASopathies 
relative  to  ASD,  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder  defined 
by behavioral criteria, is nevertheless poorly understood 
[18].  Diagnosis  of  ASD  requires  the  presence  of  impair-
ments in social communication and interaction as well as 
restricted  or  repetitive  activities,  interests,  or  behaviors 
[19].  Population  studies  estimate  that  1  in  54  children 
have ASD, with boys being four times as likely as girls to 
have  this  diagnosis  [20].  Genomic  sequencing  suggests 
that more than 30% of ASD cases may be accounted for 
by chromosomal, de novo gene mutation and copy num-
ber  variants  [21].  Among  “syndromic”  forms  of  ASD, 
in  which  ASD  presentation  is  associated  with  a  known 
genetic  syndrome,  presentation  of  ASD  symptomatol-
ogy  and  other  behavioral  features  can  deviate  to  some 
extent  from  the  typical  presentation  of  idiopathic  ASD 
(iASD), where no specific molecular pathology has been 
identified  [22–24].  Defining  the  degree  of  convergence 
between “behaviorally defined” and “molecularly defined” 
social impairment is an important step toward determin-
ing whether and how specific biological pathways present 
risk for ASD symptomatology. Furthermore, an improved 
understanding  of  how  social  impairment  arises  in  chil-
dren with genetic syndromes will guide the development 
of  more  optimal  screening  and  intervention  approaches 
for these populations.

While  an  expanding  number  of  studies  are  reporting 
an  increased  risk  for  social  problems  among  individuals 
with RASopathies, the conceptualization of RASopathies 
as a form of “syndromic autism” [25] is likely an oversim-
plification  for  several  reasons.  First,  a  sizeable  subgroup 
of children with RASopathies exhibit intact social behav-
ioral  characteristics,  or  even  have  a  relative  strength  in 
social  functioning  despite  pronounced  intellectual  or 
learning deficits [26–29]. Efforts to understand the resil-
ience of social function in this subset of individuals may 
therefore be as instructive as focusing on individuals with 
more  severe  deficits.  Second,  individuals  with  milder  or 
“subclinical”  social  impairment  comprise  another  sig-
nificant  subset  of  children  with  RASopathies,  and  these 
children often do not meet diagnostic criteria for ASD on 
clinical  evaluation  [14].  Families  of  children  with  these 
milder  symptoms  may  struggle  to  obtain  resources  to 
support better social functioning, since these symptoms 
may be perceived as secondary to deficits in other areas 
(e.g.,  cognitive  impairment,  ADHD).  Access  to  poten-
tially  useful  treatments  (e.g.,  social  skills  training,  early 
intensive  behavioral  intervention)  often  requires  a  clini-
cal  or  educational  diagnosis  of  ASD,  which  may  not  be 
applicable  in  these  cases.  Finally,  while  there  is  a  subset 
of  individuals  with  RASopathies  who  exhibit  behavio-
ral  characteristics  consistent  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of 
ASD, the extent to which these characteristics arise in the 
context of similar neurobehavioral patterns to iASD has 
only begun to be explored, with mixed results [6, 30].

Estimates  of  ASD  prevalence  among  individuals  with 
RASopathies  have  varied  widely  across  studies.  These 
estimates  appear  to  depend  heavily  upon  the  specific 
assessment tools and methodology used as well as study 
sample  characteristics  [18].  Among  clinically  referred 
cohorts,  ASD  estimates  in  RASopathies  are  generally 
higher  as  compared  to  epidemiological  samples  [16]. 
Some  evidence  suggests  that  individuals  with  comorbid 
autism  and  RASopathy  diagnoses  (RAS+ASD)  present 
with  a  distinct  phenotype  characterized  by  pronounced 
impairments  in  social  communication  (e.g.,  difficulty 
interpreting social cues), but fewer restricted and repeti-
tive behaviors than typically observed in iASD [30]. Other 
research has failed to ascertain a unique RAS+ASD phe-
notype  using  quantitative  caregiver  report  measures  or 
ASD diagnostic instruments [6, 31].

Delineating  the  pattern  of  strengths  and  weaknesses 
across  different  components  of  social  functioning  is 
one  approach  that  may  be  helpful  in  understanding 
how  social  development  in  RASopathies  compares  with 
iASD.  Although  most  studies  have  focused  on  quantify-
ing  the  increased  risk  of  social  deficits  relative  to  unaf-
fected  peers,  there  is  intriguing  evidence  that  children 
with RASopathies may function relatively well in specific

aspects  of  social  functioning.  In  particular,  studies  have 
reported  behaviors  and  personality  characteristics  that 
reflect  a  desire  to  be  helpful,  caring,  or  socially  con-
nected. Individuals with NS have been described to show 
a  tendency  toward  friendliness,  cooperativeness,  and 
desire  to  please,  reflecting  a  socially  desirable  attitude 
[26]. Additionally, children with NF1 have been found to 
be rated as more extraverted than their typically develop-
ing  peers  [32].  In  a  study  investigating  teacher  and  peer 
perceptions about children with NF1, students with NF1 
were  rated  as  displaying  less  leadership  behavior  and 
exhibiting  greater  social  isolation  and  sensitivity  than 
their age-matched peers. However, teachers notably rated 
children  with  NF1  as  being  more  prosocial  (e.g.,  polite, 
helpful  to  others)  than  other  children  in  the  classroom 
[27].  In  this  same  study,  children  with  NF1  rated  their 
own prosocial behaviors as similar to their peers’ self-rat-
ings.  Longitudinal  research  has  also  identified  a  relative 
strength  in  social  interest  and  social  functioning  in  CS 
[28, 29]. Children with CS have been described to dem-
onstrate  such  a  consistent  tendency  toward  friendliness 
and  sociability  that  this  personality  feature  is  thought 
to  be  characteristic  of  the  syndrome  [33–35].  Thus,  an 
observation  of  a  friendly,  helpful,  or  “prosocial”  attitude 
has been described in multiple RASopathies. These find-
ings  suggest  that  relatively  strong  prosocial  behaviors 
may be evident among children with RASopathies, even 
amid  those  who  otherwise  have  considerable  difficulty 
demonstrating  social  competence  within  interpersonal 
interactions.

Several  previous  studies  of  children  with  RASopa-
thies  or  iASD  have  evaluated  prosocial  behaviors  using 
the  Strengths  and  Difficulties  Questionnaire  (SDQ  [36, 
37]),  a  brief  measure  that  can  be  administered  to  vari-
ous  informants  (e.g.,  parents,  teachers,  self-report)  to 
screen  social-emotional  function.  In  general,  research 
involving  the  SDQ  has  reported  that  children  with  NF1 
are  rated  more  positively  with  respect  to  their  proso-
cial  behaviors  (behaviors  intended  to  benefit  others)  as 
compared  to  the  quality  of  their  peer  relationships  (lik-
ability,  friendships).  In  one  study,  46%  of  parents  who 
had  a  child  with  NF1  reported  abnormalities  on  a  scale 
assessing peer problems, whereas only 9% reported defi-
cits in prosocial behaviors [38]. Another study found that 
although  children  with  NF1  were  five  times  as  likely  as 
healthy peers to have significant peer problems, the dis-
tribution  of  prosocial  behavior  ratings  for  children  with 
NF1 across the normal, borderline, and abnormal ranges 
was very similar to the general population [39]. In terms 
of self-report among children with NF1, one study found 
that all affected children rated themselves as having nor-
mal prosocial behavior on the SDQ, while 14% reported 
abnormal  levels  of  peer  problems  [40].  Overall,  these 

findings  suggest  that  prosocial  deficits  are  reported  to 
a  lesser  degree  than  peer  relationship  problems  across 
raters.

The  fact  that  multiple  studies  suggest  relatively  pre-
served  prosocial  behavior  in  the  context  of  increased 
risk for social problems in RASopathies is curious given 
that RASopathies are associated with heightened risk of 
ASD,  a  disorder  characterized  by  prosocial  deficits  [41, 
42].  Children  with  even  mild  ASD  symptoms  are  more 
likely to demonstrate prosocial deficits on the SDQ, and 
prosocial  behavior  scores  can  be  used,  along  with  emo-
tional symptoms scores, to differentiate individuals with 
ASD  from  children  with  internalizing  and  externalizing 
disorders [43, 44]. Because the bulk of research measur-
ing  prosocial  behavior  in  NF1  has  relied  on  the  SDQ,  it 
is  unclear  to  what  extent  these  findings  are  dependent 
on  the  qualities  of  that  specific  rating  scale.  In  a  study 
of  adults  with  NF1  using  a  different  measure  of  social 
functioning  (Social  Performance  Survey  Schedule  [45]), 
Pride  et  al.  [46]  found  that  despite  normal  self-ratings 
from individuals with NF1 regarding their prosocial ten-
dencies,  parents  and  friends  observed  weaker  prosocial 
behaviors in these individuals.

Closely  related  to  prosocial  behavior  is  empathy.  Blair 
[47]  defines  empathy  as  “an  emotional  reaction  in  the 
observer  to  the  affective  state  of  another”  (p.669)  and 
suggests  that  empathy  can  be  divided  into  at  least  three 
types, including cognitive empathy (i.e., theory of mind), 
emotional/affective  empathy  (i.e.,  feeling  an  emotion 
someone  else  is  feeling),  and  motor  empathy  (i.e.,  mir-
roring  the  expressions  or  gestures  of  another  person). 
Though cognitive and affective empathy have been stud-
ied  in  RASopathies,  motor  empathy  has  not  yet  been 
examined.  Cognitive  empathy  has  consistently  been 
found to be predictive of most types of prosocial behav-
iors in children, regardless of the cognitive task used [48]. 
Whereas  prosocial  behavior  involves  helping,  sharing, 
cooperating,  and  comforting  actions,  cognitive  empathy 
involves  insight  into  other  individuals’  thoughts,  some-
times  described  as  “theory  of  mind”  [48].  As  compared 
to  the  broad  population  of  children  with  ASD,  research 
indicates  that  children  with  NF1 + ASD  have  a  stronger 
ability to comment on others’ emotions as well as insight 
into  social  situations  and  relationships  [49].  However, 
some studies have found deficits in measures of cognitive 
empathy  and  perspective-taking.  Payne  et  al.  [50]  found 
that children with NF1 performed similarly to unaffected 
children  when  determining  the  sequence  of  physical 
cause-and-effect  stories,  but  they  showed  comparative 
difficulty  determining  the  correct  sequence  for  stories 
that  required  theory  of  mind  skills.  In  another  study, 
adults with NF1 showed less empathy and had more dif-
ficulty  making  social  inferences  than  controls  [51].  In  a 

 Foy et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders            (2022) 14:5 

Page 4 of 16

study of adults with NS, Wingbermuhle et al. [9] reported 
that  performance  on  a  theory  of  mind  task  was  similar 
in  the  individuals  with  NS  as  compared  to  unaffected 
adults. Results regarding emotional recognition skills for 
individuals with NS have been mixed. Roelofs et al. [52] 
found  no  overall  difference  between  women  with  NS 
and controls in their ability to identify emotions in facial 
expressions  (other  than  that  women  with  NS  had  more 
difficulty  recognizing  anger),  whereas  other  studies  sug-
gest slightly lower emotional identification skills in adults 
with NS [9, 26]. Thus, findings regarding prosocial behav-
ior and empathy in RASopathies are mixed and warrant 
further investigation.

In  addition  to  measuring  these  more  specific  aspects 
of social behavior, consideration of whether similar neu-
ropsychological  factors  and  comorbidities  moderate  the 
expression  of  social  behaviors  in  RASopathies  as  com-
pared to iASD may be useful. This approach may clarify 
how dysregulation of RAS-MAPK signaling can contrib-
ute  to  development  of  ASD  among  some  affected  indi-
viduals, and to social challenges more broadly in a larger 
subset.  Investigations  aiming  to  identify  neuropsycho-
logical predictors of social problems in RASopathies have 
increased  in  recent  years,  although  most  studies  have 
focused on individuals with NF1. There is overwhelming 
evidence that attention problems and executive function-
ing deficits increase the risk of social problems and ASD 
symptoms  among  children  with  RASopathies  [6,  15,  38, 
53–58].  Aspects  of  communication,  including  structural 
and  pragmatic  language  deficits,  have  also  been  found 
to predict social deficits [15, 59]. A systematic review by 
Chisholm  et  al.  [53]  found  that  perceptual  and  higher-
level impairments in social cognition contribute to social 
outcomes in NF1, and there is initial evidence that emo-
tional  difficulties  (e.g.,  social  anxiety)  may  also  impact 
social competence in NF1 [60]. Examination of the extent 
to  which  some  of  these  key  neuropsychological  features 
vary across the RASopathies and iASD, and whether they 
are  differentially  associated  with  social  behavior,  may 
provide  insights  that  could  lead  to  more  effective  treat-
ment strategies in these populations.

To  test  the  hypotheses  that  social  behavior,  and  the 
neuropsychological  correlates  of  social  behavior,  dif-
fer  between  children  with  RASopathies  and  those  with 
iASD,  the  current  study  utilized  parent/caregiver  rating 
scales  to  focus  on  two  components  of  social  behavior: 
social  competence  and  prosocial  (empathetic)  behavior. 
Whereas social competence refers to the degree of effec-
tiveness  in  social  interactions,  prosocial  behavior  refers 
to  social  behaviors  that  are  meant  to  benefit  others  [61, 
62].  Due  to  limited  availability  of  measures  of  prosocial 
behavior,  we  broadened  this  outcome  to  include  empa-
thy, a construct closely linked to prosocial behavior [47, 

48].  The  measure  selected  to  assess  empathy,  the  Social 
Emotional  Assets  and  Resilience  Scales  (SEARS  [63];), 
included questions capturing both cognitive and affective 
empathy. The first goal of the current study was to assess 
social competence and empathy among school-aged chil-
dren  with  RASopathies  relative  to  iASD.  A  secondary 
goal  was  to  determine  whether  key  neuropsychological 
variables (i.e., hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symp-
toms,  and  communication  problems)  were  predictive  of 
social  competence  and  empathetic  behavior  for  individ-
uals  with  RASopathies  and  iASD  and  to  compare  these 
patterns  between  groups. The  final  goal  was  to  examine 
these  patterns  specifically  for  individuals  with  RASopa-
thy and a co-occurring ASD diagnosis (RAS+ASD) rela-
tive to those with iASD.

Methods
Participants

Study  participants  were  recruited  via  email/listservs 
(39%),  social  media  (34%),  conferences  (CFC  Inter-
national,  Costello  Syndrome  Family  Network  annual 
meeting;  16%),  clinic  appointments  (9%),  flyers  (2%),  or 
someone else in the community (1%). Parents/caregivers 
of  individuals  with  NF1,  NS,  CFCS,  CS,  and  ASD  were 
invited  to  participate. The  majority  of  respondents  were 
mothers  (93%),  followed  by  fathers  (7%),  grandmoth-
ers  (1%),  and  aunts  (< 1%).  Families  originated  from  the 
following  countries:  USA,  Canada,  Australia,  and  New 
Zealand.  Figure  1  contains  a  flow  chart  of  participants 
enrolled in the study. A total of 318 caregivers of children 
with  a  RASopathy  diagnosis  and/or  an  ASD  diagnosis 
completed at least one portion of the survey. Seven par-
ticipants in the ASD group were excluded from analysis 
due to having identified non-RASopathy genetic variants. 
The remaining sample included 311 children with RASo-
pathies  (n = 202)  or  iASD  (n = 109).  Children  ranged 
in  age  from  3.0  to  17.7 years  (mean  age  9.8 years;  SD 
4.1 years). The  diagnosis  of  a  RASopathy  was  confirmed 
by molecular testing in most cases (Table 1). The cohort 
included  179  boys  and  130  girls.  One  participant  in  the 
NF1 group and one participant in the iASD group identi-
fied as having non-binary gender.

After  initial  demographic,  medical,  and  developmen-
tal  background  data  were  collected,  surveys  regarding 
social behaviors were presented to caregivers of children 
who  had  the  ability  to  communicate  verbally.  Based  on 
responses to developmental questions in a brief adaptive 
measure [65], social behavior surveys were not adminis-
tered to caregivers of 25 children in the study who lacked 
functional  verbal  communication  or  language  compre-
hension,  as  the  measures  were  not  deemed  appropriate 
for children who are nonverbal. An additional 7 partici-
pants  stopped  the  surveys  before  completing  all  of  the

a  slightly  smaller  cohort  (n = 237)  completed  the  Social

Given these exclusions, children with RASopathies and/
or  ASD  included  in  the  social  behavior  analyses  had 
somewhat better communication skills and were slightly 
older than the cohort as a whole.

Study design

Families  interested  in  participating  were  provided  a 
secured,  private  link  to  the  study  questionnaires,  which 
were  administered  to  caregivers  electronically  through 
REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data  Capture  [66]).  The 
research protocol was approved by the University of Min-
nesota  Institutional  Review  Board  and  the  University  of 
Wisconsin-Madison  Institutional  Review  Board.  Survey 
responses  were  collected  between  July  2019  and  March 
2020.  Only  one  survey  (from  a  parent  of  a  child  with 
CFCS)  was  completed  after  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.

items. The remaining 277 participants with RASopathies 
(n = 180) or iASD (n = 97) completed the SDQ. Due to a 
more  restricted  normative  age  (i.e.,  children  ≥5 years), 

Parents provided information about the child’s age, gen-
der, medical history, and family demographics. This form 
also  collected  information  about  whether  any  of  the

following  psychiatric  diagnoses  had  been  assigned  in  a 
medical setting by a qualified health care provider (e.g., a 
physician or psychologist): ADHD, ASD, anxiety, depres-
sion, or intellectual disability.

Communication ability

Communication abilities were estimated using the Great 
Outcomes  for  Kids  Impacted  by  Severe  Developmental 
Disabilities  (GO4KIDDS)  Brief  Adaptive  scale,  a  short 
measure  of  adaptive  function  validated  for  individuals 
with  intellectual  disabilities  [65].  This  measure  has  high 
internal  consistency  as  well  as  strong  convergent  valid-
ity (r > 0.80) with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 
Second  Edition  and  the  Scales  of  Independent  Behav-
ior-Revised form [65, 67]. Items were rated on a 5-point 
scale, with higher scores indicating stronger communica-
tion abilities and lower scores indicating minimal ability 
to use or understand language. A composite score based 
on  the  receptive  and  expressive  communication  items 
estimated each child’s functional communication ability.

Social functioning

The  Social  Emotional  Assets  and  Resilience  Scales-  Par-
ent  (SEARS-P  [63])  measures  the  social-emotional 
competencies  and  assets  of  children  and  adolescents 
5–18 years  old.  Respondents  rated  children  with  regard 
to  various  social  skills  and  characteristics  on  a  4-point 
Likert scale (“never,” “sometimes,” “often,” “always”), with 
higher  scores  indicating  greater  competency.  Caregiv-
ers  were  administered  two  scales  that  measured  Social 
Competence  (i.e.,  “ability  to  create  and  maintain  peer 
friendships, ability use verbal communication effectively, 
comfort  in  group  situations  with  peers”;  10  items)  and 
Empathy  (i.e.,  “ability  to  relate  to  and  understand  the 
experiences  and  emotions  of  others”;  7  items).  SEARS 
scores  are  reported  in  T-scores  with  a  mean  of  50  and 
a  standard  deviation  of  10,  with  higher  scores  indicat-
ing  fewer  problems.  The  Empathy  and  Social  Compe-
tence  scales  have  demonstrated  both  strong  internal 
consistency  reliability  and  inter-rater  reliability  [63]. 
The  SEARS-P  has  shown  convergent  validity  with  other 
informant  rated  strengths-based  measures  of  social-
emotional competence, including the Social Skills Rating 
System (SSRS [68]) and the Home and Community Social 
Behavior Scales (HCSBS [63, 64]).

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; 36, 
37)  is  a  widely  used  behavioral  screening  questionnaire 
assessing concerns across five domains: Emotional Symp-
toms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity/Inattention, Peer 
Relationship Problems, and Prosocial Behavior. Items are 
rated on a three-point scale (“not true,” “somewhat true,” 
“certainly  true”)  to  indicate  severity  of  behavioral  chal-
lenges. The Prosocial Behavior scale reflects the ability to 

demonstrate  behaviors  intended  to  help  or  show  caring 
for  others  (e.g.,  “Kind  to  younger  children”).  This  scale 
was reverse-scored in our study to be consistent with the 
other 4 scales, so that higher scores would indicate more 
problems  and  concerns  consistent  with  a  lack  of  proso-
cial behavior. SDQ scores are reported in z-scores with a 
mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The five-factor 
structure has been confirmed, and the measure correlates 
highly  with  diagnostic  categories  and  other  measures 
of  internalizing  and  externalizing  behaviors  in  children 
[36,  69–71].  The  SDQ  has  strong  predictive  validity 
and  acceptable  levels  of  test-retest-reliability  (0.62  for 
4–6 months  [69,  71]).  Internal  consistency  reliability 
across different SDQ scores and informants is also satis-
factory (mean Cronbach 0.73 [71]). Table S1 (Additional 
file)  contains  more  detailed  descriptions  of  the  SEARS 
and SDQ scales.

Statistical methods

Descriptive  statistics  delineate  the  medical  complica-
tions  and  comorbidities  present  in  the  study  sample.  A 
few  data  points  were  missing  for  items  assessing  visual 
impairment  (n = 2)  and  hearing  impairment  (n = 2).  For 
the  analysis  of  social  behavior,  within-  and  between-
group  differences  in  scores  on  the  Social  Competence 
and  Empathy  scales  of  the  SEARS  were  evaluated  using 
within-subjects ANOVA. Standardized scores were used 
for  all  group  comparisons  except  the  GO4KIDDS  com-
munication  composite,  for  which  no  age-based  nor-
mative  scores  are  available.  For  all  measures,  clinically 
significant  deficits  were  defined  as  ≥2  SD  below  the 
normative  sample  mean.  Multiple  linear  regression  was 
performed to model the relationship between three pre-
specified predictor variables (SDQ Emotional Symptoms 
scale;  SDQ  Hyperactivity/Inattention  scale;  and  GO4K-
IDDS  Communication  composite  score)  and  the  two 
social  behavior  outcome  variables  (SEARS  Social  Com-
petence  and  Empathy  scales).  The  relationship  between 
the set of predictor variables and the two outcome vari-
ables was examined separately for the RASopathy group 
(comprised  of  children  with  NF1,  NS,  CFCS,  and  CS) 
and the iASD group, resulting in four separate regression 
models.  Statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  IBM 
SPSS Statistics 26 package.

Child characteristics and comorbidities

Data  regarding  medical  history  were  collected  using 
the background questionnaire completed by caregivers 
(Table  2).  In  terms  of  medical  complications,  children 
with  CFCS  were  by  far  the  most  likely  to  experience 
seizures,  whereas  tumors  were  most  frequent  in  chil-
dren with NF1. Vision impairment was common across

RASopathies, while hearing impairment was most com-
mon in NS and CFCS. Children with NS or CFCS were 
the  most  likely  to  report  other  medical  complications 
(e.g.,  heart  condition,  motor  impairment,  sleep  disor-
ders).  Preterm  birth  was  also  more  common  in  these 
two  syndromes.  Children  with  iASD  were  more  likely 
to  be  male,  consistent  with  the  gender  distribution  of 
ASD in the general population [20].

Psychiatric  comorbidities  were  common  among  chil-
dren  with  RASopathies  as  well  as  those  with  iASD 
(Table  3).  Based  on  prior  studies  estimating  prevalence 
of  psychopathology  among  children  with  RASopathies 
using  diagnostic  methods  or  questionnaires,  the  diag-
nosis  of  ADHD  was  less  common  than  expected  in  our 
cohort for children with NS, CFCS, and CS. Diagnosis of 
anxiety  was  slightly  higher  than  expected  for  NF1,  NS, 
and  CFCS.  The  comorbidities  reported  among  children

with iASD in this sample were within the expected range 
for  all  comorbidities,  with  approximately  half  having 
been diagnosed with ADHD and more than a third hav-
ing  anxiety.  Individuals  with  RASopathies  were  more 
likely  to  have  been  diagnosed  with  intellectual  disabil-
ity  than  individuals  with  iASD.  Within  RASopathies,  an 
intellectual disability diagnosis was much more frequent 
in CFCS and CS than in NS and NF1 (Table 2), consist-
ent  with  previous  literature  [11].  It  is  important  to  note 
that  these  numbers  may  underestimate  the  prevalence 
of  intellectual  disability  or  ADHD,  given  the  young  age 
of  some  of  the  participants  and  the  difficulty  that  some 
affected children have with participating in standardized 
cognitive testing. In terms of language abilities, caregiver 
ratings  of  receptive/expressive  communication  skills 
(GO4KIDDS  composite)  were  similar  or  slightly  weaker 
in the iASD group as compared to the RASopathy group 
(mean difference = 0.3, 95% CI − 0.1 to 0.6).

Social behavior analysis

Demographics of the subset of children with verbal com-
munication whose caregiver completed at least one social 
behavior survey and were included in the following anal-
ysis are available in supplemental Table S2.

Comparison across scales assessing social competence 
and empathy

For 149 children with RASopathies and 87 children with 
iASD who were in the 5–17-year-old age range, data were 
available  for  both  the  Social  Competence  and  Empa-
thy scales of the SEARS. Examination of between-group 

differences along the two SEARS scales indicated higher 
group  means  for  both  Social  Competence  and  Empathy 
for  children  with  RASopathies  as  compared  to  children 
with  iASD,  with  standard  deviations  indicating  some-
what larger variance in the RASopathy group (Table 4).

Within-subjects  ANOVA  was  used  to  compare  car-
egiver  ratings  across  the  two  SEARS  scales  (Social 
Competence  vs.  Empathy)  in  the  RASopathy  and  iASD 
groups. Results showed evidence of interaction between 
the  scales  and  the  diagnostic  group 
 (F1,  234 = 6.34; 
p = 0.01),  with  a  larger  discrepancy  between  the  Social 
Competence  and  Empathy  scales  in  the  RASopathy 
group as compared to the iASD group. For both groups, 
average ratings of Empathy were higher than Social Com-
petence.  However,  the  difference  favoring  Empathy  was 
more  than  twice  as  large  for  children  with  RASopathies 
(mean difference 5.7 points) than for children with iASD 
(mean difference 2.5 points). Further, 11% of children in 
the  RASopathy  group  had  above  average  (> 1  SD  above 
normative average) Empathy scores as compared with 3% 
in the iASD group.

In  terms  of  comparison  to  population  norms,  the 
median  score  for  Social  Competence  was  in  the  below 
average  range  for  children  with  RASopathies,  whereas 
the  median  score  for  the  Empathy  scale  was  within  the 
average  range.  When  separated  out  by  specific  RASo-
pathy  diagnoses,  the  observed  pattern  of  higher  Empa-
thy scores relative to Social Competence scores was seen 
consistently across all four RASopathies (Fig. 2). For the 
iASD  group,  median  scores  for  Social  Competence  and 
Empathy were both below average.

Fig. 2  Social Competence and Empathy scores for children with RASopathies and children with idiopathic ASD

Standardized  scores  for  the  SDQ  scales  were  com-
pared between the RASopathy and iASD groups, with a 
slightly larger (and younger) sample than for the SEARS 
(Table  4).  Similar  to  results  for  the  SEARS,  the  RASo-
pathy  group  had  notably  stronger  scores  on  both  of  the 
SDQ  social  behavior  scales  than  the  iASD  group.  The 
greatest  difference  between  the  RASopathy  and  iASD 
groups  was  on  the  Prosocial  Behavior  scale  (mean 
z-score  difference = − 0.96),  in  which  the  RASopathy 
group  scored  nearly  one  standard  deviation  higher  that 
the  iASD  group  relative  to  normative  samples.  Scores 
on the Peer Relationship Problems scale were also nota-
bly  higher  in  the  RASopathy  group  (mean  z-score  dif-
ference = − 0.88).  In  contrast,  the  severity  of  emotional 
challenges  in  the  RASopathy  group  was  similar  to  the 
iASD  group.  Scores  on  the  Emotional  Symptoms  scale 
did not differ meaningfully between these groups (mean 
z-score  difference = − 0.09),  although  it  is  important  to 
note that this scale also showed the greatest variance for 
both groups. Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity/Inat-
tention  were  mildly  less  problematic  for  the  RASopathy 
group than for the iASD group.

Examination  of  the  social  behavior  scales  when  sepa-
rated  out  into  the  four  individual  RASopathy  groups 
(Tables  S3-S4)  revealed  that  in  all  RASopathies  but  CS, 
children  were  more  likely  to  have  clinical  deficits  in  the 
Social Competence domain than in the Empathy domain. 
This pattern was also true for the iASD group. However, 
the proportional difference among these two scores was 
somewhat  larger  for  RASopathies.  Children  with  NF1 

and NS showed the largest mean differences in T-scores 
between  the  Social  Competence  and  Empathy  scales 
(mean  differences:  5.9  and  6.1  points  for  each  group, 
respectively)  relative  to  children  with  CFCS  and  CS 
(mean differences: 5.3 and 3.9). For all RASopathies, the 
difference between mean Social Competence and Empa-
thy ratings were larger than for the iASD group. No chil-
dren with CS were rated as having clinical impairment on 
either the Social Competence or Empathy scales, though 
this  sample  was  the  smallest.  Children  with  iASD  were 
much more likely than any RASopathy group to have def-
icits on the SEARS scales.

Predictors of social behavior

Multiple  linear  regression  models  examined  predictors 
of the two components of social behavior as measured by 
the SEARS (Table 5). For the RASopathy group, the three 
predictors  (SDQ  Hyperactivity/Inattention,  SDQ  Emo-
tional  Symptoms,  GO4KIDDS  Communication  Com-
posite)  accounted  for  similar  proportions  of  variance  in 
each of the two social behavior outcomes scales. Specifi-
cally, the predictors accounted for 24% (R2 = .237) of vari-
ance in Social Competence scores and 23% (R2 = .231) of 
variance in Empathy scores. In the iASD group, the three 
predictors  accounted  for  11%  (R2 = .114)  of  variance  in 
Social  Competence  scores  and  28%  (R2 = .283)  of  vari-
ance in Empathy scores.

In  terms  of  predictors  of  Social  Competence,  children 
who had stronger communication abilities tended to have 
higher  Social  Competence  scores  across  the  diagnostic

groups (Table 5). Greater presence of Hyperactivity/Inat-
tention  symptoms  was  also  predictive  of  lower  Social 
Competence  for  the  RASopathy  and  iASD  groups, 
though  this  effect  was  larger  in  the  RASopathy  group. 
The  impact  of  Emotional  Symptoms  scores  contrasted 
markedly  between  groups,  with  little  overlap  in  confi-
dence intervals. Children with RASopathies with greater 
Emotional  Symptoms  had  worse  Social  Competence 
scores, whereas this relationship was not evident for the 
iASD group.

Across the RASopathies and iASD groups, similar pre-
dictors were associated with empathetic behaviors. Com-
munication ability accounted for the greatest amount of 
variance  in  the  Empathy  scale  for  both  the  RASopathy 
and  iASD  groups,  such  that  children  with  better  ver-
bal  abilities  showed  higher  Empathy  scores.  This  effect 
was  slightly  stronger  for  the  RASopathy  group  than  for 
the iASD group. Symptoms of Hyperactivity/Inattention 
were also associated with poorer Empathy scores in both 
groups. Curiously, greater anxiety/mood disturbance was 
associated with stronger Empathy for the iASD group.

Impact of ASD diagnosis on social behavior in RASopathies

In  our  cohort,  22  (14%)  of  children  with  RASopathy 
had  received  a  diagnosis  of  ASD  (RAS+ASD)  from  a 
healthcare professional. To determine whether trends in 
Social  Competence  and  Empathy  differed  among  par-
ticipants with RAS+ASD versus those with iASD, scores 
on  the  SDQ  and  SEARS  scales  were  compared  between 
these  groups  (Table  S5).  While  verbal  participants  with 
RAS+ASD  had  a  similar  risk  of  severe  deficits  in  social 
competence  relative  to  those  with  iASD  (45%  vs  48%), 
they  were  less  likely  to  have  severe  deficits  in  Empathy 
(25% vs 40%). Of the SDQ scales, the greatest difference 
between  groups  was  seen  in  Emotional  Symptoms;  ver-
bal  children  with  RAS+ASD  were  more  likely  to  have 

clinical  impairment  on  this  scale  than  those  with  iASD 
(41% vs 29%).

Discussion
In this investigation, we sought to examine the potential 
overlap  between  comorbidities,  social  behavioral  pat-
terns,  and  predictors  of  social  behavior  in  children  with 
RASopathies as compared to children with a behaviorally 
defined diagnosis of ASD (i.e., idiopathic ASD or ‘iASD’). 
In  terms  of  the  rate  of  comorbidities  between  RASo-
pathies  and  iASD,  our  sample  as  a  whole  was  generally 
consistent  with  estimates  from  the  literature,  although 
somewhat fewer children with CS than expected had an 
ASD diagnosis [6, 7]. As far as comorbidity with ADHD, 
fewer  children  with  NS,  CFCS,  or  CS  had  been  diag-
nosed  with  ADHD  than  expected  [10,  14,  75].  A  poten-
tial explanation for this finding is that clinicians may view 
attentional  concerns  as  secondary  to  the  more  global 
developmental  delays  or  intellectual  disability  that  can 
sometimes  occur  in  these  groups,  and  therefore  con-
clude  that  an  additional  ADHD  diagnosis  is  not  war-
ranted.  Other  possibilities  are  that  the  symptom  rating 
scales  often  used  in  research  studies  may  overestimate 
the true prevalence of clinical ADHD, or that the young 
age of many children in the study may have precluded a 
diagnosis  of  ADHD,  as  some  clinicians  do  not  consider 
this  diagnosis  to  be  appropriate  prior  to  age  6  (23%  of 
our study participants were < 6 years old). When looking 
at emotional concerns, more children with NS and CFCS 
had been diagnosed with anxiety than anticipated based 
on the rate of symptoms reported in past studies [72, 77]. 
Surprisingly few studies have reported the rate of depres-
sion among children with RASopathies, rendering a com-
parison with expected prevalence rates more challenging.
Another  focus  of  the  current  study  was  to  examine 
patterns  of  strengths  and  weaknesses  within  the  social

domain. Our results provide evidence that despite over-
all deficits in social behavior, many or most children with 
RASopathies  exhibit  a  relative  strength  in  empathetic, 
helpful behaviors that demonstrate a desire to please oth-
ers.  The  difference  between  the  ability  to  manage  inter-
personal interactions effectively (i.e., social competence) 
and  the  ability  to  demonstrate  empathy  was  markedly 
greater  for  children  with  RASopathies  than  for  children 
with iASD. This finding of relatively strong empathy was 
also observed when comparing children with RASopathy 
who  had  a  co-occurring  ASD  (RAS+ASD)  diagnosis  to 
children with iASD.

Evidence  of  a  distinction  between  the  social  behav-
ior  patterns  observed  in  RAS+ASD  versus  iASD  is  evi-
dent in the literature on NF1; studies have reported that 
NF1 + ASD  may  be  characterized  by  fewer  stereotyped 
behaviors,  better  eye  contact,  and  stronger  language 
skills  than  iASD  [30,  49,  85–87].  In  the  present  study, 
stronger  language  skills  were  linked  to  improved  empa-
thy and social competence in both diagnostic groups, but 
the link between language and empathy was particularly 
strong  in  the  RASopathy  group.  Although  one  might 
hypothesize  that  stronger  language  skills  in  participants 
with  RAS+ASD  as  compared  to  those  with  iASD  in 
the  current  study  contributed  to  the  finding  of  stronger 
empathy  skills,  this  explanation  is  not  likely  given  that 
participants with RAS+ASD were rated as having poorer 
communication  skills  on  average  as  compared  to  par-
ticipants  with  iASD.  Another  contributing  factor  to  dif-
ferences  in  the  RAS+ASD  and  iASD  social  behavior 
profiles could be the attenuated male-to-female bias seen 
in  the  RAS+ASD  group.  Individuals  with  iASD  are  3–4 
times as likely to be male than female, whereas individu-
als  with  RASopathies  who  have  clinical  presentation  of 
ASD  symptoms  are  2–3  times  as  likely  to  be  male  than 
female [6, 20, 31, 86, 88]. In the current study, the male-
to-female ratio for participants with RAS+ASD was 2.13, 
whereas  the  male-to-female  ratio  for  participants  with 
iASD was 2.85. Taken together, these results suggest that 
differences in overall communication skills or gender dis-
tribution could contribute to the distinct social behavior 
profiles  identified  in  this  study  (i.e.,  stronger  empathy 
among  the  RAS+ASD  group  as  compared  to  the  iASD 
group), but may not fully explain the observed patterns.

Our  finding  of  relatively  strong  empathy  in  children 
with RASopathies stands in apparent contrast to a recent 
study  of  personality  characteristics  in  this  population 
[89].  In  that  study,  verbal  individuals  with  RASopathies 
were  rated  by  parents  as  having  lower  scores  on  traits 
involving  “agreeableness”  and  “conscientiousness”  as 
compared to sibling controls [89], suggesting that proso-
cial tendencies were less well-developed in those individ-
uals. Interestingly, an item analysis reported in the study 

revealed that children with RASopathies tended to have 
lower ratings on questions assessing what they were able 
to  easily  do,  or  quickly  understand  (e.g.,  “understands 
when  help  is  needed”)  as  compared  to  items  assess-
ing  their  openness,  kindness,  or  willingness  to  engage. 
These  findings  suggest  that  cognitive  or  communication 
challenges  could  cause  a  child  to  be  rated  as  less  empa-
thetic  or  agreeable  in  survey  results.  For  example,  cog-
nitive  impairments  may  cause  a  child  to  have  difficulty 
quickly  processing  or  remembering  information  dur-
ing  interactions,  and  communication  deficits  can  make 
it  more  difficult  for  a  child  to  understand  and  produce 
language  needed  to  demonstrate  empathy.  Indeed,  the 
ability to demonstrate helpfulness and show recognition 
of  the  needs  of  others  may  be  more  difficult  for  a  child 
who  is  less  mobile,  less  able  to  function  independently, 
and less able to communicate effectively. Consistent with 
this interpretation, our findings indicated that ratings of 
empathy and social competence were consistently associ-
ated  with  communication  skills  in  both  RASopathy  and 
iASD  groups.  This  conclusion  aligns  well  with  previous 
evidence supporting the notion that expressive language 
and  pragmatic  communication  problems  are  important 
predictors  of  social  deficits  in  RASopathies  [15,  59].  A 
relationship  between  communication  and  social  func-
tioning  has  also  been  previously  established  for  indi-
viduals with ASD, as early childhood language problems 
were found to be predictive of poorer social functioning 
among adults with ASD [90].

Aside  from  communication  skills,  our  study  investi-
gated  the  relationship  between  two  other  psychological 
characteristics as predictors of social behavior in RASo-
pathies  and  iASD:  hyperactivity/inattention  and  emo-
tional problems. Results indicated that greater symptoms 
of  hyperactivity  and  inattention  were  associated  with 
poorer social competence and empathy for both groups, 
although  there  was  a  slightly  stronger  relationship 
between  hyperactivity/inattention  symptoms  and  social 
competence  for  the  RASopathy  group.  Numerous  other 
studies  have  shown  that  ADHD  diagnosis  and  symp-
tomatology  are  associated  with  social  problems  among 
children  with  RASopathies  [38,  91],  and  a  recent  study 
by Geoffray et al. [31] suggests an even higher prevalence 
of  comorbid  ADHD  among  children  with  NF1,  NS,  and 
CFCS as compared to children with iASD. These results 
lend  support  to  the  suggestion  made  by  Chisholm  et  al. 
[53]  that  the  increased  risk  of  ASD  traits  in  RASopa-
thies may arise from a multifactorial basis inherent to the 
RASopathy  phenotype  as  opposed  to  ASD-specific  fac-
tors. The relatively high ADHD burden and the strengths 
in  empathy  we  observed  for  individuals  with  RASopa-
thies may represent distinct factors that lead to the social 
behavioral profiles of RASopathies versus iASD.

Although  ADHD  symptoms  may  not  be  as  tightly 
linked to social deficits in iASD as in RASopathies, these 
symptoms  have  been  linked  to  poorer  social  function-
ing for children with iASD as well. Previous research has 
found  that  social  communication  and  social  awareness, 
but  not  social  motivation,  tend  to  be  associated  with 
ADHD symptoms for children with iASD [92, 93]. Thus, 
ADHD symptoms appear to interfere with the display of 
social  behavior  quite  broadly  for  children  with  RASo-
pathy  and  iASD,  although  they  do  not  seem  to  have  an 
equivalent  impact  on  all  types  of  social  behaviors.  Inat-
tentive symptoms, for example, may cause particular dif-
ficulty with noticing and attending to the needs of others 
and consistently participating during social interactions. 
Hyperactive/impulsive  symptoms  in  turn  may  manifest 
as  a  higher  frequency  of  annoying,  aggressive,  or  dis-
ruptive  behaviors  that  can  affect  a  child’s  likeability  and 
acceptability among peers [94].

A  starker  contrast  between  the  RASopathy  and  iASD 
groups emerged for the effect of emotional symptoms on 
social behavior. For the RASopathy group, children with 
greater emotional challenges (anxiety, mood disturbance) 
displayed  poorer  social  competence.  Previous  research 
examining the role of anxiety in social problems for chil-
dren with a RASopathy diagnosis has yielded mixed find-
ings. While there is some evidence that social anxiety is 
associated  with  weaker  social  competence  for  children 
with NF1, other research has failed to find an association 
between increased overall anxiety and social competence 
for  children  with  NF1  or  NS  [15,  60].  The  relationship 
between  emotional  symptoms  (primarily  anxiety  symp-
toms) and social competence in our study was complex. 
Higher  levels  of  emotional  challenges  were  associated 
with weaker social competence for RASopathy and, sur-
prisingly, stronger empathetic behavior for iASD. In this 
regard,  we  speculate  that  a  higher  general  level  of  emo-
tional  expression  in  a  child  with  RASopathy  may  inter-
fere with forming social relationships; these internalizing 
symptoms may result in social withdrawal [10, 60, 78]. In 
contrast, higher emotional burden in ASD seems to facil-
itate  expression  of  thoughtful  or  caring  gestures  toward 
others (i.e., expression of empathy) in this sample. Inter-
estingly,  intervention  supporting  the  verbal  expression 
of  empathy  in  individuals  with  ASD  has  been  found  to 
improve general empathy and increase individual’s confi-
dence in their communication skills [95].

Implications for intervention

For  children  with  RASopathies  or  iASD  in  this  study, 
unique patterns of social strength and weakness emerged 
that were associated with somewhat divergent underlying 
neuropsychological  variables.  Interventions  intended  to 
support better social functioning for children with these 

disorders may therefore need to be designed to target the 
specific  neuropsychological  factors  that  contribute  to 
the social presentation demonstrated by any given child. 
Given the relative strength in empathetic behavior dem-
onstrated  by  children  with  RASopathies  in  this  study,  it 
will be important for caregivers, educators, and clinicians 
to reinforce this area of strength by continuing to recog-
nize, praise, support, and encourage the development of 
empathy  skills  for  these  children.  Empathetic  behavior 
is  a  significant  resiliency  factor  that  warrants  continued 
study  in  children  with  RASopathies.  Although  empathy 
is  a  complex,  multifaceted  construct,  the  expression  of 
empathy  is  undoubtedly  important  to  the  social  success 
of  children,  fostering  the  development  of  positive  peer 
relationships.  Further  research  examining  the  role  of 
empathy  in  development  for  children  with  RASopathies 
will be important for this reason.

In  terms  of  addressing  areas  of  challenge,  children 
with  iASD  and  those  with  RASopathies  who  have  ASD 
and/or more limited cognitive and language abilities will 
likely benefit most from intensive behavior interventions 
(e.g.,  applied  behavior  analysis  therapy)  with  particular 
emphasis  in  improving  functional  communication  and 
adaptive skills. For children with CFCS and CS, commu-
nication abilities were more closely related to ASD status 
than for children with NF1 and NS. As such, communi-
cation-focused  interventions  will  be  especially  impor-
tant  for  children  with  CFCS  and  CS  to  support  social 
functioning.  Children  with  CFCS  had  the  weakest  com-
munication  skills  and  social  competence  of  the  RASo-
pathy  groups.  Neurological  comorbidities,  including  a 
heightened  risk  for  seizures  (in  this  study  49%  for  CFC, 
10–14% for other RASopathies [96];), may in part explain 
this finding. These seizures, particularly infantile spasms 
and  treatment-resistant  epilepsy,  can  have  detrimental 
impacts  on  neuropsychological  function.  Children  with 
RAS+ASD were also more likely than children with iASD 
to have elevated levels of emotional symptoms, and they 
had  weaker  communication  skills  on  average  than  chil-
dren with RASopathy alone. Thus, addressing emotional 
symptoms  and  teaching  emotional  regulation  skills  may 
lead  to  improved  social  competence  for  children  with 
RAS+ASD. Children with NF1 and NS were more likely 
than children with CS and CFCS to have emotional dif-
ficulties, suggesting that they may benefit the most from 
this intervention approach.

For  a  substantial  subgroup  of  children  with  RASopa-
thies, treatment of ADHD symptoms should be a primary 
target  of  intervention  for  social  problems.  In  particular, 
intervention focusing on attentional and inhibitory con-
trol  has  been  shown  to  improve  children’s  social  com-
petence  [97,  98].  Further,  children  with  ADHD  in  the 
general  population  are  known  to  be  at  increased  risk  of 

Foy et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders            (2022) 14:5

problems  with  emotional  regulation.  Because  emotional 
symptoms  and  hyperactivity/inattention  problems  were 
both associated with reduced social competence for chil-
dren  with  RASopathy,  interventions  that  support  both 
emotional and behavioral regulation will be important for 
children with co-occurring RASopathy and ADHD diag-
noses.  Although  executive  functioning  was  not  specifi-
cally  measured  in  this  study,  interventions  with  a  focus 
on  teaching  self-regulation  skills  may  reduce  the  degree 
to which emotional problems and symptoms of hyperac-
tivity/inattention  impact  social  competence  for  children 
with RASopathies. This type of intervention is also likely 
to  benefit  children  with  iASD  and  RAS+ASD,  as  these 
children  are  at  increased  risk  of  ADHD  symptoms  and 
emotional  difficulties.  Finally,  children  with  RASopathy 
and  ADHD  may  benefit  from  medication  management 
for ADHD symptoms, as this intervention approach has 
shown positive impacts on social functioning for children 
with NF1 diagnosed with ADHD [91].

Another  potentially  important  target  of  intervention 
is  social  cognition.  Prior  literature  presents  substantial 
evidence  that  individuals  with  iASD  have  deficits  with 
regard to their empathic understanding and that instruc-
tion in the verbal expression of empathy can be an effec-
tive intervention for adults with iASD [42, 95]. Although 
children with RAS+ASD and iASD in this study were at 
similar risk of social competence problems, a much larger 
proportion  of  the  iASD  group  demonstrated  a  lack  of 
empathetic/prosocial  behavior.  Interventions  have  been 
successful in strengthening both lower- and higher-level 
social  cognitive  abilities  in  individuals  with  iASD  [99–
101]. Preliminary evidence also suggests that social cog-
nitive training can benefit adults with NS [102]. However, 
the  few  studies  that  have  examined  social  cognition  in 
individuals  with  RASopathies  have  yielded  mixed  find-
ings,  and  additional  research  is  needed  to  understand 
whether  these  types  of  interventions  would  be  effective 
for  children  or  adolescents  with  RASopathies  [50,  56, 
103].

Since the various influences on social behavior appear 
to  be  multifactorial,  and  RASopathies  and  iASD  are 
highly  heterogeneous  disorders  that  result  in  a  wide 
array  of  presentations,  behavioral  treatments  that  sup-
port  development  across  the  different  areas  of  risk  may 
hold  greater  promise  than  those  focusing  on  a  single 
domain in isolation. The Affective-Behavioral-Cognitive-
Dynamic  (ABCD)  model  of  development  proposed  by 
Greenberg and Kusché [104] emphasizes the importance 
of  the  developmental  integration  of  four  factors:  cogni-
tion, affect and emotional language, communication, and 
outward  behavior.  Furthermore,  Riggs  et  al.  [97]  found 
evidence  that  a  focus  on  integrating  executive  func-
tions,  verbal  processing,  and  emotional  awareness  can 

lead to stronger social-emotional functioning and proso-
cial  behavior.  The  current  findings  suggest  that  a  focus 
on  the  combination  of  communication  skills,  emotional 
language,  and  executive  functioning  (behavioral  and 
emotional  regulation)  may  be  an  effective  intervention 
approach  for  children  with  RASopathies  and  iASD  who 
struggle  with  social  competence.  This  finding  also  fits 
with  RASopathy-specific  models,  such  as  the  SOCIAL 
model originally developed by Beauchamp and Anderson 
[105]  and  adapted  by  Chisholm  et  al.  [53]  as  a  relevant 
model  for  NF1;  these  models  account  for  the  internal, 
external,  and  neurobiological  factors  that  influence  cog-
nitive functions and how those interconnected cognitive 
functions  (e.g.,  attention/executive  functions,  communi-
cation,  socio-emotional  factors)  contribute  to  the  social 
deficits observed in individuals with RASopathies.

Limitations

The  selection  of  study  measures  to  examine  detailed 
aspects  of  social  behavior,  and  particularly  empathetic 
and prosocial behavior, was limited by the small number 
of available measures with normative data. Multi-method 
and  multi-informant  approaches  that  combine  parent- 
and  teacher-report  measures  with  direct  observation  of 
child behavior could provide additional valuable informa-
tion  regarding  social  behavior  across  settings,  although 
such methods are challenging to employ in investigations 
of  rare  populations.  Additional  factors  such  as  home  or 
school environment, family socioeconomic status, family 
characteristics (e.g., parent diagnosis of RASopathy), and 
use  of  medication  or  behavioral  treatment  approaches 
may  also  have  influenced  social  behavior  ratings  but 
were not measured in this study. Differences in the rela-
tive  reliance  on  particular  recruitment  sources  (confer-
ences versus online research networks) may also have led 
to  demographic  differences  among  the  RASopathy  and 
iASD  groups.  Finally,  use  of  electronic  survey  method-
ology,  while  helpful  to  facilitate  recruitment  of  a  larger 
cohort,  precluded  the  observation  of  parents/caregivers 
during survey completion and the ability to provide clari-
fication regarding any questions that arose.

Conclusions
While  social  function  is  a  well-established  area  of  con-
cern  for  many  children  with  RASopathies,  this  study 
provides  evidence  that  a  relative  strength  in  empathetic 
behavior  is  frequently  observed,  thus  differentiating  the 
social  functioning  problems  experienced  by  these  chil-
dren from those experienced by children with iASD. Fur-
thermore, the patterns of psychological factors associated 
with different areas of social strength and weakness dif-
fered among children with RASopathy and children with 
iASD.  For  children  with  RASopathies,  problems  with 

 Foy et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders            (2022) 14:5

social competence were primarily associated with hyper-
activity/inattention  and  emotional  difficulties,  while 
problems  with  empathy  were  most  related  to  commu-
nication  challenges  and  hyperactivity/inattention.  This 
pattern  contrasted  to  social  behavior  problems  for  chil-
dren  with  iASD,  which  were  predominately  associated 
with communication problems. Thus, it is recommended 
that interventions for social difficulties target the specific 
social  difficulties  experienced  by  that  individual  as  well 
as  the  developmental  and  neuropsychological  factors 
underlying those difficulties.
