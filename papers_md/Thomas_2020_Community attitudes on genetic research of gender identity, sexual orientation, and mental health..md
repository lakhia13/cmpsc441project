Abstract

Sex is an important factor in mental health, and a non-binary view of how variation in sex
and gender influence mental health represents a new research frontier that may yield new
insights. The recent acceleration of research into sexual orientation, gender identity, and
mental health has generally been conducted without sufficient understanding of the opinions
of sexual and gender minorities (SGM) toward this research. We surveyed 768 individuals,
with an enrichment of LGBTQ+ stakeholders, for their opinions regarding genetic research
of SGM and mental health. We found that the key predictors of attitudes toward genetic
research specifically on SGM are 1) general attitudes toward genetic and mental health
research 2) tolerance of SGM and associated behaviors and 3) age of the participant. Non-
heterosexual stakeholder status was significantly associated with increased willingness to
participate in genetic research if a biological basis for gender identity were discovered. We
also found that heterosexual, cisgender participants with a low tolerance for SGM indicated
their SGM views would be positively updated if science showed a biological basis for their
behaviors and identities. These findings represent an important first step in understanding
and engaging the LGBTQ+ stakeholder community in the context of genetic research.

Introduction

Biological sex (see Table 1 for definitions) interacts with other risk factors in ways that are
often strongly predictive of health outcomes. From immune response [1] to heart disease [2]
and depression [3], sex is a key variable that contextualizes risk factors [4] and can yield biolog-
ical insights into disease mechanisms. What is less understood is whether a continuous (rather
than binary) view of sex and gender can deliver additional explanatory power in studies of
human health and disease. Involving sexual and gender minorities (SGM, or more commonly
referred to as the LGBTQ+ community—lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) can
provide an important view of gender and sexuality that is not restricted to a strictly binary

perspective when considering sex differences in human health. Of particular interest are neu-
ropsychiatric conditions that have strong sex biases and have shown evidence of enrichment
for non-heterosexuality and gender variance. For instance, autism is highly male-biased (4:1)
[5] and is also enriched for gender dysphoria [6, 7], while anorexia nervosa is highly female-
biased (8:1) [8] but is enriched for gay and bisexual men [9]. More generally, there has been
extensive study into the higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions in the LGBTQ+ com-
munity [10]. While it is possible that the increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions
in the LGBTQ+ community are due primarily to sociocultural factors like prejudice, stigma,
discrimination, and rejection [11], few studies have investigated potential biological factors
underlying these connections, especially working with the understanding that sex and gender
are more complex, continuous factors.

In August 2019, the first large-scale study of same-sex sexual behavior appeared in Science
[12]. As the tools for genomic research have become more accessible, fields beyond medicine,
including social science, are increasingly appealing to genetic data in the search for explana-
tory factors of human behavior and identities. This trend reflects an entry into the “genomics
to society” phase of a tripartite goal laid out in 2003 by the National Human Genome Research
Institute [13]. With this transition comes an urgent need to understand the perspectives and
concerns of both the general public and the groups being studied. This is particularly true in
the case of sexual orientation [14], gender identity, and their potential connections to aspects
of mental health, which have received increasing attention from genetic researchers in recent
years [15–17]. While genetics cannot fully explain these sensitive and often stigmatized [18]
aspects of individual identity, a greater understanding of the genetic and biological contribu-
tions to these phenomena may reduce public stigma while also advancing scientific under-
standing of the complex relationships between sex, gender, and risk for neuropsychiatric

conditions. This dual potential can only be achieved through partnership between scientists
and the LGBTQ+ stakeholder community. Therefore, the objective of this exploratory study
was twofold: first, to obtain a systematic, data-driven assessment of attitudes related to genetic
research of sexuality and gender identities, and secondly to give a voice in the scientific litera-
ture to stakeholder groups and use their opinions to help inform the research that affects
them. Our working hypothesis was LGBTQ+ stakeholders (as defined by those who reported a
non-cisgender identity or non-heterosexual orientation) would be less likely to positively
endorse genetic research into sexual orientation and gender identity.

Materials and methods

This study was approved the University of Iowa’s Institutional Review Board (IRB #201611784).
The survey was built on the Qualtrics platform.

Participants

Participants were primarily recruited through mass email to the University of Iowa, as well as
through social media. Participants had to be 18 years or older to be eligible for participation in
the study. Participant demographics are presented in Table 2. The main terms used for the
demographic descriptions for sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity are provided in
Table 1.

Procedures

After participants indicated interest and consented to the survey, they were able to complete
the Qualtrics survey. The complete survey is available in S1 File.

Measures

Online survey. The survey was designed to capture the participant’s knowledge and views

on genetic research broadly, as well as genetic research into mental health, neuropsychiatric
conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity. We also asked questions regarding the par-
ticipant’s opinions on non-heterosexuality and non-cisgender identities. Opinion data was col-
lected on a 5-point Likert scale. Considering our main goal was to understand the opinions of
people in specific communities, we collected in-depth data regarding their own sexual orienta-
tion, gender expression, and gender identity. In addition, we collected basic demographic
information. Demographic data for sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, race, and eth-
nicity were collected with the participant able to select multiple values to describe themselves.
A demographic summary is displayed in Table 2. Survey participants were also asked to
arrange continuously-adjustable sliders (representing femininity, masculinity, and “other”,
which they could name themselves in a free text box) in a way that best described their gender
identity. At the end of the survey, participants were asked open-ended, free text questions in
which they were able to detail their opinions and concerns, and were given the option to pro-
vide contact information to be contacted about future research opportunities.

Gender space and continuous-valued gender variance.

In addition to providing categor-
ical descriptors of gender identity that participants could choose to endorse, we provided three
continuously-adjustable sliders (0-1 for each of femininity, masculinity, and “other”, which
participants could re-name if they wished), and asked participants to arrange the sliders in a
way they felt was most consistent with their gender identity. The values from these sliders
comprise a three-dimensional gender space, where each participant can be described by a

three categories.

Table 3. Participants answered on a 5-point Likert scale to the following statements which were used to build a
non-heterosexuality and gender variance tolerance indicator by multiplying by the indicated score (+1 for higher
tolerance and -1 for lower tolerance).

Statements used to build tolerance indicator

Women should only be attracted to men.

It is okay that people dress in ways that don’t conform with their sex assigned at birth.

People are supposed to be male or female.

Men should only be attracted to women.

Some people do not experience sexual attraction at all.

triplet coordinate of [femininity, masculinity, other] (Fig 2). We calculated a scalar-valued
gender variance score by taking each participant’s gender coordinates compared to their
recorded sex (sex recorded at time of birth), and calculating the Euclidean distance to a gender
datum of [1, 0, 0] if the participant reported being a recorded female, and [0, 1, 0] if the partici-
pant reported being a recorded male. For this particular analysis, those who reported intersex
as their recorded sex (N = 2) were excluded.

Tolerance indicator.

In order to evaluate how overall tolerance of non-heterosexuality

and gender variance influenced opinions towards genetic research of sexual orientation
and gender identity, we developed a tolerance indicator. This was built using Likert scale
responses to the statements presented in Table 3. To facilitate a grouped analysis of tolerance
as it relates to other measures, we binned participants into three groups, which we labeled as
“intolerant” (bottom quartile), “moderately tolerant” (interquartile range) and “tolerant”
(top quartile).

Statistical analyses

Imputation of missing data. Tabular survey data was extracted from Qualtrics and ana-
lyzed in R. Surveys completed in less than two minutes or with excessive missing data were dis-
carded. Overall, 1.2% of the data was missing, and missing data was imputed using a nearest-
neighbors weighted mean approach as implemented in the rfImpute() function in the
randomForest package for R, using a response variable defined by all possible combina-
tions of recorded sex, gender identity (cisgender or non-cisgender), and sexual orientation
(heterosexual or non-heterosexual). This has the effect of imputing missing data with heavier
weights on individuals that share the same combinations of recorded sex and stakeholder sta-
tus as the subject of the imputation. A total of N = 768 responses were used in the subsequent
analyses.

Regression and false discovery rate correction. The imputed tabular survey data was
used to test the association of individual survey items, as well as a composite score (a linear
combination of all these items weighted by 1 if it represented an optimistic statement and -1 if
it represented a pessimistic statement) with the explanatory factors shown in Fig 1. General-
ized linear models using the glm function in R were used to carry out these tests in a multiple
linear regression framework, with quasi-Poisson regression family=“quasipoisson”
for Likert-scale items, binomial regression family=“binomial” for binary items, and lin-
ear regression family=“gaussian” for the composite score. The test statistics shown in
Fig 1 are those from models where each row was modeled as a function of all columns included
together. Correcting for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli proce-
dure [19] for false discovery rate (FDR), which is valid under arbitrary assumptions, including
correlated hypotheses. In addition, boxplots in Fig 1 show variance explained for each column
variable across each row survey item or composite score.

Power. A key question is whether our survey sample is sufficiently powered to detect
whether stakeholder status is a significant contributor to opinions on genetic research involv-
ing SGM. We used the pwr.r.test() function from the pwr package for R to calculate
power given the sample size and correlations, which yielded estimates of 0.8-0.98 assuming an

effect size (Pearson’s r for this test) of 0.1-0.14, suggested by the observed 1-2% variance
explained by non-cisgender identity (see boxplots in Fig 1).

Results

The sample characteristics of our participants are described in Table 2. We identified non-cis-
gender individuals as a participant who did not exclusively identify as cisgender and selected
at least one of the other gender identities. We identified non-heterosexual individuals by a par-
ticipant who did not exclusively identify as heterosexual and selected at least one of the other
sexual orientations. The sample shows a significant enrichment of the LGBTQ+ community:
11% (N = 85) vs. 0.5% nationally (P < 0.001, χ2 = 1653.2) reporting non-cisgender identity
and 35% (N = 270) vs. 4.1% nationally (P < 0.001, χ2 = 1812.9) reporting non-heterosexual ori-
entation. In addition, stakeholder status was significantly (P < 0.001, W = 54642, Wilcoxon
test) and positively associated with the volume of feedback in the free text fields (see Table 4
for representative examples).

Key drivers of attitudes toward genetic research on SGM

We found that attitudes toward genetic research specifically on SGM are most strongly pre-
dicted by broader attitudes toward mental health and genetic research in general (Fig 1). Par-
ticipants who expressed reservations about mental health or genetic research in general were
significantly more likely to express reservations or pessimism about genetic research on SGM.
Similarly, participants who endorsed the value of genetic or mental health research generally
were also more likely to view genetic research on SGM positively.

We used a combination of survey items (see Table 3) to build a composite non- heterosexu-
ality and gender variance tolerance score. This composite tolerance score was significantly and
positively associated with attitudes on genetic research involving SGM, meaning that those
who were more accepting of SGM and associated behaviors were more likely to view genetic
research involving SGM favorably. A notable exception to this pattern was observed on the
item that expressed concern that the public would misinterpret genetic findings involving
SGM, where tolerance was significantly (FDR < 0.05, Z = 4.8) associated with positive
endorsement of the concern (Fig 1). This item also showed significant associations with age
(FDR < 0.05, Z = -4.6), and objectively measured knowledge of genetics (FDR < 0.05,
Z = 4.1), suggesting that concern about public misinterpretation of the results of genetic
research on SGM is expressed most strongly among younger participants who are more toler-
ant and more conversant in genetic concepts.

To a lesser extent, stakeholder status related to non-cisgender identity (for the participant
themselves and/or for their romantic partner) trends toward concern about genetic research
involving SGM. None of these associations survived correction for multiple hypothesis test-
ing. Closer examination of these associations revealed that extreme heterogeneity of opinion
within stakeholder groups, rather than small effect sizes, is the key factor preventing stron-
ger associations of attitudes with stakeholder status. In any case, power analyses (see
Methods) suggest that our sample is sufficiently powered to detect stakeholder effects when
they exist.

Despite traces of concern about genetic research on SGM, both non-cisgender and non-het-

erosexual participants indicated that they would be more likely to participate in genetic
research involving SGM if science demonstrates a biological link for gender identity (only the
non-heterosexual association survives multiple testing correction at FDR < 0.05, Z = 4.0).

Genetic research on gender and sexual identity

Question

What would you like to learn from genetic research on
sexuality, gender variance, and mental health?

How can we be more sensitive and/or inclusive in our work?

If there were questions you did not feel comfortable
answering, can you help us to understand why?

Is there anything else that you would like us to know?

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235608.t004

Excerpt

Genetic research offers nothing of value other than a eugenics movement in regards to the LGBTQIA
community. As an intersex person, I’m well aware that they’re already trying to prevent people like me
from being born with medications and various tests administered in pregnancy.

Are the genetics of sexuality and gender variance directly correlated to the genetics of mental health? I
believe research shows a higher prevalence of mental health issues in people with sexuality/gender
variances but is that due to a gene that covaries with mental health and sexuality/gender issues or is it
due to not fitting in with societal norms, lower self esteem, lack of acceptance by many major
religions, and societal groups?

Any research into physical differences between people who label themselves with different sexuality
and gender identities would never take into full consideration all the environmental factors that have
influenced a person’s sexuality, gender identity, and how they choose to label and express their
identities.

I don’t have a specific thing I would like to learn, but moreover, I think it’s a very interesting topic. As
a transgender person, I would love to see genetic links or anything research has to offer. It’s just an
interesting topic. And the field has potential, so long as it’s not used to abuse people but merely doing
unbiased research.

I am interested in the possible connections between these things, but I worry that the public is not
ready. I think research in this area should be focused on ways to improve healthcare for gender non-
conforming people and not on confirming whether or not someone is a certain identity.

I’d like to know how many gene combinations can be involved in the manifestation of sexuality,
gender and mental health since these are all such nuanced topics with subtle variations. I wonder if
genes have a significant impact on determining these factors or not.

Most of the trans people I know- myself included- are somewhere on the autism spectrum. Is there
any genetic or other kind of link that would explain the seemingly higher rates of autistic trans people?

Be careful how the results are framed/presented. They could easily be reframed by opposing activists
to make it look like being LGBT (or not being cisgender) could leads to mental health problems.

A lot of genetic research ignores the complex interactions between genes, culture and development. As
a result there’s an inadvertent slip to deterministic interpretations that can provide some relief from
discrimination by encouraging more tolerance of GSM (they were born that way) but can also increase
intolerance and a search for “cures” or the legitimation of eugenic ideologies.

Just continue being aware that how people identify is a personal concept and just know that it can be
an emotional ground to tread

Be careful of racial/Western bias in your idea of gender and gender non-conformity.

Make sure that people understand that there are a variety of views on these topics based on how we
were grown and raised, and no matter the research, our views have been placed.

I really think that someone that identifies as a SGM or other controversial labels could best tell you
how to be more sensitive but it’s very important to listen to every aspect of what they have to say.

Be open to the idea that gender variance is a debatable idea and might be a social construct.

Please consider involving a gender-studies researcher (preferably a transgender one) in the entirety of
your research process, if you insist upon researching about genetics + gender + mental health. A social
scientist could provide very valuable insights, especially one whose field of expertise lies in historical
scientific malpractice. Additionally, please try to involve at least one transgender and at least one non-
straight person in your research process. A token person cannot speak for everyone, of course, and
will not catch every error. But having at least one member of the community which you are studying is
better than having none!

A lot of the issues have personal ties that I’m still reconciling to my Catholic faith

It made me very uncomfortable reading all of the gender ‘options’. . . Bisexual and trans is too much as
is, but there were way more listed.

I felt comfortable with all of the questions, but I was unsure/uninformed on many questions

Consult resources on inclusiveness within the populations you intend to target in order to better
achieve your research aims.

Stop giving imaginary genders/orientations legitimacy. Stop trying to force everyone to include their
pronouns, it’s insulting. It’s like if someone went up to you and asked if you are a man or woman. It’s
incredibly rude.

Although I am confident in my gender identity, if there were a “trans” gene and I was to discover I
don’t have it, it would make me worried I made a mistake. I have already worked very hard to be
comfortable with my identity, and I don’t think I need genetic proof to know who I am.

PLOS ONEGenetic research on gender and sexual identity

Finally, the age of the participant was a significant explanatory factor for attitudes on
genetic research involving SGM, with younger participants trending more pessimistic and
older participants trending more optimistic.

Gender variance and its relationship to tolerance and family history of
neuropsychiatric conditions

Our survey included a novel means for participants to describe their gender identity in a con-
tinuous fashion. This three-dimensional gender space (Fig 2a) allowed us to create a continu-
ous measure of gender variance (see Methods), which varied both by categorical gender
identity (Fig 2b) and categorical sexual orientation (Fig 2c). By calculating this continuous
measure of gender variance for cisgender participants as well as those with non-cisgender
identities, we were able to include the entirety of our sample in examining gender variance as
it relates to other variables measured (Fig 2d and 2e). In doing so, we found that participants
who endorsed either a family history of mental illness or neurodevelopmental disorders (Fig
2d) showed significantly greater gender variance than those who did not (P < 0.01, W =
40486, Wilcoxon test), in agreement with previous findings [20] [21]. In addition, we also
found that increasing tolerance toward SGM and associated behaviors was associated with
increasing levels of gender variance of the participant (Fig 2e, P < 0.001, β = 0.1, t = 6.9, linear
model).

The impact of science on the views of low-tolerance participants

Those who most strongly endorse science as a past contributor to their personal increased
acceptance of non-heterosexuals are among the most tolerant currently (Fig 2f). Specifically,
among those who “strongly agree” that science has made them more accepting, there is a
monotonically increasing trend of tolerance (P < 0.001, β = 0.7, Z = 5.1, binomial generalized
linear model). Among those who “somewhat agree”, those currently showing moderate toler-
ance are over-represented (P < 0.001, β = 0.7, Z = 3.9, binomial generalized linear model),
which may indicate a process of transition from low tolerance to high tolerance.

Those who are currently least tolerant of SGM endorse science as a potential avenue for
their own increased acceptance of gender non-conforming individuals (Fig 2g). These lower-
tolerance groups were significantly over-represented in the “strongly agree” group (P < 0.05,
β = -0.28, Z = -2.0, binomial generalized linear model), and in the “somewhat agree” group
(P < 0.001, beta = -0.5, Z = -4.5, binomial generalized linear model).

Direct statements from stakeholders

To supplement our objective, quantitative analysis of survey participant attitudes, we included
representative excerpts of stakeholder feedback from the open-text fields at the end of our sur-
vey. These statements, included in Table 4, provide important insight into the necessary con-
siderations when conducting genetic research involving SGM.

Discussion

This study provides the first systematic look at community attitudes toward genetic research
at the intersection of sexual orientation, gender identity, and mental health. Past genetic
research on sexual and gender minorities (SGM) has often proceeded in the absence of input
from stakeholders, and as the field accelerates, it is vital to devote time and effort to engage
stakeholders as partners rather than subjects. Our findings suggest that the key predictors of
attitudes toward genetic research specifically on SGM are 1) general attitudes toward genetic

Fig 2. Gender variance and tolerance. A three-dimensional gender identity space (a) was used to calculate a scalar-valued gender variance score,
which is the Euclidean distance from the expected reference gender identity (woman or man datum) based on the recorded sex of the participant.
Scalar gender variance corresponded in a largely expected way to categorical descriptors of gender identity (b), and sexual orientation (c). We found
that participants with a family history of either mental illness or neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) showed greater gender variance (d). Those who
indicated greater tolerance of SGM also showed greater gender variance (e). When reflecting on previous shifts in personal acceptance of non-
heterosexual orientations, participants with higher current levels of tolerance attributed some of that shift to science (f). When considering future
attitudes toward gender non-conformity, those who currently display the lowest levels of tolerance were significantly more likely to endorse science as
a potential avenue toward increased personal acceptance (g). Significance key: . = p < 0.1; � = p < 0.05; �� = p < 0.01; ��� = p < 0.001.

and mental health research 2) tolerance of SGM and associated behaviors and 3) age of the
participant. Importantly, non-cisgender stakeholder status showed a detectable, but ulti-
mately after FDR correction not statistically significant association with pessimism toward
genetic research on SGM. Despite these concerns, our findings provide evidence suggesting

PLOS ONEGenetic research on gender and sexual identity

that stakeholders are willing to engage with genetic researchers and that trust may be earned
through that engagement.

A central point of discussion is the increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions
within the LGBTQ+ community and how these stakeholders feel regarding genetic research at
this intersection. Our data showed that regardless of stakeholder status, the most prominent
predictors of attitudes toward SGM genetic research specifically are their general attitudes
towards genetic research and mental health research. Non-cisgender identity was to a lesser
extent a predictor of these attitudes, but non-heterosexual identity did not achieve significance.
Because there is evidence that stakeholder status influences how this line of research is viewed,
it is important to emphasize clearly that non-heterosexuality and gender variance are not neu-
ropsychiatric conditions, despite having been pathologized in the past. Homosexuality was
removed from the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual (DSM) in 1973 [22] and Gender Identity
Disorder [23] was removed in 2013 with the publication of DSM-V [24]. This most recent
DSM does include gender dysphoria, which is the diagnosis commonly required in order for
transgender individuals to have gender-affirming medical care. Our data showed an associa-
tion between reported family history of a mental illness or a neurodevelopmental disorder and
higher gender variance (this was including both cisgender and non-cisgender participants).
However, this finding does not necessarily endorse a genetic relationship between the two, and
a likely confounding variable is the degree of openness by the participant when asked these
sensitive questions.

Although stakeholders are the primary focal point of this study, it was vital to include cis-
gender and heterosexual participants, because many of the fears and concerns on the part of
stakeholders have to do with how the findings of genetic and other scientific research are
received by the broader public. Encouragingly, we found that scientific advancement was
reported as a potential pathway toward greater personal acceptance by participants who also
reported the lowest levels of current tolerance of SGM. In other words, although some stake-
holders reported fear of greater stigma and persecution in the face of genetic research on
SGM, those would-be persecutors reported that they would be more understanding of
SGM if science provided a biological basis for behaviors and identities they don’t currently
understand.

Language regarding sex

The use of the term “recorded sex” instead of “natal sex” or “assigned sex” primarily arose
from survey feedback and interactions with our community advisory council. These interac-
tions suggested valid objections to both “natal sex” and “assigned sex”. Recorded sex, with its
emphasis on the generation of a vital record, i.e., the birth certificate, is our attempt at harmo-
nizing past genetic and other biomedical research with the inclusive, sensitive language that is
appropriate for a modern and complex understanding of sex. Although assigned sex is becom-
ing more widely adopted in clinical practice, with the DSM-5 using the term in their language
regarding gender dysphoria [24], further research and consideration are needed to develop
language that is appropriate in a biological research context and that is not problematic from
the perspective of any gender identity.

Limitations of this study

This study is a first important step in the engagement of the SGM stakeholder community in
genetic research. Consequently, it is important to consider the limitations of our sample and
design, so that results are not over-interpreted. First, our sample skews young, white, recorded
female, and highly educated (when compared to national demographics). If this study were

PLOS ONEGenetic research on gender and sexual identity

replicated in other, more ethnically diverse locations in the U.S., it is possible that some con-
clusions would be influenced. There are sub-threshold trends in our data that suggest that
racial and ethnic minorities are more skeptical of research in general than the white majority
of our sample. Despite this limitation, our sample is likely representative of the “samples of
convenience” that are often the norm in current genetic research. Secondly, some of our work-
ing variables, including the tolerance indicator and the gender variance scale, should be seen
as derived composite variables that represent tendencies in attitudes over a collection of related
questions. These are not “scales”: they have not been normed and their psychometric proper-
ties have not been subjected to an in-depth investigation.

Recommendations for genetic researchers

After synthesizing the survey results, the open-text feedback, and interactions that have
resulted through re-contact of survey participants who volunteered for follow-up communica-
tion, a number of recommendations have emerged for scientists interested in pursuing
research in this area. A common concern was the connection between the eugenics movement,
medical research, and SGM. The eugenics movement rationalized abhorrent practices such as
forced sterilization, psychiatric institutionalization, and immigration restriction based on traits
or identities deemed undesirable by the movement [25], including the LGBTQ+ community.
Given the often intersecting history between psychiatry and the eugenics movement, it is
incumbent on researchers to plan, execute, and disseminate research in a way that ensures that
the basic human rights of SGM are preserved and history is not repeated. The following rec-
ommendations are given in the hope of helping researchers achieve this higher standard of
more responsible and considerate research.

First, we recommend that all genetic research projects involving SGM have a community
advisory council (CAC) composed of stakeholders representing a variety of gender identities
and sexual orientations. A CAC can provide input at the study design phase, giving important
insight into research questions that are meaningful from a stakeholder perspective. CAC mem-
bers can also give feedback during the manuscript preparation phase, so that a proper balance
is struck between scientific accuracy and considerate messaging.

Second, we recommend that a section of the lab or consortium website be produced, writ-

ten for a lay audience, that gets out in front of sensitive issues and that clearly answers ques-
tions regarding the research motivation and expected results. This website should link to peer-
reviewed literature that provides supporting information. The website should also provide
contact information for those wishing to express their feedback. Two example websites can be
found at http://gender.devgenes.org and https://geneticsexbehavior.info.

Third, publication of results should follow careful preparation of messaging, ideally in the
form of a press kit prepared in collaboration with journalists or public relations professionals.
One of the main findings of the current study was clear concern that the public would easily
misinterpret results of genetic research on SGM. It is therefore incumbent on researchers in
this area to not only prepare manuscripts for a scientific audience, but also clear and concise
takeaways for the broader public. This should not be left to chance.

Finally, diversity within a scientific team is a tremendous asset. Although there is nothing
that would prevent cisgender, heterosexual scientists from performing rigorous and sensitive
research in this area, the inclusion of team members who have a personal investment can pro-
vide invaluable perspective throughout the research process. It is not clear whether or how this
diversity should be signaled, both within scientific circles and to the general public. Such sig-
naling might provide increased credibility, but it also runs the risk of tokenizing individuals.
Representation of stakeholder groups among the scientific team should, however, not be

PLOS ONEGenetic research on gender and sexual identity

misinterpreted as a “blank check” to pursue research in this area without seeking broader,
more systematic stakeholder input. Our findings speak to the heterogeneity of perspectives
within these groups, and stakeholder scientists are unlikely to adequately capture all the rele-
vant considerations by themselves.

Conclusion

Our survey sample, highly enriched for LGBTQ+ community members, revealed that attitudes
toward genetic research involving SGM are driven by a variety of factors, primarily by general
attitudes toward research broadly, as well as tolerance of SGM. To a lesser extent, stakeholder
identities were also associated with attitudes toward this area of research, both in optimistic
and pessimistic ways. It is important to note that these attitudes were heterogeneous across
and within different stakeholder groups. Our data do not support monolithic, cohesive, homo-
geneous attitudes among stakeholders. Rather, our findings support sexual orientation and
gender identity as important but not uniquely decisive factors in how individuals feel about
research on one aspect of their identity. We hope these results are understood not as an
unequivocal endorsement of this line of research, but instead as a call for engagement and
partnership between experts and stakeholders in navigating this challenging frontier.
