Abstract
Social anxiety disorder is a condition characterised by a marked and persistent fear of being humiliated or scrutinised by 
others. Age-of-onset data point to adolescence as a developmentally sensitive period for the emergence of the condition, at 
a time when the peer group becomes increasingly important. Social anxiety in adolescence is associated with considerable 
impairment that persists through to adulthood. There are clear potential benefits to delivering effective interventions during 
adolescence. However, there is limited evidence on the specific efficacy of available therapies. This is in contrast to adults, 
for whom we have interventions with very specific treatment effects. One such treatment is individual cognitive therapy. 
Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model of social anxiety proposed by Clark and Wells (in: Heimberg, Leibowitz, 
Hope, Scheiber (eds) Social phobia: diagnosis, assessment and treatment, The Guilford Press, New York, 1995). The present 
review examines the potential application of this adult cognitive model to the understanding of adolescent social anxiety 
and considers additional adolescent-specific factors that need to be accommodated. It is suggested that a developmentally 
sensitive adoption of the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder (Clark and Wells 1995) for adolescents may lead to 
better treatment outcomes.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating condition 
characterised by a marked and persistent fear of being humil-
iated or scrutinised by others (World Health Organization 
1992; American Psychiatric Association 2013). Individu-
als fear a range of social interactions, such as conversations 
with strangers, joining in groups or speaking on the tele-
phone. Most things that involve being observed by others 
are difficult. These include walking into a room when other 
people are already seated, eating or drinking in public, and 
performing in front of an audience. Sufferers fear that they

will say or do something that they believe will be humiliat-
ing or embarrassing. Common concerns include the fear of 
sweating, shaking, blushing, stumbling over words, looking 
anxious, or appearing boring, stupid, or incompetent (Stein 
and Stein 2008).

Social anxiety disorder is the third most common mental 
health disorder after depression and substance abuse, with 
lifetime prevalence rates of around 12% (Kessler et al. 2005). 
It is common in young people. Prevalence rates of around 
10% have been reported by the end of adolescence in US 
and New Zealand samples (Burstein et al. 2011; Merikan-
gas et al. 2010; Feehan et al. 1994). Social anxiety disor-
der persists in the absence of treatment (Bruce et al. 2005; 
Reich et al. 1994a, b). For example, Bruce et al. (2005) 
reported findings of a US-based community study in which 
adults with various anxiety disorders were followed up for 
12 years. At the start of the study, individuals had suffered 
with social anxiety disorder for 19 years on average, and 
over the next 12 years only 37% recovered. This is compared 
with recovery rates of 58% for generalised anxiety disorder

and 82% for panic disorder without agoraphobia. Remark-
ably similar findings have been reported in adolescent sam-
ples. A 10-year prospective community study with over 3000 
German adolescents and young adults (aged 14–24 years) 
(Beesdo-Baum et al. 2012) found that 57% of those with 
social anxiety disorder at the start of the study were still 
reporting at least symptomatic social anxiety at follow-up 
and higher persistence of social anxiety was significantly 
predicted by an earlier age of onset of the disorder. Only 
15% were completely remitted.

Social anxiety disorder is associated with profound nega-
tive consequences and high levels of impairment even when 
compared to other psychiatric disorders (Alonso et al. 2004). 
Social anxiety disorder affects all areas of life. For adoles-
cents, academic attainment is curtailed, with individuals at 
risk of leaving school early and obtaining poorer qualifica-
tions (Van Ameringen et al. 2003). Amongst a sample of 
784 Finnish 13–17-year olds, those with clinical or subclini-
cal social anxiety disorder had a lower grade point average 
compared to those with no diagnosis (Ranta et al. 2009). 
Social relationships are inevitably particularly challenging 
for socially anxious adolescents. They report having fewer 
friends, and the peer and romantic relationships they do have 
are of poorer quality (La Greca and Harrison 2005; Hebert 
et al. 2013). They are more likely to be victims of bullying 
(Acquah et al. 2016; Ranta et al. 2009). Social anxiety makes 
day-to-day life difficult, for example, shopping and using the 
telephone can be a challenge. Research with adults demon-
strates that the impairments associated with social anxiety 
disorder persist into adulthood. Employment is affected: 
although the majority of adults with social anxiety disor-
der are employed, they take more days off and report lower 
productivity due to their symptoms (Stein and Kean 2000). 
In terms of close relationships, adults with social anxiety 
disorder are less likely to marry, more likely to divorce and 
less likely to have children (Wittchen et al. 1999a). A study 
amongst adults seeking treatment for social anxiety disor-
der found that the functional impairment was not due to the 
presence of comorbid mood or anxiety disorders (Aderka 
et al. 2012).

Adolescence and the Development of Social 
Anxiety Disorder

Social anxiety is very much a disorder with its origins in 
adolescence, with the majority of cases occurring during 
this period (90% occur by the age of 23 years; Kessler et al. 
(2005)). Prospective, longitudinal studies suggest that it is 
relatively unusual in early childhood (Wittchen et al. 1999b), 
with incidence increasing through the adolescent years and a 
median age of onset of 13 years (Kessler et al. 2005). After 
this peak period of onset, new cases are fairly rare after about 

the age of 25 years (Heimberg et al. 2000). The increased 
incidence of social anxiety disorder during adolescence is 
perhaps unsurprising. Adolescence is a time when people 
are moving from a unique reliance on their family unit and 
are learning how to interact with peers in a way that will set 
them up for the rest of their life. They become increasingly 
autonomous from their parents and reliant instead upon their 
peer group (Larson and Richards 1991).

Underpinning this social reorientation is the development 
of particular neurocognitive abilities (Kilford et al. 2016). 
One of these is self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is 
the directing of attention inwards, with both a private and 
public dimension (Davis and Franzoi 1999). Private self-
consciousness refers to an awareness of one’s inner thoughts 
and feelings, whilst public self-consciousness is an aware-
ness of the self as a social object. Self-consciousness, and 
particularly the public aspect of it, is thought to peak in early 
adolescence (Cicchetti and Cohen 2006; Rankin et al. 2004; 
Vartanian 2000). The development of public self-conscious-
ness will enhance adolescents’ sensitivity to how they are 
being perceived by others. This awareness will inform how 
adolescents behave towards other people and will help them 
to establish more mature and enduring relationships with 
their peers. However, it seems very plausible that an acute 
awareness of the self as a social object may also confer vul-
nerability for increased social anxiety and in line with this 
suggestion, public self-consciousness has been found to be 
related to social anxiety in adolescents (Mallet and Rodri-
guez-Tomé 1999) and in adults (Mor and Winquist 2002). 
Although all young people seem to experience a normative 
increase in public self-consciousness in early adolescence, 
only a small proportion will develop persistent social anxi-
ety, and so it is not in itself enough to explain the increased 
incidence. Rather, self-consciousness may be a necessary 
precursor implicated in the development and maintenance of 
social anxiety (Tillfors and Van Zalk 2015). It seems plau-
sible that the acute self-consciousness experienced during 
early adolescence renders this a developmentally sensitive 
period for the emergence of social anxiety (Haller et al. 
2015).

As well as heightened self-consciousness, adolescence is 
also normally a period of strong sensitivity to peer influence 
and it is a crucial phase of social learning. Social relationships 
during adolescence are especially rewarding during this time, 
and it has been suggested that this increases the impact of 
both positive and negative aspects of social interactions (Kil-
ford et al. 2016). In line with this, studies consistently dem-
onstrate that peer rejection leads to increased distress, anxi-
ety and lower mood in adolescents compared to children and 
adults (Platt et al. 2013). The heightened emotional salience 
of peer interactions means adolescents are primed to prioritise 
the development of social networks, but for some it will also 

1 3390 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

bring about an increased vulnerability for the emergence and 
maintenance of social fears (Eldreth et al. 2013).

In adulthood we pay attention to what others think, but 
there is a certain resistance to peer influence. In contrast 
during adolescence, this resistance is far weaker, with young 
people showing a strong susceptibility to peer influence. 
This can present as conformism to trends. A study examin-
ing the effects of peer influence on risk taking in adolescents 
and peers bears this suggestion out (Gardner and Steinberg 
2005). When playing a driving-based video game, youths 
took significantly more risks when with peers than when 
alone, whereas adult risk-taking behaviour was not affected 
by the presence of peers. Studies looking at resistance to 
peer influence are consistent with this finding. At the begin-
ning of adolescence, this resistance is low and only gradu-
ally increases to adult levels (Steinberg and Monahan 2007). 
Susceptibility to peer influence in adolescence is likely to be 
adaptive, as it will provide the opportunity to form strong 
social bonds and learn vital lessons about relationships. 
However, it is also like to represent a developmental sensi-
tivity for the emergence of social fears.

As this brief discussion highlights, adolescence ushers 
in a host of changes at various levels including in neural 
circuitry, information processing and the social environ-
ment (Blakemore 2008). For the majority of adolescents, 
one of the consequences of these changes is a short-lived 
increase in social fears (Weems and Costa 2005). But for a 
subset, perhaps those who are more behaviourally inhibited 
by temperament, it has been proposed that these cognitive, 
brain maturational and social changes confer vulnerability 
for the development and also the maintenance of social anxi-
ety disorder (Caouette and Guyer 2014). With this in mind, 
any theoretical accounts that aim to explain the persistence 
of social anxiety in adolescence need to be positioned within 
a developmental context. In other words, it is necessary to 
take into account developmental influences on maintenance 
processes that are relevant across the lifespan, as well as 
considering processes that may be unique to the adolescent 
period.

When considering treatment, it is clear that understanding 
and intervening in social anxiety disorder in adolescence is 
vital in order to avert long-term consequences. But in addi-
tion to this, the plasticity associated with adolescence may 
also offer a ‘window of opportunity’ in which to provide 
particularly potent interventions (Haller et al. 2015).

Current Treatments for Social Anxiety 
Disorder in Adolescents

Traditionally, cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) did not 
target specific anxiety disorders in young people. Instead, 
social, separation and generalised (or overanxious) anxiety 

disorder were all treated with the same set of techniques. 
Creswell et al. (2014) suggest this approach was motivated 
by  two  principal  factors.  Firstly,  the  high  comorbidity 
amongst the anxiety disorders in children and young people 
and secondly, the lack of well-validated disorder-specific 
maintenance models. The most well-known examples of the 
‘generic’ CBT approach are ‘Coping Cat’ for children (Ken-
dall and Hedtke 2006) and the ‘CAT Project’ for adolescents 
(Kendall et al. 2002). The treatments usually comprise 16 
sessions and involve a combination of psycho-education, 
anxiety management strategies and graded exposure. There 
have been many large randomized controlled trials under-
taken examining the effectiveness of Coping Cat and its vari-
ous relations in treating separation, social and generalised 
anxiety disorder (e.g. Ginsburg et al. (2011), Walkup et al. 
(2008)). Meta-analyses have shown that these treatments 
are associated with substantial effect sizes (Bennett et al. 
2013). However, a number of studies have shown that out-
comes from generic CBT are less good for young people 
with SAD compared to those with other anxiety disorders. 
Young people (mixed child and adolescent samples) with 
SAD are significantly less likely to lose their diagnosis of 
SAD after treatment compared with young people with other 
anxiety diagnoses (Crawley et al. 2008; Ginsburg et al. 2011; 
Hudson et al. 2015a, b; Lundkvist-Houndoumadi and Thas-
tum 2017; Kodal et al. 2018).

As well as traditional generic CBT, psychological thera-
pies designed specifically for social anxiety disorder have 
been  developed.  Cognitive  behavioural  group  therapy 
(CBGT; Albano et al. (1995)) was one of the first to be 
tested. This treatment, based on the Heimberg model (Rapee 
and Heimberg 1997), involves psycho-education and skills 
training (social skills and anxiety management strategies) 
followed by exposure tasks (Albano and DiBartolo 2007). 
In an early randomized controlled trial (RCT), CBGT was 
compared  to  no  treatment  amongst  female  adolescents 
(Hayward et al. 2000). The authors note that whilst those 
in the CBGT group showed significantly greater reductions 
in social anxiety symptoms compared to the no treatment 
group post-treatment, they continued to report considerable 
residual symptoms and at one-year follow-up the control 
group had also improved and there was no longer a signif-
icant group difference. Herbert et al. (2009) did not find 
evidence for specific treatment effects of CBGT in an RCT 
comparing the treatment to an educational supportive ther-
apy amongst adolescents, with both treatments associated 
with an improvement in social anxiety symptoms, function-
ing and social skills.

Social Effectiveness Therapy (SET; Turner et al. (1994)) 
and its parallel version for 8–12-year olds Social Effective-
ness Therapy for Children (SET-C; Beidel et al. (2000)) is 
another SAD specific treatment. It is a behavioural group 
treatment  comprising  psycho-education,  social  skills

training and exposure. Baer and Garland (2005) adapted the 
treatment for adolescents and compared it to waitlist in a 
pilot RCT with 12 adolescents. SET-C outperformed waitlist 
based on clinician- and self-report of symptoms. Olivares 
et al. (2002) compared SET-C and CBGT to a waitlist con-
trol using a quasi-experimental design (participants were 
allocated to group according to their school timetables; ran-
dom allocation was not used). Both active treatments yielded 
significantly better self- and clinician-rated improvements 
compared to waitlist with no differences between the two, 
and gains were maintained at 5-year follow-up (Garcia-
Lopez et al. 2006).

Masia-Warner  and  colleagues  (2001)  adapted  SET-C 
for an adolescent schools-based population, and they have 
tested the treatment, Skills for Academic Success (SASS) 
in two RCTs. Compared to waitlist control, SASS led to 
significantly greater improvements in social anxiety, func-
tioning and social skills based on self-report, parent-report 
and clinician-report (Masia-Warner et al. 2005). Examin-
ing specific treatment effects, the authors compared SASS 
with an attention control which involved psycho-education 
and supportive therapy (Masia-Warner et al. 2007). Find-
ings showed significantly greater improvement in clinician-
report and self-report but not parent-report of social anxiety 
after SASS compared to the comparison, suggesting prelimi-
nary evidence for treatment specificity. Whilst results from 
these two studies are very encouraging, because SASS was 
designed to be a low-intensity school-based intervention, 
the findings may not be directly relevant to the treatment of 
clinically referred adolescents.

Overall, the literature on specific CBT-based interven-
tions for social anxiety disorder in adolescents show that a 

number of interventions are effective compared to no treat-
ment; however, only one study has provided evidence for 
treatment specificity, in the sense of being superior to other 
credible interventions.

Improving Treatment Outcomes

In contrast to the limited evidence for treatment specificity 
in adolescents, substantial evidence for specific treatment 
effects has been observed in adults (Mayo-Wilson et al. 
2014), including CBT treatment based on the Heimberg 
model (Rapee and Heimberg 1997). The version of CBT 
for adults that has the most evidence for treatment speci-
ficity is a specialised form of individual cognitive therapy, 
developed to target the cognitive abnormalities and main-
tenance processes specified in the Clark and Wells (1995) 
model of social anxiety disorder. Whilst there is overlap 
between this model and other cognitive behavioural models 
of social anxiety (Wong and Rapee 2016) and the treatment 
has similarities to some other CBT approaches, many of the 
techniques are distinct. This can be seen in Table 1 which 
summarises what does and does not happen in cognitive 
therapy for social anxiety disorder.

Cognitive therapy based on the Clark and Wells (1995) 
has been compared to a number of other active treatments, 
and in the six randomized controlled trials that have been 
undertaken it has been shown to be superior to: Group CBT 
(Stangier et al. 2003; Mörtberg et al. 2007), exposure therapy 
(Clark et al. 2006), interpersonal psychotherapy (Stangier 
et al. 2011), psychodynamic psychotherapy (Leichsenring 
et al. 2013), fluoxetine (Clark et al. 2003), medication-based 

1 3392 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

treatment as usual (Mörtberg et al. 2007) and pill placebo 
(Clark et al. 2003). Therapy based on the Clark and Wells 
(1995) model is one of the two first-line treatments recom-
mended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence (NICE 2013), an independent body that synthesises 
available research evidence to develop treatment guidelines 
[the other recommended treatment being individual CBT 
based on the Heimberg model (1997)].

Such consistent and broad evidence for treatment spec-
ificity is unusual and suggests that it might be profitable 
to investigate whether the Clark and Wells’ (1995) model 
applies to adolescent social anxiety disorder as well as the 
adult condition. If the model does apply to adolescents, then 
a treatment that rather single-mindedly focuses on the main-
tenance factors specified in the model may be helpful for this 
population. Certainly, this type of approach, in which inter-
ventions are very tightly tied to known maintenance factors, 
has proved successful as a strategy for developing effective 
forms of CBT for a range of anxiety-related conditions in 
adults (Clark 2004).

Clark and Wells’ Cognitive Model of Social 
Anxiety in Adults

Socially anxious individuals will face many social situations 
every day, and the vast majority of these are benign, so why 
does social anxiety persist? A number of cognitive accounts 
have been put forward to try to explain this (Clark and Wells 
1995; Heimberg et al. 2010; Hofmann 2007; Rapee and 
Heimberg 1997). There is considerable overlap amongst 
these models, for example they all highlight the importance 
of fear of negative evaluation and of self-focused attention 
in maintaining social anxiety. A useful review of the promi-
nent cognitive behavioural models including a description 
of their commonalities and differences is provided by Wong 
and Rapee (2016).

According to the cognitive model developed by Clark and 
Wells (1995), people with social anxiety hold firm beliefs 
about the importance of making a good impression to oth-
ers, but they also believe they come across badly (Leary 
2001). Broad unconditional beliefs such as ‘I am weird’ 
lead them to make assumptions about themselves and their 
social environment. These usually involve high self-expec-
tations (“I must always look cool and calm”) and condi-
tional beliefs about their social behaviour (“If I look at all 
anxious people will think I am a gibbering wreck”) (Wong 
and Moulds 2011). These negative beliefs are activated in 
social settings and understandably trigger alarm (Hofmann 
2007). The sense of threat then motivates a chain of cog-
nitive, affective and behavioural responses. This chain of 
responses is self-perpetuating and closed off to new infor-
mation. Several inter-linked processes are emphasised in the 

model: a shift to an internal focus of attention and the use 
of internal information to infer how one appears to others 
(collectively described as ‘processing of the self as a social 
object’); safety behaviours; and worry and rumination that 
occur before and after the social event. These are described 
in more detail below, and the model is displayed in Fig. 1.

First, the model suggests that when individuals enter a 
social situation their attention will shift to a predominantly 
internal focus, in order to closely monitor how they are 
coming across. One of the reasons that this self-focused 
attention is problematic is because it reduces the opportu-
nity for the individual to process the social situation and 
other peoples’ reactions. As a result, individuals often fail 
to observe that other people are responding to them in a 
broadly benign manner. Another consequence of the shift 
to an internal focus of attention is an increased awareness 
of feared sensations.

Second, the model proposes that individuals use inter-
nally generated information to create an impression of how 
they appear to other people. The information drawn upon 
includes  feelings  of  anxiety  and  negative  self-imagery. 
Individuals will often overestimate how anxious they look, 
because they are assuming that they look as anxious as they 
feel (for example, ‘I feel hot therefore I must be really red 
in the face’). Negative images are common. Images usually 
come to mind from an observer perspective rather than a 
personal (or field) viewpoint, and so it is natural that the 
images are assumed to be an accurate representation of how 
the individual looks to other people.

Third, the use of safety behaviours, which are motivated 
by the desire to prevent or minimise the consequences of 
feared outcomes (such as sounding stupid or blushing), fur-
ther maintains social anxiety and negative social beliefs. 
Common safety behaviours in social anxiety include avoid-
ing eye contact, preparing topics of conversation in advance, 
wearing lots of make-up, and agreeing with others. Safety 
behaviours are unhelpful for a number of reasons. They pre-
vent the individual from discovering that the feared outcome 
was very unlikely to happen anyway. For example, ‘the only 
reason no-one spotted me blushing was because I was wear-
ing thick foundation’ (rather than because it was not par-
ticularly obvious to others anyway). Safety behaviours can 
heighten self-focus and monitoring, as an individual checks 
that the safety behaviours are ‘working’. Safety behaviours 
can directly cause feared symptoms. For example, cover-
ing your cheeks to prevent blushing can make you hotter 
and cause flushing. Safety behaviours can make one appear 
withdrawn and unfriendly. Behaviours such as avoiding eye 
contact or keeping conversations short can contaminate the 
social interaction and give the impression that one is not 
interested. Finally, safety behaviours can draw attention to 
feared behaviours. For example, speaking very quietly may

cause others to lean in and pay especially close attention in 
order to hear what is said.

Safety  behaviours  comprise  a  broad  range  of  overt 
behaviours and mental operations. Some safety behaviours 
involve avoidance, such as speaking less and avoiding eye 
contact, whilst others are concerned with making a good 
impression, for example checking you are coming across 
well and preparing topics in advance. Whilst it is sug-
gested that both groups of safety behaviours are unhelpful 
as they prevent disconfirmation of negative beliefs and 
increase anxiety, only avoidance behaviours contaminate 
the social situation by making the individual appear with-
drawn and unfriendly. Three studies have provided support 
for the distinction between avoidance and impression man-
agement safety behaviours. Plasencia et al. (2011) con-
ducted a factor analysis of data from the Social Behaviour 
Questionnaire which confirmed the existence of the two 
factors. In addition, correlational analyses indicated that 
both sets of safety behaviour appear to maintain social 
anxiety, but only the avoidance behaviours had a negative 
effect on other people. In an earlier study, Hirsch et al. 
(2004) examined correlations between subsets of items 
of the Social Behaviour Questionnaire and a question-
naire measuring the quality of a conversation as rated by 
the conversation partner. They found that items assessing 
avoidance behaviours were significantly correlated with 
negative ratings of the conversation, whilst items assessing 
impression management behaviours were not. Extending 
these correlational studies, a recent experimental study 
(Gray and Clark submitted) directly manipulated the use 

of safety behaviours during a conversation task. The pat-
tern of results was as expected, with use of both safety 
behaviour types increasing anxiety, but only avoidance 
behaviours resulting in a negative response from the con-
versation partner.

Further unhelpful processes include anticipatory worry 
and post-event processing. Before a social event, individuals 
with social anxiety will review what they think is going to 
happen in detail. Negative predictions will prevail and are 
associated with anxiety and a host of memories of past fail-
ures and negative self-images. This worry is often enough 
to stop someone entering a social situation in the first place. 
If they do manage to go, they will be cued up to interpret 
social failings. Despite some brief relief on leaving a social 
situation, socially anxious individuals often describe a con-
tinued cycle of negative thoughts and distress. Due to the 
inherently ambiguous nature of most social situations, it 
is rare that people receive an unquestionable seal of social 
approval.  This  ambiguity  will  usually  equate  to  doubt 
for the socially anxious individual and in turn initiates a 
‘post-mortem’. Post-mortems involve detailed revisiting of 
the previous event. However, because attention is trained 
internally during social events, and the focus is on negative 
thoughts, feelings and images, it is this that is reviewed in 
detail (especially the most distressing moments), rather than 
the objective facts of the event. As a result, the event will 
most likely be labelled a failure. Intense humiliation and 
shame commonly run alongside these ruminative thoughts. 
The post-mortem process can continue for days and some-
times weeks after an event.

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

We suggest that the cognitive model of Clark and Wells 
(1995) has the potential to be a good fit for an adolescent 
population. For example, self-focused attention is empha-
sised in this model and it is a construct that has clear paral-
lels with self-consciousness (Stein 2015) which is height-
ened during adolescence. Likewise, the concept of safety 
behaviours, which is emphasised in the model, may be per-
tinent to a teenage population. Avoidant safety behaviours 
may elicit particularly negative responses amongst adoles-
cent peers, who as a group are especially sensitive to per-
ceived peer rejection compared to children and adults (see 
Kilford et al. (2016) for a review). The rest of this review 
article is therefore concerned with two main questions. First, 
what evidence is there to support the application of the cog-
nitive model of Clark and Wells (1995) to adolescents? And 
second, what are the developmentally specific processes that 
need to be considered for the successful application of the 
model? We note that quite a few of the maintenance pro-
cesses that we discuss are highlighted in other prominent 
models,  particularly  the  model  of  Rapee  and  Heimberg 
(1997), but those models also emphasise some other pro-
cesses that are not included in this review.

A Review of Studies Examining 
the Applicability of the Cognitive Model 
to Adolescents

Methodology

We describe a review undertaken to assess the available 
evidence in relation to the cognitive model of Clark and 
Wells (1995) in adolescents. The studies we are interested 
in focus on the maintenance of social anxiety rather than 
the development or aetiology of the disorder. That is not to 
say that it is not valuable and important to understand the 
genesis of social anxiety disorder in young people. Rather, 
we are concerned here in delineating the mechanisms by 
which social anxiety is maintained in adolescents as a route 
to developing targeted and effective therapeutic interven-
tions. Studies including young people aged 11–18 years are 
included. This age range was selected for two reasons. First, 
we are interested in the adolescent period because this is a 
peak period of onset of SAD. Second, whilst a definition 
of adolescence as defined by years is arbitrary because the 
on- and off-set of puberty will vary from individual to indi-
vidual, we selected the upper and lower limits of 11 and 
18 years as these coincide with the start and end of second-
ary school in many countries. Studies with a lower age limit 
below 11 years were retained if the average age was at least 
12 years. We included data on non-clinical as well as clini-
cal populations. As noted by Stopa and Clark (2001), social 

anxiety is continuously distributed in the general population 
and so comparing (non-clinical) individuals at the relatively 
high and low ends of a measure of social anxiety seems 
a meaningful way of researching psychological processes 
implicated in social anxiety.

We searched the databases PsycINFO and WoK for peer-
reviewed articles written in English published between 1995, 
and the date the search was conducted (28 November 2017). 
The following search terms were used: (social* AND (anx-
iet* OR anxious* OR phobi*)) AND ((cognitive AND model) 
OR (wells AND clark) OR (cognit* OR assumption* OR 
(interpretat* AND bias) OR belief*) OR image* OR (safety 
AND behav*) OR (self AND focus* AND attention*) OR 
((event AND processing) OR worry OR worri* OR rumi-
nat*)) AND (teen* OR adolescen* OR young OR youth*). 
To be included studies had to include adolescent samples in 
which social anxiety symptoms had been assessed as well 
as at least one of the psychological variables specified in the 
cognitive model of Clark and Wells (1995). Review papers, 
studies evaluating measures and scales, and treatment stud-
ies were excluded. A PRISMA flowchart showing the selec-
tion of papers is presented in Fig. 2. Twenty-five studies are 
included in the final review (please see Table 2 for a full list 
of included studies). 

Effect sizes (ES) are provided. These are either reported 
directly from studies (where provided), or we have calcu-
lated these if they were not reported. For studies involving 
correlational analysis we have reported r and for group dif-
ferences studies we have reported Cohen’s d. r is interpreted 
according  to  Cohen’s  (1988)  criterion  whereby  a  small 
effect is at least 0.1, a medium effect is of a magnitude of 
at least 0.3, and an effect size greater than 0.5 is deemed 
large. Cohen’s d is interpreted as such: at least 0.2 is a small 
effect, at least 0.5 is a medium effect, and at least 0.8 is a 
large effect.

Negative Cognitions and Perceived Social Danger

Negative Social Attitudes and Cognitions

According to the cognitive model, individuals with social 
phobia hold dysfunctional assumptions about themselves 
that are activated in anticipation of a social situation (“I 
must always speak eloquently”). Negative social cogni-
tions about oneself (e.g. “I will stutter”) and about other 
peoples’ reactions (“people will think I’m stupid”) pre-
dominate.  Supportive  evidence  for  this  hypothesis  in 
adolescents is provided by three questionnaire studies. 
Schreiber et al. (2012) and Hodson et al. (2008) reported 
on studies undertaken with German (aged 14–20 years) 
and UK (aged 11–14 years) school samples respectively. 
In their large non-clinical sample of 581 adolescents and 
young  adults,  Schreiber  et  al.  (2012)  found  that  those

scoring in the upper quartile of the German version of 
a measure of social anxiety, the Social Phobia Anxiety 
Inventory (SPAI; Turner et al. (1989)) endorsed more fre-
quent negative social cognitions in social situations (e.g. 
‘I am boring’, ‘I will blush’) on the Social Cognitions 
Questionnaire (Clark 2003). In the only study to look at 
negative social attitudes, the authors also found that those 
scoring in the top quartile on the SPAI rated themselves 
more highly on negative social attitudes (e.g. ‘I must be 
witty and intelligent at all times’) on the Social Attitudes 
Questionnaire (Clark 2003) compared to those in the lower 
quartile. Effect sizes were large for both findings; d = 1.56 
and 1.74, respectively. In regression analyses, both social 
cognitions and social attitudes were significant independ-
ent predictors of social anxiety across the whole sample, 
but they were also predictors of depression. Similarly, 
the smaller UK study with 171 non-clinical adolescents 
(Hodson et al. 2008) found that those scoring in the top 
quartile on the Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory for Chil-
dren (SPAI-C; Beidel et al. (1995)) reported more fre-
quent negative social cognitions on the Social Cognitions 
Questionnaire compared to those in the middle quartiles 
(d = 1.20) and the lowest quartile (d = 1.40). The ‘middle’ 
and ‘low’ groups did not differ from each other (d = 0.39). 
Also in line with the findings of Schreiber and colleagues, 
regression analyses indicated that social cognitions were 
a significant independent predictor of both social anxiety 

and depression. In the third questionnaire study, Rudy 
et al. (2014) examined self-report questionnaire meas-
ures of negative social cognitions, self-efficacy and social 
anxiety in a US sample of 260 healthy adolescents aged 
8–16 years. Negative social cognitions (e.g. ‘I sound stu-
pid’) were associated with social anxiety both directly 
(r = 0.66) and indirectly via their effect on self-efficacy.

Using a semi-structured interview methodology, Ranta 
et al. (2014) asked adolescents to identify a time when they 
had felt very socially anxious and to then recall the thoughts 
that they had during the experience. Those scoring higher 
on the Social Phobia Inventory [SPIN; Connor et al. (2000)] 
recalled more negative thoughts than those scoring lower 
(d = 0.48). Although the numbers of young people with clini-
cal levels of SAD were small, the findings were similar when 
the authors compared those assigned a diagnosis of clinical 
or subclinical social anxiety disorder (n = 17) compared to 
those with no diagnosis of SAD (n = 116; d = 0.58). Negative 
thoughts recalled by all participants were most commonly 
self-focused rather than focused on other people or the inter-
action. In another study comparing a sample of adolescents 
with social anxiety disorder with a group of healthy con-
trols, Alfano et al. (2006) asked participants to engage in a 
role-play task. The authors found that not only did socially 
anxious youth make more negative predictions about their 
performance than controls (d = 1.61), but they also went on 
to believe they performed less well than they had expected,

whereas control participants did not draw negative conclu-
sions about their performance (d = 1.56). Negative self-talk 
was significantly more frequent in socially anxious ado-
lescents compared to controls (d = 0.69) and compared to 
socially anxious children (d = 0.67).

The studies described all report consistent findings that 
are supportive of the cognitive model. Negative social cog-
nitions and attitudes are elevated in adolescents endorsing 
more social anxiety. Two studies have suggested that this 
holds in clinical samples also. However, there are limitations 
to the data, most notably, all of the studies are correlational1 
and so the issue of whether cognitions are causally impli-
cated in social anxiety cannot be resolved.

Negative Interpretation Bias

Social  events  are  rarely  conclusively  negative,  and  yet 
socially anxious individuals will often draw very negative 
conclusions about their social performance and others’ reac-
tions. Considerable evidence has amassed in support of the 
presence of a bias amongst socially anxious adults towards 
interpreting ambiguous events in a negative way and apprais-
ing mildly negative events catastrophically (Mobini et al. 
2013). A study by Stopa and Clark (2000) provides particu-
larly clear evidence for this. Adults with social anxiety dis-
order and healthy controls were presented with ambiguous 
scenarios depicting social and non-social events, and with 
unambiguous scenarios depicting mildly negative social 
events. Socially anxious adults not only made more nega-
tive interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios, but they 
were also more likely to catastrophize unambiguous, mildly 
negative social events. In pre-adolescent children there are 
fewer studies, but a review concluded that there is reasonable

that measure co-variation either within or between groups but do not 
experimentally manipulate the variable.

evidence for the association of a negative interpretation bias 
with social anxiety (Halldorsson and Creswell 2017).

Turning now to adolescents, in their review, Haller et al. 
(2015) note that the refinement of neurocognitive abilities 
such as perspective-taking coupled with exposure to increas-
ingly large and complex social networks may make some 
adolescents especially susceptible to drawing negative social 
conclusions compared to children and adults. Studies exam-
ining interpretation bias in adolescent social anxiety have 
used a range of methods. Four studies, with Dutch (Miers 
et al. 2008), Italian (Giannini and Loscalzo 2016; Loscalzo 
et al. 2017) and US (Rheingold et al. 2003) samples, have 
employed a questionnaire measure of interpretation bias. In 
three of the studies (Miers et al. 2008; Giannini and Los-
calzo 2016; Loscalzo et al. 2017), participants were given 
the  Adolescent  Interpretation  and  Belief  Questionnaire 
(Miers et al. 2008). The questionnaire presents a series of 
ambiguous social and non-social scenarios followed by three 
possible interpretations (positive, negative and neutral). 
Respondents are asked to rate how likely the interpretations 
are to pop into mind and how much they believe them.

Miers et al. (2008) found that adolescents scoring high 
(in the top 10%) on a measure of social anxiety (the Social 
Anxiety Scale for Adolescents [SAS-A; La Greca and Lopez 
(1998)]) made significantly more negative interpretations of 
social events than the average anxiety group (those scoring 
in the 45–55th centile on the SAS-A; d = 1.18) and believed 
these more strongly (d = 0.54). There were no differences 
in positive interpretation of social events (d = 0.28). High 
social anxiety adolescents were also more likely to make 
negative interpretations (d = 0.62) of non-social situations 
and to believe these negative interpretations (d = 0.59) more 
than average anxiety adolescents. In line with these findings, 
Giannini and Loscalzo (2016) found non-clinical high scor-
ers (on the SPIN) endorsed more frequent negative inter-
pretations of social situations (d = 0.84) and believed these 
more than average scorers (d = 1.19). However, there were 
some differences between the two studies. First, in this study, 

1 3398 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

high anxiety adolescents also made fewer positive interpre-
tations (d = 0.70) than the average anxiety scorers (whereas 
no differences were found on this measure by Miers et al. 
(2008)). Second, this study did not find any differences in 
interpretation of non-social situations, whereas a difference 
had been identified in the study by Miers et al. (2008).

The study by Loscalzo et al. (2017) compared 50 adoles-
cents with a clinical diagnosis of social phobia with non-
clinical adolescents scoring high or low on the SPIN. This 
study also used the Adolescent Interpretation and Belief 
Questionnaire. In line with the findings of Miers et al. (2008) 
there were no group differences in positive interpretations 
of social situations, but the social anxiety disorder group 
and the high social anxiety group made more frequent nega-
tive interpretations of social situations than those in the low 
social anxiety group (d = 1.82; 1.82, respectively). Those 
in the social anxiety disorder group believed the negative 
interpretations more than those in the high (d = 0.56) and 
low (d = 0.75) social anxiety groups, who did not differ from 
each other (d = 0.14). In terms of content-specificity, ado-
lescents with social anxiety disorder also made more nega-
tive interpretations of non-social ambiguous scenarios and 
believed these more strongly than non-clinical adolescents 
with high or low social anxiety. Another correlational study 
was undertaken by Rheingold et al. (2003). Adolescents with 
a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and healthy controls 
completed a questionnaire measure assessing judgments 
of the likelihood and cost of social and non-social events. 
Socially anxious youth overestimated the cost (d = 1.87) 
and probability (d = 1.50) of negative social events and the 
cost of negative non-social events (d = 0.84) compared to 
controls, even after controlling for depression symptoms. 
However, none of these four studies assessed interpretations 
‘on-line’ and so we cannot determine whether they are meas-
uring direct interpretations of events as they occur or rather 
some pre-existing negative beliefs.

Addressing the limitations associated with this method, 
a recent study by Haller et al. (2016) used a novel picture-
based paradigm to measure interpretation bias amongst 95 
school-based  non-clinical  14–17-year  olds.  Participants 
were shown an ambiguous social scene with a photograph 
of themselves inserted as the protagonist. They were pre-
sented with neutral, negative and positive interpretations. 
Social anxiety was significantly negatively correlated with 
positive interpretation ratings (r = − 0.48) and significantly 
positively correlated with negative interpretation ratings 
(r = 0.45). Extending this finding, Haller et al. (2017) asked 
a community sample of adolescents to interpret ambiguous 
social situations presented with naturalistic photographs. 
Eye  tracking  data  were  gathered  as  a  proxy  measure  of 
attentional allocation. Social anxiety levels predicted a ten-
dency to make more negative and less positive interpreta-
tions. Furthermore, participants who spent more time on 

facial displays made more threatening interpretations. In a 
study measuring online interpretation biases in a sample of 
young adolescents with social anxiety disorder and a group 
of healthy controls (Pergamin-Hight et al. 2016) found that 
the clinical group made more negative interpretations com-
pared to the control group (d = 0.47).

Seven  studies  have  examined  interpretation  biases  in 
social anxiety in adolescents. All point to an association 
between social anxiety and an increased tendency to draw 
negative interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios and 
to believe these more strongly. Findings are more mixed 
about the association between social anxiety and positive 
interpretations of social scenarios, and in relation to the 
interpretation of non-social events. In addition, as yet, no 
studies have examined whether socially anxious individuals 
tend to catastrophize in response to mildly negative social 
scenarios as would be predicted by the model.

Processing of the Self as a Social Object

Enhanced Self‑Focused Attention Linked to Reduced 
Processing of External Social Cues

The model would predict that when a social threat is per-
ceived, socially anxious individuals shift their attention 
internally and reduce processing of external social cues. 
Indeed, socially anxious adolescents very often talk about 
being painfully self-conscious in social situations. To test 
this hypothesis, the questionnaire-based study of Hodson 
et al. (2008) included the Focus of Attention Questionnaire 
(FAQ; Woody (1996). High socially anxious adolescents 
reported higher levels of self-focus compared to middle 
(d = 0.49) and low socially anxious youth (d = 1.09). Self-
focused attention was associated with social anxiety across 
the whole sample (r = 0.42), and it was also an additional 
independent predictor of social anxiety, with and without 
simultaneous adjustment for depression scores. Consist-
ent with this finding, Schreiber et al. (2012) also found that 
high socially anxious adolescents reported higher levels of 
self-focused attention (measured by the FAQ) compared to 
low scorers (d = 1.15). Self-focused attention was not found 
to be a significant independent predictor of social anxiety 
across the whole sample. The authors also looked at external 
focus of attention, measured by certain items of the Focus 
of Attention Questionnaire. No differences between groups 
were found on this subscale. The authors suggested this 
null finding might have resulted from the lack of specificity 
regarding the type of external focus captured by the items.

A more ecologically valid study was undertaken by Blöte 
et al. (2014). One hundred and sixty-one non-clinical 14–18-
year olds gave a speech to a pre-recorded neutral audience. 
Questionnaire measures of social anxiety and self-focus 
(using the FAQ), performance expectation and audience 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414 

399

perception  were  completed.  In  relation  to  self-focused 
attention, it was found that as expected social anxiety was 
associated with higher self-focus (r = 0.43). The relationship 
between social anxiety and audience perception was found 
to be partially mediated by negative expectations of perfor-
mance and self-focused attention. In line with the findings 
of Schreiber et al. (2012), external focused attention was not 
correlated with social anxiety (r = 0.12).

A longitudinal study was undertaken with a sample of 
unselected  Dutch  youth  to  examine  pathways  of  social 
avoidance through adolescence and whether social anxiety 
and psychological processes, including self-focused atten-
tion (using the FAQ), discriminated between the pathways 
(Miers et al. 2014). A group of adolescents showed increas-
ing social avoidance through adolescence, and another group 
showed consistently low avoidance. Self-focused attention 
was not found to discriminate between the two groups. How-
ever, the study was designed to identify vulnerability factors 
for the development of social avoidance rather than current 
maintenance factors.

A number of studies have been reported on that have 
examined the role of self-focused attention in social anxi-
ety. In all but one study (Miers et al. 2014), self-focused 
attention was found to be related to social anxiety (or group 
differences were shown) with a medium effect. However, 
conclusions are limited by a number of issues. First, none 
of the studies were undertaken with clinical populations. 
Second, all of the studies used the FAQ to measure self-
focused attention and often only used a small number of 
items taken from the questionnaire. Although the measure 
has been found to have moderate internal consistency, full 
psychometrics have not been reported with adolescents. 
Third, the studies cannot illuminate us on the causal role of 
self-focused attention in social anxiety; for this, experimen-
tal studies are needed.

Negative Observer‑Perspective Social Images

The majority of adults with SAD report experiencing nega-
tive observer-perspective self-images in social situations 
(Hackmann et al. 2000). These are often related to events 
dating back to around the onset of the disorder. A number 
of studies have examined negative self-imagery and social 
anxiety in adolescents. Three of these used questionnaire 
or interview methods. Ranta et al. (2014) found that high 
socially  anxious  adolescents  (compared  to  low  scorers) 
and adolescents with SAD or subclinical SAD (compared 
to no diagnosis) report more negative observer-perspective 
self-images  (d = 0.45  and  r = 0.47,  respectively).  Simi-
larly, in their study with unselected adolescents, Schreiber 
et  al.  (2012)  found  that  high  social  anxiety  adolescents 
reported more frequent negative self-images than low scor-
ers (d = 0.81). Frequency of negative self-images was also 

found to independently predict social anxiety in the group 
as a whole. The study used the Questionnaire of Recurrent 
Images in Social Phobia (QRI-SP; Schreiber et al. (2009)) 
which is based on the semi-structured developed by Hack-
mann et al. (2000) for adults to assess negative self-imagery. 
However, the study only used a single item of the measure 
and this may not be reliable with a multi-faceted construct 
such as self-imagery. Addressing this limitation, Schreiber 
and Steil (2013) administered the full QRI-SP as a semi-
structured interview to 31 adolescents with a clinical diag-
nosis of SAD and to a matched sample of 31 healthy adoles-
cents. They found that whilst all adolescents had experienced 
negative self-imagery in social situations in the past, those 
with SAD experienced images more frequently (d = 0.84), 
and they were more distressing (d = 0.80) and more vivid 
(d = 0.54). These images were more likely to be experienced 
from the observer perspective by those with SAD compared 
to controls (d = 0.75). Almost half of controls (45.2%) and 
two-thirds of the SAD group (64.5%) identified a socially 
traumatic event linked to the negative self-image, but this 
proportion did not differ between the groups. A study by 
Hignett and Cartwright-Hatton (2008) further examined the 
hypothesis that the negative images experienced by socially 
anxious individuals tend to be from the observer perspective. 
One hundred and twenty-four unselected adolescents aged 
12–18 years gave a brief talk to a camera. They were then 
asked to bring to mind how they thought they had appeared 
and rate the extent to which this image was from the field or 
observer perspective. A modest but significant association 
between social anxiety (SPAI-C) and tendency to take the 
observer perspective (r = 0.20) was found.

A convincing demonstration of the causal role of nega-
tive self-imagery in social anxiety in adults was provided 
by Hirsch et al. (2004) (see also Hirsch et al. (2003)). In 
their study, socially anxious adults took part in two con-
versations, holding either a negative or a benign image in 
mind. Findings were in line with the cognitive model: com-
pared to a benign image, holding a negative social image 
in mind increased anxiety, negative appraisals and use of 
safety behaviours and led to a poorer judgement by the con-
versation partner. Alfano et al. (2008) undertook a similar 
experimental study with 63 SAD and healthy control ado-
lescents. Adolescents undertook videotaped role-play and 
read aloud tasks. Afterwards, they rated their anxiety and 
their social performance and an independent assessor made 
objective ratings of their performance. Half the control par-
ticipants were instructed to engage in negative self-imagery 
during the tasks and the other half received no instructions. 
Contrary to the hypotheses and the findings of Hirsch et al. 
(2004) with adults, few differences were found in observer- 
or self-rated anxiety or performance between the two control 
groups. The SAD group was consistently rated as more anx-
ious and less socially competent. The authors conclude that 

1 3400

negative self-imagery may be a consequence of social anxi-
ety rather than a causal factor as suggested by the cognitive 
model. However, it seems plausible that the null finding was 
due to design issues, in the sense that the manipulation of 
imagery was between-subjects which would give lower sta-
tistical power and also the control condition was not clearly 
defined. It is difficult to know what the imagery group was 
being compared to because participants in the comparison 
groups did not receive any instructions and were not subse-
quently asked about thought content during the experimental 
procedure. In comparison, the study of Hirsch et al. (2004) 
included a controlled within-subjects comparison (benign 
imagery). It therefore seems that there is scope for further 
causal experiments in adolescents including a tighter control 
over the experimental manipulation.

Video feedback with careful verbal preparation before-
hand is a core cognitive therapy technique aimed at cor-
recting negative and distorted self-imagery. Studies with 
adults have shown that the technique leads to more accurate 
appraisals of performance and reduced anxiety (Warnock-
Parkes et al. 2017), providing corollary evidence for the 
role of self-images in social anxiety. Turning to studies with 
adolescents, Parr and Cartwright-Hatton (2009) examined 
the effect of video feedback with 36 highly socially anxious 
14–17-year olds. Video feedback was provided with care-
ful preparation to prepare an unbiased mode of processing 
(c.f. Warnock-Parkes et al. (2017)). Compared to control 
participants (who sat quietly), young people who received 
video feedback after giving a speech felt less anxious about 
giving a subsequent speech (d = 1.43), predicted that they 
would perform better (d = 1.16) and went on to rate the later 
speech as better (d = 1.22). A somewhat similar study was 
undertaken with 11–13-year olds, scoring high and low on 
the SAS-A (Morgan and Banerjee 2006). Adolescents took 
part in a role-play task, with half receiving video feedback 
and half completing a distractor task prior to rating their per-
formance. In contrast to the findings of Parr and Cartwright-
Hatton (2009), the study did not find any improvements in 
participants’ performance ratings after video feedback for 
the high (d = 0.17) or low anxiety groups (d = 0.16). How-
ever, participants were not given any preparation for the 
video feedback. We know from adult research that whilst 
almost all studies have found the technique to be helpful, 
the two studies that have failed to find positive effects of 
video feedback (Rodebaugh 2004; Smits et al. 2006) did 
not include verbal preparation before watching the video. 
Careful verbal preparation is needed in order to overcome 
the processing biases that can undermine the effectiveness 
of the technique.

Reviewing the studies that have looked at self-imagery in 
adolescent social anxiety we find consistent results from the 
three questionnaire and interview studies (Ranta et al. 2014; 
Schreiber et al. 2012; Schreiber and Steil 2013), two of 

which reported on clinical samples. With a moderate effect, 
socially  anxious  youth  reported  more  frequent  negative 
observer-perspective social images compared to low scor-
ers. The only experimental study to be undertaken (Alfano 
et al. 2008) did not find a detrimental effect of asking young 
people to engage in negative self-imagery, but this may be 
due to design issues. Looking at the relevant data on video 
feedback, we find that in line with adult reports, the study 
that undertook video feedback with careful verbal prepa-
ration yielded positive effects of the technique, whilst the 
study that did not include it failed to find a benefit. Experi-
mental studies with clinical and non-clinical samples includ-
ing valid manipulations are still needed to test the model’s 
hypothesis that negative self-imagery plays a causal role in 
adolescent social anxiety.

Use of Internal Information

The cognitive model would predict that socially anxious 
individuals use internal information made accessible by 
self-focused attention to make excessively negative infer-
ences about how they look to others. This hypothesis has 
been supported in studies with adults. For example, Mansell 
and Clark (1999) asked adults with high and low levels of 
social anxiety to undertake a speech task. Participants rated 
their perceived body sensations and how they thought they 
appeared during the task. An independent assessor also rated 
how they came across. Amongst adults with high, but not 
with low social anxiety, a significant correlation was found 
between perceived body sensations and how anxious they 
thought they looked. The correlation between assessor rat-
ings and perceived body sensations was non-significant for 
both groups. The findings are consistent with the suggestion 
that socially anxious individuals use perceived bodily sen-
sations to make erroneous negative judgements about how 
they appear.

No studies have been undertaken examining this hypoth-
esis with adolescents. Ancillary support comes from three 
studies that have compared subjective and objective meas-
ures of arousal in adolescents. In a study by Anderson et al. 
(2010), subjective physiological arousal and heart rate dur-
ing a speech task were compared between 170, 13–17-year 
olds with SAD, high social anxiety adolescents and controls. 
SAD and high social anxiety adolescents both endorsed 
elevated self-reported arousal (measured on a subscale of 
items from the on Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck 
et al. 1988) compared to controls (SAD vs. low d = 0.71; 
high social anxiety vs. low d = 0.45), but did not differ from 
one another (d = 0.33). There were no differences in heart 
rate between the groups. Comparable findings were reported 
in an earlier study by Anderson and Hope (2009), compar-
ing SAD (n = 85) with controls (n = 285) during a speech 
and a conversation task. There was no significant difference 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414 

401

between groups in heart rate reactivity during the speech 
(d = 0.17) or the conversation (d = 0.15). However, adoles-
cents with SAD rated themselves as more physiologically 
aroused on the BAI during both the speech (d = 0.81) and the 
conversation task (d = 0.65). In a non-clinical sample of 136, 
9–17-year olds, high and low socially anxious youth were 
compared on self-reported and objective measures of heart 
rate and sweating during a speech task (Miers et al. 2011a). 
High social anxiety participants reported a higher heart rate 
and sweatier palms (d = 0.52), but no differences in heart rate 
or skin conductance levels were found.

These three studies are consistent in their finding that 
whilst socially anxious adolescents and controls are com-
parable on indices of objective arousal, the socially anxious 
groups consistently overestimate their bodily symptoms of 
anxiety (Siess et al. 2014). It could be argued that these 
results are in line with the cognitive model because when 
socially anxious adolescents overestimate their physical sen-
sations this may lead them to overestimate how anxious they 
look. However, studies in which adolescents are also asked 
how they think they appear are needed in order to directly 
test the hypothesis.

Use of Safety Behaviours

In adults, studies have found that socially anxious adults use 
safety behaviours in social situations more than those who 
are not socially anxious (e.g. Cuming et al. (2009), Pinto-
Gouveia et al. (2003)). We also have robust experimental 
data pointing to the causal role that these safety behaviours 
play in social anxiety in adults (e.g. McManus et al. 2009, 
2008). The data in relation to safety behaviours in children 
are scant (Halldorsson and Creswell 2017), but four studies 
have addressed the question in adolescents and they find 
similar results to in adults.

In the questionnaire study of Hodson et al. (2008), ado-
lescents completed a self-report measure of safety behaviour 
use, the Safety Behaviour Questionnaire (Clark 2003). High 
social anxiety adolescents endorsed a greater use of safety 
behaviours compared to middle (d = 0.65) and low (d = 1.01) 
scorers, who did not differ from each other (d = 0.32). Safety 
behaviour use was significantly associated with social anxi-
ety across the whole sample (d = 0.94), but it did not emerge 
as a unique predictor of social anxiety. In line with this study, 
Schreiber et al. (2012) using the same measure of safety 
behaviours (translated into German) found that high socially 
anxious 14–20-year olds used safety behaviours more than 
low socially anxious youth (d = 1.34). In contrast to the study 
of Hodson et al. (2008), they did find that across the whole 
sample safety behaviour use was a significant independent 
predictor of social anxiety but not of depression. Ranta et al. 
(2014) asked unselected adolescents about the safety behav-
iours they had used when they had felt socially anxious. 

17% of the whole sample reported using at least one safety 
behaviour when they felt socially anxious. Safety behaviours 
were more frequent in the high social anxiety group com-
pared to the low group (d = 0.68), and amongst those with a 
clinical or subclinical diagnosis of SAD compared to with-
out (r = 0.63). The fourth study was undertaken by Thomas 
et al. (2012). The authors administered a measure of safety 
behaviours developed with adults, the SAFE (Cuming et al. 
2009), and a measure of social anxiety to a group of adoles-
cents referred to a clinic with possible social anxiety and to a 
group of community controls. In line with hypotheses, social 
anxiety was positively correlated with safety behaviour use 
across the whole sample (r = 0.49), and the socially anxious 
group endorsed significantly greater safety behaviour use 
than the community controls (d = 0.77).

In summary, four studies have looked at safety behav-
iours in adolescent social anxiety. A medium to large effect 
was found. Unfortunately, all of the studies were correla-
tional. Studies modulating the use of safety behaviours and 
examining the effect (on, for example, anxiety, cognitions, 
self-focus and social performance) will be  important in 
order to test the hypothesis that these behaviours are caus-
ally implicated in social anxiety. Due to the sensitised peer 
environment during adolescence we would expect avoidance 
safety behaviours to result in particularly negative reactions 
from their peers, and so socially anxious adolescents will 
be susceptible to becoming locked into a vicious cycle and 
subjected to peer victimisation, which we know is especially 
common in adolescents (Troop-Gordon 2017). Experimental 
studies will be valuable here. Furthermore, there are as yet 
no studies examining the putative sub-types of safety behav-
iours, their effects amongst adolescents or developmental 
influences on the use of safety behaviours. For example, it is 
conceivable that there may be a developmental progression 
in young people’s use of safety behaviours. As children move 
into and through adolescence they may become increasingly 
sophisticated in their use of safety behaviours, for example 
moving from a reliance on avoidance behaviours towards 
increasing adoption of impression management behaviours.
The notion of safety behaviours provides a different per-
spective on the understanding of the inhibited or withdrawn 
behaviours of people who are socially anxious. Traditionally, 
these behaviours have been interpreted as a sign that the 
individual lacks social skills (Wong and Rapee 2015). How-
ever, treated adults do not show ongoing social skills deficits 
(for a review see Hofmann (2007)). When individuals are 
not anxious they do not show deficits in social skills. Any 
deficits in performance seem to be largely restricted to situ-
ations in which they are anxious, which suggests that they 
are an anxiety response rather than an indication of a lack 
of knowledge or ability (Alden and Taylor 2004). It seems 
likely that the apparent social skills deficits are in fact the 

1 3402 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

observable safety behaviours (and the avoidance behaviours 
in particular).

Turning to studies with young people, in pre-adolescents 
a recent review concluded that there is evidence for an asso-
ciation between social anxiety disorder and a skills deficit 
(Halldorsson and Creswell 2017). In adolescents, a number 
of studies have found that peers rate socially anxious youth 
as less socially skilled than non-anxious peers (e.g. Miers 
et al. 2011b, 2010). However, as highlighted by Wong and 
Rapee (2015), it is not possible to determine the direction of 
causality from these studies. Further, none of these studies 
have considered the contaminating effect of safety behav-
iours on social skills. As such, it is difficult to draw conclu-
sions from the available studies about whether there is a 
latent skills deficit. It will be important to test whether in 
adolescents, as in adults, the apparent performance deficits 
can in fact be explained by observable safety behaviours. 
Indeed, it seems plausible that if, as we suggest, socially 
anxious younger people do rely on avoidance safety behav-
iours more than impression management strategies, they may 
present as even more withdrawn and inhibited than socially 
anxious adults. As such, a performance deficit account could 
be drawn upon more readily with this population, despite the 
absence of an extant deficit. It will be important to test this 
hypothesis, as it has implications for our understanding of 
the maintenance of social anxiety and for treatment.

Pre‑ and Post‑event Processing

Pre‑event Processing

Worry is a feature of all anxiety disorders, and the cognitive 
model predicts that it is an important maintenance process 
in social anxiety as well. Examining this hypothesis, the 
questionnaire studies of Hodson et al. (2008) and Schreiber 
et al. (2012) both used a single item from the Social Phobia 
Weekly Summary Scale (Clark 2003) to measure pre-event 
processing (“over the past week, how often have you gone 
over in your mind things that you think might go wrong 
in a social situation before entering the situation”). In the 
study by Hodson et al. (2008), high socially anxious youth 
engaged in worry before social situations more than middle 
(d = 0.86) and low (d = 0.86) social anxiety groups, who did 
not differ from each other (d = 0.18). Across the whole sam-
ple, pre-event processing was significantly associated with 
social anxiety (r = 0.44) but also to depression (r = 0.42). It 
was a significant independent predictor of depression but 
not of social anxiety. This suggests that the process may 
not  be  specific  to  social  anxiety,  which  is  unsurprising 
given that repetitive thinking processes are implicated in a 
range of common mental health disorders (Watkins 2008). 
Schreiber et al. (2012) also found that high socially anxious 
youth reported more anticipatory worry than low scorers 

(d = 0.84). Again consistent with the findings of Hodson 
et al. (2008), pre-event processing was found to be an inde-
pendent predictor of depression but not social anxiety in 
regression analyses. A correlational study of 60 adolescents 
with an anxiety disorder diagnosis (Rabner et  al. 2017) 
found a significant correlation between self-reported social 
anxiety symptoms and worry (r = 0.432), as measured by 
the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (Chorpita et al. 1997).
Studies examining the related idea of anticipated per-
formance  criticism  are  relevant  here.  A  recent  study  of 
anticipated audience criticism (Ranta et al. 2014) tested the 
hypothesis that socially anxious adolescents tend to expect 
more negative audience reactions in non-threatening situ-
ations compared to their peers. Amongst 333 adolescents 
scoring in the top and bottom quartile of the SAS-A, their 
hypothesis was confirmed: socially anxious youth demon-
strated a tendency to expect negative classmate reactions 
(measured by self-report questionnaire) when they were the 
presenter (r = 0.60). There were no differences in expecta-
tions between anxiety groups when participants were asked 
to imagine an anxious peer rather than themselves, or in 
positive expectations of reactions. Similarly, in a study by 
Blöte et al. (2014), social anxiety was associated with more 
negative expectations of performance before a speech task 
(r = 0.32). Likewise, asked to rate expectations of their per-
formance in a videotaped role-play task, high socially anx-
ious young adolescents thought they would perform worse 
than low scorers (d = 0.51; Morgan and Banerjee (2006)). 
Erath et al. (2007) asked 42 high socially anxious and 42 
average anxiety adolescents to undertake a videotaped con-
versation task with a young adult. Higher social anxiety was 
significantly correlated with expectations of poorer social 
performance (r = 0.27). In addition, negative social perfor-
mance expectations predicted skill deficits in the conversa-
tion task (r = 0.25).

These  findings  are  all  consistent  with  the  cognitive 
model; pre-event processing involves a focus on potential 
negative outcomes of a social situation and an anticipation of 
social failure. These negative expectations will increase the 
likelihood that the situation is interpreted negatively, ones 
focus of attention shifts internally and safety behaviours are 
utilised, thereby maintaining anxiety. However, although 
using a variety of methods, all of these were correlational 
studies with analogue samples.

Post‑event Processing

Rumination is in many respects a similar process to worry, 
and like worry it is implicated in a wide range of men-
tal  health  difficulties  (Watkins 2008)  including  social 
anxiety. Only two studies have examined this process in 
adolescent social anxiety. Using comparable methodolo-
gies, both Hodson et al. (2008) and Schreiber et al. (2012) 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414 

403

examined whether group differences in post-event pro-
cessing could be identified amongst a stratified non-clin-
ical sample. Both used the Post-Event Processing Ques-
tionnaire (Rachman et al. 2000). It comprises 13 items 
related to how much the individual went over an event 
afterwards. Hodson et al. (2008) found that high socially 
anxious youth reported more post-event processing than 
middle (d = 0.62) or low (d = 0.95) groups (who did not 
differ from each other (d = 0.30). Post-event processing 
was significantly associated with social anxiety across the 
whole sample (r = 0.40) and with depression (r = 0.28). It 
was also a significant independent predictor of social anxi-
ety. In the study of Schreiber et al. (2012), high socially 
anxious youth endorsed more post-event processing than 
low scorers (d = 0.94). In regression analysis, post-event 
processing was not a significant independent predictor of 
social anxiety, but it was of depression.

In summary, only two studies have looked at the role of 
post-event processing in adolescent social anxiety. Whilst 
both indicate that the process is elevated in adolescents 
with higher levels of social anxiety (with a medium effect), 
they were questionnaire studies with analogue samples, 
limiting the conclusions that we can draw.

Summary

Reviewing the studies undertaken with adolescent samples 
we see that there is encouraging support for the hypoth-
eses derived from the cognitive model of Clark and Wells 
(1995).  However,  as  yet  the  majority  of  studies  have 
been undertaken with analogue samples, typically com-
paring extreme scorers on a measure of social anxiety. 
This is generally considered to be a valid research strat-
egy given that social anxiety is thought to vary continu-
ously across the population (Stopa and Clark 2001), but 
it will be important to replicate the findings with adoles-
cent clinical samples. Another limitation of the studies is 
that the majority of them have been correlational. As such 
the resultant findings provide promising support for the 
hypotheses but cannot demonstrate the causal status of the 
processes in the model. To address this gap in the litera-
ture, further experimental studies are needed in which the 
psychological processes of interest are manipulated and 
their effect on social anxiety observed. As well as this, 
when considering the downward application of a static 
adult model to a dynamic adolescent period, there is a 
need to consider the developmental influences that have a 
bearing on these processes. Notwithstanding these caveats, 
the literature is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that 
adapting the treatment derived from the model for adoles-
cents might be a promising approach. When considering 
this, attention must turn to the additional developmentally 

sensitive elements that may need to be included to explain 
the maintenance of social anxiety during the teenage years. 
There are features that are particular to adolescence that 
may well lock young people into the negative cycles that 
maintain social anxiety.

Developmentally Sensitive Factors 
Relevant to the Application of the Model 
to Adolescents

As outlined earlier, adolescence is a developmental period 
associated with particular cognitive, social  and  familial 
changes and these may well contribute to the persistence 
of social anxiety. We will focus here on the two factors that 
seem most salient and have been subject to the most sci-
entific interest: parental factors and friendships and peer 
victimisation. Our ambition here is not to undertake a com-
prehensive review of these factors, but rather to consider 
whether these factors are associated with social anxiety, and 
if so, how they may maintain key processes in the cognitive 
model. We also briefly touch on the relationship between 
social anxiety and social media use. Although the research 
field is still relatively small it is an area of particular rel-
evance in relation to adolescents and social anxiety.

Parenting Factors

Family processes, and parenting processes in particular, are 
commonly agreed to be a contributory factor in the develop-
ment and maintenance of child anxiety (Rapee et al. 2009). 
The vast majority of the research in this area has been con-
ducted with pre-adolescent children (Kendall and Ollendick 
2004). However, given that the demands of parenting will 
shift and change considerably as children move into ado-
lescence, it seems reasonable to think that parental influ-
ences on youth anxiety may also change during this time. 
For example, with increasing independence and autonomy 
the association between parental factors and child anxiety 
may be hypothesised to decrease over time. But it is equally 
conceivable that given the potential importance of parents 
in helping young people navigate their increasing autonomy, 
parental factors may be relevant in adolescent anxiety.

The  most  well-researched  dimension  of  parenting  in 
the aetiology and maintenance of youth anxiety is parental 
over-control or overprotection. This is defined as a pattern 
of behaviour involving overly protective, directive and con-
trolling behaviours, even when the situation does not require 
it, and discouragement of independent problem solving. A 
recent review concluded that the majority of available stud-
ies (75%) point to a significant contribution of parental over-
control to adolescent anxiety in general (Waite et al. 2014) 

1 3404 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

and there is some evidence of its association with social 
anxiety symptoms specifically in pre-adolescents (Halldors-
son and Creswell 2017).

In adolescents, three studies are particularly relevant 
when examining the relationship between parenting and 
adolescent social anxiety specifically (Loukas 2009; Fisak 
and Mann 2010; Caster et al. 1999). All were questionnaire 
studies undertaken with analogue adolescent samples in the 
USA. Adolescents completed measures assessing social 
anxiety  (the  SAS-A)  and  perceptions  of  parenting.  The 
study by Loukas (2009) looked at the relationship between 
social anxiety and the perception of maternal psychologi-
cal control amongst 479, 10–14-year olds. No significant 
association was found (r = 0.02 for females, and r = 0.10 
for males). The study by Fisak and Mann (2010) focused 
on 348 older adolescents (aged 15–18 years). Participants 
were split into ‘High’ (> 50 on the SAS-A) and ‘Low’ social 
anxiety groups. The high anxiety group rated their parents 
as more likely to model social fears, discomfort and avoid-
ance (d = 0.39) and to communicate shame and criticism of 
adolescent’s social interactions and skills (d = 0.47). Adoles-
cent perceived parental sociability and tendency to engage 
in social situations outside the family did not differ between 
groups (d = 0.08). Caster et al. (1999) undertook a large 
study comparing perceptions of parenting and the family 
environment made by adolescents categorised as high or low 
socially anxious. Adolescents were categorised in the high 
group if they scored at least one standard deviation above 
their gender and grade average on one or more of a number 
of measures of social anxiety (including the SAS-A). Those 
scoring at or below their gender and grade mean were clas-
sified as low social anxiety. High socially anxious youth 
rated all dimensions of the Family Environment Question-
naire (Caster et al. 1999) higher than low socially anxious 
youth. Specifically, they perceived their fathers and mothers 
as being more socially isolating, as being more concerned 
about others’ opinions, more ashamed of their shyness and 
poor performance, and less socially active (all d’s between 
0.37 and 0.69). A particularly interesting aspect of this study 
was the inclusion of parental reports of the family environ-
ment (using the same Family Environment Questionnaire). 
No significant differences in parent ratings of the family 
environment were found between parents of high and low 
socially anxious youths.

Overall, two of the three studies have found significant 
group differences between non-clinical groups scoring high 
and low on a measure of social anxiety. Interestingly, in one 
study this did not tally with findings on parent ratings of 
the family environment. All the studies used measures of 
perceptions of parenting. This makes sense in many ways, 
but if anxious adolescents are negatively biased in how they 
process information then higher scores on negative parenting 
dimensions may reflect a more general negative bias rather 

than a specific appraisal of parenting quality. Studies includ-
ing measures of parenting completed by socially anxious 
youth and their parents as well as observational assessment 
of parenting would greatly add to the field. There has also 
been a notable lack of experimental studies examining the 
effect of manipulating parent–child interactions. One excep-
tion was an elegant study carried out by de Wilde and Rapee 
(2008) (although with pre-adolescents (mean age 10.19y), 
hence not reported in detail here). In brief, mothers were 
either required to be minimally or overly controlling with 
their children during preparation for a speech task. In a sub-
sequent speech that the children prepared for alone, those 
whose mothers were overly controlling reported more anxi-
ety than those whose mothers had been minimally control-
ling. Studies such as this would be especially informative 
about the relevance of parenting processes in adolescent 
social anxiety.

We can now consider the ways in which aspects of par-
enting may relate to the processes specified in the cognitive 
model. It seems likely that the relationship between par-
ent and child anxiety, beliefs and behaviour is iterative and 
interactive (Rubin et al. 2009). Parents will bring their own 
attitudes and assumptions to their parenting practices. These 
parental beliefs are likely to motivate particular parenting 
behaviours (Rubin et al. 2009). Parenting beliefs character-
ised by a heightened perception of threat in the social envi-
ronment and/or appraisals relating to their child’s vulnerabil-
ity will most likely lead to anxiety about a child’s ability to 
thrive in a social environment. As such parents may engage 
in overprotective or over-controlling behaviours to mitigate 
their concerns (Rubin et al. 1999). Whilst well intentioned, 
we would suggest that these behaviours perpetuate the young 
person’s perception of social threat. The behaviours will be 
a source of evidence to the young person that they are less 
socially able than their peers and thereby maintain their 
negative attitudes (Ollendick and Hirshfeld-Becker 2002). 
Parental behaviours will become proxy safety behaviours for 
the young person. For example, a parent with these beliefs 
may step in and speak for their child, or give them permis-
sion to avoid social situations. These actions will preclude 
the young person’s opportunities to learn that their fears 
were unfounded or exaggerated. Some parents become con-
stant companions to their teenage children. This could dis-
courage the child’s peers from approaching or engaging with 
them, and so directly maintain social isolation.

Whilst some parents may hold overprotective beliefs, 
other parents may take quite a different view of the social 
environment and their child. Some parents’ beliefs may 
emphasise the importance of performing and being heard in 
a social situation. These may be driven by a parent’s temper-
amental extraversion or by a socially anxious parent who has 
coped by relying on impression management safety behav-
iours. Parents with these views may perceive their child to 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414 

405

be missing out on opportunities and as such may express 
disappointment when their child feels unable to take part 
in a social commitment (Knappe et al. 2010; Bruch 1989). 
Likewise, they may push their child to engage in excessively 
demanding social activities in an attempt to help them over-
come their fears. Again, we would suggest that whilst these 
behaviours are undoubtedly driven by good intentions they 
will maintain the young person’s anxiety. The young person 
will interpret expressed disappointment or frustration as 
evidence of their social failings. When faced with an exces-
sively challenging social scenario, rather than learning new 
lessons the young person will most likely worry intensely 
beforehand, rely heavily on safety behaviours to get through 
the experience, and then ruminate over it afterwards, thereby 
preserving the negative thinking patterns.

These proposals provide a number of testable hypotheses 
that have not yet been examined. If supported, the account 
opens up the potential utility of including specific, focused 
work with parents in certain cases, where unhelpful parental 
beliefs and behaviours have been identified and where the 
young person is not progressing in treatment as one would 
expect and hope. Several well-established cognitive therapy 
techniques would be well suited to address parental beliefs 
and behaviours. For example, parents could be helped to 
identify unhelpful beliefs they hold and the impact of these 
on their child’s social anxiety. This could set the stage for 
behavioural experiments to test out specific predictions. The 
involvement of the adolescent in these experiments is likely 
to increase their effectiveness.

Friendships and Peer Victimisation

As children progress into adolescence, their social relation-
ships become increasingly important (Furman and Buhrm-
ester 1992). They will begin to see their peers as their pri-
mary source of social support (Nickerson and Nagle 2005), 
and so peer relationships take on even greater significance. 
Adolescents start to manage their own social arrangements, 
and their relationships will become more complex through 
this period, with different groups, cliques and subgroups 
forming, and with the start of romantic relationships. It is 
unsurprising that good peer relationships are associated 
with broad indices of well-being in adolescents (Chu et al. 
2010). Alden and Taylor (2004) emphasised the importance 
of interpersonal processes in social anxiety and suggested 
that social anxiety is maintained by self-perpetuating rela-
tionship difficulties.

Numerous  studies  have  examined  the  relationship 
between  various  dimensions  of  peer  relationships  and 
social anxiety cross sectionally. Consistently, less positive 
peer experiences have been found amongst socially anxious 
adolescents compared to their less anxious peers, in terms of 
fewer friends, less peer acceptance, more victimisation and 

less numerous and happy romantic relationship (see Rubin 
et al. (2009) for a review). A number of longitudinal studies 
have considered the impact of social anxiety on later peer 
relations (e.g. Siegel et al. (2009); Vernberg et al. (1992)). 
For example, in a two month prospective study examining 
peer victimisation and social anxiety, Siegel et al. (2009) 
found that social anxiety predicted relational victimisation, 
a particular type of peer victimisation. Relational victimisa-
tion describes behaviours that use the relationship to in some 
way harm the intended victim, for example, not inviting a 
peer to a party, or not allowing another peer to join a group. 
Turning now to the reciprocal relationship, studies have also 
examined whether peer processes predict later social anxiety. 
In line with expectations, more negative peer relations have 
consistently emerged as a predictor of later social anxiety. 
For example, in a large sample of 12–19-year olds, lower 
levels of peer acceptance (as rated by peers) were associated 
with social anxiety levels one year later (Tillfors et al. 2012). 
A number of studies have found a relationship between peer 
victimisation and later social anxiety (Siegel et al. 2009; 
Storch et al. 2005; Vernberg et al. 1992). Interestingly, two 
studies (Siegel et al. 2009; Storch et al. 2005) again point to 
the significance of relational victimisation in social anxiety.
The  convergent  findings  of  a  reciprocal  relationship 
between social anxiety and peer difficulties are in line with 
the proposals of Alden and Taylor (2004) that social anxi-
ety may lock individuals into a vicious cycle of interper-
sonal difficulties. It seems likely that these problems may be 
heightened during adolescence, when the socially anxious 
adolescent’s peers are themselves likely to be self-conscious-
ness and particularly sensitive to potential rejection. This 
leads us to consider how peer problems may be related to 
the processes specified in the cognitive model. There are a 
number of ways this might operate, and the following mech-
anisms are suggested. When an individual experiences peer 
difficulties this may inform beliefs about their social accept-
ability directly and drive social anxiety. This suggestion is 
supported by findings from Grills and Ollendick (2002) in 
their study of 279 early adolescents. Amongst girls, per-
ception of global self-worth was found to mediate the rela-
tionship  between  anxiety  and  peer  victimisation.  Social 
anxiety will inevitably cause some peer difficulties because 
gross avoidance of social interactions will limit individuals’ 
opportunities to forge friendships. It is also suggested that 
the socially anxious adolescent may be more vulnerable to 
unfriendly or victimising treatment due to their appraisals of 
others and the negative beliefs they hold. For example, the 
tendency for socially anxious adolescents to make negative 
interpretations of ambiguous social cues may lead them to 
respond to a fairly neutral situation in an excessively meek, 
unfriendly or avoidant manner. This may in turn lead to 
genuinely negative responses from peers. The use of avoid-
ant safety behaviours will contaminate a social interaction; 

1 3406 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

for example, avoiding eye contact and speaking less will 
convey disinterest. This will make an individual less attrac-
tive to their peers, reducing peer acceptance and thereby 
strengthening negative social beliefs. Furthermore, specific 
safety behaviours such as agreeing with other people and 
copying the dress sense of others in order to ‘blend in’ may 
lead to particular negative responses from peers in adoles-
cence. This is because although adolescence is a time of low 
resistance to peer influence (Steinberg and Monahan 2007), 
it is also when individuals are concerned with determining 
their own identity and they are typically acutely sensitive to 
being copied.

Delineating these mechanisms provides a wealth of treat-
ment opportunities. For example, the problematic negative 
thinking patterns and safety behaviours that may be impli-
cated could be targeted well with existing cognitive therapy 
techniques. However, particular caution may be needed when 
planning behavioural experiments with teenagers in order to 
ensure positive outcomes. The ‘pack mentality’ of the social 
environment, increased frequency of peer victimisation, and 
heightened sensitivity to peer reactions in this period can all 
complicate behavioural experiments. Experiments should be 
set up in social contexts that are likely to lead to positive 
learning experiences for the adolescent patient. It may be 
necessary to undertake experiments in analogue social set-
tings prior to testing out fears with known peers.

Social Media Use

Almost all young people now have access to a smartphone 
or to a tablet, laptop or desktop computer (Lenhart 2015). 
Over 90% go online daily, and almost a quarter use the 
Internet ‘almost constantly’ (Lenhart 2015). Whilst many 
adolescents spend time playing video games when online, 
almost all engage with social media. The number of social 
networking sites has grown in the last few years with the 
launch of influential sites such as Snapchat and Instagram. 
Social media is now one of the main ways that young people 
communicate with one another (Gross 2004), with modes of 
communication such as email, telephone and SMS falling in 
popularity. This is in contrast to adults. Although as a group 
the number of adults using social media has grown over 
the last few years, age remains negatively correlated with 
use (Duggan et al. 2015). For this reason, the relationship 
between social media use and social anxiety is of particu-
larly relevance to adolescents. Because there are relatively 
few studies that have looked at social media use and social 
anxiety in adolescents, we have considered studies with 
both adolescents and young adult samples. Therefore, stud-
ies comprising adolescent samples are labelled as such and 
for those with adult samples we have included details of the 
age of the sample.

Online communication will hold great appeal for indi-
viduals with social anxiety (Pierce 2009). It provides the 
much-desired opportunity to interact with other people in 
a less anxiety-provoking setting than a face-to-face interac-
tion (Bonetti et al. 2010; adolescent sample). In line with 
this, a number of studies indicate a positive relationship 
between social anxiety and time spent on social networking 
sites (e.g. Lee-Won et al. (2015), mean age = 19.69 years, 
SD = 1.12 years; Shaw et al. (2015), mean age = 19.2 years, 
SD = 1.27 years; Orr et al. (2009), mean age = 21.5 years, 
SD = 5.29 years). One of the reasons online communica-
tion may be perceived as less threatening is because indi-
viduals feel they are more able to control the information 
they share and how they present themselves (Caplan 2007; 
mean age = 19.4 years, SD = 1.37 years). Indeed in a correla-
tional study, adolescents with greater social anxiety reported 
valuing the controllability of online communication (Peter 
and Valkenburg 2006; adolescent sample). It might be that 
this is because online, socially anxious individuals are able 
to engage in safety behaviours more intensively (Harman 
et al. (2005), adolescent sample; Campbell et al. (2006), 
mean age = 28.7, SD = 10.16 years). For example, they can 
repeatedly edit posts and spend time preparing responses to 
messages.

Social anxiety will influence the ways in which people 
use social media. For example, social anxiety is associated 
with more passive use of social networking sites such as 
Facebook (Shaw et al. 2015). Rather than interacting with 
other users or posting material, people with social anxiety 
spend more time browsing other peoples’ profiles (Sea-
brook et al. 2016, lifespan review, authors note that ‘the 
majority of studies examined young adults (late teens or 
early 20s)’). This type of use will lead individuals to gen-
erate unfavourable social comparisons (Vogel et al. 2015) 
thereby confirming negative social beliefs. Whilst we know 
that social comparison also occurs offline (Buunk and Gib-
bons 2007; review paper), the online environment may be 
particular problematic because such a wealth of informa-
tion is available (for example on profile pages, and through 
images and videos) and there are fewer limits on how long 
someone  can  spend  browsing  (Vogel  et  al. 2015;  mean 
age = 18.93 years, SD = 3.94 years). We would also expect 
social anxiety to influence the ways that socially anxious 
individuals actively use these sites. For example, it is sug-
gested that when socially anxious individuals do post mate-
rial, this may tend to be self-denigratory in content; it may 
be that they would prefer to ‘get the criticism in first’ before 
they can be maligned by others.

Social media also provides another forum for peer vic-
timisation. ‘Traditional’ bullying may continue after school 
and  extend  into  online  behaviours  (Juvonen  and  Gross 
2008; adolescent sample). Due to the anonymity that the 
Internet affords, there may be fewer barriers to perpetrating 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414 

407

bullying online and it may be harder to stop (Slonje et al. 
2013; adolescent sample). A survey of secondary school 
children found that the most common form of cyber bulling 
is name-calling via instant messaging (Smith et al. 2008; 
adolescent sample). Cyber bullying is associated with neg-
ative outcomes including social anxiety. Cross-sectional 
studies have found a significant association between social 
anxiety and cyber bullying (Dempsey et al. 2009, adolescent 
sample; Kowalski and Limber 2013,  adolescent sample). 
Two longitudinal studies indicate that social anxiety may 
confer vulnerability to online victimisation (Juvonen and 
Gross 2008; van den Eijnden et al. 2014, adolescent sample).
When thinking about treatment, we suggest that online 
social interactions need to be understood and addressed 
alongside those that occur face-to-face. This would start 
with a careful assessment of online behaviour at the begin-
ning of treatment. Online safety behaviours could be targeted 
well with existing cognitive therapy techniques.

Treatment Implications and Emerging 
Evidence

Cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder in adults is 
comprised of a series of techniques designed to reverse the 
processes specified in the Clark and Wells cognitive model 
(1995). The techniques are listed in Table 1. Broadly, the 
treatment adopts an approach which encourages the patient 
to discover for him or herself how their social anxiety is 
maintained. This is achieved through a focus on experiential 
exercises; for example, a behavioural experiment is under-
taken early on in therapy to demonstrate the unhelpful effects 
of self-focused attention and safety behaviours. Similarly, 
patients learn to focus their attention externally through 
a series of practical exercises. We would suggest that this 
method, of fostering cognitive change through action, is 
particularly well suited to adolescents, and we expect that 
many of the core elements of treatment could be employed 
successfully with adolescents with modest adaptations.

Only two randomised controlled trials have been under-
taken examining the effectiveness of therapeutic interven-
tions based on the cognitive model of Clark and Wells 
(1995)  with  children  and  young  people.  One  of  these 
involved children (Melfsen et al. 2011), but we describe it 
briefly here for interest. Forty-four socially anxious young 
people aged between 8 and 14 years of age were randomly 
allocated  to  individual  therapy  based  on  the  cognitive 
model or to a waitlist control group. The authors reported 
medium to large effects of individual therapy compared 
to waitlist control on clinician reported (German version 
of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule; d = 0.96) 
and self-reported outcomes (German version of the SPAI; 
d = 0.91). The results are certainly encouraging. However, 

the treatment did not represent a full implementation of 
cognitive therapy. For example, five to six sessions were 
dedicated to psycho-education. In cognitive therapy we 
would usually spend no longer than 15 min on this in ses-
sion one. Critical components, such as the safety behav-
iour and self-focused attention behavioural experiment 
that is undertaken in session two of cognitive therapy, 
were not included. In addition, the trial was with children 
not adolescents.

Ingul et al. (2014) undertook a randomised controlled 
trial with socially anxious adolescents in which individual 
therapy based on the cognitive model was compared to the 
adolescent group version of Coping Cat (The CAT Project) 
and an attention placebo. The attention placebo involved 
group meetings in which socially anxious young people 
interacted with peers and adults to a similar degree to the 
treatment  arms,  but  did  not  receive  any  of  the  hypoth-
esised active components of the two treatments. A large 
effect of individual therapy was found on the SPAI post-
treatment (d = 2.96). Surprisingly, there was no effect of 
Group CAT on self-reported SPAI (d = − 0.10) and a small 
effect of attention placebo (d = 0.50). The benefits of indi-
vidual therapy were maintained at follow-up. The results are 
promising with regards individual therapy; however, treat-
ment was not wholly consistent with cognitive therapy. For 
example, the first three sessions comprised psycho-education 
about anxiety, drawing up a broad model of anxiety main-
tenance, developing an anxiety thermometer and hierarchy, 
and learning about negative thoughts and thinking errors. 
An individualised version of the cognitive model was not 
introduced until session four (compared to session one in 
cognitive therapy).

In response to these promising findings, we undertook a 
treatment development case series to test preliminary feasi-
bility of cognitive therapy with adolescents (Leigh and Clark 
2016). Cognitive therapy was delivered to five adolescents, 
all of whom had severe and chronic social anxiety disor-
der as well as comorbid difficulties at the start of treatment. 
Four of the five had already received a standard course of 
CBT without apparent response. By the end of treatment, 
symptoms of social anxiety, as well as associated anxiety 
and depression, had reduced to subclinical levels and these 
gains were maintained at three to six month follow-up. All 
the young people also showed improved functioning, as evi-
denced by increased social participation and 100% school 
attendance at follow-up. Excitingly, we had the first indica-
tion that social anxiety treatment may also have a positive 
impact on classroom concentration, as evidenced by the self-
reported improvement across all five patients. The average 
change (79%) on the primary outcome measure (the Liebow-
itz Social Anxiety Scale; Liebowitz (1987)) was greater than 
observed in our trials of cognitive therapy for social anxiety 
disorder in adults (57 and 63% in Clark et al. 2003, 2006).

1 3408 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018) 21:388–414

Whilst the evidence base is extremely small, the results 
converge to suggest cognitive therapy may have important 
promise for adolescents with social anxiety disorder. Nota-
bly, although the trial of Ingul et al. (2014) did not test the 
full treatment, it demonstrated specific treatment effects.

Conclusions and Future Directions

The present review was motivated by an awareness of the 
divide in our understanding of the maintenance of social 
anxiety in adults compared to in adolescents. For example, 
in adults the development of empirically supported theo-
retical models to explain the persistence of social anxiety 
has paved the way for the generation of highly effective 
NICE recommended cognitive behavioural therapies (see 
Clark (2013) for a review). In contrast, a detailed mecha-
nistic  approach  to  understanding  the  maintenance  (as 
opposed to the aetiology) of adolescent social anxiety has 
largely been lacking. This lack of maintenance models has 
limited the development of specific treatment techniques 
for adolescents. In response to this, the present review 
has focused on one particular model of social anxiety, the 
cognitive model of Clark and Wells (1995) and its applica-
tion to social anxiety in adolescents. The review highlights 
the need for a programme of experimental studies with 
adolescents in order to test the causal role of the processes 
specified in the model. Notwithstanding this gap in the 
literature, the studies reviewed provide very promising 
support for the application of the model to this age group.
When adopting an adult model such as this for a youth 
population, it is of course essential to take a developmen-
tal perspective. It is suggested that there will be develop-
mental influences on the psychological processes specified 
in the adult model. For example, as individuals progress 
through adolescence we would expect that they may use 
different safety behaviours (younger adolescents may rely 
on parents to speak for them but this may become devel-
opmentally inappropriate for older adolescents) and that 
the  safety  behaviours  they  tend  to  rely  on  may  change 
over time (such as an increasing use of more sophisti-
cated  impression  management  safety  behaviours  with 
age). Turning to mental imagery, given that the ability to 
generate, inspect, maintain and manipulate mental images 
develops in an extended fashion through childhood and 
adolescence (Burnett Heyes et al. 2013), socially anxious 
adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to distressing 
social imagery, finding it difficult to inhibit images or shift 
attention away from them when they occur. But given this 
susceptibility, adolescents may also be particularly respon-
sive to interventions targeting negative imagery. Likewise, 
given that adolescence is associated with heightened self-
consciousness, socially anxious adolescents may show 

especially intense self-focus in social interactions, but they 
may also be especially responsive to an attention training 
intervention. No studies have yet examined these ques-
tions. As well as considering the developmental influences 
of the processes specified in the adult model, the explana-
tory power of the model will be enhanced with the addi-
tion of processes that are particular to adolescents, such 
as parental and peer processes. When considering these 
factors, it will be important to specify the mechanisms 
by which they maintain social anxiety in order to develop 
specific interventions.

The present review underscores the great potential for 
adapting and refining the cognitive model of social anxiety 
disorder (Clark and Wells 1995) for adolescents in order to 
improve treatment outcomes for this population.
