Keywords: anxiety | breast cancer | depression | exercise

ABSTRACT
Background: Numerous studies have investigated the effects of exercise on depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors, 
yet the results remain inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on depression and anxiety in 
breast cancer survivors and to ascertain the optimal exercise regimen for this patient population.
Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus 
until 28 October 2023. A meta- analysis was conducted to quantify the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI).
Results: A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Exercise significantly alleviated depression (SMD, −0.63, p < 0.0001) and 
anxiety (SMD, −0.49, p = 0.0002) in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, aerobic exercise (SMD, −0.44, p = 0.03) and multicompo-
nent training (SMD, −0.86, p = 0.002) were found to be particularly effective in alleviating depression. However, only multicom-
ponent training significantly alleviated anxiety (SMD, −0.66, p = 0.003) in breast cancer survivors. Additionally, multicomponent 
training conducted for ≥ 3 times per week (depression, SMD, −1.22, p = 0.006; anxiety, SMD, −0.93, p = 0.004) and ≤ 60 min per 
session (depression, SMD, −1.19, p = 0.002; anxiety, SMD, −0.85, p = 0.005) were deemed most effective in alleviating depression 
and anxiety in breast cancer survivors.
Conclusions: Exercise significantly alleviated depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors, with multicomponent training 
being the most effective intervention type. This meta- analysis provides clinicians with evidence to recommend that breast cancer 
survivors engage in multicomponent training more than three times per week, with each session lasting no more than 60 min, 
to alleviate depression and anxiety.

1   |   Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among 
women  worldwide.  It  is  estimated  that  by  2040,  there  will  be 
over 3 million new cases of breast cancer and 1 million deaths, 
implying  that  one  in  eight  women  will  be  diagnosed  with  the 
disease in their lifetime [1]. Breast cancer arises from abnormal 
breast cells growing uncontrollably to form a tumor. It is the pri-
mary  cause  of  cancer- related  death  among  women  worldwide 
[2].  Typical  symptoms  include  breast  lumps,  nipple  discharge, 
and enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit.

Breast cancer survivors refer to those who have undergone ini-
tial treatment, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemother-
apy,  and  are  currently  undergoing  hormone  therapy  or  are  in 
the follow- up phase. Throughout diagnosis and treatment, these 
individuals  frequently  experience  trauma  to  their  self- image 
and sexual relationships, leading to psychological reactions like 
denial, anger, or anxiety, thereby augmenting the risk of men-
tal  health  issues  [3].  They  routinely  confront  physical  symp-
toms,  psychological  reactions,  and  survival  challenges  [4,  5]. 
Emotional distress is regarded as the sixth vital sign in cancer 
care, as it can diminish patients' willingness to adhere to treat-
ment  plans  and  increase  the  risk  of  mortality  [6].  In  addition, 
cancer  survivors  who  suffer  from  emotional  distress  often  ex-
hibit  more  severe  depression,  anxiety,  pain,  fatigue,  and  func-
tional impairment and are at an increased likelihood of suicidal 
thoughts [7].

Recent  studies  have  shown  that  the  prevalence  of  depression 
and anxiety in breast cancer survivors is as high as 40%–54.5% 
and 40%–46.8%, respectively [8, 9]. Studies have identified pre-
disposing  factors  for  these  mood  disorders,  which  include  a 
history  of  depression  or  anxiety,  younger  age  at  diagnosis,  in-
adequate  social  support,  severe  somatic  symptoms,  aggressive 
cancer treatment, the use of certain medications, fear of death 
and disease recurrence, as well as changes in body image, fem-
ininity,  sexual  characteristics,  and  attractiveness  [8,  10,  11]. 
Additionally,  studies  have  shown  that  patients'  symptoms  of 
depression and anxiety may deteriorate during adjuvant chemo-
therapy [12].

Regarding  treatment  strategies,  interventions  like  cognitive 
behavioral  therapy  and  supportive- expressive  group  therapy 
have  proven  to  have  a  positive  effect  on  breast  cancer  survi-
vors  [13].  Concurrently,  exercise,  as  a  nondrug  intervention, 
has been effective in alleviating symptoms of depression and 
anxiety in breast cancer survivors, though its precise effect on 
these psychological symptoms warrants further investigation. 
Exercise has been found to improve mental health by mitigat-
ing symptoms of depression and anxiety in both clinical  and 
nonclinical populations [14, 15]. Blumenthal et al. [16] discov-
ered that exercise is an effective first- line treatment for mild- 
to- moderate  depression,  yielding  superior  results  compared 
to  antidepressant  medication.  Furthermore,  Philippot  et  al. 
[17] and Gordon et al. [18] found that regular physical activity 
significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety in 
adolescents.

In  recent  years,  research  has  commenced  exploring  the  impact 
of exercise on the mental health of breast cancer survivors, albeit 
with results exhibiting some inconsistencies. Liu et al. [19] con-
ducted an 8- week yoga intervention study and found that yoga can 
effectively alleviate depression and anxiety symptoms. Similarly, 
Shehab  et  al.  [20]  implemented  a  4- week  exercise  intervention 
with 72 breast cancer survivors and found that the intervention 
positively  influenced  depression,  anxiety,  and  quality  of  life. 
However, Prystupa et al. [21] observed that a mixed exercise in-
tervention improved anxiety symptoms but did not significantly 
affect depression symptoms. Zhang et al. [22] and Desautels et al. 
[23] noted that exercise had a positive effect on depression symp-
toms in breast cancer survivors but had a minimal effect on anx-
iety  symptoms.  In  addition,  Gokal  et  al.  [24]  demonstrated  that 
exercise positively influenced fatigue, self- esteem, mood, physical 
activity levels, and motivation readiness stages, yet did not signifi-
cantly affect depression and anxiety. These discrepancies under-
score the uncertainty in determining the most efficacious exercise 
regimen (encompassing type, frequency, and duration) for reduc-
ing depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors.

Multiple  meta- analyses  have  examined  the  effects  of  exercise 
interventions on depression or anxiety in breast cancer patients 
from various perspectives. For instance, Sun et al. [25] explored 
the  influence  of  exercise  on  depression  and  anxiety  in  breast 
cancer  patients,  but  their  study  only  included  those  who  had 
completed initial treatments, excluding patients undergoing on-
going  treatment  or  those  with  recurrent  or  metastatic  disease. 
Therefore,  the  findings  may  not  be  applicable  to  breast  cancer 
patients at other stages of the disease. Additionally, Patsou et al. 
[26]  conducted  a  meta- analysis  exclusively  focusing  on  stud-
ies  published  after  2011,  overlooking  earlier  relevant  research, 
which  may  have  contributed  to  discrepancies  in  their  conclu-
sions. Besides, Salam et al. [27] examined the effects of exercise 
on depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients, using scapular 
functional  training  as  an  exercise  intervention.  Whether  func-
tional  joint  training  can  be  utilized  as  an  exercise  intervention 
remains  to  be  proven.  In  the  meta- analysis  conducted  by  Zhu 
et al. [28] and Ramírez- Vélez et al. [29], some studies included a 
control group that performed stretching and flexibility exercises, 
making it more challenging to differentiate the effects of exercise 
interventions. Furthermore, the meta- analyses conducted by Lee 
et al. [30] and Sikandari et al. [31] focused on single outcome mea-
sures, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
or the Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES- D). Due to 
the  diverse  range  of  scales  used  to  assess  depression  and  anxi-
ety, the conclusions of these studies may have certain limitations. 
Regarding the specifics of exercise interventions, both Ramírez- 
Vélez et al. [29] and Patsou et al. [26] discussed the total weekly 
duration of the exercise interventions for breast cancer patients 
but did not provide detailed information about the specific struc-
ture of the interventions, such as the duration of each session or 
the frequency of sessions per week.

Therefore, this meta- analysis is grounded in rigorous randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) that aim to investigate the effects of exer-
cise on depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors and to 
ascertain the optimal exercise regimen for this patient population.

2   |   Materials and Methods

2.1   |   Design

The  Cochrane  Selection  Manual  and  the  Preferred  Reporting 
Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta- Analysis  (PRISMA, 
2020) guidelines [32] were followed for conducting this system-
atic  review  and  meta- analysis.  The  protocol  was  registered  on 
PROSPERO, with the registration number CRD42024524751.

2.2   |   Search Strategy

For  this  study,  literature  searches  were  conducted  up  to 
October 28, 2023, across five major databases: PubMed, Web 
of  Science,  Cochrane,  Scopus,  and  Embase.  The  search  pro-
cess  used  keywords  and  Medical  Subject  Headings  (MESH) 
such as exercise, cancer, depression, and anxiety to locate all 
exercise- related  studies  on  depression  and  anxiety  in  breast 
cancer survivors. In addition, to augment the search results, 
the  reference  lists  of  selected  studies  were  manually  scruti-
nized to identify potentially eligible articles. Two authors (Y. 
Z.  and  G.  L.)  independently  searched  and  screened  the  stud-
ies based on predetermined criteria. In cases of disagreement, 
a  third  author  (L.  Y.)  was  consulted  until  a  consensus  was 
reached.

which  examines  six  domains:  randomization  sequence  gener-
ation,  allocation  concealment,  blinding,  incomplete  outcome 
data, selection of reported results, and other biases. Each domain 
was assigned a risk level of “low,” “high,” or “unclear.” [34].

2.6   |   Statistical Analysis

Since  depression  and  anxiety  were  assessed  using  diverse 
questionnaires,  data  were  analyzed  using  a  random- effects 
model to derive standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI). For studies reporting standard errors 
(SE) or 95% CIs, the corresponding SD was estimated [35, 36]. 
In  addition,  the  analysis  of  image  data  was  performed  using 
the online software PlotDigitizer [37, 38]. In cases where sig-
nificant  heterogeneity  (I2 > 50%)  was  detected,  subgroup  and 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the sources of 
heterogeneity.

In  subgroup  analyses,  the  effect  of  exercise  on  depression  and 
anxiety was assessed based on type (aerobic exercise, resistance 
exercise, and multicomponent training [a training modality that 
involves  different  physical  capacities  in  the  same  exercise  ses-
sion] [39]), session duration (≤ 60 and > 60 min), and frequency 
(< 3 and ≥ 3 times per week). The forest plot was generated using 
RevMan.5,  while  Egger's  test,  sensitivity  analysis,  and  funnel 
plot were performed using Stata 18. The results were considered 
statistically significant if the p value was < 0.05.

2.3   |   Eligibility Criteria

Inclusion criteria encompassed: (1) studies designed as RCTs; (2) 
inclusion of both an intervention and a control group; (3) utiliza-
tion of breast cancer survivors as participants; and (4) measure-
ment of depression and anxiety as outcomes.

3   |   Results

3.1   |   Study Selection

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) non- English publications; 
(2) reviews and conference articles; (3) studies involving animal 
models; (4) publications with a high risk of bias or lacking full- 
text  access;  and  (5)  outcome  indicators  that  could  not  be  con-
verted into mean and standard deviation (SD) values.

2.4   |   Data Extraction

Two authors (Y. Z. and G. L.) independently extracted the data, 
comprising: (1) study characteristics, including the first author's 
surname, publication year, and sample size; (2) intervention de-
tails, such as type, duration, frequency, total treatment duration, 
and intervention duration per week; (3) participant characteris-
tics, encompassing age, body mass index (BMI), and time since 
diagnosis; and (4) efficacy outcomes, specifically the mean and 
SD  of  depression  and  anxiety  score  changes  from  baseline  to 
postintervention.

2.5   |   Methodological Quality Assessment

The assessment of the risk of bias was independently conducted 
by two authors (Y. Z. and G. L.), and any discrepancies were re-
solved  through  discussion.  The  Cochrane  Randomized  Trials 
Risk of Bias Tool (RoB- 2) was utilized for this assessment [33], 

As shown in Figure 1, 7270 article records were initially iden-
tified  from  the  databases  and  3  records  from  other  sources. 
After  excluding  duplicates,  4790  studies  remained.  Screening 
of  titles  and  abstracts  resulted  in  the  exclusion  of  4739  studies 
that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Upon full- text reading 
of the remaining 51 studies, 26 were excluded for the following 
reasons: (1) unextractable data (n = 12); (2) absence of outcome 
indicators (n = 8); (3) study protocol (n = 2); (4) lack of a control 
group (n = 2); (5) nonexercise interventions (n = 1); and (6) arti-
cle retraction (n = 1). Finally, 25 studies [20–22, 24, 40–60] were 
deemed eligible for systematic review and meta- analysis.

3.2   |   Characteristics of the Included Studies

Table 1 outlines the primary characteristics of the included stud-
ies. Of the studies, four were conducted in China [22, 41, 43, 51] 
and  the  United  States  [42,  47,  50,  57],  three  in  South  Korea 
[49,  52,  53]  and  Germany  [45,  48,  58],  two  in  Canada  [44,  54] 
and Iraq [20, 46], and one in the United Kingdom [24], France 
[55],  Ukraine  [21],  India  [40],  Netherlands  [56],  Iran  [59],  and 
Spain [60]. All included studies comprised 2577 female partici-
pants diagnosed with breast cancer. The intervention and con-
trol groups consisted of 1308 and 1269 participants, respectively. 
The 25 studies were published between 2007 and 2023. Among 
them, 14 studies involved multicomponent training [21, 22, 42, 
46, 48–50, 52, 53, 55–57, 59, 60], 10 focused on aerobic exercise

[20, 24, 40, 41, 43–45, 51, 54, 58], and 2 included resistance ex-
ercise [44, 54], with 1 study not specifying the intervention type 
[47].  The  specific  intervention  varied,  encompassing  walking, 
Tai  Chi,  Qigong,  Baduanjin,  yoga,  cycling,  sit- ups,  weight  lift-
ing, muscle stretching, and dancing. The intervention duration 
ranged  from  3  to  26 weeks,  averaging  11.92 weeks,  except  for 
one  study  that  did  not  report  the  duration  [57].  The  frequency 
of  interventions  varied  from  1  to  6  times  per  week,  averaging 
3.05 times per week, with two studies omitting this information 
[44, 49]. Session duration lasted between 30 and 125 min, averag-
ing 61.67 min, with four studies not detailing session durations 
[44,  47,  49,  54].  The  minimum  weekly  time  was  60 min,  while 
the average weekly time amounted to 167.72 min. However, four 
studies [44, 47, 49, 54] failed to report the specific weekly time.

depression  [SMD,  −0.86  (95%  CI,  −1.39  to  −0.32),  p = 0.002, 
I2 = 94%] in breast cancer survivors, with multicomponent train-
ing  being  the  most  effective  intervention.  However,  resistance 
exercise  showed  no  significant  improvement  in  depression  in 
breast cancer survivors [SMD, −0.01 (95% CI, −0.24 to 0.21), I2 
= 0%, p = 0.90, I2 = 0%, Figure 4].

Concurrently, multicomponent training had a significant effect 
on  alleviating  anxiety  [SMD,  −0.66  (95%  CI,  −1.10  to  −0.23), 
p = 0.003, I2 = 92%] in breast cancer survivors. However, aerobic 
exercise [SMD, −0.34 (95% CI, −0.70 to 0.01), p = 0.06, I2 = 85%] 
and  resistance  exercise  [SMD,  −0.01  (95%  CI,  −0.24  to  0.22), 
p = 0.92, I2 = 0%, Figure 5] showed no significant improvement 
in depression in breast cancer survivors.

3.3   |   Meta- Analysis

Compared  with  the  control  group,  exercise  significantly  al-
leviated  depression  [SMD,  −0.63  (95%  CI,  −0.93  to  −0.33), 
p < 0.0001,  I2 = 92%, Figure  2] and anxiety [SMD, −0.49 (95% 
CI,  −0.74  to −0.23),  p = 0.0002,  I2  = 89%,  Figure  3]  in  breast 
cancer survivors.

3.4   |   Subgroup Analysis

Stratifying  the  analysis  by  intervention  type,  aerobic  exercise 
[SMD,  −0.44  (95%  CI,  −0.83  to  −0.05),  p = 0.03,  I2 = 86%],  and 
multicomponent training had a significant effect on alleviating 

Since  multicomponent  training  was  the  most  effective  inter-
vention  type  in  alleviating  depression  and  anxiety,  we  con-
ducted further subgroup analyses focusing on multicomponent 
training.

3.4.1   |   Depression

Stratifying  the  analysis  by  session  duration,  multicomponent 
training conducted for ≤ 60 min per session significantly allevi-
ated depression in breast cancer survivors [SMD, −1.19 (95% CI, 
−1.95 to −0.43), p = 0.002, I 2 = 96%]. However, multicomponent 
training conducted for > 60 min per session had no significant 
association  with  depression  in  breast  cancer  survivors  [SMD, 
−0.22 (95% CI, −0.50 to 0.07), p = 0.13, I2 = 0%, Figure 6].

FIGURE 2    |    Results of the meta- analysis of the effects of exercise on depression in breast cancer survivors.

Additionally, when analyzing the subgroups by frequency, multi-
component training conducted for ≥ 3 times per week significantly 
alleviated depression in breast cancer survivors [SMD, −1.22 (95% 
CI, −2.08 to −0.36), p = 0.006, I2 = 96%]. However, multicomponent 
training conducted for < 3 times per week had no significant as-
sociation with depression in breast cancer survivors [SMD, −0.36 
(95% CI, −0.94 to 0.21), p = 0.21, I2 = 85%, Figure 7].

3.4.2   |   Anxiety

Stratifying  the  analysis  by  session  duration,  multicomponent 
training conducted for ≤ 60 min significantly alleviated anxiety 
in breast cancer survivors [SMD, −0.85 (95% CI, −1.45 to −0.26), 
p = 0.005,  I2 = 94%].  However,  multicomponent  training  con-
ducted  for  > 60 min  per  session  had  no  significant  association 
with  anxiety  in  breast  cancer  survivors  [SMD,  −0.21  (95%  CI, 
−0.83 to 0.41), p = 0.51, I2 = 78%, Figure 8].

Furthermore, when analyzing the subgroups by frequency, multi-
component training conducted for ≥ 3 times per week significantly 
alleviated anxiety in breast cancer survivors [SMD, −0.93 (95% CI, 
−1.57  to  −0.29),  p = 0.004,  I2 = 93%].  However,  multicomponent 
training conducted for < 3 times per week had no significant asso-
ciation with anxiety in breast cancer survivors [SMD, −0.21 (95% 
CI, −0.82 to 0.39), p = 0.50, I2 = 87%, Figure 9].

3.5   |   Adverse Events

Adverse  events  related  to  exercise  intervention  were  reported 
in 2 of 25 studies (8.0%). A total of 16 adverse events were doc-
umented.  Specifically,  eight  adverse  events  occurred  in  the 

intervention  group  and  eight  adverse  events  occurred  in  the 
control group. Furthermore, four adverse events were possibly 
related  to  yoga  practice,  while  the  majority  of  adverse  events 
were  not  associated  with  the  exercise  intervention,  suggesting 
that exercise was safe for breast cancer patients.

3.6   |   Risk of bias

The Cochrane Randomized Trials Risk of Bias Tool (RoB- 2) tool 
was utilized to evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies, 
considering  factors  such  as  selection,  performance,  detection, 
attrition, reporting, and other biases. As illustrated in Figure S1, 
the overall quality of the studies was categorized into three lev-
els:  low,  moderate,  and  high.  Specifically,  3  trials  posed  a  low 
risk of bias, 24 trials presented a moderate risk, and 2 trials ex-
hibited a high risk of bias.

3.7   |   Publication bias

The funnel plot was used to detect publication bias in all 28 de-
pression trials. Visual inspection of the funnel plot (Figure S2), 
along with Egger's test (t = −2.88, p = 0.008, Table S1), suggested 
the  presence  of  publication  bias  due  to  the  asymmetry  of  the 
funnel plot. The raw combined effect of exercise on depression, 
as  determined  by  the  trim- and- fill  method,  was  −0.631.  Upon 
correcting  for  publication  bias  using  the  trim- and- fill  method, 
the  overall  effect  size  was  −0.640  (95%  CI,  −0.932  to  −0.349, 
p < 0.0001).  Despite  some  publication  bias  in  the  results,  the 
conclusions drawn from the publication bias analysis do not un-
dermine the effectiveness of exercise in alleviating depression in 
breast cancer survivors.

Similarly,  the  funnel  plot  was  used  to  detect  publication  bias 
in  all  29  anxiety  trials.  Visual  examination  of  the  funnel  plot 
(Figure  S3)  and  the  results  of  Egger's  test  (t = −2.60,  p = 0.015, 
Table S2) indicated the existence of publication bias, evident in 
the asymmetry of the funnel plot. The raw overall effect of ex-
ercise on anxiety, as per the trim- and- fill method, was −0.486. 
After  correcting  for  publication  bias  using  the  trim- and- fill 
method,  the  overall  effect  size  was  −0.503  (95%  CI,  −0.751  to 
−0.256,  p < 0.0001).  Despite  the  presence  of  some  publication 
bias, the conclusions drawn from the publication bias analysis 
do not suggest that exercise is ineffective in alleviating anxiety 
in breast cancer survivors.

3.8   |   Sensitivity Analyses

The  sensitivity  analysis  revealed  that  regardless  of  the  exclu-
sion  of  any  individual  study,  the  positive  effect  of  exercise  on 
depression (Figure S4) and anxiety (Figure S5) in breast cancer 
survivors remained stable and consistent in both direction and 
magnitude.

4   |   Discussion

4.1   |   Main Findings

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  effect  of  exercise 
on depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors and to as-
certain the optimal exercise regimen for this patient population. 
Out  of  the  initially  identified  4790  search  records,  25  studies 
were deemed eligible for systematic review and meta- analysis. 

Our  results  revealed  that  exercise  significantly  alleviated  de-
pression  and  anxiety  in  breast  cancer  survivors,  with  multi-
component training being the most effective intervention type. 
Subgroup analysis further indicated that multicomponent train-
ing  sessions  lasting  ≤ 60 min,  performed  ≥ 3  times  per  week, 
significantly alleviated depression and anxiety in breast cancer 
survivors.

4.2   |   The Effects of Multicomponent Training on 
Depression in Breast Cancer Survivors

This systematic review and meta- analysis demonstrated that 
exercise  significantly  alleviates  depression  in  breast  cancer 
survivors, as evidenced by an overall reduction in depressive 
symptom scores of 0.63 (SMD). Additionally, a meta- analysis 
conducted  by  Pérez- Bilbao  et  al.  [61]  concurred,  showing 
that exercise and dietary interventions can effectively dimin-
ish  depression  in  breast  cancer  survivors,  aligning  with  our 
findings.

Regarding intervention type, aerobic exercise and multicompo-
nent  training  significantly  alleviated  depression  in  breast  can-
cer  survivors,  with  multicomponent  training  being  the  most 
effective type, which holds great clinical significance for breast 
cancer  survivors.  Brown  et  al.  [62]  supported  the  efficacy  of 
multicomponent training for cancer survivors, indicating that a 
combination of diverse training types more effectively improved 
depressive symptoms. In addition, Campbell et al. [63] showed 
that  resistance  training  alone  was  not  significantly  effective 
in  improving  depressive  symptoms  in  breast  cancer  survivors, 
aligning  with  the  findings  of  this  study.  Furthermore,  Zhou

et al. [34] showed that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and 
combined  training  all  significantly  improved  fatigue  in  breast 
cancer  survivors,  with  combined  training  yielding  the  most 
therapeutic effect, reinforcing the notion that multicomponent 
training is the optimal intervention for alleviating symptoms in 
breast cancer survivors.

necessitates a higher fitness level than aerobic exercise and may 
be less straightforward to implement, its high intensity predis-
poses it to foster greater exercise adaptation. Therefore, aerobic 
exercise was prioritized initially, and upon enhancing physical 
fitness, resistance exercise was incorporated to constitute a mul-
ticomponent training regimen.

However,  contrary  to  the  results  of  this  study,  some  research 
suggests  that  resistance  exercise  may  positively  affect  breast 
cancer  survivors'  symptoms.  Considering  the  limited  number 
and  poor  quality  of  articles  on  resistance  exercise  included  in 
this study, we believe that there is a high possibility that resis-
tance exercise positively affects depressive symptoms in breast 
cancer survivors. Additionally, given the low exercise tolerance 
in  breast  cancer  survivors,  resistance  exercise  may  exacerbate 
pain and discomfort, thereby compromising its positive effects.

Our  results  showed  that  multicomponent  training  appears  to 
be  the  optimal  exercise  modality  for  alleviating  depression  in 
breast cancer survivors [62, 64]. Multicomponent training is per-
ceived  to  bolster  physical  fitness  and  more  effectively  address 
depression,  anxiety,  fatigue,  and  sleep  disturbances  compared 
to  other  forms  of  exercise  [65].  Although  resistance  exercise 

Exclusively multicomponent training studies were analyzed in 
subgroups within this study, as it exhibits superior intervention 
outcomes. The objective was to furnish theoretical grounding for 
the  design  of  multicomponent  training  interventions.  Notably, 
multicomponent  training  significantly  alleviated  depression 
in  breast  cancer  survivors.  However,  the  study  also  identified 
substantial  heterogeneity.  Therefore,  subgroup  analyses  were 
conducted to elucidate the results. These analyses unveiled that 
multicomponent  training  lasting  ≤ 60 min  per  session  and  ≥ 3 
times per week markedly diminished depression in breast can-
cer survivors.

In  terms  of  intervention  frequency,  multicomponent  training 
conducted  ≥ 3  times  per  week  significantly  reduced  depres-
sion in breast cancer survivors, whereas training < 3 times per 
week  had  no  notable  impact,  which  aligns  with  the  findings

of  Campbell  et  al.  [63],  showing  that  engaging  in  at  least  3 
moderate- intensity  workouts  per  week  significantly  improved 
depression  in  cancer  survivors.  In  addition,  Craft  et  al.  [66] 
found that five workouts per week were more effective in alle-
viating  depression  than  two  to  four  workouts.  The  American 
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines recommend five 
low-  to moderate- intensity workouts per week for optimal train-
ing  outcomes  [67].  An  intervention  frequency  of  at  least  three 
times per week exerts a marked influence on depression, likely 
due  to  fostering  a  habitual  exercise  routine  [68].  Furthermore, 
there appears to be a dose–response relationship between exer-
cise volume and depression reduction, indicating that increased 
exercise amounts may correlate with enhanced symptom relief 
[63]. Zhou et al. [34] concurred, stating that the optimal train-
ing  effect  occurred  with  an  intervention  frequency  of  at  least 
three  times  per  week  and  a  total  of  at  least  180 min  per  week. 
It  is  also  recommended  that  breast  cancer  survivors  shorten 
individual  intervention  durations  and  increase  frequencies  to 
achieve  better  therapeutic  effects.  However,  our  study  did  not 
uncover  a  correlation  between  improved  physical  function 
and exercise dosage in breast cancer survivors, suggesting that 

increasing exercise frequency may yield a stronger cumulative 
effect, thereby optimizing training outcomes, improving physi-
cal function, and mitigating depression.

Regarding  intervention  duration,  sessions  lasting  ≤ 60 min 
significantly  reduced  depression  in  breast  cancer  survivors, 
whereas  longer  sessions  had  no  significant  effect.  The  find-
ings of Rethorst et al. [69] support this, showing that exercise 
sessions lasting 45 to 59 min had a stronger antidepressant ef-
fect. Similarly, Li et al. [39] found no significant improvement 
in cognitive function in multiple sclerosis patients with exer-
cise interventions exceeding 60 min, implying that prolonged 
exercise  may  not  yield  additional  benefits.  Given  that  breast 
cancer  survivors  often  have  lower  exercise  tolerance  than 
healthy  individuals,  extended  exercise  sessions  may  induce 
fatigue  and  exacerbate  depressive  mood.  Moreover,  breast 
cancer  survivors  frequently  experience  discomfort  and  pain 
during  exercise,  further  diminishing  their  exercise  tolerance 
[47].  Therefore,  enhancing  exercise  frequency  rather  than 
merely extending exercise durations may be a more effective 
approach.

4.3   |   The Effects of Multicomponent Training on 
Anxiety in Breast Cancer Survivors

This systematic review and meta- analysis demonstrated that exer-
cise can significantly alleviate anxiety in breast cancer survivors, 
leading to an overall reduction in anxiety scores by 0.49 (SMD). A 
study conducted by Loh et al. [70] indicated that a structured ex-
ercise program spanning 6 weeks significantly improved anxiety 

and emotional distress in elderly cancer survivors. In addition, a 
retrospective study showed that exercise positively alleviated anx-
iety, thereby improving both overall and disease- specific health- 
related quality of life (HRQoL) in cancer survivors [71].

The current study investigated the effect of exercise on anxi-
ety  in  breast  cancer  survivors  and  yielded  inconsistent  find-
ings.  While  several  studies  indicated  no  significant  effect  of

the majority of studies have established that exercise can sig-
nificantly  alleviate  anxiety  in  breast  cancer  survivors.  The 
discrepancy might be attributed to the relatively low baseline 
anxiety  of  cancer  survivors  at  the  commencement  of  these 
studies.

From an intervention model perspective, the present study dis-
covered that only multicomponent training led to a significant 

reduction  in  anxiety  in  breast  cancer  survivors.  While  certain 
studies  have  indicated  that  aerobic  exercise  and  resistance 
exercise  might  significantly  lower  anxiety  in  breast  cancer 
survivors, stronger evidence favors the implementation of mul-
ticomponent  training  for  alleviating  anxiety  in  breast  cancer 
survivors [62, 63, 73]. However, there is a lack of studies com-
paring the relative efficacy of aerobic exercise, resistance exer-
cise, and multicomponent training in treating anxiety in breast 
cancer survivors. Multicomponent training is considered more 

13 of 17

potent in alleviating anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep dis-
turbances  due  to  its  more  comprehensive  physical  adaptations 
[74]. Furthermore, its higher training volume and intensity are 
more likely to trigger these adaptations.

Given multicomponent training's proven effectiveness in allevi-
ating anxiety in breast cancer survivors, this study specifically 
conducted a subgroup analysis focusing on this approach. The 
analysis showed that multicomponent training significantly al-
leviated anxiety in breast cancer survivors, albeit with notable 
variations between studies. The subgroup analysis further iden-
tified  that  multicomponent  training  sessions  lasting  ≤ 60 min 
and conducted ≥ 3 times per week led to a significant reduction 
in anxiety in breast cancer survivors.

Previous  research  reported  that  aerobic  exercise  conducted  at 
least three times per week can effectively alleviate anxiety in can-
cer survivors and that the effect is even more pronounced when 
training is undertaken five times per week compared to two to four 
times per week, thereby reinforcing our perspective [63, 69, 73]. 
Due to the increased weekly exercise volume, a frequency of ex-
ercising  more  than  three  times  per  week  is  hypothesized  to  be 
more conducive to fostering physical adaptation. In addition, an 
intervention frequency of at least three times per week may fos-
ter a habit of regular exercise, which subsequently has a favorable 
influence on the amelioration of anxiety. Regarding intervention 
frequencies  of  less  than  three  times  per  week,  Zhou  et  al.  [34] 
found  that  they  can  still  significantly  improve  fatigue  in  breast 
cancer survivors. Therefore, it is imperative to acknowledge the 
potential  benefits  of  intervention  frequencies  below  three  times 
per week, and such frequencies can still be considered when con-
sidering the intervention's duration and measures.

In terms of the duration of a single intervention, sessions lasting 
≤ 60 min have been found to significantly diminish anxiety in 
breast  cancer  survivors,  whereas  longer  interventions  exceed-
ing  60 min  are  ineffective.  Given  the  low  exercise  tolerance  of 
breast  cancer  survivors,  we  posit  that  the  primary  reason  for 
this phenomenon is that extended exercise may induce fatigue, 
which not only exacerbates the physical strain on breast cancer 
survivors  but  may  also  augment  anxiety,  thereby  diminishing 
the positive mental health benefit of exercise [34]. Furthermore, 
considering the variations in physical capabilities in breast can-
cer survivors, prolonged interventions may surpass their physi-
cal limits, leading to discomfort and pain, which can adversely 
impact  mental  health  [47].  Moreover,  prolonged  exercise  can 
lead  to  boredom  and  a  loss  of  motivation,  particularly  in  the 
absence of adequate motivation and support. This lack of perse-
verance may further undermine the effectiveness of exercise in 
alleviating anxiety.

on  depression  and  anxiety  in  breast  cancer  survivors.  Thirdly, 
while  the  exercise  interventions  in  the  included  studies  were 
relatively  uniform  in  type,  there  was  considerable  variation 
in  intervention  details,  which  could  be  the  primary  contribu-
tion  to  the  high  heterogeneity  observed  in  the  study  results. 
Additionally, statistical analyses pertaining to exercise intensity 
and  intervention  supervision  have  yet  to  be  conducted,  neces-
sitating  future  studies  with  larger  sample  sizes  and  higher  re-
search  standards  to  validate  our  findings.  Furthermore,  given 
the high heterogeneity among the studies, the results should be 
interpreted  with  caution  and  moderation.  Moreover,  the  opti-
mal arrangement of multicomponent training content remains 
unclear, and further studies are needed to explore the design of 
exercise prescriptions. Finally, due to the variations in treatment 
cycles  among  patients  included  in  different  studies,  as  well  as 
differences in patients' health conditions and factors contribut-
ing to anxiety and depression, the results of our study should be 
interpreted with caution.

5   |   Conclusion

Exercise  significantly  alleviated  depression  and  anxiety  in 
breast  cancer  survivors,  with  multicomponent  training  being 
the  most  effective  intervention  type.  This  meta- analysis  pro-
vides clinicians with evidence to recommend that breast cancer 
survivors engage in multicomponent training more than three 
times per week, with each session lasting no more than 60 min, 
to alleviate depression and anxiety.

Data Availability Statement

There are several limitations to this study that ought not to be 
overlooked.  Firstly,  the  included  studies  were  all  RCTs  of  ex-
ercise  interventions,  where  complete  blinding  was  unfeasible. 
Therefore,  subjective  factors  may  have  introduced  a  degree  of 
bias  into  the  quality  assessment  process.  Secondly,  some  in-
cluded  studies  failed  to  report  the  exercise  intensity  in  detail, 
hindering a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of intensity 

Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created 
or analyzed in this study.
