Abstract
Purpose of Review Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the West World. Coping with cancer
is cause of extreme stress for patients and their family. The purpose of this review is to evaluate possible approaches to follow to
control those situations that can impact on quality of life (QoL) and compliance to treatments.
Recent Findings Anxiety, distress, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder are the most frequent psychological disorders in
BC patients. Cognitive disorders and sexual dysfunction can also be important in affecting QoL both in younger and older
patients. Younger and older patients show different characteristics of these disorders and different strategies of managing them.
Summary Several psychotherapeutic and supportive approaches have proven effective in managing psychological disorders in
BC patients. Every BC patient should be supported with these techniques during her entire oncological history, in order to
increase QoL and compliance to treatments.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy
diagnosed in women in the West World with one in eight
women developing breast cancer (BC) in her lifetime [1].
Localized disease accounts for 61% of all BC diagnosed in
the USA, and the 5-year survival rate for this population ap-
proaches 98% [2]. In Italy, BC represents 22% of neoplasms
diagnosed in elderly women [3].

Facing BC represents huge stress for the patient that has to
deal with new and challenging issues and choices. Accepting

diagnosis, undergoing treatments, understanding prognosis,
handling possible side effects, managing a possible relapse,
facing an uncertain future, are all stages of a stressful process
that can cause psychological instability and can lead to depres-
sion or other mood disorders.

A large proportion of BC patients experience multiple con-
current psychological symptoms during their cancer care tra-
jectory, such as distress, anxiety, depression, cognitive impair-
ment, and body image/sexual dysfunction [4].

Distress, Anxiety, and Depression

Anxiety is one of the most common psychological symptoms
in BC patients, with rates ranging from 10 to 30% [5]. The
patient can experience anxiety symptoms because of the an-
ticipation of negative outcomes [6], and the uncertainty about
the future; anxiety can spring from the concern over recur-
rence and the worry of treatment side effects both during
and after treatments [7, 8]. Recent findings suggest that anx-
iety is even more prevalent than depression [9], in contrast to
what has been presented in the past [10].

Distress is a broad construct, covering a wide continuum of
emotions related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and adjust-
ment disorder [11]. Even though prognostic prospects are

38    Page 2 of 7

relatively good, a BC diagnosis is threatening and confronts
women with numerous additional stressors, such as treatment
and its side effects [12]. BC patients’ distress levels may rise at
different stages throughout the disease trajectory [13]. For exam-
ple, some patients experience clinical distress at the time of di-
agnosis, yet during the active phases of treatment, BC patients
report higher distress when compared to prostate cancer patients,
expressing concerns about fatigue, family and friends, weight,
fears, worries, and pain [14]. Other BC patients are mostly af-
fected after treatment due to the discontinuation of regular con-
tacts with medical specialists and/or to treatment-induced side
effects [13]. Among the sociodemographic factors, younger age,
living with a partner and children or only with children, and
having a paid job, predict a greater endurance of clinical distress.
From an oncological point of view, having a mastectomy, che-
motherapy or radiation, and chemotherapy compared to radiation
therapy alone, were strong clinical predictors of durable distress
[13]. In addition, having received psychosocial services before
the BC diagnosis, and having two or more comorbid conditions
are also strong predictors of long-lasting distress.

Among patients with all types of cancer, the prevalence of
depression among those with BC is the third highest after
pancreatic and head and neck cancer [5, 15]. The rate of de-
pression in BC patients was estimated between 10 and 30%,
depending on the study population, study design, and choice
of depression measure [5]. It negatively affects women’s treat-
ment regime, quality of life (QoL), self-care, and decreases
immunity and chances of survival [16]. Diagnosis of depres-
sion can be challenging in cancer patients because symptoms
of depression overlap with physical symptoms as a conse-
quence of illness or treatment.

Both anxiety and depression have a tremendous impact on
BC patients. The literature contains a disproportionate number
of studies involving younger versus older patients, although
the rates of depression after BC are similar between the two
groups [17].

Elderly BC Patients and Psychological Profile

In elderly BC patients, several factors may add psychological
burden, such as a decreased reserve and social supports, clinical
bias toward undertreatment and a particular sensitivity to effec-
tive medical communication [17]. Elderly women may be less
disposed to see a psychiatrist or psychologist, or to seek medical
help for any breast symptom. Instead, they report more con-
cerns about disfigurement and financial consequences related to
health care, resulting in a delay in cancer treatment of up to
three months [18]. Regarding other psychological characteris-
tics that could influence mood and distress in BC patients, the
only paper exploring resilience in BC survivors did not report
an influence of age on this construct [19]. On the other hand, a
recent paper exploring coping styles among young and old
cancer patients [20(cid:129)] showed that older individuals have a

resignation strategy. This results in higher levels of anxiety
and depression, scarce cognitive strategies, a conviction of
low control on events, low compliance, and an attitude of re-
nunciation. This study does not support the previous data dem-
onstrating older BC survivors had lower distress that younger
BC patients [21]. Compared to younger BC survivors, older
survivors are often diagnosed at a life stage frequently without
multiple responsibilities as primary caregivers to their spouses
or partners, children, and parents, and are often retired from
work. Intuitively, older BC patients are less threatened by death
because they cope better with major medical crises [21].
Moreover, comparing to younger patients, older patients have
less fear of recurrence. Timing of onset and duration of symp-
toms are different too: younger survivors demonstrate an in-
crease of fear during the first 1.5 years after surgery, while in
older survivors, levels of fear are stable for the first 6 months
after which it declined [22]. Although the data on distress,
anxiety, and depression are not homogeneous, several factors,
including age, education, social support, and treatment charac-
teristics, appear to have an effect on patients after BC diagnosis.
Particular attention should be paid to anxiety/depression in el-
derly BC patients because of the demonstration of specific pe-
riods of time and associated risk factors which can influence
mood in older patients (Tables 1 and 2) [17].

One of the challenges in facing these issues in elderly pa-
tients is the phenomenon that the number of studies on the
effectiveness of psychooncological interventions for patients
with breast and other cancers decrease with increasing age and
are extremely limited among patients older than 60 years [23].
Possible interventions for elderly patients to reduce psychoso-
cial problems are supportive psychotherapy, mindfulness-
based stress reduction protocol, and cognitive behavioral ther-
apy. The specific intervention described for geriatric cancer
patients are coping and communication support for older can-
cer patients (CCS) and CARE intervention—cancer and ag-
ing: reflections of elders [24]. Also, web-based intervention

Cancer and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

For some patients their cancer experience is decisively trau-
matic, with psychological consequences that might result in
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [26(cid:129)]. PTSD is a mental
disorder occurring after exposure to life-threatening episodes
(criterion A) and is characterized by intense reliving of the
traumatic event through intrusive memories and nightmares
(criterion B); avoidance of reminders of the event (criterion
C); negative alterations in cognitions and mood (criterion D);
hypervigilance toward potential threats in the environment
(criterion E); and in some cases, persistent or recurrent deper-
sonalization symptoms [27]. Cancer patients often describe
constant concerns, nightmares about the neoplastic disease
or the treatment, and worries of recurrence and about the fu-
ture. Intrusive symptoms are the most prevalent, with a rate of
11–45% [26(cid:129)]. Evidence examining PTSD symptomatology
among long-term cancer survivors shows rates of lifetime
cancer-related PTSD that range from 3 to 22%, [26(cid:129)].

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
therapy is an eight-phase psychotherapeutic comprehensive
approach that has been extensively researched and proven
effective for the treatment of trauma [28]. According to the
World Health Organization (2013), trauma-focused cognitive
behavioral therapy and EMDR therapy are the only psycho-
therapies recommended for children, adolescents, and adults
with PTSD. Two recent papers describe the efficacy of EMDR
in cancer patients: Jarero et al. [29] performed a randomized
clinical trial (RCT) investigating the eye movement desensiti-
zation and reprocessing Integrative Group Treatment Protocol

adapted for ongoing traumatic stress (EMDR-IGTP-OTS) in
women with cancer. Data analysis showed that the EMDR-
IGTP-OTS was effective in significantly reducing symptoms
of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, which was maintained at
the 90-day follow-up. The standard EMDR Integrative Group
Treatment Protocol for early intervention provides individual
EMDR therapy in a group setting. The protocol provides
EMDR’s eight phases [28] in a group therapy model with an
art therapy format (e.g., drawings, symbols). It uses the
Butterfly Hug (BH) method as a self-administered bilateral
stimulation to process traumatic material. During the session,
the patient draws a picture or symbol representing the trau-
matic events and then focuses on it for an average of 3 min
while performing the BH method. This process is repeated
four times in the session, with the patient usually reporting
substantial decreases in the subjective disturbance at the ses-
sion end.

Carletto et al. [26(cid:129)] performed a quasiexperimental study
comparing the neurobiological correlates of two different ther-
apeutic interventions (EMDR versus treatment as usual—
TAU) for treating cancer-related PTSD in women with BC.
Participants received 10 EMDR sessions over a period that
varied between 2 and 3 months. EMDR was administered in
accordance with Shapiro’s protocol for traumatic events [28],
and it specifically followed the EMDR specific protocol for
oncological patients [30]. The TAU group received four ses-
sions of supportive therapy, one every other week for 2
months. This consisted of standard treatment to support pa-
tients in coping with the psychological symptoms related to
BC. Participants were assessed using EEG at two separate
time points: at baseline (T0) and after the last session of
EMDR or TAU treatment (T1). EMDR was found to be su-
perior to TAU in reducing the proportion of patients who were
classified as having a PTSD clinical diagnosis. EMDR result-
ed in a clinically significant improvement, achieving scores
below the clinical threshold in intrusive, avoidant, and hyper-
arousal symptoms. Furthermore, EMDR was found to be ef-
fective in reducing depressive symptoms. Neither EMDR nor
TAU was effective in reducing anxiety symptoms.

Cognitive Impairment

Many BC survivors report changes in memory and overall
cognition during or after chemotherapy or hormone therapies
[31], often referred to as ‘Chemo brain’. Chemo brain (CB) (or
chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment CICI) includes
impairment of a patient’s memory, learning, concentration,
reasoning, executive function, attention, and visuospatial
skills during and after the discontinuation of chemotherapy
[31]. These symptoms have significant negative implications
on activities of daily life, including driving, paying bills, and
reading dense or ‘technical’ material [32]. Although CB is

38    Page 4 of 7

Curr Oncol Rep (2021) 23: 38

frequently associated with treatment, the cause of this per-
ceived decrease in cognitive function is unclear: some poten-
tial factors are systemic chemotherapy or adjuvant hormone
therapies (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen), or the associa-
tion with a cancer diagnosis. For example, BC patients often
present acute stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders
all of which can worsen cognitive function [31]. Numerous
studies investigated the relationship between hormone/
aromatase inhibitors or chemotherapy and perceived reduction
in cognitive ability. These studies showed that, often, these
symptoms are not supported by formal cognitive testing [31],
and this has led many researchers to approach CB by address-
ing real cognitive loss versus perceived cognitive loss [33,
34]. These studies have relied on small sample sizes, included
heterogeneous disease and treatment groups, lacked pretreat-
ment chemotherapy assessments, and used normative control
data [35(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Even if only perceived, CB significantly alters the
QoL and should be considered as such when assessing BC
patients’ needs. One suggestion for the general oncology prac-
tice is that older patients should be evaluated for frailty and
cognitive reserve [36, 37]. Several brief screening tools for
orientation, mental status, and basic cognitive functions are
available and can be easily administrated, but they lack sensi-
tivity to detect subtle cognitive changes [38]. For this reason,
extensive neuropsychological evaluation of verbal memory
(short and long term) and nonverbal memory executive func-
tions, mental processing, language, and attention is recom-
mended using written tests to assist in distinguishing cancer
treatment–related problems from incipient dementia [38].

As the field of geriatric oncology moves forward, it will be
important to ensure that series of tests are valid and have an
adequate standardization. The results of these assessments
could then be useful as adjunct tools for identifying subgroups
of older patients who are likely to be at the highest risk for
cognitive decline after systemic therapy.

Treatment options for the older patient includes cognitive
rehabilitation training, which strengthens and restores cogni-
tive abilities by means of cognitive drills. Regarding BC pa-
tients, several studies demonstrated good results but only at a
younger age [39, 40]. Compensatory remediation techniques
are simpler than cognitive rehabilitation and offer strategies
for everyday life, e.g., the use of calendars, planners, and
timers.

The development and delivery of home-based or web-
based interventions may have advantages over traditional
clinic–based interventions. However, there is a scarcity of
innovative interventions for cognitive training [41(cid:129)]. A recent
review showed that, to date, none of these were specifically
developed for BC patients [41(cid:129)].

Regarding psychopharmacological interventions, studies
on methylphenidate and modafinil showed mixed results
[38], therefore larger studies are warranted to assess the valid-
ity of drug effects on cognitive performances.

Body Image and Sexual Dysfunctions

Body image (BI) is conceptualized as a multifaceted construct,
defined as “the mental representation of one’s body, thoughts,
and feelings about one’s physical appearance, attractiveness,
and competence, as well as one’s perceived state of overall
health wholeness, functioning, and sexuality” [42]. A diagno-
sis of BC is likely to further exacerbate the women’s propen-
sity to focus on body image–related evaluation and investment
[43]. Losing a breast is inherently linked to a woman’s iden-
tity, sexuality and sense of self, with approximately one-third
of BC survivors expressing distress directly related to dis-
turbed body image after successful cancer treatment, particu-
larly among younger women [44]. Although BI disturbances
usually improve over time, the subgroup of BC survivors con-
tinues to experience BI-related concerns despite breast conser-
vation or reconstruction techniques [42].

Body image has been validated to be associated with women’s
sexuality [45]. Amongst BC patients, 73.4% have sexual dysfunc-
tions, suggesting that women with BC constitute a high-risk
group [46]. This may be due to BC-specific treatment experi-
ences, such as BI changes after breast surgery, hormone treat-
ments, changes in hormone levels after ovariectomy, and the
physiological and psychological effects of chemoradiotherapy.
Attention should be paid to changes in sexual function affecting
women with BC [46]. Natural menopause, drugs, or surgical
castration can all contribute to reduced estrogen levels in women
with BC, and these reduced levels can induce or aggravate sexual
dysfunction ultimately leading to a reduction in sexual desire,
reduced sexual arousal, lack of vaginal lubrication, pain during
intercourse, difficulty achieving orgasm, and genital hypoesthesia
[46]. Women’s intrapsychic experience of changes to sexuality
includes a fear of loss of fertility, negative body image, feelings of
sexual unattractiveness, loss of femininity, as well as alterations to
a sense of sexual self; the impact of such changes can last for
many years after successful treatment and can be associated with
serious physical and emotional side effects [47]. Even if sexuality
is mostly investigated in young patients, it is important to show
that approximately 53% of adults between the ages of 65 to 74 are
sexually active [48]. Sexuality is one of the first elements of
everyday life influenced by cancer and unlike other side effects
that tend to improve over time, survivors’ untreated sexual prob-
lems typically persist or worsen [49]. The causes of sexual dys-
function in elderly patients are related to physical changes (alope-
cia, hormone imbalances, pain), psychological factors (adopting
the “patient role”—asexual—, altered body image, fear of death,
rejection by partner), and social factors (communication difficul-
ties regarding sexuality) [48]. Some factors can be exacerbated in
the older patient, such as difficulty of speaking about sex, fear of
death, or reassignment of priorities. The treatment of sexual dys-
function in the older patient includes estrogen supplements, vag-
inal lubricants, change in antidepressants (SSRIs can delay or-
gasm), dilators in conjunction with Kegel exercises, a referral to

a sexual therapist, and couple-based interventions [48]. Esplen
[42] conducted an RCT to assess the efficacy of an 8-week group
for women after BC treatment. The manual-based intervention
combined two steps: expressive guided-imagery exercises inte-
grated within a model of group-therapy principles. This interven-
tion facilitates exploration of identity, the development of new
self-schemas, and personal growth. The intervention also included
an educational component on the social and cultural factors af-
fecting women’s self-esteem and BI. Patients in the intervention
group showed significantly less concern/distress about body ap-
pearance, decreased body stigma, and a lower level of BC-related
concerns, compared with women in the control group. BC-related
QoL was also better in the intervention group compared with the
control group at the 1-year follow-up. There was no statistically
significant difference in sexual functioning, indicating that more
studies are needed to improve sexual health in BC patients. A
review on BI in cancer [50] presented and patient-doctor commu-
nication found that BI difficulties were found across patients with
diverse cancers, and were most prevalent in the immediate post-
operative and treatment period. Age, body mass index, and spe-
cific cancer treatments have been identified as potential risk fac-
tors for body image disturbance in cancer patients. In addition,
specific interventions were described (Table 3). The authors also
proposed practical strategies for the oncologic health care team
when addressing BI concerns, which is referred to as The Three
C’s (common, concerns, consequences) [51]. This strategy en-
courages patients to discuss their BI concerns, thereby allowing
the health care team to identify emotional difficulties and to

viders should remind patients that BI difficulties are very common
to normalize their concerns and reduce shame, embarrassment,
and stigma. Then, providers, should ask about specific concerns
which may include impending treatment effects or recent or
prolonged changes to the appearance and/or functioning. This
step is accomplished with open-ended questions that elicit patient
narrative. Finally, therapists ask patients about consequences of
their BI difficulties on daily functioning, with particular attention
to social, emotional, and occupational problems. Regarding BI, a
recent study [52(cid:129)] investigated the effects of a brief beauty care
intervention on self-reported symptoms of depression, QoL, BI,
and self-esteem in 39 female BC patients with appearance-related
treatment side effects. The intervention consisted of a single-
session group makeup workshop with an incorporated portrait
and upper-body photo shooting. Photos were also professionally
edited and sent to the patients. While groups did not differ regard-
ing any measure at the pretreatment baseline assessment, patients
in the intervention group reported fewer symptoms of depression,
higher QoL, and higher self-esteem compared with baseline.
Follow-up at 8 weeks indicated moderate stability of these im-
provements, in contrast to previous research, indicating beneficial
short-term and mid-term effects of beauty care on psychological
outcomes in patients with early BC.

Conclusion

Elderly and young BC patients have similar psychological
problems related to trauma of diagnosis, side effects of thera-
pies with the consequent change of body image and sexual
behavior, fear of recurrence, and end of life. Many psycho-
therapeutic and supportive approaches have proven effective
in various patient groups. In order to ensure a successful psy-
chological approach in elderly patients, the most effective in-
terventions include:

–
Psychotherapy with a soft body mediation approach;
– Meditative and reconciliation interventions with one’s

–

–

own spiritual well-being and needs;
Soft cognitive rehabilitation interventions not too de-
manding for patients;
Interventions for the elaboration of the group trauma with
EMDR.
