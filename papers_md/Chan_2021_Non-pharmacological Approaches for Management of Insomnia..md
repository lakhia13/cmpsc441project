Abstract
Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem associated with a constellation of negative health-related outcomes and significant 
socioeconomic burden. It commonly co-occurs with psychiatric and medical conditions, which may further exacerbate these 
comorbid conditions and hinder treatment response. There is much empirical evidence to support the clinical efficacy of 
non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), in managing 
insomnia in a wide range of populations. This article reviews the research on the efficacy of CBT-I for primary insomnia 
and insomnia comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions, the empirical evidence regarding different CBT-I 
treatment modalities, the implementation of CBT-I across different age groups, and some initial evidence on the sequential 
combination of insomnia treatments. A brief overview of other non-pharmacological treatment with regard to complementary 
alternative medicine is also provided.

Introduction

Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem in the general popula-
tion and represents one of the most debilitating and costly 
public health concerns [1, 2]. Insomnia disorder can occur 
in any age group, with predominance in females emerging 
during adolescence [3, 4]. Although several psychological 
and neurophysiological models have been proposed to con-
ceptualize the development of insomnia, the etiology and 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. There are typically 
two major treatment options for insomnia, including non-
pharmacological  and  pharmacological  approaches.  This 
review will focus on the non-pharmacological approaches

for treating insomnia, especially on the evidence of cogni-
tive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in different 
age groups and clinical populations, as well as its various 
treatment modalities.

Overview of Insomnia

Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in 
sleep  initiation,  difficulty  in  sleep  maintenance  or  early 
morning awakening, occurring at least 3 times per week for 
at least three months, with significant personal distress, and 
daytime functional impairments (Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorder 5th edition, DSM-V). The 
prevalence of insomnia varies extensively across different 
studies, with a point prevalence ranging from 4% to 36% in 
adolescents [4–11], and 9–50% in adults [12–15], depending 
on the ethnicity, symptomatic timeframe (2 weeks, 1 month, 
or 3 months), and diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV vs. DSM-V). 
It is a chronic medical condition with persistence rates vary-
ing from 11% to 60% over 1-year interval [16–19], and 15% 
to 40% over 5-year follow-up [20, 21].

Insomnia is increasingly recognized as a major public 
health concern and is associated with a constellation of neg-
ative outcomes, including daytime functional impairments; 
a higher likelihood of physical and mental comorbidities,

such as depression, anxiety, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
and cardiovascular diseases; an increased risk for accidents 
and suicide; and impaired quality of life [14, 22–25]. It may 
result in substantial personal distress and burden not only 
for the affected individuals but also for their families and the 
society [2, 26, 27]. For example, it is estimated that annual 
cost related to insomnia was 63.2 billion due to the loss of 
productivity in the USA in the year of 2008 [2].

Etiology of Insomnia

The causes of insomnia are multifactorial. Extensive effort has 
been made to understand the etiology and pathophysiology 
of insomnia, and the majority of the models were formulated 
based upon several psychophysiological and behavioral con-
structs sharing a key component: “hyperarousal” [28]. The 
hyperarousal model of insomnia postulates that high arousal 
would alter individual’s cognitive, physiological, and psycho-
logical states, leading to disturbed sleep [28–30]. A recent 
complementary view suggests that individuals with persistent 
hyperarousal are more prone to the “instability of rapid eye 
movement (REM) sleep,” which results in sleep fragmenta-
tion and sleep complaints [31]. Among the psychological-
behavioral models that conceptualize the development and 
maintenance of insomnia, the Spielman’s “3-P” model is 
one of the widely cited frameworks. This model delineates 
the development of insomnia through the progression from 
acute to chronic insomnia as a result of three closely interac-
tive factors: predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating fac-
tors. Predisposing factors refer to the genetic, physiological, 
and psychological risk factors that may increase individual’s 
vulnerability to the onset of insomnia. Precipitating factors 
include the physiological, psychological, and environmental 
stressors that may trigger the acute onset of sleep disturbance. 
Perpetuating factors refer to the distorted cognitions about 
sleep and insomnia, and maladaptive behaviors that individu-
als with insomnia tend to adopt as a way to cope with their 
sleep problem, but often inadvertently exacerbate their sleep 
difficulty.

CBT‑I

Insomnia often runs a chronic course. However, pharmacologi-
cal treatments for sleep problems are generally recommended for 
short-term use [32, 33]. Due to the limitations of the drug treat-
ments, including potential dependence and tolerance under long-
term usage [34, 35], as well as the recognition of hyperarousal 
factors in the insomnia trajectory, non-pharmacological approach 
has received increasing attention in the past decade. In particular, 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has emerged as 
the most prominent non-pharmacological treatment approach and 

is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia 
in adults by American Academy of Sleep Medicine [36, 37] and 
American College of Physicians [38]. CBT-I is a multi-component 
treatment targeting behavioral, cognitive, and physiological factors 
that perpetuate insomnia and aims to modify and alter maladaptive 
behaviors and distorted beliefs about sleep and insomnia [39, 40]. 
It often comprises of four to eight weekly sessions (50–90 min) 
led by trained therapists covering the following topics: stimulus 
control, sleep restriction, relaxation techniques, cognitive therapy, 
and sleep hygiene education. CBT-I can be delivered in different 
formats, such as face-to-face individual or group therapy, guided 
or unguided digitally delivered self-help format.

There have been a proliferation of randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I in treating 
chronic insomnia in adults. Collective evidence emanated 
from multiple systematic and meta-analyses supported that 
CBT-I is an efficacious treatment in a wide range of popula-
tions with medium to large effect sizes [41–47]. Its effect on  
improving sleep is comparable to medication in a short-term 
but is more sustainable in a long run [48–50]. In general, 70  
to 80% of the participants with chronic insomnia were found  
to show an improvement of insomnia symptoms after the 
intervention, 50% achieved clinically meaningful outcomes  
(e.g., sleep latency less than 30 min, reduction of hypnotic  
use), and 30% became good sleepers [51]. The positive out- 
comes were evident in several self-reported sleep parame-
ters, particularly wakefulness-related variables, such as sleep  
onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO)  
[40]. For example, Trauer et al. analyzed 20 RCTs conducted  
in the adult population and estimated that the average reduc-
tion of SOL and WASO after treatment was about 19 min  
(95% CI, 14.1 to 23.9) and 26 min (95% CI, 15.5 to 36.5),  
respectively [46]. The improvement was able to maintain 
over a relatively long follow-up period (e.g., 24 months) 
[49]. Notably, total time in bed (TIB) was often shortened  
immediately after treatment due to the introduction of sleep  
restriction technique, which also contributed to the mild  
improvement in total sleep time (TST) throughout the treat-
ment period [38, 46], but the effect on sleep duration seemed  
to augment over time as individuals progressively increased  
their sleep efficiency (SE) [46]. A recent review conducted by 
van Straten and colleagues, comprising a large number of RCTs  
(N = 87) and a large sample size (N = 6303), also supported 
the effectiveness of CBT-I regardless of the comorbidity, 
age range, and concurrent use of sleep medications [45]. 
The improvements on SOL, WASO, and SE after CBT-I 
were more pronounced with moderate to large effect sizes 
when measured subjectively by using sleep diary [52]. It is  
noteworthy that objective sleep measurements were rarely 
included in the CBT-I trials. Few studies have incorporated 
either actigraphy or PSG measurement, and their sample  
sizes tend to be small. In addition, the results on the objec-
tive sleep improvements were mixed, with no evidence of 

34

improvement  in  polysomnography-based  parameters  but 
some  evidence  based  on  the  actigraphy  data,  showing  a  
small effect in reducing SOL and a moderate effect in reduc- 
ing  TST  [52].  Moreover,  the  positive  improvements 
in  sleep-related  variables  also  resulted  in  beneficial  
effects  on  daytime  symptoms  including  mood,  daytime 
sleepiness, fatigue, and overall quality of life with small to 
medium effect sizes, while physical functioning showed no 
significant improvement [53].

CBT‑I for Insomnia Comorbid 
with Psychiatric Disorders

Insomnia commonly co-occurs with a wide range of psychiat-
ric disorders, with the estimated prevalence rates of 80–90%  
in depression and anxiety, and 70% in post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) [54–57]. In the past, insomnia was tradi-
tionally conceptualized as a “symptom” or “secondary” to 
the psychiatric illnesses. However, multiple lines of evi-
dence have indicated an independent and distinct trajectory 
of insomnia in the context of psychiatric comorbidity. For 
example,  sleep  disturbance  does  not  necessarily  resolve 
along with the improvement of psychiatric problems and 
is commonly reported as a residual symptom in psychiatric 
patients who have been treated for their daytime depressive 
symptomatology [58]. Moreover, the presence of insomnia 
may interact with mood symptoms, exacerbate the comorbid 
psychiatric conditions, hinder the treatment response, and 
lead to an increased risk of relapse and recurrence of the 
psychiatric comorbidities [59–61]. The collective evidence 
therefore suggests the need to provide independent, target 
treatment for insomnia in the context of comorbid psychiatric 
conditions [62, 63].

Given the high comorbidity of insomnia and psychiatric 
disorders, as well as the potential impact of insomnia in the 
trajectory of mood problems, the dissemination of CBT-I in 
psychiatric population has received substantial interests in 
the past 20 years. The most commonly studied psychiatric 
comorbidities include depression, anxiety, PTSD, and alcohol 
or hypnotic dependence. The findings generally support the 
positive effects of CBT-I on improving insomnia symptoms, 
mood and functioning outcomes in comorbid psychiatric  
conditions [43, 64, 65].

Depression

Patients with depression who experience sleep disturbances 
often report more severe mood symptoms. Poor sleep often 
precedes  the  new  onset  or  recurrence  of  depression  and 
also  presents  as  a  common  residual  symptom  in  patients 
remitted from depression. For example, approximately 70% 
of  depressed  patients  continue  to  complain  about  sleep 

disturbances following the antidepressant treatment [56, 58]. 
The bidirectional and complex association between insomnia 
and mood problems underscores the need to specifically tackle 
sleep problem in comorbid insomnia and depression. Manber 
et al. conducted two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to 
evaluate the effects of CBT-I in addition to conventional anti-
depressant medication in depressed patients [66, 67]. Their 
studies showed that CBT-I as an adjunct treatment to antide-
pressant was superior to antidepressant plus control therapy in 
reducing insomnia severity while achieving a comparable rate 
of remission of depression [67]. Similar results on the clini-
cally added benefits of CBT-I were also reported when using 
the abbreviated version of CBT-I (two sessions) [68]. The 
brief CBT-I plus treatment as usual (TAU) was found to result 
in a reduction of insomnia symptoms and improved SE, and 
depressive symptoms as compared to TAU alone in patients 
with residual depression and refractory insomnia [68]. Further-
more, it is also encouraging to note that CBT-I was found to 
reduce depressive symptoms with an effect size (moderate to 
large) comparable to that of depression-specific psychological 
treatment [69]. Taken together, the existing evidence collec-
tively suggests that CBT-I is beneficial for patients with major 
depressive disorder in both sleep and mood aspects.

Anxiety

Similar  to  depression,  anxiety  is  often  associated  with 
insomnia. Their close association is likely related to the 
shared underlying mechanisms [59]. In particular, anxiety-
related cognitive processes may maintain insomnia. For 
example, excessive worries about sleep could activate and 
trigger emotional or physiological arousals, resulting in 
sleeplessness [70]. The sleeplessness could reciprocally gen-
erate a higher level of worries and anxiety. Indeed, patients 
with insomnia not only worry about their overall sleep prob-
lems but also have a generally higher anxiety level.

Despite the interplay between insomnia and anxiety, it is 
surprising to note that there have been limited studies to inves-
tigate the effect of CBT-I with a specific focus on insomnia 
comorbid with anxiety disorders. A meta-analytic review of 
72 studies with anxiety-related measures showed that CBT-I 
has a moderate effect on improving anxiety (Hedges’g = 0.41) 
[71]. The impact was similar among patients with anxiety 
problems (e.g., a high level of trait anxiety, excessive pre-
sleep cognitive arousal) (Hedges’g = 0.47) and those with 
subclinical anxiety symptoms (Hedges’g = 0.40) [71]. How-
ever, when additionally combining anxiety treatment into 
CBT-I, such a combination strategy was not found to further 
improve anxiety symptoms or enhance treatment outcomes 
of insomnia [71, 72]. It might be possible that some of the 
techniques in CBT-I designed to reduce arousal (e.g., relaxa-
tion and constructive worry techniques) already have some 
therapeutic effects on anxiety. Nonetheless, there have been

only a handful of RCTs exclusively focusing on individuals 
with comorbid insomnia and anxiety disorders, which limited 
the generalizability of CBT-I to this clinical population.

Post‑traumatic Stress Disorder

limited by a high attrition rate (~ 40%) [82, 83] and a small 
sample size (ranging from 17 to 60). As such, there is a need 
for more research to confirm the effectiveness of CBT-I in 
patients with substance use disorders [84].

Insomnia is often implicated in the development of PTSD 
and also represents a ubiquitous and chronic symptom 
associated with this specific psychiatric disorder. Sleep 
disturbance before the traumatic event may increase the 
likelihood of the development of PTSD, while the occur-
rence  of  PTSD  could  exacerbate  sleep  problems  [73], 
highlighting the important role of sleep disturbance in 
the clinical course of PTSD. In a recent meta-analysis 
on the effect of sleep intervention in PTSD patients, 5 
out of 11 studies implemented CBT-I as the core treat-
ment component [74] and showed a significant reduc-
tion  of  self-reported  insomnia  (Hedges’g  =  1.15), 
PTSD  (Hedges’g  =  0.58)  and  depressive  symptoms 
(Hedges’g = 0.44). For example, Talbot et al. evaluated 
the  efficacy  of  CBT-I  compared  to  waiting-list  group 
in patients with comorbid insomnia and PTSD. While 
PTSD symptoms were found to improve in both arms, 
CBT-I group showed additional improvement in sleep as 
evidenced by higher SE and a higher remission rate of 
insomnia (41% vs. 0%) [75]. When CBT-I was combined 
with imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), a technique specifi-
cally targeting nightmares, other than the beneficial effect 
on sleep, 50% of the patients from the sleep treatment 
group achieved a remission of PTSD compared to 0% in 
the TAU group [76]. This implies the importance of spe-
cifically addressing sleep problems including insomnia 
and nightmares among PTSD patients.

Alcohol Dependence

Patients with alcohol dependence (AD) report a wide range 
of sleep-related disturbances, particularly insomnia. It is 
estimated that 36% to 91% of AD patients experience sleep 
disturbances during both active use and withdrawal stages 
[55, 77–79]. Although alcohol can produce an initial effect 
on facilitating sleep onset, it significantly disrupts sleep 
continuity with increased wakefulness. The development of 
tolerance related to excessive and prolonged use of alcohol  
further  increases  sleep  latency  and  sleep  fragmentation  
[80]. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with a higher 
likelihood of subsequent relapse of AD. Previous research 
conducted in individuals recovering from AD has shown 
that CBT-I led to considerable improvements in sleep onset 
latency, insomnia symptoms, and sleep hygiene practice, but 
there were no significant differences in the relapse rate and 
the number of days abstinent from alcohol between CBT-I 
and control groups [81–83]. However, these studies were 

CBT‑I for Insomnia Comorbid with Medical 
Conditions

The estimated prevalence of insomnia varies from 41% 
to 67% among patients with comorbid medical condition, 
such as heart disease, chronic pain, cancer, and hyperten-
sion [25, 85]. The presence of sleep disturbance in the 
context  of  medical  comorbidities  might  arise  directly 
from the pathophysiology of the medical disease itself, 
or as a result from the substantial emotional and physi-
cal burden related to the illnesses or the side effect of the 
medications. The potential additional burden of comorbid 
insomnia on the medical condition may lead to decreased 
quality of life, impaired immune function, and more severe 
symptomatology [64, 86]. In particular, cancer and chronic 
pain are the two medical problems that have received rela-
tively greater attention.

Cancer

A substantial percentage (50–60%) of cancer patients report 
insomnia [87], which is not surprising due to the significant 
distress and burden associated with this potentially fatal con- 
dition. The association between insomnia and cancer may be  
complex and multifactorial. It is hypothesized that biological  
(e.g.,  inflammation,  circadian  disruption)  and  psychologi-
cal (e.g., depression and anxiety) factors as well as the side  
effects  of  the  cancer  treatments  (e.g.,  pain,  fatigue)  could 
all  contribute  to  the  high  prevalence  of  insomnia  in  can-
cer patients [87, 88]. In addition, the presence of insomnia  
could further reduce quality of life, increase fatigue, impair  
immune system, and also lower the survival rate in cancer  
patients [89]. A recent meta-analysis examining the effects  
of CBT-I specifically in cancer patients revealed small-to- 
medium effect in improving SOL (d = 0.43), SE (d = 0.53),  
and WASO (d = 0.41) as measured by sleep diary and large  
effect in reducing self-report insomnia symptoms (d = 0.77)  
[90]. The positive sleep changes were found to maintain at 6- 
month follow up. These positive changes were similarly observed  
across different treatment modalities (group, individual, and 
internet), intervention duration (varying from five to eight  
sessions), and stage of illness/cancer treatment [90]. There  
is  also  concomitant  improvement  in  functional  outcomes  
following  insomnia  treatment,  such  as  improved  quality  
of  life,  cancer-related  fatigue,  and  mood  symptoms  [91]. 
There is some preliminary promising evidence suggesting  

36

N. Y. Chan et al.

that psychotherapy may extend the survival time of cancer 
patients [92]. There is a need for further research to examine 
the long-term outcomes of CBT-I in cancer patients.

Chronic Pain

Chronic pain can be caused by numerous medical problems, 
such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and spondylosis. There is 
evidence suggesting that people with chronic pain are 18 
times more likely to have insomnia [93]. About 53–90% of 
people with chronic pain report insomnia problems [93–96]. 
Disturbed sleep could provoke pro-inflammatory responses, 
enhance pain experience, reduce pain tolerance, and exacer-
bate somatic symptoms [97–99]. Traditional pharmacologi-
cal treatment for chronic pain only offers a modest reduction 
in pain, and sleep disturbance remains as one of the most 
distressing symptoms following the active pain treatment 
[100, 101]. Insomnia in the context of chronic pain is often 
under-diagnosed and under-treated. A recent meta-analysis 
evaluating the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment 
of insomnia for patients with chronic pain has identified 
9 RCTs incorporating CBT-I as the core treatment com-
ponent.  Consistent  with  the  previous  research  on  other 
comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions, the findings in 
general favored CBT-I with medium to large effect sizes 
(d = 0.78, 95% C.I. 0.42 to 1.13) in improving sleep quality, 
and the positive sleep gains were able to maintain for up to 
12 months [102]. A modest pain reduction (d = 0.18, 95% 
C.I. 0–0.36) and moderate fatigue reduction (d = 0.38, 95% 
C.I.: 0.08 to 0.69) were also noted in the short-term [102].

Special Considerations of CBT‑I in Comorbid 
Psychiatric and Medical Conditions

Patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical condi-
tions may require specific clinical attention due to the 
complex interplay between the illnesses. The refinement  
and adaptation of CBT-I in the context of specific comor-
bid illnesses may maximize the treatment effect and opti-
mize the concomitant improvement related to the comor-
bid conditions. However, the majority of the previous  
studies on CBT-I in comorbid conditions did not report 
any specific modification of the treatment content con-
cerning the special needs of each disorder. For example, a  
relatively low compliance and a high dropout rate are often  
observed in non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia  
in  patients  with  comorbidities  [82].  Another  example 
is  the  obstacles  of  implementing  CBT-I  in  depressed 
patients, who might have difficulties in complying with 
some of the behavioral strategies, such as sleep restric-
tion technique due to anhedonia, a lack of motivation,  
and low energy [103]. Moreover, previous evidence also 

indicated that insomnia patients with one or more comor-
bid psychiatric and medical conditions are less likely to  
respond to CBT-I treatment and are often unable to complete  
the treatment [64, 72, 86]. Therefore, further refinement 
and modification of CBT-I, such as adding motivation 
enhancement component or disease-specific management 
strategies, may be needed in order to enhance the treat-
ment outcomes.

CBT‑I Across Different Age Groups 
and Insomnia Subtypes

Insomnia is a prevalent health-related problem across the 
lifespan. While the majority of the previous research focused 
on CBT-I in middle aged adults, there has been emerging 
evidence suggesting the promising effect of CBT-I in other 
age groups, such as youth and older adults.

CBT‑I in Youth

Adolescence is a critical developmental period associated 
with substantial psychological and physiological changes. 
There is a parallel increase of the risk of developing sleep 
problems, with 3.6-fold and 2.1-fold increase of the preva-
lence of insomnia in adolescent girls and boys, respectively 
[4]. Although there have been a limited number of CBT-I 
trials  conducted  in  the  youth  population,  the  available  
data consistently supported the positive effects of CBT-I  
in improving both objectively and subjectively measured  
SOL (objective: 16.2 min, subjective: 21.4 min) and SE  
(objective: 2.8%, subjective: 5.3%) regardless of the format  
of the treatment (e.g., digitally delivered, group-based).  
Interestingly,  subjective  TST  was  also  found  to  be  
improved in adolescents following the CBT-I treatment, 
and such an effect was not often seen in adults [104]. It 
might be possible that youths are more severely affected 
by sleep deprivation than adults, and the restoration of 
normal sleep following CBT-I treatment may enable them 
to acquire longer sleep. Additionally, the sleep restriction 
component was often not emphasized in the CBT-I inter-
vention among youths given that sleep restriction is already 
“imposed” on adolescents during weekdays, particularly 
due to early school start time [105, 106]. The existing stud-
ies suggest that sleep-related improvement in youths was 
associated with the concurrent positive changes in daytime 
sleepiness, as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms 
[104], implying that CBT-I could be a promising approach 
to address sleep problems and improve mood symptoms 
and daytime functioning in adolescents.

CBT‑I in Older Adults

CBT‑I Across Different Cultures

Older population is another vulnerable group who often 
reports persistent insomnia, possibly due to the changes in 
sleep architecture with aging effect and a relatively high 
rate of comorbidities [107]. Approximately 30–40% of 
adults aged above 65 years old complain of sleep distur-
bance [108]. Special considerations might be needed in 
the implementation of CBT-I strategies in the elderly as 
there are often high comorbidities of psychiatric, medical, 
and other sleep disorders. Cognitive decline might also 
be a factor that warrants an adaptation of the standard 
CBT-I  intervention.  Among  the  few  available  studies, 
Morin et al. conducted the initial trial testing the effi-
cacy of CBT-I compared with pharmacotherapy (temaz-
epam) for late life (mean age: 65 years) insomnia [49]. 
This study demonstrated that CBT-I delivered in a group 
format produced similar effects as pharmacological treat-
ment in a short term and the sleep improvements were 
able to sustain in favoring the CBT-I group over a long-
term follow-up [49]. The short- and long-term efficacy of 
CBT-I was also demonstrated in Sivertsen et al.’s study, 
which  compared  the  effectiveness  of  individual  based 
CBT-I with pharmacological treatment (zopiclone) [50]. 
A recent study has shown some promising evidence that 
CBT-I improved not only sleep but also depressive symp-
toms in older adults [109].

CBT‑I Across Different Insomnia Subtypes

The variable responses towards CBT-I might be partly explained 
by the heterogeneity of insomnia [110, 111]. A recent study has 
identified at least 5 stable insomnia subtypes; some of which are 
more prone to mood problems [112]. It is unclear whether treat-
ment response to CBT-I differs among these various insomnia 
subtypes, but there has been some evidence suggesting blunted 
response to CBT-I in insomnia patients with objective short 
sleep duration (< 6 h) [111], which is considered as the most 
biologically severe phenotype of insomnia [113]. Nonetheless, it 
remains inconclusive as some studies did not show any difference 
in treatment response to CBT-I between those with short and nor-
mal sleep duration in adults [114] and elderly [115] with insom-
nia. The limited application of objective measurements including 
both actigraphy and polysomnography in CBT-I studies might 
explain the paucity of data in this area, and further research is 
needed to investigate the potential differences between insom-
nia subtypes in response to CBT-I treatment, so as to provide 
evidence for future development of phenotype-specific insomnia 
treatment.

Cultural factors might influence people’s attitudes and 
beliefs about sleep, which in turn translate to culturally 
specific sleep behaviors. For example, an hour-long nap 
during noon (siesta) is a tradition in Oriental and Medi-
terranean cultures, such as China, Italy, and Spain. In 
addition, shorter nocturnal sleep duration, which is pri-
marily driven by late bedtime, is often seen in East Asian 
compared to Oceanian counterparts, with Hong Kong 
having the latest bedtime [116, 117]. Given the potential 
contribution of cultural factors in one’s behaviors, it has 
been generally suggested that cultural differences should 
be addressed during psychotherapy so as to provide cul-
turally specific treatment content and strategies to the 
patients. Although CBT-I has been tested in different 
countries, only a few studies specifically mentioned the 
considerations of cultural factors in the treatment. For 
example, Birling et al. has developed a mixed protocol 
of individual and group formats of CBT-I, and cultur-
ally attuned relaxation and cognitive components (e.g., 
necessity to sleep at noon) [118]. Although this cultur-
ally adapted CBT-I program produced positive changes 
in diary-measured SOL, WASO, and TST, the study was 
limited by a lack of the control group. Nonetheless, pre-
vious research showed that the treatment outcomes of 
CBT-I were generally promising across different coun-
tries [46], with a significant improvement of sleep, albeit 
that cultural-specific factors were rarely addressed or 
mentioned. The necessity of having culturally adapted 
CBT-I has not been widely researched as compared to 
other CBT interventions. Given the vital role of cultural 
consideration in practice [119], future studies are needed 
to explore what constitute the effective cultural adaptions 
and the basis for these adaptions in delivering CBT-I.

CBT‑I in Different Formats

CBT-I is conventionally delivered face-to-face by trained 
therapists on an individual basis. However, this mode of 
treatment delivery is labor-intensive and has limited the 
availability and dissemination of CBT-I at a large scale. 
It is also the major reason that CBT-I is still not widely 
adopted in the clinical practice despite its strong empiri-
cal evidence. Thus, alternative forms of CBT-I have been 
developed to overcome the limitations and increase the 
accessibility  and  feasibility  of  the  treatment  in  recent 
years. There is emerging evidence showing that telemedi-
cine delivery of CBT-I is another alternative option that 
is not inferior to traditional face-to-face modality [120].

N. Y. Chan et al.

These alternative modalities, which mainly involve the 
delivery of CBT-I via website or mobile app [121–123], 
are constructed in a structured, content-specific, and even 
interactive way with either guided, automated feedback, or 
no-support mode [124, 125]. Previous studies showed that 
up to 80% of the participants completed the digital CBT-I, 
indicating an acceptable adherence to the self-help format 
[126]. Other approaches of delivering CBT-I include book-
lets [127], emails [128], videotapes [129], and telephone 
consultations [130]. Although some studies indicated a 
superior effect of face-to-face treatment to other alternative 
modalities (e.g., internet-delivered) [131], growing evi-
dence suggests comparative efficacy of different treatment 
modalities in improving sleep, with small-to-large effect on 
sleep quality (d = 0.41), SE (d = 0.40), WASO (d = 0.55), 
and SOL (d = 0.86) [132]. Due to its comparative efficacy 
with traditional format (e.g., delivered face-to-face), digital 
CBT-I has been suggested as the entry step (low intensity) 
treatment in a stepped-care model, an approach proposed 
as a solution to address the high demand of insomnia treat-
ment services [126, 133].

Apart from different modalities, brief behavioral treat-
ment for insomnia (BBTI) or single component of CBT-I 
(e.g., Sleep Restriction Therapy, SRT, or Stimulus Con-
trol Therapy, SCT) represents another approach to make 
the intervention more practical in the clinical setting [134, 
135]. These alternative forms were developed to be shorter 
in treatment duration (e.g., two face-to-face sessions fol-
lowed by two follow-up phone calls), behaviorally focused, 
and easily deliverable by healthcare professionals even with 
minimal prior sleep training [134]. A recent review evaluat-
ing the effectiveness of BBTI in the patients with insomnia 
demonstrated that the brief version of CBT-I led to sleep 
improvements as measured by sleep diary (i.e., reduced 
SOL and WASO, increased SE). There was also some ini-
tial evidence showing that BBTI resulted in sustained sleep 
improvements at 6-month follow-up [134]. However, the evi-
dence was limited to the older population with modest sam-
ple size. To maximize its practical values in clinical practice, 
the implementation of BBTI should be further studied in 
other age groups and the clinical populations with comor-
bidities [134].

Combination and Sequential Treatment 
for Insomnia

Despite the promising evidence of CBT-I in treating insomnia, 
20–30% of the patients did not respond [51, 136]. A com-
bination of drug and psychological interventions have been 
proposed to maximize therapeutic gains, especially among 
difficult and resistant cases [137–139]. For example, insom-
nia patients who received both CBT-I and sleep medication 

have reported added value in sleep improvement (i.e., longer 
sleep duration) during the active treatment period [139], 
which was not often observed when only CBT-I treatment 
was prescribed. This initial combined treatment group when 
continuously being provided with CBT-I showed better sus-
tained outcome than those who subsequently received medi-
cation or a combination of both treatments [139]. However, 
it remains unclear which approach serves the best first-stage 
intervention given that both CBT-I and drug treatment pro-
duce equivalent short-term benefits. A recently published 
trial has demonstrated that after the provision of behavioral 
therapy or zolpidem as the initial treatment option, sequen-
tially adding cognitive therapy or trazodone could maximize 
the treatment outcomes for those who did not remit with the 
first-stage therapy [138]. The differential effects of various 
treatment sequences suggest the need to further evaluate the 
best treatment algorithms for patients with insomnia disor-
der. In addition, prescribing treatments that match individ-
ual patients’ characteristics, with the consideration of one’s 
comorbid conditions, disease severity, and patient’s own pref-
erence, might be a promising personalized medicine approach 
that merits further research in the management of insomnia.

Other Non‑pharmacological Approaches 
for Insomnia

Apart from CBT-I, there has been growing, albeit limited, 
research  on  complementary  and  alternative  medicines 
(CAM) as a treatment for insomnia, such as mindfulness 
meditation, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Tai Chi, 
acupuncture, and acupressure. Indeed, CAM is the most 
preferred therapeutic approach selected by patients with 
insomnia, especially in Asian regions [140]. Among these 
strategies,  mindfulness  meditation  has  become  another 
promising approach to treat insomnia in the past decade. 
Recently, the positive effects of mindfulness meditation on 
insomnia have been shown in two meta-analyses of RCTs 
[141, 142]. For example, Gong et al. found that mindful-
ness meditation significantly decreased total wake time 
(d = − 0.44.) and improved sleep quality (d = 0.68) at 
post-treatment when compared with placebo or other treat-
ments [141]. However, the results on the long-term efficacy 
of mindfulness mediation on insomnia were inconsistent 
[143–145].  For  example,  Wong  et  al.  demonstrated  the 
short-term benefits of mindfulness-based cognitive ther-
apy (MBCT-I) on sleep in adults with chronic insomnia, 
but MBCT-I did not result in superior long-term treatment 
effects (at 8-month follow up) when compared to sleep edu-
cation with exercise group [145]. In contrast, Ong et al.’s 
study demonstrated a long-lasting effect of mindfulness 
mediation in reducing insomnia symptoms. However, the 
study might be limited by a lack of adequate active control

arm [144]. These contradictory findings indicate the need 
for further research on the effects of mindfulness meditation 
for insomnia with more rigorous study design, larger sample 
size, and longer-term follow up.

The herbal medications include both TCM and west-
ern  herbs.  There  is  some  positive  evidence  supporting 
herbal treatment in relieving insomnia symptoms, both as 
monotherapy and adjunctive treatment [146, 147]. How-
ever, the specific effect of TCM for insomnia has not yet 
been determined owing to the heterogeneity in dosages 
and  compositions  of  herbal  medicine  [148].  Similarly, 
although several reviews reported the positive effects of 
acupuncture and acupressure in improving sleep quality 
in insomnia patients, the existing studies are limited by 
poor study quality, small sample size, and heterogeneous 
methodology [149, 150]. In addition, Tai Chi, a low inten-
sity exercise with the inclusion of meditation component, 
remains as another area of active research, particularly 
among older adults. There has been some initial evidence 
suggesting the positive effect of various forms of Tai Chi 
in improving sleep quality [151]. A recent study reported 
that Tai Chi has comparable effect to CBT-I in breast can-
cer survivors [152]. However, such a comparative effect 
was not observed among elderly with chronic and primary 
insomnia [153].

Conclusion

In  summary,  CBT-I  is  the  most  widely  studied  non-
pharmacological  treatment  for  insomnia,  with  strong 
evidence supporting its efficacy across different popu-
lations, including those with insomnia comorbid with 
psychiatric or medical problems. Different formats of 
CBT-I were found to produce significant sleep improve-
ments across different age groups and clinical popula-
tions. There is also promising evidence regarding the 
concomitant improvement in functional outcomes, espe-
cially in the context of depression, anxiety, and pain, 
indicating that CBT-I could be an effective adjunctive 
treatment  for  patients  with  psychiatric  and  medical 
comorbidities. Additional research effort is warranted 
to further investigate the treatment mechanisms, the effi-
cacy of different sequential treatment approaches when 
combining medication and CBT-I, and the algorithms of 
personalizing insomnia treatment that aim to maximize 
the long-term treatment gains, as well as the efficacy of 
alternative non-pharmacological interventions such as 
mindfulness adaptation and Tai Chi (Table 1) .
