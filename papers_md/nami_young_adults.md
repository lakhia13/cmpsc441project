### The changes and decisions that often define this period of life can feel challenging, stressful, and overwhelming for everyone.


This is also the time when many people start experiencing mental health symptoms, as most mental health conditions present by age 25 or earlier.1

It can be complicated to determine if what you are experiencing is a mental health condition beyond the typical stress or challenges of growing into adulthood. There are no blood tests or x-rays that can diagnose mental health conditions, and many indicators or symptoms of conditions overlap. For example, difficulty concentrating can be the result of a minor inconvenience or indicative of a more serious issue.

This lack of clarity can lead to delays in identifying symptoms of mental health conditions and deciding on the best course of care and support.

If you start to experience mental health symptoms that are affecting your everyday life, it is essential to seek help as soon as you can. There are many forms of support and care. The first step is gaining a better understanding of what you are experiencing in order to find the right treatment for you.
