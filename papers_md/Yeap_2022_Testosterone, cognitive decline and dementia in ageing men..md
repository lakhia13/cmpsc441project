Abstract
As men grow older, circulating testosterone concentrations decline, while prevalence of cognitive impairment and demen-
tia increase. Epidemiological studies of middle-aged and older men have demonstrated associations of lower testosterone 
concentrations with higher prevalence and incidence of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. 
In observational studies, men with prostate cancer treated by androgen deprivation therapy had a higher risk of demen-
tia. Small intervention studies of testosterone using different measures of cognitive function have provided inconsistent 
results, with some suggesting improvement. A randomised placebo-controlled trial of one year’s testosterone treatment 
conducted in 788 men aged ≥ 65 years, baseline testosterone < 9.54 nmol/L, showed an improvement in sexual function, 
but no improvement in cognitive function. There is a known association between diabetes and dementia risk. A randomised 
placebo-controlled trial of two year’s testosterone treatment in 1,007 men aged 50–74 years, waist circumference ≥ 95 cm, 
baseline testosterone ≤ 14 nmol/L, showed an effect of testosterone in reducing type 2 diabetes risk. There were no cogni-
tive endpoints in that trial. Additional research is warranted but at this stage lower testosterone concentrations in ageing 
men should be regarded as a biomarker rather than a proven therapeutic target for risk reduction of cognitive decline and 
dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease.

1   Testosterone and male ageing

As men grow older, circulating total testosterone concen-
trations  generally  decline  while  medical  comorbidities 
become more prevalent [1–6]. By contrast, concentrations 
of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the principal 
carrier protein in the circulation for testosterone and other 
sex steroids, increase with age [2, 4–6]. In predominantly

middle-aged men, the reduction in total testosterone concen-
trations largely reflects the impact of obesity and ill-health 
to reduce activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary–testicular 
(HPT) axis [3, 4]. This is supported by the finding that in 
a cohort of healthy men aged 40–69 years, total testoster-
one concentrations were stable over time, although SHBG 
increased and cFT declined [5]. However, in older men, 
total testosterone concentrations decline in parallel with 
increases in luteinising hormone (LH) concentrations, indi-
cating progressive impairment of Leydig cell function [6, 7]. 
Free testosterone, the fraction in the circulation not bound 
to either SHBG or albumin, is commonly calculated from 
total testosterone and SHBG [8, 9]. Longitudinal declines in 
calculated free testosterone (cFT) tend to be steeper than the 
corresponding changes in total testosterone, reflecting the 
age-related increase in SHBG [2, 4, 5]. Lower testosterone 
concentrations in ageing men are associated with a range of 
poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular events and 
mortality [10, 11]. A comparable association with dementia 
risk has been postulated but remains under debate [12–16]. 
If a causal relationship can be proven, then there may be 
scope for testosterone to be employed as a preventive or 
therapeutic intervention.

2   Cognitive decline, dementia 
and Alzheimer’s disease

The  convergence  of  declining  circulating  testosterone, 
impairment of cognitive function and increasing diagnoses 
of dementia, in ageing men, is of interest for a number of 
reasons. Due to increases in life expectancy in the twentieth 
century, population structures are maturing world-wide, and 
increasing proportions of adults in the community will be 
older [17]. Age is a strong but irreversible risk factor for 
cognitive decline and incidence of dementia, albeit these are 
not inevitable consequences of ageing [18]. Deterioration in 
cognitive function can affect multiple domains of memory, 
thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning 
capacity, language, and judgement. This may be associated 
with changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or 
motivation, and impact on social functioning and self-care 
[18]. Risk factors include less education, smoking, obesity, 
excessive  alcohol  consumption,  traumatic  brain  injury, 
hypertension, hearing impairment, depression, air pollution, 
physical inactivity, diabetes, and low social contact, and pre-
ventive strategies are now advocated [19, 20]. Even so, there 
are 50 million people living with dementia worldwide, with 
nearly 10 million new cases each year [19]. Dementia due 
to Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia, 
accounting for 60–70% of cases [18]. This form of dementia 
is characterised by insidious onset with memory impairment 
being the initial complaint. Some studies have found a higher 

prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in women, generating 
interest in the possible role of sex hormones to modulate 
this risk [21, 22]. Population based surveys of people who 
have been carefully examined with cognitive testing prior to 
death have clearly demonstrated that the most common neu-
ropathological changes found in dementia due to Alzheimer 
disease are mixed pathologies, commonly a combination of 
Alzheimer neuropathology, vascular pathology, age-related 
TAR DNA binding protein TDP-43 encephalopathy and 
Lewy body pathology [23, 24]. Recent observations sug-
gest even more pathological mechanisms underly common 
clinical types of dementia including glial fibrillary acidic 
protein which is associated with presence of β-amyloid, and 
phosphorylated tau 231 protein [25–28]. Alzheimer pathol-
ogy involves extra-neuronal deposition of β-amyloid plaque 
and intra-neuronal development of neurofibrillary tangles of 
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins within the central nerv-
ous system [24]. Biomarkers of early disease include plasma 
neurofilament light chain that has also been associated with 
neurodegeneration from several causes, including in the 
setting of Alzheimer disease [29, 30]. Treatments aimed at 
improving neurocognitive function or slowing its decline 
generally have shown limited efficacy [24, 31, 32]. Recently, 
considerable attention has been given to interventions which 
reduce accumulation of β-amyloid, however, clinical benefits 
have not been conclusively demonstrated [31, 32]. It is pos-
sible that hormonal treatments that target two or more of 
these pathologies may have a specific role in preventing the 
common age-associated dementia. Thus the possibility that 
lower testosterone exposure may be involved in the patho-
physiology of dementia due to Alzheimer disease is of inter-
est, as interventions to increase testosterone concentrations 
in men are readily available [33–35].

3   Mechanistic studies of testosterone, 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease

Experimental studies suggest a role for sex steroids to influ-
ence the accumulation of β-amyloid and also to modulate 
neuronal responses to injury [36]. In murine neuroblastoma 
and  primary  neuronal  cultures,  and  in  rat  hypothalamic 
cells, treatment with testosterone increased cleavage of the 
β-amyloid precursor protein to enhance secretion of non-
amyloidogenic fragments [37, 38]. In experiments in rat hip-
pocampal neurones, testosterone and estradiol had differen-
tial effects on cleavage of tau proteins, and testosterone was 
more effective in preventing β-amyloid-induced cell death 
[39–41]. In a transgenic mouse model overexpressing amy-
loid precursor protein, downregulating aromatase expression 
increased testosterone and reduced estradiol concentrations, 
and reduced plaque formation within the brain, inferring a 
role for testosterone rather than estradiol to protect against 

1 3Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (2022) 23:1243–1257

1245

Alzheimer’s disease [42]. However, other studies report a 
role for estrogens and progesterone to protect cultured rat 
hippocampal neurones against glutamate toxicity [43]. Estra-
diol (and also estrone and estriol) also appeared to inhibit 
β-amyloid formation in vitro [44].

Of note, in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, treatment of gonadectomised mice with testosterone 
prevented the increase in β-amyloid in the subiculum, hip-
pocampus and amygdala, seen in gonadectomised, vehicle-
treated mice [45]. In that study dihydrotestosterone had a 
similar effect, while estradiol prevented β-amyloid accumu-
lation in the hippocampus but only had partial effects in 
the other two regions. Therefore, inhibition of β-amyloid 
accumulation may involve both androgen- and estrogen-
mediated effects within the brain. In a further report, tes-
tosterone  treatment  in  gonadectomised  transgenic  mice 
reduced β-amyloid accumulation and improved performance 
in a hippocampal-dependent task of working memory and 
attention [46]. Testosterone depletion has also been reported 
to increase susceptibility to oxidative brain damage in mice 
[47]. Testosterone and androgen receptor signalling have 
also been implicated in synaptic formation and plasticity, 
in the pre-frontal cortex and other areas [48, 49]. However, 
a study of middle-aged and older rats given a high-fat diet 
reported relatively subtle effects of testosterone treatment 
over 12 weeks to prevent diet-induced increases in micro-
glial  and  astroglial  reactivity,  with  equivocal  effects  on 
behavioural outcomes [50]. This illustrates the difficulty of 
translating results from mechanistic studies based on reduc-
ing β-amyloid accumulation to studies demonstrating more 
clinically-oriented outcomes. The observation that vascular 
pathology contributes nearly as much to the overall burden 
of dementia as Alzheimer pathology [23] and the known 
association of testosterone with vascular risk [10] highlights 
the potential importance of multimodal effects on overall 
risk of dementia.

4   Observational studies of testosterone, 

cognitive decline and dementia

4.1   Studies with surrogate endpoints

In  a  longitudinal  study  of  514  pairs  of  twin  men  aged 
63 years at baseline and followed for 10 and 16 years, sex 
hormones were not associated with measures of cognitive 
function [51]. However, in that study higher baseline tes-
tosterone concentrations were associated with larger hemi-
sphere, frontal lobe and parietal lobe volumes, and smaller 
left (but not right) occipital lobe volumes, after adjusting 
for SHBG concentrations. In a smaller study of 40 men 
aged 57 years at baseline, a higher ratio of testosterone to 
SHBG and higher total testosterone concentrations measured 

over 14 years, were associated with higher regional cerebral 
blood flow assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) 
[52]. This finding extends an earlier uncontrolled study of 
seven men aged 58–72 years with sexual symptoms and 
low cFT concentrations given testosterone treatment, which 
showed enhanced cerebral perfusion in midbrain and supe-
rior frontal gyrus at 3–5 weeks of treatment, and in midbrain 
and midcingulate gyrus at 12–14 weeks [53]. A post-mortem 
study found that in men aged 60–79 years, brain testosterone 
concentrations were lower in men with mild neuropathology 
or Alzheimer’s disease (N = 7 and N = 22 respectively), com-
pared with neuropathologically normal men (N = 7) [54]. In 
a study of 118 men who underwent Pittsburgh compound B 
(PiB)-PET scanning for detection of brain β-amyloid, cFT 
was not associated with PiB retention [55]. In that study, 
only in a subset of 24 men with mild cognitive impairment 
was there an inverse association of cFT with PiB retention. 
A recent study of 133 men aged 72 years, found that cFT 
concentration was not associated with presence of cerebral 
β-amyloid measured using PiB PET-magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), but was associated with hippocampal vol-
ume [56]. Thus higher testosterone exposures may be related 
to more favourable indices of brain volume and regional 
perfusion, but limited data are available with regards to 
associations of sex hormones with Alzheimer pathology. 
The possible implication may be that testosterone might 
have beneficial effects on the brain through non-Alzheimer 
pathology-related mechanisms. These contrasting results 
reflect differences between imaging modalities, and need 
to consider the inherent limitations of extrapolating results 
from surrogate measures to longer term clinical outcomes.

4.2   Prospective cohort studies

Longitudinal studies of sex hormones with the outcomes 
of cognitive decline or incident dementia in middle-aged 
to older men are summarised (Table 1). In the Baltimore 
Longitudinal Study of Aging, men with a higher ratio of 
testosterone  to  SHBG  at  baseline  performed  better  on 
tests of cognitive function, and were less likely to develop 
Alzheimer’s disease, during extended follow-up (10 and 
19 years respectively) [57, 58]. However, in the Honolulu-
Asia Asia Study, in which 134 men developed Alzheimer’s 
disease over a 6-year follow-up, higher baseline estradiol 
was associated with increased risk, while baseline tes-
tosterone  was  not  associated  [59].  In  the  Osteoporotic 
Fractures In Men Study neither baseline cFT nor baseline 
calculated free estradiol were associated with changes in 
cognitive function over 4.5 years [61]. In smaller studies 
with shorter durations of follow-up, one study found that 
neither cFT nor estradiol concentrations were associated 
with dementia risk in men [60], in another higher bio-
available (non-SHBG bound) testosterone concentrations

with higher risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio 1.14 per 1 SD decrease), 
as was lower cFT (hazard ratio 1.18 per 1 SD decrease). Lower estradiol was 
associated with higher risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio 1.11 per 1 SD

826 men developed dementia, of which 288 were classified as having Alzheimer’s 

 diseaseb. Lower testosterone concentrations were associated with higher incidence 
of dementia (overall trend P = 0.001, hazard ratio 1.43 for lowest vs highest 
quintile), and Alzheimer’s disease (overall trend P = 0.017, hazard ratio 1.80 for 
lowest vs highest quintile). Lower SHBG was associated with lower incidence 
of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (P =  < 0.001, hazard ratio 0.66; P = 0.012, 
hazard ratio 0.53 for lowest vs highest quintile, respectively)

Multiple  criteria  were  used  for  ascertainment  of  dementia  outcomes  including  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  the  American  Psychiatric 
Association (DSM), International Classification of Disease of the World Health Organization (ICD) and the National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) Alzheimer’s criteria
a cognitive assessment undertaken
b dementia diagnosis based on hospital morbidity and other health registry data

at baseline were associated with lower risk of incident 
dementia, albeit the actual number of cases was small [62]. 
A case–control study reported a non-linear association of 
baseline testosterone with dementia risk, suggesting both 
lower and higher concentrations might be associated with 
higher risk [63]. One consideration in observational stud-
ies is the extent to which lower testosterone concentrations 
reflect underlying poorer general health, which may con-
tribute to the outcomes of interest. Analyses were adjusted 
for potential confounders including age, smoking, BMI 

and medical comorbidities [57–63], and in some cases also 
for APOE Ɛ4 status [60,  62, 63]. However, residual con-
founding from unmeasured variables, possibly reflecting 
poorer general health, remains possible in observational 
analyses.

In the Health In Men Study (HIMS), of 4,069 men aged 
71–88 years, 499 developed dementia during a median of 
10.5 years follow-up [14]. In that study, after adjusting for 
age and other comorbidities, lower testosterone, cFT and 
estradiol concentrations at baseline were all associated with 

1 3Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (2022) 23:1243–1257

1247

higher risk of incident dementia during follow-up, while 
SHBG  was  not  associated.  The  effect  of  older  age  was 
evident: mean age at baseline of the 499 men who devel-
oped dementia was 78.7 years, compared with 76.8 years 
for men who remained free of dementia, and there was a 
15% increased risk of dementia per year of increased age. 
In comparison the risk of dementia increased by 11% per 1 
standard deviation lower baseline total testosterone concen-
tration [14]. A strength of HIMS was the measurement of 
sex hormones using mass spectrometry and the large num-
ber of outcome events observed (consistent with the size 
of the cohort and the age of the men, as well as duration 
of follow-up). Dementia outcomes were ascertained using 
registry data and were not independently adjudicated. The 
largest prospective cohort study to report associations of tes-
tosterone and SHBG with dementia outcomes is the United 
Kingdom (UK) Biobank, in which 159,411 community-
dwelling men, aged 50–73 years, were followed for 7 years, 
with 826 men developing dementia of whom 288 were clas-
sified as having dementia due to Alzheimer disease [13]. 
In that study, median age at baseline was 61 years. After 
adjustment  for  sociodemographic,  lifestyle  and  medical 
factors and medications use, there were contrasting asso-
ciations of testosterone and SHBG. Men with lower testos-
terone concentrations had a higher incidence of dementia, 
and of dementia due to Alzheimer disease. Those in the low-
est quintile of total testosterone concentrations had a 43% 
increased risk of developing dementia, and an 80% increased 
risk of dementia due to Alzheimer disease, compared with 
men in the highest quintile. Lower cFT was similarly associ-
ated with higher risk of dementia and AD. By contrast, men 
with lower SHBG concentrations had a lower incidence of 
dementia, and of dementia due to Alzheimer disease [13]. 
Although this cohort included middle-aged as well as older 
men, then median age at diagnosis of incident dementia was 
70 years, and 82% of men were diagnosed at age ≥ 65 years. 
UK Biobank also utilised registry data to ascertain diagnoses 
of dementia and dementia due to Alzheimer disease, using 
an algorithm validated against clinical expert adjudication 
of full-text medical records [64, 65]. Thus, two large pop-
ulation-based cohort studies, of middle-aged to older men 
in UK Biobank, and older men in HIMS, found consistent 
associations of lower baseline testosterone concentrations 
with higher incidence of dementia, and of dementia due to 
Alzheimer disease [13,  14]. Higher SHBG may be asso-
ciated with both cognitive decline in older men [61], and 
higher incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in 
middle-aged to older men [13]. Thus in observational stud-
ies, testosterone concentrations are inversely, and SHBG 
concentrations directly, associated with risk of developing 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

5   Studies of men undergoing androgen 

deprivation therapy for prostate cancer

Two  small  observational  studies  reported  increases  in 
β-amyloid concentrations in men following androgen dep-
rivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of prostate cancer [66, 
67]. In other small observational studies of men undergoing 
ADT for treatment of prostate cancer, inconsistent effects 
on cognitive function have been observed [67–71]. These 
studies were limited by their relatively small size and lack 
of control groups, with some studies associating ADT with 
poorer performance in selected measures of cognitive func-
tion, while other studies showed no associations or even bet-
ter performance in other tests.

In a study comparing 15 men receiving ADT and 15 not 
receiving ADT, results of cognitive function tests were simi-
lar between groups at 6 months [72]. However, functional 
MRI studies showed subtle differences in medial prefrontal 
cortical activation, and connectivity between the medial 
prefrontal cortex and other regions involved with cognitive 
control between groups [72]. Other studies have not shown 
consistent effects of ADT on cognition [73, 74]. However, 
in a trial involving 82 men with prostate cancer, 24 of 50 
men randomised to ADT had a decline in one or more cogni-
tive tests at 6 months, whereas none of 15 men randomised 
to close observation showed a decline in any test perfor-
mance [75]. Therefore, ADT may have an adverse effect on 
cognition, most likely visuospatial abilities and executive 
functioning, but the evidence is very limited and not wholly 
consistent [76, 77]. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
of 14 studies with 417 patients with prostate cancer treated 
with ADT, associated ADT with worse performance on visu-
omotor tasks, but not other cognitive domains, compared to 
noncancer control groups [78]. A recent systematic review 
of 31 studies found that 16 did not show a negative effect of 
ADT on cognition, whereas 11 studies reported a negative 
effect on cognitive function and 4 were inconclusive [79]. 
Therefore, ADT may have adverse effects on cognitive per-
formance, but this is not invariable and may be limited to 
specific domains.

Of note, two recent large registry studies have associated 
ADT for prostate cancer with higher risk of dementia [80, 
81]. In a study of 23,651 men with prostate cancer median 
age 73 years, 1,525 were diagnosed with incident demen-
tia during median follow-up of 3.5 years. Men receiving 
antiandrogen monotherapy had a higher risk of dementia 
and  Alzheimer’s  disease  compared  to  men  who  did  not 
receive ADT [80]. In that study the risk of dementia in men 
receiving GnRH agonist treatment, or those who underwent 
orchidectomy, was similar to those who received no ADT. In 
a study of 13,570 men with prostate cancer aged ≥ 50 years, 

1 31248

Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (2022) 23:1243–1257

317 were diagnosed with dementia after median 7.0 years 
follow-up  [81].  Cumulative  ADT  exposure  was  associ-
ated with dementia risk. A meta-analysis of seven cohort 
studies including 90,543 men with prostate cancer (38,307 
exposed to ADT and 52,236 non-exposed), associated ADT 
with higher incidence of subsequent dementia [82]. Another 
meta-analysis of seven studies including 50,541 individuals 
showed an increased risk of dementia in ADT users [83]. 
Important factors to consider in the context of variable find-
ings include differences in cognitive assessments or cate-
gorisation of dementia, the type, duration and intensity of 
ADT, analytical strategies to minimise bias, and polygenic 
or multifactorial determinants of dementia risk.

6   Randomised trials of testosterone 
with cognitive function endpoints

6.1   Trials in general populations of men

A large number of clinical trials with relatively small num-
bers of participants, have been conducted to investigate the 
effects of testosterone, for generally limited durations of 
intervention, on various cognitive function tests as endpoints 
in relatively small numbers of participants (Table 2). Ear-
lier studies included 15 to 88 participants, used transdermal, 
oral or intramuscular formulations of testosterone, and were 
conducted mainly in older men from the general population 
[84–94, 96]. Three studies of 12 months found no effect of 
testosterone on cognitive abilities [85, 88, 89]. In one study 
of 1.5 months duration, inducing hypogonadism in groups of 
younger and older men, did not appear to modify cognition 
[96]. Five studies reported improvements in tests of visu-
ospatial cognition: in three studies with durations ranging 
from 1.5 to 5 months there were no effects on other domains 
of cognitive function [84, 86, 90], in two studies with dura-
tion of 1.5 months there were also concomitant improve-
ments in verbal memory [91,  94]. One two-month study 
reported decreased performance in tests of verbal memory 
in levonorgestrel-treated men, but improved selective atten-
tion in men receiving testosterone and levonorgestrel [87]. 
One nine-month study reported a decrease in verbal memory 
with testosterone treatment [92]. A 36 month study found no 
difference in multiple cognitive tests, except for improved 
verbal memory in older men treated with testosterone and 
finasteride [93]. Therefore, some but not all of these earlier 
and smaller trials reported a possible benefit of testoster-
one intervention primarily on spatial cognition after shorter 
durations of intervention. However, there were inconsistent 

results for verbal memory, and several longer duration trials 
did not find evidence of benefit.

Two larger and more recent clinical trials merit particu-
lar attention [95, 97]. Emmelot-Vonk et al. randomised 237 
healthy men aged 60–80 years with baseline total testos-
terone concentrations < 13.7 nmol/L, to oral testosterone or 
matching placebo for 6 months, with 223 included in the 
primary analysis [95]. In that study testosterone treatment 
reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, but there were no 
differences between groups for visuospatial performance, 
perceptual speed, attention, or verbal memory. The Testos-
terone Effects on Atherosclerosis in Aging Men (TEAAM) 
trial randomised 308 men aged ≥ 60 years who had baseline 
total testosterone concentrations of 3.4–13.9 nmol/L, or a 
calculated free testosterone value of < 173 pmol/L, to trans-
dermal testosterone or matching placebo, for 3 years [97]. 
In the TEAMM trial, 140 men in each group were included 
in the final analysis, finding no benefit of testosterone treat-
ment for visuospatial ability, verbal fluency, verbal memory, 
manual dexterity, attention or executive function. Therefore, 
two major testosterone randomised controlled trials in the 
general population of middle-aged to older men with low-
normal testosterone concentrations, one of 6 months oral 
testosterone, the other of 36 months transdermal testoster-
one, have not found a benefit of testosterone intervention 
on cognition.

Of  note,  a  recent  secondary  analysis  of  the  Lifestyle 
Intervention and Testosterone Replacement in Obese Sen-
iors (LITROS) trial, examined the effect of transdermal 
testosterone compared to placebo, on a background of an 
intensive weight management and exercise program [98]. 
Participants in LITROS were older men (≥ 65 years) who 
were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), had baseline total testosterone 
concentrations < 10.4 nmol/L and had evidence of mild to 
moderate physical frailty. The intensive lifestyle interven-
tion consisted of a weight management program (aiming to 
achieve 10% weight loss at six months) and exercise training, 
provided to all trial participants, on top of which they were 
randomised to transdermal testosterone or matching placebo. 
In LITROS, testosterone treatment resulted in improved 
visuospatial performance, attention, verbal memory, and 
global cognition scores, compared to placebo [98]. This 
was a smaller study compared with the Emmelot-Vonk et al. 
and TEAAM trials [95, 97]. Nevertheless the findings are 
intriguing, suggesting that testosterone treatment in obese 
older men, applied in conjunction with an intensive lifestyle 
intervention, may result in improvement across a range of 
cognitive measures in a relatively short space of time. It is 
known that exercise may have cognitive benefits for people 
through the lifecourse [99].

6.2   Trials in men with cognitive impairment 

or dementia

The above studies were conducted in men from the general 
population, who were not selected for the presence of cogni-
tive impairment at baseline [84–98]. Therefore, the results 
may have been influenced by the relative lack of cognitive 
vulnerability of the participating men. Intervention studies 
in men at greater risk for cognitive decline or with estab-
lished dementia, may yield different results compared to 
low-risk men with robust cognitive function [100–103]. 
Several interventional studies of testosterone have been con-
ducted targeting groups of men with cognitive impairment 
as summarised (Table 3).

Several earlier and relatively small trials in men with 
mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer disease, 
reported inconsistent results [103–106]. One small trial in 
10 men with newly diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease of fort-
nightly intramuscular testosterone treatment for 12 months, 
reported improved general cognition and visuospatial ability 
[103]. Another trial in 11 men with mild cognitive impair-
ment  (MCI)  of  intramuscular  testosterone  given  every 
3 weeks, over 3 months, found no difference in cognitive 
test results [104]. Two larger trials were more encouraging. 
One trial in 32 men with either MCI or Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, of weekly intramuscular testosterone treatment over 
1.5 months, reported improvement in spatial ability and 
verbal memory [105]. Another using transdermal testos-
terone over 6 months in 16 men with Alzheimer’s disease, 
reported a trend to improvement in visuospatial function, but 
no difference in verbal memory [106]. In another study, 22 
men were randomly allocated to testosterone treatment for 
24 weeks, and after a 4 week washout crossed over to pla-
cebo for 24 weeks, with another 22 men randomly allocated 
to placebo followed by testosterone [107]. In that study, tes-
tosterone treatment was associated with improvement in a 
global cognition test score. Overall, the findings of these 
studies should be regarded as being suggestive at best, given 
the relatively small sample sizes involved [103–107].

The  Testosterone  Trials  (T  Trials)  recruited  788  men 
aged ≥ 65 years, with baseline total testosterone < 9.54 nmol/L,  
and symptoms related to sexual function, physical func-
tion, and/or vitality into a series of co-ordinated trials with 
a 12-month intervention, to test different outcomes [109]. In 
the Cognition Trial, a subgroup of 493 men met the criteria 
for age-associated memory impairment (subjective memory 
complaints and/or objective memory impairment), and were 
the primary analysis cohort for a series of cognitive end-
points (Table 3) [108]. When the 247 testosterone-treated 
men were compared to the 246 placebo recipients, there 
was no effect of testosterone on tests of verbal and visual 
memory, executive function, or spatial ability, at either 6 or 
12 months. The primary outcome of improvement in delayed 

paragraph recall was not met in the analysis of the Cogni-
tion Trial cohort, nor in the analysis of the whole T Trials 
cohort. However, an exploratory analyses of the entire T 
Trials cohort found a small improvement in executive func-
tion in testosterone-treated men, a secondary outcome [108]. 
Therefore, the Cognition Trial overall  showed  a neutral 
effect of one year’s treatment with transdermal testosterone 
on cognitive function [110].

These findings highlight the challenges in proving causal-
ity. Large, well-powered epidemiological studies adjusting 
for potential confounders show middle-aged and older men 
with lower testosterone concentrations have a higher risk of 
being diagnosed with dementia [13, 14]. Some smaller clini-
cal trials, often using intramuscular injections of testoster-
one, suggest a benefit of testosterone intervention on specific 
measures of cognitive function, but other trials have shown 
no benefit [84–94, 96, 103–107]. Several larger clinical tri-
als using oral or transdermal testosterone have not shown a 
benefit of testosterone treatment on cognitive function [95, 
97, 108]. We hypothesise that epidemiological studies reflect 
an extended period of exposure to differences in circulating 
testosterone concentrations, resulting in subtle but cumula-
tive effects on cognition, in a manner not replicated in clini-
cal trials of relatively shorter duration. It is possible that the 
mechanisms of any putative testosterone-induced benefits 
may affect multiple different pathologies associated with 
cognitive decline in older people. It is possible that larger 
and longer clinical trials may be required, and that route of 
administration of testosterone and differences in pharma-
cokinetics may be relevant [34]. It is also possible that com-
bining testosterone with a lifestyle intervention, may provide 
a more informative clinical trial strategy [98, 111, 112].

The APOE Ɛ4 allele is a key genetic risk factor for late-
onset Alzheimer’s disease, and an interaction between free 
testosterone and APOE Ɛ4 genotype has been reported [113]. 
Whether future clinical trials would benefit from incorporat-
ing consideration of APOE Ɛ4 genotype, or other genetic 
markers associated with Alzheimer’s disease, into the study 
design remains to be determined. Genetic polymorphisms 
associated with testosterone concentrations have been identi-
fied, but a recent Mendelian randomisation analysis of UK 
Biobank men did not find any association between polymor-
phisms associated with cFT and dementia risk [114, 115].

7   Diabetes and dementia

7.1   Diabetes as a risk factor for dementia

Diabetes mellitus is a recognised risk predictor for the devel-
opment of dementia and dementia due to Alzheimer dis-
ease [20, 116–118]. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the large

majority of cases of diabetes, and shares risk factors with 
dementia itself, including overweight/obesity and physical 
inactivity [116]. Therefore, it is plausible that addressing 
such risk factors and reducing the incidence of diabetes may 
reduce the subsequent risk of dementia. Of note, there is a 
bidirectional association of obesity with lower testosterone 
concentrations in middle-aged to older men [3, 4]. Men with 
lower testosterone concentrations are more likely to have 
or to develop metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes [119, 
120]. In conjunction with the known associations of lower 
testosterone concentrations with risk of dementia (as dis-
cussed earlier), it has been postulated that testosterone may 
play some role in the interaction between excess adiposity, 
diabetes and dementia [121].

Intensive lifestyle interventions aimed at reducing excess 
weight with a combination of dietary changes and increas-
ing physical activity levels are effective at preventing type 2 
diabetes [122, 123]. Exercise is recommended as part of the 
management of type 2 diabetes, and may help to ameliorate 
dementia risk in that setting [124, 125]. Therefore, lifestyle 
measures which prevent or help manage type 2 diabetes may 
overlap to some degree with lifestyle measures to reduce 
future risk of dementia [19,  20]. Whether such lifestyle 
interventions combined with testosterone treatment might 
protect against both type 2 diabetes and cognitive decline, 
remains unclear.

7.2   Testosterone prevents or reverses type 2 

diabetes in high‑risk men

Testosterone for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mel-
litus in high-risk men (T4DM) recruited 1,007 men aged 
50–74 years, with waist circumference ≥ 95 cm, baseline 
testosterone concentration ≤ 14 nmol/L and either impaired 
glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (oral 
glucose tolerance test [OGTT] 2-h glucose concentration 
7.8–11.0 mmol/L or ≤ 15 mmol/L respectively) to a two-year 
intervention with three-monthly intramuscular testosterone 
undecanoate versus placebo on a background of a Weight 
Watchers lifestyle intervention [126, 127]. After two years, 
type 2 diabetes was present in 87/413 (21%) of men in the 
placebo group, and 55/443 (12%) men in the testosterone 
group (relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.80, 
p = 0.0007) [127]. Testosterone treated men gained on aver-
age 0.39 kg of muscle mass and lost 4.6 kg of fat, whereas 
placebo treated men lost 1.3 kg of muscle mass and 1.9 kg 
of fat. T4DM is the largest testosterone randomised con-
trolled trial completed to date, with an unequivocal result 
showing a beneficial effect of testosterone treatment, in the 
setting of a background lifestyle intervention, to prevent or 
revert type 2 diabetes in men at high risk. Thus testoster-
one pharmacotherapy is an option whose benefits and risks 
may be discussed, and compared with other lifestyle-based 

or pharmacological interventions [128]. However, T4DM 
did not include any cognition-related endpoints. Therefore, 
testosterone treatment in conjunction with lifestyle interven-
tion, addresses two key factors predisposing to dementia, 
namely obesity and diabetes, but its effect on dementia risk 
remains unproven.

8   Clinical implications and considerations 

for future testosterone intervention trials

Testosterone exerts systemic effects across multiple tissues 
[129]. The T Trials sub-studies showed that testosterone 
treatment improved anaemia, and increased volumetric bone 
mineral density [130, 131]. Similarly, in T4DM, testoster-
one treatment improved sexual function, and also improved 
volumetric bone mineral density predominantly via effects 
on cortical bone [127, 132]. However, in the T Trials car-
diovascular sub-study of 73 testosterone-treated men and 
65 men receiving placebo, daily transdermal testosterone 
treatment was associated with an increase in non-calcified 
coronary atheromatous plaque volume, but not in coronary 
calcium score [133]. However, in that sub-study the groups 
were unbalanced, with men in the placebo group having 
substantially more plaque at baseline and at the end of the 
study, posing a challenge when interpreting the results [110]. 
Further studies to elucidate the effect of testosterone treat-
ment on progression of coronary atheroma and more broadly 
on cardiovascular risk are required [10, 110]. As vascular 
pathology is the second commonest pathology found in older 
people with dementia this has major implications on the risk 
for dementia.

A United States Food and Drug Administration man-
dated cardiovascular safety study of daily transdermal tes-
tosterone, A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Testosterone 
Replacement Therapy on the Incidence of Major Adverse 
Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and Efficacy Measures in 
Hypogonadal Men (TRAVERSE, NCT03518034), aims to 
recruit 6,000 men aged 45–80 years who have evidence of 
or are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease [134]. This 
study commenced in May 2018, with planned completion 
in June 2022, with the primary outcome of MACE, sec-
ondary outcomes of cardiovascular and prostate safety, and 
other outcomes of sexual activity, remission of persistent 
depressive disorder, bone fractures, correction of anaemia, 
and progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes [134]. There-
fore, when completed this study should provide important 
information on the cardiovascular safety of testosterone in 
men at high risk of or with prevalent cardiovascular disease. 
It may confirm other findings from T Trials and T4DM, but 
will not address the issue of cognitive decline. A future large 
randomised trial of testosterone with an extended duration 
of intervention and cognition-related endpoints would be

needed. Potential benefits may result from direct effects of 
testosterone on pathophysiological processes underlying 
development of dementia and/or indirectly via beneficial 
effects of testosterone on body composition and metabolism.

9   Summary and conclusions

The convergence of population ageing with increasing rates 
of dementia represents a major global public health chal-
lenge. Understanding the relationships between male age-
ing, declining circulating testosterone concentrations, and 
increasing cognitive impairment and dementia, may provide 
important insights into novel preventive strategies. Mecha-
nistic studies indicate that testosterone may have protective 
effects within the brain, slowing the development of the 
multiple pathologies found in men with dementia due to 
Alzheimer disease. Epidemiological studies of middle-aged 
and older men associate lower testosterone concentrations 
with higher prevalence and incidence of cognitive decline 
and dementia. Observational studies of men with prostate 
cancer have associated ADT with decrements in cognitive 
function and higher risk of dementia. However, evidence for 
causality remains elusive.

Smaller testosterone intervention studies using different 
measures of cognitive function have yielded inconsistent 
results, with some studies suggesting improvement. The T 
Trials Cognition Study did not show a benefit of one year of 
transdermal testosterone treatment on cognition. Diabetes 
predisposes to dementia, and T4DM showed that two years 
treatment with intramuscular testosterone undecanoate on a 
background of lifestyle intervention, prevented or reverted 
diabetes in men with impaired glucose tolerance or newly 
diagnosed type 2 diabetes. T4DM did not assess cognitive 
function as an endpoint, but it does point the way to future 
studies, in which testosterone treatment could be combined 
with lifestyle intervention to assess the effects on cognitive 
function.

Thus additional research is warranted, pending which 
lower testosterone concentrations in ageing men should be 
regarded as a biomarker rather than a proven therapeutic 
target for risk reduction of cognitive decline and dementia, 
including dementia due to Alzheimer disease.
