Introduction  There are more than 370 million indigenous 
people from 5000 cultures living in 90 countries 
worldwide. Although they make up 5% of the global 
population, they account for 15% of the extreme poor. 
Youth suicide is the second leading cause of mortality 
among 15–29 years old and disproportionately affects 
indigenous youth. This research protocol pertains to a 
systematic review of studies that use a comparator/control 
group to evaluate the effectiveness of suicide interventions 
targeting indigenous adolescents (aged 10–19 years).
Methods and analysis  We will conduct a systematic 
search on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and 
PsycINFO from inception to September 2019 to identify 
articles that compare mental health interventions for 
suicide prevention among indigenous adolescents. Two 
reviewers will independently determine the eligibility of 
each study. Studies will be assessed for methodological 
quality using the risk of bias tool to assess non- 
randomised studies of interventions. We will conduct a 
meta- analysis if possible and use established statistical 
methods to identify and control for heterogeneity where 
appropriate.
Ethics and dissemination  This systematic review will 
use published data and does not require ethics approval. 
However, this review is in preparation of a feasibility 
study that will examine how best to support the physical 
and mental health of indigenous adolescents in Brazil. 
Ethics approval for the feasibility study was obtained from 
National Research Ethics Commission. Findings will be 
disseminated through a peer- reviewed publication and will 
be made available to key decision- makers with authority 
for indigenous health and other relevant stakeholders.
PrOSPErO registration number  CRD42019141754.

IntrOduCtIOn
There  are  more  the  370 million  indigenous 
people from 5000 cultures living in 90 coun-
tries  worldwide.  Although  they  make  up  5% 
of  the  global  population,  they  account  for 
15%  of  the  extreme  poor.1  Anderson  et  al 
conducted  a  systematic  analysis  of  several 
social  and  health  indicators  for  28  indige-
nous populations in 23 countries and showed 
poorer  outcomes  for  indigenous  peoples 

Strengths and limitations of this study

 ► The systematic review will fill a gap in the evidence 
base by providing a comprehensive assessment of 
the  existing  literature  that  evaluates  the  effective-
ness of mental health interventions for suicide pre-
vention among indigenous adolescents.

 ► Rigorous methods of review wll be followed with at 
least two independent study authors to conduct for 
screening, data extraction and critical appraisal.
 ► The  findings  will  inform  policy  actors  and  practi-
tioners about feasible interventions to prevent sui-
cide among indigenous adolescents.

 ► If  a  paucity  of  studies  is  reported  then  this  would 
locate  a  research  gap  that  needs  to  be  urgently 
addressed.

than  for  non- indigenous  populations.2  A 
gap  in  life  expectancy  at  birth  (ie,  lower  in 
indigenous than non- indigenous populations 
in  the  same  country)  of  more  than  5  years 
was  recorded  for  indigenous  populations  in 
Australia,  Cameroon,  Canada  (First  Nations 
and  Inuit),  Greenland,  Kenya,  New  Zealand 
and Panama. Infant mortality rates for indig-
enous infants were more than two times than 
that  of  those  observed  for  non- indigenous 
or national populations in Brazil, Colombia, 
Greenland,  Peru,  Russia  and  Venezuela. 
Poverty,  poor  education  levels,  employment 
status  and  access  to  health  services  are  all 
important  contributors  to  the  health  dispar-
ities.  Despite  representing  a  rich  diversity 
of  cultures,  they  continue  to  be  among  the 
world’s most disadvantaged groups, regardless 
of whether they live in high- income countries 
(eg,  the  Inuit  in  Canada)  or  lower  middle- 
income  countries  (eg,  Baka  in  Cameroon). 
The legacy of colonisation and of policies of 
forced  assimilation  continue  to  be  a  cause 
of 
trauma,  manifested 
through  feelings  of  marginality,  depression,

anxiety and confusion, which places indigenous peoples 
at increased risk of suicide.3

Youth suicide is the second leading cause of mortality 
among  15–29  years  old4  and  disproportionately  affects 
indigenous  youth.5–7  Indigenous  children  (5–17  years 
old)  in  Australia  die  from  suicide  at  five  times  the  rate 
of their non- indigenous peers (10.1 per 100 000 vs 2 per 
100 000 in 2013–2017). In New Zealand, the suicide rate 
in Maori youth aged 15–24 years is more than two times 
than  that  of  non- Maori  peers.  (40.7  per  100 000  vs  15.6 
per  100 000  in  2013–2017).  In  Canada,  the  rate  among 
Inuit  youth  is  11  times  than  that  of  the  non- indigenous 
youths.8  Most  interpretations  of  this  gap  highlight  the 
persistent social and economic disadvantage experienced 
by  indigenous  youth  relative  to  non- indigenous  youth.9 
The epidemic of youth suicide is relatively recent in some 
cultures,  with  an  increase  in  the  latter  half  of  the  20th 
century, with men accounting for the majority of suicides, 
and  with  the  15–24  years  age  group  having  the  highest 
suicide rates of any age group.10 11 Furthermore, suicide 
among indigenous young people may be unreported due 
to  misclassification.  Risk  factors  include  mental  health 
disorders, stressful life events, substance abuse and poor 
physical  health  all  of  which  occur  at  disproportionately 
higher  rates  in  indigenous  populations.12  13  Suicide  in 
youth  is  also  known  to  occur  in  clusters,  and  suicidal 
behaviours (eg, ideation, attempts) are strong risk factors 
for death by suicide.6 Protective factors include high social 
support,  cultural  connectedness  and  personality  factors 
such as high self- esteem and internal locus of control and 
increasing age.6

increasingly  recognised  through 

Over the last 20 years, indigenous people’s rights have 
international 
been 
organisations  such  as  the  United  Nations  Permanent 
Forum  on  Indigenous  Issues,  which  has  a  permanent 
forum  for  youth.2  The  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable 
Development  refers  to  indigenous  people  six  times: 
three times in the political declaration, two times in the 
target  under  Goal  2  on  Zero  Hunger  (target  2.3)  and 
Goal  4  on  education  (target  4.5).  Many  of  the  Sustain-
able  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  however,  are  relevant 
for  indigenous  peoples,  particularly  those  with  a  focus 
on  reducing  inequalities  and  reducing  mortality  from 
non- communicable  diseases  (including  suicide)  by  33% 
by  2030.  Given  the  vulnerability  of  indigenous  commu-
nities,  implementation  of  the  SDGs  provide  opportuni-
ties for policy actors to promote initiatives that improve 
outcomes  among  indigenous  communities.  With  such 
high  rates  of  suicide  among  indigenous  youth,8  cultur-
ally  relevant  suicide  interventions  are  urgently  needed. 
Many  indigenous  populations  hold  a  holistic  view  of 
health  and  well- being  and  interventions  need  to  align 
with  these  perspectives  and  engage  with  the  economic, 
socioenvironmental and historical issues that contribute 
to  youth  suicide  in  indigenous  cultures.  There  have 
been  two  reviews  of  suicide  prevention  programmes.9  10 
Both  captured  studies  published  up  to  2012.  Clifford  et 
al10  reported  on  two  Australian  programmes  and  seven 

2

American  programmes.  The  programmes  targeted  all 
ages, and there was a general lack of rigorous evaluation 
designs  as  only  one  study  included  in  the  review  evalu-
ated  outcomes  using  a  comparator  group.  Harlow  et  al9 
reported on nine evaluations of suicide prevention inter-
ventions  with  youths;  five  targeted  Native  Americans; 
three  targeted  Aboriginal  Australians  and  one  targeted 
First  Nation  Canadians.  As  with  the  previous  review, 
poor evaluation designs were noted. In recognition of a 
general  lack  of  methodologically  rigorous  study  designs 
across  geographically  and  culturally  diverse  indigenous 
populations and the need for an updated review, we will 
use a broad eligibility criterion to maximise the possibility 
of capturing any study that attempted to evaluate preven-
tion  programmes  using  a  comparator  group  among 
adolescents.

This article presents the protocol for a systematic review 
of studies which used a comparator/control group to eval-
uate  the  effectiveness  of  suicide  interventions  targeting 
indigenous adolescents (aged 10–19 years).

ObjECtIvE
To synthesise the scientific evidence on suicide prevention 
programmes  targeting  indigenous  youth.  Our  principal 
research question is: What interventions, including single 
or multicomponent interventions, prevented suicides (or 
not) and why did they work (or not)?

MEthOdS And AnAlySIS
This protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items 
for  Systematic  reviews  and  Meta- Analyses  Protocols 
(Equity) guidelines.14

types of studies
We  will  include  any  randomised  or  non- randomised 
studies, which has a control or comparative group.

types of participants
The participants will be adolescents aged 10–19 years who 
self- identified as indigenous peoples and are accepted as 
such  by  their  community.2  We  are  guided  by  the  policy 
definition developed by the International Labour Organi-
zation (ILO) in 1989. It characterises indigenous peoples 
as: tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, 
cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from 
other  sections  of  the  national  community  and  whose 
status is regulated wholly or partly by their own customs 
or traditions or by special laws or regulations; and peoples 
in  independent  countries  who  are  regarded  as  indige-
nous because of their descent from the populations who 
inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which 
the  country  belongs,  at  the  time  of  conquest  or  coloni-
sation  or  the  establishment  of  present  state  boundaries 
and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or 
all  of  their  own  social,  economic,  cultural  and  political 
institutions.15 16

Grande AJ, et al. BMJ Open 2020;0:e034055. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034055AUTHOR PROOFtypes of interventions
We  will  include  in  person  or  e- health  interventions  and 
which have targeted young indigenous people anywhere 
in  the  world.  We  will  consider  a  wide  range  of  delivery 
channels (eg, in person, online, phone), different practi-
tioners (healthcare practitioners, teachers, lay healthcare 
providers) and sectors (ie, health, primary, secondary and 
tertiary care, education, guardianship councils).

types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
 ► Self- injury acts.
 ► Suicidal ideation.
 ► Suicide attempts.
 ► Death by suicide.

Secondary outcomes
 ► Well- being/Quality of life.
 ► Social Functioning including Educational Outcomes.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We  will  search  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of 
Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL,  March  2020,  MEDLINE 
(1966 to March 2020), EMBASE (1974 to March 2020), 
CINAHL  (1981  to  March  2020),  LILACS  (Latin  Amer-
ican  and  Caribbean  Health  Sciences)  (1982  to  March 
2020) and PsycINFO (1887 to March 2020). We will use 
the  search  terms:  (Indigenous  or  Indigenous  or  native* 
or Native* or Māori or Maori or Aborigin* or aboriginal 
or “Torres Strait Island*” or “torres strait island*” or “first 
nation*” or “first people*” or Inuit or Metis or Métis or 
ethnic* or “population groups”) AND (intervention* or 
program* or treatment* or treat* or therap* or service* 
or  prevent*  or  diversion*  or  initiative*)  AND  (well-
being  or  “well  being”  or  mental  or  depress*  or  anx*  or 
suicide* or trauma* or alcohol* or drinking or cannabis 
or cocaine or methamphet* or amphet* or substance* or 
addict* or heal* or empower* or grief or loss* or stress* 
or  psychosis  or  psychoses  or  psychotic  or  resilien*  or 
recovery or “mental health” OR schizophrenia or mania 
or mood or internalizing or externalizing or affective or 
behavioural or drugs or “crack cocaine” or addiction or 
“mental  illness”  or  happiness  or  emotion*  or  psych*  or 
psychology) adapted to every other database. We will not 
use any language restrictions. If articles are not in English, 
Italian, Lebanese or Portuguese (native languages of the 
authors), we will use academic networks (eg, Cochrane) 
to  translate  the  critical  parts  (methods  and  results)  to 
enable screening of abstracts and, if included this will be 
done for the full paper

Searching other resources
Experts  will  be  identified  via  professional  organisations 
(eg,  Royal  College  of  Psychiatrists),  academic  networks 
and  research  societies  (Social  Science  and  Medicine), 
medical  associations  (eg,  Brazilian  Medical  Association) 
and also via targeted researchers (eg, those at Federal and 
State universities of Brazil who study indigenous health). 

Open access

We will search for published and unpublished studies (eg, 
theses available in electronic format) that may be eligible 
for inclusion.

Inclusion criteria
We will include non- randomised and randomised studies, 
regardless  of  whether  they  contained  process  evalua-
tion although its inclusion in studies will aid the under-
standing of why an intervention worked or not.

Our  primary  aim  focus  is  on  any  intervention  that 
prevents  suicide,  which  may  also  include  studies  that 
used positive psychology and promoted resilience- related 
competencies, where these were implemented for suicide 
prevention. These competencies may include the use of 
coping skills that may ultimately mitigate the emergence 
of acute states of distress and mental health problems to 
eventually  prevent  suicidal  behaviour.  Improved  social–
emotional  competence  can  be  expected  to  afford  some 
degree of protection against the development of suicidal 
ideations and behaviours. Hence, identifying and under-
standing  aspects  of  interventions  (eg,  use  of  problem 
solving 
for  conflict  resolution,  community/cultural 
assets,)  that  promote  resilience  are  important  steps  in 
preventing suicide.17 18

Additionally, we aim to capture a broad range of interven-
tions that include either a component or solely targeting 
suicide  prevention  in  adolescents  in  the  education  and 
community  sectors.  These  may  include  suicide- specific 
education programmes, combined suicide- specific educa-
tion and life skills training programmes, individual- level 
psychotherapeutic  interventions,  gatekeeper  training, 
peer/community  help,  peer  gatekeeper  training  and 
curriculum- based interventions.

Guided by the ILO definition, studies will be included 
if  participants  self- identified  as  indigenous  and  were 
accepted as such by their community According to ILO 
(1989)2;  had  historical  continuity  and  land  occupation 
before  invasion  and  colonisation;  had  strong  links  to 
territories (land and water) and related natural resources; 
belonged to distinct social, economic or political systems; 
had distinct language, culture, religion, ceremonies and 
beliefs; belonged to non- dominant groups of society with 
resolution to maintain and reproduce ancestral environ-
ments and systems as distinct peoples and communities, 
and with a tendency to manage their own affairs separate 
from centralised state authorities.

Exclusion criteria
If  the  population  included  in  study  is  not  indigenous 
or  there  is  no  distinction  between  indigenous  and  non- 
indigenous populations.

If  youth  are  not  included  in  study  or  are  only  briefly 

mentioned or adult population.

data collection and analysis
Two review authors (AJG, CE) will independently assess all 
studies identified from the database searches by screening 
titles and abstracts using EndNote V.X8 software. A third 

3

review  author  (SH)  will  resolve  any  disagreements,  and 
reasons for including and excluding trials were recorded. 
Next, AJG and CE will independently assess the full‐text 
reports for inclusion against the selection criteria.

After  both  authors  have  discussed  the  results  of  the 
selection  process  and  have  made  a  consensus  decision 
on which articles to be included/excluded, the data from 
each of the articles meeting the eligibility criteria will be 
extracted.

Qualitative data in the included studies will be reported 
using a narrative synthesis. Themes reported in the indi-
vidual studies will be described in a table, including any 
reported for barriers and facilitators. All the reviewers will 
initially  generate  the  analytical  themes  independently, 
and then collectively as a group so as to minimise bias.

Data extraction and management
Two review authors (AJG, CE) will independently extract 
data  from  the  included  studies  using  a  standard  data 
extraction form.

A  standardised,  pre- piloted  form  will  be  used  to 
extract data from the included studies for assessment of 
study  quality  and  evidence  synthesis.  Missing  data  will 
be  requested  from  study  authors.  The  draft  format  will 
include:

Study  details:  aim,  study  design  including  whether  a 
feasibility  study  was  conducted  in  collaboration  with 
the community to co- develop the design, design details, 
country  in  which  study  was  conducted,  details  on  loca-
tion of intervention delivery ( eg,. city or community) and 
target condition/risk factor (eg, subthreshold symptoms, 
experience of child maltreatment).

Participants:  sample  size  (intervention  and  control 
groups  at  baseline  and  follow- up),  sociodemographic 
characteristics (eg, age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
status) and attrition from the study.

Intervention details: description of intervention including 
frequency  and  duration  of  treatments/sessions,  mode 
of  delivery  (face  to  face,  internet),  format  (one  to  one 
or  group),  cultural  appropriate  content  and  cost  of 
intervention

Delivery of the intervention: setting in which intervention 
was  delivered  (school,  home,  healthcare  practice),  who 
delivered  the  intervention  (ie,  medical  doctor,  nurse, 
psychologist, teacher, lay health worker, peer promotion 
and  so  on)  and  whether  it  was  delivered  by  one  practi-
tioner or a team of individuals or online, fidelity of imple-
menters  to  protocol,  culturally  appropriate  modes  of 
delivery  and  whether  there  was  intersectoral  collabora-
tion (ie, between health and education or guardianship 
councils).

The  RE- AIM  (Reach,  Effectiveness,  Adoption,  Imple-
mentation,  Maintenance  framework)  will  be  used  to 
enhance the assessment of programme elements that can 
improve the sustainable adoption and implementation of 
effective, generalised/localised, evidence- based interven-
tions.19  RE- AIM  targets  reach  of  the  target  population; 
effectiveness or efficacy of the intervention (impact of an 

4

intervention on important outcomes, including potential 
negative effects, quality of life, and economic outcomes); 
adoption  by  target  staff,  settings  or  institutions;  imple-
mentation consistency, costs and adaptions made during 
delivery and maintenance of intervention effects in indi-
viduals and settings over time

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Cognisant  of  the  well- documented  limitations  of  the 
use  of  ‘western’  methods  in  an  indigenous  context, 
our  critical  appraisal  will  include  identifying  culturally 
appropriate  methodologies  such  as  Storytelling  and 
Community- Based Participatory Research, with the inclu-
sion  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the  research  process  in 
a  way  that  is  respectful  and  reciprocal.  We  will  include 
comparator groups as well as randomised study designs in 
recognition that the former may be more appropriate for 
the indigenous context.20 21

Two review authors (AJG, CE) will independently assess 
the risk of bias of the included studies using the Risk Of 
Bias  In  Non- randomised  Studie—of  Interventions  for 
non- randomised  studies  and  Risk  of  Bias  tool  2.0  for 
randomised studies.

Measures of treatment effect
Types  of  measurements  of  treatment  effect  (outcomes) 
that may be used:
1.  Dichotomous data: we will use risk ratio for likely bina-
ry outcomes, prevalence ratio for some outcomes.

2.  Continuous data: we will combine the results using the 
mean  difference  for  measures  using  the  same  scale 
or  the  standardised  mean  difference  where  different 
scales have been used to evaluate the same outcome.

unit of analysis issues
We  will  consider  the  individual  as  the  unit  of  analysis. 
We  will  separate  the  non- randomised  from  randomised 
studies if we have enough studies for meta- analysis.

dealing with missing data
We  will  send  two  emails  (one  initial,  one  reminder)  to 
the corresponding author to ask for any missing data or 
incompletely  reported  study  details.  We  will  check  for 
consistency between studies and analyse each outcome.

Assessment of heterogeneity
We  will  assess  the  inconsistencies  between  studies  using 
the  I2  statistic,  which  gives  the  percentage  of  total  vari-
ation  across  studies  that  is  due  to  heterogeneity  rather 
than chance. We will consider heterogeneity substantial if 
I2 is over 50%. See below for planned subgroup analysis.

Assessment of reporting biases
If mismatches are identified between study protocols and 
reports,  we  will  contact  the  trial  authors  to  clarify  the 
information. We plan to explore the impact of including 
such  studies  by  conducting  a  sensitivity  analysis.  We  will 
conduct a funnel plot asymmetry test if 10 or more trials 
are included.

Grande AJ, et al. BMJ Open 2020;0:e034055. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034055AUTHOR PROOFdata synthesis
We will present the data separately for randomised and 
non- randomised  studies.  We  will  meta- analyse  trials  if 
the  combination  of  data  on  outcomes  is  possible.  We 
will use a random effects model, independently of the 
heterogeneity identified. Forest plot graphics produced 
by RevMan V.5.3 will illustrate the meta- analyses. If the 
combination  of  data  is  not  possible,  we  will  present  a 
narrative  analysis  of  individual  studies.  We  will  create 
a  ‘summary  of  findings’  table  for  the  outcomes  and 
we  will  present  the  quality  of  the  body  of  evidence 
using  the  five  GRADE  (Grading  of  Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) assumptions 
(study  limitations,  consistency  of  effect,  imprecision, 
indirectness and publication bias).22

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We  plan  to  explore  the  subsets  or  subgroups  of  coun-
tries/regions,  for  primary,  secondary  or  tertiary  care, 
type  of  mental  health  condition,  gender,  age,  urban/
rural area.

Sensitivity analysis
We will pool included studies to verify whether the impact 
of  risk  of  bias  affects  the  overall  effect.  We  will  explore 
which studies increased heterogeneity.

Ethics and dissemination
This  systematic  review  will  use  published  data  and  does 
not  require  ethics  approval.  However,  this  review  is  in 
preparation  of  a  feasibility  study  that  will  examine  how 
best to support the physical and mental health of indige-
nous adolescents in Brazil. Ethics approval for the feasi-
bility  study  was  obtained  from  National  Research  Ethics 
Commission, protocol CAAE (Certificate of Presentation 
of  Ethical  Appreciation):  89604318.0000.8030,  analysis 
#3.100.358, from December of 2018.

Our  results  will  also  be  presented  at  national  and 
international  conferences  and  will  be  made  available 
to  key  decision- makers  with  authority  for  indigenous 
health.

Quality of the evidence
Two  review  authors  (AJG,  CE)  will  independently  rate 
the quality of the outcomes. We will use GRADE to rank 
the quality of the evidence using the Guideline Develop-
ment Tool software22 and also the guidelines provided in 
Chapter  11  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic 
Reviews of Interventions.23

Patient and public involvement
The topic to be covered by the review comes from our 
empirical  experience  with  the  indigenous  communi-
ties  in  Brazil  and  from  consultations  with  researchers 
in indigenous health, and with practitioners and policy 
actors  responsible  for  indigenous  health.  The  indige-
nous people were not directly involved in the writing of 
this protocol. The results will be disseminated to indig-
enous  communities,  practitioners  and  policy  actors  to 

Open access

aid the planning and provision of services. The authors 
are  from  Brazil  and  UK  and  do  not  self- identify  as 
indigenous.

This  review  will  present  the  best- available  evidence 
for decision- making on suicide prevention programmes 
targeting  indigenous  youth  in  the  literature.  It  will 
provide in one single document all primary research on 
the topic with the quality assessment for each study with 
a ranking of the quality of evidence.
