Evidence on the associations between patient’s disability and caregiver burden among Chinese family caregivers of individual living
with schizophrenia is lacking. This study aimed at explore the underlying mechanisms between patient’s disability and caregiver
burden among Chinese family caregivers of individual living with schizophrenia. A cross-sectional study was carried out in four
Chinese cities (Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen), between April, 2021 and March, 2022. A total of 493 patients and
their family caregivers were invited to report related data. The Zarit burden interview, WHODAS 2.0, the Potentially harmful
behavior scale, the Afﬁliate Stigma Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of perceived social support were used to collect data.
Linear regression analysis and bootstrapping analysis were conducted. The adjusted regression results showed that patients’
disability (B = 0.616; 95% CI: 0.479–0.753), potentially harmful behavior on caregivers (B = 0.474; 95% CI: 0.232–0.716), and
caregiver’s low social support (B = −0.079; 95% CI: −0.158– −0.002), high level of afﬁliate stigma (B = 13.045; 95% CI:
10.227–15.864) were associated with higher level of caregiver burden (p < 0.05). In the mediation model, the direct path from
patient’s disability to caregiver burden (B = 0.428, β = 0.371, p < 0.001) was signiﬁcant and positive. Patient’s disability was
indirectly associated with caregiver burden through patient’s potentially harmful behavior, caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma, and social
support, the standardized regression coefﬁcients ranged from 0.026-0.049 (p < 0.05). Patient’s potentially harmful behavior,
caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma, and social support mediated the relationship between patients’ disability and caregiver burden. Future
intervention studies designed to target these three factors may be beneﬁcial for family caregivers of persons living with
schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
As a major public health problem across the world, the burden of
mental disorders continues to increase, with signiﬁcant impacts on
health, social, and economic worldwide1. From 2011 to 2030, the
cumulative global
impact of mental disorders in terms of lost
economic output will amount to $16.3 trillion2. Although mental
disorders are signiﬁcant contributors to global health burden, the
global median of government health expenditure that goes to
mental health is less than 2%3. Currently, there were 5.5 million of
individuals living with schizophrenia in China. Considering the
number of years lived with disability (YLDs), mental disorders in
China accounted for 16.20% of all YLDs across the world4.
In
addition, the number of DALYs attributable to schizophrenia in
China increased over the past 3 decades, rising by 3.03% between
2000 and 20194.

Due to the scarcity of mental health resources and shortage of
specialized services5, and the inﬂuence of traditional Chinese
social culture (which emphasizes the importance of family unity
and mutual care among family members), most Chinese schizo-
phrenics are cared for by their family members6. Caring for
individuals living with schizophrenia is challenging, families of
individuals living with schizophrenia suffer from a quite heavy
caregiving burden, and those family caregivers are often faced

with the challenge of balancing caregiving responsibilities with
their own lives7.

Caregiver burden was deﬁned as “the level of multifaceted
strain perceived by the caregiver from caring for a family member
over time”8. Caring for individuals living with schizophrenia was
associated with a range of psychological (such as stress), social
(such as quality of life), physical (such as chronic disease), and
ﬁnancial problems9–11. Those problems,
in turn, may have
signiﬁcant impact the quality of care, and recovery of individuals
living with schizophrenia12,13. For example, Nuttall et al found that
higher perceived family burden predicted more psychotic
symptoms13. Considering these undesirable consequences, serval
studies tried to understand predictors of family caregiving burden
for individuals living with schizophrenia14. Researchers found that
some disease-related factors including patients’ higher level of
disability15,16,
illness17, more aggressive
behaviors18 were associated higher level of
family caregiving
burden. In addition, some caregiver-related factors such as low
social support19, perceived stigma20 were associated higher level
of caregiver burden. However, very few studies focused on how
those disease-related factors and caregiver-related factors will
affect caregiver burden. According to Pearlin’s caregiver stress
model, the behavior problems of patients with severe mental

illness often give rise to some secondary stressors for family
members. As a source of chronic stress for family caregivers, the
behavior problems of patients may consequently lead to a greater
care burden and lower quality of family care20. But the underlying
mechanisms of the relationship between those disease-related
factors, caregiver-related factors and caregiver burden among
Chinese family caregivers were unclear.

The current study aimed at exploring the possible associations
and underlying mechanisms between patients’ disability and
caregiver burden among Chinese family caregivers of adults
diagnosed with schizophrenia. Considering that there were many
studies highlighting the associations between disability, aggres-
sive behaviors of patients, social support, and afﬁliate stigma of
(a) disability would directly
caregivers, we hypothesized that:
(b) both disease-related (patients’
affect caregiver burden;
potentially harmful behavior) and caregiver-related stressors
(social support and afﬁliate stigma) would mediate the association
between disability and caregiver burden.

METHODS
Ethics statement
study was approved by the Human Research Ethics
This
Committee of Central South University (XYGW-2021-41). Written
informed consent was obtained before
interviews were
conducted.

Procedure and participants
Considering the development of community-based mental health
services and the economic status, four cities in southern China
(including Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) were
selected. This was a cross-sectional study, which was carried out
between April, 2021 and March, 2022. The sample size was
calculated based on the formula for cross-sectional study (N = Z2
× (P × [1–P])/E2). Assuming α = 0.05 (accordingly, Z = 1.96), P
(prevalence of high caregiver burden) = 40.00%21, and E (error)
=5.00%, which means a sample size of 369 was enough for
analysis. All administrative districts of the four cities were included
as our sampling frame. By using random number table method,
two districts were randomly selected in each city (a total of 8
districts in the four cities were selected), and 50% the community
health centers in each district (63/122) were randomly selected to
participated in our program, 45 of which (71.42%) were ﬁnally
involved in. In the 45 included community health centers, all the
eligible patients, and their caregivers (n = 1880) were invited to
their afﬁliated community health centers, where trained research-
ers went to conduct face-to-face interviews with them. Relevant
data were collected using a paper version of questionnaire that
included all measurement instruments and covariates. To ensure
the accuracy of the data, all staff who organized interviews had
received more than one month of professional training.

Inclusion criteria of

Inclusion criteria of individual with schizophrenia included: (1)
aged 18 or older; (2) with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia
(diagnosis by certiﬁed psychiatrists according to ICD-10 criteria);
(3) able to understand, read, and communicate with investigators
in Chinese; (4) lived with family members. Patients with missing
family caregivers
data were excluded.
included: (1) aged 16 or older; (2) the family member is living
with individual with schizophrenia and has taken the most
responsibility of caregiving; (3) able to understand, read, and
communicate with investigators in Chinese. Caregivers with
missing data were excluded. Finally, 972 patients were enrolled.
Of the 972 patients with schizophrenia approached cross 45
community health service centers, 104 patients with schizophre-
nia reported that they lived without any family members, which
were excluded. Among 868 individuals with schizophrenia lived
with family caregivers, 375 family caregivers refused to participant

in the program. Finally, 493 of family caregivers gave their written
informed consent and participated in the survey. Thus, 493 dyads
with no missing data were included in the current analysis.

Participants who completed the questionnaire were reimbursed
in cash, as a transportation

with RMB 20 yuan (about $ 3)
allowance.

Caregiver burden
To assess the caregiver burden of
the 493 included family
caregivers, the Zarit burden interview (ZBI-22)22 was used. The ZBI-
22 is a commonly used tool for assessing the caregiving burden in
clinical and research settings (Zarit et al., 1985), in which a total of
22 items were classiﬁed into 5 dimensions: six items for
relationship, seven items for emotional/well-being burden, four
items for social/family burden, one item for economic burden, and
four items for burden among life balance.

Participants rated the items on a 5-Likert scale with response
options of never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently and nearly
always, the score of each item ranged from 0 - 4. The total scores
of ZBI - 22 range from 0 to a maximum score of 88. As reported in
previous studies, a higher score indicates greater caregiver
burden. The Chinese version of ZBI - 22 was used in the current
study, which has reported favorable validity and reliability22,23. In
the current study, the Chinese version of ZBI - 22 indicated
acceptable internal consistency, the Cronbach’s α value was 0.96.

Disability
The 12-item WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS
2.0)24 was applied to measure participant’s level of disability,
which has been previously translated into Chinese and veriﬁed for
reliability and validity. The 12 questions were combined into six
components, with each component assigned a score of 0-4. The
six components including function for cognition, function for self-
care, function for mobility, function for daily life activity, function
for getting alone with others, and function for participation in the
society. The disability total score is the sum of scores of the six
components, ranging from 0 to 48, and a higher score indicating a
higher level of disability. In this study, the WHODAS 2.0 indicated a
good internal consistency, the Cronbach’s α value was 0.95.

Afﬁliate stigma
The Afﬁliate Stigma Scale (ASS) consists of 22 items that measure
the cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of afﬁliate
stigma (Winnie et al., 2008)25. This scale was developed to assess
afﬁliate stigma among caregivers of people with mental disorders
(or intellectual disabilities), which has been previously translated
into Mandarin and veriﬁed for reliability and validity20. The 22
items were combined into three domains, with each item assigned
a score of 0 - 4. The three domains including cognitive-related
stigma (including seven items), affect-related stigma (including
seven items), and behavior-related stigma (including eight items).
The total score of ASS ranging from 0 to 48, and a higher mean
score of the 22 items indicates a higher level of afﬁliate stigma. In
this study, the ASS scale indicated a good internal consistency, the
Cronbach’s α value was 0.96 in the 493 included caregivers.

Social support
The 12-item Multidimensional Scale of perceived social support
(MSPSS)26 was applied to measure caregivers’ perceived social
support from three different aspects, which including family-
related support (four items), friends-related support (four items),
and support came from signiﬁcant others (such as colleagues,
including four items). This scale was developed by Zimet in 1988.
Participants rated the items on a seven Likert scale with response
options of 1 = ‘very strongly disagree’ to 7 = ‘very strongly agree’,
the score of each item ranged from 1 - 7. The total scores of

MSPSS ranged from 12 to 84, with a higher score indicating a
greater total perceived social support. In this study, the Chinese
version of MSPSS scale indicated a good internal consistency, the
Cronbach’s α value was 0.98.

Potentially harmful behavior of patients
The Potentially harmful behavior scale (PHBS) was developed from
the Conﬂict Tactics Scale (Straus, 1979), which was developed by
Steinmetz in 1988. There were ﬁve indicators for psychological
mistreatment and ﬁve indicators for physical mistreatment were
assessed27. In this study, three indicators for psychological mistreat-
ment (including screaming and yelling, threatening with physical
force, and verbal abuse, such as using a harsh tone of voice, insulting,
calling names, and swearing) and four
indicators for physical
mistreatment (including hitting or slapping, shaking, handling roughly
in other ways, feeling afraid that patient might hit or try to hurt him/
her) were used to assess patient’s potentially harmful behavior (PHB).
Speciﬁcally, caregivers were asked to rate how often (0 = never and 4
= all the time) they have experienced the behavior by patients they
were caring for. Responses were summed to create a measure of PHB,
with a higher score representing a more frequent PHB of patients. In
this study, the Chinese version of PHBS scale indicated a good internal
consistency, the Cronbach’s α value was 0.96.

Covariates
Sociodemographic variables of patients including gender, age,
duration of disease, education level, marital status (married/single/
divorced/widowed), work status, were evaluated. See Table 3 for
the details. For caregivers, sociodemographic variables including
gender, age, duration of caring, education level, marital status
(married/single/divorced/widowed), long-term physical conditions
(yes or no), work status, were evaluated. See Table 3 for the details.

Statistical analyses
Data analysis was conducted by using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 23.0.
The differences between caregiver burden of Chinese family
caregivers were examined using the single factor t test and
variance analysis. Regression coefﬁcient and 95% conﬁdence
intervals were calculated to examine the associations between
patient’s disability and caregiver burden using linear regression
analysis28. For linear regression, the total score of caregiver burden
was used as the dependent variable29. In the adjusted regression
models, known and potential confounders were controlled.
Speciﬁcally, Model 1 was unadjusted model, Model 2 adjusted
for caregiver’s age, education level, work status, kinship, caregiv-
ing duration, and patients’ gender, onset duration, marital status,
and work status. All p-values refer to two-tailed tests and a
p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to examine the
correlations between patient’s disability, potentially harmful
behavior, caregiver’s perceived afﬁliate stigma, social support,
and caregiver burden. The mediation effects analysis was
conducted by using AMOS 23.0. The measurement model for
caregiver burden was tested by using conﬁrmatory factor analysis
(CFA), which examines the goodness of ﬁt of the underlying
constructs in our proposed mediation model. The hypothesized
directionality of the relationships among the constructs and
overall ﬁt of the mediation model were examined by using the
path analysis. To test how well the model ﬁtted the included data,
the results of χ2 test, the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), the comparative ﬁt index (CFI), and the non-normed ﬁt
index (NNFI) were reported. An RMSEA value smaller than 0.08,
both CFI and NNFI values > 0.85 mean a reasonable model ﬁt30. To
identify the mediation effects of patient’s potentially harmful
behavior, caregiver’s perceived afﬁliate stigma, and social support
for the associations between patient’s disability and caregiver

burden, bootstrap analysis (bias-corrected CIs based on 5000
resamples) was conducted31. A statistically signiﬁcant mediation
effect is observed when the 95% CI did not include zero32. The
proportion mediated (PM) was calculated to evaluate the effect
size of different paths in the mediation analysis for patient’s
disability and caregiver burden30.

RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
With completing the measurement of patient’s disability and
potentially harmful behavior, caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma, social
support, caregiver burden and related covariates as one of the
inclusion criteria, 493 patients with schizophrenia and their
caregivers were available for the ﬁnal analysis.

Specially, the mean age of individuals living with schizophrenia
was 46.59 years (S.D. = 13.99), most of them were older than 50
years old (58.77%), and 53.14% of the patients with schizophrenia
were female. About three quarters of the patients (74.04%) had an
onset duration more than 10 years, 46.86% were currently married
or cohabitating with someone.

Of the included 493 caregivers, the mean age of them was 57.26
years (S.D. = 12.95), most of them were older than 40 years old
(65.71%), and 49.09% of the caregivers were female. About three-
quarters of the caregivers (77.08%) reported a caregiving duration
more than 10 years, 86.62% were currently married or cohabitat-
ing with someone, 39.96% received primary education, and
31.03% had a full-time job (Table 1).

Associations between socio-demographics, PHB, stigma, social
support and caregiver burden
As presented in Table 1, caregiver with older age, lower education
level, have no job, were parents of patients, with longer caregiving
duration were signiﬁcantly associated with higher
level of
caregiver burden (p < 0.05). Also, patients who were male, with
longer onset duration, were single, have no job, were associated
with higher level of caregiver burden (p < 0.05). These demo-
graphic variables that signiﬁcantly associated with the dependent
variables were included in the adjusted models.

The adjusted regression results showed that patients’ higher level
of disability (B = 0.616; 95% CI: 0.479–0.753), PHB on caregivers
(B = 0.474; 95% CI: 0.232–0.716), and caregiver’s low social support
(B = −0.079; 95% CI: −0.158–−0.002), higher level of afﬁliate stigma
(B = 13.045; 95% CI: 10.227–15.864) were associated with higher level
of caregiver burden (p < 0.05) (Table 2). See Table 2 for the details.

Correlations among the variables
The Pearson’s correlation analysis (Table 3) showed that patient’s
disability was positively correlated with patient’s PHB on
caregivers, caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma, caregiver’s social support,
and caregiver burden (r = 0.322, 0.254, −0.298, and 0.539),
respectively. Patient’s PHB on caregiver was signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma (r = 0.287), caregiver’s social
support (r = −0.162), and caregiver burden (r = 0.391), respec-
tively. Caregiver’s perceived afﬁliate stigma was also signiﬁcantly
(r = −0.349) and
correlated with caregiver’s
social
caregiver burden (r = 0.512). Caregiver’s social support was
signiﬁcantly correlated with caregiver burden (r = −0.348).

As hypothesized, the direct path from patient’s disability to
caregiver burden (β = 0.371, p < 0.001) was signiﬁcant and positive.
Higher level of disability was associated with increased frequency of
potentially harmful behavior (β = 0.310, p < 0.001), afﬁliate stigma
(β = 0.098, p < 0.05), and lower level of social support (β = −0.279,
p < 0.001). Higher level of potentially harmful behavior was associated
level of afﬁliate stigma (β = 0.229, p < 0.001), and
with higher
caregiver burden (β = 0.158, p < 0.001). Lower level of social support
was associated with higher level of afﬁliate stigma (β = −0.288,
p < 0.001), and caregiver burden (β = −0.093, p < 0.05). Also, higher
level of afﬁliate stigma was associated with higher level of caregiver
burden (β = 0.368, p < 0.001). The association between potentially
harmful behavior and social support was not signiﬁcant (p > 0.05).

Bootstrapping analyses indicated that patient’s disability was
indirectly associated with caregiver burden through patient’s PHM
to caregiver (β = 0.049, p < 0.01, PM = 9.12%). Further analyses
showed that patient’s disability was indirectly associated with
caregiver burden through patient’s PHM to caregiver and caregiver’s

afﬁliate stigma (β = 0.026, p < 0.01, PM = 4.84%). Also, patient’s
disability was indirectly associated with caregiver burden through
caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma (β = 0.036, p < 0.05, PM = 6.70%), and
further analyses showed that patient’s disability was indirectly
associated with caregiver burden through caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma
and caregiver’s social support (β = 0.029, p < 0.01, PM = 5.40%.
Lastly, patient’s disability was indirectly associated with caregiver

potentially harmful behavior, caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma, and social
support mediated the relationship between patients’ disability
and caregiver burden. Patient’s disability was indirectly associated
with caregiver burden through 5 paths,
the standardized
regression coefﬁcients, β value ranged from 0.026 to 0.049
(p < 0.05). The mediation effects of patient’s PHM to caregiver and
caregiver’s social support for the associations between patient’s
disability and caregiver burden was not signiﬁcant (p > 0.05).

Mediation effects of patient’s PHB
Globally, few studies have explored the associations between
disability of patients with schizophrenia and care burden among
their family caregivers, the evidence is limited. Kumar et al. found
in their study that caregiver burden is associated with disability in
schizophrenia15, with a higher level of disability was associated
with higher level of caregiver burden. The ﬁndings in this study
demonstrate that patient’s disability had a direct effect on
caregiver burden of Chinese family caregivers, which was
consistent with previous ﬁndings.

Refer to the indirect effect of patient’s disability on caregiver
burden of Chinese family caregivers, we found that patient’s
disability could impact patient’s potentially harmful behavior to
caregiver and further increase caregiver burden. Several studies
have indicated a high prevalence of violent behavior among
inpatients with mental disorder, explored the associations

between severity of their disease and prevalence of violent
behavior33,34. There is little awareness of
family violence by
outpatients with severe mental
illness, and few studies have
addressed this issue33. It is said that family caregivers were most
likely to be the targets of patient-perpetrated violence35, which
constitutes a particular burden for caregivers, yet remains largely
overlooked18. This study provides some new evidence, indicated
that the impact of potentially harmful behaviors of patients
(including potentially physical, verbal, and psychological violence/
abuse) on the associations between patients’ disability and
caregiver burden, which was consistent with previous opinions18.
Considering that family violence of patients with severe mental
illness may lead to violence-related negative health outcomes in
family caregivers (such as suicide), we believe more research is
needed in the future, which will contributed to decrease the
burden of severe mental illness.

Mediation effects of caregiver’s afﬁliate stigma
Individuals who have disabilities and their families are vulnerable
to daily acts of discriminatory treatment that continue throughout
their daily lives, which may then increase caregivers’ perceived
stigma36,37. According to Pearlin’s caregiver stress model in 1989,
the behavior problems of patients with severe mental illness often
give rise to some secondary stressors for family members, such as
stigmatizing interactions. As a source of chronic stress for family

caregivers, the stigmatization of mental illness in family caregivers
can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as
cardiovascular health issues, depression, burn out, and low life
satisfaction20,37. These negative health outcomes,
in turn, may
consequently lead to a greater care burden and lower quality of
family care20. In this study, patient’s disability could increase the
level of caregiver’s perceived stigma and further
increase
caregiver burden. Furthermore, patient’s disability could impact
patient’s potentially harmful behavior, then increase the level of
caregivers’ afﬁliate stigma and further increase caregiver burden.
Thus, anti-stigma interventions to reduce stigma’s negative impact
among Chinese family caregivers of people with severe mental
illness are key for the future38.

Mediation effects of caregiver’s social support
We also found that patient’s disability could decrease the level of
caregiver’s social support and further increase caregiver burden.
Social support plays an important role in reducing not only
physical burden, but also psychological burden in the family
caregivers39. Several studies have summarized related determi-
nants of family caregiving burden, they found that the depen-
dency level of the care recipient is the most important predictor of
care burden, and the dependency level of the care recipient was
reported to associated with the severity of illness40. At the same
time, social support acts as a protector between care stressors and
caregiving burdens. However, caregiver social support is often
negatively affected by the severity of the patient’s illness. This
refers to the fact that as the severity of the disease increases,
patients and their families may feel more social isolation, poorer
family functioning, and the ability and opportunity to seek social
support may be negatively affected7,40–42.

To sum up, the ﬁndings in our path analysis further conﬁrms the
negative impact of patient’s condition on caregivers’ social
support and caregiving burden. And, the relationship between
low social support and high caregiver burden and their signiﬁcant
effect on the disease course indicates a vicious cycle that affects
patients living with schizophrenia, their family caregivers, and the
clinical course of the disease13,40. The mediation effect of social
support also indicates that when these family caregivers are
provided sufﬁcient social support to meet their needs, perceived
afﬁliate stigma of caregivers may be correspondingly decreased,
which in turn leads to a reduction in the burden of care43.

Future implications
As one of the countries with high burden of mental disorders44, the
Chinese government was eager to establish a community-based
comprehensive mental health system as early as 20 years ago,
emphasizing the urgent need to improve community-based mental
health services45,46. Although the prevalence of severe mental illness
is high in China, the Chinese health system resources have not yet
sufﬁciently responded to the burden of severe mental
illness46.
Family caregivers still play a crucial role in mental health care in
China. Considering the high level of caregiver burden reported by
family caregivers in this study, the Chinese health system should
take effective measures,
improve the availability of community-
based mental health services and mental health resources, reducing
the burden of care and ultimately contributing to improved social
functioning of patients47,48.

Currently, an important goal in the ﬁeld of global mental health
is to develop evidence-based interventions that target not only
the individual living with schizophrenia, but also for the whole
family49. Based on our ﬁndings, we believe there is a particular
need for effective interventions to improve the occupational skills
and functioning of patients and caregivers in daily household
tasks, and to further assist family caregivers in organizing these

changes of patient’s potentially harmful behavior, caregivers’ social
support, afﬁliate stigma on caregiver burden is warranted. To ensure
the study was accessible to participants with a range of difﬁculties,
travel expenses were paid (¥20). Attempts were made to include
participants who are hospitalized. For individuals in the community,
participants are personally invited through telephone invitations.
Despite these efforts, some patients refused to participate in the
program, which may have affected the results.

CONCLUSION
Patient’s potentially harmful behavior, caregiver’s perceived afﬁliate
stigma, and social support mediated the relationship between
patients’ disability and caregiver burden. Future intervention studies
which be designed aiming at the three factors may be beneﬁcial for
family caregivers of persons living with schizophrenia. Firstly, there is
a particular need for effective interventions to improve the
occupational skills and functioning of both patients and caregivers
in daily household tasks. Furthermore, interventions to assist family
caregivers in organizing these caregiving tasks and promote patient
engagement is also crucial for reduce the burden of care. Lastly,
taking measures targeting family members are important in the
ﬁght against the stigmatization of serious mental disorders, which
could help to reducing the burden of care.
