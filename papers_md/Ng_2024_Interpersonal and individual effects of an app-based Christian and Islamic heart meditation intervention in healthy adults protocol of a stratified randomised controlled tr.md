Abstract 
Background  The academic development and widespread adoption of meditation practices for well-being 
and therapy have predominantly focused on secularised adaptations of Buddhist and Hindu techniques. This study 
aims to expand the field by investigating Christian and Islamic meditation that emphasize the spiritual significance 
of the heart through elements of visualisation and recitation. It compares the effects of spiritual heart-centred medita-
tion with mindfulness meditation and a waitlist control, focusing on dimensions of social functioning, psychophysiol-
ogy, cognition, and mental health.

Method  This study employs a stratified 3-arm randomised controlled method with mixed-method repeated meas-
ures across three assessment time points: before intervention (T1), after an 8-week intervention (T2), and at a 3-month 
follow up (T3). The three conditions include spiritual meditation (either Christian or Islamic), mindfulness meditation 
(Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction – MBSR), and a waitlist. Participants will be stratified into Christian and Muslim 
samples and randomly allocated to the spiritual meditation, MBSR, or waitlist control conditions. Importantly, partici-
pants assigned to the spiritual meditation condition will be matched to the spiritual meditation program correspond-
ing to their religion. The intervention will be administered through a mobile phone app with daily 20-minute guided 
meditation sessions for eight weeks. Primary outcomes pertain to the domain of interpersonal functioning, focusing 
on prosociality, forgiveness, empathy, and perspective taking. Secondary outcomes include physiology: pain toler-
ance, pain intensity, stress reactivity assessed via heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), psychophysiological 
reactivity associated with a forgiveness task as measured through HR and HRV, attention (alerting, orienting, and exec-
utive attention networks), and mental health (stress, depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, positive and negative 
affect).

Discussion  This trial aims to test the effects of an app-based Christian and Islamic meditation, compared to secular 
mindfulness and a waitlist, using a randomised controlled trial. If the results yield positive outcomes, this study will

Background and rationale
Contemplative  practices  have  gained  significant  popu-
larity since the 1970s [1, 2]. Mindfulness meditation has 
found  a  place  among  therapeutic  settings,  where  practi-
tioners  employ  it  as  a  strategy  to  promote  wellbeing  [3, 
4].  Derived  from  Buddhist  and  Hindu  traditions,  mind-
fulness  and  Transcendental  Meditation  are,  by  far,  the 
most  widely  researched  techniques  of  contemplative 
practices  [1],  with  evidence  suggesting  that  its  practice 
can  help  improve  mental  health  [5,  6],  attention  [7,  8], 
and  pain  management  [1,  9].  However,  the  field  of  con-
templative  studies  has  overwhelmingly  used  secularised 
adaptations of meditation practices [1]. Recent criticisms 
of  the  present  ‘monoculture  of  mindfulness’  in  contem-
plative science remind us of the extraordinary diversity of 
such practices across religious traditions, which remains 
largely unstudied [1, 10, 11]. 

While  the  focus  of  therapeutic  meditation  techniques 
has been on the reduction of stress generated by postin-
dustrial  life  [12],  religious  meditation  strives  primar-
ily for a deep transformation of the self, where ordinary 
and  self-oriented  concerns  are  replaced  by  spiritual  and 
prosocial  oriented  goals  [13–15].  Although  there  is  a 
large  body  of  research  that  consistently  shows  positive 
outcomes  of  religious  practice  on  health  and  well-being 
[16], surprisingly, there has been little interest in studying 
the effects of religious forms of meditation.

Another  gap  in  the  curent  contemplative  science  lit-
erature is the study of prosocial effects. Given that these 
techniques were originally intended to motivate individu-
als  to  shift  their  self-serving  interests  towards  spiritual 
and  other-centred  aims,  the  potential  prosocial  effects 
of these practices ought to be more consistently studied. 
Despite  the  growth  of  such  studies  focusing  on  mind-
fulness,  loving-kindness,  and  compassion  meditation 
[17–19],  this  research  has  rarely  addressed  traditional 
meditation  practices,  although  there  has  been  limited 
research into the effects of Christian prayer on prosocial-
ity tendencies [20], charitable giving [21], and the cultiva-
tion of forgiveness and empathy [22, 23]. 

Within Christian and Islamic traditions, which are the 
two largest Abrahamic religions worldwide, contempla-
tive  practices  often  seek  to  induce  strong  emotions, 

such  as  joy,  love,  and  repentance,  while  engaging  in 
recitation,  visualisation,  and  breathing,  with  the  aims 
of  perfecting  oneself  and  deepening  one’s  relationship 
with  God  [24–27].  Such  an  approach  contrasts  with 
mindfulness  meditation,  which  seeks  to  attain  states 
of  calmness  through  techniques  designed  to  mitigate 
emotional reactivity [28]. 

One  important  aspect  that  is  common  to  Christianity 
and  Islam  is  the  symbolic  role  played  by  the  heart  [29], 
as  evidenced  by  its  scriptures  [30–32]  and  contempla-
tive  practices  [33–35].  There  are  various  Christian  and 
Islamic  meditation  practices  that  attribute  particu-
lar  attention  to  the  heart.  For  example,  in  the  Christian 
Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  practice,  individuals  contemplate 
the sacred heart of Jesus through visualisation alongside 
prayer recitation. Devotion to Jesus’ heart directs an indi-
vidual’s  heart  towards  receiving  and  reciprocating  Jesus’ 
love  [27,  33].  In  Islam,  The  Brilliance  of  Hearts  medita-
tion combines visualisation exercises with prayer recita-
tion  and  strong  emotional  emphasis  on  the  expression 
of love for God [26, 34]. Despite their particularities and 
varieties  of  expression,  both  traditions  share  elements 
at  the  technical  level  (heart  focus),  in  aim  (closeness  to 
God and transforming the self ), and in stimulating strong 
emotions (e.g. devotion, repentance, love). While there is 
growing  evidence  showing  the  positive  effects  of  Chris-
tian (and, to a lesser extent, Islamic) religious practices on 
physical  and  mental  health,  such  as  reducing  stress  [36, 
37],  pain  [38],  and  cardiovascular  risk  [39],  the  experi-
mental evidence on the salutary effects of Christian and 
Islamic contemplation techniques is extremetly limited.

Given  the  plethora  of  studies  on  the  effects  of  mind-
fulness  meditation,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  extremely 
limited  literature  on  Christian  and  Islamic  meditation, 
this study proposes a mixed methods approach to under-
standing  how  these  latter  traditional  forms  of  medita-
tion might impact individuals. Hence, the study includes 
psychophysiology,  cognition,  social  functioning,  and 
mental  health  outcomes.  In  addition,  because  of  the 
spiritual  aims  of  these  practices,  which  are  expected  to 
effect changes in how one perceives oneself and behaves 
towards others, the study also includes measures of relig-
iosity.  The  choice  of  variables  to  study  was  guided  both

by  the  current  state  of  the  meditation  literature  (for  a 
summary,  see  Oman  [1])  and  by  the  particular  charac-
teristics and aims of Christian and Islamic contemplative 
practices.

Research question and hypotheses
This study addresses the effects of heart-centred medita-
tion from the Christian and Islamic traditions, compared 
to  secular  practices,  on  social  functioning,  physiology, 
cognition, and mental health. The key question is whether 
the regular practice of Christian or Islamic heart-centred 
contemplation fosters positive outcomes at the interper-
sonal  and  the  individual  levels,  as  compared  to  a  stand-
ardised  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  intervention 
(MBSR) and a waitlist control condition.

To  address  these  questions,  this  study  will  develop 
(a)  an  8-week  intervention  based  on  heart-centered 
Christian  and  Islamic  contemplative  practices;  (b)  a 
stratified  3-arm  randomised  controlled  trial  (RCT)  with 
contemplations (Christian and Islamic), an active control 
(MBSR)  and  a  waitlist  control.  The  contemplation  and 
MBSR programs will be delivered through a mobile app.

We hypothesise that when compared to baseline, indi-
viduals  undertaking  the  heart-centred  contemplative 
practices  will  show:  (1)  greater  prosociality,  forgiveness, 
empathy,  and  perspective  taking;  (2)  increased  pain  tol-
erance  and  attention,  and  reduced  subjective  ratings  of 
pain  intensity,  reduced  stress  reactivity  as  measured  by 
HR and HRV, and reduced psychophysiological reactivity 
associated with forgiveness as measured by HR and HRV; 
(3)  reduced  self-reported  stress,  depression,  anxiety;  (4) 
increased subjective wellbeing and positive affect as well 
as reduced negative affect. We also hypothesise that these 
outcomes  will  be  greater  for  participants  in  the  heart-
centred  contemplations  compared  to  those  in  the  wait-
list  control  condition.  We  have  no  specific  predictions 
for comparing the outcome of the religious (Christian or 
Islamic) versus MBSR interventions.

Methods
Trial design

The study employs the Standard Protocol Items Recom-
mendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [40] as the 
reporting guideline for this protocol and adheres to Con-
solidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [41] 
to ensure quality in study planning, implementation, and 
reporting.

Figure  1  and  Table  1  show  the  study  procedure  and 
the setup of the randomised control trial. This is a 3-arm 
stratified  randomised  controlled  trial,  with  four  groups 
distributed across two variants of the spiritual meditation 
condition  (Christian  and  Islamic),  MBSR,  and  a  waitlist 
control condition. Participants will be first stratified into 

Christian  and  Muslim  samples  and  then  randomly  allo-
cated to one of the three conditions. Individuals assigned 
to the spiritual meditation condition will be further strat-
ified into either a Christian or an Islamic contemplation 
subgroup within the spiritual meditation condition based 
on their religious affiliations.

Participants  in  the  spiritual  meditation  groups  and  the 
secular  mindfulness  group  will  receive  8-week  interven-
tions,  commencing  with  an  initial  face-to-face  meeting, 
where they will practice the first session of the guided medi-
tation course using the mobile app. Following that, they will 
continue  with  daily  guided  practices  lasting  approximately 
20  min  through  the  app.  Assessment  will  be  held  at  three 
time points including pre-intervention (T1, baseline), after 
the  8-week  intervention  (T2),  and  three  months  after  the 
intervention (T3). Participants in the waitlist control group 
will only attend the assessments at T1 and T2, as due to eth-
ical reasons they will be given the option to start using the 
Christian or Islamic meditation App after testing at T2.

Setting
The pilot study took place in the lab at Coventry Univer-
sity, in England. The main trial will be conducted at two 
university  Colleges  in  the  state  of  Kerala,  India,  where 
there  are  large  Christian  and  Muslim  populations  who 
are  proficient  in  English.  Two  designated  rooms  at  each 
College will be used as laboratories for data collection.

Participants
Power analysis

This study will recruit non-clinical samples of 144 Chris-
tian  and  144  Islamic  healthy  adult  participants.  An  a 
priori  power  analysis  was  conducted  using  the  G*Power 
software (V.3.1) [42], considering four groups with mixed 
method repeated measures at three timepoints. The cal-
culation  was  conducted  based  on  a  small  effect  size  of 
f2 = 0.1,  with  an  alpha  value  of  0.05,  a  desired  power  of 
β = 0.85.  Effect  size  was  set  at  0.1  using  a  conservative 
approach due to the novel nature of the study to examine 
the  effects  of  Christian  and  Islamic  contemplation.  Cal-
culation was applied to determine the total sample size of 
288  participants  with  (n = 72)  per  group,  after  adjusting 
for an estimated dropout rate of 10%.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion  criteria  are:  (1)  18  to  60  years  old;  (2)  able  to 
read,  speak,  and  understand  English;  (3)  willing  to  be 
assigned to any condition, with religious affiliation limit-
ing  allocation  to  either  the  Christian  or  Islamic  type  of 
spiritual meditation condition; (4) consider oneself to be 
a Christian or Muslim and pray at least weekly.

Exclusion criteria are: (1) currently suffering from any 
mental health conditions or using medication to manage

mental  health  conditions;  (2)  having  long-term  serious 
physical medical problem, such as liver, brain, kidney, or 
other  life-threatening  chronic  diseases;  (3)  having  a  his-
tory  of  a  heart  condition,  high  blood  pressure,  Raynaud 
syndrome, diabetes, or musculoskeletal condition; (4) the 
current use of anxiolytics or mood stabilizers [43]. 

Recruitment, screening, and enrolment
The recruitment process started on 22 July 2024. Non-clinical 
samples  of  Christian  and  Islamic  healthy  adult  participants 
will  be  recruited  and  enrolled  from  the  local  institutions 
through their internal participant pools, online adverts, dis-
tributing flyers, and collaboration with religious communities.

Page 6 of 15

Potential  participants  will  be  contacted  via  email 
with  detailed  information  in  a  written  form  and  will  be 
required to fill out a pre-screening online questionnaire. 
Their self-reports will be assessed through inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria  to  determine  their  eligibility.  The  rea-
son  for  ineligibility  will  be  retained  in  accordance  with 
CONSORT standards [41]. 

Eligible  participants  will  receive  information  about 
the  study  including  its  objective  and  procedures.  Sub-
sequently,  research  team  member  will  ask  participants 
to  provide  informed  consent  for  study  enrolment.  All 
enrolled  participants  will  be  invited  to  take  part  in  the 
baseline  assessment  (T1)  and  the  follow-up  assessment 
(T2) with measures of social functioning, physiology, and 
cognition.  A  set  of  online  measures  concerning  mental 
health,  religiosity,  socioeconomic  status,  demographics, 
social value orientation, and meditation social desirabil-
ity will be taken at home before T1. Additionally, partici-
pants  in  the  religious  contemplation  groups  and  MBSR 
will attend an online 3-month follow up assessment. All 
participants  will  be  compensated  with  an  INR  2,000  as 
compensation for their time.

Randomisation and allocation

First,  participants  will  be  stratified  into  Christian  and 
Islamic  samples.  They  will  then  be  randomly  assigned 
to  the  spiritual  meditation  (either  Christian  or  Islamic 
meditation, with religious affiliation restricting allocation 
to either the Christian or Islamic type of contemplation), 
MBSR,  or  waitlist  control,  utilizing  a  random  number 
generator  produced  by  a  computer  and  allocated  to  one 
of the four groups. To ensure allocation concealment, the 
allocation process will be carried out by a researcher who 
is independent of the trial team.

Blinding

Neither the participants nor assessors can be completely 
blinded  given  that  it  is  not  possible  to  create  a  pseudo-
Christian  or  Islamic  meditation  condition.  To  reduce 
potential biases, participants will be blind to the specific 
study hypotheses, and will only have access to the medi-
tation  app  version  exclusively  for  their  assigned  groups. 
Additionally, the researcher responsible for the randomi-
sation  and  allocation  process  will  not  participate  in  the 
recruitment,  assessment,  or  data  analysis.  Considering 
that the trial will not involve any harmful procedure, and 
participants  will  be  informed  about  the  three  arms  dur-
ing  the  recruitment  stage,  procedure  for  unblinding  is 
not required for this trial.

will be delivered through an initial face-to-face meeting, 
where  participants  will  initiate  the  first  session  of  the 
guided  meditation  course  using  the  mobile  app.  Subse-
quently,  they  will  continue  with  daily  guided  practices 
lasting approximately 20 min through the app over eight 
weeks.  The  initial  meeting  will  start  at  the  end  of  the 
baseline  assessment  (T1).  Participants  will  only  be  able 
to access the app intervention that they are allocated to. 
Participants in the waitlist control group will not receive 
any  types  of  intervention  and  will  not  attend  the  T3 
assessment, but they will be given access to the Christian 
or  Islamic  meditation  app  version  upon  completion  of 
the in-person T2 assessment.

Intervention content

All  interventions  will  be  delivered  through  an  8-week 
program  of  daily  audio-guided  meditations  of  approxi-
mately  20-minutes.  There  will  be  a  total  of  eight  differ-
ent meditations per condition, one per week, where each 
meditation is repeated across seven days. To ensure par-
ticipant  engagement  in  the  meditation  practice,  the  app 
will unlock the next session for the participant only after 
completing  the  preceding  day’s  session.  Similarly,  pro-
gression  to  the  next  week’s  meditation  session  requires 
completing at least four sessions in the preceding week. 
The  app  will  track  participants’  completion  of  practice 
sessions and record daily responses to two brief questions 
about mood and meditation experience. Participants can 
maintain their daily religious practices during the 8-week 
program.

Heart‑centred spiritual meditations

The spiritual meditation programs were developed from 
techniques  based  on  Christian  and  Islamic  traditions. 
The  primary  elements  of  the  practices  consist  of  main-
taining  attention  and  emotional  connection  to  God 
through  visualisation  and  recitation.  Concurrently  these 
practices are expected to promote a moving away or tran-
scendence from everyday concerns. Breathing is included 
as an added ingredient to help focus participants’ atten-
tion  during  the  first  part  of  each  meditation.  Although 
Christian  and  Islamic  contemplations  are  typically  not 
standardised within their respective contemplative tradi-
tions, for this study we had to develop specific scripts to 
be used by participants. These were developed by Chris-
tian  and  Islamic  expert  members  of  the  research  team, 
and subsequently edited by the lead researchers with the 
guidance  of  an  expert  in  writing  content  for  meditation 
Apps (see acknowledgements section).

Study interventions

The  spiritual  meditation  interventions  and  MBSR  will 
have the same structure and time frame. All interventions 

Mindfulness‑based stress reduction

A separate MBSR program was developed by a certified 
instructor who has experience in working for meditation 

Ng et al. BMC Psychology          (2024) 12:509 

Page 7 of 15

Apps.  The  MBSR  program  includes  an  8-week  pro-
gram  of  daily  audio-guided  mindfulness  practice  lasting 
approximately 20 min, based on the manual developed by 
John Kabat-Zinn [44]. 

Waitlist condition

Participants  assigned  to  the  waitlist  control  condition 
will  take  part  in  the  assessments  at  T1  and  T2  but  will 
not  participate  in  any  of  the  interventions.  They  will  be 
given  access  to  either  the  Christian  or  Islamic  spiritual 
meditation  app  version  after  they  complete  the  assess-
ment at T2.

Study variables

Table  2  provides  a  summary  of  the  variable  domains, 
study  variables,  measures,  assessment  time  points  and 
the types of data collection method for each variable.

Primary outcomes

The study is primarily assessing changes in interpersonal 
functioning, measured through prosociality, forgiveness, 
empathy,  and  perspective  taking.  Prosociality  will  be 
assessed at T1 and T2 via the Dictator Game (DG) [45], 
Social Value Orientation (SVO) [46], and Charitable Giv‑
ing  (at  T2  only).  Empathy  and  forgiveness  variables  will 
be  collected  via  the  task  Love  thy  Enemy  (adapted  from 
Witvliet et al. [47]) at both T1 and T2. Perspective taking 
will be obtained online at T1, T2, and T3.

Dictator  Game  (DG)  [45]:  This  computer-based  task 
allocates  ten  game  points  to  participants  and  asks  them 
to  decide  how  many  of  these  points  they  would  like  to 
transfer  to  an  anonymous  participant.  The  outcome 
measure  is  the  number  of  game  points  participants  are 
willing to allocate to the anonymous individual. The game 
points retained by participants will have no influence on 
their real-life earnings or their compensation fee for tak-
ing part in the experiment. Prior studies have shown that 
individuals  engage  in  prosocial  activities  irrespective  of 
monetary incentives [48, 49]. 

Social  Value  Orientation  (SVO)  [46]:  This  online  task 
consists  of  six  items  with  which  participants  are  asked 
to  assign  game  points  for  themselves  and  an  anony-
mous  other.  Participants  will  make  their  allocations  by 
adjusting  a  slider  to  indicate  their  most  preferred  joint 
distribution  between  themselves  and  the  other.  A  con-
tinuous  social  value  orientation  score  will  be  computed 
from these six items based on participants’ choices. The 
outcome  measure  will  be  a  single  overall  SVO  score.  A 
higher  SVO  score  represents  a  higher  prosocial  prefer-
ence.  The  game  points  kept  by  the  participants  will  not 
affect  their  real-life  earnings  or  their  compensation  fee 
for taking part in the experiment.

Charitable  giving  Participants  will  be  given  a  choice 
to  allocate  a  part  of  their  compensation  fee  to  a  charity 
(ranging from 0 to 100%). The prosocial outcome meas-
ure  will  be  the  percentage  of  the  fee  they  are  willing  to 
allocate  to  a  charity  (Christian  or  Islamic,  based  on  the 
participant’s religious affiliation).

Love thy enemy task (adapted from Witvliet et al. [47]): 
In  this  forgiveness  task  participants  will  focus  on  an 
enemy  who  has  deeply  hurt  them;  self-reported  empa-
thy and forgiveness are assessed, alongside HR and HRV 
to  measure  psychophysiological  reactivity  associated 
with  forgiving  the  offending  individual.  Participants  will 
first  be  asked  to  think  of  an  individual  who  has  deeply 
hurt them. They will then write down the initials of that 
person’s  name,  as  well  as  when  and  where  the  specific 
incident  happened  on  a  piece  of  paper,  which  they  will 
subsequently seal in an envelope (the envelop will remain 
sealed until T2, when participants will be asked to recall 
the  same  individual  and  incident).  After  writing  down 
this  information,  participants  will  indicate  the  level  of 
closeness they feel towards that individual (adapted from 
Aron et al. [50]). Once participants indicate the relation-
ship with the person, they will proceed to the task, which 
consists of three phases: baseline, imagery, and recovery. 
In the baseline and recovery phrases (20 s for each), par-
ticipants will be instructed to close their eyes and relax. 
In the imagery phase (40 s of duration) participants will 
be prompted to imagine themselves forgiving the person 
who  hurt  them.  After  the  recovery  phase,  participants 
will rate their level of empathy towards that person (on a 
scale of 0–20) and the extent to which they feel they have 
forgiven the person during the task (on a scale of 0–20). 
The task will consist of four repeated trials.

Perspective Taking [51]: The 7-item Perspective Tak-
ing  subscale  from  the  Interpersonal  Reactivity  Index 
(IRI)  will  be  used  to  assess  participants’  tendency 
to  take  others’  points  of  view  using  a  5-point  Likert 
scale, ranging from A (Does not describe me well) to E 
(Describes me very well). Higher scores indicate greater 
perspective-taking.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary  outcomes  encompass  domains  of  physiology, 
attention, and mental health. Measures pertaining to the 
physiological  and  attention  domains  will  be  obtained  at 
T1 and T2, while those related to mental health domain 
will be collected across all timepoints (T1, T2 and T3).

Physiological domain

Pain  tolerance,  pain  intensity,  and  stress  reactivity  (HR 
and  HRV)  will  be  assessed  using  a  cold  pressor  task 
(adapted  from  a  previous  spiritual  intervention  study

[52]). Participants will immerse their non-dominant hand 
in the cold water at 2 °C to 3 °C. They will be instructed 
to endure the pain for as long as they can tolerate, up to 
a  maximum  of  4  min,  with  an  option  to  remove  it  any 
time  if  the  pain  becomes  unbearable.  HR  and  HRV  will 
be  continuously  measured  throughout  the  task.  After 
removing  their  hand  from  the  cold  water,  participants 
will  rate  their  average  pain  intensity  experienced  during 
the task ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imagina-
ble pain).  A 5-minute resting  state HR  and  HRV will be 
measured before the task, with another 5-minute HR and 
HRV  measurement  starting  1  min  after  the  end  of  the 
cold pressor task. Custom computer software will record 
the duration (in seconds) that a participant endures pain-
ful  stimulation  during  the  cold  pressor  task  as  well  as 
HR and HRV. The four variables assessed include (1) the 
duration  of  cold-water  endurance  (pain  tolerance),  (2) 
differences  in  HR  and  HRV  before,  during  and  after  the 
task (stress reactivity), and (3) the average subjective pain 
intensity.

For HR and HRV measurement, participants will wear 
a Polar H10 heart rate sensor [53] around their chest to 
measure  HR  and  interbeat  intervals  for  quantifying  the 
metric  of  root  mean  square  of  successive  RR  interval 
differences  (RMSSD)  for  HRV.  A  software  program  has 
been  customized  to  interface  with  the  modified  version 
of the OpenHRV application [54]. 

Attention domain

Posner  and  Petersen  [55]  identified  three  distinct  net-
works  linked  to  different  aspects  of  attention:  one  for 
alerting,  involving  right  frontal  and  parietal  regions; 
another  for  orienting  with  frontal  and  parietal  lobe 
involvement;  and  a  third  for  executive  control  linked  to 
the  anterior  cingulate  and  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cor-
tex. The Attention Network Task (ANT) was designed to 
assess the efficiency of each network through behavioural 
data  [56].  This  study  uses  the  10-minute  version  of  the 
ANT (adapted from the attention network task) [56, 57]. 
Throughout the task, a fixation cross will be presented 
in  the  centre  of  the  screen.  Brief  cue  stimuli,  lasting  for 
100ms,  will  appear  above  or  below  the  fixation  cross 

(spatial  cue),  with  two  cues  -  one  above  and  the  other 
below the fixation cross (double cue), at the centre of the 
fixation  cross  (centre  cue),  or  not  at  all  (no  cue).  These 
cues  will  consistently  precede  the  target  presentation. 
Centre  and  double  cues  provide  timing  information 
regarding  when  the  target  will  appear,  concerning  alert-
ing  attention,  while  spatial  cues  also  indicate  where  the 
upcoming  target  would  be,  involving  orienting  network. 
The  target  stimuli  consist  of  five  horizontally  arranged 
arrows,  positioned  above  or  below  the  fixation  cross, 
with  a  maximum  duration  of  1500ms.  Participants  are 
instructed  to  press  the  left  or  right  arrow  key  on  their 
keyboard  to  indicate  the  direction  of  the  central  arrow, 
regardless  of  the  flanking  conditions,  with  all  arrows 
either  pointing  in  the  same  direction  (congruent  flank-
ers)  or  pointing  in  different  direction  from  the  central 
arrows  (incongruent  flanks).  Reaction  time  (RT)  differ-
ence  across  task  conditions  serve  as  outcome  measures, 
which reflect the engagement of corresponding attention 
network,  with  a  faster  RT  indicating  a  greater  alerting, 
orienting, or executive control of attention, depending on 
the task type.

Mental health domain

This  domain  includes  measures  of  stress,  depression, 
anxiety,  subjective  welling,  and  positive  and  negative 
affect.

Stress,  depression,  and  anxiety:  These  variables  will 
be  assessed  using  the  21-item  Depression,  Anxiety  and 
Stress Scale (DASS-21) [58]. Previous research has indi-
cated  that  the  DASS-21  exhibits  comparable  levels  of 
internal consistency across various cultures and countries 
[59, 60]. The scale comprises three subscales: depression, 
anxiety,  and  stress,  each  comprising  seven  items.  Par-
ticipants will rate how they feel over the preceding week 
using  a  4-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  0  to  3,  where 
0 indicates “Did not apply to me at all” and 3 represents 
“Applied  to  me  very  much  or  most  of  the  time”.  Total 
subscale  scores  will  be  computed  by  summing  all  item 
responses,  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  symp-
tom severity.

Ng et al. BMC Psychology          (2024) 12:509

Subjective  well-being  (WHO-5)  [61]:  The  WHO-5 
comprises  five  items  that  requires  participants  to  assess 
their  feelings  over  the  preceding  two  weeks  using  a 
6-item  Likert  scale  ranging  from  0  to  5,  where  0  rep-
resents  “At  no  time”  and  5  indicates  “All  of  the  time”.  A 
higher score indicates a greater sense of wellbeing.

Positive  and  negative  affect  (I-PANAS-SF)  [62]:  This 
consists of a 10-item scale with higher scores indicating 
greater positive or negative affect.

Participants rate their involvement (ORA and NORA) on 
a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 6 (More 
than once a week) for two items, and their religious beliefs 
or experiences (IR) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 
1 (Definitely not true) to 5 (Definitely true of me). Higher 
scores indicate a stronger religiosity.

Control variables

Mood  A  1-item  Smiley  Face  Likert  scale  within  the 
meditation  app  will  ask  participants  to  assess  how  they 
are currently feeling before and after each meditation or 
mindfulness  session.  Participants  select  one  of  the  five 
emoji  faces,  arranging  from  very  sad  (leftmost)  to  very 
happy (rightmost).

Credibility/expectancy  of  the  meditation  practices  A 
modified  version  of  the  2-item  self-report  questionnaire 
(adapted from Creswell et al. [65]) will be used to assess 
participants’  belief  about  the  relevance  and  the  efficacy 
of  the  meditation  and  mindfulness  interventions  at  T1. 
Higher scores indicate greater positive expectancies.

Other variables

Other  variables  include  spirituality  domain  related  to 
measures  of  spiritual  experiences,  closeness  to  God, 
religiosity,  demographics,  socioeconomic  status,  and 
control variables.

Spirituality domain

Spiritual  experiences  Spiritual  experiences  will  be 
measured  using  the  16-item  Daily  Spiritual  Experience 
Scale (DSES) [63]. Participants will rate the frequency of 
specific  spiritual  experiences  using  a  Likert  scale.  While 
one  item  employs  a  4-point  Likert  scale,  with  a  higher 
score  representing  greater  spiritual  experiences,  the 
remaining  15  items  are  measured  on  a  6-point  Likert 
scale  and  are  reverse-scored,  with  lower  scores  signify-
ing greater spiritual experiences. This assessment will be 
conducted across all time points (T1, T2, and T3).

Closeness  to  god/inclusion‑of‑god‑in‑the‑self  The  meas-
urement  will  employ  a  pictorial  inclusion  of  God  scale 
adapted  from  the  Inclusions  of  Others  in  the  Self  scale 
(IOS) [50], specifically tailored to assess closeness to God. 
The  scale  comprises  seven  pairs  of  circles  with  varying 
degrees  of  overlap,  describing  the  relationship  between 
oneself  and  God.  Greater  overlap  signifies  a  closer  rela-
tionship  with  God,  while  less  overlap  indicates  a  more 
distant relationship. This measure will be collected across 
all time points (T1, T2, and T3).

It will be assessed at T1 using the 5-item Duke 
Religiosity 
University  Religiosity  Index  (DUREL)  [64],  measuring 
three primary dimensions of religious involvement: organ-
izational  religious  activity  (ORA)  and  non-organizational 
religious  activity  (NORA),  and  intrinsic  religiosity  (IR). 

Potential  adverse  events  (adapted  from  Baer  et  al.  [66]): 
This  questionnaire  assesses  unpleasant  experiences 
and  potential  harm  from  the  meditation  practices  and 
includes items with Likert. It will be used at T2 and T3.

Sociodemographic variables

These  include  age,  ethnicity,  gender  identity,  sex,  employ-
ment status, education level, and annual household income.

Other variables that may affect the outcome

Closeness to the offender  The measurement will employ 
the Inclusions of Others in the Self scale (IOS) [50], com-
prising  seven  pairs  of  circles  with  varying  degrees  of 
overlap  (1,  no  overlap,  to  7,  maximal  overlap)  describ-
ing  the  relationship  between  oneself  and  the  other.  Par-
ticipants will indicate their relationship with the one who 
caused  them  harm  by  selecting  the  pair  of  circles  that 
best  reflects  their  relationship.  The  assessment  will  be 
conducted at T1 with the Love thy Enemy task.

Experiences  of  the  app‑based  exercises  Participant  will 
be asked to provide feedback on their meditation experi-
ences. This assessment will involve completing question-
naire  containing  Likert-scale  items  and  open-text  ques-
tions at T2 & T3.

Frequency  of  the  meditation  or  mindfulness  practices 
after  the  end  of  the  intervention  Participants  will  com-
plete  a  self-report  assessment  regarding  the  frequency 
of their practices following the completion of the 8-week 
intervention.

Qualitative measure

Participants  will  be  provided  with  a  notebook  and 
instructed  to  keep  a  diary  for  reflective  purposes.  The 

 Ng et al. BMC Psychology          (2024) 12:509 

Page 12 of 15

diary  will  serve  to  evaluate  any  potential  adverse  events 
associated  with  the  meditation  practices,  as  well  as  to 
explore  the  effects  of  the  practice  on  participants’  daily 
life.  Furthermore,  participants  will  be  prompted  to  pro-
vide  feedback  on  their  daily  meditative  experiences 
within the app following each session. This prompt aims 
to evaluate their experiences during meditation practices, 
focusing  primarily  on  mood,  emotions,  and  the  effec-
tiveness  of  the  session.  These  measures  will  be  assessed 
throughout the 8-week intervention.

Adverse events and safety monitor
We have established an expert panel to guide the study’s 
design  and  intervention.  Additionally,  a  dedicated  study 
coordinator  oversees  the 
logistical  and  operational 
aspects  of  our  research.  Given  that  the  potential  for 
adverse  events  linked  to  meditation  practices  [67],  we 
will assess this risk by including a self-report measure for 
adverse  events.  Participants  will  be  also  asked  to  reflect 
on  their  experiences  during  the  practices.  To  address 
concerns,  participants  can  consult  religious  experts 
from our advisory board regarding any potential adverse 
effects of the interventions. They will also be encouraged 
to promptly contact the lead researcher if adverse events 
occur, as outlined in the participant information sheet.

Participants  undergoing  the  cold  pressor  task  proce-
dures  may  experience  discomfort  or  pain,  inherent  to 
the  procedure’s  design.  They  will  be  informed  that  they 
have the option to discontinue the procedure and remove 
their hand from the cold water at any time. The cold pres-
sor task is a well-established procedure, and unexpected 
adverse  effects  related  to  the  cold  pressor  task  proce-
dure  are  unlikely  to  occur.  Therefore,  based  on  our  risk 
assessment  and  the  low  anticipated  risk,  a  formal  data 
monitoring  committee  and  modifications  of  allocated 
intervention  are  considered  unnecessary  for  this  study. 
It is also unlikely that participants will require post-trial 
care.  However,  the  lead  researcher  will  closely  monitor 
and document any potential adverse events. Participants 
will be informed of their right to withdraw from the trial 
at any time without needing to provide a reason.

Analysis plan
Quantitative data

The analyses will follow both intention-to-treat principle 
and  per-protocol  principle,  requiring  a  minimum  com-
pletion of four days of meditation sessions per week over 
the 8-week intervention period and complete all required 
assessments.  This  study  will  consider  a  result  with  a 
p-value  lower  than  0.05  as  statistically  significant.  A 
series  of  mixed-design  Repeated  Measures  Multivariate 
Analysis of Variance (RM-MANOVA) will be used to test 
the  mean  difference  in  the  outcomes  among  conditions 

(Spiritual  meditation,  mindfulness,  and  waitlist  control 
groups)  across  T1,  T2  and  T3  as  well  as  within  partici-
pants across all time points (T1, T2 and T3). The specific 
prosociality  variable,  measured  by  Charitable  Giving 
task, will be only compared between groups at T2. When 
justifiable,  missing  data  will  be  imputed  using  multiple 
imputation of chained equations [68]. 

Qualitative  data  Thematic  analysis  will  be  employed 
to  evaluate  the  data  collected  from  participants’  diaries 
regarding their reflections on daily practices and medita-
tion experiences shared in the App, following the 6-step 
analysis  process  suggested  by  Braun  and  Clare  [69].  In 
step  1,  researchers  will  thoroughly  read  the  diaries  and 
meditation experience multiple times to familiarise them-
selves with and understand the meaning of the content. In 
step 2, initial codes will be produced from the diaries and 
the meditation experience, then organised into meaning-
ful  groups.  In  step  3,  codes  will  be  organised  into  over-
arching themes. In step 4, themes will be reviewed. In step 
5, each identified theme will be defined and labelled. Step 
6 consists of the final analysis, selection of representative 
texts for the themes, and analysis write-up. Data process-
ing  and  analysis  will  be  conducted  using  the  software 
NVivo [70]. 

Interim analyses and stopping guidelines

Given that this trial does not involve harmful procedures, 
stopping  guidelines  are  not  necessary,  and  no  interim 
analyses  are  planned.  However,  participants  can  with-
draw from the study or the tasks anytime without giving 
a reason.

Data management and confidentiality
Each  participant  will  be  allocated  a  unique  participant 
number.  Raw  data  will  be  safely  and  securely  stored  on 
university servers that are only accessible to the research 
team.  All  identifiable  data,  including  name  and  contact 
details,  will  be  encrypted,  and  kept  apart  from  research 
data. Non-digital data will be securely locked in a cabinet 
with access restricted to the research team.

Dissemination plan
Anonymised  data,  analysis  scripts  and  results  will  be 
shared  and  archived  through  the  Donders  Repository 
(https:// data. donde rs. ru. nl) in accordance with open sci-
ence  principles  after  the  main  results  of  the  study  have 
been published.

Patient and public involvement

This  study  aims  to  address  a  gap  in  contemplative  sci-
ences, where most studies narrowly focus on secularised 
adaptations  of  Buddhist  and  Hindu  exercises.  Patients 

Ng et al. BMC Psychology          (2024) 12:509 

Page 13 of 15

will  not  be  involved  in  any  part  of  the  study,  including 
study design, recruitment, participation, or assessment.

Discussion
Contemplative  practices  have  drawn  substantial  inter-
est  over  the  recent  decades.  Among  them,  secular 
mindfulness meditation has become widely recognised 
and  particularly  popular,  especially  in  therapeutic  set-
tings  where  it  is  frequently  used  to  promote  wellness. 
However,  this  excessive  focus  on  a  single  Buddhist-
based  technique  has  led  to  a  neglect  in  exploring  the 
plethora  of  meditation  techniques  from  other  spiritual 
traditions, and their potential benefits.

To  advance  the  field  of  contemplative  studies  and 
provide additional opportunities to enhance well-being, 
this study has developed a stratified 3-arm randomised 
controlled  to  examine  the  effects  of  Christian  and 
Islamic spiritual meditation through a mobile app. This 
study will compare the effects of Christian and Islamic 
spiritual  meditation,  against  mindfulness  meditation 
and  a  waitlist.  If  the  study  demonstrates  positive  out-
comes,  it  could  enable  practitioner  to  improve  their 
well-being within their own religious framework.

As  the  interventions  will  be  delivered  online  instead 
of in person, limitations arise in assessing whether par-
ticipants  fully  adhere  to  the  practice  while  listening  to 
the audio instructions. For instances, they may focus on 
other  activities,  rather  than  on  the  practice.  Addition-
ally,  the  environment  in  which  a  participant  practices 
may play a role in the research outcomes.
