Abstract

Context—Eating disorders are severe conditions, but little is known about the prevalence or 
correlates of these disorders from population-based surveys of adolescents.

Objectives—To examine the prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in a large, 
reprefentative sample of US adolescents.

Design—Cross-sectional survey of adolescents with face-to-face interviews using a modified 
version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.

Setting—Combined household and school adolescent samples.

Participants—Nationally representative sample of 10 123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.

Main Outcome Measures—Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders and subthreshold 
conditions.

Results—Lifetime prevalence estimates of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating 
disorder were 0.3%, 0.9%, and 1.6%, respectively. Important differences were observed between 
eating disorder subtypes concerning sociodemographic correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, role 
impairment, and suicidality. Although the majority of adolescents with an eating disorder sought

some form of treatment, only a minority received treatment specifically for their eating or weight 
problems. Analyses of 2 related subthreshold conditions suggest that these conditions are often 
clinically significant.

Conclusions—Eating disorders and subthreshold eating conditions are prevalent in the general 
adolescent population. Their impact is demonstrated by generally strong associations with other 
psychiatric disorders, role impairment, and suicidality. The unmet treatment needs in the 
adolescent population place these disorders as important public health concerns.

ALTHOUGH THE LIFETIME prevalence estimates of eating disorders from population-
based studies of adults are relatively low (0.5%–1.0% for anorexia nervosa [AN] and 0.5%–
3.0% for bulimia nervosa [BN]),1–8 their severity and dramatic impact have been repeatedly 
demonstrated through elevated rates of role impairment,1,2,9 medical complications,10 
comorbidity,1,2,11 mortality,12–14 and suicide.12,13,15,16 Regarding children and adolescents, 
previous population-based studies of eating disorders have focused on youths who meet full 
DSM-IV criteria without presenting information on youths with eating problems that fall 
below current diagnostic thresholds. Eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), a 
broad category that covers clinically significant eating disorders that do not meet criteria for 
AN or BN, tends to be more frequently diagnosed in clinical settings than either of the 
DSM-IV eating disorder subtypes.17–19 In fact, adult population-based studies that have 
expanded measures to include EDNOS subtypes have found a greater prevalence of binge-
eating disorder (BED) and related symptoms than that of AN and BN combined.1,2

Community studies that used dimensional measures in youths have also yielded far greater 
prevalences of disordered eating behaviors (ie, 14%–22%)20,21 than those found in studies 
that applied strict DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.22,23 Taken together, these findings indicate 
that the full spectrum of disordered eating is likely to be considerably higher than previously 
estimated, a possibility that may have major public health implications depending on their 
physical, mental, and social consequences. investigations of eating disorders in community 
samples of youths are relatively rare,22,23 and comprehensive descriptions of unspecified or 
subthreshold eating conditions have not been addressed in any prior representative 
adolescent samples to our knowledge.

This study examines eating disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 
Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a nationally representative sample of US adolescents aged 
13 to 18 years. The objectives of this investigation are the following: (1) to present the 
lifetime and 12-month prevalences of AN, BN, BED, and subthreshold eating disorders; (2) 
to examine their sociodemographic and clinical correlates and patterns of comorbidity with 
other mental disorders; and (3) to describe the magnitude of role impairment, suicidal 
behavior, and service use associated with these disorders.

METHODS

SAMPLE

The NCS-A is a nationally representative face-to-face interview survey of 10 123 
adolescents in the continental United States. The background, measures, design, and clinical 
validity of the NCS-A have been described in detail elsewhere.24–26 Briefly, the NCS-A

sample was based on a nationally representative household sample (n = 879 adolescents) and 
a school sample (n=9244 adolescents), with a combined response rate of 82.9%. One parent 
or parental surrogate of each participating adolescent was asked to complete a self-
administered questionnaire that contained questions about the adolescent’s mental health 
and service use; the self-administered questionnaire had a conditional response rate of 
83.3%.

Sociodemographic variables assessed in the NCS-A include age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental 
education, parental or parental surrogate-reported marital status, household income, and 
urbanicity. Parental/surrogate marital status was grouped into married or cohabiting, 
previously married (including divorced, widowed, or separated), never married, and 
unknown. Household income was used to calculate the poverty income ratio, defined as the 
ratio of the income to the poverty line. The 2000 census definitions were used to code 
urbanicity by distinguishing large metropolitan areas from smaller metropolitan areas and 
rural areas.

ASSESSMENT OF DSM-IV DISORDERS

The DSM-IV disorders were assessed using a modification of the fully structured World 
Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) administered to 
the adolescents by lay interviewers. In addition to the adolescent interviews, parent report 
from the self-administered questionnaire was incorporated to assess a selection of behavioral 
disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and 
oppositional defiant disorder; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was defined by parent 
report, while the other behavioral disorders were defined by endorsement of either the parent 
or adolescent. Definitions of all psychiatric disorders adhered to DSM-IV criteria except the 
definition of oppositional defiant disorder, which was modified to enhance clinical validity 
based on a clinical reappraisal subsample.27 Although service use has been included as an 
index of impairment in deriving DSM-IV diagnoses in other articles,28 this criterion was 
removed from the diagnostic algorithms for the purposes of these and other related 
analyses.29 Additionally, indices of disability assessed solely for 12-month disorders were 
not considered in defining lifetime disorder severity. Both lifetime and 12-month disorders 
were examined, as was the age at their onset. A more complete description of the diagnostic 
measures has been presented by Merikangas et al.24

The CIDI was designed to assess diagnostic criteria based on the DSM-IV criteria for AN, 
BN, and BED. In accordance with the diagnostic algorithms developed for the parallel adult 
US survey,2 both AN and BN followed the DSM-IV criteria and BED followed the proposed 
DSM-5 criteria.30 Because the CIDI did not directly assess loss of control associated with 
binge eating, items that tapped the cognition of loss of control were used to approximate this 
DSM-IV criterion. Diagnostic hierarchies were applied with AN taking precedence over BN, 
and BN superseding BED. More than 1 eating disorder subtype could be assigned only if 
there was clear evidence for a temporal distinction between the manifestations of the 2 
subtypes.

Sufficient information was also available to define subthreshold AN (SAN) and subthreshold 
BED (SBED) among those youths who did not meet criteria for AN, BN, or BED. The

definition of SAN included the following: (1) lowest body weight less than 90% of the 
adolescent’s ideal body weight; (2) intense fear of weight gain at the time of the lowest 
weight; and (3) no history of another threshold-level eating disorder. The definition of SBED 
included the following: (1) binge eating at least twice a week for several months; (2) 
perceived loss of control; and (3) no history of another threshold-level eating disorder or 
SAN. Combined, BED, SAN, and SBED capture a potentially large subset of the EDNOS 
category, but other symptom patterns of EDNOS could not be ascertained (eg, purging 
disorder, subthreshold BN).

IMPAIRMENT

Among subjects who met criteria for an eating disorder within the past 12 months, 
impairment was assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale.31 The Sheehan Disability 
Scale captures the severity of role impairment in 4 domains: home, school or work, family, 
and social life. In each of these domains, the Sheehan Disability Scale measures impairment 
on a scale from 0 to 10 with anchors provided to the adolescent; non-0 scores indicate any 
impairment due to the disorder, while scores at or above 7 indicate severe or very severe 
impairment. In addition to this scale, these respondents were also asked to report the number 
of days on which they were “totally unable to go to school or work or carry out [their] 
normal activities because of problems with [their] eating or weight.”

SUICIDALITY

Adolescents were asked about lifetime suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. Because of the 
sensitivity of these questions, literate adolescents were not asked these questions directly in 
the face-to-face interview but rather read the questions and responded to them separately. 
Adolescents who could not read were instead asked these questions orally (n = 232). 
Adolescents were asked about suicide plans and attempts only if they endorsed suicide 
ideation.

SERVICE USE

Both the parent (or parental surrogate) and adolescent were asked whether the adolescent 
had ever been treated for emotional or behavioral problems. Reports of service use were 
classified into the following categories: (1) mental health specialty care: services provided 
by a psychiatrist in settings such as a mental health clinic, drug or alcohol clinic, emergency 
department, and admissions to hospitals and other facilities; (2) general medical care: 
services provided by a general health care practitioner, family physician, pediatrician, or any 
other physician; (3) human services: services involving a social worker, a counselor, a 
religious or spiritual advisor, or mental health crisis hotlines; (4) complementary and 
alternative medicine: participation in support groups, in self-help groups, or with any other 
healer; (5) juvenile justice: services provided by a probation or juvenile correction officer; 
and (6) school services: services rendered in the school environment, including attendance at 
a special school or special class for children with emotional and behavioral problems, 
treatment from a mental health nurse, school counseling, and school-administered 
medication. Adolescents who met criteria for AN, BN, or BED were also asked whether 
they had ever talked with a medical doctor or professional specifically about their eating or 
weight problems. With the exception of the eating disorder-specific question, the analysis of

service use in this study is based on endorsement by either the parent or child; levels of 
agreement between the parent and adolescent reports on service use across the entire sample 
were acceptable (κ = 0.54). Further information on lifetime service use in the NCS-A has 
been reported elsewhere.29

STATISTICAL ANALYSES

All analyses were completed using the SUDAAN software system version 10 (RTI 
International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). The data were weighted to adjust for 
differential probabilities of selection of respondents within school and household samples, 
differential nonresponse, and residual differences between the sample and the US population 
on the cross-classification of sociodemographic variables.26 The Taylor series linearization 
method was implemented to adjust for the effects of weighting and clustering on all 
presented estimates and standard errors. Logistic regression models were used to obtain 
estimates of odds ratios, adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Statistical significance 
was consistently evaluated using .05-level, 2-sided tests.

RESULTS

PREVALENCE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES

Lifetime prevalence rates of AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED were 0.3%, 0.9%, 1.6%, 0.8%, 
and 2.5%, respectively (Table 1). The 12-month prevalence rates of AN, BN, BED, and 
SBED were 0.2%, 0.6%, 0.9%, and 1.1%, respectively, with 12-month to lifetime prevalence 
ratios of 57.9%, 72.0%, 56.0%, and 44.5%, respectively. Among adolescents with BN, 
41.3% reported purging in their lifetime while the rest met criteria through nonpurging 
compensatory behaviors.

Regarding lifetime prevalence estimates, there were no sex differences in the prevalence of 
AN or SBED, while BN, BED, and SAN were more prevalent in girls (Table 2). Significant 
ethnic differences emerged for BN, with Hispanic adolescents reporting the highest 
prevalence; there was a trend toward ethnic minorities reporting more BED, while non-
Hispanic white adolescents tended to report more AN. Measures of socioeconomic status, 
including parental education, household income, and parental/surrogate marital status, were 
not significantly associated with any eating disorder presentation.

AGE AT ONSET

Age-at-onset curves for AN, BN, BED, and SBED are shown in the Figure. The median 
ages at onset of AN, BN, BED, and SBED were 12.3, 12.4, 12.6, and 12.6 years, 
respectively. Interquartile ranges for AN, BN, BED, and SBED were 11.2 to 13.0, 11.1 to 
13.5, 11.2 to 13.5, and 10.0 to 14.3 years, respectively.

COMORBIDITY WITH OTHER MENTAL DISORDERS

The majority of respondents with an eating disorder met criteria for at least 1 other lifetime 
DSM-IV disorder assessed in this study across the lifetime, with 55.2%, 88.0%, 83.5%, 
79.8%, and 70.1% of adolescents with AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED, respectively, 
endorsing 1 or more comorbid psychiatric disorders (Table 3). The adjusted odds ratios

(95% confidence intervals) for comorbid disorders by eating disorder subtype were 1.5 
(0.54.4) for AN, 8.6 (2.7–27.3) for BN, 5.9 (2.5–13.8) for BED, 4.3 (2.0–8.8) for SAN, and 
2.7 (1.8–4.1) for SBED. Anorexia nervosa was not associated with any other mental disorder 
except oppositional defiant disorder. In contrast, BN and BED were significantly associated 
with nearly every disorder assessed. Both subthreshold presentations showed modest 
amounts of comorbidity across classes of DSM-IV disorders. In particular, BN and BED 
were strongly associated with mood and anxiety disorders and with multiple disorders, with 
27.0% of adolescents with BN and 37.0% of adolescents with BED endorsing 3 or more 
classes of comorbid disorders.

IMPAIRMENT

Among adolescents with 12-month AN, BN, BED, and SBED, 97.1%, 78.0%, 62.6%, and 
34.6%, respectively, reported impairment in the past 12 months; 24.2%, 10.7%, 8.7%, and 
2.8%, respectively, reported severe impairment (Table 4). Eating disorders were most 
strongly associated with social impairment. Nearly all of those with AN (88.9%) reported 
social impairment, and 19.6% reported severe social impairment associated with their eating 
disorder. Adolescents with BN and BED also reported that their eating problems most 
impaired their social and family relationships. Although impairment in these domains was 
relatively high, youths with eating disorders rarely reported that their eating problems led to 
complete loss of role functioning for an entire day. Among adolescents with 12-month AN, 
BN, BED, and SBED, 11.6%, 14.4%, 9.8%, and 11.9%, respectively, reported at least 1 day 
in the past year when they were completely unable to carry out normal activities. The 
reported number of days out of role ranged from 0 to 90 days for AN, 0 to 10 days for BN, 0 
to 30 days for BED, and 0 to 41 days for SBED.

SUICIDALITY

Lifetime suicidality was associated with all subtypes of eating disorders (Table 5). Each 
eating disorder subtype was associated with significantly elevated levels of suicide ideation, 
while BN and SAN were further associated with suicide plans and BN and BED were 
associated with suicide attempts. Of note, adolescents with SAN reported levels of suicide 
ideation comparable to those of adolescents with AN and considerably more suicide plans 
and attempts. Suicidality was particularly associated with BN, as more than half of 
adolescents with BN reported suicide ideation and more than a third reported attempts.

SERVICE USE

The majority of adolescents with an eating disorder received some sort of treatment for an 
emotional or behavioral problem. Among subjects with AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED, 
77.6%, 88.2%, 72.6%, 70.5%, and 64.2%, respectively, received some form of treatment in 
their lifetime (Table 6). However, much smaller proportions had sought treatment 
specifically for their eating or weight problems (27.5%, 21.5%, 11.4%, and 3.4% for AN, 
BN, BED, and SBED, respectively). The majority of youths who had received services had 
sought treatment from a mental health specialty (68.8%, 60.9%, 60.4%, 54.3%, and 48.8% 
for AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED, respectively). A sizable minority of youths with AN 
had sought treatment from human services (40.0%) and school services (40.4%), while 
many of those with BN also sought treatment from the general medical sector (49.2%) and

school services (45.4%). Adolescents with each of the eating dis-order subtypes were 
significantly more likely to seek any treatment and mental health specialty treatment than 
adolescents without these disorders.

COMMENT

To our knowledge, this investigation provides the first report on the prevalence, correlates, 
impact, and service use patterns of both threshold and subthreshold eating disorders in a 
nationally representative sample of US adolescents. The observed prevalence estimates were 
generally similar to those of previous studies,1–8,22,23 and salient differences in 
sociodemographic and clinical correlates were observed between eating disorder subtypes. 
Subthreshold eating conditions that were frequent in this population were characterized by 
many of the same severity markers as cases meeting diagnostic criteria. While most 
adolescents with eating disorders received some form of treatment, only a minority of 
affected individuals received services specifically for eating or weight problems. These 
findings underscore the important public health implications for a wide spectrum of 
disordered eating among US youths as well as the necessity to improve treatment access for 
these conditions.

Prevalence estimates for eating disorders have been difficult to compare across studies 
owing to differences in research methods as well as cultural and societal differences that 
affect base prevalence. The observed lifetime prevalence estimates of 0.3% for AN, 0.9% for 
BN, and 1.6% for BED were only slightly lower than those reported for US adults using 
parallel methods.2 However, the ages at onset of each of these disorders were markedly 
younger in the present sample, thereby underscoring the likelihood that retrospective 
assessments of adults may overestimate the age at onset of these conditions for a variety of 
possible reasons.32

The sex ratio for most eating spectrum disorders in this study was generally smaller than that 
in prior treatment-seeking samples and considerably smaller than the 9:1 ratio stated in the 
DSM-IV. The lack of a female preponderance of eating disorders could be attributable to 
either the methods of the present study or a true lack of a sex difference in eating disorders 
in adolescence. One indication that the difference may be genuine is provided by the large 
female to male ratio for SAN. Future analyses will explore possible explanations for sex 
differences in eating symptoms and disorders.

Prevalence estimates of eating spectrum disorders also varied by race, with Hispanic 
adolescents having the highest rates of BN. The greater prevalence of BN in Hispanic 
adolescents should be interpreted with caution as immigration status, country of birth, and 
length of residence in the United States may all have an effect on the risk of BN.33–35 
Nonetheless, this larger prevalence highlights an important discrepancy between treatment-
seeking samples and the full US adolescent population.36

Although the frequent crossover of eating disorder subtypes in longitudinal studies of 
adults37–39 suggests a lack of diagnostic specificity of eating disorder subtypes,40–42 
differences in the correlates and clinical profiles between discrete subtypes in our study

provide evidence for the validity of these distinctions. There was pervasive lifetime 
comorbidity among youths with BN, whereas AN was associated with only 1 other disorder 
(ie, oppositional defiant disorder). Likewise, suicidality was more common among 
adolescents with BN compared with those with AN, corroborating findings from previous 
community surveys43 and some clinical studies.12–14 By contrast, severe role impairment 
was more common among adolescents with AN relative to those with BN. The reasons for 
variation in clinical correlates remain to be explored but may include underlying differences 
in temperament and personality characteristics,44,45 genetic, physiological, and personal 
history variables,46,47 or other mechanisms that may differentiate AN, BN, and BED in 
general population samples.

The discrepancy between the lack of substantial comorbidity among adolescents in the 
current study48 and the high rates of comorbidity associated with AN among adults1,2 
suggests that comorbid disorders may be a consequence of AN in youths. In fact, some 
prospective studies49,50 provide support for comorbid disorders emerging among youths 
with primary eating disorders in adolescence. Future analyses will compare the temporal 
order and progression of comorbid disorders in adults and youths in these parallel studies.

The high prevalence estimates of SAN (0.8%) and SBED (2.5%) provide evidence for a 
spectrum of eating disorders among youths in the general population.17–19 Subthreshold 
eating conditions were often characterized by many of the same severity markers as 
threshold cases. Most striking was the high endorsement of mental health service use for 
subthreshold conditions, with more than half of these adolescents having sought mental 
health specialty treatment. Patterns of comorbidity are also suggestive of the clinical 
significance of these subthreshold conditions in the population.20,21 Likewise, the significant 
association between suicide ideation and behavior with subthreshold conditions supports the 
importance of the spectrum concept of eating disorders.

The majority (72.6%–88.2%) of adolescents with eating disorders reported some contact 
with the service sector for emotional or behavioral problems, with the most frequently used 
sectors being mental health specialty care, school services, general medical services, and 
human services. However, only a minority (3.4%–27.5%) of individuals with eating 
disorders had actually talked to a professional specifically about their eating or weight 
problems. This could be attributable to denial of eating problems by adolescents, shame 
and/or stigma, or a lack of recognition of eating symptoms by professionals treating other 
targeted problems among these youths. The evidence that adolescents do indeed use services 
across sectors suggests possible avenues for prevention and early intervention strategies if 
recognition could be improved (eg, education of parents and youths to minimize stigma and 
of non-mental health care professionals to recognize signs of eating disorders). Moreover, 
the increased risk for certain forms of eating disorders among Hispanic and other minority 
adolescents warrants particular attention in education of youths, their families, and mental 
health care professionals.33,36

To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study in the United States to present the 
prevalence of eating disorders across the full adolescent age range. The large sample size is 
unparalleled, and the sampling design and weighting allow for generalizations to the general

US adolescent population. Inclusion of subthreshold manifestations of eating disorders 
permitted assessment of a broader range of eating behaviors and their clinical significance. 
Further strengths are the use of face-to-face structured interviews of the adolescents as well 
as inclusion of reports from both the parent and adolescent in the assessment of service use 
and behavioral disorders.

However, the cross-sectional design of this study limits conclusions concerning temporal 
relationships among comorbid conditions and prevents confirmation of findings from adult 
samples concerning eating disorder crossovers or transitions from subthreshold to full-
threshold conditions.37–39 In addition, the small number of adolescents with combinations of 
eating disorders (eg, only 6 adolescents met criteria for both AN and BN, and only 2 
adolescents met criteria for both BN and BED) precluded our ability to investigate the 
correlates of combinations of threshold-level eating disorders.

Although 12-month prevalence is also reported, this article primarily focuses on lifetime 
prevalence and correlates of eating disorders. Such estimates are critical for a comprehensive 
life-course understanding of these disorders but may also be subject to unreliability of recall 
of past symptoms or disorders due to memory, bias, desirability of response, and other 
factors. Attempts to minimize such biases were built into the methods of the CIDI.28,51 In 
fact, growing evidence from prospective cohort studies suggests that retrospective recall 
yields underestimates as opposed to overestimates of the true prevalence of psychiatric 
disorders.52,53 Therefore, the estimates in this article may be a lower bound of the true 
prevalence of eating disorders.

Concerning other limitations, our diagnostic instrument had not been previously validated in 
adolescents, and studies using earlier versions of the CIDI found that the instrument tended 
to underdiagnose eating disorders in adults.54 However, the use of this same instrument in 2 
large adult population-based investigations permitted direct comparisons across studies.1,2 
An additional concern is that the structure of the survey may not capture all clinically 
significant cases that fall under a not-otherwise-specified (EDNOS) diagnosis, which 
corresponds to a majority of the identified cases of eating disorders. For example, the 
interview did not cover manifestations such as purging without binging, BN or BED with 
weekly binge eating (a criterion currently proposed for the DSM-5 for both BN and 
BED),30,55 or the age at onset and impairment of SAN.

Furthermore, analyses of associations may have been underpowered owing to the relatively 
small numbers of adolescents with eating disorders. In particular, as the unweighted number 
of adolescents with AN in this sample is only 34, the lack of findings for sociodemographic 
measures and comorbidity may be due to this methodologic issue rather than representing 
true null findings. Further, while the prevalence of subthreshold presentations was assessed, 
the CIDI was originally designed to assess only DSM-IV presentations; therefore, vital 
questions regarding the age at onset and impairment of SAN in particular were not asked. 
This is unfortunate in light of the research questions faced in the revision of the DSM, and 
the designers of future epidemiologic studies should consider the qualitative costs to 
research of enforcing skip logic along with the monetary costs.

Despite these limitations, this study provides key information concerning the epidemiology 
of eating disorders in the US adolescent population. The prevalence of these disorders is 
higher than previously expected in this age range, and the patterns of comorbidity, role 
impairment, and suicidality indicate that eating disorders represent a major public health 
concern. Finally, these findings support the nosological distinction between the major 
subtypes of eating disorders as well as the importance of inclusion of the full spectrum of 
eating behaviors in estimating the magnitude and correlates of eating disorders in the US 
population.
