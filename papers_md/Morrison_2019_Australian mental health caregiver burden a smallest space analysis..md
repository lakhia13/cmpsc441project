Objectives  To explore Australian mental health carers’ 
prioritisation of key elements of caregiving and establish 
the extent to which particular issues contribute to carer 
burden.
Design  Cross-sectional survey.
setting  All Australian States and Territories.
Participants  Responses were received from 231 
Australian mental health caregivers.
Main outcome measures  The Involvement Evaluation 
Questionnaire was used to assess caregiver burden.
results  Smallest space analysis identified three distinct 
regions, which we conceptualise as: 1) promoting the 
safety and health of mental health consumers; 2) impact of 
caring on caregivers’ personal lives and 3) enabling daily 
living functional recovery of mental health consumers. The 
analysis demonstrates that carers are most concerned 
with enabling daily living functional recovery, for which 
the mean value was considerably higher than the personal 
impact and promoting safety and health regions. In 
terms of the individual questionnaire items, the issues of 
most importance are assisting with self-care, worrying 
about consumers’ future, finances and general health, 
encouraging consumer involvement in activities and 
concerns over the treatment consumers are receiving.
Conclusion  Caregiving often came at significant personal 
cost. The burden that results from caring for mental 
health consumers could perhaps be alleviated through 
the expansion of psychiatric disability services, increasing 
government financial support and providing tailored 
psychosocial interventions that meet the needs of families.

The  deinstitutionalisation  of  services  has 
seen  informal  carers  becoming  increasingly 
involved  in  the  mental  health  system.1  2 
Carers  in  adopting  these  roles  face  ongoing 
challenges,  which  may  include  advocating 
on behalf of mental health consumers, crisis 
management, helping with daily activities and 
providing financial assistance.3–5 The burden 
associated  with  assuming  these  responsibil-
ities,  coupled  with  the  impact  of  witnessing 
illness, 
their  relative  experience  mental 
means  that  carers  often  report  significant 
levels of distress.4–7 

About  one-third  of  mental  health 
consumers’ 
family  members  experience 
emotional  distress.7  8  Such  distress  may 

strengths and limitations of this study

 ► To our knowledge, this is the first Australian study 
to examine mental health carers prioritisation of key 
elements  of  caregiving  and  establish  the  extent  to 
which particular issues contribute to carer burden.
 ► Qualitative data are used to provide further insight 

into the quantitative findings.

 ► Respondent bias may influence our results.

encompass  feelings  of  loss,  anxiety  and 
distress.9–11  In  addition,  caregiving  may  lead 
to  social  isolation,  reduced  work  produc-
tivity,  financial  loss  and  disruption  in  family 
routines,  which  may  substantially  impair 
carers’ quality of life.9 11–14

Several  factors  have  been  identified  that 
influence  mental  health  caregiver  burden. 
Studies  have  shown  that  caring  for  a  male 
mental  health  consumer  leads  to  signifi-
cantly  higher  levels  of  stress.15  Other  demo-
graphic  characteristics  that  effect  burden 
include  lower  levels  of  caregiver  education 
and  younger  carer  age,  both  of  which  have 
been associated with higher levels of depres-
sion.16–19  Also,  supporting  consumers  who 
display heightened positive or negative symp-
toms exacerbates the detrimental impact on 
carers’ quality of life, work efficiency and lost 
days of work.20

Although  much  of  the  available  literature 
focuses on adverse consequences, caregiving 
for  mental  health  consumers  also  results  in 
beneficial outcomes for carers. Some mental 
health carers note that supporting consumers 
has  sensitised  them  to  the  needs  of  people 
with disabilities, enabled them to clarify their 
priorities in life and has enhanced their resil-
ience.21 The sense of satisfaction and meaning 
that  carers  find  in  helping  consumers  has 
been  associated  with  higher  levels  of  quality 
of life.22–24

Research  has  demonstrated  that  carers 
contribute  importantly  to  the  recovery  of 
mental  health  consumers.  In  particular,  the 
involvement of family members in the provi-
sion of mental health services has been found

to decrease consumer relapse and rehospitalisation rates 
by  20%–50%.4  Other  mental  health  consumer  benefits 
that may be attributed to supportive family relationships 
include  improved  participation  in  vocational  rehabili-
tation,  higher  employment  rates,  enhanced  social  func-
tioning and reductions in psychiatric symptoms.4

To  our  knowledge,  no  prior  qualitative  studies  have 
explored  Australian  mental  health  caregiver  burden. 
However,  few quantitative studies have examined issues 
involved with caring for mental health consumers in an 
Australian  context.13  25  26  The  Australian  quantitative 
studies13  25  26  on  mental  health  caregiver  burden  have 
reflected  the  results  of  research  conducted  in  other 
countries,7 15 27 in that they have shown that carers expe-
rience social isolation and impaired physical and mental 
health. To our knowledge, no prior studies in an Austra-
lian setting have quantified aspects of mental health care-
giving. This information is important since it provides an 
understanding  of  the  extent  to  which  individual  factors 
influence  mental  health  caregiver  burden,  and  may 
enable health services to develop interventions that target 
the  factors  that  contribute  most  substantially  to  such 
burden.  Hence,  the  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  explore 
Australian  mental  health  carers’  experiences  through 
rating the importance of key elements of caregiving and 
establish the extent to which particular issues contribute 
to carer burden.

MethODs
study design
This study involves a cross-sectional survey of Australian 
mental health caregivers.

survey instrument
The  Involvement  Evaluation  Questionnaire  (IEQ)  was 
used to measure mental health carer burden.27 The deci-
sion to use the IEQ in this study was based on the findings 
of  a  systematic  review,  which  recommended  the  IEQ  as 
one of the two most superior instruments to assess mental 
health caregiver burden.28 The questionnaire comprises 
four scales: 1) tension (nine items), which assesses inter-
personal  difficulties  between  consumers  and  carers;  2) 
supervision (six items), which enquires about carers’ moni-
toring  consumer  sleep,  medicine  intake  and  dangerous 
behaviour; 3) worrying (six items), which captures details 
regarding troubling interpersonal like concern about the 
consumer’s  future  and  safety,  overall  health  and  quality 
of healthcare and 4) urging (eight items), which assesses 
the  extent  to  which  carers  encourage  consumers  to 
undertake general activities and self-care.27 Each item is 
scored on a 5-point Likert scale (never=0, sometimes=1, 
regularly=2,  often=3,  always=4).27  Finally,  a  single  open-
ended  question  allows  carers  to  make  comments  about 
their experiences. This question was phrased as follows: 
'Multiple choice questions cannot possibly cover all that 
you have experienced with the person you care for. Please 

2

feel free to add any comments you may wish to make in 
the space below'.

The  structure  of  the  IEQ  was  originally  established 
through  subjecting  data  from  a  Dutch  mental  health 
caregiver  population  to  principal  components  analysis, 
which yielded the aforementioned four scales.27 The IEQ 
has subsequently been translated into English and other 
languages  and  undergone  psychometric  testing,  across 
five international sites, comprising an examination of its 
internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The results 
demonstrated  that  the  IEQ  scales  exhibited  adequate 
levels of test–retest reliability, which was evidenced by the 
intraclass correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.83 
to  0.90.27  But  some  of  the  Cronbach's  α  values  fell  out 
of  the  ideal  range  of  0.70–0.80  proposed  by  Bland  and 
Altman.29 The Cronbach's α values for IEQ scales ranged 
from  0.75  to  0.84  for  the  tension  scale;  0.68  to  0.82  for 
the  supervision  scale;  0.77  to  0.86  for  the  worries  scale 
and 0.77 to 0.86 for the urging scale.28 The range of these 
Cronbach's  α  values  suggested  that  it  would  be  worth-
while to re-evaluate the structure of IEQ, using an explor-
atory  method  such  as  smallest  space  analysis  (SSA).30 
In  addition,  guidelines  for  the  international  translation 
of  health-related  outcome  measures  recommend  that 
exploratory  techniques  should  be  used  to  establish  the 
structure  of  translated  questionnaires.31  This  guidance 
further supported the use of SSA to reassess the structure 
of IEQ.

recruitment
All  Australian  caregivers  for  mental  health  consumers 
were eligible to participate in this study. Twenty-two carer, 
mental health carer and mental health consumer organi-
sations disseminated study invitation notices on our behalf 
through Twitter, Facebook, e-newsletters and online sites. 
We also personally distributed invitation notices through 
Facebook  pages  of  mental  health  carer  and  consumer 
groups.  The  invitation  notices  outlined  the  purpose  of 
the study and provided the link for the online survey ques-
tionnaire. A comprehensive information letter was placed 
at  the  beginning  of  the  survey,  which  the  prospective 
participants were asked to read before starting to answer 
the survey questions. All responses were anonymous and 
return of the questionnaire was used to indicate consent. 
Data were collected from March 2017 to July 2017.

Participant involvement
Mental health caregivers were not actively involved in the 
design of this study, but did contribute extensively to the 
development of the instrument used in this study.

sample size
Cochran’s  formula  for  continuous  variables  was  used  to 
establish the number of returned questionnaires required 
to generalise the study findings.32 Given that there were 
approximately 15 666 Australian mental health carers,33 
and incorporating a 5% level of acceptable risk and 3% 
margin  of  error,  it  was  established  that  133  completed 

Morrison P, Stomski NJ. BMJ Open 2019;9:e022419. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022419questionnaires  were  needed  to  generalise  the  study 
findings.

Data analysis
The  analysis  combined  quantitative  and  qualitative 
approaches.  For  the  quantitative  component,  data  were 
entered and analysed in the Hebrew University Data Anal-
ysis Package V.8. All demographic variables are reported 
descriptively.  Given  the  lack  of  robust  evidence  for  the 
dimensionality of IEQ, smallest space analysis was used to 
examine the structure of the dataset. SSA was used as it 
offers numerous advantages over statistical methods such 
as  factor  analysis.34  35  Such  advantages  include:  provi-
sion of geometric output that is readily comprehensible; 
derivation  of  the  fewest  number  of  dimensions;  results 
remain invariant under rotation and lack of need to select 
orthogonal  or  oblique  rotations.34  35  It  is  an  especially 
robust method that can be used to analyse many different 
types of data.30 36 SSA is one of a host of non-metric multi-
dimensional  scaling  (MDS)  methods  used  to  represent 
relationship measures between variables or items in a low 
dimensional space.30 The SSA programme calculates asso-
ciations between variables, where the association between 
any two variables is expressed as the distance between them 
on a graph such that the smaller the distance between two 
plotted variables, the stronger the association.

In this instance, SSA was used in an exploratory manner 
to uncover any hidden structures in the dataset that could 
be  easily  identified  and  displayed  visually.36  It  provides 
a  means  for  reducing  data  and  in  so  doing  produces  a 
summary  of  complex  data  that  can  be  examined  and 
interpreted. Themes or patterns may arise from the visual 
depiction. A particular cluster of variables, each of which 
represents a construct or theme that captures something 
of the carers’ experience, are derived from a partitioning 
of the graph into regions or neighbourhoods.

SSA also produces a measure, the co-efficient of alien-
ation, that demonstrates how well the distances between 
the  points  on  the  two-  dimensional  SSA  plot  reflect  the 
correlations between the questionnaire items.37 The coef-
ficient of alienation can range from 0 (best fit) to 1 (worst 
fit),  and  should  be  ≤0.2 to  be  considered  satisfactory.37 
To  facilitate  comparison  between  the  SSA  scales,  which 
contained differing numbers of items, a total scale score 
was  produced  by  summing  the  items,  which  was  then 
divided  by  the  number  of  items  within  the  scale,  after 
which a mean scale score was derived.

The  qualitative  aspect  of  the  analysis  was  based  on 
the thematic analysis methods by Braun and Clarke.38 In 
this study, a theoretical, deductive approach to coding was 
used as the main purpose of the analysis was to confirm 
and further illuminate the structures identified in the SSA 
analysis  of  the  IEQ  items.  As  such,  a  coding  framework 
was developed wherein the SSA regions served as themes, 
and the items within each region acted as subthemes. All 
of  the  open-ended  responses  were  then  systematically 
analysed line by line and constant comparison was used 
to  map  extracts  from  these  responses  into  the  coding

framework. Both authors initially reviewed the full set of 
open-ended responses. One of the authors then mapped 
the  responses  into  an  excel  spreadsheet  that  contained 
the  coding  framework.  The  other  author  reviewed  the 
conceptual fit of the mapped responses. The authors then 
met in-person to clarify and further elaborate the themes 
and subthemes through a consensus-driven discussion.

results
The total number of returned questionnaires was 231, of 
which 122 contained responses to the open-ended ques-
tion.  The  respondents’  demographic  characteristics  are 
displayed in tables 1 and 2. The average age of the respon-
dents  was  51.7  (SD=12.3)  years.  Almost  all  respondents 
were  female  (91.0%).  Respondents  tended  to  be  in  a 
long-term relationship or married (59.2%), and generally 
lived  with  their  spouse,  partner  or  children  (72.6%)  in 
metropolitan locations (55.8%). During the past 4 weeks, 
most  respondents  experienced  a  physical  or  mental 
health problem (75.0%), for which they most commonly 
consulted  a  general  practitioner  (68.0%).  In  terms  of 
the psychiatric diagnoses for the consumers of whom the 
respondents supported, the most common were bipolar 
(19.9%)  and  schizophrenia/schizoaffective  disorder 
(19.4%),  followed  by  depression  (10.4%),  personality 
disorder  (10.0%)  and  anxiety  disorder  (7.0%).  In  addi-
tion,  about  one-third  (32.8%)  of  the  respondents  indi-
cated  ‘other’  for  the  psychiatric  diagnosis,  of  which 
two-thirds (66.6%) related to the co-occurrence of two or 
more psychiatric disorders.

smallest space analysis
The coefficient of alienation for the SSA was 0.21. Figure 1 
displays the two-dimensional plot that resulted from the 
SSA. An inspection of the plot shows that the items were 
clustered  into  three  distinct  regions.  These  regions  are 
conceptualised  as:  1)  promoting  the  safety  and  health 
of mental health consumers; 2) enabling the daily living 
functional  recovery  of  mental  health  consumers  and  3) 
impact of caring on caregivers’ personal lives. Note that 
one  of  the  items,  ‘annoyed  others’,  did  not  clearly  fall 
into a distinct region, and hence was not included in the 
interpretation of the findings.

Region 1: promoting the safety and health of mental health 
consumers
The region captures some of the concerns of carers which 
lead them to adopt a more protective stance as a way of 
promoting the safety and health of consumers for whom 
they care. Table 3 displays the seven items encapsulated 
in  the  promoting  safety  and  health  region.  The  overall 
mean  value  for  the  promoting  safety  and  health  region 
was 1.7. As can be seen from the mean values for the indi-
vidual items, the respondents are most concerned by their 
relatives'/friends' general health. Such concern is unsur-
prising  as  mental  health  consumers  often  experience

The  item  with  the  next  highest  mean  value  in  this 
region reflected concern about the healthcare their rela-
tives/friends is receiving. The qualitative material showed 
that respondents are worried about several aspects of the 
delivery  of  mental  healthcare.  Many  respondents  stated 
that it is difficult to access services, especially in regional 
or rural areas, for example:

Physical  health  problems  are  compounded  by  men-
tal  health.  (My)  partner  also  has  diabetes,  sleep  ap-
noea, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol,  arthritis,  severe  hearing  loss  and  more. 
(Participant 120)

Help for mental illness is practically non-existent in 
rural  areas.  The  nearest  mental  health  facility  is  a 
two hour  trip  away  and  it  hasn't  been  helpful  at  all. 
Firstly,  I  have  found  the  person  presenting  is  inter-
viewed  by  an  intake  officer,  and  that  intake  officer

but others were eventually able to obtain adequate mental 
healthcare:

Getting help for my son and guidance for me to help 
him has been an arduous and very lengthy process. If 
I wasn't as steadfast and committed I may have given 
up several times after being told ‘NO’. I have had to 
struggle to find the few people that are now involved 
in  my  son's  care,  and  they  are  brilliant  most  of  the 
time. But they didn't all come to help us, I had to re-
search hard to find them over years. (Participant 84)

The item that enquired about carers’ worry in regard to 
their friends'/relatives' safety also recorded a relatively high 
mean score. However, the phrasing used for this item meant 
that  it  is  difficult  to  identify  explicit  safety  issues.  Finally, 
the mean scores for the items that captured details about 
concern over self-harm, alcohol and illegal substances are 
relatively low. But these issues are nonetheless a source of 
substantial concern for some respondents, as the following 
excerpt demonstrates:

Alcohol  in  the  quantities  that  he  consumes  is  total-
ly destructive. It is an overwhelming burden to have 
a  child  of  any  age,  want  to  destroy  themselves  this 
way.  So  in  answer  to  the  question  ‘Do  I  guard  him 
from self-harm, consuming drugs and excessive alco-
hol?’ the answer is a huge yes, always!—but I cannot 
stop  him,  and  I  cannot  control  him,  only  encour-
age, support and guide him to the best of my ability. 
(Participant 84)

Region 2: impact of caring on caregivers’ personal lives
The  second  neighbourhood  of  items  illustrated  on  the 
two-dimensional  plot  emphasises  the  personal  impact  of 
caring  on  carers’  lives  (table  4).  The  overall  mean  value 
for this region was 1.8. The mean values for the individual 
items in this region indicate that the respondents are most 
troubled by the carer burden that resulted from their rela-
tives'/friends' mental health problems. Some respondents 
noted that caring for mental health consumers is accompa-
nied by a sense of loss that had both physical and mental 
health consequences:

It would be useful to look at the issue of ambiguous 
loss  for  family  carers,  particularly  for  those  who  are 
long-term  family  carers.  This  is  something  that  is

analysis.

makes a decision based possibly upon the criteria for 
the  day;  if  all  the  boxes  aren't  checked,  the  person 
presenting  gets  no  help.  This  has  been  my  experi-
ence with my family member, turned away because all 
the boxes weren't checked and terrible consequences 
followed. (Participant 42)

In  some  cases,  the  lack  in  continuity  of  care  is  the 
primary  concern,  which  undermined  the  relationship 
between carers and health professionals, and left carers’ 
feeling isolated and concerned:

…the mental health system is that it is so disjointed 
and I find it hard who to trust with our information 
and finding someone that cares enough to follow-up 
and support me. (Participant 57)

Inadequate  government  support  is  often  thought  to 
detrimentally  impact  on  the  quality  of  mental  health-
care.  The  paucity  of  support  meant  that  the  onus  for 
care  fell  on  the  respondents:  ‘governments  have  let  us 
down immeasurably and as a result the burden has been 
immense’.  Some  respondents  are  left  feeling  hopeless,

mental (grief and depression) health. (Participant 7)

Another  issue  that  several  respondents  noted  has  an 
impact  on  physical  and  mental  health  is  the  substantial 
amount of time devoted to caring, which results in social 
isolation,  less  time  given  to  other  family  members  and 
neglect of their own well-being. As one respondent put it:

You  feel  very  alone.  You  just  wish  you  could  have 
time to yourself. You don't want to walk on eggshells 
any more. You want to celebrate your other kids and 
spend time with them but your attention is always di-
verted  towards  this  one.  When  I'm  not  with  them  I 
worry  are  they  ok.  I  would  just  like  to  be  by  myself 
without having to worry. (Participant 74)

This sense of isolation in some instances was compounded 

by a lack of support from family members:

I  do  find  I  isolate  and  insulate  myself  as  my  family 
won't  discuss  it,  they  don't  want  to  know  as  it's  too 
stressful. My son's father abandoned him 3 years ago 
as he cannot cope with his mental illness. (Participant 
17)

In  addition  to  the  physical  and  mental  health  conse-
quences,  respondents  also  often  drew  attention  to  the 
financial burden associated with caregiving. Time spent on 
caring  meant  that  respondents  are  unable  to  participate 
fully in the workforce. This directly impacts materially on 
the respondents’ ‘own future’, which is another of the items 
in  the  personal  impact  region  that  has  a  relatively  high 
mean  value.  Other  concerns  that  carers  hold  about  their 
future involve the effect on career prospects and lifestyle, as 
can be seen from the following excerpts:

I was extremely depressed when I was a full-time car-
er. I deferred university, failed subjects and lost touch 
with my own aspirations. (Participant 73)

It's hard to express the impact it has on my life. It's 
the day-to-day impact, the need to be there or in con-
tact  at  anytime.  The  need  to  consider  her  needs  in 
all  my  decisions.  The  impact  on  my  future  plans—I 
would dearly love to go live overseas, but my mother 

6

is still relatively young, and as much as it feels wrong 
to  say  this,  she  may  live  a  long  time  and  make  my 
dreams impossible. (Participant 67)

The  remaining  items  in  the  personal  impact  region 
captured  details  about  interpersonal  tension  between 
carers and mental health consumers. Relatively high mean 
values were reported for the items that enquired about the 
strained  atmosphere,  quarrels  and  annoyance  at  the  rela-
tives'/friends'  behaviour.  These  issues  could  be  especially 
distressing, as one respondent noted:

It's more than hard—dealing with this is something 
one  can't  explain  and  the  emotional  verbal  assaults 
we get from him is soul destroying. (Participant 16)

Given the often substantial nature of the ongoing inter-
personal  tension,  especially  for  those  carers  undertaking 
this  work  on  a  long-term  basis,  it  would  be  understand-
able if carers discontinued their support of mental health 
consumers.  Yet  some  carers  demonstrate  extraordinary 
levels of empathy and resilience, as was the case with this 
respondent:

Caring for my husband is a tremendous burden. His 
episodes are full of emotional abuse, anger coupled 
with destruction of property and then feelings of the 
very deepest self-loathing. For me though, it's given 
me a greater capacity to improve myself and to expe-
rience empathy when it's not the natural response in 
this situation. No matter how much he hurts me, and 
believe  me  he  really  does,  it's  nothing  compared  to 
how much he is hurting and hates himself. My heart 
breaks  for  him.  He  suffers  from  a  biological  illness 
that  affects  every  part  of  him.  His  relationships,  his 
day-to-day life. Underneath the imbalance is the rea-
son I married him. (Participant 24)

Region 3: enabling daily living functional recovery of mental health 
consumers
The third area clearly identified in the space emphasises 
the  carers’  role  in  the  recovery  journey  for  consumers. 
Table 5 displays the 12 items encapsulated in the enabling 
daily  living  functional  recovery  region.  The  overall 
mean  value  for  this  region  was  2.4.  Many  of  the  items 
in  this  region  enquire  about  aspects  of  caring  that  can 
be  conceptualised  as  supporting  social  and  functional

components of mental health recovery. In terms of func-
tional recovery, encouraging and helping mental health 
consumers with self-care and normal tasks, and concerns 
about  consumers’  ability  to  manage  financially,  are  the 
items  with  highest  mean  values.  Assisting  with  self-care 
and  normal  tasks  could  be  onerous  and  is  an  area  in 
which  professional  support  would  be  beneficial,  as  the 
following excerpts demonstrate:

I feel it's a battle I am fighting but losing. I struggle 
with him to look after himself personally to do basic 
hygiene (shower, brush teeth, change clothes) I am 
now looking at groups online to seek help not only 
him but myself. (Participant 16)

Ironing,  vacuum  cleaning,  cleaning  floors,  and  all 
other  household  duties  is  not  leaving  me  with  any 
time…  her  inability  to  accept  help  in  her  personal 
washing and getting into her clothing makes for a lot 
of time lost in a day. I am about to seek help from the 
professionals. (Participant 70)

Exhaustion  is  constant  as  my  partner  relies  on  me 
totally  for  his  social  support  and  talks  non-stop. 
(Participant 8)

Finally, in the enabling daily living functional recovery 
region, the second highest mean value was recorded for 
the  item  that  asked  the  respondents  if  they  are  worried 
about  their  relatives'/friends'  future.  It  is  unsurprising 
that carers are often concerned about the mental health 
consumers’ prospects. As the above material has shown, it 
is not uncommon for mental health consumers to expe-
rience  social  isolation  and  struggle  with  daily  activities 
and  finances.  The  journey  towards  recovering  pieces  of 
consumers’ lives clearly requires time and is difficult, but 
could nonetheless be gratifying for carers:

It  is  tough  at  times,  but  you  get  some  little  rewards 
along the way when they achieve things on their own. 
(Participant 78)

Financial  concerns  are  one  of  the  most  frequently 
raised issues in the open-ended responses. A key element 
of these concerns is the inadequate level of government 
financial assistance:

He  is  on  the  disability  support,  and  after  rent,  has 
only  less  then  $200  a  fortnight  to  feed  himself,  buy 
petrol  and  food,  feed  dogs…  so  guess  who  pays  for 
the  necessities?  It  is  quite  a  strain  and  the  National 
Disability Insurance Scheme has not been able to as-
sist in the way he would like. (Participant 85)

The items that captured information about aspects of 
social recovery generally had lower mean values than the 
functional  recovery  items.  And  while  the  importance  of 
facilitating social inclusion was noted, it appears to be an 
issue that is difficult to resolve. As one respondent put it:

DisCussiOn
The regions identified through the SSA provide a basis to 
understand the manner in which carers prioritise issues 
that  arise  in  supporting  mental  health  consumers.  The 
analysis  demonstrates  that  carers  are  most  concerned 
with enabling daily living functional recovery, for which 
the mean value is considerably higher than the personal 
impact and promoting safety regions. In terms of the indi-
vidual questionnaire items, the issues of most importance 
are  assisting  with  self-care,  worrying  about  consumers’ 
future, 
finances  and  general  health,  encouraging 
consumer involvement in activities and concerns over the 
treatment consumers are receiving.

The high level of concern that respondents report about 
daily living functional recovery suggests that the provision 
of services that assist with these issues may contribute to 
the  reduction  of  caregiver  burden.  Psychiatric  disability

services  are  available  in  the  community  throughout 
Australia  to  help  carers  and  mental  health  consumers 
with  tasks  like  activities  of  daily  living,  housing,  recre-
ational  and  social  activities  and  employment  opportuni-
ties.39 However, the extent to which Australian carers and 
mental  health  consumers  access  these  services  is  pres-
ently  unknown.  Further  studies  might  be  beneficial  in 
identifying whether the provision of psychiatric disability 
support services adequately address the needs of mental 
health caregivers in regard to assistance with consumers 
daily living functional recovery.

It  was  unsurprising  to  find  that  financial  concerns 
figure prominently in the open-ended responses and also 
have a high mean item rating. Many mental health carers 
forgo  employment  or  reduce  their  working  hours  while 
supporting  consumers.40  41  In  Australia,  modest  income 
support  payments  are  available  to  mental  health  carers 
who  do  not  work,  but  these  payments  are  only  acces-
sible  to  a  small  proportion  of  carers.40  42  The  hardship 
that results from the lack of adequate financial assistance 
is  further  compounded  by  the  often  substantial  level  of 
financial  support  that  carers  provide  to  mental  health 
consumers.40

Our  findings  show  that  health  professionals  also  have 
an  important  role  to  play  in  alleviating  mental  health 
caregiver  burden.  Concerns  over  the  provision  of  metal 
healthcare  are  highlighted  in  this  study,  especially  in 
regard  to  being  isolated  from  the  care  that  consumers 
were  receiving.  Such  issues  reflect  the  results  of  other 
mental  health  carer  studies  that  have  been  conducted 
in  Australia  and  within  the  UK.6  43  To  some  extent,  the 
concern  that  carers  experience  in  regard  to  the  provi-
sion  of  services  might  be  lessened  through  exploring 
and incorporating their views in planning and delivering 
mental healthcare.4

limitations
The  demographic  details  of  Australian  mental  health 
carers  vary  considerably  between  studies.  It  is  therefore 
difficult  to  develop  a  standardised  profile  of  Australian 
mental  health  caregivers.  However,  the  demographic 
characteristics of the carers in this study are highly consis-
tent with the details reported in the most recent study of 
Australian mental health caregivers, which to some extent 
supports  the  generalisability  of  our  findings.40  Finally, 
our value for the coefficient of alienation equalled 0.21, 
which  was  marginally  outside  of  the  range  of  0.15–0.20 
that is considered to represent a good fit.37 That said, the 
coefficient of alienation should be interpreted in light of 
the  SSA  visual  structure,  which  in  the  case  of  our  study 
clearly delineated distinct regions.37

COnClusiOn
Our  findings  demonstrate  that  carers’  prioritise  roles 
that  promote  the  recovery  of  mental  health  consumers. 
However,  such  caregiving  often 
incurs  significant 
personal  cost.  The  burden  that  results  from  caring  for

mental  health  consumers  could  perhaps  be  alleviated 
through  the  expansion  of  psychiatric  disability  services, 
increasing  government  financial  support  and  involving 
families  more  closely  in  the  planning  and  delivery  of 
mental health services. Such assistance would improve the 
circumstances of caregivers, and would probably enhance 
the recovery of mental health consumers.
