Abstract

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous, multisystem autoimmune disorder 
characterized by unpredictable disease flares. Although the pathogenesis of SLE is complex, an 
epidemiologic link between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the development of SLE has 
been identified, suggesting that stress-related disorders alter the susceptibility to SLE. Despite the 
strong epidemiologic evidence connecting PTSD and SLE, gaps remain in our understanding of 
how the two may be connected. Perturbations in the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine 
system, and at the genomic level may cause and sustain immune dysregulation that could lower 
the threshold for the development and propagation of SLE. We first describe shared risk factors 
for SLE and PTSD. We then describe potential biological pathways which may facilitate excessive 
inflammation in the context of PTSD. Among those genetically predisposed to SLE, systemic 
inflammation that accompanies chronic stress may fan the flames of smoldering SLE by priming 
immune pathways. Further studies on the connection between trauma and inflammation will 
provide important data on pathogenesis, risk factors, and novel treatments for SLE.

Introduction

1.1  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

Page 2

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a life-threatening, heterogeneous, chronic 
autoimmune disease characterized by immune system autoreactivity, autoantibody 
production, and immune complex deposition, as well as significant sociodemographic 
disparities.1 Estimates of SLE prevalence in US populations range between 0.05% 
and 0.2%.2 SLE disproportionally affects women (prevalence is 6 times higher in 
women compared to men), US minority racial and ethnic groups (prevalence is nearly 
doubled in African American women compared to White women), and individuals of 
lower socioeconomic status (SES).3 Hallmarks of SLE include multi-organ dysfunction 
and high morbidity and mortality. It is thought that SLE develops in stages, with a 
break in self-tolerance resulting in autoantibody and inflammatory cytokine upregulation 
preceding symptoms.1 Disease flares are associated with pain, fatigue, depression, and 
difficulty sleeping, and has an overall profoundly negative impact on health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL).1 Many types of neuropsychiatric symptoms can occur in SLE, 
affecting approximately 40% of patients at diagnosis and a majority during their disease 
course.4 Treatment for SLE typically involves hydroxychloroquine as maintenance therapy, 
corticosteroids to control disease flares, and cytotoxic-immunosuppressants and biologic 
agents to reduce disease activity.1 Among patients with SLE, suboptimal medication 
adherence is highly prevalent with a recent systematic review finding that over half of 
patients with SLE are non-adherent to their regimens.5

The current etiologic model for SLE is that environmental exposures lower the threshold 
for or accelerate SLE development among those who are genetically predisposed.6 Genetic 
factors are thought to explain a portion of SLE risk, leaving a large role for exposures 
that may act specifically or non-specifically by increasing systemic inflammation.1 While 
mechanisms underlying sex and racial disparities of SLE are not completely understood, 
socioeconomic factors, genetic differences, occupational environmental exposures, and 
hormonal triggers are likely contributors.3 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among 
the strongest risk factors for developing SLE and also tends to be more prevalent among 
racial/ethnic minoriites.7

1.2  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

PTSD is common and debilitating with a prevalence of 7% in civilian US adults and double 
that in most surveys of military populations.8 The risk in civilians is also at least double 
in women versus men and with PTSD prevalence rates greater among Black individuals 
compared to White individuals (8.7% vs. 7.4%).9,10 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders-5th edition criteria for PTSD include the development of post-traumatic 
symptoms in four diagnostic symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal 
and negative cognitions and mood.11 Although exposure to a stressful event is required 
for PTSD diagnosis, only some trauma-exposed individuals develop the disorder (~14% 
overall in community samples, but ~34% after violent assault).12 Factors that increase risk 
of developing PTSD include experiencing a trauma that involves interpersonal violence 
exposure, female sex, severity and chronicity of trauma, preexisting psychiatric disorders,

1.3  Complex Interplay between PTSD and SLE

PTSD prevalence has been reported to be elevated among those with SLE and it could 
have considerable impact on adverse clinical outcomes and HRQoL in SLE.7 First, 
the systemic inflammation that accompanies chronic stress could feed the flames of 
smoldering autoimmune disease and prime immune and inflammatory pathways, thereby 
increasing SLE disease activity and the frequency and severity of SLE flares. Second, 
PTSD may deleteriously affect outcomes and quality of life in SLE through a number 
of other pathways.16 PTSD is associated with comorbid substance use disorders, self-
injurious behavior, and cardiometabolic disease14 all of which could impact SLE activity 
and treatment-seeking behaviors. Long-term sequelae of PTSD include disruption of 
critical support and familial networks, interference with parenting roles, and exacerbation 
of socioeconomic vulnerabilities.14 Sleep disturbances in PTSD such as insomnia and 
nightmares may exacerbate pain and depressive symptoms.14

PTSD may develop in response to diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and interfere 
with treatment adherence.17 Cancer-related PTSD, for example, is characterized by 
symptoms including intrusions (flashbacks related to treatment), avoidance (denial related 
to diagnosis), and hyperarousal with triggers embedded in the healthcare experience 
including follow-up appointments and routine surveillance.17 Untreated cancer-related 
PTSD symptoms are associated with oncologic treatment non-adherence.17 It is unknown 
if SLE and its treatment induce similar PTSD symptoms. Potential triggering events 
in SLE care could include physical contact, such as physical exams, and invasive 
procedures, including hemodialysis, blood draws, arthrocentesis, or biopsies. Given that 
stress exacerbations are linked to SLE activity, it is important to identify, and potentially 
ameliorate, triggers related to healthcare delivery.

Here we review the epidemiologic evidence to support a connection between SLE and PTSD 
and potential biologic mechanisms underlying this connection. This review is intended 
for both clinicians, including those who diagnose and treat mental health disorders and 
autoimmune diseases, and investigators of these health conditions.

2.  Epidemiologic relationship of PTSD to SLE Risk

The link between PTSD and autoimmune disease has been studied in a variety of cohorts 
including combat veterans and the general population (Table 1). Early studies tended to 
consider associations with autoimmune diseases rather than focusing on SLE as a distinct 
entity. For example, Boscarino et al. demonstrated that PTSD among Vietnam veterans 
was significantly associated with increased likelihood of having any autoimmune disease 
(OR = 3.3 [95% CI 2.0-5.7]).18 Another study which classified autoimmune diseases by 
T helper (Th) subtype, found that individuals with adverse childhood experiences score ≥2 
were more likely to be hospitalized for a Th2 rheumatic disease, including SLE (HR= 2.0 
[95% CI 1.3-3.2]).19 Further epidemiologic studies which focused on civilian populations 
observed statistically significant associations between PTSD and the risk of developing

SLE. Among women in the Nurses’ Health Study II, trauma exposure and high levels 
of PTSD symptoms were associated with an almost tripled SLE risk (HR 2.94 [95% CI 
1.19-7.26]), even after accounting for smoking, body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, SES, 
and other potential confounders.7 In a follow-up study among women in the Nurses’ Health 
Study (NHS), childhood physical and emotional abuse was associated with a 2.57 greater 
risk of SLE (95% CI: 1.30-5.12).20 Among women in the Black Women’s Health Study 
(BWHS), childhood exposure to either sexual and physical abuse were strongly associated 
with increased risk of developing SLE as an adult; each had multivariable-adjusted HRs of 
>2 (unfortunately PTSD measures were not collected in BWHS).21 Case et al. also found 
that PTSD among adults enrolled in Medicaid was significantly associated with SLE (ARR 
= 2 [95% CI 1.64-2.46]).22

While these studies demonstrate an intriguing epidemiologic connection between PTSD 
and SLE, there are several methodologic challenges to consider. First, studies with a 
shorter follow-up time may not have captured an association between PTSD and SLE if 
the study ended before the emergence of SLE. This is especially pertinent for SLE since 
a delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is a well-documented phenomenon.23 
While many of the studies excluded participants with an autoimmune condition predating 
the stress-related diagnosis to control for reverse causation (prodromal-disease causing 
distress),7,22,24–26 this does limit our understanding of a possible bidirectional and dynamic 
relationship between SLE and PTSD.

Another key limitation of these studies is the lack of a diverse study population despite 
SLE being more prevalent and severe among racial/ethnic minorities.3 Except for a few 
recent studies,21,22 most of these epidemiologic connections were observed among cohorts 
of largely white individuals and several of the studies were in veteran populations of mainly 
men. Additionally, the studies may have been affected by SLE’s female predominance 
as studies restricting the sample population to females detected a significant relationship 
between PTSD and SLE-risk, while studies including male participants had difficulty 
detecting an association between PTSD and SLE-risk.25,26 The underlying mechanisms 
for these gender disparities remain to be further elucidated and it possible that the 
low prevalence of SLE among men limits the ability to detect associations with PTSD. 
Finally, since neuropsychiatric symptoms of SLE can present early in the disease course, 
it is possible that some of these studies conflated comorbid PTSD with neuropsychiatric 
manifestations of SLE.27 Despite these methodologic limitations, these epidemiologic 
studies illuminate important associations between stress-related diseases and immune system 
dysregulation as evidenced by the onset of SLE. Key strengths of these studies include large 
aggregate sample size24 and valid associations after controlling for possible confounders 
including sociodemographic and biobehavioral factors.7,20–22

3.  SLE: Shared Risk Factors and Racial/Ethnic Disparities

Strong epidemiologic evidence connects PTSD and risk of SLE as well as other autoimmune 
diseases, yet gaps in our understanding remain. Social structure or other factors (i.e., 
biobehavioral, sex, race/ethnicity, individual and area-level socioeconomic factors) may 
modify risk of developing SLE as sequelae of PTSD.

Specific biobehavioral factors, such as cigarette smoking, obesity, poor dietary quality, and 
lack of physical exercise, may serve as a vulnerability for the development of persons 
with a trauma exposure who later develop SLE. Exposures contribute to SLE risk: current 
smoking and obesity were strongly associated with SLE risk in the NHS and the BWHS.6 
These risk factors for SLE, are frequently observed in persons with PTSD (Figure 2). 
For example, PTSD is commonly associated with higher rates of substance use disorders, 
cigarette smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity.28 While the mechanisms remain to be 
fully elucidated, biobehavioral factors may partially mediate the connection between PTSD 
and increased SLE risk.

In addition to the role of biobehavioral factors, sex and race/ethnicity may also contribute 
to the epidemiologic link between PTSD and SLE. Women are at twice the risk of PTSD 
and account for ~90% of SLE cases.3 As in SLE, there are well-known differences in 
PTSD risk by sex with women exhibiting twice the risk of PTSD as men, when exposed 
to similar traumas.29 PTSD, like SLE, is also more prevalent in US minority racial and 
ethnic groups; among men and women, positive PTSD screening rates were significantly 
elevated among Black, multiracial, and Latinx veterans compared with White veterans.30 
Additionally, younger age, being less educated, having lower household income, and being 
unemployed, have all been associated with increased risk of PTSD, and these are the same 
groups that are at increased risk of SLE and poor SLE outcomes.3,9 Black women with 
SLE are more likely to be diagnosed at younger ages and to have greater disease burden, 
including a higher prevalence of lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, compared 
to their White counterparts.3,31 Disadvantaged and minority populations more often face 
numerous stressors, including physical or sexual abuse, poverty, housing instability, racism, 
and loss of loved one, which are uncontrollable situations that can overwhelm coping 
abilities.32 Social disadvantage, due to race or SES, leads to higher exposure to stressors and 
traumatic life events and thus risk for developing PTSD. Lifetime prevalence rates of PTSD 
are higher in urban neighborhoods with a greater poverty burden. For example, The Detroit 
Neighborhood Health Study found that the prevalence of PTSD among African American 
residents was 17%.33 PTSD likely negatively impacts the outcomes of those with SLE who 
are also overrepresented in socially disadvantaged groups.32

Exposure to trauma during childhood is a noteworthy risk factor of both PTSD and 
SLE. In a prospective study of 480 Dutch military personnel, childhood trauma exposure 
independently predicted the development of post-deployment PTSD symptoms.34 In a 
cohort of largely White women, Feldman et al. found that childhood abuse (physical and 
emotional) was associated with three times higher risk of SLE during adulthood20. Cozier 
et at. observed similar results: Black women with a childhood exposure to either sexual 
and physical abuse were strongly associated with increased risk of developing SLE as an 
adult.21 Childhood trauma exposure, specifically when temporally correlated with critical 
maturation periods, may disrupt the development of endocrine and nervous systems, thereby 
precipitating immune system dysfunction and conferring vulnerability to SLE.35 Several 
studies have focused on the impact of childhood trauma-exposure on the development 
of PTSD and immune system dysregulation. Early life trauma-exposure has not only 
been associated with increased prevalence and severity of adult onset PTSD,36 but also 
pro-inflammatory states even in the absence of PTSD psychopathology.37

Here we review biological mechanisms of immune system dysregulation that may underlie 
epidemiologic links between PTSD and SLE.

4.  Potential Biologic Mechanisms linking PTSD and SLE Risk

Several biological pathways may link PTSD to increased SLE risk with evidence for 
low-grade systemic inflammation in people affected by PTSD.16 This PTSD-related pro-
inflammatory state is likely related to perturbations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system, and potential changes to genetic expression.14

Under normal circumstances, the body adapts to stress by producing catecholamines, 
specifically norepinephrine, via the sympathetic nervous system and activating the HPA 
axis to mobilize fight-or-flight behavior by modulating blood flow, arousal, encoding of 
memories, and promoting a pro-inflammatory state (Figure 3).38 At the same time, one 
end-product of the HPA axis activation, cortisol, is produced to terminate the threat-response 
via negative feedback mechanisms at upstream sites including the pituitary gland and 
hypothalamus.39 These regulatory processes involve coordinated interactions of endocrine, 
immune, and nervous systems.40 Since only some of those with trauma exposure develop 
PTSD12, the disorder has been conceptualized as the inability to physiologically adapt to 
stress as a consequence of the “dissociation” or “uncoupling” of the endocrine, immune, and 
nervous systems, in addition to the re-experiencing of symptoms.38,40,41

4.1  Pro-Inflammatory State

PTSD and SLE share similar profiles of immune system dysregulation, and this may 
in part facilitate the epidemiologic link between the two disorders. Two meta-analyses 
identified 40 articles investigating patterns of inflammatory markers in PTSD.42,43 While 
both analyses observed marked heterogeneity among studies, they also found that when 
compared to controls, PTSD was associated with indicators of heightened immune 
activity including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell counts, and circulating 
pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, interferon-γ, and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). These pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulate the 
inflammatory responses via pathways involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and 
corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation.44 NF-κB transcriptional pathways promote 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and stimulate B and T cell proliferation, maturation, 
and differentiation.45 Excessive NF-κB signaling has been observed in PTSD, with some 
studies demonstrating greater NF-κB binding activity and upregulation of target genes of 
NF-κB among individuals of PTSD when compared to controls.46 This pro-inflammatory 
state in PTSD is further bolstered by diminished production of anti-inflammatory cytokines 
including IL-4 and II-10, which are important for the resolution of the inflammatory 
response by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production.47

Patients with PTSD appear to have skewed immune cell populations further propagating a 
pro-inflammatory state. For example, excessive cytokine activity in PTSD may skew the 
balance of Th cells; however, there does not appear to be a consensus on how to translate 
alterations in cytokine measurements into a declaration of a Th1 or Th2 predominance.48,49 
Studies have demonstrated dysregulated regulatory T cells (Tregs) among PTSD patients and

both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies.50,51 For example, Sommershof et al., observed 
a nearly 50% reduction in proportion of peripheral Tregs among refugees with PTSD when 
compared to controls.51 Dysfunctional Tregs have been associated with several autoimmune 
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and psoriasis, and may also contribute 
to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer’s disease.52 Finally, immune cell populations of PTSD cohorts are 
associated with markers of senescence including shorter leukocyte telomere lengths.48

Similar patterns of skewed immunological markers and imbalances of Th cells have 
been observed in autoimmune diseases including SLE.53 When compared to healthy 
controls, individuals with SLE display higher levels of circulating IL-6 and TNF-α, with 
some studies demonstrating positive correlations between SLE disease activity and IL-6 
levels.53 Insufficient Treg functioning has been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
SLE as Tregs are responsible for maintaining self-tolerance through the regulation of self-
reactive lymphocytes.54 A recent meta-analysis found a significantly reduced proportion of 
peripheral Tregs among individuals with SLE when compared to healthy controls.55 Finally, 
biomarkers of cellular senescence including telomere shortening have also been observed in 
SLE, with a meta-analysis observing shorter telomeres in individuals with SLE even after 
controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and assay type.56

However, PTSD as a state of heightened immunity is not a consistent finding throughout 
the literature with several studies not finding significant differences of inflammatory markers 
among individuals with PTSD compared to controls. For example, Von Känel et al. observed 
no significant differences in levels of circulating IL-6 or CRP among individuals with PTSD 
from accidental trauma when compared to trauma-exposed controls.47 In a study of all 
male Croatian combat veterans, Jergovic et al., also observed no differences in CRP levels 
among men with PTSD compared to healthy controls.50 In a prospective study of Dutch 
military personnel, individuals who developed PTSD six months after deployment displayed 
telomere lengthening, rather than shortening, when compared to combat-exposed controls.57

Meta-analyses have observed a large extent of heterogeneity between studies and attributed 
discrepancies to factors including exposure to psychotropic medications, trauma-exposure 
among controls, sex co-morbid major depressive disorder, and timing of blood draws.42,43 
Other methodologic considerations include diverse trauma exposures (combat,58 intimate 
partner violence,59 war refugees,60 violent assault61) inconsistent controlling for childhood 
trauma exposure61, inconsistent duration of time between trauma exposure and study period, 
variable cytokine measurements (mitogen-stimulated vs. circulating cytokine62), variable 
NF-κB measurements (binding activity46 vs. transcription factor expression63) and limited 
prospective studies.

Another methodologic consideration is the lack of consistent exclusion of co-morbid 
autoimmune disorders. While a few studies of inflammatory markers among individuals 
with PTSD explicitly excluded participants with autoimmune diseases,60,61,64,65 two studies 
included participants with co-morbid autoimmune diseases.66,67 This limits our ability to 
appreciate the impact of PTSD on immune system regulation if participants also have an 
inflammatory condition, such as an autoimmune disease. Furthermore, since most of the

studies did not follow participants longitudinally, it is unknown if participants with PTSD 
who displayed markers of a pro-inflammatory state were actually in a prodromal period 
and later developed an autoimmune disease. A final methodologic consideration is the 
reliance on peripheral biomarkers as surrogate indicators for immune system activity. In a 
recent study, Bhatt et al. observed that PTSD severity was positively correlated with CRP 
levels among individuals with PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls.68 However, 
when measuring markers of neuroinflammation via positron emission tomography (PET) 
scan, PTSD severity and CRP levels were negatively associated with neuroinflammation. 
This divergent data further complicates our understanding of the interpterion of peripheral 
inflammatory biomarkers.

4.2  Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation and Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis 
Dysfunction

Autonomic nervous system signaling among individuals with PTSD patients appears 
to be dysregulated and studies demonstrate excess sympathetic drive and reduced 
parasympathetic activity.69 Heightened sympathetic reactivity is thought to mediate 
pathognomonic PTSD symptoms including flashbacks and hyperarousal via noradrenergic 
signaling.70 Additionally, this exaggerated sympathetic response is hypothesized to maintain 
a pro-inflammatory state observed in PTSD via complex neural connections between the 
brain, thymus, spleen, and lymphocytes via adrenergic signaling.16,44 The binding of 
norepinephrine to beta-2 adrenergic receptors (β2 adrenoreceptor) on lymphocytes may 
stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB signal-transduction 
pathways.39,44 Simultaneously, parasympathetic signaling through interactions between the 
vagus nerve and alpha-7 nicotinic (α7) receptors is thought to counterbalance and restrain 
the pro-inflammatory response.71

Various parameters have been utilized to measure autonomic nervous system functioning, 
including norepinephrine levels and muscle sympathetic nerve activity as surrogate 
markers of the sympathetic nervous system, and heart rate variability as a measurement 
of parasympathetic activity. A recent meta-analysis of 27 studies observed higher 
concentrations of plasma and urinary norepinephrine among individuals with PTSD when 
compared to controls.72 Heart rate variability is an indicator of parasympathetic activity with 
lower heart rate variability indicating withdrawal of the parasympathetic nervous system.73 
While a meta-analysis of 19 articles found that PTSD was associated with lower heart 
rate variability at rest,74 another meta-analysis of eight articles also found lower heart rate 
variability among individuals with PTSD under stress conditions although this did not reach 
significance.75 In a study of post-9/11 veterans, Fonkoue et al. linked PTSD with impaired 
parasympathetic signaling and biomarkers of inflammation, hypothesizing that dysregulation 
in autonomic function may facilitate a pro-inflammatory state.73 In association with higher 
plasma levels of TNF-α, they observed less heart rate variability among veterans with 
PTSD compared to veterans without PTSD. While these studies do offer cursory evidence 
of impaired autonomic signaling in PTSD, key methodologic limitations include diverse 
study conditions (measurements collected at rest74 or under stress-conditions76), inclusion

In addition to heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and insufficient 
parasympathetic activity, low-grade inflammation in PTSD may be further perpetuated 
through HPA axis dysregulation, which is classically characterized as hypocortisolemia and 
insufficient glucocorticoid signaling.16,44

Under normal circumstances, the inflammatory response is dampened by binding of cortisol 
to glucocorticoid receptors (GR) on lymphocytes to promote apoptosis and inhibit NF-κB 
pathways to balance cytokine production.39,44 In addition, cortisol is a key modulator of 
negative feedback of the HPA axis at various upstream sites including GRs localized to 
the pituitary gland and hypothalamamus.39 Low levels of circulating cortisol may promote 
excessive inflammation due to cortisol’s compromised ability to exert its anti-inflammatory 
properties.44 A pro-inflammatory state may be further sustained via alterations in GR 
sensitivity, thereby impacting the anti-inflammatory effects of cortisol as well as HPA axis 
set-point.77

In a recent meta-analysis, Pan et al. found significantly lower morning salivary cortisol 
levels in PTSD when compared to controls.78 Of note, this meta-analysis included diverse 
trauma-exposures, children with PTSD, as well as controls with and without trauma-
exposure. Among individual studies, there are discrepancies on whether hypocortisolemia 
is a hallmark of PTSD. For example, in a study of 71 women, participants with PTSD 
exhibited lower levels of salivary cortisol when compared to controls with and without 
trauma exposure.79 However, in a study of combat veterans, there were no differences in 
plasma cortisol levels in comparing participants with PTSD and controls.64

In addition to hypocortisolemia, PTSD is generally thought to reflect a state of GR 
hypersensitivity.44 Various techniques have been utilized to measure GR sensitivity, 
including concentration of dexamethasone required to suppress lysozyme activity80 and 
cytokine production46,81 as well as immunofluorescence and radioligand binding as proxies 
for receptor density.80 While many studies do find evidence of greater GR sensitivity in 
PTSD, this is not a consistent finding. For example, Yehuda et al. observed that men with 
PTSD exhibited greater GR sensitivity as interpreted by dexamethasone suppression of 
lysozyme activity; however, there was no difference in number of cytosolic GR among 
individuals with PTSD and controls when measured via radioligand binding.80 In a study 
of Bosnian war refugees, a lower concentration of dexamethasone was required to suppress 
IL-6 and TNF-α81; however, in a study of women with PTSD from childhood trauma, 
there was no difference in the concentration of dexamethasone necessary to suppress TNF-α 
production in whole blood.46 Some of the methodologic limitations which may contribute 
to discrepancies in the data include potential gender differences in GR sensitivity63 and 
limitations in interpreting GR sensitivity from a diverse set of methods. Another key 
limitation is the utilization of peripheral biomarkers to infer conclusions about the function 
of GR on different tissues including lymphocytes and throughout the HPA axis.

Despite these methodologic limitations, there is evidence to suggest autonomic 
dysregulation and HPA axis dysfunction in PTSD, and it is thought perturbations in 
these biological pathways sustain a pro-inflammatory state.38,82 Yehuda uses the term 
“dissociated” to describe the phenomenon of exaggerated sympathetic activity with

dysregulated HPA axis in PTSD.82 In fact, similar language has been utilized to describe 
the relationship between the HPA axis and autonomic nervous system in SLE. For example, 
both Jung et al.83 and Härle et al.84 conclude that there is an “uncoupling” of the 
sympathetic nervous system and HPA axis in SLE as inferred by markers of heightened 
sympathetic activity and insufficient cortisol. Similar to PTSD, this “uncoupling” is thought 
to contribute to unrestrained inflammation, central to the pathophysiology of SLE. It is 
noteworthy to recognize both studies utilize diverse methodologies, including salivary 
alpha-amylase and neuropeptide Y as surrogates for sympathetic nervous system activity. 
Additionally, these SLE studies did not universally control for psychiatric illness, including 
PTSD. Nevertheless, there is evidence to suggest similar neuroendocrine dysfunction in both 
PTSD and SLE.

Interestingly, there is also evidence that within PTSD populations low-grade inflammation 
and HPA dysfunction may exist prior to trauma exposure. For example, a machine 
learning study found that pre-deployment CRP levels predicted PTSD risk among soldiers 
deployed to Afghanistan.85 In a study of Dutch military personnel, post-deployment 
PTSD symptoms were associated with a greater number of GR in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells measured prior to combat.34 And finally, lower heart rate variability 
measured pre-deployment was associated with an increased odds of being diagnosed with 
PTSD post-deployment among US marines deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.86 While it 
remains unknown how neuroendocrine and immune systems are further impacted by the 
development of PTSD, these studies do provide preliminary evidence of potential biological 
risk factors for PTSD and contribute to our understanding of the biological mechanism 
underpinning low-grade inflammation in PTSD. However, due to limited study follow-up 
time and inconsistent controlling for autoimmune diseases, it is difficult to solely attribute 
these markers to PTSD-risk. It is also plausible that these biomarkers may also mark a 
vulnerability for inflammatory conditions including SLE, and that this risk may be further 
amplified following the development of PTSD.

4.3  Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms

The connection between PTSD and heightened inflammation may be through genetic 
polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications.

A recent meta-analysis of PTSD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which included 
over 200,000 participants identified several genome-wide specific risk loci— including 
one locus with substantial immunogenic properties.87 The risk locus, rs142174523, is 
located on human leukocyte antigen (HLA)B and is also thought to regulate the expression 
of genes related to the complement system, C4A and C4B.87 A recent meta-analysis 
observed associations between C4B copy number variations and SLE susceptibility.88 
While potential polymorphisms related to inflammation may underlie the epidemiologic 
associations between PTSD and increased SLE risk, many gaps remain in our understanding. 
For example, although analysis of SLE GWAS studies have identified over 100 risk loci, 
corroborating their significance and risk in the pathophysiology of SLE is challenging.89 
Langefeld et al. proposes a “cumulative hit hypothesis” to describe the complicated and 
non-linear relationship between individuals risk variants and SLE.90 These challenges in

attributing genetic load to SLE-risk, further complicate our ability to understand shared 
genetic risk between SLE and PTSD.

Epigenetic modifications, resulting from PTSD and trauma-exposure, may be an 
additional mechanism connecting PTSD, inflammation, and SLE. A recent epigenome-wide 
association study (EWAS) which included over 1,800 participants with diverse trauma 
exposures, identified distinct DNA methylation patterns associated with PTSD when 
compared to trauma-exposed controls.91 These PTSD-specific epigenetic modifications 
localized to aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) which is thought to play a key role 
in immune system regulation via the kynurenine pathway. More specifically, this pathway 
may be important for the maintenance of self-tolerance through the regulation of Tregs.92 
Interestingly, mice with aryl-hydrocarbon receptor deficiencies develop features of systemic 
autoimmunity that are thought to resemble SLE.93 These data raise the possibility that PTSD 
may be associated with increased SLE risk through epigenetic modifications, leading to the 
loss of self-tolerance. However, a major limitation to these studies is the utilization of blood 
samples, rather than brain tissue, to understand epigenetic patterns unique to PTSD.

4.4:  Brain-Gut Axis and Dysbiosis

Disruptions to the gut microbiome, dysbiosis, may be another mechanism that contributes 
to the heightened inflammation and HPA axis dysfunction observed in PTSD.94 Animal 
models demonstrate that gut microbiota are integral to the development and function of 
the HPA axis as germ-free mice have exaggerated HPA axis activity and these alterations 
are corrected upon microbial colonization.95 Additionally, gut microbiota modulate the 
inflammatory response through a myriad of mechanisms including the regulation of Treg 
differentiation and monocyte stimulation.94

Microbiome shifts have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. Potential mechanisms 
connecting aberrant immune system activity to dysbiosis include the translocation of gut 
microbes via gut barrier disruption, molecular mimicry with gut microbiota, and irregular 
tryptophan metabolism leading to Treg dysfunction through the kynurenine pathway.96 In a 
recent meta-analysis, Xiang et al. found restricted microbial diversity among patients with 
SLE when compared to health controls.97

Compared to SLE, less is known about the relationship between dysbiosis and PTSD. 
While human studies demonstrate a relationship between PTSD and dysbiosis, the results 
are limited.98,99 For example, in a study of all male veterans with cirrhosis, participants 
with PTSD had a reduced microbial diversity (calculated with the Shannon-Wiener 
diversity index) even after controlling for alcohol intake and psychotropic medications.98 
Interestingly microbiota taxonomic patterns observed in this study are similar with those 
observed in SLE: decreased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and increased abundance 
of Enterococcacea.97 However, in a study of South African residents, no differences in 
microbial diversity were observed between participants with PTSD and trauma-exposed 
controls.99

While these studies suggest that disruptions to the microbiome may be another mechanism 
facilitating heightened inflammation observed in PTSD, there are several limitations to these

studies including inconsistent surrogate markers for microbial diversity (fecal microbial 
sequencing, fecal metabolite identification, serum metabolite identification), small sample 
sizes, and inconsistent controlling for biobehavioral factors. Nevertheless, these preliminary 
studies illuminate novel biological mechanisms which may underlie the epidemiological 
connection of PTSD with SLE.

5.  Conclusion:

SLE is a complex and enigmatic autoimmune disease. Identifying the factors associated with 
its development, the populations most at risk, and risk factors for poor outcomes are crucial 
to prevention and improving outcomes. Epidemiologic studies have identified traumatic 
experiences, including adverse childhood experiences, and PTSD as strongly related to 
autoimmune disease risk. Although the biological mechanisms connecting PTSD with 
autoimmune diseases remain to be fully elucidated, these pathways are likely magnified in 
SLE due to the population at risk and the confluence of multiple potential psychological and 
biological mechanisms. PTSD may be responsible for some of the striking disparities seen 
in SLE incidence and outcomes given its prevalence among women and disadvantaged and 
minority individuals who are exposed to higher levels of trauma, abuse, and environmental 
stress. Moreover, it is highly likely that an increased prevalence of PTSD among patients 
living with SLE has a significant deleterious effect on both clinical outcomes and patient-
reported quality of life. PTSD is a potentially modifiable factor that may explain some of the 
extreme and unexplained disparities in SLE incidence and poor outcomes.

We suggest future studies shift from peripheral blood markers of inflammation to 
neuroscience-based methodologies as blood samples may not be reliable proxies for 
neuroinflammation. Examples include further neuroimaging or utilization of brain tissue 
studies as demonstrated by Bhatt et al.68 Additional longitudinal studies are needed 
to explore the potential role of treatment of PTSD on SLE-risk. Future prospective 
epidemiologic studies should have longer follow-up times and include large populations 
of women and men from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, as the relative rarity of both 
SLE and PTSD in male populations has posed challenges for past studies. As suggested 
by Koenen et al., mendelian randomization studies would be helpful to better characterize 
shared genetic risk between PTSD and SLE.100 Because PTSD is a heterogeneous disorder, 
Koenen et al. also call for understanding and classifying PTSD by symptom clusters. Further 
studies characterizing the phenomenological presentations of PTSD unique to individuals 
with SLE would help our ability to be more precise in studying the link between these two 
diseases. Many important gaps in our understanding of this relationship exist and impede the 
best care we can offer our patients to improve their quality of life.

Only some people exposed to trauma develop PTSD. Below are factors pre- and post-
trauma exposure which contribute to risk of PTSD pathology. An individual’s subset of 
vulnerability factors may contribute to a unique PTSD trajectory and may help explain the 
heterogeneous presentations of PTSD.

Figure 3. 
Following exposure to stress, the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system are activated to 
mobilize fight-or-flight behavior which results in increased production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines via NF-κb pathways. At the same time, cortisol is produced to terminate the 
threat-response via negative feedback mechanisms at various sites including the pituitary 
gland, hypothalamus, and lymphocytes. Inflammation is thought to be sustained in PTSD 
due to disruptions in these pathways. Specifically, altered GR signaling, hypocortisolemia, 
heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, and insufficient parasympathetic activity 
are thought to contribute to excessive inflammation and skewed immune system balance.

Prospective 
cohort

Among Vietnam veterans with PTSD, the adjusted 
odds ratio for an autoimmune disease was 3.3 (95% 
CI 2.0-5.7).

Women with an ACE score ≥2 were at an elevated risk 
of being hospitalized with an autoimmune disease (HR 
= 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.2). An ACE score ≥2 among 
men and women was associated with an increased 
risk of being hospitalized for a Th2 rheumatic disease, 
including SLE (HR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.2).

Veterans with PTSD had a significantly higher relative 
risk of an autoimmune disease (ARR = 2, 95% CI: 
1.91-2.09). Risk of SLE was not statistically significant 
(HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85-1.51).

Childhood physical and emotional abuse was 
associated with a 2.57 greater risk of SLE (95% CI: 
1.30-5.12). The largest percentage of the association 
(23% p<0.0001) was explained by PTSD.

Among those with PTSD, there was a 58% higher 
risk of an autoimmune disease. (HR = 1.58, 95% CI: 
1.25-2.01). Risk of SLE was not statistically significant 
(HR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.8).

Exposure to severe sexual abuse and severe physical 
abuse was associated with an increased SLE risk (HR 
= 2.51, 95% CI: 1.29-4.85), and (HR = 2.37 95% CI: 
1.13-4.99).
