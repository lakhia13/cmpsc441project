Background: An emerging body of empirical research on trauma-focused interventions
for older adults experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD has
yielded encouraging results. Nevertheless, up to date, the evidence remains scattered
and is developed within rather speciﬁc groups, while studies have focused mostly on
individual psychopathology, overlooking the relevance of resilience and recovering in
one’s social environment.

This study aims at summarizing the emerging evidence on treating
Objective:
trauma-related disorders in older adults, followed by implications for clinical practice
and future research. Speciﬁcally, the following research questions are addressed: Which
factors may optimize access to intervention, what treatment beneﬁts can be realized, and
how to improve resilience by using individual as well as community-oriented approaches?

Methods: A systematic literature research of intervention studies on PTSD among
older adults, published between 1980 and December 2021, was expanded by
cross-referencing, summarized in a narrative synthesis and supplemented with a clinical
vignette reﬂecting qualitative outcomes.

Results: Five RCTs compared varying types of trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy with non-trauma-focused control conditions. From one of them, qualitative
results were reported as well. The most recent studies reported encouraging results,
conﬁrming the suggestion that evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD can be safely
and effectively used with older adults.

Conclusions: Since evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD can be safely and
effectively used with older adults, new avenues for practice and research may be found
in a resilience perspective and a public mental health framework.

INTRODUCTION

Whereas all over the world, the number of older adults is increasing (1), in research and practice
regarding psychotherapy for mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder or
PTSD (2), older and middle-aged adults are underrepresented in comparison with younger adults
(3). Although the percentage of older adults with PTSD appears to be lower than in younger adult

such as exposure to
Disrupting experiences, however,
domestic violence, physical attacks,

sexual violence,
accidents, warfare or natural disasters may occur throughout
human life and leave persisting psychological disturbances up
until later life, such as PTSD. According to the current diagnostic
criteria (2),
there are four categories of PTSD symptoms:
intrusive re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in
mood and cognitions, and alterations in arousal. Symptoms have
to persist for more than 1 month after the precipitating (or index)
event. Nevertheless, empirical ﬁndings (9–11), have stressed that
most trauma survivors will not develop serious mental disorders.
If they do, comorbid major depression, somatic complaints and
problems in psychosocial adjustment (6, 12, 13) may accompany
PTSD symptoms and predict higher PTSD symptom severity,
disability days and health service utilization (8).

From a lifespan perspective, several trajectories of PTSD can
be distinguished: resilience (mild and short-term symptoms),
recovery (moderate symptoms gradually receding), chronicity
(severe persisting symptoms) and delayed onset, meaning severe
symptoms emerging in late life for the ﬁrst time after an index
event much earlier (9, 11). Often, symptom severity is ﬂuctuating
in response to concurrent stressors. Furthermore, ﬁrst-time
emergence of symptoms may occur in all stages of life following
a recent traumatic event. In older adults, both full-spectrum
PTSD and partial or subthreshold PTSD have been found to be
threatening health and daily functioning (6).

illness or accident of a loved one, personal

In general population surveys, 12 months’ prevalence rates
of PTSD in Europe were found to vary from 0.4–6.7% (14).
Prevalence rates may vary among countries with speciﬁc histories
of large scale trauma, such as Germany (15) or Australia (4).
Epidemiological research indicated that 90% of community-
dwelling adults (55–69 years of age) were exposed to one or
more types of traumatic events (16). Characteristic events in
older adulthood may involve the unexpected death of a loved
one,
illness or
accident (16) and elder abuse (17). Notably, symptom severity
was found to be highest for non-disclosed events (16). Among
community-dwelling adults (≥55 years), six-month prevalence of
full-spectrum PTSD was found to amount to almost 1%, whereas
subthreshold PTSD amounts to 13% (6). Overall symptom
severity may vary substantially; avoidance symptoms were found
to distinguish between three classes of severity (18). In older
adults, the long-term consequences of index events earlier in
life seem to consist of decrease in intrusions and an increase in
avoidance symptoms (19).

the
Regarding psychotherapy for patients with PTSD,
latest practice guidelines for the treatment of PTSD (20–22)
recommend trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-
CBT), such as Prolonged Exposure or PE (23), Cognitive
Processing Therapy or CPT (24), Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing or EMDR (25), and Narrative Exposure
Therapy or NET (26), and suggest the use of Brief Eclectic
Psychotherapy for PTSD or BEPP (27, 28). In these approaches,
some form of trauma-focused exposure is considered to be the
core mechanism of change. Hitherto, practice guidelines have

not speciﬁed whether these recommendations can be applied
with older adult patients with PTSD. Generalizability is not self-
evident, since developmental challenges relevant to older age,
such as physical and cognitive changes, might impact treatment
delivery and outcome (29).

The question is whether the disorder-speciﬁc interventions
provided to older adults require age-speciﬁc adjustments to
show full eﬀect (19). After all, older adults may have to cope
with physical
limitations, attentional or memory problems,
shorter future perspectives, and loss of job (and status) due to
retirement. Multimodal presentation of information material,
such as oﬀering psycho-education both in bold print and in
conversation (30), ﬂexibility in treatment pacing and scheduling
appointments (31) and a life-review approach (19, 32) were
proposed as useful adaptations for older adults. Likewise, a
life review intervention was found to be eﬀective in reducing
depression symptoms in older adults (33). Taken together, the
suggestions described might be subsumed under two broad
headings: personalization of interventions (e.g., the former two
adjustments) and using a developmental (life-span) perspective
(the latter), which recognizes full life experience and provides
coherence and acceptance.

Since some PTSD symptoms may persist after completing
treatment and coexist with regaining strength and initiative (34),
personal recovery (in terms of resilience and social environment)
should be the overarching goal of both treatment and follow-up
(35). In line with the centrality of this aim, this study focuses
on how to improve recovery all along the process from access to
treatment to follow-up.

This study aims at addressing those issues by updating
currently available evidence on treating PTSD in older adults,
focusing on recovery and addressing the following research
questions: Which factors may optimize access to intervention,
what treatment beneﬁts can be realized, and how may resilience
be improved by using individual as well as community-oriented
approaches? To highlight the value of older PTSD patients’
personal understanding of their situation and its consequences,
a clinical vignette may serve as an appropriate starting point.

Clinical Vignette, Part 1
A man, aged 63 years, married, with three children, was referred
to a specialized outpatient clinic by his general practitioner with
a request for additional diagnostics and a treatment advice.
The GP described the patient’s problems as: “nightmares and
memory problems in combination with diabetes, type 2”. The
patient had worked as a bus-driver, and from time to time,
he had had to deal with violent passengers. He had handled
these situations fairly well. The nightmares had started after
the patient had collapsed during a hypoglycaemic attack. Due
to impaired functioning, the patient was declared unﬁt for
work. Concurrent with the nightmares, attention problems were
observed. The GP assumed that adverse childhood experiences
played a role. Before establishing a diagnosis and considering a
treatment approach, age-related memory impairment had to be
ruled out.

In the patient’s own words: “I was referred to this institution
after a long period of stress. Actually, there was too much stress

in my life. For a long time, I managed to handle it, by working
hard, too hard. But when diabetes came up, I collapsed, and my
old nightmares returned. In those bad dreams, I was bullied by
my peers and beaten at home, as if everything happened again.
I got very irritable and I had memory problems. I felt so bad. . . ,
but I thought this was due to age. After all, getting older means
to get problems. But when the family doctor asked me what these
bad dreams were about, he said there could be a link with what
had happened to me in the past. It’s kind of embarrassing to talk
about personal problems with somebody other than family. In our
generation, we’re supposed to solve our own problems. But this
just can’t go on any more... You know, my wife can’t handle my
nightmares and my spells of anger any longer. Frankly, I never told
anybody the worst details of what had happened. After all, I also
feel guilty, that I couldn’t stop it when it happened. Now you oﬀer
me treatment for my problems. I wonder how you can change what
happened in the past. What diﬀerence will it make to talk?”

METHODS

The literature was searched by the ﬁrst author and a senior
librarian. OvidSP software was used. The internet bases searched
were PsychInfo and Ovid Medline. Trials published between 1980
and July 27th, 2021, were included and conﬁrmed in December
2021; no language restrictions were applied. Search terms in
titles and abstracts were: (“Posttraumatic stress disorder”) OR
(“PTSD”), AND (“older adults”), AND (“treatment”). The
studies had to report at least one quantitative measure of
PTSD assessed both pre- and post-treatment. Searching the
abstracts, the broad search term of (“treatment’) was narrowed to
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting PTSD outcomes
from individually administered trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT)
interventions compared with non-TF comparators. Finally, the
results were expanded by cross-referencing and supplemented
with a clinical vignette reﬂecting impressions from a qualitative

RESULTS

Study Selection
From the ﬁrst set of records, 199 were deduplicated on PubMed
Reference Number (PMID) and Digital Object Identiﬁer (DOI),
following well-accepted methodology (36). From the remaining
608 studies, four were redundant; 214 did not include older adults
participants; 138 did not report quantitative measures of PTSD
and 26 did not involve psychotherapy. A total of 226 studies
was considered suitable to search the abstracts. Finally, ﬁve RCTs
fulﬁlled the selection criteria. The quantitative results from the
ﬁfth trial were presented in two publications (37, 38).

Study Characteristics
The selected studies were published during the past 15 years and
involved 238 individuals in four countries; 117 (49.2%) engaged
in an individual TF-CBT intervention. Participants varied from
former political prisoners (39), military veterans (40, 41), World
War II-survivors with Adverse Childhood Experiences or ACEs

(42) and civilians with mixed backgrounds (37, 38). Sample
sizes ranged from 11 (40) to 94 (42); the minimal age ranged
from 53–63. All
interventions involved some form of TF-
CBT, varying from Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (40), to
Narrative Exposure (37–39), Integrative Testimonial therapy - an
Internet-based form of Life Review (43) -, (42) and Prolonged
Exposure (44). The comparators consisted of psycho-education
(39), waiting list (42), relaxation therapy (44) and Present-
Centered Therapy or PCT (37, 38, 40). Outcomes included both
clinician-administered interviews and self-report measures. Most
studies reported outcomes for PTSD and depression symptoms.
The dropout rates varied from 0% (39) to 19.5% (44).

Although Present-Centered therapy or PCT (40, 45) was
this
developed as a non-trauma-focused control condition,
approach has been found to be an additional safe and eﬀective
treatment approach for PTSD (37, 45). In PCT, trauma-related
psycho-education concentrates on developing skills for solving
problems associated with interpersonal stressors. More than
providing support or strengthening avoidance, this intervention
focuses on acceptance and commitment and oﬀers active
cooperation of patient and therapist. In the direct comparison,
NET and PCT showed equal outcomes at follow-up, although
by diﬀerent routes in treatment response (37). The studies’ key
characteristics are presented in Table 1.

DISCUSSION

After returning to the clinical vignette (part 2), the main ﬁndings
will be summarized, followed by relevant issues for mental health
professionals regarding access to treatment, treatment beneﬁts,
recovery, resilience and social environment, a public health
perspective and ﬁnally strengths and limitations and implications
and conclusions.

Clinical Vignette, Part 2
“Looking back at my therapy, I can say it really helped to talk about
what had happened to me. I could tell the therapist everything.
Not all my problems were solved, but an important part of my
nightmares has disappeared. I should have done this much sooner.
Therapy was not easy, far from. The nights after a session, I slept
worse. But afterwards, it was as if I had put a step forward.
The relationship with my wife also improved. When I sleep
better, so does she, so together we manage better during the day.
Furthermore, during therapy we discovered important moments of
support. . . , that she really was there for me. I am grateful for that.
I also discovered that I don’t have to be ashamed about what had
happened to me. Under the circumstances, there and then, nobody
could reasonably have expected me to change things as they were.
I also realize now that there is strength and endurance in me. The
document drawn up at the end of therapy will help me to open up
to our children, so they can understand me better. Maybe we can
have a better time together in the years ahead.”

Access to Treatment
Psychological treatment for older adults has been characterized
by three barriers: low recognition of PTSD in primary care
(8, 49), reluctance of older adults to use the services of
mental health professionals to deal with their problems (50)
and, until recently, a limited body of evidence concerning

for older adults. These barriers
trauma-focused treatment
are associated with persisting and biased assumptions about
older adults having insuﬃcient ﬂexibility to beneﬁt
from
psychotherapy; an opinion derived from Sigmund Freud
(51). Disconﬁrming these stereotypes, however, older and
younger adults were found to beneﬁt in equal measure from
mental health care (52). Similarly, older and younger adults
beneﬁtted equally from high intensive EMDR treatment (53).
Emerging evidence on trauma-focused exposure therapy in
later life (37–40, 42, 44) has yielded encouraging ﬁndings
on various clinically relevant variables. Regarding resilience
measures, data from one of
showed
that posttraumatic growth was signiﬁcantly associated with
treatment outcome (54). Additionally, numerous case reports
(31, 46, 55–58), and uncontrolled trials (53, 54, 59–61) have
suggested likewise.

Treating PTSD in Later Life

Access to appropriate treatment may further be improved by
using age-appropriate (partly transdiagnostic) psycho-diagnostic
instruments for older adults (63) and routine inclusion of
hetero-anamnestic information in the intake procedure. Given
the possibility of ACEs in PTSD patients’ past, standard
assessment should include the ACE questionnaire (World
Health Organization, WHO). Since both age-related changes
and PTSD symptoms can involve attentional and memory
problems, cognitive functioning should be routinely assessed
as well (64). Extending routine assessments with cognitive
and physiological measures (blood pressure or heart rate)
could provide additional evidence on risks and outcomes
of psychotherapy in older adults (29, 46). Finally, e-health
applications for assessment and/or intensive treatment formats
(53) could bring interesting innovations and allow access to
additional groups of patients.

Treatment Beneﬁts
The vignette illustrates the possibility of regaining stability
and initiative notwithstanding residual symptoms. Traumatic
experiences are followed by a process of coping or adaptation
(9, 65). After such experiences, one has to adapt to a world
that has changed forever and is left to rebuild one’s view
on oneself, one’s environment and one’s future. People will
look for explanations of what happened to them, trying to
comprehend the implications in the light of their own personal
existence. Finding a meaning for the experience gives an
individual a sense of coherence (66, 67). This process of
making sense is connected with emotions. One goes through
the pain of
the experience and may be
confronted with many, often conﬂicting feelings and thoughts,
while not avoiding or suppressing them. Eventually, people can
actually thrive in the aftermath of the traumatic event (68).
Coherence may bring about a sense of control. Posttraumatic
coping will
improve when one has the feeling of control
over certain situations, however small this control may be
(69). By learning to leave the past in the past, one can get
more grip on the present. “I am stronger than my ghosts!”
(70).

symptoms and memories. Grief about missed opportunities
or deteriorated relationships might require attention. Renewed
self-esteem may enable patients to aim at overcoming long-
standing estrangement with relatives.
In these years, new

may develop, potentially correcting or mitigating previous

patterns (71).

and eﬀective,

treatment plans to patients’ needs and priorities is possible
and may protect against feelings of helplessness which often
accompany PTSD, and improve the process of adjustment.
Habituation to adverse stimuli, diﬀerentiating the past from
the present, cognitive reprocessing, meaning making and
improved coherence are considered the protecting factors in
all treatments. The same accounts for social recognition of

Resilience and Social Environment
Posttraumatic mental health problems have been acknowledged
as serious conditions. Trauma research and treatment, however,
have been dominated by focusing on psychopathology and
symptoms, preferably measured with clinician-
individual
administered assessments. With older
cohorts, however,
additional attention is necessary for systemic issues, idioms of
distress, the social environment and resilience factors. After all,
recovery from PTSD may allow for resuming one’s development
and ﬁnd renewed strength and posttraumatic growth, even
following multiple instances of abuse in late life (17). Personally
reﬂecting on one’s recovery may enhance self-eﬃcacy (73)
and coherence (66). Understanding the patient’s personal
experiences during psychotherapy may be addressed by using
outcome monitoring, e.g. by adding personal interviews to the
measurements, preferably in structured, systematic ways (70).

illness and distress in terms of

A Public Health Perspective
Adopting a public health perspective allows for joining age-
speciﬁc and disorder-speciﬁc aspects. This outlook may include
paying attention to the context of mental disturbances and
understanding health,
the
individual’s (social, political and cultural) environment. Doing
so, mental health professionals should be watchful not
to
overlook older patients’ potential economic diﬃculties (on an
individual or family level). Informing social care professionals
might be useful to allow patients access to - and completion of
- treatment. This contextual approach may enhance secondary
(65),
prevention and extend the impact of
protecting against symptom relapse and social
isolation. In
addition, this perspective especially requires focusing on the
wider setting in which health after trauma may be threatened
and on necessary protecting interventions. Shifting the focus
from symptoms to resilience variables (such as self-eﬃcacy and
coherence) and from the individual patients to their family as
well as community can serve this goal. This focus may imply a
completed trauma-focused treatment to be followed by a (short)

The same accounts for grief work in case of traumatic losses.
Regarding prevention, professional risks on developing PTSD

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS

The present study summarizes recent developments in the
highly relevant ﬁeld of
treating PTSD in older adults. Its
strengths include a systematic literature selection and enrichment
of the presentation with patient-reported outcomes derived
from one of the described studies. Some limitations should
be mentioned. Diﬀerent age limits were used for inclusion,
limiting the comparability of the studies. The resulting samples
did not allow inclusion of suﬃcient older-old participants to
reﬂect current demographic developments (75). Furthermore,
it should be noted that the research examining mainstream
interventions for PTSD in older adults is limited. The present
results need to be interpreted together with ﬁndings from future
studies, that will have preferably larger sample sizes and extended
age ranges. The implementation of the suggested avenues and
perspectives may inspire new ways of interdisciplinary and
transmural collaboration, guiding future research.

IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Returning to the research questions, access to treatment (a),
treatment beneﬁts (b) and optimizing recovery (c), were
addressed successively. Timely detection of PTSD-symptoms
in primary care allows for appropriate referrals or treatment
advice. Available evidence regarding trauma-focused exposure
treatment for older adults with posttraumatic stress symptoms
(37–40, 42, 44) has yielded encouraging results. Trauma-focused
and present-centered interventions have been found to be safe,
acceptable and eﬀective for this population, although extended
research (including older participants, or PTSD patients from
other backgrounds) would be highly desirable. Disconﬁrming
long-standing stereotypes regarding older adults’ capacity to
change, treatment response from psychotherapy has been found
to be invariant with age. Understanding the patient’s personal
experiences during psychotherapy is addressed by including
outcome monitoring into therapeutic procedures. Widening the
scope of treating older adults with trauma-related disorders may
inspire new initiatives and research avenues.

Summarizing, these implications allow for the following
conclusions. First: whereas PTSD has been described as a hidden
variable in the lives of older adults, evidence-based interventions
and a community perspective may appeal to hidden strengths and
resources. Second: psychotherapy for trauma-related disorders in
later life may be meaningful for years ahead. Third: pessimism
concerning the treatment of older adults with PTSD is unfounded
and using an individual pathology-oriented perspective too
narrow. By overcoming these mindsets, treating trauma-related
disorders in later life is coming of age.
