To assess the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for patients with
chronic pain.

Materials and methods

The research conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Library, Web of Science,
PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Litera-
ture (CINAHL) databases following the PRISMA guidelines. The retrieval time limit was from
the establishment of the database to October 2023. A meta-analysis was carried out for the
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria by using
RevMan 5.3.

Results

Twenty-one RCTs were included. At post-treatment, a significant medium effect size (ES)
was found in measuring pain interference, functional impairment, pain acceptance, psycho-
logical inflexibility, and depression; Pain intensity, anxiety, and quality of life (QOL) had a
small ES. At three months post-treatment, a large ES was found in measuring functional
impairment, and a medium ES was found in the other indicators.

Conclusion

The researchers provided evidence for the effectiveness of ACT as an intervention for
patients with chronic pain, which can be applied by clinicians or nurses in practice. Future
research should explore the applicability of ACT to different pain conditions and modalities.

Implications for nursing

Post-treatment data highlight the efficacy of ACT in moderating pain-related outcomes. Clin-
ical nurses are encouraged to incorporate ACT into routine patient education and interven-
tions, including promoting pain acceptance, promoting mindfulness practices, and using
cognitive stress reduction techniques. Standardized follow-up after an ACT intervention for
patients with chronic pain is critical, including regular assessment, feedback, and realign-
ment of treatment strategies. Overall, ACT became an important tool for nurses to improve
the lives of patients with chronic pain.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating health issue worldwide. It refers to pain that per-
sists beyond three months and is associated with significant emotional distress or functional
impairment, such as anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, and reduced physical activity
[1]. A national health interview survey in the United States revealed that about 50.2 million
adults (20.5%) experienced pain on most or every day [2]. The prevalence of chronic pain was
slightly higher in the European Union, at about 27% [3]. Chronic pain not only affects a large
proportion of the population, but it also imposes many restrictions on the individual [2].
Chronic pain impairs work performance and increases absenteeism [4–6]. Chronic pain also
hinders daily functioning and social participation, as one study found that 40% of individuals
with chronic pain had difficulty walking, and 34% had difficulty socializing [7, 8]. Moreover,
chronic pain is linked to depression, anxiety, and lower quality of life (QOL) [9–11]. In gen-
eral, chronic pain is one of the most common health challenges globally, with significant direct
or indirect adverse consequences for patients, their families, and society [5, 12, 13].

Psychological interventions are essential for chronic pain management [11, 14]. Research

indicates that attempts to control pain often result in increased pain severity [15, 16]. For
instance, efforts to manage pain may trigger additional psychological stress, leading to elevated
levels of stress hormones, thereby amplifying the perception of pain [17]. Moreover, excessive
focus on pain can lead to an attentional focusing effect, consequently heightening individuals’
sensitivity to painful stimuli [18]. Conversely, when patients attempt to accept pain, their pain
intensity decreases, and their mental health improves, which is one of the aims of Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy (ACT) [19, 20]. ACT is a contextually focused form of cognitive
behavioral psychotherapy that uses mindfulness and behavioral activation to increase patients’
psychological flexibility [20, 21]. It helps patients engage in values-based, positive behaviors
while experiencing difficult thoughts, emotions, or sensations [21, 22]. ACT has six core pro-
cesses: acceptance, being present, cognitive defusion, self as context, values, and committed
action [20]. Unlike traditional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), ACT encourages individuals
to accept and confront their pain [20]. Based on this, individuals are motivated to discover
their self-worth and pursue positive actions aligned with their values in order to achieve their
life goals and values [16, 23, 24]. Therefore, theoretically, ACT can be an effective alternative
treatment for patients with chronic pain to enhance their functioning and reduce the impact
of chronic pain [15].

Our literature review shows that multiple systematic reviews have confirmed that clinical
personnel using ACT can effectively improve certain indicators of patients with chronic pain,
such as anxiety, depression, and pain acceptance [23, 25, 26]. For instance, a systematic review

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301226 June 14, 2024

2 / 25

PLOS ONEEffect of ACT on patients with chronic pain

conducted by Hughes and colleagues, encompassing 11 trials, demonstrated that ACT yielded
significant moderate to large effects in terms of pain acceptance and psychological flexibility,
along with small to moderate effects in functionality, anxiety, and depression, but no signifi-
cant improvements were observed in QOL [25]. In another systematic review by Du and asso-
ciates, which focused on the efficacy of ACT in improving functioning in individuals with
chronic pain, 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included [27]. This review found
that ACT had an immediate positive impact on the functioning of patients with chronic pain,
yet the long-term effects remain unclear [27]. Inês and colleagues focused on technology-
based ACT interventions for patients with chronic pain, incorporating 5 RCTs with a total of
746 participants [26]. They observed that, compared to control groups, technology-based ACT
demonstrated moderate effects in pain intervention and pain acceptance, and smaller effects
in depression, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility [26].

However, it has been six years since the systematic review by Hughes and colleagues, which

focused on the comprehensive psychological outcomes of chronic pain patients treated with
various forms of ACT by clinical practitioners in RCTs [25]. Since then, numerous new high-
quality RCTs on this topic have emerged. These RCTs have made many improvements in
research design, refinement of pain types in subjects, and standardization of ACT interven-
tions. For example, Hansen’s 2023 study demonstrated advancements in design, participant
engagement, and intervention customization, especially by having endometriosis patient com-
plete homework for 10 weeks, using anonymous IDs to ensure blinding, and employing a
12-week pain diary to improve data quality [28]. Moreover, by combining Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction and ACT in the tailored intervention, the research not only enhanced the
intervention’s relevance and effectiveness but also offered valuable methodological insights for
future ACT research in chronic pain management [28]. Lina’s 2022 research used an auto-
mated web program for individual-level crossover block randomization to ensure fair alloca-
tion across study arms [29]. A blinded third party unconnected to the research conducted the
randomization and allocation, while data collectors were kept unaware of participant groups
[29]. Despite the inability to blind participants, the study effectively minimized bias and opti-
mized follow-up through regular online assessments and detailed flowcharts. In general,
including these new high-quality studies will also improve the accuracy of our systematic
review. In addition, according to Cochrane’s recommendations, if a systematic review on this
topic exceeds a certain number of years based on its academic value and practical value, it is
also necessary to update it [30, 31].

Secondly, many new and effective pain management concepts have emerged in the field of
pain management during these six years, such as emphasizing the importance of pain interfer-
ence indicators [32]. However, these indicators were missing from Hughes and his colleagues’
systematic review [25]. Therefore, in this systematic review we have also included pain inter-
ference and other indicators as our outcome indicators so that the intervention effects of ACT
can match with the latest pain concepts.

Finally, we have also conducted a subgroup analysis in this systematic review. The grouping

criterion is the time when the outcome indicators were measured after the participants
received ACT intervention. We have divided our analysis into two subgroups: post-treatment
and three months post-treatment hoping to improve our research quality through this sub-
group analysis research design and reduce bias in research results.

Research problem and aim

The primary objective and problem addressed by this study is to conduct an extensive system-
atic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ACT in patients with chronic pain,

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301226 June 14, 2024

PLOS ONEEffect of ACT on patients with chronic pain

particularly in light of recent research advancements and evolving concepts in pain manage-
ment. This will encompass:

1. Analyzing all new RCTs on ACT interventions in chronic pain, published in English aca-
demic journals, especially those within the last six years, and incorporating them into our
systematic review.

2. Investigating novel pain intervention indicators, such as pain interference, in the context of
ACT interventions in chronic pain patients, to provide evidence-based recommendations
for pain management guidelines.

3. Conducting subgroup analyses with a special focus on the effects at different time points
post-ACT intervention (immediately after treatment and three months post-treatment).
This will aid in understanding the short-term and long-term effects of ACT on chronic
pain patients, the sustainability of these effects, and in formulating effective intervention
strategies.

Materials and methods

This systematic review was guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and
meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA) recommendations [33].

Search strategy

From inception to October 1, 2023, the systematic review systematically searched six databases:
the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. In addi-
tion, peer-reviewed manuscripts published in English were included within the systematic
review. The search term was a combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) terms along
with free terms and was adjusted according to the specific database, mainly including “accep-
tance and commitment therapy” AND “chronic pain” AND “randomized controlled trial.”
S1 Appendix presents the search strategies utilized for each database.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following PICOS elements:

(1) P (Population):

Participants were �16 years of age and suffered from chronic pain lasting more than three
months and beyond [34]. The type of pain was not limited, but the pain associated with malig-
nancy was excluded [35].

(2) I (Intervention):

The intervention of qualified studies should be ACT that explicitly includes both acceptance

and commitment components [25]; studies of the intervention focusing on only one of these
components would be excluded. Therefore, studies based on mindfulness were not included.

(3) C (Control):

The intervention in the control group was treatment as usual (TAU) or waiting list (WL).
When the interventions in the control group were other interventions such as relaxation ther-
apy, CBT, or exercise, they were excluded.

(4) O (Outcome):

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301226 June 14, 2024

PLOS ONEEffect of ACT on patients with chronic pain

The primary purpose of ACT is to help individuals live more productive and meaningful
lives and improve their functional status, not to control symptoms [23]. Therefore, the system-
atic review used pain interference and functional impairment as the primary outcomes in this
study. Pain intensity, pain acceptance, psychological inflexibility, anxiety, depression, and
QOL were used as secondary outcome measures.

(5) S (Study Design): RCTs.

Screening procedure

The researchers used EndNote X9 software to manage the database search results. The first
step was to remove duplicate studies using the software. In this study, two independent review-
ers (YH and QC) completed the screening, review, and data extraction for studies included in
the research. As a preliminary trial, both reviewers independently reviewed 50 papers. During
this process, YH included 46 articles, while QC included 45. They reached a consensus on
including 45 papers and unanimously excluded 4. This high level of agreement is reflected in a
Kappa value of approximately 0.88, indicating a strong consistency in the application of
screening criteria between the two assessors. This result confirms the reliability and effective-
ness of our screening process. Then, the two independent reviewers (YH and QC) continued
to assess the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the remaining studies using predefined inclusion
and exclusion criteria, eliminating those that did not meet the standards. Subsequently, these
reviewers carefully read the full texts of the studies that passed the initial screening, further
excluding any that failed to meet the established criteria. This process resulted in the final
selection of studies. Throughout this review process, each reviewer worked independently, and
any disagreements were discussed collectively. If a consensus could not be reached, a third
reviewer (LY) was consulted to resolve the disputed decisions.

Data extraction

The researchers used a prepiloted, standardized form to extract information for each experi-
ment. Information extracted included study characteristics (author, country, year of publica-
tion), participant information (age, gender, pain type, pain duration), intervention details
(mode of intervention, intervention duration, treatment of the control group), and outcome
measures. During this process, if missing data are identified, necessary conversions of the data
was conducted or the authors were directly contacted to acquire the data, in order to ensure the
quality of the systematic review results. Throughout this stage, the extraction of information was
conducted independently by two reviewers (YH and QC). If there was a disagreement in the
extracted information, the disagreement was resolved by discussion or a third reviewer (LY).

Risk of bias: Quality assessment

The researchers used the Cochrane risk of bias tool [36] and part one of the Yates quality rating
scale [37] to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Two reviewers (YH and
QC) independently evaluated the included studies. Discussions or a third reviewer (LY)
resolved any discrepancies in the evaluation.

The Cochrane Assessment of Bias tool [36] was used to assess the methodological quality
and to capture the risk of bias in RCTs [36]. Each item was assessed as having low, unclear, or
high risk of bias. Items were not summed to obtain a total score, as recommended by the Cen-
tre for Reviews and Dissemination CRD [38]. The Cochrane risk of bias tool [36] evaluated the
included studies in the following seven areas: random sequence generation (selection bias),

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301226 June 14, 2024

PLOS ONEEffect of ACT on patients with chronic pain

allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance
bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition
bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), other bias.

Part one of the Yates quality rating scale [37] is a tool used to assess specific sources of bias

for psychological RCTs that the Cochrane risk of bias tool [36] failed to capture. Items were
scored (1 or 2 points) according to whether the construct was reported. The tool evaluated the
included studies in the following six areas: rationale, treatment duration, treatment manualiza-
tion, adherence to the manual, therapist training, and client engagement.

Statistical analysis and meta-analysis

The researchers used RevMan 5.3 software to conduct a meta-analysis, generate forest plots, and
calculate statistics for all data. RevMan is software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration for
systematic reviewers. It is mainly used to create and save the protocol or full text of Cochrane
systematic reviews, perform meta-analysis on the input data, and display the meta-analysis
results in more intuitive formats, such as forest plots, and to update systematic reviews [39].

The systematic review used chi-square tests to determine if heterogeneity existed between
studies. If P > 0.1, and I2 < 50%, the study was not statistically heterogeneous; if P < 0.1, and
I2 > 50%, the study was statistically heterogeneous. When heterogeneity was significant, sensi-
tivity analysis or subgroup analysis was used to determine the source of heterogeneity. To
address the heterogeneity detected, we not only explored its potential sources, such as through
subgroup analyses, but also implemented sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our
results. The sensitivity analyses involved switching between random-effects and fixed-effects
models to assess the impact of different effect models on the estimation of Effect Sizes (ES).
Furthermore, we investigated the stability of the results by sequentially excluding each study, a
process that helped us ascertain that no single study exerted undue influence on the overall
outcomes. In conducting subgroup analyses, we focused on evaluating the effects of ACT
interventions on patients with chronic pain at two critical time points: the end of treatment
and three months post-treatment. The selection of these time points was grounded in the
emphasis on short-term versus long-term effects noted in prior research, as well as the impor-
tance of understanding the persistence of intervention effects. We anticipated that the various
outcome measures in patients with chronic pain might exhibit different effects immediately
post-treatment and at three months post-treatment. Such variations could reveal insights into
the durability and evolving trends of ACT interventions, thereby providing a basis for clini-
cians to develop intervention strategies.

For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence interval
(CI) were used if each study used the same measurement tool to measure the same outcome
indicator. Conversely, standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CI were used. For the
purpose of this study, the random effects model was selected within the systematic review to
calculate ES [40]. According to the viewpoint of Cohen, ES < 0.2 is considered a negligible
effect, 0.2 � ES < 0.5 is small, 0.5 � ES < 0.8 is medium, and ES � 0.8 is large [41]. At the
same time, the systematic review used RevMan 5.3 to draw a funnel plot to measure its publi-
cation bias.

Result
Search results

A searching of the databases obtained 7260 articles (Fig 1). 2568 duplicates were excluded,
4578 irrelevant articles were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts, and 114 articles
were obtained after the initial screening. 93 articles were excluded after reviewing the full text,

Characteristics of selected studies

Table 1 presents the characteristics of the selected studies. Of the 21 studies included, 16 were
from Europe, 3 from North America, and 2 from Oceania. The overall sample size was 1298,
with a mean age ranging from 29.5 to 82.26, and the majority were female. In addition, three
studies reported subjects with a specific type of chronic pain, Fibromyalgia [49, 51, 58]. Thir-
teen studies reported an average chronic pain duration for the sample, ranging from 6.8 to
25.34 years. The forms of ACT intervention included in the study were face-to-face individual
intervention, face-to-face group intervention, online intervention, and self-help intervention.
Control group interventions were either TAU or WL.

Quality assessment

The Cochrane risk of bias tool. The RCTs included in this meta-analysis all had high

methodological quality (Fig 2).

Specifically, all but one of the studies demonstrated random sequence generation [48]. On

allocation concealment, one study was assessed as "high risk of bias" [55], eight studies were
assessed as "unclear risk of bias" [42, 43, 45, 46, 48, 50, 53, 54]. For performance bias, all studies
were considered "low risk of bias." This is because in ACT intervention studies, it is not possi-
ble to blind participants or treatment providers. Moreover, no evidence of serious bias was
found. For detection bias, six studies did not explicitly indicate whether they blinded the inter-
viewers and were therefore assessed as "some concerns" [47, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60]. In terms of
attrition bias, twenty studies were rated as "low risk of bias" [28, 29, 46, 47, 49–51, 53, 55–57,
60]. In these studies, even if there was a loss of some participants, the rate of loss to follow-up
and the reasons were similar and comparable between the experimental group and the control;
one study was rated as "high risk of bias" [59]; the rest were rated as "unclear risk of bias." For
reporting bias, the researchers rated all studies as "low risk of bias" because we can retrieve
their registration information or protocols or compare the consistency of methods and results
in research. At the same time, the systematic review found no clues about selective reporting.
For other biases, all studies were considered "unclear risk of bias" because the authors of these
studies were usually professionals in the ACT field.

Fig 2A and 2B show the results of their measurements. Abbreviations of the author names

were used in the summary for 21 RCTs.

Yates quality assessment tool. Table 1 shows the total score of each study in this

assessment.

All RCTs gave the ACT rationale and an adequate description of their intervention content,

intervention environment, and duration of treatment. Only nine studies reported adherence
to the manual [28, 29, 42, 43, 49–51, 55, 60]. Only two studies reported ACT training specifi-
cally for the trial [46, 56]. Thirteen studies documented whether client engagement checks
were conducted during the trial [28, 29, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 56–60].

Effect of ACT versus control conditions

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ACT compared with control con-
ditions (e.g., WL; TAU). The systematic review performed a subgroup analysis on the follow-
up data at three months post-treatment, except for QOL.

Effect of post-treatment.

In assessing the impact of ACT post-treatment, our meta-analy-

sis integrated data across eight outcomes, with the results presented in Table 2, Figs 3, and 4.
Specifically, we observed the following: Pain Interference: Among 625 participants, there was a
significant improvement with an SMD of -0.50 (CI: -0.66 to -0.34, P < 0.001); Functional
Impairment: In 638 participants, we noted significant improvements with an SMD of -0.74

Publication bias

The systematic review plotted funnel plots for the studies that reported pain interference
(post-treatment) as an outcome measure to assess publication bias. The results showed that
most of the studies were located in the middle and upper part of the funnel plot, and the stud-
ies on both sides of the vertical line were roughly symmetrical (Fig 5). Therefore, the system-
atic review concluded that the risk of publication bias in the current study was low.

Sensitivity analysis

The systematic review switched between different modes of effect (random effects model and
fixed effects model) and found no significant change in the ES. In addition, after each study
was excluded in order, the results of the meta-analysis were not significantly changed com-
pared with those before the exclusion, all p < 0.05, which indicates that the results of the meta-
analysis were stable.

Discussion

While some RCTs and meta-analyses support the efficacy of ACT for patients with chronic
pain, there remains a need to synthesize evidence from RCTs on ACT interventions in chronic
pain for various reasons. Moreover, during this process, we have identified results that diverge
from previous studies.

The systematic review included and extracted data from 21 RCTs to examine the effects of

ACT on patients with chronic pain. The results showed that at post-treatment and three
months post-treatment, ACT had small to large ES on pain interference, functional
impairment, pain acceptance, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, psychological inflexibility,
and QOL in patients with chronic pain.

For pain interference, ACT was superior to the control group at both post-treatment and
three months post-treatment, showing a medium ES. The meta-analysis by Trindade and col-
leagues reported the same findings [61], which corroborated our meta-analysis results. Both our
results and theirs indicated that ACT significantly reduced the pain interference in patients
with chronic pain after the intervention and at follow-up, with a change in medium ES.

In the assessment of functional impairment, our study identified moderate to large ES at
post-treatment and three months post-treatment for participants who received ACT interven-
tion. This contrasts with the findings of other meta-analyses, such as Hughes’s study, which
reported only small ES [25]. The discrepancy in these findings could be attributed to two key
factors. Difference in the Number of Studies Included: Our meta-analysis incorporated 10 and
7 studies at two time points for measuring functional impairment, while Hughes’s systematic
review included three studies at post-treatment and two studies at three months post-treat-
ment [25]. The inclusion of a greater number of studies in our analysis likely broadened the
data spectrum and enhanced statistical power, thereby influencing the estimation of effect
sizes and enabling the detection of more significant effects [62]. Variations in Intervention

Protocols: Our meta-analysis, incorporating a variety of ACT interventions, stands in contrast
to Herbert’s study, which focused solely on technology-supported ACT [26]. This technologi-
cal approach, while innovative, might limit aspects like personal engagement and therapeutic
alliance, potentially reducing efficacy [63]. The absence of direct interaction in technology-
supported ACT could lead to less personalized therapy and varied participant-technology
dynamics, possibly contributing to the smaller effect sizes observed in such studies [63]. In
contrast, our inclusion of diverse ACT protocols, both traditional and technology-supported,
provides a broader perspective on ACT’s effectiveness in treating functional impairment,
reflecting the complexities of intervention delivery and participant engagement [63].

For pain intensity, the systematic review found that ACT had a small and medium ES
improvement for participants at post-treatment and three months post-treatment, respec-
tively. The meta-analysis by Hughes and colleagues reported the same findings [25], and both
our results showed significant heterogeneity. After removing the studies one by one and reduc-
ing the heterogeneity, our results still showed a small ES. However, Hughes and colleagues
only obtained a non-significant result that CI crossed the zero line [25]. The discrepancy
between these findings can be attributed to two primary factors. Difference in the Number of
Studies Included: Our review included 18 and 5 studies at the respective time points, compared
to Hughes’s review, which included only 6 and 4 studies [25]. The larger number of studies in

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301226 June 14, 2024

PLOS ONEEffect of ACT on patients with chronic pain

our analysis likely enhanced the statistical power, enabling the detection of a small yet signifi-
cant effect [62]. Inclusion of Recent High-Quality Research: Our analysis also incorporated
studies from the past six years, characterized by higher quality in intervention protocols. Par-
ticularly, these recent studies demonstrated improved execution in aspects such as random
sequence generation, performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias. The inclusion of
these high-quality studies might have provided a more accurate assessment of ACT’s efficacy,
thus impacting the estimation of effect sizes.

For both pain acceptance and psychological inflexibility, our results at both time points
showed that ACT was better than the control group, showing a medium ES. Regarding pain
acceptance, these two meta-analyses also reported the same findings as ours [25, 61], confirm-
ing that ACT can enhance participants’ pain acceptance. Regarding psychological inflexibility,
this meta-analysis showed only a small ES [61]. This might be attributed to the study including
only RCTs focused on online interventions.

For anxiety, our meta-analysis showed a small and medium ES at two time points, respec-
tively, favoring ACT over the control group. After reducing heterogeneity, the ES was small at
both time points, in line with the results of the two meta-analyses [25, 61]. For depression, the
systematic review found a medium ES at both time points, supporting the ACT over the con-
trol group. This is consistent with the results of the aforementioned meta-analysis [25], which
supports the effectiveness of ACT in improving depression.

For QOL, the systematic review showed a small ES favoring ACT over the control group,
which was different from the findings of the Hughes and colleagues’ systematic review [25].
This difference can be attributed to two key aspects. Inclusion of More and Recent RCTs: Our
review encompassed a larger pool of participants in the RCTs assessing QOL, totaling 294 par-
ticipants, compared to Hughes’s review, which included only 179 participants [25]. The inclu-
sion of a greater number of recent RCTs enhances the representativeness of our findings and
likely brings the results closer to the true values. A larger sample size increases the statistical
power of the analysis, potentially leading to more reliable and generalizable findings [62].
Higher Quality of Newer RCTs: The RCTs included in our review are characterized by higher
quality, particularly in terms of methodology and execution. Recent studies often adhere to
more rigorous standards in research design, such as better randomization processes, effective
blinding, and comprehensive reporting. These improvements in study quality contribute to
more accurate and trustworthy results, potentially explaining the observed differences in effect
sizes for QOL between our study and Hughes’s [25].

According to the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment [36], most studies included in this
meta-analysis demonstrated high-quality evaluations, with a "low risk of bias" rating in ran-
dom sequence generation, performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias. However, a
closer inspection reveals critical issues, particularly in aspects of allocation concealment and
attrition bias. For instance, certain studies lacked explicit and rigorous procedures for alloca-
tion concealment [42, 43, 45, 55], failing to provide detailed randomization processes [48] or
adequate blinding of researchers and participants [56, 57, 59, 60]. This could potentially intro-
duce selection bias. Similarly, the control over data collection and follow-up phases in some
studies was not stringent, leading to incomplete data and raising concerns about the accuracy
and reliability of the results [42–44]. These limitations are not to be overlooked in our meta-
analysis. Inadequate allocation concealment can lead to overestimation or underestimation of
treatment effects [64], while attrition bias could skew results, thereby affecting our overall
judgement of the effectiveness of ACT [65]. In synthesizing our findings, we paid particular
attention to the potential impact of these issues on our overall conclusions. To add depth and
rigor to our conclusions, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the extent to which
these methodological issues could affect our estimates of effect sizes. This approach not only

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301226 June 14, 2024

PLOS ONEEffect of ACT on patients with chronic pain

revealed the range of effect sizes under optimal and worst-case scenarios but also helped us
understand the variability of results under different levels of bias.

According to the first part of the Yates Quality Rating Scale [37], the score range for all
studies included in this research is between 6 to 8 points, indicating that the trials we incorpo-
rated generally possess good quality. This scoring interval suggests that the involved studies
have met higher standards in both design and execution. Specifically, these studies exhibited
commendable performance in critical quality indicators such as the randomization process,
implementation of blinding, selection of control groups, as well as the measurement and
reporting of outcomes, thereby providing a solid foundation for the results of our research.

Strengths and necessity of the study

Over the past decade, several systematic reviews have discussed the effectiveness of clinical
staff using ACT interventions for patients with chronic pain. However, this systematic review
stands out due to its unique strengths in literature updates, outcome updates, and in-depth dis-
cussion of implications and value for practice. Such work is crucial in this field.

Firstly, regarding outcomes, Hughes and team observed that ACT did not lead to significant

improvements in QOL for patients with chronic pain [25]. In contrast, our systematic review
detected a small ES in favor of ACT. Notably, the systematic review also introduced and delved
into a new outcome measure: pain interference. Neither Hughes nor Herbert’s reviews
touched upon this metric [25, 26], even though it’s an invaluable measure in pain manage-
ment. Jensen and associates have argued that beyond pain intensity, a patient’s pain interfer-
ence score is pivotal for assessing pain severity [32]. Overlooking this metric might result in
underwhelming intervention outcomes for chronic pain.

In addition, six years have elapsed since the systematic review by Hughes et al. [25], and
numerous new RCTs on the subject have since emerged. This makes it imperative to incorpo-
rate these recent studies and refresh the analysis of intervention effects. Our systematic review
encompassed 21 RCTs, in contrast to the 11 RCTs in the review by Hughes et al. [25]. We re-
analyzed the data, incorporating 10 additional RCTs, and compared our results with those of
Hughes and his team. Our analysis showed that, post-intervention, ACT practitioners
enhanced the QOL of patients with chronic pain, demonstrating a moderate ES, which
diverges from the findings of Hughes et al [25]. Furthermore, our results indicated a significant
decrease in psychological inflexibility with a large ES, as opposed to Hughes et al.’s moderate
ES. However, in terms of mitigating depression, we noted a small ES, contrasting with Hughes
et al.’s moderate ES. Three months post-treatment, we identified a moderate ES in ACT practi-
tioners reducing functional impairment, differing from Hughes et al.’s large ES. On the other
hand, our data highlighted a large ES in the reduction of pain intensity by ACT practitioners,
while Hughes and his team reported only a moderate ES.

Finally, the systematic review has delved into the implications and relevance of the results

from this systematic review specifically for the nursing community, addressing these in our
"Implications for Nursing" section. The systematic review ventured into its bearing on nursing
education, clinical practice, and pertinent healthcare policies—a dimension not touched upon
in prior systematic reviews [23, 25, 26]. Broadly, our systematic review stands distinct in its lit-
erature curation, updated findings, and emphasis on nursing relevance.

Generally speaking, this systematic review has unique significance and value in terms of lit-

erature screening, results updating, and nursing significance.

Limitations

Our meta-analysis also has some limitations, mainly in the following aspects. First, it is difficult
to eliminate clinical heterogeneity in this meta-analysis, such as different intervention modali-
ties (group versus individual; face-to-face versus online), different intervention durations (two
months versus three months), and different clinical populations (ethnicity, age, gender, the
type of chronic pain). Although in this meta-analysis, the systematic review used the measure-
ment time of outcome indicators as a subgroup analysis, this can only reduce part of the het-
erogeneity. In addition, not all of the studies the systematic review included reported all of the
outcome measures we needed. This will limit the number of studies included in our quantita-
tive analysis, reducing the accuracy of the results. The language in which we included studies
was limited to English, and a search for studies in other languages was lacking. This may have
caused us to lose some potential studies that might have been included. Concurrently, our
quality assessment, utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Yates Quality Rating
Scale, revealed inherent limitations and biases inherent to these tools. Subjectivity in assess-
ments and incomplete research reports can distort bias risk evaluations. Although we have
endeavored to improve accuracy through assessor training, consistency checks, and sensitivity
analyses for publication bias, completely removing tool-induced biases is challenging. Finally,
a potential limitation of this study is the absence of preregistration prior to its initiation. The
lack of preregistration may lead to reservations among readers regarding the trustworthiness
of the research methodology and the interpretation of results, as the absence of a publicly
transparent declaration of the research design and analysis plan could be perceived as a source
of potential bias. We acknowledge this concern and have endeavored to ensure the transpar-
ency and rigor of our research process in other ways. This includes providing detailed descrip-
tions of our literature search strategy, the criteria for study inclusion and exclusion, the data
extraction process, and the statistical analysis methods.

Implications for nursing

Based on our meta-analysis findings, patients with chronic pain benefited from ACT, exhibit-
ing various positive outcomes. This holds several implications for the field of nursing, as
detailed below:

ACT in Clinical Nursing Practice: Our findings indicate a moderate enhancement in pain
interference, functional impairment, pain acceptance, psychological inflexibility, and depres-
sive symptoms post-treatment, highlighting the significance of incorporating ACT techniques
in clinical nursing. To effectively integrate ACT, nurses can include it as part of standard
patient education and intervention measures. This could involve educating patients about
embracing their pain experiences for pain acceptance, rather than avoiding them. Nurses
could introduce mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing and body scanning, to enhance
patients’ body awareness and symptom management. Additionally, employing cognitive defu-
sion techniques in clinical teaching can aid patients in detaching from pain-related thoughts,
thereby reducing distress. Importantly, nurses should also focus on assisting patients in identi-
fying and pursuing personal values to enhance life satisfaction and overall quality of life.

Addressing Challenges in Implementing ACT: However, implementing ACT in clinical set-
tings may encounter challenges such as limited resources, time constraints, or the need for spe-
cialized training. To overcome these, nurses could utilize brief ACT-based interventions or
digital ACT resources, which are time-efficient and easily accessible. Furthermore, regular
training programs for nurses in ACT principles and techniques could be beneficial.

Enhanced Follow-up Strategies in ACT-Based Nursing: The sustained improvements in

functional impairment and other symptoms at three months post-treatment highlight the

importance of effective follow-up in ACT-based nursing. Nurses should develop personalized
follow-up plans that include regular reassessments and skill reinforcement sessions to practice
ACT techniques. Addressing barriers to continued practice and empowering patients with
self-monitoring tools are crucial for maintaining and building upon treatment gains.

Future research directions in ACT for chronic pain management

Exploring ACT’s Efficacy Across Various Chronic Pain Conditions: Future studies should
investigate how ACT specifically benefits different types of chronic pain conditions, such as
neuropathic pain, arthritis, or fibromyalgia. Understanding the nuances in ACT’s effectiveness
for various pain types can guide clinicians in tailoring interventions to individual patient
needs and conditions.

Intervention Delivery by Nursing Staff in Clinical Settings: Current interventions are pre-
dominantly led by psychologists. Future studies should explore the feasibility and effectiveness
of interventions delivered by nursing staff in hospital settings. This approach could facilitate
the integration of ACT into routine patient care and make the therapy more accessible.

Integrating ACT into Nurses’ Routine Care: Future research could explore integrating ACT

into the daily interactions between nursing staff and patients, as well as into clinical health
education, care planning, and pain management strategies, rather than relying solely on struc-
tured courses led by psychologists or on patients’ self-learning. Such integration could enhance
patient engagement and make the principles of ACT more applicable to the everyday clinical
setting.

Long-Term Follow-up Studies: There is a need for studies with extended follow-up periods,
such as one year or more, to observe the long-term effects of ACT on chronic pain. Longer fol-
low-up can provide valuable insights into the sustainability of treatment benefits and patient
adherence over time.

Developing Nurse-Led Follow-Up Programs: Future research could focus on creating fol-
low-up programs led by nurses, based on the principles of ACT. These programs could include
regular motivational interviews, personalized ACT-based exercises, and continuous monitor-
ing of patients’ progress in specific ACT interventions. Nurses could also provide ongoing sup-
port through digital platforms, such as ACT-based mobile applications or online support
groups, to facilitate sustained patient engagement and adherence to ACT practices outside the
clinical setting.

Controlling Participant Attrition in Research: Future studies should implement strategies
to minimize participant dropout rates. High attrition can affect the reliability of results; thus,
maintaining participant engagement throughout the study is crucial for obtaining robust and
generalizable findings.

Conclusion

Chronic pain can profoundly influence various facets of an individual’s life. ACT strives to
enable patients to participate in numerous meaningful activities, especially when chronic pain
is ineliminable, thereby reducing its adverse effects. Our findings demonstrate that ACT exhib-
ited effects ranging from small to large on all outcome measures among patients with chronic
pain, and these effects sustained up to three months post-treatment. However, further evi-
dence is still required to ascertain whether these positive impacts persist across specific pain
conditions and more extended periods. We hope that future RCTs will be conducted in more
specific chronic pain settings with longer follow-ups to draw more precise and relevant
conclusions.
