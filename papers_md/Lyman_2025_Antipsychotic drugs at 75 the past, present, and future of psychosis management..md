Abstract 
Introduction: The  discovery  of  chlorpromazine  in  1950  marked  a  turning  point  in  psychiatry,  and,  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  effective 
pharmacological  treatments  for  psychosis  became  widely  used.  Over  the  following  decades,  antipsychotics  became  the 
cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment, yet their fundamental mechanism—dopamine D2 receptor anta gonism—has remained
largely unchanged. Now, 75 years on, novel drug classes and advances in mechanistic understanding are reshaping the ﬁeld.
Sources  of  data: This  review  synthesizes  ﬁndings  from  clinical  trials,  neurobiological  research,  and  pharmacological  studies, 
highlighting the evolution of antipsychotic treatment.
Areas of agreement: Antipsychotics reduce positive symptoms, but their efﬁcacy for negative and cognitive symptoms is limited. 
Clozapine remains t he gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
Areas of controversy: The typical/atypical distinction is increasingly seen as outdated. The dopamine hypothesis, while central, 
does not fully explain schizophrenia.
Growing  points:  Emerging  nondopaminergic  treatments—such  as  the  muscarinic  agonist  xanomeline-trospium—offer  new
therapeutic avenues.
Areas timely for developing research: Further research is needed to determine the clinical utility of nondopaminergic drugs, 
reﬁne stratiﬁed treatment approac hes, and integrate precision psychiatry into psychosis management.

Keywords:  antipsychotics; psychosis; schizophrenia; precision psychiatry; dopamine

Introduction 
Few  medical  discoveries  have  reshaped  healthcare 
as  profoundly  as  antipsychotics.  Before  1950,  the 
treatment  of  chronic  psychotic  disorders  such  as 
schizophrenia  was  ineffective  and  often  brutal.  The 
discovery  of  chlorpromazine  offered—for  the  first 
time—a drug that could treat psychosis. Within a few 
years, pharmacological interventions were a core aspect 
of schizophrenia treatment, and psychopharmacology 
became a defining feature of psychiatry more broadly. 
The discovery of antidepressants in the following years
gave the impression that a new era of unstoppable
progress had arrived. However, this promise was
not
fully realized. Over subsequent decades there
were minimal advances in terms of antipsychotic

mechanism of action and, except for clozapine, only
minor improvements in efficacy.

As  we  approach  the  75th  anniversary  of  the  dis-
covery of antipsychotics, however, the field is shifting 
once  again.  New  antipsychotics  with  entirely  novel 
mechanisms  offer  hope  of  both  greater  efficacy  and 
fewer side effects, while our understanding of current
treatments and their optimal use has evolved. The next
era of psychosis treatment may be the most transfor-
mative yet.

Barking up the right tree: the 
serendipitous disco very of antipsychotics

For  most  of  human  history,  psychosis  and  chronic 
psychotic  disorders  were  seen  through  mystical  or 
moralistic  lenses.  The  turn  of  the  20th  century  saw 
them  rapidly  settle  within  a  medical  framework. 
Emil  Kraepelin’s  efforts  to  distil  the  heterogeneity  of 
his  psychiatric  presentations led him to distinguish
‘dementia praecox’ from manic-depressive illness in
1893. Subsequently, in 1908, Eugen Bleuler redefined
the former as schizophrenia—its Greek roots meaning
‘split mind’, reflecting the fragmentation of thought,
perception, and personality [2]. 

The  gold-standard  treatment  at  the  time  remained 
long-term  asylum  confinement.  As  asylums  became 
overcrowded  and  under-resourced,  the  search  for 
biological  treatments  gained  urgency.  One of
the
first major approaches was insulin coma therapy,
introduced in the 1920s by Austrian psychiatrist
Manfred Sakel [3].  Patients  were  injected  with  large 
doses  of  insulin,  driving  them  into  a  hypoglycaemic 
coma, with the idea that it might ‘reset’ the brain. While 
some patients showed improvement, the procedure was
unpredictable and often led to brain damage or even
death.

In  the  1930s,  convulsive  therapies  gained  traction. 
Inspired by the erroneous observation that epilepsy and 
schizophrenia  appeared  to  rarely  coexist,  Hungarian 
physician Ladislas Meduna injected high doses of a
central and respiratory stimulant—commonly called
Cardiazol– into patients to induce seizures [4].  Ital-
ian  psychiatrists  Ugo  Cerletti  and  Lucio  Bini  refined 
this approach by developing electroconvulsive therapy 
(ECT), which induced seizures through electric currents 
rather than drugs. ECT proved effective in treating
severe mental illness and remains in use today.

the 

Psychosurgery,  particularly 

lobotomy,  also 
became widespread. First performed by the Portuguese 
neurologist  Antonio  Moniz  in  1935, the procedure
lobes
involved severing connections of the frontal
to reduce agitation [5].  The  effect  was  often  catas-
trophic—patients often became apathetic and severely 
impaired—but  the procedure spread rapidly, with
thousands performed worldwide.

By the end of the 1940s, the need for effective treat-
ments  for  psychotic  disorders  such  as  schizophrenia 
was  clear.  Existing  treatments  were  crude,  high-risk, 
and  often  ineffective,  driven  by  the  desperation  of 
patients, clinicians, and families. While pharmacolog-
ical treatments were employed, these were solely seda-
tives, easing the management of aggression and agita-
tion but having no real impact on the core symptoms
of psychosis.

‘It  provokes  not  any  loss  in  consciousness,  not 
any  change  in  the  patient’s  mentality  but  a  slight 
tendency  to  sleep  and  above  all  “disinterest’  for 
all  that  goes  on  around  him . . ..These  facts  let 
us  for see certain indications for this drug in
psychiatry’ [6]. 

Laborit, Huguenard & Allaume, A new autonomic 
stabiliser 4560 RP, February 13 1952.

For centuries, the only effective treatment for malaria 
was  quinine:  a  medication  derived  from  the  bark  of 
the South American ‘cinchona’ tree. However, wartime 
shortages of cinchona bark during the First and Second 
World  Wars  triggered  a  rush  to  produce  a  synthetic 
antimalarial drug. In the early 1940s, French chemist 
Paul  Charpentier  and his team at Rhone-Poulenc
Laboratories began synthesizing phenothiazine deriva-
tives—compounds originally used in the German dye
industry that also exhibited antiparasitic properties.
Although this search for a malaria treatment ultimately
failed, some of these synthetic compounds proved to
be effective antihistamines—particularly promethazine
[7]. 

Promethazine—an antagonist of both histamine and 
muscarinic  acetylcholine  receptors—had  pronounced 
sedative  effects  alongside  its  antihistaminergic  prop-
erties.  Henri-Marie  Laborit,  a  French  navy  surgeon 
stationed  in  North  Africa,  found  the  drug to be a
powerful addition to his experimental ‘lytic cocktail’:
a concoction designed to treat the shock, stress, and
anxiety during and after surgery [8].  As  part  of 
Laborit’s search for ever more potent compounds, he 
came across the compound 4560-RP, one of the Rhone-
Poulenc derivatives of promazine [9].  When  Laborit 
incorporated  this  compound  into  his  tranquilizing 
cocktail, he noticed an unprecedented effect: relaxation
and emotional detachment without an impairment of
consciousness.

News of chlorpromazine’s effects soon reached psy-
chiatrists  Jean  Delay  and  Pierre  Deniker  at  Sainte-
Anne Hospital in Paris, who conducted seminal clinical
trials of the isolated compound in psychiatric patients
[10]. Their  first  case  study  was  that  of  a  57-year-old 
labourer whose manic, erratic behaviour had led him to 
randomly assault strangers. After 3 weeks of treatment
with chlorpromazine, he made a full recovery—one of
many such cases [11]. Chlorpromazine became the first 
‘neuroleptic’ (Delay and Deniker’s term, meaning ‘tak-
ing hold of the nerves’), marking the birth of modern
psychopharmacology.

Discovering dopamine

While  the  shortage  of  cinchona  bark  indirectly  led 
to  the  discovery  of  chlorpromazine,  scientists  in  the 
early 1950s were also examining the roots of Rauvolfia 
serpentina  (Indian  snakeroot),  a  plant  long  used  in 
Ayurvedic medicine for its tranquilizing properties. In
1952, scientists isolated reserpine, one of its active
compounds, which was isolated in 1952 and marketed
as an antipsychotic 2 years later [12]. However, while 
reserpine’s  side  effects  limited  its  psychiatric  use,  it 
became  a  useful tool for neuroscientists seeking to
understand the chemistry of the brain.

In  the  late  1950s,  Swedish  pharmacologist  Arvid 
Carlsson  discovered  that  one  of  reserpine’s  most 
striking side effects—stiffness and slowed movement— 
could  be  reversed  by  L-dopa,  the precursor of
dopamine. This led to the discovery of dopamine
as a neurotransmitter, paving the way for major
breakthroughs in neurobiology.

By  the  mid-1970s,  in  vitro  studies  had  confirmed 
that  the  clinical  effectiveness  of  antipsychotics  in 
schizophrenia was strongly linked to their affinity
for dopamine D2 receptors [13,14].  Subsequent  in 
vivo  imaging  studies  in  patients  demonstrated  that  a 
therapeutic window for D2 occupancy existed between 
60% and 80%; any lower and the drug is likely to be
ineffective, any higher and the risk of extrapyramidal
side effects
such as parkinsonism, and
hyperprolactinaemia increases significantly [15]. 

(EPSEs)

In  addition  to  the  antipsychotic  effects  of  reduc-
ing  dopaminergic  signalling, a  large  body  of  research 
implicates dopamine dysregulation in the pathophysi-
ology of schizophrenia. This is most evident in positron 
emission  tomography  studies  that  have  demonstrated 
elevated  presynaptic  dopamine  synthesis  and  release 
capacity  in  the  striatum  in  schizophrenia, which  cor-
relates  with  the  severity  of  ‘positive  symptoms’ such
as hallucinations and delusions. It was initially unclear
as to whether it is a pre- or postsynaptic pathology,
but it appears that presynaptic dopamine is higher in
antipsychotic naïve individuals with psychosis com-
pared to controls, whereas postsynaptic increases are a
secondary effect of prior antipsychotic treatment [16]. 
By the late 20th century, a relatively consistent pic-
ture  had  emerged:  that  in  a  significant  proportion 
of  patients,  the  positive  symptoms  of  schizophrenia 
were driven by a hyperdopaminergic state in the stria-
tum, a dysfunction that could be treated by blocking
dopamine D2 receptors.

Another notable antihistamine tested as an antipsy-
chotic  in  the  early  1950s  was  imipramine.  However, 
rather  than  alleviating  psychosis,  it  unexpectedly 
demonstrated  potent  antidepressant  effects.  With 
serendipitous  circularity,  when  the  Swiss  pharma-
ceutical company Wander AG began synthesizing
new compounds based on imipramine in 1958, their
efforts led to the discovery of a truly remarkable
antipsychotic: clozapine [17]. Successful clinical trials 
in  the  1960s  and  early  adoption  of  the  new  drug 
in  the  1970s  were  halted  in  1975  by  the discovery
of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (extremely low
levels of white blood cells) in a Finnish cohort, leading
to eight deaths [18]. However, following  a  landmark 
1988  study  that  demonstrated  its  superiority  to 
chlorpromazine  in  treatment-resistant  schizophrenia, 
clozapine  remains—with  stringent  haematological
monitoring requirements—the treatment of choice in
those who have not responded to other antipsychotics
[19]. 

Clozapine  was  not  only  set  apart  from  existing 
antipsychotics  by  its  efficacy;  it  also  appeared  to 
potentially  involve  a  different  mechanism  of  action. 
Notably, it had a reduced affinity for the D2 receptor
compared to other antipsychotics at the time and was
found to be clinically efficacious at doses associated
with a lower dopamine D2 receptor occupancy than
other drugs [20].  Its  relatively  weak  and  transient 
affinity for D2 receptors accompanied a broad receptor 
profile: a high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors 
and  potent  antagonism  at  muscarinic  M1-M5  and 
histamine H1 receptors, as well as effects on adrenergic 
α 1 and α2 receptors. Intriguingly, clozapine is unique
among antipsychotics in that its active metabolite, N-
desmethylclozapine, is a full agonist at muscarinic M1
receptors, which is relevant given recent discoveries as
to the antipsychotic potential of muscarinic agonists
(see below) [21].  This  pharmacology  underlined  its 
strikingly  different  side-effect  profile:  one  of  a  lower 
risk of movement disorders but increased weight gain 
and  other  metabolic  changes.  The  search  for  similar 
compounds  in  the  1990s  led  to  a  proliferation of
what are still commonly termed ‘atypical’ or ‘second-
generation’
risperidone,
olanzapine, and quetiapine. While their efficacy
relative to clozapine’s efficacy in treatment-resistant
[22],  most 
schizophrenia was not entirely clear
retained their distinctive feature of serotonin 5-HT2A
antagonism alongside D2 blockade, which was thought

to  contribute  to  a  lower  risk  of  EPSEs.  Although  in 
retrospect  this  advantage  appears  largely  a  reflection 
of  dosing  differences,  atypicals  became  the  preferred 
choice in routine practice due to perceived tolerability, 
expanded indications, and a growing clinical emphasis 
on  minimising  movement-related  side  effects.  Large 
pragmatic  trials  were  undertaken, aimed at clarifying
the relative benefits of the newer drugs over their
predecessors. These trials, however, demonstrated that
these new compounds were not as distinct as originally
proposed, with second-generation drugs (other than
clozapine) not demonstrating a clinical benefit over
older compounds [23,24].  An  objective  analysis  of 
both  the  pharmacology  and  clinical  effects  of  these 
compounds  provides  little  support  for  the  idea  that 
there are clear differences between first- and second-
generation drugs other than the date of marketing
approval [25,26]. 

The  turn  of  the  21st  century,  however,  saw  the 
emergence  of  a  pharmacologically  distinct  class  of 
antipsychotics. In  the  late  1980s, scientists  at  Otsuka 
Pharmaceutical  in  Japan  set  out  to  address  two 
major  limitations  of  existing  treatments:  first,  their 
well-established  side  effects,  including  EPSEs  and 
metabolic  disturbances, that  often  limited  tolerability 
and adherence. Second, the fact that while D2 receptor 
blockade  in  the  striatum  effectively  reduced  positive 
symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, it failed 
to  produce  clinically  meaningful  improvements  in 
negative symptoms—deficits in motivation, emotional
expression, and social engagement—thought to stem
from dopaminergic hypoactivity in the prefrontal cor-
tex. The concept of a dopamine partial agonist had been
raised in 1983 by Arvid Carlsson, specifically a drug
that could act as an antagonist in hyperdopaminergic
areas (e.g. the striatum, implicated in psychosis) while
simultaneously stimulating underactive dopamine
receptors in hypodopaminergic areas (e.g. the pre-
frontal cortex, implicated in negative symptoms) [27]. 
The  Otsuka  team  pursued  this  approach,  seeking  a 
compound  that  could  balance  dopamine  signalling 
rather than simply block it outright. Their search led 
to aripiprazole, a novel D2/D3 partial agonist that was 
United  Stated  Food  and  Drug  Administration (FDA)-
approved in 2002, becoming the first of what is often
termed ‘third-generation antipsychotics’. Clinically,
aripiprazole offered a reduction in positive symptoms
with fewer EPSEs and metabolic side effects than older
antipsychotics [28]. A subsequently  developed  partial 
agonist,  cariprazine,  is  the  only  compound  to  have 
convincingly shown a benefit on negative symptoms in
a head-to-head trial against an alternative antipsychotic
[29]. 

Today,  clinicians  have  access  to  over  25  licenced 
antipsychotics. While  all  these  drugs, at  least  in  part, 

such as

exert  their  effects  through  the  dopamine  receptor, 
each  has  a  unique  receptor-binding  profile  that 
influences  both  efficacy  and  side  effects. Despite  this 
pharmacological  diversity,  the  way  these  drugs  are 
commonly  classified  has  remained  largely  unchanged 
for decades, with the traditional
typical/atypical
distinction increasingly recognized as inadequate for
guiding clinical decisions. Attempts have been made to
employ a more pharmacologically informed approach
to classification,
the neuroscience-based
nomenclature (NbN), which categorizes antipsychotics
by their primary pharmacological actions instead of
historical or marketing-based distinctions [30]. A more 
data-driven approach involved the automated analysis 
of  receptor-binding  data  from  over  3000  studies, 
to identify four distinct pharmacological clusters of
antipsychotics based on their receptor affinities [26]. 
This  new  system  more  accurately  predicted  both 
efficacy  and  side-effect  burden  better  than  current 
classifications.  The  ‘muscarinic  antagonism’  group 
includes  drugs  with  significant  M2–M5  muscarinic 
receptor antagonism, such as clozapine and olanzapine. 
These  agents  offer  high  efficacy  but  are  strongly 
associated with metabolic side effects. The ‘adrenergic 
antagonism  and  dopamine  partial  agonism’  group 
consists  of  newer  drugs  like  aripiprazole, which  have 
slightly lower overall efficacy but fewer side effects. The 
‘dopaminergic  antagonism’  group—which includes
drugs such as amisulpride—is characterized by high
efficacy but a greater risk of extrapyramidal side
effects and hyperprolactinaemia. The ‘serotonergic and
dopaminergic antagonism’ group contains compounds
such as risperidone and is associated with a moderate
degree of both motor and metabolic side effects.
This ‘MADS’
framework (Muscarinic antagonism,
Adrenergic antagonism/dopamine partial agonism,
Dopaminergic antagonism, Serotonergic/dopaminergic
antagonism) is illustrated in Fig. 1. 

Recent work has potentially challenged the decades-
old  axiom  that  D2  receptor antagonism is key to
antipsychotic efficacy [31]. Preclinical work examining 
the  activity  of  striatal  D1  and  D2  spiny  projection 
neurons (SPNs) suggested that, despite binding to D2 
receptors, the common characteristic of antipsychotic 
compounds  is  in  fact  their  ability  to  modulate  the 
activity  of  D1-SPNs.  Importantly,  even  novel  and 
experimental  antipsychotics  with  no  direct  dopamine 
receptor  affinity  also  achieved  this  effect,  suggesting
a broader, circuit-level mechanism of action. The
study also found that D1 receptor partial agonists
were efficacious through state-dependent modulation,
resulting in a stabilization effect: acting as an agonist
when dopamine levels were low and an antagonist
when dopamine was excessive. Overall, these findings
suggest that D1-SPN hyperactivity may play a central

role in psychosis and that restoring their balance could 
be a crucial marker of antipsychotic efficacy.

Serendipity strikes again: new 
antipsychotics and novel mechanisms

‘The skill lies in detecting what actually happened 
during  tests  rather  than  what  the  theory  suggests 
must have happened.’

David Healy, The Creation of Psyc hopharmacology, 
2002. 

The  idea  that  a  reduction  in  cholinergic  signalling 
might  contribute  to  symptoms  of  Alzheimer’s  disease 
motivated  attempts  to  develop  treatments  acting  via 
stimulation  of  cholinergic  signalling  at  muscarinic
receptors. In the early 1990s, a newly synthesized mus-
carinic M1 and M4 receptor agonist called xanomeline
appeared to show promise in this endeavour [32]. 
Initial trials suggested cognitive benefit, but a very curi-
ous  side  effect  soon  became  apparent:  a  reduction  in 
hallucinations and delusions in patients with psychotic 
symptoms.  Development  of  xanomeline’s  potential 
as  either  a  treatment  for  dementia  or  psychosis, 
however,  was  hampered  by serious gastrointestinal
side effects. Two decades later, a coformulation of
xanomeline with trospium chloride—a peripheral
muscarinic antagonist that does not cross the blood–
brain barrier—ameliorated xanomeline’s side effects
without reducing its psychiatric efficacy [33].  Three 
randomized  placebo-controlled  trials  of  xanomeline-
trospium have since demonstrated encouraging efficacy 
in reducing positive symptoms in acute exacerbations 
of  schizophrenia,  and  it  is  the  f irst treatment for
schizophrenia licensed by the FDA to not possess
direct activity at the dopamine receptor [34].  There 
is also hope for clinically meaningful effects in negative 
and  cognitive  symptoms,  as  well  as  superior  long-
term  tolerability  to  existing  antipsychotics,  which 
are  all  being assessed in ongoing clinical trials. The
neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms via which
muscarinic agonism exerts an antipsychotic effect
remain to be established [35]. M4 agonism does appear 
to attenuate striatal hyperdopaminergia, but the recent 
failed  trials  of  the  pure  M4  modulator  emraclidine 
suggests that xanomeline is not just another dopamine
modulator and that M1 effects may contribute to
efficacy [36]. 

Alongside  other  muscarinic  agonists,  there  are  a 
variety  of  antipsychotics  in  development  that  seek  to 
target  nondopaminergic  mechanisms. A  disruption  of 
the  signalling  between  excitatory  glutamatergic  and 
inhibitory  GABAergic  cortical  neurons  has  been  pro-
posed to account for cognitive and negative symptoms 
of  the  disorder  that  do  not  respond  to  dopamine 

blockade.  Drugs  modulating  glutaminergic  receptors, 
such  as  the  N-methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor, 
have therefore been investigated in attempts to restore
potential imbalances within these circuits. Iclepertin
inhibits glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1), theoretically
increasing levels of glycine (a co-agonist of NMDA
receptors) in the synaptic cleft and aiding glutamatergic
signalling. Despite encouraging improvements on
cognitive function in phase II trials, recent phase
III results were unsuccessful, in keeping with earlier
failed trials of another GlyT1 inhibitor, bitopertin [37]. 
Similarly, numerous studies of glycine modulatory site 
agonists,  such  as  glycine  and  D-serine, have not yet
shown convincing clinical effects in human trials [38]. 
Modulation  of  the  glutaminergic  system  still  holds 
promise,  with  evenamide—a  voltage-gated  sodium 
channel inhibitor—demonstrating efficacy as an add-
on treatment in schizophrenia [39]. 

While  modulation  of  the  NMDA  receptor  has  not 
yet  proven  effective  in  treating  idiopathic  psychosis, 
encephalitis  secondary  to  anti-NMDA  antibodies 
can  induce  a  psychotic  state.  In  some  of  these 
individuals, complete remission of psychosis has
occurred following immunotherapy, with a phase II
trial currently exploring the role of immune-directed
treatments in those with antibody-associated psychosis
[40]. Another unexpected avenue of research concerns 
cannabidiol  (CBD), a  nonpsychoactive  component  of 
cannabis,  which  appears  to  modulate  glutaminergic 
and  serotonergic  systems  indirectly.  While  CBD  is 
better  known  for its analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-
inflammatory properties, early clinical trials suggest
it may have antipsychotic potential, particularly as an
adjunct to existing treatments [41]. 

While  nondopaminergic  mechanisms  hold  signif-
icant  promise,  there  remains  room  for  innovation 
in  modulating  the  dopamine  system.  While  the
dopaminergic abnormalities associated with psychotic
disorders are primarily presynaptic, current treatments
act postsynaptically [42].  Ulotaront,  a  trace  amine-
associated  receptor  1  (TAAR1)  agonist, appears
to normalize presynaptic hyperdopaminergia [43]. 
Despite  showing  promise  in  an  initial phase two
study [44], a subsequent phase three failed, potentially 
as  a  result of a remarkably high placebo response
[45].  A  classical  approach  may  still  have  benefits; 
N-methylamisulpride—a  derivative  of  amisulpride 
and  potent  dopamine  D2/3  receptor  antagonist—has
shown promise in phase II studies and has progressed
to phase III trials [46]. 

Form matters: the evolving r ole of
long-acting injectables
A  final  note  should  be  made  on  the  impact of
antipsychotic delivery methods, particularly the use of

Antipsychotics at 75

intramuscular 

long-acting  injectable  (LAIs), also  known  as  ‘depots.’ 
Adherence  to  antipsychotic  medication  is  notoriously 
low—resulting  from  both  the  adverse  effects  of  the 
treatments and the limited insight, cognitive impair-
ment, and motivational deficits that characterizes many
chronic psychotic illnesses [47]. LAIs  are  designed  to 
maintain  continuous  drug  exposure  over  weeks  or
months, reducing the risk of relapse from missed doses.
First  introduced  in  the  1960s  with  f luphenazine
enanthate and decanoate [48],  early  LAIs  were  oil-
based  formulations  injected  into  muscle,  developed 
to  support  adherence  during  the  shift  to  community-
based  care.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  however, 
significant  innovations  in  long-term  delivery  have 
emerged. In 2003, a risperidone LAI using biodegrad-
able  microspheres  allowed  for  steady  release  via 
injections.  Since  then, 
two-weekly 
a  range  of  delivery  technologies—aqueous  crystal 
suspensions,  in  situ  depot-forming  polymers,  and 
esterified  prodrugs—have  been  developed,  all  aiming 
to create sustained-release reservoirs of antipsychotics.

worth noting that other formulations of antipsychotics,
which might improve acceptability or adherence—are
available, including inhaled loxapine and once weekly
oral penfluirdol [49].  Experimental  approaches  such 
as  intranasal  clozapine—designed  to  reduce  systemic 
side effects through direct-to-brain delivery—are also
in development [50].

Conclusions: looking back and moving 
forward
The  discovery  of  chlorpromazine  in  1950  marked  a 
turning  point  in  psychiatry,  transforming  psychosis 
from  a  condition  managed  through  institutionaliza-
tion  and  crude  interventions  into  one  that  could 
be  treated  pharmacologically.  In  the  decades  that 
followed, antipsychotic drugs evolved in terms of their 
pharmacology, tolerability, and side-effect profiles, but
their fundamental mechanism—dopamine D2 receptor
antagonism—remained largely unchanged. Now, as
we mark the 75th anniversary of antipsychotics, we
may be witnessing the dawn of a new era in psychosis
treatment.

For  the  first  time,  drugs  that  do  not  primarily 
target  the  dopamine  system  are  reaching  clinical 
practice,  challenging  long-held  assumptions  about 
antipsychotic  mechanisms.  The  recent  FDA  approval 
of  xanomeline–trospium  highlights  the  potential  of 

muscarinic  agonists,  and  other  novel  approaches  are 
being  actively  investigated.  At the same time, our
understanding of schizophrenia has expanded beyond a
simple dopamine imbalance to a more complex, circuit-
level disorder, opening new avenues for treatment
development. Understanding how these developments
should shape treatment approaches is a major challenge
[51]. 

However,  despite  pharmacological  advances,  out-
comes for individuals with psychotic disorders have not 
improved  as  much  as  might  have  been  hoped. Many 
patients  continue  to  experience  persistent  symptoms, 
severe side effects, and profound social and functional 
impairments.  Reducing  the  burden  of psychosis will
require more than just better drugs;
it demands a
broader approach that integrates early intervention,
psychosocial support, and advances in neuroscience to
better tailor treatments to individual needs.

Scientific  progress  in  psychiatry  has  often  been 
driven  by  a  combination  of  curiosity,  technological 
innovation,  and  serendipity.  The  history  of  antipsy-
chotic  discovery—from  chlorpromazine’s  origins 
in  antihistamines  to  the  unexpected  antipsychotic
effects of xanomeline—suggests that the future of
psychosis treatment may take equally unpredictable
turns. If history is any guide, the most transformative
discoveries may still lie ahead.
