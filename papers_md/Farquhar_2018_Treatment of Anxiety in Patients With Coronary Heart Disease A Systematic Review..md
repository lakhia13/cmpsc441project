Abstract

Objective—Anxiety is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated 
with increased risk for adverse outcomes. There has been a relative paucity of studies concerning 
treatment of anxiety in CHD patients. We conducted a systematic review to organize and assess 
research into the treatment of anxiety in CHD patients.

Methods—We searched CCTR/CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted before October 2016 that measured anxiety before 
and after an intervention for CHD patients.

Results—475 records were subjected to full text review, yielding 112 publications that met 
inclusion criteria plus an additional 7 studies from reference lists and published reviews, yielding 
119 studies. Sample size, country of origin, study quality, and demographics varied widely 
between studies. The majority of studies were conducted with non-anxious patients. The Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were the most frequently used 
instruments to assess anxiety. Interventions included pharmacological, counseling, relaxation-
based, educational, or “alternative” therapies. Forty (33% of total) studies reported that the 
interventions reduced anxiety; treatment efficacy varied by study and type of intervention. 
Elevated anxiety was an inclusion criterion in only 4 studies, with inconsistent results.

Conclusion—Although there have been a number of RCTs of CHD patients that assessed 
anxiety, in most cases anxiety was a secondary outcome, and only one third found that symptoms 
of anxiety were reduced with treatment. Future studies need to target anxious patients and evaluate 
the effects of treatment on anxiety and relevant clinical endpoints.

Introduction

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is among the most prevalent diseases in developed countries 
and remains a leading cause of hospitalization, mortality, and healthcare expenditure

worldwide (1, 2). A number of risk factors contribute to the development and progression of 
CHD, including smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. There is growing 
recognition that psychosocial factors also have prognostic significance (3-5), with anxiety 
and depression in particular frequently studied in relation to heart disease.

Anxiety appears to be common among CHD patients. The prevalence of generalized anxiety 
disorder (GAD) in the CHD population has been estimated to be approximately be 8%, 
panic disorder 7%, agoraphobia 4%, social phobia 5%, and other phobias 4%; the prevalence 
of any anxiety disorder is around 15% in CHD patients, and is higher among CHD patients 
in inpatient settings.(6, 7) Perhaps due to its prevalence in the CHD population, anxiety has 
been increasingly studied as a prognostic factor in patients with CHD.

Pre-operative anxiety in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 
has been associated with greater post-operative mortality (8), more readmissions (8), and 
more frequent outpatient clinic visits (9). In patients with stable CHD, both GAD and 
elevated anxiety symptoms are predictive of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (6, 10, 
11) and all-cause mortality (10, 12-14). Anxiety appears to be associated with a 36% 
increased risk of adverse cardiac outcomes in post-ACS patients, as well as increased all-
cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and cardiac events (15). Anxiety has also been 
independently associated with CHD risk factors, such as hypertension and tobacco use (16).

However, not all studies have confirmed a negative effect of anxiety on prognosis. For 
example, one meta-analysis of panic disorder in CHD found an inverse relationship between 
panic disorder and CHD in cardiology settings; 5 another recent meta-analysis reported no 
significant relationship between any subtype of anxiety and the development of MACEs in 
CHD patients (6, 17). Higher anxiety has also been associated with reduced incidence of 
CHD and mortality in at least two cohort studies (18, 19), and it has been suggested that 
some amount of anxiety, e.g. health-related concerns, may pre-empt patients to improve 
lifestyle factors related to CHD development (20). Thus, there may be factors that modify 
the relationship between anxiety and CHD, such as the level of anxiety or specific diagnosis, 
that deserve further attention.

In addition to anxiety, depression is common in patients with CHD, with major depressive 
disorder (MDD) affecting 15-20% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and up 
to an additional 20% exhibiting elevated depressive symptoms (21). Moreover, MDD is 
associated with a two- to four-fold increase in mortality (22). In a recent systematic review, 
the American Heart Association recognized depression as a risk factor for ACS patients.(23) 
As MDD is widely recognized as a negative prognostic factor for CHD patients, there have 
been a number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) treating depression in CHD patients 
(24-28); however to date, there has been little evidence that treating depression improves 
clinical outcomes (29).

Although anxiety is common in the CHD population and has been associated with increased 
risk for adverse events in some studies, the value of treating anxiety in these patients has 
received considerably less attention compared to depression(30, 31). Several meta-analyses 
show that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs (CR) (32, 33), and music therapy

(34) may reduce anxiety in CHD patients, but these reports are based on relatively few 
published studies employing a variety of different interventions. Therefore, in order to 
compile and evaluate the existing interventions to reduce anxiety in CHD patients, we 
conducted a systematic review to examine the extant literature reporting the effects of 
treatment on anxiety in patients with CHD.

Methods

We systematically searched for RCTs that included a) outpatient interventions for patients 
with CHD; b) established measures of anxiety; and c) measures of anxiety pre-treatment and 
after the interventions were completed. Criteria for inclusion in our review were: (1) the 
study was a RCT; (2) all, or at least a significant proportion of patients, had CHD; (3) 
anxiety was measured and reported as an outcome; (4) the intervention occurred in an 
outpatient setting; and (5) the article was published in English in a peer-reviewed journal 
(i.e., conference abstracts and dissertations were excluded). Articles also were excluded 
from our review for the following reasons: (1) the study was conducted on non-humans; (2) 
the study involved children (age <18 years); (3) the treatment involved inpatient participants 
only; and (4) the article was a ‘methods’ or process paper that did not report results of the 
intervention on anxiety.

Search procedure

We searched the CCTR/CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL 
databases for studies that could fit our criteria. Our search required that articles include at 
least one term from each of the following lists in their title or abstract: (1) anxiety, phobia, or 
panic, (2) coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, cardiac disease, myocardial 
infarction, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary bypass surgery, 
unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, and (3) randomly, randomized, or 
clinical trial. For additional references, we conducted another search in which we replaced 
the terms in criterion 3 with the terms review, meta-analysis, systematic. In this manner, we 
sought to identify any missing published studies by searching the reference lists of 
previously published review articles.

The resulting articles were then compiled into an EndNote database (version 7) and 
duplicate studies were removed. Next, the first author (JF) conducted a review at the abstract 
level and selected for full text review only those studies that appeared to fit all inclusion 
criteria. Twenty abstracts were selected randomly for consideration by two reviewers (GS 
and JAB) to determine agreement on inclusion or exclusion. Complete agreement was 
obtained on all 20 articles. A full-text review and data extraction was performed for the 
remaining studies. We searched reference sections of studies from which we extracted data 
and of studies identified in our database search that may have been missed in the original 
search. Any studies that fit all review criteria also were included in our final tables and 
analyses.

If all criteria were met, data were extracted from the article including the first author, journal 
and date of publication, country of origin, demographics and clinical characteristics of the 
sample, the anxiety instrument, a description of the intervention and control conditions,

primary and secondary outcomes, and anxiety-related results. One reviewer first extracted 
the relevant data, rated their degree of certainty in their abstraction of the data, and if there 
was any uncertainty, a second reviewer independently extracted data from the same article. 
Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved via a thorough joint re-review of the 
manuscript. Forty studies were jointly reviewed by two reviewers, and agreement was 
achieved for all studies.

Study quality was quantified using a modified PEDro scoring system for RCTs (35). Studies 
were evaluated based on criteria including completely random assignment, control for non-
study interventions, blinding of outcome assessors, intention-to-treat analysis, and presence 
of a CONSORT flow chart or a detailed report of attrition. Based on our ratings for these 
criteria, we assigned each study an overall quality score. The scale used for the quality score 
was as follows: 5=Excellent; 4=Good; 3=Fair; 2=Poor.

Our search terms resulted in 3,660 publications, of which 617 (17%) were duplicates. Of the 
remaining 3,043 articles, 2,568 (84%) did not meet inclusion criteria during the abstract-
level review; this included 57 review articles or meta-analyses published between 1979 and 
2016. Of the remaining 475 RCTs, 363 (76%) did not meet our inclusion criteria during full 
text review, leaving 112 remaining studies (Figure 1). Our additional review of citations 
from reference sections of included studies and review articles yielded another 7 studies 
(36-42). We determined that our original search terms did not identify these studies because 
the title and abstract failed to include terms for anxiety (5 studies), CHD (1 study), or 
randomization (1 study). Ultimately, 119 studies were included in our review.

Results

Study characteristics

Country of origin—The included studies originated from 25 countries. Most studies were 
conducted in the United Kingdom (30 studies) and United States (24 studies). Of the 
remaining studies, 10 were conducted in Canada, 9 in the Netherlands, 6 each in Iran and 
Australia, 4 in India, and the remainder in Belgium (1 study), Brazil (1), China (3), Denmark 
(2), Germany (3), Greece (1), Hong Kong (1), Ireland (1), Italy (2), Japan (2), New Zealand 
(2), Norway (1), Poland (1), South Korea (1), Saudi Arabia (1), Singapore (2), Sweden (2), 
and Thailand (1). Two studies were conducted in multiple countries.

Sample Characteristics

Inclusion criteria: For the majority of studies (93 studies, out of 119), the inclusion criteria 
did not specifically include a psychiatric diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Of the remaining 
26 studies, 4 included elevated anxiety in their inclusion criteria (30, 31, 39, 43), 9 included 
patients with anxiety and/or depression (44-52), 8 included patients with depression, 
depressive symptoms, or mood disorder only (36, 37, 40, 53-57), 3 included patients with 
‘distress’ (10, 58, 59), one included patients with “psychosomatic symptoms” including 
restlessness, anxiety, altered mood, and insomnia (60), and another included patients with 
“exhaustion” (61).

Sample size: Sample sizes ranged from 10 (62) to 3,822 (63) participants. The average 
number of participants analyzed per study was 204 (median N = 107). Thirty-eight studies 
reported analyzing a smaller number of patients than were initially randomized (i.e., failed 
to analyze data adhering to the intent-to-treat principle).

Demographic characteristics: The average age of participants ranged from 49 (64) to 81 
(65) years; 10 studies did not report a mean or median age for their participants, but rather 
reported an age range. The majority of studies did not report the race or ethnicity of 
participants, particularly studies conducted outside of the United States, the United 
Kingdom, and Canada. Of studies that reported participant race, participants ranged from 
0% (66) to 100% (67) Caucasian. Sex of participants was primarily male (median 80% 
male). Eight studies did not report participant sex.

Clinical characteristics: Patients were primarily post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or 
post-revascularization procedure (74 studies), and included patients who had recently had an 
MI, an episode of unstable angina, or a coronary revascularization procedure such as 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
Participants were considered to have had ‘stable’ CHD in 26 studies. Participants were 
awaiting a coronary procedure, such as a PCI or CABG, in 10 studies. Nine studies reported 
that participants fit into more than one of these categories. Three studies (3%) included 
patients who did not have CHD. One was split evenly between patients hospitalized with MI 
(23%), unstable angina (26%), congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia (68). Another 
included patients hospitalized with primary diagnoses of acute coronary syndrome (22%), 
unspecified heart failure (68%), or aortic stenosis (10%) (65). The final paper used a sample 
of patients with coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy but did not specify how many 
patients fell into either category (69).

Instruments to assess anxiety—A wide array of instruments was used to assess 
anxiety. The most frequently used scales were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-
Anxiety (HADS) scale (70) used in 45 studies, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 
(71) used in 36 studies. Of the studies that used the STAI, the majority (N =18) used the 
STAI-State, 4 used the STAI-Trait, and 12 used both the STAI-State and STAI-Trait; two 
studies did not specify which form was used. Other scales used less frequently (i.e., used in 
<4 studies) included the Anxiety Scale Questionnaire, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Brief 
Symptom Inventory Anxiety Subscale, Cattell Self-Analysis form, Covi Scale, Derogatis 
Stress Profile, General Practitioner Research Group Nine-Item Anxiety Rating Scale, 
General Health Questionnaire-Anxiety, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hopkins Symptom 
Check-List Self Rating Scale for Anxiety, Kessler scale, Multiple Affect Adjective 
Checklist, Profile of Mood States-Anxiety, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System anxiety items, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Symptoms of Anxiety-
Depression Index, the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 form, Symptom Rating 
Test, Symptom Questionnaire, Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, Welsh's Anxiety Scale, and a 
single anxiety item using a Likert scale. While our EndNote search included terms for panic 
disorder and phobia, the resulting articles only used instruments measuring generalized 
anxiety or health-related anxiety.

Interventions

Page 6

Interventions varied widely and were categorized into five different types of treatments: (1) 
Pharmacological; (2) Relaxation; (3) Counseling; (4) Education and risk factor management; 
and (5) Alternative therapies. Some studies fit into more than category, e.g., offering both 
education and counseling in at-home nursing visits (58): these studies were considered in the 
treatment category that the study authors characterized as the primary intervention type.

Pharmacological interventions—Twelve studies primarily involved pharmacotherapy 
(Table 1). Intervention duration ranged from 2 days to 4 years, with median length being 8 
weeks.

Medications were compared to placebo in 11 of 12 studies.

Psychoactive medications: 7 were psychoactive medications: alprazolam (45, 72), 
clorazepate (31, 43, 73), hydroxyzine (74), and escitalopram (75).

Coronary Heart Disease Medications: Other studies examined the effects of medications 
that treat CHD or CHD risk factors, including two studies using beta-blockers (e.g., 
propranolol and atenolol) (76, 77), and one using a statin (pravastatin) (78). Another study 
examined the effects of diltiazem and dibromotyrosine compared to diltiazem alone (60). 
The remaining study compared psychosocial functioning, including anxiety, between 
patients undergoing either medical or surgical management of ACS (79).

Regarding efficacy, only one of the 12 intervention studies that were primarily 
pharmacological reported lower anxiety in the intervention group compared to controls (60). 
One study reported lower anxiety in the placebo group (77), and the remainder reported no 
differences between groups.

Relaxation interventions—Fourteen studies primarily involved relaxation therapies 
(Table 2), at times delivered as adjunct to exercise-based CR. Length of the interventions 
ranged from one week to 12 months; the median intervention length was six weeks.

The kinds of relaxation therapies were varied: two studies involved deep breathing 
interventions (44, 80); four examined autogenic training, alone (81, 82) or combined with 
cardiac coherence biofeedback (83) or EMG feedback (84); two used muscle relaxation 
therapy (85) (one also included guided imagery (86)); two used mindfulness-based 
interventions (64, 67); one used a music tape during aerobic exercise compared to similar 
exercise without music (87); one used guided imagery compared to a music tape during 
exercise (88); and one gave participants their choice of relaxation therapy (e.g., yoga, 
mindfulness) (89). Another study compared a group receiving progressive muscle relaxation 
instruction with another receiving mindfulness-based meditation instruction (57).

In terms of efficacy of the interventions that prominently featured relaxation, 6 resulted in a 
greater reduction in anxiety for the intervention group compared to a control group (44, 64, 
80-82, 85) and the remaining 8 studies reported a nonsignificant difference in anxiety 
between treatment groups.

Counseling and support interventions—Twenty-five interventions primarily involved 
counseling (Table 3). Intervention length ranged from 4 weeks to one year (median length 
10 weeks).

Interventions often involved multiple components of treatment; for example, behavioral 
counseling combined with listening to a relaxation tape (62). Ten interventions primarily 
involved forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (47, 48, 54, 55, 90-92). Two of these 
CBT-focused studies also provided stress management training (53, 93) and one included 
antidepressant medication (68); eight involved skills training such as problem-solving and 
self-management strategies (10, 36, 61, 62, 94-97); three studies provided social support or 
‘mentorship’ to patients (38, 98, 99), two provided psychotherapy (30, 100); and one 
involved future care planning and related counseling (65). One offered patients a choice 
between problem solving counseling, antidepressant therapy, or both (37).

Of the 25 studies categorized as counseling interventions, 9 were effective in decreasing 
anxiety in the intervention group compared to control (36, 47, 48, 53, 93, 96-99), while 16 
studies reported non-significant differences between groups.

Education and risk factor management interventions—Thirty-four interventions 
were primarily educational (Table 4). The length of the interventions ranged from 15 
minutes (a video-based intervention (101)) to one year (median length 7 weeks).

The educational topics varied between studies. Education sessions that focused on CHD 
awareness or risk factor/heart health and treatment were most common, with 25 overall 
studies applying this approach. Of these, seven were conducted in post-CABG/PCI patients 
(66, 102-107), ten for post-MI patients (58, 59, 108-115), five in patients with CHD or 
angina diagnosis (63, 116-120), one in patients with unstable angina (121) and two in 
patients with angina or acute MI (122, 123). Two studies used “frequently asked question” 
checklists prior to cardiology clinic visits (124, 125). Other interventions included four 
studies providing education prior to elective CABG on what to expect after surgery 
(126-129), one providing education in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provided to 
patients and family (69), and one providing a videotape on sexual functioning after MI 
(101).

Seventeen of the 34 primarily educational programs reported a greater reduction in anxiety 
for the intervention groups compared to controls (59, 63, 66, 69, 103, 105-110, 113, 120, 
124, 125, 127, 129). Of the remaining studies, two reported greater anxiety reductions in 
control groups compared to intervention groups (101, 116), and 10 reported no significant 
differences between intervention groups and controls.

Alternative therapies—Thirty-four interventions were considered ‘alternative therapies.’ 
Thirty-one involved physical exercise, and three involved omega-3 or herbal therapy. Length 
of the interventions ranged from 4 weeks to 2 years (median length 2 months).

Exercise interventions: Eleven studies compared an exercise program to usual care (with 
no exercise) (130-139) including one that compared a yoga-based regimen to a no-exercise

control (140). Six studies compared an exercise intervention paired with education or 
counseling, to a control group with usual care (receiving neither exercise training nor 
education/counseling) (50, 51, 141-144). Seven studies compared types of exercise: yoga 
compared to physiotherapy-based cardiac rehabilitation (145), an outdoor walking program 
compared to indoor cycling (39), low- compared to high-intensity exercise regimens (146, 
147), supervised hospital-based CR compared to unsupervised home-based CR (32), and 
routine CR compared to an expanded program (148, 149). Center-based or hospital-based 
CR was compared to home-based CR in two studies (150, 151). One study compared two 
CR programs of different length (152). Another compared exercise to dietary changes (153). 
Finally, two studies compared exercise to counseling (42, 49) and one compared exercise to 
cardiac education (154).

Supplemental interventions: Two additional alternative therapy trials examined fatty acids 
compared to placebo (41) or omega 3 compared to placebo as an augmentation to the 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), sertraline (40). Another study compared 
Xinkeshu tablets (a traditional Eastern supplement comprised of salvia miltiorrhiza, pseudo-
ginseng, radix puerariae, radices saussureae, and hawthorn) (56) along with traditional 
Western medicine (aspirin, beta-blocker, and a “lipid blocker,” most often a statin), to 
Western medicine alone.

Regarding study efficacy, of the 34 interventions that involved physical exercise, 10 resulted 
in a greater reduction in anxiety in the intervention group compared to the control group (32, 
39, 41, 49, 50, 56, 137, 139, 141, 143), while 24 reported no differences between exercise 
and control groups.

Quality of Studies

Study quality was highly variable. Twelve studies received a quality rating of “5” 
(Excellent), 18 received a rating of “4” (Good), 57 received a rating of “3” (Fair), and 32 a 
rating of “2” (Poor). Two of the 12 studies rated “excellent” (17%) resulted in a greater 
decrease in anxiety for the intervention group (110, 155) as did six of the 18 studies rated 
“good” (33%) (36, 53, 103, 108-110).

In aggregate, twenty-eight studies controlled for non-study interventions, 45 specifically 
mentioned that the outcome assessors were blinded to treatment group, 41 mentioned using 
an intention-to-treat analysis, and 88 included a CONSORT diagram or a detailed 
description of attrition.

Results of interventions targeting patients with anxiety

Only four of the 119 studies (3%) specifically targeted patients with an anxiety disorder or 
elevated anxiety symptoms. Of those, one RCT was effective in reducing anxiety for the 
intervention group compared to controls. This study (39) examined walking versus cycling 
in patients with anxiety specific to exercise, and found exercise-related anxiety in the 
walking group decreased more than in the cycling group. In contrast, three studies showed 
minimal benefit: In a 6-month, group therapy intervention for patients scoring >7 on the 
HADS Anxiety subscale, Merswolken et al. (30) reported a non-significant reduction in

anxiety for CHD or post-MI patients compared to controls receiving usual care. In two 
separate studies, apparently of the same sample (31, 43), Wheatley and colleagues reported 
that nightly clorazepate for patients with a “sufficient level of anxiety” resulted in no 
differences in anxiety compared to placebo controls after three months of treatment.

In addition to the above, 9 studies targeted patients with either anxiety or depression. Of 
these, 7 reported decreased anxiety in the intervention groups compared to controls. 
Bambauer et al. (52) provided 6 sessions of weekly telephone counseling addressing 
cardiac-related fears and reported greater reductions in anxiety for the intervention group to 
a control group who received a booklet on coping with chronic illness. McLaughlin et al. 
(48) reported that an 8-week intervention involving telephone-based CBT, addressing 
common illness-related fears for patients with elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms, 
resulted in lower anxiety scores compared to a control group who received a booklet on 
coping with illness. Lv et al. (47) examined the effects of a 6-session CBT-based 
intervention aimed at modifying irrational beliefs about illness in patients with diagnosed 
anxiety and/or depression; compared to controls receiving no therapy, the intervention group 
experienced a greater decrease in anxiety. Freeman et al. examined the effects of 30 days of 
treatment with alprazolam compared to placebo in post-CABG patients with anxiety and/or 
depressive symptoms and reported greater decreases in anxiety for the intervention group 
(45). Stern (49) compared a 12-week group counseling intervention to a 12-week exercise 
program for participants who were anxious, depressed, or who ‘had a mean workload less 
than 7 metabolic equivalents (METS) on a treadmill test.’ The exercise group had greater 
reductions in anxiety compared to controls receiving ‘routine care’ at 3 months, the group 
counseling intervention group had a greater reduction in anxiety compared to controls at 6 
months, and there were no between-group differences at 1 year. In another CR study, 
Oldridge et al. compared weekly exercise for 8 weeks to a usual care control group, and 
anxiety improved for patients in the intervention group with elevated anxiety scores at 
baseline compared to controls (51). D'Silva et al. compared a 2-week deep breathing 
intervention to a usual care control group for patients with anxious or depressive symptoms, 
and reported that anxiety scores were lower in the experimental group (44).

Two studies showed group differences in anxiety after treatment. Oldridge et al. performed 
an 8-week exercise intervention combined with group CBT (50) in patients who had anxiety 
or depressive symptoms; anxiety decreased similarly over time for both the CBT 
intervention group and the control group receiving exercise without therapy. Huffman et al. 
(46, 68) examined the effects of a telephone counseling intervention delivered by a social 
work case manager performing CBT as well providing SSRI medication compared to a 
control group receiving ‘enhanced usual care,’ in patients with diagnosed MDD, GAD, or 
Panic Disorder, and there were no group differences in anxiety scores after the intervention.

Discussion

In the present review, we aimed to provide a broad, comprehensive review of all studies of 
patients with CHD that assessed anxiety before and after any intervention. Out of literally 
thousands of publications initially identified by our search, only 119 studies met criteria for 
detailed review. Although treatment-related changes in anxiety in patients with CHD were

reported, only a minority of the studies specifically targeted patients with anxiety disorders 
or elevated anxiety symptoms. Most studies measured anxiety as a secondary outcome, with 
other outcomes (e.g., depression, quality of life, CHD events) typically serving as the 
primary outcome. The paucity of treatment studies specifically targeting patients with 
anxiety is surprising, especially in light of the relatively large number of studies targeting 
depression (24-29). Moreover, in those studies that measured anxiety, methodology and 
quality varied, and only one-third of studies actually reported a benefit in reducing anxiety in 
the respective intervention groups compared to controls.

The inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of the interventions can be attributed to a number 
of factors. The kinds of interventions were highly varied, ranging from traditional CBT to 
exercise therapy. Moreover, even within treatment classes, the actual interventions were 
highly variable. For example, the interventions subsumed under the category of ‘relaxation’ 
therapies included progressive muscle relaxation training, biofeedback, meditation, and 
autogenic training. In the pharmacological studies, treatments were given for varying time 
periods and at different doses. Additionally, the measures used for anxiety varied between 
studies, which makes comparison difficult. Clearly, there is no one universally accepted 
treatment for anxiety, and even studies of medications designed specifically to reduce 
anxiety yielded inconsistent results. It may be useful for future research to focus on one or 
two well validated instruments. Our review found that the STAI and HADS scales were 
utilized most often in the CHD population, and it may be beneficial for future studies utilize 
these instruments to facilitate better comparison between studies.

Variations in study characteristics also undoubtedly contributed to some of the 
inconsistencies in findings. Interventions varied in length (from a 15-minute video to a 4-
year intervention) and intensity (meeting daily, weekly, or monthly). Follow-up was also 
variable between studies and the persistence of treatment benefits could not be determined. 
The majority of studies did not include any follow-up after the conclusion of the 
intervention, and studies with follow-up reported high numbers of patients lost to follow-up 
which may have served to bias results towards significance (156). Most importantly, the 
interventions for the majority of studies were not designed to reduce anxiety, as anxiety was 
rarely a primary endpoint. Studies designed to treat anxiety and targeting individuals with 
high anxiety could yield different results.

The quality of studies was also highly variable. The quality of the majority of studies was 
only “fair,” with only 10 % of published studies considered “excellent.” Higher quality 
evidence is needed before any particular treatment can be called effective for CHD patients 
with anxiety. Additionally, of the interventions that were considered “excellent” quality, only 
2 (17%) were effective, which may suggest that better quality studies could show more 
modest benefit compared to those studies with weaker methodologies.

There was also a conspicuous lack of research in expected areas, and a focus on non-
traditional treatments for anxiety. For example, there was only one study in the 119 we 
reviewed that utilized SSRI medications as a primary intervention. This is particularly 
interesting given that there are a number of studies that research the effects of SSRIs on 
depression in CHD patients (24, 25, 37). It may be that similar research has not been

conducted in patients with anxiety because anxiety has received less attention as a risk factor 
in CHD until recently, and therefore receives less attention and funding for treatment. Recent 
research generally shows that anxiety has some prognostic significance (6, 10, 11), and 
research on the effects of the first line anxiety medications (SSRIs, SNRIs) on anxiety and 
heart disease in patients with both illnesses will be important in the future.

Although there have been several large, multi-center RCTs examining treatment of MDD in 
cardiac patients (24, 25) and one study that examined the effects of exercise on depressive 
symptoms in depressed patients with stable CHD (157), we identified only four studies 
targeted patients with high anxiety and none with a diagnosed anxiety disorder. Moreover, in 
the only study that showed an effective intervention, Faulkner et al, (39) focused only on 
narrow, exercise-specific anxiety, rather than generalized anxiety symptoms. Of the nine 
studies we identified that targeted patients with anxiety and/or depression, seven reported 
reduction in anxiety in their intervention group. These studies spanned intervention types, 
including an anxiolytic, multiple CBT studies, exercise therapy, and counseling. It is 
interesting that these studies reported improvements in anxiety at a much greater rate than 
studies of patients with anxiety alone, or studies targeting patients with neither. While 
further analysis is difficult given study heterogeneity and the limited number of existing 
articles, it will be interesting to see whether this trend continues for future studies 
investigating treatment of anxiety in CHD patients with mood or anxiety disorders, 
compared to patients with anxiety disorders alone.

Additionally, although the literature includes a number of RCTs treating depression in CHD 
patients (24-28), there have been few RCTs targeting anxiety, and to our knowledge, no 
multi-site RCTs. Depression has received more attention as a prognostic factor in CHD 
compared to anxiety which may explain the paucity of research treating anxiety in patients 
with CHD. Additionally, aspects of anxiety may make it more difficult to study in CHD 
patients. Unlike many depression studies that focus on MDD (or in some cases elevated 
depressive symptoms), anxiety disorders are more heterogeneous (e.g., panic disorder, GAD, 
phobia, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, etc.), and different disorders may not have the 
same prognostic value and may respond differently to treatment (158). Interestingly, in the 
articles we found for review, only generalized and health-related anxiety were assessed, 
leaving the effects of treatment of other forms of anxiety (phobia, etc.) unknown. Anxiety 
disorders and CHD also may be more difficult to differentiate as they share comorbid 
symptoms; for example, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest pain are symptomatic of 
both panic disorder and angina (17). Additionally, existing treatments for heart disease may 
be a source of anxiety-like symptoms, such as digoxin toxicity causing palpitations and 
panic attack-like symptoms. There is also a possibility that during an acute event, patients 
experience anxiety related to the event which resolves on its own with treatment of the event 
independent of treatment, mitigating the effects of any treatment for anxiety in particular.

Limitations

Because we searched for mentions of anxiety only in abstracts, our search may have missed 
some studies that only reported anxiety-related results in the body of the article. However, 
we also manually searched existing meta-analyses and reviews in order to identify as many

Conclusion

additional studies as possible. Thus, we are confident that we included all relevant studies 
reporting the effects treatments on anxiety in CHD patients. We also recognize that 
interventions that were ineffective are less likely to be published, and anxiety may have been 
measured but not reported as a result if a study resulted in a null finding. Importantly, we 
included studies that not only measured anxiety as a primary outcome but also as a 
secondary outcome. The extent to which negligible effects of treatment of anxiety were due 
to its measurement as a secondary outcome cannot be determined. Finally, as there was 
significant between-study variation in intervention length, duration, and quality, intervention 
type, and control group conditions, a meta-analytical approach was not considered 
appropriate.

Heightened symptoms of anxiety are not uncommon among cardiac patients, and may also 
be associated with worse clinical CHD outcomes. Unfortunately, we identified relatively few 
intervention studies designed specifically to reduce anxiety in CHD patients, and results of 
the effectiveness of treatment have been mixed. Because of the paucity of research in this 
area, it is not clear what interventions are most effective in treating anxiety in CHD patients. 
Many published studies were conducted in non-anxious CHD samples. The lack of benefit 
reported in many studies could be the result of ineffective treatments or may be due to a 
potential floor effect in which patients had low anxiety to begin with. Moreover, the few 
existing interventions targeting anxiety focused on elevated symptoms or GAD, so 
interventions for treating patients with other anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or 
phobias are understudied (6). Because studies used a variety of different instruments for 
assessing anxiety, comparisons between studies are difficult. Selecting common instruments 
to measure anxiety may facilitate comparison of treatment efficacy across studies. Finally, 
unlike studies of depression in CHD patients, to our knowledge, no study has examined the 
effects of treating anxiety on clinical outcomes. It is important for clinicians to know the 
effects of anxiety treatment on clinically relevant outcomes such as symptom burden, 
utilization of healthcare services, and further acute cardiac events and death. Such research 
will help in determining the added value of treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD at risk 
for adverse cardiac events.
