Abstract: Contemporary performance and accessibility are features that enable mobile devices to
be increasingly beneﬁcial in the context of optimizing the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Smart-
phones have the potential to effectively support psychotherapeutic interventions among adolescents
and young adults who require them. In the present study, the use and subjective inﬂuence of a
smartphone app with content from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was investigated among transi-
tional age youth (TAY) with borderline personality disorder, focusing on suicidality and non-suicidal
self-injury (NSSI), in a natural setting. A longitudinal qualitative approach was used by means of
individual semi-structured interviews, where participants were asked about their experiences and
associated emotions before and after a testing period of 30 days. A total of 13 TAY with a diagnosed
borderline personality disorder between the ages of 18 and 23 were included. Six overarching themes
were identiﬁed through qualitative text analysis: (1) experiences with DBT skills, (2) phenomenon
of self-harm, (3) feelings connected with self-harm, (4) dealing with disorder-speciﬁc symptoms,
(5) prevention of self-harm, and (6) attitude toward skills apps. In general, the provision of an app
with DBT content achieved a positive response among participants. Despite a small change in the
perception of suicidality and NSSI, participants could imagine its beneﬁts by integrating their use of
the app as a supportive measure for personal psychotherapy sessions.

1. Introduction

Personality disorders are characterized by severe disturbances of the personality and
dysfunctional behavioral tendencies without a biological or psychological basis [1]. In
the case of emotionally unstable personality disorders, as deﬁned by the International
Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10),
there is a marked tendency for the individual to act out impulses without considering the
accompanying consequences, often with emotional instability and low impulse control.
This manifestation of personality disorder is separated into two subtypes: the impulsive
type, and the borderline type. Characteristics of the borderline type include disturbances
in one’s self-image, goals, and inner preferences, with chronic feelings of inner emptiness,
making volatile social contacts, and having a tendency toward self-destructive behavior in
the form of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts [1,2]. Persons diagnosed

with borderline personality disorder (BPD) commit an average of three suicide attempts
over their lifetime [3]. Epidemiological research suggests a prevalence of BPD in the overall
juvenile population of approximately 3% [4]. The clinical prevalence of the disorder ranges
from 11% of adolescents in outpatient clinics to 78% of severely suicidal adolescents in
emergency departments. However, it should be noted that there is a potential diagnostic
bias, which does not rule out an equal frequency distribution [5]. NSSI mostly takes the
form of superﬁcial cuts to the wrists and arms with non-suicidal intent, but is based on
the emotion-regulatory problems of the affected person. In this context, NSSI is an action
which is executed in an addictive way to reduce painful internal states [6]. Apart from BPD,
suicidal ideation is also a vast problem in the general global population of adolescents
and young adults. Based on the life-threatening character and high prevalence of suicidal
ideation and behaviors, they should be considered a high public health priority [7]. On a
global basis, estimates for suicides that occurred in the age group of 10- to 29-year-olds
exceeded 150,000 cases in 2019 [8]. Despite various efforts to reduce suicides through pre-
ventive initiatives over the past several years, they continue to be the fourth leading cause
of death in people aged 15 to 29 years, after road injury, tuberculosis, and interpersonal
violence. Suicide rates have increased dramatically in several countries and regions in
recent years and show a high probability of a long-lasting upward trend due to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic as well as economic recession [9–12].

One option for psychotherapeutic treatment of individuals with BPD is the concept
of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) developed by Marsha M. Linehan [13]. DBT is a
comprehensively researched form of psychosocial treatment whose effectiveness in the
care of individuals with BPD and associated problems has been previously veriﬁed as
shown in a systematic review [14]. The majority of this research speciﬁcally reviewed
BPD with suicidal behavior as the primary outcome [15]. DBT is a profound, multimodal
treatment that supports chronically suicidal persons with BPD-speciﬁc deﬁcits in emotional
self-regulation and distress tolerance skills. This treatment is accomplished through a
motivational model that aims to help affected individuals to overcome these deﬁcits [16].
This model also assumes that personal and environmental factors often inhibit the use of
innate behavioral skills present in persons with BPD. The importance of skills practice in
DBT has already been established in empirical studies [17,18].

As a result of continuous development and improvement in accessibility to technolog-
ical aids such as the internet and mobile applications (apps), studies were carried out to
determine the effectiveness of their use in psychotherapeutic interventions. In particular,
these technologies were examined with respect to their complementary and optimizing
features when used in addition to personal therapy [19]. The use of smartphone-based
interventions can have certain beneﬁts in the therapeutic process. These include facilitating
access to evidence-based treatment, increasing the effectiveness of psychotherapy, reduc-
ing stigma associated with psychotherapy, empowering users to explore content at their
own pace, promoting user autonomy, and integrating ﬂexible mental health interventions
into everyday life without local or temporal constraints [20–22]. In terms of effectiveness,
user willingness was identiﬁed as a key component in the successful implementation of
a mobile app, regardless of the type of therapeutic intervention [23]. The integration of a
mobile app into DBT suits the goals and techniques of psychotherapy for individuals with
BPD [24]. However, the potential beneﬁts of smartphone utilization must also be weighed
against possible negative aspects, such as cyber-attacks and the illegal use of private data
saved within the app [25]. Moreover, high frequency of mobile phone use among young
adults is a potential risk factor for depressive symptomatology in both sexes and sleep
disturbances in men [26]. A lower frequency use of skills from the DBT model was found
to correlate with higher failure rates in therapy, while higher frequency use of these skills
was associated with less NSSI. By means of integrating an app into the therapy process,
appropriate therapeutic techniques can be made more accessible and the failure rate of
individuals in treatment can be diminished [27].

This study focused on a group of transitional age youth (TAY), deﬁned as a heteroge-
neous population between the ages of 15 and 26, namely individuals in their adolescence
to early adulthood. Transitional age is characterized by emotional instability, self-focus,
the absence of a sense of belonging, and sometimes a new sense of possibility and inde-
pendence. Therefore, TAY ﬁnd themselves in an intense period of self-exploration [28].
BPD gives rise to an intensiﬁcation of these transitional age difﬁculties, which need to be
counteracted by adequate measures in terms of harm reduction [29]. In order to properly
address this issue, researchers developed an adaptation of DBT focusing on TAY [30]. The
dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) is speciﬁcally aimed at the age group
of adolescents and young adults and focuses on the reduction of suicidal behaviors and
NSSI that occur particularly in the context of BPD [31].

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether using a mobile app
with DBT content for 30 days inﬂuenced the perception of suicidal ideation and NSSI in
TAY with BPD and how such an app could beneﬁt this target group.

2. Materials and Methods

As the aim of this study was to map the perspectives of TAY with BPD through the
use of a mobile app, a qualitative research approach was found to be most appropriate.
This decision was especially based on the researchers’ intention of capturing the subjective
experiences of participants during a period of app utilization, and exploring how its use
inﬂuenced their daily life. The everyday experiences of participants as related to suicidal
ideation and NSSI were of particular interest. In order to capture these as effectively as
possible, the research process took place in the natural setting of participants.

2.1. Participants

Using convenience sampling, a total of 13 participants (12 women, 1 man) aged 18 to
23 years with diagnosed BPD were included in the study. The mean age was 20.1 years
(SD 1.6). The sample consisted of former patients from a transitional psychiatric ward at
the hospital of Hietzing in Vienna, Austria. Potential participants were selected according
to the diagnosis in their clinical record and subsequently contacted by the principal investi-
gator. In order to ensure a sufﬁcient number of participants, snowball sampling and chain
sampling were additionally used for recruitment.

The inclusion criteria were TAY between 18 and 25 years, sufﬁcient understanding of
the German language, a diagnosed BPD according to ICD-10, as well as experiencing NSSI
or suicidal behavior in the past twelve months starting from the time of the ﬁrst interview.
Individuals were excluded if they experienced cognitive deﬁcits, primary psychotic disor-
ders, medically supervised drug withdrawal treatment, or a life-threatening eating disorder
resulting in a BMI below 14.5. Eligibility criteria were assessed verbally in the course of
the ﬁrst contact with participants, and based on information provided by the hospital
database. While language skills, self-harming behavior, state of drug withdrawal, and BMI
were inquired about when potential participants were approached, data regarding age,
diagnoses, and cognitive skills were available in the database. Participants were excluded
if they needed inpatient treatment during the time of the study. Only participants who
ﬁnished both interviews were included in the analysis.

2.2. Mobile App

The smartphone app used for the study was the mobile version of TalentLMS from
the developer Epignosis. TalentLMS is a cloud-based platform for knowledge and learning
management that allows knowledge transfer on a low-threshold basis by establishing easy
access to speciﬁc content for users, enabling the individual creation of courses. TalentLMS
provided an appropriate framework for a preferably simple implementation of the concept
that was intended to be investigated, namely the offering of DBT-based content for TAY
with BPD on a mobile device. In terms of the study, individual courses were created for
each skills module within the German version of the DBT-A therapist manual of interactive

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

4 of 21

skills training for adolescents with emotion regulation problems [30]. Since this manual
consists of modules, it was possible to directly insert its content into the mobile app without
further adaptations. For the implementation of this content, prior permission was obtained
from the publisher holding the rights to the skills manual.

The app functioned purely as a source of information and did not offer the possibility to
make entries. The initial stage involved browsing through the courses in a predeﬁned order
(Appendix A Figure A1). Thereafter, each individual course could be viewed separately
according to individual preference. Users were then able to explore its content at their
own discretion.

Once a course was selected and opened, a new selection had to be made between the
three tabs “Content”, “Rules”, and “Files”, although the “Rules” tab was not relevant. By
default, the “Content” tab was selected (Appendix A Figure A2). This was also the main
tab with information on speciﬁc skills. For each course, there was a short description of the
content and goals of the respective module. Users could download worksheets for speciﬁc
skills when they clicked onto the “Files” tab (Appendix A Figure A3).

In addition to the main tab “Courses”, there were also the “Search”, “News”, “Dis-
cussions”, and “Proﬁle” tabs, which fulﬁlled various functions. Users were able to search
for certain courses, course units, and course ﬁles. A course unit provided information for
users about a basic theme of DBT-A, which comprised general theme descriptions and
related exercises. Moreover, it was possible to post topics on a message board and to get
directly in touch with the research team. Beyond that, it was possible to view one’s personal
proﬁle under the “Proﬁle” tab. This allowed for checking one’s progress and scores in the
respective courses for which users earned points and achievements upon completion.

The process of rolling out the app for participants was bound to the standards of
TalentLMS, which provided its technical framework. After participants had submitted
their informed consent, corresponding proﬁles were created in the course and the users
were enrolled. Participants were informed about the exact test period and had access to
the course content for 30 days from the beginning of May 2021. In addition to a verbal
notiﬁcation about the start of this test phase, participants were also informed by e-mail
about the activation of the courses. Furthermore, they were instructed on how to get started
with the system during an educational interview with the principal investigator, and open
questions were clariﬁed. The handling of the app was explained in a special in-app tutorial
course where users were informed about the proper use of the application and the functions
implemented in it. During the test period, users were not bound to any speciﬁcations or
schemes regarding the use of the app.

2.3. Data Collection

Participants were asked about their experiences with suicidality and NSSI as well
as their experiences with DBT skills and apps through two semi-structured in-depth
interviews per participant. The separate interviews on two different dates enabled us to
capture a change in perspective over time, which was achievable using the longitudinal
qualitative research approach. This approach provides the possibility to capture experiences
of individuals and groups in a more holistic way and allows for in-depth comprehension
beyond a cross-sectional point in time [32,33]. A total of 26 interviews were conducted,
where 13 participants were interviewed both before and after a 30-day app trial period
using separate interview guides. As there was no new information gathered by the time
the responses of 13 participants were reviewed, data saturation was accomplished in the
course of the ﬁrst interview phase, which is why recruitment was stopped at that point. The
conversations lasted between 30 and 45 min and were subsequently transcribed verbatim.
Appendix A Figure A4 visualizes the executed procedure of the study.

Originally, data triangulation was selected as a quality assurance strategy in order to
eliminate systematic bias, and generate maximum theoretical insight. With this in mind,
both data collections were planned to take place at different locations. The aim of local
triangulation is to eliminate thought associations between the interview partners, and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

is therefore conducted to counteract unconsciously distorted statements [34]. However,
due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the study, the interviews took
place online via the Zoom videoconferencing software. The software simultaneously
enabled interference-free recording of the interviews and subsequently converted the video
recordings into an audio format. A signiﬁcant advantage of conducting data collection via
Zoom was the individual option for participants to turn off the camera during the interview.
During the interviews, participants expressed a high level of satisfaction with this option
and informed the interviewer that they might not have agreed to a face-to-face meeting.

2.4. Interview Guidelines

The interviews primarily focused on participants’ thoughts and feelings regarding
suicidality and NSSI. In total, two different guidelines were created, one for the ﬁrst series
of interviews and another one for the second series. The second guide was a slightly
modiﬁed form of the ﬁrst version as it contained questions that would have been irrelevant
if repeated. The guiding principle used during the modiﬁcation of the ﬁrst interview
guide was the comparability of the results at a later stage. The two guides designed in
the course of the study were based on six relevant topics from the Self-Injurious Thoughts
and Behaviors Interview (SITBI). The SITBI is a standardized interview with proven high
reliability and validity [35]. The themes on which the semi-structured interview guides
were based were suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, and
NSSI. The second semi-structured interview guide was strongly oriented to the ﬁrst guide.
It was partially supplemented or replaced by new questions. Since the two interview
series covered sensitive topics, maintaining a high level of safety for the study participants
was top priority. In view of this circumstance, the interviewer had to minimize the risk
by constantly appraising the interview situation, and by responding with empathy to
the emotions and affects that arose during the course of the interviews. If necessary, the
interviewees had the option of changing the topic or ending the interview altogether at any
time. Based on the experience of the principal investigator in the ﬁeld of psychiatry and
psychotherapy, sensitive situations could be adequately evaluated, and the conduct of the
interview thus adapted accordingly. For example, if some participants felt distressed when
asked about suicidal ideation and NSSI, questions were rephrased or skipped.

2.5. Ethical Considerations

Informed consent was obtained in written and verbal form from participants prior
to the ﬁrst interview session. In order to be able to correctly assign the collected data,
participants were pseudonymized. Pseudonymization was carried out by coding names
with consecutive numbers, whereby only the study authors were able to draw conclusions
about the corresponding persons on the basis of these codes. The analyzed data were
tagged with these codes and stored on a private PC with secured access. In case information
that allowed third parties to draw conclusions was revealed, this content was selectively
blacked out, alienated, or generalized without altering its meaning. Audio ﬁles were fully
deleted after ﬁnalizing the verbatim transcription. This study was approved by the ethics
commission of the University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna (EKNr: 6/2021).

2.6. Data Analysis

The interviews were manually transcribed and analyzed using thematic qualitative
text analysis (TQTA) according to Kuckartz [36]. TQTA features a multilevel process of
categorizing and coding, where at ﬁrst the data is coded according to major categories
derived from the general guidelines used in data collection. Subsequently, these categories
are enhanced and differentiated before the dataset is coded again. By means of this
constant process of comparing and contrasting, the consecutive category-based analysis
gains reﬁnement and explanatory power. Based on the underlying research objective, a
deductive category system comprising eight main categories was created. The collected
interview material was then coded by assigning text sequences to corresponding categories

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

6 of 21

while the initial category system was inductively adapted, giving rise to six main categories
(Table 1). In the context of TQTA, this is referred to as deductive–inductive coding. For
the analysis of the follow-up interviews, the ﬁnal category system was used for coding.
Subsequently, an analysis of the content within the sub- and further subcategories resulted
in a descriptive comparison between both interview sessions. This deductive–inductive
approach is consistent with a recommendation for the analysis of longitudinal qualitative
research [32]. Both the transcription and coding process were conducted with the software
MAXQDA 2020.

3. Results
3.1. Experiences with DBT Skills

The results revealed that participants expressed both positive and negative experiences
with DBT skills. Each participant had previous experiences with DBT and DBT-A, primarily
due to hospital stays and psychotherapy, and their information on DBT skills was limited
to two different sources, namely healthcare institutions and online platforms. While most
respondents pointed out they were usually taught new DBT skills by healthcare institutions,
especially in hospital psychiatric wards, some participants stated they needed alternative
ways of reducing tension. These participants reported various ways of seeking relevant
information about DBT skills, mainly through online platforms and self-help forums.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

7 of 21

However, most of these participants conveyed their frustration that many suggestions for
self-help were not inspiring enough or unhelpful in dealing with their symptoms.

Several interviewees said they had been taught a list of skills during their inpatient
stays. However, they felt that there were no differences in the kind of skills provided by
the healthcare institution between the ﬁrst and second data collection periods before and
after the app testing phase. In fact, those interviewed felt that the lists of skills provided by
the healthcare institutions were not necessarily useful for them:

I was given a multi-page list printed out in the hospital of activities to do when you
are very tense to get you down. I still have that list, even though I ﬁnd that it does not
necessarily have the most useful things, well, for me personally just not the most useful
things, on it. So, not things that I can then apply. Then there are also, for example, things
like ironing on it or so. Things like that. Yes, that maybe relieves a bit of tension, but you
do not always have that available.

(Female, Age 22)

Nevertheless, acquiring DBT skills in general was a positive experience for participants.
One participant emphasized that “simply the fact to know many skills means to have a certain
safety net to fall back on” (female, age 20). After the app testing phase, participants continued
to experience mixed views of the resources available to them. Some of them stated that
they already knew enough DBT skills and hence did not see the need to acquire new ones.
One participant reported having obtained insufﬁcient skills-support during her inpatient
stays at various facilities, which gave her the feeling of receiving inadequate treatment.
Although respondents generally accepted and recognized the functionality of DBT skills,
they felt that this functionality was linked to certain prior conditions that needed to be met
in order to make use of the skills.

Respondents were consistently eager to learn new methods of reducing tension and
explicitly wanted to know better ways of dealing with this than to incur self-injury. Despite
a certain repertoire of techniques that many participants had already acquired before testing
the app, there was a general feeling of inadequacy when it came to applying these skills
when they were most needed:

I don’t feel like I already know enough skills and I should seriously work on that now, but
I am hindered by the distraction, a certain indifference that sometimes appears.

(Female, Age 21)

3.2. Phenomenon of Self-Harm

Participants described their experiences of self-harm in terms of behaviors associated
with NSSI. Compared to the ﬁrst interviews, NSSI was slightly less frequent during the
follow-up. Participants had difﬁculties in estimating the frequency of NSSI, and attributed
this to situational memory lapses or their uncertainty of the deﬁnition of self-harming. The
methods of self-harm used by respondents in terms of NSSI differed from one another
and were strongly inﬂuenced by their own individual characteristics. Most respondents
mentioned that before the ﬁrst interview took place they had experienced self-inﬂicted
scratches, superﬁcial cuts or stabs with broken glass or knives, broken bones, burns from
cigarettes, and hitting their own body, objects or walls over a period of time. However,
when the second interview was conducted, most respondents reported having reduced
acute NSSI. Further, most participants did not experience severe incidents during the app
testing phase, as they continued to refrain from acutely harming themselves. Nevertheless,
some participants expressed other kinds of self-harm in the form of excessive food intake
due to craving, and scratching their skin due to high stress levels.

Some of the interviewed persons stated that they suffered constant self-destructive
thoughts that varied in intensity depending on the situation or occasion. In particular, they
frequently experienced negative thought circles or volatile ﬂuctuations in self-destructive
thinking. Consequently, respondents’ perspectives on self-destructive thoughts did not
undergo recognizable changes during the course of the study:

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

8 of 21

I think that it can change very quickly. Well, not in general, but if something should
happen that makes me feel really bad again, then it can ﬂuctuate again very quickly. So I
think that would be possible.

(Female, Age 19)

The risk factors and triggers that were reported to have led to self-injury were intrap-
ersonal, interpersonal, or situational. In terms of intrapersonal risk factors, poor self-worth
and self-hatred were recurring themes. One participant stated that the shorter the time
interval between incidents of NSSI, the more likely NSSI was going to happen. Self-injury
was mentioned by some respondents as a measure against incipient or existing dissocia-
tions, and said it helped them to stay focused. In fact, several participants referred to NSSI
as a pastime. As it turned out, the issue of intrapersonal factors was less addressed during
the second data collection. If so, difﬁculties in this regard were mentioned in connection
with drug addiction, ﬂashbacks, and thought circles.

In conjunction with self-harm, high subjective importance was attributed to interper-
sonal relationships and contacts. Participants speciﬁcally referred to relationships with
family members, meetings with friends, or exposure to the public as risk factors. Some of
the interviewees recounted occasional self-inﬂicted violence to gain attention from their
social environment. During the second interview, only a few respondents commented
on interpersonal factors being potential causes of NSSI. However, these problems were
consistent with the statements made during the ﬁrst interview session.

In addition to intrapersonal and interpersonal processes, situational inﬂuences were
also mentioned as a risk-related factor. Participants reported the use of transport and per-
sonal triggers as most stressful. Some participants, particularly in the follow-up interviews,
stated that they experienced stress at school and generally felt more unstable due to that:

Partly, it is simply certain situations. often situations that remind me of some kind of
trauma. ( . . . ) Situations that trigger my fear of loss are usually a big deal for me.

(Female, Age 19)

3.3. Feelings Related to Self-Harm

The feelings related to self-harm that were experienced by interviewees were complex,
as they expressed both positive and negative attitudes toward self-injury. Participants
compared the effect of NSSI with the intake of psychotropic substances and drew similarities
between them. They emphasized the euphoric effects and addictive potential in both. Some
of the interviewees spoke of a feeling of relief in connection with self-destructive actions,
after a NSSI:

It is like when you are in a room that has not been aired out in years, and then you open
the window and take a really deep breath.

(Female, Age 21)

Although some respondents reported that NSSI was better than any medication, they
also claimed that the self-injury was associated with insecurities, and that this needed
attention. One participant frequently emphasized her gratitude for having been through
the experience of NSSI, as she managed to stop inﬂicting self-harm and was thrilled to
be a role model to support other people with self-harming issues in the future. However,
during the follow-up interviews, most participants did not claim that their attitude toward
self-injury changed. In fact, one person described self-injury as a communicating mediator
between the inner emotional world and the social environment.

On the whole, participants were able to provide concise descriptions of their emotions
toward NSSI and suicidal behavior. They mentioned self-hatred, disappointment, anger,
sadness, guilt, shame, despair, fear, shock, aggression, tension, craving, doubt, effort,
emptiness, and loneliness to describe their emotional experiences with this issue. The
interviewees’ perception of this did not change during the follow-up interview, although
NSSI was less important compared to the ﬁrst interview. Besides relating experiences

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

9 of 21

of positively and negatively valenced emotions, some participants also felt emotional
indifference toward self-injury and suicidality, and spoke of feelings of apathy or lethargy
in this regard:

During the self-injury, I think there is not much going on emotionally, because then the
focus of attention is simply on the action and there is not much room for anything else.

(Female, Age 22)

Respondents reported individual ways of dealing with scars, which originated from
past self-injuries. One participant explained that visible scars were not a problem since they
could be tattooed over. Other interviewed persons also mentioned using certain clothing
as a way of hiding scars, and claimed that they only injured themselves on body parts
that were usually not visible to others. During the second interview, several respondents
reported feeling a certain emotional distance from self-destructive behaviors and thoughts.
However, none of them were able to give any particular reason for this.

3.4. Dealing with Disorder-Speciﬁc Symptoms

In terms of dealing with disorder-speciﬁc symptoms, individuals included in the
study had their own perspectives on the selection of DBT skills that were recommended.
Participants generally identiﬁed positive DBT skills as those that could be used universally
as well as in different situations. They also explained that the stimulus intensity of a skill
must be adapted to the severity of their distress, in order for it to be effective. Nonetheless,
respondents reported that both active and passive variants of DBT skills can be effective,
depending on the type of tension. During the interviews, participants emphasized that a
well-planned combination of several DBT skills can be an effective and sensible thing to do:

I do not think there is one good skill, but it is about combining skills as sensibly as possible.
The best skills do not help if you are not there for yourself a little bit afterwards.

(Female, Age 22)

Although the interviewees agreed that using physical and cognitive stimuli-based
skills were fundamental to counter high distress levels, they found these skills to be
only effective for them at low to moderate distress levels. Respondents explained that
extreme situations were only manageable with NSSI, taking acute medication, or using
skills chains. In addition, respondents emphasized that an important way of dealing
with their symptoms was to sensibly combine various skills. During both interviews,
participants mentioned the use of a variety of skills which addressed different physical
senses. These included gustatory, olfactory, thermal, kinesthetic, and cognitive stimuli.
According to some participants, physical activities with pets were also highly important
to them, and this was emphasized during the second interview session. They claimed
that relating and interacting with their pets was an essential therapeutic resource. Many
interviewees referred to mindfulness exercises based on DBT as an effective skill for
them. Nevertheless, during the follow-up, one person expressed a rather negative attitude
regarding mindfulness skills, stating that these could only be used under very speciﬁc
conditions and were therefore only effective to a limited extent.

Respondents additionally underscored physical exercise and sports as effective ways
of reducing tension, mainly through distraction, exhaustion, and physical exertion. Some
participants reported either listening to music or making music themselves. One individual
expressed a contrasting opinion on the effect of music, stating that it can both evoke positive
thoughts and intensify negatively valenced emotions. The respondent added that the state
of arousal as well as the trigger causing it were criteria for the effectiveness of music as
a defusing skill. During the second interview series, participants were less focused on
physical activities and music, but otherwise reported similar outcomes as they did in the
ﬁrst interview:

For a while, my therapist gave me chili peppers, so that whenever I simply noticed that I
was having bad thoughts, or that I was getting restless or something, I bit into the chili
pepper and that helped relatively well.

(Female, Age 18)

The interviewees mentioned that their social environment was an important facilitator
when dealing with their symptoms, and explained that this contributed to the development
of certain behaviors. They attributed their social environment to potentially inﬂuencing
them both positively and negatively, and highlighted that families and friends were main
factors in this structure:

First of all, I have my boyfriend as my main anchor, I would say. The thing is, I live with
him, so to speak, and he’s known me since the time when it was really bad and therefore
knows how he should deal with me in these situations, how he can bring me down.

(Female, Age 18)

Additionally, participants mentioned having contact with healthcare institutions or
psychotherapists as essential. In this regard, they described friendships from previous
hospitalizations as important relationships as these were based on emotional connections
and common experiences. Moreover, one respondent mentioned experiencing positive
attention from the opposite sex, which was a feeling that partly strengthened her self-worth.
Some participants reported using computer-based tools when feeling highly distressed.
Respondents stated that video games and music production were helpful in calming them
down when feeling highly distressed. A few respondents cited online chats and forums as
important resources, while others mentioned the use of mobile devices in general, as well
as certain apps as effective tools to combat NSSI and suicidal behavior.

Participants in general also described psychotropic substances as very effective in
terms of dealing with acute situations. Among these, they found nicotine, alcohol, and
cannabis to be most alleviating of their symptoms and hence consumed them frequently.
Further, respondents described the use of emergency medication as particularly effective
in relieving them of high distress, and referred to the primary use of benzodiazepines, a
group of drugs with anxiolytic and sedative effects, and low-potency antipsychotics, also
causing sedation. Respondents also made statements about their regular medication, where
antidepressants and antipsychotics were mentioned most frequently. Some participants
stated that they sometimes combined their prescribed medication with illegal drugs:

It is true that in the long run, marijuana aggravates depression or anxiety disorders. I
have even noticed that in myself. But in combination with the medication it works quite
well. Maybe I’m risking a bit much right now, but as long as it works, it’s good.

(Female, Age 21)

Participants referred to several limitations they were confronted with when they
wanted to use DBT skills. According to one person, a blindness to DBT skills arose during
high states of arousal, which made it impossible to apply them adequately. Another
interviewee said that the use of skills as a substitute for NSSI would be easier if she was not
at home, while another person commented that DBT skills felt more like an oppression than
an adequate compromise to avoid self-injury. Some respondents stated that suggestions
from healthcare professionals regarding general skills were often insufﬁcient, as skills
could only be effective if they were personalized. One person said that some skills only
had a stress-reducing effect when experiencing a certain level of tension, beyond which
the potential to inﬂict self-injuries was raised. Two participants agreed that during acute
situations, personal difﬁculties hindered them from asking for help, while two other
participants mentioned the environment as a possible limitation, as certain skills could not
be used in public places. With regards to this, respondents mentioned their unwillingness to
avoid self-injury, their inability to recall learned skills from memory in stressful situations,
their desire not to disturb the social environment and therefore not ask for help, and their
unwillingness to look for certain skill objects if they were not immediately available.

3.5. Prevention of Self-Harm

The majority of participants reported that the main reason they avoided NSSI was
to prevent long-term physical damage. For instance, respondents pointed out having
suppressed their compulsive NSSI tendencies many times in order to avoid creating visible
scars. During the second series of interviews, one interviewee commented on the fact that
the last self-injury occurred some time ago and that she had “realized that it just does not
do as much good as it used to, or that there are just different strategies now to avoid it and there
is no urge any more” (female, age 19). One person expressed that avoiding NSSI was part
of her self-responsibility, and found it essential for her personal development and growth.
Another participant disclosed that cutting was associated with effort, thus not suitable as a
short-term coping method:

So the cutting was just really exhausting, because it made a mess and the wounds did not
heal and then you had to kind of put bandages and something over it and it kept coming
open. I like to have things just for the moment and not deal with them afterwards and
that was just exhausting. Apart from destroying my skin.

(Female, Age 21)

As many participants stated, an essential inﬂuence on NSSI was social perception, and
that they did not want to disappoint closely related individuals. Moreover, people in their
social environment were considered as great resources for dealing with BPD symptoms.
Participants talked about experiencing shame when scars were visible from outside. During
the follow-up interviews, one person stated that she did not want strangers to have bad
impressions of her due to visible scars. Further, respondents said that regular contact with
a peer group helped them ﬁnd effective coping methods. Some interviewed persons also
reported that having a pet was a valuable resource to them, and that taking responsibility
for an animal contributed to them maintaining a better sense of self. In the course of the
second interview session, one interviewee vividly summarized the general view of persons
suffering from BPD on people in their social environment:

The motivations have remained the same as when we ﬁrst spoke. That this is something I
do not want to do to other people, because I know that it is not easy to have a contact with
a, as stupid as it sounds, “borderliner” or a self-harming person. That this is not nice for
other people, I know that. And accordingly, I do not want to do that to anyone around me.
That they worry about me and that they constantly worry and check if I have not done
anything or whatever. I just do not want that. So that has actually remained the same.

(Female, Age 22)

3.6. Attitude toward Skills Apps

In general, respondents had positive opinions about the use of mobile apps in terms
of emotion regulation. For instance, participants emphasized the permanent availability
of their mobile device, and the array of possibilities offered by the DBT skills content in
particular. Although attitudes toward a skills-providing app were generally positive, some
interviewees also expressed concerns about the functionality of the app and the potential
difﬁculties in providing help in an interpersonal way:

I do believe that in some cases an app can help really well with tension, but I actually
believe that it is difﬁcult to program an app in such a way or to make it so user-friendly
in a way that when you are in a high level of tension that you can actually experience the
app as helpful. ( . . . ) There can certainly be situations where an app is sufﬁcient. But I
think that the interpersonal aspect gets lost. For me, one of my best skills is talking to
someone.

(Female, Age 21)

While some persons could imagine browsing the contents of the app and trying out
unknown skills, some of them pointed out that the use of a mobile app could possibly
be more effective for acute emergencies than for long-term skills training. During the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

12 of 21

interviews after the 30-day app testing phase, the interviewees mentioned a variety of
points which they considered necessary for the proper functionality of a mobile app. For
example, these included uncomplicated usability, appealing content structure, modern
design, interesting descriptions, clarity, multimedia content, occasional app notiﬁcations,
explanations of DBT basics and skills training, integration of a collection of the most
important skills, choice option on types of skills, easy-to-understand information, integrated
mini-games, integration of gamiﬁcation elements, applicability in acute situations, the
mobile app as a companion to a real therapy or skills group, a chat function for group
members when used within a skills group, and the integration of skill chains that could be
worked through by users. One participant reported that the high information content of
the investigated app might be more suitable for an audience inexperienced with DBT since
more experienced persons might already be familiar with most of the content. Referring to
this, respondent suggested integrating an option to adapt the provided content based on
individual experience.

4. Discussion

The objective of this study was to investigate the attitudes of transitional age youth
(TAY) with borderline personality disorder (BPD) toward using a dialectical behavior
therapy (DBT)-based mobile app. Generally, participants showed a high level of acceptance
regarding the use of the investigated mobile app. Despite little change in perceptions of
suicidality and NSSI, respondents were able to envision the utility of the app, using it as a
supportive measure for in-person psychotherapy sessions. It should be pointed out in this
context that affected persons choose the type of self-inﬂicted violence according to their own
individual criteria, and that personal needs and compulsions are in the foreground [37]. For
a DBT skill to be fully effective, it is important that it produces a similar release of tension as
does the self-inﬂicted harm. For this reason, profound engagement with a variety of skills is
a fundamental component of DBT [38]. In this study, the smartphone app investigated was
hoped to be a promising complementary tool for in-depth personal engagement. However,
this effect did not occur during the 30-day testing period. Although participants reported a
certain recognition of the possibility of using the app as a permanently accessible source
of knowledge, the offer did not bring about any noticeable changes in the subjective view
of suicidality and NSSI. However, participants were receptive to the app as a tool for
acquiring knowledge. To a large extent, this could be related to a strong understanding
of the disorder that most participants had, and their active desire to change their general
life situation. People affected by BPD see themselves exposed to extreme psychological
strain, which is characteristic of the mental disorder [39]. For this reason, respondents
expressed a high interest in the app as a method for knowledge transfer as well as a high
willingness to learn new ways of dealing with issues related to the disorder. Nevertheless,
it must be mentioned at this point that the willingness to learn that was revealed within
the ﬁrst series of interviews mostly diverged from the actual effort carried out with regard
to the app use within the test phase. It should be noted that the willingness of app users
to engage in an app lies in how appealing it is to them [40,41]. In this context, the mobile
application offered too little stimulation to achieve an active engagement hampered by
the users’ dysfunctional behavior and associated mental processes. During the month
of testing a slight reduction of suicidal ideation and NSSI tendencies occurred, although
participants related this change to different extrinsic factors and not to the DBT app per se.
In comparison, other DBT apps were able to achieve more positive outcomes in individuals
with BPD [14,24]. However, these studies did not focus on TAY, but adults in general, which
is why this difference may be owed to the difference in impulse control, as adults with

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

14 of 21

BPD often show more control and stability [42]. This could be due to higher levels of life
experience and more time to learn the needed skills to cope among adults.

An essential point to consider with regard to suicidality and NSSI are the associated
risk factors and triggers [43]. As can be seen from the results, a breakdown of the general
risk factors and triggers into intrapersonal, interpersonal, and situational inﬂuences took
place within the study. It should, however, be noted that these inﬂuences interact with each
other on a continuum [44–46]. All factors that affect an individual are primarily processed
intrapersonally, and are hence independent of whether the triggering factors are of intrinsic
or extrinsic nature [47]. The majority of risk factors and triggers elicited after the app testing
phase were decidedly referred to as situational. In this context, it is important to mention
that the upcoming school leaving examinations and the high intensity of exams due to
the approaching end of school year signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced general well-being of some
participants. The occurrence of NSSI and suicidal ideation are particularly pronounced in
individuals with increased vulnerability to BPD. Stress has a high impact on this [39].

Maladaptive behavior patterns in interpersonal relationships are a typical symptom of
BPD. These relationships have a particularly inﬂuential role in triggering self-destructive
actions [48]. In the present study, this was seen to be the fundamental source of inciting NSSI
among participants. Interpersonal communication is highly recommended for TAY with
BPD and is characterized by immense complexity [49]. This complexity was also reﬂected
in the course of this study. From a subjective point of view, the interviewed persons
ascribed great importance to interpersonal contacts, although it should also be noted
that the degree of reﬂectivity of the selected participants was generally high. Within the
interviews, participants expressed an understanding of the relevance of external inﬂuences
by other persons and were able to articulate this accordingly. Speciﬁcally, participants
mentioned that they were highly emotionally inﬂuenced by external contacts and that this
susceptibility caused instability in their affect regulation. That there is an increased risk
for evoking NSSI in emotionally volatile relationships has been previously shown [50]. In
the course of the two interview series, no pronounced differences emerged with regard
to the intensity of interpersonal inﬂuence, implying that using the app did not result in
any changes in this aspect. However, it should be noted that under other circumstances,
interpersonal contacts could also have a positive inﬂuence and hence actively prevent self-
destructive behavior. This was highlighted by interviewees who expressed their aversion
to visible wounds and other aspects that related to affecting their social environment.
This aversion remained during the second data collection as well, hence representing an
essential factor in preventing dysfunctional behavior.

On the whole it should be noted that participants underwent a relatively limited
transformation of their subjective perception regarding NSSI and suicidality. With regard to
personal perception, participants showed indistinct changes after the intervention consider-
ing the aforementioned phenomena. Suicidal ideation and NSSI had already been issues
for the subjects for several years at the time of the study, possibly rendering the inﬂuence
of a 30-day app intervention to be negligible. Although a few respondents realized the
harmful impact of their dysfunctional behavior, the majority of participants expressed an
emotional indifference to this kind of behavior. This indifference or emotional passivity
may indicate a resignation among individuals affected by BPD that develops over time and
is likely associated with individual experiences.

4.1. Limitations and Strengths

This study incorporated several innovations in the ﬁeld of BPD research. Firstly,
it was conducted within the natural environment of the included persons. Secondly, a
DBT-based mobile app was investigated among a sample of transitional age youth living
with borderline personality disorder. Finally, the longitudinal qualitative design offered
the possibility to do in-depth interviews and assess participants’ opinions and emotions
during the course of the research. This approach allowed a holistic insight regarding the
impact of the intervention.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

15 of 21

The fact that some participants were in the preparation phase for their school leaving
examination during the app testing period could have been a limitation. This may have
resulted in only little attention being paid to the active testing of the application. In view
of this, it could also be assumed that the small amount of time spent using the app had a
substantial impact upon the data collected. Moreover, there was an imbalanced distribution
of gender, with 92.3% of participants being female. Additionally, the duration of the app
testing phase of 30 days may have been too short. This restriction resulted from the limited
time resources available for the implementation of this study. An extended testing period
could possibly yield different results. Moreover, a longer-term testing of the application is
required in order to do justice to a holistic approach. In connection to limitations concerning
the intervention, it should be noted that using the mobile app without strict guidelines
from the study management may have resulted in the software not being actively used.
A modiﬁed approach could bring about different results in this regard. Yet, the focus
was on promoting the autonomy of participants, which is why a predeﬁned schedule
would not have been target-aimed in terms of self-reliance. Finally, in the context of the
interview situation, there were several limitations and strengths due to the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic during the period of the study. The primary methodological consideration for
this research was based on data triangulation according to Flick, which was opted for as a
preventive measure against systematic bias [34]. In this methodology, the two interview
series would each have been scheduled at different locations. However, in order to comply
with pandemic-related contact restrictions, no face-to-face meetings with the subjects were
possible, and hence a web-based videoconferencing service was used. Conducting the
interviews in face-to-face meetings may have potentially led to different results.

However, it should be noted that having the interviews in an online format certainly
brought advantages that were highly valued by some interviewees. Participants felt that
the possibility of ending the interview at any time gave them a certain sense of safety,
which may have contributed to more open conversations. Further strengths of the study
were the familiarity between the principal investigator and most participants, as well as
their high willingness to contribute to the research.

4.2. Future Outlook

These insights gained should be used to further develop a DBT-speciﬁc mobile ap-
plication. Such an app should be expanded by the functions and elements addressed by
our participants, primarily by adding multimedia content, such as video, audio, and other
formats. Certiﬁcation of an app as a medical product would create the basis for the imple-
mentation of a variety of diverse features that could provide more in-depth experiences for
users. In concrete terms, this could allow for functions that require input from users, such
as a digital mood diary, to be embedded. Since a qualitative research approach was used in
this study, future studies with a quantitative orientation could contribute to a more holistic
understanding of the phenomena investigated. For instance, the correlation between the
occurrence of NSSI and time since the last NSSI could be considered as an objective for
additional quantitative research, allowing for a mixed-methods approach that could prove
promising for this purpose. The time since patients were discharged from the hospital and
their emotional stability when utilizing a DBT app may be a matter of interest for future
studies. Given that the focus of the study was the experience of having a companion app on
hand, no data on the frequency of the use of the app was gathered. Nevertheless, in order to
accurately examine the effects of the app as an intervention, further work should quantify
its use. For instance, use statistics may be captured, or subjects could be given speciﬁc
guidance on the time period, duration, and type of usage required. In this way, it would
be possible to derive optimal conditions of the app usage. On the other hand, it must be
considered that such a guideline could affect the motivational level of participants. Further
investigations should also be made on speciﬁc parameters such as having a longer testing
period and a more balanced gender distribution. In future studies, possible implications
for practice should also be explored. One way is to investigate how the DBT app could

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 701

16 of 21

function as a companion to personal therapy. For example, patients would be given the
opportunity to repeat and practice the content learned in individual or group therapy upon
individual request and at one’s individual pace. The therapeutic process could beneﬁt
considerably from this and have a motivating effect on the users.

5. Conclusions

In summary, it can be stated that the provision of an app that integrates dialectical
behavior therapy (DBT)-speciﬁc content has met with a positive response from the group
of transitional age youth (TAY) with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The patients
were willing to integrate such a system as a supportive measure in their everyday life, but
needed to tie this willingness to speciﬁc conditions related to the functional scope of the
application. Respondents preferred a smartphone app that focused on acute situations,
was easy and intuitive to use in an emergency, and at the same time provided concrete
instructions for action. With regards to its long-term use, respondents were not interested in
the sole dependence on autonomous software for smartphones, but preferred to use it as an
accompanying intervention to psychotherapy in an individual or group setting. It should,
however, be noted that the inﬂuence of the 30-day app testing period only marginally
reﬂected the views of respondents in terms of suicidality and NSSI. Furthermore, these
ﬁndings may only be useful to a limited extent for individuals between 15 and 26 years
with borderline personality disorder, since the sample size and gender imbalance in this
study does not allow for generalizations. Furthermore, this exploratory study did not aim
to investigate the effect of DBT. On the basis of the ﬁndings obtained, the integration of a
DBT app into the everyday life of TAY with BPD is possibly beneﬁcial to their subjective
feelings, but this effect has yet to be conﬁrmed through further research.
