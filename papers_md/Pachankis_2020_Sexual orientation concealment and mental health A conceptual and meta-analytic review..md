Abstract

Identity concealment affects all sexual minority individuals, with potentially complex mental 
health implications. Concealing a sexual minority identity can simultaneously generate the stress 
of hiding, protect against the stress of discrimination, and keep one apart from sexual minority 
communities and their norms and supports. Not surprisingly, existing studies of the association 
between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems show contradictory 
associations—from positive to negative to null. This meta-analysis attempts to resolve these 
contradictions. Across 193 studies (n = 92,236) we find a small positive association between 
sexual orientation concealment and internalizing mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, 
distress, problematic eating; ESr = 0.126; 95% CI [0.102, 0.151]) and a small negative association 
between concealment and substance use problems (ESr = ‒0.061; 95% CI [‒0.096, ‒0.026]). The 
association between concealment and internalizing mental health problems was larger for those 
studies that assessed concealment as lack of open behavior, those conducted recently, and those 
with younger samples; it was smaller in exclusively bisexual samples. Year of data collection, 
study location, and sample gender, education, and racial/ethnic composition did not explain 
between-study heterogeneity. Results extend existing theories of stigma and sexual minority 
mental health, suggesting potentially distinct stress processes for internalizing problems versus 
substance use problems, life course fluctuations in the experience of concealment, distinct 
experiences of concealment for bisexual individuals, and measurement recommendations for 
future studies. Small overall effects, heavy reliance on cross-sectional designs, relatively few

this meta-analysis suggest future needed methodological advances to further understand the 
mental health of this still-increasingly visible population.

Keywords

bisexual; depression and anxiety; sexual orientation; stigma concealment; substance use problems

From its start, the field of stigma studies has distinguished between visible and concealable 
stigmas in terms of the unique psychosocial challenges they pose to the stigmatized. 
Goffman (1963) highlights this distinction when referring to visible stigmas, such as being a 
racial or ethnic minority or having an obvious physical disability, as “discredited,” and 
concealable stigmas, such as being a sexual minority or having had an abortion, as 
“discreditable.” The visibly stigmatized must contend with the interpersonal costs, including 
stereotypes and discrimination, of being publicly known as a stigmatized individual; they are 
thereby, without choice, discredited as a matter of existence in a stigmatizing world. In 
contrast, those with a concealable stigma uniquely face the intrapsychic costs of choosing 
whether, when, how, and to whom to disclose their stigma (Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010); they 
are only discreditable when known by others to possess a stigma. Experimental and 
observational studies show that concealing a stigma is associated with negative cognitive 
(e.g., preoccupation), affective (e.g., shame), behavioral (e.g., social avoidance), and self-
evaluative (e.g., lack of access to group-based protective resources) consequences (e.g., 
Frable, Platt, & Hoey, 1998; Major & Gramzow, 1999; Smart & Wegner, 1999), whereas 
stigma disclosure can potentially alleviate these burdens if met with a supportive reaction 
(Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010; Pachankis & Bränström, 2018).

The psychosocial challenges of possessing a concealable stigma have been proposed to be 
an important stressor that begins early in development and partially explains the substantial 
disparities in mental health problems affecting sexual minorities (e.g., those who identify as 
lesbian, gay, bisexual; Meyer, 2003). Sexual minorities most commonly become aware of 
their minority sexual orientation in adolescence and first disclose their sexual orientation 
several years later, in early adulthood according to the best-available population-based 
estimates (Calzo, Antonucci, Mays, & Cochran, 2011), and perhaps earlier among more 
recent cohorts (Russell & Fish, 2019). However, even after their initial disclosure, sexual 
minority individuals often continue to conceal their sexual orientation by choice or necessity 
from various individuals and in various situations (Beals, Peplau, & Gable, 2009; Pachankis, 
Westmaas, & Dougherty, 2011) and even initial disclosure can range from a simple 
statement to a lifelong conversation (Mohr & Fassinger, 2000). Thus, sexual orientation 
disclosure is not necessarily only a single event but rather can represent an ongoing response 
to contextual demands and personal decision making (Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010). Through 
the cognitive, affective, behavioral, and self-evaluative demands facing individuals with a 
concealable stigma, the stress of sexual orientation concealment is hypothesized to partially 
drive sexual minorities’ increased experience of stress-sensitive mental health problems, 
including internalizing mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychological 
distress, problematic eating) and substance use problems (Pachankis, 2007).

Despite this plausible hypothesis—that sexual orientation concealment should be associated 
with stress-sensitive mental health problems—quantitative studies of this association have 
produced contradictory results. Indeed, some studies show positive associations between 
sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems (e.g., Ayala & Coleman, 2000; 
Lehavot & Simoni, 2011), others show negative associations (e.g., Dyar & London, 2018; 
Huebner & Davis, 2005), and still others show no significant association (e.g., Kamen, 
Jabson, Mustian, & Boehmer, 2017; Lewis, Milletich, Mason, & Derlega, 2014). 
Explanations for these inconsistencies have only recently emerged (e.g., Jackson & Mohr, 
2016; Meidlinger & Hope, 2014; Schrimshaw, Siegel, Downing, & Parsons, 2013) and 
potentially include: (a) the relative lack of population-based sampling in studies of sexual 
orientation concealment, yielding systematic underrepresentation of those who highly 
conceal; (b) inconsistencies in the operationalization of concealment; (c) use of different 
mental health outcomes, including internalizing mental health problems and substance use 
problems, without consideration of their conceptually meaningful distinctions; and (d) 
typically unexamined contextual and personal background factors that might affect the 
association between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems.

The Challenge of Studying Sexual Minorities Who Conceal

Any study of sexual orientation concealment faces the known methodological challenges of 
ascertaining representative sexual minority samples (Meyer & Wilson, 2009) combined with 
the added challenge of ascertaining individuals across the range of concealment experiences, 
especially those who are highly concealed. Only two published studies of sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems have used probability-based sampling, in which all 
residents of the geographic area of study have equal likelihood of being selected into the 
sample. The results of these studies—that concealment is associated with fewer mental 
health problems, at least among some sexual minorities (Pachankis, Cochran, & Mays, 2015; 
van der Star, Pachankis, & Bränström, 2019)—perhaps contradict the assumption drawn 
across the more common nonrepresentative sampling approaches—that concealment 
predicts greater mental health problems (e.g., Jackson & Mohr, 2016). Yet studies relying on 
nonprobability samples overrepresent the experience of sexual minorities who are relatively 
out and who are otherwise unrepresentative of the general sexual minority population (e.g., 
consistently younger; Hottes, Bogaert, Rhodes, Brennan, & Gesink, 2016; Kuyper, Fernee, 
& Keuzenkamp, 2016).

Highlighting the importance of probability-based sampling for sexual orientation 
concealment-related research questions in particular, the two published studies utilizing such 
sampling find that a sizable proportion (around 10%) of sexual minorities, in both California 
(Pachankis et al., 2015) and Sweden (van der Star et al., 2019), report completely concealing 
their sexual orientation from all others. One of these studies found that sexual minority men 
who have never told another person of their sexual minority status experienced significantly 
lower odds of major depression than out sexual minority men (Pachankis et al., 2015), 
whereas the other found that sexual orientation concealment protects against depression for 
sexual minorities with high social support (van der Star et al., 2019). Population-based 
studies would likely find that sexual minority individuals living in less-supportive 
environments are even more likely to conceal their sexual orientation from all others, with

potentially distinct pathways to and buffers against mental health problems compared with 
those living in California and Sweden (Pachankis & Bränström, 2018).

Yet, even probability-based sampling cannot overcome the fact that some sexual minorities 
will not feel comfortable identifying themselves as such to researchers. For example, 30% of 
sexual minority male respondents in a nonprobability-based study indicate that they would 
not provide their sexual orientation on a national health survey (Ferlatte, Hottes, Trussler, & 
Marchand, 2017), with significant impact on estimates of mental health outcomes (Hottes et 
al., 2016). This challenge is amplified by the fact that most studies of sexual orientation 
concealment identify their samples through their endorsement of a sexual minority identity 
(e.g., as lesbian, gay, or bisexual; e.g., Puckett, Maroney, Levitt, & Horne, 2016), rather than 
a recent and/or persistent pattern of same-sex behavior or same-sex attraction, thereby 
excluding sexual minority individuals who might be uncomfortable identifying as such 
despite otherwise possessing a sexual minority orientation. Even more challenging is that, 
theoretically, some sexual minorities might not feel comfortable identifying as such even to 
themselves (Stein, 1999). Thus, studies of sexual orientation concealment will always be 
biased by the very phenomenon under investigation. Although this problem poses particular 
challenge to generating accurate estimates of the size of the sexual minority population and 
prevalence estimates of mental health problems therein, it poses less threat to the validity of 
studies examining associations between mental health problems and its determinants, as 
long as there is sufficient variation in both (Meyer & Wilson, 2009).

The Inconsistent Operationalization of Sexual Orientation Concealment

Terminology

The inconsistent operationalization of sexual orientation concealment across studies has also 
been raised as a potential explanation for the inconsistent associations between sexual 
orientation concealment and mental health (Meidlinger & Hope, 2014), but has received 
scant empirical attention. Indeed, measures of concealment range from self-reports of a lack 
of sexual orientation disclosure—a relatively objective behavior (e.g., spoken disclosure of 
one’s sexual orientation to others)—to self-reports of general, more poorly defined states 
such as a lack of general “openness” (e.g., “Are you open about your sexual orientation with 
[a] family, with [b] friends, with [c] acquaintances, with [d] colleagues?” Persson, Pfaus, & 
Ryder, 2015), or a lack of public knowledge (e.g., “how many people know [that you are a 
sexual minority]?” Sandfort, Bos, & Reddy, 2018). As reviewed below, these approaches 
capture potentially distinct phenomena with distinct implications for mental health.

Here we review not only the variability in how self-report scales operationalize concealment 
(from the absence of active behavioral disclosure to more general states), but also the 
variability in terms used to describe it. Across studies, the construct is variably referred to as 
a lack of disclosure (e.g., Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2009), lack of open behavior 
(e.g., Kosciw, Palmer, & Kull, 2015), which is also sometimes called a lack of outness (e.g., 
Paul, Smith, Mohr, & Ross, 2014); and lack of general openness (e.g., Meidlinger & Hope, 
2014). Throughout this review, we treat a lack of disclosure as the lack of an “active 
indication of one’s sexual orientation through speech or action” (Meidlinger & Hope, 2014;

p. 490). Lack of open behavioral refers to whether and to what extent one discusses or 
otherwise behaviorally manages their sexual orientation in interactions with others (Mohr & 
Fassinger, 2000). Lack of general openness, in contrast, represents one’s perception that they 
conceal their sexual orientation; however, lack of general openness does not necessarily 
capture whether or not disclosure has occurred. Lack of public knowledge represents an 
additional related construct referring to one’s perception that others’ do not know about 
one’s sexual orientation, regardless of whether or not disclosure has occurred (Sandfort et 
al., 2018).

We use concealment as an umbrella term for the related constructs we explore throughout 
this article (e.g., Pachankis, 2007). Concealment refers to a behavioral construct (e.g., the 
observable reality of not disclosing or not discussing one’s sexual orientation) informed by 
cognitive factors (i.e., the perception that one is not open with others about their sexual 
orientation and that others are not aware of one’s sexual orientation). In addition to 
including reports of behavioral manifestations, our operationalization of concealment also 
includes these latter cognitive factors given that the self-perception of not being open with 
others and the perception of others’ not knowing one’s sexual orientation are likely strong 
indicators of one’s actual concealment behavior.

When referring to the specific behavioral or cognitive aspects of concealment, we use the 
respective terms “lack of disclosure,” “lack of open behavior,” “lack of general openness,” 
and “lack of public knowledge” intentionally. Of course, we are also intentional about 
direction, such that we always refer to concealment in terms of a lack of disclosure, lack of 
openness, lack of general openness, and lack of public knowledge. We do this for ease of 
interpretation despite the fact that many studies frame concealment in terms of its opposite 
(e.g., disclosure).

In the following sections, we review various approaches to measuring concealment 
organized into four categories: lack of disclosure, lack of open behavior, lack of general 
openness, and lack of public knowledge.

Lack of Active Disclosure (Category 1)

Several studies assess sexual orientation concealment as a behavior, namely the number or 
proportion of people in a given social category (e.g., friends, family, medical providers) to 
whom a sexual minority individual has not explicitly disclosed their sexual orientation (e.g., 
Ragins, Singh, & Cornwell, 2007; Shilo & Savaya, 2012). Because it focuses on objective 
behavior—namely, explicit disclosure acts to distinct people—this approach likely more 
reliably assesses concealment than those that rely on self-report of less behaviorally defined 
states, such as a lack of general openness. This assessment approach effectively 
distinguishes, for example, between an individual who has not shared their sexual 
orientation with many people in many domains from an individual who has actively 
disclosed their sexual orientation to many family, friends, and coworkers. Across these 
studies, the number or proportion of people to whom one has not disclosed their sexual 
orientation is typically (e.g., Shilo & Savaya, 2012), although not always (Bosker, 2002; 
Oetjen & Rothblum, 2000; Ragins et al., 2007), related to more symptoms of depression, 
anxiety, and general psychological distress.

Lack of Open Behavior (Category 2)

Recognizing that disclosure is not necessarily a static event with static interpersonal and 
mental health implications, other studies have attempted to capture both whether others 
know or do not know about one’s sexual orientation and how frequently or infrequently 
one’s sexual orientation is presently discussed in various relationships (e.g., Mohr & 
Fassinger, 2000). Because this approach captures lack of active discussion, or other 
behavioral indicators of concealing one’s sexual orientation (e.g., the monitoring of 
appearance or mannerisms; Jackson & Mohr, 2016), it can be considered relatively 
behavioral in nature, although importantly, it does not capture lack of active disclosure (i.e., 
direct explicit statement of one’s sexual orientation) unlike those measures in Category 1. 
The most common measure that employs this approach—the Outness Inventory (Mohr & 
Fassinger, 2000)—asks respondents to describe their relationships with 11 categories of 
people (e.g., mother, father, work peers) by selecting one of seven descriptions that combine 
whether those people know of their sexual orientation (from “definitely does not know” to 
“definitely knows”) with how often they openly talk about it with those people (from 
“never” to “openly”). This assessment approach can distinguish, for example, between an 
individual who does not discuss their sexual orientation, takes steps to hide or downplay 
their orientation, and of whose sexual orientation few others are aware from an individual 
who openly discusses their sexual orientation at least on occasion and does not particularly 
hide or downplay verbal or behavioral indicators of their sexual orientation. Studies that use 
the Outness Inventory and similar scales (e.g., Clemens, 2004) sometimes find positive 
associations between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems (e.g., 
Birichi, 2015; Chiang, 2009; Foster, Brewster, Velez, Eklund, & Keum, 2017) and 
sometimes find negative or no such association (e.g., Beaber, 2008; Livingston, 
Christianson, & Cochran, 2016; Nance, 2008; Paul et al., 2014).

Lack of General Openness (Category 3)

A less behavioral, more abstract way of assessing sexual orientation concealment is to 
measure concealment as a general state by asking sexual minorities to indicate how 
generally open or not open they are (e.g., McGarrity & Huebner, 2014; Pilkington & 
D’Augelli, 1995). This approach does not assess specific behavior, unlike those that assess 
lack of active disclosure (Category 1) or lack of open behavior (Category 2). This approach 
can simply distinguish individuals who do not believe or perceive that they are open about 
their sexual orientation from those who do. Because this approach relies on sexual 
minorities’ overall perceptions of their concealment, it is likely influenced by general 
psychological tendencies, reporting style, and personality factors (Larson, Chastain, Hoyt, & 
Ayzenberg, 2015). To the degree that these factors similarly influence both the relevant 
predictors (e.g., concealment) and outcomes (e.g., reports of depression, anxiety, or 
psychological distress), this approach might yield inflated estimates due to same-source 
confounding (Watson & Pennebaker, 1989). In fact, many studies using this approach find 
positive associations between lack of general openness and mental health problems (e.g., 
Meidlinger & Hope, 2014; Velez, Moradi, & Brewster, 2013), although whether these 
associations are valid or instead due to same-source confounding remains unknown.

Lack of Public Knowledge (Category 4)

Some concealment measures altogether avoid capturing any active behavioral indicators of 
concealment (e.g., lack of active disclosure, lack of open behaviors, lack of general 
openness) and instead only assess whether others do not know about one’s sexual orientation 
(e.g., Sandfort et al., 2018). Assessing concealment as whether others do not know about 
one’s sexual orientation weakens construct validity because whether or not others know 
about one’s sexual orientation is influenced by numerous, often unexamined factors 
potentially unrelated to a person’s behavioral attempts to conceal. In fact, for some sexual 
minorities, “being out” (i.e., being known as a sexual minority) represents a nonvolitional, 
externally imposed circumstance. For example, if a sexual minority is discovered engaging 
in same-sex sexual behavior, news of their behavior and of their assumed sexual minority 
identity could become public knowledge. Although this person would be “not concealed” 
according to a scale that simply assesses others’ knowledge of their sexual orientation, they 
might have never disclosed their sexual orientation and, instead, might have preferred to 
keep it concealed (D’Augelli, Hershberger, & Pilkington, 1998; Friedman, Marshal, Stall, 
Cheong, & Wright, 2008). As another example, gender nonconforming expression 
represents a visible sign through which others may (often correctly) assume one’s sexual 
orientation even without disclosure (e.g., Rieger, Linsenmeier, Gygax, Garcia, & Bailey, 
2010). At the same time, for most individuals, lack of public knowledge is likely a strong 
indicator of whether that person has, in fact, successfully concealed their sexual orientation. 
Still, studies assessing sexual orientation concealment in this way tend to produce small 
(e.g., Kuyper & Bos, 2016) or nonsignificant (e.g., Sandfort et al., 2018) associations with 
mental health problems.

Use of Dichotomous Versus Continuous Measures of Concealment

Studies that use dichotomous measures of concealment should show smaller associations 
with mental health problems than those that use continuous measures. Dichotomous 
measures of concealment likely preclude capturing at least some variance in the 
phenomenon under study, thereby excluding important information, missing any 
nonlinearity in associations with mental health problems, and reducing statistical power to 
detect associations with mental health problems (Altman & Royston, 2006).

Distinctions Between Internalizing Mental Health Problems and Substance 

Use Problems in the Study of Sexual Minority Mental Health Determinants

Whether the association between concealment and mental health problems differs depending 
on the specific mental health problem under investigation has not been systematically 
examined despite its importance for theoretical accounts of sexual minority stigma, stress, 
and mental health.

Most studies of the association between sexual orientation concealment and mental health 
examine depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress as outcomes (Jackson & 
Mohr, 2016; Meidlinger & Hope, 2014). A few other studies examine problematic eating 
and substance use problems (Currin et al., 2018; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Mason, Lewis, & 
Heron, 2017; Watson, Velez, Brownfield, & Flores, 2016). All of these mental health

problems are united in being particularly sensitive to social stressors such as concealment 
(Hammen, 2005; Mineka & Zinbarg, 2006) and in being elevated among sexual minorities 
compared with heterosexuals (Cochran & Mays, 2009; Feldman & Meyer, 2007; Meyer, 
2003). However, substance use problems differ from depression, anxiety, psychological 
distress, and problematic eating in being an externalizing mental health problem (Forbush et 
al., 2010; Krueger, Markon, Patrick, Benning, & Kramer, 2007; Mitchell, Wolf, Reardon, & 
Miller, 2014). Whereas internalizing mental health problems share high comorbidity and 
underlying mechanisms grounded in cognitive-affective neuroscience models of stress, 
emotions, and coping (Clark & Watson, 1991; Krueger, Watson, & Barlow, 2005; Shin & 
Liberzon, 2010), externalizing problems are united in sharing underlying tendencies toward 
disinhibition (Krueger, Markon, Patrick, & Iacono, 2005). Externalizing problems also differ 
from internalizing problems in their outward display of behavior, rather than inward 
direction of distress (Krueger et al., 2005).

Substance use problems are also often influenced by social network characteristics 
(Rosenquist, Murabito, Fowler, & Christakis, 2010). In fact, a few studies have suggested 
that the sexual orientation disparity in substance use problems might be at least partially 
explained by sexual orientation differences in sexual network characteristics (Hatzenbuehler, 
McLaughlin, & Xuan, 2015), including greater perceptions of normative substance use by 
sexual minorities compared with heterosexuals (Cochran, Grella, & Mays, 2012; 
Hatzenbuehler, Corbin, & Fromme, 2008). Yet, most studies simply explain sexual 
minorities’ greater tendency to use substances in terms of their disproportionate exposure to 
minority stressors such as concealment and associated discrimination (Feinstein, Dyar, & 
London, 2017), viewing it through the same theoretical lens as internalizing problems. This 
approach might obscure distinct determinants of internalizing versus externalizing mental 
health problems among sexual minorities, which emerging research suggests might exist 
(Rodriguez-Seijas, Eaton, & Pachankis, 2019).

Sexual orientation concealment is expected to show positive and similarly sized associations 
with all internalizing problems—whether depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and 
eating problems—given their high degree of comorbidity and symptom overlap with the 
cognitive (e.g., rejection hyper-vigilance), affective (e.g., guilt), and behavioral (e.g., 
avoidance) stressors of concealment (Pachankis, 2007). In fact, similar associations across 
diverse internalizing mental health problems have been found for other minority stressors, 
such as internalized homophobia (Newcomb & Mustanski, 2010).

Yet, we hypothesize that concealment might show negative associations with substance use 
problems given that concealment might keep sexual minorities from the more normative 
substance use in sexual minority, compared with heterosexual, communities (Cochran et al., 
2012; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2015), likely in part owing to the 
history of more normative socializing in venues in which substance use is common among 
sexual minorities (Hughes, Wilsnack, & Kantor, 2016; Trocki, Drabble, & Midanik, 2005). 
Finding opposite associations for concealment with internalizing mental health problems 
versus substance use problems would expand minority stress theory’s focus on the solely 
stress-related consequences of concealment (Meyer, 2003) to other social influences on 
sexual minority health, including those stemming from exposure to sexual minority

community norms and network influences (e.g., Burton, Clark, & Pachankis, 2020; 
Pachankis et al., 2020).

Similar to the scaling considerations for sexual orientation concealment described above, 
when measured dichotomously, mental health outcomes are expected to show smaller 
associations with concealment than when mental health outcomes are measured 
continuously (Altman & Royston, 2006).

Potential Contextual and Personal Moderators of the Association Between 

Sexual Orientation Concealment and Mental Health

Age

It is unclear to what extent often-unexamined contextual and personal factors might explain 
the inconsistent association between concealment and mental health problems across studies 
(Legate, Ryan, & Weinstein, 2012). Indeed, rather than uniformly placing sexual minorities 
at risk of stress-sensitive mental health problems, concealment might exert a less stressful 
effect for some sexual minorities or might even protect some sexual minorities against other 
minority stressors like homophobic/biphobic discrimination (McGarrity & Huebner, 2014; 
Pachankis & Bränström, 2018; Pachankis et al., 2015). The ability of concealment to 
potentiate or protect against stress likely varies as a function of contextual or personal 
factors. As reviewed below, relevant factors potentially include age, the time period in which 
sexual minorities live, the geographic location in which sexual minorities live, gender, 
educational background, race and ethnicity, and bisexuality.

A life course approach to sexual minority mental health and its determinants requires 
consideration of both age and period effects. In terms of age, although concealment has 
some adaptive benefits across the life span, those benefits might be more outweighed by 
concealment’s risks earlier in development. Concealment might pose a greater mental health 
burden to younger sexual minorities because younger individuals might possess fewer 
psychological resources for coping with stress than older individuals (Casey, Jones, & Hare, 
2008). Further, younger sexual minorities might exist in more constrained environments than 
older sexual minorities, such as under conditions of parental control or limited options for 
social or geographic mobility or affirmative mental health care (Durso & Meyer, 2013; 
Hatzenbuehler & Pachankis, 2016), and therefore have fewer material resources for coping 
with concealment. Further, to the extent that concealment drives chronic and anxious 
expectations of rejection and negative emotions such as shame (Pachankis, 2007), evidence 
suggests that these experiences have their greatest mental health impact during the 
developmentally sensitive periods of adolescence and young adulthood (Andersen & 
Teicher, 2008; Charmandari, Kino, Souvatzoglou, & Chrousos, 2003; Leussis & Andersen, 
2008; Murphy, Slavich, Rohleder, & Miller, 2013; Romeo et al., 2006). Although outness 
certainly has risks across the lifespan (Pachankis & Bränström, 2018), including among 
younger sexual minorities (D’Augelli, 2002), weight of the evidence suggests a stronger 
association between concealment and mental health problems for younger, compared with 
older, sexual minorities.

Time Period

Life course models of sexual minority mental health highlight the impact of the rapidly 
changing societal context surrounding this population (e.g., Cohler & Hammack, 2007). 
Indeed, the experience of being a sexual minority has changed so rapidly that distinct sexual 
minority experiences can be found not just across successive generations, but even decade-
to-decade or possibly year-to-year (e.g., Hammack, Frost, Meyer, & Pletta, 2018; Russell & 
Fish, 2019). For instance, over the span of 10 years in the United States, same-sex behavior 
was decriminalized (2003), federal hate crimes laws were expanded to recognize sexual 
orientation (2009), sexual minorities were allowed to serve openly in the military (2010), 
and the definition of marriage as between a man and woman was declared unconstitutional 
(2013). Concealment might represent an experience whose meaning and mental health 
implications have changed concomitantly fast over recent history. Given the relatively rapid 
increase in public support for sexual minorities in many countries in recent periods, 
concealment might be less adaptive as a protection against discrimination and victimization 
for sexual minorities today than in years past. In fact, recent evidence shows that the mental 
health of sexual minorities has improved over time as a function of their decreased exposure 
to discrimination and victimization (Hatzenbuehler, Bränström, & Pachankis, 2018). At the 
same time, perhaps today’s more supportive climates raise the threshold required for 
concealment, such that those who are most burdened by poor mental health are most likely 
to conceal. In fact, societal improvements affecting the stigmatized can exacerbate 
inequalities within them, such that those who are otherwise disadvantaged do not benefit as 
much from those societal improvements as those who are not so relatively disadvantaged 
(Phelan, Link, & Tehranifar, 2010). Those who conceal for reasons other than societal 
constraints against openness might also be those who experience poorer mental health as a 
result of other causes. Conversely, concealment would be expected to be associated with 
better mental health in past periods given the greater threat facing open sexual minorities. 
For these reasons, concealment is likely associated with poorer mental health in studies in 
which data were more recently collected.

Study Location

Theoretical accounts of stigma concealment suggest that sexual minorities living in more 
structurally homophobic geographic contexts face higher consequences to disclosure than 
those living in structurally supportive contexts (Pachankis, 2007). In fact, recent data 
collected across 28 structurally diverse countries finds that sexual orientation concealment is 
only associated with positive life satisfaction in structurally homophobic contexts, but not in 
structurally supportive contexts (Pachankis & Bränström, 2018). This effect was mediated 
by exposure to discrimination and victimization. In structurally homophobic contexts (i.e., 
those containing discriminatory laws, policies, and community attitudes affecting sexual 
minorities; Hatzenbuehler, 2016), concealment protected against discrimination and 
victimization, whereas in structurally supportive contexts (i.e., those with laws, policies and 
attitudes that offer protection for sexual minorities), the likelihood of discrimination and 
victimization were equally low for highly concealed and nonconcealed sexual minorities. 
Mental health problems were not assessed in this study, and to our knowledge, no such 
cross-country examination of sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems 
exists. Because most studies of sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems

are conducted in North America, insufficient evidence exists from which to hypothesize 
whether other global regions would demonstrate similar associations between concealment 
and mental health problems. Also unknown is whether a sufficient number of non–North 
American studies exists to test such a hypothesis.

Gender

The mental health cost of disclosure is likely greater for sexual minority men than for sexual 
minority women. Several studies, for instance, find that sexual minority men experience 
more homophobic victimization than do sexual minority women (Balsam, Rothblum, & 
Beauchaine, 2005; D’Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002; Herek, 2000). Further, in 
one of the only population-based studies of sexual orientation concealment and mental 
health, sexual minority men who had disclosed their sexual orientation reported higher odds 
of major depressive disorder than sexual minority men who concealed their sexual 
orientation from all others; sexual minority women experienced comparable odds of 
depression regardless of their concealment status (Pachankis et al., 2015). Of course, within 
sexual minority populations, the experience of gender often cannot be separated from the 
experience of sexual identity, such that sexual minority men often identify as gay men and 
sexual minority women often identify as lesbian women. Examinations of gender within 
sexual minority populations are therefore often conflated with these distinct sexual 
identities.

Educational Attainment

Recent evidence suggests that the health benefits of being out might be limited to sexual 
minorities with higher educational attainment. In fact, among sexual minority men with 
higher educational attainment, a positive association between being out and physical health 
has been found, whereas a negative association exists between being out and physical health 
for sexual minority men with lower educational attainment (McGarrity & Huebner, 2014). 
Whereas this evidence is limited to physical health among sexual minority men, it coheres 
with population-based evidence that sexual minorities, across the gender spectrum, with 
lower educational attainment are burdened by poorer mental health than those with higher 
educational attainment (Barnes, Hatzenbuehler, Hamilton, & Keyes, 2014). Further 
supporting the potential disproportionate mental health benefits of being out for sexual 
minorities with higher educational attainment, sexual minorities from lower socioeconomic 
positions are less likely to receive support from sexual minority communities (Barrett & 
Pollack, 2005) and are more likely to report stress from those communities (Pachankis et al., 
2019), thereby diminishing this potential benefit of being out.

Race and Ethnicity

For racial and ethnic minorities, being out as a sexual minority might not confer the same 
mental health benefit that it does for nonracial/ethnic-minority individuals. First, racial and 
ethnic identities are often more central than sexual minority identities; therefore, coming out 
as a sexual minority might be of secondary importance compared with possessing a more 
central racial or ethnic identity (Akerlund & Cheung, 2000; Ross, 2005). Second, racial and 
ethnic minorities might face racial and ethnic stigma from within gay communities at the 
same time that they might lose support from their racial and ethnic minority communities

when they are out (Akerlund & Cheung, 2000; Dubé & Savin-Williams, 1999; Ross, 2005). 
In fact, concealment has shown associations with mental health problems only for White 
sexual minority men, but not for Latino sexual minority men (Villicana, Delucio, & Biernat, 
2016). Research has shown that, compared with White sexual minorities, Latinx sexual 
minorities might be more likely to engage in tacit disclosure, whereby they do not actively 
hide their sexual orientation at the same time that they have not disclosed it (e.g., bringing a 
same-gender partner to a family event despite never having verbally disclosed their sexual 
orientation). Tacit disclosure might be just as indicative of an authentic self-presentation for 
some racial and ethnic minorities as verbal disclosure (Villicana et al., 2016). Overall, 
research suggests that sexual orientation concealment might have weaker implications for 
mental health among racial and ethnic minority individuals than it does for nonracial/ethnic 
minorities.

Bisexual Identity

Although bisexual individuals consistently report poorer mental health than gay men and 
lesbian women (Bostwick, Boyd, Hughes, & McCabe, 2010; Conron, Mimiaga, & Landers, 
2010) and are more likely to conceal their sexual orientation than gay men and lesbian 
women (Balsam & Mohr, 2007; Lewis, Derlega, Brown, Rose, & Henson, 2009; Rosario, 
Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2008; Stokes, Vanable, & McKirnan, 1997), existing evidence 
suggests that concealment has a relatively weaker influence on the mental health of 
bisexuals than gay men and lesbian women. Although their higher likelihood of concealment 
might explain why bisexuals experience less homophobic victimization and discrimination 
than gay men and lesbian women (Chesir-Teran & Hughes, 2009; Herek, 2009; Kuyper & 
Fokkema, 2011), bisexuals’ sexual identities have been found to be less central to their 
overall identities than gay men and lesbian women’s sexual identities (Dyar, Feinstein, & 
London, 2015). Therefore, concealment of a bisexual identity might have a relatively small 
impact on mental health than concealment of a gay or lesbian identity. Further, to the extent 
that bisexual individuals’ identities are less reflected in institutions and normative discourse 
both within general society and within gay and lesbian communities (Steinman, 2000), any 
protective effects of disclosure, such as increased social support or access to other identity-
specific protections (Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010), are likely to be smaller, and thus the costs of 
concealment are likely not as high as they are for gay and lesbian individuals (Beals et al., 
2009).

Aims and Hypotheses

The present meta-analysis aggregates the results of all previous studies that have examined 
the association between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems to 
determine the overall association between these variables. Previous studies typically show 
null, small, or contradictory associations between sexual orientation concealment and mental 
health problems. As reviewed above, lack of representative sampling, inconsistent 
measurement of concealment, lack of conceptual distinction between internalizing and 
externalizing mental health problems, and unexamined contextual or personal factors in this 
literature might explain inconsistent effects across studies. Therefore, in addition to 
calculating the average effect size across studies, we also attempt to examine heterogeneity 
across studies as a function of approach to operationalizing concealment; mean participant

age; time period of data collection; the gender composition of the sample; educational 
attainment of the sample; racial and ethnic composition of the sample; whether the sample 
was composed exclusively of bisexual individuals; and whether the study used dichotomous 
or continuous concealment and mental health scales. Further, to begin to extend the 
conceptual distinction between internalizing and externalizing mental health problems to 
theorizing about sexual minority mental health and its determinants, we also examine the 
association between sexual orientation and mental health problems distinctly for 
internalizing mental health problems and substance use problems.

In terms of a priori directional hypotheses, we expected that studies utilizing behavioral 
operationalizations of concealment (e.g., lack of active disclosure, lack of open behavior) 
will show larger associations between concealment and mental health problems than studies 
using nonbehavioral operationalizations (e.g., lack of general openness, lack of public 
knowledge) given potentially extraneous influences captured by nonbehavioral measures. 
We expected to find the smallest association between concealment operationalized as lack of 
public knowledge and mental health problems given the threats to construct validity posed 
by the many potential factors influencing whether others know of one’s sexual orientation.

In terms of contextual and personal moderators of the association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems, based on the evidence reviewed above, we 
hypothesized, a priori, that studies containing younger samples, conducted more recently, 
composed of mostly men, with a greater proportion of individuals with lower educational 
attainment, with a greater proportion of White individuals, and whose sample composition is 
exclusively bisexual would evidence larger associations between concealment and mental 
health problems. As a post hoc exploration, we examined whether studies utilizing 
dichotomous measures of concealment and/or mental health would yield smaller effect sizes 
than those utilizing continuous measures of those constructs. As a second post hoc 
exploration, we examined whether studies of internalizing problems would show positive 
associations with concealment, whereas studies of substance use problems would show 
negative associations with concealment.

Results of this meta-analysis, the first to examine the association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems, have the potential to resolve increasingly obvious 
inconsistencies across studies into these constructs. This study can bring us closer to 
answering how and under what circumstances sexual orientation concealment—a pervasive 
aspect of the sexual minority experience—comes to shape the mental health of this 
increasingly visible population. By testing the above hypotheses, this analysis can support 
existing, and perhaps advance novel, theories regarding sexual minority mental health.

provided such an association upon request; (b) included sexual minority participants and 
reported a separate analyses for these participants; and (c) used unique data in their analyses 
(i.e., data that were not analyzed in any other report included in the meta-analysis). 
Otherwise, studies were only excluded if they did not include an appropriate concealment 
measure or mental health measure or if information necessary for calculating an association 
between concealment and mental health was not available within the study or provided by 
the studies’ authors.

Search Strategy

A search strategy was implemented across three electronic databases (i.e., PsycINFO, 
Medline, and Web of Science) to identify studies related to sexual orientation concealment 
and mental health problems among sexual minorities. Publication date was not restricted; 
thus, the search included the earliest relevant studies up until the date the final search was 
carried out (i.e., May 22, 2019). Using their respective controlled terms, customized search 
strategies were developed for each database consisting of key terms related to sexual 
orientation concealment, mental health problems, and sexual minorities (see the Appendix 
for full PsycINFO search strategy). Databases were searched for both published peer-
reviewed studies and dissertations.

A reference librarian, experienced in meta-analytic searches, reviewed our Boolean and 
proximity indicators, subject headings and controlled terms, search term spelling and syntax, 
and limits and filters; advised our text word search process (e.g., identifying missing terms, 
missing word forms); suggested databases to retrieve non–English language studies; and 
tested our searches.

The reference lists of all records suitable for inclusion were manually checked, and the 
authors of all records deemed eligible for inclusion were emailed to request potentially 
relevant unpublished data in their possession. Specifically, we contacted 148 authors of 
studies initially marked for inclusion to request any unpublished data that may be relevant 
for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We received replies from 35.1% of authors, leading to the 
inclusion of an additional 15 studies. We also posted requests for relevant data on the 
listservs of professional organizations of scholars conducting sexual minority mental health 
research, resulting in the inclusion of three additional studies. For those studies containing 
assessments of sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems that were 
missing other key information (e.g., an effect size), we requested missing information from 
the authors. Specifically, we contacted 102 authors whose study (or studies) was (were) 
missing this information; 22% of authors replied with the requested data. In three of these 
cases, the provided data led us to deem the study as not suitable for inclusion.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently screened the abstracts of all records retrieved in the search. 
Following the abstract review, both reviewers read the full texts of records deemed 
potentially eligible for inclusion. We generated multiple measures of interrater reliability at 
various stages of the review process. Cohen’s statistic estimates chance agreement between 
two coders and removes it from the estimation of reliability (Viera & Garrett, 2005). A

Cohen’s κ score was calculated to determine the level of agreement between the two coders 
at the abstract review and full-text review stages. The following indices were used to 
interpret the results: values ≤0 indicate no agreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to slight, 0.21–
0.40 as fair, 0.41–0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial, and 0.81–1.00 as almost 
perfect agreement (McHugh, 2012). Interrater reliability was subtantial at the abstract review 
(κ = .86) and full-text review stage (κ = .73). Discrepancies between reviewers’ inclusion 
determinations were solved through further discussion among all study authors.

Data extracted from each record included authors’ name, sample size, type of publication 
(i.e., journal article, dissertation, or unpublished), year of publication, location, sample 
characteristics (i.e., age, gender composition, racial and ethnic composition, educational 
attainment [% some college education or above], and sexual orientation composition [i.e., 
exclusively bisexual]), sexual orientation concealment measures used, and mental health 
outcome measures used. Table 1 summarizes all extracted data.

Most of the included records reported Pearson product–moment correlations. Being an 
appropriate measure of effect size, the correlation coefficient was therefore chosen as the 
effect size statistic (ESr). In cases where records did not report a correlation coefficient, a 
request was sent to the study authors. When the authors did not reply or were unable to 
retrieve the relevant correlation coefficient, the reported statistics (e.g., from an ANOVA) 
were converted to ESr, when available.

Measures of Sexual Orientation Concealment

A variety of sexual orientation concealment measures were used in the included studies, 
which we categorized using the four categories described above: Lack of active disclosure 
(Category 1), lack of open behavior (Category 2), lack of general openness (Category 3), and 
lack of public knowledge (Category 4). Studies in Category 1 used a concealment measure 
that captured the number or proportion of people in a given social category (e.g., friends, 
family) to whom a sexual minority individual had not explicitly disclosed their sexual 
orientation. Studies in Category 2 used a concealment measure that captured both the extent 
to which people in a given social category (e.g., coworkers, heterosexual friends) do not 
know about an individual’s sexual orientation and how infrequently one’s sexual orientation 
is presently discussed in those relationships. Studies in Category 3 used a concealment 
measure that captured an individual’s lack of general openness about their sexual orientation 
with people in a given social category (e.g., parents, people in general). Studies in Category 
4 used a concealment measure that captured a lack of public knowledge among people in a 
given social category (e.g., peers, spouse’s family) regarding an individual’s sexual 
orientation.

Concealment measures that captured multiple categories could not be assigned a category 
but instead only contributed to analyses of pooled effect sizes (e.g., Nash, 1990; Schrimshaw 
et al., 2013; Shilo & Savaya, 2011). For studies that used multiple measures of sexual 
orientation concealment (k = 17), separate effect sizes were extracted for each of the four 
categories. The majority (54.4%) of effects derived from commonly used concealment 
measures (e.g., the Outness Inventory) with high reliability and established psychometric

properties. The remaining effects derive from one-item (31.5%) or multiitem (14.1%) 
instruments without established reliability.

In our search, we also identified a small number of studies whose concealment measures did 
not match any of our four a priori concealment categories, but which we nonetheless decided 
to retain since they did capture sexual orientation concealment. These studies (n = 3) all 
captured concealment from one other person or a small group of people in a very 
circumscribed social domain (i.e., mental health providers, Owens, Riggle, & Rostosky, 
2007; health care provider, Sun, Tobin, Spikes, & Latkin, 2019; and adult children, Tornello 
& Patterson, 2018). Although these very specific domains of concealment were not expected 
to have broad implications for mental health, we nonetheless included these three studies in 
a sensitivity analysis of our primary analysis to determine the robustness of our results when 
these specific manifestations of concealment are included.

To establish the reliability of our concealment categorization, one coder classified each 
measure used in each study. The second coder then reviewed this classification and indicated 
whether he agreed. Raters agreed on almost every (97.5%) classification of effects into the 
four concealment categories.

Measures of Mental Health Problems

The studies in the final sample utilized various measures of mental health problems, listed in 
Table 2. The types of measures were classified into five main categories: depression, anxiety, 
general psychological distress, problematic eating, and substance use problems, which were 
further classified as internalizing mental health problems (depression, anxiety, general 
psychological distress, problematic eating) and substance use problems, based on 
empirically derived psychiatric classification schemes (Forbush et al., 2010; Krueger & 
Markon, 2006). For studies that reported more than one outcome or more than one measure 
of mental health problems, we extracted all relevant data separately. We also included fear of 
negative evaluation and rumination as outcomes given that fear of negative evaluation is a 
pathognomonic feature of social anxiety disorder and that rumination is associated with 
depression and anxiety disorders.

The majority (98.4%) of effects derived from commonly used mental health measures (e.g., 
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) with high reliability and 
established psychometric properties. The remainder of effects (1.6%) derived from 
instruments without established reliability.

Hypothesized Effect Moderators

Table 1 summarizes all hypothesized moderators in terms of their extracted information, 
coding, and average distribution across studies. In addition to the four distinct categories of 
concealment described above, hypothesized moderators of the association between sexual 
orientation concealment and mental health problems included: time period (i.e., estimated 
year of data collection [for studies lacking this information, we used year of publication 
minus the average publication lag across studies (i.e., 8 years)]), study location (i.e., studies 
conducted in North America vs. studies conducted outside of North America), whether the 
study used dichotomous measures for concealment and mental health problems, age (i.e.,

participants), educational attainment (i.e., proportion of the sample that had completed at 
least some college), race/ethnicity (i.e., studies containing a majority of racial/ethnic 
minority participants), and studies with an exclusive bisexual sample.

Analytic Strategies

Correlation coefficients were used as the measure of effect size. All effects were coded such 
that a positive effect indicates an association between concealment and mental health 
problems whereas a negative effect indicates an association between concealment and 
favorable mental health. Before the primary analyses, we transformed the correlations 
derived from the studies with Fisher’s r-to-z transformation to be able to compare studies on 
a scale with approximately normal distribution and stabilized variance. After the analyses, 
results were transformed back to r for interpretation. Random effect models were used to 
calculate pooled effect sizes; these are presented as correlations. Because many studies 
contributed multiple effect sizes, we both (a) calculated the standardized average mean of 
mental health problems for each study and (b) used robust variance estimation models to 
make use of all effect sizes available in each study adjusting for dependency between effect 
sizes coming from the same study (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010; Tanner-Smith & 
Tipton, 2014). We interpret effect sizes as small (r = .1), medium (r = .3), and large (r = .5), 
according to Cohen’s conventions (Cohen, 1988; Cohen, 1992). Heterogeneity between 
studies was examined with the Q, I2, and τ2 statistics, to assess both the size and 
significance of heterogeneity between studies.

We conducted post hoc moderation analyses using metaregression, examining the potential 
effect of various study and sample characteristics as explanatory factors of between-study 
heterogeneity. The variables examined as potential moderators of the association between 
sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems were: type of mental health 
problem (i.e., depression, anxiety, general distress, problematic eating, substance use 
problems); type of measure used to assess sexual orientation concealment (i.e., Category 1 to 
4); study characteristics (i.e., time period, study location, use of dichotomous measure of 
concealment, use of dichotomous measure of mental health problems); and sample 
characteristics (i.e., age, gender, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, exclusive bisexual 
sample composition).

We analyzed study heterogeneity across a number of steps. First, we assessed whether the 
relationship between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems differed 
based on the type of mental health problem. For these analyses we entered dummy-coded 
variables for each type of mental health problem (i.e., depression, anxiety, general distress, 
problematic eating, and substance use) into separate bivariate metaregression analyses. For 
these analyses, we included all studies that contributed effect sizes for any mental health 
problem. For studies in which effect sizes could be extracted separately for more than one 
mental health problem, multiple separate effect sizes were used in the analysis.

Second, we examined whether the relationship between sexual orientation concealment and 
mental health problems differed based on the type of sexual orientation concealment 
classification derived from our four-category scheme. In these analyses, studies measuring

concealment using more than one type of concealment measure were allowed to contribute 
multiple effect sizes. Similar to the analyses of different mental health outcomes, dummy-
coded variables for each type of concealment measure were entered separately into bivariate 
metaregression analyses. Third, we examined study and sample characteristics as potential 
moderators using bivariate metaregression analyses. Finally, we entered all variables that 
significantly contributed to heterogeneity in the bivariate analyses into a multivariate 
metaregression analysis; nonsignificant moderators were removed using backward deletion

We conducted several tests to ascertain potential study selection bias and to examine 
indications that statistically nonsignificant, or unexpected, results are systematically 
excluded from the literature (i.e., “file-drawer bias”). First, we analyzed the potential 
moderating effect of publication type (i.e., whether data were published in a peer-reviewed 
journal vs. unpublished) using metaregression. Second, we used the trim-and-fill procedure 
to search for indications of publication bias and to examine whether effect sizes change in 
analyses that adjust for this bias (Duval & Tweedie, 2000; Egger, Davey Smith, Schneider, 
& Minder, 1997). Third, we conducted sensitivity analyses comparing the average effect size 
using all studies with the average effect size using only sufficiently powered studies (Carter, 
Schönbrodt, Gervais, & Hilgard, 2019; Stanley, Doucouliagos, & Ioannidis, 2017).

Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included the three studies that utilized highly 
specific manifestations of concealment. These sensitivity analyses were performed on both 
the overall association between sexual orientation concealment and mental health outcomes 
as well as on associations between sexual orientation concealment and each of the 
internalizing (i.e., depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, and problematic 
eating) and externalizing (i.e., substance use) mental health problems.

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 15 and the macros metan, metareg, and 
robumeta (StataCorp, 2017).

Figure 1 illustrates the selection process. The initial electronic searches yielded 5,988 
records, and 49 additional records were located through manually searching reference lists 
of included reports and contacting authors of these reports. There were 4,184 unique records 
once duplicates were removed. Overall, 3,546 records were excluded at the abstract review 
stage. The remaining 638 records were reviewed in full, and 428 records were excluded at 
this stage (see Figure 1 for reasons for exclusion). Two hundred ten records detailing 193 
unique studies were deemed eligible for inclusion (see Table 1). The 193 studies included a 
total of 92,236 study participants. The majority of these studies (k = 119; 61.7%) were 
published in peer-reviewed journals, 51 (26.6%) were unpublished doctoral dissertations, 
and 21 studies (10.9%) were unpublished; one study was published in a book chapter and 
one study was an unpublished master’s thesis. We extracted 423 effects of the association 
between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems from these 193 unique 
samples.

Overall Effect Size

Page 19

Table 3 presents the results from the main analysis examining the association between 
standardized sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems. The analyses 
showed a small positive association between sexual orientation concealment and mental 
health problems (k = 193; effect size [ESr] = 0.116 [p < .001]; 95% CI [0.093, 0.141]). 
Considerable heterogeneity existed between studies: 94.9% of variation between studies was 
attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance (I2 = 94.9%; τ2 = 0.0325).

Factors Contributing to Between-Study Heterogeneity: For Whom and Under What 
Conditions Is Sexual Orientation Concealment Associated With Mental Health Problems?

In our first analysis of study heterogeneity, we explored potential differences attributable to 
the type of outcome measure used to assess mental health problems (i.e., depression, 
anxiety, general psychological distress, problematic eating, and substance use problems). 
These analyses utilized all available effect sizes from all studies. The analyses showed that 
mental health problems measured as general psychological distress (b = 0.061 [p = .018]; 
95% CI [0.011, 0.111]) and substance use problems (b = ‒0.166 [p = .001]; 95% CI [‒
0.247, ‒0.085]) significantly contributed to between-study heterogeneity. Because the type 
of mental health problem contributed to between-study heterogeneity, we calculated pooled 
average effects sizes for each mental health problem separately using robust variance 
estimation (see Table 3). Studies using a measure of general psychological distress to assess 
mental health problems demonstrated the strongest association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems (k = 65; ESr = 0.163 [p < .001]; 95% CI [0.122, 
0.204]). Studies using a measure of substance use problems—the only externalizing mental 
health problem examined here—showed an association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health in the opposite direction, indicating a negative association 
between concealment and substance use problems (k = 20; ESr = ‒0.061 [p = .002]; 95% CI 
[‒0.096, ‒0.026]). That is, whereas sexual orientation concealment showed a small positive 
association with internalizing mental health problems, it showed a small negative association 
with substance use problems.

Because the results above showed that the association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems operated in opposite directions for internalizing 
mental health problems and substance use problems, subsequent analyses of heterogeneity 
were stratified and analyzed separately for these two broad types of mental health problems. 
Power calculations (Valentine, Pigott, & Rothstein, 2010) were used to assess the 
appropriateness of subsequent tests of moderation. Given the high number of studies 
contributing effect sizes for internalizing mental health problems (k = 188; average sample 
size: n = 482), analyses of study heterogeneity could be conducted with sufficient power for 
all hypothesized moderators. Yet, given the relatively smaller number of studies contributing 
effect sizes for substance use problems (k = 20; average sample size: n = 886), analyses of 
heterogeneity for these studies must be interpreted with caution because the nonsignificant 
results for these analyses could be due to insufficient power, rather than true lack of 
association.

As the next step in examining the contribution of study and sample characteristics to 
between-study heterogeneity, we conducted metaregressions in which type of measure of 
sexual orientation concealment (i.e., lack of active disclosure, lack of open behavior, lack of 
general openness, and lack of public knowledge), time period (i.e., year of data collection), 
study location, use of dichotomous measure of concealment, use of dichotomous measure of 
mental health problem, mean age of participants, proportion of the sample that is male, 
proportion of the sample that completed at least some college, whether the sample was 
composed of mostly racial/ethnic minority participants, and whether the sample was 
exclusively bisexual were used to predict between-study heterogeneity in separate bivariate 
metaanalyses (see Table 4).

In bivariate analyses among studies examining the association between concealment and 
internalizing mental health problems, those that measured sexual orientation concealment as 
lack of open behavior and had data that were collected more recently showed stronger 
associations between concealment and internalizing mental health problems. In contrast, 
studies that measured sexual orientation concealment as lack of active disclosure or public 
knowledge, used a dichotomous measure of concealment, contained participants with an 
older mean age, and utilized exclusively bisexual samples showed significantly smaller 
associations between concealment and internalizing mental health problems. We graphically 
depicted the bivariate associations involving continuous variables. Figure 2 graphically 
depicts the bivariate association between time period and study effect for the association 
between sexual orientation concealment and internalizing mental health problems, whereas 
Figure 3 displays the bivariate association between mean age of study participants and study 
effect for the association between sexual orientation concealment and internalizing mental 
health problems. Only one of the proposed moderators was found to significantly explain 
between-study heterogeneity in the association between concealment and substance use 
problems, namely whether studies employed a dichotomous measure of substance use 
problems. Specifically, studies using a dichotomous measure of substance use problems 
showed significantly smaller associations between concealment and substance use problems 
than studies using continuous measures of substance use problems. The small number of 
significant moderators of between-study heterogeneity for substance use problems could, as 
noted above, be attributable to low power rather than lack of true effect.

All variables that significantly contributed to between-study heterogeneity in the association 
between concealment and internalizing mental health problems in the above bivariate 
analyses were then entered into a multivariate metaregression analysis, and nonsignificant 
moderators were removed using backward deletion. The results of the final multivariate 
metaregression analyses are presented in Table 5. The model included studies measuring 
sexual orientation concealment as lack of open behavior, mean age of participants, studies 
using exclusively bisexual samples, and studies using a dichotomous measure of 
concealment as moderators. The model showed that 16.2% of between-study heterogeneity 
could be explained by these variables, although a fair amount of unexplained between-study 
variance remained.

Publication Bias

Page 21

We conducted several tests to ascertain potential publication bias. First, we analyzed the 
potential moderating effect of publication type (i.e., whether data were published in a peer-
reviewed journal vs. unpublished) using metaregression. The effect reported in published 
studies was not significantly different from the effect reported in unpublished studies 
(internalizing mental health problems: b = 0.032 [p = .094]; 95% CI [‒0.005, 0.069]; 
substance use problems: b = ‒0.050 [p = .079]; 95% CI [‒0.106, 0.006]. Second, we used 
the trim-and-fill procedure to inspect potential change in the effect size in analyses that 
adjusted for publication bias. Using the trim-and-fill procedure, we did not estimate any 
“missing” studies; that is, the distribution of study effect sizes was sufficiently symmetric for 
studies of both internalizing mental health problems and substance use problems. As a third 
strategy to analyze potential publication bias, we conducted sensitivity analyses comparing 
the average effect size using all studies with the average effect size using only sufficiently 
powered studies. We identified a total of 34 sufficiently powered studies using internalizing 
mental health problems as an outcome. A sensitivity analysis of the average effect size using 
only sufficiently powered studies (i.e., studies with Ns > 645) produced a slightly lower 
average effect size (k = 34; ESr = .080 [p = .005]; 95% CI [0.027, 0.134]) than the effect size 
found across all studies (k = 188; ESr = .123 [p < .001]; 95% CI [0.103, 0.144]). For studies 
reporting results for substance use problems, there was only one sufficiently powered study 
in our records, precluding additional sensitivity analyses. Based on these three means of 
testing potential publication bias, we conclude that it is unlikely that publication bias 
substantially affected these meta-analytic results. Potentially, there might be a slight 
overestimation of our average effect size for studies of the association between concealment 
and internalizing mental health problems, although the fact that our review finds several null 
or unexpected associations provides evidence that there is not systematic bias on selecting 
only significant effects into the literature.

Sensitivity Analysis

In a sensitivity analysis that included the three identified studies using concealment 
measures that did not match any of the four categories, but which nonetheless captured 
sexual orientation concealment, albeit from very limited domains (i.e., mental health 
providers, health care provider, and adult children), we found an identical pattern of results 
with the only difference from the primary analyses being slightly smaller effect sizes for the 
associations between sexual orientation concealment and mental health in the sensitivity 
analysis (see Table 1 in the online supplemental materials).

Discussion

Across 193 unique studies containing a total of 92,236 participants, this conceptual and 
meta-analytic review finds a small positive association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems. Studies that measured mental health in terms of 
general psychological distress and substance use problems explained a significant proportion 
of between-study heterogeneity. Studies that examined associations between sexual 
orientation concealment and internalizing mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, 
psychological distress, eating problems) showed a small positive association, whereas those

that examined associations between sexual orientation concealment and substance use 
problems showed a small negative association. Further, studies that assessed sexual 
orientation concealment as lack of open behavior (vs. lack of active disclosure, lack of 
general openness, and lack of public knowledge) showed larger associations between 
concealment and internalizing mental health problems. Among studies of internalizing 
mental health outcomes, those conducted more recently, with younger participants, with 
exclusively bisexual samples, and with continuous measures of concealment and/or mental 
health problems showed larger associations than those conducted in the more distant past, 
with older participants, with heterogeneous minority sexual identities, and with dichotomous 
measures of concealment and mental health problems. In the multivariate model, the 
significant moderating effect of time period disappeared but the other significant bivariate 
moderating effects remained. Study location, sample gender composition, educational 
attainment, and sample racial and ethnic composition did not explain between-study 
heterogeneity. Our examination of potential publication bias indicated that the pooled effects 
of this meta-analysis are likely not influenced by publication bias. Results have implications 
for conceptual distinctions among mental health problems, measurement selection, life 
course considerations, and the distinct determinants of bisexual mental health in the study of 
sexual minority mental health.

Implications for Internalizing Versus Externalizing Mental Health Problems

Results have implications for the conceptual distinction between internalizing and 
externalizing mental health problems in studies of sexual orientation concealment, and 
perhaps for the study of sexual minority mental health more broadly. Whereas minority 
stress theory (Meyer, 2003) represents the most plausible explanation for the association 
between sexual orientation concealment and internalizing mental health problems, social 
norms within sexual minority communities have also been found to serve as an additional 
source of the sexual orientation disparity in substance use (e.g., Cochran et al., 2012; 
Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2015), although less thoroughly considered 
than minority stress. On the one hand, our results are consistent with minority stress theory 
(Meyer, 2003) and the psychosocial model of stigma concealment (Pachankis, 2007), which 
propose that sexual orientation concealment drives internalizing mental health problems 
because of its associations with cognitive, affective, and behavioral stress responses to 
anticipated rejection upon disclosure. On the other hand, our results also expand those 
theories to further consider the perhaps paradoxical negative association of concealment 
with substance use problems—the one externalizing mental health problem examined here. 
Specifically, perhaps sexual minorities who conceal are less embedded within sexual 
minority communities than those who are open, which would lead to less exposure to the 
more permissive norms about substance use in sexual minority communities (compared with 
heterosexual communities) and therefore less substance use among sexual minorities who 
conceal (Cochran et al., 2012). This finding is further supported by sociological accounts of 
substance use within sexual minority communities, which find that stigma has historically 
constrained sexual minority socializing to venues in which substance use is common 
(Hughes et al., 2016; Trocki et al., 2005).

Taken together, results are consistent with minority stress theory’s proposed positive 
association between concealment and mental health problems when those problems are 
operationalized as internalizing problems. Although the minority stress of concealment 
might also contribute to sexual minorities’ substance use, other protective factors seem to 
outweigh those stressors to predict a negative association between concealment and this 
externalizing outcome. Based on the present findings, future studies of sexual minority 
mental health might seriously consider examining distinct determinants of, or distinct 
patterns of associations between, social determinants of mental health and internalizing 
versus externalizing mental health problems separately. At the same time, the average size of 
the association between concealment and both internalizing mental health problems and 
substance use problems is small, making tentative any practical implications of these 
findings.

Implications for Measurement

Results also have implications for measurement. Studies that measured sexual orientation as 
lack of open behavior showed significantly larger associations between concealment and 
internalizing mental health problems than studies that measured sexual orientation 
concealment as lack of active disclosure, lack of general openness, and participants’ 
perceptions that others were not aware of their sexual orientation. Studies of concealment as 
lack of open behavior are those that focus on behaviorally managing the visibility of one’s 
sexual minority status in interactions with others (e.g., through avoiding certain topics of 
conservation, such as dating). This construct is most frequently measured with the Outness 
Inventory (Mohr & Fassinger, 2000), which assesses both whether important others do not 
know of one’s sexual orientation and how infrequently it is discussed with them, thereby 
distinguishing it from studies of lack of active disclosure, lack of general openness, or lack 
of public knowledge. Our finding of a comparatively larger association between this measure 
of concealment (vs. the other concealment operationalizations) and internalizing mental 
problems therefore suggests that sexual orientation concealment, when conceptualized as 
this deeper, more ongoing level of engagement with one’s identity (rather than an all-or-
nothing disclosure on the one hand or general openness on the other), has significantly 
stronger implications for mental health. Perhaps some sexual minorities who are “out” 
nonetheless still grapple with their sexual identity. This grappling, perhaps, is captured by 
the “how infrequently it is discussed” component of the Outness Inventory, which applies 
even to those who are already out. Measures in our open behavior category catch this nuance 
and its implications for mental health, but measures in the other categories may not 
distinguish as well between those who are out without ambivalence and those who may be 
out but still find their sexual orientation to be difficult to discuss or to otherwise more deeply 
engage on an ongoing basis. Of course, given that our analysis cannot establish 
directionality, perhaps the inverse is also true—that internalizing mental health problems 
leads one to avoid that type of deeper, ongoing public engagement of their sexual orientation 
more than it leads them to avoid more discrete disclosures or more general open behavior.

The larger association with internalizing mental health problems found for studies 
measuring concealment as lack of open behavior might also be a function of the types of 
studies represented in this review. Because most studies concerning sexual orientation

concealment and mental health problems are conducted using nonprobability samples of 
relatively open participants in relatively accepting societies, perhaps many participants have 
already actively disclosed their sexual orientation to many or most others in their lives 
(Category 1: lack of active disclosure) and consider themselves to be generally open 
(Category 3: lack of general openness). Therefore, measuring concealment in these ways 
might not yield sufficient variation from which to meaningfully predict mental health. Still, 
even those sexual minorities who have disclosed their sexual orientation and are generally 
open might nonetheless suppress open behavior, mannerisms, and appearance on a day-to-
day basis, especially depending on their daily social context. Therefore, we recommend that 
future studies conducted with relatively open sexual minority samples in relatively accepting 
societal contexts at least assess sexual orientation concealment as lack of open behavior 
(Category 2: lack of open behavior), whether or not they also assess concealment using one 
of the other approaches reviewed here. Of course, future studies in contexts in which 
acceptance, and therefore openness, are not the norm might find that assessing concealment 
as lack of active disclosure and lack of general openness also yields sufficient variation for 
meaningful prediction.

Practically, our results show that researchers might wish to conceptualize and measure 
sexual orientation concealment in terms of lack of open behavior rather than lack of active 
disclosure, lack of general openness, or lack of public knowledge, when examining 
associations with mental health. Of course, construct selection depends on study purpose 
and studies seeking to understand mental health implications of discrete disclosures or 
general open behavior ought to select measures of those respective constructs and be 
prepared to understand the theoretical meaning of weak associations that might result. The 
present meta-analysis did not investigate associations between concealment and outcomes 
other than mental health (e.g., physical health, social behavior) or social determinants of 
concealment (e.g., childhood influences, current social context). Researchers of those 
constructs should therefore consider the present findings in light of the theoretical 
associations among those constructs.

Life Course Implications

Results also have implications for the life course study of sexual minority mental health. 
Compared with more distantly conducted studies, more recently conducted studies 
demonstrated a significantly larger association between sexual orientation concealment and 
internalizing mental health problems. This finding can potentially be interpreted in terms of 
the substantial cohort effects affecting this population (e.g., Cohler & Hammack, 2007; 
Hammack et al., 2018; Russell & Fish, 2019). For instance, the association between 
concealment and internalizing mental health problems might be more marked for more 
recent cohorts because of the relatively fewer benefits of remaining closeted today than in 
years past, at least in the relatively accepting contexts in which most of the included studies 
were conducted. The disclosure process model (Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010) suggests that the 
decision to conceal a stigmatized identity is a function of the perceived benefits of 
concealment weighed against the costs of disclosure. In the primarily North American 
research field that we review in the present study, the costs of disclosure for today’s sexual 
minorities are, for many, notably fewer than the costs of concealment because of the rapid

societal change that has afforded sexual minorities numerous advantages of disclosure that 
did not exist in previous decades (e.g., Flores, 2019).

Life course considerations of sexual minority mental health are also expanded by the age 
effects found here. Specifically, we find that studies of younger participants demonstrated a 
larger association between concealment and mental health problems than studies of older 
participants, inviting the possibility that younger sexual minorities possess fewer 
psychological (e.g., emotion regulation) and contextual (e.g., geographic mobility, 
affirmative mental health care) resources for coping with the stressors of concealment than 
older sexual minorities (Casey et al., 2008; Durso & Meyer, 2013; Hatzenbuehler & 
Pachankis, 2016). Further, social stressors such as concealment—especially if motivated by 
fears of targeted rejection—might have a relatively larger impact during adolescence and 
young adulthood than in later adulthood (Andersen & Teicher, 2008; Charmandari et al., 
2003; Leussis & Andersen, 2008; Murphy et al., 2013; Romeo et al., 2006). Notably, 
although several studies in this review were comprised of young adults (e.g., D’Augelli et 
al., 2002; Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2006; Shilo & Savaya, 2012), very few were 
comprised solely of adolescents (e.g., Kosciw et al., 2015). Together, these results suggest 
the essential role of life course considerations in studies of sexual orientation concealment 
and mental health problems and call for future studies across age cohorts, as further 
emphasized below.

Distinct Implications of Concealing Bisexuality

Results also have implications for understanding the significant mental health disparity 
between bisexual versus gay and lesbian individuals (Bostwick et al., 2010). We find that the 
association between concealment and internalizing mental health problems is smaller for 
bisexual compared with gay and lesbian individuals. As noted earlier, bisexual individuals 
endorse less centrality of their minority sexual identities to their overall sense of self than do 
gay and lesbian individuals (e.g., Dyar, Feinstein, & London, 2014). Any stressors 
associated with such an identity are therefore likely to be less impactful for bisexual 
individuals’ mental health, as their bisexual identities might not be as deeply tied to their 
overall sources of personal and collective esteem as are gay and lesbian identities (Ashmore, 
Deaux, & McLaughlin-Volpe, 2004). Further, the smaller association between concealment 
and mental health problems found for studies of exclusive bisexual composition might be 
attributble to stigma. Specifically, because bisexual individuals’ identities are less reflected 
in institutions and normative discourse both within general society and within gay and 
lesbian communities (Steinman, 2000), any protective effects of disclosure, such as 
increased social support or access to other identity-specific protections (Chaudoir & Fisher, 
2010), are likely to be smaller. Of course, bisexuality comprises a remarkably diverse set of 
experiences, calling for future research to examine subgroup differences within bisexual 
populations in the association between concealment and mental health problems and the 
mechanisms that unite them or not in this population.

Methodological Limitations of Existing Research and Future Directions

The fact that study location, sample gender composition, educational attainment, and sample 
racial and ethnic composition did not explain between-study heterogeneity highlights some

of the distinct methodological features and limitations of the studies included here. These 
common study limitations in turn suggest several methodological improvements for future 
research.

First, understanding the mental health consequences of concealment requires 
methodological designs capable of establishing causal inference. With notable exceptions 
(e.g., Pachankis, Sullivan, Feinstein, & Newcomb, 2018; Rosario et al., 2009), few 
longitudinal studies have been conducted on the association between sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health and no experimental study has been conducted that has 
manipulated the concealment demands placed upon sexual minorities to examine 
downstream mental health. Related research has found that sexual minorities exposed to a 
discriminatory video clip are less likely to disclose their sexual orientation in a subsequent 
written reflection task than those exposed to an affirming video clip (Seager, 2016). 
Conversely, other experimental research shows that sexual minority men who write about 
minority stress experiences are more likely to disclose their sexual orientation three months 
later (Pachankis & Goldfried, 2010). Whereas these studies suggest that discrimination can 
cause sexual orientation concealment and writing about minority stress can encourage 
disclosure, they do not examine whether sexual orientation concealment causes mental 
health problems. Experimental research with other populations with concealable stigmas 
(e.g., those with eating disorders) suggests that stigma concealment can drive cognitive, 
affective, and behavioral manifestations of internalizing problems (e.g., Smart & Wegner, 
1999). Still, future research is needed to rule out reverse causality, as depression and anxiety 
might also diminish sexual orientation disclosure (Mohr & Fassinger, 2003), perhaps 
through personality traits that explain tendencies toward both concealment and internalizing 
problems (e.g., Larson et al., 2015).

Second, nearly all studies included in this meta-analysis utilized nonprobability sampling 
and many recruited participants by posting messages in online forums geared to sexual 
minority communities. Although nonprobability sampling can generate samples of sexual 
minorities that are uncharacteristic of the total sexual minority population, this concern is 
particularly problematic when the sample unrepresentativeness directly relates to the 
variables under study (Meyer & Wilson, 2009), as is the case with studies of concealment. 
Specifically, nonprobability sampling overrepresents the experience of sexual minorities 
who are open about their sexual orientation, compared with those who are not open (Hottes 
et al., 2016; Kuyper et al., 2016). Nonprobability samples also tend to overrepresent the 
experience of those who are young, preventing stronger tests of the life course effects 
suggested here. The very few published population-based studies of sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health find that a substantial number of sexual minorities in the 
general population report not being out to others and that mental health varies as a function 
of concealment (Pachankis et al., 2015; van der Star et al., 2018). Future research ought to 
take advantage of increasing opportunities to use probability-based designs, which are 
particularly suited to studying phenomena like concealment that are directly related to 
sampling. Population-based cohort studies, in particular, would allow a strong test of both 
developmental and cohort influences on concealment and mental health problems, thereby 
offering a stronger test of the causal direction of these variables than currently exists.

Third, the lack of significant moderating effects for certain demographic factors might be 
explained by the necessarily crude approach used to classify moderator variables across 193 
studies. For instance, this meta-analysis examined race and ethnicity as the proportion of the 
study sample that was composed of racial and ethnic minority participants. The crude 
manner by which we examined the moderating influence of ethnicity and race (i.e., in terms 
of the proportion of the sample that identified as any racial or ethnic minority) prevented us 
from examining distinct experiences among different racial and ethnic minority subgroups. 
Indeed, concealment is unlikely to be experienced identically across all races and ethnicities 
(e.g., Villicana et al., 2016). Therefore, future investigations into the concealment-related 
experiences of diverse sexual minority populations might consider first qualitatively 
exploring whether and how diverse populations experience sexual orientation concealment 
(e.g., Bowleg, Burkholder, Teti, & Craig, 2008) so as to capture relevant mechanisms or 
moderators of the association between concealment and mental health problems across 
subgroups.

Fourth, study location was coded as whether or not a study was conducted in North 
America. Several factors limited our ability to conduct a finer-grained examination of the 
geographic influences on the association between concealment and mental health. First, 
preventing analysis of state/provincial effects, approximately two thirds of included studies 
were collected in general U.S. samples across multiple states and regions, many completely 
online. Preventing analysis of country effects, only 22.3% of studies contained data collected 
outside of North America. Given wide variation of sexual minority-related structural stigma 
within states/provinces and countries, ideally geographic effects would utilize structural 
stigma measured at the city, municipality, or county level. Yet, only 4.2% of studies 
contained this information and nearly all of these reported data from large U.S. cities (e.g., 
New York, Los Angeles, Miami) that contain high degrees of sexual minority acceptance, 
precluding sufficient variation in geography-bound structural stigma necessary to detect its 
influence on the association between concealment and mental health. Nonetheless, the 
finding regarding the lack of difference in effects between studies conducted within versus 
outside North America tentatively suggests the geographic generalizability of the effect 
found here. Future research could link indicators of community-level structural stigma, such 
as those in the General Social Survey or Project Implicit, to nationwide surveys that contain 
measures of sexual orientation concealment and mental health (e.g., Lattanner et al., 2020).

Fifth, measurement approaches commonly utilized across studies of sexual orientation 
concealment and mental health problems constrain results and suggest future directions. For 
instance, most studies utilized self-reports of concealment and mental health. In addition to 
introducing same-source confounding, such measurements potentially weaken associations 
because of weak psychometric properties. Although most included studies utilized 
established measures of mental health outcomes with high reliability, distinct outcomes (e.g., 
depression and anxiety) were often examined using subscales of the same scale, potentially 
introducing artificial overlap not explained by true comorbidity across conditions. To 
increase validity of findings in this area, future research ought to employ interviewer-based 
assessments with strong construct validity. Our findings also suggest that the use of 
continuous measures of concealment and mental health outcomes are likely to yield stronger 
effects, given preserved power when using continuous rather than dichotomous measures

(Altman & Royston, 2006). Future studies might also consider expanding outcomes to 
include physical health outcomes. In fact, compelling evidence suggests that stigma-related 
stress can have distinct, even opposite, implications for physical and mental health (Jackson, 
Knight, & Rafferty, 2010), which our analysis could not capture.

Finally, this meta-analysis finds a small average effect size between concealment and mental 
health problems, suggesting that future research, including meta-analytic studies, seek to 
identify the relative mental health impact of concealment alongside the other factors 
suggested by existing theories of stigma and sexual minority mental health. As noted earlier, 
minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003), the psychological mediation framework (e.g., 
Hatzenbuehler, 2009), and the disclosure process model (Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010) specify 
numerous other factors that likely contribute to this population’s mental health, which 
studies are increasingly examining simultaneously (e.g., Timmins, Rimes, & Rahman, 
2020). To the extent that meta-analytic evidence could be brought to bear on the relative 
influence of these factors—from discrimination and victimization to anticipated rejection, 
rumination, social support, and community norms—psychological science will be best 
positioned to intervene effectively.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals a small positive association between sexual 
orientation concealment and internalizing mental health problems and a small negative 
association between sexual orientation concealment and substance use problems. The 
association between sexual orientation concealment and internalizing mental health 
problems was somewhat larger in those studies that assessed concealment as lack of open 
behavior, those conducted recently, and those with younger samples; it was smaller in 
exclusively bisexual samples. This review highlights several directions in future 
measurement of sexual orientation concealment and the need for stronger tests of causality, 
representative sampling, more nuanced assessment of potential effect moderators, 
geographic diversity, more valid measurement approaches, and meta-analytic examinations 
of concealment alongside the numerous other determinants of this population’s mental 
health. Although these recommendations apply to all sexual minority mental health research, 
they are particularly relevant to the study of sexual orientation concealment given the 
distinct methodological challenges posed by this phenomenon. These advances will allow 
researchers to come closer to answering how and under what circumstances sexual 
orientation concealment—a pervasive aspect of the sexual minority experience—comes to 
shape the health of this population.

Public Significance Statement

Across 193 studies, sexual orientation concealment demonstrates small positive 
associations with internalizing mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, distress, 
problematic eating) and a small negative association with substance use problems, 
suggesting potentially distinct pathways to these outcomes among sexual minorities. The 
association between sexual orientation concealment and mental health likely depends on 
the time period in which the study was conducted, the specific measurement of 
concealment used, and the age and sexual identity of sexual minority participants.
