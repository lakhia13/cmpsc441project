Abstract
Background  Down Syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD) is an acute or subacute neurocognitive regression in 
individuals with Down syndrome (DS), characterized by a loss of previously acquired cognitive, adaptive, and social 
skills. DSRD profoundly affects individuals’ ability to engage in activities of daily living, making them highly dependent 
on their caregivers who must provide significantly more support than before the DSRD diagnosis. This study aimed to 
examine caregiver burden, quality of life, and depression among caregivers of individuals with DSRD versus caregivers 
of those with DS and other neurological disorders (DSN).

Design/Methods  In this cross-sectional study, caregivers of individuals with DSRD (n = 228) and DSN (n = 137) were 
recruited through Children’s Hospital Los Angeles neurology clinic and a Facebook DSRD support group. Participants 
completed standardized questionnaires assessing quality of life (PedsQL Family Impact Module), caregiver burden 
(Zarit Caregiver Burden Assessment, ZCB), and depression (Glasgow Depression Scale, GDS), along with additional 
items addressing other factors of caregiver well-being. Data were analyzed using bivariate comparisons and univariate 
regression models to assess differences between groups.

Results  Caregivers of individuals with DSRD were more likely than caregivers of those with DSN to report increased 
financial burden (p = 0.003), housing changes (p = 0.02), disrupted sleep (p < 0.001), negative impacts on social 
networks (p < 0.001), and worsened mental health (p < 0.001). Furthermore, DSRD caregivers reported significantly 
higher levels of burden (mean difference [95% CI]: 8.3 [6.3, 9.7]) and depression symptoms (2 [0.7, 3.4]), reflecting 
greater perceived stress and burden. They also had lower quality of life scores (-27.9 [-30.2, -25.5]), indicating a more 
substantial impact on overall well-being and daily functioning compared to DSN caregivers. Additionally, caregivers 
in the DSRD group had higher odds (odds ratio [95% CI]: 4.7 [2.9, 7.7)] of meeting clinical depression criteria (GDS 
score ≥ 13) than caregivers in the DSN group.

Conclusions  Caregivers of individuals with DSRD experience significantly greater distress and burden compared 
to those caring for individuals with DSN. The elevated risk of depression, combined with reduced quality of life and 
increased burden, underscores the multimodal nature of the challenges faced by this population.

Background
Down Syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD) is an acute 
or subacute neurocognitive regression in individuals with 
Down  syndrome  (DS),  characterized  by  a  loss  of  previ-
ously acquired cognitive, adaptive, and social skills in the 
2nd or 3rd decade of life [1, 2]. Symptoms include regres-
sion or loss of language, communication, cognition, and 
executive  function,  and  can  also  include  psychiatric 
manifestations,  bradykinesia,  catatonia,  and  rapid-onset 
insomnia [1, 2]. The severe decline in functioning caused 
by DSRD can be devastating, not only impairing the qual-
ity of life and autonomy of individuals with DS, but also 
significantly affecting their caregivers and community.

DSRD  results  in  a  profound  loss  of  ability  to  engage 
in  activities  of  daily  living,  to  the  point  where  individu-
als often become dependent on their caregivers. This can 
cause caregivers to experience sleep disturbances, finan-
cial  distress,  and  negative  impacts  to  family  dynamics 
and social networks, among other challenges [3–8]. Pro-
viding  care  is  incredibly  time  intensive  and  individuals 
with DSRD require considerably more support than they 
did  before  their  diagnosis.  In  individuals  with  DS,  mul-
tiple studies have reported an increased caregiver burden 
when  compared  to  caregivers  of  neurotypical  children 
[9].  Individuals  with  DS  have  developmental  delays  and 
multiple  chronic  medical  conditions,  which  require 
increased caregiver attention and care [10, 11]. Individu-
als  with  DS  rely  heavily  on  their  caregivers  for  many  of 
their activities of daily living, posing significant responsi-
bility to caregivers [9]. Since DSRD has additional unique 
aspects that include the sudden and severe loss of skills, 
DSRD may have distinct challenges that further intensify 
caregiver distress.

The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  elucidate  the  multifac-
eted  impacts  of  DSRD  on  caregivers  and  families.  Spe-
cifically,  it  aims  to:  (1)  compare  individuals  with  DSRD 
to those with DS and other neurological disorders (DSN) 
regarding  demographic  and  clinical  characteristics, 
while  assessing  differences  in  quality  of  life,  depression, 
and burden among their families and caregivers; and (2) 
investigate potential factors that may contribute to these 
possible differences. Understanding the extent and nature 
of familial distress in this context is crucial for developing 
targeted  interventions  and  support  systems  to  alleviate 
caregiver burden and enhance family resilience.

Methods
Regulatory approval and data availability

This study was approved by the institutional review board 
at  Children’s  Hospital  Los  Angeles  and  the  University 
of  Southern  California  (IRB  number:  CHLA-24-00184). 
Virtual  consent  was  obtained  by  caregivers  or  guard-
ians.  This  consent  consisted  of  a  standardized  webpage 
detailing  the  nature  of  the  study,  anticipated  duration, 

and  risks/benefits  of  participation  with  options  to  par-
ticipate  or  not  for  all  individuals  accessing  the  survey. 
Anonymized  data  is  available  upon  request  to  qualified 
researchers pending IRB approval.

Participants

There were two unique cohorts in this study sample: (1) 
DSRD Cohort: Caregivers of individuals with DSRD were 
recruited  from  CHLA  neurology  clinic  and  via  virtual 
recruitment on a Facebook support group for individuals 
and  caregivers  of  persons  with  DSRD.  The  recruitment 
period lasted 3 weeks (July 6, 2024, to July 28, 2024). Par-
ticipants were eligible if they had a child or family mem-
ber  who  had  a  diagnosis  of  possible  or  probable  DSRD. 
(2) DSN Cohort: Caregivers of individuals with a diagno-
sis of DS and any of the following neurologic conditions 
(i.e., moyamoya vasculopathy, epilepsy, and autism spec-
trum  disorder  (ASD))  were  recruited  during  the  same 
study  period.  Patients  had  to  have  an  active  neurologic 
problem that was symptomatic at the time of the survey 
being completed. To be eligible for this study, caregivers 
in both cohorts had to be over 18 years old and generally 
knowledgeable about their loved one’s condition.

Confirmation of diagnosis

All  caregiver  responses  for  individuals  with  DSRD  were 
evaluated  post-hoc  to  confirm  that  the  caregiver  report 
of  symptoms  was  consistent  with  consensus  criteria 
for  the  diagnosis  of  DSRD  [2].  The  survey  included  the 
DSRD  criteria  [2]  verbatim  which  was  organized  by  the 
presence  or  absence  of  sypmtoms  in  large  categories 
(e.g.,  movement  disorder)  and  respondents  were  asked 
to report if these criteria were met at the onset of symp-
toms.  This  approach  aimed  to  minimize  the  possibility 
of  collecting  data  on  individuals  without  DSRD  in  that 
cohort  and  ensure  accurate  identification  of  individuals 
meeting the criteria. This was performed by an indepen-
dent  medical  reviewer,  who  only  reviewed  clinical  data 
and  was  not  privy  to  demographic  data.  Caregivers  of 
individuals who did not meet the minimum of three core 
symptoms (minimum threshold for possible DSRD diag-
nosis)  had  their  responses  excluded.  As  the  survey  was 
anonymous,  confirmation  of  clinical  symptoms  or  fur-
ther interrogation regarding symptoms was not possible.
In the DSN cohort, diagnosis of the neurological con-
dition was by self-report only. Individuals in this cohort 
required a physician-based diagnosis in all cases.

Survey

Caregivers  completed  an  anonymous,  voluntary  online 
survey via REDCap on their levels of distress and burden 
due  to  the  DSRD  diagnosis  [12,  13]  (Appendix  A).  The 
first page of the survey was a consent with viewing of the 
questionnaire only available after completion of consent.

Demographic and clinical data were collected for all par-
ticipants  as  it  related  to  the  individual  with  DSRD  or 
DSN.  Multiple  objective  surveys  were  administered  to 
assess  caregiver  quality  of  life  (Pediatric  Quality  of  Life 
[PedsQL]  Family  Impact  Module),  depression  (Glasgow 
Depression  Scale,  GDS),  and  caregiver  burden  (Zarit 
Caregiver Burden Assessment, ZCB) [14–16].

PedsQL family impact module version 2.0

This  standardized  and  well-validated  tool  assesses  the 
impact  of  pediatric  health  conditions  on  parents  and 
families  and  has  been  validated  in  various  populations 
[16]. This assessment is widely used to evaluate caregiver 
burden  and  family  functioning,  providing  insights  into 
the emotional, social, and physical toll of caregiving. The 
PedsQL  FIM  is  a  36-item  questionnaire  with  8  different 
domains: physical functioning (6 items), emotional func-
tioning  (5  items),  social  functioning  (4  items),  cognitive 
functioning (5 items), communication (3 items), worry (5 
items), and daily activities (3 items). The PedsQL utilized 
a  5-point  Likert  scale  with  options  0  (never  a  problem) 
to  4  (almost  always  a  problem).  Total  scores  are  calcu-
lated by reverse scoring the items and linearly transform-
ing them to a 0-100 scale. Total scores are calculated by 
summing all 36 items and dividing by the total number of 
items  answered.  Domain  scores  are  obtained  by  averag-
ing the scores within each domain, providing insight into 
specific  areas.  The  parent  HRQL  (Health-Related  Qual-
ity of Life) summary score is computed as an average of 
20 items from the physical, emotional, social, and cogni-
tive functioning scales, while the family functioning sum-
mary score is calculated as the mean of 8 items from daily 
activities  and  family  relationships  scales.  All  scores  are 
based  on  items  answered,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
better adaptive functioning [16].

GDS

The GDS was an optional additional mental health ques-
tionnaire  that  was  used  to  evaluate  the  presence  and 
severity of depressive symptoms in caregivers. The GDS 
consists  of  20  items  that  ask  about  experiences  over 
the  past  week,  with  response  options  of  0  (never/no),  1 
(sometimes), and 2 (always/a lot). The total score is cal-
culated  by  summing  the  scores  across  all  items.  Higher 
scores  indicate  more  severe  depressive  symptoms,  with 
a  score  of  13  or  higher  indicating  clinically  significant 
depression. The GDS was dichotomized into two catego-
ries  (≥ 13  vs.  <  13)  to  differentiate  caregivers  with  clini-
cally significant depression from those without [14].

ZCB

The  ZCB  is  a  widely  used  and  well-validated  question-
naire  that  was  used  to  assess  the  level  of  physical,  emo-
tional,  and  financial  burden  on  caregivers.  The  ZCB  is 

composed of 22 items which are rated on a 5-point Likert 
scale  with  response  options  from  0  (never)  to  4  (nearly 
always).  The  total  ZCB  score  is  calculated  by  summing 
the scores of all 22 items, with total possible scores rang-
ing  from  0  to  88.  Higher  scores  indicate  a  greater  level 
of caregiver burden, with a score over 61 indicating high 
burden [15].

In  addition  to  the  above  standardized  metrics,  a  bat-
tery of additional questions, the DSRD Caregiver Distress 
Survey (CDS), was included to capture additional factors 
affecting  caregiver  well-being  that  were  not  addressed 
by  the  established  instruments.  The  CDS  consists  of  28 
questions  organized  into  6  sections:  financial  impact 
(4  items),  housing  (4  items),  sleep  (2–4  items),  siblings 
(1–5 items), social networks and relationships (6 items), 
and  mental  health  (8  items).  The  survey  included  ques-
tions  with  a  range  of  response  formats,  including  yes/
no, positive/negative/no change, multiple-response (e.g., 
“check  all  that  apply”),  and  open-ended  responses  to 
gather qualitative insights. Descriptive statistics were col-
lected, and raw scores were converted to a total percent 
response. Two questions within the social networks and 
relationships  section  assessed  caregivers’  primary  posi-
tive support networks before and after loved ones’ DSRD 
diagnosis,  aiming  to  capture  changes  in  sources  of  sup-
port from 10 options (e.g., friends, family, siblings, etc.). 
Total  scores  for  positive  support  networks  were  calcu-
lated by summing selected responses pre- and post-diag-
nosis, with scores ranging from 0 to 10. Individuals had 
the option to skip any question in the survey.

The  survey  automatically  closed  out  for  caregivers  of 
individuals with DSRD and DSN after they completed the 
last  metric.  Medical  records  were  not  accessed  for  this 
survey;  instead,  caregiver-reported  demographics,  clini-
cal  information  (e.g.,  neurological  diagnosis  in  the  DSN 
cohort and symptoms of DSRD in the DSRD cohort [2]), 
and objective caregiver burden metrics were used. Post-
hoc, IP addresses were referenced to ensure that multiple 
completions  of  the  survey  were  not  performed.  Cookies 
were  not  used  to  track  responses.  Completion  rate  was 
determined by dividing the number of surveys completed 
by the total number of consents obtained.

Statistical analysis

We  initially  conducted  bivariate  analyses  to  examine 
differences  in  demographic  and  clinical  characteristics 
between individuals with DSRD and DSN, as well as dif-
ferences in quality of life, depression, and caregiver bur-
den  among  their  families.  Chi-square  or  Fisher’s  exact 
tests  were  employed  for  categorical  variables,  while 
t-tests (or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for skewed distribu-
tions)  were  used  for  continuous  variables.  A  repeated 
measures  analysis  was  conducted  to  examine  changes 
in  total  positive  support  network  scores  from  pre-  to

post-diagnosis between the DSRD and DSN groups. Uni-
variate  regression  models  assessed  associations  between 
disease  diagnosis  (DSRD  vs.  DSN)  and  quality  of  life, 
familial  distress,  and  caregiver  burden.  In  particular, 
univariate linear regression analyses were performed for 
PedsQL  and  ZCB  scores,  logistic  regression  analysis  for 
GDS (≥ 13 vs. < 13), and quantile regression analysis for 
GDS  total  score.  We  further  examined  whether  poten-
tial  factors,  including  increased  financial  burden,  hous-
ing  changes,  disrupted  sleep,  negative  impacts  on  social 
networks,  and  worsened  mental  health,  modified  these 
associations by incorporating interaction terms between 
disease  diagnosis  and  each  factor  in  the  models.  Sta-
tistical  significance  was  established  a  priori  at  2-sided 
p < 0.05. All analyses were performed in Stata/MP release 
18.0 [17].

Results
Cohort demographics

In total, 365 individuals completed the survey in full. Of 
the  total  participants,  62.5%  (n = 228)  had  DSRD,  and 
37.5% (n = 137) had DSN. Caregiver-reported clinical and 
demographic  data  regarding  the  cohorts  is  presented  in 
Table  1.  In  the  DSRD  group,  more  than  two-thirds  pre-
sented altered mental status (71.1%), movement disorder 
(70.2%), language deficits (69.7%), psychiatric symptoms 
(67.1%),  and  insomnia  (65.8%),  with  nearly  half  experi-
encing  cognitive  decline  (49.1%)  and  only  4.8%  having 
focal neurologic deficits/seizure. On average, individuals 
with  DSRD  reported  five  core  “diagnostic”  symptoms  of 
the condition (SD = 1.5).12

Comparison of characteristics between cohorts

In the DSRD group, individuals were, on average, older 
than those in the DSN group (20.1 years [SD = 7.4] vs. 
16.1 years [SD = 5.3],  p < 0.001), while the groups were 
comparable  in  terms  of  sex,  ethnicity,  race,  and  dura-
tion of symptoms (Table 1).

Caregivers  of 

individuals  with  DSRD  reported 
greater  burden  than  those  caring  for  individuals  with 
DSN  (Table  2).  Notably,  DSRD  caregivers  were  more 
likely  to  experience  increased  financial  burden  (65% 
vs. 49.6%, p = 0.003), housing changes (23.1% vs. 13.1%, 
p = 0.02),  disrupted  sleep  (77.6%  vs.  22.6%,  p < 0.001), 
negative  impacts  on  social  networks  (71.1%  vs.  34.3%, 
p < 0.001),  and  worsened  mental  health  (77.5%  vs. 
21.2%,  p < 0.001).  Detailed  survey  responses  for  Ped-
sQL,  GDS,  and  ZCB  by  DSRD  and  DSN  groups  are 
presented  in Supplementary Tables  1–3.  Responses to 
questions on primary positive support networks before 
and  after  a  child’s/relative’s  diagnosis,  as  listed  the 
CDS,  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Table  4.  Care-
givers  of  individuals  with  DSRD  had  lower  scores  for 
positive  support  networks  compared  to  those  caring 

for  individuals  with  DSN,  when  comparing  pre-  to 
post-diagnosis  (mean  difference  [95%  CI]:  -0.9  [-1.2, 
-0.5)]. In particular, DSRD caregivers reported an aver-
age  change  in  positive  support  networks  of  -1.3  [-1.5, 
-1.1],  while  DSN  caregivers  reported  − 0.4  [-0.7,  -0.1], 
indicating  greater  declines  in  perceived  support  post-
diagnosis for the DSRD group.

Quality of life, distress, and care burden in DSRD and DSN

Caregivers  of  individuals  with  DSRD  reported  lower 
quality of life in the total PedsQL, parent HRQL sum-
mary, and family functioning summary scores (Fig. 1), 
as  well  as  across  all  eight  PedsQL  domains  (Fig.  2) 
compared  to  caregivers  of  those  with  DSN  (Table  1). 
Specifically,  the  average  reduction  in  total  PedsQL 
score for DSRD caregivers was − 27.9 [-30.2, -25.5], in 
the parent HRQL summary score − 31.6 [-34.3, -28.9], 
and  in  the  family  functioning  summary  score  − 19.1 
[-22.4,  -15.9],  reflecting  a  more  substantial  impact 
on  overall  well-being  and  daily  functioning  (Table  3). 
DSRD caregivers also had higher median GDS (Fig. 1; 
Table  1)  than  DSN  caregivers,  with  a  median  differ-
ence  of  2  [0.7,  3.4]  (Table  3).  They  were  also  more 
likely  to  meet  clinical  depression  criteria  (p < 0.001, 
Table  1),  with  higher  odds  of  a  GDS  score ≥ 13  (odds 
ratio  (OR)  [95%  CI]:  4.7  [2.9,  7.7];  Table  3).  Further-
more,  DSRD  caregivers  reported  higher  ZCB  scores 
compared to DSN caregivers (Fig. 1; Table 1), with an 
average increase of 8.3 [6.3, 9.7] (Table 3).

Further  analyses  (Supplementary  Tables  5  and 
Supplementary  Fig.  1)  illustrated  that  among  DSRD 
caregivers,  a  negative  change  in  social  networks  was 
associated  with  lower  mean  levels  on  PedsQL  total 
score (-6.7 [-11.6, -1.7]), parent HRQL summary score 
(-7.3  [-13.0,  -1.7]),  and  family  functioning  summary 
score (-8.2 [-15.0, -1.3]), as well as a higher mean ZCB 
score  (3.0  [0.12,  6.0])  compared  to  the  DSN  group. 
Similarly,  worsened  mental  health  was  linked  with 
lower mean levels on PedsQL total score (-10.5 [-16.0, 
-5.0]),  parent  HRQL  summary  score  (-11.7  [-18.0, 
-5.5]),  and  family  functioning  summary  score  (-11.5 
[-19.4,  -3.6]),  and  with  a  higher  mean  ZCB  score  (6.6 
[3.4,  9.8])  among  DSRD  caregivers  compared  to  DSN 
caregivers.

Financial  burden  was  also  associated  with  reduced 
mean  PedsQL  total  score  (-5.0  [-9.7,  -0.3])  and  family 
functioning  summary  score  (-9.0  [-15.6,  -2.5]),  along 
with higher mean ZCB (4.9 [2.2, 7.6]) and median GDS 
(5.0 [1.8, 8.2]) scores in DSRD caregivers compared to 
DSN  caregivers.  Disrupted  sleep  among  DSRD  care-
givers  was  linked  to  lower  mean  PedsQL  total  (-6.3 
[-11.9,  -0.7])  and  parent  HRQL  summary  (-6.9  [-13.2, 
-0.6])  scores  compared  to  DSN  caregivers.  Supple-
mentary  Fig.  1  additionally  demonstrates  significant

Discussion
Our study revealed significant differences in caregiver 
burden  and  mental  health  impacts  between  caregiv-
ers  of  individuals  with  DSRD  and  those  caring  for 
individuals  with  DSN.  Caregivers  of  individuals  with 
DSRD  experienced  greater  challenges  across  multiple 
domains,  including  financial  strain,  housing  stability, 
sleep  disruption,  social  support,  and  mental  health. 
These  caregivers  demonstrated  a  lower  quality  of  life

on  the  PedsQL,  greater  levels  of  burden  on  the  ZBS, 
and  a  higher  prevalence  of  depression  symptoms  on 
the  GDS  compared  to  DSN  caregivers.  Overall,  this 
study  underscores  the  profound  level  of  distress  and 
burden faced by caregivers of individuals with DSRD.

The  impact  of  caregiver  burden  in  this  study  was 
multimodal,  as  evidenced  by  elevated  scores  not  only 
on  the  ZBS  but  also  across  the  PedsQL,  GDS,  and 
DSRD  CDS,  indicating  a  diffuse  interruption  in  care-
giver  life.  One  possible  explanation  for  this  finding  is 
inherent  differences  in  symptoms  between  DSRD  and 
DSN.  Symptoms  of  DSRD  are  a  combination  of  cata-
tonia  and  neuropsychiatric  disease,  which  not  only 
impairs  functional  aspects  of  life  but  also  disrupts 
social  engagement  [2].  In  contrast,  individuals  with 
DSN  primarily  experience  focal  neurologic  deficits 
and/or  transient  episodes  of  neurologic  deficit  (e.g., 
seizure).  In  DSRD,  symptoms  such  as  severe  mood 
disturbances,  anxiety,  and  loss  of  previously  acquired 
skills  impair  functional  abilities,  including  mobility 
and cognitive processing, and also interfere profoundly 

with  social  engagement  and  emotional  regulation 
[1,  2].  These  symptoms  require  caregivers  to  provide 
constant,  dynamic  support  that  addresses  both  physi-
cal  and  behavioral  needs,  a  demand  that  is  less  pro-
nounced  in  the  DSN  group.  The  authors  propose  that 
the  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  in  DSRD  serve  as  the 
primary driver of this multimodal impact, which could 
explain  the  intensified  burden  on  DSRD  caregivers 
across all metrics measured in this study.

Existing  literature  suggests  that  caregivers  of  indi-
viduals  with  DSN  experience  higher  levels  of  burden 
compared  to  those  caring  for  neurotypical  individu-
als  [10,  18].  For  example,  caregivers  of  individuals 
with ASD experience increased stress due to intensive 
care  demands,  behavioral  challenges,  and  the  societal 
stigma associated with ASD [19, 20]. Similarly, caregiv-
ers  of  individuals  with  stroke  report  substantial  bur-
den  due  to  the  sudden  onset  of  care  responsibilities, 
the physical demands of caregiving, and the long-term 
nature  of  stroke  recovery  [21,  22].  Further,  caregiv-
ers  of  individuals  with  epilepsy  face  unique  stressors

Fig. 2  Distributions of PedsQL subdomains are shown via box-and-whisker plots across DSRD and DSN caregiver groups. Each plot summarizes mini-
mum, lower quantile, median (bold line), upper quantile, and maximum, along with mean shown in gray line. DSRD: Down syndrome regression disorder; 
DSN: Down syndrome with neurological disorders; and PedsQL: Pediatric quality of life– Family impact module

related  to  the  unpredictability  of  seizures,  emotional 
strain, and the need for constant vigilance, all contrib-
uting  to  elevated  caregiver  burden  [23].  However,  our 
study  found  that  caregivers  of  individuals  with  DSRD 
reported  even  higher  levels  of  burden  than  those  car-
ing  for  individuals  with  DSN,  highlighting  the  pro-
found challenges faced by this unique population.

Initially,  it  was  anticipated  that  demographic  differ-
ences,  such  as  lower  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  and 
certain ethnicity backgrounds, would link with greater 
caregiver burden, as prior research has suggested that 
lower  SES  often  is  related  to  increased  caregiver  dis-
tress [24]. However, this was not observed in our study. 
One potential explanation is that DSRD, as a relatively 
new diagnosis, may primarily be accessible to families

with  greater  resources  who  can  seek  out  the  special-
ized  care  required  for  diagnosis.  Literature  demon-
strates  that  families  with  lower  SES  often  encounter 
challenges  obtaining  timely  diagnosis  for  rare  genetic 
diseases, due to difficulties in obtaining relevant refer-
rals and delays in care, a phenomenon that may extend 
to.

DSRD [25]. Further, DSRD specialists are often only 
located  at  academic  medical  centers  across  the  coun-
try, which may be less accessible to lower SES families. 
Consequently, families of lower SES may be underrep-
resented  in  this  study  due  to  limited  access  to  DSRD 
diagnostic  and  treatment  services.  Another  possible 
explanation  is  that  the  intense  challenges  of  manag-
ing  DSRD  symptoms  may  overshadow  external  influ-
ences,  creating  a  level  of  burden  that  is  consistently 
high across demographic groups. The pervasive stress 
of  caring  for  individuals  with  DSRD  could  establish  a 
baseline  level  of  caregiver  burden  that  remains  rela-
tively  unaffected  by  socioeconomic  variations  such  as 
income or education.

This  study  is  not  without  limitations,  as  it  is  an  ini-
tial  investigation  into  the  impacts  of  DSRD  on  care-
givers.  Bias  may  have  affected  our  findings.  Firstly, 
severity bias may have impacted the results, as caregiv-
ers  of  individuals  with  more  severe  DSRD  symptoms 
might have been more likely to participate, potentially 
skewing  the  results  toward  higher  perceived  burdens. 
Additionally,  ascertainment  bias  could  arise  since  the 
caregiver burden measures were self-reported and per-
ception of caregiving responsibilities may differ among 
participants.  The  study  also  relied  on  retrospective 
reflection, which could introduce cognitive bias, lead-
ing  participants  to  misremember,  misinterpret,  or 
overinterpret  their  caregiving  experiences.  Further-
more,  selection  bias  could  be  present,  as  the  patient 
population  was  recruited  from  a  DSRD  Facebook 
support  group,  potentially  limiting  the  demographic 
diversity  and  socioeconomic  representation.  Frequent 
participation in surveys over the past few years might 
have  contributed  to  survey  fatigue,  lowering  enroll-
ment rates and affecting the sample size and diversity. 
In addition, the DSN cohort was composed of a heter-
ogenous  group  of  conditions  which  affect  individuals 
with  DS.  While  these  conditions  did  not  statistically 
differ  with  regards  to  responses  in  this  study,  further 
expansion  and  comparison  to  non-DS  cohorts  (e.g., 
individuals  with  epilepsy  without  DS)  will  be  benefi-
cial. Finally, the accuracy of the cohort may have been 
affected  by  the  inability  to  confirm  both  DSRD  and 
DSN  diagnoses  on  a  medical  basis.  These  limitations 
may affect the generalizability of the findings.

Conclusions
In  summary,  this  study  reveals  a  concerning  theme 
wherein  caregivers  of  individuals  with  DSRD  experi-
ence  a  significantly  greater  burden  compared  to  care-
givers of those with DSN. These findings highlight the 
need  for  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  unique  chal-
lenges  faced  by  caregivers  of  individuals  with  DSRD 
and the urgent need for targeted support.
