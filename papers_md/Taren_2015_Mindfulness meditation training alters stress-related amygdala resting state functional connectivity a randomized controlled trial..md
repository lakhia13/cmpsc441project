Abstract

Recent studies indicate that mindfulness meditation training interventions reduce stress and improve stress-related health
outcomes, but the neural pathways for these effects are unknown. The present research evaluates whether mindfulness
meditation training alters resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala, a region known to coordinate stress
processing and physiological stress responses. We show in an initial discovery study that higher perceived stress over the
past month is associated with greater bilateral amygdala-subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) rsFC in a sample of
community adults (n ¼ 130). A follow-up, single-blind randomized controlled trial shows that a 3-day intensive mindfulness
meditation training intervention (relative to a well-matched 3-day relaxation training intervention without a mindfulness
component) reduced right amygdala-sgACC rsFC in a sample of stressed unemployed community adults (n ¼ 35). Although
stress may increase amygdala-sgACC rsFC, brief training in mindfulness meditation could reverse these effects. This work
provides an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training promotes functional neuroplastic changes, suggesting
an amygdala-sgACC pathway for stress reduction effects.

Introduction

There has been significant recent interest in identifying inter-
ventions and pathways for stress resilience in at-risk individ-
uals (Feder et al., 2009; Bonanno et al., 2011). Recent studies
suggest that mindfulness meditation interventions, which train

the capacity to be more open and aware of present-moment
experience, may increase stress resilience (Ludwig and Kabat-
Zinn, 2008; Creswell, 2014). For example, RCTs show that mind-
fulness meditation training interventions reduce reactivity to
acute stressors (Nyklı´cˇek et al., 2013; Creswell et al., 2014) and

improve health outcomes in stress-related disorders and dis-
eases (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD, HIV-infection: Teasdale
et al., 2000; Creswell et al., 2009; Ho¨ lzel et al., 2013; King et al.,
2013). Moreover, cumulative evidence has linked individual
differences in stress reactivity and the experience of stress to a
broad range of physiological health outcomes (Everson-Rose
and Lewis, 2005; Cohen et al., 2007; Gianaros and Sheu, 2009;
Miller et al., 2009; McEwen and Gianaros, 2010). Although
there has been significant progress in understanding the
neurobiology of mindfulness meditation training effects (Tang
et al., 2015), there is still relatively little work directly relating
the neural mechanisms of mindfulness training and stress
resilience.

Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) methods provide
one approach for interrogating how mindfulness alters neural
dynamics among stress-responsive brain regions. RsFC metrics
of inter-regional dynamics specifically afford the advantage of
being task-independent, providing reliable estimates of neural
circuit functionality corresponding to structural topography
(Fox and Raichle, 2007; Greicius, 2008). Here, we tested the
extent to which mindfulness alters stress-related amygdala
rsFC for three reasons: (i) The amygdala is a cell complex that is
centrally involved in processing psychological stressors and
coordinating physiological stress responses (LeDoux 1994;
Arnsten 2009). (ii) Recent studies show that greater reported
mindfulness is associated with reduced amygdala volumes and
task-based amygdala activation (Goldin and Gross 2010; Ho¨ lzel
et al., 2010; Way et al., 2010; Taren et al., 2013; Desbordes et al.,
2012). (iii) Anatomical studies in animal models indicate robust
amygdala connectivity to other brain regions considered to be
integral for processing stressors and orchestrating stress reac-
tions [e.g. anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal
cortex, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and pontine/me-
dullary autonomic control regions]
(Ulrich-Lai and Herman,
2009; McEwen and Gianaros, 2010). Moreover, recent human
studies have shown that amygdala functional connectivity with
the ACC is associated with greater stressor-evoked physio-
logical reactivity (Gianaros et al., 2008) and amygdala-ACC func-
tional connectivity is enhanced after acute stress exposures
(Van Marle et al., 2010; Veer et al., 2011).

Accordingly, to test whether mindfulness reduces stress-
related amygdala-ACC rsFC, we conducted two studies: (i) an
initial discovery study evaluated whether self-reported per-
ceived stress was associated with greater amygdala-ACC rsFC in
a large sample of community volunteers (n ¼ 130). Although
some human studies implicate increased stress-related amyg-
dala rsFC with spatially adjacent areas of the ACC (e.g. Gianaros
et al., 2008), the discovery study tested for associations between
perceived stress (and mindfulness) with amygdala rsFC across
the whole brain. (ii) We then conducted a randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) of mindfulness meditation training (compared
with a matched relaxation training intervention without a
mindfulness component) in a high-stress unemployed commu-
nity sample to test whether mindfulness training prospectively
reduces stress-related amygdala-ACC rsFC.

Methods

Discovery study

Participants, procedure and analysis. 133 healthy adults were re-
cruited from the community by mass mailings to residents of
Allegheny County, PA (3 participants were removed due to poor
co-registration during preprocessing, resulting in a final sample

of n ¼ 130). This discovery study was drawn from a larger on-
going NIH-funded parent study focused on understanding the
neurobiological, psychosocial and behavioral correlates of
health among community adults (the Pittsburgh Imaging
Project). Demographic characteristics of this study sample are
provided in Table 1. All participants gave written informed con-
sent as part of protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon
University. Inclusion criteria included no history of (i) cardio-
vascular disease (including treatment for or diagnoses of hyper-
tension, stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure
and atrial or ventricular arrhythmias); (ii) prior neurosurgery or
neurological disorder; (iii) current treatment for or self-reported
psychiatric disorder; (iv) typical consumption of >15 alcoholic
beverages per week; (v) daily use of corticosteroid inhaler; (vi)
current use of psychotropic, lipid lowering or any cardiovascular
medication, including any medication to control blood pressure;
(vii) metal implants or exposure; (viii) colorblindness; and (ix)
claustrophobia. All participants were right-handed, as assessed
by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971).
Women were excluded if pregnant (verified by urine test).
Participants completed a psychosocial survey battery, which
included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS is a 10-item
questionnaire measuring the frequency of stressful feelings and
thoughts within the last month (0 ¼ Never, 4 ¼ Very Often). Four
of the items are reverse-scored and an overall composite meas-
ure is computed, with higher values indicating a greater per-
ceived stress (Cohen et al., 1983).

were realigned to the first image of the series, corrected for dis-
tortion due to movement, and spatial normalized to the

was conducted using the structural gray matter image seg-
mented from the T1-weighted MPRAGE image; the structural
gray matter image was co-registered with the mean realigned

malized BOLD images were smoothed with a 6-mm full-width
at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel for statistical ana-
lysis. In the CONN toolbox, structural MPRAGE images were seg-

fluid areas. A time series was extracted from each region of
resting state data.
interest using functional BOLD fMRI
Additional preprocessing was carried out in the CONN toolbox
to account for further temporal confounding factors, including
BOLD signal from the subject-specific white matter and CSF
masks, motion parameters (six dimensions), and the effect of
rest (an average across the session) to account for global signal.
A covariate for each subject’s head motion was entered at the
first level. A band-pass filter of 0.008–0.09 Hz was used. The
CONN toolbox estimates orthogonal time series using principal
component analysis of the BOLD signal in each noise ROI.

At the single subject level, functional connectivity was
measured by calculating the average BOLD time series across all
voxels in each seed region and calculating a bivariate correl-
ation between each seed region of interest and every other
voxel. A hemodynamic response function was used to down
weight the initial scans within each resting state block to min-
imize potential ramping effects. Left and right amygdala seeds
were anatomically defined using the Wake Forest University
(WFU) pickatlas (Maldjian et al., 2003) for generating whole-brain
rsFC maps in CONN, which were then related to PSS scores as a
covariate of interest in separate group-level general
linear
model analyses. Whole-brain analyses relating PSS to left and
right amygdala rsFC were conducted using a discovery thresh-
old of uncorrected P < 0.001 and k > 30.

RCT of mindfulness meditation training

Participants. Thirty-five stressed unemployed job-seeking com-
munity adults (who indicated moderate to high levels of per-
ceived job-seeking stress over the past month, scoring > 9 on an
adapted four-item PSS for job-seeking stress; a ¼ 0.55) partici-
pated in a single-blind RCT of 3-day intensive mindfulness
meditation or relaxation training intervention (see Table 2 for
participant characteristics). Participants were recruited via
newspaper advertisements and through employment agencies
in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants were English-speaking, had no
pre-existing health conditions, were willing and available to
participate in all study assessments, and were willing to be ran-
domly assigned to one of two study conditions. Callers who met
these qualifications were invited to come to Carnegie Mellon
University for an in-person screening interview and baseline as-
sessment. A more in-depth screening interview followed,
including assessments of basic cognitive ability, right- or left-
handedness and internal metal content (for fMRI eligibility),
employment background (to probe for unemployment-related
stress), medical history and health behavior. Subjects taking
psychotropic medications were excluded. Figure 1 depicts the
flow of participants through the RCT. This study was approved
by the Carnegie Mellon University Internal Review Board and all
participants provided informed consent.

Procedure. We conducted this RCT between December 2010 and
October 2011. Beginning 4 weeks before the 3-day training inter-
vention, participants completed a baseline neuroimaging ses-
sion. All participants began with a 5-min resting state scan
(where they passively viewed a fixation cross), followed by three

Task), and a 7-min perfusion MRI scan with a guided awareness
of breathing task (the results of these functional tasks are not
reported here). After neuroimaging, participants were invited to
a nearby residential retreat center where they were randomized
to either a 3-day intensive mindfulness meditation training
(n ¼ 18) or matched 3-day relaxation residential retreat interven-
tion (n ¼ 17). Only the participant, project manager, treatment
program staff members and the treatment program instructor
were aware of the participant’s study condition. All other study
personnel responsible for collecting study assessments re-
mained blinded. Participants returned for a neuroimaging as-
sessment within 2 weeks of completing the 3-day intervention
and completed an identical scanning procedure as at baseline,
including the same 5-min resting state scan. At both neuroi-
maging sessions, participants were instructed to passively view
a fixation cross during the resting state scan period and not to
sleep or engage in any meditation or relaxation practices (which
were verbally confirmed in all participants at the conclusion of
the neuroimaging session). In total 97% of randomized partici-
pants were retained at the post-intervention neuroimaging as-
sessment (3% study attrition, see Figure 1). As part of the larger
study, participants completed a comprehensive battery of psy-
chosocial measures and provided a blood draw at baseline and
at 4-month follow-up; the present report focuses on testing how
mindfulness meditation training changes rsFC patterns using
the 5-min resting state BOLD scan at baseline and in the
2 weeks
following the 3-day intensive training period
(post-intervention). In order to measure cumulative hypothal-
amic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation over the 4-month
follow-up period, participants were invited to provide a hair
sample at the 4-month follow-up appointment (Dettenborn
et al., 2010; Stalder and Kirschbaum, 2012).

Interventions. We adapted the standardized and manualized 8-
week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program
(which includes a day-long retreat) (Kabat-Zinn, 1982, 1990) into
a condensed 3-day residential retreat format, entitled Health
Enhancement through Mindfulness (HEM). Delivery of the HEM
program in a structured residential retreat format improves
compliance with training, reduces treatment attrition and
greater experimental control is afforded by offering a parallel
matched relaxation training retreat (in a separate wing of the
retreat center). The HEM instructor was a doctoral level psych-
ologist with 7 years of MBSR teaching experience. Subjects were
not informed that the mindfulness intervention was called
HEM, so as to avoid any non-specific demand characteristics.
Briefly, the HEM program consists of mindfulness training
through body scan awareness exercises, sitting and walking
meditations, mindful eating and mindful movement (gentle
hatha yoga postures). After each formal meditation period, par-
ticipants engaged in discussion of their observations about
themselves and the practices. The instructor modeled and
encouraged attitudes to foster mindfulness such as letting go of
judgment and expectations, cultivating self-care, patience and
friendly curiosity toward present moment experience. On the
third day, formal meditation practices were extended to discus-
sions about how participants could use mindful awareness for
their unemployment and job-seeking stress.

We developed a structurally matched Health Enhancement
through Relaxation (HER) program that included similar behav-
ioral training activities (e.g. walking, stretching and didactics) as
HEM, but all trainings emphasized participation in these activ-
ities in a restful way rather than a mindful way. The HER pro-
gram instructor was a licensed social worker with over 2

Image acquisition

Structural and functional images were acquired on a Siemens
Verio 3 T scanner using a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution
T1-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired at the start of
the scanning session, with a slice orientation of AC-PC aligned,
temporal lobes up (TR ¼ 1800 ms, TE ¼ 2.22 ms, flip angle ¼ 9(cid:3),

number of slices ¼ 36, FOV ¼ 205 mm, 3.2-mm thick slices EPI
with rate 2 GRAPPA, voxel size ¼ 3.2 (cid:2) 3.2 (cid:2) 3.2 mm).

Image pre-processing

Functional BOLD data were processed using SPM8 (Welcome
Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; implemented
by MATLAB, MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). First, the data
were realigned to the mean image of the first run and then
smoothed with a 4-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel to be in the pre-
ferred format for the motion correction program, ArtRepair.
Data were then submitted to motion correction using the
ArtRepair utility (Mazaika et al., 2007, 2009), an interpolation-
based motion correction utility program. Motion correction in
ArtRepair follows a two-step process. In the first step, an algo-
rithm is applied to each run of data to suppress interpolation
errors due to large motion. The algorithm applies a larger cor-
rection to edge-wise voxels than to central voxels, since the

effects of motion on BOLD signal are most pronounced in these
areas. In the second step, TRs with large amounts of fast motion
or large global signal variation are flagged for repair. A default
motion threshold of 1 mm was used, so that TRs with motion
>1 mm were flagged for repair. Repair of the data was done
through linear interpolation, so that volumes flagged for repair
were filled in with the average signal value from the two nearest
unrepaired TRs. To quantify head motion that could appreciably
impact artifactual signal in our rsFC analyses, we had a hypoth-
esis- and condition-blind coder count total fast head motion
TRs for each subject at each resting state scan time point (quan-
tified as a TR–TR change of 0.25 mm or 0.25(cid:3) rotation in any
plane). A mixed linear model analysis indicated there were no
head motion differences between groups (condition main effect
P ¼ 0.97) and no differential fast head motion change over time
(condition (cid:2) time interaction P ¼ 0.98). After motion correction
the functional data was normalized to the standard MNI
Template T1 template using indirect normalization, in which
the functionals are first coregistered to the MPRAGE, and then
the MPRAGE is normalized to the T1 template. Finally, the
images were smoothed a second time with a 7-mm FWHM ker-
nel, resulting in an overall FWHM smoothing of 8 mm (Mazaika
et al., 2007).

Connectivity and data analyses

Left and right amygdala seeded resting state BOLD fMRI images
were generated in the CONN toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli and
Nieto-Castanon, 2012) (using the same procedures as the dis-
covery study), which were then applied in a group-level flexible
factorial analysis in SPM8 with two factors specified, time (pre-
and post-intervention) and group (HEM vs HER groups). We
generated a time-by-group spreading (or ordinal) interaction
contrast that tested for baseline to post-intervention decreases
in rsFC in the HEM program (relative to the HER program, in
which we did not expect to see this rsFC decrease) using

ment groups at post-treatment only (such as using post only

to evaluate change over time. The discovery study indicated
stress-related bilateral amygdala-sgACC rsFC, thus we pursued
amygdala rsFC analyses with a bilateral anatomical (AAL atlas)
ACC ROI [defined by the WFU Pickatlas (Maldjian et al., 2003)] in
the mindfulness meditation training RCT. Cluster-level correc-
tion for multiple comparisons was obtained using a Monte
Carlo simulation implemented by AlphaSim (National Institute
of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). AlphaSim was implemented

with a bilateral ACC mask generated from the AAL atlas using
an 8 mm smoothing kernel and 10 000 iterations. Significant
clusters (P < 0.05, corrected) were defined as those involving
k > 27 contiguous voxels, each at P < 0.005.

Measuring stress in the mindfulness meditation
training RCT: hair sampling

In order to evaluate whether changes in amygdala-ACC rsFC
prospectively predict stress-related biomarkers after mindful-
ness meditation training, we conducted an exploratory analysis
testing whether pre- to post-intervention changes in rsFC were
associated with hair-derived cumulative measures of HPA-axis
activation during the 4-month follow-up period (Stalder and
Kirschbaum, 2012). Hair samples have been used to measure
cumulative HPA-axis activation, with approximately 1 cm of
hair length corresponding to one month of HPA-axis activity.
Recent studies indicate higher HPA-axis activation among the
unemployed relative to employed adults in hair samples
(Dettenborn et al., 2010). Hair was acquired and assayed using
standard procedures described by Kirschbaum and colleagues
(2009, 2010). Briefly, about 40 hairs were cut with scissors as
close to the back of the scalp as possible from a posterior vertex
position. The follicle end of each hair sample was labeled and
clipped to a piece of aluminum foil and then sent to a special-
ized laboratory in Dresden, Germany for assay. Each sample
was washed, dried,
steroid extraction
(see Dettenborn et al., 2010). Cortisone and cortisol determin-
ation was then assessed using a commercially available
immunoassay (with chemiluminescence detection, CLIA-
IBL-Hamburg, Germany). The lab reports intra-assay and inter-
assay coefficients of variance as below 8%.

and spun for

Data on demographic and lifestyle factors that consistently af-
fect hair glucocorticoid levels is limited, but previous studies sug-
gest that age, gender and exercise volume (as vigorous exercise is
associated with HPA axis activation) may be associated with hair
cortisol (Raul et al., 2004; Russell et al., 2012; Skoluda et al., 2012;
Stalder and Kirschbaum, 2012). Thus, participant age, gender and
frequency of vigorous exercise were included as covariates in hair
analyses in order to reduce noise attributable to these potential
confounding factors. We analyzed both hair cortisone and corti-
sol; both are glucocorticoids released by the adrenal glands, with
similar physiologic functions. Although cortisol is the more active
form; previous research reports that hair cortisone may be higher
than hair cortisol (as opposed to in plasma, where cortisol con-
centrations are higher than cortisone) due to increased activity of
the enzyme responsible for converting cortisol to cortisone in the
hair bulb (Tiganescu et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2012). We first con-
ducted a one-way ANCOVA comparing the mindfulness to relax-
ation groups on hair-derived measures of cortisone and cortisol at
the 4-month follow-up appointment. Parameter estimates were
then extracted in SPM8 using cluster analysis centered on the
peak voxel
in subgenual ACC at baseline and post-training.
Exploratory analyses then tested whether greater pre-post
(change score) training-related changes in amygdala-ACC rsFC co-
varied with lower levels of these hair-derived markers of cumula-
tive HPA-axis activation at 4-month follow-up. Specifically, asso-
ciations between hair cortisone, cortisol and post-pre training
change in functional connectivity across groups were examined
using bivariate Pearson correlation analyses. In total n ¼ 4 partici-
pants were unable or unwilling to provide hair samples at the 4-
month follow-up time point, and were excluded from these ana-
lyses. Statistical analyses were carried out in SPSS with a signifi-
cance threshold of P < 0.05.

Results

Discovery study results

A whole-brain analysis indicated a positive association between
perceptions of stress over the previous month and greater amyg-
dala coupling with the sgACC. Specifically, higher levels of stress
were associated with increased rsFC between right amygdala and
subgenual ACC (sgACC) (MNI: 0, 16, (cid:4)13, k ¼ 120 voxels), the only
region of significant correlation with the right amygdala in a
whole-brain analysis (P < 0.001, uncorrected) (Figure 2a, Table 3).
Although smaller in spatial extent, greater self-reported stress
was also associated with increased left amygdala-sgACC (MNI: 1,
22, (cid:4)4, k ¼ 24 voxels) rsFC (P < 0.001, uncorrected) (Figure 2b).
Higher levels of self-reported perceived stress were also associ-
ated with greater left amygdala rsFC with perigenual right ACC,
left parahippocampal gyrus, left insula, and right superior tem-
poral cortex in the discovery study (Table 4).

Mindfulness meditation training RCT Results

Building on the discovery study findings showing that stress
was associated with greater amygdala-sgACC rsFC, it was pre-
dicted that mindfulness meditation training (relative to a well-
matched relaxation training program without a mindfulness
component), would decrease right amygdala-sgACC rsFC in
stressed, unemployed community adults. Consistent with this
prediction, a flexible factorial random effects analysis showed
that a 3-day intensive mindfulness meditation training program
reduced right amygdala-sgACC (MNI: 0, 18, (cid:4)12) rsFC, compared
with relaxation training without a mindfulness component
(time (cid:2) treatment interaction P < 0.05, k ¼ 28, corrected for mul-
tiple comparisons) (Table 3, Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3, we
observed positive right amygdala-sgACC rsFC pre-intervention
in this high stress unemployed sample, which is consistent
with the discovery study findings suggesting that stress is asso-
ciated with elevated amygdala-sgACC rsFC (there were no sig-
nificant difference in right amygdala-sgACC connectivity
between the HEM and HER groups at baseline, P ¼ 0.877). But
notably this was a spreading interaction driven by mindfulness
meditation training reductions in right amygdala rsFC at post-
treatment (Figure 3). A parallel flexible factorial random effects
analysis also tested for training related changes in left amyg-
dala-ACC rsFC, but there were no significant differential de-
creases in left amygdala-ACC rsFC pre-post
training (no
significant time (cid:2) treatment interaction). Although the primary
intent was to test for stress-related amygdala-ACC rsFC in an
ACC ROI analysis, exploratory uncorrected whole-brain results
are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Change in amygdala rsFC co-vary with biomarkers of
stress

An exploratory analysis evaluated whether hair-derived
markers of cumulative HPA-axis were associated with brain ac-
tivation during the 4-month follow-up period. There were no
statistically significant differences between the mindfulness
meditation and relaxation groups in cortisone [one-way
ANCOVA F(1,25) ¼ 0.08, P ¼ 0.779; mindfulness group M ¼ 54.99,
SE ¼ 43.63; relaxation group M ¼ 72.12, SE ¼ 40.75] or cortisol
[one-way ANCOVA F(1,25) ¼ 0.783, P ¼ 0.385; mindfulness group
M ¼ 52.80, SE ¼ 12.31; relaxation group M ¼ 37.72, SE ¼ 11.50] at
4-month follow-up. However, pre- or post-intervention
decreases in amygdala-sgACC rsFC were associated with less
cumulative HPA-axis activation in hair across all subjects.

Discussion

We provide an initial indication that alterations in amygdala-
ACC rsFC track with perceived stress and can be altered by a
mindfulness meditation intervention. Specifically, self-reported
perceived stress was found to be associated with greater amyg-
dala-sgACC rsFC. Moreover, mindfulness meditation training
decreased amygdala-sgACC functional coupling relative to a well-
matched comparison relaxation treatment without a mindful-
ness component. These findings agree with a neural circuitry-
based account of previous studies suggesting that mindfulness
alters amygdala structure and function (Creswell et al., 2007;
Goldin and Gross, 2010; Ho¨ lzel et al., 2010; Way et al., 2010; Taren
et al., 2013), identifying a candidate amygdala-sgACC pathway
that may link mindfulness training with reduced stress and
stress-related health outcomes (Ludwig and Kabat-Zinn, 2008;
Creswell, 2014). Although brain regions other than the amygdala
are involved in stress reactivity, our approach was to first identify
a candidate stress processing region that is central for gating
stress responding (i.e. the amygdala) (Arnsten, 2009; Ulrich-Lai
and Herman, 2009; McEwen and Gianaros, 2010) and test how
trained mindfulness alters stress-related rsFC.

This discovery study indicates a positive association
between perceived stress and amygdala–sgACC coupling. This
finding is in accord with several studies, which link the right
amygdala and ACC to stress. Specifically, the amygdala has
well-known anatomical connectivity with regions of ACC
(Carmichael and Price, 1996; Ongu¨ r et al., 1998; Freedman et al.,
2000; Johansen-Berg et al., 2008), including sgACC (Freedman
et al., 2000; Johansen-Berg et al., 2008)—and neurobiological
accounts highlight the importance of amygdala and ACC/medial
PFC networks
stress
response cascades via activation of the HPA and sympathetic-
adrenal-medullary axes (Arnsten, 2009). ACC regions spatially
similar to regions identified in this study have been implicated
in stress responding; stressor-evoked physiological reactivity
has been positively associated with right amygdala-perigenual
ACC connectivity (Gianaros et al., 2008). One important question
for the present work is whether mindfulness training related
changes in amygdala-sgACC rsFC could be prospectively driving

fight-or-flight

in driving

central

changes in stress. We provide some initial suggestive evidence
that pre-post training related decreases in right amygdala-
sgACC are associated with lower cumulative markers of
HPA-axis activation over the 4-month follow-up period in the
mindfulness meditation RCT study. However, this exploratory
analysis should be viewed with some caution (and tested in
new studies) given the lack of any robust training differences
between the mindfulness meditation and relaxation conditions
in these cumulative HPA-axis activation biomarkers, and the
small subsample who provided hair samples at 4-month follow-
up in the RCT study (n ¼ 30).

One limitation of the present research is that there were no
stress-related disease outcomes in the RCT study with high
stress community adults, and thus no way to evaluate whether
mindfulness training changes in amygdala rsFC might drive
potential improvements in stress-related disease. Nonetheless,
this work offers a novel candidate pathway for explaining how
mindfulness interventions benefit stress sensitive psychiatric
populations. Previous studies have implicated disrupted rsFC in
stress-related psychiatric disorders (e.g. PTSD, generalized anx-
iety disorder, major depressive disorder) (Mayberg, 2003; Bluhm
et al., 2009; Etkin et al., 2009; Lanius et al., 2010), and recent RCTs
indicate robust effects of mindfulness training on improving
psychiatric outcomes in these same patient groups (Ma and
Teasdale, 2004; Bhatnagar et al., 2013; Hoge et al., 2013; King
et al., 2013; Zeidan et al., 2013). Moreover, higher levels of self-re-
ported perceived stress have been linked to poorer mental and
physical health outcomes (Keller et al., 2012). This research
offers a testable new prediction for future studies; namely,
mindfulness interventions may reduce amygdala-sgACC rsFC,
which serves as a neurobiological mechanism for improve-
ments in emotion regulation, stress reactivity and improved
stress-related health and disease outcomes.

There has been a recent interest in how mindfulness medita-
tion alters structural and functional activity in the ACC. For ex-
integrative mind-body meditation training has been
ample,
shown to increase network efficiency and connectivity of the
ACC (Xue et al., 2011) and recent work has shown that this form
of meditation training increases white matter integrity in the cor-
ona radiata—the major tract projecting through ACC (Tang et al.,
2010). Notably, sgACC is thought to be an important hub in net-
works for negative affect and mood disorders (Mayberg, 2003;
Seminowicz et al., 2004) and anatomical studies have shown dir-
ect connections between sgACC and the amygdala, hypothal-
amus, nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex (whereas
pregenual ACC is more strongly connected to medial prefrontal

1766 | Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 2015, Vol. 10, No. 12

and mid-cingulate cortex, sgACC and subcortical regions) (Chiba
et al., 2001). In combination, these studies and our work here sug-
gest potential dissociable effects of mindfulness meditation train-
ing on spatially distinct regions of ACC; such as mindfulness
meditation training increasing rsFC on more dorsal and prege-
nual ACC tracts associated with enhanced self-regulation (Tang
et al., 2010; cf. Hasenkamp and Barsalou, 2012) and pain modula-
tion (Zeidan et al., 2011), while also decreasing stress-related func-
tional connectivity of the sgACC with the amygdala. Together,
this work suggests the possibility that mindfulness meditation
training fosters dorsal/pregenual ACC connectivity for attention
monitoring while decoupling stress-related sgACC connectivity
for stress resilience.

An important limitation of the present seed-based rsFC ana-
lytic approach is that it precludes inferences about the directional-
in the future, effective
ity of amygdala-sgACC connectivity;
connectivity analyses (e.g. with dynamic causal modeling) offer
opportunities to test causal interactions between these stress-sen-
sitive nodes. Moreover, we utilized 5-min resting state scans; lon-
ger scans periods as well as cardiorespiratory data can be used to
reduce measurement error in future studies (Birn et al., 2006, 2013).
Our aim in this study was to reveal stable stress-related rsFC
changes by using the PSS as a measure of stress symptoms over
the past month (Liston et al., 2009); however, the scanner environ-
ment itself can be stress-inducing, and the lack of a state-stress
scanner measure in this study does not allow us to fully exclude
potential state-stress effects. An additional limitation is the lack of
inclusion of a usual care group, which would provide an additional
level of comparison to the HER and HEM intervention groups,
allowing examination of the effects of attending a 3-day relaxation
retreat and the potential stress-buffering gained from this (above
and beyond no intervention). Given prohibitive cost and subject
burden concerns, hair samples were not collected at time 1, only
at 4-month follow-up; thus, our analyses are necessarily limited to
relating change in amygdala-ACC rsFC to cortisone and cortisol
levels at follow-up. Finally, this work more broadly suggests a new
amygdala rsFC pathway for stress resilience; future work should
evaluate whether similar changes in amygdala rsFC can be
achieved with other clinically impactful psychological interven-
tions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) or anxiolytic pharmaco-
logical treatments in at-risk stressed populations.

Conclusions

The present findings significantly advance our understanding
of rsFC in stress and mindfulness training interventions, and
implicate decoupling of the amygdala and sgACC as a potential
neurobiological mechanism underlying mindfulness training
intervention effects.
