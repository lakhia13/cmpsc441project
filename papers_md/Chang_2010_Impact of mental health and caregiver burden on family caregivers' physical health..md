Caregivers providing care to chronically ill family members at home are potentially at risk for caregiver
burden and declining physical and psychological health. This study aims to understand how family
caregivers’ mental health and caregiver burden affects physical health simultaneously, controlling for
factors such as age, education level, caring hours per day, and emotional, functional, and physical support
systems used by caregivers. We recruited 388 caregivers from Kaohsiung and Pingtong region in Taiwan.
Caregivers had to be 18 years or older and spend most of their time taking care of an ill family member at
home. Mental health was assessed by the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and burden
was measured using a modiﬁed scale for caregiver’s burden. Health status was assessed by self-
perceived health (SPH), illness symptoms and the number of diagnosed chronic diseases. A high number
of hours per day of caregiving was associated with low emotional support and SPH, poor mental health
and high burden. Higher emotional support was associated with better mental health and fewer illness
symptoms. Higher physical support was associated with poorer mental health, higher burden, a greater
number of illness symptoms and chronic diseases, and a lower SPH score. Hours per day of caregiving,
and use of emotional, functional, and physical support were associated with mental health, and the hours
per day of caregiving and use of physical support were predictors of burden. Mental health and burden
were signiﬁcantly associated with caregivers’ health problems simultaneously. Our results show the
important inﬂuence of mental health on caregivers’ physical health. Interventions for caregivers need to
target health in a holistic way.

1. Introduction

1.1. Impacts of caregiving

Caregivers who provide care to a chronically ill

family
member at home are potentially at risk for caregiver burden
and declining physical and mental health. Family caregivers of
older people with disabilities report burden and stress as a
consequence of caregiving, which in turn contributes to
psychiatric morbidity (Schulz and Beach, 1999). Both caregiver’s
health and the recipient’s health have a strong inﬂuence on
caregiver burden (Bull, 1990). Caregivers often neglect their
own health and hide information about their health problems
(Ward-Grifﬁn and McKeever, 2000). For family caregivers,
burden comes from many different sources. Researchers have
tried to investigate caregiver burden in order to design programs
to ease burden.

Many studies have investigated how a caregiver’s burden
affects different aspects of his or her life (Pickett et al., 1997;
Song et al., 1997; Happe and Berger, 2002; Morimoto et al.,
2003). In these studies, burden was a mediator of other outcome
variables and was shown to be strongly related to sleep
disturbances (Happe and Berger, 2002) and depressive symp-
toms in caregivers (Song et al., 1997). Burden is negatively
related to health-related quality of life, particularly mental
health (Morimoto et al., 2003). Furthermore, burden is
negatively associated with caregivers’ positive appraisal of their
relationships with their ill family members (Pickett et al., 1997).
Efforts have been made to reduce the burden of care in carers
(Marriott et al., 2000).

Caring for ill family members can have negative impacts on
caregivers’ mental health (Schulz et al., 1990). One study found
that dementia patients’ caregivers appeared more vulnerable to
depression as a consequence of their experience (Waite et al.,
2004). Another study observed that caregivers providing care to a
family member with dementia at home had higher levels of

268

H.-Y. Chang et al. / Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics 50 (2010) 267–271

depression than those whose family members were in an
institution (Grunfeld et al., 1997). White et al. (2003) found that
caregivers of people who had suffered a stroke had lower mental-
health-related quality of life compared to their counterparts who
were not caregivers. Another study used the same questionnaire
(SF-36) to measure caregivers’ health-related quality of life, and
found that caregivers of people with cerebrovascular disease or
diabetes had signiﬁcantly negative mental-health-related quality
of life (Li et al., 2004).

The physical consequences of caregiving have received less
attention than psychiatric outcomes. One study indicated that
caregivers often experience several physical problems, including
back injuries, arthritis, high blood pressure, gastric ulcers, and
headaches (Sawatzky and Fowler-Kerry, 2003). Although these
physical problems may not be directly caused by caregiving
responsibilities, they are likely aggravated by them. Other research
has found that the physical health of caregivers of long-term
patients declined after the patients were discharged from hospital
(Douglas and Daly, 2003). These studies indicate that caring for an
ill family member at home is negatively related to physical health.
The causal relationship between health and caregiving burden
is unclear, that is, whether poor health leads to burden or whether
caregiving burden has a negative effect on health remains to be
clariﬁed (Nijboer et al., 1998). Caregiving burden, in terms of
physical strain, has been found to predict caregivers’ perceived
health (Beach et al., 2000). On the other hand, Stommel et al.
(1999) reported that mental health, in terms of depression, could
predict burden. According to Bull (1990), caregiver’s health is a
factor that contributes to burden.

1.2. Social support and burden

Social support may have a buffering effect on caregiver burden.
One study found that social support was negatively associated
with caregiver’s burden; that is, caregivers who obtained more
social support reported less burden (Song et al., 1997). Strong
relationships between the availability of support systems and
caregiver distress have been reported (Pohl et al., 1994; Li et al.,
1997; Sander et al., 1997; Edwards and Scheetz, 2002). Instru-
mental, emotional, and informational support are the most
commonly cited functional dimensions of social support systems
(Chak, 1996). Thompson et al. (1993), who studied the relationship
between the functions of social support and caregiver burden,
reported that not all functions were equally associated with
caregiver burden. In their sample, they found that instrumental
and emotional support were ineffective in reducing caregiver
burden.

The Taiwanese government has established long-term care
systems in response to the growth of the elderly population. Three
major types of care systems are provided: institutions, community
based care, and home care. Both the Department of Social Affairs,
Ministry of Interior, and the Department of Health, Executive Yuan
supervise these long-term care systems. Home care is partly
covered by the National Health Insurance, which pays for two
home nursing visits per month. Most of these visits are to care for
people with physical disabilities. There is a separate independent
system for caring for people with mental illness.

Previous studies examined the relationships between burden
and mental health or physical health separately. The objective of
this study was to better understand the needs of family caregivers
who were covered by the National Health Insurance and,
speciﬁcally, to clarify the factors associated with their mental
and physical health simultaneously. By doing this, we hope to ﬁnd
ways to provide useful help to caregivers of disabled family
members, particularly as demographic parameters shift toward a
larger population of older people in Taiwan.

2. Subjects and methods

2.1. Sample

There are 46 home-care agencies providing services to clients in
the Kaohsiung and Pingtong areas in Southern Taiwan. All of them
are certiﬁed agencies and are covered by the National Health
Insurance. However, only clients with a Barthel score less than 60
are eligible for the home care services provided by the government,
which means that the dependency levels of clients are high. After
excluding 12 agencies which care for less than 20 clients or that
were converted to care for severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) patients instead of home-care clients, 16 home-care
agencies serving 588 cases were eligible. We included only those
individuals who were 18 years or older and spent most of their
time taking care of at least one ill family member at home. Among
the eligible cases, 50 were institutionalized, 96 refused or did not
complete the interview, and 54 were cared for by hired carers and
their families could not be reached. This resulted in a total of 388
family caregivers ((cid:2)66%) of clients served by these agencies,
recruited between 20 June 2003 and 30 November 2003. All the
clients were physically ill. Over half of them were unconscious
(Chiou et al., 2005), with 84.7% being totally dependent. A
considerable number of care receivers were suffering from
cerebrovascular disease (66.8%), followed by diabetes (28.6%)
and cardiovascular disease (19.8%) (Chiou et al., 2005). Written
consent was obtained from each participating caregiver.

2.2. Measures

The CHQ-12 was used to measure mental health. Respondents
were asked to rate aspects of their psychosocial health on a four-
point scale, which ranged from 1 (not at all) to 4 (more than usual).
The items included headaches, heart palpitations, chest pain or
tightening, trembling or pins and needles, sleeplessness, nervous-
ness, and hopelessness. A higher score represented a more severe
psychosocial impairment. The CHQ-12 has been tested among the
elderly in the community with acceptable validity. The Relative
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the
optimal cut-off point. At the optimal cut-off point of two-thirds,
the CHQ-12 had a sensitivity of 79.7% and a speciﬁcity of 83.6%
(Chen et al., 2000). This study had a reasonable reliability
(Cronbach’s a = 0.80).

Caregivers were asked to rate their overall health on a three-
item scale, developed on the basis of
the General Health
Perceptions Subscale of the SF-36 Health Status Scale (Ware
et al., 1994). Ratings ranged from 1 (bad) to 3 (good), with a higher
score representing better SPH. The items have been shown to have
a reasonable reliability in Taiwan (Cronbach’s a = 0.68) (Chen,
2004), and good reliability was achieved in this study (Cronbach’s
a = 0.74).

Participants’ illness symptoms were assessed using a list of
physical and psychological aliments that may have arisen during
their caregiving duties. The seven symptoms were headache,
dizziness, joint pains, insomnia, backache, stomach discomfort,
and depressed mood. The presence of diagnosed chronic diseases
such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and gout
was also assessed. We developed this measure speciﬁcally for this
study.

A modiﬁed scale for caregiver’s burden was used in this study
(Song, 2002); the subscale for stigma was not used because it did
not apply to the research objectives. The 16-item scale measured
the caregiver’s feelings towards the ill family member based on the
dimensions of family disruption and strain, and patient depen-
dency. Respondents scored each item on a ﬁve-point scale from 0
(never) to 4 (always true), with higher scores indicating heavier

H.-Y. Chang et al. / Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics 50 (2010) 267–271

269

burden. The original scale achieved an acceptable reliability rating
(Cronbach’s a = 0.93). The reliability of the modiﬁed scale used in
this study was also good (Cronbach’s a = 0.84).

Data regarding demographic characteristics, employment
status, hours per day devoted to caregiving, and whether care
and expenses were being shared were collected. Participants rated
their use of emotional support systems (face-to-face counseling,
telephone counseling, caregiver groups, or other support groups)
on a three-point scale. Higher scores represented more frequent
use of these support systems. Similarly, the use of functional
support systems (home nursing aids, in home respite care, in
institution respite care, in home services, rehabilitation, day-care
providers, and temporary care) was assessed. Physical support
included the use of transportation support, emergency help, and
telephone consultation. Together, these items were analyzed with
regard to their effects on caregivers’ mental health and burden
scores as well as their physical health. The recruitment method and
measures have been reported elsewhere (Chiou et al., 2005).

2.3. Data analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic
characteristics, caregivers’ mental and physical health, and
caregiver burden. Analyses were performed using SAS version
9.0 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). We then used a path diagram
to clarify relationships among the factors associated with
caregiver’s mental health, burden, and physical health. A structural
equation model was a valid measure for investigating the causal
relationships among the variables, because: (1) several variables
were correlated; (2) physical health was measured by the
combination of three items: the number of diagnosed chronic
diseases, number of illness symptoms, and SPH; and (3) when the
correlated measurement errors were taken into account, the model
was able to specify the relationships among the observed variables
and health status (Lin and Wan, 2001).

We hypothesized that mental health (measured by CHQ-12) and
burden (measured by the burden scale) would affect caregiver’s
health, and that caring hours per day, age, and use of support
systems would affect the mental health and burden scores. The
correlation among variables were examined. We then constructed a
model of the latent variable physical health, which was measured by
the number of diagnosed chronic diseases, number of illness
symptoms, and SPH. Next, we constructed the structural equation
model to examine the relationships among the variables. Individual
characteristics such as age, education level, working status, and
the use of emotional, functional, and/or physical support were
considered as exogenous variables that had effects on the mental
health score (represented by CHQ-12) and burden score. Finally, we
examined how the correlated variables of mental health and burden
scores affected the physical health of caregivers.

3. Results

Demographic, health, and burden characteristics of caregivers
are presented in Table 1. Half of the participants (N = 220, 56.7%)
had less than or equal to 9 years of education. About one-third
(N = 113, 29.1%) ﬁnished senior high school and 14.1% (N = 55) had
college or higher education. The mean ages of care receivers were
72.6 (cid:3) 12.8 and 69.6 (cid:3) 16.4 years for males and females, respectively.
Most of the caregivers were females (72%). Over half of male
caregivers were sons of the care receivers. One-third of female
caregivers were daughters-in-law of the care receivers, and another
30% were spouses (data not shown).

The correlations among the variables are presented in Table 2.
Age was positively related to the number of chronic diseases and
negatively related to SPH. That meant as age increased, number of
chronic diseases increased, and SPH worsen. Number of hours per
day devoted to caregiving was negatively related to emotional
support and SPH but positively related to mental health and
burden scores. As caregivers devoted more time in caring, they had
less time to use emotional support. Their SPH got worse, and
mental health declined. Emotional support was positively asso-
ciated with functional support but negatively related to mental
health score and number of illness symptoms. Physical support
was positively associated with mental health and burden scores,
number of illness symptoms, and number of chronic diseases but
negatively associated with SPH. Similar patterns were found for
mental health and burden scores. Even though several correlations
reached statistical signiﬁcance, most of them were small
in
magnitude with coefﬁcients less than 0.5. The exceptions were the
correlations between mental health score and burden score,
mental health score and number of illness symptoms, and burden

correlation between number of illness symptoms and SPH.

The standardized regression weights for the signiﬁcant
variables are listed in Table 3, and Fig. 1 illustrates the structural
equation model for the physical health of caregivers. The model
indicated that hours per day of caregiving, and the use of
emotional,
functional, and physical support systems were
explanatory variables for mental health; and the hours per day
of caregiving and use of physical support were explanatory
variables for burden. The health measures were signiﬁcant
predictors of actual health problems. The negative coefﬁcient
between health problems and SPH was due to the scoring of SPH
status, with a higher score representing better health. Mental

Although predictors of caregiver mental health or burden have
been well studied separately, the relationships between these two
factors and the physical health of caregivers have rarely been
studied simultaneously. This is one of the very few studies that has
used structural equation modeling to examine relationships
among caregivers’ burden, mental health, and physical health.
We found that mental health had a stronger effect on physical
health than did burden (standardized coefﬁcients: 0.63 vs. 0.26).
Our results are consistent with those of Grov et al. (2006), who
used a path model to identify variables inﬂuencing caregivers’
burden. They reported signiﬁcant associations between caregivers’
physical health and levels of anxiety and depression, but were
unable to establish a direct association between physical health
and burden.

The items on the CHQ-12 used to assess mental health included
headaches, heart palpitations, chest pain or tightening, trembling
or pins and needles, sleeplessness, nervousness, and hopelessness.
These items were signiﬁcantly related to the number of hours per
day of caregiving and the use of emotional support, which included
face-to-face interview, telephone counseling, caregiver groups, or
other support groups. Our results are in line with the ﬁndings of
Savard et al. (2006), who reported that caregivers receiving
information, advice, or emotional support were more likely to be
highly satisﬁed. Although we found that the use of functional
support systems also decreased mental stress, the effect was not
statistically signiﬁcant. This may be due to a low level of awareness
of the existence of these functional support systems or how to
apply for them. Thus, based on our ﬁndings, the Taiwanese public
health community and social service providers should strengthen
and promote existing support systems as well as design new
systems to ease the mental stress of family caregivers. The social
workers or public health nurses should reach out the caregivers in
the communities to help them use the existing or newly developed
support systems.

The burden score measured caregivers’ feelings of not being
able to provide good and sufﬁcient care; how much caregiving
interfered with daily life,
life, and
marriage; as well as feelings of worry and irritation. Our study
revealed that burden was signiﬁcantly predicted by the number of

leisure activities, social

hours per day devoted to caregiving and the use of physical
support, suggesting that emotional and functional support were
unable to alleviate these feelings of burden, as measured in our
study. On the other hand, age was negatively related to burden
score.
It was possible that the older caregivers were more
traditional people and accepted the role for caregiving. But as
age increased the number of diseases increased and the self-
perceived worsen. That implied that the older caregivers’ health
condition was decelerating even though they did not think the
burden was heavy.

The average duration of caregiving was around 194.5 months
(16.2 years). The care receivers were around 70 years old. In
Chinese society, most elderly people live with their children,
especially their sons. Caring for ill family members can become a
burden on the sons’ families, particularly on the wives. As women
have become more independent in Taiwan, it has become very
popular to hire foreign domestic helpers. The mental health and
burden of these foreign helpers will be another important issue to
study in the future.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, this is one of the very few studies to use
structural equation modeling to examine relationships among
caregivers’ burden, mental health, and physical health simulta-
neously. Our results revealed the important inﬂuence of mental
health on caregivers’ physical health. Intervention programs for
caregivers need to target health in a holistic way.
