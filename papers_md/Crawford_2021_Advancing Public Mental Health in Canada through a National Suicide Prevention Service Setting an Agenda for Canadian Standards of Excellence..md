Abstract
The Public Health Agency of Canada is funding a new Canada Suicide Prevention Service (CSPS), timely both in recognition of
the need for a public health approach to suicide prevention, and also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is
causing concern about the potential for increases in suicide. This editorial reviews priorities for suicide prevention in Canada,
in relation to the evidence for crisis line services, and current international best practices in the implementation of crisis lines;
in particular, the CSPS recognizes the importance of being guided by existing evidence as well as the opportunity to contribute
to evidence, to lead innovation in suicide prevention, and to involve communities and people with lived experience in suicide
prevention efforts.

Abr ´eg ´e
L’agence de la sant´e publique du Canada finance un nouveau Service canadien de pr´evention du suicide (SCPS), `a la fois en
reconnaissance du besoin d’une approche de sant´e publique de la pr´evention du suicide, et aussi dans le contexte de la
pand´emie de la COVID-19, qui cause des pr´eoccupations quant `a l’augmentation potentielle des suicides. Le pr´esent article
examine les priorit´es de la pr´evention du suicide au Canada, relativement aux donn´ees probantes des services de ligne de
crise, et aux pratiques exemplaires internationales actuelles en mati`ere de mise en œuvre des lignes de crise; en particulier,
le SCPS reconnaˆıt l’importance de se laisser guider par les donn´ees probantes existantes, ainsi que la possibilit´e de contribuer
aux donn´ees probantes, de faire preuve d’innovation dans la pr´evention du suicide, et d’impliquer les collectivit´es et les
personnes ayant une exp´erience v´ecue des initiatives de pr´evention du suicide.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is providing its largest
commitment of funding to suicide prevention, through a
Canada Suicide Prevention Service (CSPS); $21,000,000
over 5 years will go toward creating a National network of
crisis services, delivered 365/24/7 by phone, text, and chat in
both English and French. This service will be led by the
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in partnership with
the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) National,
and Crisis Services Canada (CSC).

The CSPS supports appeals for greater investment in public
health approaches to mental health and wellness1 and for an

integrated, national response to suicide prevention.2 Suicide
remains one of the top 10 leading causes of death in all age
groups, and it is the second leading cause of death among 15- to

24-year-olds in Canada.3 These needs are even more pressing
in the current context of the pandemic caused by COVID-19.
Increases in psychological distress have been reported glob-
ally.4 A recent survey by the CMHA found that 6% of respon-
dents endorsed thinking about suicide, compared with 2.5%
the year prior.5 Those who work in suicide prevention have
also predicted an increase in suicide as a result of the pan-
demic,6 including in Canada.7,8 While data to substantiate an
increase in the rate of suicide during the pandemic in Canada
are not yet available, rates of calls to the national crisis service
have increased 185% over the course of the pandemic and are
200% higher than the same time period in 2019.9 Factors cited
as potential risks include isolation and decreased social
support; economic hardship; and, decreased access to mental
health services.6 This increase is not inevitable, however,
underscoring calls for improved mental health services,
including crisis support.

The CSPS is also a major fulfillment of Bill C-300, An Act
Respecting a Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention,
adopted by the House of Commons in June 2012, and the
subsequent 2016 Federal Framework for Suicide Preven-
tion.10 The Federal Framework aligns federal activities in
suicide prevention, while complementing suicide prevention
initiatives underway in provinces and territories, commu-
nities, and nongovernmental organizations across Canada.
The Federal Framework recognizes that suicide prevention
requires cross-sectoral collaboration and multidimensional
approaches along a continuum of care. The Framework’s core
objectives include reducing stigma and raising public aware-
ness of suicide; connecting Canadians, resources and infor-
mation; and accelerating research and evidence in suicide
prevention.10 The CSPS will contribute to each of these goals.
An environmental scan, conducted through online search
and by contacting existing crisis services, identified 146
crisis and distress services across Canada. CSC laid the foun-
dation for this new CSPS, from 2017, bringing four distress
centers together into a network, and piloting technology to
create a national crisis line. The new CSPS will scale these
efforts, building a robust community and network across
Canada, and innovating to design evidence-based guidelines

and best practices,
solutions.

interventions, and technological

The CSPS will focus on bringing together community-
based crisis and distress services to create a national network
of crisis response. The CSPS partners are united in a com-
mitment to sustain existing community crisis and suicide
prevention resources, upholding the value that a
community-based approach is key to ensuring that people
in Canada across the country can participate in suicide
prevention within their own communities, and in turn
receive services that recognize their local contexts. This is
particularly true for underserved, and higher risk groups,
such as some First Nations, M´etis, and Inuit communities,
and LGBTQ2 communities, which have unique strengths
and needs.11

Crisis services are an evidence-based component of a
multidimensional approach to suicide prevention.12 A recent
systematic review demonstrated that crisis line services
reduce distress, including suicide-related distress and beha-
vior, immediately, and in the short term, among the high
risk population of people who utilize these services.13 Crisis
services have also been shown to be cost-effective.14 Less
evidence exists for the longer-term impact on mental health
symptoms, wellness, and suicide-related outcomes. More
recent directions support better integration of crisis services
into the health system, such as integration of crisis line service
with mobile crisis services15; the use of crisis line services to
link callers with mental health supports, or to follow-up with
those who are at high risk, such as those who have recently
discharged from psychiatric hospitalization.16,17

Implementation of crisis line services in other interna-
tional contexts provides gold standard models, including the
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) service in the
United States,18 and the Samaritans helpline in the United
Kingdom.19 It is beyond the scope of this editorial to provide
a comprehensive review of best practices in the implemen-
tation of crisis services globally; however, the framework in
the National Guidelines for Behavioural Health Crisis Care,
by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin-
istration (SAMHSA) in the United States, which funds the

Table 1. Promoting Hope and Preventing Suicide: Key priorities for the Canada Suicide Prevention Service.

Priorities

Principles

(cid:2) Improve access to crisis

services

(cid:2) Inclusion of people with

lived experience
(cid:2) Equity and diversity
(cid:2) Cultural safety
(cid:2) Trauma-informed

Specific Actions

(cid:2) Ensure bilingual, 24/7/365 service in phone, text and chat
(cid:2) “No wrong door” policy—both human and technological factors should support this ease

of access, and the experience of the service user should be safe and seamless

(cid:2) Expand the capacity of the service by onboarding new centers and supporting existing centers
(cid:2) Explore the feasibility of a universal, three-digit crisis support number available across Canada9
(cid:2) Involve people with lived experience in co-design of the service, particularly those who

represent a diversity of experiences, and from under-served populations. Canadian research
has demonstrated that the co-creation of services can result in higher rates of engagement and
satisfaction for those who will use the service22

Implementation and evaluation

(cid:2) An approach grounded in implementation science will support the scalability and ensure fidelity

throughout the network

(cid:2) The adoption of continuous quality improvement will help to create a learning health system

with the goal of targeted, timely quality improvement

(cid:2) Identify gaps in knowledge and foster innovation in suicide prevention. While crisis services

have proven effective in the immediate and short-term, there is a paucity of evidence for their
impact in the long-term. The CSPS will engage in longitudinal evaluation and contribute to
gathering this evidence

Best-practices and training

(cid:2) Collaborate across the network to develop Canadian standards and best-practices in crisis

intervention

(cid:2) Collaborate to share best practices and design standardized training for crisis line volunteers

and staff23

(cid:2) Include training in culturally safe and trauma-informed care, and approaches that also support

the wellness of responders24

Technology and innovation

(cid:2) Foster innovation that will improve technology and system capacity; for example, leveraging

machine learning and natural language processing to improve the identification of those callers
at greatest risk, and to support responders in real-time with evidence-based guidance25
(cid:2) Expand the range of interventions to include tools for self-management of suicide related

distress, which have had promising results in other contexts26

Community-based network

(cid:2) In contrast to a centralized model, we have chosen to build upon a community-based model

System integration

that will engage existing crisis and distress centers across Canada

(cid:2) We plan to use a proven virtual telementoring model—Project ECHO27—to create a National
community of practice that will promote collaboration and build capacity among the network,
and to disseminate training.

(cid:2) Develop a National Advisory Committee that will create a broader network of diverse

perspectives to guide the service

(cid:2) Contribute to public awareness and the reduction of stigma. Stigma and secrecy surrounding
suicide are associated with greater mental health difficulties, suicide, and grief related to suicide
loss28

(cid:2) Work toward integration across mental health and community services. We know that many
Canadians experience mental health care as difficult to access and fragmented.29 In addition,
delays in access to care can result in worse outcomes, with those who have recently been
discharged from emergency departments and hospital admission are at heightened risk of
suicide30

(cid:2) Solutions such as follow-up calls and linking crisis line services with existing mental health

supports have proven effective in other jurisdictions and should be considered in Canada15,16

NSPL,15 aligns with the direction of the CSPS. The model
proposed by the CSPS partners to advance a vision for a
National suicide prevention service is included in Figure 1;
it highlights key principles and dimensions necessary for the
effective development and implementation of a national sui-
cide prevention service.

In their National Guidelines, SAMHSA outlines the essen-
tial principles and core elements for crises services including
crisis lines.15 Reflecting the National Action Alliance for
Suicide Prevention evidence-based actions, known as Zero
Suicide or Suicide Safer Care, the National Guidelines

emphasize principles of access to crisis services, with a
person-centered, “no-wrong door” approach, and a philoso-
phy that removes barriers to accessing care” (p. 26), operating
“every moment of every day (24/7/365).” In the United States,
the Federal Communications Commission has recently
approved a 3-digit number, under the National Suicide Hot-
line Improvement Act.9 Universal access numbers have been
shown to be an essential variable in emergency response.20
Other principles in the National Guidelines include the
provision of trauma-informed care, and making space for a
significant role for peers and inclusion of people with lived

experience of suicide. The guidelines place significant weight
on the importance of implementation, drawing on the imple-
mentation approach of the National Action Alliance for Suicide
Prevention’s tool kit of evidence-based actions, along with
continuous quality improvement, “applying a data-driven qual-
ity improvement approach to inform system changes that will
lead to improved patient outcomes and better care for those at
risk” (p. 30). Training for crisis line staff should follow the
standards and guidelines of the NSPL, including clinicians to
oversee clinical triage, assessment of risk of suicide, practice of
active engagement and collaboration, and use least invasive
intervention. Technology should incorporate advances that
improve efficiency of the service working toward seamless
connections to care in a mental health and substance use crisis
system. Finally, the guidelines recognize the importance of a
community-based approach in which crisis services are inte-
grated into a continuum of a comprehensive system of care that
includes crisis mobile response and crisis receiving and stabi-
lizing facilities, with the goal of providing continuous contact
and support, especially after acute care. Of note, particularly
given recent crises in the Canadian context,21 this system inte-
gration is pivotal to “minimize the existing default to use of law
enforcement in mental health crises” (p. 11).15

Key priorities for the CSPS that align with the SAMHSA
framework are summarized in Table 1, recognizing that the
foremost of these priorities is consultation with community
partners and stakeholders and involvement of a broader and
more diverse group of people with lived and living experi-
ence of suicide, and thus priorities and specific actions taken
will likely evolve.

The investment of the Federal government in a CSPS is an
evidence-based approach to suicide prevention, which will
also stimulate people living in Canada, volunteers, clinicians,
researchers, and communities to strive for increased knowl-
edge creation, dissemination, and implementation of inter-
ventions that prevent suicide. As we register the current
levels of distress nationally, and affirm the importance of an
evidence-based, public health approach to suicide prevention,
we are compelled to put evidence in service of preventing
suicide and to seek further evidence where none is available.
If we work collaboratively, across communities, learning
with diverse people with lived and living experience, and
from those in Canada who have experienced loss to suicide,
we can promote hope and prevent suicide.
