Abstract 
Background  It is imperative to promote behavior/intention of taking up booster COVID-19 vaccination (BI-BV) 
among people who have ever contracted COVID-19 (PECC). The aims were to investigate the prevalence of BI-BV 
and its associations with perceived social support. Guided by the stress coping theory, we tested mediators 
between perceived social support and BI-BV via self-stigma, active coping, and maladaptive emotion regulation 
(rumination and catastrophizing).

Methods  A random population-based telephone survey was conducted among adult PECC having completed 
the primary series of COVID-19 vaccination prior to the diagnosis; 230 participants were interviewed from June 
to August 2022 during the fifth (last) major outbreak in Hong Kong. The associations between the independent 
variables and BI-BV were tested by logistic regression analysis. A structural equation model (SEM) tested the indirect 
effects of the latent variables of self-stigma, active coping, and maladaptive emotion regulation between the latent 
variable of perceived social support and BI-BV.

Results  The prevalence of BI-BV was 62.2%. It was associated with age, marital status, full-time employment, 
and chronic disease status. The logistic regression analysis found that BI-BV was positively associated with perceived 
social support (ORc = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12– 1.54), active coping (ORc = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10– 1.79), rumination (ORc = 1.75, 
95% CI: 1.13– 2.70), and catastrophizing (ORc = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.49– 6.51) and negatively associated with self-stigma 
(ORc = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.72– 0.88). In the SEM analysis, the positive association between perceived social support 
and BI-BV was fully mediated: 1) via self-stigma (β = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03– 0.14), 2) via active coping (β = 0.06, 95% CI: 
0.02– 0.12), and 3) via self-stigma and then active coping (β = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.002– 0.04). Two of these indirect paths 
involved active coping. The indirect paths involving maladaptive emotion regulation were all non-significant.

Conclusions  Perceived social support was associated with BI-BV, and was mediated via self-stigma, active coping, 
and serially self-stigma then active coping but not emotion maladaptation. The data supported the stress cognitive 
coping model in explaining the association between perceived social support and BI-BV. Interventions promoting 
BI-BV may consider modifying the observed significant factors. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm 
the findings.

Introduction
Although COVID-19 is no longer a pandemic, it remains 
globally  prevalent.  The  prevalence  of  COVID-19  rein-
fection  was  28%  when  the  BQ.1/BQ.1.1  variants  were 
involved [1]. Reinfection increases the risks of death, hos-
pitalization  [2],  and  severity  of  long  COVID  symptoms 
(e.g.,  lung  scarring,  heart  diseases,  neurological  effects, 
and  psychological  consequences)  [3].  Booster  vaccina-
tion  can  increase  immunity  against  reinfection  [4,  5]. 
According  to  a  meta-analysis  of  91  studies  that  inves-
tigated  158,478  records,  the  risk  of  reinfection  after > 
= 12  months  from  the  first  infection  was  lower  among 
vaccinated  individuals  than  unvaccinated  individuals, 
although  the  reinfection  rates  were  low  in  both  groups 
[6].  The  World  Health  Organization  and  some  coun-
try  authorities  recommend  people  to  take  up  booster 
COVID-19 vaccination six months after diagnosis [7–9]. 
It is important to promote booster vaccination in specific 
sub-populations  (e.g.,  older  people).  Vaccinated  people 
who have ever been infected with COVID-19 (PECC) is 
a  special  population  that  warrants  attention.  The  infec-
tion  experience  of  the  PECC  might  have  affected  their 
confidence in the vaccines whereas such confidence was 
a factor of vaccination [10]. The experience of COVID-19 
infection  may  also  modify  perceptions  on  risk  of  infec-
tion,  consequences  of  infection,  and  perceived  efficacy 
of  vaccination,  which  were  potential  determinants  of 
booster  vaccination  [11].  According  to  social  marketing 
principles,  segmentation  and  tailored  strategies  would 
improve  effectiveness  of  health  promotion  [12].  Identi-
fication  of  psychosocial  factors  of  behavior/intention  of 
taking up booster COVID-19 vaccination (BI-BV) among 
PECC  is  hence  essential.  One  study  conducted  in  Italy 
reported  that  female  sex,  negative  affective  state,  and 
lower  perceived  risk  were  associated  with  reluctance  to 
take  up  the  vaccines  after  contracting  COVID-19  [13]. 
Another  study  conducted  in  Hong  Kong  explored  some 
psychological  factors  associated  with  BI-BV  among 
PECC  [14].  No  other  similar  studies  were  found  in 
literature.

The stress coping theory was used as this study’s frame-
work  [15].  It  postulates  that  when  facing  a  stressor,  an 
individual’s coping resources would alleviate the level of 

stress  and  affect  his/her  coping  strategies,  which  would 
in  turn  affect  his/her  coping  responses  and  coping  out-
comes  [15].  In  this  study,  perceived  social  support  was 
considered as a coping resource, self-stigma as a stressor 
related to COVID-19, active coping as a cognitive coping 
strategy,  and  BI-BV  as  a  coping  response.  In  literature, 
perceived social support is a coping resource [15, 16] that 
affects  health  behaviors  (e.g.,  physical  exercise,  dietary 
behavior) [17–19], and COVID-19 vaccination [20, 21]; it 
was  also  associated  with  various  types  of  coping  strate-
gies  [22,  23],  including  active  coping  [24].  However,  the 
association  between  social  support  and  booster  vacci-
nation  among  vaccinated  PECC  remains  unclear.  Public 
stigma  was  common  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic 
[25, 26] and the SARS outbreak [27]. Self-stigma related 
to  COVID-19  refers  to  internalization  of  the  public 
stigma [28]. It is a prevalent stressor which was positively 
associated  with  mental  distress  [29,  30],  and  was  also 
negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccination inten-
tion/behavior  [31]  and  active  coping  in  previous  studies 
[32]. There is a dearth of studies looking at the relation-
ship between self-stigma and booster vaccination behav-
ior/intention among vaccinated PECC.

Emotion  regulation  and  coping  strategies  are  closely 
related  but  distinctive  constructs  that  evolve  separately 
[33];  they  involve  different  strategies  (e.g.,  active  coping 
for  coping  and  rumination  for  emotion  regulation)  [34, 
35]  and  measurement  scales  [36,  37].  Emotion  regula-
tion  refers  to  how  an  individual  respond  to  emotionally 
arousing  situations;  such  regulation  may  be  adaptive  or 
maladaptive, leading to better or worse emotional states, 
respectively  [38].  Coping  refers  to  how  an  individual 
manages  specific  demands  arising  from  stressful  situa-
tions, which is not limited to emotional difficulties and is 
hence  more  general  than  emotion  regulation  [37].  Cop-
ing  is  usually  a  volitional  and  controlled  process  while 
emotion  regulation  can  be  automated  or  uncontrolled 
[39]. Furthermore, some researchers suggested that emo-
tion  regulation  is  a  subset  of  coping  (emotional  cop-
ing) [40]; others highlighted their differences [41]; a few 
studies  even  found  minimal  or  non-significant  associa-
tions between the two [42]. Since both processes involve 
regulations  under  stressful  situations  [39],  the  present

study  integrated  both  coping  (active  coping)  and  mala-
daptive  emotion  regulation  (rumination  and  catastro-
phizing)  into  the  stress-coping  framework.  It  contends 
that  the  associations  between  perceived  social  support/
self-stigma  and  BI-BV  would  be  mediated  through  both 
a ‘cognitive coping process’ (i.e., via active coping) and an 
‘emotion  regulation  process’  (i.e.,  via  maladaptive  emo-
tion  regulation).  Maladaptive  emotion  regulation  is  a 
subset  of  emotion  regulation  which  may  lead  to  harm-
ful/ineffective consequences [43]. Rumination (how peo-
ple concentrate on the ideas and emotions connected to 
unfavorable  events)  and  catastrophizing  (exaggerations 
of  the  seriousness  of  an  event)  are  two  common  modes 
of  maladaptive  emotion  regulation  [37].  As  previous 
studies  found  that  perceived  social  support  was  associ-
ated  with  self-stigma  [44–46]  whereas  emotion  regula-
tion  was  associated  with  coping  strategies  [47,  48],  it  is 
plausible that self-stigma, emotion regulation, and active 
coping would mediate between perceived social support 
and  BI-BV  serially.  The  hypothetical  model  is  presented 
in Supplementary Fig. 1.

The study was conducted in Hong Kong, where various 
control measures against COVID-19 (e.g., social distanc-
ing,  facemask  use  and  provision  of  free  COVID-19  vac-
cination)  were  implemented  since  February  2020  [49]. 
As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  total  number  of  COVID-
19  cases  and  deaths  was  about  12,649  and  213,  respec-
tively [50]. The severe fifth-wave outbreak occurred from 
late December, 2021 to January, 2023 [51], during which 
about  1.4  million  new  cases  and  about  13,000  deaths 
were reported [52]. This study was conducted from June 
20 to August 2, 2022, hence during an acute phase of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

This study investigated the prevalence of BI-BV among 
PECC  in  Hong  Kong,  China,  and  tested  the  signifi-
cance  of  some  potential  factors  of  BI-BV,  i.e.,  perceived 
social  support,  self-stigma  related  to  COVID-19  infec-
tion,  active  coping,  and  maladaptive  emotion  regulation 
(rumination and catastrophizing). Using structural equa-
tion  model  (SEM)  analysis,  two  single-mediator  paths 
between the latent variable perceived social support and 
BI-BV via the latent variables of active coping/maladap-
tive  emotion  regulation  and  two  others  between  the 
latent variable of self-stigma and BI-BV via the latent var-
iables  of  active  coping/maladaptive  emotion  regulation 
were tested. Three additional serial mediation paths were 
tested: a) perceived social support → self-stigma → active 
coping → BI-BV,  b)  perceived  social  support → self-
stigma → maladaptive  emotion  regulation → BI-BV),  and 
c)  perceived  social  support → self-stigma → maladaptive 
emotion regulation → active coping → BI-BV (see Supple-
mentary  Fig.  1).  To  our  knowledge,  no  previous  studies 
have tested such mediation paths.

Methods
Study design

A  cross-sectional  random,  population-based  telephone 
survey was conducted in Hong Kong, China from June 20 
to August 2, 2022.

Participants

Inclusion criteria included: (1) Chinese aged 18 years or 
older, (2) PECC status determined by the screening ques-
tion:  “Have  you  been  tested  positive  for  COVID-19  via 
the  Nucleic  Acid  Amplification  Test  (NAAT)  or  Rapid 
Antigen Test (RAT)? (Yes/No response options)”, (3) com-
pletion of the primary series of vaccination (at least two 
doses of the COVID-19 vaccines) prior to the COVID-19 
diagnosis. Regarding exclusion criteria, as the epidemiol-
ogy,  social  context,  and  experience  of  COVID-19  infec-
tion was changing over time [10], factors of BI-BV were 
time-dependent.  Thus,  exclusion  criteria  were:  1)  PECC 
not being diagnosed during the fifth (last) major COVID-
19 outbreak wave in Hong Kong, i.e., excluding diagnosis 
made prior to February l, 2022, 2) those having taken up 
four doses of vaccines prior to the diagnosis as free fifth 
dose  vaccination  was  not  then  available  in  Hong  Kong, 
3)  those  having  difficulties  in  understanding  and/or 
responding to the questions according to the judgement 
of the trained interviewers, and 4) non Chinese speakers.

Data collection

Telephone  numbers  were  randomly  generated  from  a 
fixed-line phone directory. Interviews, which took about 
20  min  to  complete,  were  conducted  between  5  and 
10 pm to avoid oversampling of unemployed people. The 
eligible  household  member  whose  birthday  was  clos-
est to the interview date was invited to participate in the 
study. At least three attempts were made to follow on the 
unanswered phone calls before classifying them as inva-
lid numbers. The interviews were conducted in Chinese. 
Briefing was provided by the well-trained interviewers to 
ensure participants were informed about the anonymous 
and voluntary nature of the study. Verbal informed con-
sent  was  obtained  from  the  participants. The  interview-
ers  signed  a  form  declaring  that  they  had  gone  through 
the proper briefing/consent procedures. Previous studies 
have used similar methodologies [14, 53, 54]. No incen-
tives were given to the participants.

A  total  of  469  valid  telephone  contacts  were  made, 
of  which  280  participants  completed  the  interview 
(response rate: 280/469 = 59.7%); 50 cases were excluded 
from  data  analysis  (incompletion  of  primary  series 
[n = 41], diagnosed before February 1, 2022 [n = 3], having 
taken  up  four  doses  of  vaccines  prior  to  the  COVID-19

diagnosis [n = 1], and no response to the question about 
vaccination behavior/intention [n = 5]). The final effective 
sample size was 230.

Measures
Background factors

Background  information  was  collected  (sex,  age,  educa-
tion level, marital status, employment status, whether liv-
ing alone, whether having a religious belief, and chronic 
disease  status).  Regarding  chronic  disease  status,  par-
ticipants were asked: “Do you have the following chronic 
diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung dis-
ease,  kidney  disease,  liver  disease,  respiratory  disease, 
cancer,  others)?”  The  response  categories  for  each  item 
were “yes”, “no”, “don’t know”, or “refuse to answer”. Those 
having at least one “yes” answer was classified as having 
one or more types of chronic disease.

Behavior/intention of taking up booster dose of COVID‑19 
vaccination (BI‑BV)

It  was  assessed  by  the  item:  “After  receiving  your 
COVID-19  diagnosis,  have  you  taken  up  a  booster  dose 
of  COVID-19  vaccination  or  would  you  do  so  in  the 
future? (1: neither having taken up nor intended to take 
up  the  booster  vaccine;  2:  having  taken  up  the  booster 
vaccine  after  the  COVID-19  diagnosis;  3:  had  not  taken 
up the booster vaccine but intended to do so).The three 
responses  were  recoded  into  a  binary  variable  by  com-
bining 2) and 3) into the ‘individuals with either booster 
vaccination behavior or intention group’ (i.e., those with 
BI-BV)  and  the  ‘individuals  with  neither  booster  vacci-
nation behavior nor  intention group’ (i.e.,  those without 
BI-BV).

Perceived social support

Perceived social support was assessed in two dimensions 
(perceived  emotional  support  and  perceived  instrumen-
tal  support),  which  have  frequently  been  used  to  assess 
the level of perceived social support [55]. The two ques-
tions  were:  “Your  family  and  friends  would  be  available 
when  you  need  emotional  support  or  need  someone  to 
talk to” and “When you need practical help in life (such 
as financial needs), your family and friends will give you 
enough support”. Participants rated the items on two Lik-
ert  scales,  ranging  from  1  (highly  disagree)  to  7  (highly 
agree).  Previous  studies  have  used  similar  questions  to 
assess  perceived  social  support  [56,  57].  In  this  study, 
the Cronbach’s alpha of the scale was 0.85. A summation 
score of the two items was used to represent the level of 
perceived social support in the univariate logistic regres-
sion analysis.

Self‑stigma related to COVID‑19 infection

COVID-19-related  self-stigma  was  assessed  by  using  a 
3-item  scale  [58].  The  three  items  assessed  the  levels  of 
reluctance  to  disclose  COVID-19  infection  to  others, 
perceived negative views from others because of his/her 
COVID-19  infection  status,  and  perceived  public  dis-
crimination toward people infected with COVID-19. Lik-
ert scales were used to rate the item responses (1 = highly 
disagree to 5 = highly agree). In this study, the Cronbach’s 
alpha  of  the  scale  was  0.96.  A  summation  score  of  the 
three items was used to represent the level of self-stigma 
in the univariate logistic regression analysis.

Active coping

Active coping was assessed by using the 2-item subscale 
of  the  Brief  Coping  Orientation  to  Problems  Experi-
enced (brief COPE) inventory [36]. The two items were “I 
have been concentrating my efforts on doing something 
about  my  situation”  and  “I  have  been  taking  actions  to 
try to improve my situation”. The subscale has been used 
in  COVID-19  related  research  [59,  60].  The  items  were 
rated by 4-point Likert scales, ranging from 1 = “I haven’t 
been doing this at all” to 4 = “I have been doing this a lot”. 
In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the scale was 0.94. 
A score summing up the two item scores was used in the 
univariate logistic regression analysis.

Maladaptive emotion regulation

Maladaptive  emotion  regulation  was  assessed  by  the 
rumination  and  catastrophizing  subscales  of  the  Cogni-
tive  Emotion  Regulation  Questionnaire-Short  Version 
(CERQ-short) [37]. The two subscales have been used to 
investigate COVID-19 related maladaptive emotion regu-
lations  [61,  62].  Each  of  them  has  two  items  (“You  con-
stantly recall the pandemic as well as your feelings about 
the  pandemic”,  and  “You  indulge  in  your  thoughts  and 
feelings  about  the  pandemic”  for  rumination,  and  “You 
constantly think about how terrible the pandemic is” and 
“Sometimes you feel like the disaster is coming” for cata-
strophizing). Each item was assessed on a 5-point Likert 
scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The two subscales were 
formed by summing up their two respective item scores. 
They were used in the univariate logistic regression anal-
ysis.  In  this  study,  the  Cronbach’s  alphas  of  the  rumina-
tion  and  catastrophizing  subscales  were  0.97  and  0.81, 
respectively.

Statistical analysis

BI-BV  was  used  as  the  binary  dependent  variable.  Uni-
variable  logistic  regression  analysis  was  performed  to 
examine  the  individual  associations  between  the  back-
ground variables/independent variables (perceived social

support, self-stigma, active coping, rumination, and cat-
astrophizing)  and  BI-BV.  Crude  odds  ratios  (ORc)  and 
respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. 
The confidence level of 95% was used to define statistical 
significance.

A  structural  equation  model  (SEM)  was  fit  to  assess 
whether self-stigma, active coping, and maladaptive emo-
tion  regulation  would  mediate  between  perceived  social 
support  and  BI-BV,  using  the  weighted  least  squared 
mean  and  variance  adjusted  (WLSMV)  estimator  [63]. 
Three  latent  variables  were  constructed  for  perceived 
social support, self-stigma, active coping, whereas mala-
daptive  emotion  regulation  was  a  second-order  latent 
variable  based  on  the  rumination  and  catastrophizing 
subscales [64]. Satisfactory model fit indices included χ2/
df < 5,  comparative  fit  index  (CFI) ≥ 0.90,  Tucker-Lewis 
index (TLI) ≥ 0.90, and root mean square error of approx-
imation (RMSEA) ≤ 0.08 [65]. The bootstrapping method 
(n = 2000)  was  conducted  to  test  the  significance  of  the 
indirect  effects.  An  indirect  effect  was  statistically  sig-
nificant when its 95% CI did not include zero. The SEM 
analysis was performed using Mplus 8.3, while the other 
tests  were  conducted  using  Stata  17.0  (Stata  Corp,  Col-
lege Station, TX, USA).

Results
Participants’ characteristics

Sixty-three  percent  of  the  participants  were  female; 
60.9%  aged  between  31–60  years;  92.6%  did  not  live 
alone; 70.9% were currently married; 26.1% had received 
college  or  above  education;  53.0%  worked  fulltime.  Fur-
thermore,  77.8%  did  not  have  a  religious  belief;  71.7% 
reported  no  chronic  diseases.  The  prevalence  of  BI-BV 
was  62.2%,  with  19  participants  (8.3%)  having  taken  up 
a  booster  vaccine  after  their  COVID-19  diagnosis  and 
124 participants (53.9%) not having taken up the booster 
vaccines  since  diagnosis  but  intended  to  do  so.  The 
mean score was 5.70 for the self-stigma scale (SD = 2.97; 
range = 3–15),  11.18  for  the  perceived  social  support 
scale (SD = 1.80; range = 2–14), 6.69 for the active coping 
subscale (SD = 1.13; range = 2–8), 2.87 for the rumination 
subscale (SD = 1.43; range = 2–10), and 2.55 for the cata-
strophizing  subscale  (SD = 1.16;  range = 2–10),  respec-
tively. The data are presented in Table 1.

ceived social support, self-stigma, active coping, and mal-
adaptive  emotion  regulation). The  factor  loadings  of  the 
latent variables range from 0.68 to 0.98 (all had p < 0.05). 
The  results  indicated  that  the  measurement  model  was 
suitable for the SEM analysis. Information about loadings 
of these latent variables are presented in Supplementary 
Fig. 2.

Several significant mediations were identified, supporting 
some  of  the  initial  hypotheses.  First,  the  indirect  effect 
of  perceived  social  support  on  BI-BV  via  active  coping 
was statistically significant (β = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02–0.12), 
i.e.,  perceived  social  support  was  positively  associated 
with  active  coping  (β = 0.29,  95%  CI:  0.15–0.44),  which 
was  in  turn  positively  associated  with  BI-BV  (β = 0.19, 
95%  CI:  0.04–0.34).  The  mediation  effect  size  was  21%. 
Second,  the  indirect  effect  between  perceived  social 
support  and  BI-BV  via  self-stigma  was  statistically  sig-
nificant  (β = 0.07,  95%  CI:  0.03–  0.14),  i.e.,  perceived 
social support was negatively associated with self-stigma 
(β = −0.28,  95%  CI:  −0.43–  −0.11),  which  was  in  turn 
negatively  associated  with  BI-BV  (β = −0.25,  95%  CI: 
−0.42– −0.11). The mediation effect size was 27%. Third, 
the  serial  indirect  path  of  higher  perceived  social  sup-
port → lower  self-stigma → higher  active  coping → higher 
BI-BV  was  also  statistically  significant  (β = 0.01,  95%  CI: 
0.002 – 0.04), i.e., perceived social support was negatively 
associated  with  self-stigma  (β = −0.28,  95%  CI:  −0.43 
–  −0.11),  which  was  in  turn  negatively  associated  with 
active  coping  (β = −0.22,  95%  CI:  −0.36  –  −0.09),  which 
was  in  turn  positively  associated  with  BI-BV  (β = 0.19, 
95%  CI:  0.04–  0.34).  The  mediation  effect  size  was  5%. 
The total mediation size of the three significant indirect 
paths was thus 53%. Notably, three other indirect paths, 
all  of  which  involved  emotion  regulation  as  the  media-
tor,  were  statistically  non-significant  (perceived  social 
regulation → BI-BV; 
support → maladaptive 
support → self-stigma → maladap-
perceived 
social 
tive  emotion 
support → self-stigma → maladaptive  emotion 
regula-
tion → active coping → BI-BV). Maladaptive emotion reg-
ulation was significantly associated with BI-BV (β = 0.37, 
95% CI: 0.20– 0.55). Furthermore, the direct effect from 
perceived  social  support  to  BI-BV  (β = 0.08,  95%  CI: 
−0.07, 0.25) was statistically non-significant.

Discussion
This is one of the few studies investigating BI-BV among 
PECC  who  completed  the  primary  series  of  COVID-19 
vaccination  prior  to  their  diagnosis.  To  summarize  the 
main findings, the prevalence of BI-BV among PECC was 
62.2%.  According  to  the  SEM  analysis,  perceived  social 
support  and  self-stigma  were  positively  and  negatively 
associated  with  BI-BV,  respectively.  Interestingly,  the 
association between perceived social support and BI-BV 
was  fully  mediated  via  1)  self-stigma,  2)  active  coping, 
and 3) self-stigma then active coping (a serial mediation). 
Two of these indirect paths involved the cognitive strat-
egy of active coping. However, the other three mediation 
indirect  paths  involving  maladaptive  emotion  regula-
tion  were  all  statistically  non-significant.  Unexpectedly,

of taking up booster COVID-19 vaccination

in  the  SEM  model,  maladaptive  emotion  regulation  was 
positively associated with BI-BV but was not significantly 
associated with perceived social support and self-stigma 
in the SEM.

The  suboptimal  prevalence  of  BI-BV  observed  in  this 
study was lower than the reported prevalence of the pri-
mary  series  vaccination  during  the  pandemic  previously 
recorded in some general populations [66]. Notably, only 
19 out of the 230 participants had taken up the vaccina-
tion. One reason was that behavioral intention often does 
not translate into action [67, 68]. Another reason is that 
as most of the participants were recently infected (within 
the last six months), it might be too early for them to take 
up  booster  vaccination,  considering  a  6-month  interval 
between diagnosis and vaccination recommended by the 
professionals.  As  the  pandemic  had  ended,  less  people 
would  maintain  the  health  beliefs  that  are  supportive  of 
booster  vaccination  (e.g.,  perceived  severity  of  COVID-
19),  health  promotion  of  vaccination  is  going  to  be  an 
uphill  challenge.  In  this  study,  older  and  currently  mar-
ried  people  were  more  likely  than  their  counterparts  to 
report  BI-BV,  corroborating  previous  studies  conducted 
in  Hong  Kong  and  other  countries  [69–71].  Plausible 
explanations  are  that  older  people  might  have  stronger 
concerns about the consequences of reinfection whereas 
currently  married  people  might  want  to  protect  their 
spouse  and  children  through  vaccination.  Furthermore, 

participants not working full time showed higher BI-BV, 
plausibly  because  of  their  older  age  and/or  having  more 
time  to  take  up  vaccination.  Health  promotion  may  pay 
more attention to such groups with lower BI-BV.

A few reasons may partially explain the observed sub-
optimal  prevalence  of  BI-BV.  First,  there  were  no  man-
date  vaccination  policies  for  booster  vaccination  among 
PECC in Hong Kong, who thus had no obligation to dis-
close  their  booster  vaccination  status  to  anyone.  Hence, 
there  was  no  external  pressure  urging  PECC  to  take  up 
the  vaccines  although  booster  vaccination  was  encour-
aged  by  the  government  and  free  vaccination  was  avail-
able to all Hong Kong residents at the time of the study. 
Second, PECC might believe that they had acquired natu-
ral immunity that was adequately protective against rein-
fection  [72].  Third,  as  all  the  participants  were  infected 
with  COVID-19  despite  completion  of  the  primary  vac-
cination  series,  some  of  them  might  cast  doubts  on  the 
efficacy of the booster vaccine [14]. In health promotion, 
PECC should hence be convinced that hybrid immunities 
resulted  from  infection  and  vaccination  are  important 
[73]  and  that  the  world  authorities  have  recommended 
booster vaccination for PECC [7–9].

The  stress  coping  model  [15]  involving  cognitive  cop-
ing (active coping) in terms of BI-BV was well supported 
by  this  study,  as  the  indirect  paths  involving  self-stigma 
and active coping fully mediated the association between 

 Zhang et al. BMC Public Health          (2025) 25:659 

Page 8 of 12

perceived social support and BI-BV. The findings suggest 
that an increase in perceived social support and a reduc-
tion  in  self-stigma  which  would  increase  active  coping 
and  then  BI-BV.  The  other  observed  serial  mediation 
involving active coping further supported the stress cop-
ing  model  involving  cognitive  coping  (perceived  social 
support → self-stigma → active  coping → BI-BV).  To  pro-
mote  BI-BV,  it  is  possible  to  enhance  perceived  social 
support provided by family members, significant others, 
and co-workers [74]. Self-stigma can be reduced via vari-
ous  interventions,  such  as  psychoeducation,  cognitive 
behavioral  therapy,  social  skills  training,  etc.  [75].  Inter-
ventions  also  need  to  reduce  self-stigma  by  convincing 
PECC that COVID-19 infection is not a fault. Active cop-
ing can be promoted by using the problem‐solving model 
[76, 77]. The findings hence have both practical and theo-
retical significance.

In  contrast  to  the  supportive  findings  regarding  the 
cognitive stress coping model, the mediation paths based 
on the maladaptive emotion regulation  (rumination and 
catastrophizing)  model  were  all  statistically  non-signifi-
cant. Such findings suggest that the cognitive stress cop-
ing  model  worked  better  than  the  emotion  regulation 
model  in  explaining  the  association  between  perceived 
social  support  and  BI-BV.  In  addition,  this  study  found 
that  active  coping  was  not  significantly  associated  with 
maladaptive  emotion  regulation.  The  two  findings  sug-
gest that in this case, cognitive coping and emotion regu-
lation are two separate processes. Also, there is no study 
looking  at  the  effects  of  coping  and  emotion  regulation 
jointly in the same model. The findings have thus added 
knowledge  to  the  discussion  comparing  the  coping  and 
emotion  regulation  processes.  Future  studies  are  war-
ranted to confirm the findings.

Furthermore,  there  is  a  dearth  of  studies  investigating 
the  role  of  emotion  regulation  in  determining  booster 
vaccination among PECC. The only study found in litera-
ture  reported  that  rumination  was  negatively  associated 
with  vaccination  behavior  [78].  In  contrast,  the  latent 
variable  of  maladaptive  emotion  regulation  was  posi-
tively, instead of negatively, associated with BI-BV in this 
study. An explanation is that rumination/catastrophizing 
may be seen as either a maladaptive emotion  regulation 
[37] or an expression of fear [79]. The former but not nec-
essarily the latter implies a negative association between 
maladaptive  emotion  regulation  and  BI-BV.  According 
to  the  fear  appeal  approach  [80],  ‘fight’  (removal  of  the 
source  of  fear)  or  ‘flight’  responses  (avoidance  of  think-
ing about the situation) may be evoked in a fearful con-
text. Booster vaccination may be seen as a ‘fight response’ 
to  fear,  instead  of  being  a  maladaptive  emotion  regula-
tion  outcome  which  should  be  negatively  associated 
with  BI-BV;  rumination/catastrophizing  may  be  seen 

as  an  expression  of  fear  that  initiated  a  fight  response 
that  would  lead  to  vaccination.  This  perspective  may 
partially  explain  the  ‘unexpected’  positive  association 
between  maladaptation  and  BI-BV.  As  active  coping  is 
an adaptive process, its positive association with BI-BV is 
expected and vaccination can be interpreted as an adap-
tive response.

Corroborating previous studies [20, 21, 81, 82] and sup-
porting  the  initial  hypotheses,  this  study  finds  that  per-
ceived  social  support  and  active  coping  were  positively 
associated  with  BI-BV  and  self-stigma  was  negatively 
associated  with  BI-BV.  No  study  has  investigated  the 
potential effects of self-stigma due to infection on BI-BV 
among  PECC  although  a  previous  study  looked  at  the 
similar effects in the general population [31]. As COVID-
19 affected almost every aspects of life [83], some PECC 
might  have  internalized  the  public  stigma,  and  worried 
about infecting often or bringing trouble to other people. 
Stigma and self-stigma regarding infectious diseases (e.g., 
HIV,  SARS,  and  H1N1)  were  common  [27,  84–86]  and 
were  barriers  against  health  service  utilization  [87].  It  is 
uncertain whether the level of self-stigma has subsided in 
the post-pandemic period; further research is needed.

A published paper was based on the same dataset that 
was  analyzed  in  the  present  paper  [14].  It  investigated 
associations  between  cognitive  factors  (e.g.  perceived 
susceptibility  to  COVID-19)/emotional  factors  (e.g.  ill-
ness  concern)  and  intention  to  take  COVID-19  booster 
vaccine  among  PECC  in  Hong  Kong  [14],  whereas  the 
present  paper  looked  at  the  associations  between  a  dif-
ferent  set  of  psychosocial  factors  (perceived  social  sup-
port  and  stigma)  and  behavior/intention  of  booster 
vaccination  as  well  as  mediators  between  the  associa-
tions  via  active  coping  and  emotional  regulation  among 
PECC.  The  dependent  variables  of  the  two  papers  were 
different—the current paper looked at both behavior and 
intention  whereas  the  other  paper  only  looked  at  inten-
tion of booster vaccination. Also, the current but not the 
former  paper  included  vaccinated  PECC  in  the  sample. 
These  two  papers  thus  presented  different  perspectives. 
Another  study  was  conducted  in  Hong  Kong  from  June 
20 to July 18, 2022 [88], which investigated multidimen-
sional determinants (e.g., perceptions, information expo-
sure, family influences, and mental distress) of first-dose 
COVID-19  vaccination  behavior  among  older  adults 
aged 60 years or above in the Hong Kong general popu-
lation.  The  current  and  the  other  two  published  papers 
thus  involve  different  objectives  and  study  populations; 
they  together  present  a  more  comprehensive  picture 
about COVID-19 vaccination in Hong Kong.

This study has innovative findings but also several limi-
tations.  First,  BI-BV  might  have  been  over-reported  as 
it  is  a  socially  desirable  behavior.  Second,  the  moderate 

Zhang et al. BMC Public Health          (2025) 25:659

response  rate  of  this  study  might  lead  to  selection  bias; 
characteristics  of  non-respondents  were,  however, 
unavailable  for  comparisons.  Third,  a  single  question 
was  used  to  assess  BI-BV,  although  similar  questions 
were  commonly  asked  in  previous  studies  [89,  90].  The 
dependent  variable  combined  vaccination  behavior 
with  intention  to  indicate  the  overall  vaccination  ten-
dency  after  receiving  a  COVID-19  diagnosis.  Fourth, 
the  study  did  not  record  the  exact  duration  since  diag-
nosis.  Yet,  as  the  survey  was  conducted  from  June  to 
August  2022  during  the  major  fifth  wave  outbreak  that 
peaked  after  February  2022,  the  majority  of  the  partici-
pants  had  been  diagnosed  for  less  than  six  months.  As 
vaccination  within  six  months  since  diagnosis  was  not 
recommended  to  PECC,  only  19  participants  had  taken 
up  a  booster  vaccination  after  receiving  their  COVID-
19  diagnosis  and  were  possibly  diagnosed  during  the 
early  phase  of  the  outbreak  and  interviewed  during  the 
late phase of the study period. A sensitivity analysis was 
conducted by removing such cases and the same findings 
were obtained. With a larger sample of the two groups, a 
comparison between factors of intention of booster vac-
cination  between  the  groups  could  be  conducted.  The 
overall  sample  size  of  230  was  not  large,  but  it  fits  into 
the rule of thumb for SEM analysis that there should be 
at least 10 cases per observed variables [91]. Fifth, recall 
bias  was  possible;  however,  its  size  should  be  minimum 
as the recall period was relatively short (< 6 months) and 
the  only  question  that  might  be  subject  to  recall  bias 
was  about  post-diagnosis  vaccination  (which  was  a  piv-
otal event) within the last six months. Sixth, temporal or 
causal  inferences  are  not  feasible  due  to  the  cross-sec-
tional  study  design;  longitudinal  studies  are  warranted. 
Seventh,  the  study  was  conducted  during  a  major  out-
break in Hong Kong, so it is uncertain whether the stud-
ied relationships would be stable and valid over time and 
in  the  post-pandemic  stage.  Similarly,  as  the  study  was 
conducted  among  PECC  in  Hong  Kong,  caution  should 
be  taken  when  generalizing  the  results  to  other  popula-
tions.  Eighth,  the  betas  of  the  significant  indirect  path 
were relatively small. Researchers have, however, pointed 
out that indirect effect of such sizes may be seen as ‘small 
but  not  negligible’  when  it  has  theoretical/practical 
implications [92, 93]. Notably, the mediation effect sizes 
of the three significant indirect paths were 27%, 21%, and 
5%;  the  total  mediation  size  of  53%  was  substantial;  the 
findings are certainly useful in understanding the mecha-
nisms between perceived social support and BI-BV. Last, 
there  are  other  unstudied  coping  strategies  apart  from 
active  coping.  Cautions  should  be  taken  when  claim-
ing  the  usefulness  of  the  stress  cognitive  coping  model, 
as  other  types  of  coping  strategies  may  have  different 
effects  on  BI-BV.  Similarly,  apart  from  rumination  and 

catastrophizing, there are also other unstudied maladap-
tive/adaptive  emotion  coping  responses  that  might  play 
different roles in explaining BI-BV.

Conclusions
This  study  identified  significant  associations  between 
perceived social support/self-stigma/active coping/mala-
daptive emotion regulation and BI-BV. Except the unex-
pected positive association involving maladaptive coping, 
the other significant associations with BI-BV followed the 
expected  directions.  A  key  finding  was  that  self-stigma 
and  active  coping  significantly,  both  individually  and 
serially,  mediated  between  perceived  social  support  and 
BI-BV.  The  indirect  paths  involving  emotion  regulation 
were  however,  all  statistically  non-significant,  signifying 
that coping (active coping) and maladaptive emotion reg-
ulation  (rumination/catastrophizing)  were  two  separate 
processes;  the  former  worked  better  than  the  latter  in 
explaining the mechanism between perceived social sup-
port  and  BI-BV.  These  findings  are  novel.  Interventions 
are  needed  to  increase  BI-BV  among  PECC  by  increas-
ing  perceived  social  support,  reducing  self-stigma,  and 
improving  active  coping.  Reminders  should  be  dissemi-
nated to the general public that COVID-19 remains prev-
alent  and  harmful  whereas  booster  vaccination  is  safe 
and efficacious. Longitudinal studies are needed to verify 
the findings.
