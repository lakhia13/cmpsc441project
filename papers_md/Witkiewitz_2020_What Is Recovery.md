isorder (AUD) is among t  he m  ost prevalent psychiatric disorders and i  s  
Alcohol use d 
associated with enormous  public  health costs.  Although AUD and other  addictive behaviors  
have been described as chronic relapsing conditions, most individuals who develop AUD 
will eventually recover. This narrative review provides an overview of definitions of recovery,  
with a focus on recovery from AUD. The  definitions reviewed include those developed  
by key stakeholder groups, as well as definitions derived from recent quantitative and  
qualitative studies of individuals who meet criteria for AUD and attempt to resolve their  
problems with or without treatment or who self-identify as pursuing or achieving recovery. 
The literature reviewed supports a definition of recovery as an ongoing dynamic process 
of behavior change characterized by relatively stable improvements in biopsychosocial  
functioning and purpose in life. The review concludes that definitions of recovery that rely 
solely on abstinence from alcohol and the absence of AUD symptoms fail to capture the  
multidimensional and heterogeneous pathways to recovery that are evident among individuals  
in general population and clinical samples.

INTRODUCTION 
Alcohol use is associated with tremendous social  
and economic costs and contributes to 5% of the  
global disease burden.1  Most of the costs are due  
to excessive drinking and alcohol use disorder  
(AUD), with AUD defined by the fifth edition of  
the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental  
Disorders  (DSM-5)  as  clinically  significant  
impairment or distress resulting from endorsing at  

least two of 11 symptoms in the past 12 months.2 
Based on epidemiological survey data in the United 
States, as many as 14% of individuals meet criteria 
for current AUD, and nearly one-third (29%) meet 
lifetime criteria for AUD.3 Importantly, data from 
national epidemiological surveys, prospective 
observational studies, and randomized clinical 
trials of patients with AUD and individuals who

engage in problem use of alcohol indicate that most 
affected persons will ultimately recover4—with  
“recovery” defined in various ways by different  
stakeholders including researchers, clinicians,  
mutual help groups, health care organizations and  
policymakers, and persons with AUD. 

Defining recovery consistently across studies 
and by various stakeholder groups is critical for 
advancing the science of AUD. First, through 
an agreed-upon definition of recovery, a better 
understanding can be gained of the clinical course 
of AUD and how AUD symptoms change over time. 
Second, an agreed-upon definition will facilitate 
the evaluation and dissemination of treatments for 
AUD, thereby increasing understanding of which 
treatments are associated with shorter- versus 
longer-term recovery from AUD and guiding 
development of new treatments to offer recovery 
support. Third, a definition of recovery will help 
individuals with AUD and their family and friends, 
health care providers and organizations, and 
policymakers gain a better understanding of the 
process of change in AUD and will help clarify 
expectations about change goals during the process 
of change. Fourth, operationalizing recovery may 
help to reduce the stigma associated with AUD by 
highlighting its possibility and prevalence and by 
providing both hope and a positive characterization 
of the AUD recovery process.5,6 

The goals of this narrative review are to 
examine historical and current definitions of  
recovery, which are variable across studies and  
stakeholders; to review recent quantitative,  
qualitative, and mixed-methods studies that  
have examined the recovery construct among  
individuals with AUD; and to provide a new  
conceptual definition of recovery that is based  
on recent empirical findings. The discussion  
begins with an overview of the major diagnostic  
systems developed by the American Psychiatric  
Association in DSM-5 and the World Health  
Organization  International Classification of  
Diseases  (ICD-10) and the definitions of AUD  
and remission based on those systems. Historical  
definitions of recovery are then reviewed as  
defined by the Temperance Movement, early  

medical literature, the “Big Book” of Alcoholics 
Anonymous,7 and the early behavior therapy 
movement. Current definitions of recovery as  
proposed by key stakeholder groups are considered  
next, followed by consideration of findings from  
quantitative and qualitative research that informs  
definitions  of  recovery  among  individuals  who  
are attempting to resolve alcohol-related problems  
with or without formal treatment and who do and  
do not identify as being in or achieving recovery.  
A final section concludes with a summary of  
common themes across definitions and proposes an  
expanded definition of recovery that emphasizes  
improvements in well-being and functioning. 

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 
OF AUD 
DSM-5 defines AUD based on meeting criteria for 
two of 11 symptoms in the past 12 months.2 The 
11 symptoms can be roughly organized into four 
symptom clusters: 
• Physiological correlates of alcohol use— 

(1) tolerance, (2) craving, and (3) symptoms of 
withdrawal; 

• Loss of control over alcohol use—(4) drinking 
longer or larger amounts than intended, and 
(5) unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control 
drinking; 

• Alcohol taking over other meaningful 

activities—(6) time spent in activities related to 
alcohol, and (7) other activities given up because 
of alcohol; and 

• Problems resulting from alcohol use— 

(8) failure to fulfill role obligations, (9) social 
or interpersonal problems, (10) physical or 
psychological problems, and (11) use in situations 
that are physically hazardous. 

DSM-5 also provides a definition of remission 

from AUD based on the length of time that 
symptoms are no longer present. Early remission 
is defined as greater than 3 months and less than 
12 months of endorsing no symptoms of AUD, 
with the exception of craving. Sustained remission 
is defined as 12 months or more of endorsing no 
symptoms of AUD, with the exception of craving.

Craving is excluded from definitions of remission 
given that craving could persist long after 
remission of other AUD symptoms is achieved.8 
ICD-10 defined alcohol dependence based on 
meeting three or more of six symptoms in the past 
12 months, including (1) t  olerance, (2) c  raving, 
(3)  physiological withdrawal, (4)  loss of control, 
(5)  alcohol taking over other activities, and 
(6)  problems resulting from alcohol use.9 ICD-11  
defines alcohol dependence as endorsement of 
two of three core features in the past 12 months, 
including (1) i  mpaired control over alcohol, 
often including craving; (2) a  lcohol becomes 
increasingly prioritized in life, often despite 
problems; and (3)  physiological features caused by 
pharmacological  tolerance  and  withdrawal.10 ICD-
11 also includes codes for early full remission, 
defined as abstinence from alcohol lasting 1 to 12 
months; sustained partial remission, defined as 
“significant reduction in alcohol consumption for 
more than 12 months” and not meeting criteria 
for ICD-11 alcohol dependence; and sustained 
full remission, defined as abstinence from alcohol 
lasting 12 months or longer.11  Thus, according to 
ICD-11, full remission (early or sustained) requires 
abstinence from alcohol, and partial remission is 
defined by reductions in drinking and the absence 
of symptoms of disorder. In contrast, as noted 
above, the DSM-5 definition of remission is based 
solely on not meeting symptoms of the disorder 
and does not consider alcohol consumption. 

DEFINITIONS OF RECOVERY 

Historical Perspectives and Definitions 
of Recovery 
As early as the late 1700s, American physician 
Benjamin Rush wrote about the effects of alcohol 
on the human body and mind, as well as potential 
remedies for “curing the ardent use of spirits on 
the body and mind.”12  Rush noted that abstinence 
from liquor was critical, while allowing 
consumption of larger quantities of beer or wine 
as acceptable substitutes for liquor. He concluded: 
“By the temporary use of these substitutes for 
spirits, I have never known the transition to sober 

habits, to be attended with any bad effects but 
often with permanent health of body, and peace of 
mind” (p. 32). 

This very early harm reduction perspective 

contrasts with the subsequent focus of the 
Temperance Movement on ridding society of 
alcohol. The movement was active through the 
remainder of the 1800s and into the early 1900s 
and had many distinct groups and societies. 
Initially, the Temperance Movement focused 
on promoting abstinence from liquor, then 
transitioned to a singular goal of abstinence 
from alcohol, and later advocated for the legal 
prohibition of alcohol.14  Inebriate asylums, which 
required abstinence from alcohol, emerged as a 
residential treatment option in the 1840s.13 

The Temperance Movement was followed by 
the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 
the 1930s,14  and AA has since had tremendous 
influence on modern conceptualizations of 
recovery. AA proposed a mutual help program 
defined by a 12-step recovery process for achieving 
and maintaining lifelong abstinence from alcohol. 
The “Big Book” of AA, first published in 1939, 
also made very clear that abstinence from alcohol 
was not sufficient to define recovery.7  The  Big  
Book describes the process of recovery through  
many of the chapters as a journey that includes  
major transformative changes that lead to  
improvements in health, functioning, and well-
being.7 Most of the 12 steps focus on addressing 
and resolving past and present problems associated 
with “alcoholism,” a term first used by Swedish 
physician Magnus Huss in the mid-1800s. 

In the mid-20th century, biostatistician and 
physiologist E. M. Jellinek led several initiatives 
aimed at increasing the study and dissemination 
of science related to “alcoholism,” including 
early work studying members of AA and patients 
in treatment. Jellinek also proposed the disease 
concept of alcoholism, which he characterized 
as a progressive and chronic disease with several 
variants or “species.”).15(pp154-158)  Glatt expanded 
on Jellinek’s model by developing a plan for 
rehabilitation and remission through a group 
treatment program largely based on AA principles

and practices.16  Early work by Edwards further 
helped define the disease concept,17  and pioneering 
work by Vaillant shed light on the possibility that 
individuals with AUD could recover in the absence 
of treatment.18  Thus, early work was heavily 
influenced by AA, and abstinence was generally 
considered critical to recovery until the late 1900s. 
In the 1970s, psychiatrist Mansell Pattison 

and psychologists Mark and Linda Sobell 
introduced modern behavioral conceptualizations 
of alcohol dependence that have replaced 
the disease concept of alcohol dependence 
in research and evidence-based treatments.19 
They defined alcohol dependence as a serious 
health problem “defined by drinking patterns 
and the adverse physical, psychological and/ 
or social consequences of such drinking”; 
considered patterns of alcohol use as “lying on 
a continuum ranging from non-pathological to 
severely pathological” and noted that problem 
development “follows variable patterns over time 
and does not necessarily proceed inexorably 
to severe fatal stages;” and concluded that 
“[r]ecovery from alcohol dependence bears 
no necessary relation to abstinence, although 
such a concurrence is frequently the case” 
(pp. 4  -5). This seminal reconceptualization 
of alcohol dependence and recovery remains 
relevant  and  influential  in  current  research  on  
AUD today. It was foundational in behavior 
therapy research and practice beginning in the 
1970s to the present, a movement that produced 
evidence-based treatments in use today, including 
relapse  prevention,  motivational  interviewing,  
reinforcement-based  treatments, and  cognitive  
behavioral therapy for AUD. 

Also in the 1970s, the Sobells’ clinical  
research demonstrating controlled drinking  
outcomes (defined as drinking fewer than 4.3  
standard drinks on most days with allowance  
of up to 6.5 drinks for an isolated 1- or 2-day  
sequence) among a subset of treated patients  
with alcohol dependence sparked virulent  
controversy and challenged the then dominant  
view that recovery required lifelong abstinence.20 
Subsequent research has replicated and extended 

their  findings.21  Although  specific  quantity/ 
frequency criteria used to define low- versus high-
risk drinking practices are somewhat variable  
across studies and countries, low-risk drinking  
is now well established as a favorable outcome  
among persons previously diagnosed with AUD.  
For example, in the United States, low-risk  
drinking has been defined as consumption of  
fewer than  14  drinks per week with fewer than  
four  drinks on any given day for men and fewer  
than se  ven  drinks per week with fewer than three  
drinks on any given day for women. In contrast,  
consumption criteria considered indicative of  
higher-risk drinking practices are any occasions  
of more than 1  4 d  rinks weekly or more than  
five  drinks  daily  for  men  and  more  than  seven  
drinks weekly or more than four drinks daily for  
women.22 As discussed in the rest of this paper 
and elsewhere,4,23 these criteria have been widely 
adopted in recovery research, but have been found 
wanting as an outcome metric on several grounds 
and have contributed to a lesser focus on measures 
of well-being and functioning, which are central to 
most current definitions of recovery. 

Current Definitions of Recovery 
Recent  illustrative  definitions  of  recovery  
(summarized in Table 1) have focused on the  
importance of functioning and general well-being  
in defining recovery. For example, the Substance  
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  
(SAMHSA) advanced a working definition of  
recovery as “a process of change through which  
individuals improve their health and wellness,  
live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their  
full  potential.”5 SAMHSA noted the importance  
of abstinence as one example of achieving  
improvements in health. Similarly, the Betty Ford  
Institute Consensus Panel in 2007 defined recovery  
as “a voluntarily maintained lifestyle characterized  
by sobriety, personal health, and citizenship.”24(p222) 
Similar to the Big Book of AA, these definitions  
acknowledge  that abstinence  is  not a  sufficient  
condition for recovery and that an individual who  
merely abstains from alcohol, with little or no  
improvement in functioning or well-being, would

not be considered to be in recovery. In 2017, a  
Recovery Science Research Collaborative meeting  
was convened by recovery researchers with a  
specific  focus  on  examining  the  concept  of  recovery  
based on a literature review and ideas generated  
by group members.25 Their final definition was: 
“Recovery is an individualized, intentional, 
dynamic, and relational process involving sustained 
efforts to improve wellness.” 25(p5) This definition 

acknowledges the presence and importance of  
individual differences in the recovery process;  
it focuses on the recovery process as being both  
intentional and dynamic and as requiring sustained  
efforts to improve wellness. Improving wellness  
includes not only the physical benefits associated  
with reducing alcohol use,26 but also benefits related 
to psychosocial and functional dimensions of 
wellness (e.g., social, emotional, financial).27

On balance, similar to AA’s view that recovery 
is optimally broad in scope, these recent consensus 
definitions of recovery focus heavily on enhanced 
well-being and functional improvements in areas 
adversely affected by drinking. They do not 
emphasize or are silent about changes in drinking 
or achieving abstinence. These characterizations, 
as well as recent empirical research on AUD 
recovery (described next), are similar to definitions 
of recovery for other psychiatric disorders (e.g., 
depression, schizophrenia) that emphasize 
recovery of functioning and do not require 
absence of any symptoms. These definitions differ 
from definitions of recovery from other health 
conditions such as cancer, that do not require 
improvement in well-being and quality of life. 

EMPIRICAL RESEARCH 
EXAMINING RECOVERY 
AMONG INDIVIDUALS 
WITH AUD 

Recent Quantitative Research 
on Recovery 
As summarized by Tucker et al., research using 
both clinical and non-treatment-seeking samples 
has shown that the majority of individuals who 
develop AUD reduce or resolve their problem 
over time.4 The pathways to improvement are 
heterogeneous, may occur with or without 
participation in treatment or mutual help groups, 
and involve improved functioning and well-being 
with or without reductions in drinking. Several 
lines of quantitative research, ranging from 
treatment outcome to naturalistic observational 
studies, have converged to support this expanded 
characterization of improvement in alcohol-related 
problems. Collectively, this body of work questions 
conventional views that alcohol and other drug use 
disorders are “chronically relapsing” conditions, 
for which treatment or mutual help group 
involvement is essential for recovery.28,29 

For example, using data-driven approaches to 
studying longer-term outcomes among individuals 
with AUD who enrolled in clinical trials targeting 

AUD, Witkiewitz and colleagues followed 
treatment recipients for 3 years and identified 
four  profiles  of  individuals  based  on  intensity  
and frequency of alcohol consumption, as well 
as other indicators of health and well-being: 
(1)  low-functioning frequent heavy drinkers, 
(2)  low-functioning infrequent heavy drinkers, 
(3)  high-functioning occasional heavy drinkers, 
and (4)  high-functioning infrequent non–heavy 
drinkers.30  Relative to high-functioning infrequent 
non–heavy drinkers, individuals who were 
high-functioning occasional heavy drinkers 
had lower baseline alcohol dependence severity, 
lower abstinence self-efficacy, and lower AA 
involvement, but they did not differ on other 
measures  of  functioning.  High-functioning  
occasional heavy drinkers had significantly higher 
purpose in life compared to poor-functioning 
profiles and greater satisfaction with life compared 
to abstainers. Beyond portraying a broader 
representation of AUD outcomes to include 
both consumption and functioning, this work 
also helped clarify factors that may contribute 
to both consumption and functional outcomes. 
At baseline, greater social support for drinking 
predicted heavier drinking. Better mental health— 
including less severe psychiatric symptoms, 
depression, and anger—and greater purpose in life 
at 1 year following treatment were significantly 
associated with higher functioning at 3  years 
following treatment. Social support at 3 years 
following treatment was also greatest among the 
higher-functioning profiles. These findings were 
recently replicated in an independent sample.31 
Using a similar data-driven approach, 
Witbrodt and colleagues identified five latent 
classes based on recovery elements reported in 
in-depth interviews and surveys completed by 
9,341  individuals  who  self-identified  as  being  in  
recovery. The five classes were characterized as 
(1) 1  2-step traditionalist, (2) 1  2-step enthusiast, 
(3) s  ecular, (4)  self-reliant, and (5)  atypical.6,32 
Individuals in the 12-step traditionalist and 
enthusiast classes were most likely to have been 
or to be currently engaged in AA or other 12-step 
programs and were mostly abstinent. Those in the 

6 

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
secular, self-reliant, and atypical recovery classes 
were less likely to be abstinent or engaged in 12-
step programs. Across all five classes, four items 
were commonly endorsed from among the top 10 
ranking items as important to recovery: (1)  being 
honest with oneself, (2)  handling negative feelings 
without using drugs or alcohol, (3)  being able to 
enjoy life, and (4) e  ngaging in a process of growth 
and development. 

In prospective research that followed a 
community sample of individuals who drank 
alcohol over 20 years, Moos and colleagues found 
that cognitions, attitudes, and beliefs, as well as 
contextual, social, and environmental factors, 
were critically important in predicting long-term 
reductions in drinking.33,34  In terms of the role of 
drinking, any drinking was not predictive of long-
term negative outcomes, but persistent average 
heavy drinking and heavy episodic drinking were 
each associated with greater problems related to 
alcohol  use.35 

Natural recovery studies also have highlighted 

the role of contextual variables in different 
pathways to AUD resolution. Tucker and 
colleagues conducted a series of studies guided 
by behavioral economics among individuals 
with AUD who resolved a drinking problem 
in the absence of treatment.36,37 In addition to 
showing that many participants maintained 
stable abstinence or low-risk drinking without 
problems over 1- to 2-year follow-ups, this 
research distinguished those who maintained 
low-risk drinking from other outcome groups by 
how they handled their monetary spending before 
and after they initially stopped problem drinking 
(i.e., pre-resolution). Pre-resolution, participants 
who achieved stable low-risk drinking outcomes 
had more balanced allocations between spending 
on alcohol versus saving money for the future 
compared to those who remained abstinent or 
relapsed and who spent proportionately more 
on alcohol than savings. After initial resolution, 
the spending patterns of stable low-risk drinkers 
changed in ways that led to receipt of heretofore 
delayed large rewards (housing in particular) that 
yielded ongoing lifestyle benefits. By comparison, 

after resolution, participants who remained 
abstinent or relapsed spent less overall and tended 
to spend on smaller rewards (e.g., consumable 
goods, entertainment, gifts) throughout the post-
resolution year, appearing to substitute alcohol 
with small frequent substance-free rewards. 
Thus, different recovery-relevant outcomes were 
associated with patterns and contexts of non-
drinking behaviors before and after a quit attempt. 
Another issue informed by recent quantitative 

research concerns the typical number of quit 
attempts before recovery is achieved. Kelly and 
colleagues surveyed a national sample of adults 
in the United States who successfully resolved a 
significant substance use problem and assessed 
the number of prior recovery attempts and the 
relationships between recovery attempts and post-
recovery measures of psychological well-being 
and quality of life.38 The mean, median, and modal 
numbers of recovery attempts were 5.4, 2.0, and 
1.0, respectively; however, the distribution was 
positively skewed and included outliers, suggesting 
that a subgroup of individuals require many more 
attempts to change than others and may require a 
higher level of care. Another subset of participants 
reported not making a prior serious change 
attempt. These results are similar to another arm 
of the National Recovery Study, which reported 
reasons why individuals did not adopt or dropped 
the label “recovery” (e.g., putting problem behind 
them, perceiving low problem severity).39 

Collectively, these studies support adoption 
of a more flexible definition of recovery (or other 
inclusive term) that focuses on improvements 
in areas of functioning adversely affected by 
drinking and enhanced access to non-drinking 
rewards.  Furthermore,  beneficial  changes  in  
limited areas of alcohol-related dysfunction 
and reductions in drinking can occur that 
contribute to improved health and well-being, 
even if they fall short of traditional definitions 
of recovery that emphasize abstinence as a 
required element. Although recent research is 
consistent in supporting these conclusions, they 
are advanced preliminarily, given that each of the 
aforementioned findings are from single studies

and require additional investigation to establish 
their robustness and generalizability across diverse 
AUD populations. 

Recent Qualitative and Mixed-Methods 
Research on Recovery 
Mixed-methods research in the United States and 
the United Kingdom has elucidated elements of 
recovery from the perspective of persons seeking 
to resolve AUD, and findings show consistencies 
with quantitative research on recovery. For 
example, Kaskutas and colleagues surveyed 
9,341  individuals  who  self-identified  as  being  in  
recovery to delineate specific aspects of recovery 
from the perspective of persons engaged in the 
process.6 The survey consisted of 47 elements of 
recovery developed via initial qualitative work, 
which participants rated as (1)  definitely belonging 
in their definition of recovery; (2)  somewhat 
belonging in their definition of recovery; (3)  not 
belonging in their definition, but potentially 
belonging in others’ definitions of recovery; and 
(4)  not belonging in a definition of recovery. Based 
on  exploratory  and  confirmatory  factor  analyses,  
35 elements were retained, and a four-factor 
solution emerged: (1) abs
recovery, (3)  enriched recovery, and (4)  spirituality 
in recovery. The “essentials of recovery” factor 
refers to ways of being considered crucial to 
maintaining changes in alcohol and drug use 
(e.g., dealing with challenging negative feelings, 
realistic self-appraisal). This factor is distinct 
from the “enriched recovery” factor, which refers 
to an individual’s ability to look inward (e.g., 
inner peace) and outward (e.g., living a life that 
contributes to others and society) and to engage in 
self-care. The six elements endorsed by more than 
90% of participants as definitely belonging to their 
recovery definition were classified in the “essential 
recovery” and “enriched recovery” factors and 
were not in the “abstinence” factor.

Neale and colleagues developed a new patient-
reported outcome measure of recovery from drug 
and alcohol dependence, named the Substance Use 
Recovery Evaluator (SURE), which incorporates 
input from addiction psychiatrists and staff as 

lf-care, and  

well as individuals in recovery (e.g., former and 
current users of drug and alcohol services).40 
Based  on  exploratory  and  confirmatory  factor  
analyses, 21 items were retained, and a five-factor  
solution emerged: (1)  substance use, (2) m  aterial  
resources, (3)  outlook on life, (4) se 
(5)  relationships. Similar to the findings of Kaskutas  
and colleagues,6  only six of the 21 items pertained  
specifically to substance use–related recovery  
outcomes.40  SURE provides a patient-centered  
method to assess a broad range of recovery-related  
outcomes valued and experienced by those who  
embark on various pathways toward recovery. 
In addition to recent efforts to understand 
the concept of recovery from the perspective of 
persons attempting it, another body of research 
has investigated mechanisms of behavior change 
that may help explain how individuals are able 
to recover. For example, Best and colleagues 
developed the Social Identity Model of Recovery,41 
which, when applied to alcohol recovery, posits 
that an individual’s social identity shifts during 
recovery and becomes defined more by the norms 
and behaviors of individuals who do not use 
alcohol (e.g., family members, spouse, friends, 
members of AA) than by those who drink alcohol. 
Research on AA has similarly shown that higher 
rates of AA attendance are associated with greater 
rates of abstinence and with reporting having 
more non-drinking friends.42 AA engagement also 
has been found to be a catalyst for social network 
change that facilitates recovery.43 

These findings highlight how changes in one’s 

social identity and social network may support 
AUD recovery. Further investigation of social 
identity models, the role of social networks, 
and patient-centered research on the recovery 
experience is important for broadening the scope 
of assessment of recovery-relevant outcomes. In 
addition to contributing knowledge about how 
people recover, such qualitative research can 
inform improvements in alcohol services that 
are responsive to the preferences and needs of 
consumers of services and thus may help close 
the long-standing gap between need and alcohol 
services utilization.

WHAT IS RECOVERY? 
CONCEPTUALIZATION AND 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR 
RESEARCH AND PRACTICE 

Drawing from prior definitions and informed  
by recent empirical work, the authors  
conclude that recovery is a process of behavior  
change characterized by improvements in  
biopsychosocial functioning and purpose in life.  
As shown in Table 1, this conceptualization of  
recovery is similar to definitions of recovery  
developed by SAMHSA and the Recovery  
Science Research Collaborative, and it aligns  
with the empirical findings from Kaskutas,  
Neale,  Kelly,  and  Witkiewitz, among  others. 
These conceptualizations of recovery, including  
that of the authors, differ from the Betty Ford  
Institute Consensus Panel, which requires  
abstinence. Similarities across definitions of  
recovery shown in Table 1 indicate that alcohol  
recovery is a process that is dynamic and  
focuses on improvement of health and wellness.  
Definitions differ with respect to the inclusion of  
language pertaining to abstinence or changes and  
improvement in biopsychosocial functioning and  
purpose in life. 

Based on the available literature, the authors 
question the validity of any definitions of recovery 
that rely solely on abstinence from alcohol or the 
absence of AUD symptoms and fail to consider 
changes in other outcomes related to improved 
functioning and purpose in life. Abstinence will 
be important for some individuals to start the 
recovery process and will likely contribute to 
the abatement of many AUD symptoms, both of 
which may be important for some individuals in 
the recovery process. But this is not universal, and 
limiting definitions of recovery to the elimination 
of alcohol consumption and AUD symptoms fails 
to capture the multidimensional and heterogeneous 
pathways to recovery that are evident in general 
population samples, as well as among patients who 
receive alcohol  treatment.23

Such a shift in emphasis involves reducing 
the focus on a pathology-based conception of 

AUD recovery in favor of incorporating a broader 
strengths-based, resilience-building approach 
to behavior change.44 Focusing on strengths and 
building resilience may shift emphasis toward 
helping people live the life of greatest value to 
them, which differs from most clinical treatment 
models and practices that focus on amelioration 
of disease. Examples of tactics to facilitate this 
goal include building and strengthening social 
and community ties, increasing physical activity, 
and increasing non–substance reinforcement 
and activities that do not require alcohol use. 
Clinically, many practitioners using evidence-
based treatment approaches are likely already 
working in alignment with this conceptualization 
of recovery, which takes a whole person approach 
to clinical care and focuses on individual strengths, 
strengthening resilience, and engagement with 
community support systems. Achieving and 
maintaining financial stability, as well as housing  
and food security, is also critically important.  
Future work is needed to ascertain whether  
reduced alcohol consumption and remission from  
AUD symptoms are essential elements in defining  
recovery or whether a strengths-based model that  
focuses  on  well-being  and functioning  is  sufficient  
to characterize recovery from AUD, or if some  
combination of relative emphasis on these two  
broad domains is optimal. 

In the AUD field, this shift in emphasis toward 
improved functioning is exemplied by the concept 
of “recovery capital” introduced by Granfield 
and Smith in the context of understanding and 
promoting natural recovery without treatment.45 
Their approach focused on building and using 
internal and external resources (e.g., social, 
physical, cultural, community) needed for initiation 
and maintenance of recovery and recognized 
that recovery capital varies across individuals 
and is changeable over time. Yet, most American 
treatment programs remain focused on initiation 
and maintenance of abstinence, and relatively few 
address improving well-being, functioning, and life 
satisfaction. Mutual help groups offer fellowship 
and support, an important element of recovery 
capital and positive psychology approaches to

behavior change. So the field has made some 
progress in shifting away from a pathology-based 
model toward a strengths-based model of AUD 
recovery. However, these developments have 
largely been limited to behavioral treatments and 
recovery attempts outside the context of formal 
treatment, and many clinical treatment programs 
have not expanded their focus beyond reducing or 
eliminating alcohol use and associated symptoms. 
Importantly, a shift in focus toward health and 
well-being should not go too far, as is the case in 
definitions of recovery that focus heavily on good 
citizenship and giving back to communities. As 
discussed by Lancaster, definitions of recovery 
should never require superhuman changes, and 
expecting a great abundance of citizenship and 
other aspirational goals among those in recovery 
“fail[s] to take into account the differences in 
the normative and social contexts of people’s 
lives.”46(p758)  Some individuals who are in the 
process of recovery live in societal and cultural 
systems of disadvantage with ongoing experiences 
of discrimination that cannot be remediated through 
individual effort and are made more acute by the 
stigma of addiction.47 

More generally, given that alcohol use is 
legal among adults and consuming alcohol 
without problems is socially normative behavior, 
the stigma of AUD is exacerbated when total 
abstinence from alcohol is a defining feature 
of health and well-being for one subgroup of 
individuals (those meeting AUD criteria) and is 
absent as a defining feature of health and well-
being for another much larger subgroup (those 
not meeting AUD criteria). Moreover, defining 
recovery by abstinence reinforces the empirically 
debunked belief that alcohol is harmful only for 
those with AUD and that they can never drink 
again. Instead, from a public health perspective, it 
is crucial to focus on reductions in risks associated 
with drinking as the primary target for all 
individuals in the population, not just those with 
AUD. This is justified given the known deleterious 
effects of excessive alcohol consumption on 

health27,48  and the well-established prevention 
paradox, i.e., greater health improvements at 
the population level will come from even small 
reductions in alcohol use by risky drinkers with 
less serious problems, who far outnumber the 
small minority of individuals who meet criteria for 
severe AUD.23 Furthermore, recent work indicates 
that presenting information about AUD as existing 
on a continuum of severity, as compared to a 
disease model orientation of presence or absence 
of AUD, was associated with greater problem 
recognition among non–treatment-seeking heavy 
drinkers.49 Defining AUD and recovery from AUD 
on a continuum could increase help seeking and/or 
promote self-change among individuals with AUD. 
In conclusion, the authors define recovery as 

a dynamic process of change characterized by 
improvements in health and social functioning, as 
well as increases in well-being and purpose in life. 
The empirical literature compels this extension 
of definitions of recovery beyond a singular focus 
on drinking and symptom reduction to include 
facilitation and support of improved well-being 
during active recovery and beyond. Like prior 
work in the field, this definition is still conceptual, 
and future work is needed to validate a formal 
operational definition of recovery that recognizes 
that positive change often occurs in multiple 
domains, that recovery may lie along continua, 
and that there is no singular recovery pathway. The 
use of standardized instruments that are already 
widely used in the field—such as the World Health 
Organization’s Quality of Life measure50 and 
future research on SURE40—could move us closer 
to having a formal operational definition that 
could be widely useful for individuals with AUD, 
their families, providers, policymakers, and other 
stakeholder groups.
