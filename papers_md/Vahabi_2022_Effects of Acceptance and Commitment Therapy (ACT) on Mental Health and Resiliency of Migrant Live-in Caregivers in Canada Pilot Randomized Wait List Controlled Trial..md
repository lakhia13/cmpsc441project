Abstract

Background:  Temporary migrant live-in caregivers constitute a vulnerable stream of temporary foreign workers in Canada.
This is because the majority are racialized women from the Global South, the gendered nature of caregiving work has historically
been undervalued, and their working and living spheres are intertwined which makes application of labor laws and surveillance
almost  impossible.  Their  invisible  position  in  the  fabric  of  Canadian  society  along  with  their  precarious  employment  and
immigration  status  place  their  mental  health  at  jeopardy.  There  is  a  paucity  of  research  about  psychological  support  for  this
population.

Objective:  Our pilot study Women Empowerment—Caregiver Acceptance and Resilience E-Learning (WE2CARE) aimed to
assess the efficacy of a 6-week online delivery of a psychological intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy
(ACT) in reducing psychological distress and promoting resiliency among live-in care givers in the Greater Toronto Area.

Methods:  A pilot randomized wait list controlled design was used. Participants were recruited by two community peer champions
working with community health organizations serving migrant live-in caregivers. A total of 36 participants were recruited and
randomly assigned to the intervention and wait list control groups; 7 dropped out of the study due to competing life priorities.
Standardized self-reported surveys were administered online pre-, post-, and 6-week postintervention to assess mental distress
(DASS-21),  psychological  flexibility  (AAQ-2),  mindfulness  (CAMS-R),  and  Multi-System  Model  of  Resilience  (MSMR-I).
Independent and dependent t tests were used to compare study outcomes at pre, post, and 6-week follow-up across and within
both arms of the study. Linear mixed effects models were created for each outcome of interest from baseline to postintervention
among intervention and control participants. Self-reported impact of the WE2CARE intervention was examined using independent
t tests across the study arms.

Results:  Average age of participants was 38 years. Many were born in the Philippines (23/29, 79%). The data on the impact of
the psychological intervention showed a lower level of depression, anxiety, and stress among the intervention group compared
with the control. However, the differences were not significant due to small sample size and COVID-19 crisis (6.94 vs 9.50,
P=.54; 6.94 vs 10.83, P=.20; 7.76 vs 10.33, P=.44, respectively). There was a significant improvement in mindful qualities and
external resilience, particularly in life satisfaction and accessible support among the intervention group (37.18 vs 32.92, t22=2.35,
P=.03; 20.29 vs 16.5, t21=2.98, P=.007; 8.47 vs 6.75, t14=2.41, P=.03; 7.59 vs 5.33, t16=.008, respectively).
Conclusions:  WE2CARE is among the first studies exploring the efficacy of online delivery of ACT in addressing mental health
challenges among live-in caregivers. While there are increased web-based ACT interventions, few use group videoconferencing
to promote peer connection and mutual support. WE2CARE showed promising results in reducing psychological distress and

promoting mindfulness and resiliency. The intervention highly motivated participants to engage collectively in building social

Introduction

The  Caregiver  Program,  previously  known  as  the  Live-in
Caregiver  Program,  is  a  stream  of  the  Canadian  Temporary
Foreign  Workers  Program,  which  engages  workers  in  home
caregiving  [1,2].  Workers  who  enter  the  country  under  this
program constitute an underrepresented and vulnerable stream
of temporary foreign workers in Canada since more than 90%
of  workers  are  women  of  color  from  the  Global  South;  their
employment  falls  in  the  purview  of  feminized  work  that
historically and globally has been devalued, dehumanized, and
underpaid;  and  the  location  of  their  services  situated  in  the
private sphere derails the application of labor laws, government
surveillance, and unionization [3-5].

Under the Live-in Caregiver Program, migrant caregivers were
restricted to work and live only for the employers stated on their
work permits while providing care to their employers’ children,
seniors, or disabled family members. Despite Caregiver Program
reforms in November 2014 which provided caregivers with the
option  of  living  outside  of  their  employers’ homes,  most
caregivers  continued  to  live  with  their  employer  due  to  low
wages, inability to afford independent housing, and precarious
work permits [6].

Most  caregivers  are  racialized  women  from  lower-  or
middle-income countries, with the majority coming from the
Philippines  and  a  growing  number  from  Haiti,  Africa,  Latin
America, and Asia [1,3,7]. They are often the sole provider of
income  for  their  families  back  home,  and  their  need  to  send
regular  remittances  forces  them  to  accept  a  submissive  and
discriminatory  position,  relinquish  their  basic  human  rights,
and  submit  to  precarious  employment,  financial  exploitation
(low  wages,  long  working  hours  without  compensation),
emotional and physical abuse, and having little to no access to
social or health care services despite paying into these programs
[3,8,9]. Furthermore, the possibility of applying for permanent
residency  for  not  only  themselves  but  also  their  immediate
family members after completing 24 months of service often
acts as an impetus for caregivers’ acceptance of their dire living
and  working  conditions  in  Canada.  Considering  that  family
separation  is  one  of  the  requirements  for  caregivers’ work
permits in Canada under both the Live-in Caregiver Program
and  Caregiver  Program,  securing  permanent  residency  for
caregivers  symbolizes  the  hope  for  family  reunification.  It  is
noteworthy that the process of gaining permanent residency for
this group can take from 4 to 10 years. While Caregiver Program
reforms  in  November  2014  have  included  a  commitment  to
reduce processing times for permanent residency of caregivers

[10,11], the processing time until 2016 remained at a minimum
average of 6 years.

Most  studies  with  temporary  migrant  workers  explored  their
vulnerability  in  the  areas  of  occupational  injury  and  hazard,
sexual  and  reproductive  health,  and  chronic  and  infectious
diseases  like  HIV/AIDS  [12-20].  These  vulnerabilities  have
been reported to be associated to temporary migrant workers’
working and living conditions such as discrimination, precarious
work  permit  and  immigration  status,  stigma,  limited  social
support, and fear of job loss (12,14,17-20].

Although live-in caregivers face a multitude of challenges in
the host countries, there is limited research related to the impact
of these challenges on their mental health. The few studies that
have  explored  this  issue  found  a  high  level  of  psychological
distress, feeling of alienation and loneliness, and limited social
support  [9,21].  Multiple  barriers  to  accessing  mental  health
services were also reported including long working hours, fear
of  job  loss  and  deportation,  and  limited  knowledge  about
available mental health resources. Considering these barriers,
offering  online  psychosocial  support  programs  can  be  an
effective  strategy  in  reducing  temporary  migrant  live-in
caregivers’ psychological distress and promoting their mental
well-being.

Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  is  a  cognitive
behavioral  approach  that  promotes  psychological  flexibility.
Psychological  flexibility  is  the  aptitude  of  adjusting  to  any
situational demand which in turn allows for living a meaningful
life. ACT targets psychological flexibility through advancing
6  core  skills:  acceptance  (experiences  of  both  pleasant  and
unpleasant thoughts, emotions, and feelings instead of trying
to avoid or control them), defusion (stepping back and observing
thoughts  as  thoughts),  contact  with  the  present  moment
(consciously  engaging  in  any  moment  and  being  mindful  of
thoughts, feelings, and actions), self-as-context (awareness and
self-perspective), values (being clear about what matters), and
committed action (taking actions that are guided by one’s values)
[22,23]. All these processes can be viewed as efforts directed
at  relinquishing  antecedent  stimulus  control  that  exist  due  to
verbal  conditioning.  In  other  words,  ACT  does  not  focus  on
reducing  clinical  symptoms  but  rather  aims  at  altering  their
behavioral  impact.  This  is  done  through  deconstructing  the
individual  experience  in  the  context  of  personal  values  and
acceptance  of  both  negative  and  positive  components  of
experience. Acceptance and mindfulness are core processes of
psychological flexibility [24,25].

A  significant  body  of  literature  has  provided  support  for  the
efficacy  of  ACT  in  promoting  well-being  and  reducing

(page number not for citation purposes)

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH

Vahabi et al

psychological  distress  among  both  clinical  and  nonclinical
populations [26-29]. Furthermore, the internet-based delivery
of ACT has been reported to be promising in managing anxiety,
depression,  chronic  pain,  and  distress  related  to  trauma  and
promoting mental wellness and psychological flexibility [30-32].

(supportive  environment,  community  engagement)  and
downstream (individual coping, self-care) strategies to address
the urgent mental health needs of live-in caregivers. To address
the  latter,  we  applied  culturally  safe  and  adult  learning
principles.

Engaging migrant live-in caregivers in learning ACT skills can
support  their  mental  health  by  decreasing  distress  through
strategies  like  mindfulness,  defusion  from  negative  thoughts,
and increasing committed action consistent with the value of
self-care  (eg,  engaging  in  culturally  syntonic  activities  like
singing or praying and building social support networks). Given
that  live-in  caregivers  work  long  hours  and  have  extremely
limited  free  time  and  restricted  social  support,  a  web-based
approach is the best-suited medium for the delivery of self-help
psychological treatment in this population. Earlier studies with
this population reported a preference for online health resources
among this population due to their precarious work permit and
fear of repatriation—being sick or seeking medical care may
put  their  livelihood  in  jeopardy  [9,21].  This  approach  offers
flexible access while promoting virtual social connection. To
our  knowledge  there  is  a  paucity  of  research  about  the
internet-delivered
suitability  of  an 
effectiveness  and 
psychological intervention based on ACT for this population.

Our pilot study, Women Empowerment—Caregiver Acceptance
and Resilience E-Learning (WE2CARE), aimed to address this
gap by exploring the efficacy of a 6-week online psychological
intervention  based  on  ACT  for  temporary  migrant  live-in
caregivers.

Methods

Theoretical Framework
Our  study  was  guided  by  the  population  health  promotion
framework, which is grounded in the principles of social justice
and equity [33-35]. This framework acknowledges that health
disparities  are  the  outcomes  of  myriad  social  determinants
including access to physical, psychological, social, and financial
security. In this study, we recognized that the life circumstances
of  live-in  caregivers  are  shaped  by  systemic  issues  in  both
Canada  and  their  countries  of  origin.  As  upstream  strategies
(policy reform and resource redistribution) will take years to
implement and achieve, it was critical to implement midstream

Design
A  pilot  community-based  mixed  methods  study  was  used  to
examine the feasibility and efficacy of WE2CARE in reducing
psychological  distress  (depression,  anxiety,  and  stress)  and
promoting committed actions of self-care and identify perceived
barriers and facilitators to using WE2CARE. In this paper, we
report only on the findings from the quantitative component of
the study, which consisted of a randomized controlled wait list
design  and  explored  the  feasibility  and  efficacy  of  the
intervention.

Participants and Recruitment Strategies
The study protocol received ethical approval from the research
ethics review boards at the affiliated universities. Those included
Ryerson University (REB 2019-036) and University of Toronto
(RIS37623).  A  total  of  36  participants  were  recruited  by  2
community champions (trusted members of live-in caregivers’
community) and snowball technique. Eligible participants met
the study inclusion criteria: (1) self-identified as female aged
18 years or older, (2) residing in the Greater Toronto Area, (3)
working on a temporary work permit as a live-in caregiver, (4)
able to speak and read English, (5) had internet access, and (6)
able to take part in the 6-week intervention. They were randomly
divided into the intervention arm and wait list control arm using
a  random  number  generator.  Of  18  participants  in  the
intervention  group,  1  did  not  complete 
the  baseline
questionnaire, while 6 of 18 participants in the control group
withdrew from the study due to other competing life priorities.
The total number of participants who completed the pilot study
was 29, with 17 in the intervention group and 12 in the wait list
control group. The intervention group was further divided into
2 cohorts, 9 and 8 participants each, to enhance participation.
After those in the intervention group received the 6-week online
intervention, it was offered to the control group to respect the
ethical principle of beneficence (Figure 1). All participants were
compensated for their participation in the study and the cost of
internet use.

WE2CARE Intervention
The WE2CARE intervention consisted of 6 e-learning modules
that explained the ACT processes. Each week, participants were
interactive
invited 
experiential session on ACT strategies (approximately 1 hour
to complete) and attend a 1.5-hour online live videoconference.
The videoconference was designed to support participants in
applying ACT strategies in their everyday life and consisted of
a group discussion, peer sharing, and question and answers. The
videoconference  was  facilitated  by  2  of  our  research  team
members  with  extensive  knowledge  and  experience  in  ACT.
Prior to each videoconferencing, which took place on mutually
agreed weekdays in the evening, participants were given a week
to complete their assigned weekly module. Details of the study
protocol have been reported elsewhere [36].

Data Collection and Measures
Data were captured through self-report instruments administered
online  at  pre-,  post-,  and  6-week  postintervention.  The
preintervention  survey 
included  sociodemographic  and
health-related  questions  that  were  identified  as  important  in
previous research with temporary migrant workers [14,16]. The
standardized  scales  administered  at  pre-,  post-,  and  6-week
follow-up included: (1) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
(DASS-21)—a set of 3 self-report scales (21 items) designed
to measure the emotional states of depression (DASS-D), anxiety
(DASS-A) and stress (DASS-S); Cronbach alpha values of 0.81,
0.89 and 0.78 for the subscales of depressive, anxiety and stress
respectively;  (2)  Acceptance  and  Action  Questionnaire–2
(AAQ-2)—a  7-item  scale  designed  to  measure  the  impact  of
ACT core process conceptualized as psychological flexibility;
(3) Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R)—a
12-item measure designed to capture a broad conceptualization

of mindfulness not specific to any particular type of meditation
training;  and  the  (4)  Multi-System  Model  of  Resilience
(MSMR-I),  consisting  of  3  subscales:  internal  resilience
(MSMR-IR),  coping  pursuits  (MSMR-CP),  and  external
resilience (MSMR-ER). Each subscale contains 9 self-reported
items and indicates where the barriers to one’s resilience lie.
These  scales  have  shown  good  psychometric  properties
including internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity.
For  instance,  the  depressive,  anxiety,  and  stress  subscales  in
DASS have been have found to have excellent Cronbach alpha
values of .81, .89, and .78, respectively. AAQ-2 was reported
to have good internal consistency (α=.88) and good test retest
reliability over 3 and 12 months at .81 and .79, respectively.
CAMS-R was reported to have good Cronbach alpha (.67) and
good  convergent  validity  that  is  supported  by  its  negative
relationship to the DASS-21 is negatively correlated to DASS
(–.28).  MSMR-I  also  showed  excellent  internal  consistency
with Cronbach alpha of .90 and high test-retest reliability .84
[37-43].

Data Analyses
Descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize  participants’
sociodemographic and self-reported health characteristics. Fisher
exact tests were used to compare participant characteristics by
study arm allocation. Both independent and dependent t tests
were used to compare study outcomes pre, post, and 6-week
follow-up  across  and  within  both  arms  of  the  study.  Linear
mixed effects models were created for each outcome of interest
from baseline to postintervention among intervention and control
participants. Self-reported impact of the WE2CARE intervention
was examined using independent t tests across the study arms.
Data  were  entered  and  analyzed  using  the  SPSS  Statistics
(version  27,  IBM  Corp).  A  threshold  of  .05  was  used  to
determine the level of significance for all P values.

Results

Sociodemographic and Self-reported Health
Characteristics
Average  age  of  participants  was  38  years.  Many  participants
were  born  in  the  Philippines  (23/29,  79%)  and  have  lived  in
Canada for more than 24 months (17/29, 59%). Most participants
were married (12/29, 41%) and had children (18/29, 62%), but
none  of  their  children  were  in  Canada.  Most  had  college  or
university degree (19/29, 66%) and rated their English literacy
as being good (19/29, 66%). Nearly 90% (26/29) of participants

were temporary workers with a valid visa and work permit; 83%
(24/29)  worked  as  live-in  caregivers,  79%  (23/29)  worked
full-time, and 62% (18/29) worked 35 to 44 hours per week.
Among those who reported their income, 59% (13/22) earned
less  than  CAD  $24,999  (US  $19,441)  after  taxes.  Although
most (23/29, 79%) participants did not share their sleeping area
or bedroom with others, for those who did share, they shared
their sleeping area with, on average, 2 other people. Lack of
privacy was a common concern raised by participant who were
concerned about their accommodation.

A total of 7% (2/29) of participants rated their health at the time
of entry to Canada as poor or fair compared with other people
their age. However, this proportion was considerably increased
(8/29, 28%) after arrival to Canada. Regarding satisfaction with
life, 10% (3/29) were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied and 24%
(7/29) were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. The mean self-rated
level of stress was more than 50 on a scale of 0 to 100 (0 being
no stress and 100 being extremely stressful). About a fifth (6/29,
21%) of the participants rated their mental health as fair or poor
compared with other people of their own age. More than half
(15/29,  52%)  of  the  participants  were  dissatisfied  with  their
quality  of  sleep  and  reported  having  difficulty  falling  sleep,
staying  asleep,  or  getting  sufficient  hours  of  sleep.  Overall,
participants were relatively healthy before and after coming to
Canada  although  they  felt  their  overall  physical  and  mental
health were gradually deteriorating. Only a few people had been
diagnosed with high blood pressure, cancer, intestinal/stomach
problems, or depression since arriving in Canada.

More than 50% (17/29) of participants had been tested for HIV
(a required medical test for entry to Canada), and of those, 41%
(7/29) stated that their test was done sometime from 2018 to
2019. Interestingly, the rate of screening for sexually transmitted
infections appeared to be quite low among this population. Most
(20/29, 69%) participants stated that they have never been tested
for human papillomavirus, a common cause of cervical cancer,
or any other sexually transmitted infection (21/29, 72%).

Participants were asked about their use of health care services
since coming to Canada. A total of 28% (8/29) did not use health
care services while the rest did. A wide variety of reasons were
given; the most common reason (8/21, 38%) was annual checkup
followed by job requirement for flu vaccination (3/21, 14%).

There were no differences between the intervention and control
groups  on  demographic  variables  and  self-reported  health
characteristics as can be seen in Table 1.

aFisher exact test was used to compare count data. T-test was used to compare means.
b—: not applicable
cSTI: sexually transmitted infection.
dHPV: human papillomavirus.

Study Outcome Measures: DASS, AAQ-2, CAMS-R,
and MSMR-I
Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the mean score differences within
the intervention group before, after and at 6-week follow-up for
all  the  outcome  measures.  Table  4 shows  the  mean  score
differences between the intervention and control groups for all
the outcome measures. Tables 5 and 6 show the linear mixed
effects regression analyses using the pre- and postassessment
on the main outcomes across both groups.

The mean scores for DASS-D, DASS-A, and DASS-S decreased
steadily among the intervention arm post and 6-week follow-up:
40% drop in depression level, 23% drop in anxiety level, and
52%  drop  in  stress  level  (Figure  2).  However,  these  changes
were  not  significant  except  for  the  stress  level  after  6-week
follow-up (10.59 vs 5.06, t16=2.6, P=.02). Furthermore, overall
resiliency  (MSMR)  and  external  resiliency  (MSMR-ER),
particularly in the sphere of access to needed support (ie, MSMR
accessible support), significantly increased compared to baseline
(62.53 vs 65.35, t16=–3.33, P=.004; 19.65 vs 21.35, t16=–2.71,
P=.02; 6.71 vs 7.88, t16=–2.85, P=.01, respectively).

iMSMR_ER: Multi-System Model of Resilience–external resilience.

Looking across the 2 arms of the study, even though the mean
scores  for  DASS-D,  DASS-A,  and  DASS-S  decreased  more
among the intervention group than the control, these changes
were  not  significant.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  significant
differences in overall MSMR-I scores between intervention and
control participants. However, there were significant increases
postintervention in mindful qualities (CAMS-R) and external
resilience  (MSMR-ER),  particularly  in  life  satisfaction  and
accessible support among the intervention group (37.18 vs 32.92,
t22=2.35, P=.03; 20.29 vs 16.5, t21=2.98, P=.007; 8.47 vs 6.75,
t14=2.41, P=.03; 7.59 vs 5.33, t16=.008, respectively).

For the linear mixed effects models (Tables 5-6), the following
outcomes  saw  a  greater  amount  of  improvement  among
intervention participants than controls. Compared with control

Discussion

Principal Findings
Our  pilot  study  is  among  the  first  to  use  an  online  ACT
intervention to address psychological distress among temporary
migrant  live-in  caregivers.  Our  findings  suggest  that  this
intervention highly motivated participants to engage collectively
in building social support networks and to some extent improved
their mental health and resiliency.

The study participant sociodemographic characteristics and their
living and working conditions were comparable to earlier studies
[3,8,9,17,21]. Most reported working long hours and earning
close  to  or  below  the  Canadian  low-income  after-tax  cutoff
point. They were also concerned about the lack of privacy and
inability to have control over their living/working conditions.
About two-thirds reported being stressed and a fifth rated their
mental health as fair/poor since arrival to Canada. The result of
this  study  supports  the  healthy  immigrant  effect  (ie,  migrant
workers arrive healthy as indicated during predeparture medical
screening);  however,  their  health  status  declines  during  their
stay  in  Canada  [21,44-46].  Although  the  participants  in  our
study reported being healthy at the time of entry to Canada, a
requirement for receiving a temporary work permit in Canada,
they expressed a gradual decline in their physical and mental
health. It is also interesting that despite having access to Ontario
Health Insurance Plan, none of the participants had been tested
for  human  papillomavirus,  a  known  risk  factor  for  cervical
cancer.  This  highlights  that  the  health  of  temporary  female
migrant  workers  particularly  in  the  area  of  cervical  cancer
screening is ignored in our Canadian health care system and
corroborates earlier findings about cancer screening disparities
among vulnerable immigrant women [47-51].

This pilot waitlist-controlled trial found preliminary support for
psychosocial  improvements  for  the  treatment  group  in
comparison with the control group. A steady reduction in the
levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were noted among the
intervention group compared with control group even though
these  changes,  except  for  stress  level,  were  not  statistically
significant. The pattern of reduction is consistent with earlier
studies exploring the impact of ACT on psychological distress
among clinical and nonclinical population [27-29,52,53]. The
inability to show significance may either be due to the small
sample size or to the fact that our pilot study coincided with the
COVID-19 crisis, which caused more psychosocial distress for
our participants who were anxious about their own health and
their loved ones back home. They may also have experienced
COVID-19–related racism, which could have resulted in poorer
mental health. Furthermore, during 2019, the Caregiver Program
was  further  revised,  and  new  conditions  and  programs  were
introduced.  The  two  pilot  programs  that  the  Canadian
government  introduced  in  2014  to  replace  Live-in  Caregiver
Program, the Caring for Children and Caring for People With
High Medical Needs pilots, were replaced with two new pilots,
the Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker pilots.
Minimum language requirements and education credentials that
restricted  direct  eligibility  for  permanent  residency  stayed
unchanged. These changes caused further confusion, anger, and

stress for temporary migrant caregivers as they had to again be
reshuffled  in  the  list  of  those  waiting  for  their  permanent
residency. These conditions may have negatively impacted the
mental health of participants. However, despite these conditions,
the treatment group’s mental health still showed improvement
postintervention and at 6-week follow-up.

Our  pilot  data  also  showed  a  significant  worsening  of
mindfulness in the control group compared with the intervention
group. This indicates that our intervention promoted participant
uptake and use of mindfulness strategies. Considering this study
took place during COVID-19, which increased mental distress,
our data show that our intervention group may have benefited
from the use of mindfulness exercises and teaching provided
in our weekly modules compared with the control group, which
had no access to this intervention. Empirical evidence suggests
that mindfulness is associated with attention to and continuous
engagement with both positive and negative experiences rather
than  avoidance  of  internal  negative  experiences  [54,55].
Acceptance of one’s life experiences is a core ACT process that
allows people to accept negative thoughts and feelings without
being  characterized  by  them,  which  in  turn  promotes  their
self-esteem and resiliency.

and 

exercises 

attentional 

It is reported that ACT promotes psychological flexibility using
experiential 
(mindfulness),
clarifications  of  values,  and  committed  actions  directed  by
values  [22].  Our  study  found  an  increase  in  psychological
flexibility among the control compared with the intervention
group. This is because the participants’ mean score was higher
in the control group compared with the intervention group prior
to  start  of  the  intervention  (23.75  vs  18.65)  and  dropped
postintervention  (18  vs  17.94),  In  other  words,  there  was  a
bigger drop in mean scores in the control group because they
were less flexible at the start of the study. This may be due to
selection bias, as we used nonprobability sampling strategies
to recruit our sample, as well as our small sample size. Future
study with a larger sample size is needed to examine the impact
of ACT on psychological flexibility through online delivery.

and 

accessible 

Furthermore,  we  found  a  significant  increase  in  external
resiliency among participants in the intervention group compared
with the control group specifically across the dimensions of life
satisfaction 
support.  Our  weekly
videoconferencing provided an opportunity for our participants
to connect with their peers and engage collectively in building
social  support  networks.  The  weekly  videoconferencing
provided  a  vehicle  to  facilitate  the  building  of  a  virtual
community of mutual support that continued beyond the project.
Some of the participants continued connecting through social
media like WhatsApp.

The  results  from  the  evaluation  survey  component  where
participants  were  asked  to  comment  on  the  utility  of  the
intervention further support the positive influence WE2CARE
had on participants. Compared with the control group, those in
the intervention group self-reported an increase in knowledge
about  stigma,  gained  more  peer  support,  and  participated  in
more  community  activities  that  supported  their  health  and
well-being. This demonstrates how ACT equipped participants
with  the  ability  to  expand  their  social  network  that  supports

feasibility, 

implementation 

Our  study  offers  numerous  implications  for  practice:  (1)
evidence-informed online interventions enhance participation
access  and 
(2)  web-based
interventions can be effective in promoting mental health, (3)
the  combined  use  of  individual  self-directed  e-learning  and
group  videoconferencing  allows  peer  connection  and  reduce
social isolation, and (4) online group videoconferencing offers
opportunities for marginalized groups, like temporary foreign
workers,  to  get  connected  and  engage  in  social  action  to
challenge existing exploitative policies and practices to achieve
equity.

Limitations
There  are  some  limitations  to  this  study  that  should  be
considered when reviewing the results. First, the small sample
size  limits  our  ability  to  generalize  findings  to  the  larger
community of migrant live-in caregivers. However, the goal of
this study is not to generalize to the larger community of migrant
live-in  caregivers  but  rather  to  explore  the  feasibility  of  an
internet-based psychological intervention in promoting caregiver
mental  well-being.  Furthermore,  due  to  the  nature  of  a  pilot
study, having a small sample size is acceptable considering the
paucity of information surrounding not only the use of ACT in
reducing psychological distress but also internet delivery of the
intervention for migrant live-in caregivers. Second, the study
relied on self-report measurements that are prone to biases in
this type of assessment (eg, social desirability, environmental

biases  like  fatigue  or  privacy).  A  combination  of  self-report
measures  with  physiological  measures  may  deliver  further
insight. However, the unique living and working conditions of
our target population (eg, long working hours, limited free time,
fear  of  deportation  due  to  health  issues)  in  addition  to
COVID-19 public health restrictions made the use of self-report
measures a viable option. Third, considering Caregiver Program
reforms in November 2014, some migrant caregivers may be
living outside their employers’ home. Except for 2 participants
in our study, the rest lived with their employers. Hence, it would
be important for future studies to explore the efficacy of ACT
in  reducing  psychological  distress  among  those  migrant
caregivers who live outside their place of employment.

Conclusion
WE2CARE  is  among  the  first  studies  to  explore  the
effectiveness  of  ACT  in  addressing  mental  health  challenges
among  temporary  migrant  live-in  caregivers.  Our  pilot  data
provided preliminary results on the efficacy of ACT in reducing
mental health distress and promoting self-care. The results help
to  inform  the  development  of  culturally  safe  web-based
individual
interactive  programs 
psychological support among socially isolated and marginalized
groups, promote the establishment of peer social networks and
supportive environments, and promote collective engagement
toward  advancing  social  change.  A  large-scale  study  is
warranted  to  confirm  the  preliminary  results  obtained  in  this
study. There is a great potential for adapting WE2CARE for
use with other temporary foreign workers like seasonal migrant
farm  workers  across  Ontario,  other  Canadian  provinces,  and
internationally.
