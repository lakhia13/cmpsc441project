Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and eating disorders: 
an overlooked comorbidity?

Trastorno por déficit de atención e hiperactividad y trastorno alimentario: 
¿una comorbilidad pasada por alto?

C.A. Soutullo Esperón1, T.T. Babatope2

Dear Editor,

A recent cross-sectional study carried out at an 
outpatient  Eating  Disorders  program  in  San  Se-
bastian (Guipúzcoa, Spain), consisting of 108 adult 
patients  diagnosed  with  Eating  Disorders  (ED), 
found a disproportionately elevated rate of Atten-
tion Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagno-
sis when using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale 
(ASRS-v1.1)1.  Ruiz  Feliu  from  the  Donostia-Am-
ara  Mental  Health  Center,  in  collaboration  with 
colleagues  from  the  University  of  Navarra  Clinic, 
Hospital  Universitario  Donostia  and  Ansoain  Men-
tal  Health  Center,  discovered  high  ASRS  scores 
in 42.6% of the patients1, which is a rate about 17 
times higher than the expected rate of ADHD diag-
nosis in the general adult population (2.5%)2. They 
also observed a higher correlation of ADHD and ED 
in binge-purge types of eating disorder, those most 
commonly associated with greater impulsivity. 

ADHD  is  the  most  commonly  diagnosed  neu-
rodevelopmental  disorder  in  childhood,  with  a 
prevalence of 5.9% in childhood and 2.2% in adults, 
with  no  significant  differences  in  prevalence  be-
tween North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South 
America, and Oceania2.

Several  large  epidemiologic  studies  show  that 
ADHD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disor-
ders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, autism 
spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, opposition-
al defiant disorder, conduct disorder, eating disor-
ders, and substance use disorders2.

When disorder A and disorder B co-occur more 
frequently than expected by chance, scientists can 
consider or propose several hypotheses3,4: 

a)  Common etiological mechanism, of either a 
common  genetic  vulnerability  or  common 
environmental  factors  between  the  two  dis-
orders.

b)  Disorder A is a risk factor for disorder B, ei-
ther  because  some  symptoms  of  disorder  A 
can produce disorder B (decreased sleep can 
produce fatigue and poor concentration), or 
because disorder A, if untreated, is a risk fac-
tor for disorder B (as diabetes and retinopa-
thy or, as we found in a recent meta-analysis, 
ADHD  was  associated  with  elevated  risk  of 
unintentional injuries and accidental poison-
ing5). 

  Another  possibility  is  that  the  treatment  of 
disorder A may produce symptoms of disor-
der B. This may be the case in treatment of

ADHD with stimulants, which can occasion-
ally induce mood swings, mania and bipolar 
disorder4. That  could  explain  some  cases  of 
extreme  decreased  appetite  (and  weight)  in 
children with ADHD treated with stimulants 
that can resemble anorexia nervosa, but that 
does not seem to be the case in the paper we 
are commenting on1.

c)  Symptom overlap may generate the diagnosis 
of both disorders (probably not the case in ED 
and ADHD).

So,  what  is  the  evidence  of  the  association  of 

ADHD and ED?

The recent World Federation of ADHD Consen-
sus  statement2  only  mentions  that  obesity,  if  you 
consider  it  an  ED,  is  elevated  in  children  with 
ADHD. They cite three studies: 

1)  A Swedish national register study of >2.5 mil-
lion people found ADHD patients had a three-
fold  greater  risk  of  obesity  relative  to  their 
non-ADHD siblings and cousins. It also found 
a familial co-aggregation of ADHD and clinical 
obesity, the strength of which varied directly 
with the degree of genetic relatedness6. 

2)  A  meta-analysis  observed  that,  when  com-
pared  with  typically  developing  subjects 
children and adolescents with unmedicated 
ADHD were about 20% more likely to be over-
weight  or  obese  (fifteen  studies,  >400,000 
participants),  and  adults  with  unmedicat-
ed  ADHD  were  almost  50%  more  likely  to 
be  overweight  or  obese  (nine  studies,  over 
>45,000 participants)7. 

3)  A  meta-analysis  of  twelve  studies  (>180,000 
participants) found that people with unmed-
icated ADHD were about 40% more likely to 
be obese, whereas those who were medicated 
were indistinguishable from typically devel-
oping subjects8.

We also found recent meta-analysis on the bidi-

rectional association of ADHD and ED:

1)  A  2016  meta-analyisis9  of  twelve  studies 
investigating  ED  in  patients  with  ADHD 
(ADHD = 4,013; controls = 29,404), and five ex-
ploring ADHD in patients with ED (ED = 1,044; 
controls = 11,292). 

  The pooled odds ratio (OR) of diagnosing any 
ED in patients with ADHD was significantly 
increased  (OR = 3.82;  95%  CI:  2.34-6.24).  A 
similar level of risk was found across all ED 

syndromes (anorexia nervosa (AN): OR = 4.28; 
95%CI:  2.24-8.16);  bulimia  nervosa  (BN): 
OR = 5.71; 95% CI: 3.56-9.16; and binge eating 
disorder (BED): OR = 4.13; 95%CI: 3-5.67). The 
prevalence of ED in patients with ADHD was 
1% in those with AN, 9-11% in  BN and 9.3-
11.4% in BED.

  The pooled OR of ADHD in patients with ED 
was  significantly  increased  (OR = 2.57;  95% 
CI:  1.30-5.11),  being  higher  in  cohorts  with 
binge eating disorder (OR = 5.77; 95% CI: 2.35-
14.18). 

  The prevalence of ADHD in patients with ED 
was 3-16.2% in those with AN, 9-34.9% in BN, 
and 19.8% in BED. 

  The number of ADHD symptoms correlated 
with ED symptom severity in all binge/purge 
ED  subtypes.  ADHD  symptoms  were  found 
to predict binge eating severity and bulimic 
symptoms even after controlling for anxiety 
and depression9. 

2) A systematic review10 found 26 studies out of 
37 that supported evidence of association be-
tween  ADHD  and  ED  or  disordered  eating. 
Children  with  ADHD  were  at  risk  for  disor-
dered  eating,  while  adolescents,  emerging 
adults,  and  adults  were  at  risk  for  both  ED 
and  disordered  eating.  Similar  findings  to 
those presented in another review of 75 stud-
ies that found moderate strength of evidence 
for a positive association between ADHD and 
disordered eating and with specific types of 
disordered-eating  behavior,  in  particular, 
overeating behaviour11.

3)  Another recent literature review found prev-
alence of ADHD in patients with ED ranging 
1.6-18%; again, more in binge-purge AN and 
in BN, than in AN restrictive12. 

To summarize, there is an elevated risk of ADHD 
in  patients  with  ED  (pooled  OR = 2.57),  higher  in 
patients  with  binge  eating  disorder  (OR = 5.77)9. 
The  rates  of  ADHD  diagnosis  in  patients  with  AN 
are 3-16.2%9, in BN 9-34.9%9, and in BED patients 
19.18%12.

Most  studies  indicate  higher  rates  of  ADHD  in 
patients with AN binge-purge type12, BN12 or BED9.
There  is  also  increased  risk  of  ED  in  patients 
with ADHD, with pooled OR of 3.829, and elevated 
rates of obesity in children, adolescents and adults 
with ADHD2,6-8

C.A. Soutullo Esperón and  T.T. BabatopeATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AND EATING DISORDERS: AN OVERLOOKED COMORBIDITY?Although  the  mechanism  of  this  bidirectional 
overlap needs to be further studied, at this state we 
can consider at least four hypotheses:

1)  The dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex ex-
ecutive function in ADHD, coupled with lim-
bic dysfunction in reward circuits are impli-
cated in the delay of reward and impulsivity. 
This could explain the higher rates of ED in 
patients with ADHD. 

2)  It is possible that a disordered eating pattern 
and neuroendocrine deficiencies in metabo-
lism and nutrition, secondary to severe and 
prolonged ED, may have a negative effect on 
attentional circuits in the brain, thus causing 
ADHD symptoms or the full-blown disorder. 
However,  if  this  was  true,  ADHD  would  be 
more frequent in restrictive AN, but it seems 
to be more frequent in patients with BED, BN 
and binge-purge AN. This suggests an under-
lying mechanism possibly based on impulse 
control,  delayed  aversion,  and  reward  pro-
cessing,  rather  than  on  poor  nutrition  that 
may cause inattention.

3)  Mediating  and  moderating  factors  may  in-
crease  the  risk  of  one  disorder  in  the  pres-
ence of the other. 

4)  Other  possibilities  include  deeper  mecha-
nisms  of  mood,  self-esteem/self-image  and 
appetite regulation that may underlie ED and 
ADHD, and may be playing an important role 
in this case.

Finally, the study by Ruiz Feliu et al1 is highly rel-
evant and is an example of an integrative approach 
across different levels and systems (academic and 
clinical  activity,  public  and  private  centers,  locat-
ed  in  two  different  autonomous  communities  in 
Spain). Thus, more collaborative research is need-
ed to benefit patients.
