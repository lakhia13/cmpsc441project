The promise and pitfalls of the internet for
cognitive behavioral therapy
Gerhard Andersson1,2

Abstract

Internet-administered cognitive behavior therapy is a promising new way to deliver psychological treatment. There
are an increasing number of controlled trials in various fields such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders and health
conditions such as headache and insomnia. Among the advantages for the field of cognitive behavior therapy is
the dissemination of the treatment, being able to access treatment from a distance, and possibilities to tailor the
interventions. To date, studies in which large effects have been obtained have included patient support from a
clinician. Recent trials suggest that this support may come from non-clinicians and that therapist effects are mini-
mal. Since studies also suggest that internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy can be equally effective as face-
to-face cognitive behavior therapy, this is a finding that may have implications for CBT practitioners. However,
there are other aspects to consider for implementation, as while clinicians may hold positive attitudes towards
internet-delivered CBT a recent study suggested that patients are more skeptical and may prefer face-to-face treat-
ment. In the present work, I argue that internet-delivered CBT may help to increase adherence to treatment proto-
cols, that training can be facilitated by means of internet support, and that research on internet interventions can
lead to new insights regarding what happens in regular CBT. Moreover, I conclude that internet-delivered CBT
works best when support is provided, leaving an important role for clinicians who can incorporate internet treat-
ment in their services. However, I also warn against disseminating internet-delivered CBT to patients for whom it is
not suitable, and that clinical skills may suffer if clinicians are trained and practice mainly using the internet.

Introduction
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an established psy-
chological treatment approach [1] that is regarded as
evidence based for several health conditions such as
anxiety disorders [2], major depression [3], and health
problems such as insomnia [4], headache [5], and tinni-
tus [6]. Briefly, CBT is a treatment approach that
encompasses assessment strategies, cognitive and beha-
vioral treatment techniques, a collaboration between the
patient and the clinician, and use of homework assign-
ments [7]. In addition, there are numerous other techni-
ques that are specific for conditions, such as exposure in
the treatment of anxiety disorders [8]. While most CBT
studies have used the individual treatment format there
is plenty of evidence to suggest that CBT works well in
the group format [9], and as guided self-help [10]. The
most recent development in the field of guided self-help

is the use of the internet to deliver this treatment [11],
and this paper comments on the potentials and pitfalls
of this development.

There has been a rapid expansion of outcome studies
on internet-delivered CBT in the fields of psychiatry
[12-14] and behavioral medicine [15], and there are an
increasing number of studies showing that internet-
delivered CBT can be equally effective as face-to-face
CBT in conditions such as panic disorder [16], depres-
sive symptoms [17], tinnitus [18], with studies on other
conditions forthcoming.

This paper will highlight the impact the internet has
had on CBT, its potentials and limitations, and projec-
tions into the future on how internet-delivered CBT will
influence the dissemination and development of CBT.
Understanding the pros and cons of internet-delivered
CBT is important as it may increase access to CBT and
hence reach more patients at a lower cost. However,
while resources may be saved there is still a need for
clinicians to guide the treatment if effects similar to
face-to-face CBT are to be obtained.

Discussion
While there are several studies on the effects of internet-
delivered CBT, less is known about the realities of its
implementation: that is, dissemination, acceptability and
interest in internet treatments. Regarding dissemination
there are several unguided open access programs available,
but without the input from a clinician or other guiding
person they tend to work less well than guided programs
[12,14]. Open access programs without validated diagnos-
tic procedures and guidance will probably not compete
with face-to-face CBT in terms of efficacy, but can lead to
increased interest in regular CBT after the internet treat-
ment has been completed [19]. Unguided open access
programs are also easily disseminated. Regarding dissemi-
nation in regular health care, there are now studies show-
ing that
internet-based treatment works under
representative clinical conditions [20]. Acceptability and
interest in internet-based CBT are constantly changing
and may also differ between countries. Mohr et al.
reported a study on 658 primary care patients in the US
who were asked about their interest in different treatment
formats [21]. Results showed that 91% would consider
face-to-face treatment and only 48% internet treatment.
Interests among clinicians may be greater, with one study
showing that only a small minority felt that internet treat-
ment is unacceptable as a treatment format [22].

Impact on the field
Internet-delivered CBT has already and will continue to
have a profound effect on CBT. The internet makes
information about CBT more available [23], but the
effective use of the internet to deliver CBT also raises
questions for the CBT field. Training of therapists is
regarded as important in CBT [24], but the evidence to
date clearly suggests that therapist effects (in other
words, does it matter who gives the support?) are mini-
mal in internet-delivered CBT [25]. In a series of studies,
Titov and colleagues have found that support adminis-
tered from a technician can be equivalent to the support
provided by a psychologist [26,27]. Indeed, this could be
because in internet treatment the therapy is mainly pre-
sented via text and the computer program (which can
include audio files, films, stories and so on), and hence
the supportive role of the therapist in most cases will
require less skills than in face-to-face therapies.

In CBT there has been a debate regarding the impor-
tance of tailoring treatment following a case conceptua-
lization as opposed to using treatment manuals
developed for specific diagnoses [28]. A recent develop-
ment of internet-delivered CBT has been the use of tai-
loring, which makes internet treatment more suitable
for comorbid conditions (such as the overlap between
anxiety and depression), and also sensitive to patient
preferences [29,30]. This is an example of how internet-

delivered CBT may have an impact on regular manua-
lized CBT, as there may be difficulties in moving
between treatment manuals that are written for specific
conditions in face-to-face therapies with patients who
have comorbid conditions. One proposed solution has
been to focus on the common transdiagnostic elements
of CBT [31], and this has also been found to be effective
when delivered via the internet [32]. The primary lesson
for CBT could therefore be that computer support can
increase therapist adherence to treatment protocols,
increase the number of practitioners who can use CBT,
and decrease therapist drift from manualized treatments
[33]. Indeed a recent trial showed that that computer-
ized support including web-based outcomes monitoring
was a feasible approach to treat anxiety in primary care
[34].

Positive elements of increased access via the internet
There are several positive consequences of delivering
CBT via the internet. The most obvious one is that it
can be used to overcome distances. Many patients with
anxiety and depression never get access to a trained
CBT therapist, and the internet makes treatment more
available for people who cannot travel to specialist
clinics. Second, while internet treatment can be pre-
sented in real time [35], most treatment applications
will not require that the work is performed at a particu-
lar time, and this is an advantage for both patients and
clinicians. Clinicians may consult colleagues before
responding to a question from a patient. Patients may
work when it best suits them, and the therapy will not
require the patients to take time from work to visit the
therapist’s office. Indeed, this resembles how internet
banking has made it easier for many people who can
access their bank affairs from home, and it is possible
that patients in face-to-face CBT will gradually start ask-
ing for online support and material on the web when
they are in treatment. However, internet treatment is
still mainly a complement even if it can be a replace-
ment. There will always be patients who will need face-
to-face treatment or for whom internet treatment will
complement other treatments such as pharmacotherapy
or indeed face-to-face or group CBT. In addition, com-
pliance with treatment may decrease when the treat-
ment is provided from a distance, and in particular if
very little support is given [14], which for some patients
makes internet treatment less suitable.

What has the spread of the internet added or removed
from the field of CBT?
Since the treatment versus demand gap is large when it
comes to most conditions for which CBT has been
found to work [36], the development of internet-deliv-
ered CBT and the internet in general has probably

Andersson BMC Medicine 2010, 8:82

Page 3 of 5

helped to increase awareness of CBT to the general pub-
lic, for example on the websites of mental health chari-
ties. Most likely internet treatment studies will gradually
increase in number and there is now a tendency that
novel treatment methods are tested in internet trials
soon after that they have been developed [37], and that
new treatment therapies will even be developed directly
for use with the internet. These developments will also
involve smart phones with special applications. While
internet studies can be preceded by open smaller face-
to-face or group trials [38], it will be more feasible to do
the controlled investigations on the internet [37]. One
additional aspect that the internet has added to the CBT
field is the use of online questionnaires, and research
has consistently shown that this administration format
is feasible and works as well as paper and pencil ques-
tionnaires [39]. There are some potential risks with the
dissemination of internet treatments. It could be argued
that the clinical skills derived from actual practice with
patients will deteriorate or even not develop if clinicians
start doing most of their work via the internet. Another
risk would be if internet treatments would dominate to
the extent that regular clinical services would not be
funded. As we have reasons to believe that face-to-face
diagnostic interviews and examinations will be needed
for many conditions (for example, diagnosis of major
depression), the internet is not capable of replacing all
aspects of good clinical management. A third risk is that
internet treatments will be disseminated to the wrong
patients who will experience treatment failure and then
falsely conclude that CBT did not work for them. How-
ever, the opposing risk would be if internet treatments
were not disseminated at all apart from a few specialist
settings [20].

Finally, a projection into the future is that internet-
delivered CBT will become integrated with other ser-
vices in a clinician’s toolbox. There may be room for
large-scale open access programs, in particular intelli-
gent systems which may be able to mimic what the
online therapist is doing and thereby secure that effects
are obtained [40]. Studies on guided self-help including
internet studies may also reveal that previously less well
known factors may be important for treatment adher-
ence, such as the importance of having a deadline for
completing treatment following which an interview is
made [41].

Conclusions
The internet has had a major impact for the field of
CBT. First, information on the internet about CBT
makes this treatment option better known. Second, the
use of the internet for delivering CBT has been found to
be effective in several randomized controlled trials [11].
Indeed, in line with the rapid spread of the internet at

large, controlled trials on internet-delivered CBT have
been conducted remarkably fast and it is telling that in
some fields, such as treatment of anxiety disorders, that
there are now more controlled studies on internet-deliv-
ered CBT than there are on the much older psychody-
namic treatments for anxiety disorders [42]. Third,
internet-delivered CBT raises questions of relevance for
face-to-face CBT. Recent studies on internet-delivered
CBT have found that the tailoring of treatment ingredi-
ents can be combined with a manualized approach. The
role of the therapist providing support is less important
in internet-delivered CBT and challenges the thinking
regarding dissemination of CBT including training clini-
cians in CBT. Patient preferences for internet treatment
will likely change in the very near future, although at
present there are still a significant proportion who pre-
fer the traditional face-to-face format [21].

Internet-delivered CBT may be used to increase
adherence to treatment protocols and manuals. This
will prevent ‘therapist drift’ away from structured treat-
ments, and will also facilitate dissemination of CBT to
other professionals than trained psychotherapists. In
light of these observations, CBT professionals will
probably benefit from using the internet in their clini-
cal work, as one channel for communication and for
improving the structure of information. Treatment
standards will be needed in the future, as it can be
hard for clinicians to discern what programs and
approaches they should use. There is also a need to
define standards for training clinicians using the inter-
net in their work. Other potential challenges include
the need to maintain clinical skills derived from face-
to-face clinical practice, to secure reliable diagnostic
procedures if clinical interviews are not feasible, and to
find appropriate models for service delivery for inter-
net-delivered CBT.

Practitioners and developers of internet-based CBT
programs should consider the importance of proper
patient diagnoses, evaluation of suitability and user
friendliness of the internet system. Most treatments
tested in research have been largely text based, but use
of audio files and illustrative movies, web lectures and
interactive features may help to make the treatment
more accessible for persons who prefer other formats
than pure text. As the internet and information technol-
ogy change rapidly use of smart phones and their inte-
gration with the internet should now be considered
when developing new systems and updating older
programs.
