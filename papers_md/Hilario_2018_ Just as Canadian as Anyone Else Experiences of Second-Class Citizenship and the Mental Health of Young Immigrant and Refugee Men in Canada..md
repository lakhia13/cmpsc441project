Abstract
In  recent  years,  the  experiences  of  immigrant  and  refugee  young  men  have  drawn  attention  worldwide.  Human-
induced environmental disasters, local and global conflicts, and increasingly inequitable distributions of wealth have 
shaped transnational migration patterns. Canada is home to a large immigrant and refugee population, particularly in its 
urban areas, and supporting the mental health and well-being of these communities is of critical importance. The aim 
of this article is to report findings from a qualitative study on the social context of mental health among immigrant and 
refugee young men, with a focus on their migration and resettlement experiences. Informed by the conceptual lens of 
social context, a thematic narrative analysis approach was used to examine qualitative data from individual and group 
interviews with 33 young men (age 15 to 22 years) self-identified as immigrants or refugees and were living in Greater 
Vancouver, western Canada. Three thematic narratives were identified: a better life, living the (immigrant) dream, 
and starting again from way below. The narratives characterized the social context for immigrant and refugee young 
men and were connected by a central theme of negotiating second-class citizenship. Implications include the need for 
mental health frameworks that address marginalization and take into account the contexts and discourses that shape 
the mental health of immigrant and refugee populations in Canada and worldwide.

In recent years, the experiences of immigrant and refugee 
young  men  have  drawn  attention  worldwide.  Human-
induced  environmental  disasters,  local  and  global  con-
flicts, and increasingly inequitable distributions of wealth 
have shaped transnational migration patterns that require 
innovative  solutions  to  addressing  the  health  of  immi-
grant  and  refugee  populations.  With  an  estimated  214 
million migrants worldwide (World Health Organization, 
2016) and nearly 60 million refugees displaced from their 
homes  due  to  conflict  in  2014  (United  Nations  High 
Commissioner  for  Refugees,  2016),  the  world  has  been 
witnessing,  in  the  words  of  the  Director-General  of  the 
World Health Organization (WHO), “the largest popula-
tion  displacements  seen  since  the  end  of  the  Second 
World War” (2015).

Mental health promotion has been identified as a key 
priority in supporting immigrant and refugee populations. 
According  to  the  WHO,  mental  health  is  “a  state  of

well-being in which every individual realises his or her 
own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, 
can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make 
a  contribution  to  her  or  his  community”  (2014a).  This 
definition recognizes that mental health is more than the 
absence of mental illness; rather it is “fundamental to our 
collective  and  individual  ability  as  humans  to  think, 
emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy 
life” (World Health Organization, 2014a).

The aim of this article is to report findings from a qual-
itative study on the social context of mental health among 
immigrant  and  refugee  young  men  in  Canada,  with  a 
focus  on  their  migration  and  resettlement  experiences. 
Canada is home to a large immigrant and refugee popula-
tion, particularly in its urban areas. In 2011, people born 
outside  of  Canada  represented  over  20  percent  of  the 
population,  the  largest  proportion  among  the  G8  coun-
tries (Statistics Canada, 2013a). The growing population 
of  immigrant  and  refugee  groups  in  Canada  raises  a 
unique  set  of  considerations  with  regards  to  designing 
and implementing effective mental health initiatives and 
conducting  research  to  inform  programs  and  services 
(Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2012).

Frameworks for Immigrant and Refugee Health

Increasingly, there has been a call for a broader analysis of 
immigration that takes into account the social and institu-
tional contexts in which people resettle (Castañeda et al., 
2015). Most of the research with immigrant young people 
has  tended  to  concentrate  on  familial  or  cultural  values, 
intergenerational  conflicts,  and  acculturation  (Salehi, 
2010). In general, there has been an emphasis on individ-
ual  and  family-level  factors  and  less  attention  to  social 
structures and relations (Hilario, Oliffe, Wong, Browne, & 
Johnson,  2015). The  reliance  on  cultural  and  behavioral 
frameworks,  in  which  culture  is  narrowly  defined  and 
individual health behaviors are the primary unit of analy-
sis, has led to studies that “revert back to an apolitical and 
ahistorical understanding of differences between popula-
tions that eschews social inequalities and social determi-
nants of health” (Castañeda et al., 2015, p. 380).

Researchers  have  recommended  in-depth  analysis  of 
how structural factors related to inequalities shape immi-
grant  health  outcomes  (Viruell-Fuentes,  Miranda,  & 
Abdulrahim,  2012).  For  example,  empirical  evidence 
suggests that social support and stable resettlement have 
protective effects on the mental health of young people 
(Fazel,  Reed,  Panter-Brick,  &  Stein,  2012).  Similarly, 
research in Canada has shown linkages between support-
ive environments and the health and well-being of refu-
gee youth (Edge, Newbold, & McKeary, 2014). However, 
virtually no studies have focused on mental health from 
the perspectives of immigrant and refugee young men in 
Canada.

Mental Health of Immigrant and Refugee 
Young Men

Canada is home to a large immigrant and refugee popula-
tion, particularly in its urban areas. In 2011, people born 
outside  of  Canada  represented  over  20  percent  of  the 
population,  the  largest  proportion  among  the  G8  coun-
tries (Statistics Canada, 2013a). In recent years, the top 
three  source  countries  for  permanent  immigration  in 
Canada  have  been  China,  India,  and  the  Philippines 
(Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 2016).

Research  has  shown  that  first-generation  immigrant 
youth in Canada experience higher psychological distress 
compared to second- or third-generation immigrant youth 
(Hamilton, Noh, & Adlaf, 2009). Similarly, a study using 
population-based survey data found that Southeast Asian 
youth who have been in Canada for 5 years or less were 
more  likely  to  report  emotional  distress  (Hilario  et  al., 
2014). Furthermore, research in Australia suggests higher 
odds of depression among immigrant men from non-Eng-
lish speaking backgrounds compared to their Australian-
born counterparts (Straiton, Grant, Winefield, & Taylor, 
2014).

Researchers in the field of men’s health have noted the 
need to examine the intersection of gender and diversity 
in seeking help (Galdas, Cheater, & Marshall, 2005). For 
example, immigrant men in Canada have been found to 
under-utilize  health  services  for  psychological  distress 
(Kirmayer  et  al.,  2007).  Research  has  also  found  that 
mental  health  services  for  immigrant  youth  in  Canada 
have been sidelined and grounded in charity-based rather 
than  rights-based  frameworks  (Ngo,  2009).  Barriers  to 
accessing  services  for  newcomers  include  limited  lan-
guage proficiency, lack of  cultural safety, difficulties in 
navigating  the  system,  fear  of  accessing  services,  and 
being  seen  as  a  burden  on  the  system  (Gagnon,  2002). 
The literature points to a gap in effective, relevant, and 
accessible  mental  health-promoting  services  and  pro-
grams for immigrant young men.

To the authors’ knowledge, the empirical research on 
men and mental health has yet to focus on the perspec-
tives  of  immigrant  and  refugee  young  men.  In  Canada, 
there  is  scant  information  about  this  group  (Edge  & 
Newbold,  2013). Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  article  is  to 
report findings from a qualitative study on the social con-
text  of  mental  health  among  immigrant  and  refugee 
young men, with a focus on their migration and resettle-
ment experiences.

Methods

The  conceptual  lens  of  social  context  guided  the  study. 
Social context refers to relations “comprising social struc-
tures such as class, race, and gender; institutional practices, 
and  collective  and  individual  behaviour,  and  intersecting 

212

personal biographies” (Poland et al., 2006, p. 60). Within 
this  lens,  mental  health  is  shaped  by  the  confluence  of 
social structures, institutional practices, and personal biog-
raphies (Frohlich, Poland, & Sareck, 2012). The concept of 
social context provided an analytical entry point for exam-
ining the ways in which the narratives of immigrant and 
refugee young men, pertaining to their day-to-day experi-
ences, were situated within personal biographies, practices, 
and social structures linked to power and privilege within 
specific socio-historical contexts.

Recruitment

The study was conducted in Greater Vancouver, a metro-
politan  region  located  in  western  Canada.  Following 
approval  from  the  University  of  British  Columbia 
Behavioural Research Ethics Board, recruitment and data 
collection  were  conducted  between  October  2014  and 
October  2015.  Recruitment  strategies  were  diverse  to 
ensure the inclusion of young men who were or were not 
connected  to  services.  Flyers  were  distributed  at  youth 
and  community  centers,  libraries,  and  on  websites.  A 
project  advisory  group  assisted  with  posting  notices  in 
addition  to  word-of-mouth  recruitment  by  a  team  of 
youth  research  collaborators  who  were  also  immigrant 
and  refugee  young  men.  Those  who  were  interested  in 
participating  were  instructed  to  contact  the  lead  author 
via email, phone, or text message.

Participants

Thirty-three  young  men,  who  identified  as  having  immi-
grant or refugee backgrounds, participated in the study. They 
ranged in age from 15 to 22 years old. The primary activities 
of the participants included attending secondary school (n = 
21), alternative school (n = 1), attending college or univer-
sity (n = 9), working full-time (n = 1), and being unemployed 
(n = 1). The participants originated from 18 countries and 
comprised a heterogeneous group, including those who had 
immigrated through family reunification programs, govern-
ment-assisted refugees, refugee claimants, and international 
students temporarily residing in Canada.

Several young men (n = 4) identified as second-gener-
ation  immigrants  born  in  Canada  to  families  who  had 
immigrated. Length of residence among those born out-
side of Canada ranged from less than 1 year to approxi-
mately 14 years (average = 7 years). The majority of the 
young  men  were  perceived  by  the  interviewer  and  lead 
author  as  visible  minorities  with  the  exception  of  three 
participants (two young men from South Africa and one 
young man from the former Yugoslavia). In Canada, the 
category  of  visible  minority  refers  to  “persons  who  are 
non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour and who do 
not  report  being  Aboriginal,”  as  defined  by  Canada’s

Data Collection

Recruitment, data collection, and analysis were led by the 
lead author who identifies as a cisgender visible minority 
Filipina woman who immigrated to Canada as a child and 
racialized settler through the family reunification scheme 
and  was  in  her  20s  at  the  time  of  data  collection.  The 
coauthors  include  four  people  who  identify  as  an 
Australian  immigrant  to  Canada;  a  visible  minority 
Chinese woman born in the British colony of Hong Kong 
and immigrated with family to Canada at age 16; a Euro-
Canadian  woman;  and  a  white,  Canadian-born,  lesbian 
woman. All authors have established strong track records 
of  conducting  research  with  marginalized  communities 
with the goal of promoting health equity.

Data  were  collected  through  individual  and  group 
interviews.  The  lead  author  conducted  all  of  the  inter-
views.  Participants  were  informed  of  the  study  proce-
dures, and they provided written consent prior to taking 
part  in  the  interview.  All  participants  were  offered  the 
option of an individual or group interview. As part of the 
process,  participants  were  able  to  select  the  interview 
location. The  interviews  were  conversationally  oriented 
and the interview guide included broad questions such as, 
“What is a typical day like for you?” and “Can you tell 
me about a difficult time in your life?”

Interviews  were  digitally  recorded  and  transcribed 
verbatim.  The  interviews  ranged  from  30  to  90  min  in

length  and  were  conducted  in  various  locations  as  per 
participants’ preference: community and recreation cen-
ters, libraries, public parks, malls, and cafes. Debriefing 
between the interviewer and interviewee took place fol-
lowing each interview to allow for additional thoughts or 
questions from participants. This step was documented in 
field  notes  but  not  recorded  as  part  of  the  interview. 
Participants were provided with copies of the study con-
sent  forms,  a  letter  of  information  for  their  parent(s)  or 
guardian(s), and a list of relevant mental health resources. 
A $20 CAD honorarium for each interview was offered to 
participants  to  acknowledge  their  time  and  contribution 
to the study.

Data Analysis

The  software  program,  NVivo10,  was  used  to  organize 
and  re-aggregate  transcribed  interview  data  with  broad 
codes that were inductively derived from repeated read-
ings  of  the  transcribed  interviews.  Thematic  narrative 
analysis was used to examine the coded data (Riessman, 
2008). Data were examined not as exact representations 
but rather to elicit the young men’s interpretations of their 
experiences and their social worlds. The focus of the nar-
rative  analysis  was  on  the  connections  between  mental 
health,  social  context,  and  experiences  linked  to  migra-
tion and settlement.

Drawing on the concept of social context as an analyti-
cal  entry  point,  thematic  narratives  were  identified 
through  dialogue  and  building  consensus  among  the 
authors. Throughout the analysis, the authors engaged in 
dialogue on the convergent and divergent interpretations 
and  the  collective  intellectual  contribution  stemming 
from their epistemological perspectives as well as schol-
arship standpoints. All names that appear in the findings 
are  pseudonyms;  where  possible,  the  research  partici-
pants selected their own pseudonyms.

Findings

Within  a  study  focused  on  the  social  context  of  mental 
health, the participants described their everyday experi-
ences  as  immigrant  and  refugee  young  men  in  Canada. 
The analysis revealed three prevailing narratives: a better 
life,  living  the  (immigrant)  dream,  and  starting  again 
from  way  below.  These  narratives  were  interconnected 
and  underpinned  by  a  central  theme  of  negotiating  sec-
ond-class citizenship.

A Better Life

for a better life was  often  framed  in terms of physical, 
political,  economic  and  social  safety,  and  security  
in Canada. During one group interview, several partici-
pants  echoed  similar  reasons  for  migrating:  the  pos-
sibility  of  “a  new  life,”  “more  security,”  and  “better 
opportunities.”

Daniel, who moved to Canada to study as an interna-
tional student, highlighted the stress he experienced on a 
daily basis in his home country,

Everything is so dangerous… I was robbed twice – people 
would just take a knife or a gun and just, you know, “Give 
me your wallet,” – that’s pretty common, you know? (Age 
20, Brazil, international student)

He recounted how he avoided particular neighborhoods 
and  exercised  vigilance  to  avoid  being  robbed  and/or 
assaulted.  He  perceived  that  community  violence  and 
crime  only  occurred  in  his  pre-migration  country,  and 
was likely not aware that Canadian youth in marginalized 
neighborhoods also experience similar violence.

In addition to physical safety, participants referred to a 
better life as the hope for political stability and security as 
an impetus for migrating. For some young men, moving 
to Canada came with the promise of refuge from war. As 
one participant explained, “Here [in Canada] there’s more 
security,  some  countries  have  war.”  Nabhan,  a  young 
refugee, recounted some of his experiences growing up in 
Afghanistan:

That time the Taliban – they just came to Afghanistan and 
attacked the entire country. So, they had really strict rules – 
like,  really  strict,  like  woman  shouldn’t  go  outside  from 
house, not at all, they have to put the cover… and I respect 
my  religion,  and  it  was  really  strict,  like  we  are  human, 
everyone does mistake… but back in the day – you have to 
do it or you have to die. Killing humans for them was like 
killing  –  not  even  killing,  it’s  just  cutting  the  bread,  you 
know? Like pieces of bread… (18, Afghanistan, refugee)

Nabhan  recalled  the  physical  danger  as  well  as  human 
rights infringements that he and his family experienced. 
He shared that his parents experienced ongoing struggles 
in ensuring the safety of all their children and that when 
he reached the age of 16, his family sent him to Canada 
alone to seek asylum.

For  other  participants,  a  better  life  meant  economic 
security and prosperity in Canada, which was often por-
trayed  as  “a  land  of  opportunity”.  One  participant  who 
immigrated with his family explained his parents’ reasons 
for moving to Canada:

In describing their experiences, there were many refer-
ences made by the participants to a narrative of searching 
life.  Their  pre-migration  aspiration 
for  a  better 

They  thought  that  moving  to  Canada  would  be  a  better 
option  for  me  ‘cause  it’s  just  a  better  country  overall  you 
know what I mean with all the corruption going on in Russia 

214 

American Journal of Men’s Health 12(2)  

and  the  president  and  stuff  and…  ‘cause  like  if  I’m  being 
honest Russia is not that much of a wealthy country. (Ivan, 
17, Belarus, immigrant)

Ivan’s dissatisfaction with perceived social and political 
corruptions in Russia shaped his perspectives of hope for 
a more prosperous life in Canada.

A better life also signified social safety and the free-
dom of movement. Luke, an international university stu-
dent, described,

Being on a South African passport, travelling is impossible, 
like I need a visa for everywhere… This is really kind of like 
my ticket out of all of that. (19, South Africa, international 
student)

In  this  regard,  moving  to  Canada  and  the  possibility  of 
becoming Canadian citizens provided a way to navigate a 
global class system that allows or restricts the mobility of 
some  groups  based  on  citizenship  to  specific  nation-
states.  A  South  African  passport,  for  example,  did  
not afford Luke the same right to travel to different coun-
tries as a Canadian passport. This aspiration constructed 
their expectation of Canada as “a better country overall.”
The  pre-migration  construction  of  a  better  life  influ-
enced the range of stories the young men shared regard-
ing  the  places  they  knew  as  home  or  where  they  were 
living before they moved to Canada. Despite the diversity 
of national and regional contexts from which the partici-
pants and their families migrated from, the narrative of a 
better life was pervasive across the young men’s accounts 
and intertwined with the hope for safety, security, rights, 
and prosperity. At the same time, this narrative reinforces 
a  broader  discourse  in  Canadian  society  whereby  low-
income  and  middle-income  countries  are  often  con-
structed  as  problematic  or  inferior  societies,  but  the 
complicities  of  Canadian  foreign  policies  remain 
invisible.

Living the (Immigrant) Dream

In the second narrative, social context was linked to liv-
ing  the  (immigrant)  dream    in  Canada. The  young  men 
described aspects of their new home that positively influ-
ence their mental health, including the proximity of the 
city to mountains and forests, better air quality compared 
to their pre-migration countries, and the relative accessi-
bility  of  public  transportation.  Living  the  (immigrant) 
dream also referred to the prevailing portrayal of Canada 
as an economically prosperous, inclusive, and fair nation 
where  everyone  has  an  equal  opportunity  to  achieve 
upward class mobility.

Within this narrative, the young men saw themselves 
as agents for fulfilling their dreams, as well as the aspira-
tions of their families. Education was recognized as req-
uisite for securing jobs, and therefore depicted as the key 

to a hopeful future. In this vein, academic achievements, 
such as a good mark on an exam, were often featured in 
accounts  of  positive  emotions  such  as  excitement  and 
feeling “pumped up.” Conversely, failures related to aca-
demic performance were described in accounts of signifi-
cant distress:

A really bad day for me is when some of my teachers got 
mad  at  me  when  I  forget  to  do  homework  or  I  couldn’t 
answer  the  questions…  And,  even  though  they  might  not 
notice it, it will make me depressed for the whole day. (Peter, 
16, Taiwan, immigrant)

In this and other stories, the young men alluded to self-
blame,  disappointment,  and  shame.  As  another  partici-
pant  shared,  “I  got  [my]  report  card  like  yesterday  and 
[was] very upset… I feel like how should I explain it to 
my  parents?”  (James,  17,  Taiwan,  immigrant).  Within 
these  accounts,  self-talk  was  interjected  as  if  to  reveal 
that the young men knew that they were expected to work 
harder and “be better.”

The fear of failure was aggravated by the young men’s 
worries over disappointing their parents together with the 
desire  to  realize  the  collective  family  aspirations.  One 
young man who immigrated with his family explained:

Well like it was kind of the whole thing of we came to this 
country  and…  it’s  like,  “Are  you  just  going  to  go  to 
[college]?  You  could’ve  made  it  to  [university].  But  you 
were just too lazy.” (Nicholas, 19, Philippines, immigrant)

He alluded to a sense of shame in his perceived inability 
to exert the effort and focus required during a window of 
opportunity for upward social mobility.

For several participants, the amount of effort required 
of  them  at  times  exceeded  their  physical  and  mental 
capacity to juggle multiple responsibilities:

I’m just overloaded, just boom. Sometimes I gotta work like 
16 hours… the homework, the school, a pretty tight schedule 
every  day,  just  got  to  manage  it  and…  there  are  chores 
around the house, homework, and all that kind of just piles 
up on you, weight on your shoulders, you know. (Ivan, 17, 
Belarus, immigrant)

These  participants  emphasized  the  stress  and  emotional 
toll of financial hardship on their families and the signifi-
cant pressure it generated for the young men to succeed in 
school. The constant stress and pressure to achieve was a 
trigger for negative thoughts. For Aaron, this led to sev-
eral years of suicidal ideation:

I’m not forced by my parents to do anything, but I know I’m 
obligated to them just ‘cause I feel like I owe them that much 
at least - so when I do poorly… it really stresses me out and 
um it kind of just gets all the bad thoughts coming…you just 
want it to end and how else is it going to end, right? There

just  doesn’t  seem  like  any…  other  solution…  ‘cause  you 
can’t  just  put  a  pause  on  everything,  right?  (18,  Bosnia, 
immigrant)

challenge came up often regarding experiences of distress 
as well as difficulties around establishing social connec-
tions. Joseph, who immigrated with his family, shared:

When  the  young  men  observed  the  difficulties  faced  by 
their  parents  during  resettlement,  they  felt  a  sense  of 
responsibility  and  obligation  that  weighed  heavily  on 
them. Their attempts to meeting family expectations were 
often  accomplished  at  the  expense  of  not  being  able  to 
explore  or  focus  on  what  they  truly  wanted  for 
themselves.

At the same time, more tensions and internal struggles 
unfolded within a context whereby a good education no 
longer  translated  into  secure  employment.  In  Hedayat’s 
words:

Coming towards the latter half of my university degree, it’s 
like,  “Hey,  what  am  I  going  to  do?”  I  started  to  get  that 
malaise where, you know, I just stay at home and I start to 
fuse  with  my  bed  and  become  not  a  person  anymore… 
where you’re just wandering around, you have no idea what 
the  f—  you’re  doing  or  what  the  f—  anything  is.  (20, 
Bangladesh, immigrant)

For  Hedayat  and  his  peers,  the  portrayal  of  Canada  as 
essentially egalitarian was seen as a benchmark or start-
ing point against which achievements and their families’ 
struggles were evaluated. As a result, the young men who 
framed their struggles through this narrative spoke about 
failures  of  individuals  rather  than  the  failure  of  institu-
tions, systems, and policies that were supposed to support 
them.

Starting Again From Way Below

In the third narrative, the young men focused on nuanced 
stories about mental health and what it was like for them 
and their families to leave their home countries and reset-
tle  in  Canada  as  immigrants  or  refugees.  The  theme  of 
starting again from way below grappled with the mental 
health implications of the distress the young men experi-
enced in striving to integrate. These experiences included 
learning a new language, trying to understand mainstream 
“Canadian” culture and humor, and navigating the educa-
tion  system.  For  some  participants,  this  narrative  also 
referred to resisting stereotypes about their people, coun-
tries,  and  cultures  and  negotiating  systemic  discrimina-
tion  vis-à-vis  institutionalized  deskilling  practices  and 
unconscious biases, which produce and perpetuate barri-
ers to advancement for members of minority groups.

Limited  ability  to  communicate  in  Canada’s  official 
languages of English and French was a recurring feature 
of accounts of distress. As language and culture are intri-
cately intertwined, many of the young men experienced 
the phenomenon of knowing the English  words but not 
the  contextual  meaning  that  was  culture-bound.  This 

What caused the stress was when I was communicating with 
my classmates. Now I still couldn’t really understand what 
they said to me back then … sometimes it felt like they were 
joking but sometimes it didn’t quite feel like it and I didn’t 
really know where to go. (17, China, immigrant)

The  challenge  of  understanding  the  contexts  specific  to 
everyday  conversations  with  others  rendered  a  sense  of 
social isolation.

When confronted with experiences of marginalization, 
the young men shared that at times they were forced to 
respond in ways that were considered to be antisocial. In 
Kavan’s words, “I didn’t really understand how to make 
friends in Canada so… I was just getting into fights with 
the other kids in elementary school and… just not really 
understanding their humour” (18, India, immigrant).

The young men also spoke about their frequent encoun-
ters with stereotypes about people from their countries of 
origin,  and  misinformed  presumptions  about  their  cul-
tures. Nabhan, a refugee from Afghanistan, described the 
discomfort he felt whenever his fellow students at school 
asked him or spoke about “his people”:

My friends were just kind of – “Oh, you guys just wanna –,” 
like in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Gaza and those places, there 
was  lots  of  fighting  and  he  was  like  then,  “Why  you  guys 
don’t want peace in your country?” – I was like, “Well, you 
can’t just describe the whole country by one or couple people” 
(18, Afghanistan, refugee)

Underpinning Nabhan’s experiences are practices of ste-
reotyping, profiling, and discrimination in Canada based 
on generalizations about the people in specific regions in 
the world. Hedayat described similar experiences outside 
of school:

“The most overt kinds of racism that I’ve gotten is generally 
because of my last name – when we go through borders or 
airports or whatever security like that, just because it always 
sets off the flags” (20, Bangladesh, immigrant).

These “flags” referred to increasing state surveillance of 
particular groups who fit a hypothesized profile of dan-
ger, which functions to sustain the mainstream discourses 
in Canada about national identity.

Within  the  school  system,  the  young  men  described 
feelings of distress in experiencing or witnessing particu-
lar circumstances that seemed unfair to them. For exam-
ple, Joey, a high school student (16, China, immigrant), 
described  how  he  saw  his  friend  being  held  back  in  a 
class: “…the teacher was being biased… it’s just that the 
way he talks or like the tone of voice, it changes when he 

216 

American Journal of Men’s Health 12(2)  

speaks  to  different  people.”  Prompted  to  clarify,  Joey 
offered,  “Perhaps  um  race?  I  don’t  know.  Race  or  gen-
der.” Immediately following this, he scanned the café in 
which the interview was taking place and continued:

I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this but he [the teacher] 
is  nicer  to  girls  in  general  and  he’s  nicer  to  non-Asian,  I 
mean  non-Chinese  people.  I  don’t  know  why.  Like  other 
students told me about this too - I’m not the only one who 
thinks that. But then he’s not the only teacher who does that. 
(16, China, immigrant)

What began as Joey’s response to an interview question 
about a difficult day and his distress in seeing his friend 
being unfairly treated in class led to guarded disclosure of 
instantiations  of  discrimination,  in  which  the  work  of 
immigrant or refugee students were discounted. The only 
recourse  for  Joey  was  to  “just  put  up  with  him  [the 
teacher], not argue with him … just study hard, prove that 
I spent a lot of effort.”

Despite  being  a  second-generation  immigrant  young 
man,  Henry  (22,  China)  expressed  concern  or  worries 
about his future based on his parents’ experiences,

It  was  really  hard  to  find  jobs,  especially  when  you  were 
Asian at that time, because… they were more or less really 
focused on Caucasian people… [and] because [my parents’] 
credentials from their birthplace weren’t really transferable to 
here.

Other participants described their parents’ experiences 
of  downward  mobility  vis-à-vis  practices  and  policies 
that shape the recognition of international credentials, a 
process  often  referred  to  as  deskilling.  In  the  words  of 
Matthew, an international student in Canada: “[My par-
ents] lost most of their degrees and reputations– so they 
were reduced pretty far down and had to start over again 
with  their  lives  basically”  (19,  South  Africa).  These 
accounts illuminate the realities faced by immigrant and 
refugee  families  who  experience  deskilling,  difficulties 
finding  adequate  and  equitable  employment,  and  finan-
cial hardship. These experiences also reflect institutional-
ized devaluation of education and professional credentials 
from particular countries.

The challenges faced by their families once moving to 
Canada  exacerbated  the  pressures  experienced  by  the 
young men to fulfill the dreams of academic success and 
financial  security.  In  Henry’s  words  (22,  China,  immi-
grant), “It used to be like, do we have enough next month 
to  pay  for  everything  and  to  eat…  so  that  led  to  more 
pressure growing up.” Aaron’s experiences were similar 
(18, Bosnia, immigrant):

It was hard, we didn’t have a lot of money – we never really 
had a lot of money. My dad always worked as a truck driver 

so he was always away for long amounts of time. So he was 
never  really  present.  My  mom’s  always  had  a  pretty  hard 
time just managing money and everything.

Aaron described his mother’s recent diagnosis of cancer 
and the resulting financial and emotional impact on the 
family.  He  emphasized  a  strong  sense  of  responsibility 
for his ill mother and younger brother, and how he strived 
to fill the shoes of an absent father while also longing for 
his mother’s support. For the young men, financial sup-
port for the family was understood and accepted as a col-
lective undertaking by both parents and children, which 
was particularly challenging when their parents took ill.

However,  illnesses  in  the  family  were  often  tied  to 
complex  social  determinants  that  posed  challenges  that 
were not easily resolved. Henry shared,

A long time ago, my mom told me – my dad – he has, like, a 
depression  disorder  kind  of  thing,  so  he  was  basically  on 
meds  for  a  few  years  until  he  secured  a  job…  Maybe  the 
reason  why  he  felt  that  way  was  he  thought  that  when  he 
came here with his previous degree and work experience, he 
could  be  really  prospering  in  a  new  country  –  but  maybe 
when he found out it doesn’t work that way, then that might 
have  been  the  point  where  he  couldn’t  handle  that  –  he 
couldn’t face that he needed to start over and basically re-do 
everything and start from way below. (22, China, immigrant)

Henry’s  account  of  his  father’s  depression  illustrated  the 
potential  impact  of  “broken”  immigrant  dreams,  which 
shape the experiences of immigrant and refugee fathers in 
Canada. When immigrant fathers were not able to meet the 
ideal of prosperity and success, the pressures to alleviate the 
family’s economic and social hardship were passed down to 
their  children.  Henry  recalled  his  mother  saying,  “If  you 
want things to get better, you and your brother will have to 
do well in school and get a degree and not be like us.” 

For Nabhan, education meant much more than personal 
gain; the survival of his family was intricately connected 
to his achievements:

I kept telling [my lawyer] that I want to bring my family… I 
know their life is in danger. He told me, all you have to do is 
focus on yourself. Just stay away from trouble, always try to 
get a good education, be a nice citizen – if you do all those 
rules,  then  you  might  possibly,  there  is  more  chances  to 
bring your family… you have to be good citizen, you have to 
have a good income, support them – because the government, 
they don’t want to take care of other people, you know? (18, 
Afghanistan, refugee)

The  young  men  encountered  an  implicit  but  strong 
directive to be ‘good’ citizens by earning a good income 
and  being  self-reliant.  In  Nabhan’s  words,  “they  [the 
Canadian government] don’t want to waste their money 

Hilario et al. 

217

on  you  if  you’re  just  a  useless  person.”  Through  this 
account, the ability to demonstrate being a ‘useful’ person 
in Canada was rendered a priority by the young men  in 
the context of a neoliberal society. At the same time, the 
participants  experienced  a  hyper-awareness  that  they 
were  viewed  as  “different.”  As  Raymond,  a  second- 
generation immigrant from Taiwan explained,

Even  though  I  grew  up  here  I  always  knew  that  I  was 
different because of my race and I think a lot of times Asians 
were viewed as foreigners even though we’ve been here for 
a  really  long  time. And  I  think  there’s  sometimes  a  glass 
ceiling  for  Asians  in  terms  of  opportunities.  Which  is 
difficult because we’re just as Canadian as anyone else here 
but  we’re  not  treated  like  one…  And  that’s  frustrating 
because  you  know  we’re  here  and  yet  we  don’t  have  the 
opportunities sometimes. (17, Taiwan, immigrant)

Raymond used the metaphor of the glass ceiling to refer 
to institutional practices that prevent those who are per-
ceived  as  foreigners  in  Canada  from  full  inclusion  and 
access to opportunities.

Hedayat, who referred to himself as “Brown” several 
times  during  his  interview,  drew  on  superheroes  to 
describe  how  difference  can  at  times  operate  through 
mainstream popular culture:

Super heroes…are meant to be our role models. That’s how 
kids  learn  their  lessons  better  than  they  ever  will  from 
school… but then what if there’s just the kids that can’t take 
these  lessons  from  them  because  of  that  disconnect  –  that 
you  have  to  turn  yourself  White  to  be  able  to  learn  these 
lessons. (20, Bangladesh, immigrant)

He explained how media and other discourses shape the 
experiences of racial minority young men in Canada by 
telling  them  that,  “to  be  heroic  or  to  be  cool  or  to  be 
attractive or to be any of these things that you aspire to 
from the media was also simultaneously to be White.”

Starting again from way below positioned the young 
men in relation to a benchmark of institutional practices 
and discourses that often rendered them and their families 
as second-class citizens. In this social context, immigrant 
and  refugee  young  men  were  also  marginalized  from 
engaging in conversations about mental health. As Hedayat 
explained,

For immigrants and people of color there’s specific issues, 
just specific emotions that are hard to deal with… anger and 
pain and things that you’re not really allowed to show in the 
context of being vulnerable. (20, Bangladesh, immigrant)

While the young men strived to be “just as Canadian as 
anyone else,” they also recognized the glass ceiling that 
held  back  visible  minority  communities  from  realizing 
their dreams of a better life. The narrative of starting again 

from way below characterizes the realities faced by some 
immigrant  and  refugee  young  men  in  Canada.  Within  a 
context of marginalization and vulnerability, the distress 
of immigrant and refugee young men is disallowed.

Discussion

Informed by the concept of social context as an analytical 
entry  point,  the  analysis  revealed  three  thematic  narra-
tives:  a  better  life,  living  the  (immigrant)  dream,  and 
starting again from way below. The narratives character-
ized the social context for immigrant and refugee young 
men and were connected by a central theme of negotiat-
ing second-class citizenship.

The first narrative provides insights into the migration 
and resettlement experiences of the participants and the 
search  for  a  better  life.  Despite  experiences  of  loss  and 
trauma, the stories were largely underpinned by a strong 
sense of hope, which was often constructed in juxtaposi-
tion  to  negative  portrayals  of  their  countries  of  origin. 
Perhaps it was this strong sense of hope for a better life 
that influenced some of the young men to paint a picture 
of  dire  situations  in  their  pre-migration  countries.  The 
narrative of a better life also implicated the young men in 
the production of a broader discourse of Canada as a mor-
ally superior society, which makes invisible the ways in 
which the actions, practices, and policies of Canada are 
intertwined  with  the  actions,  practices,  and  policies  of 
other  nation-states  to  impact  the  lives  of  people  within 
and  across  nations.  It  may  also  be  that  the  young  men 
deployed these portrayals in order to adhere to the expec-
tation  for  newcomers  and  second-class  citizens  to  per-
form public gratitude to Canada through speech acts.

The  second  narrative  focuses  on  living  the  (immi-
grant) dream. Within this narrative, Canada is portrayed 
as an economically prosperous, inclusive, and fair nation 
where  everyone  is  given  an  equal  opportunity  to  excel 
and succeed. The narrative imposed a persuasion for the 
young men to recognize immigration as a benefit, if not a 
reward. Despite the dominant discourses of multicultural-
ism and social inclusion in Canada, the everyday realities 
of the young men reflected a mixed narrative of hopeful-
ness as well as a broken dream.

The  third  narrative,  starting  again  from  way  below, 
refers to the ways in which immigrant and refugee young 
men respond to difficulties after moving to Canada and 
the  impacts  on  their  mental  health.  This  narrative  sug-
gests  a  social  context  in  which  immigrant  and  refugee 
groups,  particularly  those  who  are  visible  minorities, 
experience  marginalization  and  discrimination  through 
institutional  practices  and  mainstream  discourses.  It 
sheds  light  on  the  connections  between  the  immigrant 
dream  and  the  neoliberal  ideologies  in  which  resilience 
and failure are individualized. Furthermore, the notion of 

218 

American Journal of Men’s Health 12(2)  

citizenship as tied to nation-states is troubled in accounts 
of  institutional  discrimination.  Canadian  practices  of 
deskilling  and  denial  of  international  credentials  are 
shaped  by  structural  racism,  which  is  intertwined  with 
visible minority status.

Across  the  three  narratives,  the  findings  from  this 
study highlight the diverse experiences of immigrant and 
refugee young men in Canada. The authors acknowledge 
the strengths as well as potential limitations of including 
a diverse group of participants who identified  as  immi-
grants or refugees in one study. In doing so, the intent was 
not to conflate the experiences of these young men or to 
claim an exhaustive analysis of all experiences shared in 
the interviews. Instead, the aim was to provide a focused 
and  nuanced  analysis  of  their  social  context  through 
detailing patterns and diversity in their narratives.

Although the young men’s everyday experiences were 
different  based  on  their  ethnic  backgrounds  and  current 
life circumstances, many shared the common experiences 
of  marginalization.  For  example,  the  accounts  of  the 
young men who were from the Middle East and/or were 
Muslim suggested instances of Islamophobia, whereas the 
accounts of several Asian young men referred to anti-Chi-
nese sentiments in Canada. A study with refugee youth in 
Canada  reported  similar  findings  regarding  intersecting 
forms  of  discrimination  related  to  language  proficiency, 
newcomer status, and being part of a visible minority or 
racialized group (Edge, Newbold, & McKeary, 2014).

Among  immigrant  youth  in  Canada,  research  has 
shown that inclusion is linked to exclusionary factors such 
as “us/them” constructs, aversive and color-blind racism, 
racialized  habitus,  and  notions  of  “worthiness”  (Naffi, 
2016).  A  recent  article  reported  a  public  discourse  in 
Canada of racial minority immigrants and refugees being 
so rich that they are contributing to the affordability crisis 
and so poor that they are draining the system of services, 
supports, and resources (Ball, 2017). This discourse dem-
onstrates the biases in Canadian society that construct and 
justify  the  exclusionary  practice  of  placing  White 
Canadians into the category of true, first-class citizens and 
placing racial minority immigrants and refugees into the 
category of not-quite-Canadian second-class citizens.

The findings from this study contribute to the litera-
ture on the mental health of immigrant and refugee young 
men. There is a paucity of research focused on the per-
spectives of young immigrant and refugee men, particu-
larly  regarding  their  everyday  experiences  of  mental 
health.  The  findings  point  to  the  importance  of  mental 
health promotion initiatives that address the social deter-
minants of mental health inequities by using frameworks 
that go beyond a focus on culture to examine the social 
contexts, exclusionary processes, and everyday discrimi-
nation that shape the mental health experiences of immi-
grant and refugee populations in Canada and worldwide. 

This study makes important contributions to the literature 
on  men’s  and  health  by  offering  nuanced  narratives 
regarding mental health from the perspectives of young 
men who identify as immigrants and refugees in Canada.
Fostering the mental health of immigrant, refugee and 
racialized  populations  (Mental  Health  Commission  of 
Canada,  2012)  can  be  tied  in  with  committed  efforts  to 
allocate financial and human resources to address social 
determinants of mental health (World Health Organization, 
2014b).  Networks  and  knowledge-sharing  platforms 
offer a way to exchange promising practices. Promising 
practices  include  collaborations  between  mental  health 
services  and  resettlement  programs,  local  community 
centers, and school systems wherein many immigrant and 
refugee  young  men  pass  through.  Evidence-informed 
resources such as the Canadian Pediatric Society Caring 
for  Kids  New  to  Canada  (Hilario,  Vo,  &  Pottie,  2015) 
provide  guidance  for  service  providers  working  with 
immigrant and refugee young men.

Implications for Future Research

The findings from this study indicate the viability of social 
context as a conceptual lens in studies with immigrant and 
refugee young men. Future research in this area may also 
draw on an intersectional approach as a way to focus on 
the  social  determinants  of  mental  health  and  to  provide 
nuanced  insights  into  the  experiences  of  immigrant  and 
refugee young men at the intersection of gender, immigra-
tion,  and  race  (Griffith,  Ellis,  &  Allen,  2013;  Viruell-
Fuentes,  Miranda,  & Abdulrahim,  2012).  The  results  of 
this study also suggest that the concept of minority stress 
(Meyer, 1995) may provide further analytical insights in 
future research with immigrant and refugee  young men. 
Drawing  on  the  minority  stress  model,  future  research 
could  explore  the  impacts  of  racism—in  the  forms  of 
interpersonal  violence,  socioeconomic  marginalization, 
and institutional discrimination—on mental health indica-
tors (Karlsen & Nazroo, 2002).

Lastly, future research could further explicate the rela-
tionship  between  mental  health  and  social  citizenship. 
Social citizenship can be understood as a space in which 
different actors negotiate individual and collective rights 
within  the  context  of  intersecting  social  divisions  and 
relations (Koopmans, Statham, Giugni, & Passy, 2005). 
According  to Young  (1989),  the  dominant  ideal  of  citi-
zenship,  based  on  universality  as  equality,  has  led  to 
“laws  and  rules  that  are  blind  to  individual  and  group 
difference…[in which] some groups still find themselves 
treated as second-class citizens” (p. 250).

Addressing  health  and  social  inequities  in  relation  to 
global migration and citizenship therefore requires trans-
forming  not  only  exclusionary  discourses  and  structures 
interrogating 
that  contribute 

inequities  but  also 

to 

Hilario et al. 

219

dominant understandings of citizenship. Dominelli (2014) 
proposes a re-negotiation of the relationship between the 
nation-state and individuals that would allow for “new citi-
zenship practices that transcend the nation-state by being 
collectively guaranteed, inalienable, globally portable and 
attached to the person” (p. 15). This view would advance 
initiatives and policies that re-define citizenship based on 
inalienable rights and respect for human dignity.

As  the  WHO  Director-General  recently  acknowl-
edged, “The world is experiencing the largest population 
displacements  seen  since  the  end  of  the  Second  World 
War.  The  scale  of  anti-migrant  sentiment  is  equally 
unprecedented”  (World  Health  Organization,  2015). 
Innovative solutions, therefore, are needed to effectively 
address the mental health needs of immigrant and refugee 
men within the current social climate worldwide. Health 
and social policies that are informed by a view of citizen-
ship  as  “institutionalized  fairness”  (Young,  1989)  may 
contribute  to  shaping  the  types  of  practices  that  will 
strengthen the fabric of Canadian society by supporting 
members to live to their fullest potential and, ultimately, 
foster better mental health for all.
