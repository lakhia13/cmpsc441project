Leveling Up Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Autistic
Individuals with Emotion Dysregulation:
Clinical and Personal Insights

Abstract

Autistic people may experience high emotion and sensory sensitivities and a slow return to baseline emotional
state. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was developed to address reactivity, impulsivity, and mood dysre-
gulation in individuals with mood and personality disorders. DBT may be therapeutically beneﬁcial to autistic
individuals struggling with these or similar emotional and sensory challenges. This article is a synthesis of the
ﬁrst author’s experiences of DBT as an autistic person and professional insights from all authors. We provide an
overview of the development of DBT, its foundational components, and adaptations. Using this basis, the ﬁrst
author describes the beneﬁts DBT has had, the modiﬁcations that have helped him, and how those modiﬁcations
may enhance DBT for autistic people. Modiﬁcations include visuals, graphics, and a gaming format that target
the client’s personal interests. The essence of these alterations is to transform life skills and DBT skills into
something meaningful and functional. Receptivity of the therapist to the modiﬁcations and neurodivergent
problem solving may be foundational to therapeutic success. Client-initiated contributions in collaborative
therapy may improve autistic participants’ understanding, validation, and adherence with DBT. The authors
suggest expanding work on DBT modiﬁcations for autism in the areas of daily self-monitoring, assessing for
preferred visual and gaming formats, and utilizing personal interests.

Keywords: dialectical behavior therapy, autism, emotion dysregulation

Community Brief

Why is this topic important?

Many autistic people struggle with their emotions. There are few therapies that assist autistic people with these
challenges. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a therapy that teaches skills for coping with emotions and
forming healthy bonds with others. DBT may provide beneﬁts to autistic people.

What is the purpose of this article?

This article uses personal insights with DBT from the ﬁrst author. The article combines the professional
expertise of all authors. We talk about the strengths DBT may have for autistic people. We recommend changes
to make DBT a more helpful therapy.

What personal or professional perspectives do the authors bring to this topic?

The ﬁrst author is an autistic researcher in psychology. He has other mental health disabilities. He has been in
DBT. The second author is an autistic person working in autism research and advocacy. The remaining authors
are non-autistic. They do research and therapy with autistic people.

What is already known about this topic?

DBT is used to help people manage their emotions and engage with others successfully. Many autistic people
struggle with these skills. There is not a lot of research on how DBT can beneﬁt autistic people. Early work has
shown that it might be effective for autistic people.

What do the authors recommend?

We outline several changes to DBT that might make it more helpful to autistic people. One change included is
using images to help autistic people keep track of therapy skills. Another suggested change is making therapy
into a game. More research is needed to test if these changes work in larger groups of autistic people.

How will these recommendations help autistic adults now or in the future?

We hope therapists use these changes to DBT to better support autistic people. We hope that this encourages
more research into how DBT can better help autistic people. Autistic people may also beneﬁt from DBT skills
in their own lives.

The Perspectives of This Article

I, Elliot Gavin Keenan, am an individual with autism and
co-occurring pediatric-onset rapid-cycling Bipolar 1 disorder,
as well as traits of borderline personality disorder (BPD), and
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined
type. I am a PhD candidate at the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA) in Human Development and Psychology,
where my research has focused on autism and bipolar disor-
der. A number of scholars endorse the use of lived experience
in clinical research and believe that sharing these experiences
enrich the ﬁeld.1 I received dialectical behavior therapy
(DBT)2 in an intensive outpatient format. I wrote the initial
draft of this article, completely of my own inspiration and
volition, and not by suggestion of any person. I then (and only
then) sought written and verbal feedback from each of the
other authors, as well as relevant background writing in key
substantive domains (e.g., historical and contemporary DBT
development and practice).

I struggle with unexpected changes in daily routine, tran-
sitions, and activities of daily living. My psychiatrist at the
UCLA describes my bipolar disorder as ‘‘brittle,’’ rapidly
alternating between severe depression and dysphoric mixed
episodes characterized by insomnia, lack of appetite or thirst
(leading to dehydration and anemia), meltdowns, transient
visual hallucinations, and somatic delusions. I have been
treated with many medications, including mood stabilizers,
all atypical antipsychotics approved in the United States
(except for clozapine), typical antipsychotics, and other drugs
including benzodiazepines. I currently take lithium, risper-
idone, amphetamine salts, diazepam, and olanzapine as
needed. I was enrolled in an intensive DBT outpatient pro-
gram that was highly adherent to Linehan’s model of DBT
(which is, DBT that follows the formula set forth by its
original creator, Linehan, and includes all four treatment
modalities: individual therapy, skills group, phone coaching,
and therapist participation in a DBT treatment team) after
seeing only limited improvement from medication alone.

Introduction

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)2,3 was devel-

oped by Marsha Linehan for individuals with high emo-
tion dysregulation. These individuals may also exhibit target
behaviors such as self-harm or chronic suicidality4,5—this of-
ten maps onto borderline personality disorder (BPD), yet DBT
has been found to be helpful for addressing an array of diag-
noses beyond BPD,6,7 including chronic depression, substance
use disorders, and some eating disorders. DBT features an in-
tegration of change and acceptance skills (some of which are
drawn from Zen Buddhism)3 that have been regarded as ef-
fective for treating chronic suicidality8 and has long been held
as the most effective treatment for BPD, although few ran-
domized controlled trials have been performed due to the
vulnerable nature of the patients DBT is designed for.8

DBT FOR AUTISM

Little work, however, has been performed examining the
applications of Linehan’s DBT among autistic people. This is
surprising given the prevalence of mood dysregulation9,10
and high rates of co-occurrence with mood and anxiety dis-
orders.11,12 Dysregulated emotional reactions are common
among autistic people13,14 and likely an important antecedent
to the increased rate of suicide15 observed in the autistic
community. Despite the prevalence of co-occurring emotion
dysregulation and elevated rates of self-harm and suicidality
in autistic people,11,14,15 DBT as originally formulated by
Marsha Linehan7 has not been systematically evaluated as a
primary support in this community.

There have been several adaptations of DBT that differ from
Linehan’s DBT because they are aimed at individuals with
developmental differences (including autism but not speciﬁ-
cally autism). One is Julie Brown’s Skills System for emotion
dysregulation.9 It teaches emotion regulation skills in a pre-
scribed stepwise, almost gamiﬁed manner with a speciﬁc
number of skills recommended for use based on the level of
emotion dysregulation the individual is experiencing. It also
appears to enhance the teaching of interpersonal effectiveness
skills. It may do little, however, to address issues related to
ﬂexibility and openness to novel experiences. Thus, it might do
a poorer job of addressing the issues of overcontrol (insistence
social and cognitive rigidity, obsessive-
on sameness,
compulsive disorder-like symptoms) seen in autistic clients.

Also, it is designed for individuals with cognitive challenges
and may not be the most appropriate adaptation for individuals
without intellectual disability. In contrast, radically open dia-
lectical behavior therapy (RO-DBT)16 is designed for disorders
of overcontrol (including obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder and autism). This is designed to clearly address the
needs of autistic individuals but loses the laser-like focus of
Linehan’s DBT on managing emotional dysregulation, as it
focuses more on social signaling. Finally, DBT-autism+ is an
additional example of an adapted curriculum that simpliﬁes and
makes more concrete the core concepts of DBT while main-
taining a high level of adherence to Linehan’s model.

The primary targets of these therapies (except for DBT-
autism+) are developmental differences, not co-occurring
emotional dysregulation. For autistic people, problems with
emotional dysregulation may have to be dealt with before
problems with social interaction can be fully addressed, as the
emotion dysregulation interferes with social connection.17 As
such, there remains a critical need to adapt and evaluate
supports, which are appropriate for autistic people with co-
occurring emotional disorders. See Table 1 for a comparison
of DBT adaptations. Although adaptations for autism have
been proposed, little published work has examined speciﬁc
recommendations on how to do so.18

Some preliminary work has looked at DBT (and variants
such as RO-DBT) in autistic people with co-occurring emotion
dysregulation and found it to be feasible,19 acceptable to cli-
ents, and potentially effective at reducing emotion dysregula-
tion20 and reducing global distress.21 While there are ongoing
studies,19,22 there are still little empirical data on the effec-
tiveness of DBT for emotional dysregulation in autistic people.

Autism and emotion dysregulation

Evidence suggests that autistic people can beneﬁt from
DBT skills such as mindfulness and distress tolerance23 to

cope with emotion dysregulation and improve interpersonal
relationships. Autistic people commonly have problems with
mood dysregulation.10,14 Some autistic people have problems
related to thought disorder
(e.g., overthinking, getting
‘‘stuck,’’ and cognitive rigidity).

Autism is a heterogeneous condition at times consistent
with both overcontrol (an attempt to exert excessive levels of
control, exempliﬁed by insistence on sameness, social and
cognitive rigidity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder-like
symptoms) and undercontrol (which includes disinhibited
behaviors such as attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
[ADHD]-like symptoms, meltdowns, ‘‘stimming’’ or repeti-
tive motor behaviors—since stimming is a disinhibited be-
havior,24 or a behavior which top-down control can be
exerted over—not that it is always helpful to do so, yet this is
an idea which is often mentioned in discussions about
‘‘masking’’ autistic behaviors25,26). Moreover, autism fre-
quently co-occurs with mood and personality disorders,
which may be understood as undercontrolled such as ADHD
and BPD. All these disorders co-occur at rates higher than the
non-autistic population mean rate, meaning that they are all
more common in autism.27

Some autistic people meet criteria for BPD, an overlap that
may be attributable to trauma; one study of women with BPD
found that 15% met criteria for autism, and this co-
occurrence was associated with lower global functioning and
more frequent suicide attempts.28 A meta-analysis found that
4% of adults with autism had BPD (pooled prevalence)29;
however, the samples from which this pooled estimate was
drawn were small and most of them were at risk of bias.

Bipolar disorder is also prevalent in the autistic commu-
nity. One study found that 30% of pediatric bipolar 1 patients
met criteria for autism; co-occurrence was associated with
more severe bipolar disorder, and the mean age of onset for
bipolar disorder was younger in those who had autism.30 A
meta-analysis estimated that 7% of autistic individuals have
bipolar disorder31 while this number drops to 2% of the
general population.32 A case–control birth cohort study in
Sweden found elevated risk of bipolar disorder among those
who were diagnosed with autism before age 28.33

Another disorder that can feature emotion dysregulation is
ADHD; it is frequently co-occurring with autism and shares
overlapping features to the extent that it is still debated whether
they form a single continuum.34 Interestingly, hyperactivity is
predictive of severe mood problems in autistic adolescents.10
Other neurotypes may impact regulatory abilities, especially
among the frontostriatal developmental disorders (including
obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette’s).35

Foundational components of DBT

Typical comprehensive DBT consists of three main treat-
ment modalities: weekly skills group, weekly individual
therapy, and phone coaching.3,7 During phone coaching calls,
which are limited in their duration, the therapist counsels cli-
ents on how to implement the skills in situations in their daily
life2; this component of the therapy helps to bridge the gap
between knowledge and practice. Diary cards (where clients
log information about their mood, target behaviors such as
suicidality or self-harm, and skills used) also help address this,
and daily completion of the diary card is a requirement of DBT
and a valuable self-monitoring experience.7

DBT, dialectical behavior therapy; RO-DBT, radically open dialectical behavior therapy.

DBT has four modules. The ﬁrst is mindfulness. Practice of
mindfulness is built into DBT to address potential alex-
ithymia36,37 (difﬁculty identifying or describing one’s own
emotions). The second module is distress tolerance, which
teaches strategies for preventing and surviving emotional
crises in the moment. The DBT Skills Training Manual
(by Linehan)2 deﬁnes Distress Tolerance and Crisis Survival
Skills as ‘‘when faced with a difﬁcult situation’’ or ‘‘solutions
to painful situations.’’ (For an autistic person, this may in-
clude situations such as a change in daily routine or transi-
tions between activities.) One strategy is TIP, which stands
for Temperature (cold), Intense exercise, and Paced breathing
(4-in-8-out); this skill changes one’s physiology to change
one’s level of distress. The counterpart to distress tolerance is
the third module, emotional regulation.

This looks at how to regulate mood prophylactically, in-
cluding self-care skills such as balanced eating, sleeping,
caring for illness, and avoidance of mind-altering drugs. The
fourth module is interpersonal effectiveness. In this module,
the ‘‘dialectic’’ of DBT comes to the forefront as clients
consider how to balance their values with their interpersonal
goals, relationship effectiveness, and the contradictions of
everyday life. Interpersonal effectiveness skills may seem
superﬁcially similar to social skills interventions for autism,
but—having experienced both DBT and PEERS (a prominent
social skills intervention for autism)38 for myself (Elliot)—
they are substantially different. Interpersonal effectiveness
does not teach basic social skills in the same way an inter-
vention like PEERS does. It does not teach you how to make
friends—what it does teach you is how to identify your own
personal priorities in a relationship, how to maintain your
self-respect, and when it is time to end unhealthy relation-
ships. The goals of interpersonal effectiveness are tied clo-
sely to emotion dysregulation, not a generalized social
deﬁcit.

‘‘Wise mind’’ refers to a state that is neither overly emo-
tional or hot (‘‘emotion mind’’) nor overly rational or cold
(‘‘rational mind’’). The ‘‘wise mind’’ skill can put a visual

understanding to a core competency in emotion regulation
that is critical in mastering DBT. It also may be helpful in
reducing alexithymia.36,37 To be in wise mind, to make wise
choices to reach one’s ‘‘life worth living,’’ is a goal of
DBT.3,7

How I Adapted DBT

I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental
disorder—not otherwise speciﬁed) when I was 6 years old. It
was only a matter of time (and 18 inpatient hospitalizations)
before I was enrolled in a comprehensive DBT program while
living in California for graduate school. I adapted DBT nat-
uralistically, tinkering with it to make it work for me. I re-
member being very confused by the idea of opposite action.
In using opposite action, you are acting ‘‘opposite’’ to how
your emotion mind is telling you to act (e.g., taking a walk if
you are feeling depressed). This is now an important skill for
me—what I did not understand at ﬁrst is that you are not
trying to ﬁnd what emotion is ‘‘opposite’’ the emotion you
are currently experiencing. I also struggled with the envi-
ronment of the program because I was at home (due to the
COVID-19 pandemic), but I was not allowed to use my
nicotine vaporizer, and the group session went on for just a
little bit longer than my ADHD could handle. I made ample
use of ﬁdget objects during skills group. During DBT, my
medication regimen was largely stable and included treat-
ment for my bipolar disorder and ADHD.

When adapting evidence-based practices (i.e., those that
integrate high-quality research with clinical expertise against
the backdrop of the personal characteristics of the individu-
al),39 it is important to meet the needs of your target com-
munity without losing the core active ingredients of the
therapy. All four core domains of DBT remain important for
autistic individuals, but reasonable accommodations based
on lived experiences of and best practices for supporting
autistic individuals may help to promote client engagement,
retention, and use of core skills.

DBT FOR AUTISM

Selection of appropriate materials and group

The nature of DBT is for clients to become experts in the
therapy. My therapist at CBT California asked me to come up
with this list of recommendations; DBT is the only support I
have experienced where being a client is explicitly compat-
ible with being a collaborator. In fact, collaboration is one of
Linehan’s deﬁning principles, and she came up with DBT
after having had BPD herself.40 A hyperlexic, highly edu-
cated participant (like myself) can read the skills training
manual instead of the regular book. The skills manual is
publicly available by design. The spirit of DBT treats clients
as collaborators and students, and autistic participants should
be treated with the same respect. I struggled when I was
approached in a way that was below my level.

The standard DBT skills manual offers several choices of
activities and explanations for every skill, some of which are
quite concrete. The choice of which activities and explana-
tions from those that are provided in the book might be the
ﬁrst step in making DBT effective for autistic individuals.
Nevertheless, autistic adults who struggle with theory of
mind, pragmatic language, and/or social anxiety are likely to
beneﬁt from more adaptations and a carefully selected,
smaller skills group, perhaps even beginning with individual
therapy before attending group sessions.

Our co-author, Dr. Kappenberg, has found in her own
the Rathus and Miller DBT Skills
clinical practice that
Manual for Adolescents41 is effective for autistic and non-
autistic adolescents and adults. The section on ‘‘Distress
Tolerance and Crisis Survival Skills’’ (pp. 26–49) is a good
example of more visual structure (see the Visual Aids for
Abstract Ideas section) and simpliﬁed content without sac-
riﬁcing adherence. It can be taught as comprehensive,

adapted, or used in a more limited manner (as ‘‘informed by’’
DBT), for example, watered-down DBT with fewer meetings
and no coaching, or DBT as a single component of a het-
erogeneous group of intervention approaches (a structure
often found in inpatient and intensive outpatient programs).

Gamiﬁcation of diary card, target behaviors, and skills

The system that worked for me was a visually presented
‘‘behavioral whiteboard’’ (actually constructed in Google
Slides, to be accessible from my mobile phone) where I check
off having done certain things over the course of a day, a
week (Fig. 1), or a month. I created a more complex system
where multiple blue boxes could score one value and addi-
tional green boxes scored a different value per-box; this was
to ensure that, for example, I had to do cat litter twice per
week to receive any points. Also, you can make the ﬁrst task
completion worth more points than subsequent completions.
Tasks can vary from household chores (in mine, Cat Litter) to
hygiene (in mine, Shower) to speciﬁc target skills (in mine,
the ACCEPTS skill), and you can reference other lists of
activities (in mine, To-Do List). Completion of the diary card
should be a daily task. These tasks not only facilitate exec-
utive functioning, but they can serve as distress tolerance
skills to redirect attention, distract, and regulate emotion.

I implemented an exchange system that would reward
saving up points, as poor ﬁnancial skills are an issue for me.
A wide variety of areas can be targeted using rewards. Further
role-playing elements can be brought into the intervention,
when appropriate. Although this article focuses on adults, my
coauthors have agreed that this might be especially appro-
priate with children and teens. In my chart, I chose all the
images based on my intense interest in Poke´mon.

Visual aids for abstract ideas

It is well recognized that visual cues can beneﬁt autistic
people, for example, when undergoing transitions,42 and
these cues can also be helpful in delivering psychosocial
intervention. Visual aids can be of great use when working
with autistic individuals, and I think the concepts of ‘‘emo-
tion mind’’ and ‘‘rational mind’’ can quickly be established
with a visual scale using a color gradient (e.g., red-to-blue)
accessible to the individual. The goal is to stay within the
bounds of ‘‘wise mind’’ in the center of the scale. Participants
can be asked to point to where they are on the visual scale,
instead of giving only a verbal numerical rating (which is
more difﬁcult for some autistic clients, who may struggle
with giving an answer). Numbers can be added as a visual
guide, if appropriate. It is important for the client to under-
stand that ‘‘attacking emotion mind’’ is not necessarily
‘‘attacking my emotions.’’ Thus, framing the attack and de-
fense spells in the context of the dialectic of emotion mind
versus rational mind is crucial.

Visual concepts can foster meaning. The use of visual aids
is a hallmark of the evidence-based TEACCH Structured
Training approach43 and Valerie Gaus’ Cognitive Behavior
Therapy for Adult Asperger Syndrome.44 Visuals can make
abstract concepts more accessible. They also help individuals
with spatial processing deﬁcits organize information prop-
erly. DBT-autism+ uses the image of an airplane whose ﬂight
can only be steady when the wings (emotion wing and reason
wing) remain in relative balance.45 Other skills and principles
in the DBT modules are similarly broken down using visual
supports and modiﬁed language.46

Incorporating intense interests

pereffective against certain situations, and others are not-
very-effective. Just like in Poke´mon, you must know when to
use the right move for the right situation. After thinking about
this, I created a more generalized formula for gamifying DBT
skills. I call the skills ‘‘spells’’—depending on the person’s
interests, you can call them moves, powers, or really anything
along those lines. They fall into different categories, which
align with the purpose of using those spells (Table 2). In-
corporating intense interests into therapy has already become
popular in adaptations of cognitive-behavioral therapy for
autistic individuals.47 I recommend discovering the client’s
intense interests as soon as possible. Ask them what they are
interested in, or how they spend their free time.

Although my generalized system is based around an RPG
(Role Playing Game, such as Dungeons & Dragons; which is
appropriate for many autistic adults, especially young adults,
being a common interest), it can be adapted to suit a wide
range of interests. Incorporation of intense interests makes
autistic clients more motivated, as well as increasing learning
of the material.48 This incorporation of an autistic person’s
interests is validating to a person who may have felt mar-
ginalized and criticized often. The essence is to transform the
skills into something with equivalent functionality, but with
the ‘‘ﬂavor’’ of the client’s interest.

Use stimming as a tool

Clinicians may also incorporate stimming into their cli-
ents’ practice of mindfulness and even distress tolerance and
emotion regulation skills, as it falls under self-soothing. This
may be a useful regulatory strategy24 for autistic people who
are trying to ﬁgure out how to manage difﬁcult situations and
remain in ‘‘wise-mind.’’

One of my primary intense interests is Poke´mon. Despite
having read the skills training manual twice, my ﬁrst real
‘‘aha!’’ moment with DBT came only when I started to
conceptualize the skills as ‘‘moves’’ like Poke´mon have.
Different moves have different types; some moves are su-

Selection of concrete activities and explanations

As a general principle, autistic adults are likely to prefer
and more readily understand concepts that are presented in a
concrete way, rather than an abstract way.49 This should

inform your choice from the training manual of what activ-
ities and what explanations you include in your teaching of
the skills. The skills themselves are the same, and perhaps, all
of them can be taught in a concrete way. In fact, some of the
skills really beneﬁt from concreteness: to perform the skill
called T(IP) you hold an ice pack over the top half of your
face and hold your breath (if you can—I also use paced
breathing if I can’t, 4-in-8-out) for 30 seconds. There is
nothing abstract about these instructions. The client knows
exactly what to do. However, autistic clients may need to
walk through using these skills in session before they can try
to use them in the real world, as novelty can be very intim-
idating and form a barrier to using the skill.

However, there are some mindfulness exercises that I do
not recommend for autistic individuals—for example, I do
recommend asking oneself ‘‘Is this wise mind?’’ but I do not
recommend ‘‘breathe Wise in and breathe Mind out.’’ The
former will make sense to autistic clients; the latter will likely
confuse since it does not logically compute to anything if
taken literally (it requires abstract thinking). It is much easier
to understand ‘‘Is this wise mind?’’ That said, each individual
will ﬁnd which different skills and implementations work
best for them.

Conclusions

Future research may show that DBT is at least as effective
in autistic people as it is in non-autistic people and that it can
be a great tool to use in individuals with severe emotion
dysregulation, regardless of their diagnosis. However, just as
we have in CBT, we may ﬁnd that slight modiﬁcations to
Linehan’s original protocol will boost accessibility and ef-
fectiveness for autistic clients.

We believe that adapting DBT for autistic people is not
mutually exclusive from building more universally designed
DBT approaches. By adapting DBT for autistic people, we
are building more inclusive and universally designed thera-
pies. However, each group has its own needs and those need
to be assessed individually. What works for autistic indi-
viduals may or may not work for those with other conditions.
As the scope of the article and the journal pertains to autism,
we wrote from that perspective. This article is based on the
ﬁrst author’s lived and professional experience and may not
generalize directly for every autistic person. Future work
needs to ensure that we continue to expand on ensuring DBT
is accessible for all people.

Modiﬁcations such as careful selection of materials and
groups, gamiﬁcation of skills and diary cards, visual supports
for abstract concepts, and opting for concreteness, when
possible, may make DBT more accessible to the autistic
community. Too many autistic people have lived with en-
during stress and hopelessness, and many suffer with sui-
cidality and non-suicidal self-injury. DBT and best practices
in autism intervention share DBTs signature goal of helping
individuals create a life worth living.
