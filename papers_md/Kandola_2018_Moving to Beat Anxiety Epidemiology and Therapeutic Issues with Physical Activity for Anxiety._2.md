Abstract
Purpose of Review The purpose of this paper was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of the relationship between
physical activity (PA) and anxiety and the rationale for including it as a treatment option for anxiety disorders. Several gaps in the
literature are highlighted alongside recommendations for future research.
Recent Findings PA in the general population has established efficacy in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease and
improving wellbeing. Recent epidemiological data further suggests that people who are more active may be less likely to have
anxiety disorders. In addition, evidence from systematic reviews of randomised control trials suggests that exercise training, a
subset of PA, can reduce symptoms in anxiety and stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia
and panic disorder.
Summary Anxiety disorders are common, burdensome and costly to individuals and wider society. In addition to the profound
negative impact on individuals’ wellbeing and functioning, they are associated with worsened physical health, including a higher
risk for cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Although pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions are helpful
for many, these treatment approaches are not effective for everyone and are insufficient to address common physical health
complications, such as the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Given the combined anxiolytic and physical health benefits of
increased activity, PA presents a promising additional treatment option for people with anxiety disorders. However, there remain
key gaps in the literature regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of PA, optimal PA protocols, methods of improving
adherence and the importance of physical fitness. These must be addressed for PA to be successfully implemented in mental
health services.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are a heterogeneous cluster of common
mental health disorders typically characterised by hyperarous-
al, excessive fear and worry [1]. Although anxiety disorders
are generally characterised by feelings of anxiety, symptoms
can manifest themselves differently depending on the disorder
subtype. Subtypes of anxiety disorders include generalised
anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia, panic disorder, specif-
ic phobias, agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder and se-
lective mutism. Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent with
global estimates ranging from 3.8 to 25% across countries,
with estimates of prevalence rates as high as 70% in people
with chronic health conditions [2]. These widespread disor-
ders have a debilitating impact on people’s daily functioning,
quality of life and wellbeing [3]. Data from the Global Burden
of Disease study suggests that anxiety disorders are the sixth
leading cause of global disability [4], accounting for 26.8 mil-
lion disability-adjusted life years [5]. Anxiety disorders are
highly comorbid with other mental disorders [6], including
depression [7] and substance use disorders [8]. Worryingly,
anxiety disorders are also associated with elevated cardiovas-
cular risk factors such as high blood pressure [9], a higher rate
of cardiovascular disease [10(cid:129)] and with premature mortality
[11–14].

Current Treatment Approaches

Anxiety disorders are typically treated using pharmacological
agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or ben-
zodiazepines [15, 16], cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
[17] or a combination of both [18]. These traditional ap-
proaches can be effective in reducing anxiety disorder symp-
toms, but up to one-third of patients do not respond to treat-
ment [19, 20] which can lead to treatment dropout, poorer
outcomes and functioning [21]. To address this issue, multi-
modal approaches that combine pharmacotherapy with forms
of CBT have been developed, but have yet to produce any
discernible improvements in efficacy [18, 22]. A number of
practical (e.g. availability of therapists) and financial barriers
also exist to the effective delivery of these types of therapy
[23], particularly in low- and middle-income countries [24(cid:129),
25(cid:129)]. This greatly limits the universal availability for these
types of therapy across all population groups.

Treatment Gap: the Need for Interventions
to Improve Physical Health

Beyond treating the symptoms of anxiety disorders, it is also
unclear to what extent traditional approaches are able to

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2018) 20: 63

manage wider issues of physical comorbidity, which is com-
mon in people with anxiety disorders [26]. For example, peo-
ple with anxiety disorder are 52% more likely to develop a
cardiovascular disease than the general population [10(].
Given that the physical health problems associated with anx-
iety disorders and comorbidities, and not directly caused by
anxiety, improving the poor physical health, outcomes associ-
ated with anxiety disorders cannot be achieved using pharma-
cotherapy or CBT alone. While it is essential that interventions
are offered to reduce the mental health symptoms, it is also
essential that interventions are developed to prevent the onset
and manage physical health problems in people with anxiety
disorders [27].

Potential for Physical Activity

Physical activity (PA)-based interventions represent a novel
approach that have demonstrated efficacy in treating symp-
toms of several mental health conditions ranging from psy-
chosis (e.g. [28, 29]) to dementia (e.g. [30]). It is worth noting
that the broader concept of PA can be distinguished from
physical exercise, which refers to a form of PA that is struc-
tured to improve physical fitness [31]. In this paper, PA will be
used to refer to both incidental activity (e.g. walking to the
shops) and physical exercise (e.g. walking on a treadmill at the
gym), given that there is a lack of discernible empirical evi-
dence that the anxiolytic benefits of activity are dependent on
fitness changes [32(cid:129)(cid:129)]. However, the vast majority of empiri-
cal research in the field have used exercise-based interventions
specifically.

Most notably, exercise-based interventions have been con-
sistently demonstrated as having an antidepressant effect in
people with depression [33, 34], with some studies reporting
a treatment efficacy comparable to antidepressant medications
or psychotherapy [35–37]. In such mental health conditions,
PA has been shown to have wider benefits to peoples’
wellbeing, including an improved quality of life, less psycho-
logical distress and, importantly, improved physical health
[28, 29, 38–43]. In addition to having few adverse side effects,
PA may have further benefits for daily functioning as research
has found exercise training to produce improved
neurocognitive performances in people with mental health
conditions such as schizophrenia or depression [44, 45].

Recent work suggests that PA may also be beneficial for
the treatment of anxiety disorders [46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Given the potential
for PA to improve physical as well as mental health, PA-based
interventions may be an important trans-diagnostic tool with
an array of broader benefits to people with anxiety disorders.
The following sections will provide a brief overview of the
evidence supporting PA as a treatment for anxiety disorders
and outline several gaps in the literature to be addressed.

Physical Activity and Anxiety: Current
Evidence

Several studies of the general population have found that peo-
ple who engage in more PA have a reduced risk of being
diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and less frequent and se-
vere anxiety symptoms [47–52]. Conversely, physical inactiv-
ity has been identified as a risk factor for the development of
anxiety [53] as well as for other conditions such as depression
[54–56]. This evidence suggests that engagement in PA ap-
pears to be protective for anxiety symptoms and disorders in
the general population.

Despite the strong basis of evidence for its effectiveness in
treating depression [33] and the commonality of anxiety dis-
orders co-occurring with depression [57, 58], there has been
comparatively little work on the use of PA to treat anxiety
disorders. Nonetheless, recent reviews have found PAs, typi-
cally exercise-based interventions, are effective as standalone
or adjunctive therapies for reducing anxiety symptoms, with
effect sizes ranging from small to moderate in people with
[32(cid:129)(cid:129), 46(cid:129)(cid:129), 59–61] and without [32(cid:129)(cid:129), 62–65] a diagnosed
anxiety disorder. Exercise-based interventions have been
shown to reduce symptoms in trauma and stress-related disor-
ders such as in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) [66]. Even acute bouts of exercise have been shown
to have a small, positive effect on reducing symptoms of state
anxiety [67]. An innovative recent study found that aerobic
exercise in addition to cognitive behavioural therapy im-
proved symptoms in people with panic disorder and agora-
phobia, possibly acting through the “breathing hypotheses”
[68]. PA-based interventions have also been found to reduce
anxiety symptoms in patients with chronic physical health
conditions [69]. Of note, the majority of these studies have
used aerobic exercise, and as a result, little is known about the
mental health benefits of resistance training [70]. However, a
recent review suggests that resistance training has a small-
moderate impact on reducing anxiety symptoms in clinical
and non-clinical populations [71(cid:129)].

The available evidence strongly suggests that PA interven-
tions have a broadly reductive effect on anxiety symptoms
across clinical and non-clinical population groups. The low-
cost, low-risk nature of PA means that such interventions
could be a useful treatment option for anxiety. Its antidepres-
sant properties also allow for PA to be used as a trans-
diagnostic treatment for people with a co-morbid affective
disorder.

Given the elevated physical health risks associated with
anxiety disorders [9], its capacity to reduce cardiovascular
risks is amongst the most important aspects of PA in the treat-
ment of anxiety disorders. However, studies of PA-based in-
terventions in anxiety disorders rarely record physical health
outcomes [32(cid:129)(cid:129)], and little work has been conducted to direct-
ly assess the capacity for PA to reduce physical health risks in

people with anxiety disorders. Future research should seek to
address these shortcomings by developing RCTs which mea-
sure both the physical and mental health outcomes associated
with PA-based interventions in people with anxiety disorders.
This is a relatively novel area of research compared to more
established approaches such as psychotherapy. There are also
fewer financial resources available for this type of research
relative to that of mainstream pharmacotherapy. As a result,
more high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are still
required to address certain gaps in the literature to facilitate the
most effective and appropriate use of PA in the treatment of
anxiety. The following sections will highlight some key gaps
in the literature that should be addressed by future research.

Mechanisms of Action

PA may act through a range of different physiological and
psychological mechanisms, but the precise mechanism by
which PA reduces anxiety is less clear. Potential mechanisms
could include the role of PA plays in the regulation of stress
responses through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis or glucocorticoids circulation [72, 73]. PA also stimulates
a broad range of neurogenic processes important for proper
brain functioning, such as up-regulating growth factors like
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and stimulating
neurogenesis and angiogenesis [74, 75]. By promoting the
functioning of brain regions that have particular relevance to
anxiety or stress-related conditions, PA could help to reduce
symptoms of anxiety. For example, the hippocampus is a re-
gion intrinsic to regulating feedback of stress responses from
the HPA [76, 77] and may be impaired in people with PTSD
[78, 79]. PA has a particularly potent impact on improving
hippocampal functioning [75], which may support stress re-
sponse regulation and reduce PTSD symptoms. Moreover, a
recent meta-analysis of human RCTs demonstrated that exer-
cise may improve left hippocampal volume in particular [80].
Another possible mechanism through which PA may im-
prove symptoms is the potential to influence the inflammatory
system, which has been implicated in the aetiology and sever-
ity of symptoms in anxiety disorders. Specifically, anxiety
disorders are associated with elevated levels of the pro-
inflammatory cytokine C-reactive protein (CRP), which can
cause chronic inflammation and contribute towards the disor-
der development [81]. Prolonged HPA dysfunction can also
impair anti-inflammatory responses to glucocorticoids, caus-
ing further inflammation [82]. PA is known to have anti-
inflammatory properties and may exert a positive impact on
treating anxiety disorders by mediating inflammatory path-
ways [83]. Other recent evidence suggests that PA may also
operate through the endocannabinoid system. For example,
PA h a s b e e n s h o w n t o u p - r e g u l a t e c i r c u l a t i n g
endocannabinoids such as anandamide, which can produce

63 Page 4 of 9

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2018) 20: 63

anxiolytic effects by regulating other neurotransmitters, such
as dopamine [84]. Other systems such as the monoamine or
endogenous opioid system have also been suggested but a
comprehensive overview of all the potential physiological
mechanisms of PA is beyond the scope of the current paper
and has been covered in other reviews (e.g. [72, 73]).

PA may also reduce symptoms of anxiety through psycho-
logical mechanisms, such as anxiety sensitivity. Several stud-
ies have found PA to reduce anxiety sensitivity by reliably
producing similar physiological responses as experienced
with high anxious states, such as increased heart rate, but
without the negative, anxious feelings that people with anxiety
disorders have grown to associate with such physiological
arousal [85, 86]. By encouraging people to associate these
physiological experiences with pleasant enjoyable or non-
threatening experiences, it may help to reduce the anticipated
dread of these somatic symptoms and increase the tolerance
and management of them [85, 86].

The concept of habituating people to anxiety symptoms is
also a potential mechanism through which CBT may take its
effect [87]. Similarly, PA may promote self-efficacy for coping
with anxiety through producing mastery experiences [88].
Poor self-beliefs such as efficacy and self-esteem can be expe-
rienced as part of anxiety disorders, so feelings of achievement
and mastery through PA can help to enhance positive self-
beliefs and buffer from negative self-perception worries [89].
It is currently unclear as to which physiological and psy-
chological mechanisms PA produces an anxiolytic effect.
Future research should focus on investigating the factors
through which PA reduces anxiety symptoms as this may have
direct implications for how interventions are designed. For
example, should research demonstrate that neurogenic pro-
cesses play a key role in PA producing anxiolytic effects, the
minimum length of an intervention may be influenced by the
time in which these processes take to impact brain function. A
clearer understanding of these mechanisms may also provide
the opportunity to elicit a stronger treatment effect by combin-
ing PA with other types of therapy which operate through
overlapping, or complementary pathways [90].

Furthering our understanding as to exactly how PA interacts
with anxiety symptoms may help to inform PA-based interven-
tions that are customised to a patient’s biological, psychological
or symptom profile. As well as improving the design of PA
interventions, this research would also contribute towards our
understanding of the aetiology of anxiety. Such findings could
be used to develop more targeted pharmacotherapies or public
health strategies to prevent anxiety disorders.

Optimal Physical Activity Protocols

There is currently a lack of clarity over the frequency, inten-
sity, duration and type of PA parameters that most effectively

reduce anxiety symptoms. For example, there is a distinct lack
of RCTs comparing the additive or interactive impacts of aer-
obic and resistance activity on anxiety symptoms within the
same study [70]. This has led to a lack of clarity over whether
aerobic or resistance exercises have divergent effects on anx-
iety symptoms. There is some recent RCT evidence to suggest
that the impact of aerobic and resistance exercises may differ
as to which symptoms and underlying constructs of anxiety
disorders they affect [91, 92(cid:129)]. For example, LeBouthillier and
colleagues [92(cid:129)] demonstrated that while both exercise modal-
ities were efficacious in improving disorder status, only aero-
bic exercise improved general psychological distress and anx-
iety, while only resistance training improved anxiety sensitiv-
ity, distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty.

However, another study comparing acute bouts of aerobic
and resistance exercise found them to have a significant, but
equivocal impact on reducing anxiety sensitivity and no other
anxiety constructs [91]. An earlier study reported that resis-
tance exercise elicited notably greater reductions in signs and
symptoms of GAD, than aerobic exercise [93]. In addition to
these mixed findings, drawing any firm conclusions from the
available literature is further complicated by the scarcity of
studies that sufficiently match aerobic and resistance exercise
protocols on active features of the exercise stimulus (e.g. time
actively engaged in exercise, work completed during exercise
sessions, and progression in load) to facilitate a more rigorous
exercise [71(cid:129)].

Along with the comparative efficacy of aerobic and resis-
tance activity, other aspects of PA have been equally
understudied in terms of their relative efficacy such as sport
vs. leisure-time activity or individual vs. group-based exer-
cise. To provide clarity, RCTs using robust and consistent
methodologies could be used to establish the relative effec-
tiveness and differences between types of PA.

Further to this, establishing a dose-response relationship
between the frequency or intensity of PA with anxiolytic ef-
fects represents another important goal for future research.
Determining the most beneficial types of activity for people
with anxiety disorders is challenging, as these and likely idi-
osyncratic processes, unique to each person [94] and specific
details on the PA protocols used in studies, are not consistently
reported [32(cid:129)(cid:129), 71(cid:129), 95]. Moreover, there is a lack of variability
in the intensity or frequency of PA used across studies of
anxieties making it difficult to establish differences in efficacy
between them [46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. A small study (N = 18) tested a dose-
response relationship by comparing the anxiolytic impact of
varying intensity exercise and demonstrated that there were
less panic reactions to CO2 in patients that performed
moderate-to-vigorous intensity in contrast to those who per-
formed very light intensity activity [96]. However, the study is
likely to be underpowered and is not designed for causal in-
ferences. More research is needed to test the replicability and
generalizability of these findings.

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2018) 20: 63

Page 5 of 9 63

Robust RCTs that manipulate and compare different inten-
sities, frequencies or durations of PA on anxiety symptoms are
required to elucidate a dose-response relationship [32(cid:129)(cid:129)].
Understanding this relationship will facilitate the development
of PA-based interventions that are tailored to the treatment of
anxiety symptoms, instead of having to rely on public health
guidelines designed for physical health such as the American
College of Sports Medicine [97].

Research into the effectiveness of PA at reducing anxiety
symptoms has accumulated a strong evidence base, but more
work is needed to identify methods of understanding and pro-
moting adherence to interventions. This also includes the de-
velopment of novel platforms to increase enjoyment of PA as
a mechanism for maintaining higher adherence. A recent ex-
ample of this is exergaming, which refers to the integration of
action video games with PA and is being developed for people
with schizophrenia [102].

Adherence to Interventions

In addition to maximising efficacy research, establishing PA
protocols tailored to mental health treatment may be useful in
promoting adherence to interventions (i.e. effectiveness re-
search). Dropout rates are traditionally high for PA-based in-
terventions in populations with mental health issues [98(cid:129), 99(cid:129)].
RCTs that focus on determining the most engaging and effec-
tive PA protocol may help to increase adherence to an extent.
For example, determining the minimum frequency or intensity
of PA required to effectively reduce symptoms may be more
acceptable amongst people who may exhibit symptoms that
impair motivation [100].

Moreover, research is required to delineate the most signif-
icant factors that mediate adherence to PA interventions in
people with anxiety disorders, such as intrinsic motivation.
Research in people with serious mental illness has emphasised
the importance of enhancing self-determined motivation
through providing autonomy, competence and relatedness
through PA [101(cid:129)]. Previous research in people with depres-
sion and schizophrenia have also identified the inclusion of a
credible, appropriately qualified fitness professional leading
the intervention, as another mediator of adherence [98(cid:129), 99(cid:129)].
Future research should consider using theory-based mixed
methods to investigate mediating factors that may be specific
to individuals with anxiety disorders and can inform the de-
velopment of interventions that are more engaging and accept-
able to participants. It would also be beneficial for this re-
search to focus more broadly on developing constructive
frameworks through which PA-based interventions can be
prescribed in mental health settings. This would help to reduce
the practical barriers to implementation and increase the avail-
ability of PA-based therapy to people with anxiety disorders.
While this paper has predominantly been indiscriminate in
discussing anxiety disorders, there may be differences be-
tween how people with different types of anxiety disorders
engage with PA. For example, people with social anxiety dis-
orders may be more reluctant to attend PA interventions that
are delivered in group settings than those whose anxiety is not
derived from social situations to the same extent. There is a
lack of RCTs comparing the response of people with different
types of anxiety disorders to PA [32(cid:129)(cid:129)] or in the impact of
related psychiatric problems (e.g. substance misuse).

Physical Fitness and Anxiety Disorders

The relationship between physical fitness and anxiety is also
unclear. Few studies have sufficiently accounted for baseline
physical fitness or changes in physical fitness in their analysis
[32(cid:129)(cid:129), 46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. This is problematic as it has led to an uncertainty
over the necessity for physical fitness to change for a PA-
based intervention to be effective. Some evidence suggests
that PA-based interventions have been effective in reducing
anxiety symptoms without any changes in physical fitness
[32(cid:129)(cid:129)]. It is also unclear whether baseline physical fitness is
a mediating factor between PA and anxiety symptoms. Two
studies have found that participants with lower levels of car-
diorespiratory fitness show the greatest improvements in
symptoms of anxiety [92(cid:129), 103(cid:129)]. Differentiating the anxiolyt-
ic effects of PA independent of the role of physical fitness will
be essential to inform how PA should be administered
amongst different groups and how to tailor the focus of such
efforts. For example, it is possible that standalone PA inter-
ventions with a focus on fitness-enhancing exercise may be
best suited for populations with low base levels of physical
fitness, but as an adjunction for people with higher levels of
physical fitness.

Measuring changes in physical fitness will also be impor-
tant in determining whether PA-based interventions can re-
duce the physical health risks associated with anxiety disor-
ders. There is a notable lack of research that directly assesses
the impact of PA on the physical health of people with anxiety
disorders [46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. The elevated risk of cardiovascular disease,
high blood pressure and premature mortality in people with
anxiety disorders [9, 10(cid:129), 12, 13] is representative of a wider
problem in mental health. Mental illness is broadly associated
with poorer physical health outcomes; the severity of which is
epitomised by a 15- to 20-year mortality gap between individ-
uals with serious mental illness and the general population
[104(cid:129)(cid:129), 105, 106]. Factors such as physical inactivity represent
a significant, but modifiable cardiovascular risk factor that is
widespread in people with mental health problems [107], in-
cluding anxiety disorders [25(cid:129), 53]. Research in people with
serious mental illness has shown PA-based interventions can
improve physical health [28, 43] and may have a similar effect
in people with anxiety disorders.

63 Page 6 of 9

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2018) 20: 63

Including objective measures of physical fitness such as
VO2 max tests, as well as indicators of physical health such
as cardiovascular or pulmonary assessments at pre- and post-
intervention time points, would help to determine whether PA
can improve physical health in people with anxiety disorders.
It would also be beneficial for high-quality RCTs to be con-
ducted that directly assess the impact of PA-based interven-
tions on the physical health of people with anxiety disorders as
a primary outcome measure. Such research is important for the
wellbeing of those with anxiety disorders, but would also help
to address the stark health inequalities associated with mental
illness more broadly, which appears to be worsening [104(cid:129)(cid:129)].

Conclusion

There is a growing basis of evidence to suggest that PA is
associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety in the general
population and can be used to treat symptoms of anxiety in
those with anxiety disorders. Moreover, PA may have further
benefits to physical health and wellbeing. However, despite
the physical health burden in people with anxiety disorders,
relatively, little is known about the benefits of PA on physical
health and cardiovascular disease in this population. The un-
derlying mechanisms for the effects of PA on anxiety symp-
toms have not been elucidated. Similarly, research assessing
the optimal PA protocols for reducing symptoms or on pro-
moting adherence to PA have been lacking. Addressing these
gaps in the literature will be important in developing effica-
cious and implementable PA-based interventions.

It will also be necessary to establish where PA would be
best integrated into the current service model. One option
would be to take a step-wise approach by including lifestyle
approaches such as PA as an early intervention to treat mild
symptoms of anxiety, precluding the use of CBT or pharma-
cotherapy [108(cid:129)(cid:129)]. The wider benefits of PA to patient
wellbeing, and particularly to physical health, may also justify
the inclusion of PA as an adjunction to treatment for cases
where symptoms are moderate or severe.

Furthermore, population-level data demonstrates that the
relationship between PA and anxiety extends to non-clinical
groups, suggesting that promoting PA could be used as a uni-
versal approach for the primary prevention of anxiety [25(cid:129)].
Promoting PA has already been suggested as a promising pre-
ventative strategy for other mental health conditions such as
depression [109] and may represent a cost-effective and prac-
tical method of reducing the prevalence of anxiety and
anxiety-related disorders. However, more research in non-
clinical population groups would be needed to confirm this.

More RCTs must be conducted to establish the most
effective PA intervention design and method of delivery
for reducing anxiety symptoms and promoting adherence
and physical health.
