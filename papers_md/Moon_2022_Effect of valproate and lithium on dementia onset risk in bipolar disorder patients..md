on dementia onset risk in bipolar 
disorder patients

Although valproate and lithium are most commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder patients, studies 
comparing their effects on the risk of dementia are limited. Choosing a safer mood stabilizer is 
clinically crucial as elderly bipolar disorder patients are at high risk of dementia onset. Therefore, we 
aim to evaluate and compare the effects of valproate and lithium on the risk of dementia in elderly 
bipolar disorder patients. This study involved 4784 bipolar disorder patients aged 50 years or older 
from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. We estimated the risk 
of dementia in valproate-only users, lithium-only users, and both users compared to both medication 
non-users using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Compared to non-users, valproate-
only users and both users showed a higher risk of dementia (59% and 62%, respectively). In sub-group 
analysis, valproate increased the dementia risk when prescribed for at least 59 days or 23 cumulative 
defined daily doses. However, the dementia risk associated with lithium is unclear. Therefore, we 
concluded that lithium has the potential to be the safer choice as a mood stabilizer over valproate for 
elderly bipolar disorder patients considering the risk of dementia.

Older adults aged 60 years and over account for 25% of all bipolar disorder  patients1. As affective temperament 
in bipolar disorder patients is associated with lifetime suicide attempts or risky bereavement, continuous lifetime 
monitoring and treatment are necessary for old age  patients2,3. Bipolar disorder is associated with an increased 
risk of dementia due to various factors, including treatment using psychiatric  medications4–6. As valproate 
and lithium are the most frequently prescribed medications for bipolar disorder in older  adults7, estimation of 
dementia onset risk associated with valproate or lithium is clinically crucial.

In preclinical studies, lithium was found to induce proliferation and specification of neurons by inhibiting 
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3β)8–12 while the effects of valproate on neurons are  controversial13–15. Stud-
ies that directly investigated the causal effects of valproate and lithium on the risk of dementia in patients with 
bipolar disorder are very limited and subjected to methodological  limitations16,17. A population-based retro-
spective cohort study from Taiwan reported that valproate increased the risk of dementia in bipolar disorder 
 patients18. Two population-based, retrospective cohort studies from Denmark and the United States reported that 
lithium reduced the risk of dementia in bipolar disorder  patients16,17. Although aforementioned studies adjusted 
 anticonvulsant16,17 or mood  stabilizer16,18 treatment, none of those excluded valproate-treated patients from their 
lithium-nontreated control  groups16,17 and vice  versa18. These results, therefore, do not necessarily indicate that 
valproate or lithium may change the risk of dementia in patients with bipolar disorder, but may simply indicate 
that the risk of dementia may be different between valproate-treated and lithium-treated bipolar disorder patients. 
In addition, none of these studies directly compared the risk of dementia between valproate users and lithium 
users with common matched non-users. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether it is valproate or lithium that 
is less or more associated with the risk of dementia in bipolar patients.

In this context, we hypothesized that lithium would be less associated with risk of dementia onset than val-
proate for older age bipolar disorder patients. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the risk of dementia onset 
in patients who were prescribed valproate only (VALP), lithium only (LITH), or both valproate and lithium

trolling for potential confounding factors. In this study, we used Korean national health insurance claim data of 
bipolar disorder patients aged 50 years or older.

Results
Characteristics  of  the  participants.  The  study  cohort  comprised  of  1164  VALP  group  patients,  621 
LITH  group  patients,  621  BOTH  group  patients,  and  2378  NONE  group  patients.  Figure  1  summarizes  the 
cohort assembly process. The mean follow-up durations in all four groups were over 6.6 years. As summarized 
in Table 1, the average age of each group was around 58 years old, and females were more dominant in all groups. 
Most  covariates  were  well  balanced  between  four  groups,  with  some  exceptions  in  nonusers.  Nonusers  have 
more  coronary  artery  disorder,  depressive  disorder  and  use  more  medications  (Selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitor  (SSRI),  Serotonin  and  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRI),  Tricyclic  antidepressants  (TCA), 
benzodiazepine, anti-inflammatory agents, narcotics, H2 receptor antagonist, statin, platelet aggregation inhibi-
tor, antihypertensive, and flourquinolones) than medication users. As we matched the use of antipsychotics, the 
prescription rates of antipsychotics did not differ significantly between the four groups. Table 1 shows detailed 
demographic and clinical characteristics of the four groups.

Hazard ratio analysis for dementia onset. 
In order to select covariates for adjustment, we ran uni-
variable Cox proportional hazard analysis for the factors listed Table 1. As a result, diabetes (HR 1.43, 95% CI 
1.03–1.99), alcohol-related disorder (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.13–3.48) and use of antiepileptics (HR 1.42, 95% CI 
1.05–1.93) were selected as covariates that should be adjusted in the analysis on the associations of valproate 
and/or lithium with the risk of dementia (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, the VALP group (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.23–1.97) and the 
BOTH group (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23–2.13) but not LITH group (HR 1.24, CI 0.92–1.67) were at higher risk of

dementia compared to the NONE group (Table 2). In sensitivity analysis which defines dementia cases not only 
by disease code but also by the prescription of cognitive enhancers (donepezil, memantine, rivastigmine and 
galantamine) for at least 7 days, we found similar results. The VALP group (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.22–2.37) and the 
BOTH group (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.02–2.23) but not LITH group (HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.96–2.14) were at higher risk 
of dementia compared to the NONE group (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

Dose–response analysis.  We analyzed the risk of dementia according to the cumulative defined daily dose 
(DDD), cumulative prescription duration (CPD) (Table 3). In the VALP group, the risk of dementia was signifi-
cantly higher in the middle and high DDD (middle DDD group: HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.34–2.89; high DDD group: 
HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.12–2.27) or middle and long CPD groups (middle CPD group: HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.45–3.07; 
long CPD group: HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13–2.26) but not in the low DDD (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.84–1.87) or short CPD 
group (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76–1.74) compared to the NONE group. However, exposure to lithium did not show 
statistically significant association with dementia risk in any tertile group by DDD or CPD (Table 3).

Discussion
To the extent of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study that directly compares the risk of dementia between 
valproate users, lithium users, and both users compared with the matched non-user controls among elderly 
patients with bipolar disorder. We found that patients who were prescribed only valproate or both valproate and 
lithium showed a 56% or 62% increased risk of dementia, respectively than those who were not prescribed both 
medications. However, lithium-only users did not show a significant increase in the risk of dementia. Our result 
indicates that lithium has the potential to be a relatively safer choice than valproate when considering the risk of 
dementia in elderly bipolar disorder patients. Given the risk of valproate-associated dementia, we recommend 
regularly monitoring cognitive function in elderly bipolar disorder patients using valproate.

The results of this study support the dementia onset risk associated with valproate shown in previous studies. 
In previous studies, valproate reduced cell proliferation at therapeutic plasma  levels19 and impaired cognitive 
function in bipolar disorder  patients20. Prior to this study, only one study from Taiwan used real-world patient 
data to investigate the effect of valproate on the risk of dementia in older patients with bipolar disorder at popula-
tion level. The Taiwanese study reported that valproate-treated patients had a 73% higher risk of dementia than 
valproate-untreated  patients18, which is consistent with the findings of the current study. In addition, the current 
study further discovered that the risk of dementia increased significantly when valproate was prescribed for at 
least about two months or 23 DDD. To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the dose–response 
relationship between valproate prescription and the risk of dementia in bipolar disorder patients. Our finding 
indicates that regular monitoring of cognitive function would be helpful for older aged bipolar patients prescribed 
valproate for approximately two months or longer.

Unlike valproate, based on our result, it is unclear whether lithium increases the risk of dementia or not. 
However, our finding does not support the lithium’s protective effect against dementia which was found in some 
previous studies. Prior to this research, two retrospective, population-based cohort studies using health insurance 
claims data from Denmark and the United States had investigated the effects of lithium on the risk of dementia in 
bipolar  patients16,17. More than four prescriptions of lithium reduced the risk of dementia in the Danish  study16,

Table 3.   Risk of dementia in valproate only users and lithium only users compared to nonusers according 
to the cumulative dose and days of prescription. *Hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals compared 
to the nonusers (number = 2378, event = 185). † Adjusted for diabetes, alcohol related disorder, and use of 
antiepileptics. † DDD = defined daily dose, 1 DDD = 1.5 g for valproate, 24 mmol for lithium.

and prescriptions of lithium for 10–12 months reduced the risk of dementia in the U.S.  study17. Unlike current 
study, the U.S. or Danish study did not exclude valproate users from non-user control group. Valproate was found 
to increase the risk of dementia in both the current study and the aforementioned Taiwanese  study18. Therefore, 
to precisely estimate the effect of lithium on dementia, valproate users should be excluded or at least matched 
between lithium users and non-users. Other studies reported mixed results regarding the effects of lithium on 
human cognitive function. In randomized controlled trials on patients with mild cognitive  impairment21,22 or 
Alzheimer’s  disease23 without affective disorders, sub-therapeutic treatment with lithium (serum levels below 
0.5 mEq/L) for one to three years improved cognitive  performance21,22, delayed cognitive  decline23, increased 
amyloid-beta  peptide22 and decreased phosphorylated  tau21 in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, in a population-
based, nested case–control study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program, lithium treat-
ment was not associated with the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in bipolar  patients24. A meta-analysis of six studies 
(two case–control studies and four pre-post comparison studies) reported that therapeutic lithium treatment 
(serum level: 0.7–1.2 mEq/L) for approximately four years impaired immediate verbal learning, memory, and 
psychomotor performance of affective disorder patients, and long-term lithium treatment was associated with 
greater impairment in psychomotor  performance25. Combining the results of current and past studies, more 
long-term, real-world data is required to clarify the effect of lithium on the onset of dementia in clinical settings.
Nevertheless, the results of our study suggest that lithium would be a safer option compared to valproate 
regarding the risk of dementia in elderly bipolar disorder patients. Considering that bipolar patients are predis-
posed to developing  dementia4–6, our findings provide meaningful information to support the clinical choice of 
mood stabilizers for elderly patients.

There are several limitations to be considered. As we use bipolar disorder patients who have not been pre-
scribed both valproate and lithium as the reference group, cofounding by indication should be considered as 
limitation. The major concern regarding confounding by indication is the difference in bipolar disorder severity 
between non-user controls and valproate or lithium users. One could argue that the higher risk of dementia in 
the VALP group could be biased from greater bipolar disorder severity in the VALP group than NONE group. 
However, such difference in disease severity could also exist between the NONE and LITH group. Nevertheless, 
the LITH group did not show increased risk of dementia in current study. Such differences in dementia risk

tion. In addition, to alleviate confounding by indication, we balanced the clinical characteristics between groups 
by matching age, sex, index year, and health insurance type and the use of antipsychotics, as they are frequently 
prescribed for bipolar disorder along with valproate or  lithium16,26–28. Even still, the unadjusted effect of disease 
severity could have remained. Therefore, we expect further investigation overcoming such intrinsic limitations 
of claim data. This study analyzed national insurance claim data from Health Insurance Review and Assessment 
Service (HIRA). HIRA data provides valuable information based on real-world, but it also has several limita-
tions. First, key risk factors of dementia, such as the level of education and apolipoprotein E genotype were not 
controlled as they were not available in the HIRA data. Second, the record of dementia code in claim data does 
not necessarily indicate clinical diagnosis of dementia. Notably, we could not specify the specialty of a physician 
who made the diagnosis due to the limitation of data availability. To ensure the validity of diagnosis, we con-
ducted sensitivity analysis which defines dementia cases not only by disease code but also by the prescription of 
cognitive enhancers for at least 7 days, and found consistent results (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Third, due to 
concerns regarding the accuracy of medical records of dementia subtypes, we analyzed the effects of valproate and 
lithium on all-cause dementia. Finally, although we ensured that there was at least a one-year wash-out period for 
valproate and lithium, lifetime exposure to lithium and valproate might have also influenced the risk of dementia.
In conclusion, our study found that prolonged use of valproate could increase the risk of dementia, whereas 
the risk associated with lithium is unclear in elderly bipolar patients. Regarding the susceptibility to the onset 
of dementia in bipolar disorder patients, lithium has the potential to be a safer choice than valproate as a mood 
stabilizer in elderly patients. In the case prescription of valproate is unavoidable, regular monitoring of cognitive 
function is necessary for the timely detection of cognitive decline.

Methods
Data source and study cohort.  We obtained the dataset from the Korean HIRA database between Janu-
ary 1, 2007 and August 31, 2018. The HIRA database comprises of ~ 59 million individuals and is representative 
of  almost  all  Koreans  insured  by  the  National  Health  Insurance  and  National  Medicaid. The  HIRA  database 
contains data on patient demographics, diagnosis codes, prescription records, medical procedures and services, 
types of health care institutions, medication utilization, and admission dates.

From the HIRA database, we identified 116,737 registrants who were 50 years or older and had either at least 
one inpatient claim or at least two outpatient claims with ICD-10 codes of bipolar spectrum disorders (F30, F31, 
and F34.0) as their primary or secondary diagnosis between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2013.

Among them, we identified patients who received at least one prescription for valproate between January 1, 
2007, and August 31, 2018, but did not receive lithium as valproate only users and vice versa for lithium only 
users (N = 31,973 for VALP group, N = 9.407 for LITH group). We also found patients who prescribed both 
valproate and lithium at least one time for each between January 1, 2007, and August 31, 2018 (N = 17,692 for 
BOTH group).

From these patients, we excluded individuals who: (1) were prescribed valproate and/or lithium before obtain-
ing a diagnosis code for bipolar spectrum disorder; (2) had a diagnosis code for psychotic disorders, dementia, 
cerebrovascular disorder, Parkinson disorder, epilepsy, or traumatic head injury as the primary diagnosis before 
being prescribed valproate and/or lithium; or (3) were prescribed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine 
before being prescribed valproate and/or lithium. We further excluded individuals who were prescribed valproate 
and/or lithium between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007 to ensure that there was at least a one-year 
wash-out period in patients who were prescribed valproate or lithium before 2008. As we have data until august 
31, 2018, in order to secure at least 5-year follow up data, we excluded patients who first prescribed valproate or 
lithium after august 31, 2013. (Fig. 1).

After that, we matched age, sex, index year, and health insurance type between VALP group, LITH group, 
BOTH group, and patients who were never prescribed valproate or lithium between Jan 1, 2017, to Aug 31, 2018, 
as reference group (NONE group). In order to minimize the confounding by indication, we also matched the 
use of antipsychotics between four groups. Finally, 1164 VALP group, 621 LITH group, 621 BOTH group and 
2378 NONE group patients are included in the analysis.

We defined the index date as the first day of valproate or lithium prescription after the diagnosis of bipolar 
spectrum disorder in the VALP, LITH, and BOTH groups. In the NONE group, we defined the index date by 
adding the interval between the date of bipolar disorder diagnosis and the index date of the matched VALP, LITH, 
and BOTH groups to the date of bipolar disorder diagnosis of the NONE group (Fig. 2).

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital 
(IRB no. X-1906-546-901), and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration 
of Helsinki. Informed consents were waived from the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University 
Bundang Hospital due to the retrospective design.

Exposures.  Exposure to valproate (ATC; N03AG01) or lithium (ATC; N05AN01) was evaluated between 
the index date and the last day of follow-up. To assess dose–response relationship, we calculated DDD, CPD of 
valproate and lithium in days. When calculating DDD, we adapted the widely used drug standardization method 
developed by the World Health  Organization21. We divided the level of exposure into tertiles of cumulative DDD 
and CPD.

Outcome.  The outcome of the study was the incident diagnosis of dementia. We defined incident dementia 
as having at least one inpatient claim or at least two outpatient claims with ICD-10 codes of dementia (F00, 
F01, F02, F03, G30, G31.0, G31.8, or G31.9) as the primary diagnosis at least one year after the index date. We

did not include the patients whose dementia diagnosis code occurred within a year from index date as incident 
dementia to avoid protopathic bias due to preexisting undiagnosed dementia and to address disease latency for 
drug-induced dementia. We followed the patients from the index date until one of the following conditions were 
met: (1) the diagnosis of dementia; (2) the patient was excluded from the HIRA database due to reasons includ-
ing death; or (3) the date of August 31, 2018.

Confounding  factors.  We  defined  the  following  factors  as  potential  confounders:  (1)  the  existence  of 
comorbidities, evaluated as having at least one inpatient or at least two outpatient ICD-10 codes of comorbidi-
ties (Table 1) before the index date; and (2) the use of prescribed comedications (Table 1) for at least one week 
before the index date. Using the comorbidities, we estimated the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)  score29.

Statistical analyses.  We compared the risk of dementia in the VALP, LITH, and BOTH groups to that of 
the NONE group using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. In this analysis, we adjusted the results 
for confounding factors that showed a significant association with the risk of dementia in the univariable Cox 
proportional hazard models (eTable 1 in the supplement).

We subsequently categorized the DDD and CPD of valproate and lithium into tertiles, estimated the risk of 
dementia in each tertile using the multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, and adjusted the results for 
the aforementioned confounding factors.

We also performed similar analyses after modifying the definition of incident dementia as the patients with 
dementia code in primary code and prescription of cognitive enhancer for 7 days or longer. All statistical analyses 
were performed using SAS Enterprise 7.1 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and regarded two-
tailed p values below 0.05 as statistically significant.

Ethics declarations.  This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National Uni-
versity  Bundang  Hospital  (IRB  no.  X-1906-546-901),  and  conformed  to  the  ethical  guidelines  of  the  World
