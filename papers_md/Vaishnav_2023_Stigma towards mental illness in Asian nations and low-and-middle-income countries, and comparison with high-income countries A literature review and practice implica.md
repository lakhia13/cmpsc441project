ABSTRACT

Background: Stigma related to mental illness (and its treatment) is prevalent worldwide. This stigma could be at the 
structural or organizational level, societal level (interpersonal stigma), and the individual level (internalized stigma). 
Vulnerable populations, for example, gender minorities, children, adolescents, and geriatric populations, are more prone 
to stigma. The magnitude of stigma and its negative influence is determined by socio-cultural factors and macro (mental 
health policies, programs) or micro-level factors (societal views, health sectors, or individuals’ attitudes towards mentally 
ill persons). Mental health stigma is associated with more serious psychological problems among the victims, reduced 
access to mental health care, poor adherence to treatment, and unfavorable outcomes. Although various nationwide and 
well-established anti-stigma interventions/campaigns exist in high-income countries (HICs) with favorable outcomes, 
a  comprehensive  synthesis  of  literature  from  the  Low-  and  Middle-Income  Countries  (LMICs),  more  so  from  the 
Asian continent is lacking. The lack of such literature impedes growth in stigma-related research, including developing 
anti-stigma interventions.
Aim: To synthesize the available mental health stigma literature from Asia and LMICs and compare them on the mental 
health stigma, anti-stigma interventions, and the effectiveness of such interventions from HICs.
Materials  and  Methods:  PubMed  and  Google  Scholar  databases  were  screened  using  the  following  search  terms: 
stigma, prejudice, discrimination, stereotype, perceived stigma, associate stigma (for Stigma), mental health, mental 
illness, mental disorder psychiatric* (for mental health), and low-and-middle-income countries, LMICs, High-income 
countries, and Asia, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation/SAARC (for countries of interest). Bibliographic 
and grey literature were also performed to obtain the relevant records.
Results: The anti-stigma interventions in Asia nations and LMICs are generalized (vs. disorder specific), population-based 
(vs.  specific  groups,  such  as  patients,  caregivers,  and  health  professionals),  mostly  educative  (vs.  contact-based  or 
attitude  and  behavioral-based  programs),  and  lacking  in  long-term  effectiveness  data.  Government,  international/
national  bodies,  professional  organizations,  and  mental  health  professionals  can  play  a  crucial  in  addressing  mental 
health stigma.
Conclusion: There is a need for a multi-modal intervention and multi-sectoral coordination to mitigate the mental health 
stigma. Greater research (nationwide surveys, cultural determinants of stigma, culture-specific anti-stigma interventions) 
in this area is required.

INTRODUCTION

Stigma is defined as “a set of negative and often unfair beliefs 
that a society or group of people have about something.”[1] 
Other crucial terms related to stigma are ‘stereotype,’ which 
refers  to  negative  beliefs  about  a  group,  such  as  persons 
with mental Illness (PwMI) being stereotyped as dangerous 
or  having  weak  character;  ‘prejudice,’  which  entails  the 
agreement  of  the  individual/society  with  belief  and  the 
negative emotional reaction it invokes in them (e.g., PwMIs 

996

may  be  reacted  to  with  a  sense  of  anger,  fear,  or  pity); 
and  ‘discrimination’  manifests  as  the  behavioral  response 
of  individuals/societies  to  prejudice  they  harbor  towards 
a  group  of  individuals  (e.g.,  PwMIs  are  often  avoided  and 
deprived of employment and housing opportunities).[2]

Stigma  is  broadly  categorized  into  four  types:  ‘Systemic/
Structural/Institutional stigma’ refers to policies and practices 
of a nation or society, intentionally or unintentionally, that 
are at odds with the advantages/interests of the stigmatized 

Vaishnav, et al.: Stigma towards mental illness in Asian nationsIndian Journal of Psychiatry Volume 65, Issue 10, October 2023group; ‘Public and interpersonal stigma’ represents knowledge 
and stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination by members 
of society or community towards people with mental health 
conditions; ‘Self or internalized stigma’ indicates persons with 
mental health conditions because of their awareness of the 
negative stereotypes of others either agree with them or turn 
those prevailing stigmas against themselves; and ‘stigma by 
association’ refers to the attribution of negative stereotypes 
and  discrimination  directed  against  family  member(s)  of 
the  index  person(s)  (e.g.,  parents,  spouses,  or  siblings)  or 
towards  mental  health  professionals  (e.g.,  psychiatrists  or 
psychologists).[3]

Stigma  towards  mental  illness  (or  associated  morbidities) 
can  adversely  affect  an  individual’s  quality  of  life.[2]  It 
prevents PwMIs from contacting or utilizing not only mental 
health  (MH)  services  but  health  facilities  for  co-morbid 
physical  illnesses  as  well,  thereby  negatively  affecting 
the  course  and  outcome  of  their  health  condition(s). 
Furthermore, stigma puts them in a disadvantaged position 
in  the  workplace,  which  can  lead  to  serious  adverse 
occupational and economic outcomes.[3]

Mental 
illness  and  associated  stigma  act  as  double 
jeopardy  for  the  sufferer;  PwMIs  experience  not  only 
adverse consequences of the psychiatric illness (e.g., social, 
occupational,  physical,  and  marital  problems)  but  also 
those  related  to  mental  health/illness  stigma  (e.g.,  access 
to quality care, lack of occupational opportunities, loss of 
position in the society).[3,4]

Importantly,  cultural  factors  also  play  a  critical  role  in  the 
stigma  genesis,  perpetuation,  and  adverse  outcomes. 
Literature  suggests  that  myths  concerning  mental  illness 
vary across nations or societies. For instance, mental illness 
is  considered  as  an  outcome  of  spiritual  incompetency  or 
one’s sin in Nepal and India, respectively; similarly, in Arab 
countries,  it  is  often  seen  as  an  outcome  of  the  adverse 
influence of Jinn or supernatural powers.[1] Likewise, the social 
support system (e.g., South Korea with better social capital 
for  PwMI  vis’-a-vis’  China  has  lesser  mental  health  stigma) 
and acceptable treatment options (e.g., countries like India, 
China,  Nepal,  and  Kyrgyzstan  have  family  members  with 
greater  reliance  on  the  faith  healing/religious  coping  have 
greater  stigma  Vs.  The  Western  world,  where  the  medical 
model of illness is more acceptable) has a significant bearing 
on the extent of stigma and outcome of mental disorders.[1-3]

Research demonstrates that certain socio-demographic and 
cultural factors are associated with higher mental health-related 
stigma: older age, male gender, low socio-economic status, 
and  religious  aspects  (Confucianism  in  China,  Buddhism  in 
Nepal, beliefs on Jinn in Islamic nations, etc.) are positively 
related with the higher mental health-related stigma. It must 
be  emphasized  that  the  characteristics  of  stigma  and  its 
manifestations vary from nation to nation.[3,5,6] For instance, 

somatization is common in India, where such manifestations 
are  acceptable  forms  of  distress  or  sickness  in  society;  in 
contrast, core features of depression or anxiety are common 
in High-Income Countries (HICs).

Likewise,  a  country’s  health  system  also  determines  its 
magnitude of stigma. Nations with higher institutionalization 
practices  and  the  non-existence  of  national  mental 
health  policy  or  law  to  safeguard  the  rights  of  PwMIs 
invite  higher  stigma  (e.g.,  many  Low-and-middle  income 
countries  (LMICs))  as  compared  to  the  HICs  with  their 
well-established  policies/legislations/programs  to  support 
community mental health services and participatory-care.

Fortunately, many LMICs, including South Asian Association 
for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  countries  (e.g.,  India, 
Nepal),  have  developed  and  implemented  national  mental 
health  policies/laws/programs,  akin  to  HICs,  which  have 
been shown to reduce stigma; however, the implementation 
of  these  public-health  measures,  or  their 
long-term 
implications are yet to be evaluated.

Similarly,  several  anti-stigma  campaigns  have  been 
adopted  by  LMICs  (Time  to  change-global  (TC-GLOBAL)  in 
Kenya,  Nigeria;  (SMART)  in  India;  Reducing  Stigma  among 
Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE) in Nepal, etc.), akin to HICs, 
that  are  aimed  at  improving  mental  health  literacy  and 
social-contact-based  interventions,  their  comparison  with 
the  well-established  programs  of  developed  nations  (TTC, 
UK;  Opening  Minds,  Canada;  Beyond  blues,  Australia),  or 
program still requires systematic research exploration.[7-9]

Despite the significance of the topic in the context of the 
Asian continent and LAMI countries, there is a lack of data 
comprehensively assessing the effectiveness of anti-stigma 
programs in these regions of the world. Additionally, there 
is  a  dearth  of  literature  investigating  characteristics  of 
stigma reduction interventions in Asian countries and LMICs 
vis-à-vis  Western  or  high-income  countries.  Moreover, 
research  is  scarce  in  providing  insights  into  culturally 
relevant and sensitive interventions.

Therefore, to bridge the gap in the existing literature current 
review  aims  to  highlight  the  characteristics  of  stigma  in 
Asian countries, including SAARC nations, and other LMICs, 
types  of  ongoing  anti-stigma  interventions,  and  compare 
it with the existing anti-stigma programs of the developed 
nations.  Additionally,  we  intend  to  emphasize  crucial 
aspects of these programs, including their cultural nuances 
and the most effective components of these interventions, 
and provide future directions.

and  grey  literature  were  also  performed  to  obtain  the 
relevant  records.  The  present  review  focuses  on  mental 
health  stigma  and  anti-stigma  literature  relevant  to  the 
SAARC or Asian countries. Additionally, key research papers 
or documents from the World Health Organization (WHO), 
commissions 
(research  bodies,  such  as  the  Lancet 
Commission), and psychiatry bodies (e.g., World Psychiatry 
Association (WPA)) were also explored to extract pertinent 
information. The findings of the review are described and 
discussed  narratively.  The  results  have  been  described 
under the headings of 1) Characteristics of the stigma of the 
Asian  nations  and  LMICs  (Vs.  HIC),  2)  stigma  experiences 
by  the  vulnerable  population,  such  as  gender  minorities, 
children,  adolescents  geriatric  population  with  mental 
health  issues,  3)  comparison  of  anti-stigma  strategies  in 
the Asian nations, including SAARC nations, and LMICs (Vs. 
HICs),  4)  effectiveness  of  anti-stigma  interventions  in  the 
Asian nations and LMICs, and 5) limitations of the existing 
anti-stigma interventions in these countries.

FINDINGS

The  review  found  that  there  is  limited  data  from  the 
SAARC  nations.  Most  of  the  literature  is  available  as  part 
of  the  Asian  countries.[5,6]  Cultural  influences,  the  cultural 
idiom of distress, literacy in general, mental health literacy 
particularly, mental health resources (financial and human), 
the  existence  of  mental  health  policy,  legislation,  and 
community mental health program are crucial determinants 
of the magnitude of the mental health stigma and success 
of the anti-stigma program. Significant findings have been 
enumerated below:

Characteristics of the stigma of the SAARC nations and 
other LMIC (Vs. HIC) [Table 1]
In SAARC nations and other LMICs, stigma related to mental 
illness is usually based on the roots of traditional cultural 
beliefs  and  myths  of  specific  countries.  Other  factors  to 
which mental illness and associated behaviors are attributed 
are paranormal activities and magic religious beliefs, leading 
to a decreased perceived need for medical treatment. Such 
attitudes  and  myths  can  also  be  present  in  well-educated 
sections  of  society,  including  medical  students,  due  to 
unawareness or ignorance of the medical model of mental 
illnesses.  Such  unfamiliarity  can  further  enhance  stigma 
against those seeking treatment in mental health institutes. 
Seeking medical treatment and thus not following societal 
norms  can  also  lead  to  perceived  repercussions,  for 
example, family dishonor, deprivation of property rights, or 
prohibitions like prohibition to marry, etc. Mental illnesses 

998

are also often attributed to the weakness of the personality/
mind of the patients, their “karma,” or their poor upbringing 
by their parents. They may lead to isolation of the person 
or family in society or the workplace. However, the studies 
related  to  stigma  in  mental  illness  are  few  among  SAARC 
and other LMICs.[10,11]

A  sense  of  paternalistic  approach  is  more  common 
among  mental  health  professionals  and  authorities, 
which  may  sometimes  be  necessary/acceptable  by  people 
to  provide  medical  health  services.  This  can  sometimes 
lead  to  more  Involuntary  hospitalization,  following  old 
treatment  methods  and  restraints  methods,  particularly 
in  the  absence  of  a  proper  national  policy  for  mental 
health  services.  Many  countries  usually  lag  in  legislative 
reforms like a national mental health policy to protect the 
rights  of  people  with  mental  illness  and  those  who  have 
recovered (e.g., Philippines, Lebanon).

Poorly financed mental health services inaccessible to most 
deprived sections of society, creating a vulnerable section 
for mental illness and stigma. Poor coverage by insurance 
and  government  institutes.  Mental  health  services  mainly 
rely  on  private  NGOs  and  organizations.  There  is  often 
a  poor  organization,  distribution,  and  utilization  of 
services/resources  for  delivering  mental  health  services, 
for example, Lebanon, despite having three mental health 
professionals per 1 lakh, has poor access to people as most 
are concentrated in a few cities. Thus, a proper framework 
and policy to provide mental health services and make them 
more accessible to people are lacking in many SAARC and 
LMIC countries.

In comparison to HICs, there is more literature as compared 
to  LMICs.  The  studies  indicate  that  the  stigma  related  to 
mental illness is more disorder specific than mental illness 
in different HICs. For example, several studies have shown 
that the Japanese tend to have more unfavorable opinions 
about  persons  with  schizophrenia  than  those  from  other 
countries, including Australia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, 
and  Indonesia.  Also,  the  desire  for  distance  from  a  PWMI 
or PWLE is more prevalent. As a result, people often favor 
institutional care of patients. In HICs, the awareness about 
mental  illness  and  the  stigma  related  to  it  is  better  than 
LMICs, but still, the stigmatizing attitude may persist in the 
community  or  workplace.  A  more  stigmatizing  attitude  is 
prevalent  for  more  severe  mental  illness  and  disability  in 
HICs.

Stigma experienced by sexual and gender minorities 
(SGM)
Non-heterogenous  sexual  orientation  or  gender  minority 
or sexually diverse or LGBTQ+ community (hence, gender 
minority  group)  often  face  stigma  and  discrimination  in 
society, which spans across the world, irrespective of their 
socio-economic  advantages.[12]  These  individuals  suffer

The first extensive, nationwide anti-stigma campaign 
in Singapore
A 5-year initiative that seeks to change public 
perceptions of mental illness through the following 
means:
Publications and videos for creating awareness 
regarding stigma faced by PWMI, supporting those 
in recovery and appreciating their achievements, 
facilitating more discussions on mental health in the 
society guiding how to connect and support PWMI in 
recovery, and promoting a positive role of media in 
spreading awareness.
Singapore was the first Southeast Asian country to 
host the ‘Together Against Stigma’ (TAS) international 
conference to discuss stigma issues 

A first of its kind of initiative to improve mental health 
disorders awareness in schools with a focus on the 
adolescent population.
Promoting peer-to-peer interaction and support for 
students.
Under this program selected school students were 
trained as “wellness ambassadors” under the guidance 
of licensed psychologists for different mental disorders 
and to dispel common myths prevalent among other 
students.

•  Wellness ambassadors were involved in engaging in 
daily talks with their peers, social media, facilitating

A social campaign to fight stigma at different levels 
and in different settings
At workplaces and schools – advocating both 
attitudinal and structural changes through time to 
change pledges and providing support, training, or 
networking to bring about real change at ground 
level and encouraging the people with lived 
experience (time to change champions) to share their 
experience. Supporting schools and colleges to run 
anti-stigma activities.
At the community level – involving media, running 
various campaigns to spread awareness, involving 
private organizations (creating local time to change hub), 
encouraging volunteers to join the time to change programs
Targets the stigma experienced by people with depression 
and anxiety disorders promoting nondiscriminatory 
institutions, systems, communities, and policies.
Initiatives taken under Beyond Blue are National 
advertising campaigns and supporting resources, 
media coverage including social media, the beyond

After the successful implementation of 
the pilot program, the program is being 
implemented in more schools as well and 
the feasibility of implementing it in ministry 
schools is being assessed.
Also been implemented in Ghana, Nigeria, 
Kenya, Uganda, and India
Since the baseline in 2016-17, significant 
people have reported better attitudes towards 
mental illness, more so since the program 
started.
People with lived experience reported 
decreased workplace and social 
discrimination.
About 2/3rd of People with lived experience 
who worked with time to change felt more 
empowered to combat stigma and prejudice 
related to mental health consequently each 
year.
Although Beyond Blue has been effective in 
its awareness-raising activities but has not 
been as effective in the reduction of stigma 
and discrimination due to mental illness.
However, there have been continuous efforts 
to improve the strategies.

by other countries (Desapriya and Nobutada, 2002

An initiative using a targeted approach focusing on 
health care professionals, social care workers, public 
administrative workers, communities nearby mental 
health institutes, PWMI, and their caregivers via -
1. Festival activities like “NA Hlavu” (means “On the 
Head” in English) - a multimedia festival includes 
activities like movie projection, discussions, lectures, 
quizzes, leaflets, etc.
2. Health weeks (annual events comprising public 
lectures, concerts, discussion on mental health, 
displaying works of PWMI)

Public feedback on the draft was taken from 
November 2022 to February 2023, thus giving 
all stakeholders an opportunity to express their 
views on the draft.
The draft has been released with specific 
actions, timeframe, the responsibility of 
implementing to the concerned authority, and 
expected outcomes to achieve the objectives
Considered as one of the most successful 
programs against stigma and discrimination 
against PWMI
Significant improvement in attitudes towards 
PWMI among population esp. youngsters
The cost-benefit analysis reveals a benefit of 
about 13 dollars for every dollar spent in this 
program.

Literature on the outcome of this program is 
not available in these countries 

Sato has reported that, over a period of 
3 years, the renaming increased the percentage 
of cases in which patients were informed of 
the diagnosis increased from 36.7% to 69.7%.
86% of psychiatrists found the new term to 
be more suitable to inform patients of the 
diagnosis and explain to them the modern 
concept of the disorder (Sato, 2006).
Articles that linked schizophrenia to danger 
were increasing in frequency before renaming 
schizophrenia but started to decrease after 
renaming (Aoki et al., 2016)
However, research also shows that 
between 1985 and 2013 articles on 
schizophrenia contained more negative 
words than depressive disorder and 
diabetes mellitus (31.5%, 16.0%, and 8.2%, 
respectively); hence, renaming schizophrenia 
might have a limited effect (Koike, 
Yamaguchi, Ojio, and Ando, 2018).
Year-long video interventions, using filmed 
social contact, were more effective in reducing 
stigma than a self-instructional internet 
search (Koike et al., 2018).

•  Marginally more favorable attitudes towards

PWMI, less stigmatizing attitudes
However, the desire for future contact with 
PWMI did not show any change.

articles/906519‑world‑bank‑country‑and‑lending‑groups)

from  various  mental  health  issues  (often  at  a  higher  rate 
than the general population), such as depression, anxiety, 
psychological distress, suicidality, substance use disorders, 
etc.[12,13] (King and Boonchooduang, et al.).[13,14] Cultural norms 
and practices greatly influence the onset and progression of 
these  psychological  problems  among  the  gender  minority 
group. Unfortunately, societies that have greater acceptance 
and  promote  nature  in  terms  of  same-sex  or  sexually 
diverse practices, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and 
Shinto, have now kept a negative view towards individuals 
from gender minority groups.[12] Moreover, the attitude of 
the societies or nations also varies within the same region; 
for  instance,  countries  like  Singapore  in  Asia  have  less 
permissible attitudes towards non-heterosexual practices.

Minority-stress  hypotheses  have  posited  that  because  of 
greater  perceived  or  societal  stigma  (including  structural 
stigma) towards gender minority groups, the latter are prone 
to  develop  several  mental  health  conditions.[15]  Moreover, 
these individuals have limited access to mental health care 
or  psychological  support  due  to  barriers  to  seek  mental 
health  care.[16,17]  Furthermore,  healthcare  providers’  poor 
knowledge  and  attitude  or  cultural  competence  towards 
gender  minority  groups  negatively  influence  treatment 
outcomes.  Literature  suggests  that  gender-affirmative 
approaches  during  the  treatment  or  therapy  result  in 
greater  treatment  adherence  and  better  short-  and 
long-term  effects.[16]  Therefore,  health  professionals  in 
general, and mental health professionals in particular, need 
to be trained in cultural competence and gender affirmative 
approach  to  care  for  persons  from  the  gender  minority 
group.  It  is  crucial  to  note  that  sexually  minority  youth 
experience higher mental health concerns (vs. heterosexual 
youth)  and  stigma  related  to  their  sexuality  in  schools/
colleges, including bullies from fellow students, colleagues, 
and  teachers;  therefore,  school  mental  health  providers 
and  pediatricians  need  to  be  cognizant  of  these  issues 
among the LGBTQ+ youth and provide timely support and 
intervention.[14]

1002

HICs  have  come  up  with  policies,  curricula,  strategies,  or 
programs that are non-discriminatory and promote greater 
social inclusion of gender minorities one-two decade ago: 
British  Psychological  Associations’  Action  Plan  to  improve 
lives of the LGBTQ people in the UK (2020), National health 
Services’  initiative  to  train  staff  in  cultural  competency 
and  inclusive  organizational  culture,  American  psychiatry 
association’s  guidelines  on  working  with  people  from 
gender  minority  (2012,  updated  in  2020).[18,19]  Tardively, 
many  countries,  both  low-and  middle-income  countries, 
have  followed  the  policies/action  plans  of  the  HICs; 
Countries like India’s effort to ban conversion therapy for 
the LGBTQ community and the Indian Psychiatry Society’s 
position statement on the LGBTQ community are steps in 
the  right  direction[20,21]  or  China’s  effort  to  decriminalize 
homosexuality or LGBTQ advocacy movements.[22]

Mental health stigma faced by children and adolescents
Not  only  do  adults  with  mental  health  issues  suffer  from 
stigma  and  internalized  and  social  stigma,  but  children 
and  adolescents  with  mental  health  conditions  and  their 
caregivers and treating mental health professionals (affiliate 
stigma)  experience  stigma.[23,24]  For  instance,  a  study  from 
Taiwan  by  Chang  et  al.  (2020)  shows  that  the  caregivers 
of children and adolescents with ADHD suffer a great deal 
from  the  affiliated/courtesy  stigma,  which  is  shaped  by 
the  public  stigma  towards  mental  illnesses  of  the  children 
and  internalized  stigma.[23]  Latter,  not  only  has  a  poor 
psychological  influence  on  them  but  also  adversely  affects 
their  attitude  and  behavior  towards  the  mental  health 
conditions  of  their  children:  low  belief  in  the  biological 
nature of ADHD of children, poor help-seeking, less reliance 
on the pharmacological or behavioral interventions, and poor 
adherence to treatment. The authors highlight the necessity 
to undertake an ecologically sensitive treatment approach, 
policies  that  could  mitigate  the  negative  image  in  media 
towards  children  with  ADHD,  and  greater  communication 
between the education system and caregivers. Moreover, it 
emphasizes the need for MHPs to take up outreach activities 

Vaishnav, et al.: Stigma towards mental illness in Asian nationsIndian Journal of Psychiatry Volume 65, Issue 10, October 2023to identify and psychoeducate caregivers of children suffering 
from  such  neurodevelopmental  disorders.[20]  Research 
also  shows  that  interventions  addressing  the  society-wide 
prejudices  and  stereotypes  involving  various  stakeholders, 
such as media, schools, and government, are more beneficial 
in reducing stigma related to children and adolescents with 
mental health problems.[24]

Another  critical  area  is  stigma  related  to  children  and 
adolescents  with  mental  health  concerns  encountering 
the criminal justice system. Stigma towards this vulnerable 
population creates a divisive narrative, thereby marginalizing 
them,  limiting  access  to  care,  and  posing  barriers  to  the 
family  members  in  seeking  help,  which  in  turn  makes 
these children more vulnerable to coming in contact with 
the  justice  system.  Therefore,  it  is  vital  that  those  with 
adverse childhood experiences need to be identified first, 
and  properly  supported,  including  providing  them  with  a 
safe environment and providing with adequate professional 
health care.[25]

Similarly,  children  and  adolescents  with  higher  stigma,  a 
proxy  indicator  of  the  occasional  bullying  victimization, 
were  associated  with  higher  informal  (vs.  formal)  mental 
help-seeking and non-preference to be labeled as mentally 
ill.[26]

There are various anti-stigma interventions targeted toward 
youth  with  mental  health  problems,  particularly  in  HICs, 
Asia,  or  other  regions,  that  have  positive  results  in  terms 
of  decreasing  the  prevalence  of  depression,  improving 
mental  health  literacy,  having  a  positive  attitude  towards 
mental  health  help-seeking  and  ensuring  a  stigma-free 
environment in the school/college campus.[27-29] For instance, 
bring  change  to  the  mind  and  college  toolbox  project, 
an  institutionally-supported  and  students-led  project  at 
Indiana  University  in  the  US  (involving  active  and  passive 
engagement of the youth in anti-stigma activities),[28] Little 
Prince  is  depressed  in  Hong  Kong  (audio-visual  materials; 
having  both  professional  and  teachers-led  interventions) 
Lai  et  al.,[29]  and  depression  literacy  program  (lectures 
of  depression,  video-documentary  on  depression,  and 
awareness  activities)  in  Malaysia[27]  have  brought  about 
positive change in the lives of the individuals suffering from 
the mental illnesses as well as among youth.

as  depression,  suicide,  and  dementia  Herrmann  et  al.[30] 
Elderlies  face  double  jeopardy  in  the  sense  that  public 
or  societal  stigma  is  not  only  restricted  to  their  mental 
health  conditions  but  also  discrimination  related  to  their 
aging (ageism).[31]

Research shows that geriatric mental health stigma prevails 
among all the stakeholders: the general population, health 
care  professionals,  caregivers  of  geriatric  mentally  ill 
individuals, and persons suffering from mental illnesses.[32]

The prevailing stigma, whether internalized or public, not 
only  delays  the  identification  of  mental  health  problems 
among the elderly but also acts as a barrier to access care 
and  poor  treatment  adherence.  Moreover,  the  pessimistic 
attitude  of  healthcare  professionals  towards  the  course 
and outcomes of dementia or other old-age mental health 
conditions  (depression,  suicide,  substance  use),  on  top 
of  the  perceived  stigma  of  the  elderly,  compounds  the 
problem.[33]

that  policymakers,  community 

Research  shows  that  discrimination  and  social  support 
indirectly  moderate  the  relationship  between  stress  and 
depression  among  the  geriatric  population.[34]  Therefore, 
it’s  crucial 
leaders, 
patient-caregiver  groups,  and  healthcare  professionals, 
particularly  geriatric  psychiatrists,  work  in  collaboration 
to  improve  the  social  support  of  elderly  individuals  with 
mental  health  conditions  and  mitigate  aging-related 
discrimination.[32]

Some data indicates that interventions aimed at improving 
the knowledge and skills of the community/hospice nursing 
professionals  working  with  the  geriatric  population  in 
identifying signs and symptoms of depression and ways to 
communicate  with  the  individuals  suffering  from  mental 
disorders  and  referral  physicians  can  substantially  reduce 
stigma  related  to  depression  and  suicidality  among  the 
older.[35]  Likewise,  a  collaborative  care  model  where 
mental  health  assessment  and  treatment  is  integrated 
with  primary  healthcare  services  for  the  elderly  improves 
the identification of depression, reduces perceived stigma 
related to mental health conditions; and that such models 
are sustainable, effective for both short-term and long-term 
outcomes, and cost-effective.[36]

However,  these  interventions  are  only  limited  to  select, 
too  high-income  Asian  countries,  and  their  long-term 
effectiveness  and  behavioral  change  need 
to  be 
systematically investigated.

Mental health stigma experienced by the geriatric 
population
Like other age groups, the geriatric population with mental 
disorders  suffers  from  a  great  deal  of  perceived  or  public 
stigma  towards  geriatric  mental  health  conditions,  such 

However,  the  available  research  on  the  stigma  related  to 
geriatric psychiatry is limited to HICs (US, Germany, UK, etc.). 
Among the Asian countries, the data is primarily restricted 
to  South  Korea  and  China;  therefore,  greater  research  on 
this  topic  is  required  from  other  Asian  countries  (Indian 
sub-continent), particularly those investigating the cultural 
determinants of the stigma in the geriatric population and 
the positive role community, and the national legislations/
programs/policies can play in ameliorating this stigma and 
facilitate mental health care access and effective treatment.

Vaishnav, et al.: Stigma towards mental illness in Asian nationsIndian Journal of Psychiatry Volume 65, Issue 10, October 2023Characteristics of commonly used anti‑stigma 
interventions in the Asian nations or LMICs (Vs. HIC) 
[Table 2]
As  compared  to  the  HICs  or  global  north,  anti-stigma 
interventions  are  limited  in  Asian/SAARC  countries  or 
LMICs;  moreover,  these  interventions  are  restricted  in 
terms  of  the  region  and  targeted  population  (e.g.,  entire 
population  vs.  specific  population,  mental  illness  vs. 
disorder-specific interventions). Below we have enumerated 
the  characteristics  of  the  available  interventions  in  the 
LMICs or Asian nations:

1.  Educational  strategies  –  Creating  awareness  about 
mental  illness  and  related  stigma  is  one  of  the  major 
strategies  to  combat  stigma  in  SAARC  and  other 
LMICs.  The  various  components  of  education  involve 
busting the myths prevalent in society, explaining the 
medical  concept  of  mental  illness,  letting  them  know 
that  mental  illnesses  are  treatable  and  manageable, 
and  how  to  identify  various  mental  health  conditions 
and  seeking  medical  help  early.  Also,  how  to  cope 
with  caregiving-related  burdens.  Various  means  are 
being used for spreading awareness, for example film 
festivals  and  movie  clubs,  marathon  runs,  involving 
famous  personalities  to  educate  or  share  their  own 
stories,  using  simpler  methods  of  mental  health 
education  dissemination  like  videos,  movies,  etc.,  a 
sensitive  and  appropriate  portrayal  of  mental  illness 
in media, a social media campaign to target prevalent 
myths,  providing  a  platform  to  the  PWLE  to  share 
their  experience.[37-39]  Various  NGOs  are  also  involved 
in creating awareness.[10,40] Changing the names of the 
psychosis/schizophrenia  to  less  stigmatizing  term  in 
some Asian countries have shown a reduction in public 
stigma  or  negative  stereotypes  in  print/social  media. 
The feasibility and effectiveness of such nomenclature 
change can be explored by other nations/societies.[41,42]
2.  Legislations – legislation plays a vital role in protecting 
the rights of PWMI, ensuring mental health services are 
easily accessible and free of discrimination, and the right 
to study/work and prohibiting discriminatory structural 
and behavioral discrimination, involuntary admissions, 
inhuman  treatment,  unnecessary  restraints  in  homes 
or  hospitals,  deprivation  of  societal,  workplace  and 
marriage  rights.  Many  Asian  countries  (India,  China, 
Philippines),  including  LMICs  (Bangladesh,  Sri  Lanka, 
etc.), have developed national mental health legislation 
to ensure right-based care for PWMI.[43-46] However, the 
specific  anti-stigma  program  is  still  lacking  in  many 
Asian/SAARC nations.

3.  Services‑oriented strategies – Access to healthcare for 
mental illnesses remains a significant challenge in Asians 
and  many  other  LMICs.  The  constraints  include  poor 
connectivity, fear of isolation from society, and financial 
burden due to hospitalization and medications. Hence, 
strategies like community-based treatment to minimize 

1004

the isolation of the patients and family, provision of free 
medicines, and hospitalization also remove the financial 
constraints as a barrier to seek treatment. The District 
Mental  Health  Program  of  India,  the  686”  program  of 
China, the RESHAPE program of Nepal, and skills training 
in mental health care for nurses, teachers, and police are 
notable programs/strategies in this direction.[47-49]

4.  Special  programs  –  There  is  overall  a  few  special 
programs against stigma in Asian and SAARC countries. 
Some  of  the  available  anti-stigma  programs  in  this 
region are Open the Doors for Schizophrenia in Japan, 
RESHAPE Nepal, SMART mental health India, and TIME 
TO CHANGE GLOBAL (India and African countries).[39,49-51] 
However, these programs are restricted to an individual 
disease or a local area.

Compared  to  SAARC  or  LMICs,  the  interventions  in  HICs 
are nationwide, incorporating several mental illnesses and 
targeting specific populations. With mental health policy and 
legislation already in place, most anti-stigma activities are 
program  based.  For  example,  the  “Wellness  Ambassador” 
program  in  Qatar  targets  adolescent  mental  health  and 
students  in  schools  and  colleges.  The  “Time  to  Change” 
program  in  the  UK  and  the  “Opening  Minds”  program  in 
Canada involves specific interventions for different setting 
and  age  groups  like  workplace,  schools,  and  community 
levels.  Similarly,  the  “Beyond  Blue”  program  in  Australia 
deals  with  stigma  related  to  depressive  and  anxiety 
disorders in the Australian population. The “Like Minds Like 
Mine”  program  in  New  Zealand  focuses  on  strategies  for 
the  inclusion  of  PWMI  or  PWLE  into  the  community.  One 
of  the  strategies  to  reduce  stigma  against  schizophrenia 
in Japan and Hong Kong was to rename the disorders and 
have evidence of decreased stigma. Moreover, literature is 
also available regarding the above program’s effectiveness 
in  improving  the  population’s  knowledge,  attitude,  and 
behavior toward mental illness or PWMI.

Effectiveness of anti‑stigma interventions in Asian 
countries/SAARC nations and LMICs
The awareness campaign in SAARC nations has been mostly 
successful in increasing the target population’s knowledge, 
but  how  much  of  it  is  translated  into  a  change  in  their 
behavior  is  still  under-research.[52]  On  a  positive  note,  the 
legislation  has  successfully  brought  down  involuntary 
hospitalization.[53]  However,  the  literature  regarding  the 
effectiveness  of  various  strategies  and  the  outcome  study 
of the above legislation in mental health stigma reduction 
is still lacking.

Limitations of the anti‑stigma interventions in the Asian 
countries/SAARC nations and LMICs
Overall, there is a dearth of studies in Asian countries/SAARC 
nations and LMICs on stigma related to mental illness and 
the effectiveness of various strategies being implemented at 
present. Given the lack of resources, the common limitations

WAY FORWARD

Greater research is required from Asian and SAARC countries, 
particularly  Afghanistan,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Maldives, 
and  SriLanka.  Targeted,  at  different  levels  (structural, 
societal, and self-stigma), anti-stigma interventions that are 
evidence-based as well as innovative need to be utilized and 

1007

Vaishnav, et al.: Stigma towards mental illness in Asian nationsIndian Journal of Psychiatry Volume 65, Issue 10, October 2023developed to address mental health stigma in the Asia and 
LAMI  nations.  Some  of  the  critical  issues  around  this  are 
enumerated below:

nurses,  and  allied  staff)  must  be  trained  to  assess  and 
(including  referral  to  the

specialist).

illnesses 

Structural stigma: To counter structural or organizational 
stigma,  countries  need  to  adapt  WHO-package  guidelines 
on  Mental  health  Policy,  Legislation,  and  national 
programs.[54] A rights-based approach to mental health care, 
treatment,  and  rehabilitation  is  to  be  followed.  Recently, 
countries  like  India  (Mental  Healthcare  Act,  2017)  and 
China (National Mental Health Law, 2012) have developed 
their national mental health policies, action plans, and laws; 
other countries must develop and implement similar public 
health  measures.  Although  developing  and  implementing 
such  policies/laws  can  prevent  mental  health  stigma  to  a 
greater  extent,  their  ground-level  implementation  and 
effectiveness  in  reducing  all  forms  of  stigma  (structural, 
social, and individual) need to be assessed, including access 
to quality care.

Although  several  nationwide  anti-stigma  campaigns  have 
been undertaken in many LMICs, including SAARC nations, 
however,  effect-size  of  such  interventions  is  low.[3,55]    This 
could be attributed to their non-specific nature (one-size-fit-all 
approach to all the mental disorders and for all the target 
groups),  heavily  based  on  educative/cognitive  component, 
lesser  involvement  of  PWLE,  not  having  a  multi-model 
approach  (involving  PWLE,  health  professionals,  media, 
social activist, NGOs, etc.).[3,9,56] Hence, more tailored- target 
group-specific  and  disease-specific-  interventions,  which 
bring about an attitudinal and behavior change among the 
public and PWMI or their caregivers, are to be designed and 
implemented. Involving PMLE at all stages of the intervention 
is vital in this context.

As stigma and its manifestations are determined by several 
socio-cultural  factors,  targeting  them  is  the  cornerstone 
of  any  anti-stigma  program.[4,7]  In  this  regard,  anti-stigma 
measures  need  to  involve  religious  leaders,  faith  healers, 
and community leaders while developing and implementing 
such interventions for the former to be culturally sensitive 
and relevant.

interventions  must 

follow  a  Bottom-up 
Anti-stigma 
approach  (from  community  to  policy  level)  rather  than  a 
top-down approach (from policy and program to impractical 
implementation  in  the  community).  This  will  ensure  that 
such  programs  will  have  such  components.  One  such 
successful example is the Open Minds program of Canada.[9]

Integration  of  mental  health  care  into  general/primary 
health  care  is  paramount.[3,4]  This  would  not  only  reduce 
stigma related to mental illness and improve access to care 
but also ensure comprehensive care to co-morbid physical 
illnesses among PwMI and better treatment outcomes.[4] In 
this context, community health workers (medical officers, 

1008

Media and mental health
In  terms  of  mental  health  stigma,  media  can  act  as  a 
double-edged sword. There is ample literature that suggests 
that  media  can  lead  to  the  worsening  of  stigma  through 
propelling  misinformation,  myths,  and  stereotyping  of 
mental  health  conditions,  including  suicide.  Hence,  there 
is  a  dire  need  for  responsible  media  coverage  of  mental 
health  issues.  Although  several  countries  have  developed 
media  guidelines  for  reporting  mental  health  conditions, 
they are rarely followed in their letter and spirit; moreover, 
many Asian and LAMI countries and LMICs do not have such 
specific guidelines. However, the media has the potential to 
dispel myths and stigma related to mental health conditions. 
They  can  have  a  significant  role  in  anti-stigma  campaigns 
that  can  promote  mental  health  promotion,  educate  the 
public about mental health, and provide a valuable platform 
to the PWLE, thereby facilitating contact-based anti-stigma 
interventions.[39,55]

Sustainability  of  anti‑stigma  programs:  for  anti-stigma 
interventions to be sustainable, they need to be integrated 
with a larger government priority, such as the government’s 
response  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  also 
involves  anti-stigma  measures  against  mental  health  and 
frontline HCWs.[3]

interventions  should 

Interpersonal stigma
Furthermore,  anti-stigma 
involve 
community-health workers and employ social-contact-based 
interventions  involving  communication  between  PWLE 
and  health  workers;  this  would  be  more  effective  than 
traditional  education-based  and  patient-caregiver-limited 
anti-stigma measures.[3,49,51]

Importantly,  medical  curricula  and  social  sciences  must 
incorporate the topic of stigma (including intersectionality: 
conditions  commonly  associated  with  stigma  HIV/
AIDS,  Leprosy,  marginalized  individuals)  so  that  young 
professionals get sensitized about the mental health stigma 
and  its  social  construct,  put  effort  to  prevent  or  manage 
it.[57]

One of the common places where mental health stigma is 
prevalent and associated with significant adverse outcomes 
is  the  workplace.  Literature,  including  one  from  Japan, 
suggests  that  workplace-based  anti-stigma  interventions 
can  substantially  reduce  stigma  and  improve  the  work 
performance  of  PwMI.[58,59]  The  positive  impact  of  such 
workplace-based  interventions  has  also  been  reported 
by  Guangzhou  mental  health  program  in  China;  however, 
workplace-based  anti-stigma 
largely 
elusive in other Asian and LAMInations. Therefore, SAARC 

interventions  are 

Vaishnav, et al.: Stigma towards mental illness in Asian nationsIndian Journal of Psychiatry Volume 65, Issue 10, October 2023nations  must  come  up  with  workplace-based  anti-stigma 
initiatives.  Such  programs  should  involve  components  of 
social  contact  and  take  on  board  the  key  personnel  from 
the workplace (supervisors, managers, etc.).

Likewise,  School-based  interventions  can  reduce  mental 
health  stigma  significantly.[60]  Notably,  mental  health 
first  aid  (MHFA)  delivered  through  the  gatekeepers  and 
activities involving arts, stories, videos, and role-plays are 
key  strategies  concerning  this.[3]  SAARC  nations  need  to 
come up with more school-based anti-stigma interventions 
that suit the cultural and population characteristics of these 
countries.

Community  participation  while  planning  and  delivering 
anti-stigma  interventions  is  crucial.  Anti-stigma  programs 
must  target  key  members/groups  of  society,  such  as 
community leaders, police, and religious leaders, for them 
to be effective.[61]

Family  education  and  the  involvement  of  caregivers  in 
planning  and  delivering  interventions  aimed  at  reducing 
stigma are essential to decrease interpersonal and affiliate 
stigma. This will also empower caregivers and patients to 
tackle mental health-related stigma and contribute to their 
recovery.

Champions  or  aspirations  individuals  who  have  overcome 
their  mental  health  problems  and  are  successful  in  their 
respective fields- need to be involved or instead lead various 
interventions  targeted  towards  stigma  in  SAARC  nations; 
this has shown positive effects in the developed countries. 
This  will  reduce  interpersonal  stigma  and  ameliorate 
individual or perceived stigma. Media can play a vital role 
by providing a platform to such champions.

Individual stigma
Literature suggests that removing derogatory terminologies 
related  to  mental  disorders  can  markedly  reduce  mental 
health stigma. Asian Countries like Japan and Hong Kong have 
replaced stigmatizing terms related to schizophrenia (mind 
splitting)  with  more  informative  or  neutral  terms  such  as 
integration disorders and incoordination between thoughts 
and perception.[6,7] Similarly, SAARC countries need to come 
up with non-stigmatizing terms for various mental disorders. 
The  task  force  of  the  World  Psychiatry  Association  (WPA) 
against  stigma  sub-committee  and  various  psychiatric 
societies  of  the  member  countries,  in  collaboration  with 
the  World  Health  Organization  or  national  agencies,  can 
contribute to this.

Balanced  psychoeducation  about  mental  illness  to  PWMI 
can  help  reduce  personal  stigma  significantly.  It  must  be 
highlighted  that  a  pure  biological  model  of  mental  illness 
can instead worsen the stigma among PwMI;[49,55] therefore, 
psychoeducation  should  be  contextual  and  balanced, 

incorporating components of biological, psychological, and 
social  determinants  of  mental  illnesses.  Asian  countries 
and  LAMInations  should  come  up  with  a  guideline  for 
psychoeducation  of  various  mental  disorders  that  are 
socially  acceptable  and  culturally  appropriate.  Agencies 
like WPA and national psychiatry associations/societies can 
work towards this.

As  highlighted  previously,  in  many  SAARC  nations  (India, 
China, Nepal, etc.), mental illnesses have been linked to a 
character flaw, religious/spiritual deviance of an individual, 
and the outcome of paranormal or supernatural influences; 
this  attitude  gives  rise  to  stigma  right  from  inception  of 
mental  health  conditions  and  at  the  grass-root  level.[4,6,7] 
The latter not only promotes stigma but also limits access 
to care for PwMI. Hence, it is essential that mental problems 
should  be  normalized  and  medicalized  in  these  nations, 
which have shown positive results in reducing stigma, and 
mental health professionals and health workers must play a 
key role in this Avari et al.[62]

Fostering  an  approach  of  participatory  mental  health 
care  (involving  patients  and  their  caregivers  and  MHPs) 
can  reduce  individual  stigma  substantially.[63]  Fortunately, 
India  and  China  have  emphasized  participatory-based 
mental  health  care  in  their  mental  health  policy;  their 
implementation  and  outcomes  need  to  be  investigated 
through robust research design.

CONCLUSIONS

Mental health stigma is prevalent worldwide; however, its 
determinants  and  manifestations  can  vary  from  country 
to  country.  Socio-cultural  factors  play  a  critical  role  in 
the  onset  of  stigma,  its  perpetuation,  and  the  success  of 
anti-stigma  measures.  Literature  suggests  that  forms  and 
extent  of  stigma  in  Asian  countries,  more  so  in  SAARC 
nations,  are  different  from  the  Western  world.  However, 
there is limited data from the Asian and LMICs concerning 
stigma, including anti-stigma measures. Although countries 
like China and India have developed national mental health 
policies and laws to safeguard the rights of the PWME and 
curtail  stigma,  other  SAARC  nations  have  yet  to  join  the 
league. Furthermore, the impact of such policies/legislation 
in tackling the stigma is yet to be researched. Few innovative 
and  social-contact-based  programs 
India, 
RESHAPE in Nepal, and TTC- global) have been undertaken 
in SAARC nations; their long-term effectiveness required to 
be investigated; other SAARC nations must all research the 
effectiveness  of  such  initiatives  in  their  social  context  or 
come up with the relevant anti-stigma campaigns.

nuances of the Asian countries and their available resources.

Mutual knowledge sharing between the HICs and LMICs and 
among the LMICs should be promoted; collaboration with 
international  (WHO,  WPA)  and  national  agencies  (national 
psychiatric associations, NGOs) is paramount in countering 
stigma in SAARC nations. Involvement of PWMI in all stages 
of the anti-stigma programs, community and stakeholders’ 
sensitization  of  health  professionals, 
participation, 
particularly  medical  undergraduates,  concerning  stigma, 
and collaboration with media are vital strategies in reducing 
stigma. Greater research is required in the SAARC countries 
concerning  the  cultural  determinants  or  nuances  of  the 
stigma, stigma registry to gauge the magnitude of stigma, 
and culturally sensitive and relevant anti-stigma programs.
