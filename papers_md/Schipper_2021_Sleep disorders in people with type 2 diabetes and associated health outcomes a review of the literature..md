Abstract
Sleep disorders are linked to development of type 2 diabetes and increase the risk of developing diabetes complications. Treating sleep
disorders might therefore play an important role in the prevention of diabetes progression. However, the detection and treatment of
sleep disorders are not part of standardised care for people with type 2 diabetes. To highlight the importance of sleep disorders in people
with type 2 diabetes, we provide a review of the literature on the prevalence of sleep disorders in type 2 diabetes and the association
between sleep disorders and health outcomes, such as glycaemic control, microvascular and macrovascular complications, depression,
mortality and quality of life. Additionally, we examine the extent to which treating sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes
improves these health outcomes. We performed a literature search in PubMed from inception until January 2021, using search terms for
sleep disorders, type 2 diabetes, prevalence, treatment and health outcomes. Both observational and experimental studies were included
in the review. We found that insomnia (39% [95% CI 34, 44]), obstructive sleep apnoea (55–86%) and restless legs syndrome (8–45%)
were more prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes, compared with the general population. No studies reported prevalence rates for
circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence or parasomnias. Additionally, several cross-sectional and
prospective studies showed that sleep disorders negatively affect health outcomes in at least one diabetes domain, especially glycaemic
control. For example, insomnia is associated with increased HbA1c levels (2.51 mmol/mol [95% CI 1.1, 4.4]; 0.23% [95% CI 0.1, 0.4]).
Finally, randomised controlled trials that investigate the effect of treating sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes are scarce, based
on a small number of participants and sometimes inconclusive. Conventional therapies such as weight loss, sleep education and
cognitive behavioural therapy seem to be effective in improving sleep and health outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We
conclude that sleep disorders are highly prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes, negatively affecting health outcomes. Since treatment
of the sleep disorder could prevent diabetes progression, efforts should be made to diagnose and treat sleep disorders in type 2 diabetes
in order to ultimately improve health and therefore quality of life.

Introduction

Diabetes is a severe public health problem, negatively affect-
ing a person’s quality of life (QoL) and health, through
increasing the risk of microvascular and macrovascular
complications, depression and mortality. An important but
less-known risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes
is having a sleep disorder. Sleep disorders negatively affect
sleep quality and duration, causing detrimental effects on
glucose metabolism and weight regulation [1]. For example,
a sleep duration of <5 h and poor sleep quality are associated
with developing type 2 diabetes (RR 1.48 [95% CI 1.25, 1.76]
and RR 1.40 [95% CI 1.21, 1.63], respectively) [1], and
insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) have been asso-
ciated with developing type 2 diabetes (OR 1.07 [95% CI
1.02, 1.11] and OR 2.02 [95% CI 1.57, 2.61], respectively)
[1, 2]. Managing and treating sleep disorders could therefore
play an important role in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

According to the of the International Classification of Sleep
Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) [3], sleep disorders can be
divided into six main groups: insomnia; sleep-related breathing
disorders; central disorders of hypersomnolence; circadian
rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWDs); parasomnias; and
sleep-related movement disorders (see detailed descriptions in
Table 1). Sleep disorders typically cause disturbances in the qual-
ity, amount and timing of sleep, resulting in impaired daytime
functioning and distress. Several sleep disorders are highly prev-
alent in the general population (Table 1). Considering the asso-
ciation between sleep disorders and development of type 2 diabe-
tes, the prevalence of sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabe-
tes is probably higher compared with the general population.

Sleep disorders may also result in faster diabetes progres-
sion and thus play an important role in diabetes management.
However, detection and treatment of sleep disorders are not
part of standardised care for people with type 2 diabetes. To
start addressing the gap between current knowledge and clin-
ical care, we provide a review of the literature on the preva-
lence of sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes and the
association with the following health outcomes: glycaemic
control, microvascular and macrovascular complications,
depression, mortality and QoL. We also explore the extent
to which treating sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes
improves the above-mentioned health outcomes. With this
review, we aim to highlight the importance of targeted

diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders in people with type
2 diabetes.

Methods

A literature search was performed in PubMed from inception
until January 2021, using MeSH and tiab search terms indi-
cating sleep disorders (e.g. ‘sleep disorders’, ‘sleep wake
disorders’, ‘sleep deprivation’, ‘circadian’, ‘sleep arousal’,
‘insomnia’, ‘obstructive sleep apnea’ and ‘restless legs
syndrome’) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (e.g. ‘diabetes
mellitus 2’ and ‘non-insulin dependent’). Additionally, search
terms for prevalence, treatment and health outcomes were
used (e.g. ‘morbidity’, ‘prevalence’, ‘depressive disorder’,
‘sleep drug’, ‘sleep medication’ and ‘health status’). See
Electronic supplementary material Table 1 for the full list of
search terms. All relevant English or Dutch language original
and review studies were read by two authors (SS and FR) and
summarised. Observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal)
and experimental studies were included. No quality assess-
ment or risk of bias assessment were made.

Prevalence and health outcomes of sleep
disorders in type 2 diabetes

In this section, we discuss the evidence on prevalence and asso-
ciations of sleep disorders with health outcomes (see also Fig.
1). No or limited literature was found for hypersomnolence,
parasomnias and several movement disorders. A review by
Mohammadi et al. identified several papers that elaborate on
mechanisms by which narcolepsy, a very specific disorder,
increases the risk of development of type 2 diabetes [4].
However, no papers on prevalence of hypersomnolence and
associated health outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes were
identified. Only case reports were found for parasomnias (i.e.
abnormal nocturnal behaviour [5] and rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep behaviour disorder [6]), which will not be
discussed here. For movement disorders other than restless legs
syndrome (RLS) and periodic limbic movement disorder
(PLMD), some were identified as a risk factor for the develop-
ment of type 2 diabetes (i.e. bruxism [7]). Further research is
needed to investigate the prevalence of the aforementioned
sleep disorders and associated health outcomes in type 2 diabe-
tes. Finally, data on the prevalence of having multiple sleep
disorders simultaneously in those with diabetes is lacking.
This is important as OSA and insomnia frequently co-occur
in the general population and this co-occurrence is associated
with increased comorbidities, including diabetes [8].

quantity of sleep resulting in significant daytime distress.
Insomnia is associated with problems initiating or
maintaining sleep, frequent awakenings and the inability to
return back to sleep. These complaints occur despite
adequate opportunity and circumstances to sleep.
Group of disorders characterised by symptoms such as
snoring, fatigue, insomnia or subjective respiratory
disturbances, or associated medical or psychiatric disorders
in combination with ≥5 predominantly obstructive
respiratory events per h of sleep, or ≥15 obstructive
respiratory event per h (even in absence of symptoms). This
diagnosis can be further subdivided into OSA disorders,
central sleep apnoea syndromes, sleep-related
hypoventilation disorders and idiopathic central alveolar
hypoventilation.

Group of disorders characterised by subjective excessive

daytime sleepiness that cannot be explained as a result of
another sleep–wake disorder, resulting in daily occurrences
of an insuppressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into
sleep. This disorder group includes narcolepsy, idiopathic
hypersomnia, insufficient sleep syndrome, and
hypersomnias due to medical disorders, medication or
substance and psychiatric disorder

The disorders belonging to this group include delayed and

advanced sleep–wake phase disorder, irregular sleep–wake
rhythm disorder, non-24 h sleep–wake rhythm disorder,
shift-work disorder, jet-lag disorder and circadian
sleep–wake disorders not otherwise specified. The disorders
are characterised by a chronic or recurrent pattern of
sleep-disruption primarily caused by a change in the
endogenous circadian timing system or misalignments
between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the socially
desired rhythm, resulting in insomnia or excessive
sleepiness. It is associated with distress or functional
impairment over a period of at least 3 months (except for
jet-lag disorder).

Parasomnias

Parasomnias can be divided into NREM-related parasomnias,

REM-related parasomnias and other parasomnias.
NREM-related disorders include recurrent episodes of
incomplete awakening, with abnormal responsiveness,
limited or no memory or dream report, and at least partial
amnesia for the episode. REM-related parasomnias occur as
a consequence of state dissociation between REM sleep and
being awake.

Insomnia

Insomnia is characterised by difficulty initiating and maintain-
ing sleep or by waking up earlier than desired despite adequate
opportunity to sleep. A meta-analysis of 71 studies from our
group [9] showed that the prevalence of insomnia and insom-
nia symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes is 39% (95% CI
34, 44), which is four times higher than in the general

population. The prevalence was even higher with increasing
age (44%) or with comorbidities present (60%). However,
these numbers should be interpreted cautiously, due to the
high heterogeneity of the studies included.

The meta-analysed data [9] also revealed associations
between insomnia and poorer health outcomes, such as poorer
control of HbA1c (2.51 mmol/mol [95% CI 1.1, 4.4]; 0.23%
[95% CI 0.1, 0.4]) and fasting glucose (0.4 mmol/l [95% CI

0.2, 0.7), in people with type 2 diabetes and insomnia (symp-
toms), compared with those with type 2 diabetes only. Chew
et al. [10] showed insomnia to be associated with diabetic
retinopathy (OR 1.61 [95% CI 1.01, 2.49) in 1231 people with
diabetes. No studies investigated associations between insom-
nia and other microvascular or macrovascular complications.
Our meta-analysis [9] did, however, show an association
between insomnia and the predecessor of such complications
(i.e. high cholesterol levels).

Several studies have shown insomnia to be associated with
depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetes (OR 1.31 [95% CI
1.16, 1.47]) [11]. Furthermore, in people with diabetes or
hypertension, insomnia is associated with an increased mortal-
ity rate (OR 7.17 [95% CI 1.41, 36.62]) [12]. Finally, in addi-
tion to poorer health outcomes, and perhaps most important
for patients, insomnia negatively affects QoL, affecting all
domains of QoL questionnaires [13, 14], compared with those
with type 2 diabetes without insomnia.

OSA

OSA, a sleep-related breathing disorder, is characterised by
complaints such as non-restorative sleep, sleepiness or snor-
ing, accompanied by obstructive respiratory events. A recent
review of 12 studies, by Reutrakul and Mokhlesi [15], showed
that OSA is more prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes,

with the overall OSA prevalence ranging from 55% to 86%.
More severe complaints and higher incidence were reported in
men [15]. The prevalence of OSA is 86% in obese populations
with type 2 diabetes. The shared association with obesity
makes discerning an independent link between OSA and
diabetes challenging. In their review, Kent et al. [16] showed
that intermittent hypoxia and sleep deprivation/fragmentation
play a synergistic role in glucose dysfunction and obesity.
OSA is a strong predictor of diabetes, with a 49% increase
in diabetes risk after adjustment for covariates, including BMI
[1]. Moreover, the combined occurrence of OSA and insom-
nia is associated with higher prevalence of cardiometabolic
morbidity, including diabetes, irrespective of BMI [8].

Although highly prevalent, OSA still remains undiagnosed
in most people with type 2 diabetes managed in primary care,
with only 18% being detected [15]. When diagnosed, OSA is
associated with poorer glycaemic control, with 11 mmol/mol
(1%) difference in HbA1c levels between those with type 2
diabetes in lowest vs highest OSA severity quartiles [17].
People with type 2 diabetes and OSA are also more likely to
develop microvascular complications, with OSA explaining
19% of the variance for retinopathy measures (r = 0.2; p =
0.04) [18] and being associated with an increased risk of
diabetic nephropathy (OR 2.64 [95% CI 1.13, 6.16]) [19] as
well as diabetic neuropathy (OR 3.97 [95% CI 1.80, 8.74])
[20]. Additionally, people with type 2 diabetes and OSA are

 
Diabetologia (2021) 64:2367–2377

2371

more likely to develop coronary artery disease (HR 2.2 [95%
CI 1.2, 3.9]) and heart failure (HR 3.5 [95% CI 1.4, 9.0]) [21].
No studies have reported on the association between OSA and
depression in type 2 diabetes. A prospective population-based
study did show that people with type 2 diabetes and OSA have
a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.37 [95% CI
1.16, 4.82]), compared with people with only type 2 diabetes
or only OSA [22]. Finally, in addition to poorer health
outcomes, OSA affects QoL in people with type 2 diabetes;
those with OSA score lower in all domains of QoL question-
naires, compared with people with type 2 diabetes only [23].

RLS and PLMD

RLS is a sleep-related movement disorder that is characterised
by the urge to move in response to uncomfortable and
unpleasant sensations in the legs during periods of rest or
inactivity, thus interfering with sleep. The exact pathophysi-
ology of RLS is not known, but changes in dopaminergic
neurotransmission, related to iron deficiency in specific brain
areas, seem to play an important role [24]. Findings from 970
participants from several cross-sectional and case–control
studies [25–32] suggest that the prevalence of RLS in people
with type 2 diabetes ranges from 8% to 45%, based on the
International RLS Study Group criteria. No sex differences
were reported. This prevalence might be an overestimation,
as until recently these study group criteria could not sufficient-
ly differentiate RLS from peripheral neuropathy [25, 33].

With regard to health outcomes, in a population of 872
people with type 2 diabetes, RLS was associated with a higher
prevalence of retinopathy (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.15, 2.49]),
neuropathy (OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.44, 3.90]) and nephropathy
(OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.31, 3.68]) [34]. In the same population, a
higher prevalence of macrovascular complications was
observed, namely coronary heart disease (OR 1.95 [95% CI
1.32, 2.89]) and stroke (OR 2.15 [95% CI 1.27, 2.63]),
compared with the prevalence in people with type 2 diabetes
only. No statistically significant increase in HbA1c level [26,
29, 31] was reported in people with type 2 diabetes and RLS,
compared with those without RLS, but they were more likely
to develop depression (OR 3.21 [95% CI 1.07, 11.23]) [35].
Studies on mortality, type 2 diabetes and RLS were not iden-
tified. In addition to poorer health outcomes, people with RLS
and type 2 diabetes have significantly lower QoL (e.g. vitality
score 52.3 vs 74.4; p < 0.001) than people with type 2 diabetes
alone [30].

PLMD is repetitive cramping or jerking of the legs during
sleep. It is the only movement disorder that occurs exclusively
during sleep and is often linked with RLS, which occurs
during wakefulness. Rizzi et al. [36] reported that PLMD
prevalence was higher in people with type 2 diabetes than in
age-matched healthy volunteers (85% vs 33%). PLMD was
associated with a higher prevalence of daytime somnolence

(50% vs 8%; p < 0.01) in type 2 diabetes, but no other studies
on health outcomes related to PLMD were found.

Overall, these studies on RLS and PLMD show that sleep-
related movement disorders are highly prevalent in type 2
diabetes and have negative health outcomes.

CRSWDs

CRSWDs affect the timing of sleep either through a dysfunc-
tional biological clock system or through a misalignment
between endogenous and exogenous cues. The role of the
disturbance of the circadian clock in type 2 diabetes develop-
ment has been studied extensively in animals and sparsely in
humans [37]. To our knowledge, there are no studies on the
prevalence or related health outcomes of CRSWDs in people
with type 2 diabetes. Shift work, however, is a strong predictor
of CRSWDs. People with type 2 diabetes that perform
(night)shift work are more likely to have insufficient
glycaemic control when compared with people with type 2
diabetes performing day work: blood glucose levels of
≤7.2 mmol/l during the last 6 months (84.2% vs 71.7%; p =
0.02) [38]; and higher HbA1c levels [39, 40].

In addition, these shift workers report poorer mental health
based on the General Health Questionnaire (37.5% vs 14.2%)
and more microvascular complications (e.g. higher frequency
of diabetic neuropathy [10.5% vs 3.9%; p = 0.005] [39]),
compared with people with type 2 diabetes working dayshifts.
Studies reporting on macrovascular complications or QoL
associated with shift work in people with type 2 diabetes are
lacking. Even though based on only eight deaths, a Swedish
study in over 18,000 nurses did find a significant association
between nightshift work and risk of diabetes-related mortality
(HR 12.0 [95% CI 3.17, 45.2]) [41]. Overall, research shows
poorer health outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes
working shifts.

Treating sleep disorders in type 2 diabetes

In this section we discuss the current knowledge on treating
sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes and the effect of
treatment on health outcomes (see also Fig. 2). Sleep disorder
treatments are categorised into pharmacological and non-
pharmacological [42].

Pharmacological treatment

In one study, suvorexant, a selective orexin receptor antago-
nist, improved sleep quality and obesity-associated variables
in people with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) after 14 weeks [43]. In
another study in 75 people with type 2 diabetes and insomnia
receiving dexzopiclone or estazolam for 14 days, sleep was
improved in both groups but only fasting glucose was

significantly reduced in the dexzopiclone group. This suggests
a direct effect of dexzopiclone on glycaemic control [44]. To
date, no studies on the glycaemic effects of other hypnotics in
type 2 diabetes have been published. This would be important
as hypnotics are often prescribed to people with type 2 diabe-
tes [45]. Especially considering the frequent off-label use of
low-dose antidepressants or antipsychotics with known meta-
bolic side-effects as treatment for insomnia [46], special atten-
tion is warranted regarding the health effects of such medica-
tion in people with type 2 diabetes.

Although melatonin is generally not recommended for
treatment of insomnia in adults [47], two studies [48, 49]
investigated the effect of a melatonin agonist or prolonged-
release melatonin in people with type 2 diabetes and insomnia.
The former study (n = 36) found that sleep quality and HbA1c

improved, compared with the placebo, in people with type 2
diabetes [48], whilst the latter study (n = 42) showed an
improvement in sleep quality and stopped HbA1c further
increasing [49]. A meta-analysis on melatonin, also including
studies in the general population, supports this finding, show-
ing improved glycaemic control through melatonin supple-
mentation [50]. Although this seems promising, the exact role
of melatonin in type 2 diabetes is still controversial. Studies
have identified a common variant of melatonin receptor 1B to
be associated with impaired insulin secretion in the presence
of melatonin. This suggests that melatonin could induce insu-
lin insensitivity in the risk allele carriers and thus have adverse
effects [51].

For RLS, dopamine agonists are the first-line pharmaco-
logical option [52]. In a study of the RLS population, which

Diabetologia (2021) 64:2367–2377

2373

included people with type 2 diabetes, treatment with
pramipexole reduced RLS complaint scores (−14.2 ± 0.7 vs
−8.1 ± 0.7) and improved mood, compared with placebo
[53]. One small Japanese study [27] examined the efficacy
of pramipexole in eight people diagnosed with type 2 diabe-
tes and RLS. A decrease in RLS scores (−13.6 points [95%
CI −15.5, −11.7]) over 12 weeks and a change in HbA1c
levels of −3.2 mmol/mol (95% CI −4.4, −2.2) (−0.29%
[95% CI −0.4, −0.2]) was observed. Other pharmacological
treatments for RLS, such as other dopamine agonists,
opioids, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants and iron therapy,
have not been tested in type 2 diabetes for health outcomes
[54].

Non-pharmacological treatment

Continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular devices
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold stan-
dard for treating OSA but effects on health outcomes in people
with type 2 diabetes are inconsistent. On the one hand there are
studies showing a significant change in HbA1c (−4.4 mmol/mol
[−0.4%]; p = 0.024) [55], whilst, on the other hand, a meta-
analysis including six randomised controlled trials in 518
people with type 2 diabetes showed that CPAP did not result
in a reduction of HbA1c or fasting glucose [56]. These incon-
sistencies might be explained by the following factors: poorer
disease state, with effects being more profound in people with
higher HbA1c levels; differences in the definition of adherence
to the CPAP intervention; or CPAP use being limited to the first
half of the night when non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep
dominates, while specifically REM sleep apnoeas in the latter
half are adversely associated with glycaemic control [17].
Overall, CPAP does seem to positively affect sleep quality,
blood pressure, QoL and depression [15, 57], which in turn
could improve type 2 diabetes management and prevent
comorbidities.

Mandibular advancement devices are another treatment
option for younger people with less-severe OSA. A pilot
study from India (n = 24) showed that mandibular devices
decreased HbA1c levels (−151 mmol/mol [−14.01%]; p =
0.013) and improved sleep quality (measured by a
decrease in Epworth Sleepiness Scale of 60.7 points;
p = 0.001) over a period of 3 months [58] in people with
type 2 diabetes and mild OSA. In people with type 2
diabetes, CPAP has not been compared with mandibular
advancement devices yet. However, in the general popu-
lation, CPAP was more effective in reducing the number
of respiratory events, whereas compliance was higher for
mandibular devices [59]. Finally, surgical interventions
for OSA aimed at correcting underlying anatomical abnor-
malities in the oropharyngeal area and the effect of hypo-
glossal nerve stimulation have not been researched in type
2 diabetes.

Weight loss Weight loss is another important intervention for
OSA. A four-centre RCT [60] found that intense lifestyle
interventions were more effective than the control treatment
in reducing OSA complaints (apnoea–hypopnoea index, −5.4
vs +4.2 events/h; p = 0.000) and HbA1c levels (−7.7 mmol/
mol [−0.7%] vs −2.2 mmol/mol [−0.2%]; p = 0.000) during
1 year. Even after 10 years, the lifestyle intervention group
still showed reduced OSA complaints (apnoea–hypopnoea
index, −9.9 vs −5.9 events/h; p = 0.11). In a meta-analysis of
136 studies (n = 22,094 individuals) that examined comorbid
health outcomes in those who had bariatric surgery for weight
loss, 87.9% (1051/1195) and 76.8% (1417/1846) had no more
OSA and type 2 diabetes, respectively [61].

One study examined the effect of type 2 diabetes medica-
tion associated with weight loss on OSA in type 2 diabetes
[62]. This RCT in 36 individuals investigated the effect of
dapagliflozin, a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)
inhibitor. No significant reduction in HbA1c levels compared
with the control group was observed, but significant reduc-
tions were observed in OSA severity (−10.17 events/h;
p < 0.001), as well as systolic BP (−6.11 mmHg; p = 0.012)
and BMI (−1.21 kg/m2; p = 0.004). These results suggest that
weight loss, regardless of how the weight loss was induced,
could be a successful treatment for OSA and type 2 diabetes.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and sleep educa-
tion An elegant meta-analysis by Kothari et al. [44] identified
six studies showing that cognitive behavioural therapy for
insomnia (CBT-I) and/or sleep education improved sleep
quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(−1.31 [95% CI −1.83, −0.80]) and resulted in a non-
significant HbA1c reduction (−3.6 mmol/mol [−0.35%]; p =
0.13) in those with sleep disturbances or insomnia, including
both the general population and people with type 2 diabetes.
Only two small pilot studies on CBT-I in people with type 2
diabetes have been conducted, reporting a reduction in both
HbA1c levels after 3 weeks (2.8 ± 3.06 mmol/mol [0.26 ±
0.28%]) [63] and after 7 weeks (4.5 mmol/mol [0.41%]; p =
0.01) [64], as well as a 4.63 (p = 0.002) decrease in Beck
Depression Inventory measures [65] in the latter cohort. The
fact that CBT-I can effectively reduce depressive symptoms
has been demonstrated previously outside this specific type 2
diabetes population [66].

With regard to sleep education, two studies analysed the
effects of sleep education in people with type 2 diabetes,
although none with diagnosed sleep disorders. One study
[67] in people with type 2 diabetes and late sleeping times
showed that sleep education improved sleep quality and
reduced HbA1c (−1.5 ± 0.55 mmol/mol [−2.29 ± 2.20%] vs
−1.11 ± 0.47 mmol/mol [−2.25 ± 2.19%]; p < 0.05), compared
with controls. The other study [68] investigating people with
type 2 diabetes and abnormal or poor sleep, reported improved
sleep after sleep education but no change in glycaemic control.

Overall, these studies suggest that both CBT-I and sleep
education could contribute to improving sleep and health
outcomes in those with type 2 diabetes and sleep disorders.

Despite the limited data available, treating sleep disorders
non-pharmacologically in people with type 2 diabetes seems to
have a positive effect on health outcomes. This calls for more
extensive research on above-mentioned treatments as well as
other promising non-pharmacological interventions in those with
sleep disorders and type 2 diabetes. It is important to focus on
non-pharmacological treatment because of the previously
mentioned negative effects that some pharmacological options
may have on weight and glycaemic control [46, 69]. One inter-
esting option is bright light therapy (BLT), which is known for its
activating and synchronising effects and is used for treatment of
CRSWDs and depression. A study in 83 people with type 2
diabetes and depression, showed that BLT reduced depressive
symptoms (−3.9 [95% CI −9.0, 1.2] Inventory of Depressive
Symptomatology points) and improved insulin sensitivity
(0.15 mg/kg × min [95% CI −0.41, 0.70] measured using
hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp), although neither
change was statistically significant [70].

Possible mechanisms, clinical implications
and future research

Evidence suggests that there is a bidirectional relationship
between sleep disorders and type 2 diabetes, implying a
vicious circle. On the one hand, sleep disorders contribute to
progression of type 2 diabetes via hypothetical mechanisms,
such as decreased brain glucose utilisation, altered orexin
response, overactivation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adre-
nal axis [71], suboptimal self-care (i.e. lower medication
adherence [72]) and impaired decision-making (i.e. unhealthy
diet and sedentary behaviour) [73]. Additionally, despite the
fact that no literature on this topic was found, as sleep disor-
ders disrupt multiple metabolic processes via attenuated sleep
quality, sleep quantity or disturbances of the circadian rhythm,
it is conceivable that they affect the efficacy of drugs aimed at
lowering HbA1c. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes and asso-
ciated comorbidities, such as obesity, nightly hypoglycaemia,
increased sympathetic activity, neuropathic pain and nocturia,
may contribute to the development of sleep disorders [74].
Medication may play a role as well, with metformin, for exam-
ple, causing insomnia in about 1.7% of the people starting this
drug [75].

Finally, sleep architecture might differ between people
with and without diabetes. EEG case–control studies show
that people with type 2 diabetes indeed have lower amounts
of slow wave sleep (SWS) or more micro-arousal events [76,

77], compared with matched control participants. Since these
studies are cross-sectional, no cause–effect relationship can be
determined and the relationship may even be bidirectional.
This bidirectional relationship may explain the increased prev-
alence of sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes.

In this review, we found that insomnia, OSA and RLS are
more prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes than in the
general population [9, 15, 25–32]. Additionally, we showed
that these three sleep disorders as well as (work-related)
disturbances of the circadian rhythm negatively affect health
outcomes in at least one, and often multiple, diabetes domains,
especially glycaemic control. Given their high prevalence and
adverse consequences, it is strongly recommended to include
active assessment of possible sleep disorders in management
of type 2 diabetes. Sex differences should be taken into
account and special attention should be given to detecting
OSA, which often remains undiagnosed in type 2 diabetes.
Additionally, differentiating between RLS and conditions
mimicking RLS commands attention, as this may affect treat-
ment responsiveness [53].

In general, improving sleep in people with type 2 diabe-
tes could in turn improve glycaemic control, thus provid-
ing an important aid in preventing type 2 diabetes progres-
sion, and ultimately improve QoL [78]. Studies on the
effect of treating sleep disorders specifically in people with
type 2 diabetes are limited, based on small studies, or
absent. Most first-line treatments for sleep disorders seem
effective in people with type 2 diabetes, comparable with
the general population, but with additional positive effects
on type 2 diabetes and other health outcomes. Of high
clinical relevance are people with type 2 diabetes who
partake in shift work, who require specific guidance in
terms of meal preparation and insulin regimens in order
to achieve optimal glycaemic control.

This review is the first to summarise the literature on the
prevalence of sleep disorders in type 2 diabetes, its health
consequences and effects of treatment of sleep disorders. We
could not include information on all sleep disorders and all
treatment options due to gaps in the literature, and some data
presented should be interpreted cautiously because they are
based on few participants or specific subgroups, as is indicated
in Figs 1 and 2. A general recommendation for future studies is
therefore to further explore the impact of several sleep disorders
and overlap between them, including CRSWDs, central disor-
ders of hypersomnolence and parasomnias in people with type
2 diabetes. Moreover, special research focus is warranted on the
effects of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treat-
ment options on health outcomes in type 2 diabetes.

In conclusion, sleep disorders are highly prevalent in
people with type 2 diabetes, negatively affecting health
outcomes. Since treatment of the sleep disorder could prevent

diabetes progression, efforts should be made to diagnose and
treat sleep disorders in people with type 2 diabetes in order to
ultimately improve health and therefore QoL.
