The COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented shift in children’s daily lives. Children are increasingly 
spending time with screens to learn and connect with others. As the online environment rapidly substitutes in- 
person experience, understanding children’s neuropsychological trajectories associated with screen experiences 
is  important.  Previous  findings  suggest that  excessive  screen  use can  lead  children  to  prefer  more  immediate 
rewards over delayed outcomes. We hypothesized that increased screen time delays a child’s development of 
inhibitory control system in the brain (i.e., fronto-striatal circuitry). By analyzing neuropsychological data from 
8324 children (9–11ys) from the ABCD Study, we found that children who had more screen time showed a higher 
reward orientation and weaker fronto-striatal connectivity. Importantly, we found that the daily screen exposure 
mediated the effect of reward sensitivity on the development of the inhibitory control system in the brain over a 
two year period. These findings suggest possible negative long-term impacts of increased daily screen time on 
children’s neuropsychological development. The results further demonstrated that screen time influences dorsal 
striatum connectivity, which suggests that the effect of daily screen use is a habitual seeking behavior. The study 
provides neural and behavioral evidence for the negative impact of daily screen use on developing children.   

1. Introduction 

Childhood  is  a  critical  period  for  the  development  of  inhibitory 
control (IC) (Williams et al., 1999), where the ability to resist impulsive 
behaviors (Carlson et al., 2002; Duckworth and Kern, 2011) and focus 
on long-term goals undergoes significant changes along with the asso-
ciated  neural  circuits  (Padmanabhan  et  al.,  2011).  Studies  have 
demonstrated the negative impact of excessive screen exposure on the 
development  of  children’s  inhibitory  control  (Carson  et  al.,  2016; 
Domingues-Montanari,  2017;  Twenge  and  Campbell,  2018)  by  high-
lighting the nature of the screen platform, which often offers immediate 
benefits  with  negligible  costs  (Frey  et  al.,  2007).  For  example,  most 
screen platforms allow users to pause and skip sessions that they are less 
interested  in  and  select  content  that  they  enjoy  more.  This  increased 
accessibility  to  information  allows  children  to  pursue  immediate  re-
wards  and  feedback  (Tricomi  and  Fiez,  2012),  and,  in  turn,  this 
increased reward-seeking tendency may further weaken IC development 
(Burton et al., 2021). 

Although social organizations and governments offer guidelines to 
limit screen time for school-age children to mitigate its negative effects 
(Communications, C. o., Media, and MBE, 2016; Okely et al., 2019), the 
average use of screen time entertainment for children is continuously 
increasing (Tsiros et al., 2017; Twenge and Campbell, 2018), and has 
been  amplified  since  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  For  example,  screen 
exposure time has been escalated by at least 50% as virtual experiences 
replaced in-person interactions during the period of the Stay-at-Home 
Order (SuperAwesome, 2020). 

Recent  evidence  suggests  that  the  underlying  neural  mechanisms 
linked to the failure of IC may be associated with the imbalance between 
the  executive  networks  and  the  regions  involved  in  reward-related 
processing  (e.g.,  amygdala,  striatum,  ventral  tegmental  area)  (Casey, 
2015; Lee and Telzer, 2016; McClure et al., 2004; Metcalfe and Mischel, 
1999). Although non-clinical daily screen behaviors are understudied, 
research on screen dependency disorders (SDD) with various age groups 
(from children aged 5–11, adolescents aged 9–17, to college-aged young 
adults) suggests that the regions involved in reward-related processing

Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

and  central  executive  networks  that  may  be  affected  by  daily  screen 
behaviors are the striatum and the frontoparietal network (FPN) (Bal-
leine et al., 2007; Brand et al., 2014). 

The striatum, consisting of the caudate, putamen, and ventral stria-
tum,  integrates input from the brainstem and various subcortical and 
cortical  regions.  It  plays  a  role  in  motor  planning,  decision-making, 
motivation, and reward perception and responses (Taylor et al., 2013; 
Yager et al., 2015). Both animal and human studies have revealed that 
the striatum serves a key role in habit formation and addictive processes 
(Corbit  et  al.,  2012;  Everitt  et  al.,  2008;  Everitt  and  Robbins,  2013; 
Schwendt et al., 2009; Volkow et al., 2006). For example, in rodents, 
long access to self-administered methamphetamine gradually decreased 
dopamine  transporter  protein  levels  in  the  striatum  (Schwendt  et  al., 
2009).  Similarly,  a  human  imaging  study  using  positron  emission  to-
mography  (PET)  showed  that  the  metabolism  in  the  striatum  was 
decreased when individuals with cocaine addiction saw a cocaine cue 
compared  with  a  neutral  cue,  and  the  magnitude  of  the  reduction 
positively  correlated  with  their  craving  (Volkow  et  al.,  2006).  A 
task-based functional MRI (fMRI) showed that young adult patients with 
internet addiction exhibited less activation in the striatum compared to 
controls when they continuously won in a competitive task (Dong et al., 
2013). When compared volumetrically, increased  striatal volume was 
found in young adult smokers compared to nonsmokers (Li et al., 2015) 
and in young adults with SDD (Cai et al., 2016). Developmentally, it has 
been  reported that adolescents who play  computer games  excessively 
have greater gray matter volume and higher activation in the striatum 
compared to those who play computer games infrequently (Kühn et al., 

2011). These findings suggest that the striatum is associated with reward 
processing and screen dependency. 

The FPN, primarily comprised of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (Uddin et al., 2019), and its 
DLPFC  node  have  been  extensively  investigated  in  the  context  of 
inhibitory control and dependency behaviors as it plays a role in exec-
utive  and  regulatory  processes  in  the  brain  (Brand  et  al.,  2014;  Hare 
et  al.,  2009;  Hayashi  et  al.,  2013;  Lopez  et  al.,  2019;  Vincent  et  al., 
2008). For example, Lopez and colleagues (2019) conducted an elegant 
two-session study and found that the dieters who had to recruit greater 
DLPFC activation in the first IC exertion session showed less FPN activity 
in the subsequence food-cue task and tended to consume more ice cream 
when  their  diets  were  broken  (Lopez  et  al.,  2019).  Studies  on  screen 
dependency  disorders  (SDD)  have  also  reported  dysfunctions  in  the 
DLPFC and FPN in young adults with SDD during both resting-state and 
task-based scans (Dong et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014). During inhibitory 
tasks, the SDD group exhibited lower inhibition efficiency with lower 
activation and connectivity in the FPN regulatory regions, compared to 
the control group, suggesting that the inhibitory function was impaired 
in  the  disorder  group.  Consistently,  using  the  resting-state  functional 
connectivity approach, studies have also reported that the SDD group 
showed a greater reduction in within-network connectivity in the FPN 
compared to the control group (Dong et al., 2015). They further reported 
that the strength of the connectivity was negatively correlated with the 
Stroop effect. Taken together, these studies suggest that the function of 
the FPN is crucial for one’s control ability during reward-related pro-
cessing and is also related to screen use.

Although the critical role of a particular brain region, such as the 
FPN,  DLPFC,  or  striatum,  in  inhibitory  control  processing  has  been 
extensively  investigated  as  a  single  region  or  network,  recent  studies 
highlight the importance of neural connectivity in inhibitory processing 
at  the  level  of  large-scale  brain  systems.  In  particular,  recent  neural 
circuitry research from both animal and human studies suggests that it is 
more comprehensive to consider the between-network neural connec-
tivity as a system (Fig. 1A). The FPN and the striatum can also be viewed 
from  a  brain-systems  level,  as  they  are  structurally  and  functionally 
interconnected, being part of the fronto-striatal circuit, serving inhibi-
tory control  through  the DLPFC node  (Alexander et  al., 1986; Haber, 
2016;  Leh  et  al.,  2007;  Rubia  et  al.,  2006;  Sigman,  2017;  Zhang  and 
Iwaki, 2020). For example, functional MRI (fMRI) studies using various 
task-based indices have demonstrated a progressive maturation for IC 
functions within the fronto-striatal circuitry, with the level of activation 
in  the  circuitry  increasing  along  with  inhibition  efficiency  across 
development (Rubia et al., 2006). The findings suggest that the neural 
maturation of IC can be assessed by measuring functional coupling be-
tween  the  FPN  and  the  striatum,  and  that  these  regions  should  be 
considered together when investigating IC. 

Given previous evidence indicating that the maturation of the brain 
can be indexed by the degree of functional coupling between the FPN 
and the striatum (Balleine et al., 2007; Brand et al., 2014; Casey, 2015; 
Liston et al., 2006; Rubia et al., 2006), the main goal of the present study 
is to delineate how daily screen exposure time influences the develop-
ment of the intrinsic neurocircuitry that underlies IC (i.e., fronto-stratal 
circuitry, FPN-striatum) in children. To achieve this, we used the base-
line and post-baseline year 2 follow-up waves of the Adolescent Brain 
Cognitive  Development  study  (Casey  et  al.,  2018)  to  examine  the 
intrinsic  functional  connectivity  estimated  from  resting-state  fMRI, 
focusing  on  the  functional  connectivity  between  the  frontoparietal 
network and the striatum. We hypothesized that (1) there would be an 
alteration in the fronto-striatal connectivity in children with longer daily 
screen  exposure  time,  and  (2)  the  daily  screen  exposure  time  in  the 
baseline  year  (year  of  enrollment)  would  predict  the  strength  of 
fronto-striatal  connectivity  in  year  2  (i.e.,  post-baseline  year  2 
follow-up) as well as the change in strength between the two waves. In 
addition  to  the  effect  of  daily  screen  exposure  time  in  the  inhibitory 
control network. Furthermore, the present study also explored (3) how 
reward sensitivity affects the development of the inhibitory neural cir-
cuitry (Johnson et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2016; Kim-Spoon et al., 2016; 
Miller et al., 2004) as children become more exposed to screens. 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Participants and data preprocessing 

The current study utilized data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive 
Development  (ABCD)  Data  Repository  (https://abcdstudy.org),  which 
tracks 11,878 individuals aged 9–11 years from 21 data collection sites 
across the United States (Casey et al., 2018). The dataset was obtained 
from  the  ABCD  2.0  release  from  the  NIH  Data  Archive  (NDA, 
https://nda.nih.gov/)  in  November  2020.  The  present  study  included 
the ABCD Youth Screen Time Survey (STQ, abcd_stq01), the Sports and 
Activities  Survey  (abcd_spacss01),  the  ABCD  Youth  Behavioral  Inhib-
ition/Behavioral  Approach  System  Scales  (abcd_bisbas01),  and  the 
MRI-related  measures  include  the  processed  resting-state  fMRI  data 
(ABCD rsfMRI Network to Subcortical ROI Correlations, mrirscor02). The 
final sample size after removing missing values was 8324 for the base-
line year (interview date: 09/2016–10/2018) and 3891 for the year 2 
follow-up  (interview  date:  07/2018–01/2020).  The  children  in  the 
sample were between the ages of 108–131 months old (M = 119.28, SD 
= 7.47) in the baseline year, with 49.65% of them being female. The 
majority  of  children  were  identified  as  White  (76.99%),  followed  by 
African American (18.69%), and Others (4.32%). The ages of caregivers 
ranged  from  23  to  80  years  (M  = 40.21,  SD  = 6.75).  Further 

demographic information can be found in Table S1. 

2.2. Demographic and behavioral data 

2.2.1. Demographics survey 

The demographic information was collected through a parent-report 
questionnaire, in which caregivers reported the race and gender of both 
themselves and their child, family structure, socioeconomic status (SES, 
based on total household income), education level, and religious beliefs. 
The results of this survey can be found in Table S1. 

2.2.2. Screen time assessment 

Screen  time  was  measured  using  a  child  self-report  questionnaire 
consisting of 14 items (Barch et al., 2018; Sharif et al., 2010). The main 
12 items measured different types of screen utilization, such as watching 
TV shows or movies, watching videos, and playing video games, on a 
typical  weekday  and  weekend  day.  The  scale 
is  as  follows: 
0 = None;.25 = < 30 min; 0.5 = 30 min; 1 = 1 h; 2 = 2 h; 3 = 3 h; and 
4 = 4 + hours.  Additionally,  the  questionnaire  included  two  items 
related  to  the  experiences  in  playing  mature-rated  video  games  and 
watching R-rated movies. Daily average screen time was calculated by 
averaging the sum of weekday screen time and the sum of weekend time. 

2.3. Non-screen activities time assessment 

Activities  time  refers  to  all  sports  and  activities  other  than  screen 
time, which was measured by the parent-reported Sports and Activities 
Involvement  Questionnaire  (Huppertz  et  al.,  2016).  The  items  in  the 
questionnaire  included  31  different  types  of  sports,  music,  art,  and 
hobbies. The parents reported the number  of years, months per year, 
days per week, and minutes per session that their child spent on each 
activity.  The  activities  time  data  was  processed  in  two  steps:  missing 
value imputation and final score calculation. 

The data set had several missing values for various types of activity 
which  were  dispersed  amongst  participants.  When  discarding  in-
dividuals with missing values, 2075 samples (25%) had to be removed. 
Thus, to handle the missing values in the data set, the following treat-
ment rules were applied: 1) for missing values of the number of days per 
week spent on an activity, those data points with the same number on 
months per year were taken to calculate the median of days per week. 
This  median  number  was  used  to  replace  the  missing  values.  For 
example, in the case of soccer, if the number of days per week is missing 
and the number of months per year is 2, then all other data points where 
soccer is played for 2 months per year will be considered and the median 
of the number of days per week for these data will be calculated. This 
median score would be put into the cell of missing value. 2) for missing 
values of the number of minutes per session, all data points with the 
same number of months per year were taken to calculate the median 
score of minutes per session for missing value imputation. 

After treating the missing values, since the scale of the survey was 
different  from  the  scale  of  the  screen  time  survey,  the  daily  average 
activity time was calculated by: 1) converting the minutes per session of 
each type of activity to hours per session; 2) multiplying the hours per 
session and days per week of that activity, and dividing the result by 
seven. This was done for each type of activity; and then 3) all the activity 
times were added up to get the total daily average activity time. 

2.4. Screen-activity proportion score 

In  the  examinations,  the  non-screen  activities  time  was  used  to 

control the screen exposure time by the following calculation: 

SAPscore =

DailyScreenTime
DailyScreenTime + DailyActivityTime 

The  Screen-Activity  Proportion  (SAP)  score  reflects  how  much  in-
dividuals are exposed to the screen on a daily basis compared to non- 

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience60(2023)1012183Y.-Y. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

screen activities. A SAP score above 0.5 means that an individual spends 
more time daily with screens than on non-screen activities. 

2.5. Behavioral inhibition/behavioral activation system (BIS/BAS) scales 

Carver and White (Carver and White, 1994) suggested two motiva-
tion systems, the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral 
activation system (BAS). The BIS corresponds to the motivation to avoid 
aversive outcomes. The BAS corresponds to the motivation to approach 
reward outcomes, which can be allocated to three facets: BAS Drive, BAS 
Fun-seeking,  and  BAS  Reward  Responsiveness.  To  examine  the  rela-
tionship between individual behavioral traits in reward sensitivity, the 
degree of screen time exposure, and neural development, we included 
BAS scores, provided by the ABCD dataset. Although the BAS is divided 
into  three  subscales,  it  was  found  to  load  onto  one  single  dimension 
significantly when a factor analysis was conducted (Miller et al., 2004). 
Thus, in the current analysis, we used the sum of the three BAS subscales 
(i.e.,  BAS  Total),  as  an  indicator  of  overall  reward  sensitivity  (Kelley 
et al., 2019). 

otherwise  noted.  By  performing  the  resampling  with  replacement 
(bootstrapping  and  permutation)  techniques,  ordinary  least  squares 
(OLS)  models  can be used  without  meeting  assumptions  of  normality 
and homoscedasticity (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994; Manly, 2006). The 
statistical results from both Frequentist (i.e., p-value) and Bayesian ap-
proaches were reported. Bayesian approaches are able to evaluate the 
relative plausibility of the alternative hypothesis (H1) and the null hy-
pothesis (H0) at the same time, which can avoid the inflated false pos-
itive  rate  due  to  the  large  sample  size  (i.e.,  more  than  10,000  in  the 
ABCD  data;  c.f.,  (Sullivan  and  Feinn,  2012).  We  used  Bayes  factors 
(BF10) as support for the alternative hypothesis (H1) over the null hy-
pothesis (H0). A BF10 larger than 3 is interpreted as moderate favor for 
H1  and  a  value  larger  than 10  is  interpreted  as  a  strong  favor  for  H1 
(Matzke,  2014).  In  the  Bayesian  test,  due  to  previous  ABCD  neural 
correlate studies reporting significant results with small effect sizes (r‘s 
ranging from 0.037 to 0.07) ( Cheng et al., 2020; Karcher et al., 2019; 
Paulus  et  al.,  2019;  Rosenberg  et  al.,  2020),  a  conservative  stretched 
beta prior width of 0.3 was set in the present study to reflect the belief of 
a medium effect size. 

3. Neuroimaging data 

3.1. Imaging protocol 

The ABCD imaging protocol was integrated from three 3 T scanner 
platforms  (i.e.,  Siemens  Prisma  [66.87%],  General  Electric/GE  750 
[20.48%], and Philips [18.06%]), which used standard adult-size multi- 
channel coils that are capable of multiband echo-planar imaging (EPI) 
acquisitions  with  repetition  time  (TR)  = 0.8 s,  voxel  size  = 2.4 mm 
isotropic, 60 slices, field of view (FoV) = 216 × 216 mm, echo time (TE) 
= 30 ms, flip angle = 52 degrees. The twenty minutes resting-state data 
was acquired with eyes open and passive viewing of a crosshair. Briefly, 
the resting-state data was processed with motion correction, B0 distor-
tion  correction,  resampled  to  isotropic,  rigidly  coregistered  to  the 
structural image, and spatially normalized. Additional details about the 
scanning  protocols and  motion  correction  processing  can be  found  in 
Casey et al. (2018) and Hagler et al. (2019). 

3.2. Resting-state intrinsic connectivity between the inhibitory control 
network to subcortical ROI connectivity 

The ABCD dataset provides processed resting-state intrinsic network 
connectivity with various subcortical regions based on the subcortical 
segmentation  with  the  FreeSurfer’s  automated  brain  segmentation 
(aseg) atlas (Bruce, 2012) to the cortical networks’ that were extracted 
by  the  Gordon  parcellation  approach  (Gordon  et  al.,  2016).  More  in-
formation  on  the  MRI  processing  pipeline  and  ROI  extraction  can  be 
found in Hagler et al. (2019). For the present study, the values repre-
senting  the  strength  of  the  frontoparietal  network  (FPN)  to  striatum 
connectivity  (Fig.  1A)  were  generated  by  averaging  the  connectivity 
values of the FPN to bilateral caudate, FPN to bilateral putamen, and 
FPN to bilateral accumbens. 

4. Data analysis 

Given  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  neural  data  of  the  ABCD 
study, the effect sizes represented by correlation coefficient (r) in the 
current study are relatively small. This is in line with previous ABCD 
neural correlate studies that have also reported small effect sizes (e.g., 
Cheng et al., 2020; Karcher et al., 2019; Paulus et al., 2019; Rosenberg 
et  al.,  2020).  To  ensure  the  robustness  of  the  brain-behavior  effect 
(Marek  et  al.,  2022),  the  current  study  applied  both  Bayesian  and 
Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing approaches (Dick et al., 2021) to ensure 
the robustness of the results. 

Data analyses were performed by combining a 50,000 permutation 
resampling method and the robust method (Pernet et al., 2013), unless 

5. Results 

5.1. Association between screen exposure and fronto-striatal connectivity 

The results of the correlation analysis showed a significant negative 
association  between  the  Screen-Activity  Proportion  (SAP)  and  the 
fronto-striatal  connectivity  in  the  baseline  year  (r = (cid:0) 0.040,  95% 
CI50,000 bootstrap = [(cid:0) 0.0605, (cid:0) 0.0186], BF10 = 13.10). As the strength 
of the fronto-striatal connectivity is considered to reflect the maturation 
quality of the inhibitory control system (Rubia et al., 2006), the results 
suggest that a longer screen exposure time was significantly associated 
with the underdevelopment of the inhibitory control system in the brain 
(Fig. 1B). 

The  additional  results  from  the  group-level  comparison  between 
children  with  an  SAP  greater  than  the  90th  percentile  (SAP  = 1, 
N = 785) and children with an SAP less than the 10th percentile (SAP <
0.39, N = 788, MSAP  = 0.29, SD = 0.07) confirmed that children with 
longer screen time had significantly lower fronto-striatal connectivity, 
compared to children with shorter screen time (Fig. 1D in grey; Mhigh =
0.021,  Mlow  = 0.027,  independent  t-test:  t(1571)  = 3.043,  p = 0.002, 
Cohen’s d = 0.153, BF10 = 5.487). 

5.2. Association between screen exposure and the development of fronto- 
striatal circuitry 

The  results  of  a  correlation  analysis  using  the  year  2  neural  data 
showed  a  stronger  and  significantly negative  association  between  the 
SAP and the fronto-striatal connectivity than with the baseline neural 
data (r = (cid:0) 0.0933, 95% CI50,000 bootstrap = [(cid:0) 0.1231, (cid:0) 0.0635], BF10 
= 428995.74;  Fig.  1C).  In  addition,  the  daily  screen  exposure  time 
during the baseline year was found to predict changes in connectivity 
strength  between  the  baseline  and  year  2  (year  2  minus  baseline) 
(r = (cid:0) 0.0340,  95%  CI50,000  bootstrap  = [(cid:0) 0.0645,  (cid:0) 0.0035],  BF10  =
0.349),  although  these  changes  in  connectivity  strength  were  not  as 
robust as when examining baseline and year 2 separately (See Supple-
mental  Materials  Section  B  for  more  details  on  the  Bayes  Factor 
Robustness Check). 

As was conducted in the analysis using baseline data, there was a 
statistically significant difference in fronto-striatal connectivity between 
the high SAP group (N = 329) and the low SAP group (N = 382, MSAP =
0.28, SD = 0.08) in the year 2 data. The group effect confirmed that the 
longer screen activity is associated with a delayed development of the 
inhibitory control system in the brain (Fig. 1D in blue; Mhigh  = 0.010, 
Mlow  = 0.024,  t(709)  = 5.675,  p < 0.001,  Cohen’s  d  = 0.427,  BF10 
= 439537.31). 

Along with the result of the baseline neural correlates, the results of 

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience60(2023)1012184Y.-Y. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

the developmental data suggest that a longer screen exposure time may 
negatively affect the development of the inhibitory control system in the 
brain. 

5.3. Association between reward sensitivity, screen exposure, and the 
brain 

The  pairwise  correlations  between  reward  sensitivity  trait,  screen 
exposure, and inhibitory control (Table S4) imply that screen exposure 
time may mediate the relationship between trait reward sensitivity and 
inhibitory  control.  Therefore,  we  further  hypothesized  that  screen 
exposure time mediates the relationship between the BAS score and the 
strength of the fronto-striatal connectivity. 

A bootstrapping mediation analysis was used (Biesanz et al., 2010; 
Preacher  and  Hayes,  2008)  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  screen-activity 
proportion  mediates  the  relationship  between  the  BAS  score  and  the 
strength of the fronto-striatal connectivity. The results showed that the 
SAP  significantly  mediated  the  effect  between  the  BAS  score  and  the 
year 2 fronto-striatal connectivity (indirect effect: B = (cid:0) 6.920e-5, SE =
1.504e-5, p < 0.001, 95% CI5000  bootstrap = [(cid:0) 1.006e-4, (cid:0) 4.303e-5]; 
total  effect:  B  = (cid:0) 2.538e-4,  SE  = 8.746e-5,  p = 0.004,  95%  CI5000 
bootstrap = [(cid:0) 4.168e-4, (cid:0) 8.338e-5]), explaining 27.27% of the total 
effect. This  mediation effect was also  shown when using the baseline 
fronto-striatal  connectivity  (indirect  effect:  B  = (cid:0) 4.319e-5,  SE  =
1.229e-5,  p < 0.001,  95%  CI5000  bootstrap  = [(cid:0) 6.591e-5 (cid:0) 2.054e-5]; 
total effect: B = 2.569e-5, SE = 7.196e-5, p = 0.721, 95% CI5000  boot-
strap  = [(cid:0) 1.163e-4  1.707e-4]).  The  results  suggest  that  the  effect  of 
screen  exposure  amplifies  the  negative  impact  of  reward-seeking  ten-
dencies on the development of inhibitory control. The results with the 
inclusion  of  nuisance  variables  (sex,  age,  household  income,  and 
parental education level) are shown in Table S2. We also evaluated the 
model with BAS as a mediator, which yielded a non-significant result 
(See Supplemental Materials Section D for more details). 

5.4. Association between screen exposure and the subdivisions of the 
striatum 

Previous  studies  suggest  that  the  ventral  striatum  (i.e.,  nucleus 
accumbens,  Nacc)  is  more  related  to  simple  voluntary  behaviors 
whereas the dorsal striatum (i.e., caudate and putamen) plays a major 
role in habitual seeking and addictive behaviors (Everitt and Robbins, 
2013; Zhou et al., 2018). Thus, we additionally hypothesized that the 
longer daily screen exposure time leads children to the more habitual 
seeking behavior associated with increased dorsal striatum activation, 
and thus showing lower connectivity to FPN. To test this hypothesis, we 
also examined the screen exposure effect for each striatal subregion and 
found  that  the  longer  screen  exposure  was  more  associated  with  the 
decreased  dorsal  striatum-FPN  connectivity,  especially  in  the  year  2, 
rcaudate  = (cid:0) 0.0597,  95%  CI50,000  = [(cid:0) 0.0902,  (cid:0) 0.0292],  BF10,caudate 
= 15.738;  rputamen  = (cid:0) 0.0710,  95%  CI50,000  = [(cid:0) 0.1010,  (cid:0) 0.0414], 
BF10,putamen = 245.716). In contrast, there was no such association with 
the  ventral  striatum  (rNacc  = (cid:0) 0.0257,  95%  CI50,000  = [(cid:0) 0.0560, 
0.0047], BF10,Nacc  = 0.070. (See Supplemental  Materials Section  E  for 
more details). 

5.5. Validating the association between intrinsic FPN-striatum 
connectivity and the function of inhibitory control 

The  current  study  adopted  FPN-striatum  to  represent  the  intrinsic 
neurocircuitry  that  underlies  inhibitory  control.  Several  behavioral 
indices  of  inhibitory  control  were  utilized,  including  the  behavioral 
performances  in  the  Flanker  Inhibitory  Control  and  Attention  Test 
(Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974), the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (Everitt 
et al., 2008), the Stop Signal Task (Logan, 1994), ADHD trait (Achen-
bach  and  Edelbrock,  1991),  and  the  Cash  Choice  Task.  The  task  de-
scriptions  and  details  of  results  can  be  found  in  the  Supplemental 

Materials Section G. Although the associations between the strength of 
FPN-striatum  connectivity  and  the  behavioral  indices  of  inhibitory 
function  had  a  small  effect  size,  the  direction  of  the  coefficients  was 
consistent  across  all  variables.  This  implies  that  the  resting-state 
FPN-Striatum connectivity and the effect of screen exposure were able 
to anchor to the behavioral indices of inhibitory function. 

6. Discussion 

In our two-year follow-up study, we examined the impact of daily 
screen exposure time on the neural inhibitory control network (ICN) in 
children. Our findings indicated that a longer daily screen exposure time 
was  negatively  associated  with  the  strength  of  the  fronto-striatal  cir-
cuitry. In addition,  we  found that a  longer  screen exposure  time pre-
dicted a protracted development of the ICN, as evidenced by a negative 
correlation between screen exposure time and the strength of the fronto- 
striatal connectivity at year 2 and the change in strength between the 
two  waves.  Moreover,  our  results  revealed  that  screen  exposure  time 
played a mediating role in the effect of reward sensitivity on the two 
waves  of  fronto-striatal  connectivity,  suggesting  that  longer  screen 
exposure may amplify the negative effect of reward sensitivity on ICN 
development.  Notably,  longer  screen  exposure  was  associated  with 
reduced connectivity between the FPN and the dorsal striatum in year 2, 
which is implicated in habitual addictive seeking behavior. 

Our findings on the inverse fronto-striatal connectivity in both cross- 
sectional and longitudinal data extend previous work by demonstrating 
that the screen exposure effect is not linked only to a single region, but 
can  influence  the  interaction  between  regions  and  systems  (Balleine 
et al., 2007; Brand et al., 2014). Previous studies using fMRI and DTI 
suggest  that  increased  positive  functional  connectivity  between  the 
striatum and the frontal executive network is associated with enhanced 
efficiency  of  IC  across  development  (Liston  et  al.,  2006;  Rubia  et  al., 
2006). Thus, negative fronto-striatal connectivity among children with 
higher  screen  exposure  may  indicate  a  decreased  sophistication  of 
functional coupling between these networks as the brain matures. This 
novel  finding  is  supported  by  studies  on  substance  addiction.  For 
example,  both  DTI  and  functional  connectivity  techniques  revealed  a 
negative functional coupling of the fronto-striatal connectivity during 
smoking  cue-induced  craving 
in 
alcohol-dependent patients compared to healthy controls (Becker et al., 
2017). In a similar manner, increased daily screen time may undermine 
the development of the fronto-striatal network, as our findings showed a 
negative change in the fronto-striatal connectivity in individuals with 
relatively increased daily screen time. 

(Yuan  et  al.,  2017)  and 

Consistent with previous findings (Becker et al., 2017; Kohno et al., 
2014; Motzkin et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2017), we 
found a detrimental effect of the negative fronto-striatal coupling in the 
inhibitory  process.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  there  is  contra-
dictory  evidence  indicating  that  longer  exposure  to  addictive  stimuli 
was associated with positive fronto-striatal connectivity (Hu et al., 2015; 
Koehler  et  al.,  2013).  For  example,  a  recent  resting-state  fMRI  study 
showed that pathological gambling patients have increased connectivity 
between  ventral  striatum  and  the  superior/middle  frontal  gyrus 
(Koehler  et  al.,  2013),  and  cocaine  addiction  patients  showed  an 
increased fronto-striatal connectivity (Hu et al., 2015). Furthermore, it 
has been demonstrated that the negative coupling between frontal and 
limbic networks is associated with better  self-control ability (Lee and 
Telzer, 2016). However, given the heterogeneity of study populations 
and approaches, these inconsistent findings in fronto-striatal coupling 
are not unexpected. Some of the disparate reports may be due to distinct 
addictive behaviors or the status of those behaviors, such as the period of 
‘at  risk’,  current  dependence,  and  the  period  of  recovery  (Pariyadath 
et  al.,  2016).  Moreover,  the  use  of  different  target  regions  within 
fronto-striatal  circuits  may  explain  these  contradictory  findings.  For 
instance,  one  study  showed  a  positive  coupling  by  using  the  ventral 
striatum, whereas another showed a negative coupling by employing the 

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience60(2023)1012185Y.-Y. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

caudate and dorsal striatum (Wang et al., 2013). 

Importantly, the current study revealed a difference in the connec-
tivity between each subdivision of the striatum and the frontal executive 
network.  High  screen  exposure  resulted  in  a  more  negative  dorsal 
striatum coupling to the frontal executive network relative to the ventral 
striatum, particularly in the year 2 data. Evidence from both rodent and 
human studies has shown a functional shift from the ventral to the dorsal 
striatum  underlying  the  transformation  of  voluntary  behaviors  into 
compulsions,  suggesting  a  dysfunction  of  the  IC  (Everitt  et  al.,  2008; 
Everitt and Robbins, 2013; Zhou et al., 2018). In the rodent model, as 
cocaine  seeking  became  habitual  for  the  rats,  dopamine  release  was 
increased  in  the  dorsal,  but  not  the  ventral,  striatum  (Everitt  et  al., 
2008). Similarly, a study with cannabis-dependent males showed lower 
dorsal striatum connectivity in the frontal regions compared to controls 
(Zhou  et  al.,  2018).  Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  the  consequence  of 
long-term prolonged daily screen exposure may have a similar effect to 
that of habitual addictive seeking behaviors (Dong et al., 2021), leading 
to a shift in frontal network connectivity from the ventral to the dorsal 
striatum. 

We also demonstrated the generalizability of the negative effect of 
screen exposure by controlling the sex and age of the children as well as 
their parental SES and education level. Previous studies have shown that 
there are demographic differences in screen exposure in children and 
adolescents, for example, boys reported higher overall screen use than 
girls  (Nagata  et  al.,  2022),  and  youth  from  lower  SES  and  minority 
backgrounds  engaged in  more  screen  activity (Reid  Chassiakos et  al., 
2016).  Additionally,  literatures  also  suggests  associations  between 
parental  SES  and  both  children’s  executive  function  (Lawson  et  al., 
2018)  and  the  development  of  the  fronto-striatal  circuitry  during 
adolescence (Li et al., 2022). By taking these factors into account, the 
current study demonstrated that the delaying effect of screen exposure 
on the development of the ICN is a general phenomenon that exists in 
children during preadolescence. 

Due  to  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  neural  data  in  the  ABCD 
study, the effect sizes represented by the correlation coefficient in the 
current  study  are  relatively  small,  particularly  for  the  baseline  year. 
However, it has been reported that the true size of brain-behavior effects 
is smaller than what has been previously reported and anticipated (Dick 
et al., 2021; Marek et al., 2022). In addition, the small effect size of the 
present study could be due to the target behavior (i.e., daily screen use), 
as it is expected that the effect of daily behavior is smaller compared to 
the  effect  of  addictive  behaviors  (e.g.,  sampling  from  the  population 
with SDD). Interestingly, the present study suggests that the impact of 
daily  screen  use  may  be  growing,  although  it  was  relatively  small  to 
begin with. This is indicated by the larger effect size of the year 2 data 
(r = (cid:0) 0.093) compared to the baseline year (r = (cid:0) 0.040). The children 
in the current study were approximately 10 years old at the baseline, 
marking  the  beginning  of  early  adolescence.  According  to  theoretical 
models  and  empirical  studies  (Casey,  2015;  Rubia  et  al.,  2006),  the 
development of the fronto-striatal circuitry occurs throughout adoles-
cence. Taken together, it is hypothesized that the habit of daily screen 
use may have a long-term and cumulative effect on adolescents. How-
ever,  further  examination  of  this  hypothesis  requires  additional  data 
from future waves of the ABCD study. 

The current two-year follow-up study demonstrates that prolonged 
daily  screen  exposure  can  alter  functional  connectivity  patterns,  sug-
gesting that it may have long-term effects on the development of the ICN 
and can amplify the negative impact of reward-seeking tendencies on 
the development of the ICN in adolescents. Despite the relatively small 
effect  found  in  the  intrinsic  brain-behavior  associations,  the  results 
consistently  showed  that  the  intrinsic  fronto-striatal  connectivity  was 
negatively  associated  with  behavioral  measures  of  inhibitory  control 
outcomes. At present, we are limited by the currently released processed 
data in the ABCD study, as we have not been able to access the processed 
inhibitory task-based cortical network to subcortical regions data, which 
would allow us to observe how this altered intrinsic ICN works during 

inhibitory tasks. In future studies, it will be important to examine how 
daily  screen  exposure  influences  connectivity  in  the  fronto-striatal 
network during actively inhibitory processing. 

In conclusion, the present study found that the neural coupling be-
tween the frontoparietal network and the striatum decreases in children 
with prolonged daily screen exposure. Importantly, we also found that 
this excessive daily screen exposure may augment the impact of chil-
dren’s reward-seeking tendencies on the inhibitory control network, and 
the consequence of prolonged daily screen exposure has a similar effect 
to that of habitual addictive seeking behaviors on the inhibitory control 
system in the brain. Given that the virtual movement is irreversible and 
expanding in the modern and future life, it is imperative to conduct more 
research on the impact of daily screen exposure.
