Metacognitive therapy (MCT) has been shown to be a promising treatment approach
for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The changeability of metacognitions by
(metacognitive) treatment and its relevance to treatment outcome is, however, still

response prevention (ERP) in a randomized-controlled pilot trial (n = 24 patients with
OCD) changes OCD-speciﬁc metacognitions of thought fusion beliefs, beliefs about
rituals and stop signals, and (2) if these changes are relevant for the treatment outcome
in terms of patient- and therapist-rated OCD symptoms. ANOVA with pretest, posttest

INTRODUCTION

Metacognitive therapy (MCT) (1) has been suggested as one promising treatment approach for
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (2). Pilot and single case studies found support for the
eﬃcacy for MCT for OCD [e.g., (3, 4)]. In the largest uncontrolled trial (5), 80% of OCD patients
treated by MCT yielded a clinically signiﬁcant change at follow-up. Also in a routine clinical service,
MCT applied as a group treatment was found to be eﬀective in OCD, with higher clinical response
rates than a group cognitive behavior therapy (6). We recently reported results of a controlled pilot
study showing that MCT was equally eﬀective as the gold standard for treatment of OCD, exposure
with response prevention (ERP) in reducing OCD symptoms (7). MCT required less treatment time
than ERP in this study.

This raises the question of which mechanisms of change might be relevant for the treatment
outcome in OCD with metacognitive approaches. Speciﬁcally, three obsessive-compulsive- (OC-)

Metacognitive Change During Psychotherapy in OCD

speciﬁc metacognitive beliefs are supposed to be modiﬁed in
MCT for OCD: thought fusion beliefs about the meaning and
power of intrusive thoughts (e.g., “Thinking about harming some
will make me do it”), positive beliefs about the need to carry out
rituals (e.g., “I need to perform my rituals otherwise I will never
have peace of mind.”) and subjective stop signals for monitoring
the actions (e.g., “An important signal when I can stop my rituals
is when I feel calm”). Contrary to cognitive models of OCD [e.g.,
(8)] that focus on dysfunctional cognitive belief contents like
perfectionism and inﬂated responsibility, MCT thereby aims to
change thought processes instead of thought contents. Empirical
evidence for the relevance of the OC-speciﬁc metacognitions
for OCD comes from a wide range of studies [for a review,
see Fisher (2)]: Cross-sectional studies showed that OC-speciﬁc
metacognitions predict OCD symptoms, even when controlling
for cognitive beliefs [e.g., (9)]. In addition to prospective
studies (10), experimental studies [e.g., (11, 12)] support the
causal role of metacognitions in OCD. In comparison studies
individuals with OCD reported signiﬁcantly
[e.g., (13, 14)],
more positive beliefs about rituals and stop signals than other
(non-)clinical groups.

To date, three studies have investigated metacognitions as
a potential mechanism of change in the treatment of OCD
(15–17). All studies found a prediction of treatment outcome
by a change in metacognitions, with two studies (15, 17)
showing a better prediction by changes in metacognitions than
by changes in cognitive beliefs in ERP. However, Solem et al.
(17) and Kim et al. (16) investigated general and not OC-
speciﬁc metacognitions. General metacognitions, such as positive
beliefs about the usefulness of worry, are supposed to be relevant
for a wide range of mental disorders rather than only OCD
(18). In the study by Grotte et al. (15), only thought fusion
beliefs and beliefs about rituals, but not stop signals were
considered as mechanisms of change. However, stop signals
have been found to be especially relevant for OCD symptoms
[e.g., (9)]. In addition, the authors did not investigate whether
MCT is especially beneﬁcial
in changing these beliefs, and
they only used self-rated measures of OCD symptoms as the
treatment outcome.

The present study aimed to investigate the changeability
of OC-speciﬁc metacognitions by MCT and ERP, and its
relevance to treatment outcome in OCD. To investigate
the relevance of
these metacognitions in comparison with
other supposedly relevant mechanisms of change, general
metacognitions and dysfunctional cognitive beliefs were also
considered in the respective analyses. Speciﬁcally, the following
hypotheses were examined:
(1) both MCT and ERP can
reduce OC-speciﬁc metacognitions, albeit with MCT achieving
a higher decrease of dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs than
ERP. (2) Changes in OC-speciﬁc metacognitive beliefs are
for the treatment outcome in OCD as measured
relevant
with global OCD symptom scores.
(3) Changes in OC-
speciﬁc metacognitive beliefs are more relevant than changes
in general metacognitions and dysfunctional cognitive beliefs
for the treatment outcome. The treatment outcome of OCD
symptom scores was measured by both self- and clinician-
rated measures.

METHOD

Participants
The sample consisted of 24 German-speaking individuals
with the main diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-IV.
They represented a subsample of the completer sample (n
= 28) of a pilot trial comparing ERP and MCT (7). Four
patients of the completer sample of the pilot trial did not
complete questionnaires measuring OC-speciﬁc metacognitions
at posttreatment so that they were not considered in the current
analyses. Inclusion criteria were: (a) diagnosis of OCD according
to DSM-IV, and (b) 18–65 years of age. Exclusion criteria were
as follows: (a) life time diagnosis of substance dependence,
psychosis, neurological conditions, and (b) intellectual disability.
The German version (19) of the Structured Clinical Interview
(SCID) was administered to assess DSM-IV-TR current and
lifetime disorders.

Procedures
The data of the current study is part of a pilot trial comparing
ERP and MCT (7), which was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01483339). The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of both universities, the University of Marburg
and the University of Leipzig. Participants were recruited from
consecutive referrals to the universities’ outpatient clinics. After
screening of eligibility and informed consent, patients were
randomly assigned to ERP or MCT. Random assignment was
stratiﬁed by a diagnosis of comorbid depression. During the
follow-up period of 3 months, three short telephone booster
sessions following a ﬁxed protocol took place.

of
ten treatment sessions was extended to 14 sessions to
allow for adaptions to individual needs of patients. Verbal
methods (e.g., socratic questioning about evidence, reframing
advantages), detached mindfulness and behavioral experiments
(e.g., ritual postponement) were applied during MCT to change
metacognitions. According to the ERP protocol (20), prolonged
ERPs were implemented in therapist-guided in-session and
between-session self-exposures after preparing and planning the
individual treatment (e.g., psychoeducation about habituation,
hierarchy of anxiety-provoking situations). An overview of the
contents of both treatment protocols is presented in Glombiewski
et al. (7). In both conditions, 14 individual weekly sessions
were oﬀered. In ERP, one session could last longer than 50 min
depending on the individual length of exposure. Thereby, the
number of treatment hours (á 50 min) was signiﬁcantly higher
in the ERP than in the MCT condition (see Table 1).

Measures
OC-Speciﬁc Metacognitive Measures
The Thought-Action Fusion scale [TAF scale; (21)] has 19
items assessing thought-action fusion beliefs. It was designed
to measure beliefs that having an unwanted intrusive thought

TAF”) or that it is almost the moral equivalent of carrying out that
act (“Moral TAF”). The thought fusion beliefs of thought action
fusion as measured by the TAF scale are found to be relevant
for OCD (22). For the English version as well as the German
version (23) of the TAF scale, good psychometric properties were
reported. Similar to these ﬁndings, a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.91
indicated a very good internal consistency in the sample of the
current study.

The Beliefs about Rituals Inventory [BARI; (24)] is a 12-
item questionnaire that assesses positive beliefs about rituals.
For the English version, McNicol and Wells (25) reported good
psychometric properties.

The Stop Signals Questionnaire [SSQ; (26)] has 12 items
assessing importance of certain criteria in deciding to stop
carrying out rituals. For the English version of the scale, the
internal consistency was good, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.89.

For both the BARI and the SSQ,

the English versions
have been translated into German by applying the back-
translation technique (27), and a close match of the back-
translated with the original versions has been conﬁrmed by the
authors of the BARI and the SSQ. The German versions of
the BARI and SSQ showed good internal consistencies, with
Cronbach’s alphas of 0.85 and 0.76–0.78 in an OCD sample
of a previous study (13) and in the sample of the current
study, respectively.

Other Measures
OCD symptoms as the main treatment outcome were measured
using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [Y-BOCS;
(28)], a 10-item, semi-structured interview. Y-BOCS interviews
and ratings were conducted by the treating clinicians at pre-
treatment, post-treatment and follow-up, interrater reliability
with an independent rater was very high [r = 0.93–0.99, (7)]. In
order to additionally measure OCD symptoms with a self-rating
measure, the German Palatine Revision of the Padua Inventory
[PI-PR; (29)], a 24-item questionnaire, was used. It showed a
good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85 in the
current study.

Statistical Analyses

diﬀerences between treatment conditions in the three OC-
speciﬁc metacognitions were examined by calculating separate
repeated measures analyses of variances1 with thought action
fusion, beliefs about rituals and stop signals as the dependent
variables (DV). Time (pre-, post-treatment, and follow-up)
and group (ERP vs. MCT) were considered as independent
variables (IV) to investigate diﬀerence by treatment condition.
The relevance of OC-speciﬁc metacognitions as mechanisms
of change was investigated by calculating change scores for the
three OC-speciﬁc metacognitions from pre- to post-treatment.
To investigate these change scores in relation to alternative
supposed mechanisms of change, change scores for the cognitive
belief domains of “perfectionism/intolerance of uncertainty”
and “overestimation of threat/responsibility” as well as general
metacognitions were also calculated. In order to identify variables
with relevance for the treatment outcome, correlations between
the change scores and Y-BOCS and PI-PR post-treatment and
follow-up scores, respectively, were calculated in a ﬁrst step. In
a second step, only change scores with signiﬁcant correlations
with treatment outcome measures were included as IV in the
respective regression analyses. Moderate correlations between
outcome measures (r = 0.29–32) justiﬁed to perform diﬀerent
regression analyses for the outcome variables. Four separate
regression analyses were calculated for the DVs of Y-BOCS
or PI-PR at post-treatment or follow-up. In all regression
analyses, pre-treatment scores of the Y-BOCS or PI-PR were
entered in a ﬁrst step. Since the DVs did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer
between treatment conditions (all ps > 0.428), the variable of
treatment condition was not included in the regression analyses.
Assumptions for these regression analyses (no multicollinearity,
homoscedasticity, independent errors) were met as indicated
by variance inﬂation factors < 1.4, the Durbin-Watson test and
according histograms and P-P plots. The relevance of OC-speciﬁc
metacognitions as mechanisms of change was investigated by
applying four analyses leading to a high risk of familywise error
rate. However, by including only predictors with signiﬁcant
correlations with treatment outcome and considering alternative
predictors (like cognitive beliefs), these analyses are already
fairly conservative. Thereby, all results are reported by applying
an unadjusted alpha level of 0.05. In addition, ﬁndings, which
are also signiﬁcant when applying an adjusted alpha level after
Bonferroni correction (α = 0.0125), are speciﬁcally highlighted.

1Multilevel models using maximum likelihood estimation, with a ﬁxed intercept,
an indicator variable for condition, an indicator variable for time and a condition
x time interaction term showed similar results as these ANOVAs with a signiﬁcant
eﬀect of time for all OC-speciﬁc metacognitions and a signiﬁcant condition × time
interaction term for the variable of thought action fusion.

RESULTS

Change in OC-Speciﬁc Metacognitions
From Pre- to Post-treatment
The eﬀects sizes for changes in OC-speciﬁc metacognitive
beliefs (as well as treatment outcomes of OCD symptoms) are
displayed in Table 2. The analyses of variances revealed that
both treatments led to a signiﬁcant change from pre- to post-
treatment in all three OC-speciﬁc metacognitions. In addition,
there was a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the group x time interaction
for the outcome variable of thought fusion beliefs, with the
MCT treatment condition showing a stronger eﬀect in reducing
thought fusion beliefs than ERP. For beliefs about rituals and
stop signals, the group x time interaction was not signiﬁcant,
indicating that there was no diﬀerence between treatments in
reducing these OC-speciﬁc metacognitions (Table 3).

Supplementary Table 1. Regarding correlations between the
change scores and the treatment outcome on the clinician-rated
Y-BOCS, only changes in beliefs about rituals were signiﬁcantly
correlated with Y-BOCS treatment outcome at post-treatment (r
= −0.43, p = 0.048) and at follow-up on trend level (r = −0.42,
p = 0.053). With regard to correlations between change scores
and treatment outcome on the self-rated PI-PR, changes in stop
signals, general metacognitions and the cognitive belief domain
“perfectionism and certainty” were signiﬁcantly correlated with
PI-PR post-treatment outcome (all rs ≥ −0.42, ps ≤ 0.043). In
addition, only changes in stop signals signiﬁcantly predicted
PI-PR treatment outcome at follow-up (r = −0.54, p = 0.011).

In the regression analyses, the respective pre-treatment score
was entered in step 1 of every regression analysis. Only change
scores with signiﬁcant correlations with the treatment outcome
were included in the next steps. There was only a trend for the
additional block of changes in beliefs about rituals from pre- to
post-treatment in predicting Y-BOCS post-treatment outcome
(1r² = 0.10, p = 0.081). Since the correlation of changes in
beliefs about rituals with Y-BOCS treatment at follow-up was
close to signiﬁcance, a regression analysis including BARI as
IV and Y-BOCS at follow-up as DV was conducted and it also
showed a trend for the additional block of the changes in beliefs
about rituals in predicting Y-BOCS follow-up outcome (1r² =
0.097, p = 0.092).

To examine whether changes in stop signals make a signiﬁcant
contribution over and above changes in general metacognitions
and cognitive beliefs in predicting the post-treatment outcome of
the self-rated PI-PR, we added changes in general metacognitions
and the cognitive beliefs domain “perfectionism and certainty”
in a second block and changes in stop signals in a third block.

explained signiﬁcant additional variance of post-treatment PI-
PR (1r² = 0.13, p = 0.047) and were the only independent
contributor in the last model. To examine whether changes
in general metacognitions and cognitive beliefs would make a
signiﬁcant contribution over and above changes in stop signals,
we reversed the entry of the blocks 2 and 3 of the last regression
analysis. The second block of changes in stop signals explain
signiﬁcant additional variance of post-treatment PI-PR (1r² =
0.18, p = 0.033), whereas there was only a trend of the third block
of changes in general metacognitions and the cognitive belief
domain of “perfectionism and certainty” in explaining variance
of post-treatment PI-PR (1r² = 0.18, p = 0.074). Regarding the
prediction of the follow-up outcome of the PI-PR, the block of
changes in stop signals explains signiﬁcant additional variance
(1r² = 0.30, p = 0.011) after entering pre-treatment scores of
the PI-PR in step 1. This ﬁnding is also signiﬁcant by applying the
adjusted alpha level after Bonferroni correction. The results of the
ﬁnal model for the separate regression analyses with the change

scores from pre- to post-treatment as IVs and Y-BOCS and PI-PR
post-treatment scores as DVs are presented in Table 4.

DISCUSSION

this study was the ﬁrst

to investigate
To our knowledge,
the magnitude and impact of changes of
the OC-speciﬁc
metacognitions thought fusion beliefs, beliefs about rituals and
stop signals after MCT and ERP treatment for OCD. The results
showed that both MCT and ERP signiﬁcantly reduced all three
OC-speciﬁc metacognitions. Regarding thought fusion beliefs,
a signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect indicated a higher decrease after
MCT than ERP treatment. Changes in stop signals from pre-
to post-treatment signiﬁcantly predicted patient-rating OCD
symptoms at post-treatment and follow-up. These changes
were even predictive of treatment outcome after controlling

level for clinician-rating OCD symptom levels at post-treatment
and follow-up.

The present study extends previous ﬁndings (15, 17) by
showing that besides general metacognitions and OC-speciﬁc
metacognitions (like beliefs about rituals), stop signals can
be changed by treatment and that these changes are relevant
for the treatment outcome in OCD. Cross-sectional studies
already found that stop signals are more frequently reported by
obsessional washers than non-clinical controls (14) and predict
OCD symptoms after controlling for other (general and OC-
speciﬁc) metacognitions and cognitions [e.g., (9, 13)]. Stop
signals and beliefs about rituals both constitute the level of
metacognitions in the metacognitive model of OCD, which
guide the response to negative appraisals of thoughts. Being
directly related to rituals, they might constitute a vulnerability
factor for falling back into previous behavioral responses in
critical situations and might thereby be important to change
by treatment. This would also explain why changes in these
metacognitions in the current study do not only predict
treatment outcome at post-treatment but also at follow-up 3
months later.

Not only MCT but also ERP seems to be able to reduce
these OC-speciﬁc metacognitions. Beliefs about rituals and stop
signals might not have to be explicitly discussed during treatment
as it is applied in MCT. The experience of going through
exposures without using rituals might question positive beliefs
about the necessity to perform rituals. Patients might replace
subjective with more objective criteria for stopping behaviors

when they learn to go without rituals during exposures. However,
more treatment time was needed to achieve changes in these
metacognitions using ERP. MCT seems to be more time-eﬃcient
by directly targeting these OC-speciﬁc metacognitions, and this
eﬃcient change might also be advantageous for attaining a
similar reduction of OCD symptoms as in ERP in less treatment
time [cf., (7)].

for

In line with previous studies (15, 17), our ﬁndings suggest
that a change in OC-speciﬁc metacognitions might be more
important
the treatment outcome than a change in
dysfunctional cognitive beliefs. Accordingly, treatments should
additionally or alternatively focus on thought processes and
not necessarily thought contents,
like it is implemented in
the cognitive therapy. However, changes in the cognitive belief
domain “perfectionism and certainty” were predictive on trend
level for treatment outcome in the present study. In addition, a
prediction of post-treatment outcome was not signiﬁcant after
applying the adjusted alpha level with Bonferroni correction.
Future research is necessary to disentangle a possible interplay
between a change of metacognitions and a change of cognitions,
which are only considered as by-products of metacognitions
in MCT (1). Our ﬁndings additionally indicate that targeting
OC-speciﬁc rather than general metacognitions is beneﬁcial for
treatment outcome in OCD.

pronounced in diﬀerent clinical groups [e.g., (33)], compared
with non-clinical groups [e.g., (13)]. The metacognitive model
states that the activation of fusion beliefs only leads to negative
appraisals of the thought as dangerous, which further result in
OCD symptoms through the activation of beliefs about rituals
and stop signals. Thereby, fusion beliefs might not necessarily
cause OCD symptoms and their reduction might not necessarily
result in a better treatment outcome in OCD. However, since
Grotte et al. (15) found a prediction by fusion beliefs, future
studies should further investigate their predictive value and
increased changeability by MCT in the treatment of OCD.

One of the study’s advantages is that the changeability of OC-
speciﬁc metacognitions was investigated in a trial comparing
MCT with ERP. MCT for OCD speciﬁcally aims to change these
metacognitions, whereas ERP is supposed to work on other
mechanisms of change. The high treatment ﬁdelity we found
in the pilot trial comparing ERP and MCT by Glombiewski et
al. (7) suggested that MCT-speciﬁc components were delivered
according to protocol without contamination. The current study
could thereby shed ﬁrst light on an improved eﬀect of MCT
in reducing OC-speciﬁc metacognitions. Another advantage of
the study is the investigation of all OC-speciﬁc metacognitions,
which allowed for an integrated view of their impact on the
treatment outcome. The additional consideration of general
metacognitions and cognitive beliefs enables us to evaluate
the predictive meaning of diﬀerent dysfunctional beliefs being

related to diﬀerent clinical
metacognitive vs. cognitive beliefs during treatment).

implications (e.g.,

One major limitation is the small sample size. In addition,
there might be further variables that are predictive of treatment
outcome but have not been considered in the present study.
For instance, the therapeutic relationship has been discussed as
an important general factor for the outcome in psychotherapy.
Especially in a treatment setting in which patients have to
go through diﬃcult situations (like exposures or behavior
experiments), the relationship between the patient and therapist
might be a crucial factor for the treatment success. A strong
therapeutic alliance might also improve patient adherence (e.g.,
with regard to homework compliance) which was found to be
a robust predictor of ERP treatment outcome in OCD [for a
review, see Wheaton and Chen (34)]. However, the present study
aimed to focus on factors that are relevant according to speciﬁc
treatments like MCT and cognitive therapy.

The present study has clinical implications suggesting that
ERP and MCT might share metacognitive mechanisms of change.
As one of them, stop signals were partly predictive of OCD
treatment outcome. MCT treatment techniques like directly

challenging beliefs about rituals and stop signals by using verbal
methods and behavioral experiments can lead to a time-eﬃcient
reduction of these metacognitions and subsequently of OCD
symptoms. In addition, the present ﬁndings suggest placing an
increased focus on metacognitions dealing with the behavioral
the importance of
response than on metacognitions about
thoughts. It seems to be beneﬁcial to work on processes of
thoughts instead of thought contents in the treatment of OCD.
The present study ﬁndings justify a larger trial with a focus on the
mechanisms of metacognitions, their relevance for the treatment
outcome and the treatment elements aﬀecting them.
