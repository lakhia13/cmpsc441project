Abstract

Anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders are prevalent and poorly treated. The salutary 
benefits of resistance exercise training, a potential alternative therapy, are well-established, but 
mental health effects are understudied. This review summarizes the most rigorous evidence 
regarding efficacy of resistance exercise and provides a primer for putative psychobiological 
mechanisms.

Resistance Exercise for Mental Health: A Primer

Anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders are prevalent and debilitating public 
health burdens for which successful treatment is limited (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/
statistics/any-mood-disorder). The salutary benefits of resistance exercise, or muscle-
strengthening exercise involving exerting force against a load (Box 1), are well-established. 
However, the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of resistance exercise have remained 
understudied compared to aerobic activity; importantly, the psychobiological mechanisms, 
which further elucidate how and why resistance exercise training (RET) improves mental 
health, are poorly understood. Thus, this brief review synthesizes the most rigorous evidence

of the efficacy of RET for anxiety and depression and serves as a primer for the putative 
mechanisms which may contribute to, and potentially underlie, these effects.

Effects of RET on Anxiety Symptoms & Disorders

Evidence, particularly from gold standard randomized controlled trials (RCTs), support 
the anxiety-reducing effects of exercise training among otherwise healthy adults, adults 
with chronic conditions, and Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) [1]; 
however, this work has largely focused on aerobic exercise. Meta-analyses of the most 
rigorous evidence from RCTs that aggregate effects into a digestible overall expected mean 
effect size have shown that RET results in small-to-moderate improvements in anxiety 
symptoms among both healthy and chronically-ill adults [2]. RET for subclinical or clinical 
anxiety disorders is critically understudied. The only rigorously designed RCT of RET 
among adults with a clinical anxiety disorder showed that six-weeks of twice-weekly lower-
body RET elicited clinically meaningful reductions in the severity of Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD) (i.e., six of 10 RET participants no longer met criteria for GAD following 
intervention) and moderate-to-large improvements in associated signs and symptoms [3]. 
However, this and other available trials have been limited by small sample sizes, generally 
inconsistent reporting of important trial characteristics, including adherence, compliance, 
and medication use, poor reporting of features of the RET stimulus, particularly intensity, 
session duration and overall RET dose, and poor ecological validity (i.e., RET that someone 
could/would engage in outside a study setting).

Effects of RET on Depressive Symptoms & Major Depressive Disorder

Exercise effects on depression are comparatively more well-studied than anxiety, primarily 
owing to a misconception that exercise may act as a stressor to elicit anxiety. Evidence from 
quantitative syntheses support the depression reducing, or antidepressant, effects of aerobic 
exercise training among otherwise healthy adults, adults with a chronic condition, and 
among depressed patients [4], but less is known about RET for depressive symptoms and 
disorders. A formative quantitative review found that RET elicited significant and clinically-
meaningful (i.e., >50% reduction in severity from baseline, comparable to antidepressant 
medication and behavioural therapies) reductions in depressive symptoms among healthy 
and chronically-ill adults [5]. Importantly, near one-standard-deviation, large improvements 
were found among clinically depressed adults [5], and, aerobic exercise training and 
RET resulted in similar improvements when compared directly in the same participant 
samples. Similar to the evidence for anxiety, these findings should be interpreted in the 
context of limitations of the available trials, including variable, and often small, samples, 
poor reporting of intervention characteristics, especially features of the RET and overall 
dose, a predominant focus on self-reported severity, a lack of direct comparisons with 
other established therapies, and poor ecological validity for RET. To this end, recent 
RCT evidence, though from a small sample who were not clinically depressed, showed 
that ecologically-valid, guidelines-based RET elicited large depressive symptom reductions 
among young adults with and without subclinical GAD, for which depressive symptoms are 
highly comorbid and worsen severity [6].

Future Implications

Though the available evidence from largely small samples of variable quality supports 
that RET improves anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders (though disorders 
are scarcely studied), there is a critical need for confirmatory, definitive RCTs that 
adequately address limitations regarding ecological validity, minimal dose thresholds for 
benefits, and the comparative effectiveness of RET to established frontline therapies. 
Moreover, even less is known regarding putative mechanisms of action for RET in both 
anxiety and depression. The following section addresses some of the most provocative 
target mechanisms, particularly overlapping mechanisms, for RET effects on anxiety and 
depression.

Plausible Psychobiological Mechanisms of RET’s Mood Effects

As originally detailed in a seminal review [7], several plausible psychobiological 
mechanisms have been hypothesized for RET’s anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. 
These are consistent with those generally posited for aerobic exercise, including effects 
on monoamine neurotransmitters and pathways, interactions of immune and serotonergic 
pathways, neurotrophic factors, neuroanatomical structure and function, and neurovisceral 
integration, or heart-brain crosstalk (Box 2).

Potential RET-specific mechanisms also include increases in insulin-like growth factor 1 
(IGF-1). For example, animal models have shown increased hippocampal IGF-1, which may 
be a marker of neuroplasticity and involved in mood enhancement, in rats following RET 
[8]. Another provocative mechanistic target is abnormal cerebral blood flow, which has been 
hypothesized to underlie poor mental health (e.g., the “vascular depression” hypothesis). 
The few RET trials that have investigated this mechanism suggest RET may improve global 
blood flow, improve blood flow in specific regions, and decrease cerebral pulsatility, a 
measure of the discontinuity of blood flow [9]. A third emerging potential mechanism 
involves the benefits of controlled breathing that is inherent to proper RET technique 
to ensure adequate muscle oxygenation (i.e., inspiration during eccentric contraction, 
exhalation during concentric contraction). A recent meta-analysis showed deliberately 
controlled breathing resulted in small-to-moderate improvements in self-reported stress, 
anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms [10]. Mechanisms underlying the effects 
of controlled breathing are likely complex. Effects may be achieved through temporal 
coherence of respiratory, blood pressure, and cardiac oscillations which improve vagally-
mediated heart rate variability to produce a cascade of neural activation that plausibly 
contributes to mental health benefits [11].

As symptoms of depression and anxiety have considerable overlap and high comorbidity, the 
hypothesized mechanisms of action of RET are likely, to some degree, shared in achieving 
RET’s antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Were a specific mechanism identified that 
only mediates the antidepressant or anxiolytic benefits of exercise, much could be learned 
about the pathophysiology of depression and/or anxiety, as well as the neurobiology of 
exercise. As a whole, animal modelling has largely informed hypothesized mechanistic 
targets, with limited data in humans, particularly with clinical conditions; thus, focused

studies of human-subjects that concurrently consider peripheral (i.e., blood-based, heart-rate 
variability, skeletal muscle gene expression) and central (i.e., brain-based, oxygenation, 
functional connectivity in frontal and limbic regions) mechanisms are clearly needed to 
specifically determine what or which mechanism(s) are predominantly involved in the 
anxiolytic and antidepressant responses to RET.

Concluding remarks

In sum, RET is shown to produce significant anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in healthy 
and in clinical populations (i.e., GAD and MDD, though from small-sample trials to date). 
There is substantial promise in evaluating the mechanisms underlying these effects of 
RET due to the ability for future interventions and practice to target these mechanisms 
to maximize their effects and potentially optimize prescription via precision medicine 
approaches. Recent improvements in animal modelling of resistance exercise will also allow 
for better mechanistic insights at the cellular and molecular level. Based on extant small-trial 
data, there is an urgent need for larger trials that evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness 
of RET for anxiety and depression with concurrent evaluations of the most promising 
mechanisms (IGF-1, cerebrovascular adaptation, and controlled breathing) to advance this 
field.

Resistance Exercise Training (RET) Conceptualization, Guidelines & 
Descriptive Epidemiology

Aerobic exercise, or planned, repetitive, and purposeful skeletal muscle actions through 
activities like walking, running, and cycling, is likely more familiar to the general public 
and more well-studied in the physical and mental health literature. Muscle strengthening 
exercise, sometimes referred to as strength/weight/resistance training or exercise, is a 
voluntary activity that includes the use of weight machines, exercise bands, hand-held 
weights, or one’s own body weight to exert force against a load. Acute resistance exercise 
refers to a single bout/session of resistance exercise, and RET refers to the regular 
accumulation of resistance exercise bouts/sessions to generate a training response to 
enhance or maintain muscular fitness, physical, and/or mental health. Current guidelines 
recommend completion of at least eight resistance exercises targeting the major muscle 
groups, performing at least two sets of eight to 12 repetitions each with proper form, at 
least two days per week, progressing the intensity (i.e., resistance/weight) across time. 
The available large-scale epidemiological studies indicate that adults generally report 
engaging in little, if any, muscle strengthening exercise, with very few meeting the 
recommended two sessions per week [12]. Therefore, there is substantial opportunity to 
increase RET participation.

Neurobiological/Psychobiological Mechanisms of Exercise Training

A seminal review of the neurobiology of exercise [7] highlighted several mechanistic 
pathways by which exercise training may improve brain health, and, subsequently 
mental health. In the context of biological plausibility, to support exercise training 
as a viable therapeutic, what is known regarding the neurobiological consequences 
of exercise must align with what is known about the etiology of mental illness, 
though a lack of consistent underlying pathological neurobiological abnormalities in 
mental illness hinders this effort. Nevertheless, exercise training clearly influences 
brain plasticity, facilitating neurogenesis, neuroadaptation, and neuroprotection, plausibly 
through effects on neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor and 
insulin-like growth factor. Exercise training also attenuates neural responses to stress 
in brain regions/pathways that regulate peripheral sympathetic activity (supporting 
‘heart-brain cross-talk). Thus, exercise training can mitigate central and peripheral 
sympathetic activity and selectively modulate norepinephrine, and other neurochemicals, 
plausibly mitigating mental health consequences of cardiometabolic insults, oxidative 
stress, and immunosuppression. Moreover, exercise training provides protection against 
ischemic, traumatic, and toxic brain insults through its neuroprotective effects. Multiple 
mechanisms involving complex integrated responses from multiple metabolic and 
neurochemical pathways among skeletal muscle, the spinal cord, and brain regions 
support ways that exercise may influence the central nervous system and mental health 
[7].
