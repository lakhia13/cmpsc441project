Introduction

Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED) and avoidant/
restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) are severe psychiatric disorders.1 Our 
understanding of the brain has dramatically changed over the past century with the 
development of human in vivo brain imaging. While earlier studies collected cerebrospinal 
fluid samples to study for instance neurotransmitter metabolites, brain research now uses 
techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study brain gray (GM) and white 
matter (WM) volumes, cortical thickness and surface area. Also based on MRI, are diffusion 
weighed (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which measure water diffusion to test 
WM tract integrity and strength of WM connectivity between brain regions.2 The most 
commonly used functional brain imaging technique is functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI), which measures changes in local blood flow as a proxy for brain activation.
3 Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) use radioactive ligands to study glucose metabolism or neurotransmitter receptor 
distribution. Neurobiological research in EDs holds promise to develop a medical model 
perspective to reduce stigma and help develop better treatments.4

structure has generally matured to adult levels while avoiding effects from aging or illness 
chronicity.5 The US National Library of Medicine database PubMed was searched for brain 
research studies done in youth or young adults. Methodologies have much improved over the 
past five years, and we present neurobiological research that highlights our current 
knowledge of ED neurobiology with a particular emphasis on studies from the past five 
years.6

Neurochemical Studies

PET imaging showed higher serotonin 1A-receptor binding in AN and BN when ill and after 
recovery suggesting state independent alterations. The serotonin 2A-receptor, in contrast, 
was normal in ill AN but lower after recovery, suggesting dynamic adaptations.7,8 BN did 
not show significant dopamine D2-receptor group differences versus controls, but lower 
striatal dopamine release was associated with higher binge-eating frequency.9

Hormones or neuroactive peptides such as sex hormones or gut hormones also affect brain 
response.10 Those substances that regulate body homeostasis are often altered during the ill 
state of EDs which may disturb normal food reward circuits.10 Neuroendocrines and -
peptides such as fat cell-derived leptin or ghrelin from the gastric mucosa stimulate or 
dampen brain dopamine response and alterations in this system could furthermore alter food 
approach in AN and BN.11,12 Those hypotheses to date, however, rely mostly on basic 
research to date. Cytokines, markers of inflammatory processes, have been found altered and 
meta-analyses indicate a pattern of elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha in AN, while the 
data on other cytokines in are somewhat mixed, with no alterations in BN.13,14 Whether 
those markers are relevant for ED illness development, maintenance or recovery remains 
elusive. Cytokines are elevated in obesity, but no data exist for BED or ARFID.

Gray Matter Volume and Cortical Thickness

Earlier studies suggested that brain volume is universally reduced in AN, but brain structure 
studies in EDs have found smaller, larger, or no differing volumes across varying brain 
regions versus controls.15–17 Reduced cortical volumes in AN are related to illness severity 
and normalize during weight recovery.18–23 Studies that controlled for short-term 
malnutrition and dehydration found larger left orbitofrontal cortex as well as right insula 
volumes in adolescents and adults with AN.24,25

The literature on BN is smaller, and GM structure studies in adolescents or young adults 
with BED or ARFID are lacking. Mixed results in BN show either larger or normal regional 
GM volumes,26,27 while another study found lower temporo-parietal GM surface area due to 
lower WM.28 Binge-eating/purging frequency may reduce cortical volume or thickness,29,30 
and a study that controlled for acute malnutrition and binge-eating/purging found larger left 
orbitofrontal and insula volume, but smaller bilateral caudate and putamen volumes.25

Those results highlight that food restriction, binge-eating and purging change brain 
structure. Insula and orbitofrontal cortex are important for taste perception and (food) reward 
valuation, and alterations could interfere with the drive to eat. Whether brain volume 
alterations drive ED behaviors remains unclear.31 Future studies will test whether ARFID is

associated with similar structural brain changes as AN and whether BED is associated with 
reduced brain volume as in obesity or regionally higher volume measures as in BN.32

White Matter Volume, Integrity and Structural Connectivity

Similarly to GM studies, there has been inconsistency with higher or lower localized or 
overall WM volumes in EDs.24,25,33,34 Altered astrocyte density exhibited in an animal 
model of AN could be a mechanism for low WM volume in EDs due to malnutrition and 
dehydration.35 Water diffusion MRI can be used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA),36 
thought to reflect axonal integrity. Adolescent AN showed higher, lower or no FA group 
differences.37–40 Lower FA normalizes with weight restoration, and it is unclear whether FA 
has implications for ED behaviors.41,42 The small literature on WM integrity and FA in BN 
indicates lower FA across widespread WM pathways across the whole brain, including lower 
FA between insula, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and hypothalamus.43–45 Those regions are 
important for taste, reward, and energy homeostasis regulation, and altered WM connections 
could affect food intake regulation. Studies that estimated number of WM connections found 
in AN and BN greater structural WM connectivity between insula, orbitofrontal cortex and 
ventral striatum, consistent with AN after recovery.43,46 Duration of illness correlated 
positively with fiber connectivity in AN, suggesting that the longer ED behaviors caused 
WM damage (FA reduction), the more this was compensated during recovery by increasing 
fiber connectivity.46

Functional and Effective Connectivity

The so-called default mode network (DMN, posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, medial 
temporal, and inferior parietal cortices) is involved in interoception and “self-relevant 
mentalizing” (making sense of each other and ourselves). Studies found elevated DMN 
connectivity in AN,47–49 possibly driven by lower blood glucose.50 The salience network 
(SN, anterior cingulate, insula and orbitofrontal cortex) orients the organism to support food 
approach.51 AN showed higher connectivity between dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate 
gyrus, and BN stronger connectivity between dorsal anterior cingulate and medial 
orbitofrontal cortex.52,53 Higher dorsal anterior cingulate to precuneus connectivity in AN 
and BN correlated positively with body shape questionnaire scores, implicating brain 
regions at the interface of executive function and vision.52 Others found greater resting 
functional connectivity in AN between ventral striatum and frontal cortex, implicating 
reward processing and decision-making circuits.37 Functional connectivity during food and 
non-food passive picture viewing was higher in AN and BN in insula, and in BN in 
orbitofrontal cortex,54 while young adults with AN showed lower SN connectivity during 
sugar tasting.55 Those patterns suggest dysfunctional SN functioning and maybe 
predisposing to food restriction. The executive control network (ECN, prefrontal cortex) 
showed lower connectivity and lower and higher connectivity in AN between insula and 
frontal regions suggesting imbalances between networks.56,57

All in all, higher and lower functional resting-state connectivity has been observed in EDs 
compared to controls, implicating networks associated with executive function, reward 
processing, and perception, supporting the notion of those circuits being altered in EDs. SN 
alterations during resting state could perturb a “readiness” to approach food while elevated

DMN activity could indicate an inability to come to an internal restful state.58 Studies in 
ARFID and BED are lacking.59

Effective connectivity, the hierarchical or directional activation between brain regions, was 
higher in AN from medial orbitofrontal cortex and insula to inferior frontal gyrus,57 and 
from orbitofrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens,37 implicating taste reward circuits. Two 
studies found that effective connectivity during tasting sugar was directed from ventral 
striatum to the hypothalamus in AN and BN, while in controls the hypothalamus drove 
ventral striatal activity.43,60 This was interpreted as a possible mechanism for top-down 
control in EDs to control homeostatic information and override hunger signals.

Task-Based fMRI Studies

Reward System—Food is a salient stimulus or “natural reward”, and reward pathways 
similar to substances of abuse are activated when we desire, approach or eat food.61 
Important regions in this circuitry include ventral striatum (receives midbrain dopaminergic 
input, drives motivation and reward approach), orbitofrontal cortex (reward valuation), and 
anterior cingulate (error monitoring, reward expectation).61 Several but not all studies in the 
past in adolescents or young adults found altered reward system response in AN to food or 
body related visual stimuli.62–66 In a recent study where participants saw positively valenced 
(non-food and non-body) pictures and were asked to regulate their emotions, ventral striatal 
activity correlated with body-related ruminations and negative affect in AN, suggesting that 
emotion regulation interacts with both ED thoughts and depressive feelings.67 In a delay 
discounting task (choosing between immediate smaller or delayed larger rewards) the AN 
group responded faster, and lower activation in AN in cingulate and frontal regions indicated 
a more efficient control circuitry.68 In another study, youth with AN learned better in 
response to punishment, but associated brain-activation was similar versus controls.69–71 
Receiving stimuli unexpectedly has been associated with brain dopamine response and early 
evidence indicated heightened response to unexpected pleasant or unpleasant stimuli in AN.
72,73 A paradigm that has been closely associated with brain dopamine response is the 
prediction error model, a learning paradigm where individuals learn to associate 
unconditioned taste with conditioned visual stimuli.74 In two studies using monetary or taste 
stimuli, unexpected receipt or omission was reflected in higher insula and striatal brain 
response in adolescents with AN versus controls. Brain activation predicted weight gain 
during treatment, but short-term weight restoration was not associated with normalization of 
brain response.75,76 Those studies suggested heightened dopamine-related brain response 
that does not easily normalize with weight recovery.76 In summary, altered reward circuits in 
AN may be associated with altered learning and brain dopamine function, and traits such as 
sensitivity to punishment could be predisposing.60

In BN, negative affect positively correlated with striatal and pallidum brain response during 
milkshake receipt.77 Low mood may, therefore, enhance reward value of food stimuli in BN 
and trigger binge-eating. Others showed in BN less frontal cortical, ventral striatal and 
hippocampus activation that correlated with binge/purge frequency in a task that provided 
monetary reward when navigating through a maze.78,79 Therefore, altered learning,

executive control and reward brain response could be effects of both abnormal brain 
development and BN illness behavior.

Perception and Interoception—Self-perception of being fat while being underweight 
could be due to abnormal central interoception neurocircuitry or primarily driven by 
cognitive-emotional processes. Some studies in AN implicated parietal and occipital cortices 
when viewing self or others.80,81

Neuropsychological studies implicated altered non-visual perception, such as haptic (tactile) 
perception, proprioception (sense of one’s position in space) or interoception (sense of 
internal organs) in AN, showing altered insula response in AN.82 This suggested that the 
insula may have an essential function in the intersection between interoception and 
cognitive-emotional processing in AN. Some studies implicated taste perception in EDs. In 
AN, the insula, (primary taste cortex) poorly distinguished between taste stimuli,83 and in 
studies on binge-eating, bitter taste led to higher medial prefrontal electroencephalography, 
or umami taste more strongly activated the insula in BN, while hedonic ratings were lower.
84,85

Cognition—During a reversal learning task involving positive and negative feedback, AN 
changed behavior strategy more frequently after negative feedback, related to cingulate 
activation.86 During the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test for cognitive flexibility testing, AN 
had higher activation during behavior change in frontal, parietal and occipital regions, but 
lower activation during learning or maintaining rule-based behavior.87 Visual attention in 
BN led to higher activation in parieto-occipital regions but lower response in the DMN 
versus controls and behavior control was associated with lower activation in the anterior 
cingulate.88 Behaviorally, groups performed similarly in those studies, and the meaning of 
altered brain function in the context of normal behavioral response needs further study. 
Individuals with BN showed worse cognitive performance when food images were 
intermixed with the task procedures while premotor cortex and dorsal striatum were more 
strongly activated compared to controls, suggesting a distressing effect.84 In another study, 
BN showed that positive emotions improved performance on response inhibition.89 
Therefore, mood may be an important factor for recovery.

Social function and stress—During a self and other-social evaluation task, anxiety and 
body shape concerns correlated inversely in AN and controls with prefrontal and cingulate 
brain response, implicating those regions.90 Gentle touch or intimate visual stimuli were 
rated less pleasant in AN compared to controls, and associated with lower caudate or parietal 
activity, suggesting reduced reward experience.91,92

Microbiota and Microbiome

The human microbiota, up to 100 trillion symbiotic microbial cells are primarily bacteria in 
the gut.93 Their collective genomes are called microbiome.94 There are well known neural 
connections between gut and brain, and those organisms may affect psychiatric disorders 
including EDs.95 Various studies in AN have found alterations compared to controls in 
microbial composition, and microbe diversity in AN may correlate with BMI and also, for

instance, blood insulin levels.96–98 Healthy competitive athletes had the highest number of 
microbiota species compared to ED and control groups, significantly higher versus both AN 
and obese individuals, and dietary fiber, vitamin D and magnesium intake correlated 
positively with microbiota species.99 However, microbiota diversity also normalizes with 
weight recovery, and it is unclear whether microbiota could be causal for illness behavior 
aside from ED behaviors altering gut microbiota.97,98,100 No studies exist in other EDs. 
However, BN and BED were associated with antimicrobial medication use suggesting a role 
for the immune system. In summary, microbiota and the microbiome are an emerging field 
that could provide an important aspect of illness pathophysiology in EDs.

Conclusions

This article summarizes our current knowledge on the neurobiology of eating disorders 
(Figure 1). While this field has grown significantly over the past decade, it is still small 
overall and the studies available often have small participant numbers, limiting power and 
study reliability and many results have not been replicated. The authors argue here for 
rigorous well-powered studies to find consensus across research labs to identify treatment 
targets for EDs.101 Another critical issue is that research in BED and especially ARFID is 
mostly an unexplored area of neurobiological research. Nevertheless, the body of research in 
EDs identified the importance of short-term impact of ED behaviors especially on brain 
structure, and most consistently brain reward pathways are implicated in altered brain 
activity across EDs. The latter is a promising target for treatment development.

SYNOPSIS

Eating disorders are severe psychiatric illnesses with a typical age of onset in 
adolescence. Brain research in youth and young adults may help us identify specific 
neurobiology that contributes to the onset and maintenance of those disorders. This 
article provides a state-of-the-art review of our current understanding of the neurobiology 
of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. This includes brain structure and function 
studies to understand food restriction, binge-eating or purging behaviors, cognitive and 
emotional factors contributing to eating disorders, as well as interoception. Binge-eating 
disorder and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder are also discussed, but the literature 
is still small for the latter two disorders.

KEY POINTS

Eating disorders are severe psychiatric illnesses with complex 
biopsychosocial background.

Brain imaging now allows is study the living human brain.

Understanding the neurobiology of eating disorders holds promise to develop 
more effective treatments.

New research allows us start develop models for brain function and food 
avoidance.
