- Identity and Cultural Dimensions

The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning Plus (LGBTQ+*) community represents a diverse range of identities and expressions of gender and sexual orientation. In addition to these identities, members of the community are diverse in terms of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality and socioeconomic class. This intersectionality — the combined and overlapping aspects of a persons’s identity — brings diversity of thought, perspective, understanding and experience. This complexity is important to understand as a unique and valuable aspect of the LGBTQ+ community that can result in a strong sense of pride and resiliency.

While belonging to the LGBTQ+ community can be a source of strength, it also brings unique challenges. For those who identify as LGBTQ+, it’s important to recognize how your experience of sexual orientation and gender identity relates to your mental health.

Although the full range of LGBTQ+ identities are not commonly included in large-scale studies of mental health, there is strong evidence from recent research that members of this community are at a higher risk for experiencing mental health conditions — especially depression and anxiety disorders. LGBTQ+ adults are more thantwice as likelyas heterosexual adults to experience a mental health condition. Transgender individuals arenearly four times as likelyas cisgender individuals (people whose gender identity corresponds with their birth sex) individuals to experience a mental health condition.

LGBTQ+ youth also experience greater risk for mental health conditions and suicidality. LGBTQ+ youth are more thantwice as likelyto report experiencing persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness than their heterosexual peers. Transgender youth face further disparities as they aretwice as likelyto experience depressive symptoms, seriously consider suicide, and attempt suicide compared to cisgender lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and questioning youth.

For many LGBTQ+ people, socioeconomic and cultural conditions negatively impact mental health conditions. Many in the LGBTQ+ community face discrimination, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, harassment and family rejection, which can lead to new or worsened symptoms, particularly for those with intersecting racial or socioeconomic identities.


### Important Risk Factors Of LGBTQ+ Mental Health


Coming OutPositive changesin societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ people act as a protective factor for mental health. However, this shift in acceptance has meant that many LGBTQ+ youth “come out” or share their sexual orientation or gender identity at younger developmental ages, which can impact their social experiences and relationships. This can have negative mental health impacts, particularly for youth who are not in supportive environments.

RejectionFor many in the LGBTQ+ community, coming out can be a difficult or even traumatic experience. It can be difficult to cope with rejection of something as personal as one’s identity from family or close friends, within the workplace, or in a faith community.

According to a 2013survey, 40% of LGBTQ+ adults have experienced rejection from a family member or a close friend. A 2019school climate surveyshowed that 86% of LGBTQ+ youth reported being harassed or assaulted at school, which can significantly impact their mental health. And a 2022report from The Trevor Projectfound that just 37% of LGBTQ+ youth identified their home as an LGBTQ+-affirming space.

TraumaHomophobia, biphobia, transphobia, bullying and feeling identity-based shame is often traumatic for people.

The LGBTQ+ community faces many forms of discrimination, including: labeling, stereotyping, denial of opportunities or access, and verbal, mental and physical abuse. They are one of the most targeted communities byperpetratorsofhate crimesin the country.

Such discrimination can contribute to asignificantly heightened riskfor PTSD among individuals in the LGBTQ+ community compared to those who identity as heterosexual and cisgender.

Substance UseSubstance misuse or overuse, which may be used as a coping mechanism or method of self-medication, is a significant concern for members of this community. LGBTQ+ adults arenearly twice as likelyas heterosexual adults to experience a substance use disorder. Transgender individuals arealmost four times as likelyas cisgender individuals to experience a substance use disorder. Illicit drug use issignificantly higherin high school-aged youth who identify as LGBTQ+ or are unsure of their identity, compared to their heterosexual peers.

HomelessnessIt is estimated that LGBTQ+ youth and young adults have a120%higher risk of experiencing homelessness — often the result of family rejection or discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. This risk is especially high among Black and Native American/Alaska Native LGBTQ+ youth. Many members of the LGBTQ+ community face the added challenge of finding homeless shelters that will accept them, and experience elevated rates of harassment and abuse in these spaces.

SuicideMany people in this community struggle in silence — and face worse health outcomes as a result.

- The LGBTQ+ population is at ahigher riskthan the heterosexual, cisgender population for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.

- High school students who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual are more thanfour times as likelyto have attempted suicide compared to their heterosexual peers.

- 40%of transgender adults have attempted suicide in their lifetime, compared to less than 5% of the general U.S. population.

Inadequate Mental Health CareThe approach to sexual orientation and gender identity in mental health care often groups together anyone in the LGBTQ+ community, when these communities are considered at all. This method can be problematic as each sub-community faces unique challenges, rates of mental illness and experiences.

The LGBTQ+ community encompasses a wide range of individuals with separate and overlapping challenges regarding their mental health. Other identity factors including race and economic status can affect the quality of care they receive or their ability to access care.

Additionally, members of this community may face harassment or a lack of cultural competency from potential providers. These experiences can lead to a fear of disclosing sexual orientation and/or gender identity due to potential discrimination or provider bias.

Confronting these barriersandmental health symptoms with an LGBTQ+-inclusive mental health provider can lead to better outcomes, and ultimately recovery.


### How To Find The Right Mental Health Professional


There are important considerations when seeking LGBTQ+-competent care. Here are a few steps to find a professional.

Step 1: Think About What You’re Looking For

While considering the type of mental health professional you are looking for, it is important to consider the following:

- If you want a provider who shares specific parts of their identity with you, you may be able to find out if your provider is LGBTQ+ by reading their profiles or websites.

- It may be easier to find a provider that has a baseline competency in LGBTQ+ issues, rather than one who specializes in LGBTQ+ care. If your mental health conditions are not rooted in sexual orientation and/or gender identity, it may not be necessary for the provider to be specialized in LGBTQ+ issues.

- If you are transgender and are seeking a mental health professional to write a letter of support for gender affirming medical care or for legal documentation change, you should seek a provider who understands the insurance or legal requirements of support letters.

Step 2: Gather Referrals

Many websites that provide mental health professional directory searches, including insurance company websites, have filters that allow you to show only mental health providers who have a specialty or competency in working with LGBTQ+ patients. Many insurance companies also have information numbers, and they can help find you providers that are in your area, accept your insurance and list LGBTQ+ competency in their profile.

These directories, however, are not the only way to find LGBTQ+ competent providers. Many LGBTQ+  organizations and community groups provide directories that have been vetted by other LGBTQ+ people. You may want to check with:

- Local LGBTQ+ community centers

- Local LGBTQ+ health centers

- LGBTQ+ community groups such as equality groups, health collectives, social organizations, support groups

- Affirming places of worship

Step 3: Make the Call

Some people find it difficult to make an initial call to a mental health provider. Transgender people in particular may feel uncomfortable talking on the phone due to concerns about being misgendered due to their natural voice range. If you find you’re reluctant to call, ask a friend or family member to call for you.

When making the initial call, you may want to ask the provider then if they have previous experience with LGBTQ+ patients or if they are comfortable working with LGBTQ+ patients. You can wait to ask this during the first appointment, but you may save time and energy by asking from the start.

Step 4: Ask Questions:

Providers expect and welcome questions from their patients or clients, since this helps them better understand what is important in their treatment. In your first visit with a mental health provider, be forthright about the fact that you are looking for an LGBTQ+ competent provider. You should not feel like you need to educate providers about the basic concepts of LGBTQ+ identities. To prevent that, consider asking the following questions:

- My identity is ______. What experience do you have working with people with that identity?

- What experience do you have with the LGBTQ+ community?

- Do you have any specific training or certifications that relate to working with LGBTQ+ clients?

Additionally, to avoid selecting a practitioner that uses the discredited and harmful practice of conversion or reparative therapy — aimed at changing a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity — you may also want to ask, “Do you provide conversion therapy or reparative therapy?” and follow up by asking how they feel about that specific practice to make sure you are not selecting a provider that advocates for this type of treatment.

Step 5: Build a Relationship

It may take several calls to find the right provider for you. If the provider does not have the knowledge or experience that you are looking for, you can move on to the next provider and keep searching.

Remember, you are seeking a person that is going to help you improve your mental health. By stating your needs and asking the right questions, you can find someone who can mindfully address your identity throughout the duration of your treatment.
