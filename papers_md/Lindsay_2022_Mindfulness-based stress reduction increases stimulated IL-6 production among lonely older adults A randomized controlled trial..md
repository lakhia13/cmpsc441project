Abstract

Loneliness is a potent psychosocial stressor that predicts poor health and mortality among 
older adults, possibly in part by accelerating age-related declines in immunocompetence. 
Mindfulness interventions have shown promise for reducing loneliness and improving markers 
of physical health. In a sample of lonely older adults, this two-arm parallel trial tested whether 
mindfulness training enhances stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, a measure of innate 
immune responsivity. Lonely older adults (65–85 years; N=190) were randomized to an 8-week 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) 
intervention. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated production of IL-6 was measured in vitro by 
blinded outcome assessors at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Mixed-
effects linear models tested time (pre, post, follow-up) by condition (MBSR vs. HEP) effects. 
As predicted, a significant time × condition effect on stimulated IL-6 production was observed 
across pre, post, and follow-up timepoints. Significant MBSR vs. HEP differences emerged from 
pre- to post-intervention (p=.009, d=.38) and from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up (p=.017, 
d=.35), with larger increases in IL-6 production following MBSR compared to HEP. No study-
related adverse events were reported. Results show that mindfulness training may be effective for 
boosting innate immunocompetence among lonely older adults. Given that immunocompetence 
tends to decline with age, mindfulness training may help to counteract the effects of aging and 
psychosocial stress on infection risk and recovery from injury.

Loneliness is a potent psychosocial stressor and robust predictor of poor health and 
mortality among older adults1. Loneliness is thought to accelerate age-related declines in 
immunocompetence2, which may contribute to morbidity and mortality risk. Mindfulness 
interventions have shown promise for reducing loneliness3,4 and improving a variety of 
physical health outcomes5. By training an attitude of equanimity with present-moment 
experience, including the distress associated with feeling alone, mindfulness interventions 
are thought to diminish loneliness and social threat4; in turn, mindfulness interventions show 
potential to interrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic-adrenal-
medullary (SAM) stress response cascades6 in ways that may improve immunocompetence7. 
To date, few studies have focused on whether mindfulness interventions can alter innate 
immunocompetence8–10, and none to our knowledge have examined this question in the 
context of healthy aging. In a large sample of lonely older adults, the current study tests 
the impact of 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) vs. control Health 
Enhancement Program (HEP) interventions on stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, an 
in vitro measure of innate immune responsivity to bacterial challenge.

In response to infection or injury, a rapid and robust innate immune response contributes 
to the elimination of harmful pathogens, repair of damaged tissue, and restoration of 
health11,12. This response is initiated when receptors on monocyte/macrophage cells 
recognize pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns and activate intracellular 
signaling pathways that upregulate local production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as 
IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. For example, toll-like receptor 4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS), a component of many gram-negative bacteria, and activates NF-kB signaling to 
upregulate cytokine production, which coordinate the local innate inflammatory response13. 
A robust initial inflammatory response defends against infection14 and facilitates later stages 
of wound healing15,16; when IL-6 production is prevented in mice, for example, wound 
healing is three times slower17.

It is widely accepted that aging is associated with declines in immune system function, 
including decreased inflammatory competence18–20. Cells isolated from older adults and 
stimulated with LPS show attenuated production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α when compared 
to cells from younger adults21–24, possibly due to lower levels of toll-like receptors 
on immune cells18,25. In turn, age-related decreases in stimulated cytokine production 
contribute to increased infection risk26, delayed recovery from injury27, and heightened 
mortality risk28.

Critically, chronic psychosocial stress may accelerate aging-related immune function 
decline2,29. Midlife and older adults exposed to chronic psychosocial stress, such 
as bereavement and dementia caregiving, show lower stimulated cytokine production 
in association with slower wound healing compared to lower stress adults30–33; 
glucocorticoids released over periods of chronic psychosocial stress may attenuate 
inflammatory responsivity in ways that impair wound healing30,31,34. Loneliness is one 
such psychosocial stressor that may dysregulate the body’s ability to mount a robust immune 
response. Loneliness has been associated with lower LPS-stimulated IL-1β and TNF-α 
production—cytokines that induce IL-6 production as part of a coordinated inflammatory 
response35—as well as slower wound healing36,37. Similarly, depressive symptoms—

which often accompany loneliness38—have been related to lower LPS-stimulated cytokine 
production39–42. Overall, existing literature showing associations of age and psychosocial 
stress with lower stimulated cytokine production and slower wound healing suggest that 
aging and chronic psychosocial stress may act synergistically to downregulate innate 
immunocompetence. Loneliness may exacerbate age-related declines in immunocompetence 
with implications for infection and healing.

This report examines the effect of mindfulness training on inflammatory competence among 
lonely older adults. LPS-stimulated production of IL-6 was measured in vitro in a sample of 
lonely older adults (N=190) before, after, and 3 months following 8-week MBSR or control 
HEP interventions. Our primary hypothesis tested whether MBSR would increase the 
stimulated IL-6 response from pre- to post-intervention and 3-month follow-up compared 
to HEP, reflecting improved inflammatory competence. Second, to indirectly evaluate the 
assumption that higher IL-6 production reflects immunocompetence in this older adult 
sample, we also tested the prediction that pre-intervention IL-6 production would be lower 
(i.e., compromised) among participants reporting higher loneliness at baseline. Exploratory 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to test whether participants higher in loneliness at 
baseline would show larger changes in IL-6 production and whether changes in loneliness 
associate with changes in IL-6 production.

Materials and Methods

Participants

190 lonely older adults aged 65–85 years were enrolled and randomized in this two-
arm parallel trial (see Table 1 for baseline characteristics and Figure 1 for CONSORT 
flow chart). The study design and outcomes were pre-registered with Clinical Trials 
identifier NCT02888600. The parent trial was funded through NIH project R01AT008685, 
with primary outcomes including loneliness and circulating biomarkers to be reported 
separately43. This report describes stimulated IL-6 production collected as part of an 
NIH postdoctoral National Research Service Award (F32AT009508; PI: Lindsay). Primary 
findings from this supplemental project show that MBSR buffers post-intervention increases 
in glucocorticoid receptor resistance observed following HEP44.

Eligible participants were healthy, lonely, meditation-naïve adults aged 65 years or older. 
Participants were recruited from the greater Pittsburgh area through the Center for Social 
and Urban Research, the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, and the Pepper 
Registry at the University of Pittsburgh; Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes at University 
of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University; outreach events at local organizations and 
senior housing; and newspaper, radio, bus, email, and mailed advertisements. The study was 
advertised for older adults interested in ways to reduce stress and increase social connection. 
Potential participants were screened for the following eligibility criteria, with the first reason 
for ineligibility listed in Figure 1: English speaking; between the ages of 65 and 93; no 
diagnosis or treatment of a current health problem or chronic disease known to affect 
inflammatory biology; no prescribed medication usage affecting cardiovascular or immune 
system function, except blood pressure medications in the final two intervention cohorts 
(n=54; a criterion changed to increase enrollment); moderate to high levels of perceived

loneliness (>=4 on the Short Form UCLA-R45); no current substance abuse problem; no 
diagnosis or treatment of severe mental illness; no more than 90 minutes/week spent in 
regular mind-body practice; no significant cognitive impairment; and no problems with 
attending study assessments. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, 
and study procedures were approved by the Carnegie Mellon University and University of 
Pittsburgh IRBs. Study data were collected between October 2016 and February 2020. Trial 
recruitment concluded when recruitment goals had been reached. Intervention instructors 
were blind to outcome measures and outcome assessors were blind to condition.

The planned sample size for the trial was determined by estimating a small-medium effect 
(d=.3) of MBSR compared to HEP and a pre-post correlation of r=.80; N=188 participants 
were needed to achieve >80% power. These estimates are based on a broad range of effect 
sizes in prior work related to the primary aims of the parent trial3,46,47.

The study was run in eight intervention cohorts. Participants were pre-screened for eligibility 
by phone. At a pre-intervention study appointment, eligible participants completed 
questionnaire assessments, including a measure of chronic loneliness (see Measures). At 
a separate afternoon blood draw appointment an average of 47 days later (SD = 39 
days, median = 39 days, range = 0 – 253 days), participants provided 30mL blood, 
including 8mL in sodium heparin for the assessment of stimulated IL-6 and 4mL in 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for an absolute cell count (see Measures). They 
then completed three days of ambulatory assessments before being randomly assigned to 
condition at the first intervention session. Participants were allocated 1:1 to MBSR or HEP 
interventions using a computerized random number generator, with procedures implemented 
separately for each of eight intervention cohorts. Randomization was blocked by age (≤75 
vs. >75 years) and baseline depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II48 score ≤13 
[minimal depression] vs. >13 [mild, moderate, or severe depression]) to ensure balance 
across groups. Allocation sequence was concealed, such that only author AGCW had 
access to the sequence and otherwise was not involved with conducting the study. At post-
intervention, participants completed an afternoon blood draw, questionnaire assessment, 
and ambulatory assessment as at pre-intervention. Afternoon blood and questionnaire 
assessments were again collected at three-month follow-up. Participants were debriefed 
and compensated up to $475, including bonus payments for high adherence (with stepped 
bonuses for completing 85–100% of ambulatory assessments and 75–100% of intervention 
sessions plus retreat).

Intervention Programs—Participants were randomly assigned to Mindfulness-Based 
Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a structurally matched Health Enhancement Program (HEP)46. 
Both 8-week interventions are standardized curriculum-based group programs. In this study, 
the structure was adapted so that interventions consisted of 8 weekly 2-hour group sessions 
(rather than 2.5-hour sessions), a day-long retreat during the sixth week, and approximately 
45 minutes of home practice assignments six days per week. Content covered in each class 
is detailed in Supplementary Table 1 and summarized below. During the 3-month follow-up

period, participants were encouraged to continue mindfulness (MBSR) or health (HEP) 
practices; they received a list of community resources for continued support, weekly practice 
reminder emails, and continued access to meditation audios (MBSR only).

The MBSR program followed the MBSR Curriculum Guidelines (Center for Mindfulness in 
Medicine, Health Care, and Society, University of Massachusetts Medical School). MBSR 
includes guided mindfulness meditations intended to foster awareness of present-moment 
experiences and an open, accepting, and nonjudgmental perspective. Guidance and group 
discussions also encourage nonjudgmental awareness in everyday life, including when 
experiencing stress or other challenging emotions. Group discussions involve exploration of 
habitual reactions to stress, and the cultivation of skills such as pausing before responding. 
The daylong retreat after Week 6 involved silent guided meditation practice and reflection. 
Foundationally, the course centers on self-care and group support, including support around 
meeting the challenge of integrating meditation practice into daily life. Home practice 
recordings guide participants through body awareness, mindful movement, and seated 
meditation.

The HEP program, which was originally developed to enhance health and to match 
the structure of MBSR without training mindfulness, followed guidelines outlined in 
MacCoon et al. (2012)46. HEP utilizes behavioral health principles to counteract the 
effects of stress. Participants engage in group discussions and activities to promote 
experiential learning of strength, aerobic, flexibility, and balance exercises, nutritional 
concepts such as inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties of food, and stress 
management through creative expression, particularly music. The daylong retreat after 
Week 6 involved conversation, group meal preparation, functional movement exercises, and 
creative expression. Home practice assignments guide participants through age-appropriate 
physical fitness, nutrition and meal preparation, and music engagement exercises.

MBSR classes were taught by one of two certified MBSR instructors. The senior teacher, 
who taught cohorts 1 and 4–8, had been teaching MBSR for 14 years and had a personal 
meditation practice of 25 years, and the teacher for cohorts 2–3 had been teaching MBSR 
for 8 years and had a personal meditation practice of 13 years. The senior teacher also 
provided peer support and monitoring every two weeks for cohorts 2–3. Both teachers 
completed all MBSR teacher trainings required by the U Mass Center for Mindfulness in 
Medicine, Health Care, and Society. HEP classes were taught by one of two Registered 
and Licensed Dietitian Nutritionists. The teacher for cohorts 1–5 was a senior research 
nutritionist and medical writer, and the teacher for cohorts 6–8 was a nutrition educator and 
exercise coach. MBSR and HEP instructors followed a written template of activities and 
discussion topics for each session. All intervention sessions were monitored in real time by 
trained research staff who attended for the purpose of monitoring intervention fidelity and 
addressing questions about the research procedures.

Measures

Stimulated IL-6 production: Stimulated IL-6 production was assessed at baseline and 
post-intervention (all cohorts) and at 3-month follow-up (cohorts 4–8 only due to budget 
constraints) in the Behavioral Immunology Lab at University of Pittsburgh (PI: ALM).

Blood draws occurred between 1pm and 8pm (with 85% of draws between 3pm and 7pm) 
and draw times were standardized within participants across the three assessments (mean 
difference in blood draw time = 8 minutes, SD = 52 minutes). Biological data were available 
for at least one of the three assessments from 183 participants for analysis (see Figure 1). 
This assay measures cellular production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in response 
to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin. As part of an assay assessing the 
sensitivity of immune cells to glucocorticoids44, stimulated IL-6 production was measured 
by incubating 1.25mL of whole blood (diluted 7.35:1 with saline) with 150uL LPS at 
30ng/mL in phosphate buffer within 3 hours of each blood draw. Samples were incubated 
for 18 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Supernatants were then removed for storage at −80°C. 
IL-6 was measured in batches via ELISA (using BD Biosciences kits, catalog # 555220, lot 
# 8151888EU), with all available timepoints for each participant assayed on the same plate. 
Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variability were 12.7% and 4.4%, respectively.

Since monocytes are the primary immune cells that produce IL-6 when stimulated with 
endotoxin and monocyte numbers differed by blood sample, IL-6 production was adjusted 
for monocyte count. Stimulated levels of IL-6 (pg/mL) were divided by monocyte number 
per mL, determined from a Complete Blood Count analyzed in a clinical laboratory, then 
multiplied by 1000 to derive a metric of IL-6 production per 1000 monocytes (pg/1000 
cells). Two outlying IL-6-per-1000-monocytes values were removed prior to analysis (both 
>6SD above the mean). The same pattern of results was observed for raw stimulated IL-6 
(pg/mL) when monocyte count was included as a covariate in the statistical model.

Intervention and Home Practice Adherence:   Class attendance was recorded via sign-in 
sheet, with adherence calculated as total number of sessions out of nine. Self-reported 
home practice was assessed via daily Qualtrics links; daily practice duration was averaged 
across the eight-week intervention. Formal and informal home practice during follow-up 
was encouraged with weekly reminder emails and assessed during monthly phone calls. 
Participants reported the frequency and duration of formal practice (3 types introduced in 
MBSR and 6 types in HEP) and informal practice (15 examples in MBSR and 6 in HEP) 
each week in the past month; self-reported weekly practice durations were averaged across 
the follow-up period to create indexes of formal and informal practice. In MBSR, formal 
practice included mindfulness meditation exercises (e.g., body scan, seated meditation, 
mindful yoga) and informal practice involved incorporating mindful awareness into daily 
life activities (e.g., conversations, walking, housework, eating, preparing food, and mindful 
responding to stressful circumstances). In HEP, formal practice was defined as dedicating 
structured time to health practices (e.g., endurance, strength, stretching, or balance exercises; 
music; meal tracking) and informal practice was described as incorporating health practices 
into daily lifestyle (e.g., stretching before reaching for something; taking the stairs).

Loneliness: Loneliness was assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month 
follow-up using the UCLA Loneliness Scale49 (N=188). This 20-item scale measures the 
extent to which participants felt lonely “in general” over the past month on a 4-point Likert 
scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always) (sample item: “I lack companionship”). Relevant 
items were reverse-coded and all items were summed to create a total loneliness score

(reliability: Cronbach’s α=.93), with higher scores reflecting higher loneliness. This scale 
has shown good test-retest reliability across a one-year period (r=.73)49 and is thus used 
as a measure of chronic loneliness at study entry. Dutcher et al.43 report primary R01 trial 
findings, including intervention-related changes in loneliness.

Analyses—Analyses were conducted using Stata 17 software (StataCorp, College Station, 
Texas). Preliminary analyses tested for condition differences in demographics and other 
baseline characteristics using chi-square (for categorical variables) and ANOVA tests 
(for continuous variables). Intervention adherence and home practice were evaluated as 
covariates using ANOVA to test for significant condition differences. Preliminary regression 
analyses also tested the assumption that larger IL-6 responses associate with lower 
psychosocial stress (i.e., lower loneliness), adjusting for age and sex.

Primary analyses were conducted blind to condition assignment and inferences were 
made before unblinding occurred. Mixed-effect linear models (MLMs) tested for time 
(pre-intervention, post-intervention, or 3-month follow-up) × condition (MBSR vs. HEP) 
differences on stimulated IL-6 production using the Stata Mixed procedure. Planned 
comparisons testing for MBSR vs. HEP differences from pre- to post-intervention and 
pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up were calculated within these MLMs. Hypothesis tests 
were 2-sided and a priori significance was set at α=.05; the primary hypothesis tested in 
this report is the second of two hypotheses proposed for project F32AT009508. Following 
intent-to-treat (ITT) principles, all available data were included in analyses, including pre-
intervention data for 15 participants who dropped out; however, biological data were not 
available at any time point for 7 participants. MLMs model all available data and provide 
unbiased estimates to account for data missing at random (MAR). MLMs capture both 
within- and between-individual variability. Time was modeled as a random effect with an 
independent covariance structure, with pre-intervention values used as the first repeated 
measure to test for time × condition interactions. Condition and home practice duration were 
modeled as fixed effects using maximum likelihood estimation.

Exploratory sensitivity analyses used (1) MLMs to test for time (pre-intervention, post-
intervention, or 3-month follow-up) × condition (MBSR vs. HEP) × baseline loneliness (<= 
median vs. > median) differences on stimulated IL-6 production, and (2) correlation analyses 
to explore associations between change in loneliness and change in IL-6 production, with 
change represented by slopes across three time points.

Within-group Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated by dividing the pre-post (or pre-follow-
up) mean difference by the pooled standard deviation. Between-group effect sizes were 
calculated by dividing the difference between pre-post (or pre-follow-up) mean change in 
each condition by the pooled standard deviation of change.

(74%). Table 1 describes demographic and baseline characteristics by condition; there were 
no group differences in age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, or pre-intervention 
BMI, UCLA loneliness scores, or mind-body practice (all <90 minutes/week).

Participants in both groups were highly adherent to the intervention, completing on 
average 8 of the 9 intervention sessions (8 weekly sessions plus retreat day), with 63% 
of participants attending all 9 sessions. There were no group differences in intervention 
adherence, but HEP participants were more likely to attend the day-long retreat (87% 
vs. 74%; p=.031). Participants completed an average of 35.70 (SE=1.26) minutes per 
day of home practice, with HEP participants practicing significantly more than MBSR 
participants (39.90 [95% CI: 36.42–43.38] vs. 31.31 [95% CI: 27.76–34.87] minutes per 
day; p=.001). Home practice is included as a covariate in primary analyses, but results 
were consistent without controlling for home practice. HEP participants also tended to 
practice more during the three-month follow-up period, reporting significantly more formal 
practice than MBSR participants (59.31 [95% CI: 52.43–66.20] vs. 17.15 [95% CI: 9.98–
24.32] minutes each week; p<.001), but total home practice (formal and informal practice 
combined) was equivalent. Fifteen participants dropped out of the study, with 9 from MBSR 
and 6 from HEP. There were no group differences in dropout rate (MBSR: 9.68% vs. 
HEP: 6.19%; p=.37, Cramér’s V=.06) and dropouts did not differ from completers by age 
(F(1,188)=0.01, p=.92, d=.03), sex (χ2(1)=1.33, p=.25, V=.08), race (χ2(3)=2.93, p=.40, 
V=.12), or ethnicity (χ2(1)=0.66, p=.42, V=.06). There were also no differences between 
dropouts and completers by condition on any baseline characteristics (Supplementary Table 
2). Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for adherence outcomes. No study-related adverse 
events were reported.

There were no baseline group differences in monocyte counts (Mdifference=20423.68, 
SE=23818.93, 95% CI: [−26260.56, 67107.91], χ2(1)=0.74, p=.39) or differences in 
monocyte count change over time (time × condition effect: χ2(2)=3.01, p=.22). Monocyte 
count was significantly correlated with stimulated IL-6 production (r=.44, p<.0005), such 
that greater IL-6 production associated with higher numbers of monocytes. There were no 
baseline group differences in stimulated IL-6 production per monocyte (Mdifference=6.19, 
SE=5.08, 95% CI: [−3.76, 16.15], χ2(1)=1.49, p=.22).

Preliminary Analyses: Association of chronic loneliness and immunocompetence at 
baseline

Better baseline psychosocial functioning was expected to associate with larger stimulated 
IL-6 responses in this older adult sample. As predicted, lower baseline loneliness (β=−0.18, 
95% CI: [−0.11, −0.25], p=.021; N=167) associated with higher IL-6 production per 
monocyte.

Primary Analyses

MBSR was predicted to increase stimulated IL-6 production compared to HEP from pre- 
to post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. MLMs tested for time (pre, post, follow-up) 
× condition (MBSR, HEP) interactions on stimulated IL-6 production per monocyte, 
controlling for home practice duration.

As predicted, a significant time × condition effect on stimulated IL-6 production 
was observed across pre, post, and follow-up timepoints (χ2(2)=8.48, p=.014) (Figure 
2). Significant MBSR vs. HEP differences emerged from pre- to post-intervention 
(time × condition: Mdifference=−16.23, SE=6.24, 95% CI: [−28.46, −4.00], χ2(1)=6.76, 
p=.009, d=.38) and from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up (time × condition: 
Mdifference=−17.48, SE=7.32, 95% CI: [−31.82, −3.14], χ2(1)=5.71, p=.017, d=.35) (Table 
3). MBSR participants showed significant increases in IL-6 production from pre- to 
post-intervention (Mchange=14.66, SE=4.59, 95% CI: [5.67, 23.65], χ2(1)=10.21, p=.001, 
d=.37) and from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up (Mchange=27.69, SE=5.32, 95% 
CI: [17.27, 38.11], χ2(1)=27.13, p<.0005, d=.62). HEP participants showed no changes in 
IL-6 production from pre- to post-intervention (Mchange=−1.57, SE=4.24, 95% CI: [−9.89, 
6.74], χ2(1)=0.14, p=.71, d=.04), but showed significant increases from pre-intervention to 
3-month follow-up (Mchange=10.21, SE=5.04, 95% CI: [0.34, 20.08], χ2(1)=4.11, p=.043, 
d=.23).

Sensitivity Analyses

Exploratory sensitivity analyses showed no moderation of intervention effects on stimulated 
IL-6 production by baseline loneliness; there was no time × condition × baseline loneliness 
effect on stimulated IL-6 production (χ2(2)=0.13, p=.94) and primary time × condition 
effects remained with baseline loneliness score in the model (time × condition: χ2(2)=7.18, 
p=.028). However, there was a two-way time × baseline loneliness interaction within 
this model; across both conditions, effects were significantly larger among participants 
with higher baseline levels of loneliness (time × baseline loneliness: χ2(2)=6.86, p=.033), 
especially MBSR participants (Table 4).

Second, exploratory analyses showed no association between change in loneliness and 
change in IL-6 production across conditions (r=−.07, p=.30) or within MBSR participants 
only (r=−.09, p=.42), indicating that intervention-related improvements in loneliness did not 
explain increases in inflammatory responsivity.

Discussion

Psychosocial stressors like loneliness are thought to accelerate age-related declines in 
innate immunocompetence2. This study shows that mindfulness training may counteract 
this pattern and improve innate inflammatory competence among lonely older adults. 
Specifically, 8-week MBSR significantly increased LPS-stimulated IL-6 production at 
post-intervention and 3-month follow-up compared to a structurally matched Health 
Enhancement Program (HEP). HEP participants also showed an increase in stimulated 
production of IL-6 at 3-month follow-up (12% increase), but MBSR effects were larger at 
both post-intervention (19% increase) and follow-up (35% increase). This work suggests 
that mindfulness interventions—which train skills in observing present-moment thoughts, 
sensations, and emotions through a lens of openness and equanimity—can increase 
inflammatory responsivity.

Indeed, this trial provides evidence that mindfulness skills specifically are capable of 
driving changes in inflammatory competence; mindfulness training showed stronger effects

than a comparison intervention matched on non-mindfulness-specific treatment factors 
(e.g., placebo expectancies, social contact, a live instructor, effort toward a practice goal). 
Whereas mindfulness skills, especially acceptance of momentary experiences, are thought to 
impact psychosocial processes that interrupt stress response cascades7,50, HEP may impact 
immune function through distinct health behavior pathways. Indeed, leading models linking 
stress with disease processes suggest that psychosocial threat (e.g., loneliness) influences 
both negative emotions that activate physiological stress pathways as well as negative health 
behaviors; both pathways (and their interaction) have potential to influence disease-related 
physiological changes51. HEP provides training and practice in exercise and nutrition, two 
positive health behaviors associated with innate immunocompetence, faster wound healing, 
and reduced risk of infection among older adults52–54. As such, it is not surprising that 
an intervention focused on promoting these health behaviors also increased inflammatory 
competence.

However, the training-specific mechanisms underlying the observed effects are unclear. 
Although people who reported higher levels of loneliness at baseline showed greater 
increases in inflammatory responsivity across both conditions, changes in loneliness did 
not explain changes in inflammatory response following either intervention. It is not 
uncommon in behavioral intervention research for psychosocial and biological outcomes 
to diverge55; improvements in psychosocial outcomes are commonly found following both 
mindfulness and active comparison interventions (influenced by many factors, including 
expectancies)56, whereas improvements in biological stress processes are often more specific 
to mindfulness intervention6. Further research is needed to determine precise psychosocial 
mechanisms linking mindfulness training with changes in stress-related biological processes. 
Mindfulness training cultivates a lens shift for relating to daily life experiences with 
equanimity, a commonly reported phenomenon that has been elusive to assess via self-
report57. This shift may explain why MBSR participants showed larger increases in 
inflammatory competence despite greater home practice among HEP participants; whereas 
health behaviors must be practiced regularly to maintain benefit, the informal integration of 
mindfulness skills into daily life might reinforce mindful responding toward psychosocial 
stress in ways that interrupt stress response cascades.

This study adds to a sparse literature testing the effects of mindfulness and other mind-body 
interventions on stimulated cytokine production. To our knowledge, this study is the first 
to show that mindfulness training increases stimulated IL-6 production, and it is the only 
study to examine this question in the context of healthy aging8–10. In doing so, this study 
contributes to a longstanding question in psychoneuroimmunology about whether stress 
management interventions enhance or suppress stimulated cytokine production58. To date, 
mindfulness and mind-body interventions have shown no effects or reductions in stimulated 
cytokine production in midlife adults with inflammatory disease or breast cancer8–10,59,60. 
Together with this previous work, the current study suggests that intervention effects on 
stimulated cytokine response depend heavily on disease status and lifespan factors. In the 
context of existing chronic inflammatory disease, a reduction in the magnitude of stimulated 
cytokine response may be beneficial, decreasing the contribution of inflammatory processes 
to the exacerbation of disease processes and symptoms61. However, among healthy older 
adults as in this study, an increase in stimulated production may protect against infection,

enhance recovery from injury, and boost vaccine responsiveness11, outcomes that become 
increasingly important with age.

In addition to sample characteristics (e.g., age; disease status), psychosocial factors are 
thought to moderate whether enhanced vs. suppressed cytokine responsivity is adaptive11,12. 
In particular, stress chronicity moderates the effects of psychosocial stress on immune 
function. Acute stress tends to enhance inflammatory potential while chronic stress 
suppresses inflammatory potential; acute stressors boost endogenous and LPS-stimulated 
cytokine production to protect the body from infection62, but chronic psychosocial stress 
is associated with a diminished initial response to bacterial challenge and a slower 
recovery12. Consistent with this pattern, loneliness has been associated with higher LPS-
stimulated and unstimulated cytokine production following acute stress exposure63,64 and, as 
replicated in the present findings, lower LPS-stimulated cytokine production under resting 
conditions36,37. It is possible that mindfulness training boosts both the enhancement and 
suppression of inflammatory responsivity depending on stress chronicity; previous work has 
shown that mindfulness training can reduce acute stress-induced inflammatory activity47, 
and we show here that mindfulness training can increase stimulated inflammatory activity 
among chronically lonely older adults. It is worth noting that methodological factors reflect 
these contextual factors (e.g., incubation length models initial vs. recovery stages of the 
inflammatory response; environmental conditions of blood draw can model acute stress vs. 
resting conditions [i.e., the presence or absence of an acute stress induction]) and can thus 
moderate cytokine response18.

LPS-stimulated IL-6 production, an in vitro index of inflammatory potential, is one of many 
independent markers of immune system function that declines with age and psychosocial 
stress. Indeed, frequent or chronic activation of physiological stress response systems can 
cause complex adaptations that contribute to chronic disease over time65. For example, 
chronic glucocorticoid exposure has been shown to suppress the magnitude of inflammatory 
responsivity34, consistent with the results observed here. Glucocorticoids bind to receptors 
on immune cells and downregulate inflammatory gene expression, and as such, elevated 
levels of cortisol in circulation may inhibit the inflammatory response. However, chronic 
exposure to glucocorticoids also leads to glucocorticoid receptor resistance; receptors on 
immune cells adapt by developing resistance to cortisol and its anti-inflammatory effects66. 
This adaptation may result in insufficient recovery following activation of the inflammatory 
response, possibly contributing to inflammatory disease processes and heightened systemic 
inflammation. We previously showed in this sample of lonely older adults that MBSR 
buffered post-intervention increases in glucocorticoid resistance observed following HEP, 
with no changes in glucocorticoid resistance following MBSR44. Taken together, this study 
suggests that mindfulness training can enhance the initiation of the inflammatory response 
while preserving the sensitivity of immune cells to cortisol, potentially allowing for an 
efficient return to baseline levels of inflammation.

Importantly, the magnitude of inflammatory response is distinct from circulating cytokine 
levels. In the absence of acute stress or infection, elevated circulating cytokine levels, 
including IL-6, are markers of systemic inflammation that associate with aging67, age-
related chronic disease68, and mortality69. Indeed, ‘inflammaging’, thought to result from

chronic overstimulation of the innate immune response, in part by immune cell adaptations 
to chronic cortisol exposure (i.e., glucocorticoid resistance), is marked by chronic low-grade 
systemic inflammation and contributes to age-related chronic disease70. There is some 
evidence that mindfulness interventions decrease circulating cytokine levels among high-
risk samples, including lonely older adults3, although not all evidence is consistent71–73. 
However, changes in circulating inflammatory markers are independent of changes in 
stimulated cytokine production74, a functional measure of inflammatory competence when 
presented with an immune challenge.

It is important to note that the measure of stimulated IL-6 production used here is an index 
of inflammatory potential, but does not duplicate the complex dynamics of the inflammatory 
response in vivo. Cells were isolated from a complex internal milieu of influences and 
incubated with supra-physiologic doses of LPS to model the inflammatory response. For 
example, although mindfulness training has been shown to modulate SAM and HPA-axis 
stress response cascades6,75 and catecholamines and glucocorticoids are known to influence 
the inflammatory response in vivo, it remains to be determined whether mindfulness-related 
changes in circulating hormone levels are sufficient to influence the in vitro stimulated 
inflammatory response assessed here. Overall, it is unclear how closely the observed results 
mimic in vivo responses. Although previous studies show an association between in vitro 
inflammatory responsiveness and wound healing and mortality28,31, further research is 
needed to test whether the observed results translate to objective health outcomes.

Indeed, although increased stimulated cytokine production has potential to benefit health 
among older adults, this study did not assess long-term health outcomes. This is the first 
study to examine the effect of MBSR in a sample subject to the synergistic impact of age 
and psychosocial stress on immune function. Given evidence that innate immunocompetence 
tends to decline with age and psychosocial stress can exacerbate this effect2, we conclude 
that mindfulness and health enhancement interventions both boost immune responsivity 
among lonely older adults. However, further research is needed to test the maintenance of 
these effects beyond 3-month follow-up as well as their clinical significance.

Further research is also needed to determine whether the current findings generalize to 
older adults with chronic health problems. Although we aimed to recruit an at-risk sample, 
the participants enrolled in this study were relatively healthy (e.g., free of chronic disease 
and medications) and advantaged (e.g., high educational attainment). It is unclear whether 
mindfulness training may enhance immunocompetence among older adults at greater health 
risk. A more robust inflammatory response to challenge may have adverse effects in 
certain older adult populations (e.g., those with auto-immune or inflammatory disease); 
hyperactivation of the inflammatory response that fails to resolve (i.e., cytokine storm 
following exposure to infection) risks organ dysfunction76. This study did not measure 
the efficiency of inflammatory resolution, a critical process for long-term recovery and 
important question for future research.

We note several methodological limitations. First, IL-6 is one of many cytokines involved 
in the innate inflammatory response; an assessment of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β 
and TNF-α, which induce IL-6 production35, would more fully capture inflammatory

dynamics and strengthen conclusions. However, LPS-stimulated production of IL-1β, TNF-
α, and IL-6 are highly correlated77. Second, baseline assessments of loneliness occurred 
approximately 1–2 months prior to baseline assessments of stimulated IL-6 production. 
Although the UCLA Loneliness scale shows good test-retest reliability across one year, 
this gap in assessment limits precision in estimating the relationship between loneliness 
and inflammatory responsivity at baseline. Third, this trial compared effects of two active 
interventions; without an inactive control group, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
participating in the trial alone, which involved regular communication with the study team, 
could have influenced results. However, in a similar MBSR trial, lonely older adults in 
a waitlist control group showed no changes on biological outcomes3. Finally, this study 
was fully powered to detect pre- to post-intervention changes, but stimulated cytokine data 
was collected from a smaller subsample of participants at follow-up; thus, changes from 
pre-intervention to follow-up should be interpreted with caution.

Despite these limitations, mindfulness (and health enhancement) interventions appear to 
have a beneficial effect on innate immune competence among lonely older adults, effects 
that persist and strengthen over time. The direction of the observed responses raises the 
possibility that these vulnerable older adults may be better protected against acute infection 
and injury. During the three months following intervention, 15 to 20 minutes of daily formal 
and informal practice was enough to maintain these benefits, although practice estimates 
were self-reported monthly and may be limited by memory bias. Interestingly, mindfulness 
participants reported approximately one session of formal practice per week, suggesting that 
the integration of mindfulness skills into daily living (rather than continued daily formal 
meditation practice) promoted lasting benefits.

Conclusion

Mindfulness training may be effective for boosting innate immune responsivity among 
lonely older adults. Given that innate immune competence tends to decline with age, these 
findings have potential implications for susceptibility to infection and wound healing.

Loneliness is thought to accelerate age-related immune system decline.

Lonely older adults were randomized to mindfulness or health enhancement 
training.

Mindfulness (vs. health enhancement) training increased stimulated IL-6 
production.

Mindfulness training effects on IL-6 production were maintained at 3-month 
follow-up.

Mindfulness training may help boost innate immunocompetence among 
lonely older adults.
