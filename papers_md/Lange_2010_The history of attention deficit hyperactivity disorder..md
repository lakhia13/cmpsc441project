Abstract The contemporary concept of attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as deﬁned in the DSM-IV-
TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) is relatively
inattentive, and impulsive
new. Excessive hyperactive,
children have been described in the literature since the
nineteenth century. Some of the early depictions and eti-
ological theories of hyperactivity were similar to current
descriptions of ADHD. Detailed studies of the behavior of
hyperactive children and increasing knowledge of brain
function have changed the concepts of the fundamental
behavioral and neuropathological deﬁcits underlying the
disorder. This article presents an overview of the concep-
tual history of modern-day ADHD.

The contemporary concept of ADHD as deﬁned in the
DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) is
relatively new. However, an analysis of historical literature
suggests that children presenting with symptoms of inat-
tention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity have previously
been described by several authors during the last 200 years.
The clinical characterizations, underlying concepts, and
nomenclature of the described dysfunctions have changed
over the time. Many of the historical descriptions are,
however, consistent with the modern diagnostic criteria for
ADHD. The present article gives an overview of the con-
ceptual history of modern-day ADHD.

The ﬁrst example of a disorder that appears to be similar to
ADHD was given by Sir Alexander Crichton in 1798.
Crichton was a Scottish physician who was born in Edin-
burgh in 1763. In 1785, he received his M.D. from the
University of Leiden, The Netherlands (Palmer and Finger
2001; Tansey 1984). He then decided ‘‘to undertake a
European medical tour’’ (Tansey 1984, p. 243) and prac-
ticed in hospitals in Paris, Stuttgart and Vienna (Tansey
1984). In his clinical practice, Crichton observed many
cases of insanity and became increasingly interested in
mental
illness (Palmer and Finger 2001). In 1798, he
published ‘‘An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental
derangement: comprehending a concise system of the
physiology and pathology of the human mind and a history
of the passions and their effects’’. In this work of three
books, he demonstrated observations of clinical cases of
mental illness (Palmer and Finger 2001). Up until the end

of the eighteenth century, when Crichton published his
inquiry, it was uncommon to focus on mental issues from a
physiological or medical perspective (Palmer and Finger
2001). Crichton mentioned that at the time there were only
two other authors who had ‘‘written fully on the subject of
(Crichton 1798, pp. ii–iii, cited by
Mental Diseases’’
Palmer and Finger 2001).

The second chapter of book II ‘‘On Attention and its
Diseases’’ is of special
to the present subject.
interest
Crichton begins this chapter with a deﬁnition of attention:
‘‘When any object of external sense, or of
thought,
occupies the mind in such a degree that a person does not
receive a clear perception from any other one, he is said
to attend to it’’ (Crichton 1798, reprint p. 200). Crichton
emphasizes that the intensity of healthy attention varies
within a normal range both between individuals and even
within a person at different
times (Crichton 1798). A
distraction of attention does not necessarily have to be
pathological, e.g. mental stimuli, volition, or education
can have a great impact on healthy attention (Crichton
1798). Crichton distinguishes two possibilities of abnor-
mal inattention as the oppositional poles of pathologically
increased or decreased ‘‘sensibility of
the nerves’’
(Crichton 1798):

The morbid alterations to which attention is subject,
may all be reduced under the two following heads:
First. The incapacity of attending with a necessary
degree of constancy to any one object.
Second. A total suspension of its effects on the brain.
The incapacity of attending with a necessary degree
of constancy to any one object, almost always arises
from an unnatural or morbid sensibility of the nerves,
by which means this faculty is incessantly withdrawn
from one impression to another. It may be either born
with a person, or it may be the effect of accidental
diseases.
When born with a person it becomes evident at a very
early period of life, and has a very bad effect, inas-
much as it renders him incapable of attending with
constancy to any one object of education. But it
seldom is in so great a degree as totally to impede all
instruction; and what is very fortunate, it is generally
diminished with age. (Crichton, 1798, reprint p. 203)

In this short description of the ﬁrst alteration of attention,
Crichton gives several indications that he was depicting the
same disorder as deﬁned in the current DSM-IV-TR criteria
of ADHD. His characterization of the disorder as ‘‘the
incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of
constancy to any one object’’ is consistent with the second
symptom of criterion A1,
the ‘‘difﬁculty
sustaining attention in tasks or play activities’’ (American
Psychiatric Association 2000). Crichton further describes

Inattention:

that
‘‘this faculty is incessantly withdrawn from one
impression to another’’, which ﬁts with a second DSM-
IV-TR symptom of inattention, namely the circumstance
that the patient ‘‘is often easily distracted by extraneous
stimuli’’ (American Psychiatric Association 2000). The
furthermore
American Psychiatric Association (2000)
determines that for the diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms
have to be present before the age of seven. Crichton also
reports that the disorder can be ‘‘born with a person’’ and
‘‘when born with a person it becomes evident at a very
early period of life’’ (Crichton 1798). The proximate
conclusion that ‘‘it renders him incapable of attending with
constancy to any one object of education’’ (Crichton 1798)
suggests that Crichton observed school difﬁculties in these
children, which are commonly seen in children with
ADHD. Crichton states
‘‘generally
that
diminished with age’’ (Crichton 1798). The notion that
ADHD is a disorder of childhood and affected children
‘‘grow out’’ of ADHD during puberty (Okie 2006) was
common until the 1990s (Barkley 2006a). Recent studies
have shown that about 50% of children diagnosed with
ADHD retain symptoms of ADHD into adulthood (Okie
2006; Arolt 2008).

the disorder

According to Crichton, the incapacity of attending, if not
innate, can also be caused by nervous disorders. This
notion was later rediscovered in the concepts of minimal
brain damage or dysfunction.

In this disease of attention, if it can with propriety be
called so, every impression seems to agitate the
person, and gives him or her an unnatural degree of
mental restlessness. People walking up and down the
room, a slight noise in the same, the moving a table,
the shutting a door suddenly, a slight excess of heat or
of cold, too much light, or too little light, all destroy
constant attention in such patients, inasmuch as it is
easily excited by every impression. The barking of
dogs, an ill-tuned organ, or the scolding of women,
are sufﬁcient to distract patients of this description to
such a degree, as almost approaches to the nature of
delirium. It gives them vertigo, and headache, and
often excites such a degree of anger as borders on
insanity. When people are affected in this manner,
which they very frequently are, they have a particular
name for the state of their nerves, which is expressive
enough of their feelings. They say they have the
ﬁdgets. (Crichton, 1798, reprint p. 203)

By citing these examples of his patients’ behaviors,
Crichton depicts a great distractibility by extraneous and
even slight stimuli, a considerable restlessness and perhaps
some kind of impulsivity when the disorder ‘‘excites such a
degree of anger as borders on insanity’’ (Crichton 1798,
reprint p. 203). All symptoms observed by Crichton can be

associated with ADHD. However, his descriptions do not
entirely reﬂect the current concept of ADHD. He does not
mention any symptoms of hyperactivity (Palmer and
Finger 2001). It is possible that Crichton observed hyper-
active or impulsive symptoms in his patients (Palmer and
Finger 2001), but failed to recognize a correlation and
decided not
to specify them in this context. Another
possibility is that he described the inattentive subtype of
ADHD as suggested by Palmer and Finger (2001). His
brief description is consistent with some of the symptoms
of this ADHD subtype, but does not fully meet the criteria
for a clinical diagnosis.

We do not know for certain whether the ‘‘morbid
alteration’’ of attention described by Crichton is identical
with the current concept of ADHD. Crichton’s patients
might have suffered from another disorder associated with
attention problems, such as a metabolic dysfunction, epi-
lepsy, or head injury. However, Crichton’s descriptions
provide some evidence for the existence of ADHD at the
end of the eighteenth century.

Fidgety Phil (Heinrich Hoffmann 1809–1894)

In 1844, the German physician Heinrich Hoffmann created
some illustrated children’s stories including ‘‘Fidgety Phil’’
(‘‘Zappelphilipp’’), who is nowadays a popular allegory for
children with ADHD. Hoffmann was born in Frankfurt/
Main in 1809. He studied medicine in Heidelberg, Halle,
and Paris (Herzog et al. 1995). In 1835, he became a
general practitioner and obstetrician in Frankfurt/Main
(Herzog et al. 1995). In 1851, he was employed at the
mental hospital of Frankfurt (‘‘Anstalt fu¨r Irre und Epi-
leptische’’) and became a successful psychiatrist (Herzog
et al. 1995). Hoffmann rejected the common opinion of his
time that psychiatric patients were obsessed or criminal,
but rather regarded mental disorders as medical
issues
(Thome and Jacobs 2004). In 1861, he founded a new and
very advanced hospital in Frankfurt. He was head of this
institution until his retirement in 1888 (Herzog et al. 1995;
Thome and Jacobs 2004) and was known for his revolu-
tionary efforts to improve the conditions of psychiatric
patients (Thome and Jacobs 2004).

In Germany, Hoffmann has become famous as the
author of ‘‘Struwwelpeter’’, a storybook created in 1844 as
a Christmas present for his 3-year-old son Carl Philipp
(Hobrecker 1933). As Hoffmann detailed in his autobiog-
raphy, he had several times previously pulled a piece of
paper out of his notebook and had made little drawings to
calm and amuse crying children, thus making possible an
undisturbed medical examination (Hoffmann 1985, cited
by Seidler 2004; Thome and Jacobs 2004). Hoffmann
conceived ‘‘Struwwelpeter’’ for private use in order to

delight his son. However, the publisher Lo¨wenthal who had
seen his manuscript convinced him to publish the colorful
drawings (Thome and Jacobs 2004). In 1845, the ﬁrst
edition of the ‘‘Struwwelpeter’’, initially called ‘‘Cheerful
Stories and Funny Pictures with 15 colored plates for
children from 3 to 6 years’’ (‘‘lustige Geschichten und
drollige Bilder mit 15 kolorierten Tafeln fu¨r Kinder von 3
bis 6 Jahren’’, Ko¨pf 2006), was released with great success.
The second edition followed a year later and Hoffmann
added some stories, which included among others the story
of Fidgety Phil (Hobrecker 1933). Hoffmann’s Struwwel-
peter was published in numerous editions and translated
into several languages. The 400th edition was released in
1917 and the number of editions can no longer be counted
these days (Herzog et al. 1995).

In the story of Fidgety Phil, Hoffmann illustrates a
family conﬂict at dinner caused by the ﬁdgety behavior of
the son and culminating in his falling over together with the
food on the table. This can be interpreted as an early case
of ADHD. At the beginning of the story, the father asks ‘‘in
earnest tone’’ (Hoffmann 1846, English edition): ‘‘Let me
see if Philip can be a little gentleman; Let me see if he is
able to sit still for once at table’’ (Hoffmann 1846, English
edition). The initial statement suggests that the father had
anticipated some misbehavior of his son at table, indicating
that this was no singular or occasional event. It is a ﬁrst
hint at the presence of an underlying persistent disorder.
The DSM-IV-TR currently postulates that, for a diagnosis
the symptoms ‘‘have persisted for at
of ADHD,
least
(American Psychiatric Association 2000).
6 months’’
Subsequently, Hoffmann describes symptoms of inatten-
tion and hyperactivity in Philipp. The boy’s reaction to his
father’s admonition reads in the original German text as
follows: ‘‘Doch der Philipp ho¨rte nicht, was zu ihm der
Vater spricht’’ (Hoffmann 1948), which, literally trans-
lated, means ‘‘but Philipp did not listen to what the father
was saying to him’’. This behavior represents explicit
symptoms of inattention. The DSM-IV-TR describes that
the patient ‘‘often does not seem to listen when spoken to
directly’’ and ‘‘often does not follow through on instruc-
tions (…) [what is] not due to oppositional behavior’’
(American Psychiatric Association 2000). Instead of fol-
lowing his father’s request, Philipp ‘‘wriggled and giggled,
and then, I declare, swung backward and forward and tilted
his chair’’
(Hoffmann 1846, English edition). This
description can be interpreted as symptoms of ‘‘motoric
overactivity’’ (Burd and Kerbeshian 1988) and is close to
the ﬁrst symptom of hyperactivity characterized in the
DSM-IV-TR: ‘‘often ﬁdgets with hands or feet or squirms
in seat’’ (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Hoff-
mann depicts Philipp’s motor activity as being excessive
enough that ‘‘his chair falls over quite. Philip screams with
all his might, catches at the cloth, but then that makes

123

matters worse again. Down upon the ground they fall,
glasses, bread, knives forks and all’’ (Hoffmann 1846,
English edition). The fact that Philipp’s parents become
very angry in the story (Hoffmann 1948) may hint at
another DSM-IV-TR criterion, i.e. the behavior of children
suffering from ADHD often causes conﬂicts and a ‘‘sig-
niﬁcant impairment in social (…) functioning’’ (American
Psychiatric Association 2000).

Another story in Hoffmann’s ‘‘Struwwelpeter’’ relevant
to the present review is that of ‘‘Johnny Look-in-the-air’’,
which was added in the 5th edition in 1847 (Seidler 2004).
In this story, Hoffmann depicts a boy showing signiﬁcant
symptoms of inattention. Johnny was always ‘‘looking at
the sky and the clouds that ﬂoated by’’ (Hoffmann 1846,
English edition) and was therefore ‘‘often easily distracted
by extraneous stimuli’’ (American Psychiatric Association
2000). Johnny’s inattentiveness resulted in the collision
with an approaching dog and climaxed in an accident as
‘‘Johnny watch’d the swallows’’ (Hoffmann 1846, English
edition). He ﬁnally fell into a river.

Some authors are convinced that the stories of Johnny
Look-in-the-air and Fidgety Phil are early descriptions of
ADHD (Burd and Kerbeshian 1988; Ko¨pf 2006; Thome
and Jacobs 2004). However, Johnny Look-in-the-air’s ret-
ropulsion of
the head may also be interpreted as a
description of a petit mal absence (Nissen 2005). Petit mal
absences show a wide variety of mild to moderate motor
accompaniment, and retropulsion of the head is quite
common (retropulsive petit mal, Janz 1969). There are also
critics who advance the view that Hoffmann’s Fidgety Phil
is simply an example of a naughty child (Seidler 2004).
Seidler (2004) refers to the fact that the ﬁnal version of the
scene’s pictures published in 1859, which is the artwork
still used in modern editions, differs from the original
version of 1845. Seidler (2004) sees in the slightly different
gestures of the protagonists a completely different situa-
tion, namely an open conﬂict between a father and his
naughty, misbehaving son. The father’s initial admonition
provokes the son’s deliberate deﬁant behavior indicated by
eye contact and the active gripping of the tablecloth by the
son (Seidler 2004). Hoffmann’s storybook was published at
a time when educational warning stories were very popular
(Herzog et al. 1995). Each of Hoffmann’s stories demon-
strates a child’s misconduct leading to fatal consequences
including death of the child. It is therefore possible that he
wanted children to learn from his stories. Hoffmann’s
script is an illustrated children’s book and he is therefore
unlikely to have intended to address a broad medical
readership and to describe a pathological condition. Since
at his time the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity
were not established as a psychiatric disorder, Hoffmann
may have presented observations of conspicuous behavior
without considering describing a disorder. One cannot

123

conclude whether or not Hoffmann’s described a case of
ADHD in the early nineteenth century, since the story of
Fidgety Phil is too short and the depicted behavioral fea-
tures are not sufﬁcient to establish the diagnostic criteria of
ADHD. Fidgety Phil has nevertheless become a commonly
used allegory for ADHD.

Defect of moral control
(Sir George Frederic Still, 1868–1941)

The Goulstonian Lectures of Sir George Frederic Still in
1902 are by many authors considered to be the scientiﬁc
starting point of the history of ADHD (Barkley 2006a;
Conners 2000; Palmer and Finger 2001; Rafalovich 2001;
Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). Still was a British
pediatrician who was born in Highbury, London, in 1868.
He became involved in research into childhood diseases
and wrote several medical textbooks about his ﬁndings
(Farrow 2006). The most widely known ﬁndings are his
descriptions of ‘‘a form of chronic joint disease in chil-
dren’’ (Still 1897), which today is called ‘‘Still’s disease’’
(Farrow 2006). In 1906, Still became the ﬁrst professor of
pediatrics in England at King’s College Hospital London
(Farrow 2006). In 1933, he was president of the ﬁrst
international pediatric congress (Hamilton 1968). Still has
therefore frequently been called ‘‘the father of British
pediatrics’’ (Dunn 2006).

In his Goulstonian Lectures, a series of three lectures to
the Royal College of Physicians of London ‘‘On Some
Abnormal Psychical Conditions in Children’’ (Still 1902),
Still discusses ‘‘the particular psychical conditions (…)
which are concerned with an abnormal defect of moral
control in children’’ (Still 1902, p. 1008). He deﬁnes moral
control as ‘‘the control of action in conformity with the idea
of the good of all’’ (Still 1902, p. 1008). Still states that
‘‘moral control (…) is dependent upon three psychical
factors, a cognitive relation to environment, moral con-
sciousness, and volition’’ (Still 1902, p. 1077). Since both
‘‘cognitive relation to environment’’, which implies a
‘‘capacity for reasoning comparison’’, and moral con-
sciousness are intellectual capacities (Still 1902, p. 1008),
Still states that defective moral control as a morbidity can
often be observed in cases of mentally retarded children
(Still 1902). However, ‘‘there are other cases which cannot
be included in this category’’ (Still 1902, p. 1008) and
which, as he points out, ‘‘in particular (…) call for careful
observation’’ (Still 1902, p. 1008). They comprise the
cases considered as historical descriptions of ADHD, i.e.
children with a defect of moral control but without a
‘‘general impairment of intellect’’ (Still 1902, p. 1077).
Still divides these cases in two further groups, children
with a ‘‘morbid defect of moral control associated with

The history of attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder

245

physical disease’’ (Still 1902, p. 1077), such as a cerebral
tumor, meningitis, epilepsy, head injury or typhoid fever,
and children with a ‘‘defect of moral control as a morbid
manifestation, without general impairment of intellect and
without physical disease’’ (Still 1902, p. 1079). Some of
the latter group, however, showed a ‘‘history of severe
cerebral disturbance in early infancy’’ (Still 1902, p. 1081).
This differentiation was the origin of later concepts of brain
damage, minimal cerebral dysfunction, and hyperactivity
as historical precursors to ADHD (Rothenberger and
Neuma¨rker 2005).

Still described 20 cases of children with a ‘‘defect of
moral control as a morbid manifestation, without general
impairment of intellect and without physical disease’’ (Still
1902, p. 1079). Interestingly, Still observed 15 cases of
boys and ﬁve cases of girls. This is ‘‘a disproportion which
[in Still’s opinion] (…) is not altogether accidental’’ (Still
1902, p. 1080) and which is consistent with the commonly
observed uneven male to female sex ratio of 3:1 in child
and adolescent ADHD (Barkley 1990, cited by Palmer and
Finger 2001). Most children for whom the ﬁrst manifes-
tation of the defect was determined showed symptoms
before the age of 7 (7 out of 9 cases), which currently is a
diagnostic criterion of DSM-IV-TR. Still furthermore rec-
ognized that a morbid manifestation of a child’s moral
control can be considered only when the child does not
meet the standard for moral conduct at a certain age within
a ‘‘range of variation which we arbitrarily recognize as
normal’’ (Still 1902, p. 1009). The American Psychiatric
Association also states that for a diagnosis of ADHD,
symptoms have to be present ‘‘to a degree that is mal-
adaptive and inconsistent with developmental
level’’
(American Psychiatric Association 2000). Still argued that
a ‘‘lack of moral control may be shown in many ways’’
(Still 1902, p. 1009). The symptoms listed are:

(1) passionateness; (2) spitefulness – cruelty; (3)
jealousy; (4) lawlessness; (5) dishonesty; (6) wanton
mischievousness – destructiveness; (7) shamelessness –
immodesty; (8) sexual immorality; and (9) viciousness.
The keynote of these qualities is self-gratiﬁcation, the
immediate gratiﬁcation of self without regard either
to the good of others or to the larger and more remote
good of self. (Still, 1902, p. 1009).

Although most of these symptoms are not directly associ-
the keynote
ated with the current concept of ADHD,
identiﬁed by Still ﬁts an important ﬁnding of modern
ADHD research. Delay of gratiﬁcation appears to be ‘‘a
major problem for children with ADHD’’ (Barkley 2006b)
and reactions without regard to consequences, whether ‘‘to
the good of others or (…) [the] good of self’’ (Still 1902,
p. 1009), are strongly associated with impulsivity, a main
symptom of ADHD. The most common symptom observed

by Still
in these cases was ‘‘an abnormal degree of
passionateness’’ (Still 1902, p. 1009). Passionateness did
not mean affection (Barkley 2006b), but some ‘‘impulsivity
regarding some immediate goal’’ (Conners 2000, p. 176)
and a kind of ‘‘quickness to display all emotion and
especially those of frustration, anger, hostility, and aggres-
sion’’ (Barkley 2006b, p. 137), for example expressed ‘‘in
outbursts of rage’’ (Still 1902, p. 1165). Similarly ‘‘jeal-
ousy’’ does, according to Still, not mean ‘‘the mere emotion
but its uncontrolled expression’’ (Still 1902, p. 1009). Still
attributes these symptoms to ‘‘a morbid failure to control
(…) emotional activities’’ (Still 1902, p. 1165), which is
due to an ‘‘exaggeration of excitability’’
(Still 1902,
p. 1165). These descriptions are similar to the current
concept of impulsivity. Although not explicitly mentioned
in DSM-IV-TR, impulsivity as a main symptom of ADHD
is often associated with a lack of emotional
impulse
control, a low frustration tolerance and some abrupt
outbursts of rage (Barkley 2006b). Still describes some
cases with signs of impulsivity,

for instance, the case of the boy, aged 11(cid:2) years
(…): his mother stated that in the midst of playing
quietly with other children he would suddenly seize
two of them and bang their heads together, making
them cry with pain and (…) he seems unable to resist
it. (Still, 1902, p. 1165).

Still also mentions that many of his depicted cases showed
‘‘a quite abnormal incapacity for sustained attention. Both
teachers have specially noted this
parents and school
feature in some of my cases as something unusual’’ (Still
1902, p. 1166). An attention deﬁcit is a main symptom of
ADHD and, according to the current DSM-IV-TR criteria,
a child with ADHD ‘‘has difﬁculty sustaining attention in
tasks or play activities’’ (American Psychiatric Association
2000). Difﬁculties at school are frequently observed in
children with ADHD. In particular, the notion of children
with a signiﬁcant attention deﬁcit, but ‘‘without general
impairment of intellect’’ (Still 1902, p. 1079) ﬁts modern-
day ADHD. Recent studies have shown that the IQ of
children with ADHD is within the normal range (MTA
Cooperative Group 1999; Schuck and Crinella 2005).
Some of the cases cited by Still showed remarkable
symptoms of inattention, for example,

the case of a boy with moral defect who would repeat
times
the process of saying ‘Good-night’ several
before he was aware that he had done so; the same
boy would often put his boot on the wrong foot
apparently without noticing it. Another boy, aged six
years, with marked moral defect was unable to keep
his attention even to a game for more than a very
short time, and, as might be expected, the failure of

123

246

attention was very noticeable at school, with the
result that in some cases the child was backward in
school attainments, although in manner and ordinary
conversation he appeared as bright and intelligent as
any child could be (Still, 1902, p. 1166).

Many of Still’s descriptions appear to indicate that children
in the early twentieth century showed clear symptoms of
ADHD. However, most of the symptoms listed by Still and
described in his cases do not refer to ADHD. Still also
in
reported children who ‘‘seemed to take a delight
tormenting the other children’’ (Still 1902, p. 1080), for
example by throwing other children’s toys in the ﬁre and
laughing at their grief. He furthermore described children
who pathologically stole or lied with extraordinary insen-
sitivity to any punishment, children who were aggressive
and attacked strange children or threatened to hurt their
mothers (Still 1902, p. 1081), ‘‘lawless’’ children with ‘‘a
reckless disregard for command and authority’’ (Still 1902,
p. 1009), children with ‘‘a complete lack of natural
affection’’ (Still 1902, p. 1165) even to their parents, and
children who showed cruelty to animals for example by
attempting to put a cat in the ﬁre (Still 1902, p. 1081) or by
‘‘cutting a rabbit alive (…) smothered in blood’’ (Still
1902, p. 1081).

Still’s concept of a ‘‘defect of moral control’’ is not
consistent with the concept of ADHD. Still did not pre-
dominantly refer to inattentive-impulsive children, but
rather described several types of deviant behavior observed
in children. ‘‘His description included the full range of
externalizing behavior disorders’’ (Conners 2000), pre-
sumably many cases that would meet today’s criteria for
conduct disorder, oppositional deﬁant disorder, learning
disabilities, or antisocial personality disorder (Palmer and
Finger 2001; Barkley 2006b; Conners 2000). All these
cases were combined in the concept of ‘‘defect of moral
control’’. Among these cases, there were probably also
some cases of ADHD such as the ones depicted above.
Although the signs described by Still are consistent with
some symptoms of ADHD, they are not sufﬁcient for a
clinical diagnosis of ADHD. Hyperactivity as a main
symptom of ADHD is hinted at in one case, i.e. a girl who
showed ‘‘marked ﬁdgety, almost choreiform movements’’
(Still 1902, p. 1082). Still’s work, nevertheless, ‘‘represents
a break from the more general medical discussions of
morality’’ (Rafalovich 2001) and his original notion of an
impulsive syndrome which was distinguishable from gen-
eral
retardation and symptoms caused by
physical diseases is pioneering (Conners 2000). He dis-
cusses both nature and nurture as possible factors under-
lying a lack of ‘‘moral control’’ and includes an elaborate
description of family history in his cases. Still’s Goulsto-
nian lectures can be considered ‘‘the groundwork for a

intellectual

123

category of mental illness that is (…) speciﬁc to child
deviance’’ (Rafalovich 2001) and a historically signiﬁcant
moment for child psychopathology in general (Barkley
2006b). Regardless of whether or not Still’s descriptions
include some cases of ADHD, his work is nevertheless
important in the analysis of historical ideas concerning
ADHD. Still’s demonstration of a connection between
brain damage and deviant behavior in children was highly
inﬂuential
regarding the further conceptualization of
ADHD.

Postencephalitic behavior disorder

Some authors including Tredgold in 1908 gave an account
of a correlation between early brain damage, for example
caused by birth defect or perinatal anoxia, and subsequent
behavior problems or learning difﬁculties (Tredgold 1908,
cited by Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). This was
conﬁrmed by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic, which
spread around the world from 1917 to 1928 and affected
approximately 20 million people (Conners 2000; Rafalovich
2001). The residual effects appeared as fatal as the
encephalitis itself. The disease was thought to irreversibly
damage the patients physically or mentally (Rafalovich
2001). Many of the affected children who survived the
epidemic encephalitis, subsequently showed remarkably
abnormal behavior. The residual effects were described as
‘‘postencephalitic behavior disorder’’
(Barkley 2006a;
Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). Frequently observed
features included a signiﬁcant change in personality,
emotional instability, cognitive deﬁcits, learning difﬁcul-
ties, sleep reversals, tics, depression, and poor motor con-
(Conners 2000; Kessler 1980; Rothenberger and
trol
Neuma¨rker 2005). Children often became ‘‘hyperactive,
distractible, irritable, antisocial, destructive, unruly, and
unmanageable in school. They frequently disturbed the
whole class and were regarded as quarrelsome and
impulsive, often leaving the school building during class
time without permission’’ (Ross and Ross 1976, p. 15).
Bender (1942) described the postencephalitic behavior
disorder to be ‘‘best understood as an organic driveness of
brain stem origin. (…) This hyperkinesis leads the child to
contact the environment continually, by touching, taking
and destroying’’ (cited by Kessler 1980, p. 19). Many
descriptions of children with this disorder include some
characteristic symptoms of ADHD, and some behaviors of
postencephalitic cases might also be attributed to ADHD.
Most of the afﬂicted children, however, would not have
the current ADHD criteria. The postencephalitic
met
behavior disorder aroused, nevertheless, a broad interest in
hyperactivity in children, and the ﬁndings were inﬂuential

The history of attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder

247

for the further scientiﬁc development of the concept of
ADHD (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). The era of
the postencephalitic child pursued the course of Still and
explained unconventional behavior of children physiolog-
ically and medicalized deviant child behavior. The
assumption of a causal connection between brain damage
and symptoms of hyperactivity and distractibility was
important
to the further conceptualization of ADHD
(Rafalovich 2001; Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005).

Hyperkinetic disease of infancy (Franz Kramer
1878–1967, and Hans Pollnow 1902–1943)

In 1932, the German physicians Franz Kramer and Hans
Pollnow reported ‘‘On a hyperkinetic disease of infancy’’
(‘‘U¨ ber eine hyperkinetische Erkrankung im Kindesalter’’).
The most characteristic symptom of affected children was a
marked motor restlessness (Kramer and Pollnow 1932,
p. 1). The authors point out that the symptoms of this
‘‘hyperkinetic disease’’ had previously been observed and
described by several authors, but the disorder had not been
distinguished from other diseases with similar symptoms,
such as the residual effects of the encephalitis lethargica
epidemic. In their cases, the authors observed no bodily
symptoms, sleep disturbances, or nocturnal agitation,
which were speciﬁc to the postencephalitic behavior dis-
order (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 39). In contrast to the
postencephalitic motor drive, the restlessness observed in
the cases of Kramer and Pollnow could be observed only
by day (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 39). The main
symptoms of the ‘‘hyperkinetic disease’’ as described by
Kramer and Pollnow are very similar to the current concept
of ADHD.

According to Kramer and Pollnow, the most obvious
symptom of children with hyperkinetic disease is a
remarkable motor activity, which appears to be very urgent
(Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 7). These children cannot
stay still for a second, run up and down the room (Kramer
and Pollnow 1932, p. 7), climb about preferring high fur-
niture in particular (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 10) and
are displeased when deterred from acting out their motor
impulses (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 7). This descrip-
tion is very similar to the current characterization of
hyperactivity, one of the main symptoms of ADHD. The
American Psychiatric Association (2000) describes chil-
dren with ADHD to leave their seats when ‘‘remaining
seated is expected’’, to ‘‘run (…) about’’ and to be often
‘‘on the go’’ (American Psychiatric Association 2000).
Excessive climbing is also an explicit hyperactive symp-
tom of ADHD mentioned by the American Psychiatric
Association (2000). The urgent character of the children’s
motor activity is reﬂected in the depiction of children with

ADHD as being ‘‘driven by a motor’’ (American Psychi-
atric Association 2000). Kramer and Pollnow furthermore
consider the observed motor activity as being characterized
by a conspicuous lack of purposefulness (Kramer and
Pollnow 1932, p. 8). Children with hyperkinetic disease
indiscriminately touch or move everything available
without pursuing a goal (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 7,
p. 9). They often do not use objects according to their
function, but regard them as stimuli
inducing activity
(Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 9). These children switch
the light on and off, move chairs around the room, climb
the table, the cupboard or the windowsill, jump around in
their beds, turn keys in the keyhole, rip paper, go round in
circles, throw objects out of the window, or beat their toys
rhythmically on the ﬂoor without any purpose (Kramer and
Pollnow 1932, p. 8 f.). This aimlessness of action exem-
pliﬁed by quickly changing activities is possibly due to a
distinct distractibility by new and intensive stimuli, which
is another symptom mentioned by Kramer and Pollnow.
The children described by Kramer and Pollnow often
cannot complete a set task or do not answer to questions
(Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 13). They are unable to
concentrate on difﬁcult tasks (Kramer and Pollnow 1932,
p. 17), which may cause learning deﬁcits (Kramer and
Pollnow 1932, p. 23) and make it difﬁcult to assess their
intellectual abilities (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 18).
These descriptions comply with the second main symptom
of ADHD, i.e. inattention. The DSM-IV-TR depicts chil-
dren with ADHD as being ‘‘easily distracted by extraneous
stimuli’’ and as having ‘‘difﬁculty sustaining attention in
tasks or play activities’’ (American Psychiatric Association
2000). Together with the fact that children with ADHD are
known to have difﬁculties in planning and ‘‘organizing (…)
activities’’ (American Psychiatric Association 2000), their
playing can suggest a lack of purposefulness as described
by Kramer and Pollnow. In addition, Kramer and Poll-
now’s observation of unresponsiveness in children with
ADHD is reﬂected in the notion that a child with ADHD
‘‘often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly’’
(American Psychiatric Association 2000). Patients with
ADHD typically have problems to concentrate and ‘‘to give
close attention to details’’ (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion 2000). It is also common for patients with inattention
to leave work or activities uncompleted and to ‘‘fail (…) to
ﬁnish (…) chores’’
(American Psychiatric Association
2000). This symptom is also described by Kramer and
Pollnow as a further characteristic of the hyperkinetic
child. According to these authors, hyperkinetic children
show no perseverance in their activities, e.g. they play no
game for more than a few minutes (Kramer and Pollnow
1932, p. 10). However, Kramer and Pollnow also noticed
that the children were able to persevere at some activities
of their interest for hours (Kramer and Pollnow 1932,

123

248

K. W. Lange et al.

p. 14). Both a lack of perseverance and the ability to
concentrate on certain tasks can be observed in children
with ADHD. Kramer and Pollnow describe furthermore
that the children are unstable in their mood (Kramer and
Pollnow 1932, p. 11). They observed an increased excit-
ability, frequent ﬁts of rage, and a tendency to become
aggressive or to burst
into tears for marginal reasons
(Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 11). These are characteristic
signs of impulsivity, and all main symptoms of ADHD are
therefore present in the record of Kramer and Pollnow.

The description of the hyperkinetic disease also meets
another criterion of ADHD. The American Psychiatric
Association (2000) states that for a diagnosis of ADHD to
be made, symptoms must cause ‘‘signiﬁcant impairment in
social, academic, or occupational functioning’’. Kramer
and Pollnow describe that hyperkinetic children are often
disobedient (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 13) and cause
severe educational problems (Kramer and Pollnow 1932,
p. 14). At school, they may cause confusion or disturb the
class (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 14). They often have
difﬁculty playing harmoniously with other children and are
generally unpopular among peers (Kramer and Pollnow
1932, p. 11). As mentioned previously, the presence of
symptoms before the age of seven is an additional impor-
tant diagnostic criterion in the DSM-IV-TR (American
Psychiatric Association 2000). This criterion is also met by
the cases of Kramer and Pollnow, since they reported an
age of onset of the hyperkinetic disease as early as three or
4 years and a peak at the age of six. In many cases of
the abnormal behavior occurred
Kramer and Pollnow,
following a feverish disease or epileptic convulsion
(Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 23), which suggests an
organic cause (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 35). Kramer
and Pollnow describe that the characteristics of the disor-
der, especially the motor restlessness, decline in intensity
by the age of seven, and in most cases, the children recover
in the subsequent years (Kramer and Pollnow 1932, p. 23),
so that Kramer and Pollnow considered the disorder a
‘‘hyperkinesis of childhood’’ (Kramer and Pollnow 1932,
p. 4). Although more than 50% of children with ADHD
retain symptoms into adulthood (Barkley et al. 2002), the
signs of hyperactivity decline with age in most cases of
ADHD (Davidson 2008). Since Kramer and Pollnow con-
sidered abnormal motor activity as the most characteristic
symptom of the disorder, they possibly regarded affected
children as recovered when, regardless of other symptoms,
this sign receded. However, Kramer and Pollnow recog-
nized that the disorder can have implications into adult-
hood (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005, p. 167).

In summary, the descriptions of Kramer and Pollnow
‘‘on a hyperkinetic disease of infancy’’ meet all three main
symptoms of ADHD and two additional DSM-IV-TR cri-
teria. In particular, their description of motor symptoms is

123

highly consistent with the current classiﬁcation systems
(Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). The introductory
remark of Kramer and Pollnow that
the pathological
manifestation of the disorder had been known previously,
but had not been recognized as a distinct disorder which
had to be differentiated from other disorders with similar
symptoms, is consistent with the historical literature. In
summary, Kramer and Pollnow established a concept of the
hyperkinetic disease that closely resembles the current
concept of ADHD.

The ﬁrst treatment of hyperactivity
(Charles Bradley 1902–1979)

In 1937, Charles Bradley reported a positive effect of
stimulant medication in children with various behavior
disorders (Bradley 1937). Bradley was medical director of
the Emma Pendleton Bradley Home, today called Bradley
Hospital, in East Providence, Rhode Island, which was
founded by his great-uncle George Bradley (Brown 1998)
to treat neurologically impaired children (Conners 2000).
Apart from children with deﬁnite neurological disorders or
residual effects of encephalitis (Conners 2000), there where
children hospitalized with ‘‘emotional problems’’ and
major difﬁculties in learning and behavior. Some of these
children would possibly be diagnosed with ADHD today
(Gross 1995). Bradley’s discovery of the improvement by
stimulants of the behavior of children was based on a
chance ﬁnding during his neurological examinations (Gross
1995). Bradley performed pneumoencephalograms in order
to examine structural brain abnormalities (Rothenberger
and Neuma¨rker 2005). This usually caused severe head-
aches, which were supposed to be the result of a signiﬁcant
loss of spinal ﬂuid. Bradley attempted to treat the head-
aches by stimulating the choroid plexus with benzedrine
which was ‘‘the most potent stimulant available at the
time’’ (Gross 1995). However, benzedrine had a negligible
effect on the headaches, but caused a striking improvement
in behavior and school performance in some of the children
(Brown 1998; Gross 1995). Bradley subsequently started a
systematic trial in 30 children of his hospital and observed
remarkable alterations in behavior. ‘‘The most spectacular
change in behavior brought about by the use of benzedrine
was the remarkably improved school performance of
approximately half the children’’ (Bradley 1937, p. 582).
The children ‘‘were more interested in their work and
performed it more quickly and accurately’’ (Gross 1995).
In addition, some decrease in motor activity was usually
noted in the children who also ‘‘became emotionally sub-
dued without, however, losing interest in their surround-
ings’’ (Bradley 1937, p. 580). Bradley was surprised at this
effect. ‘‘It appears paradoxical that a drug known to be a

The history of attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder

249

stimulant should produce subdued behavior in half of the
children. It should be borne in mind, however, that portions
of the higher levels of the central nervous system have
inhibition as their function, and that stimulation of these
portions might
indeed produce the clinical picture of
reduced activity through increased voluntary control’’
(Bradley 1937, p. 582). He later identiﬁed children who
were most likely to beneﬁt from benzedrine treatment as
‘‘characterized by short attention span, dyscalculia, mood
lability, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and poor memory’’
(Conners 2000). These features are nowadays associated
with ADHD. Bradley’s observations of stimulant effects in
hyperactive children were revolutionary (Gross 1995) and
are considered important discoveries in psychiatric treat-
ment (Brown 1998).

Methylphenidate (Leandro Panizzon)

in stimulant

Although Bradley and his colleagues published their pio-
neering discovery in prominent journals (Brown 1998),
their reports had almost no inﬂuence on research and
practice for at least 25 years (Brown 1998; Conners 2000).
This was possibly due to the wide inﬂuence of psycho-
analysis at that time (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005)
and the assumption that behavioral disorders have no bio-
logical basis and require psychological
interventions
(Brown 1998). However, further investigations into this
issue, for example by Laufer et al. (1957), produced
treatment of hyperkinetic
growing interest
children (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). At present,
stimulant medication is the most frequently used treatment
of children with ADHD (Wender 2000/2002). Benzedrine
was the ﬁrst stimulant drug administered to hyperactive
children and is no longer in use. Methylphenidate is now-
adays considered as drug of ﬁrst choice (Leonard et al.
2004; Morton and Stockton 2000). The compound was ﬁrst
synthesized in 1944 by Leandro Panizzon and marketed as
‘‘Ritalin’’ by Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceutical Company in 1954
(Morton and Stockton 2000; Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker
2005). The name ‘‘Ritalin’’ derives from the ﬁrst name of
Panizzon’s wife, i.e. Marguerite or ‘‘Rita’’ (Rothenberger
and Neuma¨rker 2005). Methylphenidate is ‘‘a piperazine—
substituted phenylisopropylamine that
traditionally
related to amphetamine’’ (Leonard et al. 2004, p. 151) and
was initially used in the treatment of ‘‘a number of indi-
cations such as chronic fatigue, lethargy, depressive states,
disturbed senile behavior, psychosis associated with
depression and narcolepsy’’ (Leonard et al. 2004, p. 151).
‘‘However, its most impressive effect has been the reduc-
tion of symptoms seen in ADHD’’ (Morton and Stockton
2000, p. 159). Methylphenidate is regarded by now as the
most effective psychostimulant and is the most frequently

is

prescribed drug in the treatment of ADHD (Do¨pfner et al.
2000).

Minimal brain damage

The scientiﬁc history of hyperactivity was characterized by
reports of brain damage in children presenting with
abnormal behavior (Ross and Ross 1976). Following the
lectures of Sir George Frederic Still in 1902, the assump-
tions of Tredgold in 1908, and the reports of the epidemic
encephalitis from 1917 to 1928, several cases of children
with behavior disorders were depicted who suffered from
‘‘gross lesions of the brain and a variety of acute diseases,
conditions, and injuries that presumably had resulted in
brain damage’’ (Ross and Ross 1976, p. 15). This indicated
the growing notion that brain damage was the cause of
(Ross and Ross 1976). Further
hyperactive behavior
research in the 1930s and 1940s supported the idea of a
causal connection between brain damage and deviant
behavior (Ross and Ross 1976). Children with a history of
head injury were found to develop behavior disorders
similar to the postencephalitic behavior disorder, while
studies of birth trauma discovered a causative link between
birth injury and mental retardation in children (Kessler
1980). Infections, lead toxicity, and epilepsy were also
found to be associated with various cognitive and behav-
ioral problems (Barkley 2006a). In the 1930s, several
researchers found a striking similarity in behavior between
lobe
hyperactive children and monkeys with a frontal
ablation (Barkley 2006a; Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker
2005) and ‘‘experiences with brain-injured soldiers in
particular have taught us that many a symptom considered
psychogenic may be due to an organic cause’’ (Goldstein
1942, cited by Kessler 1980, p. 22). Rosenfeld and Bradley
(1948) gave an account of typical behavior sequelae in
children who suffered asphyxiant illness in infancy. They
reported,

a fairly uniform overt behavior pattern in maladjusted
children who have experienced asphyxiant illness in
infancy. Six cardinal behavior characteristics make
up this syndrome and may be listed as follows: 1.
Unpredictable variability in mood; 2. Hypermotility;
3. Impulsiveness; 4. Short attention span; 5. Fluctuant
ability to recall material previously learned; and 6.
Conspicuous difﬁculty with arithmetic in school.
(p. 74)

The notion of a physiological explanation of behavior
disorders was remarkable (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker
2005). This led to the concept of ‘‘brain damage’’ (Kessler
1980) and the idea that hyperactivity in children may be
caused by damage to the brain (Barkley 2006a). The new

123

250

K. W. Lange et al.

concept of ‘‘minimal brain damage’’ (Kessler 1980) was
based on several considerations. First, Tredgold had stated
that mild forms of brain damage in infancy, although
unnoticed at the time, could lead to behavioral sequelae,
which became ﬁrst apparent at school (Ross and Ross
1976). Second, possible variations of brain damage in
extent, locus, or type of lesion were discussed (Kessler
1976). Third, the concept of ‘‘a continuum of cerebral
damage ranging from severe abnormalities, such as cere-
bral palsy and mental deﬁciency, to minimal damage’’ was
introduced by Knobloch and Pasamanick (1959, p. 1384).
This new concept was characterized by the assumption
that minimal damage to the brain, even when it cannot be
demonstrated objectively, causes hyperactive behavior
(Barkley 2006a; Ross and Ross 1976) and, in turn, ‘‘that
even when brain damage could not be demonstrated it
could be presumed to be present’’ (Ross and Ross 1976,
p. 16). Under the inﬂuence of the work of Strauss and
Lehtinen (1947) and Strauss and Kephart (1955), it became
general practice to infer brain damage solely from behav-
ioral signs without any neurological evidence of damage
(Barkley 2006a; Ross and Ross 1976). In brain-injured and
non-brain-injured mentally retarded children, Strauss and
his colleagues identiﬁed a number of behavior patterns, on
the basis of which they could distinguish these two groups
(Ross and Ross 1976). In particular, they considered the
symptom of hyperactivity as a sufﬁcient diagnostic sign of
underlying brain damage (Ross and Ross 1976). Minimal
brain damage was therefore supposed to be clearly asso-
ciated with a speciﬁc syndrome (Conners 2000). Most
symptoms described in this context meet the current DSM-
IV-TR criteria, and the concept of minimal brain damage
can be regarded as historical antecedent to ADHD. Laufer
et al. (1957) describe the following characteristics of the
syndrome:

It has long been recognized and accepted that a per-
sistent disturbance of behavior of a characteristic
kind may be noted after severe head injury, epidemic
encephalitis and communicable disease encephalop-
athies, such as measles, in children. It has often been
observed that a behavior pattern of a similar nature
may be found in children who present no clear-cut
history of any of the classical causes mentioned. This
pattern will henceforth be referred to as hyperkinetic
impulse disorder. In brief summary, hyperactivity is
the most striking item. This may be noted from early
infancy on or not become prominent until ﬁve or six
years of age. There are also a short attention span and
poor powers of concentration, which are particularly
noticeable under school conditions. Variability also is
frequent, with the child being described as quite
in
unpredictable

ﬂuctuations

123

performance. The child is impulsive and does things
‘‘on the spur of the moment,’’ without apparent pre-
meditation. Outstandingly also these children seem
unable to tolerate any delay in gratiﬁcation of their
needs and demands. They are irritable and explosive,
with low frustration tolerance. (Laufer et al. 1957)

Minimal brain dysfunction

The hypothesis that minimal brain damage may lead to
behavior disorders became well established. In the 1960s,
however, many critics emerged who criticized the tests
commonly used in the assessment of brain damage
(Herbert 1964) and challenged the argument that every
child presenting with abnormal behavior was to have
minimal brain damage, even if this could neurologically
not be demonstrated (Birch 1964; Rapin 1964, cited by
Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). Laufer et al. (1957)
regarded it as a problem that there were ‘‘children who
present the hyperkinetic impulse disorder without having
any of the classic etiologic traumatic or infectious factors
in their historical backgrounds’’ (Laufer et al. 1957). In
their study, they found that ‘‘children with the hyperkinetic
impulse disorder, regardless of whether or not their history
contains clear-cut evidence of any agent causing injury to
the central nervous system’’ (Laufer et al. 1957, p. 42) had
a lower threshold for clinical responses in EEG to the
administration of metrazol
the
hyperkinetic syndrome. Following the administration of
amphetamines, however, the threshold was similar to that
of children without evidence of the syndrome (Laufer et al.
1957). Laufer and his colleagues supposed a dysfunction of
the diencephalon to be the cause of the hyperkinetic syn-
drome (Laufer et al. 1957). Their results suggested a
functional disturbance rather than damage to the brain as
the cause of the characteristic syndrome (Conners 2000). In
the Oxford International Study Group of Child
1963,
Neurology (Bax and MacKeith 1963) held a conference
and stated that brain damage should not be inferred from
problematic behavior signs alone.

than children without

It became clear that this term has, for most people,
the anatomical and aetiological
implications that
there has been an episode of injury and that this has
produced anatomical change. Yet closer examination
makes it clear that evidence of anatomical damage is
usually absent, that evidence or history of an injuring
process is often absent, and that disorder of function
is the evidence used for applying the diagnostic label
of ‘‘minimal brain damage’’ (Bax and MacKeith,
1963, unpaginated foreword, cited by Conners,
2000).

The history of attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder

251

The Oxford International Study Group of Child Neurology
therefore advocated a shift in terminology by replacing
the term ‘‘minimal brain damage’’ by ‘‘minimal brain
dysfunction’’ (Ross and Ross 1976; Rothenberger and
Neuma¨rker 2005). They furthermore recommended that
any effort should be undertaken to classify the heteroge-
neous group of children subsumed under the concept of
minimal brain dysfunction into smaller and more homog-
enous subgroups (Ross and Ross 1976). Another confer-
ence held in 1963 by the National Institute of Neurological
Diseases and Blindness (Conners 2000; Kessler 1980)
assigned a national task force to work on terminology and
identiﬁcation of minimal brain dysfunction (Rie 1980). The
task force formulated the following ofﬁcial
national
deﬁnition (Clements 1966):

The term minimal brain dysfunction refers to children
of near average, average or above average general
intelligence with certain learning or behavioural dis-
abilities ranging from mild to severe, which are
associated with deviations of function of the central
nervous system. These deviations may manifest
themselves by various combinations of impairment in
perception, conceptualisation,
language, memory
and control of attention, impulse or motor function.
(pp. 9 f.)

With regard to the etiology of the disorder, the concept of
minimal brain dysfunction emphasized neurological factors
including prenatal or perinatal ‘‘cerebral hypoxic lesions’’
(Towbin 1971) rather than environmental or social factors,
such as parents and family, which were proposed by
psychoanalysts
(Barkley 2006a, Clements and Peters
1962). Since the deﬁnition of minimal brain dysfunction
by Clements (1966) separates the symptoms ‘‘[impairment
in] control of attention,
impulse and motor function’’
(Clements 1966, p. 10) by the conjunction ‘‘and’’ from
other ‘‘various combinations of impairment’’ (Clements
1966, pp. 9 f.), these three symptoms can be seen as ‘‘the
central or deﬁning criterion for MBD [minimal brain
dysfunction]’’ (Conners 2000, p. 182). The concept of the
three main symptoms of
impulsivity, and
hyperactivity characterizing ADHD was therefore estab-
lished with the deﬁnition of minimal brain dysfunction.
The assignment of children with minimal brain dysfunction
to the normal range of intelligence and therefore the
differentiation from ‘‘the brain-damaged mentally subnor-
mal groups’’ (Clements 1966, p. 9) were important regard-
ing the further conceptualization of ADHD.

inattention,

Hyperkinetic reaction of childhood
(1968, second edition of the diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders: DSM-II)

‘‘The original concept of MBD (…) was not intended as a
ﬁnal statement on the subject’’ (Clements and Peters 1973
cited by Rie 1980). Although this concept persisted until
the 1980s (Barkley 2006a), its decline already began in the
1960s when severe critiques arose (Rothenberger and
Neuma¨rker 2005). The presence of neurodevelopmental
abnormalities was argued to be non-speciﬁc and also
common in other psychiatric disorders (Schaffe et al. et al.
1985, cited by Conners 2000). It was found that many cases
of known brain damage or dysfunction did not show
hyperactivity or other symptoms postulated by the concept
of minimal brain damage or dysfunction (Birch 1964, cited
by Conners 2000). Minimal brain dysfunction was criti-
cized as too general and heterogeneous and was later to be
replaced by multiple more speciﬁc and descriptive labels
such as ‘‘hyperactivity’’, ‘‘learning disability’’, ‘‘dyslexia’’
or ‘‘language disorders’’ (Barkley 2006a; Rothenberger and
Neuma¨rker 2005). Rie (1980) argued that the deﬁnition of
minimal brain dysfunction was ‘‘more speculative than
deﬁnitive’’, had no solid empirical basis, and lacked evi-
dence. Further efforts to deﬁne the disorder were therefore
based on objective observations of children’s deﬁcits,
‘‘rather than on some underlying unobservable etiological
mechanism in the brain’’ (Barkley 2006a, p. 8). In this
context, ‘‘hyperactivity [was] the most striking item’’ as
was already stated in 1957 by Laufer, Denhoff and
Solomons. Their idea of a ‘‘hyperkinetic impulse disorder’’
(Laufer et al. 1957) was continued in the 1960s, and the
concept of a hyperactivity syndrome was generated
(Barkley 2006a). Hyperactivity was recognized to be ‘‘a
behavioral
syndrome that could arise from organic
pathology, but could also occur in its absence. Even so, it
would continue to be viewed as the result of some bio-
logical difﬁculty, rather than due solely to environmental
causes’’ (Barkley 2006a, p. 8). In 1968, a deﬁnition of the
concept of hyperactivity was incorporated in the ofﬁcial
diagnostic nomenclature,
the second edition of the
i.e.
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-II) (Barkley 2006a; Volkmar 2003). This concept
was labeled ‘‘Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood’’ and
deﬁned with two sentences: ‘‘The disorder is characterized
restlessness, distractibility, and short
by overactivity,
attention span, especially in young children; the behavior
usually diminishes by adolescence’’ (American Psychiatric
Association 1968, p. 50, cited by Barkley 2006a, p. 9).

Attention deﬁcit disorder: with and without
hyperactivity (1980, third edition of the diagnostic
and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-III)

In the 1970s, the predominant focus on hyperactivity was
in
shifted toward an emphasis on the attention deﬁcit
affected children (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). In a
paper addressed to the Canadian Psychological Associa-
tion, Douglas (1972) argued that deﬁcits in sustained
attention and impulse control were more signiﬁcant fea-
tures of the disorder than hyperactivity (cited by Barkley
2006a; Douglas 1984; Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005).
In addition, these symptoms were the ones showing the
best response to stimulant treatment (Douglas 1972, cited
by Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). Douglas’ paper
was very inﬂuential at
the time and provoked further
research on this issue and ﬁnally initiated a complete
the Hyperkinetic
change in the conceptualization of
Reaction of Childhood (Barkley 2006a). ‘‘In 1980, the
importance of attentional problems in the syndrome was
recognized—and perhaps exaggerated—by the adoption of
a new diagnostic label’’ (Douglas 1984). With the publi-
cation of DSM-III in 1980,
the American Psychiatric
Association renamed the disorder ‘‘Attention Deﬁcit Dis-
order (ADD) (with or without hyperactivity)’’ (Barkley
2006a; Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker 2005). DSM-III took
the position that hyperactivity was no longer an essential
diagnostic criterion for the disorder and that the syndrome
occurred in two types ‘‘with or without hyperactivity’’
(Conners 2000). Deﬁcits in attention and impulse control
were, however, considered signiﬁcant symptoms in estab-
lishing a diagnosis (Barkley 2006a).
In this respect,
DSM-III departed from the ‘‘International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases (ICD-9)’’ by the World Health Organization,
which continued to focus on hyperactivity as indicator of
the disorder. DSM-III developed three separate symptom
lists for inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, which
were far more speciﬁc than previous ones (Barkley 2006a).
In addition, DSM-III introduced ‘‘an explicit numerical
cutoff score for symptoms, speciﬁc guidelines for age of
onset and duration of symptoms, and the requirement of
exclusion of other childhood psychiatric conditions’’
(Barkley 2006a, pp. 19 f.)

Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(1987, revision of the third edition of the diagnostic
and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-III-R)

The discussion regarding the importance of certain symp-
toms continued, and the creation of subtypes of ADD on
the basis of the presence or absence of hyperactivity was
discussed controversially (Barkley 2006a). When the

123

concept of ADD was formulated, ‘‘little, if any empirical
research on this issue existed’’ (Barkley 2006a). At that
time, it was not evident if the attention deﬁcit of the sub-
type of ADD without hyperactivity was qualitatively sim-
ilar to that of the subtype with hyperactivity, or if the two
types had to be considered as two separate psychiatric
disorders (Barkley 2006a). In order to further improve the
criteria, in particular with respect to empirical validation,
the revision of the third edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) in
1987 removed the concept of two subtypes and renamed
the disorder
‘‘Attention deﬁcit-Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD)’’. The symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity were combined into a single list of symptoms
with a single cutoff score. The symptoms were empirically
derived by rating scales and a ﬁeld trial (Barkley 2006a;
Conners 2000). The subtype ‘‘ADD without hyperactivity’’
was removed and assigned to a residual category named
‘‘undifferentiated ADD’’ (Rothenberger and Neuma¨rker
2005).

Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(1994, fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV)

In addition to the reorganization of the concept of ADD,
several studies examined the existence of subtypes of
ADD at the end of the 1980s (Barkley 2006a). It was
found that children with ADD without hyperactivity dif-
fered from children with ADD with hyperactivity in that
they were ‘‘more daydreamy, hypoactive, lethargic, and
disabled in academic achievement, but as substantially
less aggressive and less rejected by their peers’’ (Barkley
2006a, p. 21). In addition, some doubts arose as to the
central role of a deﬁcit in attention in so-called ADHD.
The view emerged that motivational factors and deﬁcits in
importance
reinforcement mechanisms were of major
(Barkley 2006a). Historical interpretations of brain dam-
age or dysfunction were supported by the evidence of
structural abnormalities in the brain of children with
ADHD as shown with new neuroimaging techniques. Up
until the end of the 1990s, most studies ‘‘have implicated
the prefrontal-striatal network as being smaller in children
with ADHD’’ (Barkley 2006a). Further research found a
genetic component of the disorder (Biederman et al. 1990,
cited by Barkley 2006a). It was ﬁnally recognized in the
1990s that ADHD was not exclusively a childhood dis-
order, which disappeared with age as was previously
thought (Barkley 2006a), but rather a chronic, persistent
disorder remaining into adulthood in many cases (Do¨pfner
et al. 2000). Before the fourth edition of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) was

The history of attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder

253

outlined in 1994, another large ﬁeld trial was conducted
(Lahey et al. 1994). Three subtypes of ADHD were
identiﬁed on the basis of structured diagnostic interviews
of multiple informants and of validation diagnoses. The
previously heterogeneous category of ADHD according to
DSM-III-R was consequently subdivided into three sub-
types (Lahey et al. 1994), i.e. a predominantly inattentive
type, a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and a
combined type with symptoms of both dimensions
(American Psychiatric Association 1994). By using this
categorization, the concept of the two separate dimensions
of attention deﬁcit and hyperactivity-impulsivity was
reverted (Conners 2000) and the possibility of a diagnosis
of a purely inattentive form of the disorder was reintro-
duced (Barkley 2006a). The American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation accredited the diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood by
including examples of workplace difﬁculties
in the
depiction of symptoms. ‘‘Based on a much larger ﬁeld
trial than any of their predecessors, the DSM-IV criteria
for ADHD are the most empirically based in the history of
this disorder’’ (Barkley 2006a).

Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(2000, text revision of the fourth edition
of the diagnostic and statistical manual
of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR)

In order to bridge the span between DSM-IV and DSM-V,
a text revision of the fourth edition of the DSM was
undertaken in 2000 (American Psychiatric Association
2000). The main goals were to ‘‘maintain the currency of
the DSM-IV text’’
(American Psychiatric Association
2009) and to correct any errors identiﬁed in the DSM-IV
text. ‘‘Thus, most of the major changes in DSM-IV-TR
were conﬁned to the descriptive text’’ (American Psychi-
atric Association 2009). The deﬁnition of ADHD has
therefore not been changed. A new edition of the DSM is in
progress. Critics have called for a validation of ADHD in
adults (Fischer and Barkley 2007; McGough and Barkley
2004). Since the DSM-IV ﬁeld trials for ADHD included
only children and adolescents up to the age of 17 (Lahey
et al. 1994), the utility of the DSM-IV criteria in the
diagnosis of adults with ADHD has been challenged
(Fischer and Barkley 2007). The publication of the ﬁfth
edition of the DSM is not scheduled until 2012.
DSM-IV and ICD-10 have adopted almost

identical
criteria for the identiﬁcation of inattentive, hyperactive,
and impulsive symptoms. However, signiﬁcant differences
are still evident in the number of criteria in each domain
required for a diagnosis, the importance of inattention and
the handling of comorbidity. In comparison with DSM-IV,
cross-situational
ICD-10 is more demanding about

pervasiveness and requires that all necessary criteria be
present, both at home and at school or other situations.

Future directions

The development of the international classiﬁcation systems
appears to reﬂect a growing consensus regarding the
clinical entity of ADHD. Evidence has been presented
(Faraone 2005) to show that ADHD meets the criteria
established by Robins and Guze (1970) for the validation
of psychiatric diagnoses. Patients with ADHD show a
characteristic pattern of hyperactivity,
inattention, and
impulsivity that lead to adverse outcomes. ADHD can be
distinguished from other psychiatric disorders including
those with which it is frequently comorbid. Longitudinal
studies have demonstrated that ADHD is invariably chronic
and not an episodic disorder. Twin studies show that
ADHD is a highly heritable disorder. Molecular genetic
studies have found genes that explain some of the disor-
der’s genetic transmission. Neuroimaging studies show that
ADHD patients have abnormalities in frontal-subcortical-
cerebellar systems involved in the regulation of attention,
motor behavior, and inhibition. Many individuals with
ADHD show a therapeutic response to medications that
block the dopamine or noradrenaline transporter. This
evidence as reviewed by Faraone (2005) supports the
hypothesis of ADHD being a clinical entity and fulﬁlling
the Robins and Guze (1970) validity criteria.

However, there has been considerable debate about this
issue. Critics have described ADHD as a diagnosis used to
label difﬁcult children who are not ill but whose behavior is
at the extreme end of the normal range. Concerns have
been raised that ‘‘ADHD is not a disease per se but rather a
group of symptoms representing a ﬁnal common behavioral
pathway for a gamut of emotional, psychological, and/or
learning problems’’ (Furman 2005). Most of the research
i.e.
studies available rely on clinically referred cases,
severely ill or narrowly diagnosed patients. The general-
ization of the research ﬁndings to non-referred cases in the
community is therefore not necessarily valid.

In summary, the cardinal ADHD symptoms of inatten-
tion, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are not unique to
ADHD. In addition, there is a remarkable overlap of these
ADHD symptoms with those of comorbid mental health
conditions or learning problems. A consistent genetic
marker has not been found, and neuroimaging studies have
been unable to identify a distinctive etiology for ADHD.
The lack of evidence of a unique genetic, biological, or
neurological pathology hinders the general acceptance of
ADHD as a neurobehavioral disease entity. In addition, the
ratings of school children with ADHD by parents and
teachers are frequently discrepant and do not appear to

123

provide an objective diagnostic basis. The issue of the
clinical entity of ADHD remains therefore an open ques-
tion and requires further investigation.
