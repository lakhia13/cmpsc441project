Abstract
Background  There is currently a high demand for bereavement support coupled with inconclusive findings as to 
the efficacy of existing approaches. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) aims to improve human functioning 
and has shown efficacy across a wide range of conditions. ACT may be a promising means of supporting bereaved 
people, yet evidence on the use of ACT for bereavement support is lacking. The aim of this study is to explore how 
ACT is currently used for bereavement support and practitioner perspectives of how it helps following bereavement.

Methods  Semi-structured interviews were conducted online via MS Teams with practitioners experienced in using 
ACT for bereavement support. Data were analysed thematically guided by a framework approach.

Results  Nine participants were recruited. Three themes were identified: (i) creating psychological space around grief; 
(ii) using psychological space for value-directed action in the midst of grieving, and (iii) adapting ACT for bereavement 
support. Practitioners indicated that ACT improves clients’ relationship with distressing internal experiences. 
Metaphors and mindfulness techniques were used to encourage acceptance of grief responses, taking perspective 
on distressing thoughts and images, and contact with the present moment. Better relationships with distressing 
experiences were regarded as less psychologically taxing, improving coping and well-being, while providing the 
psychological space to engage in value-directed action. Values exploration, sometimes using metaphors and 
exercises, was seen as supporting the bereaved person to rediscover a sense of purpose and engage in meaningful 
activities alongside their grief. Practitioners used ACT flexibly, integrating other interventions, and adapted ACT to the 
perceived sensitivities of bereaved people, and age-related and developmental factors.

Conclusion  ACT is used to support people who have been bereaved to live effectively with the difficult thoughts 
and feelings associated with grieving and to enable them to gradually identify, reconnect with, and act in line with 
their values after loss.

Background
Grieving  involves  a  range  of  powerful  cognitive,  emo-
tional,  and  behavioural  disturbances  that  typically  last 
between  6  and  12  months  but  can  endure  significantly 
longer  [1,  2].  These  may  include  intense  yearning,  sad-
ness,  guilt,  anger,  loneliness,  and  disbelief;  ruminative 
thoughts and memories; loss of motivation, meaning and 
purpose;  and  disengagement  from  social,  leisure,  and 
other valued activities [3, 4]. Consequently, grief is often 
accompanied by significant distress and dysfunction [5]. 
Generally, grief becomes less intense over time: rumina-
tions  and  emotions diminish  in  frequency and intensity, 
the  reality  of  the  loss  is  accepted,  and  a  renewed  sense 
of  purpose  is  developed  [6].  While  grieving  continues, 
it  becomes  integrated  with  life  [7].  The  grieving  period 
varies  by  individual  and  is  influenced  by  factors  such  as 
the relationship with the deceased, the age and cause of 
death, and culture (e.g. 8–10). However, some individuals 
experience difficulties in the integration of loss. An esti-
mated 7–10% of individuals develop prolonged grief dis-
order [11, 12], which describes the persistence of intense 
grief  and  associated  symptoms  severe  enough  to  cause 
problems in the person’s life [13].

including 

Approximately 40% of people may benefit from formal 
bereavement  support  provided  by  trained  volunteers, 
health  and  social  care  professionals,  or  mental  health 
specialists, 
therapists,  psychologists,  and 
counsellors  [14,  15].  Yet  in  a  survey  of  bereaved  people 
(N = 2189)  conducted  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  in 
2019, only 9% received support of any kind and, of those, 
only 35% found it helpful [16]. Moreover, a recent assess-
ment  of  UK  bereavement  support  found  it  to  be  highly 
varied  and  lacking  in  evidence  for  its  effectiveness  [17]. 
Bereaved people are at increased risk of prolonged grief 
disorder  [12],  other  psychological  disorders  [18],  and 
suicide [4]. While only a minority develop psychological 
disorders  and  suicide  is  rare,  the  severity  of  such  out-
comes coupled with the intense distress and dysfunction 
associated with grieving call for timely access to effective 
bereavement support.

Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  (ACT,  said  as 
one word rather than three letters) is a form of cognitive 
behavioural therapy typically covered by health insurance 
in  the  United  States  of  America  (USA)  and  provided  by 
competent  practitioners  in  the  United  Kingdom’s  (UK) 
free-to-access National Health Service. It is theoretically 
well-suited  to  improving  coping  and  well-being  follow-
ing bereavement. The aim of ACT is to increase psycho-
logical  flexibility  by  promoting  acceptance  of  unwanted 
inner experiences and commitment to behaviour change 
in  a  value-directed  way  [19].  Psychological  flexibility  is 
the  ability  to  locate  oneself  in  the  present  moment  with 
full  awareness,  while  adapting  one’s  behaviours  towards 
valued  ends  regardless  of  the  presence  of  distressing 

experiences  [18,  20].  Psychological  flexibility  comprises 
six overlapping and interdependent processes (21; Fig. 1).
Acceptance  is  embracing  inner  experiences  (such  as 
feelings  and  thoughts)  as  they  are.  Acceptance  does  not 
mean  people  have  to  like  their  painful  experiences.  It  is 
a  willingness  to  contact  inner  experiences  with  a  more 
welcoming  stance  instead  of  fighting  or  avoiding  them 
[22].  Avoidance  of  unwanted  thoughts  and  feelings  has 
been shown to have negative effects on functioning [21]. 
Cognitive defusion is the process of unhooking attention 
from the content of distressing thoughts and images and 
observing  them  for  what  they  are  –  thoughts  –  rather 
than  being  excessively  reactive  to  their  content.  Con-
tact with the present moment is the ability to pay atten-
tion flexibly to any current experience rather than being 
unwittingly absorbed by them, such as rumination about 
the past or worry about the future [22]. Self-as-context is 
the  recognition  of  the  self  as  the  observer  of  experience 
rather  than  its  content  [23].  This  is  sometimes  referred 
to  as  the  ‘noticing  self ’  or  ‘observing  self ’  –  the  aspect 
of  ourselves  that  is  aware  of  what  we  are  thinking,  feel-
ing, sensing, or doing in the moment. It can also refer to 
flexible perspective taking – the ability to perceive events 
from  alternative  points  of  view  (e.g.  that  of  a  partner, 
close friend, ‘inner child’, or ‘future self ’). Values clarity is 
being able to recognise what matters most on an ongoing 
basis and using values to motivate and guide our behav-
iour.  They  are  different  from  goals,  as  goals  are  obtain-
able  while  values  are  qualities  of  ongoing  action  (e.g. 
acting  with  honesty,  kindness,  or  creativity)  [23].  Com-
mitted  action  is  doing  what  needs  to  be  done  to  live  by 
our  values,  even  when  that  brings  up  difficult  thoughts 
or feelings. This includes physical action (explicit action) 
and psychological action (how we manage thoughts and 
feelings).

Acceptance,  defusion,  contact  with 

the  present 
moment,  and  self-as-context  constitute  the  mindfulness 
processes [24]. ACT engages these processes through an 
array of metaphorical and mindfulness exercises [25]. For 
example, paying close attention to thoughts and feelings 
without resistance, and taking perspective from them by 
imagining that they are like clouds in the sky, coming and 
going, and sometimes returning [26]. ACT fosters values 
clarity  and  committed  action  through  self-exploration 
and  goal-setting  exercises.  For  people  who  have  been 
bereaved,  these  processes  may  improve  their  ability  to 
cope with intense grief-related emotions and rumination, 
while  processes  linked  with  clarifying  values  and  com-
mitted action may help with issues such as a loss of moti-
vation,  meaning,  and  purpose,  and  disengagement  from 
activities.

ACT fits well with two prominent theories of grieving – 
the Dual Process Model [27] and Continuing Bonds [28]. 
According to the Dual Process Model there are loss- and

restoration-related  bereavement  stressors.  Loss-oriented 
coping  involves  the  processing  of  events  leading  up  to 
the death, accepting its finality, and confronting intrusive 
thoughts  of  the  deceased.  Restoration-oriented  coping 
involves attending to changes caused by the death, engag-
ing  in  new  activities,  and  establishing  a  revised  identity 
and  social  role.  Bereaved  individuals  cope  by  oscillating 
between  these  orientations.  Continuing  bonds  with  the 
deceased  through  an  ongoing  inner  relationship  may 
also improve coping while grieving [29], for example, by 
reminiscing, keeping photographs and possessions, or by 
retaining the deceased’s values internally and expressing 
them through action [30]. ACT’s focus on contacting the 
present moment, accepting unwanted inner experiences, 
and  committing  to  value-directed  behaviour  change 
may  facilitate  the  movement  between  loss-oriented  and 
restoration-oriented  processes  by  helping 
individu-
als  track  what  is  influencing  them  and  make  more  con-
scious  choices  about  how  they  deal  with  situations,  and 
the thoughts and emotions that they occasion. Moreover, 
this focus may also help them to engage with the memory 
of  the  deceased  and  bring  it  into  the  future  with  them 
(continuing bonds). Despite its potential, research on the 
use of ACT for bereavement support is lacking. A recent 
systematic  review  identified  only  one  published  paper 
[31]  and  one  doctoral  thesis  [32]  focused  on  its  use  for 
bereavement  support  [33].  The  former  is  a  randomised 

control trial involving 106 bereaved carers assigned to an 
ACT  intervention  or  control  group  [31].  The  interven-
tion – an ACT self-help booklet and telephone support – 
was  feasible  and  acceptable  to  participants,  though  data 
attrition  was  high,  and  effect-sizes  were  small  and  not 
statistically significant. The doctoral study used interpre-
tative  phenomenological  analysis  to  explore  experiences 
of two bereaved spouses and six therapists who had used 
ACT for bereaved support. The bereaved spouses found 
that  ACT  helped  them  deal  effectively  with  undesirable 
thoughts  and  feelings  and  supported  them  to  identify 
memories,  which  facilitated  a  continuing  bond  with  the 
deceased and helped them re-engage with life. Therapists 
found that ACT was useful in helping normalise grief as 
opposed  to  problematising  it,  and  all  reported  positive 
experiences with using ACT for bereavement support.

Aims
Given  the  dearth  of  research,  further  exploratory  work 
is  needed  as  a  first  step  to  understanding  how  ACT  is 
used in practice for bereavement support. Specifically, we 
aimed  to  answer  the  following  questions  from  the  per-
spective of practitioners:

  • How is ACT used for bereavement support in 

practice?

  • Which ACT processes are perceived by practitioners 

Data analysis

as core to bereavement support?

  • How does ACT lead to improvements in coping and 

well-being following bereavement?

The findings will inform the development of ACT-based 
interventions to improve coping and well-being for peo-
ple struggling with grief and loss.

Methods
Design

A  qualitative  study  involving  online  semi-structured 
interviews conducted via MS Teams.

Participants

We recruited practitioners who use ACT to support cli-
ents  who  have  been  bereaved.  To  be  eligible,  potential 
participants needed to have had some formal training in 
ACT; consider themselves competent in delivering ACT; 
have  at  least  one  year  of  experience  using  ACT  to  sup-
port  bereaved  people;  and  speak  English.  There  was  no 
restriction on the location of participants.

Participant recruitment

We  used  convenience  sampling.  We  posted  adverts  for 
the  study  on  social  media  including  Twitter  and  Linke-
dIn. We also advertised the study on the global, and the 
UK and Ireland Contextual Behaviour Science Facebook 
pages  and  shared  information  about  the  study  with  two 
hospices  in  Scotland.  Potential  participants  emailed  the 
research team for further information and received a link 
to  a  webpage,  which  included  the  participant  informa-
tion sheet and consent form. On completion of the con-
sent  form,  participants  were  asked  to  complete  a  short 
questionnaire to provide some background demographic 
information so the sample could be described.

Data collection

Interviews were conducted online via MS Teams by mas-
ters-level postgraduate researchers NW, AP, ID and XG, 
who received training in qualitative research. Interviews 
were  audio  and  video  recorded  and  lasted  between  25 
and  60  min,  with  an  average  time  of  50  min.  To  ensure 
quality  and  consistency,  the  interviews  were  conducted 
in pairs. One researcher acted as the lead interviewer and 
the other kept time, tracked the interview schedule, and 
was  permitted  to  ask  participants  to  elaborate.  The  pair 
would  then  swap  roles  in  the  next  interview.  Interviews 
were  automatically  transcribed  by  MS  Teams  software 
and cross-checked and amended against interview audio 
by one of the researchers. The researchers had no previ-
ous relationship with the participants.

Interview  data  were  analysed  by  NW,  AP,  ID  and  XG 
using  the  framework  approach  [34].  Both  inductive  and 
deductive  analysis  were  used.  The  analysis  was  con-
ducted in seven stages supported by NVivo 12 Plus cod-
ing software [35]. The steps included transcription, data 
familiarisation, coding, analytic framework development, 
framework application, charting and interpretation [34]. 
This  approach  allowed  us  to  structure  the  data  within 
the parameters of the research questions while retaining 
open coding and unanticipated theme generation, which 
balances  relevance  and  scope.  Data  were  arranged  in 
framework matrices that link data with codes and cases. 
This  facilitated  thorough  data  comparisons  within  and 
across cases [34]. For the interview schedule, participant 
characteristics  questionnaire,  analytic  framework,  an 
example  framework  matrix,  and  an  early  thematic  map, 
see Supplementary Information.

Reflexivity

Quality was enhanced and researcher bias minimised in 
several ways. First, we followed the Consolidated Criteria 
for  Reporting  Qualitative  Research  (COREQ;  36)  guide-
lines  wherever  possible  (see  limitations).  Second,  the 
research team met frequently over a period of six months 
to  reflect  on  the  research  process  and  data.  Third,  the 
researchers  undertaking  data  analysis  compared  and 
honed  their  analytic  frameworks  and  then  iteratively 
charted data and refined coding through the framework 
matrices. These  processes  increased  credibility  by  trian-
gulating  data  analysis,  maximising  its  relevance  to  the 
data  and  ensuring  thematic  saturation  [34,  37].  Fourth, 
the  methods  section  and  supplementary  information 
provide  an  audit  trail  of  decision-making,  analytic  pro-
cesses, and materials, which increased transparency [38]. 
Fifth,  a  description  of  the  research  setting  and  partici-
pants  (see  Table  1)  facilitates  the  reader’s  interpretation 
of the data [37]. Sixth, each researcher undertaking data 
collection  and  analysis  kept  a  reflexive  journal,  analys-
ing  and  sharing  their  subjective  responses  to  the  data 
[39]. Seventh, participants were sent the final draft of the 
research article for review.

Results
Participant characteristics

Nine  participants  were  recruited  –  four  clinical  psy-
chologists, three social workers, one counsellor, and one 
psychological therapist. Most had used ACT for bereave-
ment support for two to three years (range: 1–16 years). 
All  participants  self-identified  as  ethnically  white.  Six 
were based in the UK and three were based in the USA.

Overarching themes

Three  overarching  themes  and  nine  sub-themes  (Fig.  2) 
were  identified  regarding  practitioners’  perspectives  on 
how  ACT  is  used  to  improve  coping  and  well-being  for 
bereaved people:

(1) creating psychological space around grief
(2) using psychological space for value-directed action in 

the midst of grieving 

(3)  adapting ACT for bereavement support

Theme 1: creating psychological space around grief
Accepting rather than avoiding grief

Practitioners  reported  clients  often  tried  to  avoid  dis-
tressing  thoughts,  memories,  and  emotions,  and  viewed 
grief  avoidance  strategies  as  disruptive,  exhausting,  and 
futile.  These  strategies  included  repression  of,  and  dis-
traction from, distressing internal experiences.

It’s  difficult  for  any  of  us  to  have  control  over  our 
thoughts and feelings. And, in a way, it’s a waste of 
time.  […]  The  energy  around  trying  to  control  the 
thoughts is exhausting. (Angus)

Avoidance  strategies  were  seen  as  stalling  the  grieving 
process. Practitioners reported that accepting rather than 
avoiding the presence of grief-related experiences had the 
dual benefit of reducing the struggle with internal experi-
ences and allowing the grieving process to continue.

Is  the  avoidance  what  prolongs  people’s  challenge? 
[…]  The  other  theme  that  comes  up  for  me  is  that 
grief wants to be grieved. So, you know, avoidance is 
not only relatively futile, but it feels counterintuitive. 
(Danielle)

Practitioners  encouraged  clients  to  stay  in  contact  with 
distressing  internal  experiences  and  allow  grieving  by 
facilitating  their  willingness  to  feel  loss  and  pain.  Cli-
ents were often perceived as naïve regarding grief, failing 

to  realise  the  extent  of  its  psychological  and  physiologi-
cal  consequences.  According  to  practitioners,  they  were 
thereby also unable to articulate their experiences, which 
increased  fear  and  the  sense  of  being  overwhelmed. 
Acceptance  was  facilitated  by  promoting  literal,  meta-
phorical, and experiential understanding of grief through 
psychoeducation  and  mindfulness  exercises.  For  exam-
ple, Alba and Samantha used a metaphor which describes 
suffering  and  value  as  two  sides  of  a  coin:  people  suffer 
only because something they value is at stake.

We  could  just  […]  chuck  [the  coin]  away;  get  rid  of 
it. But then what are you left with? So, you get rid of 
the sadness and the pain, but you’re left without the 
sweet  moments  of  care  and  love  you  had  with  that 
person.  […]  Most  people  say  ‘You  know  what?  I’m 
gonna keep it’. (Samantha)

Mindfulness  techniques  provided  experiential  under-
standing  by  encouraging  clients  to  notice  and  become 
familiar  with  mental  and  physiological  experiences 
related to grief.

I think there’s something about working with people 
at the beginning to, kind of, accept what grief maybe 
is and how it’s impacting on them. And a lot of peo-
ple want to move really quickly away from their grief 
or their feelings. So, I think a lot of that is trying to 
get people to notice what they’re feeling in their body. 
And that is through a lot of mindfulness techniques 
[…] so it feels a bit less scary. (Trisha)

Mindfulness  techniques  sometimes  had  imaginal  ele-
ments.  For  example,  to  help  clients  identify  and  stay 
with  an  experience,  some  practitioners  encouraged 
physical  visualisation  of  the  grief  experience–  whereby 
one  imagines  it  to  have  a  particular  shape  or  colour.  At 
other  times,  imaginal  mindfulness  exercises  were  used 
to encourage staying in contact with distressing internal 
experiences through self-compassion.

It’s a practice to identify […] a difficulty; to find it in 
a somatosensory way. ‘Does it feel like a kick in the 
gut? Does it feel like a punch to the throat? Where is 
it physically in my body?’ To then think of a source 
of  support,  compassion,  acceptance,  and  to  imag-
ine taking [their hand] – maybe that beloved friend, 
or  that  beloved  pet,  or  that  nurse  that  really  cares 
for you – and putting the hand on the stuck or hurt 
place.  And  then  breathing  into  that  place  with  a 
sense of acceptance and space. […] Instead of saying 
‘No, I won’t have this feeling’. (Ophelia)

Defusing from thoughts and memories

Practitioners  found  that  clients  were  often  consumed 
by  distressing  thoughts  and  memories  relating  to  their 
loss,  such  that  they  were  fused  with  them.  Practitioners 
regarded fusion as constant preoccupation with the con-
tent of thoughts and memories, leaving little or no space 
for  anything  else.  According  to  practitioners,  clients’ 
thoughts  and  memories  were  often  frightening,  trau-
matic,  or  centred  around  self-blame.  Fusion  was  viewed 
as  increasing  clients’  sense  of  being  overwhelmed  and 
reducing their capacity to be in the present moment and 
act.

All  of  us  are  struggling  with  difficult  thoughts.  [...] 
But  sometimes  those  thoughts  occupy  all  the  space. 
[…] So maybe we can do something to try to create 
some space in between [the client] and those memo-
ries and those ideas when there’s something else that 
deserves that space. (Pierre)

Practitioners  employed  ACT  techniques  to  support  cli-
ents  to  defuse,  which  they  viewed  as  creating  distance, 
or perspective, from these thoughts and memories while 
still allowing them to be present. The content of thoughts 
and  memories  was  not  challenged;  rather,  they  were  no 
longer  seen  as  necessarily  demanding  attention.  Taking 
perspective was thought to diminish distress by reducing 
the struggle with, and the sense of being overwhelmed by, 
distressing  thoughts  and  memories,  allowing  clients  to 
reconnect with the present moment.

Defusion  was  facilitated  through  psychoeducation,  as 
well  as  metaphorical  and  mindfulness  exercises.  Meta-
phors often served the dual purpose of explaining fusion 
and  how  to  defuse.  For  example,  Angus  would  use  the 
ACT  clipboard  metaphor  (Harris,  2019).  Clients  were 
asked to hold a clipboard vertically in front of their face. 
Angus  would  then  gently  push  on  the  back  of  the  clip-
board  which  caused  the  clients  to  resist.  When  asked 
what  they  could  see,  clients  usually  responded  ‘nothing’. 
When asked how they felt, clients usually said they were 

tired  from  holding  the  clipboard  and  struggling  against 
Angus’s gentle push.

This technique is one way of helping people live with 
those  distressing  images  and  any  thoughts  around 
it.  So,  if  you  imagine  [the  distressing  thoughts  and 
images  are]  what  your  clipboard  represents  and 
then,  when  [defusion]  happens,  if  you  just  imagine 
just putting it down in your lap, so you’re not ignor-
ing it – it’s in front of you. What that enables you to 
do, then, is to see beyond that and connect with the 
world. (Angus)

Mindfulness  techniques  were  also  used  to  generate  per-
spective  and  were  often  explained  with  metaphors.  Cli-
ents were encouraged to pay close attention to thoughts 
and memories, giving them a sense of being an observer 
separated from their content. For example, Trisha would 
ask clients to imagine their thoughts flowing by on water.

I  think  that  [it]  can  sometimes  take  the  fear  […]  or 
the power out of the thought. And it can give space 
for  somebody,  almost  […]  a  bit  of  respite  from  the 
thinking,  if  you  can  distance  the  thoughts  […]  so 
you’re not avoiding them, but you feel like you’ve got 
some  power  over  [them].  Like  just  watching  them 
instead,  rather  than  feeling  like  they’re  consuming 
you. (Trisha)

Practitioners  reported  that  several  ACT  processes  were 
involved  in  this  kind  of  exercise,  including  present 
moment  awareness  (paying  attention  to  thoughts  and 
memories), acceptance (not struggling with them), defu-
sion  (you  are  separate  from  your  thoughts  and  feelings, 
even difficult ones) and self-as-context (regarding the self 
as the observer or container of thought, not the content).

Some people will be really distressed by overwhelm-
ing  rumination  and  difficult  thoughts.  And  so,  I’ll 
start  on  defusion  and  [the  mindfulness  processes]. 
(Ophelia)

Managing overwhelming emotion

Practitioners also used ACT to support clients in reduc-
ing  overwhelm  in  the  face  of  distressing  emotions. 
Practitioners  used  the  same  methods  as  those  used  to 
encourage  willingness  to  grieve  (acceptance)  and  defu-
sion  from  distressing  thoughts  and  memories;  namely 
staying in contact with emotions but with perspective, so 
as not to avoid them or be consumed by them.

[My  client]  also  struggled  with,  like,  not  wanting  to 
have these less than pleasant feelings. […] And both

defusion and acceptance are really helpful for them. 
[…] We used […] techniques like ‘noticing that you’re 
having this feeling’ and ‘giving that feeling a little bit 
of space’, so that it’s not so all consuming. (Hanna)

really full, tremendous life that you were previously 
afraid to live. You’re at a party and someone says a 
speech about you. What do they say?’ (Ophelia).

I think learning […] the mindful observation skills of 
helping people learn how to emotion surf, of how to 
get some distance […] from the surge of overwhelm-
ing emotions […] is really helpful. (Samantha)

Using values to motivate committed action

Connecting with values was perceived as helpful in moti-
vating  committed  action,  providing  the  energy  and  pur-
pose to move forward after bereavement:

Theme 2: using psychological space for value-directed 
action in the midst of grieving
Reconnecting with values

According  to  practitioners,  a  key  element  of  ACT  for 
bereavement  support  is  helping  people  explicitly  iden-
tify  their  values  and  then  motivate  behaviour  or  action 
that is aligned with these values. Practitioners suggested 
there  were  two  obstacles  to  clients’  engagement  with 
value-directed  action.  First,  as  clients’  values  were  often 
entwined with the deceased, the loss of a loved one could 
entail the loss of shared purpose, meaning, and identity.

When  someone  dies  […]  it  questions  our  existence, 
our  purpose.  And  so,  we  routinely  are  with  people 
who  are  asking  themselves  the  question  ‘Why  am  I 
getting up today?’. (Angus)

Second,  overwhelming  emotion,  fusion  with  thoughts 
and  memories,  and  avoidance  were  viewed  as  consum-
ing,  exhausting,  and  taking  up  the  psychological  space 
needed for action. To improve coping, ACT was used to 
generate acceptance of, and perspective from, distressing 
internal experiences. As this creates psychological space 
around grief, practitioners claimed it provided the capac-
ity for action.

Anything that helps people sit in the present – even if 
it’s painful – then gives them the freedom to kind of 
choose what else they do. (Alba)

The values-based work is hugely important because 
whatever  path  they  choose  after  bereavement,  it 
will be painful. So, you’ve got to have a really strong 
sense of your values and who you are to help you do 
those things. (Alba)

Theme 3: adapting ACT for bereavement support
All ACT processes are core to bereavement support

Practitioners viewed ACT as targeting not the nature of 
distressing internal experiences but their clients’ relation-
ship with them: their avoidance of grief, their fusion with 
thoughts and memories, and their overwhelm in the face 
of  emotion.  Practitioners  reported  ACT  improves  cli-
ents’ coping and well-being by helping them to accept the 
presence of distressing internal experiences, while taking 
perspective from them, which reduces their struggle with 
these  experiences.  Practitioners  also  addressed  the  lack 
of meaning, purpose, and identity by reconnecting clients 
with  their  values,  encouraging  them  to  take  committed 
action within the newfound psychological space.

I think the foundation of ACT and bereavement care 
is  generating  and  engendering  the  capacity  to  hold 
difficult experiences of loss [so] that they are neither, 
like, consuming the person, nor are they avoided by 
the person […] And I think the, you know, ACT with-
out  the  life  worth  living  piece  […]  is  really  just  like 
a  stunted,  or  like  a  half-ACT.  So,  I  try  to  do  both. 
(Ophelia)

Practitioners sought to support clients to explicitly iden-
tify  their  values  through  gentle  questioning  (e.g.  asking 
‘What is important to you?’) and exercises. The exercises 
were either fictitious scenarios or worksheet inventories 
designed to help clients think about their values in differ-
ent areas of life – such as relationships, leisure, personal 
growth, and work – and how these informed past actions 
and  goals.  For  example,  Ophelia  used  an  ACT  exercise 
designed to help people elicit their values by taking per-
spective on their lives:

…let’s  say:  ‘In  20  years  you’ve  grown  tremendously 
from  the  loss  of  your  loved  one.  You’ve  lived  this 

All  the  ACT  flexibility  processes  were  perceived  as  core 
to  bereavement  support.  The  mindfulness  processes  – 
present  moment  awareness,  acceptance,  defusion,  and 
self-as-context – were all regarded as contributing to the 
generation  of  psychological  space.  On  the  other  hand, 
practitioners  viewed  values  clarity  as  generating  the 
motivation to take action which is meaningful to the cli-
ent (committed action).

I feel they’re all core. I feel pretty strongly that they’re so 

interrelated. (Hanna)

Practitioners  did  not  use  a  protocol  for  bereavement 
support. They assessed their clients’ most pressing needs 
and  addressed  those  first.  However,  even  if  they  began 

Willi et al. BMC Palliative Care           (2024) 23:59  
Page 9 of 13

with  a  focus  on  a  specific  process,  they  often  felt  they 
used the others throughout their sessions.

And  is  any  of  that  interrupting  their  grieving  pro-
cess? (Trisha)

And  then,  of  course,  with  any  given  client  where 
I  start  is  not  where  I  end,  right?  We  kind  of  dance 
around the [flexibility processes], depending on their 
needs  and  their  progress.  So  I  don’t  have  a  set,  you 
know, protocol. (Ophelia)

I’d usually do a lot of psychoeducation with kids on 
bereavement […] once they’ve got that level of infor-
mation,  then  it’s  quite  easy  to  do  things  like  [the 
ACT exercise] “choice points”. (Alba)

Delivering ACT with sensitivity

Practitioners  reported  ACT  should  be  communicated 
with  sensitivity.  According  to  practitioners,  for  clients, 
the  notion  of  accepting  and  defusing  from  emotions, 
thoughts, and memories that pertain to their loved one, 
while  reconnecting  with  value-directed  action  without 
their loved one, could be viewed as dismissive of the sig-
nificance of the deceased.

Helping  you  reconnect  with  your  values  and  help-
ing  you  distance  yourself  from  certain  thoughts 
when they’re not helpful, now that can come across 
the  wrong  way,  I  think,  if  you  do  it  clumsily  or  too 
directly. The wrong way, I mean, I guess, dismissive. 
(Pierre)

To avoid these processes being understood as an encour-
agement  to  move  on,  let  go,  or  disregard  internal  expe-
riences  that  concern  their  loved  one,  practitioners 
spent  time  and  care  introducing  ACT  components  and 
exercises.

There  is  a  lot  of  explaining  about  the  language. 
Sometimes  when  people  hear  the  word  ‘acceptance’ 
it’s  like  a  red  flag  to  a  bull.  Because  they’re  in  so 
much pain. […] So, I find I have to do a lot of prep 
work with people, in the beginning, to say […] it’s not 
about just a be-quiet-and-get-over-it type thing. It’s 
something much more involved than that. (Alba)

Adapting ACT according to individual differences

Practitioners adapted ACT according to their clients’ age. 
Practitioners  reported  that  children  and  young  people 
often  had  an  incomplete  and/or  inaccurate  understand-
ing of grief. Consequently, practitioners adapted ACT to 
include  more  psychoeducation  to  facilitate  acceptance 
and value-based work.

When  I’m  working  with  younger  people,  it’s  trying 
to figure out how many pieces of the puzzle do they 
have;  what  they  have  been  told  by  adults  around 
them;  and  what  meaning  do  they  make  from  that? 

To  facilitate  children  and  young  people’s  understanding 
of grief and increase the efficacy of therapy, practitioners 
used more interactive strategies rather than conversation 
with abstract models and language.

Value-based work – particularly with a deck of val-
ues  cards  –  is  great  for  kids.  They’re  usually  really 
good  at,  kind  of,  picking  out  what’s  key  to  them 
[;…]  they  are  quite  used  to  conversations  about  the 
future,  usually  in  terms  of  subjects  or  studying  or 
jobs. (Alba)

Alba, Hanna, and Samantha viewed older clients as hav-
ing  greater  difficulty  staying  in  contact  with,  accepting, 
and expressing distressing internal experiences. All three 
practitioners  said  this  was  due  to  generational  cultural 
values that discourage the expression of emotion.

Accepting  internal  experiences  can  be  very,  very 
challenging  for  people  who  have  been  raised  with 
rigid expectations about emotional expression. And 
I  find  that  that  can  be  more  true  of  older  adults. 
(Hanna)

To  facilitate  contact  with  distressing  internal  experi-
ences, practitioners took greater care in explaining ACT 
and adapted their approaches. To bring older clients into 
the  present,  Alba  used  mindfulness  exercises  that  were 
directed  at  experiences  of  external  rather  than  inter-
nal  phenomena  (e.g.  an  object  in  the  room).  To  encour-
age  contact  with  internal  experiences,  Hanna  modelled 
noticing and expressing her own experiences. Samantha 
would also spend more time facilitating the mindfulness 
processes with older clients.

The stereotypes in older adult services around men-
tal health and psychiatric care are very, very strong. 
And that can mean that you have to do a lot more 
work on the defusion side of things. There’s just more 
to  unpick  there.  And  similarly,  things  like  mindful-
ness, kids are quite, sort of, familiar with it now […] 
quite open minded in terms of trying different things. 
Whereas you can try anything with an older adult, 
but it usually just takes a bit more selling […] a bit 
more, kind of, explanation in practice. (Alba)

Willi et al. BMC Palliative Care           (2024) 23:59  
Practitioners  adapted  ACT  metaphors  and  language  to 
ensure these were understood and effective with clients, 
taking  into  account  individual  differences  in  education 
and cognitive ability.

I try to be really thoughtful about ‘does this interven-
tion  that  I’m  offering  land?’  […]  I  certainly  adapt 
for cognitive ability […] if I’m going to be building a 
metaphor with someone who had limited education, 
I’m really going to be mindful that it is not my meta-
phor, it is their metaphor […] so they’re building the 
metaphor in a way that makes sense to them. (Oph-
elia)

Other interventions can be complementary

Practitioners  typically  offered  bereavement  support  to 
clients  without  explicitly  mentioning  ACT.  Nonethe-
less,  most  practitioners  drew  on  ACT  as  their  primary 
approach  to  bereavement  support.  However,  they  men-
tioned  at  least  eight  other  interventions  they  some-
times  used  alongside  it,  including  cognitive  behavioural 
therapy, narrative therapy, schema therapy, compassion-
focused  therapy,  dialectical  behaviour  therapy,  behav-
ioural  activation  therapy,  art  therapy,  and  exposure 
therapy.  Practitioners  stated  that,  since  ACT  focuses  on 
general  psychological  flexibility,  other  interventions  can 
often be complementary.

I  think  ACT  is  so  flexible  that  it  can  adapt  to  take 
on other models. But I think the way I adapt, in that 
respect,  is  always  through  that  filter  of  ‘We’re  not 
trying to get rid of [symptoms]; we’re always aiming 
for psychological flexibility’. (Samantha)

When the bereavement was traumatic, several practitio-
ners  used  trauma-focused  interventions  in  conjunction 
with ACT. Trauma was usually related to violent or dis-
tressing  end-of-life  experiences.  Techniques  that  were 
adapted  from  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD) 
treatments  often  used  variations  of  imaginal  exposure: 
whereby the client recalls traumatic memories surround-
ing the death in detail.

I  do  exposure  therapy  […]  I  ask  [clients]  to  tell  me 
what happened in a specific way: to retell  the story 
of a loss in a way that means that they can be open 
to  experience  difficult  thoughts;  in  a  way  that  they 
can recognise the feelings that come and try to make 
sense  of  it.  So  that’s  not  an  ACT  technique,  but  I 
think it fits quite well with it. (Pierre)

Discussion
Our  findings  suggest  that  practitioners  use  ACT  to:  (i) 
improve  clients’  relationship  with  grief  through  accep-
tance  and  the  creation  of  psychological  space  around 
distressing  internal  experiences;  (ii)  support  clients  to 
reconnect with their values after loss and draw on them 
to  engage  in  value-directed  action;  (iii)  provide  flex-
ible  support  that  is  sensitive  to  the  significance  of  the 
deceased, the characteristics of the bereaved person, and 
their bereavement support needs.

Practitioners emphasised the value of ACT for manag-
ing  overwhelming  emotion  and  intrusive  thoughts  and 
feelings, alongside the importance of acceptance and val-
ues clarification as part of the therapeutic process. These 
findings  align  with  Walker’s  doctoral  research  [32]  that 
found  that  ACT  was  perceived  as  helpful  in  addressing 
undesirable  thoughts  and  feelings,  while  helping  people 
adapt  to  life  without  the  deceased  by  identifying  a  new 
purpose  and  place  in  society.  In  both  studies,  practitio-
ners were open to tailoring ACT based on the individual 
needs  of  the  client,  including  adapting  metaphors  and 
integrating ACT with other therapeutic approaches.

Our findings that practitioners viewed acceptance and 
mindfulness  techniques  as  improving  clients’  ability  to 
cope  with  difficult  thoughts  and  feelings  resonates  with 
the results of a feasibility trial of an ACT self-help book-
let for bereavement support [31]. In that study, bereaved 
clients  reported  that  booklet  sections  on  experiential 
avoidance  and  mindfulness  were  particularly  helpful. 
Together, these findings highlight the perceived value of 
ACT acceptance and mindfulness techniques to support 
the bereaved person to cope following loss.

In our study, practitioners viewed avoidance strategies 
as detrimental in their own right: they were exhausting, 
took up psychological space, and interfered with the nat-
ural  healing  process. This  is  consistent  with  studies  that 
show  avoidance  is  positively  associated  with  bereave-
ment-related  distress  in  university  students  [40]  and 
prolonged grief disorder [41–45]. ACT tools for tackling 
avoidance may have multiple benefits with regards to the 
intensity and duration of bereavement-related distress.

According  to  practitioners  in  this  study,  clarifying 
values  and  committing  to  value-directed  action  in  the 
midst  of  grieving  can  improve  client  coping  and  well-
being.  This  is  consistent  with  two  studies  that  found 
that  value-directed  action  is  negatively  associated  with 
bereavement-related  distress  in  university  students  [40, 
43].  Moreover,  prolonged  grief  disorder  is  associated 
with  avoidance  of  recreational,  social,  and  occupational 
activities  (known  as  depressive  avoidance;  46–48).  Prac-
titioners in this study reported clarifying values and com-
mitting  to  value-directed  action  can  address  a  loss  of 
purpose,  meaning,  and  identity  following  bereavement, 
and  provide  the  energy  and  purpose  to  move  forward. 

Willi et al. BMC Palliative Care           (2024) 23:59 ACT  may  facilitate  renewed  engagement  with  activities 
that  are  important  to  the  person,  supporting  the  resto-
ration-oriented  coping  described  by  the  Dual  Process 
Model [27] and mitigating some of the disruption associ-
ated with grieving.

Practitioners  considered  all  ACT  processes  as  core  to 
bereavement  support.  This  is  consistent  with  a  recent 
meta-analysis  of  mediational  studies  that  found  that  the 
combined  flexibility  processes  account  for  therapeutic 
effects  of  ACT  [49].  Furthermore,  in  our  study,  practi-
tioners  reported  that  both  the  mindfulness  processes, 
and  the  values  clarity  and  committed  action  processes 
contributed  to  improvements  in  coping  and  well-being 
independently. This result is similar to that of a study that 
found  various  combinations  of  the  flexibility  processes 
led to improvements in people experiencing clinical lev-
els  of  psychological  distress,  but  the  greatest  improve-
ments  were  achieved  when  all  process  where  combined 
[50]. Further investigations into the benefits of prioritis-
ing the flexibility processes according to individual differ-
ences are merited.

Practitioners  were  careful  to  avoid  acceptance,  defu-
sion,  and  values  work  being  perceived  as  dismissive  of 
the significance of a client’s loved one. Given the double-
edged meaning of words like ‘acceptance’, such language 
could become a barrier to accessing interventions. More-
over, practitioners adapted ACT metaphors and language 
according to individual differences and when introducing 
mindfulness processes to older adults, as the latter were 
thought  to  have  more  difficulty  staying  in  contact  with, 
accepting,  and  expressing  distressing  internal  experi-
ences.  Overall,  to  maximise  engagement  with  ACT, 
practitioners  reported  sensitivity  is  needed  when  select-
ing the language and techniques used to deliver ACT for 
bereavement support.

In  this  study,  practitioners  found  it  beneficial  to  use 
other therapeutic interventions alongside ACT at times. 
This openness to combining therapeutic approaches was 
also  reported  in  Walker’s  doctoral  research  [32].  In  our 
study,  other  interventions  were  often  chosen  because 
they targeted a specific issue. For example, for traumatic 
bereavement,  practitioners  sometimes  used  imaginal 
exposure  techniques  based  on  PTSD  treatments  (e.g. 
51).  Trauma  psychoeducation  and  imaginal  exposure 
can  reduce  distress  when  confronted  with  traumatic 
memories  [52]  and  thereby  also  facilitate  ACT’s  focus 
on  openness  to  experiencing  (accepting)  distress.  Psy-
choeducation  was  also  used  alongside  ACT,  especially 
when supporting  children and young people. A primary 
function  of  psychoeducation  is  to  create  a  vocabulary 
for  discussing  thoughts  and  feelings  relating  to  grief 
and loss [53]. This can be a helpful first step in recognis-
ing  the  distressing  grief  responses  that  ACT  techniques 
address. These findings suggest ACT-based bereavement

support may benefit from the inclusion of psychoeduca-
tion  and  targeted  interventions  from  other  therapeutic 
approaches.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is one of few studies on the use of 
ACT for bereavement support [31, 32, 54]. Its rich analy-
sis  of  practitioners’  perspectives  added  novel  insights 
into  an  array  of  ACT  therapeutic  practices  and  adapta-
tions  and  how  they  may  lead  to  improvements  in  cop-
ing  and  well-being.  However,  some  limitations  should 
be considered: (i) we relied on a convenience sample for 
pragmatic  reasons  and  our  inclusion  criteria  were  fairly 
open,  rendering  it  difficult  to  accurately  judge  the  level 
of  ACT  expertise  amongst  participants;  (ii)  due  to  time 
constraints,  interview  transcripts  were  not  returned  to 
practitioners for review (however, both practitioners who 
provided  feedback  on  the  final  draft  article  were  posi-
tive and did not request amendments); (iii) practitioners’ 
opinions  on  the  utility  of  ACT  practices  and  outcomes 
may  differ  from  those  of  clients  [55];  (iv)  practitioners 
used  other  therapies  in  conjunction  with  ACT,  there-
fore,  perceived  improvements  in  their  clients  may  have 
been due to other factors; (iv) practitioners in this study 
were all Western, white, and working in the UK or USA – 
results may not be transferable to other cultural, ethnic, 
or health and social care contexts [56].

Implications for bereavement support

First,  clinical  and  research  work  may  benefit  from 
retaining  flexible  protocols  as  practitioners  found  all 
ACT  practices  are  useful  but  best  tailored  to  individual 
needs.  Second,  protocols  may  need  to  be  adapted  to  (a) 
ensure  that  techniques  that  foster  acceptance,  defusion, 
and  values  are  not  seen  as  dismissive  of  the  individual’s 
loved  one  and  (b)  accommodate  potential  developmen-
tal, age-related, and cohort effects around language com-
prehension, recognition of grief-related experiences, and 
openness to emotional expression and mindfulness.

Future directions for research

Future  research  should  explore  whether  practitioners’ 
perspectives on the benefit of ACT for bereavement sup-
port  are  consistent  with  clients’  perspectives.  Whether 
they  extend  to  practitioners  and  clients  from  diverse 
cultural,  ethnic,  and  national  backgrounds  should  also 
be  examined.  Studies  are  also  needed  to  investigate  the 
effectiveness of ACT for bereavement support as a tech-
nique  in  its  own  right  and  used  alongside  other  psy-
into 
chological 
adaptations  to  ACT  language  and  techniques  to  accom-
modate  bereavement-related  sensitivity  and  individual 
differences  across  a  range  ages,  cohorts,  and  cognitive 
abilities are also warranted.

Practitioners  reported  ACT  is  used  to  improve  coping 
and  well-being  for  bereaved  people  by  supporting  them 
to  create  psychological  space  around  distressing  inter-
nal  experiences  and  use  that  space  to  engage  in  value-
directed action. While all ACT processes were considered 
core  to  bereavement  support,  practitioners  stated  they 
should  be  tailored  to  individual  needs.  Practitioners 
claimed  ACT  language  and  techniques  should  be  used 
with  sensitivity,  adapting  them  to  cognitive  ability  and 
age-related  and  cohort  effects,  while  ensuring  defusion, 
acceptance, and values work are not perceived as dismis-
sive  of  the  significance  of  the  deceased.  Finally,  practi-
tioners  reported  ACT  for  bereavement  support  may  be 
enhanced by other therapeutic approaches. Practitioners 
viewed  ACT  as  an  effective  bereavement  support  inter-
vention;  further  research  and  intervention  development 
is recommended.
