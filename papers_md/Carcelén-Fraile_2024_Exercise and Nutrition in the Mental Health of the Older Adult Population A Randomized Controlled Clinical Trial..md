Abstract: (1) Background: Global population aging is changing demographic structures and presents
significant challenges for health systems, which must adapt to an increasingly elderly population.
(2) Methods: The study employed a randomized controlled trial design with a total of 116 older
adults aged 65 or older, randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 57) undergoing a combined
resistance program and Mediterranean diet program and a control group (n = 59) who did not receive
any intervention. Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS), sleep quality through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and perceived
stress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). (3) Results: Statistically significant improvements
(p < 0.05) were observed both within and between groups in anxiety (Cohen’s d = 0.38 and 0.78,
respectively), depression (Cohen’s d = 0.56 and 0.18, respectively), perceived stress (Cohen’s d = 0.15
and 0.39, respectively), and in the PSQI domains: subjective sleep quality (Cohen’s d = 1.01 and 0.53,
respectively), sleep duration (Cohen’s d = 0.112 and 0.53, respectively), sleep disturbances (Cohen’s
d = 1.92 and 0.95, respectively), use of medications (Cohen’s d = 0.34 and 0.40, respectively), and the
PSQI total score (Cohen’s d = 0.68 and 0.49, respectively). No significant differences were observed
in sleep latency or daytime dysfunction. (4) Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest
that resistance intervention may be an effective therapeutic option to improve mental health and
sleep quality in older adults aged 65 or older, offering a non-pharmacological approach to improving
overall well-being in this demographic.

Demographic change and the consequent aging of the population worldwide are
highly relevant phenomena that are transforming the population structure throughout the
world [1]. In recent decades, we have witnessed a significant increase in the proportion
of people over 65 years of age in relation to the total population [2]. In Spain, population
aging is a phenomenon that has been increasing in recent decades. According to data
from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), in 2020, approximately 20.5% of the Spanish
population was 65 years old or older, and this percentage is expected to continue increasing

in the coming years [3]. This demographic phenomenon is due to a combination of factors,
including declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy, driven by medical advances
and improvements in living conditions [4]. The current demographic transition presents
significant challenges for health systems in adapting to an aging and diverse population.
Specialized care services are needed to address the specific needs of older adults, including
home, long-term, and mental health care [5]. Improving coordination and integration of
health services is crucial to ensuring continued quality care for this demographic. In ad-
dition, it is important to implement prevention and health promotion strategies with a
focus on social determinants specifically aimed at older adults to promote their general
well-being [6]. The aging process has a series of significant implications in terms of mental
health, burden of disease, and health services [7]. First, aging has been found to be associ-
ated with an increased risk of mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, as well
as a higher prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and
other dementias [8]. This represents a significant challenge for health systems, requiring
increased attention and resources to address these conditions effectively [9]. According to
data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that approximately
15% of individuals aged 60 or older have some type of mental disorder. Among these
disorders, depression and anxiety stand out as the most prevalent in this demographic [10].
Specifically, it is estimated that around 7% of people over 65 years of age suffer from
depression worldwide, this being one of the main mental health concerns for this age
group [11]. Regarding anxiety, studies indicate that between 10% and 20% of older adults
experience some type of anxiety disorder [12]. Furthermore, sleep disorders are common
in this population segment, with approximately half of older adults affected, which leads
to difficulties falling or staying asleep [13]. On the other hand, perceived stress, generated
by concerns related to health, economic situation, social isolation, and other factors, can
also affect the mental health of older adults. Although specific numbers are more difficult
to determine due to their subjective nature, perceived stress is recognized as an additional
concern in this demographic. In this context, the search for effective and comprehensive
interventions becomes crucial to improving the quality of life of this vulnerable population;
therefore, the role of nutrition in the aging process, especially in the context of older adults,
becomes vitally important [14]. During the aging process, the body experiences a series of
changes, such as decreased muscle mass, decreased bone density, and reduced immune
system function [15]. These changes can increase susceptibility to various diseases and
health conditions, making a proper diet even more crucial [16]. The relationship between
diet and mental health is the object of study in scientific research, revealing a significant
connection between food intake and psychological well-being [17]. The essential nutrients
present in a balanced diet play a crucial role in regulating brain and central nervous system
function [18]. For example, omega-3 fatty acids, abundant in foods such as fish, nuts, and
seeds, have been shown to positively influence mental health while reducing the risk of
mood disorders such as depression and anxiety [19].

On the contrary, an unhealthy diet, characterized by high consumption of refined
sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods, has been associated with an increased risk
of mood disorders and mental health problems. These foods can induce fluctuations in
blood glucose levels and systemic inflammation, both factors that affect brain function and
mood. Additionally, unhealthy dietary patterns have been correlated with an increased
risk of obesity and chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [20],
which, in turn, are related to an increase in mental health disorders such as mood and
mental health problems such as depression [21].

The Mediterranean diet has emerged as an especially beneficial dietary option for
older adults. Based on the traditional dietary patterns of Mediterranean regions, this diet is
characterized by a high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, fish, and olive oil,
along with a moderate intake of dairy, poultry, and eggs, and a low consumption of red
meat and processed products. This diet not only provides essential nutrients for health but
also promotes a healthy lifestyle in general, encouraging regular physical activity and the

enjoyment of meals in company [22]. This is particularly relevant for older adults, as it can
contribute to improving their physical, emotional, and social well-being and maintaining a
good quality of life as they age [23].

For its part, physical exercise is essential to promoting good health at all ages. On a
mental level, it highlights the improvement in mood, the reduction of stress and anxiety, as
well as the improvement in the quality of sleep [24]. Additionally, exercise prevents chronic
diseases and has long-term effects on physical and mental well-being [25]. Currently, a
variety of exercises are being performed with diverse objectives. Resistance training (RT)
stands out as a form of strength training exercise that focuses on gradually increasing
the load on muscles to develop strength. In this type of training, muscles are required to
exert force against an external load, and it can be safe and effective for older adults [26].
Additionally, several studies have supported the benefits of resistance training for the
physical and mental health of older people [27–29]. Scientific research has shown that the
regular practice of resistance training can significantly contribute to the prevention and
management of common chronic diseases in this population, such as cardiovascular disease
and type 2 diabetes [30], because it has the potential to improve sensitivity to insulin and
improve glucose oxidation [31]. Additionally, resistance training has been found to help
improve body composition by reducing body fat and increasing lean muscle mass, which
may have positive effects on metabolism and overall physical function [32]. On the other
hand, resistance training has been associated with significant improvements in the quality
of life and psychological well-being of older people [33]. Studies have found that regular
participation in resistance training programs can reduce symptoms of depression and
anxiety, as well as improve self-esteem and perceptions of emotional well-being in older
adults [34–36]. Furthermore, it has been observed that resistance training can promote
autonomy and functional independence in activities of daily living, contributing to a greater
sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in life for older people [37].

This research aims to shed light on the effectiveness of resistance programs and the
Mediterranean diet in managing anxiety, depression, sleep, and stress in this specific
demographic group.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design

A randomized, controlled study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-
week combined resistance and diet program on anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and
stress in older adults aged 65 or older. The study was registered prior to its initiation in
“ClinicalTrials.gov” with the reference approval regis NCT06426589 and received approval
from the Ethics Committee of the Mid-Atlantic University (CEI/02-12).

2.2. Participants

At the beginning of the study, a total of 117 older adults aged 65 or older were
contacted, of whom 118 were eligible to participate and, therefore, were integrated into the
study (Figure 1). The search for participants was carried out from October to November
of 2023 through the use of telephone calls and emails. Those interested in taking part in
the study signed an informed consent form in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
the Standards of Good Clinical Practice, and all relevant regulations and laws. This form
detailed the objectives, procedures, possible risks and benefits, and the confidentiality of the
information collected. Older adults aged 65 or older who had the following pre-requisites:
(i) were 65 years of age or older; (ii) had not been part of any resistance program in the last 12
months; and (iii) could understand and follow the instructions, activities, and protocols of
the exercise program. Participants were excluded if they had the following: (i) they suffered
from any systemic condition (e.g., neurodegenerative, musculoskeletal, or visual diseases)
that prevented them from performing the exercises; (ii) they had any vestibular disease
or disorder; (iii) they consumed medications that influenced the central nervous system,
balance, or coordination (for example, antidepressants, vestibular sedatives, or anxiolytics).

2.3. Randomization

The allocation of participants was carried out by using a computer-generated series
of random numbers, equally distributing subjects between the experimental group (EG)
and the control group (CG) in a 1:1 ratio. The distribution of groups remained confidential,
unknown to both the participants, the researchers, and the physical therapist in charge of
implementing the intervention. For this purpose, opaque envelopes were used, sealed, and
numbered in order, which were stored under lock and key and could only be opened by
someone outside the study. Once this process was completed, 55 subjects were assigned to
the experimental group and 55 to the control group.

2.4. Intervention
Resistance Training

Subjects assigned to the experimental group participated in a resistance program twice
a week (on Tuesdays and Thursdays) for a period of 12 weeks, totaling 24 sessions of 60 min
each. Each session during this time was divided into three clearly differentiated parts:
(i) A 5-min warm-up comprised of a series of gentle, low-intensity exercises designed to
gradually prepare the muscles and joints of older adults for the main exercise. This portion
included flexibility and stretching movements, as well as joint mobility exercises; (ii) 50 min
dedicated to the main section of the intervention; and (iii) 5 min for relaxation techniques
that incorporate flexibility exercises and stretching. In the main section, various resistance
movements were performed: leg extension and leg curl machine, barbell bench press,
lateral pulldown, barbell curl, overhead press, and triceps extension machine. Resistance
movements were performed in three sets with 10 repetitions and an intensity of 75% of one
repetition maximum (1 RM). Rest intervals between sets and between movements were 2
and 3 min, respectively.

Each session was led by a qualified and experienced professional. There were no
incidents of injuries or negative effects reported during the duration of the intervention.
To be considered in the final analysis, participants had to attend at least 80% of the stip-
ulated sessions. Members of the control group maintained their daily activities, received
guidance to encourage physical activity, and were prevented from engaging in any type of
formal training program. Throughout the 12 weeks of intervention, they were followed up
regularly by telephone to inquire about their physical activity habits.

Mediterranean Diet.

In addition to the resistance intervention, the experimental
group received a Mediterranean diet protocol based on the study by Ismail et al. [38]
with the following meal plan: (i) carbohydrates constituted 50% of daily intake; (ii) fats
represented 35%; and (iii) proteins accounted for 15%. Considering this plan, weekly
consumption recommendations were: (i) the use of 320 mL of extra virgin olive oil was
recommended; (ii) an intake of 30 g of cereals or bread was advised; (iii) the combination
of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables should be 125 mL; (iv) consuming 100 g of eggs
daily was suggested; (v) legumes and nuts should be consumed in quantities of 175 mL
and 30 g, respectively; (vi) red meat was limited to a weekly portion of 75 g; (vii) a daily
consumption of 75 g of fish and poultry was indicated; and (viii) low-fat dairy products
were recommended, equivalent to 250 mL of milk, 50 g of cheese, and 175 g of yogurt.
Additionally, reducing intake of certain products, such as processed meats, cream, butter,
sugary drinks, cookies, bread, and other refined cereals, was encouraged. To ensure
compliance with the diet, each participant had a food diary to record their daily intake. The
14-item MEDAS questionnaire measured adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Additionally,
based on participants’ dietary preferences, intolerances, or allergies, individual adjustments
were made within the framework of the Mediterranean diet to ensure compliance without
compromising basic dietary principles.

The members of the control group continued their daily activities unchanged, receiving
guidance to promote physical activity while limiting their participation in any type of
organized training program, and they were advised to maintain their usual dietary habits.
Throughout the 12-week intervention, regular follow-ups were conducted via phone calls
to inquire about their physical activity habits.

2.5. Outcomes

All data were collected at the beginning and at the end of the intervention period.
Sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, occupational status, marital status,
and educational level were recorded before assignment in the presence of experienced
interviewers.

2.5.1. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet

This was measured using the 14-item MEDAS questionnaire, developed by the PRED-
IMED researchers. The questionnaire consists of 12 queries regarding how often various
foods are eaten and two additional questions concerning typical eating habits in Spain [39].
Each question could be answered with a score of either zero or one. A score of one was
given for using olive oil as the primary cooking fat, choosing white over red meat, and
consuming at least four tablespoons (one tablespoon = 13.5 g) of olive oil daily (used in
cooking, as a salad dressing, etc.), two or more vegetable servings per day, three or more
fruit servings daily, fewer than one serving per day of red meat or processed meats, less
than one serving of animal fats daily, and under one cup (one cup = 100 mL) of sweetened
or fizzy beverages daily. Points were also awarded for drinking at least seven glasses of
wine per week, eating three or more servings of legumes weekly, three or more servings of
fish, no more than two industrial bakery items per week, three or more servings of nuts,
and at least two servings of sofrito each week (a sauce prepared with tomato, garlic, onion,
or leeks and sautéed in olive oil). The total possible score ranged from 0 to 14, with a total
of 9 or higher signifying sufficient compliance with the Mediterranean diet.

2.5.2. Anxiety and Depression

To evaluate anxiety and depression levels, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) was used [40,41]. This instrument is frequently used in populations of older adults
who are not institutionalized [42] and includes 14 questions, divided equally between
anxiety (even questions) and depression (even questions). Items are scored on a scale of 0
to 3, resulting in a total score range of 0 to 21 for both anxiety and depression, with a higher
number indicating a greater presence of symptoms.

2.5.3. Sleep Quality

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [43,44], a widely recognized tool for the
assessment of sleep quality, was the questionnaire selected for this task. The PSQI includes
19 self-report items and 5 additional items that must be completed by the participant’s bed
partner or roommate (the latter are used only to obtain clinical data). From these items,
a global score is calculated, and the following seven dimensions or areas are evaluated:
sleep quality; time to fall asleep; sleep duration; sleep efficiency; problems during sleep;
consumption of sleep medication; and daytime functioning problems. The total score on
the PSQI ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poor sleep quality.

2.5.4. Perceived Stress

The measurement of perceived stress was carried out using the Perceived Stress Scale
(PSS) [45] in its Spanish version [46], an instrument composed of 14 questions that deter-
mines the degree of stress felt in the last month. This questionnaire uses a response system
based on a five-point scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = occasionally, 3 = frequently, and
4 = very frequently). To calculate the total score on the PSS, the response values for items 4,
5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 are reversed (so that 0 becomes 4, 1 becomes 3, etc.), and then all the
items are added. The score ranges from 0–56, with a higher score on the scale indicating a
higher level of perceived stress.

2.6. Sample Size Calculation

For this study, the sample size calculation was carried out considering a mean differ-
ence of 1.27 units in the expected depression variable based on the results of Noradechanunt
et al. [47]. For the calculation, a significance level of 5% and statistical power of 90% were
established, which resulted in a sample size of 51 participants per group. Additionally, a
dropout percentage of 15% was considered, leaving a sample of 59 participants per group
for a total of 118 participants.

2.7. Statistical Analysis

The means and standard deviations were estimated for each of the variables under
study. The difference between groups was analyzed using the Student’s t test for indepen-
dent samples. To evaluate the effects of the intervention, a mixed analysis of variance was
applied, considering the intervention (EG vs. CG) as the between-group factor and the
assessment time (before treatment vs. after treatment) as the within-subject variable. The
dependent variables were anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and sleep quality. Specific
evaluations were carried out for each of the dependent variables. The possible interaction
between the treatment (group) and the evaluation period was investigated. To determine
the effect size between groups, Cohen’s d was used, interpreting values of ≤0.2 as a small
effect, 0.5 as a moderate effect, and 0.8 as a large effect [48]. A p value less than 0.05 was
accepted as statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software,
version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

3. Results

The present study has 36.96% men and 63.04% women. Subjects participated in at
least 91.6% of the sessions scheduled for the intervention, and no incidents of injuries or
negative reactions were reported during the intervention period (Table 1).

3.1. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet

According to our findings, statistically significant differences were found in nutri-
tional status between pre- and post-measurements in the resistance training group: t
(52) = −21.003, p = 0.000, Cohen’s d = 2.18. Moreover, statistically significant differences
were found between both groups in the post-intervention measurement: t (106) = 11.729,
p = 0.000, Cohen’s d = 1.88 (Table 2).

4. Discussion

This randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to analyze the effects of a
resistance intervention combined with a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks on anxiety,
depression, sleep, and stress in institutionalized older adults aged 65 or older. The main
findings of this study demonstrate significant changes pre- and post-treatments, as well
as differences in favor of a resistance program and diet to reduce depression, anxiety, and
perceived stress.

The beneficial effects of resistance exercise and the Mediterranean diet on mental
health and general well-being can be attributed to a series of complex mechanisms of
action involving physiological, neurobiological, and psychological changes [49,50]. First,
resistance exercises and the Mediterranean diet promote stress reduction by regulating the
autonomic nervous system and decreasing levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with
stress [51,52]. Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [53] found that RT
is an effective non-pharmacological strategy to improve mental health outcomes in adults,
regardless of their health status (with or without mental disorders). In addition, it has been
shown that both resistance exercises and the Mediterranean diet have anti-inflammatory
properties, which could positively contribute to mental health by reducing inflammation
associated with mood disorders such as depression [54,55]. However, it is important to

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1741

10 of 15

highlight that most previous studies have addressed these interventions independently,
which highlights the originality of this study in combining both interventions. Numerous
studies have demonstrated the benefits of the Mediterranean diet on the health and well-
being of older adults [56,57]. This diet is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases,
such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline [58]. Furthermore, it
has been observed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is related to a better quality of
life [57], greater longevity, and a lower risk of functional disability in older adults [59].

At a neurobiological level, resistance exercises can influence brain plasticity and
cognitive function by stimulating the release of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), that promote the growth and survival of nerve cells [60].
Additionally, resistance exercise practice has been associated with changes in brain structure
and function, including a reduced volume of the amygdala, a brain region involved in
the stress response [61]. Regarding the Mediterranean diet, its nutritional components
can influence neurotransmission and brain function [62]. For example, omega-3 fatty
acids present in fatty fish can improve communication between brain cells and reduce
inflammation [63]. Similarly, polyphenols present in fruits, vegetables, and olive oil can
protect against oxidative stress and improve cognitive function [64].

Depression in older people is a common and serious mental health condition that can
significantly affect their quality of life and overall well-being. Therefore, it is essential to
carry out strategies that promote its improvement. In a recent systematic review [65], we
evaluated the strength and validity of the available observational and trial evidence on the
association between a variety of dietary patterns and depression, concluding that greater
adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of depression. In
the present study, it has been proven that both resistance exercises and the Mediterranean
diet promote mindfulness and the mind-body connection, which can improve emotional
regulation and resilience to stress. Similarly, the study by Lincoln et al. [66] showed that
participants who had carried out resistance exercise training obtained better scores on the
geriatric depression scale, but unlike our study, they performed it on older people with type
2 diabetes over a period of 16 weeks. On the other hand, a balanced Mediterranean diet
rich in fresh foods can provide essential nutrients that support mental health and general
well-being [67].

The aging process is associated with a reduction in several sleep parameters, including
total sleep time (TST), the duration of deeper sleep stages, and sleep quality [68]. In
the present study, significant differences are revealed in several subdomains evaluated:
subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep discomfort, and medication use; Likewise, in
the total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), significant changes were evident
in the resistance exercises and diet treatment group, which confirms the improvement in
the general quality of sleep of the participants post-intervention. In line with our study, Sa
Souza et al. [69] found significant improvements in different sleep parameters measured
through nocturnal polysomnography after resistance exercises, but in sarcopenic older
adults. Like the study by Corrêa et al. [70], in which they verified the effects of resistance
training on sleep quality, but in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. For their part, the
components inherent in the Mediterranean diet exert a favorable influence on sleep quality
through various physiological and metabolic mechanisms [71]. Firstly, foods such as fish,
dairy products, and nuts present in this diet contain tryptophan, a direct precursor of both
serotonin and melatonin, essential neurotransmitters in the regulation of the circadian
cycle and the induction of sleep [72]. Furthermore, the low intake of caffeine and refined
sugars, characteristic of the Mediterranean diet, minimizes the adverse effects that these
compounds can have on the quality and duration of sleep, thus avoiding difficulties in
falling asleep and nighttime awakenings [73].

The abundant presence of antioxidants in foods such as fruits, vegetables, olive oil,
and nuts contributes to reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, biological processes
associated with the regulation of sleep and wakefulness [74]. Likewise, the low glycemic
index of most Mediterranean foods helps maintain stable blood glucose levels, avoiding

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1741

11 of 15

fluctuations that could interfere with the quality of sleep [75]. Finally, the relationship
between the Mediterranean diet and a healthy body weight, derived from its balanced
nutritional composition, constitutes a protective factor against sleep disorders such as
obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia, conditions whose prevalence can be reduced with an
adequate and balanced diet [76]. However, the need for additional research is highlighted to
fully understand the underlying mechanisms and their applicability in various populations.
One of the highlights of the present study was the rigorous methodological design
used, which was characterized by being a randomized, controlled, and double-blind clinical
trial. Furthermore, a high rate of compliance by participants with the prescribed interven-
tions was evident, and there was a considerable sample size, which increases the robustness
of the findings. First, the effects of resistance training and diet will be evaluated only in the
short term. Secondly, it was carried out only with Spanish-resident adults; for this reason,
the findings cannot be generalized to other populations. The following implications of
the results of this study suggest several important directions for future research: (i) it is
essential to further explore the mechanisms underlying the benefits of resistance exercise
on the mental health of older adults; (ii) the effectiveness of resistance exercises can vary
significantly between different cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Therefore, it is essen-
tial to conduct studies that evaluate how factors such as diet, local customs, and access to
health resources affect the results of resistance exercise programs; (iii) the long-term effects
of resistance exercise also deserve attention. Although this study provides evidence of
short-term benefits, future research should focus on evaluating whether these benefits are
maintained, increase, or decrease over time; (iv) to effectively integrate resistance exercises
into mental health care programs aimed at older adults, it is crucial to train health profes-
sionals in techniques adapted to this population; (v) establishing accessible and culturally
sensitive resilience programs in healthcare settings is another key recommendation taking
into account the physical limitations and cultural preferences of older adults.

5. Conclusions

The study carried out demonstrated that a 12-week resistance program is effective in
improving various psychological and health parameters in older adults aged 65 or older.
Significant improvements were observed in levels of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress,
as well as in several aspects of sleep quality. in the group that participated in the resistance
program compared to the control group. The significant improvements in these parameters
suggest that a resistance program is a valuable intervention to promote mental health and
well-being in this population, offering a viable non-pharmacological therapeutic option.
