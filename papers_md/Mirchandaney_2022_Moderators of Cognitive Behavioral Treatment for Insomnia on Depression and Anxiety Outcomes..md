Abstract
Purpose of Review  With a focus on reviewing adequately powered randomized controlled trials, we present recent research 
on the potential of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to improve depression and anxiety outcomes among 
patients with insomnia and one of the following comorbid psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), general-
ized anxiety disorder (GAD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We also examine potential moderators of CBT-I on 
depression and anxiety outcomes in this population.
Recent Findings  Despite high comorbidity rates, current behavioral and pharmacological treatments for MDD, GAD, and 
PTSD do not substantially target or improve insomnia symptoms; residual insomnia is exceedingly common even among 
patients who experience remission. Insomnia plays a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression and anxiety, 
and treating insomnia with CBT-I may improve global outcomes for patients with MDD, GAD, and PTSD.
Summary  CBT-I is superior to traditional depression/anxiety treatment in improving insomnia symptoms among patients 
with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Results are mixed on whether CBT-I (either alone or augmented with depression/anxiety 
treatment) is effective in improving overall MDD, GAD, and PTSD outcomes. Evening circadian preference and depression/
anxiety symptom severity may moderate the effect of CBT-I on depression and anxiety outcomes.

Introduction

Insomnia is a common clinical condition with severe health 
consequences—prevalence rates range from 10 to 20% of the 
adult population for insomnia disorder, and 35 to 50% for 
insomnia symptoms [1–3]. Insomnia disorder, as defined by 
the DSM-5, is characterized by a dissatisfaction with sleep 
quality or quantity due to difficulty initiating and/or main-
taining sleep, resulting in clinically significant distress or 
impairment in functioning [4]. However, insomnia symp-
toms are listed in the diagnostic criteria for many other psy-
chiatric disorders, and estimates suggest that individuals

with insomnia are five times as likely to present with anxi-
ety or depression compared to individuals without insomnia 
[4, 5].

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the first-line treat-
ment for insomnia, recommended before pharmacotherapy— 
it  is  the  most  widely  used  and  widely  studied  non-drug 
treatment for insomnia [1]. A large body of research has 
supported the efficacy of CBT-I in treating chronic insom-
nia in adults without comorbidities [6]; additionally, recent  
studies have indicated that CBT-I may also effectively treat 
insomnia in children and adolescents, pregnant people, older 
adults, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric and medi-
cal conditions [7–9]. Drawing directly from basic science 
on sleep and circadian rhythms, CBT-I combines multiple 
treatment elements including sleep education, stimulus con-
trol techniques, sleep restriction techniques, and cognitive 
therapy [1].

Given  the  high  comorbidity  rates  of  insomnia  with 
depression and anxiety, and considering the various limita-
tions of current evidence-based treatments for depression

and anxiety, there has been an increase in research on uti-
lizing CBT-I to improve depression and anxiety outcomes 
in comorbid samples. Focusing on reviewing randomized 
controlled  trials,  we  present  the  literature  on  CBT-I  for 
patients with insomnia as well one of the following comor-
bid psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), 
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). Finally, in order to better understand why 
some—but not all—patients experience improvements in 
depression and anxiety symptoms following CBT-I, we high-
light recent research on moderators of treatment outcomes 
among comorbid samples and suggest promising avenues 
for future research.

Major Depressive Disorder

Sleep disturbances are reported among up to 90% of patients 
with major depressive disorder (MDD) [10]. There is evi-
dence  for  a  bidirectional  association  between  insomnia 
and MDD, although prior research has primarily focused 
on insomnia as a risk factor for later depression. Among 
those with and without MDD, sleep disturbance (in par-
ticular, difficulty initiating sleep) is one of the more impor-
tant predictors of a future depressive episode [11, 12••];  
conversely, depressive symptoms increase risk for future 
insomnia [13–15]. The comorbidity between insomnia and 
MDD is associated with poorer outcomes for both conditions 
—symptoms  of  insomnia  are  associated  with  greater  
depressive symptom severity [16], lower rates of remission 
from depression [17], and higher risk of depression relapse 
[11]. Insomnia may also be an independent risk factor for 
suicide, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and non-suicidal 
self-injury among both adults and youth [18–21].

Current  therapies  for  MDD  are  far  from  faultless—
pharmacotherapy  often  brings  side  effects  as  well  as 
withdrawal symptoms when discontinued, psychotherapy 
is frequently inaccessible, and increased attention is being 
paid to the problem of treatment-resistant depression [22]. 
Even with gold-standard antidepressant treatment, a sig-
nificant portion of patients do not experience remission, 
and  many  who  do  experience  remission  subsequently 
relapse—in the STAR*D trial, only 28% of patients expe-
rienced remission after 14 weeks of citalopram, and 70% 
experienced  remission  after  1  year  of  additional  trials 
and treatment augmentations [23]. Furthermore, patients 
with MDD who do experience remission after treatment 
still report at least one residual depressive symptom, with 
sleep disturbance being the most common; a few studies 
even report worsened sleep after antidepressant treatment 
[24]. Among patients with comorbid insomnia and MDD, 
CBT-I has been shown to be effective in treating insomnia 
symptoms and improving sleep [25••, 26]. Taken together, 

the addition of CBT-I to augment depression outcomes 
among patients that suffer from both conditions has been 
researched as an effective behavioral option targeting the 
unique insomnia-depression connection.

There have been few adequately powered randomized 
trials conducted among patients with MDD and insomnia 
which examined the effect of augmenting depression treat-
ment with CBT-I. In the TRIAD study, 150 participants with 
MDD and insomnia were randomized to one of two treatment 
arms—both received depression pharmacotherapy in addition 
to either individual in-person CBT-I or a control therapy for 
insomnia (quasi-desensitization) [27]. While CBT-I reduced 
insomnia severity compared to the control group, there were 
no significant differences in depression outcomes between 
the groups [27]. In a similar RCT, Carney et al. (2017) ran-
domized 107 adult participants with MDD and insomnia  
to  one  of  three  treatment  arms—antidepressant + 4- 
session CBT-I, CBT-I + placebo pill, or antidepressant + sleep  
hygiene control [25••]. Although all three groups improved 
with respect to subjective insomnia measures, only the two 
CBT-I groups improved on objective (polysomnography) 
sleep indices while the antidepressant + sleep hygiene group 
worsened [25••]. Replicating results from the TRIAD study, 
Carney et al. (2017) also found no significant differences in 
depression outcomes between the groups.

While depression treatment augmentation with CBT-I 
does not significantly improve depression outcomes when 
compared to an active control condition in adequately pow-
ered trials among patients with MDD and insomnia, insom-
nia improvement does still appear to be an important predic-
tor of depression outcome. Indeed, in the aforementioned 
TRIAD study, improvements in insomnia early in treatment 
predicted the trajectory of treatment response and served as 
a mediator for depression remission following CBT-I [27, 
28••]. Further analysis of results from the TRIAD study 
revealed, through growth mixture modeling, three trajec-
tories of treatment following CBT-I for comorbid depres-
sion and insomnia—Partial-Responders, Initial-Responders, 
and Optimal-Responders [28••]. Reinforcing the findings 
from Manber et al. [27], participants who had the greatest 
and most rapid reductions in insomnia severity, sleep effort, 
and unhelpful beliefs about sleep after baseline were most 
likely to be characterized as Optimal-Responders (13.5% 
of the sample) with respect to depression remission, and 
were  likely  to  maintain  minimal  depression  even  at  the 
2-year follow-up [27, 28••]. Similar findings have also been 
reported using digital CBT-I (dCBT-I): Henry et al. (2020) 
analyzed results from two large RCTs of dCBT-I (Sleepio) 
among participants with insomnia and clinically significant 
depressive symptoms, finding that improvements in insom-
nia  symptoms  at  mid-intervention  mediated  87%  of  the 
effects on depressive symptoms at post-intervention [29••]. 
Similarly, although Carney et al. (2017) did not investigate 

1 3Current Psychiatry Reports (2022) 24:121–128

123

insomnia improvement as a mediator of depression treatment 
outcomes, they did find that lower post-treatment insomnia 
severity was associated with lower depression severity at 
post-treatment [25••]. Taken together, these findings indi-
cate that improvement in insomnia symptoms is likely a 
critical component of depression symptom reduction.

Few  trials  have  directly  compared  CBT-I  alone  with 
depression treatment among patients with insomnia and 
MDD. By including a CBT-I + placebo pill group, Carney 
et al. (2017) showed that CBT-I with antidepressant phar-
macotherapy was not superior to CBT-I alone in improv-
ing either sleep or depression symptoms; by including an 
antidepressant + sleep hygiene control group, they showed 
that CBT-I led to similar improvements in depression symp-
toms and significantly greater improvements on objective 
sleep  measures,  compared  to  antidepressant  medication 
alone [25••]. Instead of using a pharmacotherapy compara-
tor, Blom et al. [30] assigned 43 participants with comorbid 
insomnia and MDD to internet-delivered CBT for either 
insomnia or depression, finding that both treatments were 
equally effective in reducing depression severity. However, 
CBT-I was more effective in reducing insomnia severity, 
ultimately indicating superiority of CBT-I—these results 
persisted at the 3-year follow-up [30, 31].

Given that insomnia symptoms often predict and predate 
the onset of clinical depression, there has also been increased 
interest in the possibility of CBT-I as a preventative measure 
for individuals with subclinical depression. A large RCT 
by Christensen et al. [32] of a 6-week dCBT-I program 
(SHUTi) compared to an internet-based control program 
(HealthWatch) among 1149 participants with insomnia and 
subclinical depression (a score of between 4 and 20 on the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9,not MDD) found that SHUTi 
significantly reduced depressive symptoms as well as sui-
cidal ideation compared to the control at post-treatment 
[32]. The effect on depressive symptoms—but not the effect 
on suicidal ideation—was sustained at both 6-month and 
18-month follow-ups [33]. While SHUTi improved depres-
sive symptomatology, Christensen et al. [32] did not find a 
significant difference in rates of MDD diagnoses between 
the two groups at follow-up [33]. However, a 2020 trial of 
dCBT-I (Sleepio) in a sample of 1358 adults with minimal 
to no depression resulted in a 50% reduction of depression 
incidence 1 year after treatment, compared to the control 
condition [34••]. Given the early promise of CBT-I as a 
preventor of depression in subclinical adult samples, future 
research should consider CBT-I for preventing depression in 
high-risk samples, such as pregnant people [8], adolescents, 
and older adults.

Ultimately, CBT-I as a treatment for comorbid depression 
and insomnia is promising, and, when compared with CBT 
for depression or antidepressant medications, may be com-
parably effective for depressive symptoms and superior for 

insomnia symptoms. However, it appears that when paired 
with antidepressant medications, CBT-I may not have a sig-
nificant additive effect on treatment outcomes—i.e., there 
may be a “ceiling” effect. However, given that there are only 
two RCTs of antidepressant medication augmentation with 
CBT-I, further research is necessary before drawing conclu-
sions. Additionally, as more and more research focuses on 
preventing, as opposed to treating, mental illness, CBT-I 
stands out as a potential therapy for decreasing the risk of 
future MDD—one that can be easily and effectively dis-
seminated via digital health.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The majority of individuals with anxiety disorders report 
poor sleep, and comorbidity rates with insomnia are esti-
mated to be high, ranging from 45 to 70% [35–37]. Not  
all anxiety disorders are equally comorbid with insomnia 
—those with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder  
(GAD), compared to other anxiety disorders, are 140% more 
likely to also have sleep disturbance [38]. This comorbidity 
is particularly worrisome, as the presence of poor sleep in 
addition to an anxiety disorder is associated with decreased 
health-related quality of life and increased disability [39].

Longitudinal data indicates that anxiety disorders are a 
risk factor for later insomnia, but not necessarily the other 
way around [40]. A potential mechanism underlying the 
anxiety-insomnia association is the role of worry, which is 
a phenomenological feature of GAD and a critical element 
in the cognitive model of insomnia—namely, inappropri-
ate worry about sleep and sleep-related consequences may 
lead to arousal, which perpetuates insomnia [4, 41]. This 
association has been demonstrated using daily process/eco-
logical momentary assessment approaches. In a non-clinical 
sample, worry experienced on a particular day was found to 
predict increased sleep disturbance that night [42]; however, 
in a sample with GAD, there was a bidirectional association 
between worry and sleep disturbance, suggesting a mutu-
ally maintaining relationship between worry and poor sleep 
among individuals with clinically significant anxiety [43].
Given this connection between worry and sleep, treat-
ing insomnia among individuals with GAD may be a fruit-
ful opportunity for overall symptom reduction—however, 
there is currently no adequately powered randomized con-
trolled trial of CBT-I among patients with comorbid GAD 
and insomnia. Belleville et al. [44] compared the efficacy 
of two treatment sequences (CBT-I followed by CBT-GAD 
vs. CBT-GAD followed by CBT-I) in a sample of 10 women 
with comorbid GAD and insomnia [44]. Results indicated 
that participants who first received CBT-GAD had superior 
outcomes on anxiety and sleep—however, most participants 
who were initially treated with CBT-GAD also experienced 

1 3124

additional improvements in both anxiety and sleep follow-
ing CBT-I [44]. Jansson-Fröjmark and Jacobson (2021) con-
ducted an open trial of CBT-I for 24 adults with comorbid 
GAD and insomnia, finding moderate to large effect sizes on 
insomnia and GAD symptoms, as well as depression, func-
tional impairment, and quality of life [45••]. Compared to 
Belleville et al. [44], Jansson-Fröjmark and Jacobson (2021) 
found stronger effects of CBT-I on anxiety symptoms, pos-
sibly due to the emphasis on cognitive components in their 
implementation of the treatment [44, 45••]. Notably, only 
26.1% of the patients reached insomnia remission at follow-
up, a rate much lower than prior studies among patients with 
insomnia only (~ 56%), suggesting that clinically signifi-
cant anxiety symptoms might hinder the efficacy of CBT-I 
[45••]. While there may be some promise in CBT-I as a 
treatment for GAD, neither of the two trials described above 
were adequately powered or included a control condition—
therefore, any conclusions but be considered with caution.

To our knowledge, the two studies with adults described 
above are the only trials of CBT-I specifically for patients 
with comorbid GAD and insomnia. A few open trials have 
assessed  the  efficacy  of  CBT-I  (often  digital  CBT-I)  in 
improving anxiety and insomnia symptoms among ado-
lescents from community samples, with mixed results. In 
the Aslund et al. (2020) open pilot of individual in-person 
CBT-I among 23 adolescents, anxiety symptoms signifi-
cantly  improved  after  treatment,  but  the  post-treatment 
mean anxiety score was above the clinical cutoff [46]. In 
the Cliffe et al. (2020) open trial of digital CBT-I among 
39 adolescents seeking mental health services, there was a 
post-treatment reduction in anxiety symptoms (with 51% of 
the sample having clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety 
at baseline) [47].

Overall, evidence indicates that CBT-I is safe at likely 
effective in improving insomnia symptoms among patients 
with GAD, and there is some indication that improvement in 
anxiety symptoms prior to conducting CBT-I may improve 
outcomes for both insomnia and anxiety. However, any con-
clusions about the efficacy of CBT-I in treating comorbid 
GAD and insomnia must be considered with caution—while 
there is empirical support for the link between anxiety and 
sleep, further research is needed to determine if CBT-I can 
effectively treat both conditions in this population.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Trauma-exposed  populations  report  higher  than  aver-
age rates of disturbed sleep; in a national sample of 2647 
trauma-exposed  adults,  more  than  92%  of  individuals 
who met DSM-5 criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder 
reported at least one sleep disturbance—in fact, sleep distur-
bance is often considered a “hallmark” feature of PTSD [48]. 

While comorbidity estimates of insomnia are high, ranging 
from 39.6 to 81.6%, particular attention must also be paid to 
nightmares, as well as other parasomnias (e.g., sleep paraly-
sis, sleep talking, hypnogogic hallucinations), which are also 
highly prevalent among individuals with PTSD [48, 49]. The 
high comorbidity rates are likely in part due to the fact that 
sleep disturbances—both insomnia and nightmares—are 
included as diagnostic criteria for PTSD [4]. However, mul-
tiple prospective studies have shown that sleep disturbance 
often precedes and predicts subsequent PTSD—data from 
the Millennium Cohort Study indicated that military person-
nel reporting insomnia symptoms or short sleep duration 
(< 6 h) prior to deployment had significantly higher odds of 
developing PTSD after deployment, and these results have 
been replicated among multiple longitudinal cohorts of mili-
tary personnel [50–52].

PTSD treatment may not effectively target sleep-related 
symptoms. A recent RCT of Prolonged Exposure (PE) and 
Present Centered Therapy (PCT) for active-duty US Army 
Soldiers with PTSD found that the majority reported clini-
cally significant insomnia even at post-treatment, and 38% 
still  reported  nightmares  [53••].  While  PTSD  remitters 
improved more than non-remitters on sleep-related symp-
toms, rates of insomnia and nightmares remained signifi-
cantly higher than the general population, replicating prior 
findings and indicating the need for a treatment approach for 
PTSD targeting sleep-specific symptoms [53••, 54].

To our knowledge, there have been only four randomized 
controlled trials of CBT-I for patients with comorbid PTSD 
and insomnia [55–57, 58••]. Talbot et al. [55] randomized 45 
adults with PTSD and insomnia to either in-person CBT-I or 
a waitlist control, finding that CBT-I significantly improved 
both subjective (sleep diary) and objective (polysomnogra-
phy) sleep outcomes, compared to the waitlist control [55]. 
However, Talbot et al. [55] failed to find any significant dif-
ference in non-sleep PTSD symptoms at post-treatment, 
suggesting that improving sleep alone may not necessarily 
improve global PTSD symptoms [55]. Given the role of 
nightmares in PTSD, three out of the four RCTs mentioned 
above assessed combining CBT-I with Imagery Rehearsal 
Therapy (IRT), a treatment which involves rescripting night-
mares to reduce their frequency and intensity [56, 57, 58••]. 
In two separate trials, Margolies et al. [57] and Ulmer et al. 
[56] both randomized combat veterans with comorbid PTSD 
and insomnia to either a combination treatment of CBT-I 
with adjunctive IRT or an inactive control condition [56, 57]. 
In both trials, individuals in the treatment condition showed 
significant improvements in both sleep measures and PTSD 
symptom severity—however, neither trial included a CBT-I 
only condition [56, 57]. In order to disentangle the effects of 
CBT-I and IRT, Harb et al. [58••] randomized 108 veterans 
with PTSD, nightmares, and poor sleep to either CBT-I + IRT 
or  CBT-I  alone,  finding  that  both  groups  experienced 

1 3Current Psychiatry Reports (2022) 24:121–128

125

reductions in nightmare frequency and improved sleep qual-
ity, and CBT-I + IRT was not superior to CBT-I alone [58••]. 
Notably, participants in this sample were not required to meet 
criteria for insomnia, but rather recurrent nightmares, high-
lighting the heterogeneity of PTSD-comorbid sleep problems 
that may be treatable with CBT-I [58••].

Few studies have assessed mediators and moderators of 
CBT-I among samples with comorbid PTSD. Kanady et al. 
[59] focused on the role of fear of sleep, which is a common 
feature of PTSD and appears to be positively associated with 
PTSD symptom severity, possibly fueled by the frequency 
and intensity of nightmares in this population [59]. Using the 
sample described above in Talbot et al. [55]—i.e., 45 adults 
with insomnia and PTSD randomized to either 8 weeks of 
CBT-I or a waitlist control—Kanady et al. [59] found that, 
consistent with prior research, greater fear of sleep at baseline 
was associated with greater global PTSD symptom sever-
ity [59]. At post-treatment, participants assigned to CBT-I 
reported decreased fear of sleep compared to the control, 
and while the authors did not conduct a mediation analysis, a 
reduction in fear of sleep following CBT-I predicted a reduc-
tion in PTSD symptom severity and hypervigilance inten-
sity [59]. Fear of sleep may be a unique mechanism to target 
when treating patients with comorbid insomnia and PTSD.

Overall, CBT-I shows some promise in treating comorbid 
insomnia and PTSD, as well as in treating the heterogene-
ous sleep disturbances associated with PTSD. However, the 
majority of studies have focused primarily on adult veterans 
and military samples—in order to improve the generalizability 
of these results, additional research is needed to assess the 
efficacy of CBT-I in treating comorbid insomnia and PTSD 
in children and adolescents, who have unique sleep needs and 
challenges, as well as adults with varied trauma exposures 
(e.g., sexual assault, unexpected death, interpersonal violence, 
and natural disasters) for whom the connection between sleep 
disturbances and PTSD symptoms may manifest differently.

Recent Research on Moderators of CBT‑I 
Outcomes with Comorbid Depression and/
or Anxiety

Eveningness Circadian Preference and Depression

Out of all factors assessed for moderation of CBT-I out-
comes with comorbid depression or anxiety, evening cir-
cadian preference, defined as the behavioral predilection 
for later sleep and wake timing, has the most robust sup-
port. In Bei et al. [60], a heterogeneous sample of 419 
adult patients with insomnia participated in group CBT-I 
[60]. Participants with stronger eveningness preference, as 
assessed by the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM), 
had higher depressive symptom severity at baseline [60], 

consistent with previous findings that evening circadian 
preference (ECP) is cross-sectionally and longitudinally 
associated  with  MDD  diagnosis,  increased  depression 
severity,  and  nonremission  of  depression  [17,  61,  62]. 
While baseline symptom severity significantly reduced 
from pre- to post-treatment across the whole sample, those 
with  evening  preference  experienced  less  reduction  in 
depressive symptom severity following CBT-I compared 
to those with intermediate or morning preference.

These results are similar for pharmacotherapy treatment 
of insomnia—Rumble et al. [63] examined the association 
between insomnia, chronotype, and suicidal ideation in a 
sample of 108 participants with comorbid depression and 
insomnia being treated with SSRIs and randomized to either 
zolpidem or a placebo control [63]. Regardless of depres-
sion severity, insomnia severity, or treatment assignment, 
eveningness at baseline was independently associated with 
greater suicidal ideation over the course of treatment, estab-
lishing eveningness as a risk factor for suicidality among 
individuals with comorbid depression and insomnia [63].

The TRIAD study, described earlier, randomized 139 
adult participants with comorbid MDD and insomnia dis-
order to either CBT-I or a control therapy—both groups 
also received antidepressant medication [64••]. Although 
eveningness was not associated with depression severity at 
baseline, greater evening preference was associated with 
a  smaller  reduction  in  depression  severity  across  both 
treatment groups [64••]. However, a significant group by 
chronotype interaction was observed such that participants 
with evening preference experienced improved depression 
symptoms when they were treated with CBT-I, suggesting 
that CBT-I may buffer against the risk of poor antidepres-
sant outcome among those with greater evening prefer-
ence [64••]. The findings underscore the importance of 
evaluating circadian preference and suggest that treating 
comorbid depression and insomnia with antidepressant 
medications could be enhanced by augmenting antidepres-
sant medications with CBT-I for those identified as having 
a more evening circadian preference.

Collectively,  it  appears  that  patients  with  ECP  and 
MDD are an important, yet underserved, vulnerable sub-
group to target for sleep interventions in order to reduce 
depression and suicide risk. Although individuals with 
greater eveningness may experience weaker antidepressant 
effects from both antidepressant medications and CBT-I, 
augmenting depression treatment with CBT-I may lead to 
improved outcomes than either treatment alone.

High Depression and Anxiety Severity

Among samples with insomnia and comorbid depression 
or anxiety, there is mixed evidence for symptom severity 
as a moderator of CBT-I outcomes. Henry et al. (2021), 

1 3126

Current Psychiatry Reports (2022) 24:121–128

conducting a sub-analysis of two large randomized con-
trolled trials of CBT-I for patients with comorbid insomnia 
and depression, failed to find any significant moderating 
effect—i.e., CBT-I was equally effective in improving both 
insomnia and depressive symptoms for patients regardless 
of baseline depression symptom severity [29••]. Similarly, 
in a randomized controlled trial, Christensen et al. [32] 
found an online CBT-I program (SHUTi) to have consist-
ent  depression  effects  among  participants  with  few  vs. 
elevated depression symptoms at baseline [32]. The above 
findings, however, are not consistent with results from the 
Sandlund and Norell-Clarke [65] RCT of CBT-I for primary 
care patients with insomnia disorder [65]. In this sample, 
baseline depressive symptoms were a significant predictor 
of remission, while baseline insomnia symptoms were not—
i.e., participants with greater baseline depressive symptom 
severity were less likely to experience insomnia remission 
after treatment [65].

To our knowledge, only one study has assessed depres-
sion or anxiety symptom severity as a moderator of CBT-I 
outcomes among adolescents, with somewhat counterin-
tuitive findings. In an RCT of a sleep intervention (“Sleep 
SENSE,” which included cognitive behavioral and mindful-
ness components) for 123 adolescents with sleep problems 
and elevated anxiety symptoms, adolescents with higher 
baseline anxiety and depression symptoms experienced sig-
nificant improvements in subjective sleep quality compared 
to those with lower internalizing symptoms at baseline [66]. 
This effect could potentially be attributed to the specifici-
ties of the Sleep SENSE intervention, which incorporated 
both sleep- and anxiety-specific modules—in contrast to the 
“manualized” CBT-I used in the adult trials [66]. However, 
it is also possible that “at-risk” adolescents may be more 
motivated or ready for change than those with less severe 
internalizing problems [66]. In determining who is likely 
to respond to CBT-I, further research is certainly needed to 
determine the role of depression and anxiety symptom sever-
ity for both adults and adolescents with comorbid insomnia.

Conclusions

Research on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for 
comorbid depression and anxiety underscores the impor-
tance  of  treating  insomnia  symptoms,  which  are  often 
insufficiently addressed by current depression and anxiety 
treatments despite being frequently comorbid and mecha-
nistically related to the onset and maintenance of these dis-
orders. The evidence suggests that CBT-I may treat both 
insomnia and depression/anxiety symptoms in comorbid 
populations and may even prevent the development of full-
fledged MDD, GAD, or PTSD—however, not all patients 
experience symptom reduction or remission. Future research 

should investigate evening circadian preference and depres-
sion/anxiety  symptom  severity  as  potential  moderators 
of treatment outcomes. Future studies will be necessary 
to determine if CBT-I can also effectively treat comorbid 
depression and anxiety in children and youth populations.
