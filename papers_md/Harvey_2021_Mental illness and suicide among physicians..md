Mental illness and suicide among physicians

Samuel B Harvey, Ronald M Epstein, Nicholas Glozier, Katherine Petrie, Jessica Strudwick, Aimee Gayed, Kimberlie Dean, Max Henderson

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened interest in how physician mental health can be protected and optimised, 
but uncertainty and misinformation remain about some key issues. In this Review, we discuss the current literature, 
which shows that despite what might be inferred during training, physicians are not immune to mental illness, with 
between  a  quarter  and  a  third  reporting  increased  symptoms  of  mental  ill  health.  Physicians,  particularly  female 
physicians, are at an increased risk of suicide. An emerging consensus exists that some aspects of physician training, 
working conditions, and organisational support are unacceptable. Changes in medical training and health systems, 
and the additional strain of working through a pandemic, might have amplified these problems. A new evidence-
informed framework for how individual and organisational interventions can be used in an integrated manner in 
medical schools, in health-care settings, and by professional colleagues is proposed. New initiatives are required at 
each of these levels, with an urgent need for organisational-level interventions, to better protect the mental health 
and wellbeing of physicians.

Introduction
Being  a  physician  has  long  been  considered  one  of  the 
most rewarding and sought-after occupations. However, 
this work also comes with stressors, some unique to the 
medical  profession,  others  typical  of  high-pressure, 
highly  skilled  occupations.  International  attention  on 
mental  ill  health  and  suicide  among  physicians  has 
increased.1  Similar  discussions  have  occurred  within 
other  professions,  including  lawyers,  first  responders, 
construction workers, and teachers, with each profession 
concerned  that  there  might  be  something  inherently 
psychologically toxic about their work that contributes to 
the  high  rates  of  mental  ill  health  that  are  reported 
in  these  industries.2,3  In  the  medical  community,  this 
concern  has  escalated  after  a  number  of  high-profile 
suicide  clusters  among  physicians  and,  over  time,  by 
an  increasing  amount  of  data  highlighting  high  rates 
of  mental  health  symptoms,4,5  suicidal  ideation,6  and 
completed  suicide.7–9  These  reports  have  forced  the 
medical profession to reconsider its own vulnerability. In 
this context, key professional bodies in different countries 
have issued calls to action, demanding a greater focus on 
physician  mental  health  within  training  programmes, 
workplaces, and the health service more broadly.10–12 The 
importance  of  this  issue  goes  beyond  the  desire  of  the 
medical professional  to  look  after their peers. Having a 
healthy, functional workforce of physicians is one of the 
most  important  parts  of  any  country’s  health  system,13 
with  prospective  studies  showing,  for  example,  that 

Search strategy and selection criteria

We identified references for this Review through searches of 
MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. These 
searches were done in 2019, with focused updated searches 
done in 2020. We searched for studies published from 
databases’ inception to Nov 3, 2020. Publications in English 
were identified with various search terms for “mental 
disorder”, “burnout”, “substance misuse”, or “suicide” 
combined with “physicians” or “doctors”.

depressed  physicians  make  six  times  more  medication 
errors  than  healthy  staff,14  with  mental  ill  health  or 
substance  misuse  a  common  cause  for  impairment 
inquiries by medical regulators.

Despite  the  rapid  increase  in  the  prominence  of 
physician mental health as a topic of interest, uncertainty 
and  misinformation  remain  about  some  of  the  most 
basic facts surrounding physician wellbeing, and which 
individual,  organisational,  and  systemic  interventions 
should  be  prioritised,  if  any.  In  this  Review,  we 
summarise the available international evidence, to clarify 
some  of  the  main  facts  surrounding  physician  mental 
health.  We  also  consider  a  range  of  potential  solutions, 
including  the  evidence  base  for  each,  and  offer  recom-
mendations  for  health  services  and  those  in  charge  of 
medical training worldwide.

Definitions
The  term  physician  can  have  different  meanings  in 
different  countries.  Although  many  of  the  following 
issues  apply  to  an  array  of  health-care  occupations,  we 
focus specifically on physicians who are medical doctors. 
We  also  take  a  broad  view  of  mental  health,  to  include 
both the absence of mental disorder as well as a positive 
state of mental wellbeing.

How common are mental health problems 
among physicians?
Physicians can be affected by the full spectrum of mental 
disorders,  as  well  as  a  range  of  issues  that  affect  their 
wellbeing,  such  as  burnout.  Like  in  the  general 
population, the most common mental disorders reported 
among physicians are depression and anxiety. Given that 
depression  is  most  likely  to  emerge  before  30  years  of 
age  and  anxiety  disorders  tend  to  have  an  even  earlier 
age of onset,15 it is unsurprising that most of the studies 
examining  mental  health  disorders  among  physicians 
tend to focus on those in training, or resident physicians. 
In 2015, a landmark systematic review and meta-analysis 
collated  the  results  from  54  separate  cross-sectional 
and  long itudinal  studies  involving  over  17 500  resident 

920

Reviewphysicians  from  18  countries.4  Similar  numbers  of 
physicians  with  depression  symptoms  were  reported 
regardless of the country and specialty being examined, 
with  a  pooled  estimate  of  depression  caseness  (the 
number  of  physicians  scoring  highly  enough  on  a 
measure  of  depression  to  be  considered  as  having 
clinically  significant  depressive  symptoms)  of  28·8% 
(95%  CI  25·3–32·5).4  Fewer  studies  have  examined 
anxiety  disorders  among  physicians,  with  the  small 
number  of  cross-sectional  studies  suggesting  rates  of 
generalised anxiety disorder as high as 24%,16 and rates 
of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  ranging  between 
4% and 16%.17,18

The results of these cross-sectional surveys often lead 
to  statements  that  the  rates  of  mental  disorder  in 
physicians are substantially higher than those in general 
population  surveys.  However,  further  consideration 
should be given into whether general population surveys 
are  the  most  appropriate  comparison  group.  A  meta-
analysis  done  by  Goodwin  and  colleagues19  reported 
strong evidence that occupational studies tend to produce 
higher  estimates  of  depression  and  anxiety  symptoms 
than  general  population  surveys,  regardless  of  which 
occupational  group  is  considered.  The  authors  suggest 
that symptoms might be over-reported when participants 
know  that  they  have  been  recruited  to  a  study  on  the 
basis  that  they  belong  to  a  specific  occupational  group, 
particularly  when  these  same  surveys  focus  on  reports 
of  workplace  stress.  In  this  case,  over-reporting  of 
symptoms  might  reflect  job  dissatisfaction  rather  than 
mental  ill  health  more  generally.  Given  that  occupation 
studies might report inflated estimates of mental health 
symptoms,  a  more  appropriate  comparison  for  surveys 
of  physicians  might  be  pooled  estimates  from  similar 
surveys  of  other  occupational  groups.  A  survey  of 
over  12 000  Australian  physicians  showed  that  27·2% 
(95%  CI  26·4–28·1)  reported  symptoms  of  depression 
and  anxiety  above  a  predefined  cutoff  score  that 
indicated  a  high  likelihood  of  a  minor  psychiatric 
disorder,  using  the  General  Health  Questionnaire  28 
(GHQ-28).20  Goodwin  and  colleagues’  meta-analysis 
reported a pooled prevalence estimate for caseness using 
a  shortened,  equivalent  measure  (GHQ-12)  across  all 
occupational  surveys  at  29·6%  (95%  CI  27·3–31·9).19 
This  finding  implies  that  the  results  of  this  Australian 
survey,  and  most  other  international  surveys  of  phy-
sicians,  might  be  better  described  as  showing  that 
physicians are not immune to the types of mental health 
problems seen in other occupations (figure 1).

Burnout among physicians
Burnout  is  a  concept  that  was  first  described  by 
Freudenberger,21  although  its  measurement  and  conse-
quences  have  been  made  more  widely  known  by 
Maslach.22 Described as primarily a social or organisational 
problem,  not  an  individual  one,23,24  burnout  is  char-
acterised by emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and feelings

of  being  ineffective.22  In  2019,  WHO  further  described 
burnout  in  the  11th  Revision  of  the  International 
Classification of Diseases as a syndrome (not an illness or 
health  condition)  resulting  from  “workplace  stress  that 
has  not  been  successfully  managed”.25  Even  before  this 
recognition  by  WHO,  a  range  of  research  reports  had 
suggested  that  a  large,  and  increasing,  number  of 
physicians might be experiencing burnout.26–30

Symptoms subsumed within the construct of burnout 
are common among physicians and are associated with 
substantial  suffering,  physicians  leaving  the  profession 
or reducing their hours, and moral distress. In terms of 
individual health, burnout symptoms are associated with 
a higher risk of road traffic collisions,31 sickness absence 
for  both  mental  and  cardiovascular  disorders,32  and  all-
cause  mortality.33  At  an  organisational  level,  burnout  is 
associated  with  higher  sickness  absence  rates,  reduced 
productivity,  and  early  retirement.32–36  Several  studies 
have also linked physician burnout with adverse clinical 
events,  unprofessional  behaviour,  and  lower  quality  of 
patient care.37–40

However, the construct of burnout also presents some 
difficulties.  As  a  relatively  newly  defined  phenomenon, 
definitions,  measures,  and  thresholds  are  in  evolution, 
and such imprecision has made rigorously investigating 
burnout among physicians challenging. A 2018 systematic 
review  of  182  studies  of  burnout  in  physicians  done 
across  45  countries  reported  that  studies  used  different 
definitions of burnout, although studies using the more 
common measures (such as the 22-item Maslach Burnout 
Inventory–Human  Services  Survey  criteria)  reported  a 
prevalence  of  25%  to  50%.41  Although  the  effects  of 
relatively mild or infrequent symptoms on the individual 
might  be  debatable,42,43  taken  collectively,  any  changes

in  burnout  throughout  an  organisation  might  be  an 
indicator  of  organisational  culture  and 
important 
wellbeing.

Furthermore, debate continues regarding the association 
between  burnout  and  depression.44  Although  there  is 
symptomatic  and  epidemiological  overlap,  burnout  is 
defined  as  arising  predominantly 
from  workplace 
problems, whereas depression is agnostic to the cause; it 
is possible to be burned out and not depressed, and vice 
versa,  or  both.  Burnout  and  depression  are  related  but 
have distinct symptoms and, as a result, require different 
prevention  and  management  approaches;  for  example, 
antidepressant  medications  are  a  proven  treatment  for 
depression,  but  these  medications  might  not  be  an 
appropriate intervention for burnout. Care must be taken 
to  ascertain  whether  physicians  reporting  burnout 
might have an underlying depressive disorder amenable 
to  evidence-based  treatment  if  appropriately  identified, 
and  whether  physicians’  reports  of  depression  suggest 
occupational  factors  that  contribute  to  distress.  Also, 
overlap might exist between a diagnosis of post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  and  anxiety  disorders  with  health 
professionals’  experiences  of  vicarious  trauma,  moral 
distress, and workplace abuse, but these associations have 
been better described in nurses than in physicians.45

Physician suicide
General and most cause-specific mortality rates are low 
in  physicians  compared  with  the  general  population,46 
presumably  due  to  an  enhanced  version  of  the  healthy 
worker effect, which occurs when observational studies 
underestimate  mortality  rates  in  employed  populations 
compared with the general population because employed 
populations  exclude  individuals  who  are  ill  or  disabled 
and  therefore  unable  to  work.47  Education  and  high 
incomes might also drive lower mortality rates. However, 
suicide  rates  appear  to  be  a  notable  exception,48  with  a 
2019 systematic review and meta-analysis cal culating an 
overall  standardised  mortality  rate  of  1·44  for  suicides 
among  physicians.49  Female  physicians  appear  to  be  at 
particular  risk,  with  a  2020  meta-analysis  reporting 
female physicians had a suicide rate that was significantly 
higher 
the  general  population.50 
Estimates suggest that, in the USA, one doctor dies by 
suicide  per  day.10  Although  physicians  have  similar 
prevalence  rates  of  depression  and  anxiety  to  those 
reported by other occupations, they are at disparate risk 
of suicide. This risk contrasts with the general trend for 
greater  risk  of  suicide  in  lower  skilled  occupational 
groups.51  In  a  Danish  national  register-based  study, 
physicians had a higher risk of suicide than any of the 
55  other  occupations  considered,  and  risk  estimates 
further  increased  after  sociodemographic  factors  were 
taken into account.52

than  women 

in 

Access  to 

lethal  means,  and  the  knowledge  to 
effectively use such means, is one of the most important 
reasons for the increased risk of suicide in physicians.53 

This  hypothesis  is  supported  by  the  observation  of  a 
similarly high suicide rate in other health professionals 
with  such  access,  including  nurses,  dentists,  and 
pharmacists.9 A further factor in explaining suicide rates 
among physicians might be specific barriers that prevent 
timely  access  to  treatment  and  support.  The  small 
number  of  published  studies  have  estimated  rates  of 
help-seeking among physicians with mental disorders to 
be  between  13%  and  36%.54–57  Physicians  with  mental 
health  problems  might  be  more  reluctant  than  non-
physicians  to  seek  help  for  a  variety  of  reasons,58  with 
major barriers including fears regarding confidentiality, 
the  potential  consequences  for  their  career,  medical 
registration,  and  licensure,  as  well  as  insufficient  time 
and  a  belief  that  they  can  manage  any  symptoms  by 
themselves.20,59  Qualitative  studies  of  physicians  who 
have  had  mental  health  problems  have  shown  a  high 
prevalence  of  self-stigma,  often  driven  by  views  that 
doctors  should  be  invincible,  as  well  as  a  fear  of 
discrimination.60  These  factors  act  as  major  barriers  to 
seeking  help  and  recovery,  alongside  considerable 
cultural stigma among the medical profession.60

Notably, there is emerging evidence of a link between 
area of specialty and risk of suicide, with a 2019 review 
suggesting  that  anaesthetists,  psychiatrists,  general 
practitioners,  and  general  surgeons  might  have  higher 
rates of suicide than other specialists.61 If confirmed, it is 
unclear if this finding is due to these specialists having 
higher  rates  of  mental  ill  health,  greater  access  to  high 
lethality  means,  more  barriers  to  seeking  help,  or  a 
combination of these and other factors. For example, the 
apparent  increased  risk  of  suicide  among  anaesthetists 
appears to be related to a combination of higher rates of 
psychological  distress  in  addition  to  access  to  lethal 
means.20

Substance misuse among physicians
Most  research  investigating  alcohol  and  substance 
misuse among physicians has been done through large-
scale self-report surveys. Research suggests that between 
5%  and  20%  of  doctors  across  a  range  of  high-income 
countries  consume  alcohol  problematically  (usually 
determined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Iden tification 
Test  scores  or  related  instruments).  In  a  sample  of 
7209 American physicians, 1100 (15·3%) reported scores 
indicative of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,62 with 
a  similar  prevalence  reported  in  American  surgeons.63 
In  a  national  sample  of  Danish  doctors  (comprising 
specialists,  trainees,  and  general  practitioners),  the 
prevalence  of  hazardous  alcohol  use  was  identified  in 
18·9%  of  respondents.64  This  study  also  reported  that 
of  the  383  physicians  who  reported  risky  substance 
misuse (alcohol or other drugs, or both), 76·9% felt their 
substance  misuse  was  unproblematic.  A  smaller  UK-
based study reported that 22 (20%) of 109 doctors drank 
alcohol  nearly  exceeding,  or  exceeding,  recommended 
levels,65 although only 5% of doctors from another study 

922

Reviewmet the criteria for alcohol dependence.66 These results 
suggest  that,  compared  with  the  general  population, 
physicians  might  consume  alcohol  at  a  similar  rate,  or 
perhaps  at  a  higher  rate.62,67  This  trend  appears  to  have 
been maintained over the past 30 years.68

Self-report data suggest that a substantial proportion of 
physicians  have  experimented  with  illicit  substances 
at  some  point  in  their  lifetime.68  However,  use  in  the 
12-month period before the study was lower than for the 
general population. An exception to this finding is the use 
of  prescription  drugs  (eg,  benzodiazepines  and  minor 
opiates),  which  was  higher  than  general  population 
estimates and often self-prescribed.68–70 This trend appears 
to  remain  consistent  over  time  and  across  different 
countries, with 2012 data from Australian doctors finding 
5%  reported  using  illicit  substances  at  some  point, 
and  6%  reported  using  self-prescribed  drugs  for  the 
treatment of symptoms of depression or anxiety daily.20

Whether an association exists between certain medical 
subspecialties  and  the  use  of  different  substances  is 
often debated, with much anecdotal evidence and some 
older studies focusing on anaesthesiology as a specialty 
perceived  as  being  at  high  risk.71–73  In  the  past  10  years, 
studies have reported a different pattern, with the highest 
prevalence  of  hazardous  alcohol  consumption  among 
dermatologists  and  orthopaedic  surgeons,62  or  internal 
and  emergency  medicine  specialities.64  Contrary  to  this 
finding,  data  from  Australia  suggested  little  difference 
between  doctors  working  in  different  specialty  areas  in 
terms of alcohol use.20

Unfortunately,  it  is  difficult  for  physicians  to  seek 
help  for  alcohol  or  substance  misuse  problems. 
The  lack  of  early  help-seeking  among  physicians  is 
concerning,  given  the  potential  effect  of  substance 
misuse on a physician’s work performance. A survey of 
American  surgeons  and  a  similar  study  of  physicians 
found  that  in  the  3  months  before  the  study,  most 
physicians who reported a medical error also reported 
alcohol abuse or dependence.62,63 Estimates suggest that 
the  effects  of  alcohol  could  account  for  up  to  5%  of 
instances of suboptimal patient care.74

Risk factors for mental ill health and suicide 
among physicians
Although mental ill health appears no more prevalent in 
physicians  than  in  other  occupational  groups,  the  fact 
that it is not lower should be concerning. Many of the risk 
factors  for  poor  mental  health  reflect  psychosocial 
disadvantage,75  which  is  relatively  uncom mon  among 
physicians. One factor often cited when physician mental 
health is discussed is their exposure to human suffering 
and death. Physicians working in conflict zones or in low-
income  and  middle-income  countries  (LMICs)  face 
unique challenges, including threats to their own or their 
family’s safety,76 and that physicians and other health-care 
workers  are  often  at  the  frontline  of  public  health 
responses  to  major  critical  incidents  and  emergencies, 

such  as  natural  disasters,77  terrorism,  or  as  recently  evi-
denced, infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19.78 
Although major events can cause increases in mental ill 
health among physicians, routine exposure to human ill 
health  and  suffering  is  not  always  the  precipitant  of 
mental  ill  health  among  physicians.79  Instead,  more 
typical  psychosocial  workplace  risk  factors,80  such  as 
excessive  or  conflicting  job  demands,  an  imbalance 
of  work  and  family  life,  long  working  hours,  and 
interpersonal  conflict,  are  often  more  important  in 
explaining  much  of  the  variation  in  mental  ill  health 
among  physicians.81,82  Additional  risk  factors  appear 
relevant for junior physicians during training, including 
excessive working hours, study, and examinations.83,84

Although  the  role  of  work-based  risk  factors  can  be 
important, it is essential that the role of protective factors 
in the workplace also be considered. Decades of research 
has shown that the mental health impact of demanding 
jobs can be buffered, to some degree, by high levels of 
control at work, peer-based social support,85,86 and a belief 
that  one’s  efforts  are  adequately  rewarded  through  pay 
and intangibles.87 For many years, most physicians have 
enjoyed  high  levels  of  autonomy,  control  over  their 
working lives, social support from their peer networks, 
as  well  as  public  esteem,  renumeration,  and  social 
status.88 All of these factors probably have provided some 
protection  against  the  negative  effects  of  the  stressful 
aspects of a medical career. However, in many countries 
physicians  face  increasing  bureaucratic  and  admin-
istrative  burden  and  an  erosion  of  many  of  these 
protective factors.

In  addition  to  risk  factors  common  to  all  physicians, 
there might be additional risk factors that operate at certain 
stages  of  a  physician’s  career.  A  review  of  prospective 
studies  identified  particularly  high  rates  of  depression 
and  suicidal  ideation  among  physicians  during  their 
first  postgraduate  internship  year.89  These  findings  are 
consistent  with  a  later  prospective  cohort  study  of 
740 interns from multiple specialties across 13 institutions 
in the USA, finding an increase in depression symptoms 
across the intern year of six times that of physicians further 
along  in  their  career.90  Other  inter national  studies  have 
reported  that  rates  of  depressive  symptoms  and  suicidal 
ideation appear to be consistently higher during training 
and  residency,  before  reducing  among  consultants  and 
more  experienced  physicians.20  Although  to  some  extent 
these differences probably mirror the different prevalence 
rates observed in the general population among different 
age groups, the differences might also reflect the effects of 
unique  stressors  operating  during  physician  training, 
such  as  examination  stress,  financial  pressures,  and  job 
insecurity.

Reviewphysicians  in  the  past  three  decades,  with  one  meta-
analysis suggesting that the prevalence of depression has 
increased  an  average  of  0·5%  per  year.4  Some  of  this 
apparent trend might reflect an underlying cohort effect 
present in the observed rise of mental ill health in young 
people (≤25 years) in the general population. Additionally, 
medical  courses  have  changed  radically 
in  many 
countries,  with  a  widespread  move  to  more  graduate 
medical education.91 Although this shift does not appear 
to  have  brought  about  the  hoped  for  improvements  in 
intern  year 
medical  school  completion  rates  or 
performance,92  more  years  as  a  student  has  resulted  in 
junior  doctors  qualifying  with  more  debt  and  a  higher 
likelihood  of  having  competing  family  responsibilities 
during  early  training,  both  of  which  are  risk  factors  for 
poor mental health.

At the same time that some risk factors appear to have 
increased,  a  number  of  protective  factors  previously 
present  for  physicians  have  been  on  the  decline.93 
Physicians’  sense  of  control  and  autonomy  have  been 
undermined  by 
increased  administrative  burden, 
external roster scheduling, electronic records, and health 
system constraints that have tended to increase year on 
year.94 Furthermore, there has been a shift in physicians’ 
expectations  of  their  career,  with  medical  schools 
producing graduates who tend to be much more focused 
on  achieving  an  acceptable  work–life  balance,  not  just 
because  of  a  more  balanced  gender  mix,  but  because 
society and successive generations have placed a higher 
value on work–life balance.95

The  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  has  raised  further 
concerns  about  physician  mental  health.  Across  the 
world,  physicians  have  been  on  the  front  line  while 
caring  for  patients  infected  with  SARS-CoV-2.  Health 
systems in many countries have been overwhelmed with 
unprecedented pressure on critical care facilities, forcing 
physicians  to  make  decisions  about  the  allocation  of 
scant  resources.96  Early  in  the  pandemic,  there  were 
shortages  of  personnel  protective  equipment,  with  as 
many  as  20%  of  the  workforce  caring  for  those  with 
COVID-19  becoming  infected  themselves,  meaning 
many  physicians  witnessed  their  colleagues  becoming 
seriously  unwell  or  dying  due  to  their  work.97  Over  the 
past  12  months,  there  has  been  a  surge  of  studies 
examining the mental health impact of COVID-19 on the 
health-care  workforce.  These  studies  tend  to  show  an 
increase  in  acute  self-reported  symptoms  of  depression 
and  anxiety,  as  well  as  high  rates  of  insomnia  and 
distress.98  For  example,  a  study  surveying  health-care 
workers  (including  493  physicians)  from  areas  most 
affected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  such  as  China, 
showed  that  225  (46%)  reported  mild-to-severe  depres-
sion  symptoms,  200  (41%)  reported  mild-to-severe 
anxiety symptoms, and 330 (67%) reported mild-to-severe 
post-traumatic  stress  symptoms.99  Long-term  follow-up 
studies of health workers who have worked in previous 
pandemics,  such  as  the  2003  outbreak  of  severe  acute 

respiratory syndrome, suggest that for some individuals 
(potentially  as  many  as  one  in  ten)  these  early  distress 
symptoms will progress to longer lasting mental health 
conditions, such as post traumatic stress disorder.100

The mental health of physicians in LMICs
Most evidence available on physician mental health comes 
from  high-income  countries.4  Physicians  working  in 
LMICs  face  a  range  of  specific  challenges.  The  health 
systems and health policies in LMICs are often less well 
developed  and  have  fewer  resources  than  high-income 
countries. Physicians comprise a smaller proportion of the 
health-care work force in LMICs, with a greater reliance on 
non-specialist,  lower-skilled  health-care  providers.  The 
global  shortage  of  physicians  in  LMICs,  estimated  to  be 
a  deficit  of  2·8  million  physicians  by  2030,101  means  that 
those  physicians  remaining  in  these  systems  often  face 
highly  stressful  working  conditions,  major  resource  and 
infra structure  constraints,  poor  career  and  development 
opportunities,  and  income  disparities,  all  of  which  can 
negatively  affect  mental  health.  If  physicians  in  LMICs 
develop mental health symptoms, they might be less able 
to  access  evidence-based  psychological  treatments  than 
physicians in higher-income countries.102,103

Single studies of small samples have shown substantial 
rates of depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms among 
physicians from a specific LMIC, such as Vietnam,104 North 
India,105  China,106  Bangladesh,107  Turkey,108  Pakistan,109  and 
occupied  Palestinian  territory.110  A  smaller  number  of 
studies of medical residents have also shown that burnout 
can  also  be  an  important  issue  among  physicians  in 
LMICs.111,112 However, to our knowledge, there has been no 
comprehensive analysis published concerning the overall 
burden  of  common  mental  disorders  among  physicians 
across LMICs. Almost all of the studies examining suicide 
among  medical  professionals  have  also  been  done 
primarily in high-income countries, meaning the scale of 
this issue among LMICs is largely unknown.

Potential solutions
Interventions to improve physician mental health
Multiple  medical  professional  bodies  have  called  for  a 
greater  focus  on  physician  mental  health.10–12  Although 
arguing  that  action  is  needed  is  relatively  straight 
forward,  defining  what  actions  the  medical  profession, 
education, and health-care systems should take is more 
difficult.  The  best  evidence  for  how  to  create  more 
mentally healthy workplaces suggests that a coordinated 
range of different initiatives are needed, extending from 
prevention through to recovery and return-to-work, and 
implemented  at  both  the  individual  and  organisational 
level.3,113,114  Although  this  type  of  framework  has  been 
used  effectively  in  other  industries,  such  as  first 
responders, the unique characteristics of the health-care 
system  and  medical  training  mean  that  such  frame-
works will need to be modified for physicians.115,116 Most 
obviously,  many  physicians  do  not  have  a  single  line

Figure 2: A model for how individual and organisational measures could operate to improve physician mental health throughout a physician’s career

manager to whom they report; they might be employed 
by a health service, but report to a professional college for 
their  training  or  accreditation,  while  having  a  separate 
agency  as  their  regulator.  Trainee  physicians  also 
change colleagues, seniors, and work settings frequently, 
and undertake rural or regional placements, challenging 
their  engagement  with  uncoordinated  initiatives.  Given 
this  complexity,  any  systematic  attempt  to  improve  the 
mental  health  of  physicians  will  need  to  consider  how 
this mobile group can be provided with a coherent suite 
of interventions and policies that follow physicians from 
the  start  of  their  medical  career  through  to  retirement, 
across  different  training  and  employing  institutions.  A 
model for how this approach might operate is shown in 
figure  2,  which  highlights  the  three  key  levels  at  which 
interventions focused on physicians’ mental health need 
to  operate:  the  individual  physician,  the  health  system 
and the professional colleges, and the external regulators. 
Although  interventions  aimed  at  individual  physicians 
are discussed in this Review, this approach should not be 
considered  the  most  important.  Quite  the  contrary  is 
true; there is clear evidence that physicians as a group do 
not have a deficit in resilience,117 and that a greater focus 
on organisational measures is urgently needed.118

The individual physician
The foundation for developing physicians who are able to 
develop  healthy  habits  and  self-awareness,  can  ask  for 

help when needed, and use effective coping mechanisms 
at  times  of  stress  needs  to  be  established  in  medical 
schools.  Simply  inserting  mental  health  awareness 
lectures  into  an  already  crowded  medical  student 
curriculum  is  unlikely  to  be  effective  and  might  even 
have adverse consequences, such as creating unnecessary 
anxiety  and  fostering  a  sense  of  vulnerability.  What  is 
more  likely  to  be  effective,  but  is  still  untested,  is  the 
evolution  of  a  medical  student  curriculum  that  allows 
for  progressive  development  of  self-awareness  and 
effective coping skills and that encourages peer support, 
resilience, and optimism, while normalising appropriate 
help-seeking when needed.119,120

There  is  often  a  marked  increase  in  mental  health 
symptoms  in  the  first  few  years  of  a  junior  doctor’s 
working life. This transition period probably represents a 
further opportunity for reinforcing adaptive coping skills. 
A  2019  systematic  review  reported  that  individually-
focused interventions for physicians, including teaching 
cognitive  behavioural  therapy  or  mindfulness-based 
techniques  to  deal  with  stressful  situations  or  early 
symptoms, resulted in a moderate reduction in symptoms 
of depression and anxiety as well as reduced symptoms of 
suicidal  ideation.121  Similar  results  have  also  been  noted 
for  individual-level  interventions  aimed  at  reducing 
physician  burnout.30,122,123  One  of  the  key  challenges  for 
these  interventions  is  how  they  can  be  taken  to  scale. 
One potential solution is the use of eHealth and mobile

Reviewphone  apps,  which  have  been  shown  to  be  an  effective 
and more feasible way (than face-to-face) to deliver these 
types of interventions in other occupational groups.124 To 
our knowledge, there is only one published randomised 
controlled trial of this type of eHealth intervention among 
physicians, which was able to halve the rates of suicidal 
ideation among interns,125 with a trial of a mental health 
app for trainee physicians underway in Australia.

Although encouraging help-seeking among physicians 
is important, it is vital to ensure that good quality services 
and  appropriate  treatment  is  available  when  physicians 
seek  additional  support.  In  some  countries,  specialist 
mental health services have been created for physicians. 
The potential advantage of such services is that additional 
steps can be taken to ensure confidentiality and physicians 
can be reassured that they are working with specialists in 
managing  other  medical  practitioners.126  The  outcome 
data from a specialist service set up for physicians in the 
UK suggest that such services are well liked and used and 
are able to promote successful return to functioning for 
many individuals who use them.127

The health system
Modifications  within  the  health  system  should  aim  to 
minimise  work-based 
factors  and  promote 
risk 
protective  factors.  Although  conceptually  compelling, 
organisational interventions have been under-researched 
among  physicians.  Systematic  reviews  have  supported 
the idea that there have been no published randomised 
controlled  trials  of  organisational  interventions  that 
consider mental disorder as an outcome, and that there 
have  been  only  three  trials  focused  on  organisational 
interventions  for  burnout.30,121  Although  very  limited  in 
number,  these  studies  have  showed  that  interventions 
such as modifications to work processes and shortening 
of  shifts  can  lead  to  an  improvement  in  some  mental 
health outcomes.30 In fact, the result of one meta-analysis 
suggests that the positive effects of such organisational 
interventions  on  burnout  symptoms  are  significantly 
greater  than  a  range  of  individually-focused  inter-
ventions.128  Given  that  burnout  is  conceptualised  as  an 
organisational problem, such findings are not surprising. 
Team  training,  reducing  cognitive  load  resulting  from 
meaningless  administrative  tasks  and  poorly-designed 
electronic  health  records,  and  flexible  scheduling  also 
might  help  to  reduce  burnout.30,129  Using  clinician 
wellbeing and the financial costs associated with burnout 
as  quality  metrics  for  health-care  organisations  might 
draw  attention  to  the  problem  and  promote  change  in 
the  organisation  of  health-care  delivery,  to  promote 
greater  clinician  wellbeing.130–132  A  consensus  study 
report  by  the  US  National  Academy  of  Medicine  has 
provided  guidelines  aimed  at  redesigning  clinical 
systems  to  allow  physicians  to  focus  on  the  human 
aspects of care and to promote physician well being. The 
organisation  recom mend  a  multifaceted  system-based 
approach, including initiatives to reduce administrative 

burden, to optimise use of health-care technologies, and 
to foster a more positive working environment.133

Given  what  is  known  about  the  role  of  risk  and 
protective  factors,  it  is  probable  that  there  are  other 
(currently  untested)  organisational  interventions  that 
could  also  be  effective  in  improving  physician  mental 
health. These interventions include strategies to improve 
physician  autonomy  and  control  in  the  workplace,  job 
security,  leave,  and  other  policies  that  reduce  work–
family conflicts, as well as a range of other initiatives to 
support an appropriate effort–reward balance.80

Professional colleges and external regulators
In  many  countries,  the  professional  medical  colleges 
have  near  absolute  control  of  specialty  training  pro-
grammes  and  the  requirements  of  both  the  individual 
physicians and the health-care systems that train them. 
Therefore,  these  agencies  are  in  a  powerful  position  to 
influence  the  job  design  and  working  conditions  of 
junior physicians as well as to promote, or even mandate, 
some  of  the  individual-focused  and  organisational-
focused  interventions.  Additionally,  training  colleges 
can  also  ensure  that  the  individuals  who  they  place  in 
charge of mentoring and training junior physicians are 
equipped  to  be  able  to  better  support  and  manage  the 
next generation of physicians. In other industry groups, 
training leaders to recognise and respond to junior staff 
in  need  of  assistance  has  been  shown  to  result  in 
sustained  improvements  in  their  own  behaviour,  with 
some  measurable  benefits  reported  among 
those 
individuals who they manage.134,135 Although similar trials 
are  yet  to  occur  among  medical  leaders,  a  number  are 
in  process  (eg,  ACTRN12619001496101)  and  it  is  hoped 
that similar positive results will be observed.

In addition to this role of controlling specialty training 
programmes,  external  regulators  set  the  environment 
in  which  physicians  need  to  operate  when  considering 
seeking  help  for  a  mental  health  condition.  Rules 
regarding  the  mandatory  reporting  of  mental  ill  health 
can  affect  physicians’  willingness  to  seek  help.  In  one 
US  study,  physicians  working  in  a  state  where  medical 
licence applications and renewal forms asked specifically 
about mental illness were 20% less likely to ask for help 
if needed.59 Early intervention for psychiatric symptoms, 
as  well  as  ensuring  that  decisions  about  registration 
and ability to work are focused on functional impacts of 
symptoms  (not  specific  diagnoses  or  treatments),  is 
essential  in  preventing  attrition  from  medical  training 
and premature retirement.

Conclusions and future directions
The mental health and wellbeing of physicians has been 
neglected for too long. There is overwhelming evidence 
that,  despite  what  might  be  inferred  during  traditional 
undergraduate  and  postgraduate  education,  physicians 
are  not  immune  to  mental  illness  and  are,  in  fact,  at 
greater  risk  of  suicide  than  most  other  professional

Reviewgroups. The strain placed on physicians across the world 
during the COVID-19 pandemic has probably worsened 
this  situation.  Action  is  needed  to  better  protect  the 
mental  health  and  wellbeing  of  physicians,  particularly 
those early in their career.

There is an emerging consensus that some aspects of 
physician training, working conditions, and support are 
unacceptable.  Importantly,  there  is  also  a  recognition 
that many of the changes that have occurred in medical 
training and health systems over the past three decades 
have amplified these problems and eroded the protective 
factors  that  previously  offset  the  risks  inherent  in 
physician work. Common issues, such as administrative 
and  bureaucratic  burden,  job  insecurity,  reduced  job 
control, and a shift in the age and priorities of medical 
graduates,  appear  across  the  international  medical 
community  and  probably  help  to  explain  some  of  the 
growing  mental  health  concerns  among  physicians. 
There remains a striking absence of information about 
the  mental  health  of  physicians  working  in  LMICs, 
although  there  are  sound  reasons  to  suggest  these 
physicians might be under great strain.

Urgent action from a range of stakeholders is needed to 
radically rethink the training and employment conditions 
of  physicians.  In  this  Review,  we  have  outlined  how  a 
range of integrated initiatives can be implemented at the 
level  of  the  individual  physician,  health  system,  and 
professional  colleges  and  external  regulators.  New 
initiatives are required at each of these levels, but there is 
a  particularly  urgent  need 
for  organisational-level 
interventions.  Although  evidence  shows  that  individual-
level  interventions  are  important,  there  is  a  risk  that 
interventions  solely  focused  on  the  individual  physician 
might lead to the perception that lower levels of individual 
resilience is the key problem.117 This is not the case. The 
role of training programmes, leadership, and the broader 
health-care  system  must  be  given  prominence,  and 
evidence-based  interventions  focused  on  these  areas 
must be given the greatest priority.
