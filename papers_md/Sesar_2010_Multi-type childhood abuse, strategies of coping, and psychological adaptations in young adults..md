Multi-type Childhood Abuse, 
Strategies of Coping, and 
Psychological Adaptations in 
Young Adults

Aim To retrospectively analyze the rate of multi-type abuse 
in childhood and the effects of childhood abuse and type 
of  coping  strategies  on  the  psychological  adaptation  of 
young adults in a sample form the student population of 
the University of Mostar.

Methods  The  study  was  conducted  on  a  convenience 
sample of 233 students from the University of Mostar (196 
female and 37 male), with a median age of 20 (interquar-
tile range, 2). Exposure to abuse was determined using the 
Child Maltreatment Scales for Adults, which assesses emo-
tional, physical, and sexual abuse, neglect, and witnessing 
family violence. Psychological adaptation was explored by 
the  Trauma  Symptom  Checklist,  which  assesses  anxiety/
depression,  sexual  problems,  trauma  symptoms,  and  so-
matic symptoms. Strategies of coping with stress were ex-
plored by the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations.

Results  Multi-type  abuse  in  childhood  was  experienced 
by 172 participants (74%) and all types of abuse by 11 (5%) 
participants.  Emotional  and  physical  maltreatment  were 
the most frequent types of abuse and mostly occurred to-
gether  with  other  types  of  abuse.  Significant  association 
was  found  between  all  types  of  abuse  (r = 0.436-0.778, 
P < 0.050). Exposure to sexual abuse in childhood and cop-
ing  strategies  were  significant  predictors  of  anxiety/de-
pression  (R2 = 0.3553),  traumatic  symptoms  (R2 = 0.2299), 
somatic  symptoms  (R2 = 0.2173),  and  sexual  problems 
(R2 = 0.1550, P < 0.001).

Conclusion  Exposure  to  multi-type  abuse  in  childhood 
is a traumatic experience with long-term negative effects. 
Problem-oriented  coping  strategies  ensure  a  better  psy-
chosocial adaptation than emotion-oriented strategies.

Sesar et al: Abuse and Psychological Adaptation in Young Adults

407

There is a high degree of overlap between adults’ reports 
of  sexual  abuse,  physical  abuse,  psychological  maltreat-
ment, neglect, and witnessing family violence (1-4). These 
problems  tend  to  occur  together.  Children  who  are  ridi-
culed  or  subjected  to  verbal  attacks  are  also  likely  to  be 
physically punished or harmed, have their physical or emo-
tional needs neglected, and witness violence toward other 
members of the family. Multi-type abuse can be defined as 
the concurrent exposure of a child or adult to more types 
of  maltreatment,  including  sexual  abuse,  physical  abuse, 
psychological (emotional) abuse, neglect, and witnessing 
family violence (5).

Researchers  who  study  the  consequences  of  multi-type 
abuse  believe  that  more  types  of  stress  experienced  by 
children  exposed  to  various  types  of  abuse  and  neglect 
actually  accumulate  and  interact  in  different  ways,  thus 
producing  more  serious  and  less  reversible  consequenc-
es than in cases of single-type abuse (2,6-9). Posttraumat-
ic stress disorder is one of the most common immediate 
consequences of abuse and neglect of children (10). Arata 
et al (11) have found that persons exposed to multi-type 
abuse  were  more  depressed  and  suicidal,  and  expressed 
more  feelings  of  helplessness  than  non-abused  persons. 
Experiencing  physical  and  mental  abuse  in  childhood 
is  associated  with  low  self-esteem  (12,13),  deviant  sexu-
al  behavior,  difficulties  in  coping  with  anger/aggression, 
and psychosocial malfunctioning in adult age (14). When 
they reach adult age, victims of childhood sexual or physi-
cal abuse have more pronounced psychosocial disorders, 
chronic  somatic  symptoms,  respiratory  and  gastrointesti-
nal illnesses, increased risk of developing anxiety and de-
pressive  disorder,  dissociative  and  trauma  symptoms,  as 
well  as  antisocial  and  asocial  behavior  (1,15,16).  Edwards 
et al (17) have found a relationship between the number 
of different types of abuse and the consequences on men-
tal health, ie, the more types of abuse a victim had experi-
enced, the more serious were the consequences.

Although the concept of coping with stress has been vari-
ously defined by different authors, coping can generally be 
conceived  as  a  response  to  a  stressful  situation  with  the 
goal  of  psychosocial  adaptation  (18).  Coping  can  involve 
problem-oriented strategies and emotion-oriented strate-
gies. The former refer to attempts by a person to change 
the stressor, and specific strategies to achieve this are con-
frontation and planned problem-solving. In contrast, emo-
tion-oriented  coping  refers  to  attempts  to  regulate  neg-
ative  emotional  responses  to  a  stressor,  with  self-control 
and distancing as specific strategies (19).

Stressful life events are the most extensively studied envi-
ronmental risk factors for the development of psychopa-
thology in children and adolescents. These events can be 
everyday situations that pose irritating and frustrating de-
mands on the child, events that are expected and desired 
by the child but that never take place, and intense stress-
ful events such as traumas that are horrifying and very dis-
turbing for the child. Stressful life events can precede vari-
ous disorders, increase the risk of their occurrence, as well 
as appear as consequences of such disorders (20).

Research  on  mechanisms  that  play  a  mediating  role  be-
tween  the  stressful  events  and  occurrence  of  symptoms 
has yielded equivocal results. A number of variables such 
as age, sex, type of stressful event, reactions of parents and 
family, and coping strategies should all be taken into ac-
count when trying to answer why some individuals in cer-
tain situations react by developing symptoms of psycho-
pathology, while others do not. Despite the complexity of 
this problem, one thing seems certain: how a child inter-
prets and judges a certain event, and what strategies he or 
she uses to cope with stressful events, plays a decisive role 
in predicting future psychopathology (20).

Research  has  still  not  established  a  reliable  method  for 
differentiating  effective  and  non-effective  coping  strate-
gies. Some studies indicate that emotion-oriented coping 
is associated with emotional and behavioral difficulties in 
children (21,22). At the same time, other researchers have 
failed  to  show  that  problem-oriented  and  active  strate-
gies contribute to the success of psychological adaptation 
(23,24). Indeed, the effectiveness of coping strategies de-
pends on the specifics of the stressful situation. Strategies 
effective for one type of stress are not necessarily effective 
for other types (25).

It  has  been  shown  that  exposure  to  multi-type  abuse  in 
childhood  is  associated  with  more  serious  difficulties  in 
psychological  adaptation  than  exposure  to  single-type 
abuse (10-16). The question remains whether various pro-
tective factors, such as strategies of coping with stress (26-
29), can mediate the psychological adjustment of people 
who were abused in childhood.

The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective study 
on a sample of students of the University of Mostar, Bos-
nia and Herzegovina, in order to explore the rate of multi-
type abuse in childhood and the effects of the type of 
childhood abuse and choice of coping strategy on the 
students’ psychological adaptation.

MethodS

Participants

The study included 233 students from the Faculty of Philos-
ophy at the University of Mostar (196 female and 37 male). 
The median age was 20 years (interquartile range, 2). These 
students were in different years of study and had different 
study  subjects,  including  social  work,  psychology,  and  lin-
guistics. The participants were provided with an information 
sheet that outlined the main principles of the research and 
contained researchers’ contact information. They were giv-
en time to read the information sheet and to ask questions. 
Completion  of  the  questionnaire  was  interpreted  as  con-
sent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of 
Mostar University and by the Ministry of Science, Education, 
and Sports of the Neretva county, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Instruments

The experience of childhood abuse. The exposure to multi-
type abuse in childhood was assessed with the Child Mal-
treatment Scales for Adults (2,30). This questionnaire is in-
tended for retrospective study of childhood abuse among 
adult respondents and it explores 5 types of abuse: emo-
tional (psychological) abuse, physical abuse, neglect, wit-
nessing family violence, and sexual abuse. The scores are 
not  used  for  a  simple  categorization  into  “abused”  and 
“non-abused;” rather, a more nuanced picture is produced 
by asking the respondents to rate the frequency of expo-
sure  to  abuse  on  each  of  the  items  that  describe  poten-
tially  abusive  behaviors  of  parents  and  other  adults. The 
behavior of father, mother, and other persons is rated sepa-
rately, which allows their comparison and reveals whether 
the child was abused by one or more individuals. On the 
scale assessing neglect, respondents are asked only about 
the behaviors of their father and mother. Grading the se-
riousness  of  each  type  of  abuse  is  made  possible  by  the 
items corresponding to that type of abuse (eg, “slapped” to 
“inflicted serious physical injuries”). For each item, respon-
dents grade the frequency of their exposure to such be-
havior (“never,” “sometimes,” or “often;” on the scale of sexual 
abuse, “never,” “once,” “twice,” or “thrice or more”). To explore 
some  of  the  circumstances  and  characteristics  of  sexual 
abuse, a number of questions is given at the end of ques-
tionnaire and these are answered only by those who expe-
rienced some kind of sexual abuse before the age of 14.

different types of abuse and a total result for the entire ques-
tionnaire. Furthermore, it is possible to use the items summa-
tively, ie, to sum up the results for mother, father, and other 
adults for each possible source of behavior and thus create 
a new summative variable. Composite results for emotional, 
physical,  and  sexual  abuse,  neglect,  and  witnessing  family 
violence can also be obtained (2,30). For each scale, higher 
scores indicate more frequent abusive behavior.

We looked at the summative results for father, mother, and 
other adults, as well as composite results, on each of the 
questionnaire scales. The mean value was used as the cut-
off  to  divide  participants  into “abused”  and “non-abused” 
based on the prevalence of different types of abuse (2,30). 
Participants with a summative score on each scale of abuse 
and neglect above the arithmetic mean were classified as 
abused. The percentage of abused participants in the total 
sample was also calculated.

Psychological adjustment. Psychological adjustment in ad-
olescence was assessed by the Trauma Symptom Checklist 
40  (TSC-40)  (31). TSC-40  is  used  to  determine  the  symp-
tomatology  in  adults  who  experienced  trauma  in  either 
childhood or adult age. It measures the aspects of posttrau-
matic stress and other symptoms that occur in traumatized 
individuals. TSC-40 is a 40-item self-reporting instrument. 
In addition to yielding a total score, it has 6 subscales: Anxi-
ety, Depression, Dissociation, Sexual Abuse Trauma Index, 
Sexual Problems, and Sleep Disturbances.

For each item of the scale, respondents are asked to rate 
the frequency of symptom occurrence during the preced-
ing two months using a Likert-type scale from 1 (“never”) 
to 4 (“often”).

Coping strategies. The Coping Inventory for Stressful Situa-
tions (CISS) (32,33) is used to assess stress coping styles. The 
inventory consists of 48 statements grouped in 3 subscales 
(16  statements  each):  Emotion-oriented  Coping,  Task-  or 
Problem-oriented  Coping,  and  Avoidance. This  three-fac-
tor structure was confirmed on a sample of students at the 
University of Zadar, Croatia (34). Respondents are asked to 
rate how much they use different types of activities when 
confronted with a difficult, stressful, or disturbing situation. 
For each statement, respondents answer on a Likert-type 
scale ranging from 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very much”).

culate a summary score on each of 5 scales assessing

ductory psychology, social psychology, and linguistics, one 
of the authors (MB or KS) came to the beginning of the class, 
introduced herself to the students, explained the purpose 
of the study, and encouraged them to participate, pointing 
out that the survey was anonymous. Students were given 30 
minutes to fill out the survey during the class. After complet-
ing the questionnaires, they sealed them in an envelope and 
placed them in a collection box located on a desk in a rear 
corner of classroom, where students would not feel moni-
tored when depositing the envelope.

data analysis

Data are presented as percentages, frequencies, and arith-
metic means with standard deviation. Pearson correlation 
coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between 
variables. Multivariate hierarchical regression analysis was 
used  to  calculate  multiple  correlations  between  predic-
tor  variables  (exposure  to  abuse  and  coping  strategies) 
and criterion variable (psychological adaptation in young 
adults). This analysis allows the calculation of the highest 
possible correlation (R, multiple correlation coefficients) by 
optimizing the combination of predictor and criterion vari-
ables. Multiple determination coefficient (R2) was calculat-
ed to show the percentage of criterion variance explained 
by  a  set  of  predictors.  Statistical  analysis  was  done  using 
Statistica 7.0 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).

ReSultS

On the 3 instruments that we used, we obtained respons-
es  from  233  students.  Factor  analysis  with  varimax  rota-
tion  for  Trauma  Symptom  Checklist  40  (TSC-40)  yielded 
4  factors:  anxiety/depression,  trauma  symptoms,  somatic 
symptoms, and sexual problems. These subscales showed 
an  acceptable  reliability  in  terms  of  internal  consistency: 
anxiety/depression  α = 0.91,  trauma  symptoms  α = 0.84, 
somatic symptoms α = 0.71, and sexual problems α = 0.74. 
The α coefficient for the entire checklist was 0.94. The CISS 
subscales showed an acceptable reliability in terms of in-
ternal  consistency:  problem-oriented  strategies  α = 0.84, 
emotion-oriented strategies α = 0.86, and avoidance strat-
egies α = 0.82. The α coefficient for the entire questionnaire 
was 0.88. For the Child Maltreatment Scales, we used the 
original factor scale and did not analyze factor structure or 
scale reliability ourselves.

Results on the Child Maltreatment Scales showed that 69 
(30%)  participants  were  exposed  to  emotional  abuse  in 
childhood, 57 (24%) to physical abuse, 92 (39%) to neglect, 

92  (39%)  witnessed  family  violence,  and  91  (39%)  were 
sexually abused before the age of 14. Multi-type abuse in 
childhood was reported by 172 (74%) participants, where-
as all types of abuse were reported by 11 (5%) participants. 
Emotional  and  physical  abuse  most  frequently  occurred 
together,  and  they  occurred  in  combination  with  other 
types of maltreatment. Emotional and physical abuse was 
reported by 39 (17%) participants. Thirty (13%) participants 
were not only emotionally and physically abused but also 
neglected,  while  18  (8%)  participants  were  emotionally 
and physically abused, neglected, and witnessed family vi-
olence before the age of 14. Results on the TSC-40 scales 
for  assessment  of  difficulties  in  psychological  adaptation 
showed that participants most frequently had symptoms 
of  anxiety/depression,  somatic  symptoms,  and  trauma 
symptoms. The frequency of sexual problems was the low-
est (Table 1). Results on the CISS revealed that, when con-
fronted  with  a  difficult,  stressful,  or  disturbing  situation, 
participants most frequently used problem-oriented cop-
ing strategies, followed by avoidance strategies, and emo-
tion-oriented strategies (Table 1).

Significant  associations  were  found  between  all  types  of 
abuse (Table 2), which indicates that the participants ex-

posed  to  one  type  of  abuse  were  also  exposed  to  other 
types. The smallest significant correlations were found be-
tween sexual abuse and neglect, and between witnessing 
family violence and neglect, whereas the highest correla-
tion was between sexual and emotional abuse.

We found significant positive correlations between emo-
tion-oriented coping and all investigated indicators of dif-
ficulties  in  psychological  adaptation,  which  means  that 
the participants who used this stress coping strategy more 
frequently  had  problems  in  psychological  adaptation  in 
adult age (Table 3). Small but significant negative associa-
tions were found between problem-oriented coping and 
anxiety/depression, as well as between problem-oriented 
coping  and  sexual  problems.  No  association  was  found 
between avoidance coping strategy and difficulties in psy-
chological adaptation.

To explore the relationship between childhood abuse and 
stress coping strategies, we calculated Pearson correlation 
coefficients  for  each  of  the  abuse  types  and  each  of  the 
coping strategies (Table 4). A significant positive associa-
tion was found between emotion-oriented coping strate-
gies  and  neglect.  A  significant  negative  association  was 
found between avoidance coping strategies and physical 
abuse, as well as between avoidance coping strategies 

and witnessing family violence.

Significant  association  was  found  between  all  types  of 
abuse, including neglect, and anxiety/depression (Table 5). 
Neglect, emotional, and sexual abuse in childhood was as-

adult age. Neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse 
were also associated with trauma symptoms.

To  explore  whether  coping  strategies  and  childhood

in  young  adult  age,  we  performed  a  hierarchical  regres-

tion. Scores on the TSC-40 subscales (anxiety/depression, 
trauma  symptoms,  somatic  symptoms,  sexual  problems) 
were taken as criterion variables. Predictive variables were 
types of abuse and neglect in childhood (emotional, phys-
ical,  and  sexual  abuse,  neglect,  and  witnessing  violence), 
as  well  as  different  coping  strategies  (problem-oriented 
strategies,  emotion-oriented  strategies,  and  avoidance 
strategies).  Sexual  abuse,  problem-oriented  coping  strat-
egies,  and  emotion-oriented  coping  strategies  explained 
36%  of  the  variance  of  criterion  variable  anxiety/depres-
sion (Table 6). For trauma symptoms as the criterion, pre-
dictive variables explained 23% of variance. Sexual abuse 
and emotion-oriented coping were found to be significant 
predictors.  Furthermore,  22%  of  the  variance  of  somatic 
symptoms  was  explained  by  the  investigated  predictors. 
Significance  was  reached  for  sexual  abuse  and  emotion-
oriented  coping.  For  sexual  problems,  16%  of  variance 
was explained by problem-oriented coping strategies and 
emotion-oriented coping strategies (Table 6).

dIScuSSIoN

Our study showed that multi-type abuse in childhood had 
been experienced by 172 participants (74%) and all types 
of abuse by 11 (5%) participants. Emotional and physical 
maltreatment were the most frequent types of abuse and 
mostly occurred together with other types of abuse. Expo-
sure  to  sexual  abuse  in  childhood  and  coping  strategies 
were  significant  predictors  of  difficulties  in  psychological 
adjustment.

The  prevalence  of  multi-type  abuse  in  childhood  in  our 
study is lower than in the study by McGee et al (35), who 
have reported that 90% of participants had been exposed 
to  more  than  one  type  of  abuse  in  childhood.  Other  re-

searchers have found even lower prevalence rates than the 
present study. Higgins and McCabe (1) have reported that 
43% of their participants had been exposed to multi-type 
abuse  in  childhood,  and  Sesar  et  al  (4)  reported  58%  (4). 
The reasons for these differences may partly lie in method-
ological  differences.  Further  possible  explanation  can  be 
found  in  research  on  the  effect  of  traumatic  experiences 
on memory (1). It suggests that self-assessment of abuse 
may result in underestimates of prevalence. A number of 
individuals who were victims of sexual abuse in childhood 
do not recall these experiences and thus answer negative-
ly to the question about the abuse (7). Different criteria for 
classifying  abused  and  non-abused  participants  can  also 
explain  the  differences  in  the  prevalence  rates  between 
our study and previous ones (1,2). In our study, childhood 
maltreatment  experiences  were  assessed  with  frequency 
ratings on a range of items that vary in severity. The most 
important advantage of this approach is that participants’ 
experiences are summed on a continuous scale, allowing 
assessment of the overall degree to which they have ex-
perienced  that  type  of  maltreatment.  These  continuous 
scores can also be used in sophisticated multivariate anal-
yses, as was the case here. However, there are some disad-
vantages of this approach. It does not distinguish between 
frequent  maltreatment  of  a  less  severe  nature  and  infre-
quent maltreatment of a more severe nature. Participants 
with quite different maltreatment experiences may receive 
similar scores. Continuous scores also limit the ability of re-
searchers to distinguish easily between abused and non-
abused participants, or to identify those who experienced 
multi-type maltreatment. One solution to this problem is 
to create a cut-off between high and low scores on the 
Child Maltreatment Scales for Adults. Thus, we used the 
mean score as the cut-off for classifying participants as 
abused or non-abused.

Because  multiple  victimization  appears  to  be  the  norm 
(4,36-38),  we  wanted  to  see  what  kinds  of  victimizations 
tend to occur together. We addressed this question by ex-
amining  how  different  kinds  of  victimizations  were  asso-
ciated with one another. Our findings showed significant 
associations between all types of abuse and neglect. The 
highest levels of association in this study were found be-
tween emotional abuse and other types of abuse. This is in 
accordance with the findings of O’Hagan (39), who points 
out that emotional abuse always accompanies other types 
of abuse and that children suffer emotional damage when 
they are physically punished, neglected, sexually abused, 
or forced to witness family violence.

Few  studies  have  addressed  the  relationship  between 
abuse and choice of coping strategies. They suggest that 
a flexible and rich repertoire of strategies facilitates coping 
with different life challenges and complex traumatic situ-
ations  (25).  Our  results  showed  significant  positive  asso-
ciations between emotion-oriented coping strategies and 
neglect, which is in accordance with the results of Ship-
man  et  al  (40). These  authors  found  that  neglected  chil-
dren used less effective stress-coping strategies than non-
neglected  children.  Furthermore,  we  found  significant 
negative  associations  between  avoidance  coping  strate-
gies  and  witnessing  family  violence,  as  well  as  between 
avoiding coping strategies and physical abuse. Based on 
these  findings,  we  suggest  that  although  avoidance  is 
generally considered ineffective and a maladaptive cop-
ing strategy in the long term, it can also be seen as a use-
ful strategy for coping with physical abuse and witnessing 
family violence. Coping strategies contribute to lowering 
the level of victimization and alleviate the consequences 
of  the  abuse  experience. This  can  affect  whether  or  not 
victimization leads to different forms of psychological dis-
turbances  (41).  Consistent  with  the  findings  of  previous 
research (21,22,42-46), our results showed that problem-
oriented strategies resulted in better psychosocial adap-
tation than strategies of problem avoidance or emotional 
regulation of the situation. Folkman and Lazarus (43) ex-
plain  this  by  the  fact  that  people  feel  better  when  they 
solve  the  stress-causing  problem.  In  addition,  planning 
to  solve  the  problems  can  improve  the  relationship  be-
tween the individuals and their environment, and lead to 
modifications in cognitive judgments and more positive 
emotional  outcomes.  In  this  study,  there  was  no  signifi-
cant  association  between  avoidance  strategies  and  dif-
ficulties  in  psychological  adaptation. This  supports  the 
findings of some authors (43,46,47) that avoidance as a 
coping strategy has a relatively short-term adaptive 

www.cmj.hr

effect and usually does not have positive emotional con-
sequences in the long term.

Our results show that maltreatment in childhood was as-
sociated with trauma symptomatology and self-deprecia-
tion  in  young  adulthood.  Neglect,  emotional  abuse,  and 
sexual abuse were the types of maltreatment most strong-
ly  related  to  trauma  symptomatology  and  self-deprecia-
tion. This supports the findings of some studies (1,4,48-52) 
that emotional abuse is associated with numerous difficul-
ties in psychological adaptation. The present study shows 
that the consequences of neglect are as grave as those of 
other  types  of  abuse.  We  found  an  association  between 
neglect  and  somatic  symptoms,  as  well  as  between  ne-
glect and sexual problems. DePanfilis and Zuravin (53) ar-
gue that child neglect is more likely to be repeated than 
other types of abuse, and therefore its consequences are 
at  least  equal  to  those  of  other  types  of  abuse.  Previous 
research  has  found  an  association  between  neglect  and 
trauma symptoms (54,55), depression (49,56), and anxiety 
(57), but not between neglect and somatic symptoms or 
sexual  problems.  Differences  between  the  results  of  this 
study and previous research can be explained by the fact 
that this study also found some overlaps between differ-
ent types of abuse. It is possible that participants had been 
exposed not exclusively to neglect, but also to other types 
of abuse, the consequences of which were somatic symp-
toms and problems in sexual functioning. Previous studies 
have shown an association between witnessing family vio-
lence and anxiety, as well as between depression and trau-
ma  symptoms  (4,58).  However,  we  did  not  detect  an  as-
sociation between witnessing family violence and trauma 
symptoms in our population. This may be due to the nega-
tive  association  between  witnessing  violence  and  avoid-
ance  coping  strategies.  In  our  sample,  use  of  avoidance 
coping strategies was associated with a lower amount of 
violence witnessed and thus milder consequences on psy-
chological adaptation in adult age.

As expected according to other studies (59-62), the pres-
ent study found that depressive symptoms in young adults 
were the most common consequence of sexual abuse. It 
also  found  anxiety  and  trauma  symptoms  to  be  among 
the long-term consequences of sexual abuse in childhood. 
Based on these findings, one can presume that adult indi-
viduals who were sexually abused in childhood are more 
likely  to  suffer  from  sexual  dysfunction,  ie,  sexual  identi-
ty  problems  and  disorders  in  sexual  functioning.  Indeed, 
several studies support a relationship between sexual dis-
orders  and  sexual  abuse  in  childhood  (15,55,63-68).  Fur-

thermore, our study confirms previous findings (15,69,70) 
about the association between sexual abuse in childhood 
and somatic symptoms in adult age. These results indicate 
that child abuse is a traumatic experience with long-term 
negative  consequences.  Moreover,  the  observed  cumu-
lative  effect  of  experiencing  different  types  of  childhood 
abuse  on  symptomatology  in  adult  age  can  be  greater 
than when the consequences for each type of abuse are 
considered separately (71).

In the current sample, exposure to sexual abuse in child-
hood  was  a  significant  predictor  of  anxiety,  depression, 
trauma symptoms, and somatic symptoms in young adult 
age, which is consistent with findings of previous studies 
(15,60-63,70).  Although  previous  research  (64,66-68)  has 
shown that sexual abuse in childhood can predict the level 
of disorders in sexual identity and functioning, this was not 
confirmed in our study. Consequences of sexual abuse are 
the most studied and controversial aspect of research on 
sexual disorders. Some researchers (72) argue that exposure 
to sexual abuse in childhood has inevitable consequences 
on victims; however, a significant number of children ex-
posed to sexual abuse have no symptoms whatsoever. It 
seems that the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Some 
victims of sexual abuse will have few or no consequences, 
others will experience moderate symptoms, and still oth-
ers will suffer serious consequences (59).

Consistent with findings of some previous studies (73,74), 
we  identified  emotion-oriented  coping  as  a  significant 
predictor of difficulties in psychological adaptation. Prob-
lem-oriented coping was found to be a protective factor 
for anxiety and depression, as well as for sexual problems. 
Previous  research  has  generally  indicated  that  problem-
oriented coping strategies are more useful for well-being 
than  emotion-oriented  strategies  (74).  Although  some 
studies  have  found  that  avoidance  coping  is  associated 
with negative psychological outcomes (74), our study did 
not find this strategy to be a significant predictor of diffi-
culties in psychological adaptation in adult age.

One  limitation  of  this  study  is  that  it  did  not  control  for 
additional  variables  that  can  affect  the  psychological  ad-
aptation of adults who were victims of childhood abuse. 
Previous  studies  point  out  the  importance  of  numerous 
cognitive, developmental, familial, and environmental fac-
tors that can protect from, or otherwise influence, abuse-
related psychological difficulties (75). The effect of coping 
strategies  on  psychological  adaptation  is  very  complex 
and  depends  on  the  type  of  stressor  and  personal  char-

acteristics of the individual (76). Complex theoretical and 
analytical models are therefore needed to fully understand 
the effect of coping strategies on various aspects of physi-
cal and mental health.

Another limitation is that the Child Maltreatment Scales for 
Adults cannot detect whether the various forms of abuse 
occurred concurrently or in different periods of childhood. 
This study is also limited by the fact that abuse and cop-
ing strategies were explored retrospectively. Retrospective 
recall may affect the individual’s perception of events and 
relationships in childhood (2,75). At the time of answering, 
some  participants  may  have  forgotten  or  may  not  think 
about the events that have occurred in the past. This is also 
characteristic  for  repressed  memories  of  traumatic  expe-
riences.  According  to  some  authors  (77),  the  prevalence 
of  maltreatment/abuse  reported  in  retrospective  studies 
on adults is an underestimate. Up to one-third of all inci-
dents of sexual abuse are not retained in memory. A close 
relationship between the abuser and the child at the time 
when the abuse occurred increases the likelihood of not 
remembering  the  abuse  (78).  Indeed,  the  self-reporting 
nature of this study is an important limitation. Some par-
ticipants may have exaggerated negative childhood expe-
riences  due  to  current  psychological  difficulties,  such  as 
depression. Their perception of parents’ behavior may also 
have  been  unrealistic.  Another  limitation  is  the  size  and 
type  of  the  sample. The  study  was  performed  on  a  con-
venience sample of students, and at least one study with 
students  reported  a  lower  prevalence  of  maltreatment 
than  a  study  with  a  clinical  sample  (79).  It  should  be  ex-
amined whether the prevalence of abuse among students 
in  this  study  relates  to  demographic  or  family  issues  not 
covered in our survey instruments. The preponderance of 
women in our sample made it impossible to examine re-
sults by sex. Further studies of this kind should be based 
on the equal number of female and male participants and 
should  include  a  clinical  dimension,  to  examine  whether 
the levels of disorder observed here approximate clinical 
case levels. They should also be performed longitudinally 
to provide deeper insight into factors that protect young 
adults from difficulties in psychological adaptation due to 
multiple types of childhood abuse.
