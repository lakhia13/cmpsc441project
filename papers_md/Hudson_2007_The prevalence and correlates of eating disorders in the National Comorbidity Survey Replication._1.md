The Prevalence and Correlates of Eating Disorders in the National

Comorbidity Survey Replication

James I. Hudson, Eva Hiripi, Harrison G. Pope Jr., and Ronald C. Kessler

Abstract

Background— Little population-based data exist on the prevalence or correlates of eating
disorders.

Methods— Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders from the National Comorbidity
Replication, a nationally representative face-to-face household survey (n _ 9282), conducted in 2001–
2003, were assessed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview.

Results— Lifetime prevalence estimates of DSM-IV anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge
eating disorder are .9%, 1.5%, and 3.5% among women, and .3% .5%, and 2.0% among men. Survival
analysis based on retrospective age-of-onset reports suggests that risk of bulimia nervosa and binge
eating disorder increased with successive birth cohorts. All 3 disorders are significantly comorbid
with many other DSM-IV disorders. Lifetime anorexia nervosa is significantly associated with low
current weight (body-mass index18.5), whereas lifetime binge eating disorder is associated with
current severe obesity (body-mass index < _ 40). Although most respondents with 12-month bulimia
nervosa and binge eating disorder report some role impairment (data unavailable for anorexia nervosa
since no respondents met criteria for 12-month prevalence), only a minority of cases ever sought
treatment.

Conclusions— Eating disorders, although relatively uncommon, represent a public health concern
because they are frequently associated with other psychopathology and role impairment, and are
frequently under-treated.

Keywords

Anorexia nervosa; binge eating disorder; bulimia nervosa; eating disorders; epidemiology; national
comorbidity survey replication (NCS-R)

Two eating disorders—anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa—are recognized as diagnostic
entities in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-
IV) (American Psychiatric Association 1994); a third category, binge eating disorder, is
proposed in DSM-IV as a possible new diagnostic entity. However, data are incomplete on the
prevalence of these 3 disorders in the general population. The prevalence of anorexia nervosa
has been investigated mainly in samples of young women in Europe and North America, where
the average point prevalence has been .3% (Hoek and van Hoeken 2003;Favaro et al 2004).
The lifetime prevalence among adult women has been reported as .5%–.6% in 2 large
population-based surveys in the United States (Walters and Kendler 1995) and Canada
(Garfinkel et al 1996); the latter study found a prevalence of anorexia nervosa among adult
men of .1%. The lifetime prevalence of bulimia nervosa in adult women has been estimated as
1.1%–2.8% in 3 large populationbased surveys in New Zealand (Bushnell et al 1990), the
United States (Kendler et al 1991), and Canada (Garfinkel et al 1995). For men, the lifetime
prevalence of bulimia nervosa was estimated at .1% in the Canadian study and .2% in the New
Zealand study, but the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in a study in Austria was reported
as .5% (Kinzl et al 1999b). For the case of binge eating disorder, 2 population-based telephone
interview surveys of adults in Austria estimated the point prevalence as 3.3% among women
(Kinzl et al 1999a) and .8% among men (Kinzl et al 1999b). Other studies of binge eating

disorder have been limited to specific populations (e.g., young women) or were based only on
questionnaires, rather than personal interviews (Streigel-Moore and Franko 2003;Favaro et al
2004).

Population-based interview data are needed to ascertain the prevalence of the 3 eating disorders
as well as to provide data on age-of-onset distributions, duration, and association with
sociodemographics and body-mass index (BMI). Population data could also address the
question of cohort effects—whether the incidence of eating disorders has changed in recent
decades. Also of interest is the association of eating disorders with other mental disorders, with
measures of disability, and with history of mental health treatment. Finally, population-based
data may be useful in examining alternative definitions of eating disorder syndromes in order
to determine which definitions are most meaningful as markers of psychopathology. To address
these questions, we analyzed data from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R).

Methods and Materials

Sample

The NCS-R is a nationally representative survey of the US household population that was
administered face-to-face to a sample of 9282 English-speaking adults ages 18 and older
between February 2001 and December 2003 (Kessler and Merikangas 2004). The response
rate was 70.9%. The sample was based on a multi-stage clustered area probability design.
Recruitment featured an advance letter and Study Fact Brochure followed by in-person
interviewer visits to obtain informed consent. Consent was verbal rather than written in order
to parallel the consent procedures in the baseline NCS (Kessler et al 1994). Respondents were
given a $50 financial incentive for participation. The Human Subjects Committees of both
Harvard Medical School and the University of Michigan approved these recruitment and
consent procedures.

The survey was administered in 2 parts. Part I included the core diagnostic assessment and was
administered to all respondents. Part II assessed additional disorders and correlates of disorders.
Part II was administered to a subset of 5692 respondents consisting of all those who met lifetime
criteria for a Part I disorder plus a probability sample of other respondents. Disorders of
secondary interest were administered to probability sub-samples of the Part II sample. Eating
disorders were among the latter disorders.

The analyses reported here were carried out in a sub-sample of 2980 Part II respondents who
were randomly assigned to have an assessment of eating disorders. Data records in this
subsample were weighted to adjust for the over-sampling of Part I respondents with a mental
disorder, differential probabilities of selection within households, systematic non-response,
and residual socio-demographic-geographic differences between the sample and the 2000
Census. NCS-R sampling and weighting are discussed in more detail elsewhere (Kessler et al
2004b).

NCS-R diagnoses were based on Version 3.0 of the World Health Organization Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (Kessler and Ustun 2004), a fully structured
layadministered diagnostic interview that generates diagnoses according to both ICD-10 and
DSM-IV criteria. DSM-IV criteria were used in the current report. Core disorders included the
three broad classes of disorder assessed in previous CIDI surveys (anxiety disorders, mood
disorders, and substance disorders) plus a group of disorders that share a common feature of
difficulties with impulse control (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder, attention-deficit/

hyperactivity disorder, retrospectively reported childhood oppositional-defiant disorder, and
conduct disorder). Diagnostic hierarchy rules and organic exclusion rules were used in making
all diagnoses. As detailed elsewhere (Kessler et al 2004a,2005), good concordance was found
between these core CIDI diagnoses and diagnoses based on the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV (SCID) (First et al 2002) in a probability sub-sample of NCS-R respondents who
were administered clinical reappraisal interviews. The area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve was in the range of .65–.81 for anxiety disorders, .75 for major depressive
episode, .62–.88 for substance disorders, and .76 for any anxiety, mood, or substance disorder.
No clinical reappraisal interviews were carried out for the impulse-control disorders, as these
were not core NCS-R disorders.

For the present study, questions from the CIDI were used to assign diagnoses of anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder based on DSM-IV criteria. The full
diagnostic algorithms for all 3 disorders, together with a sensitivity analysis using alternative,
narrower definitions of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, are presented as
supplemental material available online with the electronic version of this article and at
www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs//eating.php; the corresponding CIDI questions used to
operationalize the criteria are available at www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs.

Most of the CIDI questions closely paralleled the DSM-IV criteria, but to meet criteria for
binge eating disorder, DSM-IV requires a minimum of 6 months of regular eating binges,
whereas the CIDI asked only whether the individual experienced 3 months of symptoms. Thus,
individuals displaying more than 3 months, but less than 6 months, of regular binge eating
would be classified as having binge eating disorder in our algorithm, but not in DSM-IV. Also
of note is that for binge eating episodes in bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, DSM-
IV requires assessment of loss of control, and for binge eating disorder requires marked distress
regarding binge eating; these items were assessed in the CIDI by a series of questions about
attitudes and behaviors that are indicators of loss of control and of distress, rather than by direct
questions.

In addition to the 3 eating disorders, we also defined 2 provisional entities. The first was
“subthreshold binge eating disorder,” defined as a) binge eating episodes, b) occurring at least
twice a week for at least 3 months, and c) not occurring solely during the course of anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder. Thus, subthreshold binge eating disorder
did not require DSM-IV criterion B (3 of 5 features associated with binge eating) or C (marked
distress regarding binge eating for binge eating disorder). The second was “any binge eating,”
also defined as a) binge eating episodes (again, not requiring DSM-IV criteria B and C), b)
occurring at least twice a week for at least 3 months, but c) lacking the hierarchical exclusion
criterion if the individual simultaneously exhibited another eating disorder. In other words, any
binge eating was diagnosed regardless of whether or not the individual simultaneously met
criteria for any of the other 3 eating disorders or for subthreshold binge eating disorder. This
entity thus included all cases of bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and subthreshold binge
eating disorder, as well as cases of anorexia nervosa with binge eating. Full diagnostic
algorithms for these 2 provisional entities, together with a sensitivity analysis parallel to that
above, are presented as supplemental material available with the online version of this article
and at www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs//eating.php.

In summary, we examined a total of 5 conditions—2 official DSM-IV disorders (anorexia
nervosa and bulimia nervosa), 1 proposed DSM-IV disorder (binge eating disorder), and 2
provisional entities that partially overlapped with 1 or more of the previous 3 disorders.
Although in the following text we refer to these 5 conditions collectively as “disorders” for
simplicity, the reader should bear in mind that they vary in terms of their level of general
acceptance.

As indicated above, our criteria allowed that individuals could display more than one lifetime
diagnosis of an eating disorder. We used data from the CIDI regarding time of onset and recency
(i.e., the time when the disorder was last present) to apply diagnostic hierarchies, so that bulimia
nervosa, binge eating disorder, and subthreshold binge eating disorder were not diagnosed in
the presence of anorexia nervosa; and so that binge eating disorder and subthreshold binge
eating disorder were not diagnosed in the presence of bulimia nervosa. Because the CIDI
provides information only about onset and recency of a disorder, individuals with an episode
of a given eating disorder occurring only in between two or more discrete episodes of a
hierarchically exclusionary disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa) would not have been diagnosed
with that disorder.

For individuals meeting criteria for any of the 5 five disorders, the CIDI assessed age of onset,
recency, years with the disorder, and professional help-seeking. Respondents with 12-month
prevalence (that is, individuals who met criteria for the eating disorder at any time within the
12 months before interview) were additionally administered the Sheehan Disability Scales
(Leon et al 1997) to assess the severity of recent episodes and were asked about treatment in
the past 12 months.

Statistical Analyses

Cross-tabulations were used to estimate prevalence, disability, and treatment. The actuarial
method (Wolter 1985) was used to estimate age-of-onset curves. Discrete-time survival
analysis with the person-year as the unit of analysis (Willett and Singer 1993) using logistic
regression (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000) was used to estimate cohort effects. Logistic
regression was also used to study socio-demographic correlates and comorbidity. Logits and
their 95% confidence intervals were converted into odd ratios by exponentiation for ease of
interpretation. Standard errors and significance tests were estimated using the Taylor series
linearization method (Wolter 1985) implemented in the SUDAAN software system (Research
Triangle Institute 2002) to adjust for the weighting and clustering of the NCS-R data.
Multivariate significance of predictor sets was evaluated using Wald _ 2 tests based on design-
corrected coefficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance was evaluated
using 2-tailed .05-level tests; it should be noted that this level, which was pre-specified for all
NCS-R analyses, does not correct for multiple comparisons and thus underestimates the overall
type I error rate.

Results Prevalence

Lifetime prevalence estimates of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder,
subthreshold binge eating disorder, and any binge eating were .6%, 1.0%, 2.8%, 1.2%, and
4.5% (Table 1). Lifetime prevalence was consistently 1¾ to 3 times as high among women as
men for the 3 eating disorders (z _ 2.2–2.8, P _ .029–.005), 3 times as high among men as
women for subthreshold binge eating disorder (z _ 3.3, P _ .001), and approximately equal
among women and men for any binge eating (z _ 1.2., P _ .219). No 12-month cases of anorexia
nervosa were found in the sample. The 12-month prevalence estimates of the other 4 disorders
were considerably lower than the lifetime estimates, although with similar sex ratios. Estimates
of cumulative lifetime risk by age 80, based on retrospective age-of-onset reports (Figure 1),
were 0.6% for anorexia nervosa, 1.1% for bulimia nervosa, 3.9% for binge eating disorder,
1.4% for subthreshold binge eating disorder, and 5.7% for any binge eating.

Age of Onset and Persistence

Median age of onset of the five disorders ranged from 18–21 years (Table 2). The period of
onset risk was shorter for anorexia nervosa than for the other disorders, with the earliest cases
of the other disorders beginning about 5 years earlier than those of anorexia nervosa (ages 10

vs. 15), and no cases of anorexia nervosa beginning after the mid-20s—whereas some cases
of the other disorders began at a much older age (Figures 1 and 2).

The mean number of years with anorexia nervosa (1.7 years) was significantly lower than for
either bulimia nervosa (8.3; t _ 4.1, P _ .001), binge eating disorder (8.1; t _ 2.9, P _.006),
subthreshold binge eating disorder (7.2; t _ 2.6, P _ .013), or any binge eating (8.7; t _ 2.9, P
_ .005) (Table 2). Consistent with these differences in duration, 12-month persistence, defined
as 12-month prevalence among lifetime cases, was lowest for anorexia nervosa (.0%) and
higher for bulimia nervosa (30.6%), binge eating disorder (44.2%), subthreshold binge eating
(47.2%), and any binge eating (46.9%).

Cohort Effects

Consistent inverse associations between cohort (age at interview) and lifetime risk were found
in survival analyses of all 5 disorders (Table 3). However, the odds ratios in younger (ages 18–
29, 30–44) versus older (60_) cohorts were significantly higher for all comparisons only for
bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and any binge eating.

Association with Body-Mass Index

Individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of anorexia nervosa displayed a significantly lower current
BMI—with a greater prevalence of a current BMI of _ 18.5, and a lower prevalence of a current
BMI _ 40—than respondents without any eating disorder (Table 4). The reverse pattern was
found for binge eating disorder, with a significantly higher prevalence of BMI of _ 40 among
individuals with binge eating disorder than respondents without any eating disorder. Any binge
eating was also associated with severe obesity, but this finding was attributable entirely to cases
of binge eating disorder.

Twelve-Month Role Impairment

Role impairment was assessed only for 12-month cases; since there were no 12-month cases
of anorexia nervosa, our analysis was limited to the other 4 disorders. The majority of
respondents with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or any binge eating reported at least
some role impairment (mild, moderate, or severe) in at least 1 role domain (53.1%–78.0%),
but only 21.8% of respondents with subthreshold binge eating disorder reported this degree of
impairment (Table 5). Severe role impairment was much less common, and ranged from 3.4%
in subthreshold binge eating to 16.3% in bulimia nervosa, with no significant differences in
prevalence among groups.

Comorbidity

More than half (56.2%) of respondents with anorexia nervosa, 94.5% with bulimia nervosa,
78.9% with binge eating disorder, 63.6% with subthreshold binge eating disorder, and 76.5%
with any binge eating met criteria for at least 1 of the core DSM-IV disorders assessed in the
NCS-R (Table 6). Eating disorders were positively related to almost all of the core DSM-IV
mood, anxiety, impulse-control, and substance use disorders after controlling for age, sex, and
race-ethnicity, with 89% of the odds ratios for the association between individual eating
disorders and individual comorbid conditions greater than 1.0 and 67% significant at the .05
level. The odds ratios were consistently largest, though, for bulimia nervosa, with a median
(and inter-quartile range in parentheses) odds ratio of 4.7 (4.3–7.5), next highest for binge
eating disorder (3.2 [2.6–3.7]) and any binge eating (3.2 [2.4–3.8]), and smaller for anorexia
nervosa (2.1 [1.2–2.9]) and subthreshold binge eating disorder (2.2 [1.1–2.9]). No single class
of disorders stood out as showing consistently or markedly higher comorbidity with eating
disorders.

Treatment

Page 6

A majority of respondents with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder
(50.0%–63.2%) received treatment for emotional problems at some time in their lives, with
the most common site of treatment being the general medical sector for anorexia nervosa
(45.3%) and binge eating disorder (36.3%), and the mental health specialty sector for bulimia
nervosa (48.2% for psychiatrist and 48.3% for other mental health) (Table 7). However, smaller
proportions sought treatment specifically for their bulimia nervosa (43.2%) or binge eating
disorder (43.6%). Only 15.6% of respondents with 12-month bulimia nervosa and 28.5% with
12-month binge eating disorder received treatment for emotional problems in the 12 months
before interview, with the most common site of treatment being the general medical sector,
and similar proportions received 12-month treatment specifically for their bulimia nervosa or
binge eating disorder.

Discussion

In a population-based survey of American households—the first nationally representative
study of eating disorders in the United States—we found estimates of lifetime prevalence for
eating disorders that are broadly consistent with earlier data. However, we found a surprisingly
high proportion of men with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (representing approximately
one-fourth of cases of each of these disorders). By contrast, clinical and case registry studies
(Fairburn and Beglin 1990;Hoek and van Hoeken 2003) report that fewer than 10% men among
cases of these disorders, and population-based studies report a 15% proportion of men for
anorexia nervosa (Garfinkel et al 1996) and 8%–10% of men for bulimia nervosa (Bushnell et
al 1990;Garfinkel et al 1995). Note, however, that estimates from population-based studies,
including ours, are unstable because they involve small numbers of men with eating disorders
(no more than 5 men with either disorder in any study).

Our findings provide unique data regarding the lifetime duration of eating disorders, and the
onset and duration of binge eating disorder, together with extensive information on
sociodemographic features of individuals with all 5 disorders. Also, our study provides support
for the common impression that the incidence of bulimia nervosa has increased significantly
in the second half of the twentieth century (Kendler et al 1991;Hoek and van Hoek 2003), and
it provides the first data showing a similar trend for binge eating disorder. Nevertheless, there
are some data suggesting that the incidence of bulimia nervosa may be leveling off in recent
years (Currin et al 2005). Whether the incidence of anorexia nervosa has increased over time
is unclear and subject to debate. We failed to find a significant increase, but had little power
to detect such a trend; case registry study data have yielded conflicting findings and
interpretations (Fombonne, 1995;Lucas et al 1999;Hoek and van Hoeken 2003;Currin et al
2005).

We found that lifetime anorexia nervosa is associated with a low current BMI, a finding
consistent with follow-up studies of clinical samples of individuals with anorexia nervosa
showing that low weight often persists after resolution of the disorder (Steinhausen 2002). By
contrast, binge eating disorder was found to be strongly associated with current severe obesity
(BMI _ 40)—a finding also consistent with earlier reports (de Zwaan 2001;Streigel-Moore and
Franko 2003;Hudson et al 2006). Although the causal pathways responsible for this latter
association are unclear, shared familial factors (such as shared genes or shared family
environmental exposures) are likely at least partly responsible (Hudson et al 2006).

We also assessed role impairment in all disorders except anorexia nervosa, where analysis was
precluded because no 12-month cases were identified. While the majority of respondents with
bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or any binge eating reported at least some role
impairment in at least 1 role domain, only 21.8% of respondents with subthreshold binge eating
disorder reported any role impairment. Severe role impairment was uncommon in all
conditions. It is important to note, though, that participants may possibly have under-reported
role impairment due to factors such as minimization, shame, secrecy, or lack of insight
stemming from the ego-syntonicity of symptoms.

Less than half of individuals with bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder had ever sought
treatment for their eating disorder (a measure not assessed for anorexia nervosa), although the
majority of individuals with all 3 disorders had received treatment at some point for some
emotional problem. This finding, coupled with the observation that physicians infrequently
assess patients for binge eating (Crow et al 2004) and often fail to recognize bulimia nervosa
and binge eating disorder (Johnson et al 2001), highlights the importance of querying patients
about eating problems even when they do not include such problems among their presenting
complaints.

We found a high prevalence of lifetime comorbid psychiatric disorders in individuals with all
disorders except subthreshold binge eating disorder, although this finding was less pronounced
for anorexia nervosa. These results are again generally consistent with those reported in
previous population-based studies for anorexia nervosa (Garfinkel et al 1996), bulimia nervosa
(Kendler et al 1991;Bushnell et al 1994;Garfinkel et al 1995;Rowe et al 2002), binge eating
behavior (Vollrath et al 1992;Angst 1988;Bulik et al 2002), and regular binge eating without
compensatory behaviors (Reichborn-Kjennerud et al 2004b), as well as in previous studies of
clinical populations for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder (Hudson
et al 1987;Halmi et al 1991;Johnson et al 2001;Godart et al 2002;Kaye et al 2004;McElroy et
al 2005). The cause for the high levels of comorbidity is not known, although there is evidence
that the co-occurrence of eating disorders with mood disorders may be caused in part by
common familial (Mangweth et al 2003) or genetic factors (Walters et al 1992;Wade et al
2000).

Several findings in this study are particularly noteworthy. First, we found that anorexia nervosa
displayed a significantly shorter lifetime duration and lower 12-month persistence, as well as
lower overall levels of comorbidity, than either bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. These
findings contrast with previous studies (Steinhausen 2002) that have conceptualized anorexia
nervosa as a chronic and malignant condition. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that our
population-based method identified individuals with milder cases of anorexia nervosa who
might have been missed in previous follow-up studies, which were based largely on clinical
samples. Alternatively, our population-based method might have missed more severe cases of
anorexia nervosa, either because they were unavailable, unreachable, hospitalized, or unwilling
to participate in an interview about emotional problems. Parenthetically, we would note that
while we found no cases of current anorexia nervosa in our study, 15.6% of the individuals
with a lifetime diagnosis of anorexia nervosa still had a current BMI of less than 18.5 at the
time of interview. Indeed, these individuals (3 cases) were all below 85% of ideal body weight,
thus meeting our operationalization for DSM-IV criterion A for anorexia nervosa. However,
all of these individuals failed to meet at least one of the other criteria for anorexia nervosa
currently—although our data did not permit an analysis of which specific criteria were lacking
in individual cases. Nevertheless, these data suggest that a minority of individuals with past
anorexia nervosa may continue to maintain an abnormally low body weight, even though they
no longer meet full criteria for anorexia nervosa.

Our findings also provide further evidence for the clinical and public health importance of
binge eating disorder. In contrast to some earlier studies suggesting that binge eating disorder
might be a relatively transient condition (Cachelin et al 1999;Fairburn et al 2000), the present
findings, together with those from another recent study (Pope et al, in press), suggest that this
disorder is at least as chronic and stable as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Binge eating
disorder also appears more common than either of the other two eating disorders, exhibits
substantial comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and is strongly associated with severe
obesity. Collectively, these findings suggest that binge eating disorder represents a public
health problem at least equal to that of the other 2 better-established eating disorders, adding
support to the case for elevating binge eating disorder from a provisional entity to an official
diagnosis in DSM-V.

Subthreshold binge eating disorder, by contrast, was found to be associated with such low
impairment and comorbidity that it likely does not merit consideration for inclusion as a DSM
disorder. It should be recalled, in this connection, that the main difference between subthreshold
binge eating disorder and binge eating disorder is that the former lacks the criterion of distress
(see Appendix Table 1 in Supplement 1). These findings suggest that the criterion of distress
may be important for defining clinically meaningful forms of binge eating.

Note that subthreshold binge eating disorder may be defined in different ways. For example,
relaxing the frequency criteria to less than the average of 2 days per week for 6 months required
by DSM-IV identifies groups with characteristics similar to the full disorder (Striegel-Moore
et al 2000;Crow et al 2002). We were unable, however, to evaluate these definitions due the
nature of the CIDI questions, and instead defined subthreshold binge eating disorder by relaxing
criteria other than frequency of binges. Thus, while our definition of subthreshold binge eating
disorder does not appear to identify a clinically meaningful entity, other definitions may well
do so.

Unlike subthreshold binge eating disorder, the entity “any binge eating” is associated with
severe obesity, modest levels of impairment, and high levels of comorbidity with other mental
disorders. These features appear to be accounted for cases of bulimia nervosa or binge eating
disorder within the “any binge eating” group, given that such features are not shared by those
with subthreshold binge eating disorder, and individuals with anorexia nervosa contribute only
a small number of cases. The findings for any binge eating are interesting to consider in the
light of findings from twin studies of binge eating. These studies have suggested that there are
genetic influences on binge eating (Bulik et al 1998) and on binge eating without compensatory
behaviors (Reichborn-Kjennerud et al 2004a). On the basis of our findings here, it is tempting
to speculate that the heritability of binge eating behavior may be attributable primarily to cases
of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder—both of which have been shown to be familial
(Strober et al 2000;Hudson et al 2006)—rather than to cases of subthreshold binge eating
disorder within the group.

Several limitations of the study should be considered. First, some CIDI questions did not
precisely mirror the DSM-IV criteria for the various eating disorders, as illustrated by in the
diagnostic algorithms discussed in our methods section. Perhaps the most important
inconsistency is that, in order to have parallel duration requirements for bulimia nervosa and
for binge eating disorder, we required only 3 months of illness for a diagnosis of binge eating
disorder, in contrast to the 6 months required by DSM-IV. Thus, it is possible that we may
have overestimated the prevalence of binge eating disorder by including some cases with a
duration of only 3 to 5 months.

Second, diagnoses were based on unvalidated, fully structured lay interviews where lifetime
information was assessed retrospectively. These may be important considerations, given that

an earlier version of the CIDI was found to underdiagnose eating disorders (Thornton et al
1998), possibly because some individuals minimized or denied symptoms. Version 3.0 of the
CIDI was designed to reduce this sort of under-reporting by using a number of techniques
developed by survey methodologists to reduce embarrassment and other psychological barriers
to reporting (Kessler and Ustun 2004)—but these changes necessitated indirect assessments
of loss of control and distress, as noted above. In any event, pending validation studies, it would
seem prudent to think of the NCS-R estimates as lower bounds on the true prevalence of eating
disorders.

Third, in our analyses of the associations between eating disorders and body weight, we
possessed only current BMI, rather than maximum or minimum adult BMI, or BMI at the time
of the disorder. Thus, we likely underestimated the magnitude of these associations.

Fourth, because recall of earlier experiences may diminish with age, our retrospective
assessments may have overestimated the magnitude of cohort effects (Giuffra and Risch
1994). Since cohort effects and age effects are confounded, and no prospective studies have
been performed over the period under study, it is not possible to assess the magnitude of this
potential bias. Prospective studies will be useful to track possible cohort effects in the future.

Fifth, our results are based on the assumption that any exiting from the population available
for sampling was non-informative and that there was no selection bias (in the form of non-
response bias) due to sampling from available subjects; these limitations are discussed
elsewhere (Hudson et al 2005). For example, the validity of our results would be threatened if
the development of eating disorders rendered individuals less likely to be available for
sampling, which might occur if there were a high mortality due to eating disorders, or a
significant proportion of cases hospitalized at the time of sampling. Although some clinical
follow-up studies have suggested substantial mortality for anorexia nervosa (Sullivan
1995;Steinhausen 2002;Keel et al 2003), data from a community case registry study (Iacovino
2004) did not find excess mortality.

Another possible threat to validity would be bias in sampling of available individuals, in that
individuals with eating disorders might be more or less likely to participate. However, we
carried out a non-response survey to deal with this problem, which offered a larger financial
incentive ($100) to main survey nonrespondents for a short (15-min) telephone interview that
assessed diagnostic stem questions. Very little evidence was found that survey respondents
and non-respondents differed on stem question endorsement for the NCS-R core anxiety, mood,
impulsecontrol, or substance use disorders (Kessler et al 2004b). Thus, it is likely that non-
response bias for eating disorders was minimal.

Sixth, while we examined 2 provisional entities in addition to those for which criteria were
provided in DSM-IV, we did not examine many other possible entities that lie within the
category of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Fairburn and Bohn, 2005)—such as
subthreshold forms of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, alternative definitions for
subthreshold binge eating disorder (discussed above), purging without either bulimia nervosa
or anorexia nervosa (Keel et al 2005), and night eating syndrome (Stunkard et al 2005)—
because the questions in the CIDI did not permit evaluation of these conditions.

In conclusion, the lifetime prevalence of the individual eating disorders ranged from 0.6–4.5%;
these disorders displayed substantial comorbidity with other DSM-IV disorders and were
frequently associated with role impairment. These patterns raise concerns that such a low
proportion of individuals with these disorders obtain treatment for their eating problems. As
it turns out, though, a high proportion of cases did receive treatment for comorbid conditions.
Thus, detection and treatment of eating disorders might be increased substantially if treatment
