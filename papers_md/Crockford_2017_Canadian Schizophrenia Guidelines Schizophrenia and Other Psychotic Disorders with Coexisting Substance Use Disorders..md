Abstract
Objective: Persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders frequently have coexisting substance use disorders that
require modifications to treatment approaches for best outcomes. The objectives of this review were to identify evidence-
based practices best practices that improve outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia and substance used disorders.
Method: We reviewed guidelines that were published in the last 5 years and that included systematic reviews or meta-
analyses. Most of our recommendations came from 2 publications from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE): the 2011 guidance titled Coexisting Severe Mental Illness (Psychosis) and Substance Misuse: Assessment and
Management in Healthcare Settings and the 2014 guidance titled Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Adults: Prevention and
Management. We placed these recommendations into the Canadian context to create this guideline.

Results: Evidence supports the inclusion of individuals with coexisting substance use disorders in first-episode psychosis
programs. The programs should integrate psychosis and substance use treatments, emphasizing ongoing monitoring of both
substance use and patterns and symptoms. The best outcomes are achieved with combined use of antipsychotic medications
and addiction-based psychosocial interventions. However, limited evidence is available to recommend using one antipsychotic
medication over another or one psychosocial intervention over another for persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders with coexisting substance use disorders.
Conclusions: Treating persons who have schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders with coexisting substance use
disorders can present clinical challenges, but modifications in practice can help engage and retain people in treatment, where
significant improvements over time can be expected.

Substance use disorders are frequent in persons who have
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Large epide-
miologic surveys suggest that the prevalence of substance
use disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine use disorders)
in persons with schizophrenia is 47% and 44.8%, respec-
tively,1,2 with the most frequently used substances being
alcohol and cannabis. In addition, cigarette smoking has
been reported in 60% to 90% of persons with schizophrenia
and other psychotic disorders.3,4

Cannabis and stimulant use, in particular, appear to be
associated with the development of psychotic symptoms;
cannabis use appears to be an independent risk factor for the
development of persistent psychotic disorders, particularly
in those at genetic risk for developing schizophrenia and
those who previously experienced psychotic symptoms.5-7
Regular cannabis use in adolescence appears to significantly
increase the risk of developing symptoms of psychosis, even

after abstinence for a year, while the presence of psychotic
symptoms does not appear to increase the risk of cannabis
use.8 A meta-analysis reported that persons who have used
cannabis appear to develop psychosis 2.7 years earlier than
those who have not used cannabis.9

Substance use not only appears to increase the risk of
developing psychotic symptoms but also negatively affects
the course of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,

where persons have more positive symptoms, higher rates of
treatment nonadherence, greater relapse rates, more depres-
sion and more service utilization.10-13 However, the impact
of substance use on the neurocognitive symptoms of psycho-
sis is less clear, particularly for cannabis use.14,15 Early sub-
stance use may induce overt psychosis in persons who are
less cognitively vulnerable, resulting in the potential for
improvement in cognitive functioning and decreased disabil-
ity, especially with abstinence.14,16

Substance use can complicate the diagnosis of psychosis:
Because substance use can produce psychotic symptoms, it
can be unclear whether symptoms are substance-induced or
representative of an underlying psychotic disorder. Many
persons initially diagnosed with substance-induced psycho-
sis are later diagnosed with a primary psychotic disor-
der.17-19 Persons using substances may be reluctant to
disclose their substance use, but when posed with a potential
psychotic diagnosis these people may be more prone to attri-
bute their symptoms to substance use, potentially to avoid
having a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and the need to
take antipsychotic medications. Indicators of an underlying
psychotic disorder being present include persistence of psy-
chotic symptoms with abstinence, symptoms out of keeping
with the type or amount of substance used, family history of
schizophrenia, typical positive symptoms of schizophrenia
(e.g., commenting auditory hallucinations) and/or presence
of negative/cognitive symptoms.20

Methods

The methods for the Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines are
described in brief here; please see the Introduction and
Guideline Development Process section for an in-depth
description.

The guidelines were developed using the ADAPTE pro-
cess.21 Recognizing that the development of guidelines
requires substantial resources, the ADAPTE process was
created to take advantage of existing guidelines and reduce
duplication of effort.

The first phase of ADAPTE, the set-up phase, involved
preparing for the ADAPTE process. We assembled a
national multidisciplinary panel from across Canada, includ-
ing stakeholders with expertise in schizophrenia and mental
health, health policy, patient advocacy and lived experience
with schizophrenia. Endorsement bodies for the guidelines
include the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Schi-
zophrenia Society of Canada, which were also heavily
involved in the dissemination and implementation strategy.
The second phase of the ADAPTE process, the adaptation
phase, involves identifying specific health questions; search-
ing for and retrieving guidelines; assessing guideline quality,
currency, content, consistency and applicability; making
decisions regarding adaptation; and preparing the draft
adapted guideline. We searched for guidelines on schizo-
phrenia in guideline clearinghouses and on the websites of
well-established guideline developers for mental health

disorders, including the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guide-
lines Network (SIGN), the American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry and the European Psychiatric Association. A
MEDLINE search was performed using the term guideline
as publication type and schizophrenia as title or clinical
topic. Inclusion criteria were that the guideline needed to
be published after 2010, the guideline needed be written in
English, and recommendations had to be developed using a
defined and systematic process. We identified 8 current
guidelines that were potentially suitable for adaptation.
These guidelines were reviewed and evaluated in duplicate
using the AGREE II tool,22 an instrument to evaluate the
methodological rigour and transparency with which a guide-
line is developed. Based on this evaluation, we determined
that the 6 guidelines were of suitable quality and content for
adaptation (Table 1). Recommendations from each guideline
were extracted and classified based on content and then
reviewed by the relevant working group. Following the
ADAPTE process, working groups selected between guide-
lines and recommendations to create an adapted guideline.
Each working group carefully examined each recommenda-
tion, the evidence from which the recommendation was
derived and the acceptability and applicability of the rec-
ommendation to the Canadian context. After reviewing the
recommendations from the guidelines, the working groups
decided which recommendations to accept and which to
reject and which recommendations were acceptable but
needed to be modified. Care was taken when modifying
existing recommendations not to change the recommenda-
tions to such an extent that they were no longer in keeping
with the evidence upon which they were based.

Each working group developed a final list of recommen-
dations from the included guidelines that were presented to
the entire guideline panel at an in-person consensus meeting.
Working group leaders presented each recommendation and
its rationale to the panel. Anonymous voting by the entire
panel using clicker technology was conducted for each rec-
ommendation. Recommendations required agreement by
80% of the group to be included in the Canadian guidelines.
If a recommendation did not receive 80% agreement, the
group discussed whether minor modifications to the recom-
mendation would alter the likelihood that the recommenda-
tion would pass. In these situations, recommendations were
modified (as described above) and the group revoted at a
later date using an online anonymous survey. Whenever
modifications in wording were made to original recommen-
dations, the text “modified recommendation from” appears
in the Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines, and the source of
each recommendation is noted after the recommendation
statement. The strength or grade of the recommendation is
provided if applicable, using the system which the recom-
mendation came from. The strength of recommendation for
each NICE guidance used in this section and their meaning
are explained in brief in Table 2 (see the Introduction and

Strength of recommendations
The wording used in NICE recommendations denotes the certainty
with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the
recommendation).

Interventions that must (or must not) be used
We usually use ‘must’ or ‘must not’ only if there is a legal duty to
apply the recommendation. Occasionally we use ‘must’ (or ‘must
not’) if the consequences of not following the recommendation
could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.
Interventions that should (or should not) be used—a

‘strong’ recommendation

We use ‘offer’ (and similar words such as ‘refer’ or ‘advise’) when we
are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention
will do more good than harm and will be cost effective.

Interventions that could be used
We use ‘consider’ when we are confident that an intervention will
do more good than harm for most patients, and will be cost
effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The
choice of intervention, and whether to have the intervention at
all, is more likely to depend on the patient’s values and
preferences than for a strong recommendation.

Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee reviewed and
approved the guideline method process.

For this report, the following specific recommendations
have been derived from NICE guidance23,24 and adapted for
the Canadian context by our working group. The terms sub-
stance use or substance use disorder have been used to be in
keeping with DSM-5 terminology25 instead of the term sub-
stance misuse used in the NICE guidance.23,24

Recommendation 1

When working with adults and young people with known or
suspected psychosis and coexisting substance use, take time
to engage the person from the start and build a respectful,
trusting, nonjudgmental relationship in an atmosphere of
hope and optimism. Be direct in your communications, use
a flexible and motivational approach and take the following

chosis and substance use.

Guideline Development Process section for a more detailed
description). Once the voting and consensus process was
completed, each working group created a separate report that
contains all the recommendations adapted from the included
guidelines, with accompanying text explaining the rationale
for each recommendation.

During the finalization phase, the Canadian Schizophre-
nia Guidelines were externally reviewed by those who will
be affected by their uptake: practitioners, policymakers,
health administrators, patients and their families. The exter-
nal review asked questions about whether the users approve
of the draft guideline, strengths and weaknesses and sug-
gested modifications. The process was facilitated through
the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry and the Schizophrenia
Society of Canada. The Canadian Psychiatric Association

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 2

When working with adults and young people with known or
suspected psychosis and coexisting substance use, note the
following:

(cid:2) Ensure that discussions take place in settings in
which confidentiality, privacy and dignity can be
maintained.

(cid:2) Avoid clinical language without adequate explanation.

(cid:2) Provide independent interpreters (who are not related

to the person) if needed.

(cid:2) Aim to preserve continuity of care and minimize
changes of key workers in order to foster a therapeutic
relationship.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 3

Health care professionals working with adults and young peo-
ple with psychosis and coexisting substance [use] should
ensure that they are competent to engage, assess and negotiate
with service users from diverse cultural and ethnic back-
grounds [including indigenous people] and their families,
carers or significant others.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 4

Work with local minority and ethnic [including indigenous
people] organizations and groups to help support and engage
adults and young people with psychosis and coexisting sub-
stance [use]. Offer organizations and groups information and
training about how to recognize psychosis with coexisting
substance [use] and access treatment and care locally.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 5

Offer written and verbal information to adults and young
people appropriate to their level of understanding about the
nature and treatment of both their psychosis and substance
use. Offer information and advice about the risks associated
with substance [use] and the negative impact it can have on
the experience and management of psychosis.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 6

Encourage families, carers or significant others to be
involved in the treatment of adults and young people with
psychosis and coexisting substance use to help support treat-
ment and care and promote recovery. When families, carers
or significant others live with or are in close contact with the
person with psychosis and coexisting substance use, offer
family intervention.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Although there are currently few studies of family inter-
vention specifically for persons with coexisting psychosis
and substance use disorders,26 the evidence for the benefit
of family intervention for improving outcomes in schizo-
phrenia is well established.27,28

Recommendation 7

Offer families, carers or significant others a carer’s assessment
of their caring, physical, social and mental health needs. Where

needs are identified, develop a care plan for the family member
or carer.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 8

Offer written and verbal information to families, carers or
significant others appropriate to their level of understanding
about the nature and treatment of psychosis and substance
[use], including how they can help to support the person.
Written information should be available in the appropriate
language or, for those who cannot use written text, in an
accessible format (audio or video).

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Persons with psychosis and coexisting substance use dis-
orders can encounter barriers to their care, potentially wor-
sening outcomes.29

Recommendation 9

Do not exclude adults and young people with psychosis and
coexisting substance use disorder from age-appropriate men-
tal health care because of their substance use disorder.

Recommendation 10

Do not exclude adults and young people with psychosis and
coexisting substance use disorder from age-appropriate sub-
stance use disorder services because of a diagnosis of
psychosis.

Recommendation 11

For most adults with psychosis and coexisting substance use
disorder, treatment for both conditions should be provided
by health care professionals in mental health care.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

To date, the best evidence suggests that integrated sub-
stance use and psychosis treatment provided in a mental
health care setting may lead to the best treatment outcomes
compared with care provided in a parallel or sequential fash-
ion.30,31 While a specialized concurrent disorder program
providing dual diagnosis enhanced services may be the ideal
setting for treatment, these services are available only in
some major urban centres. If a concurrent disorder program
is present, it should be used; otherwise, the next best treat-
ment setting would be a specialized psychosis treatment pro-
gram.30-32 Interestingly, for early psychosis populations, to
date the evidence suggests that additional treatments beyond
those involving assessment and monitoring of substance use
on top of typical services provided in an early psychosis
program have not been shown to be more effective.32 It may
be that the ability to demonstrate differences between usual
early psychosis treatments and those with further specialized
substance use treatment components is limited by several
factors: the fact that many persons presenting for treatment

628

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 62(9)

stop substance use on their own, while the most ill patients
may persist in their use; commonalities between treatment
as usual and specialized treatments (e.g., focus on engage-
ment, motivational practices, etc.); substance use treatment
not being matched appropriately to the stage of change for
substance use; potential negative symptoms or cognitive
deficits limiting psychosocial approaches; and/or overem-
phasis on group-based treatments that may have limited
retention.

The management of all persons with psychosis and coex-
isting substance use disorders should be based on a compre-
hensive, multidisciplinary assessment.

Recommendation 12

Health care professionals in all settings should routinely ask
adults and young people with known or suspected psychosis
about their use of cigarettes, alcohol and prescribed and
nonprescribed (including illicit) drugs. If the person has used
substances, ask about all of the following:

(cid:2) Particular substance(s) used
(cid:2) Quantity, frequency and pattern of use
(cid:2) Route of administration
(cid:2) Duration of current level of use

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 13

Health care professionals in all settings should routinely
assess adults and young people with known or suspected
substance use disorders for possible psychosis. Seek corro-
borative evidence from families, carers or significant others
where this is possible and permission is given.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 14

Adults and young people with psychosis and coexisting sub-
stance use disorder attending mental health services should
be offered a comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment,
including assessment of all of the following:

(cid:2) Personal history
(cid:2) Mental, physical and sexual health
(cid:2) Social, family and economic situation
(cid:2) Accommodation, including history of homelessness

and stability of current living arrangements

(cid:2) Current and past substance [use] and its impact upon

their life, health and response to treatment
(cid:2) Criminal justice history and current status
(cid:2) Personal strengths and weaknesses and readiness to
change their substance use and other aspects of their
lives

The assessment may need to take place over several meet-
ings to gain a full understanding of the person and the range

of problems he or she experiences and to promote
engagement.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

It is also recommended that the following are assessed:

(cid:2) Symptoms of psychosis and their duration
(cid:2) Family history of psychosis or substance use disorders
(cid:2) Correlation of psychotic symptoms to substance use

patterns

(cid:2) Review of prior psychosis treatments and their

outcomes

(cid:2) Assessment of relative severity of psychosis to sub-

stance use (to guide initial treatment focus)

(cid:2) Safety-based issues: suicide, aggression/homicide/
violence, physical health risks (e.g., withdrawal, over-
dose, seizures, blood-borne infections)

Recommendation 15

Review any changes in the person’s use of substances. This
should include changes in the way the use of substances
affects the person over time:

(cid:2) Patterns of use
(cid:2) Mental and physical state
(cid:2) Circumstances and treatment
Share the summary with the person and record it in the care

plan.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

The use of substances and/or the effects of psychosis can

impair decision making.

Recommendation 16

If people with psychosis and coexisting substance use are
parents or carers of children or young people, ensure that the
child’s or young person’s needs are assessed.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 17

If serious concerns are identified, a child protection plan
should be developed.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 18

When working with people with psychosis and coexisting
substance use who are responsible for vulnerable adults,
ensure that the home situation is risk assessed and that safe-
guarding procedures are in place for the vulnerable adult.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie 62(9)

629

Recommendation 19

Ensure that the needs of young carers or dependent adults of
the person with psychosis and coexisting substance use are
assessed. Initiate safeguarding procedures where appropriate.
[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

The consequences of substance use can include worsen-
ing of psychotic symptoms, treatment nonadherence, inter-
action with prescribed agents, medical comorbidity,
increased service utilization (including emergency room vis-
its and hospitalizations), increased suicides and violence and
premature death.10-13

Recommendation 20

Monitor the physical health of adults and young people with
psychosis and coexisting substance use. Pay particular atten-
tion to the impact of alcohol and drugs (prescribed and non-
prescribed) on physical health. Monitoring should be
conducted at least once a year or more frequently if the
person has a significant physical illness or there is risk of
physical illness because of substance use.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Persons with schizophrenia have been reported to die up
to 20 years earlier than persons without this diagnosis, with
the majority of this accounted for by cardiovascular fac-
tors.33-35 While the focus in psychiatric practice often has
been on mitigating the metabolic effects of antipsychotic
medications, cigarette smoking remains the leading preven-
table cause of premature death and disease in Canada.36,37
Cigarette smoking likely is the primary modifiable cardio-
vascular risk factor in those who have schizophrenia, as they
are more frequent cigarette smokers, smoke more cigarettes
and are more often nicotine dependent.37-39

Recommendation 21

Offer people with psychosis or schizophrenia who smoke
help to stop smoking, even if previous attempts have been
unsuccessful. Be aware of the potential significant impact of
reducing cigarette smoking on the metabolism of other
drugs, particularly clozapine and olanzapine.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 22

Warn people taking bupropion or varenicline that there is
an increased risk of adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms and
monitor them regularly, particularly in the first 2 to 3 weeks.
[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Strong evidence supports the benefit of smoking cessa-
tion interventions for persons who have schizophrenia.40
Ideally, smoking cessation should occur when persons are
psychiatrically stable and motivated for smoking cessation.
If they are precontemplative or contemplative in their stage
of change, a brief motivational intervention should be used
(e.g., the 5 A’s—Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and
their stage of change reevaluated in the future.41

For persons in preparatory or action stages of change,
smoking cessation interventions should involve psychoso-
cial counseling and support with pharmacologic interven-
tions. Although nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) are
well tolerated, their evidence for benefit in persons with
schizophrenia is limited, and there are no current placebo-
controlled trials of NRT (Grade: Very Low, 7 open-label
trials with N ¼ 650).40,42 Bupropion currently has the most
evidence for benefit (Grade: High),40,42 but persons should
be warned about potential neuropsychiatric symptoms and
monitor for them, including sleep impairment, suicidality
and reemergence of psychotic symptoms. In persons without
schizophrenia, varenicline appears to demonstrate the great-
est efficacy for smoking cessation; however, only one ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) of varenicline in persons
with schizophrenia is available, and varenicline is recom-
mended second to bupropion (Grade: Moderate).40,42-44 Data
suggest limited evidence of an increased risk of adverse
neuropsychiatric symptoms like suicidality or reemergence
of psychosis, but it remains to prudent to warn about the
potential risk for these and to monitor for them.45

Working with persons who have co-occurring substance
use disorders and schizophrenia can be rewarding but also
challenging. Practitioners should attempt to involve families,
carers or significant others in the treatment plan.

Recommendation 23

Offer information to families, carers or significant others
about local family or carer support groups and voluntary
organizations, including those for psychosis and for sub-
stance use, and help families, carers or significant others to
access these.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Practitioners should also collaborate with available local

of transdermal patches with a short-acting product
such as an inhalator, gum, lozenges or spray) for peo-
ple with psychosis or schizophrenia

(cid:2) Bupropion for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
(cid:2) Varenicline for people with psychosis or schizophrenia

Recommendation 24

Working with people who have psychosis and coexisting

Recommendation 25

Primary care providers should refer people with psychosis or
suspected psychosis, including those who are suspected of
coexisting substance use disorder, to mental health services
for assessment and further management.

Recommendation 26

Health care professionals working within mental health ser-
vices should ensure that they are competent in the recogni-

from specialists in substance use services.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 28

Consider seeking specialist advice and initiating joint
working arrangements with specialist substance use ser-
vices for adults and young people with psychosis who are
being treated in mental health services and are known to
have any of the following:

(cid:2) A severe substance use disorder
(cid:2) Multiple substance use disorders of moderate severity
or greater (i.e., alcohol and benzodiazepine use
disorders)

(cid:2) Intravenous substance use
(cid:2) Serious social disruption (i.e., homelessness, family

breakdown)

ments for both conditions.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 31
Ensure informed consent for treatment and, if there is doubt,
assess mental capacity.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Treatment—Pharmacologic

Antipsychotic medication remains the mainstay of treatment
for persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic disor-
ders, whether or not they have a coexisting substance use
disorder.46

Recommendation 32
Use antipsychotic medications according to the guideline on
schizophrenia (NICE 2009) because there is no evidence for
any differential benefit for one antipsychotic over another for
people with psychosis and coexisting substance use disorder.
[Modified from NICE Guidelines]

Pharmacotherapy studies to date focusing on persons
with schizophrenia and coexisting substance use disorders
have been limited, leading to the NICE recommendation.
However, the use of second-generation instead of first-
generation antipsychotic medications may be preferred due
to greater tolerability of second-generation antipsychotic
medications and potentially decreased likelihood for develop-
ing extrapyramidal side effects in persons with substance use
disorders (Grade: Low).47-50 In the same vein, there is some
evidence to suggest a potential preferred role of second-
generation long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic
medications over first-generation LAIs,51 but evidence for
differences in substance use outcomes or psychotic symptoms
with the use of second-generation LAIs compared with oral
second-generation antipsychotic medications has not been
demonstrated.52,53 The benefits from using second-
generation antipsychotic medications may be greater for those
who discontinue illicit substance use compared with those
who continue to use, according to a secondary analysis of data
from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effec-
tiveness (CATIE).54

Some literature has suggested a preferred role for cloza-
pine in persons with schizophrenia and coexisting substance
use disorders.50,55,56 The lone RCT in this regard compared
clozapine (n ¼ 14) and ziprasidone (n ¼ 16) in persons with
schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder; investigators found
that cannabis use equally decreased in both groups, but the
clozapine group had fewer positive symptoms, more side
effects and worse medication adherence.57 No other RCTs

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie 62(9)

631

of clozapine compared with other antipsychotic medications
are available, and all evidence is derived from retrospective
case series that may be prone to selection bias. The limited
evidence prevents clozapine from being preferentially rec-
ommended over other antipsychotic medications at this time.
Future research is required in this area.

For persons with potentially substance-induced psychoses
that do not resolve rapidly with abstinence, it is not clear
what is the most appropriate duration of antipsychotic treat-
ment. Following guidelines for a first episode of psychosis
appears prudent, especially if risk factors for persistent psy-
chosis are present, as many persons initially diagnosed with
substance-induced psychosis are later diagnosed with a pri-
mary psychotic disorder.17-19

Currently, the 3 medications indicated for use in persons
with alcohol use disorders are naltrexone, acamprosate and
disulfiram;
the best evidence is for naltrexone and
acamprosate in persons without coexisting psychiatric disor-
ders.58 Although the NICE guidelines do not directly comment
on known pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorders in per-
sons with schizophrenia and coexisting substance use disor-
ders, there is some evidence of efficacy for naltrexone (Grade:
Moderate, 2 double-blind RCTs, 2 open studies),47,48,59 limited
evidence for disulfiram (Grade: Low, 2 open-label retrospec-
tive studies)47,48,59 and no current evidence for acamprosate (1
double-blind RCT, placebo ¼ acamprosate).47,48,59

Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of cocaine use disorder
is limited, with there being no currently indicated agents for
cocaine use disorder despite multiple treatment trials.47,48,59 In
persons with schizophrenia and coexisting cocaine use disor-
ders, limited data are available for desipramine (Grade: Low, 2
prospective studies vs placebo, no randomization)47,48,59 and
imipramine (Grade: Low, 1 positive study via secondary anal-
ysis, 1 with equivocal results).47,48,59 Given the significant
potential side effects of the tricyclic antidepressants and lack
of indication for cocaine use disorder alone, the use of desipra-
mine or imipramine in persons with schizophrenia and coex-
isting cocaine use disorder is not recommended.

Despite the frequency with which cannabis use is encountered
in persons with schizophrenia, no evidence is available to support
any potentially beneficial treatments pharmacologically or psy-
chosocially.60,61 Data for cannabis use disorder have been nega-
tive for mirtazapine, bupropion, nabilone and dronabinol.47,48 In a
study of adolescent cannabis users without psychosis, one trial
suggested the benefit of oral N-acetylcysteine when combined
with contingency management.61 No trials are available regarding
this agent in persons with schizophrenia and coexisting cannabis
use disorder. Equally disappointing has been the lack of efficacy
of specific psychosocial interventions despite well-designed stud-
ies.60,62 Despite negative findings, research on treatments for can-
nabis use disorder should be a priority.

Treatment—Psychosocial

A variety of psychosocial interventions have been trialed in
persons with psychosis and coexisting substance use

disorders, including contingency management (CM), cogni-
tive behavioural therapy (CBT)/relapse prevention, motiva-
tional interviewing (MI) and combination CBT and MI.
Brief interventions (founded on MI principles, but more
advice driven) have been used, as have family interventions
and the use of assertive community treatment (ACT). All
have demonstrated some efficacy (Grade: Low to Moder-
ate)63 and should be used if available.

Recommendation 33
Do not exclude adults and young people with psychosis and
coexisting substance use from contingency management
(CM) programs because of their psychosis.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

When treating patients with psychosis and coexisting sub-
stance use disorders, the focus should be on retention in treat-
ment, gradual change in substance use behaviour over time
(decreased use initially aiming for abstinence), improved
physical and mental health and improved function as the pri-
mary treatment targets.30,31 Stage of change should be eval-
uated for each substance of use, as stage of change may differ
between substances (e.g., a person may be precontemplative
in regard to changing cigarette smoking but in the preparatory
stage of change regarding cannabis use). Try to best match an
intervention to current stage of change. Persons in precontem-
plation and contemplation stages may benefit more from brief
psychoeducation and motivational approaches, whereas per-
sons in preparatory and action stages may benefit more from
active intervention and relapse prevention planning.31

If a person is referred to a residential/inpatient treatment
program or a structured day treatment for substance use
disorders, coordinated follow-up care for his or her sub-
stance use disorder is required after completion of treat-
ment. The optimal duration of treatment is uncertain, but
patients staying in treatment longer typically have better
overall outcomes.31,64

Substance Use Treatment Services
Recommendation 34
Health care professionals in substance use services should be
competent in the following:

Recognizing the signs and symptoms of psychosis
Undertaking a mental health needs and risk assessment suffi-
cient to determine how and when to refer to mental health
services

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 35
Adults and young people with psychosis and coexisting
substance use disorders attending substance use treatment
services should be offered a comprehensive, multidisciplin-
ary mental health assessment in addition to an assessment
of their substance use.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

632

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 62(9)

Recommendation 36
Collaboration between substance use treatment services and psy-
chosis treatment services should occur, involving the following:

(cid:2) Joint meetings
(cid:2) Advice, consultation and training for treatment of

substance use disorders

(cid:2) Development of treatment protocols for persons with
schizophrenia and coexisting substance use disorders
[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Inpatient Mental Health Services

Persons with schizophrenia and coexisting substance use
disorders have increased rates of hospitalization. When they
present to inpatient units, the setting should be conducive to
recovery from both disorders for best outcomes.

Recommendation 37
All inpatient mental health services should have policies and
procedures for promoting a therapeutic environment free
from cigarettes, drugs and alcohol.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 38
When carrying out a comprehensive assessment for all adults
and young people admitted to inpatient mental health services,
ensure that they are assessed for current substance use and
evidence of withdrawal symptoms at the point of admission.
[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 39
Drug testing should only be considered in inpatient services as part
of the assessment and treatment planning for adults and young
people with psychosis and coexisting substance use disorders.

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 40
For people in inpatient settings who do not want to stop
smoking, offer nicotine replacement therapy to help them
to reduce or temporarily stop smoking.

[NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Although detoxification alone from either drugs or alco-
hol does not change treatment outcomes,65 detoxification
can be an important part of the coordinated treatment plan
for adults and young people with schizophrenia and coexist-
ing substance use disorders.

Recommendation 41
Ensure that planned detoxification from either drugs or alco-
hol is undertaken only in the following circumstances:

(cid:2) With the involvement and advice of substance use

treatment services
(cid:2) In an inpatient setting
(cid:2) As part of an overall coordinated treatment plan

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 42
Do not discharge adults and young people with psychosis
and coexisting substance use disorders from an inpatient
mental health service solely because of their substance use.
[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Recommendation 43
When adults and young people with psychosis and coexist-
ing substance use disorders are discharged from an inpatient
mental health service, ensure they have all of the following:

(cid:2) An identified care coordinator
(cid:2) A care plan that includes consideration of needs asso-
ciated with both their psychosis and their substance
use disorders
Information about the risks of overdose if they start
reusing substances, especially opioids and/or benzo-
diazepines that have been reduced or discontinued
during the inpatient stay

(cid:2)

[Modified from NICE Guidelines (Strong)]

Conclusion

Adults and young people with schizophrenia and coexisting
substance use disorders commonly present for treatment in
clinical practice. Despite this, limited treatment data are avail-
able that demonstrate preferential treatment practices regarding
the use of specific pharmacotherapies or psychosocial interven-
tions for people with schizophrenia and coexisting substance
use disorders. Best practices involve integrated psychosis and
substance use treatments, emphasizing inclusion in treatment,
ongoing evaluation of substance use patterns, and coordinated
care attempting to match treatment needs to severity of both
disorders and stage of change. Although treatment of people
with schizophrenia and coexisting substance use disorders can
have its challenges, outcome data demonstrate that treatment is
beneficial, and there being significant optimism for potentially
greater improvements when substance use is stopped.
