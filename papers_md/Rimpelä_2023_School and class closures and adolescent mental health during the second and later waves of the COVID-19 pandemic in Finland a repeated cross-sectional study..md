Abstract
Background  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have shown deterioration of adolescents’ 
mental health when comparing periods before and after the start of the pandemic when there were national school 
closures. Less is known of the following waves with more variation in school closures and their duration. We study 
here, if variation in school or class closures was related to adolescents’ mental health, if the duration mattered, and if 
the relationships were gender sensitive.

Methods  All comprehensive schools in Finland were invited to participate. Students (grades 7–9, age 13–16 years) 
answered digitally in November–December 2020 (n = 41,041) and April–May 2021 (n = 28,501). The responses were 
given anonymously. Mental health was measured by daily health complaints and moderate/severe anxiety (GAD-7, 
only in 2021). School and class closures were combined to a variable (yes/no). The duration of a closure was analysed 
in weeks. Logistic regression analysis was used.

Results  In 2020, 14% of pupils reported a school closure and 33% in 2021. The gender-adjusted odds for daily health 
complaints were higher among those with the school or class closure compared to those without (OR = 1.2 (1.1–1.3) 
in 2020; OR = 1.3 (1.2–1.3) in 2021). For anxiety, the corresponding OR was 1.3 (1.2–1.4). Girls had higher odds for both 
measures than boys and the non-binary gender had the highest. A one-week increase in the duration of closure 
had a small effect on daily health complaints OR = 1.05 (1.02–1.09) in 2020; OR = 1.05 (1.02–1.08) in 2021) and anxiety 
OR = 1.05 (1.01–1.08). Gender differences in the associations of the school or class closure with mental health were 
negligible.

Conclusions  A specific negative influence of school or class closures on adolescents’ mental health was seen when 
comparing those who had school/class closure and those who did not during the further waves of the pandemic. 
The duration of closure had a small effect, too. The non-binary gender had lowest mental health, but the influence 
of school closure on mental health was mainly similar between the genders. School closures are one of the factors in 
adolescents’ mental health, but not the only one.

Introduction
When  the  WHO  declared  COVID-19  as  a  pandemic 
on  11  March  2020  countries  all  over  the  world  closed 
schools  and  restricted  physical  contacts  [1].  In  Finland, 
schools were closed for two months in March-May 2020 
and reopened for two weeks before the summer vacation 
in the end of May. During the summer, the epidemic situ-
ation  stayed  calm  but  worsened  in  October  and  stayed 
higher during the spring 2021 [2]. In international com-
parisons, the epidemic burden was, however, low in Fin-
land. No nationwide school closure was implemented any 
more during the second and later waves of the pandemic, 
but  based  on  local  epidemic  situation,  temporary  local 
and  regional  school  closures  of  varying  durations  con-
tinued under the guidance of local governments and the 
Regional  State  Administrative  Agencies  [1].  Depending 
on a school, the duration of school closures for individual 
pupils varied. Some schools organized normal classroom 
teaching  while  others  were  forced  to  close  their  prem-
ises  for  fixed  periods  of  time  or  to  apply  remote  learn-
ing  to  part  of  the  pupil  groups  (certain  classes,  grades) 
to  avoid  physical  contacts  and  probability  of  transmis-
sions.  Consequently,  individual  pupils  were  exposed  to 
different  duration  of  school  closures  due  to  their  place 
of  residence.  Using  our  nationwide  surveys  for  upper 
grade  (7–9)  of  comprehensive  school  pupils  in  Novem-
ber–December 2020 and April–May 2021, we investigate 
whether the variation in the duration of school/class clo-
sure is related to the variation in pupils’ mental health.

Since  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic,  several  reviews 
have  reported  on  mental  health  effects  on  children  and 
youth.  Most  reviews  cover  studies  from  the  early  phase 
of  the  pandemic  in  2020,  some  reach  to  the  beginning 
of  2021  [3–9],  and  an  umbrella  review  until  the  end  of 
2021  [10].  As  summarised  in  the  umbrella  review,  most 
reviews and individual studies show a consistent picture 
of  lowering  mental  health  wellbeing  during  the  pan-
demic [10]. High prevalence of anxiety, depression, sleep 
disorders,  suicidal  behaviour,  stress-related  disorders, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  as  well  as  other 
problems  of  mental  health  were  high  during  the  pan-
demic  compared  to  findings  in  studies  before  the  pan-
demic. Even though the results were parallel, the authors 
pointed  out  that  most  studies  were  cross-sectional  and 
used  non-representative  samples.  Little  is  known  if  the 
duration  of  school  closure  is  related  to  mental  health 
problems.  Among  general  population,  a  systematic 
review and meta-analyses showed that days of lockdown 
did  not  moderate  the  association  between  the  exposure 
to the pandemic and mental health symptoms [11].

It is well known that girls report more symptoms than 
boys,  e.g.,  [12].  This  was  also  true  in  most  above-men-
tioned  studies  dealing  with  gender,  but  some  studies 
showed  no  gender  difference  [13].  A  longitudinal  study 
suggests  that  the  effects  on  the  pandemic  may  differ 
between genders [14]; depressive and internalising symp-
toms  increased  during  the  pandemic  among  female  but 
not  among  male  adolescents.  No  study  reported  mental 
health  results  for  a  non-binary  gender,  but  it  has  been 
reported  that  non-binary  pupils  experienced  remote 
learning conditions overall more negatively compared to 
girls and boys [15].

We study here (a) if adolescents whose school or class 
had  been  closed  reported  more  health  complaints  and 
anxiety compared to those whose school or class did not 
have  that  experience,  and  (b)  if  health  complaints  and 
anxiety increased with the increasing duration of school 
or class closure. Further, we are interested in differences 
between  genders  (boys,  girls,  non-binary).  Our  study 
population  covers  grade-levels  7  to  9  of  comprehensive 
schools  in  Finland,  surveyed  in  November–December 
2020 and April–May 2021.

Methods
Participants

This study started in April 2020 when local and national 
education  authorities  were  contacted  for  school  surveys 
related  to  learning  and  wellbeing  effects  of  the  COVID-
19 pandemic. A collaboration agreement was made with 
16  municipalities  first,  after  which  the  Ministry  of  Edu-
cation and Culture supported the extension to the entire 
country.  Research  permits  were  obtained  from  the  16 
municipalities  and  from  the  Ministry  for  the  rest  of  the 
country.  School  leaders  (principals)  were  contacted  for 
school-level  research  permits.  The  survey  for  all  com-
prehensive  schools  was  repeated  twice,  In  November–
December  2020  and  in  April–May  2021.  The  present 
study uses data from these two surveys. The surveys were 
carried out during the same academic year. Partially, the 
same individuals participated in both surveys. The sam-
ples were not independent and were analysed separately.

The  data  were  collected  online  using  a  digital  survey 
system  (Qualtrics).  The  links  to  the  electronic  survey 
were  delivered  to  pupils  by  school  principals  who  used 
the  electronic  communication  channels  of  the  schools. 
Participation  was  voluntary,  which  was  explicitly  men-
tioned in the instruction letter. Parents were informed by 
a digital letter, and they could prevent the participation of 
their child. Most pupils answered the survey during their 
school hours, but it was also possible to fill the question-
naire at home. The data were collected anonymously, but 

Rimpelä et al. BMC Public Health         (2023) 23:2434 Page 3 of 10

pupils were informed that school and municipality iden-
tification codes were included in the response.

In  this  study,  responses  from  the  upper  grade-levels 
7–9 (age 13–16 years) were used. In 2020, 41,041 seventh 
to ninth graders from 420 schools responded represent-
ing  60%  of  the  692  comprehensive  schools  with  respec-
tive  grade-levels.  The  schools  represented  191  (62%) 
of  the  310  Finnish  municipalities.  In  2021,  there  were 
28,501  respondents  from  321  schools  representing  46% 
of the 687 schools representing 161 (52%) municipalities. 
Thus,  the  non-response  occurred  largely  at  school  level 
due to school principals not distributing the survey. The 
sample distributions are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Outcome variables
Daily health complaints

Respondents  were  asked  if  they  had  had  the  following 
health  complaints  during  the  present  term:  (1)  neck, 
shoulder,  or  back  pain,  (2)  headache,  (3)  difficulties  in 
falling  asleep  or  getting  awake  night-time,  (4)  tiredness 
or exhaustion, (5) feeling low or depression, and (6) dif-
ficulties  with  concentration.  These  and  corresponding 
questions  have  been  widely  used  in  measuring  adoles-
cent health and wellbeing. The symptoms are perceived, 
and they are not supposed to be diagnostic criteria. The 
underlying assumption is that at this age adolescents can 
assess  and  report  their  symptoms  and  feelings  reliably. 
The  items  1  to  3  and  the  item  5  have  been  used  in  the 
HBSC study [16] the item 4 e.g., in the nationwide School 
Health Promotion Study in Finland [17] and the item 6 in 
the  Strength  and  Difficulties  Scale  [18].  For  each  symp-
tom the options were: ‘seldom or not at all’, ‘approximately 
once a month’, ‘approximately weekly’, or ‘daily’. The time 
frame ‘during the present term‘ was used instead of usual 
‘six months‘ to cover the whole school term and not the 
time  during  the  breaks.  In  Finland,  school  term  lasts 
about  4.5  months  in  autumn  and  5  months  in  spring.  If 
a  participant  had  given  an  answer  to  at  least  one  of  the 
six  items,  possible  missing  answers  in  the  other  symp-
toms  were  replaced  with  the  value  ‘seldom  or  not  at  all’. 
If  none  of  the  items  was  answered,  the  respondent  was 
excluded  from  the  analyses.  Cronbach’s  alpha  of  the  six 
health complaint questions was 0.82 in 2020 and 0.85 in 
2021, which is on a very good level. If the respondent had 
answered ‘daily’ in at least one of the symptom questions, 
they  were  classified  as  ‘yes’  in  the  binary  outcome  vari-
able daily health complaints, otherwise ‘no’. The distribu-
tions at both time points are presented in Table 1.

Moderate or severe anxiety

Anxiety during the last two weeks was measured only in 
2021 with a generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). 
Its  validity  in  a  Finnish  adolescent  population  has  been 
good [19]. The items were (1) feeling nervous, anxious, or 

on  edge,  (2)  not  being  able  to  stop  or  control  worrying, 
(3) worrying too much about different things, (4) trouble 
with  relaxing,  (5)  being  so  restless  that  it  is  hard  to  sit 
still, (6) becoming easily annoyed or irritable, (7) feeling 
afraid  as  if  something  awful  might  happen.  The  answer 
options  were  ‘not  at  all’  (0  points),  ‘on  several  days’  (1 
point), ‘on most of the days’ (2 points), ‘nearly every day’ 
(3  points),  which  were  summarised  to  a  scale  of  0–21. 
Participants, who had answered five or more of the seven 
items, were included. If a respondent had given only five 
or  six  answers,  the  missing  items  were  replaced  by  the 
respondent’s  mean  of  the  other  items.  Cronbach’s  alpha 
of the anxiousness items was 0.92.

According  to  the  instructions  of  GAD-7  measure  the 
respondents were classified as ‘no’ (< 10), ‘moderate’ (10–
14), or ‘severe’ (15–21), by their score. The distribution of 
this classification is presented in Table 1. For the analyses 
of this study, the classification was reduced binary. There-
fore,  the  ‘no’  group  remained,  and  the  ‘moderate’  and 
‘severe’ groups were combined into the ‘yes’ group of the 
binary outcome variable moderate or severe anxiety.

Explanatory variables
School or class closure

Pupils were asked, if their class or school had been closed 
during  the  present  term  with  the  following  items  (more 
than  one  could  be  answered):  (1)  no,  (2)  no,  but  some 
other  class  from  my  school  has  been,  (3)  yes,  my  class 
or group has been in quarantine, (4) yes, my school has 
been in quarantine or closed, (5) yes, my class or group is 
now  in  quarantine.  We  first  composed  a  binary  variable 
school or class closure with options ‘no’ or ‘yes’. If respon-
dents  had  ticked  the  item  1  or  2,  they  were  classified  as 
‘no’. After that, respondents who had ticked the items 3, 
4, or 5 were classified as ‘yes’. Distributions are presented 
in  Table  1.  To  analyse  the  reliability  of  pupils’  answers, 
we calculated the percentage of students giving the same 
answer (yes or no) for each school in 2020 data. Because 
a school could have more than one building and all pupil 
groups  did  not  necessarily  answer  at  the  same  time,  we 
did  not  expect  a  100%  concordance.  When  we  accepted 
a 10% deviation of the yes/no answers in the school, 85% 
of the schools were placed into the range, which can be 
interpreted as a good concordance.

Duration of school or class closure

In  the  items  3  and  4,  a  further  open  question  was  pre-
sented for those who had ticked the previous item: how 
many  days.  For  the  item  5,  the  open  question  was:  how 
many days it is expected to last. The durations were cal-
culated separately from the open questions in the items 3, 
4, and 5. In 2020, the digital data collection tool accepted 
only  numbers.  The  analysis  revealed  a  high  number  of 
missing  answers,  likely  because  closures,  particularly  if 

Rimpelä et al. BMC Public Health         (2023) 23:2434 long, were difficult to express and remember in days. The 
text  answers  in  2021  were  manually  converted  to  days, 
considering the varying units the participants had given, 
e.g.,  weeks,  months.  The  variables  duration  of  school/
class  closure  for  each  item  in  both  years  were  classified 
and  expressed  in  weeks.  Each  item  was  analysed  sepa-
rately because they were partly overlapping, and different 
types  of  closures  were  of  interest.  The  distributions  are 
presented in Table 2.

To exclude incorrect answers, we computed the maxi-
mum  duration  of  closure  which  was  the  difference 
between  the  respondent’s  answer  date  and  the  starting 
date of the school term. The personal maximums varied 
between  89  and  124  days  in  2020,  and  between  95  and 
130 days in 2021. Answers exceeding the maximum and 
answers reporting zero were excluded. In 2020, the num-
ber of excluded participants was N = 35 in item 3, N = 63 
in item 4, and N = 26 in item 5. For 2021, the correspond-
ing numbers were N = 63 in item 3, N = 76 in item 4, and 
N = 38 in item 5.

Gender was queried with three options: girl, boy, other. 
The  last  option  is  labelled  as  non-binary  in  the  text  and 
tables.

Statistical methods

To investigate the possible group effect of the school, we 
computed intraclass correlations (ICC) for both outcome 
variables, categorised as described above, using school as 
a grouping variable. For the daily health complaints, the 
results were ICC = 0.0090 in 2020 and ICC = 0.014 in 2021 
and for moderate or severe anxiety ICC = 0.0037. Due to 
the  low  ICC  values,  modelling  of  the  school  effect  was 
omitted in the analyses [20]. In the computing procedure 
of ICC values, linear mixed effects models were used for 
each  outcome  variable  by  lme4  library  of  R  [21],  using 
school as a grouping variable without other predictors. In 
these models, ICC values were computed as a quotient of 
group level variance and the sum of group level and indi-
vidual variances.

Logistic regression analysis was used for modelling the 
associations between the explanatory and outcome vari-
ables.  Daily  health  complaints  and  moderate  or  severe 
anxiety  were  used  as  dependent  variables.  Gender  and 
school or class closure or duration of school closure were

added  at  the  same  time  into  the  model  as  independent 
variables.  To  investigate  the  moderating  effect  between 
gender,  we  calculated  interaction  terms  between  gender 
and school closure / duration of school closure for each 
model.

All the analyses were computed by R Statistics [22], uti-
lizing haven [23], psych [24], lme4 [21] and lubridate [25] 
libraries, except the interaction models mentioned in the 
text by IBM SPSS version 29.0.1.0(171).

Results
Distributions  of  the  variables  are  presented  in  Tables  1 
and 2.

Table  3  shows  the  odds  ratios  for  daily  health  com-
plaints  and  moderate  or  severe  anxiety.  In  both  years, 
the  odds  for  daily  health  complaints  were  statistically 
significantly  higher  among  those  whose  school  or  class 
had  been  closed  compared  to  those  with  no  closure.

Correspondingly,  the  ORs  for  moderate  or  severe  anxi-
ety  were  statistically  significantly  higher  for  those  with 
school or class closure.

Girls reported more symptoms and anxiety than boys, 
and  those  who  perceived  themselves  non-binary,  had 
especially  high  odds.  The  difference  between  boys  and 
girls was larger in anxiety than in health symptoms and a 
particularly high OR was observed for those who identi-
fied  themselves  neither  a  boy  nor  a  girl. The  interaction 
terms  of  gender  and  school/class  closure  in  the  models 
for  daily  health  complaints  were  not  statistically  signifi-
cant  (p = 0.765  in  2020  and  p = 0.924  in  2021)  showing 
that the effect did not differ between the genders. In the 
model  for  anxiety,  the  interaction  term  was  significant 
(p = 0.024).  However,  in  the  gender-specific  analyses, 
ORs  varied  only  a  little  between  the  genders:  Girls  OR 
1.2 (1.1–1.3), p < 0.001, N = 13,435; Boys OR 1.5 (1.3–1.7), 
p < 0.001,  N = 10,798;  Non-binary  OR  1.3  (0.99–1.7), 
p = 0.056, N = 831.

The  associations  of  daily  health  complaints  with  the 
duration  of  school  or  class  closure,  expressed  in  weeks, 
are presented in Table 4 for both years. The ORs measure 
an increase in symptoms when the duration increases by 
one  week.  In  2020,  the  ORs  for  daily  health  complaints 
were  low  but  reached  the  statistical  significance  in  the 
models  of  ‘own  group  or  class’,  and  ‘school’.  The  effects 
were,  however,  very  small.  For  those  who  had  present 
school  or  class  closure,  the  OR  was  not  significant.  In 
2021,  only  ‘school’  was  statistically  significant,  and  the 
OR  was  just  marginally  increased,  but  the  OR  was  very 
low. The gender differences followed the same pattern as 
in the previous Table 3. The interaction terms of gender 
and duration of school or class closure were not statisti-
cally significant; in 2020 for models of ‘own class or group 
closed’,  ‘school  closed’  and  ‘present  closure’  the  p-val-
ues  were  0.565,  0.764,  and  0.381  and  in  2021,  p = 0.602, 
p = 0.393, p = 0.669, respectively.

Table  5.  presents  the  results  for  severe  or  moder-
ate  anxiety  with  the  duration  of  school  or  class  closure 

measures. Only the measure ‘school’ was statistically sig-
nificant. The gender pattern was similar as in the earlier 
tables. The interaction terms were not statistically signifi-
cant between the duration of closure measures and gen-
der in these models (for ‘own group or class’ p = 0.899, for 
‘school’ p = 0.704, for ‘present closure’ p = 0.339.)

Discussion
Our  study  showed  higher  daily  health  complaints  and 
severe or moderate anxiety among those adolescents who 
were exposed to school or class closures during the sec-
ond and later waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. A slight 
decrease  in  mental  health  was  seen  when  the  duration 
of  closure  increased.  The  non-binary  gender  had  lower 
mental health compared to girls, and particularly to boys, 
but the influence of the school or class closure and dura-
tion of closure on mental health did not differ negligible 
between  the  genders.  At  the  time  of  our  study,  there 
were no national school lockdown anymore but local and 
regional school or class closures of a varying duration.

Most  previous  studies  have  shown  worsening  of  ado-
lescent mental health during the pandemic compared to 
the  time  before  (e.g.,  [12]).  We  showed  that  during  the 
pandemic, mental health was worse among pupils whose 
school  or  class  was  closed  compared  to  those  without 
this experience. Results of this study indicate that school 
may represent security and stability under uncertain situ-
ations, such as the pandemic. Moreover, school provides 
a place to interact with peer, which is shown to be espe-
cially important during pandemic [17].

It  is  difficult  to  separate  the  influence  of  school  clo-
sures  from  the  influence  of  other  pandemic  restrictions 
and from the threat of the pandemic in people’s mind in 
general,  but  it  is  likely  that  our  results  reflect  a  specific 
effect of school closure more reliably than those compar-
ing wellbeing before and after the start of the pandemic. 
In Sweden, schools were not closed for children under 16 
years unlike in Finland [26] but nevertheless, a decrease 
in adolescents’ mental health was observed [27]. It seems

the COVID-19 pandemic has settled down to an ordinary 
seasonal infectious disease.

Conclusions
Our  study  showed  the  specific  negative  influence  of 
school or class closures on pupils’ mental health by com-
paring  the  groups  exposed  to  the  closure  with  those 
who  were  not  exposed  during  the  further  waves  of  the 
pandemic. The duration of school or class closure had a 
small effect, too. The non-binary gender had lower men-
tal health compared to girls and particularly to boys, but 
the influence of closure was not related to gender. From 
the  point  of  view  of  pupils’  mental  health,  school  and 
class closures are harmful but if these are necessary, the 
duration should be as short as possible. In the pandemic 
situation, school and class closures seem to be one factor 
which reduces pupils’ mental health but not the only one.

that  among  adolescents  both  school  closures  and  other 
aspects  of  the  pandemic  have  influenced  their  mental 
wellbeing.

Our results of the duration of school or class closures 
showed  a  decreasing  mental  health  when  the  number 
of  closure  days  increased.  The  decrease  per  week  in  the 
duration  of  closure  was,  however,  small.  No  studies  on 
solely adolescents were found but a three-country study 
with a small sample size and parents’ answering for chil-
dren and adolescents could not show a systematic pattern 
of  psychological  symptoms  after  two-,  five-  and  eight-
weeks quarantine [28]. Studies on adults and hospitalized 
patients,  as  summarised  in  a  systematic  review,  suggest 
that  the  increased  duration  of  quarantine  is  associated 
with negative psychological and mental health outcomes, 
one  week  or  longer  quarantine  particularly  showing  the 
increased risk [29].

Our  study  was  cross-sectional  and  does  not  show  if 
mental  health  changed  over  time.  All  measures  were 
reported by the pupils. Self-reports may include random 
errors and even bias. Concerning the duration, the num-
ber  of  missing  answers  was  relatively  high  in  both  sur-
vey  years  and  particularly  in  the  first  survey  where  only 
days, in numbers, were accepted in the answer. The reli-
ability of the individual answers may not be optimal due 
to  memory  bias  or  difficulties  to  calculate  the  duration, 
especially if there were closures in more than one occa-
sion. The concordance of answers on school closure (yes/
no) showed a high concordance. The number of respon-
dents  was  high,  which  diminishes  random  errors.  The 
lack of anxiety measure in 2020 limits the interpretation 
of the effect of anxiety. Even if the estimates of our study 
are not exact, the direction of the effects is expected and 
unlikely to be biased.

In Finland, the first wave of the pandemic with school 
and  society  lockdown  prevailed  in  March-May  2020 
while our study concerned the later waves in November-
December  2020  and  March-May  2021.  In  their  meta-
analysis, Racine et al. [30] concluded that the prevalence 
of  clinically  elevated  depression  and  anxiety  symptoms 
were higher in studies collected later in the pandemic. A 
German study showed that adolescents’ anxiety disorder 
was  still  high  on  the  second  pandemic  schoolyear  com-
pared  to  the  pre-pandemic  situation  [31]  and  an  Aus-
tralian study showed that mental health symptoms were 
high  both  at  the  time  of  school  closure  and  when  the 
schools  were  reopened  [16].  In  our  study,  prevalence  of 
daily  health  complaints  was  slightly  higher  in  2021  than 
in  2020  and  if  we  compare  these  results  with  our  first 
corresponding survey in May 2020 [32], a slight system-
atic  increase  can  be  seen.  It  is  possible  that  the  burden 
of  mental  health  consequences  among  adolescents  and 
young adults increases when the pandemic prolongs, and 
we cannot exclude a possibility of a further rise even after

Declarations

Ethics approval and consent to participate
All methods in this study were carried out in accordance with relevant 
guidelines and regulations. The data were the second and third survey of the 
study of Schooling, teaching, and well-being of school community during the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. Local and national education authorities were 
contacted in April 2020. A collaboration agreement was made first with 16 
municipalities in Southern Finland, after which the Ministry of Education and 
Culture supported the extension to the whole country. Research permits were 
obtained from the 16 original municipalities and for the rest of the country 
from the Ministry which is the highest authority for schools. School leaders 
(i.e., principals) were contacted for school-level research permits. The surveys 
were anonymous and were part of ordinary schoolwork.
Our study complies with the guidelines of the Finnish National Board of 
Research Integrity (TENK publications 3/2019 The ethical principles of research 
with human participants and ethical review in the human sciences in Finland, 
https://www.tenk.fi). According to the guidelines, our study did not need an 
ethical review because it did not contain any of the following factors where 
the review was needed: 1 Participation in the research deviates from the 
principle of informed consent. Participation is not, for example, voluntary or 
the subject is not given sufficient or correct information about the research. 
2 The research involves intervening in the physical integrity of research 
participants. 3 The focus of the research is on minors under the age of 15, 
without separate consent from a parent or carer or without informing a parent 
or carer in a way that would enable them to prevent the child’s participation 
in the research. 4 Research that exposes participants to exceptionally strong 
stimuli. 5 Research that involves a risk of causing mental harm that exceeds 
the limits of normal daily life to the research participants or their family 
members or others closest to them. 6 Conducting the research could involve 
a threat to the safety of participants or researchers or their family members or 
others closest to them.
Participants’ informed consent was shown by their answer to the survey. The 
purpose of the study was stated in the information letter to the pupils and in 
the beginning of the pupils’ questionnaire. The pupils’ questionnaire started 
with information that the survey was voluntary, and no consequences will 
follow if the survey is not answered, and further that the pupil can interrupt 
answering any time without giving a reason. According to the ethical 
principles of research by Finnish National Board of Research Integrity (TENK 
publications 3/2019), for a minor of 15 years and over own informed consent 
is sufficient, and for minors under 15 years in survey-based research involving 
large number of respondents, it is enough to inform parents so that they can

information channels of the school, the school leader informed parents of 
the purpose and methods of the study with the information letter prepared 
by the research group. The possibility to refuse their child’s participation was 
explicitly stated in the parents’ information letter. If they wished to deny the 
participation, they were advised to notify the teacher.
