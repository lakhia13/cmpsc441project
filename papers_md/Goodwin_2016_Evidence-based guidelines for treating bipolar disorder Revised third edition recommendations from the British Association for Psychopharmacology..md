Abstract

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and targets of 
treatment for bipolar disorder. The third version is based explicitly on the available evidence and 
presented, like previous Clinical Practice Guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision 
making for practitioners: it may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers, and 
assist audit. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the 
corresponding evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its 
treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. 
The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from these participants. The best evidence 
from randomized controlled trials and, where available, observational studies employing quasi-
experimental designs was used to evaluate treatment options. The strength of recommendations 
has been described using the GRADE approach. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar 
disorder, clinical management, and strategies for the use of medicines: in short-term treatment of 
episodes, relapse prevention and stopping treatment. The use of medication is integrated with a 
coherent approach to psychoeducation and behaviour change.

Introduction

Page 3

Bipolar disorder has been and still is a relatively neglected condition. This feeds a 
perception, which we broadly share, that treatment could and should be improved. 
Guidelines provide an opportunity to enhance quality of care by advocating particular 
treatment approaches through systematically derived statements that can help individual 
patients and clinicians to make decisions. They have had an important impact on patterns of 
prescribing for bipolar patients (Bjorklund et al., 2015).

Guideline recommendations are based on evidence. Nevertheless, the principal 
recommendations usually derive from average effects in patient populations. Such 
recommendations may be expected to apply about 70% of the time so we have used 
expressions like “Clinicians should consider…‥” in the text. However, there will be 
occasions when adhering to such a recommendation unthinkingly could do more harm than 
good.

We will also describe treatment options in a way that is not prescriptive. They recognise that 
implementation will depend on individual and local circumstances. Options will reflect up-
to-date evidence and may highlight current uncertainties.

Finally, we make consensus statements, the implications of which should shape and inform 
decision making.

This guideline should be read alongside NICE 2014 Bipolar disorder: assessment and 
management (NICE2014) (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg185 ), the recommendations 
from which are in places compared with our own.

The quality of the evidence base

Evidence categories (I to IV) traditionally imply a hierarchy from the best evidence, based 
on high quality randomized trials, to the weakest, based on opinion/clinical impression 
(Shekelle et al., 1999). This approach explicitly downgrades non-experimental descriptive 
studies of treatment effects in favour of any RCT; in so doing, it confounds design with 
quality.

In previous editions (Goodwin, 2003; Goodwin, 2009), we ranked individual 
recommendations on the basis of the supporting evidence using this scheme. This can be 
unduly formulaic. For example, weight may be given to positive findings from small, 
inconclusive studies simply because they were randomized trials. Like others (Kessing, 
2015), we have been impressed by new observational data linking treatment exposures with 
clinical outcome. In the past such data would have been rated inferior to RCTs as a matter of 
principle (see Table 1). However, the quality and scale of some routinely collected data sets 
can provide relatively unbiased and reliable evidence for the effectiveness and safety of a 
treatment. While non-randomized, such evidence is more convincing than any but the 
highest quality RCTs, and with superior external validity. In addition, the availability of 
network meta-analysis of RCTs has given us the opportunity to re-think how to

contextualize the quality of the evidence for an individual drug in the overall treatment 
strategy.

The need for a more flexible appraisal of the evidence has been recognized by the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s GRADE system (http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_12/12_2.htm). Even 
though we could not adopt the detailed methodology recommended for its full 
implementation, as a bottom up procedure, we followed the spirit of the GRADE approach, 
top down, to justify the quality standard of recommendations in our different treatment 
sections. We already have the major data synthesis conducted for NICE2014, so we did not 
replicate their efforts. The point of the GRADE system is to make the basis for choosing 
recommendations transparent.

Finally we have made many recommendations for standards of care. Standards are intended 
to apply rigidly. Many standards are driven by ethical or clinical consensus rather than 
formal evidence. Where standards are evidence-based, confidence and consensus must be 
very high, requiring that standards be adhered to most of the time. We have phrased such 
recommendations without qualification and marked (S), so ‘Clinicians should …… (S)’.

Throughout, a particular recommendation will imply an estimation of average benefit/risk. 
In fact, the estimation of potential benefits and harms is not a widely understood science. It 
is very encouraging that the European Medicines Agency has allowed pioneering work in 
recent years to apply decision theory to the approval process of new drugs (Phillips et al., 
2011). This demonstrates the potential to understand benefit-risk using quantitative models 
(Mt-Isa et al., 2014). It is an approach that has also informed the estimate of relative harms 
by drugs that are used ‘recreationally’ (Nutt et al., 2010). In a better future, such models 
could be used by doctors or patients who want robust estimates of benefits and harms, to 
inform decisions in an individual case. For the time being, we have made do with opinion 
based on research evidence, the decisions of regulators to approve particular medicines and 
clinical experience.

Methodology

This document is the result of an initial meeting held on 9th February 2015. Expert 
participants were asked to review specific areas in which new data have become available 
from systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies. After 
brief presentation, a discussion identified consensus and areas of uncertainty. A narrative 
literature review was assembled to illustrate the consensus points. This draft was circulated 
to participants. Their feedback was, as far as possible incorporated into the final version of 
the guidelines.

Identification of Relevant Evidence

All the consensus points and the guideline recommendations can be linked to relevant 
evidence through the literature review. As already explained, our methodology did not allow 
for a systematic review of all possible data from primary sources and the recent NICE2014 
bipolar guideline provided a comprehensive collation of relevant data to about two years ago

Strengths of Evidence and Recommendations for Guidelines

Strengths of Recommendation

Grade of recommendations are shown in Table 2. This approach allows for judgement to be 
made that downgrades some evidence (e.g. results, even if consistent, from small clinical 
trials, where bias is highly likely), and upgrades other findings (e.g. from observational 
studies in large samples with strong quasi-experimental designs). Where evidence is sparse, 
it has been necessary to extrapolate from relevant evidence where it is available. Weaker 
levels of recommendation may cover key areas of practice. Recommendations will be starred 
as in Table 2.

Scope and Target of the Guidelines

The content of the guidelines is relevant for all doctors treating patients with bipolar 
disorder. We hope that in most cases these will be doctors who are specialists in psychiatry. 
However we have also written the guidelines to help inform general practitioners, patients 
and their families, and other health care professionals involved in the management of 
patients with bipolar disorder.

Clinical psychologists and other colleagues providing psychotherapy to patients with bipolar 
disorder are a particularly important group who need to understand and acknowledge the 
complementary roles for patients of medication and psychological treatment.

We have emphasized our interest in evidence. However, we could not review all the relevant 
literature in the detail required to give a fully comprehensive text. Even distilling the 
evidence and summarising points of consensus, relating mainly to medical management of 
bipolar disorder, does not result in a format that is particularly brief or easy to use. 
Accordingly, the document consists of two parts. Part 1 abstracts the key recommendations 
(and some of the key points of evidence) and can inform everyday practice. Part 2 indicates 
consensus points that emerged and briefly summarises the evidence. The structure and 
content are broadly but not precisely aligned between Parts 1 and 2.

Finally, in Part I, we identified a list of quality standards for audit based on our most 
important recommendations.

Nomenclature

In this manuscript, we will avoid, where possible, the use of generic terms for drugs based 
on indication and instead prefer to use descriptions of mode of action. The Neuroscience 
based Nomenclature (NbN) is a new system to promote the description and classification of 
psychotropic drugs in this way. It aims to provide an app-based update of relevant and 
specific scientific, regulatory and clinical information, to support rational prescribing 
(https://www.ecnp.eu/projects-initiatives/nomenclature.aspx ). The use of a 
pharmacologically driven nomenclature, which highlights pharmacological targets and 
modes of action, helps clinicians to make informed choices (for example by combining two

different targets or adding a complementary mode of action). It is a work in progress, and 
the voluntary suppression of the familiar terms antipsychotic, antidepressant and 
anticonvulsant can only be partial. When we use the term antidepressant, for example, it 
should be understood that we are referring to drugs used in the treatment of unipolar 
depression. The problem is, of course, that not all the drugs used for unipolar depression are 
currently described as antidepressants and antidepressants are not active specifically in 
depression. Thus, antipsychotics are effective in psychosis, mania and, in some cases, 
depression, and anticonvulsants are effective in epilepsy but also mania and depression. NbN 
will give us a larger vocabulary and a better grasp of what our medicines actually do if we 
make the necessary effort.

Caveats

We are committed to the principle of basing recommendations on the best possible evidence 
and, for treatment efficacy, this will usually be evidence from randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs). However, there are important limitations to such evidence. We highlight these 
limitations here so what follows is informed by this perspective.

Drug treatment trials

Drug trials are usually conducted by companies seeking to register new compounds. Such 
trials are now usually of good quality: matched placebo medication, randomized and 
concealed allocation, blinded treatment and pre-specified analysis plans. Nevertheless, it is 
often stated that sponsor (allegiance) bias influences the outcome of clinical trials of new 
medicines (in favour of the sponsored product). One important explanation for this global 
conclusion is that company sponsored studies may more often be placebo controlled than 
independent studies, and will tend to have larger effect sizes for that reason. Indeed, for 
dopamine antagonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors there were no differences in effect 
size between industry supported and non-industry supported trials when the designs were 
similar (Lundh et al., 2012). The unthinking position that companies can fix the results of 
their studies to inflate positive effects is wrong, and is not the main reason we should treat 
such studies with caution.

In fact, sponsors can only easily influence outcomes by biasing the design of the study: for 
example, choice of dose, comparator or unblinding (if adverse reactions are obvious). 
Unblinding could lead to inflation of effect sizes by biasing assessment. Measures of 
blinding should be included in all such studies for patients and raters, but are often omitted 
or not reported. This potential problem should be kept in mind when examining the 
coherence of network meta-analyses which include placebo as the main comparator.

The reporting of adverse reactions in clinical trials is also less systematic than it could be, 
and has often relied on ambiguous tick-box categories to capture usually subjective 
complaints. The controversy arising from how self harm or suicidality should be identified 
as an adverse reaction has been particularly problematic(Gibbons et al., 2015; Posner et al., 
2007). This means that the balance between benefits and harms can be difficult to assess 
from trial data. In describing outcomes that patients may experience themselves or that may

be detectable by observation we will refer to “adverse reactions”; “adverse effects” are 
unwanted, measured consequences of drug treatment (Aronson, 2013).

Sponsor bias is also confused with publication bias. There is no doubt that the way industry-
supported data was published has been a major problem in past decades. This mainly took 
the form of over-stating product advantages and cherry picking for publication the most 
positive trials or the most positive outcome measures. Non-publication of negative results 
was also very common. This is now partially corrected by trial registration and disclosure of 
‘negative’ studies by companies. In addition, full disclosure of all analysed data has long 
been required by the regulatory authorities and this information is usually accessible if not 
actually published.

The quality and reproducibility of individual trials is critical. As a rule, companies must 
convince regulators that new drugs are better than placebo. Can they recruit representative 
patients into the necessary trials? While the patients recruited into company trials meet 
diagnostic criteria for BD, the list of inclusion/exclusion criteria is often so long as to render 
the resulting sample highly atypical, and not representative of the most ill patients with 
multiple co-morbidities we actually see in practice. The exclusion of patients with co-
morbid substance misuse in trials of mania and of patients with suicidality in bipolar 
depression has the highest impact (Hoertel et al., 2013). This is compounded by 
heterogeneous rates of recruitment and associated with heterogeneous results across sites in 
multi-centre trials. In acute studies, high placebo response rates at some sites will drown out 
efficacy signals at others with lower placebo responses (Yatham et al., 2015b). In addition, 
many acute treatment studies in psychiatry are only 6-8 weeks in duration and the artificial 
nature of clinical trial procedures and the difficulties of recruitment mean dropout rates are 
high. This severely reduces the power to detect effects, so trial methodology is probably as 
likely to under-estimate drug effect as to magnify it.

Substantial drop out rates are common even in quite short-term RCTs. The right to drop out 
of studies is actually emphasized in the information given to participants in trials! However, 
high attrition rates have negative consequences for the power to detect effects and obviously 
defeat the purpose of longer-term studies. The effect is sometimes described as a bias, and 
NICE2014 heavily downgrades many of the RCTs for the medication of bipolar disorder on 
this basis. We have not taken the same view, because it is clearly a limitation of RCTs in 
general, but when particularly severe, it must limit the validity and generalizability of any 
conclusions (Leon et al., 2006).

Finally, outcomes in acute treatment studies are often rating scale scores, which are arbitrary 
counts of symptoms and their severity. These are measures rarely used by clinicians because 
they are tedious to obtain by interview. They are intermediate measures suspended between 
biomarkers, which can prove a drug has had the predicted pharmacological effect, and real 
outcomes relevant to patients (for example return to work). Real outcomes are too distal to 
provide sensitivity in a short clinical trial.

For all these reasons, caution is required in extrapolating the results of such trials to practice, 
whether or not presented as a meta-analysis.

Independent trials have often been less well-resourced and small scale, but may lack the 
stigma attaching to industry sponsorship. The results of such trials have the potential to be 
very misleading due to the whole range of potential biases. However, where quality is 
maintained and sample size is reasonable, they can offer important independent support to 
prove efficacy. They may also recruit patients in a less distorted way than commercial 
clinical research organizations and so generalize more convincingly. Positive studies of this 
kind have been particularly important in shaping some of our recommendations (e.g. the use 
of lithium and lamotrigine).

One final consideration is that when small trials are negative, caution is required in claiming 
that the trial proves lack of efficacy: underpowered studies by definition run a high risk of 
type II statistical error.

In conclusion, RCTs provide an important evidence base for all medical practice. Effect 
sizes in psychiatry, in common with the rest of medicine, are moderate (Leucht et al., 2012) 
but deliver worthwhile patient benefit. Nihilism about the results of RCTs should be 
avoided. However, RCTs are essentially experiments; their results are most plausible when 
confirmed by large scale, independent, pragmatic RCTs conducted in real world patient 
samples. There are few examples of such trials in psychiatry. More relevant currently are 
pharmaco-epidemiological studies using quasi-experimental designs. In such studies patients 
can act as their own controls before, during and after treatment, patient numbers can be very 
large and observation periods can be long. Furthermore, the measured outcomes can be 
objective and highly clinically relevant: admission to hospital, suicide, acts of violence etc. 
Such studies are crucial in supporting our recommendations for the long-term use of drugs 
in bipolar disorder.

Psychotherapy trials

Psychotherapy trials pose difficulties for evidence-based practice that have not been 
sufficiently recognized. The choice of a fair comparison treatment is much more challenging 
than for medicines. It is often simply ducked by using a poorly specified ‘treatment as usual’ 
(TAU) condition. While this may be defensible in a pragmatic study of effectiveness, it 
creates problems of interpretation for a proof of concept or efficacy study. If, as is 
commonly the case, the active treatment is superior to TAU, no specificity can be claimed 
for its content. The alternative ‘waiting list’ control group is also problematic because any 
superiority for an active treatment may be due to (or amplified by) a waiting list’s expected 
nocebo effect. Hence, many positive trials of particular therapies are pseudo-specific, in the 
sense that we do not know what elements of the psychotherapy are actually effective.

The collection of ‘adverse reactions’ to psychological treatment also appears to be 
unsystematic and hence under-appreciated (Nutt and Sharpe, 2008).

These inherent problems require an approach to refining best practice based on meticulous 
trial design and execution and sequential refinement of the psychotherapy content. 
Biomarkers or more experimental designs could also inform treatment development in 
psychotherapy trials (Button and Munafo, 2015). Unfortunately, development funding is

often not available in the way that is taken for granted for the development of new drugs by 
industry.

As a corollary of limited funding, psychotherapy trials are often small scale and suffer from 
all the disadvantages of similar, independent trials of medicines. Moreover, psychotherapy 
trials may be particularly subject to allegiance bias. This will mean that investigators are 
heavily invested professionally in showing that ‘their’ treatment works. This may 
consciously or unconsciously influence how trials are designed, treatments delivered and 
results described. It can also influence how results are analysed, if statistical methods are not 
pre-specified. Publication in a high profile journal or endorsement in a guideline will 
increase the demand for workshops and training that may remunerate a provider personally, 
and will be used to demonstrate impact by their employing institution. Thus, declaration of 
interest should be taken seriously in the publication of psychosocial interventions (Dragioti 
et al., 2015). Given a strong appetite from patients for psychological solutions, there is a 
prevailing pressure to reach positive but premature judgements.

Publication bias is objectively as important a problem for psychotherapy trials as for drug 
trials (Flint et al., 2015). However, there is not the safeguard that is provided by the formal 
disclosure of negative studies in the regulation of drug treatments.

Meta-analysis cannot resolve uncertainty where the methodology of the individual RCTs is 
flawed. In the case of bipolar disorder, the paucity of research in psychological and 
psychosocial treatments is as regrettable as for the other domains of treatment. Future 
studies that can avoid the mistakes of the past and present can therefore be enthusiastically 
anticipated. For now, we have favoured caution in interpreting the findings from trials of 
psychosocial interventions. Just as for drug treatments, more large-scale data with harder 
outcomes (admission to hospital, offending) would be very welcome, but is not currently 
available.

Relapse prevention trial designs

These studies are required by The European Medicines Agency (EMA) as proof of 
continuing efficacy for drugs shown to be effective in short-term studies of acute illness. 
They offer a further proof of acute efficacy since they take patients who have recovered 
while taking a particular active treatment and randomize to continue that treatment or be 
switched to placebo. If patients on placebo relapse to the same pole as the index episode, 
this is taken as further evidence that the drug worked acutely.

If these studies are extended over one or even two years, there must be a point at which we 
can infer further that the drug-placebo difference represents prevention of new episodes. 
Since there is no clear discontinuity in the boundary between preventing relapse of the 
original episode and the prevention of new episodes, perhaps they are essentially different 
sides of the same coin? Relapse prevention studies have been interpreted in that way in 
previous BAP guidelines. However, it is recognized that much of the difference between 
active treatment arms and placebo are due to early events, and dropout rates tend to be very 
high. Retention of patients in a 1-2 year study may be as low as 10%. Hence, interpretation 
of such studies, except in relation to acute efficacy may be questionable.

It may also be objected that such studies are ‘enriched’ with patients who have preferentially 
responded to the drug under investigation. Clearly this is true, but in actual practice this may 
often reflect the clinical question a psychiatrist asks: what will happen if I discontinue the 
drug? Knowing that there will be a risk of relapse is useful and informs clinical practice. 
This is really the only experimental evidence that supports the belief that what gets patients 
well will often keep them well. Relapse prevention studies underline that lesson, and offer us 
more safety data than are available in acute studies.

Finally, the definition of relapse in relapse prevention studies requires care. Acute 
withdrawal of a drug may lead to subjective changes and effects on sleep, which are often 
the mirror image of adverse reactions to taking the drug (for example vivid dreams after 
withdrawal of drugs that suppress REM sleep). Withdrawal reactions of this kind by 
definition immediately follow drug discontinuation and are relatively transient. However, in 
theory, withdrawal effects could be mistaken for relapse; if so, this must result in an excess 
of cases of very early relapse which are artefactual. Studies in which such an effect is 
observed are very difficult to interpret. More subtly, such effects could lead to unblinding 
and bias the assessment of patients later in the course of follow up.

On the other hand, drug withdrawal effects may also trigger an excess of true cases of early 
relapse compared with untreated patients. At present such an effect has only been 
convincingly shown with lithium, where it is a clinically important phenomenon (Suppes et 
al., 1991; Goodwin, 1994)). In theory, such effects might be more likely with those 
treatments that most modify the risk of relapse and act most proximal to the brain 
mechanisms involved in, for example, the onset of mania.

NICE2014 effectively discounted much of the longer term data generated by relapse-
prevention studies. In contrast, we accept them for what they are while recognizing their 
limitations. Further where randomized data and high quality naturalistic data support the 
same the conclusions, then those findings are likely to be of particular validity and should 
clearly influence treatment recommendations.

Choice of treatment and network meta-analysis

We are impressed by the power of network meta-analysis for understanding treatment 
efficacy and we will refer to such analyses in supporting the use of medicines to treat 
different aspects of bipolar disorder. The principle is to use all the available data that meets 
quality standards and include all trials where medicines are compared directly or indirectly 
via a common comparator (often placebo) (Cipriani et al., 2013b). This can identify when a 
data set is internally consistent (A beats B, B beats C, so A should also beat C). Where there 
is consistency between comparisons with placebo on one hand, and active comparators on 
the other, it is less likely that effects have been biased by unblinding. In our view, this is 
probably the most important current test that RCTs are indeed reliable and provide a secure 
evidence base for clinical decision making. In GRADE terminology, a coherent network 
supports strong ranking for treatment recommendations based on RCTs; a sparse or unstable 
network does not.

Network meta-analysis can also provide a kind of league table to rank different medicines 
against each other (and against placebo). Such findings have strongly influenced the NICE 
recommendations for the treatment of mania and depression. However, confidence intervals 
around the rankings were wide. As we argue in the preceding paragraph, practice can be 
underpinned by the knowledge that the efficacy of the treatment choices has been 
established in RCTs with a coherent network. It does not follow that practice be dominated 
by evidence that one effective treatment is, on average, slightly better than another. In 
addition, extrapolating from average effects in RCTs and meta-analyses to what might work 
amongst a range of effective treatments in a given individual requires experience and 
judgement. Previous history of response, willingness to adhere to a treatment, potential 
benefits and risks given an individual’s personal situation all have a bearing on therapeutic 
outcome.

The key to success with individual patients is cautious but confident prescribing of adequate 
doses and monitoring of effects, both positive and negative. Moreover, drug choice is an 
important clinical freedom in developing treatment with the individual patient in relation to 
both efficacy and adverse reactions. While NICE2014 is at pains to emphasize the need to 
respect patient choice, as are we, they are less liberal in what choices they actually sanction.

Part 1. Guidelines

In making recommendations that will be of practical value to clinicians who treat patients 
with bipolar disorder, we stand on the consensus view of the evidence reviewed in the 
accompanying document. The clinical practice guideline developed by NICE2014, has also 
been considered. We have sometimes reached different conclusions. These differences result 
from different weights placed on the available evidence. Differences of opinion, of course, 
are most likely to occur when the evidence is less than compelling.

Along with grading of specific recommendations for a strategy or individual treatment, the 
guideline includes statements, the implications of which should also influence practice. The 
strength of the evidence is rated as in Table 1 (and may relate to RCTs or observational 
findings).

Currently, medication remains the key to successful practice for most patients in the long 
term. The objective is to achieve a personalized choice of medicine (effective and well 
tolerated), informed adherence and an understanding of illness course shared with the patient 
and all most involved in their care. This needs to be established as early as possible in 
patients who present with severe illness.

Fundamentals of Patient Management

1  Diagnosis

Clinicians should make accurate diagnoses of hypomania, mania and depression (Standard 
of Care, (S)). Individual episodes may display mixed features of the opposite pole (Category 
I evidence, (I)).

Consider the identification of the core symptoms of mania or depression against a check list 
as in DSM-5 to improve confidence in, and the reliability of diagnosis (S). There is a new 
requirement in DSM-5 for an observable increase in energy and activity in addition to 
subjective mood elevation for hypomania and mania. Practice may also be made more 
comprehensive with a patient-completed screening instrument (Category IV evidence, (IV)).

Failure to use some form of structured record increases the likelihood that bipolar disorder 
will be missed and/or confused with another diagnosis (Category II evidence, (II)).

The term hypomania should be used as defined in DSM-5, where it is confined to elated 
states WITHOUT significant functional impairment (S).

Be careful not to dismiss or minimize mood elevation when it is the cause of disturbed 
behavior; personality problems or situational disturbance should be invoked only if mania 
(or hypomania) is absent (IV).

Bipolar patients may present with depression, especially in adolescence (I). Ask about a 
history of distinct periods of elated, excited or irritable mood of any duration and a family 
history of mania in all patients with depression (S).

Anxiety disorders are highly co-morbid with bipolar disorder (I) from a lifetime perspective. 
Anxiety symptoms are often persistent between episodes and may contribute to mood 
instability (I).

Anxiety disorders are associated with increased illness burden and poor outcome (I): they 
require assessment and treatment (S).

Stimulant drugs may mimic manic symptoms (II). A drug-induced state, including 
psychosis, should wane with the clearance of the offending drug (II): use 5 half-lives as the 
relevant interval (and the longest half-life stated in a range). Levodopa and corticosteroids 
are the most common prescribed medications associated with secondary mania (I).

More commonly, alcohol and/or drug use is co-morbid with manic or depressive mood 
change (I). The mood state will then significantly outlast the drugged state and a diagnosis 
of bipolar disorder can be made (S).

Borderline personality disorder is an important diagnosis that may either be confused with or 
be co-morbid with bipolar disorder. Reliable diagnosis of either condition can only be 
achieved by using operational criteria properly (S).

Organic conditions, such as thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis or any lesion(s) involving 
right-sided sub-cortical or cortical areas may be associated with secondary mania (II) and 
should be considered in the differential diagnosis (S). These conditions are most likely to 
occur in the elderly (I).

The diagnosis of bipolar disorder in childhood has been controversial. The narrow definition 
of the condition, now endorsed in DSM-5 and described in the latest NICE guideline 
(NICE2014), recognizes unequivocal euphoria and an episodic course as the defining

characteristics in pre-pubertal children (S). One should not make the diagnosis in children or 
young people unless there has been a period of prospective longitudinal monitoring by 
appropriately experienced clinicians taking into account the child or young person’s 
educational and social functioning (S).

Within many child and adolescent services, bipolar disorder may well be missed and the 
challenge is to enhance its recognition. The approach to diagnosis in children is poorly 
operationalized: diagnostic instruments are available that could aid clinical practice (II).

The so-called broad bipolar phenotype of childhood has been replaced by a new diagnosis in 
DSM-5: disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). This is not a bipolar diagnosis 
and is likely to be rather common in comparison with bipolar disorder, which is rare in 
prepubescent children (I).

Following puberty, the familiar adult criteria can be used with increasing confidence (IV).

Bipolar symptoms such as irritability or aggression may appear, with the benefit of 
hindsight, to be misdiagnosed by clinicians when a patient is first seen (I). In fact, diagnosis 
can only be reliable after a clear-cut episode of (hypo)mania (S).

2  Access to services and the safety of the patient and others

Specialized services for bipolar patients of all ages have not been a priority for the NHS, and 
so provision is variable and too often poor (IV).

Early intervention is a highly desirable objective in the management of young people with 
bipolar disorder (S). There are numerous systemic barriers to its provision and development 
in UK services (IV). This is an urgent problem.

When mania is diagnosed, always consider admission to hospital or intensive community 
management (S). The particular risks to the patient and others will be the result of poor 
judgment and associated actions in areas of work, personal relationships, alcohol/drug use, 
spending, driving and sexual activity (I).

Always try to obtain third party information if in any doubt when making a risk assessment 
(S).

When any patient is in a mixed state or depressed, ask about suicidal ideation, intention to 
act on these ideas and extent of plans, means or preparation for suicide (S). Social isolation, 
substance use, psychosis (especially with command hallucinations), personality disorder, 
family history of suicide, recent exposure to suicide and any prior suicide attempts may all 
increase the risk (I).

The increased incidence of completed suicide soon after an assessment in bipolar patients 
(I), suggests that current practice may under-estimate suicide risk (IV).

Bipolar patients may be vulnerable to exploitation or violence when in an abnormal mental 
state, which may make admission more desirable (IV). The risk of violence and offending

more generally (by the patient) is also increased in bipolar disorder (I) and assessment 
should address this risk (S).

Carefully document your decisions in formulating a care plan (S).

The fractionation of clinical services, for example between in and out patients, ‘assessment’ 
and ‘treatment’ runs counter to the needs of bipolar patients in all stages of their treatment 
but particularly in managing follow up (IV). Premature discharge to primary care can further 
dilute the treatment package available in the early stages of managing the illness (IV).

3  Enhanced care

a)  Establish and maintain a therapeutic alliance—A doctor should take 
responsibility for diagnosis, physical examination, investigations and explanation of the 
medical plan of management (S). Communicate clearly and honestly what you think (S). 
Take the time to listen to what is bothering the patient (S).

Very disorganized psychotic patients with bipolar disorder will have social needs that merit 
assertive management (IV).

b)  Educate the patient and his or her family about the disorder—Doctors, 
patients and carers tend to bring different experiences and beliefs to the therapeutic 
relationship (II) and make different estimates of future risks. Make use of evidence to 
address poor insight, the seriousness of the illness, reluctance to give up the experience of 
hypomania or mania, the risk of relapse and the benefit of therapeutic engagement (II).

c)  Enhance treatment adherence—Treatment adherence is often poor, particularly in 
younger patients early in the illness course (I).

While respecting patient preferences, education about the illness after an acute episode 
should include information on the potential benefits and risks of medication and emphasize 
the need to continue on it long-term (S).

The known tolerability and safety of available medicines should guide prescribing: inform 
patients about possible adverse reactions and monitor their possible emergence (S). Make 
the reduction of adverse reactions a priority - by using different scheduling (e.g. by 
prescribing all sedative medicines at bed time), alternative formulations or lower dosages 
(Category III evidence, (III)). Patience may be required to establish that lower doses are 
effective (IV).

d)  Promote awareness of stressors, sleep disturbance, early signs of 
relapse, and regular patterns of activity—Sleep disruption is often the final common 
pathway triggering manic episodes and is also associated with depression: stressors that lead 
to reduced sleep may contribute to relapse (II).

Regular patterns of daily activities should be promoted (II). Identify and try to modify 
habitual, very irregular patterns of activity, which are common in patients with bipolar 
disorder: consider using diaries or apps to self-monitor mood or activities (III).

Since alcohol and drug use are associated with a poor outcome, they require assessment, 
appropriate advice and treatment (S).

Help the patient, family members, and significant others recognize emerging symptoms of 
manic or depressive episodes so that they may know when to request early intervention (S).

A consistent long-term flexible alliance between the patient, the patient’s family and key 
members of a psychiatric team, including an effective, appropriately trained psychiatrist, is 
the ideal arrangement for outpatient care. The input of family members may also enhance 
the patient’s treatment adherence (S).

e)  Evaluate and manage functional impairments—Full functional recovery seldom 
occurs within twelve weeks following the remission of mood symptoms (I). Advise the 
patient in scheduling respite from work or other responsibilities when necessary (S). 
Discourage major life decisions being made while in a depressive or manic state (S).

Patients may experience considerable difficulty performing at the level for which their 
education has prepared them (I). Manage patient expectations of their capacity to work (S).

Consider the needs of carers and children of patients with bipolar disorder: provide 
information about local or national support groups (S).

f)  Consider physical health in clinical assessment and treatment planning—
Bipolar patients have premature mortality, owing partly to cardiovascular disease (I). In large 
part this is driven by weight gain. Weight and other relevant risk factors should be monitored 
at least annually and treatment offered appropriately (S).

Consult BAP guideline on management of weight gain and metabolic disturbances 
associated with psychosis and antipsychotic drug treatment (S).

g)  Consider the use of alcohol and drugs (including caffeine)—The use of 
alcohol or drugs may be excessive. Quantify their consumption and discuss setting targets 
for reducing harm (S). Caffeine (in coffee and other drinks) may significantly disturb sleep 
and exacerbate anxiety symptoms in sensitive individuals (III).

h)  Consider risks for various adverse outcomes, including self harm, 
suicide, victimization, violence and criminality—Bipolar patients are at substantially 
increased risks of self harm, suicide, victimization, violence and criminality (I).

Risk factors whose modification could reduce the risks of suicide and criminal outcomes 
include comorbid drug and alcohol use disorders and illness severity (II).

i) 
Increase the focus of care planning in women of child-bearing potential—
The postpartum period is one of very high risk for relapse in women with bipolar disorder 
(I). Psychosis or mania is a particular risk for bipolar I disorder: it is increased further by a 
previous post-partum episode. Depression is a substantial risk for both bipolar I and II 
disorder. Women need to decide about using medication in pregnancy and during

at this time (S). See section on special situations below.

Treatment of Different Phases of Bipolar Illness

Prescribers should be aware of the limitations imposed by licences for different medicines 
and potential safety concerns documented in product descriptions (S). Marketing 
authorizations are primarily designed to limit the actions of companies, NOT clinicians. 
Accordingly, ‘Off label’ prescribing of licensed medicines is implied by some of the 
recommendations incorporated below. However, seek expert advice if unsure about the 
efficacy or safety of any individual medicine or its use in combination (S).

Residual symptoms predict eventual relapse (II), so the objective of short term treatment is 
remission of symptoms (S).

We have not specified doses in this section. See Annex for additional information about 
individual medicines and relevant Product Information Sheets.

1  Acute Manic Episodes

Choice of an initial treatment—Most patients with mania will require short-term 
treatment with medicine(s) in an appropriate clinical setting (I). The evidence from network 
meta-analysis of many RCTs is coherent and supports efficacy of a range of different 
medicines (I). Thus, comparisons in RCTs include many indirect (placebo) and direct 
comparisons; this reduces the risk that unblinding and other bias has significantly distorted 
the results in individual studies. Choice of medicine should respect the balance between the 
benefit of efficacy and the harm of short-term adverse reactions or adverse effects in an 
individual with mania.

No psychotherapy currently provides an alternative strategy for management.

a)  For patients not already taking long-term treatment for bipolar disorder—
For severe manic episodes, consider oral administration of a dopamine antagonist when 
seeking rapid anti-manic effect (****). Systematic comparison of data from clinical trials 
suggests that haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine are particularly effective in 
short-term reduction of symptoms. Valproate is an alternative treatment with less risk of 
adverse motor reactions but should not be used for women of child bearing potential because 
of its unacceptable risk to the foetus of teratogenesis and impaired intellectual development. 
Aripiprazole, other dopamine antagonists and partial agonists, carbamazepine and lithium 
are also options.

Where an agitated patient requires parenteral treatment to control behaviour without their 
full consent, the use of dopamine antagonists/partial agonists and GABA modulators 
(benzodiazepines) should follow established protocols (S). The lowest doses necessary 
should be used (S). Do not escalate the dose of dopamine antagonists simply to obtain a 
sedative effect (S).

For less ill, non-psychotic manic patients or for hypomania, treatment can be extrapolated 
from practice in mania (IV).

To promote sleep for agitated overactive patients in the short term, consider adjunctive 
treatment with GABA modulating drugs (***).

When possible, treatment selection should be guided by a patient’s previous experiences and 
preferences especially if expressed in the form of an advance directive under the Mental 
Capacity Act 2005 (S) or an advance statement.

Antidepressant drugs (i.e. drugs approved for the treatment of unipolar depression) should 
usually be tapered and discontinued in a manic episode (**).

If successful treatment has been initiated for mania, long-term treatment should be 
considered (see below) (S).

b)  For patients who suffer a manic episode while taking long-term treatment
—If the current presentation is due to inadequate symptom control, ensure that the highest 
well-tolerated dose of the current treatment is offered (S). For a dopamine antagonist or 
partial agonist, or valproate raising the dose may be sufficient to control manic symptoms 
(IV).

For lithium, check whether serum concentrations are within the usual target range; consider 
aiming for a higher serum concentration within the target range (0.6 - 0.8 mmol/l (or mEq/
l)); concentrations of 0.8-1.0 mmol/l may be more effective but carry a greater risk of harm 
if continued long term (I).

If the patient is taking lithium, consider adding a dopamine antagonist or partial agonist, or 
valproate, as in a) above (****). In general, follow the same principles as for a first episode 
or an episode occurring off short-term treatment.

If the current episode is due to poor adherence, establish the cause and offer appropriate 
intervention (S). For example, if non-adherence is associated with an adverse reaction, 
consider dose reduction, assuming the adverse effect is dose related, or a switch to a more 
tolerable alternative regimen. If poor adherence is deliberate, and not related to tolerability, 
use of lithium long term may not be indicated due to the risk of ‘withdrawal’ mania and 
depression (I).

c) 
If symptoms are inadequately controlled with optimized doses of the first-
line medicine and/or mania is very severe, add another medicine—Consider the 
combination of lithium or valproate with a dopamine antagonist/partial agonist (****).

Consider clozapine in more refractory illness (**).

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for patients whose mania is particularly 
severe or treatment-resistant, those who express a preference for ECT and patients with 
severe mania during pregnancy (***).

d)  The presence of mixed features in a manic or hypomanic episode—DSM-5 
encourages the identification of mixed features rather than a ‘mixed episode’ (as in DSM-
IV). The implications for treatment are uncertain. Existing data from secondary analysis of 
trials for mixed episodes, suggest that treatment as for mania is appropriate (I).

e)  Assess contribution of substance use to a manic or hypomanic episode 
and consider if medically assisted withdrawal is required (S)

f)  Discontinuation of short-term treatments—Drug discontinuation should be 
planned in relation to the need for long-term maintenance treatment (S). Many medicines 
shown to be effective for the treatment of mania have also been shown to be effective in 
relapse prevention (I).

Medicines only used for the acute treatment of mania, may be reduced in dose and 
discontinued (tapering over four weeks or more) after full remission of symptoms has been 
achieved (IV). Remission will often occur within three months (I) but mood stability may 
require six months or more to achieve.

Any medication used adjunctively for symptomatic effect to promote sleep or sedation 
should be discontinued as soon as symptoms improve (S).

2  Acute Depressive episode

The evidence from network meta-analysis of available RCTs supports the efficacy of a 
limited range of individual medicines with different pharmacology and different weights of 
evidence. In particular, there is uncertainty (and difference of opinion) over the option of 
choosing antidepressants (i.e. drugs shown to be effective in major depressive episodes with 
a unipolar course) (IV).

Most of the evidence concerns patients with a bipolar I illness course; however, 
extrapolation to bipolar II disorder appears logical (IV).

a)  For patients not already taking long-term treatment for bipolar disorder—
Consider quetiapine, lurasidone or olanzapine (***). Dopamine antagonists have the 
inherent advantage of being anti-manic treatments (I).

Antidepressants (meaning drugs for a major depressive episode in a unipolar illness course) 
have not been adequately studied in bipolar disorder. Only the combination of fluoxetine 
with olanzapine has support as a specific treatment (***). The common use of other 
antidepressants in patients with bipolar disorder is an extrapolation from effects established 
in a unipolar illness course. When considered, they should be co-prescribed with a drug for 
mania (e.g. dopamine antagonists, lithium, valproate) in patients with a history of mania (S).

Consider initial treatment with lamotrigine, with the necessary incremental dosing schedule, 
usually as an addition to agents preventing recurrence of mania (****).

Consider ECT for patients with high suicidal risk, treatment resistance, psychosis, severe 
depression during pregnancy or life-threatening inanition (***). Consider simplifying pre-

existing polypharmacy, which may have raised the seizure threshold. It is very unusual for 
ECT to be used under mental health legislation without a patient’s consent; fears that this 
may occur should be allayed

When depressive symptoms are less severe, and despite limited evidence, lithium may be 
considered, especially as a prelude to long-term treatment (**).

Consider family-focused, cognitive behavior therapy or interpersonal rhythm therapy as an 
additional treatment, when available, since these may shorten the acute episode (**).

b)  For patients who suffer a depressive episode while taking long-term 
treatment—Ensure that the current choice of long-term treatments is likely to protect the 
patient from manic relapse (e.g. lithium, valproate, dopamine receptor antagonist/partial 
agonist drugs), by checking adequate doses of medicines and/or serum concentrations of 
lithium within the usual target range (S). Address current stressors, if any (S).

If the patient fails to respond to optimization of long-term treatment, and especially if 
depressive symptoms are significant, initiate treatment as above. See also section on 
treatment-resistant depression below.

c)  Choice of drug for a depressive episode—Treatment preference cannot be 
securely based on the current database of RCTs (IV). The available network meta-analyses 
may not be stable because rankings are strongly influenced by inclusion criteria and indirect 
comparisons sometimes contradict the findings from direct comparisons.

There is a risk of a switch to mania or mood instability during treatment for depression (I). 
While this will often reflect the natural history of the disorder, it may be increased by 
monotherapy with antidepressants. The dual action monoamine re-uptake inhibitors 
(venlafaxine, duloxetine, amitriptyline and imipramine)(II)) carry a greater risk of 
precipitating a switch to mania than single action drugs (especially selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors) (II).

Antidepressant drugs appear unlikely to induce mania when used in combination with a drug 
for mania (I).

In bipolar II disorder, if an antidepressant is prescribed as monotherapy, any increase in dose 
should be gradual and there should be vigilance for and early management of any adverse 
reactions such as hypomania, mixed states or agitation (IV).

In contrast to the common use of antidepressants, audit data suggest that lamotrigine is too 
little used outside specialist centres, given its efficacy in bipolar I, and suitability for bipolar 
II disorder.

If successful treatment has been initiated for depression de novo in a bipolar illness course, 
long-term treatment should be considered (see below) (S).

d)  Tapered discontinuation of antidepressant drugs may be considered after 
full remission of symptoms (IV)—Depressive episodes that remit in bipolar disorder

tend to be shorter than in unipolar disorder (I); in the absence of strong data for maintenance 
efficacy, consider discontinuation of antidepressants after as little as twelve weeks in 
remission (*).

Longer treatment with antidepressants is justified if patients relapse on their withdrawal 
(IV).

e)  Treatment of resistant depression—Relative or even marked treatment resistance 
may occur in depressed bipolar patients (I). This would mean failure to respond not just to 
an antidepressant but also quetiapine, olanzapine, lurasidone and lamotrigine singly and in 
combination. There is very little information from trials on the treatment of such refractory 
bipolar patients. ECT is an option (***). Augmentation strategies may be translated from 
experience in unipolar patients (*; see BAP guideline on the use of antidepressants: 
Management when initial treatment fails), but not before evidence-based bipolar options 
have been exhausted. Adequate anti-manic cover with lithium, valproate or a dopamine 
antagonist/partial agonist will be necessary (S).

Choice of initial treatment: psychosocial treatments

There is very little evidence of efficacy of psychological treatments alone (without 
pharmacotherapy) in the treatment of acute bipolar depression.

Recommendations for psychotherapy alone (as in NICE2014, for example) are surprising 
and based on very low quality data (*). More evidence is needed that this is really an 
effective approach (IV).

3  Long-term treatment

a)  Prevention of new episodes—Consider long-term treatment following a single 
severe manic episode (i.e. diagnosis of bipolar I disorder) (***).

However, without active acceptance of the need for long-term treatment, adherence may be 
poor (I). Consider a wider package of treatment offering enhanced psychoeducation, 
motivational and family support especially in the early stages of illness to promote 
behaviour change and adherence to medication (***).

When a patient has accepted treatment for several years and remains well, they should be 
advised to continue indefinitely, because the risks of relapse remain high (***).

Consider extrapolating the advice for bipolar I to bipolar II disorder, given increasing 
evidence for common efficacy from clinical trials (**).

b)  Options for long-term treatment—At present the preferred strategy is for 
continuous rather than intermittent treatment with oral medicines to prevent new mood 
episodes. The network meta-analysis of available RCTs with relapse prevention designs 
support the efficacy of a limited range of individual medicines with different pharmacology 
and different weights of evidence: lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone LAI (long 
acting injection) and valproate (albeit marginally) prevented manic relapse. Only

lamotrigine, lithium and quetiapine were convincingly shown to prevent depressive relapse. 
Lurasidone also prevents relapse to depression.

Relatively few patients remain in such trials for as long as 6 months, but lithium is 
exceptional in having strong evidence for relapse prevention from RCTs in which patients 
were not enriched for an acute response to lithium (I).

Most of the evidence concerns patients with a bipolar I illness course; however, 
extrapolation to bipolar II disorder appears logical (IV).

Short-term add ons (e.g. GABA modulators or dopamine antagonists/partial agonists) are 
necessary when an acute stressor is imminent or present, early symptoms of relapse 
(especially insomnia) are present or anxiety becomes prominent (IV). Consider supplying 
these medicines prospectively to patients with instructions how to use at their discretion (*). 
Higher doses of long-term treatments may also be effective, instead of add-ons (*).

Since the optimum long-term treatment strategy is not established, clinicians and patients are 
encouraged to participate in clinical trials designed to answer key therapeutic questions (S).

c)  Choice of long-term medicines—In addition to the relapse prevention RCTs, 
naturalistic data, allowing comparison of rates of hospital admission on and off treatment 
over four years, are strongly supportive of efficacy for lithium> 
valproate>olanzapine>lamotrigine>quetiapine>carbamazepine (I).

Consider lithium as initial monotherapy (****).

Lithium monotherapy is effective against both manic, depressive and mixed relapse (I), has 
better evidence for prevention of new episodes than other agents (I) and a more substantial 
evidence base documenting the risks of prolonged exposure (I). Lithium is associated with a 
reduced risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder in RCTs and in both self harm and 
suicide in observational studies (I).

Biochemical monitoring of lithium treatment, including plasma lithium concentrations, is a 
standard of care (S); the target range is 0.6-0.8 mmol/l. Lithium concentrations above 0.8 
mmol/l are associated with an increased risk of renal impairment especially in women (I).

Clinicians should know that NICE2014 recommended monitoring lithium concentrations at 
3 monthly intervals for the first year of treatment in otherwise healthy patients, and 6 
monthly thereafter (S).

Consider other options if lithium is ineffective, poorly tolerated or if patients are unlikely to 
be adherent: valproate, dopamine antagonists/partial agonists (S).

Valproate is often accorded an equivalent place to lithium as a ‘mood stabilizer’. It has a 
weaker evidence base from RCTs, but upgraded naturalistic data supports its position ahead 
of other options (I). Safety concerns in women have already been noted.

Additional evidence for efficacy of specific treatments comes, as already indicated, from 
trials in which patients have responded favourably to a particular medication in an acute 
indication. Accordingly, in an individual patient, if a medicine leads to prompt remission 
from the most recent manic or depressive episode, this may be considered evidence in favour 
of its long-term use as monotherapy (IV). Because effective in the short term, this may lead 
to preferential use of dopamine antagonists; active consideration of lithium as a better 
alternative should be promoted (IV).

Carbamazepine is less effective in maintenance treatment than lithium but may sometimes 
be used as monotherapy if lithium is ineffective and especially in patients who do not show 
the classical pattern of episodic euphoric mania (II). It appears to be almost exclusively 
effective against manic relapse (I). Be aware of the pharmacokinetic interactions that are a 
particular problem with carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine may be considered by extrapolation 
because of its lower potential for such interactions (I).

Consider long acting (“depot”) formulations if prophylaxis against recurrence of mania is 
required and adherence to oral medication is erratic or injection preferred (**). Various long-
acting injectable (LAI) dopamine antagonist/partial agonists are available, including 
fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, olanzapine pamoate, risperidone 
microspheres, paliperidone palmitate, and aripiprazole monohydrate. Only risperidone has 
RCT support (II). Use of other options will represent extrapolation from oral efficacy or 
class effect of dopamine antagonists/partial agonists and clinical experience (IV).

Lamotrigine and quetiapine may be considered as monotherapy in bipolar II disorder (***). 
In bipolar I disorder, lamotrigine will usually require combination with an antimanic long-
term agent (IV).

If the patient fails to respond to monotherapy and continues to experience 

d) 
sub-threshold depressive symptoms or relapses, consider long term 
combination treatment (GRADE: variable for different combinations)—When the 
burden of disease is mania, it may be logical to combine two predominantly anti-manic 
agents (e.g. lithium, valproate, a dopamine antagonist or a dopamine partial agonist) (IV). 
When the burden is depressive, a combination of lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone 
or olanzapine may be more appropriate (IV).

The role of antidepressants in long-term treatment is not established by controlled trials; 
nevertheless they appear to be used effectively in a minority of patients in the long term (**).

Consider continuation of clozapine if effective in refractory mania (**).

Maintenance ECT may be considered for patients who respond to ECT during an acute 
episode but respond poorly to all oral agents (*).

Consider adjunctive psychotherapy to address subthreshold symptoms (**; see (h)).

If rapid cycling poses particular long-term management problems—Identify 

e) 
and treat conditions such as hypothyroidism or substance use that may contribute to cycling 
(**).

Consider tapering and discontinuing antidepressants that may contribute to cycling (*).

There are no specific treatments for rapid cycling. As an often disabling expression of 
bipolar disorder, many patients require combinations of medicines. Evaluate anti-cycling 
effects over periods of 6 months or more by tracking mood states longitudinally. Discontinue 
ineffective treatments to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy (*).

f)  Discontinuation of long-term treatment—Following discontinuation of 
medicines, the risk of relapse remains, even after years of sustained remission (II). 
Accordingly, if discontinuation is considered, it should be accompanied by an informed 
assessment of the potential dangers (S).

Discontinuation of any medicine should normally be tapered over at least 4 weeks and 
preferably longer (S). Early relapse to mania is an early risk of abrupt lithium 
discontinuation (I).

Discontinuation of medicines should not lead to withdrawal of services to patients; short-
term care and monitoring will still be required if medication is discontinued together with a 
management plan to recognise and treat early warning signs of future relapse to mania or 
depression (S).

h)  Specific psychosocial interventions—Psychosocial interventions may enhance 
care, reduce subthreshold symptoms and reduce risk of relapse (II). Psychoeducation is a 
component of good clinical practice, because clinical communication cannot be effective 
without it (S); it is formally supported by manualized approaches tested formally in clinical 
trials (****).

A number of differently named therapies (Family focused therapy, Cognitive behavior 
therapy, Interpersonal Social Rhythm therapy) have also been studied in relapse prevention. 
It is striking that they share many elements with each other and with psychoeducation. 
Psychological interventions appear to be more successful with patients early in their illness 
course (I).

The functional impairments of bipolar patients may merit cognitive and functional 
remediation strategies (II).

User groups can provide useful support and information about bipolar disorder and its 
treatment (IV).

4  Treatment of alcohol use disorder

See BAP’s Evidence based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance 
abuse, harmful use, addiction and co-morbidity. In heavy drinkers, modest reductions in 
consumption may result in substantial health gains (I).

Offer naltrexone or nalmefene as part of a behavioural programme to help patients reduce 
their alcohol consumption (**).

Offer acamprosate if naltrexone has not been effective to help patients remain abstinent (*).

Consider disulfiram if patient wants abstinence and if acamprosate and naltrexone have 
failed. The patient must be able to understand the risks of taking disulfiram and have their 
mood monitored (*).

5  Treatment of co-morbid borderline personality disorder

In co-morbid patients both disorders may require treatment. Hence, avoid a polarizing 
choice between medication (usually required for bipolar disorder) and psychological 
treatment (the preferred approach to borderline problems) (S).

In the absence of relevant evidence, there is no reason to withdraw or withhold appropriate 
treatment for bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder. Although the place of 
pharmacotherapy for borderline symptoms is based on limited evidence, the shared symptom 
of mood instability may be appropriately treated by medicines (e.g. lamotrigine, lithium, 
olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole and quetiapine) and borderline symptoms improved (*).

6  Treatment of anxiety and other co-morbid disorders

Consider treatment along the lines suggested by BAP guidelines for the treatment of anxiety 
disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders (*). Care in the 
use of antidepressants is required (S).

7  Treatment in special situations

In children and young people

For mania: Consider aripiprazole as first line because it is licensed in adolescents (over 13 
years) with bipolar I disorder (***). Otherwise refer to adult recommendations; there is 
some primary evidence that olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone are efficacious in 
adolescents (**).

Refer to the British National Formulary (BNF) for Children to modify drug doses (S). Be 
aware of the increased potential for a range of adverse reactions, particularly weight gain 
(S).

For bipolar depression: Consider medicines and psychological treatments largely by 
extrapolation from data in adults (*).

Drugs for depression may induce switch to mania more frequently in children and young 
people than adults (II).

The need for long-term treatment should be considered in young people because of the 
potentially disruptive effect of relapse and mood instability on cognitive and emotional 
development (S).

In elderly people—Consider lower doses of psychotropic medicines of all classes for all 
phases of treatment when adverse reactions or effects are evident with conventional dosing 
(check the SPC for prescribing recommendations) (*).

In women and pregnancy

Women who may become pregnant: There is a risk of teratogenicity from valproate and 
carbamazepine (I). The risk/benefit for valproate contraindicates its use in women of child 
bearing potential under normal circumstances (I).

Concerns about lithium and cardiac malformation appear to have been disproportionate (II).

Since as many as 50% of pregnancies currently occur unplanned, access to family planning 
advice should be ensured whenever feasible (S).

Women who are pregnant: Low or no risk of teratogenesis appears to be associated with 
dopamine antagonists/partial agonists, antidepressants, lamotrigine and lithium. However, 
risks from new compounds are usually unknown and always justify caution. Any teratogenic 
risk putatively associated with the use of medicines should be considered in the poorly 
appreciated context of a relatively high, age-related, baseline risk for congenital 
malformations and spontaneous abortion and confounding by indication (S).

Women are not protected from relapse by pregnancy. Discontinuation of medicines risks 
destabilising mood (IV). Hence, the possible risks of medicines to the foetus needs to be 
balanced with the risk of mental illness in the mother and its effects on the health of the baby 
(S).

Many psychotropic drugs used to treat bipolar disorder can cause neonatal symptoms (II & 
III). Neonates should be monitored for possible adverse reactions in the hours and days 
following birth (S)

Women are at high risk of relapse to mania or depression following childbirth (I). Vigilance 
is essential and effective prophylactic treatment should always be considered and usually 
recommended (S).

Adverse reactions attributed to maternal psychotropic medicines have been sporadically 
reported in breast-fed infants but the prevalence is unclear (III).

Women who continue to take psychotropic medication after childbirth should choose 
between breast and bottle feeding after a full explanation of the relevant benefits and harms 
(S). If a mother takes medication and breast feeds, the infant should be monitored for 
possible adverse reactions (S).

There are regular reports of adverse outcomes in the development of the children of women 
treated with antidepressants or other psychotropic drugs. Too often such studies appear 
inadequately controlled for confounding by indication. Accordingly, claims that drugs used 
in pregnancy cause adverse behavioural outcomes should be treated cautiously.

DSM-5 criteria provide the appropriate schema for diagnosis of Bipolar 
Disorder. DSM-5 mania defines bipolar I Disorder (S).

Hypomania is not associated with significant functional impairment. With 
major depression, a history of hypomania defines bipolar II disorder (S).

Hypomania and mania apparently precipitated by antidepressants or 
stimulants does not disallow the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (IV).

Incidence per lifetime is, together, about 1% for bipolar I and 
conservatively defined DSM-5 bipolar II disorder (I). Other Specified 
Bipolar and Related Disorders add a further 2-3% of bipolar diagnoses in 
adults.

Bipolar I disorder is highly heritable (up to 80%) and caused by many 
common genetic variations of small effect.

Bipolar I disorder (mania) occurs rarely in pre-pubertal children, but its 
improved diagnosis in children and young adults is an important 
priority(S).

Relapse in bipolar I and bipolar II disorder occurs with a higher frequency 
than in unipolar depression (I).

The clinical presentation of major depression is similar for unipolar and 
bipolar patients. Suicide, deliberate self harm and violence are important 
risk outcomes across the life span for bipolar patients (I).

Anxiety disorders are the commonest co-morbid conditions in bipolar 
disorder (I) but are often missed or ignored (IV).

Alcohol use is common in bipolar disorder (I). Drug use is more relevant 
to younger patients with mania (I). Established addictive problems should 
be assessed and treated (S).

Delay in diagnosis occurs because the illness may start non-specifically, 
the diagnosis of mood elevation is missed or symptoms are attributed to 
substance use or personality disturbance (II).

There is an unexplained resistance on the part of some clinicians to 
diagnose bipolar disorder even when the syndrome of mania has clearly 
been present (IV).

Severity of mania, presence of psychotic features and mixed features may 
all influence outcome but are poorly characterised in relation to treatment 
response.

The diagnosis of hypomania in DSM-5 sets an arbitrary minimum time 
requirement of 4 days. Many more cases of ‘unipolar’ major depression 
appear to have had shorter periods of hypomania or simply hypomanic 
symptoms, so approaching or meeting criteria for ‘other Specified Bipolar 
and Related Disorders’.

DSM-5 encourages the use of ‘mixed feature’ specifiers for individual 
episodes to capture symptoms of the opposite pole of the illness. The 
relationship between MDD with mixed features and bipolar disorder is 
uncertain. It may be more common in the presence of co-morbid 
borderline personality disorder (II).

The mechanisms linking bipolar states to self harm or other violent acts 
(for example, impulsivity, disinhibition, inducing or exacerbating low 
mood via alcohol/drugs) are poorly understood.

DSM-5 has introduced a new syndrome (disruptive mood dysregulation 
disorder or DMDD) to capture a childhood syndrome, which may have 
nothing to do with bipolar disorder, but is classified as a mood disorder.

Reliable diagnosis was arguably the major achievement of the last century in psychiatry. It 
depends upon the use of operational criteria to define cases, and its most important 
framework is provided by DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and DSM-5 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). We will recommend DSM-5 criteria in this text. 
However, some of the changes in diagnostic sub-typing with specifiers will have uncertain 
implications for current treatments. We also recognize that in clinical practice the precise use 
of research criteria may be too exacting a standard. It is however, the standard to which we 
should aspire.

Reliability of diagnosis, especially for mania, is high under optimal conditions. The use of 
checklists and standardised interviews could ensure improved diagnosis under ordinary 
clinical conditions (Hiller et al., 1993). However, we recognize that field trials for DSM-5 
showed only average reliability for bipolar diagnoses (Freedman et al., 2013). Practice may 
also be made more comprehensive with a patient-completed screening instrument like the 
Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) (Hirschfeld et al., 2003), the Hypomania/Mania 
Symptom Checklist (HCL-32) (Meyer et al., 2007) or the Computerized Adaptive

Bipolar disorder is, at present, the most commonly used term to describe serial elevations of 
mood usually along with intercurrent depressions of mood. Descriptions consistent with 
Bipolar Disorder exist since antiquity but Kraepelin first used the term manic-depressive 
psychosis to include all cases of affective psychosis. Patients with unipolar, commonly 
psychotic depression were included in the diagnosis whether or not they had experienced 
mania. The central emphasis on mania and thus on bipolarity emerged relatively recently.

Bipolar I disorder is defined by episodes of mania and also, usually, depression. The 
incidence of bipolar I disorder is estimated between 2-21 per 100,000, per year. Differences 
in reported rates are probably due to the definition of cases. Differences based on first 
admissions to hospital, which is a proxy estimate of severity, show figures that are less 
variable and, on average, represent a rate of about 3-4 people per 100,000 per year. 
Incidence per life-time of bipolar disorder is approximately 0.5%-1% for Bipolar I disorder 
(I, (Angst and Sellaro, 2000; Lloyd and Jones, 2002; Merikangas et al., 2007)).

Bipolar II disorder is characterised by episodes of hypomania and, invariably, major 
depression. As defined by DSM-IV, its lifetime incidence has also been described as about 
1% (I, (Angst, 1998; Merikangas et al., 2007). This estimate depends on where the boundary 
between bipolar II and sub-threshold bipolarity is drawn. A figure nearer 0.5% may be more 
appropriate (Merikangas and Lamers, 2012) giving 1% as the figure for lifetime diagnosis if 
bipolar I and II combined.

Bipolar I disorder is prominent in secondary care because it is a highly prevalent rather than 
a highly incident condition. It follows a relapsing, often chronic course, with an average 8 
episodes over the 10 years following diagnosis. The rate of relapse is higher than that seen in 
unipolar disorder of comparable severity (I, (Winokur et al., 1993; Angst and Preisig, 
1995)).

The known aetiology of bipolar disorder is primarily genetic with estimated heritability as 
high as 0.93 (I, (Potash and DePaulo, 2000; Kieseppa et al., 2004)). This means it is one of 
the most heritable disorders in medicine. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have now 
been conducted on sufficiently large samples to give complete confidence in a growing 
number of specific genes. These small effects when combined can now account for about 
20% of the heritability (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics et al., 2013). 
Bipolar disorder is highly polygenic so leaving little room for causation by rare genes of 
large effect. Genetic effects are not susceptible to errors of reverse causation, otherwise 
common in observational epidemiological studies. Therefore, these positive findings confirm 
that the DSM diagnosis has some biological validity. However, there is clear evidence of 
overlap with risk genes for both schizophrenia and major depression. This genetic 
architecture was predicted by the elevated rates of bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, and 
psychosis in first-degree relatives of bipolar patients (Gershon et al., 1982). Compared with 
schizophrenia, there is weaker evidence for presumed environmental aetiologies such as 
obstetric complications or inner city residence (I, (Bain et al., 2000; Browne et al., 2000; 
Lloyd and Jones, 2002)).

Factors such as early abuse and neglect are elevated in bipolar disorder and increase the risks 
for other co-morbid psychiatric disorders; this probably worsens the course of bipolar illness 
(II, (Leverich et al., 2002)). Abuse and neglect are also associated with impairments of 
memory and executive function in bipolar patients (Savitz et al., 2008) and may increase the 
risk of psychosis (Read et al., 2005).

The overlap of risk genes for bipolar I disorder with those for ADHD is apparently 
negligible, even though current significant alleles account for about 20% of the risk of each

disorder separately (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics et al., 2013). This is 
perhaps the first example of where genetics may eventually guide psychiatric diagnosis (see 
below).

The differential diagnosis of elated states in Bipolar Disorder—Mania defines 
bipolar I disorder. DSM-IV criteria for mania, which form the basis for most of the studies 
cited in these guidelines, are as follows (American Psychiatric Association, 1994):

1

2

3

4

5

A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or 
irritable mood, lasting at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalisation is 
necessary).

During the period of mood disturbance, three (or more) of the following 
symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been 
present to a significant degree:

a.

b.

c.

d.

e.

f.

g.

inflated self-esteem or grandiosity

decreased need for sleep (e.g. feels rested after only 3 hours of 
sleep)

more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking

flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing

distractibility (i.e. attention too easily drawn to unimportant or 
irrelevant external stimuli)

increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, 
or sexually) or psychomotor agitation

excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high 
potential for painful consequences (e.g. engaging in unrestrained 
buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)

The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode.

The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in 
occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with 
others, or to necessitate hospitalisation to prevent harm or self or others, or 
there are psychotic features.

The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance 
(e.g. a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or a general medical 
condition (e.g. hyperthyroidism).

DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) has modified Criterion 1 by adding the 
requirement for increased activity/energy as a core symptom of mood elevation. This 
represents an effort to reduce over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder driven by subjective report, 
and increase specificity (Suppes et al., 2014).

The symptoms must be present for one week and/or require hospital admission. Most 
critically, the criteria include a judgement that function is impaired. Admission to hospital

obviously defines loss of function and autonomy quasi objectively. Less obvious impairment 
will require identification of failure in normal working and personal relationships and 
judgement. Intelligent patients may be very difficult to assess from this point of view 
without corroborating evidence from third parties. The contribution this makes to 
misdiagnosis will be considered below. This definition of mania underpins the distinction 
made between bipolar I disorder and milder elated subtypes. Psychotic mania is usually 
regarded as reflecting severity rather than a subtype. Thus, psychotic symptoms wax and 
wane within individual subjects and are not invariably present from one episode to another. 
As a rule, psychotic symptoms in mania are mood congruent and represent an extension of 
grandiose interpretations, paranoid ideation or heightened awareness. They are relatively 
common (McElroy et al., 1996; Dunayevich and Keck, 2000). However, in a study of over 
500 patients with mania, only 20% had a presentation dominated by psychosis (Sato et al., 
2002). This may mean that such symptoms can often be missed in routine clinical practice.

In a minority of cases, symptoms seem to be mood incongruent and in some cases this is 
diagnosed as schizo-affective disorder. Strictly defined schizo-affective disorder (according 
to DSM-IV and 5) is relatively uncommon in clinical samples because patients must meet 
diagnostic criteria for both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia simultaneously. It may also be 
unreliable (II, (Maj et al., 2000)). The meaning of a schizo-affective diagnosis also remains 
controversial. It may represent forms of illness in some sense intermediate between the two 
Kraepelinian psychosis types, so supporting the unity of psychotic states, or it may be the 
co-occurrence of the two different disorders (II, (Kendell, 1987; Kendell and Gourlay, 
1970)). Genetic findings are increasingly supportive of the former view (Craddock and 
Owen, 2010).

Although euphoric mania is the classic type of presentation, a significant number of cases of 
mania are far from euphoric and may have a mixture of different symptom dimensions. 
These dysphoric presentations require diagnostic expertise for detection. The most striking 
example is where patients meet the criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously as 
was required for the diagnosis of a mixed state in DSM-IV. However, some significant 
admixture of dysphoric (depressive) symptoms occurs in many manic episodes. Factor 
analyses of the symptoms of manic patients have been relatively consistent in suggesting 
that the atypical features of depressive mood, irritable aggression, and psychosis load on 
separate uncorrelated factors (II, (Cassidy et al., 1998; Sato et al., 2002)). This agreement 
suggests the potential to distinguish several relatively separate syndromes among manic 
patients. Subsequent analysis has confirmed that there are at least two mixed mania 
presentations. One has a dominant mood of severe depression with labile periods of 
pressured irritable hostility and paranoia, but a complete absence of euphoria or humour. 
The second has a true mixture of affects with periods of classical euphoria switching 
frequently to moderately depressed mood with anxiety and irritability (II, (Cassidy et al., 
2001)). These putative subtypes are not identified by existing diagnostic criteria and hence 
are not distinguished in treatment studies. The change in approach to mixed states in DSM-5 
is discussed below.

Severity of mania, presence of psychotic features and the admixture of depressive symptoms 
may all influence outcome but are also poorly characterised in relation to treatment

response. Future advice on acute treatment may take account of differential effects of 
medicines on the common symptom dimensions. However, at present, only severity, 
especially expressed as over-activity, imposes itself on current treatment options.

With DSM-5, it is now accepted that mania associated with antidepressant treatment should 
usually be regarded as defining bipolar disorder, except when the symptoms are reliably 
locked in time to exposure to a specific antidepressant, like other drug-induced psychoses as 
discussed below (IV, opinion of the consensus group).

The diagnosis of hypomania—Both the use of the term and the criteria for hypomania 
have been controversial. Its definition has been crucial to the diagnosis of elated states 
outside bipolar I disorder. DSM-IV recognised core symptoms of hypomania as a checklist 
like that for mania itself; DSM-5 has modified Criterion 1 by adding the requirement for 
increased activity/energy as a core symptom of mood elevation in line with its new definition 
of mania (see above). This is intended to make diagnosis more reliable, but will thereby 
exclude individuals with purely subjective experiences of mood elevation from a bipolar II 
diagnosis.

The time requirement is for four days of symptoms. Patients must display observable but not 
impaired change in function. This will include mood elevations and increases in energy that 
are often positively valued by individuals with bipolar disorder. In contrast ICD-10 chooses 
a slightly different set of symptoms and requires for hypomania, “some interference with 
personal functioning”. Essentially hypomania under this definition is mild mania and should 
not include DSM-5 cases of hypomania. ICD-10 hypomania contributes little but confusion 
to current classification because it tends to encourage the use of the term for frankly manic 
states (IV, (Goodwin, 2002)).

There is continuing interest in the extension of a bipolar diagnosis to a spectrum of cases 
with less severe elated states. Bipolar disorder NOS is a DSM-IV category that includes any 
of the following:(1) recurrent subthreshold hypomania in the presence of intercurrent major 
depression, (2) recurrent (at least two episodes) hypomania in the absence of recurrent major 
depression with or without subthreshold major depression, and (3) recurrent subthreshold 
hypomania in the absence of intercurrent major depression with or without subthreshold 
major depression. The number of required symptoms for a determination of subthreshold 
hypomania is confined to 2 criterion B symptoms (from the DSM-IV requirement of 3, or 4 
if the mood is only irritable) to retain the core features of hypomania in the subthreshold 
definition. DSM-5 has changed the ‘Bipolar NOS’ grouping to ‘Other Specified Bipolar and 
Related Disorder’ but covers the same still ill-defined group of disorders; they have a 2.4% 
community lifetime incidence (Merikangas et al., 2007).

In fact, on the basis of symptom endorsement over a life time in clinic samples, (Cassano et 
al., 2004) have suggested that mood elevation forms a continuous bridge between unipolar 
and bipolar disorder. The intensity of illness, either depressive or manic, increased in parallel 
and simply showed a higher baseline of elated experience for the bipolar group compared to 
the unipolar cases. If there is indeed no qualitative break between unipolar and bipolar

disorder, the question becomes one of calibration. At what point on this continuum of 
experience does mood elevation influence treatment choice?

DSM-5 has introduced the concept of a mixed features specifier (see below), which 
formalizes the identification of manic symptoms in depressive episodes (Angst et al., 2011). 
These proposed diagnoses still do not yet have clear implications for treatment. However, to 
call such cases bipolar would increase the temptation for treatment choices to be 
extrapolated from bipolar I/II data.

The differential diagnosis of depressed states in Bipolar Disorder—Major 
depression in the context of bipolar disorder is similar to major depression arising in a 
unipolar illness course, when severity is comparable. Within episodes of depression, grades 
of intensity – mild moderate and severe – should be distinguished. The use of a scale such as 
the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) or Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (QIDS), which maps to the diagnostic features, gives a severity estimate. 
The QIDS, in particular, is useful in its self-administered form (Rush et al., 2003).

Bipolar patients may be more likely to demonstrate psychomotor-retarded melancholic and 
atypical depressive features and to have had previous episodes of psychotic depression (II, 
(Mitchell et al., 2001)). Retarded or psychotic depression, particularly in young people, 
should raise the suspicion of a bipolar illness course. Indeed, there are a number of other 
clinical features suggesting a bipolar illness, such as ‘atypical’ depressive features 
(hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis), pathological guilt and lability of mood, 
but none can convey a categorical certainty. There may be scope for the development of such 
features as a measure of probability that an episode of depression is the manifestation of 
bipolar disorder in the absence of evidence of mood elevation (Mitchell et al., 2008).

Poor outcomes in bipolar disorder—Deliberate self harm and completed suicide are 
important risks in bipolar disorder and are associated with depression and mixed states (I, 
(ten Have et al., 2002; Black et al., 1987a)). For patients identified by admission to hospital, 
absolute rates of suicide are about 0.4% per year (Tondo et al., 2003). This is 20 fold greater 
than population rates and translates into risks at long term follow-up between 3-6% (I, 
(Chesney et al., 2014; Crump et al., 2013), which are amongst the highest for any psychiatric 
disorder. The increased odds of self harm and suicide compared with sibling controls, 
arguably a more relevant comparison, is still 6-8 fold (Webb et al., 2014).

The risk of violent and non-violent crime is also elevated in bipolar patients, especially 
males. The increase compared with sibling controls is 2-4 fold. This risk may not be as 
widely appreciated as the risk for suicide, but offending is actually a more common outcome 
and thus associated with a higher absolute risk. Rates of violent crime in male patients were 
8% and, for non-violent crime, 18% in one population cohort study, with most of these 
patients committing their crimes within 5 years of diagnosis (Webb et al., 2014).

Suicide has always received more attention than other adverse outcomes. The risk of suicide 
is highest early in the course of the illness (Hoyer et al., 2000). Suicide is independently 
associated with male gender, previous self harm, alcohol and drug use disorders, and

previous criminality (Webb, 2014). An early review identified hopelessness at index 
admission as another risk factor (Hawton et al., 2005). A longer list of possible contributory 
factors emerges from a broad review of the literature (Pompili et al., 2013); the contribution 
of individual risks is poorly quantified and many are likely to be confounded.

The lifetime prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour (self harm or attempted suicide) in 
those with bipolar disorder is approximately 30% (Chen and Dilsaver, 1996; Tondo et al., 
2003) and may be as high as 50% in secondary care samples (Valtonen et al., 2005). A 
recent Swedish population study estimated rates of hospital-presenting self harm at 10% in 
male patients and 14% in female patients (Webb et al., 2014). Studies have shown that a 
wider range of factors are associated with self harm than suicide itself, presumably because 
the former is a more common outcome. These factors include mixed states, rapid cycling, 
alcohol and drug use, comorbid anxiety, a positive family history of suicide, and, possibly, 
early abuse or a bipolar II diagnosis (Hawton et al., 2005; Schaffer et al., 2015). Bipolar 
patients have the highest rate of suicide of all psychiatric disorders. In addition, independent 
associations have been found for female gender, previous criminality, parental psychiatric 
disorders and low family income (Webb et al., 2014). Aggression and impulsivity may also 
be associated with suicide attempts (Oquendo et al., 2000; Oquendo et al., 2004).

Specifiers in DSM-5—DSM-5 has introduced a device to recognize the heterogeneity of 
episodes in bipolar disorder in the form of specifiers. These can be used with any primary 
diagnosis (mania, hypomania, depression) to enrich the clinical description.

The mixed features specifier—In DSM-IV, a mixed episode was defined as requiring 
the full syndrome of mania and major depression to be present simultaneously for at least 1 
week. In practice this proved to be a rare diagnosis, although it was widely recognized that 
symptoms from the opposite pole might be present in a bipolar episode: this has already 
been discussed above for mania. DSM-5 has dropped the category ‘mixed episode’ and 
introduced a new feature to the diagnosis of a primary manic, hypomanic or depressive 
episode: the mixed feature specifier. A specifier requires the presence of three symptoms 
from a list restricted to those symptoms unique to the pole in question. Thus a manic episode 
can be said to have mixed features (of depression) if there are three or more of subjective 
depression, worry, self-reproach/guilt, negative evaluation of self, hopelessness, suicidal 
ideation or behaviour, anhedonia, fatigue or psychomotor retardation.

The BRIDGE study of over 5000 adults with a major depressive episode identified 47.0% 
(95% CI, 45.7%-48.3%) as meeting the bipolarity specifier criteria. Associations (odds ratio 
> 2; P <.001) with bipolarity were observed for family history of mania/hypomania, multiple 
past mood episodes and comorbid substance use disorder (Angst et al., 2011).

This change may have important implications for clinical care, education, and research in 
the future (Vieta and Valenti, 2013). For the moment, we do not know whether a more 
precise categorization of episodes in this way will influence indications for treatment. A 
particular potential confusion is the possibility to add a mixed feature specifier to a 
depressive episode in a unipolar illness course. This appears to be most likely when there is 
a co-morbid borderline diagnosis (Perugi et al., 2015).

Rapid cycling specifier—Patients with four or more episodes of depression, mania, 
mixed state or hypomania in the preceding 12 months are conventionally described as 
showing rapid cycling. Rapid cycling is another specifier. It conflates patients with frequent 
illnesses allowing remission between episodes with those who cycle continuously (or switch 
continually) from one polarity to the other without euthymia (II, (Maj et al., 1999)). The 
lifetime risk of rapid cycling is around 16% and it is weakly associated with female gender, 
bipolar II disorder, current hypothyroidism and a poor response to lithium (especially the 
depressive component) (II-III, (Calabrese et al., 2001)). Rapid cycling obviously implies 
temporal severity and it may often be difficult to treat. In 30-40% of cases it may be 
preceded by exposure to antidepressants, and worsened by treatment with antidepressants 
(see below: treatment of depression), but there is no proof of a causal relationship.

NICE2014 has chosen not to make specific recommendations for treatment of rapid cycling 
bipolar disorder, commenting “Offer people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder the same 
interventions as people with other types of bipolar disorder because there is currently no 
strong evidence to suggest that people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder should be treated 
differently.” This is understandable given the paucity of evidence and we agree with their 
conclusion.

Other specifiers in DSM-5—Other specifiers that may be included in the description of a 
relevant episode are anxious distress, mood congruent psychotic features, mood incongruent 
psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset, seasonal pattern and for a depressive 
episode, melancholic feature or atypical features. Their value either for research or clinical 
practice remains to be established.

Predominant polarity—Although not included in DSM-5 as a course specifier, the 
majority of patients with bipolar disorder have a tendency to develop more episodes of one 
pole over the other. This has relevant clinical and therapeutic implications and can be 
clinically useful in planning drug and psychological treatment (Carvalho et al., 2015; Colom 
et al., 2006).

Gender—Women with Bipolar disorder have a slightly different profile of illness on 
average from men. The differences include more rapid cycling, a more seasonal pattern, 
more and longer depressive episodes, more mixed and dysphoric mania, more bipolar II 
cases, more comorbidity with medical disorders (e.g. thyroid disease, migraine, obesity) and 
anxiety disorders, less substance abuse, fewer completed suicides and later onset (Diflorio 
and Jones, 2010). Except for the implications of pregnancy and childbirth, such differences 
do not carry implications for treatment.

Co-morbidity—Co-morbidity of bipolar disorder with a range of other psychiatric 
conditions poses problems of two diametrically different kinds. First, non-specific 
psychological symptoms and disturbed behaviour may be the harbinger of bipolar disorder 
in young people. Diagnostic uncertainty or the wrong diagnosis at the very early stages of 
the illness can delay its accurate recognition (I, (Lish et al., 1994)). Secondly, in the 
presence of recognised bipolar disorder, co-morbid conditions may contribute to poor 
treatment response and outcome.

Anxiety disorders and persistent anxiety symptoms: Community samples show 
replicated, high lifetime co-morbidities of Bipolar I disorder with a range of anxiety related 
disorders and substance use (I, (Kessler et al., 1997; Merikangas et al., 2007)). Lifetime rates 
are extremely high in some estimates: as many as 90% of bipolar I patients reported at some 
time to have had an anxiety disorder in the influential US National co-morbidity survey (I-II, 
(Freeman et al., 2002; Merikangas et al., 2007)). The most recent meta-analysis of 40 
studies, including 14,914 individuals from North America, Europe, Australia, South 
America, and Asia, suggested a more conservative lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders 
of about 45% (95% CI 40–51) (Pavlova et al., 2015).

This raises the question of how to view anxiety symptoms within the behavioural phenotype 
in bipolar disorder. The earliest symptoms that a patient experiences may be those of anxiety 
but the dominant picture subsequently may be mania and depression. On the other hand, 
anxiety is not uncommon between acute episodes and in bipolar depression. Mixed affective 
states can be misdiagnosed as anxiety and vice versa.

Where the anxiety disorder dominates the outcome, this must clearly influence evaluations 
of successful treatments. Anxiety disorder co-morbidity is associated with a range of worse 
outcomes in bipolar disorder such as worse functioning, poorer quality of life, increased 
suicide rates, rapid cycling and the transition from unipolar to bipolar depression (Fagiolini 
et al., 2007; Simon et al., 2004) and yet has received little specific attention in developing 
treatments. For adequate assessment, anxiety should be regularly monitored (in addition to 
the usual focus on depression and mania).

In fact anxiety in bipolar disorder may have particular features that should influence 
approaches to treatment development. There is scope to improve assessment to consider 
bipolar-specific features like anxiety-provoking mental imagery (Hales et al., 2011; Ivins et 
al., 2014) because this may amplify the expectation of future threat. Mental imagery 
involves “seeing in the mind’s eye”. While this may relate to intrusive past events (‘flash 
backs’ as in PTSD) it is also relevant as a ‘flash forward’ experience. Previously suicidal 
patients may, for example, vividly simulating a future outcome such as jumping off a cliff 
(Hales et al., 2011). Such experience can be asked about in assessment (in addition to the 
content of verbal thoughts) (Di Simplicio et al., 2012).

Alcohol and drug use: As with anxiety, excessive use of alcohol or drugs is so common in 
bipolar patients that there seems to be a shared vulnerability to either or both outcomes. 
Experimental studies even suggest how this may arise for alcohol dependence (Yip et al., 
2012). The risk of alcohol dependence is, therefore, another common (and clinically 
significant) comorbidity of bipolar I and perhaps to a lesser extent bipolar II disorder. Drug, 
especially stimulant, use is more relevant to younger patients with bipolar II disorder and is 
associated with poorer outcome. It can confound the diagnosis and makes engagement with 
treatment more difficult (I, (Strakowski et al., 2000)). Indeed, mania appears to be induced 
by a range of stimulant drugs. Where elated states are sustained and meet criteria for mania, 
a diagnosis of ‘drug induced psychosis’ is likely to be wrong and a diagnosis of Bipolar 
disorder more useful. A true drug-induced psychosis should either wane with the clearance

of the offending drug or be a transient effect associated with drug withdrawal (see definition 
of Substance-induced psychotic disorder in DSM-IV).

Levodopa and corticosteroids are the most common prescribed medications associated with 
secondary mania (I-II, (Young et al., 1997; Brown et al., 2002; Brown et al., 1999)).

It is an important principle that bipolar patients with significant alcohol or other drug use 
should have these issues appropriately assessed and treated, and consideration given to 
involving the specialist addictions service, or dual diagnosis team, if available. There is 
evidence that effective treatment of substance use can improve compliance and bipolar 
outcomes (Ib, (Salloum and Thase, 2000)).

Caffeine is an obvious but often over-looked drug which may contribute to sleep 
disturbance, anxiety and perhaps mood elevation in bipolar patients. Sensitivity to caffeine, 
related to its actions at the Adenosine A2 receptor, appear to be genetically determined and 
modulated by a common polymorphism (Urry and Landolt, 2015). The importance of 
caffeine in bipolar patients is poorly documented by formal research. Systematic recording 
of caffeine consumption and efforts to cut down may be helpful in vulnerable individuals.

Gambling, over-spending and shop lifting: Gambling has an increased prevalence in 
bipolar patients (Jones et al., 2015a), and may be a major clinical problem. There is evidence 
that gambling is in part a way to regulate mood but mood elevation also enhances enjoyment 
(Lloyd et al., 2010). There is limited evidence that lithium may have an independent effect in 
problem gamblers (Rogers and Goodwin, 2005) again pointing to a shared vulnerability. 
There has been little formal study of the management of problem gambling in bipolar 
patients.

Overspending and shoplifting can also be problems for people with bipolar disorder 
compared to other disorders and the general population even between manic and depressive 
episodes (Blanco et al., 2008). The mechanism is unclear but it can be a significant problem 
for clinical management.

Personality disorder: Personality disorder may be an important accompaniment of Bipolar 
disorder, although the categorical approach to personality disturbance has important 
limitations (Blacker and Tsuang, 1992). As with the co-morbidities already described, the 
greater risk probably lies in allowing a personality diagnosis to blind the clinician to bipolar 
disorder, rather than vice versa. DSM-5 retains borderline, obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, 
schizotypal, antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders, but also recognizes dependent, 
histrionic, paranoid and schizotypal. The borderline diagnosis is the most critical for 
confusion with bipolar disorder. Histrionic personality disorder falls in the so-called 
‘dramatic’ or cluster B grouping with borderline, narcissistic and antisocial disorders; it is 
also not uncommon in bipolar disorder, but has received little clinical attention.

Borderline personality disorder may be co-morbid in as many as 20% of bipolar I and II 
cases. The dual diagnosis is associated with worse outcomes: hospitalisation (Colom et al., 
2000), suicidal ideation and deliberate self harm (Leverich et al., 2003), increased service 
utilisation (Lembke et al., 2003), substance abuse (Kay et al., 2002), poor symptomatic

outcome (George et al., 2003) and worse adherence & treatment response (Colom et al., 
2000; Bieling et al., 2007).

The relatively high rate of co-morbidity is problematic because clinicians usually seek to 
make an exclusive diagnosis of one or other disorder. Moreover, they appear to try and do so 
without really enquiring systematically about borderline symptoms in particular (Saunders et 
al., 2015). Finally, even if there is a systematic enquiry about symptoms, there is a 
potentially confusing overlap between borderline symptoms, bipolar spectrum and rapid 
cycling bipolar disorder.

The key symptoms that distinguish the borderline diagnosis are the pervasive presence of 
efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, unstable and intense personal relationships, 
an unstable image of self and chronic feelings of emptiness. The defining feature of bipolar 
disorder is (hypo)mania, which is not satisfied by identifying simply the anger which is such 
a strong feature colouring the presentation of borderline patients. The diagnoses can only be 
made by systematic enquiry about symptoms and construction of the longitudinal course of 
the illness. Symptoms in bipolar disorder are episodic and in borderline patients pervasive 
and enduring. It is a grave clinical error to interpret bipolar episodes as pervasive and 
personality driven if they are not. Early abuse and neglect is common in psychiatric patients 
in general and not diagnostic of borderline personality disorder, as widely believed 
(Saunders et al., 2015).

Organic conditions: Organic conditions, such as thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis, 
neurosyphilis or any lesion(s) involving right-sided sub-cortical or cortical areas may be 
associated with secondary mania (II-III, (Cummings and Mendez, 1984; Mendez, 2000; 
Strakowski et al., 1994)) and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Secondary 
mania is commonest in older patients (Dols et al., 2014).

Early diagnosis of bipolar disorder—The early diagnosis of bipolar disorder may not 
be easy. The delay described in surveys of patients with bipolar disorder is, on average, a 
decade (I, (Lish et al., 1994)). A number of factors contribute. In part it will be because, as 
noticed in the previous section, the first developments may be non-specific anxiety, 
depression or substance use. Bipolar disorder cannot be diagnosed if an episode of 
(hypo)mania has not yet occurred, and it would be unhelpful to say that a diagnosis has been 
missed in these circumstances. Notwithstanding such reservations, the diagnosis of 
(hypo)mania or sub-syndromal mood elevation may indeed often be missed in young adults. 
Misdiagnosis contributes to the problems for patients and their families when accepted 
diagnostic criteria are either not applied or ignored. In young patients, generally, behavioural 
disturbance may be interpreted as the maturational tensions of adolescence. Alternatively, 
‘personality’ diagnoses are still perhaps too readily employed (III, e.g. (Tyrer and 
Brittlebank, 1993)). To miss a diagnosis of a treatable condition may be harmful. Second 
opinions from bipolar specialists are potentially helpful.

Finally, before the expression of frank (hypo)mania, a significant number of bipolar patients 
diagnosed with unipolar depression may run into difficulties because of inadequate or 
inappropriate treatment. In addition to morbidity, the failure to diagnose bipolar disorder

appears to incur significant additional costs (McCombs et al., 2007). Any patient who is 
being treated for depression should be asked if they have a personal history of abnormal 
mood elevation of any duration or a family history of affective disorder (D, opinion of 
consensus group).

Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children—It is fully accepted that Bipolar I disorder 
can present before puberty and should be diagnosed as such. It is a relatively rare condition 
and its recognition should rest on the detection of the symptoms of mania - specifically 
euphoria and grandiosity and never simply irritability. Most studies of childhood bipolar 
disorder have been conducted in the absence of empirically supported guidelines for 
determining the presence of the manic syndrome, which poses real operational problems for 
definition in children. For example, what constitutes grandiosity at age 8 versus age 15 and 
at what point does silliness and laughing, usually associated with normal childhood 
behavior, become indicative of mania? NICE2014 recommends that the diagnosis of mania 
in a person under 18 years of age requires a distinct period of abnormally and persistently 
elevated or expansive mood. Plus, there has to be a change in the person’s normal pattern of 
behaviour that is not developmentally appropriate and which is associated with impairment. 
Therefore, the condition is episodic, not chronic. It is quite likely that mania is more often 
mis-diagnosed than over-diagnosed in the UK context. It is very important clinically to 
recognize that the first presentation is often depression; so those with recurrent depression, 
or with treatment-resistant depression may have bipolar disorder. Because it is 
proportionally more common in young people (unipolar depression tending to a later 
incidence) it may often be a diagnosis that is over-looked.

NICE2014 recommends that “Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children or young people 
should be made only after a period of intensive, prospective longitudinal monitoring by a 
healthcare professional or multidisciplinary team trained and experienced in the assessment, 
diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder in children and young people, and in 
collaboration with the child or young person’s parents or carers”. It should take into account 
the child or young person’s educational and social functioning. The group endorse this as a 
standard of care. However, it should not be an injunction that simply delays diagnosis (and 
appropriate treatment) when diagnostic criteria are already, clearly met.

There is some consistency in reports of the prevalence of bipolar diagnoses in young people 
in different countries. The average rate for age 7-21 years was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). 
This is probably higher than appreciated (Van Meter et al., 2011). The developmental 
trajectory is still to be established definitively by prospective studies. People of above 
average ability are over-represented in bipolar cohorts (MacCabe et al., 2010).

Diagnosis became controversial because ‘childhood bipolar’ diagnoses became increasingly 
common in some services in North America (II, (Geller et al., 1995)), but generally not in 
the rest of the world (II, (Wals et al., 2001)). In North America rates of diagnosis increased 
forty-fold in children and young people in a decade (Blader and Carlson, 2007; Moreno et 
al., 2007). The desire to move diagnosis earlier in the life history is entirely understandable. 
Unfortunately to do so inevitably risks sacrificing specificity to sensitivity. At the risk of 
over-simplification, softening the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to allow irritability and

chronicity risks confounding with more common problems such as ADHD and oppositional 
disorder. Indeed, these disorders were usually described as very commonly comorbid with 
childhood bipolar diagnoses in US case series. Affective instability is undoubtedly a 
component of what troubles many children, but it does not allow ‘early diagnosis’ of true 
bipolar disorder.

DSM-5 moved to diffuse the problem of diagnosing overactive children with emotional 
instability as ‘bipolar’ by inventing the diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation 
Disorder (DMDD). This is accordingly defined by severe recurrent temper outbursts 
manifested as verbal rages and/or behaviourally (physical aggression toward people or 
property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or 
provocation. It is required to be inconsistent with developmental and to occur frequently (on 
average, three or more times per week). It appears to have links in later life with depression, 
a common outcome at follow up. However, it remains questionable whether this is really a 
diagnosis that merits classification as a mood disorder, rather than as a particularly severe 
form or variant of oppositional defiant disorder or ADHD. The separation from the latter is a 
potential source of confusion in the coming years.

It is now clear that clinical assessment should be supported by structured assessment tools to 
increase reliability and validity of diagnosis (Youngstrom and Van Meter, 2015). Instruments 
exist for the children themselves, parents and teachers. The detection of mania is more 
reliable on the basis of mothers’ reports than either the children themselves or teachers 
(Youngstrom et al., 2015). This has implications for the assessment of young people who 
have left home and for whom parental evidence may be lacking.

The Department of Health’s ‘National Service Framework’ in the UK set a 
template for specialist mental health clinical services to focus on 
‘psychosis’; this remains broadly unchanged with a consequent lack of 
understanding among policymakers of the need for high quality 
specialised services for bipolar patients (IV), either in relation to early 
intervention or to provision of adult services.

This contrasts with the approach to schizophrenia even though the burden 
of disease for bipolar I disorder is comparable with schizophrenia (I).

Mania is usually a medical emergency.

Assessment should be offered by a trained psychiatrist with an 
understanding of both the medicines and psychological treatments 
available for the management of bipolar disorder (S).

Patients should have access to early intervention, which must include the 
option of hospital admission (S).

Appropriate use of legal powers of detention is essential for the successful 
management of risk in some patients with acute mania and severe 
depression (S).

Consistent outpatient follow up is necessary and many individual patients 
may require complex interventions in community settings (S).

Risk assessment has poor positive predictive value for adverse outcomes 
and should not be over-emphasized in management (I).

There is an increased incidence of completed suicide soon after an 
assessment in bipolar patients (I), which suggests that current practice 
under-estimates suicide risk (IV).

Early intervention—Early detection and intervention is an increasing aspiration for 
mental health services. In the UK, the development of all mental health services has been 
distorted by an emphasis on psychosis and, in early intervention, psychosis has also been the 
paradigm focus. This could imply that a significant proportion of manic patients will be seen 
and treated, but actual practice appears to be inconsistent. A psychosis criterion will usually 
exclude patients with bipolar I disorder who present with depression until they become 
manic and will completely exclude bipolar II cases.

The illness model proposed for schizophrenia was based on two related ideas. First to reduce 
duration of untreated psychosis and provide a service that was geared to treating younger 
people; avoiding stigma was a key element. The secondary purpose was inspired by the idea 
of a prodromal presentation and early intervention to prevent onset of syndromal illness. 
There is an inherent contradiction for these two approaches being pursued by the same 
service. Earlier detection of established illness implies diagnostic confidence and an earlier 
choice of evidence based treatments. In contrast, a prodrome is likely to be a relatively non-
specific predictor of subsequent illness, in the absence of a diagnostic biomarker. Hence, 
there would be tolerance of diagnostic uncertainty, and no established approach to treatment.

Early presentations with affective disorder pose the same dilemma. The necessary diagnostic 
tools to identify bipolarity in the prodrome are under active investigation (Howes et al., 
2011; Youngstrom et al., 2015). However, we lack the necessary service structure to deliver 
any clinical programme.

One version of a staging model for bipolar disorder is shown in Fig. 1. An important caveat 
is that staging implies predictable progression (most classically in the context of a cancer 
diagnosis) and bipolar illness course is much less predictable. Indeed the high rates of 
symptomatic diagnoses in young people suggest the outcome can be benign in a significant 
number of individuals assessed as teenagers (Tijssen et al., 2010).

There is a reluctance to make a diagnosis in young people with bipolar disorder, which is to 
some extent reinforced by NICE2014. Thus, NICE recommendations place an emphasis on 
specialist and detailed assessment. Much as this may always be desirable, it may be 
unnecessary if symptoms and history are obvious. If detailed assessment is not available, one 
result is likely to be failure to intervene in a way that might engage younger people with 
bipolar disorder at a time when treatment has most potential to be both effective and efficient 
(Kessing et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2015b). The first symptoms of bipolar disorder commonly

occur in the teenage years, with a mean age of onset by age 20 but many diagnoses are not 
made before the age of 30 (Fig. 1).

First and early episodes—Early-onset bipolar patients are about twice as likely to 
present with depression as mania (see Fig 1 and (Biffin et al., 2009)). Depression with 
psychosis in young people may predict subsequent bipolar disorder (Tohen et al., 2012). 
Highly recurrent illness and a family history may also raise the index of suspicion that a 
young person with a depressive episode has bipolar disorder. The use of antidepressants (i.e. 
drugs for unipolar depression) in these patients appears to be quite common. There is very 
little controlled data, but the findings from large naturalistic studies suggest that a patient 
whose diagnosis subsequently changes to bipolar is more likely to receive multiple 
treatments for their first depressive episode and so may be relatively treatment-resistant 
(Goodwin, 2012). This may be a further clue to diagnosis. Additionally, the drugs 
themselves may increase the risk of manic switch or mood instability. In either case, they do 
not lend strong support to the use of antidepressants for unipolar depression in bipolar cases 
(see later).

Even where the diagnosis can be made with confidence there is a dearth of evidence 
concerning the optimal management of a first syndromal episode. The key objective must be 
to prevent recurrence and the accrual of disability in young people because they tend to have 
poor clinical outcomes (Coryell et al., 2013). The optimal treatment choices or combinations 
are not established; the available data to be reviewed below concern mature patients.

Any acute episode, regardless of polarity, should receive active treatment. Mania, in 
particular, is a relative emergency because of the important personal and social 
consequences that result from the errors of judgement that are intrinsic to a highly elevated 
mood state. The complexity of bipolar disorder makes it desirable that assessment should be 
offered by a trained psychiatrist with an understanding of both the medicines and 
psychological treatments available for the management of bipolar disorder. Patients should 
have access to early intervention within an episode, which must include the option of 
hospital admission.

Appropriate use of legal powers of detention is essential for the successful management of 
some patients with acute mania and psychotic depression. Patients who are unlikely to co-
operate with treatment because of difficulties in accepting their diagnosis, who use drugs, or 
in whom violence, risk taking or self harm complicate their mood change may require 
complex, community-based interventions, although the optimal approach remains 
controversial (Burns et al., 2002).

Risk assessment in bipolar disorder—There has been considerable emphasis in 
mental health policy and corresponding research interest in risk assessment in the UK and 
other high income countries. This approach is problematic if it is based on the notion of 
accurate prediction – the predictive value of assessment scales for suicide and violent risk 
are currently poor to moderate, and the ability of these tools to identify high risk groups is 
uncertain. For outcomes with very low base rates such as suicide, risk factors will only be 
weakly predictive of the event, and most suicides will occur in patients who, in statistical

terms, are at low risk (Powell et al., 2000); this is also called the prevention paradox. 
Therefore, the idea that high risk groups can be appropriately targeted in providing services 
is a fallacy.

All bipolar patients are at risk of suicide, especially if admitted to hospital, when their first 
episode is depressive, if prone to recurrent depression and mixed states, have co-morbid 
anxiety (Harris and Barraclough, 1997; Schaffer et al., 2015) or comorbid drug and alcohol 
use disorders (Webb et al., 2014). The logical approach is to provide good long-term clinical 
care to as many of them as possible.

One area where suicide risk assessment needs to be examined more carefully is in self-harm 
patients with bipolar disorder presenting to hospital. Here the subsequent risk of suicide is 
high in the following year particularly (Tidemalm et al., 2008), and therefore risk assessment 
really may enable more effective targeting of those that need enhanced follow-up. This is 
important because risk may be under-estimated in bipolar patients. Thus, in a large survey of 
suicides in the UK, more than 60% of the bipolar group were in contact with services the 
week prior to suicide but were assessed as low risk (Clements et al., 2013). A diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder should modify an optimistic risk assessment of a symptomatic patient.

Concerns about the risk of violence by psychiatric patients (not necessarily bipolar patients), 
has led to a proliferation of often very lengthy assessment schedules. A systematic review of 
the better known instruments suggest that they perform quite well at predicting individuals at 
low risk of offending, but the positive predictive value for those who will offend is not 
strong (Fazel et al., 2012). Thus, there is little evidence to support the routine use of the 
current set of commonly used instruments in bipolar disorder. New instruments will have to 
be assessed on their own merits, using multiple measures of performance. They need to be 
scalable, evidence-based, and not lead to patient harms (as positive predictive values will be 
low).

In conclusion, the central purpose of risk assessment should be clinical diagnosis and 
estimation of severity of depression. For suicide and violence risk, beyond identifying 
comorbid substance abuse and past history of self harm and criminality, further 
quantification of risk is unlikely to help plan treatment and services. Many suicides occur in 
the first year after a serious episode of self harm, so reinforcing the need for attention to this 
clinical context and to early treatment engagement. Prisoners represent another high risk 
group who merit the same consideration (Fazel and Seewald, 2012; Fazel et al., 2013).

The potential for the prevention of suicide and violent offending—The most 
important perspective for risk assessment is the potential for successful long-term treatment 
to reduce suicide risks by preventing new episodes or reducing chronic symptoms. Suicide 
has never been the primary outcome measure for a clinical trial in bipolar disorder, because 
in practice observable rates are too low. However, naturalistic studies have long suggested 
that suicide rates are lower in patients who receive long-term treatment (Angst et al., 2002). 
Furthermore lithium may have particular efficacy. This conclusion is again based largely on 
naturalistic comparison of patient cohorts on and off lithium, but the findings from different 
centres are consistent and the treatment effect is very large (I, (Tondo et al., 2001; Toffol et

al., 2015)). One short-term RCT also found suicides and attempted suicides to be associated 
with carbamazepine and not lithium treatment (Ib, (Thies-Flechtner et al., 1996)). Indeed, 
meta-analysis of all the randomized controlled data for lithium suggests an important effect 
on suicide in studies which are individually inconclusive because of inadequate power (I, 
(Cipriani et al., 2013a)). An emerging study of a large Swedish data base which allows 
within subject comparisons on and off treatment in a so-called quasi-experimental design, 
has confirmed lithium’s effect in reducing suicide attempts by 30%; the same effect was not 
seen with valproate (Song et al.). Both lithium and valproate treatment were associated with 
90% reduction in completed suicide.

There is also recent evidence that treatment may be effective in reducing the rate of violent 
crime in patients with bipolar disorder. The data again comes from record linkage of 
medications and outcome. Dopamine antagonists halved the rates of offending in bipolar 
disorder and schizophrenia. Drugs for relapse prevention (‘mood stabilizers’ so lithium and 
valproate mainly) had an equally potent effect in bipolar disorder (but not in schizophrenia) 
(Fazel et al., 2014). These results are impressive because the events are relatively common, 
effect sizes are so large and the outcomes so important. As already emphasized in relation to 
data quality, they move the argument for benefit to a completely different level, compared 
with effects on symptoms or even symptomatic relapse. Consequently we have upgraded 
them in assessing the evidence supporting the use of medications in the long term.

The National Confidential Inquiry data for England and Wales (1997–2006) included 1243 
bipolar patients (10% of the sample) who had died from suicide, and been in contact with 
mental health services in the previous 12 months (Clements et al., 2013). They make 
sobering reading. Only 390 (31%) were adherent with medication at time of death. This is an 
important measure of how ineffective management strategies currently are for our patients. 
Only 13 (about 3%) died by poisoning with prescribed drugs, so the benefit/risk potential 
appears favourable. The challenge appears to be the delivery of effective treatment.

The need for a service model—The neglect of the specific needs of bipolar patients in 
UK government policy (Morriss et al., 2002) justifies our restating the obvious in the 
previous paragraphs. The term bipolar disorder or manic depression was given no special 
consideration (and entirely omitted from the glossary of key terms) in the National Service 
Framework for mental disorders in the United Kingdom (Department of Health, 1999). It 
remains a monolithic social model of mental illness, which is inappropriate to bipolar 
disorder (Goodwin and Geddes, 2007).

The complexity of the disorder, the resulting need for specialist and expert care and the 
potential for preventing bad outcomes by early treatment all argue for a concerted effort to 
improve treatment. The recent NICE guideline implied that this objective could be achieved 
by the appropriate deployment of existing services. We are very sceptical. In our view, a 
separate, serious effort to extend early intervention to young people with affective disorder, 
with appropriate identified funding, is long overdue. The absence of early stage specificity 
has led to pioneering approaches to youth mental health services in Australia, where distress 
rather than a diagnostic criterion applies, and bipolar patients can, in principle, make 
appropriate access (McGorry et al., 2007).

In addition to the lack of focus on bipolar disorder, and certainly contributing to making it 
worse, is the traditional fault line between child and adolescent services and adult services. 
This falls at exactly the point where continuity is most obviously needed for young people 
developing severe psychiatric disorder (IV).

Nevertheless, there remains a need for better quality evidence on which to argue for an 
improved approach to care. According to an analysis for the charity MQ, funding for 
research on bipolar disorder has been about one third that for schizophrenia in the decade to 
2013 (http://www.joinmq.org/pages/mental-health-research-funding-landscape-report). It is 
hardly surprising that our knowledge base is less than it might be: this must change.

The best service model?: The single most relevant study concerned bipolar patients 
discharged from inpatient care for their first, second or third episode of bipolar disorder in 
Denmark (Kessing et al., 2013); they were randomized to either specialised or standard care. 
The specialized care reduced re-admission over the subsequent 6 years by about 20%. This 
approach would not necessarily be cost effective for less severely ill patients, but it translates 
into very appreciable cost savings in a group of patients at high risk of relapse and re-
admission.

The key ingredients of expert care appear to have been psychoeducation (based on the 
Barcelona model (Colom and Vieta, 2006)), an algorithmic psychopharmacology (based on 
the previous BAP Guidelines) and continuity/consistency of care. A critical ingredient of 
psychoeducation is likely to be active monitoring for signs of relapse to mania and this 
approach should be a standard of care (Morriss et al., 2007). The system in Denmark is 
broadly comparable to the UK, so these results may well generalize. They deserve very 
serious consideration in arguing for a better future in the care of bipolar patients.

In the USA, a collaborative care model has been proposed involving a key worker to keep 
close contact with the patient, encourage adherence to treatment algorithms and guidelines 
and follow up in the case of non-attendance. Two similar studies showed small positive 
effects on a number of outcomes (Bauer et al., 2006a; Bauer et al., 2006b; Simon et al., 
2006). This may have been mediated in part by improved adherence in the collaborative care 
arms of the studies (Bauer et al., 2009). Finally collaborative care focused on physical health 
improved blood pressure in a small RCT (Kilbourne et al., 2013). The lessons of these 
findings are less easy to translate to the UK because primary care and community provision 
is usually so limited in the USA and so there is the potential for a much bigger impact of 
service outreach. This was the lesson previously drawn from systematic comparisons of 
community care models for schizophrenia, which outside the USA had less if any impact on 
outcomes (Fiander et al., 2003).

Finally one negative or failed trial (Crowe et al., 2012) has the possible lesson that 
collaborative care needs to be an integral part of a service, rather than an add-on that risks 
disrupting the continuity of the core service provision.

NICE2014 published evidence from patients that supported employment initiatives are 
highly relevant to improving social outcomes. There are a few specific issues like risks of

overspending, recklessness that may require some safeguards, undesirability of shift work 
for some bipolar disorder patients and the ability to take time off relatively quickly if early 
signs of mania or depression emerge. Psychiatrists and other professionals should be aware 
of these issues when counselling return to usual employment as well.

In conclusion, very little work has pragmatically addressed the best model of service 
delivery for bipolar patients. Our conclusions are summarized alongside those reached by 
NICE (2014) in Table 1. The NICE approach essentially proposes that generic NHS care can 
be readily extrapolated to the needs of bipolar patients who require admission and access to 
secondary care services.

Our primary conclusion is that we really do require more evidence of what works at the 
systems level. In Table 5 most of the recommendations by NICE2014 are not based on 
formal evidence, certainly for applicability to bipolar disorder. Instead they appear largely 
driven by what is currently provided in theory by psychosis-orientated NHS services. 
However, it appears a priori self-evident that services should be led by specialists with 
expertise in guideline-based psychopharmacology, there should be continuity of care and 
psychosocial management should be informed by and apply lessons from psychoeducation.

Recent further fractionation of clinical services, for example between in and out patients, 
‘assessment’ and ‘treatment’ is a recent concern. It runs counter to the needs of bipolar 
patients in all stages of their treatment but particularly in managing follow up. Premature 
discharge to primary care can further dilute the treatment package available in the early 
stages of managing the illness (IV).

3  Enhanced clinical care

•

Enhancement of patient care can be achieved by structured interventions 
based on psychoeducation (II). This has the potential to complement and 
inform treatment with medicines, not replace it (IV).

While, the evidence for efficacy in preventing relapse comes from mature 
patient samples, the same approach can inform early assessment and 
intervention with young people (IV).

We support NICE’s assertion that assessment and management of bipolar 
disorder should ideally involve partners, families and carers.

Bipolar patients are at high risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and 
respiratory disease: there should be an annual auditable check for 
hypertension, central obesity, raised blood glucose, and dyslipidaemia 
annually (S).

Assess consumption of alcohol and drugs. Drinking up to 14 units of 
alcohol per week represents lower risk drinking levels for men and women 
(<1% increase in excess mortality). High risk drinking (10% excess 
mortality) is 35 units or over per week.

Bipolar patients may have a particular problem with the use of tobacco (I). 
Treatment with effective nicotine substitutes will often be indicated (IV).

Key uncertainty

•

The optimal approaches to enhanced care are evolving rapidly with the 
rapid development of self-monitoring and instruction from mobile apps.

As noticed in the previous section, the services in which care is delivered clearly constrain 
what is possible. However, good individual clinical practice is a commonplace but essential 
objective. Psychiatrists must take responsibility for diagnosis, physical examination, 
investigations and explanation of the medical plan of management. They must communicate 
clearly and effectively. A therapeutic alliance between doctor and patient is essential for the 
management of any complex chronic condition, which bipolar disorder certainly is.

The role of structured psychological treatment in the management of bipolar disorder 
remains at an experimental and exploratory level. However, the findings are already 
important because they suggest that enhanced care can improve outcomes in bipolar I and, 
probably, bipolar II patients. Broadly speaking the interventions that have been offered in 
bipolar disorder are pragmatically directed to identified clinical problems. They do not 
depend on specific models of psychopathology. There is also appreciable overlap in content 
of the different approaches although it is conventional to consider them under separate 
headings. The following general principles are important.

1)

2)

Bipolar disorder is a long-term problem, so psychological treatments should 
produce enduring behavioural change. Acute effects of any psychological 
approach need also to be considered in the longer term.

We endorse the NICE statement on caregiver involvement. In essence, partners, 
families and carers can contribute significantly to the assessment process, the 
management of acute episodes, the promotion of long-term recovery and the 
prevention of relapse. This has the further implication that carers may benefit 
from information and support to improve how they achieve these objectives.

Knowledge (or ‘Psychoeducation’)—There is a consensus that good clinical 
management of patients with bipolar disorder involves an appreciable educational 
component for both patients and their relatives. The objective of acquiring knowledge about 
the illness is prevention of relapse. Successful long-term management involves a high degree 
of patient involvement and autonomous judgement about return of symptoms etc. It is 
essential to address the seriousness of the illness, any reluctance to give up the experience of 
hypomania or mania, the risk of relapse and the benefit of therapeutic engagement (IV). For 
patients to know what to do, and why, appears usually to be an essential prelude to actually 
doing it.

One option is to provide a formal group course, the efficacy of which was shown in a 
randomized controlled trial (II, (Colom et al., 2003)). This compared psychoeducation with 
an equivalent group experience in which the content was simply unstructured supportive 
discussion. The use of an appropriate control intervention gives this trial particular 
credibility and the benefits of psychoeducation appear to be sustained because mood 
episodes of all types were reduced over a 5 year follow up of the original trial participants 
(Colom et al., 2009). The effect size compared to other psychoeducation RCTs makes it an

optimistic outlier (Bond and Anderson, 2015). Nevertheless, the findings described 
previously from Denmark over six years may also underline the potential for long clinically 
relevant effects in patients with recent illness onset (Kessing et al., 2013). Comparison with 
other alternatives, notably CBT (see also below), has also illustrated the economy of a more 
educational approach (Parikh et al., 2012).

Despite our endorsement, virtually as a standard of care, negative or just marginally positive 
findings have been common in trials of psychoeducation. Pellegrinelli et al (2013) failed to 
show any difference in clinical outcomes for 16 psychoeducation versus non-
psychoeducation sessions using the Barcelona manual; a slightly different 
psychoeducational approach run in UK mental health teams failed to separate convincingly 
from treatment as usual (Lobban et al., 2010). A related, more sustained intervention (the 
Life Goals program) showed minor effects on manic symptoms over 2 years (Simon et al., 
2006) but more substantial gains in function (not reduced symptoms) over 3 years (Bauer et 
al., 2006b). These failed or marginally positive trials indicate the methodological challenge 
to future treatment development.

Failure to find a difference between groups is associated with higher proportions of patients 
with more previous episodes (Scott et al., 2007). Age appears not to vary between studies of 
adult patients, so intensity rather than length of illness appears to be the limiting factor. 
Clearly, lack of efficacy in large numbers of patients with more recurrent illness represents a 
challenge to understand the failure of existing approaches and an unmet need to develop 
better treatment approaches in the future.

The key ingredients of all psychotherapies so far found useful for bipolar disorder (including 
psychoeducation) are as follows (Miklowitz et al., 2008):

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

7.

Monitor moods and early warning signs

Recognize and manage stress triggers and interpersonal conflicts

Develop relapse prevention plans

Stabilize sleep/wake rhythms and daily routines

Encourage medication adherence

Reduce self-stigmatization

Reduce alcohol or drug use (including caffeine in sensitive individuals)

The involvement of carers/family is highlighted in family-focused treatment for younger 
patients, which has similar ingredients (Geddes and Miklowitz, 2013). In fact, these 
elements are also commonly present in treatments formally described in clinical trials as 
something other than psychoeducation (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and inter-
personal social rhythm therapy (IPSRT)), which is a source of confusion. The role of CBT 
will be considered in a little more detail in relation to the treatment of bipolar depression and 
relapse prevention.

Optimal delivery of psychoeducation—The group format may not be culturally 
generalizable, so individual or family, rather than group approaches to psychoeducation, are 
also likely to be helpful and can inform ordinary practice. Facilitated use of a 5 session 
psychoeducational package increased comprehension of the principles and practice of self-
management compared with self-instruction (Miklowitz et al., 2012).

Current practice also favours didactic teaching, live or by video, written materials or guided 
internet searching for high quality material (e.g. the National Electronic library for mental 
health: http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/). There is also an explosion of self-help apps, most still of 
rather low quality (Nicholas et al., 2015), that may incorporate personal mood and activity 
monitoring on mobile devices. The approach has enormous intuitive appeal, but systematic 
examination of the effects of self-monitoring has not led to immediate proof of concept 
(Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2015). Such individual, rather than group approaches, includes the 
use of auto-didactic on line psychoeducation (Barnes et al., 2011): to see this in action visit 
http://www.beatingbipolar.org. The possibility of recording therapy sessions on patients’ 
phones for subsequent review also has the potential to enhance patient care. This is an area 
likely to see major advances in the coming years and, hopefully, clarification of what really 
helps.

A time very early in the illness course may not be the most propitious for patient 
acceptability; however, it may be a critical period for the greatest impact of behavioural 
change on clinical outcome. Thus, the goals of education need to be sustained and 
incremental. There also needs to be a shared and consistent approach across mental health 
disciplines. Psychoeducation also appears to offer an approach to intervention in the early 
stages of the disorder before diagnosis is necessarily established and medicines are 
indicated.

Adherence to medicines—As we will review, there is good evidence that long-term 
treatment is effective in preventing relapse in bipolar disorder. However, adherence to 
prescribed medicines is poor in most chronic illness (I, (Horne et al., 2013)). Bipolar 
disorder is no exception (II, (Johnson and McFarland, 1996; Lingam and Scott, 2002; Scott 
and Pope, 2002)). The simplest framework for understanding adherence weighs the 
perceived need for treatment against concerns about its possible effects (Clatworthy et al., 
2009). Understanding need will necessarily be a matter for education and personal 
experience. Adverse reactions are a major consideration given the limitations of existing 
medicines and should be minimised by all possible means. These include once daily 
administration (e.g. at bed time), switching between formulations and dose adjustments. 
Other efforts to improve adherence such as user-friendly packaging, monitoring of pill 
taking, delivery of supplies of medicine may contribute to successful treatment in certain 
individuals.

The motivation to take tablets is heavily dependent upon the attitudes, beliefs and 
perceptions of risk shown by patients and their carers. These cultural factors may often 
divide clinical staff from patients. Pragmatic motivational interviewing to improve 
adherence to prescribed medicines has already been shown to be moderately effective in 
patients with psychosis. The best-known early study included a sub-group with bipolar

disorder (II, (Kemp et al., 1998)). Since non-adherence with treatment occurs in up to 50% 
of most clinical samples (Scott and Pope, 2002), the development of a focused and generally 
applicable approach to this problem would be welcome. The published methodology 
emphasises the involvement of a third party and there is clearly a potential role here for 
pharmacists who occupy an advisory role for patients in other contexts. Where barriers to 
adherence are identified and targeted interventions delivered, adherence is more likely to 
improve (Staring et al., 2010). Patient-related factors include younger age, male gender, low 
educational level, alcohol and drug use. Disorder-related factors include severity, insight and 
lack of awareness of illness. And treatment-related factors are obviously adverse reactions to 
medications and perceived lack of efficacy. To improve adherence, clinical practice should 
address the underlying causes of non-adherence within the overall frame work of 
psychoeducation (Leclerc et al., 2013). If the bottom line for adherence is the balance 
between the perceived necessity of drug treatment and concerns about it, this should inform 
clinical efforts to improve it.

Clinical trials, in bipolar disorder as in other conditions, are likely directly to enhance 
patient care (I, (Ashcroft, 2000)). We believe that participation per se in well-designed 
clinical trials is a benefit for both doctors and patients. To put it bluntly, a controlled 
experiment is likely to be better than participation in the uncontrolled experiment that is 
ordinary practice. Furthermore the results from trials will eventually enhance the evidence 
base for improving patient care. Participation in trials is potentially related to adherence and 
hence we make the point here

Awareness of stressors, sleep disturbance and early signs of relapse, and 
regular patterns of activity—Manic relapse in particular may follow a relatively 
stereotyped course in individual patients. Sleep disturbance is perhaps the most commonly 
described final common pathway to mania (II, (Wehr et al., 1987)). The sleep of bipolar 
patients between episodes is often disturbed in a very similar way to that of patients with 
primary insomnia (Harvey et al., 2005). Despite this, formal trials to improve sleep in 
bipolar disorder are only just beginning. Pilot data suggest effects of CBT for insomnia 
generalize to bipolar symptoms (Harvey et al., 2015).

The more usual emphasis is on tell tale signs and symptoms of relapse; this may take the 
form of particular impulses and preoccupations which accompany or even precede it. Efforts 
to train patients on individual scripts which access their own experience and enable them to 
take evasive action appears to be effective in avoiding new episodes of mania (II, (Perry et 
al., 1999)). This approach was less successful with episodes of depression. The original 
intensive trial involved up to 12 sessions of training and there is a need to know whether a 
more dilute approach or one focused uniquely on personal scripts for relapse into mania 
would be more widely applicable. The involvement of family members with experience of 
previous episodes may be helpful (Reinares et al., 2008).

Interpersonal social rhythms therapy (IPSRT) developed out of particular ideas about what 
behavioural features contribute to relapse in bipolar disorder (II, (Swartz and Frank, 2001)). 
The reestablishment of routine and regular activity for those behaviours that recur at least 
once per week is a primary goal in treatment. IPSRT provides a simple framework for

practical advice and feedback. It has also informed the development of a phone based app 
for sensing activity and providing feedback to shape social activity (Matthews et al., 2014).

The further role of structured psychotherapy will be considered in relation to relapse 
prevention. All such therapy recognizes as axiomatic the value of a highly collaborative 
therapeutic relationship with the patient. The commitment by a clinician to see a patient long 
term can contribute to an optimal management plan.

The general point emerges that outcomes for patients can be improved simply by enhancing 
ordinary clinical care, most obviously by adopting a consistent approach to psychoeducation 
or knowledge sharing. Translating this observation into enhanced care for more patients 
should be an important objective for treatment.

Functional impairments—Clinicians must anticipate the need to give advice about 
expectations and capacity to work. Major life decisions may not be auspicious when made in 
a depressive or manic state. Furthermore, patients may experience considerable difficulty 
performing at the level for which their education may have prepared them (II, (MacQueen et 
al., 2001)). This may be a result of common sub-syndromal symptoms of depression or 
anxiety (I, (Denicoff et al., 2000)) or other barriers to psychological well-being (II, (Scott, 
1996)). Factors specific to bipolar disorder such as experience when high, or personality 
style, may also conspire to widen the gap between aspiration and achievement. Finally, there 
is evidence that objective impairments of neuropsychological function are both significant 
and enduring (I, (Bourne et al., 2013)). These objective problems in sustaining attention, 
memory and executive function appear to be made worse by repeated episodes (Clark et al., 
2002; Martinez-Aran et al., 2004) and are more severe in bipolar I patients (Bourne et al., 
2015). In other words they may be a quasi-toxic consequence of the intensity of the illness 
course. Polypharmacy may also compound the problem (Clark et al., 2002; Frangou et al., 
2005).

The National Service Framework for Mental Health recognised the vital role of informal 
carers in the delivery of mental health care (Department of Health, 1999)). However, it 
treated the needs of adults of working age as generic and was probably influenced by 
evidence from research in schizophrenia (I, (Fadden et al., 1987)) and the dementias (I, 
(Clyburn et al., 2000)). The literature concerning bipolar disorder is sparse, but the 
perceptions and beliefs of carers about it, as for other diseases, may have important effects 
on levels of burden that are experienced (II, (Perlick et al., 1999)). There is scope to develop 
improved psychosocial interventions tailored to bipolar patients and their families. A 
particular uncertainty, neglected hitherto, is the impact of manic states upon carers, and 
indeed their children. A preliminary investigation of the families of 86 stable patients 
showed that caregivers still showed a moderate level of subjective burden. The highest levels 
of distress related to the patient’s hyperactivity, irritability, sadness and withdrawal. The 
illness had also affected the carers’ emotional health and life in general. Poorer social and 
occupational functioning, an episode in the last 2 years, history of rapid cycling and the 
caregiver being responsible for medication intake explained a quarter of the variance of the 
subjective burden (Reinares et al., 2006).

It seems reasonable to note the emphasis on recovery with return of function as the modern 
aspiration for bipolar patients. Cognitive impairment is a barrier to good outcomes and there 
is preliminary evidence that cognitive remediation can play a part in improving function 
(Torrent et al., 2013).

Physical health, alcohol and drug use—In this country, a retrospective cohort study 
compared 46,136 patients with ‘severe mental illness’ (SMI) with 300,426 without SMI 
(using the GP Research Database). Hazard ratios (HRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) 
mortality in people with SMI compared with controls were 3.22 (95% confidence interval 
(CI), 1.99-5.21) for people 18-49 years old and 1.86 (95% CI, 1.63-2.12) for those 50-75 
years old. For stroke deaths, the respective HRs were 2.53 (95% CI, 0.99-6.47) and 1.89 
(95% CI, 1.50-2.38). Event rates in these age groups are quite low, but increased HRs for 
CHD mortality occurred irrespective of sex, SMI diagnosis, or prescription of medication 
during follow-up (Osborn et al., 2007).

The risk across the life span has been documented in a series of studies for bipolar disorder 
specifically. In most countries the estimate of years lost in bipolar patients is between 10 and 
20 years (Chesney et al., 2014). Put another way, just under 25% of the male population in 
Sweden die before the age of 70 years. The corresponding age for bipolar patients is just 
over 50 (Laursen and Nordentoft, 2011). Cardiovascular causes account for almost 40% of 
the deaths, which is nearly twice the number of suicides and accidental deaths; the risk is 
elevated across the life span. Moreover, the survival in the 5 years from diagnosis of a 
cardiovascular event is substantially reduced in bipolar patients (Westman et al., 2015), 
which may mean either that patients present later in their illness course or receive inferior 
treatment (or both).

The metabolic syndrome/obesity and type II diabetes are important in the mediating 
pathologies to cardiovascular disease. In a meta-analysis of the data from bipolar patients, 
rates of the metabolic syndrome were elevated about two fold compared with controls 
(Vancampfort et al., 2013). Treatment with dopamine antagonist drugs was associated with a 
rate of 43%, compared with 32% in those not so treated. However, the variation from 
country to country suggested a major contribution from dietary habits as well. In impressive 
population data from Taiwan, the times to initiation of treatment for both hyperlipidaemia 
and diabetes were significantly delayed for patients with bipolar disorder compared with the 
general population (Bai et al., 2013)).

Thus, effective medical management of physical illness in patients with severe bipolar 
disorder is a major challenge. The higher risk of cardiovascular disease in bipolar patients is 
not solely due to medication, and life style factors like smoking, diet and lack of exercise are 
also important. Consequently, a bipolar diagnosis should imply annual screening for 
metabolic risk factors even if a dopamine antagonist is not prescribed.

The metabolic syndrome is a composite of biochemical, blood pressure and weight indices. 
It is associated with older age, higher body mass index, and higher values for each individual 
criterion of the metabolic syndrome. The absolute waist circumference (>102 centimetres 
(40 in) in men and >88 centimetres (35 in) in women) and the waist-hip ratio (>0.9 for men

and >0.85 for women) are both used as measures of central obesity. In a small study, the 
presence of central obesity is the most sensitive indicator (92.0%) and fasting glucose 7.0 
mmol/l or over was most specific (95.2%) in correctly identifying the presence of metabolic 
syndrome (Straker et al., 2005). The treatment of blood pressure over 120/80 mmHg, and the 
use of statins in bipolar patients should follow existing medical practice.

Weight gain, in part driven by medication, is a particular problem. A comprehensive 
guideline, much of which will be relevant to bipolar patients as well as patients with 
psychosis, is provided by ‘The BAP guideline on the management of weight gain and 
metabolic disturbances associated with psychosis and antipsychotic drug treatment’ 
currently in preparation for this journal.

The consumption of alcohol and drugs will contribute to both physical and psychiatric 
morbidity and mortality. The assessment of these contributory factors and lifestyle advice 
are key to a more synergistic approach to treatment in bipolar disorder. Public Health 
England suggest that up to 14 units of alcohol per week for men and women represents 
lower risk drinking levels (excess mortality <1%). There is a monotonic increase in the risk 
of alcohol related death with higher levels of consumption. Excess mortality exceeds 10% at 
a consumption around 35 units per week. It is recommended that drinking is spread over the 
week but with 2 or more alcohol free days. This represents a tightening of advice for men 
particularly, based on new data showing an increased excess of cancers in drinkers (https://
www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489797/
CMO_Alcohol_Report.pdf ).

Advice on the use of tobacco is also essential because in data from the US, bipolar disorder 
has the highest rate of current and lifetime use and the lowest quit rate of any other 
psychiatric disorder (I, (Lasser et al., 2000)). Treatment with effective nicotine substitutes 
will often be indicated (I, https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45 ).

Audit of current practice: Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH-
UK)—The POMH-UK is based at the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Centre for Quality 
Improvement and runs audit-based quality improvement programmes (QIPs). The vast 
majority of UK mental health trusts participate in these traditional audit, intervention, re-
audit cycles. For some QIPs it is possible to abstract current prescribing practice for people 
with bipolar disorder specifically and for other QIPs data relating to those with a diagnosis 
of an affective disorder.

Treatment with dopamine antagonist agents should always trigger screening for four cardio-
metabolic risk factors (hypertension, central obesity, raised blood glucose, and 
dyslipidaemia). In a national POMH audit conducted in 2012 (Prescribing Observatory for 
Mental Health, 2013), 22% of patients with an affective disorder who were prescribed 
antipsychotic medication had been screened for all 4 of these measures in the previous year, 
54% for up to 3 measures, and 24% had received no screening. The respective figures for 
those with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia or related disorder were 36%, 49% and 15%. Thus, 
despite the major cardiovascular health risks for bipolar patients, these audit findings suggest

that, when receiving antipsychotic medication, they are less likely to have physical health 
screening and monitoring than patients on such treatment with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

When prescribing lithium, the practice standards (derived from NICE guidance) require that 
a patient be informed at the start of treatment about the potential adverse reactions, how they 
could recognise toxicity and how they should avoid toxicity. Audit data at baseline revealed 
that the proportion of patients provided with this information at the start of lithium treatment 
ranged between 42 and 62% (Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health, 2013). At a 
subsequent audit, conducted after provision of a bespoke, patient-held lithium information 
pack, the respective figures rose to between 54 and 68% (Paton et al., 2013).

A further finding was that approximately one in five patients who started lithium had no 
documented baseline test of renal function or thyroid function and this proportion remained 
relatively consistent over 5 years (2008-2013). However, there is some evidence that 
monitoring of serum lithium, renal and thyroid function improved over the same period; at 
baseline, there had been no documented monitoring of these parameters in the previous year 
for 10%, 19% and 18% respectively, but by the fourth audit, these proportions had fallen to 
5%, 7% and 10%. Serum lithium concentrations within the usual target range (0.4-1 
mmol/L) are found in almost 100% of patients in some NHS Trusts, but the proportion is as 
low as 50% in others.

Psychotropic drug prescribing for bipolar patients in the UK was fairly consistent over time. 
For patients taking lithium, around 20% took lithium alone, 45-50% took a second drug, 
about 30% a third, and 5% a fourth. This underlines current levels of polypharmacy. The 
added medicines are dopamine antagonists/partial agonists (55-60%), antidepressants 
(35-40%), valproate (13%), lamotrigine (5%), and depot or long acting drug (5%). For 
valproate, age/child-bearing potential did not seem to influence prescribing.

Given these data, antidepressants appear to be relatively over-prescribed and lamotrigine 
relatively under-prescribed given the evidence of benefit (q.v.). However, when prescribed, 
lamotrigine use seems to follow the indications presented in guidelines (Grande et al., 2012).

A template for audit of bipolar disorder is suggested in Table 4.

Treatment of Different Phases of Bipolar Disorder

Terminology and treatment strategy

•

•

•

Bipolar disorder usually presents for treatment in an acute illness episode 
(mania, depression or mixed state) (I). The objective of short-term 
treatment is to reduce the severity and shorten the duration of the acute 
episode and achieve remission of symptoms (S).

Long-term treatment is indefinite for the prevention of new episodes and 
to achieve adequate inter-episode control of residual or chronic mood 
symptom (S).

Because of the high risk of relapse and the apparent progression to more 
frequent episodes, long-term treatment with appropriate medicines is

advocated from as early in the illness course as is acceptable to a patient 
and their family (S).

•

Between episodes, mood instability or chronic depressive symptoms are 
common (I) and generally underestimated.

Key uncertainty

•

Current strategies emphasize the treatment and prevention of syndromal 
relapse. Disabling aspects of long-term outcome such as chronic 
depressive symptoms, mood instability, co-morbid anxiety, enduring 
neurocognitive impairment or oxidative status may be important future 
therapeutic targets.

It is usual to think of bipolar disorder as a sequence of acute illness episodes (mania, 
depression or mixed states) interspersed with relative euthymia. This view of the illness 
conditions how treatment strategies and actual treatment phases are distinguished. Short-
term treatments will refer to episodes and will often imply the intention to discontinue a 
medicine on recovery. Long-term treatment is indefinite and for the prevention of new 
episodes. Although it is conventional in discussing unipolar disorder to distinguish relapse 
(the early return of symptoms treated in an acute episode) from recurrence (the return of 
symptoms after remission), this is a distinction that is rarely helpful in bipolar disorder with 
relatively frequent episodes. We will refer to long-term treatment for prevention of relapse.

Currently neglected in the bipolar literature are the times between episodes. These represent 
most of the patient’s life and may be characterized by a variable sub-syndromal level of 
mood symptoms. Euthymia, the absence of symptoms and the presence of positive stable 
mood is actually quite unusual. Chronic symptoms in bipolar disorder are commonly 
depressive (II, (Judd et al., 2002; Judd et al., 2003; Kupka et al., 2007)) and significant levels 
of residual symptoms are predictive of relapse (Judd et al., 2008). As already noticed, there 
are also cognitive distortions similar to those seen in depressive disorder (II, (Scott, 1996)), 
sometimes disabling anxiety (Albert et al., 2008) and neuropsychological deficits that are 
still largely ignored (Bourne et al., 2013). These negative aspects of long-term outcome are 
often accepted as the natural history of the disease. In addition, there is evidence for 
increased oxidative stress, measured as enzyme activity in brain post mortem (Andreazza et 
al., 2013), in peripheral tissues in life (Andreazza et al., 2008) or as increased concentrations 
of oxidized circulating glutathione (Rosa et al., 2014). Inflammatory markers are also 
disturbed in bipolar patients (Modabbernia et al., 2013). Along with measures of social 
adjustment, these alternative measures of outcome represent key areas of focus for current 
uncertainty.

1  Acute Manic Episodes and DSM-IV mixed states

•

Treatment choice should be dictated by the clinical context and, whenever 
possible, by patient preference and experience (S). However, systematic 
comparison of the performance of drugs for mania suggests that 
haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine have the highest 
efficacy.

Drugs and dosages should be chosen that do not produce Extra-Pyramidal 
motor Side effects (S), which is of particular significance in bipolar 
patients because of their apparently greater risk of adverse motor reactions 
compared with schizophrenia (I for haloperidol).

When combined with lithium or valproate, a number of dopamine 
antagonists/partial agonists have been shown to be superior to lithium or 
valproate alone (I). Combination treatment can be considered especially 
when patients show break-through mania with the first agent.

GABA modulators (benzodiazepines) are useful adjunctive agents and can 
induce sedation or sleep (II).

ECT is an important treatment option in cases of delirious mania, since 
this may be a medical emergency, and in treatment of resistant mixed 
states.

Discontinuation of short-term treatments for mania can be considered after 
full remission of symptoms. The required duration will often be of the 
order of 12 weeks although higher doses may be reduced earlier (IV).

Key uncertainty

•

Switch to depression after mania may occur in any illness course: it is not 
established which treatments, if any, make this more likely.

Dopamine antagonists/partial agonists (Antipsychotic drugs)—Mania can 
develop extremely quickly and incur risks both for the patient and for others. In its more 
severe form, mania is almost invariably treated with dopamine receptor antagonists/partial 
agonists and patients with psychotic mania were among the first patients treated successfully 
with chlorpromazine. Dopamine receptor antagonists/partial agonists are antimanic not 
simply sedative. However, despite their widespread use by an earlier generation of 
psychiatrists, placebo controlled data to show that the older dopamine antagonists (“first 
generation” antipsychotics) were effective in mania were very limited before the turn of the 
century (e.g. II, (Johnstone et al., 1988)). This changed when placebo controlled studies of 
new drugs included haloperidol as a comparator.

While the neurobiology of mania is still poorly understood, mania may be a 
hyperdopaminergic state appropriately treated by blockade of dopamine D2/3 receptors with 
antagonists or partial agonists. This is a common effect of the anti-manic drugs described 
below. The detailed additional pharmacology is described for some of the drugs in the 
section on treating depression, because it may be more relevant for that indication.

A series of RCTs have been completed showing the efficacy for mania of aripiprazole, 
asenapine, cariprazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone and 
ziprasidone in comparison with placebo (Yildiz et al., 2011; Yildiz et al., 2015). Olanzapine, 
aripiprazole and ziprasidone are also available in parenteral formulations for acute use. 
Ziprasidone and cariprazine are not available in the UK.

The newer antipsychotic drugs were developed with a primary objective to reduce the 
incidence of extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS). Therefore their efficacy showed that an anti-
manic action could be achieved in the absence of EPS (II, (Keck et al., 2000)). This is an 
important clinical message, which should influence prescribing practice, for all dopamine 
antagonists.

The marketing of the newer drugs as ‘atypical’ implied a qualitative break from the past (the 
‘typical’ antipsychotics) in regard to EPS. This was misleading. The reduced tendency to 
produce EPS depends on dose and pharmacology. The use of muscarinic antagonists 
(antiparkinsonian medication) provides a proxy for clinically significant EPS. In head-to-
head studies (Rummel-Kluge et al., 2012), risperidone was associated with more use of such 
medication than clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. Quetiapine showed 
significantly less such use than olanzapine and risperidone. In addition, patients with bipolar 
disorder may be more at risk for EPS than patients with schizophrenia, for example when 
treated with high potency dopamine antagonists like haloperidol (Cavazzoni et al., 2006). 
Accordingly, successful treatment of mania without EPS is an important practical clinical 
objective that can be facilitated by differentiation between drugs that are anti-manic.

The relative efficacy and acceptability of the treatments for mania has been analysed using 
network meta-analysis or NMN (Cipriani et al., 2011; Yildiz et al., 2015). All the dopamine 
antagonists (and the partial agonist, aripiprazole), showed superiority to placebo. NMN 
demonstrated an order of relative superiority that ranked risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine 
and haloperidol at the top; haloperidol was less well ranked for acceptability (drop outs from 
trials). The network was highly coherent and so strongly supports the validity of the overall 
recommendation to use dopamine antagonist/partial agonists in mania. The individual 
rankings of drugs are of interest but show considerable overlap in confidence intervals.

Clozapine may also be considered by extrapolation from its likely superiority in treating 
psychosis (Leucht et al., 2013) and limited observational data in treatment resistant mania 
(Green et al., 2000; Li et al., 2015).

Other factors that influence the choice of drug include properties such as sedation, which 
may be desirable in the short term but not in the long term, and the choice of formulation. 
Finally, in the UK only aripiprazole is licensed for up to 12 weeks’ treatment of moderate to 
severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in young people (13 years and older).

The availability of parenteral formulations is valuable in emergencies and should form part 
of any local protocol for treating highly agitated patients (I, (Wilson et al., 2012)). In the 
past, often in an effort to achieve sedation, patients were habitually treated with high doses 
of, for example, haloperidol or droperidol (the latter now withdrawn in the UK), which could 
produce marked extrapyramidal symptoms unless combined with a muscarinic antagonist. 
When possible, such extrapyramidal adverse reactions should be avoided, even when 
managing an emergency.

If sedation is the aim, benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam and clonazepam are 
more appropriate and can usually produce adequate sedation. When prescribed regularly at 
night they may also facilitate the return of a normal sleep wake cycle (II (Post et al., 1996)).

Other medicines for acute mania: lithium, carbamazepine and valproate—
Acute treatment trials support the use of lithium, carbamazepine and valproate in mania 
(Yildiz et al., 2011; Yildiz et al., 2015). Network meta-analysis ranks them below the more 
efficacious dopamine antagonists (Cipriani et al., 2011), but their use may often be 
considered if planning their long-term continuation. Expert guidelines in the USA have in 
the past made lithium and valproate (“mood stabilizers”), their first line preference for mania 
for this reason (American Psychiatric Association, 2002).

The low therapeutic index of lithium means that lithium is usually commenced at a low dose 
and increased incrementally approximately every 5 to 7 days depending on results of serum 
lithium levels. Thus, one cannot usually start a patient on a therapeutic dose of lithium on 
the first day of treatment whereas this can often be achieved with a dopamine antagonist or 
partial agonist. The much improved evidence base for the use of the dopamine antagonists 
and partial agonists has resulted in a convergence of practice and experiment in their 
acceptance as first line for mania.

Valproate is the term that is often used to describe different formulations of valproic acid, 
the active chemical entity. Sodium valproate has been widely used in epilepsy and is also 
available in a sustained release formulation. Valproate semisodium (also known as 
divalproex) is a non-covalent dimer molecule (comprised of sodium valproate and valproic 
acid) which has been studied in bipolar disorder and is licensed in the UK as ®Depakote 
(see Annex for information on dosing of different formulations).

Valproate semisodium is effective in severe mania (II, (Macritchie et al., 2003)), when the 
dose should be titrated upwards quickly to get control: 750mg on day one and 20mg/kg+ on 
day two. Previous US Guidelines gave unusual weight to the efficacy data for valproate and 
the conviction that lithium and valproate are “mood stabilizers” (see below).

Exposure to valproate in utero is associated with developmental disorders and foetal 
malformations in women. Warnings against its use in women of child bearing potential, and 
the need for their informed consent if proposing to do so have been strengthened recently 
(https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/medicines-related-to-valproate-risk-of-abnormal-
pregnancy-outcomes).

The combination of a dopamine antagonist drug with lithium or valproate in 
acute mania—In practice, patients may already be taking lithium or valproate when mania 
occurs as a breakthrough during long-term treatment. Under these conditions it would be 
common to optimise the maintenance treatment and/or add a dopamine antagonist/partial 
agonist drug. Optimisation is favoured if symptoms are not severe, the history suggests that 
lithium or valproate has been effective until the current ‘breakthrough’, the current treatment 
is well tolerated and in the case of lithium the most recent plasma level suggests that a dose 
increase will not push the level above the upper limit of the normal therapeutic range. 
Otherwise, combination treatment with a dopamine antagonist/partial agonist will be 
favoured. Most patients included in trials which have compared combination/augmentation 
therapy versus monotherapy with lithium or valproate had prior treatment with lithium or 
valproate, whereas most participants in trials comparing combination/augmentation therapy

versus dopamine antagonist as monotherapy had not been on medications or were washed 
out from their previous medication before randomization (Ogawa et al., 2014). The clearest 
effect was demonstrated when the antipsychotic is added to lithium or valproate not the 
reverse. Also, in Swedish database studies, the impact of long-term combination treatment 
on violence was only seen when antipsychotics were added to mood stabilizers and not vice 
versa (Fazel et al., 2014). Thus, the asymmetry may be a consistent finding and reflect the 
greater acute efficacy of dopaminergic drugs.

The issue of long-term treatment with lithium and valproate will be addressed below. While 
it may seem logical to initiate one or other option in acute mania as a prelude to long-term 
continuation (in combination with a dopamine antagonist), there are no reasons to make this 
mandatory. Lithium in particular is sometimes difficult to use in exhausted, dehydrated 
patients. Moreover, efforts to prescribe lithium for patients with poor adherence may be 
misplaced. Patients very often stop taking lithium; the median time to discontinue was only 
6 months in Denmark (Kessing et al., 2007). Discontinuation is associated with admission to 
hospital (I, (Johnson and McFarland, 1996)). This association will be due, in large part, to 
relapse of mania, which can be provoked by abrupt lithium discontinuation. Unless patients 
are adherent to lithium therapy for a minimum of two years, these withdrawal effects will 
nullify any potential prophylactic effect (Goodwin, 1994).

Carbamazepine is not the optimal partner for combination therapy. Carbamazepine induces 
the metabolism of many other drugs and combinations are better avoided (Monaco and 
Cicolin, 1999). Alternatives, licensed for use in epilepsy and less likely to interact with other 
drugs, include oxcarbamazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate (rapidly converted to 
eslicarbazepine after oral administration). Eslicarbazepine acetate failed in trials on mania 
on primary but not all secondary outcomes in trials limited by high placebo response rates 
(Grunze et al., 2015). Thus, the use of alternatives to carbamazepine represents a plausible 
extrapolation, not well supported by direct evidence.

GABA modulators (benzodiazepines): Diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam and related 
agents are useful in the management of acutely agitated manic states (Allen et al., 2001). 
They are adjunctive, so are indicated when sedation or tranquillisation is a priority and when 
there is a pressing need to induce sleep. Their safety in relatively high sedative doses and the 
absence of important pharmacokinetic interactions with other agents are advantages.

The use of adjunctive GABA modulators can help to avoid excessive doses of antipsychotic 
drugs with the attendant risk of cardiovascular and other adverse reactions, including the 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

The switch into depression following mania: It is often stated that treatment with 
relatively selective and potent dopamine antagonists, like haloperidol, is more likely than 
treatment with lithium or valproate to result in a switch from mania to depression. This is 
also a reason that is sometimes given for preferring a drug with dopaminergic/serotonergic 
effects like olanzapine or risperidone. Evidence is very limited but one large, naturalistic 
study suggested switch rates of about 5% in the 12 weeks following initiation of treatment 
for mania (Vieta et al., 2009). Patients with previous depressive episodes, substance abuse

and illness severity were more at risk. The study was deliberately enriched for olanzapine 
(together with an assortment of other ‘atypical’ and ‘typical’ antipsychotic drugs, not 
specified). The choice of atypical drugs (usually implying a mixed dopaminergic/
serotonergic pharmacology) was associated with 10% fewer depressive relapses in 
confirmation of clinical impression. Controlled data for perphenazine (an older drug) 
supports the potential negative impact of some dopamine antagonists (Zarate and Tohen, 
2004); however, this was a small study and perphenazine’s pharmacology is not very 
different from the newer dopaminergic/serotonergic antagonists (http://
www.guidetopharmacology.org/). The data from the lamotrigine/lithium/placebo relapse 
prevention trials are a reminder that the risk of relapse of the index episode will usually be 
higher than the risk of switching (Goodwin et al., 2004).

At present, it would be unwise to base an acute treatment strategy on the assumed risk of 
switch to depression. However, high doses of dopamine antagonists, especially those with 
high affinity for dopamine receptors may cause akathisia and dysphoria and should be 
avoided (Mizrahi et al., 2007).

Discontinuation of short-term treatments: Doses of drugs used in short-term treatment of 
mania, particularly dopamine antagonists/partial agonists, should be reduced only after 
complete remission of symptoms, and preferably after 8 or more weeks of euthymia. 
Benefits of continuation of olanzapine and risperidone were still seen six months (but not 12 
months) after illness onset (Yatham et al., 2015a). As a precaution, doses should not be 
reduced abruptly but tapered over several weeks (IV).

Lithium or valproate, if used in treatment of an acute manic episode, are potentially a 
rational choice for long-term continuation. However, if either is to be discontinued after full 
remission of an acute manic episode, the same consideration applies. Lithium 
discontinuation should occur over a minimum of four, preferably 8 weeks, given the risk of 
premature relapse (Suppes et al., 1991). Tapering is also preferable to sudden 
discontinuation for valproate (IV) (Franks et al., 2008).

Adjunctive drugs used during short-term treatment of mania, particularly GABA modulators, 
should be reduced gradually once the symptoms for which they were prescribed (e.g. 
agitation, insomnia) have responded and in addition the underlying manic illness has 
responded to the primary anti-manic treatment.

All patients who have recovered from a manic episode, including their first manic episode, 
should consider subsequent maintenance treatment. The patient and clinician may decide to 
continue the drug that proved effective in the treatment of acute mania; this will often be a 
dopamine antagonist/partial agonist. However, consideration should also be given to 
switching to lithium (see below) (IV).

Short-term treatments of mixed states—Most treatment recommendations for mixed 
states (DSM-IV-TR) have resulted from sub-group or secondary analysis of data from trials 
in mania. Pooled data from acute efficacy trials of dopamine antagonists/partial agonists 
have not suggested important differences in sub-group effects (Baldessarini et al., 2003).

With the accumulation of new data fom acute (3–6 week) studies of dopamine antagonists 
(asenapine, olanzapine, paliperidone-ER, risperidone, and ziprasidone) and aripiprazole, 
either as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, versus placebo, meta-analysis has confirmed 
efficacy in treating acute mixed episodes with predominant manic symptoms (Muralidharan 
et al., 2013). Their efficacy in treating depressed episodes with mixed features remains 
unclear.

The demise of the mixed state diagnosis in favour of the extended specifier description will 
have implications for future trials, but as yet little has emerged that is of relevance to choice 
of treatment.

There is no indication to either start or continue treatment with an antidepressant in a mixed 
state (IV).

Electroconvulsive therapy—Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for 
manic patients who are severely ill, whose mania is treatment-resistant (including mixed 
states (Valenti et al., 2008)), who express a preference for ECT and patients with severe 
mania during pregnancy. Formal evidence for efficacy in mania is limited; patients with 
severe mania are difficult to enter into trials. However, audit findings of clinical practice 
support high rates of response and remission (Mukherjee et al., 1994). Indeed an earlier 
study suggested a 60% remission rate in manic patients who had previously responded 
poorly to lithium or dopamine antagonists/partial agonists (Black et al., 1987b). This 
observational data is strong and consistent enough to merit moderate ranking in the GRADE 
system.

It can be argued that ECT should be considered especially in cases of delirious mania, since 
this may be a medical emergency when accompanied by fever, dehydration, and autonomic 
dysfunction and in treatment of resistant mixed states (Medda et al., 2015).

In view of the polypharmacy common in bipolar disorder, vigilance is required because fit 
thresholds may be altered and the potential for either too brief or prolonged seizures during 
ECT increased.

It is more usual for ECT to be considered in depression (see below).

Comparison with NICE guidelines—There are no substantial differences between the 
conclusions of the NICE committee and ourselves regarding the treatment of an acute manic 
episode.

2  Short-term treatment of Depressive episodes

Quetiapine has the most convincing short-term efficacy and relapse 
prevention profile for bipolar depression (I). Olanzapine (in combination 
with fluoxetine and to a lesser extent as monotherapy) and lurasidone also 
have data supporting acute efficacy.

Antidepressant drugs approved for unipolar depression may be effective 
for treating depression in bipolar disorder but the evidence base is very

poor. The case is based primarily on extrapolation. They require co-
prescription of another agent that will reduce the risk of mania (lithium, 
valproate or dopamine antagonist/partial agonist drug) in bipolar I disorder 
(I).

Lamotrigine has evidence for acute efficacy and relapse prevention (I).

The risk of a switch to mania is greater for tricyclic antidepressants or 
other dual action medications, such as venlafaxine, than with SSRIs (II).

While they are unlikely to provoke a manic switch, lithium, valproate, and 
carbamazepine have poor evidence for acute efficacy in bipolar 
depression.

ECT has efficacy in treatment-resistant bipolar depression (II): other 
options have not been adequately studied.

Discontinuation of an antidepressant should follow BAP recommendations 
for unipolar depression, but with a more rapid taper in rapid cycling 
patients (IV).

Key uncertainties

There is a paucity of evidence to decide between different agents in the 
treatment of bipolar depression.

Refractory depression is not uncommonly associated with a bipolar illness 
course.

Folate may impair the response to lamotrigine.

Most data are for a bipolar I illness course: it is often uncertain whether 
the treatment of bipolar II and particularly the other specified bipolar 
disorder cases with depression should be different from the treatment of 
unipolar cases.

There may be a risk in bipolar II disorder, that antidepressants induce 
hypomania, mixed states or rapid cycling. It is uncertain whether this is 
mitigated by concurrent anti-manic medication.

The role of psychological treatments in bipolar depression remains 
uncertain, in the absence of replicated good quality evidence. Negative 
trials of CBT in bipolar disorder suggest caution in extrapolation of the 
approach from experience in unipolar depression.

Dopamine antagonist drugs (antipsychotic drugs) in bipolar depression—The 
use of dopamine antagonist drugs in bipolar depression has assumed increasing importance 
as doubt has grown over the role of conventional antidepressants. Efficacy can only be 
supported for specific agents, not for the class. This is because the relevant pharmacology is 
probably not antagonism at dopamine receptors per se. The affinities at other receptors are 
both multiple and varied (Michl et al., 2014). What among these properties confers 
antidepressant efficacy is not known. This is partly because not all drugs have been studied

equally for depression, so the data on which to map efficacy to drug action are very 
incomplete.

Most of the controlled data comes from studies of major depressive episodes in a bipolar I 
illness course. Where there is sufficient evidence from secondary analysis of bipolar II sub-
groups it will be noted in the following. Relapse prevention studies offer supporting 
evidence for acute efficacy. Such studies compare the effect of double blind continuation of 
an active drug with its discontinuation to placebo. The active drug is used to treat the index 
episode. Where the index episode is depression, the data will support efficacy in depression. 
Such designs will be relatively uninformative about preventing relapse to mania (and vice 
versa when the index episode is mania). All such studies are associated with high dropout 
rates, so that interpretation of drug/placebo differences over the longer term (the prevention 
of new episodes) will be problematic.

Quetiapine: In common with a number of other drugs for psychosis, quetiapine has 
moderate affinity for dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. At doses of 300 and 
600 mg/day it produced large and early attenuation of depressive symptoms in bipolar 
patients compared with placebo (Calabrese et al., 2005; Thase et al., 2006). Pooled analysis 
of these two similar trials, together randomizing nearly 1000 patients, showed effects in 
bipolar I and bipolar II participants (with slightly lower response rates to active treatment in 
the latter subgroup) (Weisler et al., 2008). The only concern about the relatively large effect 
sizes in these trials is the problem of unblinding, which must occur for quetiapine, owing to 
its sedating subjective effects. This justifies downgrading the trials in the GRADE system.

In relapse prevention studies of patients responding to quetiapine and randomized to 
continued quetiapine or switch to placebo, continuing quetiapine is associated with fewer 
episodes of mania, mixed mania and depression after recovery from either mania or 
depression (Suppes et al., 2013). This further supports the evidence for acute efficacy and, 
arguably, for relapse prevention (see below).

Current uncertainties relate to the dose: even 300mg produces substantial rates of 
somnolence and sedation, with associated dropout from treatment and the longer term risks 
of metabolic disturbance. After only 8 weeks there is evidence of weight gain and significant 
increases in triglycerides and blood glucose. While not of great importance in short-term 
treatment, these changes are an important signal to monitor and treat such problems in the 
medium to long term. There are important differences in metabolic impact between different 
dopamine antagonist drugs, and quetiapine appears to lie towards the more problematic end 
of the spectrum (Leucht et al., 2013).

Quetiapine may have unusual properties relative to other dopamine antagonists; one 
suggestion is that an active metabolite, nor-quetiapine, binds with moderate affinity to the 
noradrenaline transporter (Goldstein et al., 2007). This may contribute to its antidepressant 
action (Cross et al., 2015).

If norquetiapine is the active antidepressant agent, implications follow from the 
polypharmacy common in bipolar disorder. The nor-alkylation (N-desalkylation) is catalysed

primarily by CYP3A4. This enzyme may not only be inhibited, but also induced by other 
drugs (http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/table.htm). Relevant agents that block N-
desalkylation include fluvoxamine and norfluoxetine, and inducers include carbamazepine, 
modafinil, and St John’s wort. Thus, fluvoxamine increases quetiapine concentrations by 
159%, while carbamazepine can reduce them by 86% (Castberg et al., 2007); effects on 
norquetiapine concentrations have not been reported but might be the reverse depending on 
its route of metabolism.

Quetiapine has also been investigated and found effective in unipolar depression and 
generalized anxiety (Zhornitsky et al., 2011). Hence it would be misleading to think of it as 
a selective drug for bipolar depression: by the same token its efficacy in bipolar depression is 
not evidence for a biological difference between bipolar and unipolar depression although 
the effect size was larger in the bipolar trials.

Olanzapine: Olanzapine has affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, muscarinic and 
histamine receptors. Interest in the use of dopamine antagonists or partial agonists as 
monotherapy began when a large RCT showed that olanzapine had a weak antidepressant 
effect in bipolar I depression compared with placebo (Tohen et al., 2003). A second study 
has been pooled with the original data and also supports modest efficacy for olanzapine (I, 
(Tohen et al., 2013)). Its combination with fluoxetine in the original study showed even 
better separation from placebo. A relapse prevention study against placebo also supported 
efficacy against depressive relapse (Tohen et al., 2006).

Olanzapine is accordingly an option for the treatment of bipolar depression: its combination 
with fluoxetine will be discussed below. Similar considerations to those for quetiapine 
(sedation, unblinding) mean RCT evidence may have been subject to bias so downgrading 
its quality rating.

Lurasidone: Lurasidone is an antagonist at D2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors, and a partial 
agonist at 5-HT1A receptors. It has lower binding affinity for α2C and 5-HT2C receptors. It 
has been demonstrated to show efficacy in two short-term studies in bipolar depression: one 
as monotherapy and the other as add-on to lithium or valproate (Loebel et al., 2014a; Loebel 
et al., 2014b). Lurasidone has a low subjective adverse reactions burden and produced 
minimal changes in weight, blood lipids, or glycaemic control. The commonest reported 
adverse reactions are akathisia and somnolence. At the time of publication it did not have a 
license for use in bipolar depression in Europe, but has an indication for schizophrenia. In 
the US it has a license for the acute treatment of bipolar depression as well as schizophrenia.

Aripiprazole: Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors. Data on 
aripiprazole are of interest. In two 8-week monotherapy studies in bipolar depression, it 
failed to separate from placebo at the pre-specified 8-week endpoint although separation at 
earlier times was evident (Thase et al., 2008a). It has been conventional to accept this 
negative finding as definitive, along with the failure to demonstrate efficacy on the 
depressive pole in the existing relapse prevention study (Keck et al., 2007). However, the 
monotherapy studies in bipolar depression may have failed because of shortcomings in the

trial design and the relapse prevention study was clearly under-powered to detect effects on 
depressive relapse.

By contrast, in treatment-resistant unipolar patients two trials of adjunctive aripiprazole 
suggested antidepressant efficacy (Thase et al., 2008b). There is no comparable controlled 
evidence for refractory bipolar depression, but a small, uncontrolled case series claimed 
benefit from adding aripiprazole to a variety of other treatments (Ketter et al., 2006).

Any use of aripiprazole for bipolar depression is clearly an extrapolation from the unipolar 
data, but its dopamine partial agonist activity gives it modest plausibility as a treatment 
option with a different mode of action.

Cariprazine: Cariprazine is a highly selective dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist 
with preferential binding to D3 receptors. Its mechanism of action is therefore novel and of 
potential interest for the treatment of bipolar depression. Evidence for efficacy in bipolar 
depression has been published (Durgam et al., 2015a; Durgam et al., 2015b).

Antidepressants—Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for people with bipolar 
depression (35–40% prevalence in the POMH-UK audit). Their use is nevertheless 
controversial (Pacchiarotti et al., 2013). The usual criticisms are either that antidepressants 
lack efficacy in bipolar depression or they destabilize mood and cause switch to mania. This 
is undeniably contradictory since it seems to imply either too little or too much effect. 
Unfortunately, there is a real dearth of placebo controlled trials on which to make an 
evidence based recommendation. Meta-analysis a decade ago compared the few drugs 
tested, as a group, versus placebo (imipramine, fluoxetine and tranylcypromine). Most 
randomized data were obtained in patients also receiving lithium or valproate and, in 
aggregate, comparison with placebo supported efficacy for antidepressants in general 
(Gijsman et al., 2004). The STEP-BD trial weakened that conclusion (Sidor and Macqueen, 
2011), but did not contradict it. The exception was fluoxetine in combination with 
olanzapine, which has shown individual efficacy versus placebo and, modestly, lamotrigine 
(Brown et al., 2006; Tohen et al., 2003).

Recently there has been a double blind comparison of venlafaxine with lithium in bipolar II 
depression suggesting an important advantage to venlafaxine in continuation treatment 
(Amsterdam et al., 2015). This adds to other small studies in bipolar II patients suggesting 
an advantage for fluoxetine compared with lithium and provides the very limited evidence 
favouring the use of antidepressants in bipolar II disorder (McInerney and Kennedy, 2014). 
Expert opinion has also proposed SSRIs to stabilize mood in significant numbers of bipolar 
II patients (Parker et al., 2006). It is recommended that if an antidepressant is prescribed as 
monotherapy in bipolar II disorder, any increase in dose is gradual and that there be 
vigilance for, and early management of, any adverse reactions such as hypomania, mixed 
states or agitation (IV).

In contrast to the dearth of evidence in bipolar patients, there has been a very large number 
of trials examining the efficacy of antidepressants in unipolar major depression (I, 
(Anderson, 2001; Undurraga and Baldessarini, 2012)); these studies systematically excluded

patients with a bipolar illness course. The drugs tested enhanced noradrenaline and/or 
serotonin function by inhibiting monoamine re-uptake or metabolism. Hence their actions 
are likely to be rather homogeneous. The unipolar data support this: network meta-analysis 
shows major overlap of efficacy for SSRIs with venlafaxine, duloxetine and mirtazapine. 
Reboxetine, a selective noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitor, was the only clear outlier (Cipriani 
et al., 2009). Accordingly, the general finding of antidepressant efficacy in bipolar 
depression may be supported by the experience of treating unipolar depression. It means that 
the use of these drugs as a class in bipolar patients is essentially an extrapolation.

The anergic pattern of illness often seen in bipolar patients may favour the use of activating 
antidepressants such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (IV). It is usual to caution 
that while efficacy may be extrapolated for classes of drugs, adverse reactions may be less 
predictable. However, the extensive experience of using antidepressants in unipolar disorder 
means that this is not an important limitation, except potentially with the risk for switch to 
mania. If antidepressants can cause a switch to mania or the emergence of a mixed state, it 
seems further to imply efficacy, even if it is an argument against using antidepressants 
except with considerable vigilance.

Another approach to comparing unipolar and bipolar depression has been to audit the 
response to the same treatments in hospitalised patients (II, (Bottlender et al., 2001; Moller 
et al., 2001)): the severity of illness and times to response with tricyclic antidepressants 
appeared to be identical for bipolar and unipolar groups. Less positively, audit data from a 
very large Taiwanese database suggested that a poor response (usually to SSRIs) in first 
episodes of depression was predictive of a subsequent bipolar diagnosis (Li et al., 2012). 
This may imply that compared with unipolar patients, bipolar patients are simply more 
difficult to treat, but an equally plausible interpretation would be that antidepressants are less 
effective in the bipolar group (Goodwin, 2012). The issue is inevitably confounded in an 
observational study.

The view that we cannot safely extrapolate efficacy from unipolar to bipolar depression is 
widely held. There are several negative studies cited to support it. The STEP-BD study 
compared paroxetine and bupropion with placebo and the results were certainly negative 
(Sachs et al., 2007). However, whether this result represents a failure of the trial or of the 
active treatments is a moot point. The EMBOLDEN-II study compared two doses of 
quetiapine with placebo and included paroxetine as a comparator (McElroy et al., 2010). 
Paroxetine did not separate from placebo. However, half the patients in the study were 
treated with quetiapine, which arguably carries an appreciably higher risk of unblinding than 
paroxetine and this may have reduced the chances of finding a positive effect. Finally, 
agomelatine failed in a placebo controlled trial in which very high placebo response rates 
will have reduced assay sensitivity (Yatham et al., 2015b). Such negative studies provide a 
poor basis for the conclusion that antidepressants do not work at all in bipolar patients. 
Comparable studies can also fail in unipolar populations for a variety of technical reasons 
(Schalkwijk et al., 2014) and the studies themselves were powered to detect conventional 
positive effects, not to determine equivalence with placebo (non-inferiority).

The argument that antidepressants work in unipolar but not in bipolar depression also 
implies that there must be an important neurobiological difference between the two 
conditions. This is not expressed phenomenologically except in the sense that severity 
appears to increase across the bipolar spectrum (Moreno et al., 2012); one exception could 
be where depression emerges immediately out of a manic episode and the episode itself is 
effectively bipolar or mixed, but this is atypical. Neurobiological differences appear likely to 
be quantitative rather than qualitative (Redlich et al., 2015), although potentially of great 
interest. Indeed, if there are differences in the responsiveness to antidepressants between 
bipolar and unipolar groups, it provides a starting point for further dissection of how 
antidepressants work. For example, one hypothesis is that antidepressant action involves 
correction of negative emotional bias (Harmer et al., 2009); if bipolar subjects have less 
negative emotional bias, it might correlate with the reduced effectiveness of conventional 
antidepressants.

Anticonvulsants in depression—There is no basis for supposing antidepressant effects 
to be a class effect of anticonvulsant action. However, lamotrigine is of particular interest 
since it may offer important clues to common or unique mechanisms of action relevant to the 
development of new treatments.

Lamotrigine: Lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels in the brain, which 
may limit cell firing. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and is a weak 5-HT3 
receptor antagonist. It is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).

The efficacy of lamotrigine has been uncertain for acute bipolar depression. The original 
published study of lamotrigine suggested benefits in bipolar depression compared with 
placebo (Calabrese et al., 1999) and a second study was also supportive (III, (Frye et al., 
2000)). However, four previously unpublished trials conducted by GSK individually failed to 
show a separation from placebo. These negative findings appeared paradoxical when relapse 
prevention studies were positive (see below (Goodwin et al., 2004)). How can a drug prevent 
relapse to depression if it does not have efficacy in the acute episode?

A pooled analysis of the original patient data from all five trials was, in fact, able to show a 
modest benefit for lamotrigine in bipolar I and II patients with acute depression (I, (Geddes 
et al., 2009)). Further analysis of the patients with HAM-D scores of 24 and above at 
baseline showed, as predicted, a more substantial effect. By contrast, patients with scores 
below 24 at entry simply showed too high a placebo response to allow detection of an effect 
of the active treatment in any of the individual studies. These findings give limited support 
for the use of lamotrigine as a monotherapy treatment for bipolar depression.

The addition of lamotrigine to lithium proved effective in bipolar depression in an 
independent European study (van der Loos et al., 2009; van der Loos et al., 2011). This 
combination would have the additional theoretical benefit of combining two drugs with 
positive long-term data and complementary polarity indices (Popovic et al., 2012; Popovic et 
al., 2014). Similarly, in the CEQUEL trial of depressed bipolar patients already taking 
quetiapine, addition of lamotrigine showed both an early effect on depressive symptoms 
compared with placebo and important benefits for remission, sustained to 1 year of follow

(Geddes et al., 2015). Finally, an under-powered, open label comparison in treatment-
resistant bipolar depression also suggested benefits as an add-on compared with risperidone 
and inositol (Nierenberg et al., 2006).

The CEQUEL trial included a folate 500 microgm/placebo comparison as a factorial 
addition. It was expected that folate might augment treatment effects, but in fact the converse 
was the case. Folate impaired the response to lamotrigine. This effect is noted here because 
folate is believed to be neutral or beneficial for mood, and widely used in pregnancy, of 
course. Negative effects on mood might be an important adverse reaction to patients taking 
lamotrigine. The known interaction of lamotrigine with the enzyme DHFR, makes it more 
likely that the effect is real (and would implicate this pathway in its mechanism of action).

In summary, lamotrigine has established acute efficacy both as a monotherapy and in 
combination with lithium and quetiapine. The acute findings are supported by relapse 
prevention studies (see below). While the need to titrate the dose might seem likely to delay 
its onset of action, this was not evident in the acute trial data. Nevertheless, the slow titration 
may be a consideration in monotherapy when speed of action is a priority. Its low burden of 
adverse reactions mean unblinding in RCTs was unlikely and risk of bias low.

The presence of a recent rapidly unstable mood or a mixed state may be a particular reason 
to consider lamotrigine (IV).

Lamotrigine is uncommonly a single first-line agent in bipolar I but it can be considered in 
bipolar II on the basis of limited positive evidence, including benefit in rapid cycling 
patients (Bowden et al., 1999).

Valproate: In a recent review and meta-analysis, four small studies support an effect of 
valproate in bipolar depression (Smith et al., 2010). This accords with relapse prevention 
data for depression (see below). A larger, more convincing study is required to establish 
acute efficacy.

Lithium in depression—Treatment guidelines (Sachs et al., 2000) have repeatedly 
suggested an overwhelming expert preference for the use of lithium as first line treatment 
rather than antidepressants. However, the actual evidence for acute efficacy of lithium in 
bipolar depression, either as a sole agent or in combination with others, is disappointing (II, 
((Bhagwagar and Goodwin, 2002; Young et al., 2010)). Relapse prevention and anti-suicide 
effects are tangible benefits however (see below).

Dopamine agonists—The reported efficacy of cariprazine in controlled studies and the 
evidence for aripiprazole's efficacy in resistant depression suggests that dopamine agonism 
or partial agonism might be a potential mechanism of antidepressant action. The full agonist 
pramipexole has also been reported to show efficacy in small studies in treatment-resistant 
unipolar and bipolar depression (Dell'Osso and Ketter, 2013; Zarate et al., 2004). Adverse 
neurological reactions to dopamine agonists, well established in the treatment of Parkinson’s 
disease, include oro-facial and other dyskinesias and compulsive behaviours.

Modafinil: Modafinil has some antagonist affinity for the dopamine reuptake site and 
perhaps as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor. It elevates histamine concentrations 
in the brain. Its indication is as a wakefulness-promoting agent in narcolepsy, with additional 
clinical use in shift work sleep disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with 
obstructive sleep apnea. It has also been studied as the R-enantiomer (armodafinil). In 
bipolar depression (and unipolar disorder) there is very limited evidence for efficacy (Goss 
et al., 2013).

Ketamine—There is considerable interest in the potential for ketamine, a NMDA (N-
methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist, to be an important addition to treatment options in 
major depression (Abdallah et al., 2015). This is particularly the case in relatively 
Treatment-resistant cases. However, there is only limited evidence in bipolar depression for 
efficacy of a single intravenous dose of ketamine (as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers), not 
for remission. Ketamine's psychotomimetic effects tend to compromise study blinding and 
no studies so far have tried to control for this. The use of ketamine and other bipolar 
modulators has been the subject of a Cochrane review. (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/
10.1002/14651858.CD011611.pub2/epdf/standard). There are considerable uncertainties 
about how any acute benefit from ketamine, which is often clinically evident, can best be 
sustained. The obvious approach is to give repeat doses and to titrate response on an 
individual basis. The main concerns relate to the safety of repeat administration, which has 
not been systematically established. Ketamine is not widely available outside research 
centres in the UK.

Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) and Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS)—ECT is 
effective in severe depression: the relevant trials will have included bipolar cases, although 
trials exclusively in bipolar disorder did not exist before one important review (I, (The UK 
ECT Review Group, 2003)) and remain rare. However, in a recent study, ECT proved 
superior to an evidence-based drug treatment algorithm in a RCT in treatment-resistant 
bipolar patients (Schoeyen et al., 2015), although full remission was not much improved by 
ECT.

ECT’s efficacy against both poles of bipolar disorder predicts it would be a reasonable 
choice for patients with mixed features (bipolar or unipolar). As noted above, an 
observational cohort study that described high rates of response and remission to ECT in 
bipolar patients with a DSM-IV-TR defined mixed state (Medda et al., 2015) has supported 
this conjecture.

Beliefs about ECT in the general population appear to remain influenced by unfavourable 
media portrayal (Lebensohn, 1999) and this has not diminished (IV). While clinicians have a 
responsibility not to pander to ignorance and prejudice, it may be helpful to allay fears that 
ECT is often used against the will of individual patients (S). In fact it is unusual for ECT to 
be used without a patient's consent, and under mental health legislation, even in services 
with a high utilization rate; even then, outcomes appear reassuring (Wheeldon et al., 1999).

VNS has limited support for use in treatment-resistant depression: there is no specific role 
identified in bipolar disorder (Shah et al., 2014).

The risk of a switch to mania during treatment of a depressive episode—One 
short-term outcome of treatment for depression is a switch to mania. This may occur as a 
consequence of illness course or because some treatments have a greater potential to cause 
switching than others. Of course, clinically there is an obvious gradient between patients 
with highly variable mood and those with a much more episodic pattern. There have been 
few efforts to differentiate the treatment responses along this gradient, except by reference to 
‘rapid cycling’, which is an imprecise course specifier.

In a meta-analysis of patients without a previous history of mania, treatment with tricyclic 
antidepressants was twice as likely to result in a manic event as treatment with SSRIs or 
placebo (Peet, 1994)). In short-term bipolar treatment trials with antidepressants, switch 
rates were low but there was again a higher rate of switch for tricyclic antidepressants 
compared with other antidepressants (SSRIs in particular) (Gijsman et al., 2004). Fluoxetine 
plus olanzapine was effective in reducing depressive symptoms without provoking manic 
relapse (Tohen et al., 2003). However, a broader meta-analysis of the available data reached 
the pessimistic conclusion that drugs for unipolar depression may produce switching even in 
the presence of mood stabilizers, although the study could not exclude confounding effects 
as an alternative explanation (Tondo et al., 2010).

Venlafaxine may also increase the risk of switching patients, perhaps because of its action on 
serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake. In the Stanley network study, patients treated with 
venlafaxine switched to mood elevation (defined as a YMRS rating over 13) in 31% of case, 
compared with sertraline (15%) and bupropion (14%): response rates were similar at around 
50%, but there was no placebo control (Post et al., 2006). These rates are high which seems 
likely have been due to the inclusion of rapid cycling patients.

High quality naturalistic data has much to offer this question. Recent linkage of clinical data 
with prescribing data in Sweden suggested that monotherapy with drugs for unipolar 
depression is indeed associated with manic relapse in bipolar I patients, compared with 
combination with a mood stabilizer (Viktorin et al., 2014). There was no increase in the rate 
of manic relapse in patients taking lithium, valproate or carbamazepine. This employed a 
powerful within individual, longitudinal design to determine relative risk although patient 
numbers in the monotherapy group were small.

The naturalistic data, and clinical common sense suggest that a drug for mania in 
combination with the drug for depression may reduce the risk of a manic switch in depressed 
patients with a high risk of mania. The drug for mania could be lithium, valproate or a 
dopamine antagonist/partial agonist. The International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 
consensus on the use of antidepressants in bipolar patients highlighted the clinical consensus 
discouraging their use in patients with rapid cycling, depressive episodes with mixed 
features and as monotherapy (Pacchiarotti et al., 2013).

Discontinuation of long-term treatment for depression—There is uncertainty about 
the value of long-term treatment with antidepressants, so it is frequently implied that early 
discontinuation is desirable ((Montgomery et al., 2000)). This has been echoed more 
dogmatically in recent NICE guidance. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, in

this case, of short-term benefit (see also below). Indeed, the International Society for Bipolar 
Disorders Task Force report recommended to continue antidepressants over the long term in 
those who had had a relapse in depression after stopping antidepressants (Pacchiarotti et al., 
2013).

Both the antimanic and the antidepressant medicines should be terminated together if the 
intention is that treatment should be simply for an acute episode. Discontinuation of an 
antidepressant should follow recommendations in related BAP guidelines and taper over 4 
weeks if possible (Cleare et al., 2015). In particular, the possibility of adverse withdrawal 
effects should be discussed and reassurance offered.

Paradoxical manic episodes have been described during withdrawal of antidepressant drugs 
in patients with bipolar and unipolar depression (Narayan and Haddad, 2011).

In patients who do switch to mania during treatment, the antidepressant should be tapered 
and discontinued (consensus opinion).

Conclusions: the comparative efficacy and acceptability of different drugs for 
bipolar depression—NICE2014 used network meta-analysis to shape its 
recommendations. The analysis plan required a minimum sample size and handled each 
treatment separately. Most of the comparisons between treatments were indirect (via 
placebo). The conclusion was that six interventions were statistically superior to placebo 
(valproate>the combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine>lurasidone>quetiapine> 
olanzapine alone=lamotrigine). Other interventions that were included in the network but 
were not statistically superior to placebo were imipramine, lithium, moclobemide, 
paroxetine, and ziprasidone.

An independent approach to the same data combined the SSRIs and the tricyclic 
antidepressants for comparison with the better-studied treatments (Taylor et al., 2014). The 
exact order of the resulting ranks was different but not radically so. The question posed by 
this analysis is whether it can/should usefully inform clinical practice, since it depends so 
heavily on small studies and indirect comparisons. In discussion, our consensus group noted 
a number of contradictions. For example, SSRIs (which included paroxetine) ranked higher 
than quetiapine even though paroxetine was inferior to quetiapine in the only head-to-head 
trial (McElroy et al., 2010). In addition, venlafaxine was excluded from the analysis, 
because studies were not double blind, but appeared to have a relatively large effect 
(Vazquez et al., 2013). It was agreed that the limitations of the data prevented uncritical 
acceptance of final rankings, and new data might well change the outcome in the coming 
years. Nevertheless they provided a useful summary of where the field currently is, in all its 
weakness.

The most controversial issue was NICE2014’s endorsement of the use of fluoxetine, an 
antidepressant, with olanzapine. While this was a specific recommendation, there seems 
little reason not to regard fluoxetine as a representative SSRI. Therefore, to rank it first line 
is to rank SSRIs in general first line by extrapolation. In bipolar I patients antidepressants 
should then be prescribed only as an adjunct to anti-manic medications (not necessarily

olanzapine, of course). Opinion was divided between those inclined to accept this 
extrapolation and those who feel strongly that the limited bipolar depression data is 
inconclusive as it stands. Currently it is not possible to resolve these opposing views. 
However, given that there are limited options to treat bipolar depression, the group 
concluded that it was reasonable to consider a trial of an antidepressant in a patient with 
bipolar depression if other treatments with a stronger evidence base were ineffective or not 
tolerated. The group noted that the ISBD international task force, in trying to balance the 
same opposite opinions, did not broadly endorse antidepressant use, but acknowledged the 
experience that individual bipolar patients may benefit nevertheless. The frequent current 
use of antidepressants appears not to be proportionate to the established benefit in bipolar I 
patients. Their role in bipolar II patients is equally controversial.

The group noted that quetiapine has an unusual weight of evidence to support its use in 
adults with bipolar depression and may have a unique combination of pharmacological 
actions which account for this. It therefore merits first line status. Olanzapine, and 
lurasidone, may also be considered as options, though neither is currently licensed in Europe 
to treat bipolar depression. Lurasidone appears to have a more favourable metabolic profile 
than either quetiapine or olanzapine (Leucht et al., 2013).

There is little evidence to guide next step treatment if the first choice fails. Before resorting 
to strategies derived from unipolar patients with treatment resistant depression, the options 
shown to be effective in bipolar depression should be exhausted first, perhaps in 
combination.

The use of aripiprazole can only be by extrapolation, given the failed trials in bipolar 
depression, but cariprazine, also a dopamine partial agonist, has now shown efficacy in two 
studies (Durgam et al., 2015a; Durgam et al., 2015b). This seems to support the 
pharmacological argument that dopamine agonism (or partial agonism) contributes to 
antidepressant action.

Dopamine antagonists should not be regarded as potential options for the treatment of 
bipolar depression in the absence of appropriate trials.

Finally, lamotrigine has supportive data for an acute effect, notably from two independent 
adjunctive studies, which together with longer term data, should make it a more widely used 
option. It appears currently to be under-used outside expert centres.

Unlike NICE2014, the group did not see evidence to support psychotherapy alone for the 
treatment of depression. NICE2014 made a distinction between primary and secondary care 
implying that there are mild cases of bipolar disorder that can be managed with 
psychological treatment alone. It may apply to young people with possible diagnoses of 
bipolarity, mild symptoms (and a good prognosis). However, the prominent endorsement of 
psychological treatments for bipolar disorder, without qualification, as ‘Key priorities for 
implementation’ goes well beyond the evidence. The partial way in which the data appears 
to have been reviewed by NICE2014 to justify their conclusions has also been highlighted 
(Jauhar et al., 2016).

Lithium remains the most effective treatment preventing relapse and 
admission to hospital in bipolar I disorder (I). Lithium should be 
considered for all patients with bipolar I disorder willing to take it reliably 
(S).

Lithium prevents relapse to mania and, less effectively, depression (I). The 
highest dose that produces minimal adverse reactions and effects should 
be employed. Concentrations below 0.6 mmol/l are potentially too low to 
be fully effective and adverse reactions and effects become important 
above 0.8 mmol/l. Lithium may be effective in a minority of patients as 
monotherapy (I).

Lithium reduces the risk of suicide (I).

Valproate as monotherapy has limited trial data, is somewhat less effective 
than lithium in the prevention of relapse and should not usually be 
considered for women of child bearing potential (I).

Carbamazepine as monotherapy is less effective than lithium, has little if 
any effect on relapse to depression and is liable to interfere with the 
metabolism of other drugs (I).

Lamotrigine is effective against depression in long-term treatment (I) and 
should be considered where depression is the major burden of the illness 
(IV).

Dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists reduce the risk or 
relapse and admission in long-term treatment (I). Relative effects on the 
manic and depressive poles of the illness appear to depend on the complex 
pharmacology of the drugs but may be predicted by acute treatment 
effects.

Antidepressants to which patients have shown an acute treatment response 
may, appropriately, be continued long term when the risk of a severe 
depressive relapse is high (III). In bipolar I disorder, they should be used 
in combination with a medicine that has long-term antimanic efficacy (II).

Discontinuation of long-term treatment is not indicated when there is good 
clinical control of the illness. When it is necessary, it should be tapered 
(IV). In the case of lithium there is a specific risk of manic relapse if it is 
discontinued within a two-week interval (I). Poor adherence is a contra-
indication to lithium because of the risk of new illness episodes on 
discontinuation (I).

Key uncertainties

There is uncertainty in relation to the effects of short-term treatment on 
day-to-day or week-to-week mood stability.

Successful long-term management often appears to require combination 
treatment (III). Combination of lithium with valproate, or quetiapine with 
lithium or valproate is superior to monotherapy. At present there is little to 
guide practice other than safety concerns and pragmatic outcomes in 
individual cases.

The long-term value of antidepressants is not sufficiently established.

Extrapolation of long-term strategies for bipolar I disorder to bipolar II or 
the bipolar spectrum remains speculative.

Bipolar disorder tends to be a long-term, indeed, life-long challenge. At present the 
preferred strategy to prevent relapse is for continuous rather than intermittent treatment with 
oral medicines, to prevent new mood episodes. That means a negotiated decision to take one 
or more medicines for the long term – in effect, indefinitely. Such a decision is best made 
when patients are in remission, and ideally, the evidence for the efficacy and safety of any 
treatment should have been established over long periods of time. In practice, controlled data 
may cover much shorter periods of time, and for that reason NICE have been resistant to 
considering the data from such trials. As already explained, we take a more nuanced view, 
especially where practice can be supported by naturalistic data and clinical experience.

There is now good naturalistic data from Denmark that, for patients treated with lithium, 
starting early in the illness course is more often associated with a very good outcome than 
those starting later (Kessing et al., 2014). There is no RCT data to support the validity of this 
finding but its plausibility supports the intention to initiate treatment early in the bipolar 
illness course. However, the study illustrates the population challenge because under 20% of 
patients started on lithium early remained without relapse at 10 years follow up. Early 
relapse (within two years) was the rule.

The central problem is that, whatever the intention, adherence to long-term treatment 
appears to be poor (Kessing et al., 2007). To underline this point, about 40% of bipolar 
patients who commit suicide are not receiving long-term lithium or valproate (Clements et 
al., 2013). For this reason, early psychoeducation should receive high priority in clinical 
management. With rational psychopharmacology, it appears to work in practice to improve 
outcome (Kessing et al., 2013).

Medicines with putative efficacy against depressive and (hypo)manic relapse are sometimes 
described as mood stabilizers. We do not favour this terminology because it implies equal 
efficacy in the prevention of depression and mania (which is not seen with most drugs) and 
does not refer to a mechanism of action. In fact, the long-term use of a variety of agents 
alone or in combination may contribute to mood stability.

The management plan must incorporate additional flexible treatment when an acute stressor 
is imminent or present, early symptoms of relapse (especially insomnia) occur, or anxiety 
becomes prominent. Higher doses of long-term treatments or, perhaps more simply, short-
term add-ons (e.g. GABA modulators) will be necessary. The focus will often be sleep 
disturbance, so the patient may keep a benzodiazepine or other hypnotic in small supply.

Dopamine antagonists/partial agonists may also be kept on hand with the doctor’s 
agreement, and, if taken at the onset of a manic episode, may reduce its severity. It may also 
be agreed that the patient can increase the doses of their other medicines under specific 
circumstances. This approach serves two purposes: the individual is more likely to comply 
with the treatment regimen if they feel they have greater control, and they can also take 
immediate action, when it may otherwise take too long to get an appointment with their 
psychiatrist.

Finally, if a patient has accepted treatment for several years and remains well, they should 
still be strongly advised to continue indefinitely, because the risks of relapse remain high. 
This can be concluded from the findings in several small studies of lithium responders. Even 
when lithium withdrawal was supervised and intended to be slow, relapse was much more 
common in the withdrawn group (Biel et al., 2007; Yazici et al., 2004). That said, patients 
may, of course, decide to discontinue long-term treatment. This may be most propitious 
when they have made a full recovery from their last episode, have had no bipolar episodes in 
the preceding four years, have no history of severe consequences from mania or bipolar 
depression and no previous history of cycling with many bipolar episodes. Naturalistic data 
certainly suggest that patients with residual symptoms have significantly worse outcomes, so 
drug discontinuation in a poor prognosis group would not be rational (Judd et al., 2008; 
Angst et al., 2003). Whatever the circumstances, short-term support and a management plan 
to recognise and treat early warning signs of mania or depression will be necessary.

Long-term treatment with Lithium—Lithium occupies a particularly important place in 
the management of bipolar I disorder. Thus, the strongest evidence among medicines that are 
often referred to as mood stabilisers for bipolar I disorder is still for lithium. Lithium 
certainly prevents relapse to mania and depression.

Adequate numbers of patients have been randomized into placebo-controlled short-term or 
‘maintenance’ trials of lithium treatment dating from soon after its introduction (I, (Burgess 
et al., 2001)), and more recently when lithium has been a reference compound for other 
treatments (Severus et al., 2014). The relative risk of relapse on lithium over a year or more 
was 0.6 compared with placebo. So of 753 patients on lithium 258 (34%) relapsed; of 827 
on placebo, 467 (56%) relapsed. That means in general that one would need to treat about 5 
patients for about a year with lithium to avoid one relapse.

Considering relapse to either pole of the illness individually, there was a greater relative 
reduction in the risk of manic relapses (0.5) compared with depressive relapses for lithium 
(0.7-.8). In fact, on current evidence, lithium is only modestly effective in protecting against 
depressive relapse (Severus et al., 2014).

The largest study of lithium to date was a double-blind comparison of switching to lithium 
or placebo in patients who responded acutely to quetiapine (Weisler, 2014). A post hoc 
analysis suggested that a lithium level of 0.6 mmol/L or higher was more effective than 
lower doses for Li monotherapy maintenance in the prevention of relapse (Nolen and 
Weisler, 2013). There has been uncertainty over the years about whether single daily dosing 
is safer than more frequent dosing regimes. Twice daily, versus once daily dosing of lithium

gives sustained higher minimum concentrations and this has been linked to more 
pathological renal changes on biopsy (and a higher risk of polyuria (Carter et al., 2013)). 
Given the advantage for adherence of once daily dosing, we recommend once daily night 
time dosing for lithium (IV).

Lithium concentrations in blood should be regularly monitored. How regularly is open to 
debate. This is problematic because failure to follow guidance may have legal implications 
for doctors. NICE2014 recommended measurement every 3 months for the first year of 
treatment and every 6 months thereafter (with a number of exceptions). Doctors should 
probably try to adhere to this recommendation. In reality, however, an annual check of all 
relevant blood indices is probably adequate in stable, physically healthy patients (McKnight 
et al., 2012). It is unclear whether the common failure to do any monitoring at all in some 
services is affected by what frequency is actually recommended.

Vigilance and increase monitoring is required when patients become physically ill or when 
they add medications with the potential to modify the clearance of lithium (non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, for example).

Long-term treatment with anticonvulsants—There is no basis as yet for equating 
anticonvulsant action with ‘mood stabilization’, as has sometimes been claimed (Post et al., 
1998). Anticonvulsants have a heterogeneous pharmacology and there is no evidence to 
suggest a class effect, such that anticonvulsants stabilize mood. Thus, valproate, 
carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate are all anticonvulsants with different 
modes of action. In the case of the latter two compounds, there is almost no reliable 
evidence at all favouring their use either in acute mood episodes or to prevent relapse. 
Specifically, for gabapentin and topiramate controlled studies in acute mania were negative 
(gabapentin I, (Pande et al., 2000); topiramate I, (Kushner et al., 2006)). There remains some 
interest in using topiramate for weight reduction in obese bipolar patients (Chengappa et al., 
2006).

Valproate: Valproate is often referred to, with lithium, as a mood stabilizer. Data on 
valproate are much more limited than that for lithium, however. The comparison with 
placebo is driven by a single RCT of valproate (as valproate semisodium, ®Depakote), 
which showed rates for all relapse of 24% against placebo at 38%. This suggests an absolute 
risk reduction of about 15%, numerically comparable with lithium (22%) but statistically 
non-significant. In fact the effect for depressive relapse was higher than for mania in this 
study (Cipriani et al., 2013c). The BALANCE trial specifically compared valproate, lithium 
and the combination in a randomized, non-blind maintenance study with a run in on the 
combination treatment to minimize drop-outs after randomization. Lithium alone and in 
combination with valproate was superior to valproate alone (Geddes et al., 2010). 
Nevertheless, observational data supports an effect for valproate not much less than lithium’s 
in practice

Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine was the first agent after lithium to be advocated for long-
term treatment of bipolar disorder (II, review by (Okuma and Kishimoto, 1998)). It has been

re-examined in two other trials, which showed a substantial benefit with lithium compared 
with carbamazepine in preventing relapse (I, (Greil et al., 1997; Hartong et al., 2003)).

Lamotrigine: Two maintenance trials of lamotrigine as monotherapy supported an effect 
against depression, not mania (I, (Goodwin et al., 2004)). The samples were enriched for 
lamotrigine responders, and compared lamotrigine, lithium and placebo. In one, the index 
episode was mania and, in the other, depression. The results from both trials are mutually 
supportive in showing an advantage for lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of depression. There 
was a comparable advantage to lithium for prophylaxis of mania. There was no excess of 
depressive episodes in lithium treated patients nor manic episodes in lamotrigine treated 
patients compared with placebo. Indeed for both agents there was a trend towards effects 
against the opposite pole of the illness. Thus, neither provoked mood instability to the 
opposite polarity. CEQUEL also demonstrated benefit over 12 months for combination 
treatment with lamotrigine (Geddes et al., 2015).

Long-term treatment with Dopamine antagonists/partial agonists—Dopamine 
antagonists/partial agonists have long been used in bipolar outpatients as long-term 
treatment. They have been prescribed for some patients in depot formulations, either as 
monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Before the development of the newer 
dopamine/serotonin antagonists and partial agonists, their use was poorly supported by 
formal evidence for patient benefit. There is a clinical impression that the newer agents offer 
advantages because they are less likely to produce dysphoria or provoke depressive relapse

Most of the newer, so-called second-generation dopamine antagonists/partial agonists have 
been studied in relapse prevention trial designs. Such studies enrich the study sample for 
acute responders to the drug of interest, and the active drug may be withdrawn abruptly, 
which risks amplifying any drug/placebo difference with withdrawal effects. This can be 
inferred from an excess of early relapses seen for example in a study of this design with 
olanzapine (Tohen et al., 2006). Therefore such studies, with occasional exception, primarily 
support short to medium-term use.

Use in the longer term is mainly an extrapolation, albeit supported by strong naturalistic 
data. Comparison of rates of hospital admission on and off treatment over four years, are 
strongly supportive of efficacy for lithium (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI: 0.62; 0.70), 
valproate (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.67; 0.79), lamotrigine (HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73; 0.84), 
olanzapine (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71; 0.82), and quetiapine (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75; 0.89)
(Joas et al., 2016). Lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, olanzapine, and quetiapine (but not 
lamotrigine) treatment periods were associated with reduced rates of manic episodes. 
Lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, quetiapine, and olanzapine (but not carbamazepine) were 
associated with reduced rates of depressive episodes. Lithium only was associated with 
reduced rates of mixed episodes.

Olanzapine: Olanzapine has been studied as a comparator to depot risperidone and showed 
a reduction in manic and depressive relapse (Vieta et al., 2012). There was no enrichment for 
olanzapine responders so, notwithstanding a dropout rate of 40-50% over 18 months, this 
trial offers good evidence for patient benefit as a maintenance treatment. Olanzapine was

also slightly superior to lithium as monotherapy after acute response to the combination of 
lithium with olanzapine but produced significant excess weight gain (Tohen et al., 2005; 
Zarate and Tohen, 2004). This study suggests that olanzapine prevents early manic relapse 
after lithium withdrawal, although the lithium dose was tapered over 4 weeks to prevent very 
early withdrawal effects.

Quetiapine: Quetiapine has been shown to be effective as monotherapy, and in combination 
with lithium or valproate (Suppes et al., 2009), in the prevention of relapse to either pole of 
the illness. These findings are consistent for patients entering treatment from either pole of 
the illness. The doses employed in trials were high (300-600mg/day) and in the monotherapy 
trial the median dose was 546mg/day (Weisler et al., 2011).

Lurasidone: Lurasidone may prove useful in bipolar depression (see above). Its long term 
use is supported by a relapse prevention study in which 28 weeks of continued treatment 
with adjunctive lurasidone was associated with a trend significant risk reduction in time to 
recurrence of any mood event compared with placebo plus lithium or valproate, and a 
significant reduction in time to recurrence of a depressive episode. Patients entered the study 
and were stabilized from either pole of the illness (Calabrese et al., 2015).

Aripiprazole, ziprasidone, paliperidone: Aripiprazole was more effective than placebo 
after acute and continuation treatment of mania: acute withdrawal of the aripiprazole did not 
produce an excess of early relapse in this study (Keck et al., 2007). Ziprasidone has positive 
adjunctive data (Bowden et al., 2010) and paliperidone only proved effective preventing 
mania (Berwaerts et al., 2012).

Dopamine antagonists/partial agonists may be appropriate for the long-term management of 
bipolar patients especially where non-mood congruent psychotic features are prominent.

Dopamine antagonists/partial agonists may be useful in difficult-to-treat cases of rapid 
cycling (III, e.g.(Lowe and Batchelor, 1986; Carvalho et al., 2014)). When added to usual 
treatment, principally with lithium or anticonvulsants, combination with clozapine was 
superior to usual treatment alone over one year in treatment–resistant bipolar patients 
including those with rapid cycling and mixed states (II, (Suppes et al., 1999)), but rapid 
cycling remains a major clinical challenge. Secondary analysis of the acute depression 
studies with quetiapine suggest efficacy in the short term for rapid cyclers (Vieta et al., 
2007), but the real problem is long-term stability.

A small pilot study of vagal nerve stimulation is also compatible with some benefit in 
resistant rapid cycling patients, a very disabled group (Marangell et al., 2008).

Long acting dopamine antagonists: Various long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics 
are available, including fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, olanzapine pamoate, 
risperidone microspheres, paliperidone palmitate, and aripiprazole monohydrate. Their 
primary indication is in the treatment of psychosis, but logically, LAIs could be used in 
bipolar patients where the treatment plan is continuation of treatment with dopamine 
antagonists, but adherence to oral medication is poor. Evidence to support their use in

bipolar disorder is very limited (Bond et al., 2007; Gigante et al., 2012). The data for long-
acting injectable risperidone is consistent in being positive for preventing mania, not 
depression (Quiroz et al., 2010; Vieta et al., 2012).

When switching from an oral drug to an LAI form, it is good practice to start with the oral 
antipsychotic for the length of time required to establish the effective, best tolerated dose 
before switching to the LAI form (Llorca et al., 2013).

Long-term treatment with antidepressants—Whether or not antidepressants should 
be used long term in bipolar disorder remains uncertain. One small maintenance study (II, 
(Prien et al., 1984)) has had an important influence because it suggested that the treatment of 
bipolar patients with imipramine alone resulted in an unacceptable number of manic relapses 
over a one to two year follow up period. This effect was prevented by co-treatment with 
lithium. It supports the recommendation that monotherapy with antidepressants is unwise in 
patients with bipolar I disorder.

Long-term treatment of bipolar I patients with antidepressants is common in clinical 
practice. Given the significant burden of disease imposed by chronic depressive symptoms 
and recurrent depressive episodes, this may not be surprising. The evidence supporting their 
use in the long-term prophylaxis of unipolar depression is strong (I, (Geddes et al., 2003)). 
The equivalent evidence for bipolar patients is almost non-existent. There is non-random 
evidence for successful short-term prophylaxis with antidepressants drugs in bipolar patients 
also receiving combination treatments such as lithium, valproate, carbamazepine and 
antipsychotics (Altshuler et al., 2001; Altshuler et al., 2003). But the patients in whom this is 
evident are about 10% of the total sample included. These and the few other relevant 
findings are far from compelling (Ghaemi et al., 2001; Pacchiarotti et al., 2013). Clinicians 
will have to use clinical judgement in deciding whether an individual patient should continue 
with an antidepressant

The uncontrolled and audit experience of using antidepressants is substantial, and, of course, 
applies to real clinical populations. As others have commented, some guidelines for the 
treatment of acute bipolar depression have gone too far in their proscription (Moller and 
Grunze, 2000).

Bipolar II patients and, in particular, patients with bipolar spectrum depression have not 
been sufficiently investigated. Anecdotally, it is possible that effective treatment with 
antidepressants is possible without an additional anti-manic drug (Parker et al., 2006). This 
is an area that merits further investigation, as the diagnostic issues become more widely 
understood.

The comparative efficacy and acceptability of different drugs for long-term 
treatment—Network meta-analysis of long-term treatments suggests comparable efficacy 
for most of the drugs described above (Miura et al., 2014). However, the value of the 
quantitative comparisons was limited by the design weaknesses already described. Lithium, 
olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone LAI and valproate prevented manic relapse. Only 
lamotrigine, lithium and quetiapine were convincingly shown to prevent depressive relapse.

Long-term treatment: winning combinations—For perhaps too long, monotherapy 
with lithium was believed to be the best treatment for bipolar disorder. It was speculated in 
previous editions of this guideline that effective prevention of progression to frequent relapse 
or chronicity may require combination treatment from quite early in the illness course. 
Increasingly, combinations of agents are being prescribed for the majority of patients who 
fail on monotherapy. They will derive from apparently effective combinations used to 
control acute symptoms. Indeed

There is a strong evidence base to support the combination of a dopamine antagonist/partial 
agonist plus lithium or valproate to treat acute mania that has not responded adequately to 
lithium or valproate in monotherapy (Ogawa et al., 2014). However, there are only a limited 
number of studies that compare long-term monotherapy versus combination treatment.

Two RCTs have shown that, when acute mania or depression responds to the combination of 
quetiapine with valproate or lithium, then continuing the combination, versus switching to 
lithium/ valproate monotherapy, is associated with a lower rate of relapse of both depression 
and mania (Vieta et al., 2008; Suppes et al., 2009). For olanzapine (Tohen et al., 2004) and 
aripiprazole (Marcus et al., 2011), a single RCT has shown that, when the combination of 
either drug with lithium or valproate is effective in treating acute mania, then continuing the 
combination is associated with a lower risk of manic relapse than switching to lithium or 
valproate alone. The BALANCE study showed that over 2 years valproate monotherapy was 
inferior to both lithium monotherapy and valproate/ lithium combination in terms of total 
relapses (Geddes et al., 2010). However combination treatment, compared to monotherapy, 
carries a greater risk of medication side effects.

Maintenance ECT—Continuation and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is 
sometimes currently employed in patients who have failed pharmacotherapy but responded 
to an acute course of ECT. The evidence for this approach consists of case reports and 
retrospective chart reviews, with little focus on bipolar disorder per se (Frederikse et al., 
2006; Petrides et al., 2011). There are supportive chart reviews for patients with bipolar 
disorder (Santos Pina et al., 2015).

Suicide—As a rule, suicide is associated with depression, and risk assessment should 
always be emphasized during acute episodes of depression in bipolar patients. Assessment 
of suicide risk should be as for other depression diagnoses and should follow widely 
accepted principles of good clinical practice (Hawton, 1987). Suicidality will often be 
related to illness severity and may guide the need for admission. Suicide in bipolar patients 
is a risk that persists across the lifespan.

There have been reports of suicidal acts in association with antidepressant treatment in 
younger people. Whether these are caused by antidepressants has been the subject of 
considerable hype, but appears unlikely (Gibbons et al., 2015). One speculation was that this 
might be more likely in undiagnosed bipolar depression. However, the onset of suicidality in 
bipolar patients was not associated with the use of antidepressants in the STEP-BD study, 
although the numbers were small (Bauer et al., 2006c).

Adverse reactions to long-term treatment—Weight gain is a major problem 
associated with the use of many of the medicines offered long term to bipolar patients 
(Torrent et al., 2008). The use of olanzapine and quetiapine is particularly associated with 
unfavourable metabolic indices, especially when the patient population is obese (Lieberman 
et al., 2005). Efforts are necessary to alert patients to the need both to maintain normal levels 
of exercise and moderate calorie intake. While this has traditionally been a cosmetic 
concern, strongly felt by patients, it has important medical implications particularly related 
to the risk of future cardiovascular disease (see BAP guideline on the management of weight 
gain and metabolic disturbances associated with psychosis and antipsychotic drug 
treatment).

A rise in serum prolactin caused by dopamine receptor antagonism, is a frequent and 
neglected problem (Pacchiarotti et al., 2015). It may lead to secondary hypogonadism 
(Howes et al., 2007) and low bone mineral density (BMD), the most important risk factor for 
osteoporotic fractures. Lifetime risk of such fractures for women in the general population is 
already high at approximately 50%. Decreased BMD and increased fracture risk have been 
shown in patients with severe mental illness (Howard et al., 2007; Meyer and Koro, 2004; 
Lehman and Meyer, 2005). Prolactin and gonadal function are hardly ever assessed in 
women on dopamine antagonists, BMD is not measured, and osteoporosis remains 
undiagnosed, let alone prevented or treated. All pre-menopausal women on amisulpride and 
most on risperidone (including at low doses) are at risk of amenorrhoea, low or undetectable 
oestradiol concentrations and many will also have low BMD. Hence, prevention and 
treatment of osteoporosis must become a target for improvement in physical health of 
potentially neglected populations of patients.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains a concern for patients treated long term with dopamine 
antagonists/partial agonists (Keck et al., 2000). Acute EPS are still regarded as a predictor of 
subsequent TD, and are probably more common in bipolar patients (Gao et al., 2008). Hence 
the lower EPS associated with the use of the lower potency dopamine /serotonin antagonists 
and the use of the drugs like haloperidol at lower doses should reduce the long term risk. 
Current data on TD are supportive if not conclusive of much reduced risks with the newer 
agents (O'Brien, 2015).

Conclusions—Like NICE2014, the group highlighted the superior evidence base for 
lithium and the need for its advantages to be emphasized in training and practice.

In view of the long term problem of depressive symptoms in bipolar patients, the potential 
role of lamotrigine and its currently low rates of utilization in most NHS centres have been 
highlighted. In contrast, the common long-term use of antidepressants appears less easy to 
justify on the basis of the evidence.

NICE2014 was more restrictive in it recommendations for long-term treatment with 
dopamine antagonists/partial agonists (Table 7). Naturalistic data supports a broad range of 
efficacy for these medicines. Moreover, in an individual patient, if a medicine leads to 
prompt remission from the most recent manic or depressive episode, this may be considered 
evidence favouring long-term use as monotherapy (IV). Because effective in the short term,

this may lead to their preferential use; active consideration of lithium as a better alternative 
should be promoted.

However, the greatest challenge is the early adoption of a long-term treatment strategy 
acceptable to patient and family. The complex need for access to a responsive and intelligent 
clinical service, psychoeducation and relevant behavioural change, adherence to prescribed 
medicines and informed prescribing is difficult to meet within current services for too many 
patients.

Specific Psychological interventions for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder

Psychoeducation is the preferred or ‘first line’ psychological intervention.

Uncritical endorsement of CBT as a generic method for relapse prevention 
in bipolar disorder is not justified.

In general, psychological interventions appear to demonstrate efficacy

Efficacy and feasibility of on line psychological intervention

Group and individual Psychoeducation: As already indicated, we recommend 
psychoeducation as the preferred or first line psychological intervention.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): While bipolar patients share many of the common 
cognitive distortions and attitudes described in unipolar patients (II, (Scott et al., 2000)), a 
cognitive model is not convincing as a complete theory of the illness. Nevertheless, cognitive 
theories can fruitfully address some specific problems bipolar patients bring to treatment. 
Therapy derives pragmatically from clinical experience with bipolar patients (review by 
(Scott, 1996)). A preliminary trial in 42 subjects suggested that CBT could speed recovery 
from depression and prevents the cascade of isolated manic symptoms into full-blown 
episodes (Scott et al., 2001). A formal trial of CBT for currently euthymic bipolar patients 
produced important reductions in rates of syndromal relapse, depression symptom reduction, 
less mania symptom fluctuation and higher social functioning over a one-year period 
compared with treatment as usual (Lam et al., 2003). The study targeted patients who had 
taken mood stabilisers and were still suffering from frequent relapses. Compared with 
treatment as usual, such enhancement of clinical care appeared to be helpful. Treatment 
included components of education, motivation to take medicines reliably, self-monitoring, 
active relapse prevention measures and problem solving. Action plans and modification of 
behaviours often do not depend solely on the patient to recognize abnormal mood states. 
Disappointingly, the findings from the Lam study were not replicated in a larger, more 
pragmatic CBT study, which showed no benefit at all for a large sample of patients versus 
treatment as usual (Scott et al., 2006). A secondary analysis suggested that patients earlier in 
their illness course were slightly more likely to show benefit – as for psychoeducation (see

below). Pilot data in an early onset group also weakly support this conclusion (Jones et al., 
2015b). Negative findings for CBT include evidence for equivalence to a cheaper group 
psychoeducational approach (Parikh et al., 2012) and a simpler supportive individual 
approach (Meyer and Hautzinger, 2012).

Resources for complex psychotherapy are always likely to be limited and provision should 
be focused on those patients most likely to benefit. Patients with particularly severe personal 
and social disturbance early in their illness course should probably be given priority access. 
Uncritical endorsement of CBT as a generic method for relapse prevention in bipolar 
disorder is not justified.

Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT): The principles of IPSRT derive from 
interpersonal therapy (IPT), which has never itself been studied in bipolar patients (Frank et 
al., 2000). It places a particular emphasis on preserving sleep and regular daily activities. A 
comparison of IPSRT with ‘intensive clinical management’ suggested benefit from this 
approach. Patients assigned to IPSRT in the acute treatment phase developed greater 
regularity of social rhythms at the end of acute treatment and survived longer without a new 
affective episode over 2 year follow up (Frank et al., 2005). IPSRT is of particular interest 
because it has obvious potential to be adapted for automatic monitoring and feedback of 
diurnal activity from mobile phone apps (Nicholas et al., 2015). If it works, a personalized 
approach to IPSRT-derived self management could be made widely available and integrated 
into clinical care.

Family/Caregivers interventions: Family interventions are effective in the short and long-
term treatment of bipolar disorder (Miklowitz et al 2008; Reinares et al, 2008), although not 
all patients are candidates to those treatments. They are mostly based on psychoeducational 
and CBT paradigms with some extra emphasis on expressed emotions. Involvement of 
family members is clearly of most value in younger patients. The key components are 
psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, communication skills training and problem solving 
skills training.

Cognitive and functional remediation: Even those patients who achieve full clinical 
remission present, in many cases, with long-term cognitive problems and social dislocation. 
Cognitive and functional remediation, as prescribed in group format (Vieta et al., 2014), may 
be helpful to improve global as well as interpersonal and occupational functioning (Torrent 
et al., 2013).

Further work is required to determine whether there are real differences between therapies 
and whether simpler interventions are worthwhile. The provision of greatly increased levels 
of psychotherapy to vulnerable patients is not without its risks, most notably of sexual or 
financial exploitation by the therapist (Nutt and Sharpe, 2008). The disinhibition of bipolar 
patients in a manic state poses a particular hazard.

Comparison with NICE guidelines: specific psychological treatments—The 
primary focus of the BAP guideline is a balanced recommendation for the use of medicines 
in the context of a coherent and integrated psychoeducational framework. The consensus

around the common elements of promising psychological interventions seems more 
convincing than specific therapies, and more immediately applicable through a broadly 
understood goal of psychoeducation for all patients.

NICE2014 made more specific recommendations for psychological treatment of bipolar 
depressive episodes:

‘a psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and 
has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered or a high-
intensity psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or 
behavioural couples therapy) in line with the NICE clinical guideline on depression.’

We are not convinced that extrapolation from unipolar depression is justified (IV).

4  Treatment of alcohol and substance use disorder

The commonest co-morbidity of bipolar disorder is alcohol or substance use disorder. 
Patients appear more likely to present with dysphoric manic states and so bipolar disorder 
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of such presentations. The co-morbidity is 
often present at the first episode.

It is now a clinical consensus that alcohol and substance use co-morbidity should not be seen 
as a secondary phenomenon that will remit with treatment of the bipolar disorder. The 
treatment of alcohol and substance use disorder should be planned in its own right. 
Contemporary approaches are summarized in another BAP guideline and will not be 
repeated at length here.

Thus, we support NICE’s recommendation to ‘Discuss the use of alcohol, tobacco, 
prescription and non-prescription medication and illicit drugs with the person, and their 
carer if appropriate. Explain the possible interference of these substances with the 
therapeutic effects of prescribed medication and psychological interventions.’

It will be helpful to clarify the treatment target choosing from among assisted withdrawal, 
reduction, relapse prevention or maintenance of controlled drinking. In very heavy drinkers, 
even modest reductions in consumption will significantly reduce the potential physical 
harms.

As described in full in the BAP guideline, naltrexone or nalmefene may help patients to 
reduce their alcohol consumption (III). Acamprosate should be offered if naltrexone has not 
been effective (IV). Disulfiram may be considered if the patient wants abstinence and 
acamprosate and naltrexone have failed. The patient must be able to understand the risks of 
taking disulfiram and have their mood monitored (IV).

It may be helpful also to specify caffeine use and treat its reduction as a valid target in 
sensitive patients.

There is a paucity of studies on which to shape a specific approach to treatment of bipolar 
disorder in patients with alcohol or substance use disorder. One small trial in a relevant

population supports the combination of valproate with lithium rather than lithium alone 
(Kemp et al., 2009).

5  Treatment of borderline personality disorder

There is very limited evidence on the treatment of borderline personality disorder especially 
when co-morbid with bipolar disorder. The NICE guideline on borderline personality 
disorder (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg78) understandably addresses the 
stigmatization and barriers to treatment of this patient group. However, it is dogmatic about 
the use of medication: ‘1.3.5.1 Drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline 
personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behaviour associated with the 
disorder (for example, repeated self-harm, marked emotional instability, risk-taking 
behaviour and transient psychotic symptoms).’ And ‘1.3.5.6 Review the treatment of people 
with borderline personality disorder who do not have a diagnosed comorbid mental or 
physical illness and who are currently being prescribed drugs, with the aim of reducing and 
stopping unnecessary drug treatment.’

Despite these recommendations, patients with borderline symptoms are not uncommonly 
offered medication in part as an extrapolation from practice in bipolar patients or as 
treatment for depression. Such practice is supported by poor quality studies of lamotrigine, 
lithium, olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole and quetiapine, which suggest some 
symptomatic benefit in borderline samples (III, (Lieb et al., 2010)).

The data from patients co-morbid for borderline and bipolar disorders, again very limited, 
also suggest improvement from lamotrigine and valproate on borderline symptoms 
(Frankenburg and Zanarini, 2002; Preston et al., 2004). In the lamotrigine study this 
appeared to be associated with, and so perhaps secondary to, improved control of bipolar 
symptoms.

There are four approaches to psychological treatment of borderline personality; two are 
considered psychodynamic in nature: mentalization-based treatment and transference-
focused psychotherapy. The other two are considered to be cognitive-behavioral in nature: 
dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy (Zanarini, 2009). They have been 
investigated in poor quality clinical trials (III or less). In terms of an evidence base, there is 
less to choose between medication and psychological treatment than the NICE guidance 
suggests.

While the NICE borderline guideline acknowledges in passing that the condition is 
commonly co-morbid with bipolar disorder, and implicitly acknowledges that its treatment 
should continue, this probably needs emphasis so as to avoid a polarizing approach in the 
services caring for patients with borderline problems. In fact NHS audit suggests that 
borderline patients with bipolar disorder usually do receive appropriate medication as much 
as 80% of the time (Paton et al., 2015).

“Offer people with bipolar disorder and coexisting disorders, such as personality disorder, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders or substance misuse, treatment in 
line with the relevant NICE clinical guideline, in addition to their treatment for bipolar 
disorder”….” be alert to the potential for drug interactions and use clinical judgement.” We 
recommend the corresponding BAP guidelines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(Bolea-Alamanac et al., 2014), anxiety disorders (Baldwin et al., 2014) or substance misuse 
(Lingford-Hughes et al., 2012).

Anxiety disorders should be routinely assessed alongside mood symptoms in patients with 
bipolar disorder. The anxiety co-morbidity in bipolar disorder is widely distributed: 
approximate proportions are social anxiety (22%), generalised anxiety disorder (18%), post-
traumatic stress disorder (17%), panic disorder with / without agoraphobia (17%), obsessive 
compulsive disorder (10%), and agoraphobia without panic (9%) (McIntyre et al., 2006). 
The NICE and BAP guidelines for these primary anxiety disorders detail the specific 
pharmacological approaches. In bipolar patients there is need for caution in the use of dual 
action monoamine re-uptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine and duloxetine because of the 
risk of switch to mania: pregabalin may have advantages because of its mode of action (via 
calcium channels, not GABA receptors as its structure and name might lead one to expect). 
Specific anxiety-focussed psychological treatment – such as trauma-focussed CBT and CBT 
for social anxiety- are recommended rather than ‘generic CBT’. In general effect sizes for 
drug treatment of anxiety disorders appear to be greater than for psychological treatments 
(Bandelow et al., 2015).

Psychological treatments do potentially offer adjunctive approaches for addressing anxiety 
in bipolar disorder where anxiety-specific medication is contra-indicated and/or in line with 
a patient’s preference. However, bipolar disorder is typically an exclusion criterion in the 
trials of psychological treatments so such recommendations represent extrapolation. 
Moreover, only 22 psychological treatment studies had been published by 2014 with an 
anxiety-related outcome measure in adults with bipolar disorders (Stratford et al., 2015). 
Thus, few psychological treatment studies have explicitly targeted anxiety, since historically 
depression has been the focus. Stratford et al conclude that preliminary data are promising 
for CBT for post-traumatic stress disorder and generalised anxiety disorder in bipolar 
disorders. There was no evidence that psychoeducation alone reduced anxiety. There is early 
evidence that when cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) incorporated an anxiety treatment 
component, anxiety symptoms were reduced in cyclothymia, “refractory” and rapid cycling 
bipolar disorder, whereas standard bipolar CBT treatments had only a modest effect on 
anxiety. CBT during euthymic phases had the greatest weight of evidence, although still 
there is only relatively weak evidence and for limited benefit. The preliminary evidence for 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was mixed. Where reported, psychological therapy 
appeared acceptable and safe, but more systematic collection and reporting of safety and 
acceptability information is needed.

Development of specific psychological models and treatment protocols for anxiety in bipolar 
disorders may help improve outcomes. However, separate parallel approaches to bipolar 
patients with different anxiety disorders will be unwieldy and restrictive. A current theme is 
that ‘bipolar anxiety’ is perceived to be a common clinical problem even if its intensity and

structure do not make an anxiety diagnosis. Moreover, anxiety symptoms can be argued to 
have many core features across anxiety diagnoses. The challenge is how to develop such a 
generic approach for bipolar patients. One proposal is to take a highly patient-led approach 
based on qualitative interview and patient experience (Jones et al., 2013) from which, if 
effective, generalizability may be difficult. A more mechanistic approach might identify 
specific psychological treatment components responsible for reducing anxiety in bipolar 
disorder, like the intensity of imagery (i.e. experience like perception in the absence of a 
percept, such as intrusive images of traumatic events, or images of performing badly in a 
social situation, relevant to PTSD / social anxiety respectively) (Holmes et al., 2008; Holmes 
et al., 2011). Anxiety requires treatment in its own right, and since anxiety may exacerbate 
other mood symptoms, its treatment may contribute to overall improved mood stability. 
There is wide consensus that research and development is required (Mitchell, 2015).

As discussed above, in youth prodromes the earliest symptoms may be anxiety (NICE 2014 
p. 91). Further research is especially warranted for prodromal phases and youth populations 
in which anxiety is prominent. We agree with the NICE guidelines 2014 (p. 304) “it is 
important to know the form of psychological therapy that can benefit young people with 
bipolar disorder”. Evidence-based psychological therapy - even for example within CBT - 
takes disorder-specific forms and may need to be targeted to bipolar specific features as well 
delivered in forms acceptable to youth.

There is a widely perceived need for closer integration between psychological and 
pharmacological approaches, with psychological intervention a potential adjunctive 
treatment for anxiety in the context of long-term maintenance pharmacotherapy for mood 
symptoms. The NICE clinical guideline 185: 2014. p. 264: suggests that psychological 
therapists applying anxiety (or depression) treatment protocol to bipolar disorder “should 
have experience of bipolar”. Further work needs to be done on standards of training and 
gaining experience of this clinical group. Reading these BAP guidelines should be part of 
this (see comment above in Scope of this Guidance). In addition it is recommended that 
psychological therapists and those prescribing maintain and active clinical links when 
working with the same patient.

7  Treatment in special situations

Children and young adults—In previous versions of this guideline there was little 
attempt to make specific recommendations for children and young people, so one inference 
could have been that treatment options for this group should be extrapolated from adult data. 
One worry has been such extrapolation to children falsely diagnosed with ‘bipolar disorder’. 
In the absence of independent evidence of benefit and from appropriate trials in such 
children, the extrapolation could not be encouraged. A more conservative consensus about 
diagnosis has emerged and there has been some increase in information available since the 
last edition on both efficacy and adverse reactions. Most new studies were conducted in the 
USA and will have included patients with broadly defined bipolar disorder, so the diagnosis 
of mania may have had limited validity. There are studies showing advantages compared 
with placebo of aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone (and ziprasidone) and 
further evidence that effect sizes for these medicines is greater than lithium or valproate

(Correll et al., 2010). Adverse effects on weight were very prominent for olanzapine, 
quetiapine and risperidone (in descending order of harm). Aripiprazole, lithium and 
valproate were better (Singh et al., 2010).

Currently only aripiprazole (for 12 weeks) and lithium are licensed for treatment of mania in 
the UK (children of 12 years and older).

Medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat youth with 
bipolar disorder are risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine and olanzapine. Specifically, ‘short-
term treatment with risperidone can help reduce symptoms of mania or mixed mania in 
children ages 10 and up. Some research has indicated that risperidone is more effective in 
treating mania in young children than other medications. Aripiprazole and quetiapine are 
approved to treat mania symptoms in children 10–17 years old who have bipolar I, while 
olanzapine is approved for use in children ages 13–17.’ (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/
publications/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/index.shtml#pub7).

Empirical data on the treatment of bipolar depression in children and young people are 
scarce. Thus, no trials of SSRIs have been conducted in bipolar depression, a study of 
quetiapine did not separate from placebo and there is only low quality evidence from open 
trials for lithium (Patel et al., 2006) and lamotrigine (Chang et al., 2006).

NICE suggested a structured psychological intervention (individual cognitive behavioural 
therapy or interpersonal therapy) of at least 3 months’ duration for bipolar depression. This 
is a simple extrapolation from unipolar practice. Child and adolescent mental health 
professionals usually take a family-based approach (in the sense of non-specific support and 
psychoeducation) and we note a further need to support the education of these patients 
because manic episodes are easily misunderstood.

Most of the trial data in young people come from family therapy or multi-family 
psychoeducation groups with a focus on relapse prevention so a more balanced view of this 
alternative would be appropriate. Family focussed psychotherapy is currently the most 
relevant manualized approach to the problem (Miklowitz, 2015; Vallarino et al., 2015).

The recommendation to treat co-morbidities in accordance with other guidelines could imply 
additional treatment approaches. An integrated treatment that addresses multiple 
presentations of the illness may be more relevant in young people (IV).

For bipolar depression that is moderate to severe, we would consider a pharmacological 
intervention that follows the recommendations for pharmacological interventions for adults 
with appropriate consideration of dosing and potential harms.

Elderly patients—Patients with bipolar disorder grow old, and older people may develop 
bipolar disorder de novo. Indeed, up to 10% of individuals develop bipolar disorder over the 
age of 50, an increasing number as population longevity increases (Sajatovic, 2002). 
Treatment follows the same principles as for other patient groups, although few studies have 
been directed specifically at the elderly. As a group they are more susceptible to adverse 
reactions, owing increased end-organ sensitivity, impaired circulation, and reduced hepatic

and renal clearance. This may be especially the case with lithium (Sproule et al., 2000). In 
general treatment doses are lower than those used in younger adults and should be more 
carefully titrated (Naranjo et al., 1995).

Bipolar disorder and pregnancy—Bipolar patients may wish to get pregnant. Some 
psychotropic medicines may reduce fertility. Thus, an increased incidence of polycystic 
ovarian syndrome (Joffe, 2007), putatively associated with valproate use, may reduce 
fertility but be reversible on stopping medication. Some dopamine antagonists may impair 
ovulation by causing hyperprolactinaemia and disruption of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis. 
Conversely, switching to a prolactin-sparing dopamine antagonist/partial agonist may cause 
return of fertility and unplanned pregnancy. Carbamazepine reduces the effectiveness of oral 
contraceptives (OC) by enzyme induction: double dosing of the OC is one practical solution.

Risks of discontinuation of medication—There appears to be a high probability that 
women who are taking lithium and become pregnant will discontinue it. The figure from the 
UK Health Improvement Network primary care database was almost 70% by the 6th week of 
pregnancy. There is a high risk of relapse in affective disorder if medication is discontinued. 
Thus, 52% of women who discontinued lithium during pregnancy relapsed and 70% of the 
women who remained stable after lithium discontinuation during pregnancy relapsed in the 
post-partum period (Meyer and Koro, 2004; Viguera et al., 2000). A systematic review of 
over 4000 women with bipolar disorder or post-partum psychosis confirmed that postpartum 
relapse rates were significantly higher among those who were medication free during 
pregnancy (66%, 95% CI=57, 75) than those who used prophylactic medication (23%, 95% 
CI=14, 37) (Wesseloo et al., 2015). Risk of post-partum illness is especially high in women 
with a history of previous post-partum psychosis. Treatment may involve exposure to higher 
doses of psychotropic medicines than would be implied by long-term maintenance 
treatment. Maternal depression has a negative effect on child development (Rice et al., 
2007).

Risk of medication harms—The risk of major congenital malformations in the general 
population is surprisingly high at 2–4% and increases with maternal age. Cohort studies 
have shown that the risk increases to 11% in valproate-exposed babies (II, (Kaneko et al., 
1999)), and 6% in those exposed to carbamazepine (II(Rosa, 1991)), and these risks are 
usually unacceptable. Of course, the great majority of women who conceive while taking 
either drug will still deliver a normal baby. Carbamazepine and valproate are associated with 
a range of congenital abnormalities, including neural tube defects (incidence 1% with 
carbamazepine and 1–2% with valproate (Omtzigt et al., 1992)) and the fetal hydantoin 
syndrome (facial dysmorphophobia, cleft lip and palate, cardiac defects, digital hypoplasia, 
and nail dysplasia), which was originally described with phenytoin. The risk of congenital 
abnormalities is dose related with valproate (blood concentrations over 70 micrograms/ml 
are implicated) and increases with the number of antiepileptic agents prescribed (II, (Samren 
et al., 1999)). Valproate has been particularly singled out for concern because of apparently 
higher risks of developmental impairments when compared with women taking other 
anticonvulsants (for epilepsy) (see https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/medicines-

related-to-valproate-risk-of-abnormal-pregnancy-outcomes). The problems describe include 
lowered IQ and development disorders.

Lamotrigine appears not to increase the risk of foetal malformation in the epilepsy 
population (Vajda et al., 2014).

Lithium’s potential teratogenicity remains less well characterized, because it is a less 
common prescription (and is probably often avoided in pregnancy). In the past, lithium’s 
‘specific association’ with Ebstein’s anomaly was believed to represent a high risk. But 
recent analysis suggests that first trimester exposure to lithium is actually associated with a 
0.05–0.1% risk of cardiovascular anomalies (a low absolute risk but perhaps still higher than 
in the general population) (I, (Cohen et al., 1994)). Some studies are still interpreted to 
justify echocardiography to check for cardiac problems in exposed babies (Diav-Citrin et al., 
2014). However, studies have never been large enough (and so included too few cases) to be 
decisive (McKnight et al., 2012).

Many of the risks for bipolar patients may be unavoidable, because population figures of 
30% are given for unplanned pregnancy, and this rate may be higher again in patients with 
mania. Most of the danger for organ development is in the first two months, which may be 
before a woman is aware that she is pregnant. Consequently, all female patients of 
childbearing age should be advised about the importance of effective contraception (II, 
(Smith and Whitfield, 1995)). Pregnancy should be planned in consultation with the 
psychiatrist and should include a full explanation of the treatment options and their benefit 
to harm balance. Treatment options include continuing the existing medication throughout 
pregnancy, switching to alternative medicines associated with lower foetal risk before 
conception, withdrawing some or all medication before conception, and reintroducing it 
either after the first trimester or immediately after birth. The chosen option will depend on 
the patient’s past history, response to treatment and the patient’s and clinician’s preferences. 
If lithium or valproate is continued during pregnancy, prescribing slow-release formulations 
twice or more times daily can minimize high peak concentrations. Some authorities consider 
withdrawal or reduction of lithium before (planned) delivery and re-establishing the original 
dose as before pregnancy immediately after delivery (see NICE2014).

Patients who take lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine during the first trimester should be 
advised about prenatal diagnosis and offered maternal alpha-fetoprotein screening and a 
high resolution ultrasound scan at 16–18 weeks gestation. Folate supplementation is advised 
for all pregnant women, but it is unclear whether this reduces the increased risk of neural 
tube defects associated with carbamazepine and valproate.

Maternal physiological changes during pregnancy may necessitate dosage adjustments. For 
example the glomerular filtration rate increases during pregnancy, causing many medications 
to be excreted more rapidly. As a result serum concentrations may fall and the mother may 
require higher doses to prevent a relapse. After birth these changes reverse and there is a risk 
that higher serum concentrations will results in adverse reactions, unless doses are reduced. 
These issues are most relevant to lithium, given its low therapeutic index.

but primary data is very sparse and confounding prevents any comment about the safety for 
the unborn child (Leiknes et al., 2015).

Neurotoxicity of maternal psychotropic medication after birth—In patients who 
have taken medicines up to childbirth, both toxic effects and withdrawal effects have been 
described in clinical case reports/series, although proving causality is often difficult 
(Ebbesen et al., 2000). Vigilance in caring for babies of mothers taking psychotropic agents 
is recommended. Pre-term babies are at particular risk if breast-fed due to reduced hepatic 
capacity. Benzodiazepines may depress neonatal respiration or cause drowsiness, hypotonia, 
or withdrawal symptoms. Dopamine antagonists/partial agonists can cause EPS. Tricyclics 
can cause urinary retention and functional bowel obstruction. Lithium has been associated 
with goitre, hypotonia, and cyanosis. Carbamazepine has caused neonatal bleeding and is an 
indication for prophylactic vitamin K.

In the case of antidepressants, which are prescribed in as many as 6.5% of women delivering 
babies, revised class labelling has emphasized an increased risk of jitteriness, poor feeding, 
crying, and seizures. The mechanisms are unclear but are clearly attributable to toxicity, 
withdrawal, or a combination of factors (Haddad et al., 2005). Discontinuation in pregnancy, 
or a switch to fluoxetine, whose long half-life may reduce withdrawal effects, are 
management options.

Breastfeeding requires an understanding by patients of the potential risks of toxicity to the 
neonate and the need for vigilance in their care. All maternal drugs enter breast milk, but the 
ratio between infant and maternal plasma concentrations varies greatly. The rate of adverse 
reactions attributable to maternal psychotropic medicines is most uncertain and depends on 
sporadic reports of, for example, toxicity due to lithium, hepatic dysfunction due to 
carbamazepine, and thrombocytopenia or anaemia attributed to valproate. These risks need 
to be balanced against the benefits of breast feeding (I, (Austin and Mitchell, 1998)). Owing 
to its narrow therapeutic index lithium is generally regarded as being a relative 
contraindication to breast feeding (I, (Chaudron and Jefferson, 2000)) because it is present in 
breast milk at 40% of the maternal serum concentration (American Academy of Paediatrics 
Committee on Drugs, 2000).

In general, the risks to the infant are the same as those for any patient exposed to the 
medicine, so clozapine is usually regarded as contraindicated because of the risk of 
agranulocytosis. Lamotrigine will carry the possibility of rash. Antidepressants are usually 
present in breast milk in low concentration but there is large individual variation and some 
infants have developed plasma concentrations higher than maternal plasma concentrations. 
Abrupt withdrawal of sertraline may have caused neonatal withdrawal effects.

The BUMPS website provides a useful resource for clinical staff and pregnant mothers 
themselves concerned about the use of medicines: http://medicinesinpregnancy.org. NICE 
have revised their guidelines for antenatal and postnatal mental health (http://
www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192).

Bottle feeding—A pragmatic alternative to breastfeeding is bottle feeding. This obviously 
avoids concerns about drugs in breast milk and means adherence to drug treatment may be 
more likely. It also has the advantage that responsibility for night feeds may be shared. This 
may in turn protect against the deleterious impact of sleep deprivation on bipolar mood at a 
critical time for mother and infant. Unfortunately, patients may encounter an over-zealous 
approach to breast-feeding advice which assumes they ought to do so. Common sense may 
well dictate otherwise and women should feel confident to make an informed decision that 
suits them (IV).

The risk of relapse—Childbirth increases the risk of relapse in patients with bipolar I 
disorder in the post-partum period (Robertson et al., 2005). In fact, this effect is most 
striking in first babies and for first psychiatric admissions (I, (Terp and Mortensen, 1998)). 
The potential benefits of adherence to long-term treatment for a mother with bipolar 
affective disorder are to remain free of symptoms, enjoy normal bonding with her child, and 
facilitate neonatal development. Failure to control symptoms will risk harm to the mother/
child relationship directly or via co-morbid alcohol, drug, and nicotine consumption. 
Against the benefits there are some risks. These include teratogenesis, neonatal adverse 
reactions that may reflect drug toxicity, and withdrawal effects.

Patients with bipolar II disorder are at an increased risk of mood episodes in general (and 
during pregnancy) but not particularly in the post-partum periods. A history of child-hood 
sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of post-partum depression (Robertson et al., 
2005).

Suicide is a major cause of maternal death in developed countries (Oates, 2003) and is 
sometimes associated with infanticide. It is a sombre note on which to conclude, but perhaps 
helps underline just how fatal a disease bipolar disorder sometimes is.

Are multiple dopamine antagonists/partial agonists being prescribed together?

Is long-term use justified?

Drugs for bipolar depression

Is prescription of antidepressants for depression or anxiety?

Is there evidence of treatment response to the antidepressant?

Is use justified?

Page 119

Has effective contraception been offered?

Psychological interventions

Has psychoeducation been offered?

Is there a mechanism in place for regular mood monitoring?

Comparison of emphasis in planning service provision for bipolar patients.

The items where benefit is uncertain, or based on no formal evidence for bipolar disorder, are marked with an 
asterisk.

NICE

BAP

Access to early intervention for psychosis

Access to early intervention from experts in bipolar disorder(S). For 
mania, always consider admission to hospital or intensive community 
management (S).

Care programme approach*
Continue in specialized service or integrated CMHT but offer those 
stable the option of a return to primary care*

Long-term specialist services with a consistent flexible alliance (S) 
with a specifically trained psychiatrist(S)

Discuss self-management and engagement

Help patient and carers recognize early signs of relapse

Intensive case management for those likely to disengage. Crisis 
management*

Disorganised patients need assertive management

Offer a structured psychological intervention
Offer family intervention
Offer supported employment programme*

Consider offering enhanced psychological and social support

Comparison with NICE guidelines: bipolar depression

Table 6

NICE2014

BAP

Offer fluoxetine combined with Olanzapine (OFC), or quetiapine 
monotherapy.

Consider quetiapine, lurasidone or olanzapine monotherapy

Consider either olanzapine (without fluoxetine) or lamotrigine 
monotherapy.

Consider initial treatment with lamotrigine, … usually as an addition to 
agents preventing recurrence of mania

If there is no response to OFC or quetiapine, consider lamotrigine 
monotherapy.

Consider the use of an antidepressant with an antimanic drug in bipolar 
I patients

ECT noticed but not recommended.

Consider ECT in severe or refractory depression

Offer a psychological intervention that has been developed 
specifically for bipolar disorder.

Within 4 weeks of resolution of symptoms, discuss …whether to 
continue treatment for bipolar depression or start long-term 
treatment

Consider family-focused, cognitive behavior therapy or interpersonal 
rhythm therapy as an additional treatment (not as a primary treatment 
option)

Consider the strategy for long-term treatment as patient recovers

Comparison with NICE guidelines: long-term treatment

Table 7

Offer lithium as a first-line

Consider lithium as first line treatment in adherent patients

NICE

BAP

If lithium is ineffective, consider adding valproate

if lithium is poorly tolerated or unsuitable, consider valproate or 
olanzapine or (if acutely effective) quetiapine

If lithium alone is ineffective consider combination treatment 
(depression predominant: ADD lamotrigine, quetiapine or lurasidone to 
lithium; mania predominant: ADD valproate or a dopamine antagonist/
partial agonist to lithium)

If lithium is poorly tolerated or unsuitable, consider other options: 
valproate, dopamine antagonists/partial agonists

Consider lamotrigine as monotherapy in bipolar II disorder when 
depression is the major burden

Within 4 weeks of resolution of symptoms, discuss …. whether to 
continue psychological or pharmacological treatment for bipolar 
depression or start long-term treatment

Consider the strategy for long-term treatment as patient recovers
