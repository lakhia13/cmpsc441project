Abstract 
Background:  Long‑term follow‑up studies in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) consistently show 
persistent impairment in psychosocial adjustment, although symptoms tend to decrease over time. Consequently, it 
might be better to deemphasize symptom‑oriented interventions and instead promote interventions that incorpo‑
rate patient perspectives on recovery. In this study we aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel 
intervention (dialectical behavioral therapy combined with positive psychology and contextual‑based skills) in the 
clinical treatment of long‑lasting BPD difficulties.

Methods:  This was a qualitative study. We developed an initial 8‑week group intervention for long‑lasting BPD. Upon 
completion of the 8‑week program, the participants were asked to participate in a group discussion to provide feed‑
back. Based on that feedback, the intervention protocol was modified and then offered to a second group of patients, 
who also provided feedback. The protocol was revised again and administered to a third group. A total of 32 patients 
participated in the group interventions; of these, 20 provided feedback in the qualitative study. The main outcome 
measure was acceptability.

Results:  The following overarching themes emerged from the group interviews: helpful, unhelpful and neutral prac‑
tices; internal/external barriers; facilitators; and effects. Participants reported difficulties in imagining an optimal future 
and self‑compassion. By contrast, positive skills were associated with an increase in positive emotions. The main inter‑
nal barrier was facing difficult emotions. The main external barriers were language‑related issues. The group format 
was perceived as a facilitator to success. Dropout rates, which were assessed as an additional measure of acceptability, 
decreased substantially in each successive group, from 60 to 40% and finally 20%.

Conclusions:  The intervention was feasible to implement in the clinical setting and participants rated the final set of 
skills highly. Most of the skills were considered useful. Participant feedback was invaluable to improve the interven‑
tion, as evidenced by the large increase in the retention rate from 40 to 80%. Randomized clinical trials are needed to 
test the efficacy of this intervention in promoting well‑being in participants with long‑lasting BPD.

Background
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental 
disorder  characterized  by  pervasive  emotion  dysregula-
tion,  impulsivity,  identity  disturbances  and  conflicting 
interpersonal relationships [1, 8]. In the general popula-
tion, the prevalence of BPD is around 2% [76], although 
it  is  substantially  more  common  in  clinical  populations, 
with a reported mean point prevalence across studies of 
28.5% [73]. BPD often presents with other mental disor-
ders,  including  mood,  substance  use,  and  eating  disor-
ders, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [1].
Despite  the  severity  of  BPD,  remission  rates  within 
10 years  of  diagnosis  are  as  high  as  85%  [34,  77].  How-
ever,  high  remission  rates  do  not  necessarily  indicate 
the absence of suffering or impairment, rather remission 
simply means that the patient no longer meets diagnostic 
criteria for BPD. Some authors argue that BPD progresses 
in  stages,  starting  with  an  “at-risk”  stage  that  eventually 
leads  to  clinical  manifestations  [42].  Clinical  improve-
ment appears to come at the cost of social isolation and 
a significant reduction in general activity. A relevant pro-
portion  of  patients  suffer  from  persistent  impairment 
in  psychosocial  adjustment  [2].  Follow-up  studies  have 
consistently  found  that  some  core  BPD  traits,  such  as 
impulsivity-related behaviors, resolve more quickly while 
other  traits,  such  as  those  related  to  affective  instabil-
ity  and  anger,  tend  to  be  more  enduring  [54].  Crucially, 
only  a  small  percentage  of  patients  with  BPD  achieve 
remission  of  comorbid  clinical  conditions,  most  notable 
affective  symptoms,  which  reflect  loneliness,  feelings  of 
emptiness, and impaired psychosocial functioning [2]. In 
this regard, “long-lasting BPD” refers to patients that pre-
sent some degree of clinical improvement, but in whom 
low mood, poor psychosocial adjustment, and feelings of 
emptiness persist over time.

In recent years, the concept of good mental health has 
been  expanded  to  comprise  more  than  simply  a  reduc-
tion  in  symptoms.  Good  mental  health  involves  several 
domains, including meaningful living, the establishment 
of  significant  relationships  and  self-management  strate-
gies [27, 43, 46]. This broader conception of good mental 
health matches the perspective of patients with BPD with 
regards to recovery. Katsakou et al [45] conducted a qual-
itative  study  involving  48  patients  with  BPD  receiving 
treatment in secondary mental health services. The inter-
views  showed  that  patients  associated  recovery  with  an 
increase in several factors, including self-acceptance, self-
confidence,  control  over  emotions,  better  relationships, 

employment, and a decrease in symptoms such as suici-
dality and self-harm.

Psychotherapy  is  recommended  as  a  first-line  treat-
ment  for  BPD  [56,  72].  Several  psychological  inter-
ventions  are  available  to  treat  BPD,  although  the  most 
extensively studied and well-established approach is dia-
lectical  behavioral  therapy  (DBT),  whose  effectiveness 
has  been  demonstrated  in  multiple  studies  [8,  19,  72]. 
Standard DBT is a highly structured treatment based on 
cognitive-behavioral  principles,  integrating  mindfulness 
and  dialectical-based  strategies  into  four  different  treat-
ment modes (i.e., individual therapy, skills training [ST], 
phone contact, and consultations team) [49]. DBT offers 
a stage-specific treatment approach that is determined by 
the  severity  of  the  disorder.  Treatment  according  to  the 
stage,  which  ranges  from  stage  1  to  4,  is  important  and 
necessary given the high complexity of BPD and related 
comorbidities.  The  main  goal  of  stage  one  treatment  is 
to  reduce  life-threatening  behaviors  (i.e.,  parasuicidal 
behavior,  severe  eating  disorder  and  substance  abuse). 
The focus of stage two is to help patients learn to experi-
ence  emotions  appropriately.  Exposure-based  strategies 
for treating intrusive symptoms, which may be related to 
comorbid PTSD, are recommended once the patient has 
improved  stage  one  behaviors.  Stage  three  treatments 
focus  on  improving  problem-solving  related  to  activi-
ties  of  daily  living,  increasing  self-respect,  and  improv-
ing  relationships.  The  aims  of  interventions  for  stage 
four include reducing the sense of incompleteness while 
increasing  connectedness,  and  enhancing  full  participa-
tion in life, and acceptance [52].

Research  in  DBT  has  focused  mainly  on  stage  one 
(keeping patients alive) and stage two (emotional repro-
cessing)  [8,  35,  52,  62].  Although  follow-up  studies 
suggest  mood  and  interpersonal  difficulties,  evidence 
regarding stages three and four is scarce.

Studies  on  DBT  skills  training  (DBT-ST)  in  BPD  have 
evaluated the effectiveness of training four skill modules: 
mindfulness,  emotion  regulation,  interpersonal  effec-
tiveness, and distress tolerance [50]. Those studies show 
that  standard  DBT  (including  all  treatment  modes)  and 
DBT-ST  mode  alone  are  both  effective  in  reducing  self-
injurious behavior, suicide attempts, and depression and 
anxiety [12, 48, 71].

Positive  psychology  (PP)  has  emerged  as  an  interest-
ing,  evidence-based  approach  to  improving  well-being 
[12,  21,  47].  PP  interventions  focus  on  selecting  and 
amplifying positive emotions, in some cases by replacing 

Soler et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2022) 9:34

negative  with  positive  emotions,  based  on  the  idea  that 
positive  experiences  can  attenuate  or  damper  negative 
ones  [65].  Within  the  PP  framework,  an  individual  who 
is  capable  of  choosing  how  to  act  or  what  to  pay  atten-
tion to at a given point in time is more likely to act in a 
wiser, more virtuous manner, thus increasing well-being 
[67,  68].  Mindfulness  is  crucial  to  achieving  those  aims. 
Mindfulness  and  compassion-based  interventions  have 
been associated with increased positive affect, improved 
quality  of  life  and  pro-social  behavior  [4,  18,  20,  24,  28, 
38, 59]. Some mindfulness practices, such as loving-kind-
ness  (LK)  and  self-compassion  (SC),  are  part  of  a  set  of 
DBT  skills  named  “other  perspectives  on  mindfulness” 
[50].  LK  and  SC,  along  with  mindfulness,  have  proven 
useful to alleviate suffering and promote well-being ([26, 
33];    [53, 57]). Nevertheless, most DBT skills training pro-
grams [10, 25, 50] focus on the “core mindfulness skills”, 
which  teach  participants  how  to  practice  mindfulness. 
Since  LK  and  SC  are  not  considered  “core”  skills,  they 
are  often  left  out  of  these  programs  as  explicit  teaching 
skills, even though some authors have suggested that they 
can be woven into the teaching of the “core” mindfulness 
skills  [50].  Data  from  a  pilot  study  showed  that  adding 
LK and SC practices to the traditional mindfulness skills 
resulted  in  greater  levels  of  acceptance  than  mindful-
ness skills alone [26]. That study also observed significant 
improvements in BPD symptoms, self-criticism, and self-
kindness [26]. A feasibility study performed to assess the 
value  of  PP  exercises  for  patients  with  suicidal  behavior 
found  that  exercises  designed  to  increase  gratitude  and 
personal  strengths  were  positively  evaluated  by  the  par-
ticipants;  conversely,  forgiveness-focused  exercises  were 
rated poorly [39].

Although  numerous  studies  have  demonstrated  the 
value of DBT for the treatment of stage one and two BPD, 
there  is  a  notable  knowledge  gap  regarding  the  value  of 
DBT  for  stages  three  and  four.  Although  some  prelimi-
nary  evidence  suggests  that  positive  psychology,  loving-
kindness and self-compassion exercises  might  be useful, 
more  data  are  needed  to  support  their  use.  In  addition, 
published studies on patient perspectives on recovery in 
BPD are scant, and more data are needed to make treat-
ment and outcome targets more relevant to patients.

In  this  context,  there  is  a  need  to  perform  feasibility 
studies  to  determine  whether  an  intervention  is  appro-
priate for further testing [9]. These type of studies are val-
uable because they reflect the reality of clinical practice, 
thus providing external validation by testing whether the 
feasibility of the intervention in real-world setting [9]. An 
important area of focus addressed by feasibility research 
is  examining  acceptability,  which  refers  to  participant 
perceptions of the novel intervention [9].

Accordingly,  we  performed  the  present  qualitative 
study  to  examine  the  feasibility  and  acceptability  of  an 
expanded  skills  DBT-based  intervention  targeting  long-
lasting  BPD.  Acceptability  was  assessed  through  group 
discussions  designed  to  obtain  extensive  feedback  from 
the participants.

Methods
Participants

A  total  of  32  outpatients  with  long-lasting  BPD  partici-
pated in the novel treatment program (see below). All of 
these patients were recruited from the BPD unit at a pub-
lic hospital in Spain. For the purpose of this study, “long-
lasting” BPD was defined as the presence of some clinical 
improvement  (no  life-threatening  behaviors  or  trauma-
related symptoms for at least 12 months) accompanied by 
persistent low mood, poor psychosocial adjustment, and/
or feelings of emptiness.

Inclusion criteria were: adults of either sex between 18 
and 65 years of age; primary diagnosis of BPD according 
to  DSM-IV-TR  criteria  and  the  structured  Diagnostic 
Interview  for  Borderlines  Revised  (DIB-R)  (Barrachina 
et al., 2004); previous participation in two DBT-ST inter-
ventions  and  signed  informed  consent.  Exclusion  cri-
teria  were:  presence  of  life-threatening  behaviors  in  the 
last 12 months; PTSD or related symptoms; diagnosis of 
drug-induced psychosis, organic brain syndrome, bipolar 
or psychotic disorder; intellectual disability; participation 
in  any  other  psychotherapy  treatment  during  the  study. 
A  subgroup  of  20  participants  participated  in  the  quali-
tative  study,  which  was  conducted  to  assess  the  partici-
pants’ perception of the intervention.

Procedure

First,  we  reviewed  the  available  literature  to  identify 
interventions  designed  to  treat  long-lasting  BPD  symp-
toms. This review showed that PP exercises and compas-
sion strategies seem to be useful for enhancing well-being 
[17, 26, 33, 47,  57]. Consequently, we developed an inter-
vention  based  on  PP  and  contemplative  practices  (for 
more  details  see  the  Wellbeing  Training  Based  on  Con-
templative Practices [WTCP]) manual: [13, 15, 26]). The 
skills trainers were directly trained in the WTCP protocol 
by the creator of that program. Next, we recorded a series 
of  guided  meditations  aimed  at  facilitating  the  practice 
of  the  skills  in  the  WTCP  and  we  created  a  workbook 
describing  the  skills  presented  in  the  intervention.  The 
intervention was led by three experienced therapists (all 
with PhDs) who had both research and personal experi-
ence  in  mindfulness  practice.  Two  of  the  therapists  (J.S 
and  M.E)  had  received  prior  training  in  DBT,  self-com-
passion  programs,  and  CBT.  The  third  therapist  (A.M) 
had experience in CBT and PP.

We developed an initial 8-week intervention designed 
to treat long-lasting BPD. Ten patients were assigned to 
a  group  intervention.  Upon  completion  of  the  8-week 
program, the participants were invited to participate in 
group  discussions  to  explore  their  experience  with  the 
training  and  the  particular  practices  offered  in  those 
sessions.  Two  group  discussion  sessions  were  con-
ducted  by  two  independent  researchers,  who  were  not 
involved  in  the  treatment  of  patients.  The  information 
obtained  during  these  interviews  regarding  the  value 
of  each  specific  practice  was  then  used  to  improve 
and  refine  the  content of the intervention. The revised 
treatment protocol was then offered to a second group 
of  patients,  who  also  participated  in  a  group  discus-
sion  after  completion  of  the  8-week  intervention.  This 
process  was  repeated  to  develop  the  third  and  final 
intervention,  which  included  only  the  skills/practices 
considered most useful by most patients. Practices that 
had an aversive effect (i.e., increased distress) were dis-
carded;  only  those  practices  considered  useful  by  par-
ticipants were retained.

The initial intervention was based on a combination of 
PP and mindfulness-based frameworks (see WTCP man-
ual: [15]). The treatment format consisted of eight 2-hour 
sessions offered weekly in a group setting (minimum 10 
participants). The structure of the sessions was similar to 
the  DBT-ST  format.  At  the  first  session,  the  norms  and 
goals were presented and participants received the work-
book  and  recorded  meditations.  The  therapists  empha-
sized that the goal of the intervention was not to achieve 
“instant” happiness, but rather to learn and practice evi-
dence-based  skills  to  promote  well-being.  Starting  with 
the second session, a new skill was introduced each week. 
Practical exercises and/or a meditative practice were also 
practiced during the session. Participants were instructed 
to  practice  the  skills  learned  at  the  session  during  the 
week.  These  skills  and  the  homework  assignments  were 
reviewed at the start of the next session.

The first eight-week intervention was entirely based on 
the WTCP program [15]. This program included training 
in the following skills: 1) Best Possible Self (participants 
were instructed to write a letter about the best version of 
their self-projected self over the next 10 years); 2) Mind-
fulness  (breath  and  body  meditations);  3)  Identification 
and  development  of  personal  strengths;  4)  Empowering 
positive  emotions  (savoring  and  gratitude);  5)  Regulat-
ing negative emotions; 6) Contribution (compassion and 
altruism);  and  7)  Multi-Self  (including  compassionate 
self ).  In  this  first  intervention,  most  participants  strug-
gled with the concepts of “happiness” and “self-compas-
sion”.  In  addition,  most  of  the  patients  considered  the 
practice  of  projecting  oneself  into  the  long-term  future 
(i.e., Best Possible Self strategy) to be aversive. Only four 

of the ten participants completed the entire 8-week inter-
vention, a 60% dropout rate.

To  address  this  high  dropout  rate  and  dissatisfaction 
with  certain  elements  of  the  intervention,  the  interven-
tion  was  modified  based  on  feedback  from  the  partici-
pants. The “My best possible self ” skill was reduced to 1 
year (instead of 10) and we also modified the sequence of 
skill presentation. In addition, during the post-interven-
tion  interviews,  participants  reported  experiencing  high 
levels  of  distress  during  the  intervention.  Consequently, 
we  moved  the  presentation  of  self-compassion  skills  to 
session 1, and also extended training in self-compassion 
to  four  sessions.  The  “regulating  negative  emotions” 
model  session  [15]  was  replaced  with  self-compassion 
strategies. Instead, participants were encouraged to prac-
tice the skills covered in the emotion regulation module 
of DBT-ST. References to “happiness” were avoided.

A second group of patients (n = 10) that met the inclu-
sion  criteria  were  recruited  from  the  BPD  Unit  to  par-
ticipate  in  this  revised  intervention.  Upon  completion 
of  this  second  8-week  intervention,  feedback  from  the 
participants  confirmed  difficulties  with  the  “Best  Possi-
ble Self ” practice. Consequently, we decided to eliminate 
this skill in the next version of the protocol. Participants 
also  reported  difficulties  with  the  concept  of  “self-com-
passion”,  which  some  perceived  as  sorrow  or  self-pity. 
Importantly,  six  of  the  ten  participants  completed  full 
intervention,  a  dropout  rate  of  40%  (versus  60%  in  the 
first  group).  Both  patients  and  therapists  agreed  that 
eight sessions were insufficient to introduce and train all 
of the content.

Based  on  these  data,  the  protocol  was  again  revised 
and  expanded  from  eight  to  12  weekly  sessions.  The 
revised protocol included new strategies to work on self-
compassion  as  a  form  of  self-care.  In  terms  of  sequence 
of skills, the revised protocol began with self-care skills, 
based on the observation that a minimum degree of lov-
ing  kindness  and  compassion  towards  the  self  is  essen-
tial  before  training  in  positive  emotion  strategies. These 
self-care skills were based on the DBT practice of “Please 
Self-care” (see PLEASE skills: [49, 50]), which consists of 
practicing self-compassion by performing “self-care acts”, 
defined  mainly  as  behaviors  involving  taking  care  of  the 
body under the premise of “fake it until you make it”.

In addition, we detected a need for strategies to defuse 
cognitive  barriers  for  self-care  training.  Consequently, 
we  developed  and  included  a  new  module,  which  we 
called  “Cognitive  Self-Care”,  to  address  different  polari-
ties  of  thought.  Defusion  strategies  played  a  key  role  in 
these practices. Additionally, we incorporated a practice 
called “Wise-Matrix”, which combines “the Matrix” from 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  (ACT)  [60]  and 
the  “Wise  Mind”  skill  from  DBT  [50].  The  aim  of  this 

Soler et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2022) 9:34

combined  practice  is  to  promote  new  perspectives  for 
problematic  thoughts  and  emotions  to  lower  emotional 
reactivity. Most patients rated the savoring and gratitude 
practices  as  useful  and  thus  these  were  retained.  This 
third  and  final  intervention  group  had  the  lowest  drop-
out  rate  of  the  three  groups  (20%  vs.  40  and  60%).  Ten 
patients out of twelve completed the full intervention. All 
the practices and skills used in the final intervention are 
described in Table 1.

(standard deviation [SD]) age was 40.3 (6.1) years (range, 
27-45).  Twenty  of  these  patients  were  interviewed  in 
the  post-intervention  feedback  groups.  The  educational 
level  was  as  follows:  university  studies  (56.3%),  second-
ary studies (37.5%), and primary education (6.3%). At the 
evaluation,  37.5%  of  the  sample  was  unemployed,  31.3% 
were  receiving  an  invalidity  allowance,  and  25%  were 
employed. Most patients (75%) were single. Most patients 
lived alone (43.8%) or with their birth family (31.3%).

Data analyses

In this study, we used a mixed-methods approach, which 
consisted  of  a  quantitative  description  of  the  partici-
pants’ characteristics and attendance rates, together with 
a  qualitative  description  of  the  participants’  experience 
with  the  intervention  obtained  through  group  discus-
sions led by experienced clinicians.

We evaluated the opinions and experiences of the par-
ticipants as a result of the process. We obtained qualita-
tive  data  by  means  of  a  clinician-led  discussion  within 
the established groups. These discussions were based on 
a  series  of  semi-structured  questions  designed  to  inves-
tigate  the  participants’  experiences  around  six  different 
themes  established  by  the  research  team  (these  themes 
were  selected  prior  to  conducting  the  group  discus-
sions)  (Table  2).  First,  participants  were  asked  to  give 
their  opinion  on  each  theme.  If  any  contradictory  state-
ments  or  disagreements  emerged,  the  discussion  mod-
erator  asked  the  participants  to  clarify  their  statements. 
The data obtained in the discussion groups were analyzed 
using an interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA 
[];).  Since  the  individual’s  perspective  cannot  be  directly 
accessed  in  IPA,  the  researcher  interprets  the  partici-
pant’s interpretation through a double hermeneutic pro-
cess [23]. This process allows the researcher to reflect on 
the  participant’s  insider  perspective  in  the  broader  con-
text, informed by scientific publications and research on 
the  topic/experience  under  study.  Following  IPA  guide-
lines  [70],  the  participants  were  encouraged  to  express 
themselves  freely;  when  necessary,  the  researcher  asked 
for clarification. The researchers encouraged participants 
to  express  their  opinions  as  naturally  as  possible.  The 
recorded discussions were transcribed verbatim and were 
read  several  times,  line-numbered,  and  organized  by 
codes  into  subthemes  [23].  Disagreements  between  the 
two researchers were resolved by consensus between the 
researchers and the first author. Analysis was supported 
by Atlas.ti, (v.22).

Results
Sample characteristics

A total of 32 outpatients participated in the group inter-
ventions. Most patients (95%) were female. The mean age 

Participants’ experiences

Six  overarching  themes  were  explored  in  each  group 
discussion,  as  follows:  1)  helpful  practices,  2)  unhelpful 
practices, 3) neutral practices, 4) barriers, 5) facilitators, 
and  6)  effects.  Later,  several  sub-themes  were  identified 
based on an analysis of the transcribed text of the discus-
sions (Table 2).

A  central  theme  was  the  distinction  between  helpful, 
neutral, and unhelpful practices, which was based on the 
participants’ experience with these different skills during 
training.  Among  the  helpful  practices,  practicing  grati-
tude and savoring, and mindfulness were associated with 
an  increase  in  positive  emotions  in  15  of  the  20  partici-
pants (75%), as evidenced by the following comments:

“I  noticed  that  being  grateful  for  the  things  that  I 
have  lifts  my  mood.  At  night,  instead  of  thinking 
about  everything  that  goes  wrong,  I  do  the  grati-
tude practice, and I feel much better for all the good 
things I do have in my life”.

“It has helped me to accept that I will have negative 
feelings,  and  that  I  can  feel  the  pain  and  continue 
with my life (mindfulness with emotion)”.

Some  participants  (6/20;  30%)  reported  that  complet-
ing  the  Strengths  Questionnaire  was  helpful  to  become 
more aware of their strengths. The questionnaire helped 
raise  awareness  of  some  personal  characteristics  that 
they  had  not  noticed  before  or  shifted  how  they  per-
ceived some of these characteristics.

“I already knew I had these characteristics, but per-
haps I did not see them as strengths. There are things 
that people say about me that I do not believe. The 
questionnaire  has  helped  me  to  see  them  as  good 
things about myself ”.

For some, being more aware of their strengths was also 

related to decreasing self-criticism:

“According  to  the  questionnaire,  some  of  my 
strengths are equanimity, honesty, and appreciation 
of beauty and excellence. At first, I could not believe 
it because I have always been in touch with the neg-

Loving  kindnessa

The aim of this skill, from DBT (see PLEASE skills: [49] 
[50];), is to facilitate behavioral changes through 
self‑care. It consists of five components: (i) address‑
ing physical illness; (ii) balancing eating; (iii) avoiding 
mood‑altering substances such as alcohol, drugs, 
non‑prescribed medications or misuse of prescribed 
medications; (iv) balancing sleep; and (v) exercising.

The Matrix is a therapeutic tool created by Polk and 
Schoendorff [60] and used in the context of ACT [36] 
to provide a contextual view of problematic behaviors. 
The aim is to explore the following: values, obstacles/
barriers, inflexible behaviors, and valued actions. This 
tool is useful to generate cognitive defusion, although 
it can generate elevated distress when applied in 
patients with severe BPD, especially when internal 
obstacles are identified. To avoid distress, participants 
were instructed to answer the MATRIX questions from 
the DBT “wise mind” skill ([49], [50]), which helps to 
generate a defused perspective of inner experience 
while avoiding the extremes of “emotional mind” and 
“rational mind”. This skill was named “Wise‑Matrix”, as it 
combines both strategies.

Based on the emotion regulation skills of DBT (see 
Emotion Regulation Handouts: [50], p. 388), partici‑
pants were asked to answer the question “what is most 
important to me right now?”, to identify their main 
values. Once these values were identified, goals and 
concrete actions were defined to help the participants 
put each value into practice on a daily basis.

The freely available VIA Character Strengths Survey 
(https:// www. viach aract er. org) was used to iden‑
tify personal strengths. This questionnaire assesses 
24‑character strengths classified into six broad 
categories of virtues: wisdom, courage, humanity, 
justice, temperance, and transcendence [61]. Partici‑
pants were told to complete the questionnaire and to 
identify their five main strengths. The main goal of this 
strategy was to define and generate behaviors linked 
to personal strengths. For example: “activating the 
strength of kindness by acting kindly towards co-workers”. 
As a way of motivating concrete actions, the personal 
strengths were associated with the values previously 
identified in session 3.

The goal of this session was to foster the understand‑
ing of the importance of self‑care through loving 
kindness. This skill focuses on identifying polarities of 
thought (i.e., “fusion vs. defusion”, “kindness vs. hostility”, 
“shared humanity vs. isolation”, “impermanence vs. per-
manence” ...) in order to generate more flexible ways 
of relating to one’s own experience. Some of the main 
targets are to generate perspective, identify forms of 
experiential avoidance, facilitate a connection with 
others, and to foster acceptance that the world, like 
our experiences, is changeable. The goal is to defuse 
rigid rules such as “my life will always be the same” or “I 
can’t trust others”.

Contribution

The main target of this session is for participants to 
learn to calm themselves as a prelude to compassion. 
This skill consists of using body‑related practices to 
facilitate self‑compassion and self‑calming. The skills 
used were “half smile” and “willing hands” (DBT: [49] 
[50];), “compassionate gesture and tone”, and “calming 
touch”.

The aim of this session is to appreciate the difference 
between self‑care and self‑criticism, as well as how to 
use meditations to facilitate self‑compassion (e.g., “safe 
place imagery, compassionate color, interconnection 
meditation …”). Some of the meditations are available 
in many mindfulness‑based interventions (e.g., MSC: 
[30]). The goal is to facilitate self‑care skills and a kinder 
relationship with one’s own experience.
Participants were encouraged to practice self‑com‑
passion by talking to themselves as they would talk 
to a loved one. They were also encouraged to identify 
self‑critical phrases and to replace them with self‑
compassionate ones.

This strategy is widely used in compassion‑focused 
therapy (WTCP; CFT: [31]: [15]). It consists of exploring 
the possible multiple selves that can appear in the 
same situation and their relationship with different 
emotions such as anger, anxiety, and sadness. The 
goal is to show the participants that there are different 
possibilities of experiencing a situation and not just a 
“single self”. This skill allows the participants to practice 
perspective‑taking to create “a compassionate self”.

To practice intensifying and prolonging positive emo‑
tions in a deliberate way. Participants can be trained in 
savoring by increasing awareness of something posi‑
tive from the present, remembering something from 
the past or anticipating something good in the future 
[5, 6, 64]. Listing their favorite experiences using the 
five senses and then experiencing them in daily life 
or bringing this to mind during a meditation practice 
were examples of savoring‑training.
Specific tasks were:
1) Identify favorite sensory experiences; 2) Iden‑
tify thoughts and behaviors that boycott positive 
moments; and 3) Record three positive events in the 
day and savor them.

The goal of this skill was to pay attention to valued 
things in daily life that are not usually appreciated. 
For example: “Find three things during your day that 
you are grateful for and savor them for 20-30 seconds”. 
These practices included: thinking about supportive 
relationships, what others have done for us, a gift you 
have appreciated, feeling grateful for something or to 
someone … Participants were also asked to make a 
record of self‑critical or judgmental thoughts and then 
turn them into a gratitude sentence.

This practice consists of taking concrete actions to 
help others (i.e., “perform 5 kind acts during the week”). 
The aim is to increase self‑esteem through helping 
loved ones and nurturing old and new relationships. 
This skill is commonly used as a distraction and dis‑
tress tolerance strategy in DBT ([49] [50];). Contribution 
allows individuals to redirect attention from the self to 
others and can be useful to interact with others.

ative side. Now, I do not see myself as bad as I used 
to”.

In  addition  to  identifying  these  personal  strengths,  a 
substantial proportion of participants (12/20; 60%) noted 
that practicing self-compassion and loving-kindness had 
a positive impact:

“I am so harsh on myself. Compassion practices help 
me notice that and decrease the number of self-judg-
ments, which has an impact on the way I see others. 
I do not judge them as much either”.

“For me, the best thing has been the work with self-
criticism, it has helped me a lot to use the third per-
son, to ask myself if I would speak to another person 
like that”.

“Combining  self-compassion  talk  with  touch  helps 
me.  It  didn’t  help  me  as  much  to  tell  myself  things 
as  it  would  to  someone  else,  but  to  put  a  hand  on 
my chest and feel myself, helps. If I just tell myself I 
don’t  believe  it,  then  the  reassuring  touch  helps  me 
believe it”.

Finally, most participants (7/10; 70%) rated the “Wise-

Matrix” as a useful but complex tool:

“Just realizing what is the internal world and what 
is  the  external  world  is  what  helped  me  the  most. 
Understanding  it,  integrating  it  and  practicing  it 
is  the  most  important  thing.  I  wouldn’t  have  been 
able  to  stand  being  in  this  group  if  it  hadn’t  been 
for  the  matrix,  because  my  heart  is  going  super-
fast and I can still stay here”.

“The  matrix  has  placed  me  in  the  world,  it  has 
made  me  more  aware  of  what  I  had  in  my  head 
and believed to be real. Now I can distinguish the 
difference between my inner world and the outside 
world”.

“The matrix is very useful, but I have to keep work-
ing  on  it.  When  something  affects  me,  I  wonder  if 
it is something from the outside world or from the 
inside  world.  Now  I  see  that  difference,  but  I  still 
find it hard not to believe what my mind is telling 
me. I also am more aware of whether or not I am 
moving away from what matters to me. For exam-
ple,  with  interpersonal  relationships,  if  I  am  very 
vulnerable,  I  prefer  to  take  a  step  back  and  face 
another  day,  instead  of  saying  or  doing  something 
that is going to be bad for the relationship”.

By  contrast,  some  of  the  practices  were  considered 
unhelpful.  For  example,  being  more  aware  of  particu-
lar internal processes was associated with an increase in 
negative affect.

their  own  feelings.  Some  participants  also  noted  that 
the therapist’s ability to “embody” these practices and to 
direct the group to prevent deflection from the session’s 
subject.

“Trying  to  practice  self-compassion  was  awful  for 
me because I became aware of how much I criticize 
myself,  not  three  times  a  day,  but  20  hours  a  day. 
This  made  me  feel  like  some  monster,  and  it  was 
unpleasant for me; it made me angry. It is tough for 
me to practice self-compassion".

In addition, the practice of writing a letter to the future 
self  was  perceived  as  bitter-sweet.  While  some  partici-
pants (3/10; 30%) considered it to be a sort of “roadmap” 
for the future, for most (7/10; 70%) the experience of pro-
jecting  themselves  into  the  future  was  unpleasant  and 
triggered anxiety.

“I do not see the point in writing the letter. I find it 
difficult to survive each day, so I cannot make a plan 
for the next six months”.

In relation to internal barriers, many participants (9/20; 
45%)  identified  “moodiness”  as  the  primary  obstacle  to 
practicing the skills presented:

“Some  days,  I  am  just  not  open  to  this.  On  those 
days, having to find things to be grateful for is neg-
ative.  If  I  have  a  bad  day,  I  prefer  to  deal  with  it 
rather than  feeling forced  to  find good  things  in my 
life”.

“When  I  feel  “normal”,  practicing  is  not  a  problem. 
However, when I am having a bad day, it is impos-
sible for me to apply self-compassion. I wish I could, 
but I simply cannot”.

In  terms  of  external  barriers,  some  participants  (4/20; 
20%)  identified  the  characteristics  of  the  group  leader 
as not being helpful. A few participants (3/20; 15%) also 
criticized how the content was presented, suggesting that 
it would be better to use a more structured presentation 
during the session, with a booklet to review the content 
at home. Most participants underscored difficulties in the 
use  of  concepts  such  as  “happiness”  and  “self-compas-
sion” during the training.

“Sometimes  I  thought  that  the  group  leader  was 
oversimplifying  this  and  was  being  condescend-
ing.  We  have  particular  problems  as  a  group.  We 
deal with pervasive emotion dysregulation, and the 
leader must acknowledge that”.

With  regard  to  facilitators,  most  participants  (12/20; 
60%)  pointed  to  the  value  of  the  group  format,  as  see-
ing others experiencing difficult times helped to validate 

“You can tell that the therapist practices these skills 
… and I wanted to be a little bit like him, if only just 
a little!”

The role of practice was also considered pivotal to inte-
grating the concepts learned during the sessions. A high 
proportion  (15/20;  75%)  of  participants  highlighted  the 
importance of having previously attended DBT-ST before 
being introduced to these new skills:

“Five years ago, I would not have had the necessary 
skills  to  understand  these.  I  could  neither  under-
stand nor regulate my emotions. I was in a very dark 
place”.

“Some  years  ago,  I  felt  that  I  was  living  in  a  storm 
most of the time. If somebody had said to me `look 
at  the  sun`,  I  would  not  have  been  able  to  do  so.  I 
would  have  thought:  what  are  you  talking  about? 
Some years ago, the content of these practices would 
have been impossible for me to understand”.

Lastly, in relation to the effects of the intervention, sev-
eral  participants  perceived  a  decrease  in  self-judgment 
upon completion of training:

“Now that we have finished the training, I notice that 
I am more kind to myself … I have to work on this a 
lot, but I am starting to see the effects”.

An increased capacity to notice small things that hap-

pened during the day was also relevant for many:

“I  have  learned  that  good  things  happen  to  me 
despite  feeling  pain,  so  I  can  feel  bad  about  some-
thing and still appreciate good things in my life …”

The effects of the practices were also evident in terms 
of  interpersonal  relations,  with  participants  finding 
themselves  to  be  “less  reactive,”  “less  judgmental,”  and 
“more compassionate” towards others:

“Being  more  self-compassionate  and  more  in  touch 
with  positive  emotions  is  something  that  has  not 
only helped me, but it has kind of expanded to other 
people in my life”.

“My  daughter  and  I  do  not  get  along.  She  is  going 
through  adolescence,  and  now  I  am  more  aware  of 
the  details.  I  sometimes  notice  that  she  does  things 
that make me happy”.

Based  on  the  participants’  feedback,  the  researchers 
rated each skill and strategy used in the group interven-
tions as useful (or beneficial effects reported), neutral, or 
not useful (or adverse effects reported). Fig. 1 shows the 
mean  rating  of  each  skill  and  strategy  in  terms  of  their 
perceived  effects.  On  average,  the  skills  related  to  self-
compassion  and  the  My  Best  Possible  Self  strategy  were 
evaluated  as  neutral,  while  the  other  skills  were  better 
accepted and generally rated as useful.

Discussion
This  qualitative  study  was  performed  to  examine  the 
feasibility  and  acceptability  of  an  add-on  skills  training 
intervention involving the combination of DBT-ST, posi-
tive  psychology,  and  contextual-based  skills.  This  com-
bined intervention was implemented in a clinical setting 
to treat long-lasting BPD in a group of patients who had 
previously  undergone  DBT-ST.  The  intervention  was 
feasible to implement in this real-world setting and par-
ticipants  rated  the  final  set  of  skills  highly.  Most  of  the 
practices were considered useful.

DBT-ST  primarily  addresses  the  first  stage  of  DBT 
treatment,  mostly  focusing  on  reducing  life-threaten-
ing  behaviors  and  provide  the  emotional  regulation  and 
tolerance  required  in  order  to  then  shift  the  emphasis 
to  trauma-related  symptoms  in  stage  2.  In  this  regard, 
strategies  that  facilitate  the  transition  to  stages  3  and  4 

of  DBT  in  patients  with  long-lasting  BPD  are  needed, 
with  a  focus  on  enhancing  connectedness  and  reduc-
ing  the  sense  of  emptiness.  Positive  interventions  could 
help to promote both of these aims. A strategy designed 
to  increase  positive  emotions  would  seem  appropri-
ate  once  behavioral  decontrol  has  been  overcome  when 
further  clinical  improvement  may  come  at  the  cost  of 
social  isolation,  low  mood,  and  generalized  avoidance 
[2].  Accordingly,  we  developed  and  implemented  a  pilot 
PP-based intervention (WTCP [15];). Given the need to 
align therapeutic goals with patient perspectives on per-
sonal recovery, we used interview groups to obtain feed-
back  from  participants,  and  then  used  this  information 
to  progressively  adapt  and  improve  the  intervention  by 
eliminating the least useful practices while retaining the 
practices that participants considered helpful.

Positive skills

For  most  participants,  practicing  positive  skills  such  as 
gratitude, savoring, and working with personal strengths 
was associated with an increase in positive emotions, in 
line  with  the  findings  described  by  [39]).  This  improve-
ment in positive emotions is consistent with other stud-
ies that have shown an association between savoring and 
decreases in negative affect and self-reported depressive 
symptoms [40], and between savoring and increased hap-
piness and satisfaction [41, 44]. Previous studies have also 

Fig. 1 

Soler et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2022) 9:34 

Page 11 of 14

found  that  gratitude  has  positive  effects  in  non-clinical 
populations by reducing repetitive negative thinking [37], 
increasing  positive  emotions  [22],  and  potentially  even 
direct reducing suicidal ideation [48]. Interestingly, prac-
ticing these positive skills not only had a beneficial effect 
on  the  participants’  emotions  and  self-awareness,  but 
they  also  had  a  positive  influence  on  interpersonal  rela-
tionships.  Overall,  the  participants  reported  a  decrease 
in self-judgment and an increase in their ability to notice 
small  positive  things.  Participants  also  reported  being 
less  reactive  and  more  compassionate  towards  others. 
Overall,  the  effects  of  these  practices  are  aligned  with 
important areas of recovery as suggested by [45]). Hence, 
it  appears  that  positive  strategies  (e.g.,  savoring,  grati-
tude, and personal strengths) may enhance the expected 
effects of  compassion-related skills to  target  the specific 
problems underlying long-lasting BPD.

Despite  the  potential  benefits  of  positive  psychol-
ogy  for  both  nonclinical  and  some  clinical  populations 
[11,  16],  the  application  of  some  of  these  strategies  in 
patients with BPD may not be suitable. For example, we 
found that imagining an optimal future was unhelpful, in 
line with the findings reported by Huffman et al [39] in a 
sample of suicidal patients. Similarly, projecting a future 
self  was  problematic  for  some  of  the  participants  in  our 
sample.

Self‑compassion skills

Self-compassion exercises also triggered difficult experi-
ences, which some patients found hard to regulate when 
they  became  aware  of  their  self-criticism.  Interestingly, 
this finding contradicts preliminary evidence from other 
studies that suggest that compassion exerts helpful effects 
in patients with personality disorders [26, 51]. However, 
the difference in these results could be attributed to the 
study cohort, which involved a mixed sample of patients 
with  personality  disorder.  Although  training  in  self-
compassion  fosters  positive  emotions  in  the  long-term, 
unpleasant emotions (especially grief, shame, and anger) 
are  likely  to  emerge  during  the  training  period,  a  phe-
nomenon known as “backdraft” [29, 75]. This “unwanted 
effect” is similar to those reported in mindfulness-based 
interventions [14], which seem to be transitory.

Sequence of skill presentation

Although  the  sequence  of  skill  presentation  in  DBT  has 
not  been  extensively  studied,  future  studies  are  needed 
to  investigate  this  aspect  in  more  detail.  Elices  and  col-
leagues  [25]  found  that  patients  with  BPD  who  partici-
pated  in  DBT  training  were  significantly  more  likely  to 
drop  out  of  treatment  when  the  first  skill  taught  was 
mindfulness  versus 
interpersonal  effectiveness  (IE). 
Those  authors  hypothesized  that  participants  may  have 

perceived  mindfulness  skills  to  be  more  anxiety-pro-
voking  and  less  connected  to  their  treatment  goals  than 
IE,  which  would  explain  the  higher  and  faster  dropout 
rate.  Interestingly,  the  patients  who  received  mindful-
ness  training  first  and  did  not  drop  out  showed  greater 
improvement  in  BPD  symptoms  compared  to  those  in 
whom  the  sequence  of  training  started  with  IE  skills;  in 
addition,  relevant  changes,  such  as  reduction  of  judg-
mental stance and defusion of self-critical thoughts, were 
only achieved throughout the mindfulness condition [10, 
25,  63].  Based  on  our  experience,  we  believe  that  self-
compassion  can  cause  short-term  discomfort  (similar 
to  that  observed  with  mindfulness),  but  this  practice  is 
likely to reduce self-invalidation, a core feature of BPD, in 
the long-term [26].

Self-criticism and self-invalidation [49] refer to two dif-
ferent but overlapping concepts. Given that self-invalida-
tion is a core aspect of BPD and that both self-criticism 
and  self-invalidation  are  cause  and  consequence  of  high 
emotional  vulnerability  that  handicap  patients’  capacity 
for  joy,  it  would  seem  appropriate  to  target  these  areas. 
A  recent  review  found  that  compassion-based  interven-
tions  reduce  self-criticism  and  that  longer  interventions 
were  associated  with  greater  effect  sizes  [74].  Conse-
quently, it is crucial to find ways to ensure that patients 
continue  with  the  intervention  for  a  sufficiently  long 
period to notice the benefits, despite the transitory back-
draft.  In  this  context,  the  sequence  in  which  different 
skills  and  practices  are  presented  appears  to  play  a  key 
role.  For  example,  training  loving-kindness  before  com-
passion appears to be beneficial, especially in participants 
with  long-lasting  BPD  because  loving-kindness  training 
increases positive emotions and fosters greater openness 
towards other practices, such as compassion. Our experi-
ence  suggests  that  the  transition  between  the  two  prac-
tices  is  easier  than  if  offered  in  reverse  order,  but  more 
research is needed to test this hypothesis.

Barriers and facilitators

In  our  study,  some  participants  described  “moodiness” 
as  an  internal  barrier  to  practice.  As  some  participants 
noted,  they  did  not  always  feel  “open”  to  the  practice, 
which  suggests  that  a  certain  degree  of  emotion  regula-
tion  may  be  necessary  before  practicing  certain  skills. 
In  this  context,  it  is  worth  noting  that  all  of  the  partici-
pants  had  previously  received  DBT-ST  before  enroll-
ing in the current study. As a result, their prior training 
provided them with the personal resources necessary to 
face  distressing  emotions  provoked  by  new  skills.  Sev-
eral  internal  barriers  to  practice  were  detected,  making 
these  potential  targets  for  future  studies.  Indeed,  defu-
sion  strategies  were  needed  to  address  these  barriers, 

 Soler et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2022) 9:34 

Page 12 of 14

mainly  the  “wise  matrix”  tool  which  we  developed  for 
this intervention.

External barriers were mostly related to the attitude of 
group  leaders  and  language-related  issues.  For  example, 
the  use  of  concepts  such  as  “happiness”  and  “self-com-
passion” had a negative impact. Talking about “increasing 
happiness”  evoked  unrealistic  expectations,  which  was 
experienced by some participants as something that “can-
not be achieved”. As a result, this caused frustration and 
was perceived as invalidating for most of the participants. 
The main “facilitating” factor was the group therapy for-
mat, as it can reduce feelings of being “weird” or “alone”.

Strengths and limitations

This  study  has  several  limitations.  First,  the  sample  was 
predominantly  female  and  Caucasian,  and  all  partici-
pants  had  prior  experience  with  DBT-ST.  In  addition, 
only  the  participants  who  had  completed  the  full  inter-
vention  took  part  in  the  post-treatment  group  discus-
sions.  Unfortunately,  as  occurs  in  many  qualitative 
research  studies,  we  were  unable  to  explore  the  experi-
ences  of  the  participants  who  dropped  out.  In  addition, 
due  to  the  preliminary  study  design  (aimed  at  assessing 
feasibility  and  acceptability),  we  did  not  use  validated 
measures to assess the impact of the intervention on dif-
ferent  domains.  Similarly,  we  did  not  track  home  prac-
tice, and therefore, we cannot make any definitive claims 
about  the  association  between  adherence  to  practice 
and the effects thereof. We used a series of broad ques-
tions to elicit a wide range of responses. As a result, the 
participants’  statements  about  the  intervention  were 
spontaneously  reported.  We  purposely  did  not  ask 
about specific skills, as we assumed that skills not men-
tioned were neither helpful nor unhelpful. In retrospect, 
it  might  have  been  better  to  specifically  ask  about  each 
skill  and  it  would  probably  be  beneficial  in  future  stud-
ies to do so. Despite these limitations, the study also has 
several  important  strengths.  First,  the  findings  broaden 
our  understanding  of  the  feasibility  and  acceptability  of 
a positive-contextual psychology skills training interven-
tion  in  patients  with  long-lasting  BPD.  This  study  also 
represents an important first-step towards facilitating the 
transition to stages 3 and 4 of DBT, and towards develop-
ing a targeted program whose efficacy could be evaluated 
in future research studies. In addition, by examining the 
specific skills rather than the final “package”, we increased 
our understanding of the processes of change in psycho-
therapy, which is congruent with new approaches in the 
field such as the process-based framework [16].

Conclusions
In this qualitative study, we examined the feasibility and 
acceptability  of  a  novel  8-week  intervention  designed  to 
treat  long-lasting  BPD.  The  intervention  was  feasible  to 
implement in the clinical setting and the final set of skills 
was highly rated by participants, who considered most of 
these  strategies/skills  to  be  useful.  By  using  the  partici-
pants’ feedback to modify the intervention, we were able 
to  substantially  improve  retention  rates  (an  additional 
measure  of  acceptability),  which  doubled  from  40%  in 
the first group to 80% in the final group. More research is 
needed to test the efficacy of this intervention to promote 
life fulfillment in participants with long-lasting BPD.
