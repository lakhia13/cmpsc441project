Abstract 
Background  Children with genetic conditions are at increased risk for mental health and neurodevelopmental 
problems, often accompanied by significant parental distress. Genetic and family factors can impact children and par‑
ents’ mental health. Early parenting interventions, like the Incredible Years® programs, have demonstrated to improve 
parental distress and children’s mental health. The recent version for young children with language delays or autism 
spectrum disorder (IY‑ASLD®) has shown to be feasible and effective to support parents in their children’s develop‑
mental trajectories. The effectiveness of treatments for children with genetic conditions and neurodevelopmental 
problems is largely unexplored, leaving significant gaps in evidence‑based options. Clinicians lack guidance, especially 
when patients exhibit language or social communication impairments but do not meet diagnostic criteria for a full‑
blown autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We aim to fill this gap, providing evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness 
of the IY‑ASLD® intervention for such patients.

Methods  We designed a prospective multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial including approximately 
68 children aged 3 to 7 years, recruited from three tertiary care reference hospitals. Inclusion criteria will necessitate 
genetic confirmation of a neurodevelopmental disorder along with language, communication, or socialization dif‑
ficulties. Individuals with an ASD diagnosis will be excluded. All subjects are included in a territorial register for rare 
conditions (ReMin, Registre de Malalties Minoritàries de Catalunya). Families will randomly be assigned to the inter‑
vention or the control group. The intervention will be held online by clinical psychologists and child and adolescent 
psychiatrists.

Discussion  Our group has recently piloted the online implementation of the IY‑ASLD® intervention for the first time 
in Spain, for parents of children with language delays, socialization difficulties, or ASD, but not genetically deter‑
mined. Our multicenter research consortium is well‑positioned to recruit patients with rare conditions and imple‑
ment efficient treatment pathways within the National Health System. Given the geographical dispersion of families 
affected by rare conditions, the online format offers logistical advantages and improved therapy access, enhancing

Background
Children  with  genetic  syndromes  commonly  pre-
sent  neurodevelopmental  problems  and  mental  health 
comorbidities  [1–3].  These  difficulties  often  manifest 
in  early  stages,  including  developmental  issues  with 
social  communication,  emotion,  and  behavior  regula-
tion. The persistence of these symptoms can negatively 
affect  children’s  developmental  trajectories,  including 
the  emergence  of  social  dysfunction,  comorbid  mental 
health disorders, and future maladaptation [4]. Despite 
the complex phenotypic presentations of children with 
genetic syndromes, and the high prevalence of impair-
ing  symptoms,  they  have  not  been  thoroughly  studied 
from  a  developmental  perspective.  Additionally,  par-
ents  of  children  with  early  neurodevelopmental  prob-
lems  often  report  elevated  distress  levels  and  mental 
health difficulties, which may, in turn, potentially affect 
their children’s mental health [5, 6].

Thus,  early  intervention  is  crucial  to  improve  these 
outcomes  in  children  with  neurodevelopmental  prob-
lems.  Early  signs  of  concern,  such  as  communication, 
socialization, or dysregulation problems, should be tar-
geted and treated, with no need to wait for a full-blown 
diagnosis. This dimensional approach allows treatment 
to reach young children with a broad spectrum of neu-
rodevelopmental  difficulties,  rather  than  being  lim-
ited  to  particular  diagnostic  categories.  In  this  regard, 
young  children  with  genetic  conditions  and  mental 
health  problems  represent  a  clinical  and  research  pri-
ority.  Firstly,  children  with  genetic  syndromes  have 
complex  heterogeneous  clinical  presentations,  both 
within  and  between  genetic  conditions.  Their  atypical 
symptoms  rarely  meet  full  criteria  for  mental  health 
disorders  categorically  classified  in  the  Diagnostic  and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM),  despite 
impairing  children’s  functioning  [7].  Consequently, 
their  mental  health  problems  are  typically  overlooked, 
and early treatment opportunities are missed. This can 
worsen  their  development  and  mental  health  course 
and  future  prognosis.  Secondly,  generating  knowledge 
in  this  group  of  children  is  challenging  due  to  the  rar-
ity  of  their  conditions,  making  it  difficult  to  achieve 
a  critical  mass  and  statistical  soundness.  Finally, 
these  patients  are  geographically  dispersed,  posing  a 

challenge in ensuring equitable access to intensive evi-
dence-based treatments [8].

In  view  of  such  particularities,  the  assistance  of  these 
patients  requires  a  flexible  health  system,  a  dimensional 
mental  health  perspective,  and  a  collaborative  scientific 
approach  in  order  to  efficiently  diagnose  and  treat  their 
impairing mental health symptoms. Their care pathways 
need  to  be  implemented  in  early  childhood,  following 
standardized  interventions  for  homogeneous  groups  of 
patients, and led by experienced clinicians. These specific 
conditions can only be effectively managed by highly spe-
cialized  multidisciplinary  teams  with  extensive  knowl-
edge of their unique characteristics, providing assistance 
to a large patient population.

Young  children  with  genetic  conditions  present  par-
ticular  behavioral  phenotypes  (i.e.,  a  characteristic 
pattern of cognitive, linguistic, social, and motor abnor-
malities), which commonly overlap with recognized diag-
nosis  such  as  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD).  Despite 
the  high  prevalence  of  ASD  in  children  with  genetic 
syndromes  (greater  than  50%  in  Sotos  syndrome  or 
duplication  15q11q13,  but  also  relevant  in  Prader-Willi 
syndrome  (13%)  and  Williams  syndrome  (12%),  among 
others) [1–3, 9, 10], a growing body of evidence suggests 
that  these  individuals  might  have  an  atypical  profile  of 
ASD  phenomenology,  distinct  from  idiopathic  ASD  [2]. 
More than 21 genetic syndromes have been described to 
present autistic-like behaviors, such as social deficits and 
repetitive  behaviors,  which  might  not  meet  full  criteria 
for an ASD diagnosis [11–16].

Unfortunately,  these  patients  are  less  likely  to  access 
interventions  targeting  their  impairing  symptoms,  as 
there  is  a  lack  of  evidence  regarding  effective  treatment 
options,  and  only  the  most  severe  cases  with  promi-
nent  symptoms  in  all  domains  are  referred  to  ASD  care 
pathways.

Early  parenting 

interventions  have 

increasingly 
shown  a  large  and  sustained  effect  on  children  neu-
rodevelopmental  and  mental  health  outcomes  [17–
19]. Group interventions show promise, at a relatively 
low-cost,  as  a  valuable  resource  to  help  parents  cope 
with  children’s  behavioral,  social,  and  emotional  dif-
ficulties. This therapeutic approach has demonstrated 
effectiveness  in  improving  dysfunctional  parenting

styles,  reducing  children’s  behavioral  problems,  and 
increasing  parents’  ability  to  facilitate  their  children’s 
communication  skills  and  vocabulary  [20].  Group 
interventions  also  provide  social  support  for  parents. 
This  is  especially  important  for  parents  of  children 
with  genetic  syndromes,  who  present  high  stress  lev-
els  as  well  as  a  lack  of  structured  guidance  on  effec-
tive ways to promote their children’s development and 
mental health [5, 6].

The Incredible Years® (IY®) parenting programs [21] 
are  a  set  of  interventions  recommended  by  the  NICE 
guidelines  to  improve  parenting  skills  and  children’s 
behavioral problems [22]. The effectiveness of the IY® 
parenting  programs  has  been  widely  demonstrated 
in  multiple  randomized  controlled  trials,  showing 
an  improvement  in  parental  stress  levels,  depression, 
and  parental  coping,  as  well  as  in  children’s  behavior 
difficulties  [23,  24].  Specifically,  the  IY®  program  has 
been adapted to target the needs and concerns of par-
ents of young children in the autism spectrum or with 
language  delays  (IY-ASLD®)  [25].  A  pragmatic  ran-
domized  controlled  trial  has  supported  the  feasibil-
ity  and  acceptance  of  delivering  this  intervention  for 
ASD children in the UK National Health Service [26]. 
Within  the  Spanish  mental  health  system,  this  pro-
gram has recently been piloted for parents of children 
with  ASD  and  preterm  children  with  communication 
or socialization difficulties [27], showing high satisfac-
tion  and  compliance  with  the  intervention  [28].  How-
ever, this intervention has never been implemented for 
children with neurodevelopmental problems related to 
genetic syndromes, a particularly vulnerable and hard-
to-ascertain sample.

Objectives
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  is  to  examine  the 
feasibility  and  preliminary  effectiveness  of  the  IY-
ASLD®  intervention  for  children  with  genetic  syn-
dromes  and  mental  health  problems.  Specifically,  we 
aim  to  evaluate  the  parental  and  clinician  compliance 
and satisfaction with the intervention.

Additionally,  we  seek  to  gather  preliminary  evi-
dence on its effectiveness in reducing parental distress, 
enhancing  parenting  skills,  improving  parent–child 
relationships, and, secondarily, addressing overall chil-
dren’s mental health problems.

To  achieve  these  goals,  we  designed  a  randomized 
controlled  trial  that  will,  for  the  first  time,  overcome 
challenges  associated  with  the  limited  availability  of 
knowledge and its geographical dispersion when treat-
ing children with rare genetic syndromes.

Methods
Design and setting

We  will  conduct  a  randomized,  controlled,  parallel-
group,  exploratory  trial  within  the  Spanish  Public 
Health System, where participating families will be ran-
domly  allocated  to  the  intervention  group  (receiving 
the  IY-ASLD®  program)  or  to  the  treatment  as  usual 
(TAU) group on a 1:1 ratio.

The GAP project will be conducted from March 2023 
to  September  2024  in  three  tertiary  care  hospitals  in 
the  province  of  Barcelona  (Sant  Joan  de  Déu  Hospi-
tal  (SJDH),  Vall  d’Hebron  Hospital  (VHH),  and  Parc 
Taulí  Hospital  (PTH))  conforming  together  a  territo-
rial  expertise  network  (XUEC-MCC:  Xarxa  d’Unitats 
d’expertesa clínica-malalties minoritàries cognitiu con-
ductuals).  This  network  was  created  and  accredited  in 
2015  to  guarantee  equal  and  full  access  to  health  and 
research  opportunities  regardless  of  geographic  loca-
tion  for  children  with  genetic  syndromes  that  are 
included  in  the  rare  conditions  register  (ReMin,  Reg-
istre  de  Malalties  Minoritàries  de  Catalunya).  This  is 
the  most  exhaustive  national  registry  and  is  custodied 
by the National Health System (CatSalut). This registry 
provides access to a sample that is difficult to ascertain, 
thereby  overcoming  the  rarity  of  genetic  conditions. 
The  three  participating  hospitals  have  multidiscipli-
nary units led by a patient-centered policy that can go 
beyond institutional or geographical limits.

Eligibility criteria

Participating  families  will  be  recruited  from  the  three

hospitals.  Figure  1  shows  the  recruitment  process  that 
will be followed. Clinicians will present the study to pre-
selected eligible families and will ask them for permission 
to  be  contacted  by  the  research  assistant,  who  will  then 
explain  the  study  further.  If  the  family  is  interested,  an 
appointment to evaluate all the inclusion criteria will be 
set up and the parents will be asked to sign the informed 
consent and to complete the pre-intervention assessment 
(see  “Eligibility  criteria”  section).  Any  children  excluded 
from  the  study  at  that  point  due  to  scoring  above  diag-
nostic cut-off for ASD at the ADOS-2 will be referred for 
a specialized mental health assessment within the public 
system. Participants will be able to discontinue the treat-
ment sessions or drop out from the control group at any 
point  at  their  request.  The  participation  or  disengage-
ment from the study will not affect their usual treatment.
The  sample  size  was  primarily  based  on  the  recom-
mendations  for  feasibility  studies  [29,  30],  which  sug-
gest sample sizes of between 24 and 55 participants, and 
on  similar  previous  studies  [26,  31].  Secondarily,  we  did 
a  sample  size  calculation  based  on  the  main  secondary 
outcome, parental stress, measured through the Parental 
Stress  Index  Short  Form  (PSI-SF)  questionnaire  [32],  as 
previous  studies  [31]  have  used  PSI  to  estimate  sample 
sizes. This is a 36-item scale, with a range of 180 points. 
There  is  data  showing  that  a  decrease  of  16.5  points  in 
the total scale stress score can be seen after attending an 
IY program [33]. Given that this study will be conducted 
with parents of children presenting neurodevelopmental 
difficulties, we anticipated that the decrease in the PSI-SF 
score  would  be  lower.  We  estimated  the  necessary  sam-
ple size considering a power of 80%, α = 0.05, a difference 
between  pre-  and  post-test  of  10  points,  and  a  standard 
deviation  of  20,  using  a  paired-samples  t-test.  We  esti-
mated 34 participants needed per arm of the study. Thus, 
we  aim  to  recruit  approximately  68  participants.  The 
dropout rate has not been included when calculating the 
sample size, considering that a sample of 68 participants 
is similar than previous studies [26, 31] and in line with 
recommendations  by  the  National  Institute  of  Health 
Research [29]. Using the public registry for rare diseases 
(ReMin:  Registre  de  Malalties  Minoritàries)  we  have 
identified a minimum number of 184 patients within the 
age interval and confirmed genetic syndrome (see inclu-
sion criteria above).

Regarding the sample size for the individual interviews 
that  will  be  conducted  with  parents  after  the  interven-
tion,  a  minimum  of  two  parents  of  each  intervention 
group will be interviewed. We will aim for a representa-
tive sample in terms of children’s diagnosis, age, and gen-
der. Parents who drop out from the intervention will also 
be invited to be interviewed. Data saturation will be used 
to determine the final sample size.

For  the  post-intervention  individual  interviews  with 
clinicians,  all  clinicians  who  delivered  the  intervention 
will be interviewed after the intervention phase.

Randomization

Randomization (intervention or TAU condition on a 1:1 
ratio)  will  take  place  once  all  the  participating  families 
have  completed  baseline  measures.  Once  included  in 
the  trial,  the  randomization  code  will  be  generated  cen-
trally  by  a  statistician  using  PROC  PLAN  available  in 
the SAS® version 9.4 statistical program. One list will be 
generated  with  blocks.  The  seed  number  will  be  chosen 
randomly  using  RANUNI  (function  available  in  SAS), 
because  random  numbers  are  known  to  follow  a  uni-
form  distribution.  Allocation  will  be  stratified  by  cogni-
tion  developmental  level  depending  on  the  final  sample 
characteristics  (Developmental  Profile-3  (DP-3)  cogni-
tion scale below or above 70). An independent researcher 
will  carry  out  the  randomization  process,  and  research-
ers  responsible  for  recruitment  or  intervention  delivery 
will not be involved. Due to the pragmatic and clinically 
focused nature of the study, further blinding procedures 
will not be possible.

Intervention

Clinical  psychologists  (ME,  LM,  IS,  BM)  and  child  psy-
chiatrists (LV, MLL, GE, SP) working in specialized men-
tal  health  services  for  neurodevelopmental  disorders 
within the three hospitals will deliver the intervention.

The  IY-ASLD®  program  [25]  encourages  positive  par-
ent–child  relationships  to  promote  children’s  social 
competence,  peer  relationships,  language  skills,  pre-
academic  coaching,  and  emotion  and  behavior  regula-
tion.  The  intervention  encourages  parents  to  play  in  a 
child-directed way but with a specific focus on enhancing 
children’s communication and social engagement. It also 
focuses on how to use positive discipline to set limits and 
handle  misbehavior.  During  the  coronavirus  disease-19 
(COVID-19) pandemic, the IY-ASLD® program develop-
ers adapted the intervention to be performed online (22 
sessions  approximately).  Each  group  includes  a  maxi-
mum  of  8–10  participants,  although  the  online  format 
recommends  keeping  the  number  of  participants  in  the 
lower range, particularly if children have complex clinical 
presentations. The intervention includes video modeling, 
role-playing,  and  discussion  activities  with  parents  and 
emphasizes  the  importance  of  practice-based  learning 
in  the  sessions  and  at  home.  Families  will  be  contacted 
weekly  between  sessions  to  encourage  home-based 
practice.

Fidelity to the treatment manual will be ensured in dif-
ferent ways. The intervention will be conducted by expe-
rienced psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, officially 

 Serrano et al. Trials          (2024) 25:496

trained in the IY-ASLD® model and its online adaptation 
by  an  accredited  trainer.  Group  leaders  will  complete 
weekly  fidelity  checklists  and  will  receive  group  super-
vision  by  a  certified  supervisor  in  two  different  time 
points throughout the intervention. Due to the pragmatic 
nature  of  the  study,  further  supervision  or  accredita-
tion  processes  will  not  be  possible.  The  TAU  condition 
involves  outpatient  appointments  with  neuropediatri-
cians to monitor children’s developmental level and drug 
prescription  when  needed.  All  children  under  5  years 
of age are also treated in Early Childhood Developmen-
tal  Centers  based  in  the  community,  where  they  receive 
individual unstructured interventions to foster children’s 
development. Children aged over 5 years might or might 
not receive psychological or psychiatric treatment in spe-
cialized  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  community 

centers. Families allocated to the intervention group will 
also receive TAU.

Measures

Table 1 summarizes the study timeline and the measures 
that will be used.

Baseline and sample descriptors

At  baseline,  sociodemographic  and  children  clinical 
variables will be collected from clinical notes and parent 
reports.  Socioeconomic  status  will  be  determined  using 
Hollingdale’s Index of Social Position [34].

The  following  questionnaires,  which  have  already 
shown  valid  and  reliable  results  in  children  with  neu-
rodevelopmental  problems,  will  be  administered  before 
the intervention:

•  Social  Communication  Questionnaire  (SCQ)  [35]: 
this  screening  tool  is  a  40-item  parent  report  meas-
ure, with a yes/no format, based on the Autism Diag-
nostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) [36]. The Lifetime 
version  of  the  questionnaire  will  be  applied  to  all 
children, from 3 to 7 years old. Children are likely to 
be  on  the  autism  spectrum  when  their  total  scores 
are 8 or higher.

•  Autism  Diagnostic  Observation  Schedule  (ADOS-
2)  [37]:  it  is  a  semi-structured  assessment  of  social 
interaction,  communication,  and  play  exposing  the 
child  to  situations  that  elicit  spontaneous  behav-
iors  in  standardized  contexts.  Modules  1  to  3  will 
be  selected  in  accordance  to  the  children’s  language 
level. To receive an autism spectrum diagnosis by the 
ADOS-2 algorithm, an individual’s score must exceed 
a total cut-off score.

•  Vineland  Adaptive  Behavior  Scale-III  (VABS-III, 
parent/caregiver  report  form)  [38]:  it  assesses  the 
adaptive  functioning  of  the  child  in  the  family  envi-
ronment.  It  is  composed  of  the  following  domains: 
communication,  socialization,  daily  life  skills,  and 
motor  skills.  It  also  generates  an  index  of  adaptive 
behavior.

•  Developmental  Profile-3  (DP-3)  [39]:  this  is  a  180-
item parental questionnaire assessing developmental 
delays in different domains: motor, adaptative, socio-
emotional,  cognitive,  and  communication.  It  also 
computes an overall general development score.

•  Child  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL  1.5–5  and  6–18) 
[40,  41]:  this  questionnaire  is  a  component  of  the 
Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment 
(ASEBA). It is a parent-reported 99-item (CBCL 1.5–
5)  and  113-item  (CBCL  6–18)  inventory  that  meas-
ures adaptive functioning and behavioral, emotional, 
and social problems. It is made up of eight syndrome 
scales,  which  are  grouped  into  two  main  categories: 
internalizing  and  externalizing.  The  sum  of  scores 
forms  a  total  problem  score,  and  it  also  includes 
subdomains.  This  questionnaire  will  also  be  admin-
istered after the intervention as an exploratory meas-
ure.

Outcome measures

Primary outcomes (feasibility) 

•  Parents’  engagement  with  the  program  and  partici-
pant retention will be monitored weekly throughout 
the intervention using an attendance sheet, expecting 

they  will  attend  at  least  15/22  sessions  with  a  mini-
mum of 50% of parents finishing the program.

•  Autism Program Parent Weekly Evaluation [42]: this 
instrument is part of the IY-ASLD® program materi-
als  and  will  be  administered  weekly  throughout  the 
intervention to collect information regarding parents’ 
compliance and satisfaction.

•  Autism Program Parent Final Satisfaction Question-
naire  [42]:  this  questionnaire  is  included  within  the 
IY-ASLD®  program.  It  will  be  used  to  measure  the 
acceptability  and  satisfaction  with  the  intervention 
after the last session.

•  Parents’  overall  experiences  with  the  program  will 
be explored by means of individual interviews. These 
interviews will be conducted after the last session to 
explore  from  a  qualitative  perspective:  (1)  parents’ 
acceptability, satisfaction, and overall experience with 
the  intervention  and  (2)  parents’  perceived  changes 
in their parenting skills and parental distress after the 
intervention.

•  Clinicians’ experiences with the intervention will also 
be qualitatively assessed by means of individual inter-
views with all clinicians who delivered the interven-
tion. These interviews will be conducted after the last 
session.

Secondary  outcomes  (effectiveness 
for  parental  out-
comes)  All the following questionnaires will be admin-
istered before and after the intervention:

•  Parent Stress Inventory-Short Form (PSI-SF) [32, 43]: 
36-item questionnaire to assess parental stress asso-
ciated with the care of their offspring. It is aimed at 
parents of children from 1 month to 12 years of age. 
It has three domains: parental distress, parent–child 
dysfunctional  interaction,  and  difficult  child,  which 
combine to form a total stress scale.

•  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI)  [44]:  21-item 
screening  tool  assessing  the  severity  of  depressive 
symptoms.  It  is  a  standardized  and  validated  ques-
tionnaire, often used in adults’ mood disorder assess-
ments.

•  Alabama Parenting Questionnaire-Preschool revision 
(APQ-Pr)  [45]:  32-item  parent-reported  question-
naire  measuring  parenting  practices  associated  with 
disruptive child behaviors. This version has 3 dimen-
sions: positive parenting, inconsistent parenting, and 
punitive parenting.

•  Autism-Specific  Five  Minute  Speech  Sample 
(ASFMSS)  [46]:  this  is  a  narrative  5-min  interview 
used  to  measure  parental  expressed  emotions  for 
children  with  ASD  and  related  disorders.  Parents 

 Serrano et al. Trials          (2024) 25:496

are asked to speak about their child and the parent–
child  relationship.  Speech  samples  are  audiotaped, 
transcribed, and coded following six global catego-
ries:  (a)  initial  statement,  (b)  warmth,  (c)  relation-
ship,  (d)  emotional  over-involvement,  (e)  critical 
comments,  and  (f )  positive  comments.  This  tool 
has  been  translated  and  validated  in  Spanish  fami-
lies [47].

Other  exploratory  measures  Preliminary  effective-
ness  of  the  intervention  on  children’s  problems  will 
be  explored  with  the  Child  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL 
explained above).

Qualitative data collection and analysis

Interviews  with  parents  and  clinicians  will  take  place 
after finishing the intervention. They will be conducted 
online by a psychologist trained in qualitative methods 
and will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

A  qualitative  thematic  analysis  will  be  performed  to 
analyze the data. All transcripts will be coded, analyzed, 
and  discussed  by  at  least  two  independent  researchers 
not  involved  in  the  intervention  delivery.  The  coding 
process will be inductive: themes and associated codes 
will be generated from the interviews data. The coding 
process will be supported by the software Atlas.ti.

Data collection and data analysis
Quantitative data collection and analysis

Data  will  be  collected  at  baseline  (before  perform-
ing  randomization)  and  after  finishing  the  IY-ASLD® 
intervention.  Parents  consenting  to  participate  will  be 
offered  a  hospital  appointment  with  a  research  assis-
tant  to  evaluate  children  inclusion  criteria  (children 
questionnaires  and  ADOS-2).  If  the  child  meets  inclu-
sion  criteria,  parents  will  be  contacted  on  the  phone 
to  complete  the  remaining  questionnaires  (including 
all  children  descriptors,  effectiveness  parental  out-
come measures, and the ASFMFSS voice recording). If 
both parents agree to participate in the study, they will 
fill  out  children  measures  together  by  consensus  and 
parental outcome measures individually.

Descriptive  analyses  will  be  used  for  recruitment, 
attrition, and satisfaction rates of the participants with 
the  program.  Differences  in  baseline  and  descriptive 
variables  between  intervention  and  TAU  conditions 
will  be  described  and  controlled  in  the  main  analyses. 
For  effectiveness  outcomes,  the  analysis  will  follow  an 
intention-to-treat  basis.  Relevant  confounding  varia-
bles, such as sociodemographic variables, developmen-
tal level, or treatment site, will be added as covariates. 
Statistical  analysis  will  be  performed  using  SPSS  (IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY). The Wilcoxon test will be used to 
compare quantitative paired variables between the dif-
ferent evaluations through time. Chi-square test will be 
used to compare categorical variables with effectiveness 
variables.  Spearman’s  rank  correlation  coefficient  test 
will  be  applied  to  study  the  relationship  between  the 
quantitative  variables  (such  as  clinical  scores).  We  will 
also estimate 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes.
All  statistical  analyses  will  be  two-sided  and  p  val-

ues < 0.05 will be considered significant.

Imputation  models  will  be  used  to  handle  missing 

data.

Ethical issues

Signed informed consent will be obtained from the par-
ents/caregivers  of  study  participants.  The  study  proto-
col and consents will be reviewed and approved by the 
ethics  committee  of  each  participating  site:  Research 
& Ethics Committee of SJDH, Clinical Research Ethics 
Committee  (CEIm)  of  VHH,  and  Committee  for  Ethi-
cal Clinical Investigation of PTH. A copy of the consent 
will  be  given  to  the  patient’s  parent/caregiver.  All  data 
will  be  anonymized  and  stored  by  the  research  group. 
The  study  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the 
Declaration  of  Helsinki,  Good  Clinical  Practices,  and 
applicable  regulatory  requirements.  Our  data  man-
agement  plan  will  consider  FAIR  principles  (Findable, 
Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable). Also, as it is 
a research project on rare diseases, it will also consider 
the  principles  established  by  the  International  Rare 
Diseases Research Consortium.

Any modifications to the protocol which may impact 
on  the  conduct  of  the  study,  potential  benefit  of  the 
patient  or  may  affect  patient  safety,  including  changes 
of  study  objectives,  study  design,  patient  population, 
sample sizes, study procedures, or significant adminis-
trative aspects will require a formal amendment to the 
protocol. Such amendment will be agreed upon by the 
research  group  and  approved  by  the  Ethics  Commit-
tee prior to implementation. It will also be registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov.

As  The  GAP  involves  a  low-risk  intervention,  a  data 
monitoring  committee  was  not  required  by  the  com-
petent ethics committees, and there are no anticipated 
problems  detrimental  to  participants.  Any  adverse 
events and other unintended effects will be reported to 
the  ethics  committees.  Following  their  advice,  mitiga-
tion  plans  will  be  implemented  accordingly  before  the 
next intervention session.

The  project  management  group  will  meet  bimonthly 
to review trial conduct and will be in close contact with 

Serrano et al. Trials          (2024) 25:496

the Ethics Committees. This process will be independ-
ent from investigators and the sponsor.

We used the SPIRIT checklist when writing our report 

[48] (see Supplementary File 2).

Dissemination plans
The  results  of  the  study,  regardless  of  whether  they  are 
in  favor  of  the  intervention  or  TAU  group,  or  inconclu-
sive,  will  be  published  in  a  peer-reviewed  journal.  Indi-
viduals  with  rare  conditions  can  often  be  identified  by 
their  unique  molecular  findings,  making  it  challenging 
to  share  data  without  revealing  their  identity.  However, 
open-access  publication  with  exhaustive  data  in  supple-
mentary  files  is  part  of  our  plan.  Additionally,  preprint 
open-access  websites  will  be  used  once  the  results  are 
ready  to  be  submitted  for  publication.  The  investigators 
will also communicate the trial results to the national and 
international  scientific  community  and  healthcare  pro-
viders  at  different  conferences.  The  results  will  also  be 
shared  through  social  media  channels  of  the  participat-
ing hospitals and sponsor, as well as through the Centro 
de Investigación Biomédica en Red Enfermedades Raras 
(CIBERER)  and  Fundació  de  Recerca  i  Docència  Sant 
Joan  de  Déu’s  websites.  A  lay  summary  will  be  shared 
with  all  project  participants  and  with  rare  conditions’ 
patients’ and families’ associations. The trial registry will 
be updated.

We  do  not  intend  to  use  professional  writers  for  our 
publications.  Authorship  eligibility  will  be  based  on  the 
recommendations from the International Committees of 
Medical Journal Editors.

Discussion
To  our  knowledge,  there  is  no  existing  evidence  on 
group-based  parenting  programs  for  children  with 
genetic  syndromes  and  early  neurodevelopmental  prob-
lems.  The  results  of  the  current  study  would  provide 
novel evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of the 
IY-ASLD® intervention implemented in existing services. 
This  would  also  inform  policy  makers  on  new  and  effi-
cient  care  pathways  for  such  vulnerable  and  overlooked 
group of patients.

The  implementation  of  this  intervention  has  been 
piloted in the National Health Service in the UK. A prag-
matic,  feasibility  randomized  controlled  trial  was  done 
with 29 parents treated with 12 weekly face-to-face ses-
sions  and  29  parents  in  a  TAU  control  group.  Results 
showed  high  acceptability,  fidelity,  and  satisfaction  with 
the  program  [26].  The  IY-ASLD®  has  also  been  piloted 
within  the  Spanish  Mental  Health  System.  A  recent 
multicentric  randomized  pilot  study  was  conducted  by 
researchers  of  the  present  investigation  [27].  The  inter-
vention was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic 

and 22 weekly sessions were carried out online. Prelimi-
nary  results  also  showed  high  levels  of  satisfaction  and 
adherence  to  the  program  in  parents  of  young  children 
with  language  delay,  socialization  difficulties,  or  ASD 
[28].  This  suggests  that  it  is  feasible  to  implement  the 
online intervention reliably in our Public Mental Health 
System.

Neurodevelopmental  disorders  of  genetic  basis  are 
rare conditions. Their complex multiorganic implications 
lead  to  particular  clinical  presentations,  with  commonly 
underreported  associated  mental  health  difficulties  [9]. 
This study will generate novel scientific data on the phe-
notype  description  of  early  mental  health  problems  of 
young  children  with  genetic  syndromes,  as  well  as  on 
treatment  options  for  such  difficulties.  Thus,  The  GAP 
study will provide new scientific data while setting up ini-
tial  guidelines  to  implement  standards  of  mental  health 
treatment in the public mental health system.

This  scientific  gap  is  also  worrying  from  a  societal 
point of view. Families whose infants are diagnosed with 
a genetic condition face high stress levels related to par-
enting children with behavior, communication, and social 
difficulties,  and  in  relation  to  how  the  diagnosis  will 
affect  their  children’s  mental  health  [49].  In  this  regard, 
parents  tend  to  look  for  peer-to-peer  support  in  family 
associations.  The  GAP  project  will  bring  families  with 
similar problems closer, creating opportunities for peer-
to-peer support while providing rigorous and specialized 
treatment options to improve parent and children mental 
health.

The  project  will  represent  a  step  forward  in  generat-
ing  homogeneous  treatment  pathways  within  the  differ-
ent specialized genetic and mental health units that assist 
these patients in our health system.

Also,  as  the  intervention  will  be  carried  out  online, 
all  families  will  have  the  opportunity  to  access  intense 
evidence-based  treatments  regardless  of  their  area  of 
residence.  Due  to  the  geographical  breakdown  of  fami-
lies living with rare conditions, several advantages of the 
online format could be highlighted, such as better family 
logistics and improved access to therapy. Conducting this 
intervention in an online format is a challenge for clini-
cians,  but  determining  its  feasibility  will  inform  policy 
makers  of  new  treatment  options  to  be  implemented  in 
our territory. It is also of note that support groups are an 
important resource for many families living with children 
with genetic syndromes, and meeting via teleconference 
has shown to be a facilitating factor [50].

Furthermore,  we  will  combine  quantitative  and  quali-
tative methods, and this will be helpful to better under-
stand the outcomes of the study. Mixed methods research 
is  increasingly  recognized  as  valuable,  because  it  can 
potentially  draw  upon  the  strengths  and  perspectives  of 

 Serrano et al. Trials          (2024) 25:496 

Page 10 of 12

quantitative and qualitative approaches respectively [51]. 
As O’Cathain et al. [52] conclude, embedding qualitative 
methods to clinical trials can be of help in improving the 
external  validity  of  trials  or  facilitating  interpretation  of 
the trial findings, among other aspects.

As a limitation, importantly, there is great heterogene-
ity  among  different  genetically  determined  neurodevel-
opmental disorders and, within their rarity, some of them 
will  be  overrepresented  in  the  sample  due  to  greater 
prevalence.  Moreover,  it  is  unfeasible  to  have  represen-
tation of all genetic syndromes. Therefore, we may need 
to  assume  that  the  results  can  be  extrapolated  to  other 
genetic  syndromes  that  present  with  communication  or 
ASD-like symptoms. On the contrary, as a benefit of the 
overrepresentation of certain syndromes, the presence of 
a consistent group of individuals with the same adaptive 
behavioral  phenotype  divided  between  the  control  and 
the  intervention  group  will  help  to  validate  the  results, 
particularly  for  that  given  phenotype,  regardless  of  the 
neurodevelopmental genetic condition.

Another potential limitation lies within the fact that the 
IY-ASLD®  program  is  addressed  at  families  of  children 
with ASD or language delays. Considering the heteroge-
neity of syndromes that will be present at each interven-
tion  group,  some  specific  contents  of  the  intervention 
might not be relevant to some families. To mitigate this 
limitation,  groups  will  be  created  based  on  children’s 
clinical  profile  (developmental  and  language  level),  with 
the  aim  that  they  are  as  homogeneous  as  possible.  This 
will allow group leaders to focus in greater detail on the 
areas more relevant to each group of parents.

Furthermore,  despite  the  above  mentioned  advan-
tages  of  the  online  format,  this  might  entangle  its  own 
limitations as well [53], which will need to be considered 
carefully.

In summary, this study will provide with new evidence 
to guide future psychological treatments for children liv-
ing  with  genetic  conditions  and  neurodevelopmental 
problems.

Trial status
The  current  protocol  is  version  1  dated  April  21,  2024. 
The  protocol  for  the  current  study  was  registered  in 
ClinicalTrials.gov  (ID  number:  NCT06125093)  in  Octo-
ber 2023. The study began in March 2023, and the antici-
pated  finish  date  is  September  2024.  The  recruitment 
process was carried out from March 2023  to  November 
2023,  and  the  intervention  is  currently  being  delivered 
and  expected  to  finish  in  June  2024.  We  were  unable  to 
submit  this  manuscript  early  due  to  time  constraints: 
however, it was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov before the 
recruitment was completed.

Authors’ contributions
The work presented here was carried out in collaboration among all authors. 
The study was conceptualized by LV and designed by LV, ME, MLL, MS, and 
HV. The manuscript and figures were drafted by LV, MS, and HV. All authors 
performed a critical revision of the manuscript. All authors approved the 
final report. A coordinating team will oversee and supervise all steps of the 
project. The coordinating team will ensure effective project and consortium 
management to achieve the planned objectives within the assigned time 
frame and budget. Intellectual property disclosure will be defined in the 
Consortium Agreement. At least one meeting (live or virtual) per month with 
all partners and collaborators will be held to assess the progress of the project. 
The principal investigator will be the main person in charge of supervising 
the trial. An email distribution list has been created to provide support in case 
of any sudden or unexpected situation. Regarding recruitment, for each site, 
the patient manager from the territorial network on rare diseases (XUEC‑MCC: 
Xarxa d’Unitats d’expertesa clínica-malalties minoritàries cognitiu conductuals) 
will assume the responsibility of identifying potential candidates. After dis‑
cussing the option with the referring clinicians, they will offer the information 
to families (they are trained in consent procedures for studies involving chil‑
dren) and obtain the written informed consent, if the candidates are eligible 
and accept to participate. As required by the funding source, the principal 
investigator of the project will send a report every 12 months to Fundació La 
Marató de TV3. Each annual report will detail the degree of completion of the 
tasks, the activities and results of the year, amendments to the methodology 
and/or original work plan, relevance and possible clinical applicability of the 
final results, publications and communications derived from the research, and
