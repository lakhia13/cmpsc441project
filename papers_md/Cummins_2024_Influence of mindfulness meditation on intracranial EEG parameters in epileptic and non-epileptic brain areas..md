Abstract

Objective—Mind-wandering is a pervasive human brain state and, when in excess, may promote 
negative affect and neuropsychiatric conditions. Mindfulness meditation may promote alternate 
brain states, improving affect and reducing stress. An understanding of the neural basis between 
these brain states could thus advance treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions, including those 
associated with epilepsy.

Methods—To explore the neural basis of mindfulness meditation versus mind-wandering, we 
enrolled eight patients in a trial of structured mindfulness meditation and open mind-wandering 
who underwent stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) within the mesial temporal lobe for 
seizure localization. Electrophysiology was compared between mind-wandering and mindfulness 
separately for epileptic and non-epileptic MTL. Using fitting-one-over-f modeling, periodic 
components of electrophysiology were compared in canonical frequency bands of theta (4–8Hz), 
alpha (8–13Hz), beta (13–30Hz), and gamma (30–55Hz). Aperiodic components of the power 
spectra were assessed by the model offset, knee, and exponent.

Results—We found a significant reduction in gamma power (30–55Hz) within the mesial 
temporal lobe (MTL) during mindfulness meditation compared with mind-wandering in non-
epileptic (p=1.20E-4) but not in epileptic MTL (p=0.352).There was also a significant difference

between epileptic versus non-epileptic MTL in gamma power between conditions (p=0.011). 
There were no significant changes in power across any frequency band within epileptic mesial 
temporal MTL between brain states. Conversely, there were significant differences between mind-
wandering and mindfulness within epileptic MTL in aperiodic components (offset, knee, and 
exponent, all p<0.05), while no differences in aperiodic components were seen in non-epileptic 
MTL (all p>0.70).

Significance—Intracranial electrophysiologic modulations between brain state (mind-wandering 
versus mindfulness) may differ between epileptic and non-epileptic MTL. Modulations in gamma 
activity in non-epileptic MTL may represent functional changes in brain state, while aperiodic 
changes in epileptic MTL may modulate propensity for seizures.

Introduction

Mind-wandering, the spontaneous state of thoughts in absence of external stimuli, is a 
pervasive human state that occupies up to 50% of waking consciousness,1 and may at times 
drive negative emotions such as stress and depression.2–4 Mindfulness meditation represents 
a brain state in which thought is focused on a single stimuli, such as the breath. This form 
of meditation is associated with both reduced stress and reduced negative emotion.5–7 A 
body of literature has explored the neural correlates of both mindfulness meditation and 
mind-wandering, the bulk of which focusing on structural and functional imaging in each 
respective brain state.8,9

Most literature on mind-wandering and meditation comes from functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) and surface electroencephalography (EEG).10 Functional 
neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a predominant role of the default mode network 
in mind-wandering, but regions such as the hippocampus may also play a critical role, 
including by mediating imagined events of the past or future.11–13 Similarly, reductions 
in amygdala activity and functional connectivity have been documented with mindfulness 
meditation.14–16 EEG studies, which provide spatiotemporal resolution not provided 
with functional neuroimaging, have demonstrated state changes in the brain with mind-
wandering, including widespread changes in theta, alpha, and gamma activity.17–19 Evidence 
from fMRI studies has thus demonstrated that the hippocampus and amygdala play a 
critical role in human mind-wandering and mindfulness. Simultaneously, scalp EEG has 
implicated spectral changes between states of mind-wandering and mindfulness meditation 
but cannot assess mesial temporal structures, deep from the surface of the scalp. Similarly, 
fMRI lacks high spatiotemporal resolution. Understanding of the neural basis of meditation 
versus mind-wandering may help treat patients with neuropsychiatric conditions caused by 
long-term perturbations in such brain states. For instance, excessive mind-wandering has 
been associated with unhappiness,1 and certain patterns of mind-wandering may contribute 
to mood disorders such as depression.3,4 There remain few reports on a small number of 
patients on the intracranial effects of meditation on electrophysiology.20–22 Further, there is 
little work on how epileptic MTL tissue may be engaged in functional networks involved

in changes in brain state. These limited reports have suggested that focused attention (FA) 
meditation (a component of mindfulness mediation),23 may be associated with increased 
interictal activity,22 and physiological modulations in alpha and gamma power have been 
seen with both mindfulness and FA meditation.20,21 Some prior reports have suggested 
long-term meditation could increase the propensity for seizures,24 while other work has 
shown a potential reduction in seizures with meditation and related practices.25 Here we 
set out to describe spectral changes from intracranial EEG within the hippocampus and 
amygdala during mind-wandering versus mindfulness meditation, including the differences 
between epileptic and non-epileptic mesial temporal electrophysiology.

Methods

Patients

All subjects included were patients with drug resistant epilepsy implanted with intracranial 
electroencephalography (iEEG) leads for seizure monitoring. Only patients with amygdala 
and hippocampal leads were included. Contacts were defined as epileptogenic or non-
epileptogenic based on the sEEG review by a board-certified epileptologist. Intracranial 
electroencephalography data was recorded during guided mindfulness meditation and mind-
wandering. The meditation task consisted of focused awareness meditation, in which 
patients were instructed to follow their breath for 10 minutes. This was the first experience 
with meditation for all subjects. Immediately following the conclusion of meditation, mind 
wandering was instructed as, “Now let your mind wander for the next 2 minutes.” Subjective 
meditation depth was recorded by the previously described 30-item Meditation Depth 
Questionnaire (MEDEQ) immediately after each meditation session.26 Each item had four 
possible levels including “never” (scored 0), “sometimes” (scored 2), “often” (scored 3), and 
“very much” (scored 4).

iEEG data analysis

Each trial portion was timestamped to iEEG data using two timestamping methods to record 
the timing of each meditation session block accurately: a pushbutton-press and manual time 
notation: (1) Seizure Button Press: At the initiation of each meditation session, researchers 
executing the session were provided with a dedicated button to press. This button is used 
to note seizure start times using a clinical recording system, Natus Neuroworks (Natus 
Medical Inc., Pleasanton, CA), and was used to label task timing. The act of pressing the 
button served as an event marker for the beginning of each task; the timing of the button 
press was recorded with millisecond precision. (2) Manual Time Notation: In addition to the 
pushbutton press timestamping, the start and end times of each task block were manually 
recorded. The hour, minute, and second of the session’s start and end were noted down in 
patient task notes using a standardized clock reference.

Non-epileptic MTL was defined by non-lesional (normal) MRI on the respective 
hemisphere, and with no ictal or interictal activity identified on sEEG by the 
epileptologist. Epileptic MTL was defined by contacts that were in the seizure onset 
zone and/or had interictal epileptiform discharges. However, to assess functional changes 
in electrophysiology, periods of time with ictal or interictal activity during meditation or

mind-wandering tasks were excluded. Therefore, all data analyzed was free of ictal or 
interictal epileptic activity. All iEEG data was sampled at 1024Hz from the hippocampus 
and amygdala in monopolar configuration referenced to a white matter ground. All data was 
bipolar re-referenced, and bandpass filtered between 2Hz and 250Hz. A notch filter was 
applied at 60Hz to reduce line artifact. Data was visually inspected and those with notable 
line artifact were excluded from analysis. Power spectra were calculated using Welch’s 
method with parameters of 12.4% overlap and a one second Hanning window. The periodic 
components of each power spectra were calculated using the fitting one-over-f (FOOOF) 
methodology, previously described.27 FOOOF analysis was carried out separately from 2Hz 
– 55Hz (chosen to avoid artifact with the 60Hz notch filter and line noise). Consistent 
model parameters were chosen with peak widths 0.1Hz – 8.0Hz, maximum number of 
peaks of six, minimum peak height of 0.1dB, peak threshold of 2.0, and with an aperiodic 
‘knee’ model. Electrophysiology preprocessing and analyses were performed using custom 
MATLAB scripts.

Statistical analyses were carried out separately in the following frequency bands: theta 
(4–8Hz); alpha (8–13Hz); beta (13–30Hz); and gamma (30–55Hz). Peak power in each 
frequency band was then determined using only active contacts for each respective 
frequency band; inactive contacts in each frequency band were excluded for this analysis. 
We compared the peak power in each frequency band based on the average power across 
the entire trial interval. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for paired comparisons between 
conditions (mind-wandering versus mindfulness), given non-normally distributed data via 
the Shapiro test for normality. Changes in power in mind-wandering versus mindfulness 
between epileptic versus non-epileptic MTL were then compared using Kruskal-Wallis 
tests. Aperiodic components (model offset, knee, and exponent) were compared between 
mind-wandering and mindfulness using Mann-Whitney U tests for paired comparisons. 
All statistical analyses were performed in R software. Bayes factor analysis was also 
performed for each statistical comparison using the ‘BayesFactor’ package in R, using 
the generalTestBF function to determine each respective Bayes Factor. Generalized linear 
mixed-effects models were further applied to assess the effects of inter-individual variability 
on results. These analyses were carried out using glmer function within the ‘lme4’ package 
in R.

Anatomical localization of epileptic and non-epileptic contacts

Contacts within the hippocampus and amygdala were determined by reconstructing 3-Tesla 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans obtained preoperatively before iEEG placement 
with a computed tomography (CT) scan obtained postoperatively. The previously-described 
Yale-Brain Atlas was used to localize contacts within the hippocampus and amygdala, 
and position was confirmed by manual inspection.25 All contacts were non-lesional on 
MRI. Contacts with ictal activity determined by the clinical epileptologist were labeled 
as “epileptic,” and those that had no ictal or interictal activity over the period of sEEG 
were labeled as “non-epileptic.” Contacts were visualized in Montreal Neurological Institute 
space on a standardized T1 pre-contrast MRI using MRIcron software.28

Eight patients with 65 contacts were included: 45 in non-epileptic MTL and 20 in epileptic 
contacts MTL; 23 in the amygdala and 42 in the hippocampus. A demonstration of all 
amygdalohippocampal contacts in amygdala and hippocampal gray matter in Montreal 
Neurological Institute brain space is shown in Figure 1. Each statistical test was designed 
with two groups of comparison, giving one degree of freedom. We found a significant 
reduction in gamma power (30–55Hz) within the mesial temporal lobe during mindfulness 
meditation (peak power = 0.14±0.12dB) compared with mind-wandering in the non-epileptic 
contacts (0.23±0.12dB, p=1.20E-4, Figure 2). There were no significant differences in power 
between conditions across theta (4–8Hz), alpha (8–13Hz), or beta (13–30Hz) frequencies in 
non-epileptic contacts. There were no significant differences in power across any frequency 
band between mindfulness and mind-wandering in epileptic contacts (p>0.100 for all 
frequency bands). To directly compare the difference between epileptic and non-epileptic 
contacts on shifts in brain state, the difference in peak power was determined between mind-
wandering and mindfulness. Compared to epileptic contacts, non-epileptic contacts had 
significantly greater reduction in peak gamma power with mindfulness meditation compared 
to mind-wandering (mind-wandering - mindfulness meditation: Non-epileptic: 0.09±0.09dB; 
Epileptic: −0.02±0.17dB; p = 0.011, Figure 2). Bayes factor analysis was also applied to test 
the observed statistical findings. The significant reduction in gamma power (30–55Hz) seen 
during mindfulness meditation was matched with a Bayes factor (BF) of 53.2 ± 0.0. With a 
BF >30, this finding further indicates very strong evidence of an effect of mind-wandering 
versus mindfulness meditation on gamma power.29

Bayes factor results were inconclusive between conditions in non-epileptic contacts at all 
other frequency ranges (BF: theta = 0.396 ± 0.010; alpha = 0.352 ± 0.010; beta = 0.817 
± 0.010). Lower Bayes factors (i.e., <0.3) can be considered equivalent, and intermediate 
Bayes factors (i.e., 0.3–3.0) inconclusive.28 In epileptic contacts, Bayes factor analysis again 
revealed power in each frequency band had inconclusive evidence (BF: theta = 1.818 ± 
0.000; alpha = 1.526 ± 0.000; beta = 0.369 ± 0.0; gamma = 0.363 ± 0.000) between 
conditions.

In converse to findings in periodic oscillations, there were significant differences between 
mind-wandering and mindfulness within epileptic MTL in aperiodic components (model 
offset, knee, and exponent, all p<0.05), while there were no differences in aperiodic 
components in non-epileptic MTL (all p>0.70), Figure 3. These included a significantly 
higher aperiodic offset with meditation in epileptic contacts (90% of contacts greater in 
meditation, p=0.0034), knee (75% greater in meditation, p=0.010), and exponent (80.0% 
greater in meditation, p=0.022). The difference between mindfulness meditation and mind-
wandering was significantly greater in epileptic contacts compared with non-epileptic 
contacts for aperiodic offset (p<1.00E-5), knee (p<2.30E-4), and exponent (p=8.00E-5), 
Figure 3. Bayes factor analysis again generally reflected results of traditional statistical 
comparisons. There were significant differences in epileptic contacts in aperiodic offset 
(BF: 18.3 ± 0.0), and a weaker difference for aperiodic exponent (BF: 2.954 ± 0.010), 
while aperiodic knee was inconclusive between conditions (BF: 0.983 ± 0.010). In contrast, 
non-epileptic contacts indicated equivalence for aperiodic parameters between conditions, as

seen with traditional statistical comparisons (BF: offset = 0.222 ± 0.020; knee = 0.325 ± 
0.020; exponent = 0.221 ± 0.020).

While the effects of inter-individual variability and contact location could affect findings 
between conditions, we noted results were not driven by a subset of patients or clustered 
contact pairs. These included 87.0% (40/46) of non-epileptic bipolar contact pairs with 
higher gamma power during mind-wandering compared to mindfulness, with number of 
contact pairs relatively evenly distributed from each patient (n=11, n=11, n=10, n=8, n=5). 
Given the variability in capturing epileptic tissue with stereo EEG, epileptic contacts pairs 
in each patient were slightly more variable (n=8, n=6, n=4, n=2). However, aperiodic 
parameters were increased with mindfulness meditation across the majority of epileptic 
contact pairs for the entire cohort (90% of contacts with increased model offset, 75% 
for the model knee, and 80% for the model exponent). While there were more contacts 
in the hippocampus (n=42) compared to amygdala (n=23) available for analysis, no 
significant effects of contact location were seen on electrophysiologic findings (p>0.05 for 
all periodic and aperiodic parameters, by Kruskal-Wallis testing). Figure 4 demonstrates 
representative spectrograms at non-epileptic hippocampus contacts for one subject during 
mindfulness meditation (Figure 4A) and mind-wandering (Figure 4B). These spectograms 
further demonstrate the increased activity seen in gamma (30–55Hz) during mind-wandering 
compared to mindfulness. Linear mixed-models were further applied to assess the effects of 
inter-individual variability on the significant results seen. The mixed models demonstrated 
that accounting for random effects due to inter-subject differences, there was still a 
significant effect of condition between mindfulness and mind-wandering on gamma power 
(fixed effect of gamma power: 7.24; 95 % confidence interval: 2.73 – 11.74; residual degrees 
of freedom: 87). Similarly, within epileptic contacts, there was a significant effect between 
conditions for aperiodic offset and exponent. The fixed effect of aperiodic offset between 
conditions: −0.99; 95 % confidence interval: −1.75 – −0.23; residual degrees of freedom: 
37). The fixed effect of aperiodic exponent between conditions: −1.13; 95 % confidence 
interval: −2.18 – −0.08; residual degrees of freedom: 37). The fixed effect of aperiodic 
knee was not significant between conditions: −0.01; 95 % confidence interval: −0.02 – 
0.00; residual degrees of freedom: 37). Overall results between conditions appeared to be 
maintained, accounting for random variation between subjects.

Meditation depth by the Meditation Depth Questionnaire (MEDEQ)26 and was available for 
six of the study subjects.25 Meditation depth by the MEDEQ scale was 57.7; an average 
meditation depth of 45.0 across novice meditators has been reported in prior work.30 
Meditation depth varied across subjects, ranging 88, 82, 73, 57, 30, and 16. The sample 
of patients with meditation depth recorded was insufficient to detect an effect on oscillatory 
activity (gamma power fixed effect of meditation depth: 0.00; 95% confidence interval 
0.00–0.00). Meditation depth was significantly associated with aperiodic offset, knee, and 
exponent fixed effects. Aperiodic offset: −0.05; 95 % confidence interval: −0.08 – −0.03); 
aperiodic knee: −2090.9; 95 % confidence interval: −4106.7 – −75.2); aperiodic exponent: 
−0.03; 95 % confidence interval: −0.05 – −0.01).

Discussion

Page 7

We demonstrate the intracranial electrophysiology of human mind-wandering versus 
mindfulness meditation in the mesial temporal lobe in epileptic and non-epileptic MTL 
in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. Non-epileptic MTL had a decrease in gamma-band 
activity during first-time mindfulness meditation compared to mind-wandering. The same 
relationship was not seen in epileptic mesial temporal gray matter during periods free 
of ictal or interictal activity. In contrast, there were significant differences in aperiodic 
components only within epileptic MTL, and no differences in aperiodic parameters in 
“normal,” non-epileptic MTL tissue.

Limited work has explored the functional differences of epileptic versus non-epileptic mesial 
temporal MTL, but has focused primarily on high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, activity 
>80Hz). Hippocampal HFOs have been found to uniquely decrease in epileptic hippocampus 
during cognitive tasks compared to periods at rest (which may reflect mind-wandering).31 
In non-epileptic hippocampus, mixed evidence has found either a shift to higher frequency 
HFOs or no change during cognitive tasks.32 Contrary to our work, these results suggest that 
there may be functional changes in epileptic mesial temporal lobe during task-switching. 
However, low rates of functional connectivity have been found between epileptic and 
non-epileptic MTL,33 supporting that epileptic MTL may become functionally dissociated 
from non-epileptic networks. These findings may further motivate study into the crucial 
differences in how epileptic versus non-epileptic MTL reacts to shifts in brain state, and 
how these shifts could relate to both seizure-onset and cognitive performance. A report on 
three patients with sEEG during mindfulness meditation and mind-wandering by Bauer et 
al found the opposite finding of decreased gamma activity with mind-wandering compared 
to mindfulness in the temporal lobe, but was limited by including only three patients 
and lacking statistical signficance.20 This work also focused on high gamma frequencies 
(50–150Hz),20 unlike our work. We chose to focus on lower gamma frequency power (30–
55Hz) to avoid line noise at 60Hz and parallel ongoing work focused on the responsive 
neurostimulation device, which due to sampling rate of 250Hz limits analysis of higher 
frequency ranges.

Neuromodulation of mesial temporal brain, as provided by responsive neurostimulation 
(RNS), is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy,34 and in theory could 
modulate the contribution of once epileptic tissue to functional neural networks over 
time with stimulation. Related preliminary work on intracranial electrophysiology within 
the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with long-term RNS demonstrated functional 
differences between meditation and control.35 Interestingly, this work also demonstrated an 
increase in gamma with meditation compared to an active control condition.35 There are 
several reasons for this converse result, including the form of meditation studied. This work 
by Maher et al focused on loving-kindness meditation (LKM), which aims to focus attention 
on thoughts of well-being. In contrast to mindfulness meditation which focuses on stimuli in 
the present, LKM would likely lead to thoughts invoking memories and emotional salience, 
thus engaging the hippocampus and amygdala.16,36 Compared to control, LKM may thus 
lead to gamma increases in the hippocampus and amygdala,35 while mindfulness meditation

would lead to a decrease in gamma compared to mind-wandering, as found in the current 
study.

Our finding of decreased mesial temporal gamma-band activity during meditation runs 
counter to findings from surface EEG, which have generally found widespread increases 
in gamma activity with meditation.19,37,38 However, the spatiotemporal resolution afforded 
by intracranial EEG has been found to better characterize transitions in cognitive brain 
states.39 Our finding of decreased gamma activity with mindfulness specific to the mesial 
temporal lobe may relate to the heavy use of memory during mind-wandering, which 
would closely implicate the hippocampus.11–13 Further work is needed to determine the 
relationship between local intracranial electrophysiology of the mesial temporal lobe and 
other loci of SEEG contacts in competing or complimentary brain networks, potentially 
further clarifying surface EEG data in mind-wandering and mindfulness.

Aperiodic activity, modulated uniquely in epileptiform MTL between mindfulness 
meditation and mind-wandering in this study, may play a role in the mesial temporal 
epilepsy.40,41 Liu et al demonstrated a decrease in aperiodic exponent and increase in 
aperiodic offset during periods of seizure within epileptic tissue.41 Charlebois et al 
conversely found the aperiodic exponent may increase with epileptic activity.40 Limited 
work has explored the notion of changes in brain state influencing epileptic potential and 
induction of seizures, but one interesting case demonstrated an increase in ictal activity with 
mindfulness meditation compared to baseline.22 It is therefore possible that modulation of 
aperiodic activity in epileptic mesial temporal brain between brain states could influence the 
propensity for seizures. Further work is needed on the potential role of aperiodic parameters 
on epileptic activity, and the modulation of aperiodic activity and seizure potential between 
brain states.

While statistically significant findings are presented in electrophysiology between states 
of mind-wandering and mindfulness, the presented work was limited to a relatively small 
number of eight patients. Line noise limited analysis at higher gamma frequencies (>55Hz) 
which may be of interest and functionally relevant. Mind-wandering was directly compared 
to mindfulness meditation without a third control or other forms of meditation, which may 
have differential effects on electrophysiology. While we did not see any significant impact 
of anatomical location (amygdala versus hippocampus), this may have been limited by 
a relatively small number of contacts for comparison. We also did not include objective 
measures of mind-wandering versus mindfulness that could potentially be captured, such as 
eye tracking to detect distractedness. A subset of patients had meditation depth recorded, 
which was associated with aperiodic changes in electrophysiology. However, the sample 
was insufficient to correlate changes in oscillatory activity (i.e., gamma) with meditation 
depth. The amount of actual mind-wandering within each meditation session was not 
recorded. Future work will benefit from both objective measures of mind-wandering and 
finer subjective reporting of meditative experience in a rigorous, prospective manner. All 
work was done during the first trial of mindfulness meditation, and therefore the longitudinal

impact of meditation on brain function could not be assessed. Future work may explore 
these factors in a larger number of prospectively recruited patients.

Conclusion

Intracranial electrophysiology is differentially modulated in epileptic versus non-epileptic 
human mesial temporal MTL between brain states of mind-wandering and mindfulness 
meditation. Non-epileptic MTL was shown to have a decrease in gamma-band activity 
during first-time mindfulness meditation compared to mind-wandering. In contrast, there 
were significant modulations in the aperiodic offset, knee, and exponent in epileptic mesial 
temporal MTL between mindfulness and mind-wandering. Modulations in gamma activity 
in non-epileptic MTL may represent functional changes in brain state, while aperiodic 
changes in epileptic MTL may modulate propensity for seizures.

Representative spectrograms at one pair of non-epileptic hippocampus contacts for one 
subject during (A) mindfulness meditation and (B) mind-wandering. These spectograms 
further demonstrate the increased activity seen in gamma (30–55Hz) during mind-wandering 
compared to mindfulness. While minimal activity is seen at higher frequencies during 
mindfulness meditation (A), periodic increases in gamma activity are seen over the period of 
mind-wandering (B).
