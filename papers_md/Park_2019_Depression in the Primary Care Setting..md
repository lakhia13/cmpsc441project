Abstract

A 45-year-old woman with hypothyroidism that has been treated with a stable dose of 
levothyroxine presents to her primary care provider with depressed mood, negative feelings about 
herself, poor sleep, low appetite, poor concentration, and lack of energy. These symptoms began 
several months ago during a conflict with her partner. Although she has been able to continue with 
work and life responsibilities, she feels sadness most days and occasionally thinks that she would 
be better off dead. How would you evaluate and treat this patient?

THE CLINICAL PROBLEM

DEPRESSION IS A CLINICSLLY SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PUBLIC health issue. 
In 2015, depressive disorders were estimated to be the third leading cause of disability 
worldwide.1 In the United States, the estimated lifetime risk of a major depressive episode 
now approaches 30%.2 The incidence of suicide — which is associated with a diagnosis of 
depression more than 50% of the time3 — has been increasing and is the 10th leading cause 
of death in the United States.4

Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous condition with a variety of presentations and a 
broad constellation of associated symptoms. The criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition,5 for diagnosing and rating the severity of major 
depressive disorder are listed in Table 1. The pathophysiology of depression remains 
incompletely understood. Decreased functioning of monoaminergic neurotransmitters 
(serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, or all of these neurotransmitters) in the brain has 
traditionally been implicated, with presumed correction of these functional deficits in 
response to effective antidepressant therapies. As the understanding of depression evolves to 
implicate processes of neuroplasticity — that is, functional changes, structural changes, or

both in the brain in response to the environment and experience — such monoaminergic 
mechanisms are seen in the context of a host of molecular and cellular mechanisms that 
mediate human emotion.6

The onset of major depressive disorder is bimodal; most patients present in their twenties,7 
and a second peak occurs in the fifties.8 Women are twice as likely to have depression as 
men.9 Other risk factors for the development of major depressive disorder include being 
divorced or separated,10 previous episodes of depression, elevated levels of stress, a history 
of trauma, and a history of major depressive disorder in first-degree relatives.5 In patients 
with major depressive disorder, coexisting anxiety, psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, 
and borderline personality disorder are associated with a poorer prognosis, as well as a 
longer duration of episodes and greater symptom severity.5 In particular, the overlap 
between depression and anxiety has been well established; more than 50% of patients with 
depression report clinically significant anxiety and have greater refractoriness to standard 
treatments than patients who have depression without anxiety.11

Primary care providers are important in recognizing and managing depression. An estimated 
60% of mental health care delivery occurs in the primary care setting,12 and 79% of 
antidepressant prescriptions are written by providers who are not mental health care 
providers.13 One study showed that among persons who have attempted suicide, 38% visited 
a health care provider within the previous week, and 64% visited a health care provider 
within 4 weeks before the attempt; most of these patients visited a primary care practice.14 
Despite efforts to educate patients, communities, and medical professionals, stigma remains 
a primary barrier to recognizing and providing treatment for mental illness.15

STRATEGIES AND EVIDENCE

SCREENING

Universal screening for depression in all adult patients in the primary care setting, including 
pregnant and postpartum women, has been recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force.16 The Joint Commission recommends screening for suicidal ideation in patients 
in all medical settings.17 Brief screening instruments for depression such as the Patient 
Health Questionnaire 218,19 and the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions20 (Fig. 1) may be 
effectively and efficiently administered in the outpatient setting. Although some past studies 
suggested that screening for depression and suicide was not cost-effective, more recent 
studies have shown that cost-effectiveness ratios for outpatient and emergency-department 
screening were on par with preventive interventions for other medical conditions,21,22 
perhaps because of the use of more efficient screening tools and the increased incidence of 
these conditions.

ASSESSMENT

Potential causative or contributing medical diagnoses are a core consideration in the initial 
assessment of patients who present with any psychiatric symptoms. In the general hospital 
setting, up to one third of patients who present with depressive symptoms may have an 
underlying medical condition.23 For instance, manifestations of dementia and delirium,

including loss of social interactions, negative mood states, and cognitive dysfunction, may 
be similar to those of major depressive disorder. Multiple other medical conditions have 
been associated with depressive symptoms; these conditions include anemia, 
hypothyroidism, seizures, Parkinson’s disease, sleep apnea, deficiencies of vitamins such as 
B12 and folate, and infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, syphilis, and Lyme disease.24 In some cases, treatment of these underlying 
conditions may decrease or resolve depressive symptoms.

Because both prescribed and illicit substances can also result in depressive symptoms, the 
patient history should include assessment of the use of drugs such as beta-blockers, 
barbiturates, anabolic steroids and glucocorticoids, statins, hormones (e.g., oral 
contraceptives), levodopa and methyldopa, opioids, and some antibiotics (e.g., 
fluoroquinolones, mefloquine, and metronidazole).25 Illicit use of or withdrawal states 
associated with marijuana, sedatives or hypnotics, opiates, cocaine, or stimulants may also 
lead to depressive symptoms.

In addition to a comprehensive history and physical examination, laboratory testing should 
be considered in any initial evaluation of patients with depressive symptoms. Although 
empirical data supporting particular tests are generally scant, initial screening tests should 
include complete blood counts and differential blood counts, basic metabolic studies, 
thyroid-function tests, and levels of vitamin B and folate. Other laboratory tests such as 
liver-function tests, testosterone levels (in men), a Lyme titer, a rapid plasma reagin test, an 
HIV test, and urine and serum toxicologic screening should be considered as clinically 
appropriate.

In addition, a detailed psychiatric interview is important to accurately characterize 
psychiatric symptoms and assess the effect of symptoms on functioning. Establishing an 
effective therapeutic alliance with the patient requires sufficient time and attention to matters 
of a sensitive nature. Family, friends, partners, and other health care providers may be 
valuable sources of information; in nonemergency circumstances, patient permission is 
required to contact these persons. Consideration of cultural, social, and situational factors 
may help to identify relevant stressors, precipitants, or other situational variables that can 
affect functioning and guide decisions regarding treatment.

Other possible coexisting psychiatric diagnoses should also be considered. In particular, 
major depressive disorder should be distinguished from bipolar depression. Bipolar disorder, 
which is defined by current or past manic or hypomanic episodes, often presents as a 
depressive episode.26 Because the clinical presentation of bipolar depression may be 
clinically indistinguishable from that of major depressive disorder, the diagnosis hinges on 
an assessment of past hypomanic or manic episodes (Table 1). This distinction also has 
therapeutic significance, since the use of antidepressants in bipolar depression without 
concurrent treatment with a mood stabilizer is associated with an increased risk of manic 
symptoms (i.e., “switching,” or depression turning into hypomania or mania).

TREATMENT

Page 4

General agreement exists regarding the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate major 
depressive disorder in adults.27 For mild depression, initial preference should be given to 
psychotherapy and symptom monitoring, with pharmacotherapy re-served for cases of 
insufficient improvement. Psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both should be considered 
for moderate depression.28 Con-sultation with a psychiatrist should be obtained for a patient 
with severe depression and urgently in any patient with psychotic symptoms or suicidal 
thoughts and behavior.

Psychotherapy—Psychotherapeutic interventions are first-line treatments for mild-to-
moderate depression.29 A metaanalysis of various psychotherapies, including 53 
comparative trials (involving 2757 patients with mild-to-moderate depression) showed that 
across all forms of psychotherapy, the response rate was 48% (vs. 19% in the control 
groups).29 No significant differences were noted among various types of psychotherapy, 
including — but not limited to — cognitive behavioral therapy (identifying and modifying 
negative thoughts that adversely affect emotion and behavior), behavioral activation 
(scheduling positive activities and increasing positive interactions), and interpersonal 
psychotherapy (addressing interpersonal issues in a highly structured manner). Another 
meta-analysis showed significantly higher remission rates among patients who received 
psychotherapy (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy [66%], psychodynamic therapy [54%], 
supportive counseling [49%], and behavioral activation [74%]) than among those in control 
conditions (43%).30 In order to gain a better sense of the clinical effect, a meta-analysis 
comparing cognitive behavioral therapy with various control conditions showed a moderate 
effect size and a number needed to treat of 2.6 to see improvement.31 Taken together, the 
data provide support for cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and behavioral 
activation as first-line treatments for mild-to-moderate depression.32 Data have shown some 
effectiveness of tele-phone-based33 and Internet-based34 psychotherapeutic interventions, 
and these interventions may be considered, particularly if in-person therapy is not accessible.

The type of psychotherapy should be appropriate for the patient’s situation. For instance, 
interpersonal psychotherapy may help when interpersonal issues are prominent, behavioral 
activation may increase motivation and initiative, and cognitive behavioral therapy may help 
to modify distorted thoughts that contribute to depression. If substantive improvement is not 
seen after 6 weeks of a psychotherapeutic intervention, a change in the type of 
psychotherapy, initiation of pharmacotherapy, or psychiatric consultation should be 
considered.

Pharmacotherapy—Antidepressant medications have been a mainstay of treatment for 
depression, although the favorability of the benefit-risk analysis for milder forms of 
depression has been questioned.35 A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials 
of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antidepressants showed that effect sizes 
varied according to the severity of baseline depression; effect sizes were small in cases of 
mild depression but greater in moderate-to-severe depression.36

Although well-controlled randomized trials are the standard for assessing efficacy, it can be 
challenging to translate these findings into clinical effectiveness; notably, many of these 
trials are associated with high placebo response rates. Information on “real-world” 
effectiveness was provided by the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression 
(STAR*D) trial, which used a four-level algorithm (reflecting clinical practice at the time) to 
guide the selection of antidepressant therapies. Citalopram was prescribed as the first (level 
1) treatment. If that treatment was unsuccessful, patients underwent randomization to receive 
alternative therapies within a group of substrategies that the patients had deemed to be 
acceptable. Level 2 choices included continuation of citalopram, a change to another 
commonly used medication (sertraline, venlafaxine, or bupropion), or the addition of another 
medication or cognitive behavioral therapy. Subsequent levels involved switching to or 
adding less frequently used medications. Treatment with citalopram yielded a response rate 
of 47% and a remission rate of 37%; the cumulative remission rate of all four levels was 
67%.37 The STAR*D trial also showed that none of the antidepressants that were examined 
were superior to any other and that, after a failed antidepressant trial, switching or 
augmentation strategies (including with cognitive behavioral therapy) resulted in similar 
response rates.38

Although the STAR*D trial was limited by the lack of strict randomization and blinding, 
other analyses have similarly shown no significant differences in efficacy among 
antidepressant drugs.39 For example, an international, randomized, multicenter trial 
comparing escitalopram, sertraline, and extended-release venlafaxine showed no significant 
differences in rates of response at 8 weeks (61%, 66%, and 60%, respectively) or remission 
(48%, 46%, and 42%, respectively) among the treatments.40 A recent meta-analysis of 522 
mostly short-term trials involving patients with moderate-to-severe depression showed that 
all the assessed antidepressants were more effective than placebo (although with modest 
effect sizes)41; the same meta-analysis also showed that in head-to-head trials, certain 
antidepressants (including amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, 
and vortioxetine) were more effective than others.

For moderate-to-severe depression, first-line medications generally include selective 
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepi-nephrine-reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs), bupropion, and mirtazapine (Table 2).42 Three drugs more recently approved by 
the FDA for depression — vilazodone, vortioxetine, and levomilnacipran — are also 
treatment options, but current guidelines (with the exception of the Canadian Network for 
Mood and Anxiety Treatments [CANMAT] guidelines42) precede these agents. Among the 
newer agents, the CANMAT guidelines include vortioxetine and milnacipran (a racemic 
mixture of levomilnacipran and its dextrorotatory enan-tiomer) as first-line options and 
vilazodone as a second-line option. Older classes of antidepressants such as tricyclic 
antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors have a greater risk profile than newer 
agents, so they are typically used only if other agents are ineffective.

The selection of an antidepressant is guided by adverse-effect profiles as well as by the 
patient’s coexisting psychiatric disorders, specific symptoms, and treatment history.43 A 
goal should be to minimize adverse effects, particularly those that might exacerbate existing 
symptoms or other medical conditions. For instance, drugs commonly associated with

increased sedation (e.g., mirtazapine and paroxetine) are not administered during the day in 
patients with daytime fatigue; conversely, for patients with difficulty sleeping, these sedating 
drugs may be prescribed at bedtime to promote sleep. Patients with coexisting anxiety are 
often treated with SSRIs or SNRIs, whereas bupropion and levomil-nacipran are generally 
not used (Table 2). Treatment selection should also include consideration of the patient’s 
personal and family history of medication response and side effects, his or her drug 
preference, and cost and accessibility (i.e., insurance coverage).44

Medication trials generally begin at a low dosage, with dose adjustments typically occurring 
every 2 weeks. Although improvement may be noted at as early as 2 weeks, full relief of 
symptoms may not be seen for 8 to 12 weeks (at an adequate dosage). If the initial trial does 
not yield substantive improvement, switching to another first-line antidepressant (of the 
same or a different class) is appropriate. Psychotherapy should also be considered, since the 
combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy has been shown to be more effective than 
drug therapy alone.45 If partial improvement is noted at the maximally tolerated dose, 
adding an antidepressant of a different class or targeting residual symptoms with other 
treatments may be an appropriate next step. Psychiatric consultation is recommended if 
combined therapy or use of a treatment option other than first-line therapy is being 
considered. Once remission is achieved, maintenance antidepressant treatment to decrease 
the risk of relapse should generally be continued for at least 6 months.46 For persons with a 
high risk of relapse (e.g., two or more past episodes, residual symptoms, or a history of 
prolonged or severe symptoms), maintenance treatment should be considered for 2 years or 
more.47 Recurrence of symptoms is common after an index episode; longitudinal studies 
have shown recurrence rates of 26% within 1 year and 76% within 10 years.48

In general, first-line antidepressants have a manageable side-effect profile (Table 2). One 
potentially severe adverse effect associated with SSRIs and SNRIs is the serotonin 
syndrome, which is characterized by agitation, confusion, fever, and tremors that may 
proceed in severe cases to seizures, coma, and death. Although this syndrome is very rare, 
the risk may be higher when other drugs that elevate serotonergic tone (e.g., monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, triptans, ondansetron, and 
metoclopramide) are used in combination with SSRIs and SNRIs.

In 2004, the FDA issued a black-box warning that all SSRIs and venlafaxine were associated 
with an increased risk of suicidality among persons younger than 24 years of age 
(www.fda.gov/ downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrug Class/UCM173233.pdf). 
However, other independent reviews have not confirmed this associa-tion.42 Assuming that 
appropriate monitoring practices — including those for suicidality — are in place, the risks 
of untreated depression among adults of any age outweigh the risks of drug treatment.44

AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY

Investigators have begun to identify subtypes of depression on the basis of clinical features49 
or findings on functional magnetic resonance im-aging,50 as well as on the basis of genetic 
risk factors51 and other potential predictors of treatment response52; however, more studies 
are needed before specific biomarkers or predictors of response may be used to provide

clinically valuable information. Pharmacogenomic testing has been suggested to guide 
dosing and minimize potential dose-related side effects, but evidence that this information 
aids in predicting treatment response or improves cost-effectiveness is lacking.53

GUIDELINES

Three treatment guidelines for depression — by the American Psychiatric Association,44 the 
CANMAT,54 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (United Kingdom)55 
— offer similar guidance, although only the CANMAT guidelines address recent 
antidepressant medications. The recommendations in this article are generally concordant 
with these guidelines.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The patient in the vignette meets the criteria for a major depressive episode. Although her 
depressive symptoms are not completely debilitating, she has substantial distress that is 
affecting her functioning; this suggests an episode of moderate severity. We would review 
her medical history and medications and ask about substance use to rule out potential causes 
of or contributors to her depressive symptoms. A careful history is also needed to assess 
evidence of mania or hypomania, since treatment for bipolar depression would differ from 
that for major depressive disorder. She should be immediately evaluated for possible 
suicidality to establish that she has no active plans to harm herself and to ensure that she 
agrees to seek emergency treatment if such feelings develop.

Pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both are all reasonable treatment options for moderate 
depression. In this patient, given that symptoms have been present for several months, we 
would recommend a combination of first-line pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. We 
would initiate sertraline, which is cost-effective and generally has an acceptable side-effect 
profile, starting at 50 mg daily and increasing by 50 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum dose 
of 200 mg, while monitoring for effectiveness and adverse effects. We would discuss 
effective psychotherapeutic approaches but would favor interpersonal therapy so that the 
patient could begin to address the relationship conflicts with her partner. If her symptoms 
completely remit, we would recommend that she continue the use of medication for at least 
6 months before considering discontinuation.

DEPRESSION IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING

Key Clinical Points

•

•

•

•

•

Screening for depression and suicidal thinking and behavior is important in 
the primary care setting.

Distinguishing between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder is 
critical for treatment selection.

The first-line treatment for mild depression is psychotherapy and symptom 
monitoring.

Antidepressant drugs have been shown to have a favorable benefit-risk profile 
in moderate-to-severe depression. Psychotherapy may also be a first-line 
choice for moderate depression.

The choice of treatment depends on associated side effects, the presence of 
coexisting conditions, specific symptoms, and the patient’s history of 
response.

Figure 1. Depression and Suicide Screening Tools.
On the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (Panel A), a score of 3 or higher is 83% sensitive and 
90% specific for a diagnosis of major depression. On the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions 
(Panel B), if the patient answers “no” to all four questions 1 through 4, the screening is 
complete and it is not necessary to ask question 5. No intervention is necessary (clinical 
judgment can always override a negative screening test). If the patient answers “yes” to any 
of questions 1 through 4 or declines to answer, the screening test is considered to be positive, 
and question 5 should be asked to assess severity. If the patient answers “yes” to question 5, 
the test is considered to be positive with an imminent risk identified. The patient requires 
immediate safety and a full mental health evaluation and cannot leave until he or she is 
evaluated for safety. Keep the patient in sight, remove all dangerous objects from the room, 
and alert the physician or clinician who is responsible for the patient’s care. If the patient 
answers “no,” the screening test is considered to be a positive test with a potential risk 
identified. He or she requires a brief suicide safety assessment to determine whether a full 
mental health evaluation is needed and cannot leave until he or she is evaluated for safety. 
Alert the physician or clinician who is responsible for the patient’s care. Data are adapted 
from www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/asq-toolkit-materials/index.shtml#outpatient.

DSM-5 Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.*

Table 1.

Criteria

Five or more of the following symptoms during the same 2-wk period, with the symptoms representing a change from previous functioning and 
with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in activities of daily life (symptoms that are clearly 
attributable to another medical condition are not included).

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g.,feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation 
made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (In children and adolescents, a depressed mood can be an irritable mood.)

2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective 
account or observation).

3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of >5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite 
nearly every day. (In children, failure to gain expected weight should be considered.)

4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.

5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed 
down).

6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt 
about being sick).

8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).

9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan 
for committing suicide.

Severity of depression

Mild depression: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is 
distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.

Moderate depression: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, functional impairment, or all of these variables are between those 
specified for “mild” and “severe.”

Severe depression: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is 
seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.

A comprehensive assessment of depression should not rely simply on a symptom count but should take into account the degree of functional 
impairment, disability, or both.

*

In contrast to major depressive disorder, the diagnosis of bipolar depression is based on the occurrence of a past or present hypomanic episode 

(symptoms present ≥4 days) or manic episode (≥1 week). A hypomanic episode involves elevated, expansive, or irritable mood; grandiosity; 
decreased need for sleep; pressured or increased speech; flight of ideas or racing thoughts; distractibility; increased goal-directed activity; 
psychomotor agitation; or excessive involvement in activities with high potential for painful consequences. The criteria for major depressive 
disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association.5 DSM-5 denotes Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition.
