Abstract

Background and aim: People who inject drugs are at high risk of contracting hepatitis C

(HCV). The introduction of direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs to treat HCV has the

potential to transform care; however, uptake of DAAs has been slower than anticipated.

The strong link between HCV and injecting drug use frames HCV as a shameful, stigma-
tising disease, reinforcing an ‘addict’ identity. Linking HCV care to a recovery journey,
‘clean’ identity and social redemption may provide compelling encouragement for peo-

ple to engage with treatment and re-evaluate risk and behaviours, reducing the incidence

of HCV re-infection. The aim of this review was to identify actions, interventions and

treatments that provide an opportunity for a change in identity and support a recovery

journey and the implications for HCV care.

Methods: Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ProQuest Public Health, ProQuest

Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL and Web of Science) were searched following our published

strategy and a grey literature search conducted. A narrative synthesis was undertaken

to collate themes and identify common threads and provide an explanation of the findings.

Results: Thirty-two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The narrative synthesis of the

studies identified five over-arching analytical themes: social factors in substance use and

recovery, therapeutic communities, community treatment, online communities, and
finally women and youth subsets. The change from an ‘addict’ identity to a ‘recovery’

identity is described as a key aspect of a recovery journey, and this process can be

supported through social support and turning point opportunities.

Conclusions: Recovery from addiction is a socially mediated process. Actions, interven-

tions and treatments that support a recovery journey provide social connections, a

recovery identity and citizenship (reclaiming a place in society). There is a gap in current

literature describing how pathways of care with direct acting antivirals can be designed

to promote recovery, as part of hepatitis C care.

Sustained recovery challenges

many, some individuals either do not adopt a recovery identity or

leave the identity behind them over time. The move away from a

recovery identity was associated with a low intensity of substance

use, through on-going use of one or more substances or by putting

substance use behind them. The strongest predictor of an individual

adopting a recovery identity was participation in treatment services,

recovery groups or mutual aid groups attended. Adopting a recovery

identity may act as a means of self-preservation away from the stig-

matised addict identity and also one of enhancement of self-worth by
highlighting the ongoing importance of recovery in one’s life [53].
Kelly et al. [53] found that 25% of those who once considered them-

selves in recovery drop this self-label, suggesting that some move

beyond this identity over time. The concept of recovery is still subject

Women and identity transition

Three papers specifically focussed on identity change for women
[72–74]. The discovery of a recovery identity for women is shaped by
other identities that women hold [72–74]. The entwined nature of

family relationships and a mother identity is described as critical
through affirmation or discrediting of a recovery identity [72–74]. It is

suggested that identity transformations must be accompanied by
turning points in one’s life [73]. Activities thought of as normal acts of

citizenship including work, study and caring for children are identified

alisation negatively influences opportunity to change [74].

These findings reaffirm the complex web of identities that individ-

uals hold and how they may impact on a recovery identity. There is a

requirement to consider a gender-sensitive approach for any interven-

tion that aims to provide the opportunity for identity transformation,

as the complexity of family relationships has a large impact on women

who are mothers.

processes. This may have relevance for HCV care where treatment

may provide the opportunity to move away from an unwanted

tainted identity as a result of a stigmatised disease and act as a turn-

ing point toward a recovery identity. Social network changes toward

membership of groups that are more supportive of recovery are mir-
rored and re-enforced by identity shifts from an ‘addict’ identity
toward a ‘recovery’ identity. These changes may be accompanied by

an improved quality of life and re-integration into more mainstream

communities.

Our systematic review did not identify any current studies that

provided evidence that cure of HCV with DAAs is a catalyst for

change in identity. However, it does appear that the opportunity for a

shift in identity may be supportive of a recovery journey. Providing
the opportunity for a new ‘clean’ identity away from a stigmatised

HCV identity may provide additional support and encouragement of a

recovery identity. Our review has identified a gap in current literature

describing how DAAs may provide the opportunity for care wider

than a pharmacological

intervention with a holistic focus on the

desires of patients for a new untainted identity and reason to engage

with HCV care. Developing this narrative may unlock DAAs potential

to realise the WHO elimination target, supporting a recovery journey

and thereby reducing re-infection rates. Recovery is a socially negoti-

ated process and therefore, services providing HCV treatment should

pay particular focus in linking patients into social support to enhance

service provision. HCV care providers require links wider than medical

OST services, they should establish links to recovery communities to

provide the holistic care patients desire and need.
