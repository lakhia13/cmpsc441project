Autism spectrum disorders include social, communication, and behavioral challenges. These problems can be mild, severe, or somewhere in between. A diagnosis is based on the level of support needed - so getting an early diagnosis means treatment can begin sooner.


## What Conditions Are Considered Spectrum Disorders?


Until recently, experts talked about different types of autism, such as autistic disorder, Aspergerâs syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). But now they are all called âautism spectrum disorders.â

If you still hear people use some of the older terms, youâll want to know what they mean:

Asperger's syndrome.This is on the milder end of theautismspectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

Pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).This mouthful of a diagnosis included most children whose autism was more severe than Asperger's syndrome, but not as severe as autistic disorder.

Autistic disorder.This older term is further along the autism spectrum than Aspergerâs and PDD-NOS. It includes the same types of symptoms, but at a more intense level.

Childhood disintegrative disorder.This was the rarest and most severe part of the spectrum. It described children who develop normally and then quickly lose many social, language, and mental skills, usually between ages 2 and 4. Often, these children also developed aseizuredisorder.


## Is Rett Syndrome an ASD?


Children withRett syndromeoften have behaviors similar to autism, and experts used to group it among spectrum disorders. But now that itâs known to be caused by a genetic mutation, itâs no longer considered an ASD.
