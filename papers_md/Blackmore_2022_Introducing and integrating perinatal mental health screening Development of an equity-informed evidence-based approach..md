Abstract
Background: Pregnancy is a time of increased risk for developing or re‐experiencing

mental illness. Perinatal mental health screening for all women is recommended in many
national guidelines, but a number of systems‐level and individual barriers often hinder

policy implementation. These barriers result in missed opportunities for detection and

early intervention and are likely to be experienced disproportionately by women from

culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds,
including women of refugee back-
grounds. The objectives of this study were to develop a theory‐informed, evidence‐

based guide for introducing and integrating perinatal mental health screening across

health settings and to synthesize the learnings from an implementation initiative and

multisectoral partnership between the Centre of Perinatal Excellence (COPE), and a
university‐based research centre. COPE is a nongovernmental organization (NGO)

commissioned to update the Australian perinatal mental health guidelines, train health

professionals and implement digital screening.

Methods:

In this case study, barriers to implementation were prospectively

identified and strategies to overcome them were developed. A pilot perinatal

screening programme for depression and anxiety with a strong health equity focus

was implemented and evaluated at a large public maternity service delivering care to

a culturally diverse population of women in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia,

including women of refugee background. Strategies that were identified preimple-

mentation and postevaluation were mapped to theoretical

frameworks. An

implementation guide was developed to support future policy, planning and
decision‐making by healthcare organizations.

Results: Using a behavioural
change framework (Capability, Opportunity,
Motivation–Behaviour Model), the key barriers, processes and outcomes are
described for a real‐world example designed to maximize accessibility, feasibility

and acceptability. A Programme Logic Model was developed to demonstrate the

relationships of the inputs, which included stakeholder consultation, resource

development and a digital screening platform, with the outcomes of the programme.
A seven‐stage implementation guide is presented for use in a range of healthcare

settings.
Conclusions: These findings describe an equity‐informed, evidence‐based approach

that can be used by healthcare organizations to address common systems and
individual‐level barriers to implement perinatal depression and anxiety screening

guidelines.

Patient or Public Contribution: These results present strategies that were informed by

prior research involving patients and staff from a large public antenatal clinic in

Melbourne, Australia. This involved interviews with health professionals from the clinic

such as midwives, obstetricians, perinatal mental health and refugee health experts and

interpreters. Interviews were also conducted with women of refugee background who

were attending the clinic for antenatal care. A steering committee was formed to facilitate

the implementation of the perinatal mental health screening programme comprising staff
from key hospital departments, GP liaison, refugee health and well‐being, the NGO COPE

and academic experts in psychology, midwifery, obstetrics and public health. This

committee met fortnightly for 2 years to devise strategies to address the barriers,

implement and evaluate the programme. A community advisory group was also formed

that involved women from eight different countries, some of refugee background, who

had recently given birth at the health service. This committee met bimonthly and was

instrumental

in planning the implementation and evaluation such as recruitment

strategies, resources and facilitating an understanding of the cultural complexity of the

women participating in the study.

health as there is an increased chance of women experiencing or re‐

of perinatal mental illness, including costs to healthcare, well‐being,

productivity and intergenerational

$5.2 billion in Australia8 and £8.1 billion pounds per year in the
United Kingdom.9

During the perinatal period, defined as conception to 12 months

following birth, depression and anxiety are the most commonly
illnesses.10,11 For women living in high‐income

experienced mental

countries, perinatal depression and anxiety are reported to affect up to
15.0%.11,12 For women living in low‐ and middle‐income countries, the

prevalence of perinatal depression is more than double this rate, with a
pooled prevalence of 31% for any depressive illness.13 In particular,

Participation in perinatal depression screening programmes has been

shown to improve identification of women at risk, referral uptake and

engagement with services, which in turn has a positive impact on
mental health outcomes.16 The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale

(EPDS) has been validated to detect symptoms of both perinatal

depression and anxiety and is the recommended screening measure
in the Australian clinical guidelines.5 Routine, standardized screening
illness is recommended in high‐income
in pregnancy for mental
countries including the United Kingdom,17 the United States of
America18 and Australia.5 However, this is a common evidence‐

practice gap, with screening poorly implemented due to a lack of
knowledge and support for women and health professionals.19

To ensure that screening is successful and improves healthcare, the
