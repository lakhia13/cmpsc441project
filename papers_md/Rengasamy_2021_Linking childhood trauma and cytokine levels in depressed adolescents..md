Abstract

Background: Evidence supports raised circulating levels of inflammatory mediators, such 
as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), among clinically depressed adults, 
although preliminary findings in adolescents are mixed. Independently, meta-analyses identify 
correlations between childhood trauma and elevated cytokine levels in adulthood. Here, we 
examine the possible role of individual differences in exposure to childhood trauma in contributing 
to variability in cytokine levels in depressed adolescents.

Methods: 52 depressed adolescents and 20 healthy adolescents completed measures of childhood 
trauma and provided blood for the assessment of plasma IL-6 and TNFα. Cross-sectional 
associations of childhood trauma and cytokine measures were assessed in both depressed and 
healthy adolescents, along with exploratory analysis of childhood trauma subtypes. Longitudinal 
relationships between childhood trauma and cytokine measures were also studied in an exploratory 
fashion within a subset of depressed participants (n=36).

Results: Higher childhood trauma (particularly emotional abuse) was positively associated with 
TNFα in depressed adolescents. Childhood trauma was not linked to longitudinal changes in 
cytokine levels.

Discussion: In depressed adolescents, childhood trauma may relate to higher levels of the 
proinflammatory cytokine TNFα and contribute to heterogeneity in cytokine elevation among 
depressed adolescents. Such findings may ultimately help guide more effective individualized 
treatments for adolescents with depression.

Introduction

Page 2

Adolescent depression is a major health concern in adolescent populations, and at an 11% 
prevalence, affects a significant number of adolescents in the United States(Avenevoli et al., 
2015). Furthermore, adolescent depression predicts adolescent suicide, future psychological 
impairment, and future social impairment(Jaycox et al., 2009). Therefore, it is critical to 
better understand pathophysiological mechanisms of depression among individuals in this 
age range to help guide treatment options. In accordance with the monoamine hypothesis 
of depression (wherein low synaptic serotonergic activity is thought to contribute to the 
pathophysiology of depression), serotonergic medications are an effective treatment for 
a large proportion of adolescents with depression(Hirschfeld, 2000; March et al., 2004). 
However, up to 30% of adolescent patients do not respond to this treatment, even in 
combination with psychotherapy(March et al., 2004). Thus, researchers have started to 
examine other potential biological pathways that might explain individual-level differences 
in depressive symptomology and treatment outcomes.

One such biological pathway that could contribute to depressive symptoms is inflammation. 
Several meta-analyses in adults have provided robust evidence that depression is associated 
with low-grade elevations of inflammatory cytokines(Dowlati et al., 2010; Köhler et 
al., 2017). Cytokines are small glycoproteins that coordinate immune system response 
such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). As described in 
individual studies, meta-analyses, or reviews, psychological and pharmacological treatments 
for depression are associated with reductions in cytokine levels (e.g. TNFα, IL-6)(Liu et 
al., 2019; Lopresti, 2017) and anti-inflammatory treatments (e.g. infliximab) are associated 
with improvements in symptoms of depression, particularly among subgroups of depressed 
patients with elevated inflammatory markers(Köhler- Forsberg et al., 2019; Raison et 
al., 2013; Wittenberg et al., 2019). For adolescents, some preliminary clinical studies 
similarly suggest that IL-6 and TNFα are elevated in depressed adolescents as compared 
to healthy adolescents(Peters et al., 2019) or predict future depressive symptoms(Moriarity 
et al., 2019). However, the literature remains mixed as to whether cytokine levels differ 
between depressed and healthy adolescents(D'Acunto et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020a). These 
findings and other converging evidence suggest there are subtypes of depression of differing 
pathophysiology, with subsets of individuals with depression showing varying degree of 
elevations in inflammatory markers(Lynch et al., 2020; Moriarity et al., 2021). Accordingly, 
recent research has begun to focus on parsing clinical factors in subgroups of depressed 
patients that may contribute to depressive symptoms or be associated with elevations in 
cytokines.

Childhood trauma has emerged as one potential clinical factor that might contribute to 
variability to cytokine elevation in depressed adolescent populations, based on studies 
in adults (Gill et al., 2020; Grosse et al., 2016). Importantly, individuals with childhood 
trauma are at higher risk for depression in adulthood(Mandelli et al., 2015), and childhood 
trauma is a strong predictor of non-response to treatment for depression (Nanni et al., 
2012), with these effects thought to potentially be driven by through epigenetic, molecular 
(e.g., inflammatory dysregulation, HPA axis), or neurobiological mechanisms(Jaworska­
Andryszewska and Rybakowski, 2019). In particular, childhood trauma has been associated

with cytokine elevation in adults(Baumeister et al., 2016; Nguyen and Thurston, 2020). 
Conceptually, predisposing factors (e.g., significant stressors such as childhood trauma) are 
thought to sensitize the immune system(Agorastos et al., 2019; Fleshner, 2013), making 
it vulnerable to future dysregulation and increased systemic inflammation (particularly in 
the context of stress). Thus, childhood trauma could be a risk factor for elevated cytokine 
activity that impacts a subgroup of depressed individuals, and preliminary studies suggest 
that specifically IL-6 and TNFα may be elevated in individuals with both adverse childhood 
experiences and depression(Gill et al., 2020). However, few studies have probed correlations 
between childhood trauma and cytokine levels in depressed adolescents(Peters et al., 2019). 
Such examination of trauma-cytokine relationships in depressed adolescent populations 
could inform individual-level differences in cytokine elevation among heterogeneous 
depressed adolescent populations. Independent study of such processes in adolescence, as 
opposed to adulthood, is needed given that low grade cytokine elevation in adolescence 
may be particularly maladaptive in the context of ongoing development of both the 
immune system and neural circuitry(Blakemore, 2012; Brenhouse and Schwarz, 2016). 
Studies have also not assessed if trauma-cytokine associations differ between depressed and 
healthy adolescent populations or examined trauma-cytokine relationships longitudinally. In 
one conceptual model of understanding immune system and trauma interactions, immune 
system sensitization secondary to childhood trauma is thought to contribute to robust 
and persistent cytokine elevations longitudinally, given that elevated cytokine elevation 
in the context of both depression and significant childhood trauma may contribute to a 
“vicious cycle” involving bidirectional causal effects between cytokines and depressive 
symptomology(Beurel et al., 2020; Moriarity et al., 2020). Such effects may contribute to 
treatment non-response, given that reduction in certain cytokine levels (e.g., TNFα) has been 
associated with response to treatments for depression(Liu et al., 2019).

To address these gaps in the existing literature, we sought to examine baseline and 
longitudinal associations of childhood trauma with TNFα and IL-6 in a cohort of depressed 
adolescents (n=52, including a subset of 36 adolescents for whom we have previously 
examined relationships between cytokine levels and anhedonia/depression(Rengasamy et al., 
2021)), and also assessed the strength of trauma-cytokine associations in healthy adolescents 
(n=20). We hypothesized that (1) greater childhood trauma exposure would be associated 
with elevated baseline TNFα and IL-6, (2) trauma-cytokine associations would be present 
in depressed participants, (3) trauma-cytokine association would not be present in healthy 
controls. In exploratory analyses, we also hypothesized that all childhood trauma subtypes 
would be equally associated with cytokine elevation and greater exposure to childhood 
trauma would be associated with longitudinal increases in cytokine levels over time. We also 
examined several potential moderators (e.g., depression severity) of associations of trauma 
with cytokines in sensitivity analyses.

2.  Materials and Methods

2.1  Participants

Our study included both depressed and healthy participants. Depressed participants included 
fifty-two adolescents ages 12-18 with a DSM-V unipolar depressive disorder (e.g., Major

Depressive Disorder) and who were engaged in psychotherapy treatment in the community. 
Healthy participants included 20 adolescents without any history of DSM-V diagnosis or 
family history of DSM-V depressive disorder diagnosis. Healthy participants had similar 
distributions of age and biological sex as depressed adolescents (see Table 1). A prior 
manuscript describes analyses examining anhedonia/depression relationships with IL-6 and 
TNFα from a subset of the depressed adolescents (n=36)(Rengasamy et al., 2021). While 
all participants completed a baseline visit, only a subset of depressed participants (n=36) 
completed a follow-up visit approximately four months (range 3 – 7.5 months) after 
the baseline visit. Supplemental Table 1 describes sociodemographic characteristics and 
clinical differences between participants completing and not completing the follow-up, 
with no significant differences found between these groups. Recruitment of both healthy 
and depressed participants was done through posted flyers and a local research registry, 
while depressed participants were additionally recruited from outpatient clinical referrals. 
For those participants who were less than 18 years old, participants provided informed 
assent and participants’ parents provided informed consent. For participants who were 18 
years or older, participants provided informed consent. If concerns of current or prior 
childhood trauma (e.g., physical abuse or sexual abuse) were discovered, we followed 
standard institutional and state procedures and reported physical or sexual abuse to our 
state’s Child Protective Services Program (ChildLine), as required by the Pennsylvania 
Department of Human Services. The University of Pittsburgh IRB approved this study and 
IRB guidelines were followed throughout the study.

Our study excluded participants who had experienced any acute illnesses in the week 
preceding or following the blood draw (e.g., cold symptoms), had been administered a 
vaccine in the week preceding blood draw, or were actively pregnant. We also excluded 
participants who were diagnosed with systemic medical illnesses that might affect the 
immune system (e.g., ulcerative colitis), diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, or taking anti­
inflammatory medications (e.g., antibiotics, corticosteroids).. Patients with bipolar disorder 
and history of psychosis were excluded. Assessment of exclusion criteria was done both 
through adolescent interview, parent interview (if applicable), and medical chart review. 
As a condition of study eligibility, participants were engaged in naturalistic standard-of­
care community treatment, commonly including therapies such as cognitive behavioral 
therapy or dialectical behavioral therapy. Of depressed participants, 59.6% were taking an 
antidepressant at baseline. More specifically, 51.9% of depressed participants were taking a 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at baseline.

2.2  Assessment

Participants completed up to two assessments. All depressed participants (n=52) and all 
healthy control participants (n=20) completed the baseline assessment, while a subset 
of depressed participants completed the follow-up assessment (n=36). The follow-up 
assessment was scheduled based on availability of the laboratory and participant. Each 
assessment included a clinical interview by trained study staff, completion of self-report 
questionnaires by the participant, parent interview (as applicable), and a venous blood 
draw (completed within one week of the interview/questionnaires). No differences in age, 
biological sex, depression severity, or cytokine levels existed at baseline between depressed

Table S1).

2.3  Diagnosis and Clinical Measures

Diagnosis of depressive disorder was determined through clinical interview and medical 
chart review, as conducted by a board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrist. Trauma 
severity was measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which is a 28-item 
retrospective self-report assessment of lifetime childhood trauma rated on a scale from 25 to 
125(Bernstein et al., 1998). On the CTQ, five subscales rated 5 to 25 measure a spectrum of 
abuse (emotional, physical, and sexual) and neglect (emotional and physical). Higher scores 
on the CTQ Composite and CTQ subscales indicate worse severity of trauma. The CTQ 
has been validated for use in adolescents 12 years and older (Bernstein et al., 1997). Our 
primary childhood trauma measure was the CTQ Total Composite, while CTQ subscales 
were used as exploratory measures. The clinician-rated Children's Depression Rating Scale­
Revised (CDRS-R) assesses recent depressive symptomology (e.g. past month). Scores on 
the CDRS-R range from 17 to 113 (higher scores indicating greater depression severity)
(Mayes et al., 2010). CDRS-R response was defined as >50% reduction in baseline CDRS­
R raw scores, consistent with response criterion used in adolescent depression treatment 
studies(Brent et al., 2008). For CDRS-R response percentage calculation, CDRS-R scores 
were re-centered such that the lowest score of 17 was represented as 0.

2.4  Plasma Cytokine Measurement and Analysis

The plasma cytokines IL-6 and TNFα were selected for analysis given that extant studies 
describe that IL-6 and TNFα (as compared to other peripheral inflammatory markers 
such as C-reactive protein (CRP)) have the strongest associations with adverse childhood 
experiences in cohorts of depressed patients(Gill et al., 2020). IL-6 and TNFα were the only 
two inflammatory markers which were obtained. CRP was not obtained given that IL-6 is 
highly correlated with CRP and IL-6 is a major inducer of CRP hepatically (Sproston and 
Ashworth, 2018). For all participants, 20ml blood samples were drawn between 9:45am and 
1:45pm at both the baseline and follow-up assessments. Samples were centrifuged for 15 
minutes. Next, plasma was collected from samples and then immediately stored at −80°C 
in a freezer (or transported on dry ice prior to freezer storage at −80°C). Simple Plex 
assays using the antibody-based Ella™ system (ProteinSimple, Biotechne) were utilized to 
assess plasma levels of IL-6 and TNFα. The Ella system employs a solid-phase sandwich 
immunoassay. Samples were run in triplicate. TNFα and IL-6 levels assessed on Ella 
strongly correlate with TNFα and IL-6 levels assessed by ELISA (R2’s>0.96)(Aldo et al., 
2016). We ran two Ella immunoassays, with one for baseline plasma samples (n=72; used 
for all baseline analyses) and one for a subset of plasma samples from depressed patients 
at both baseline (n=36) and follow-up (n=36) (used for all longitudinal analyses). For the 
Ella system, the lower limit of detection (LLOD) for IL-6 is 0.26 pg/mL and the LLOD 
for TNFα (2nd generation) is 0.03 pg/mL. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for 
IL-6 was 7.01% and the intra-assay CV for TNFα was 1.99%. The manufacturer-reported 
inter-assay CV for IL-6 was 9.6-10.2% and the inter-assay CV for TNFα was 8.5-9%, while 
our inter-assay CV for a subset of plasma samples from the depressed cohort (n=36) was 
10.8% for IL-6 (inter-assay correlation=0.89, p<0.001) and 4.7% for TNFα (inter-assay

correlation=0.92, p<0.001). For IL-6, two sample measures were lower than the LLOD, 
and these were replaced with the LLOD, while no samples for TNFα were lower than the 
LLOD. Baseline blood draw time and blood transport time (e.g., duration between blood 
draw and placement of sample in freezer/dry ice) were not associated with either IL-6 or 
TNFα levels (p’s > 0.2).

2.5  Statistical Analysis

Prior to all analyses, cytokine values were Winsorized and then log-transformed to reduce 
potential effects from outliers. Less than 15% of values at any given timepoint were affected 
by Winsorizing. To determine baseline trauma-cytokine relationships, linear regression 
analyses were used, with baseline CTQ Composite scores as the independent variable (IV) 
and cytokine levels as the dependent variable (DV). In all regression analyses presented 
in this manuscript (unless otherwise indicated), we included body mass index (BMI) and 
biological sex as covariates given previously described effects of these on cytokine levels 
(O’Connor et al., 2009). Of note, across both depressed and healthy adolescents, BMI was 
strongly positively correlated with IL-6 levels (r=0.54, p<0.001, n=72) while TNFα was 
nonsignificantly greater in participants with male biological sex (t=1.9, p=0.07, n=72). For 
exploratory analyses, moderation analyses were performed using multiple linear regression 
(e.g., including interaction effects of depression severity and childhood trauma severity and 
main effects of depression severity and childhood trauma).

Given the potential unique trauma-cytokine associations in depressed adolescents as 
compared to healthy adolescents, we examined trauma-cytokine associations independently 
in healthy adolescents using identical methodology as done for depressed adolescents. 
However, readers should interpret such results related to healthy controls with caution given 
limited range and low level of trauma symptoms among healthy adolescents (see Table 1). 
For descriptive purposes, differences between cytokines between healthy and depressed 
cohorts are presented as well (see Table 1). For all primary analyses, we conducted 
sensitivity analyses for significant individual regression analyses, adding covariates of age, 
socioeconomic status, smoking status, antidepressant use, first-degree family history of 
depression, hormonal contraceptive use (presence/absence), vigorous activity (based on 
Godin’s Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire)(Shephard, 1997), SSRI use, and depression 
severity (measured by the CDRS-R). However, addition of these covariates did not 
appreciably change any of our significant results (see Supplemental Table S2 for further 
details). For interested readers, we also present bivariate associations between cytokine 
levels and these covariates (see Supplemental Table S2). For all analyses, we adjusted 
for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (adjusting across 
two associations given two cytokine measures). We include both unadjusted and adjusted 
p values for all primary analyses. Given concerns of potential Type II errors, we also 
conducted power analysis for regression tests (at varying potential effect size levels) across 
the different sample sizes involved in analyses, calculating that this study had at least 80% 
power to detect Cohen’s f2 effect sizes of 0.7 (i.e., very large) in the healthy cohort and 0.35 
(i.e., large) in the depressed cohort (both at baseline and follow-up) for associations between 
cytokine levels and childhood trauma (see Supplemental Table S3). Similarly, for tests of 
between-group differences in cytokines, we calculated that this study had 80% power to

detect medium to large effect size differences (Cohen’s d = 0.75) in cytokines between 
the depressed and healthy cohorts. Statistical analyses were conducted with the statistical 
software R version 3.5.2 (see https://cran.r-project.org/).

3.  Results

3.1  Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

Depressed participants (n=52; mean age 16.3 years; 77% female) and healthy controls 
(n=20; mean age 16.7 years old; 60% female) did not differ on demographic variables. 
Demographic and clinical measures for these cohorts are described in Table 1. The subset of 
depressed participants who had available data at follow-up timepoints (n=36) had significant 
reductions between baseline and follow-up timepoints in depression severity in the context 
of standard-of-care community treatment (see Table 2). The overall CDRS-R response rate 
(e.g., change in CDRS-R score >50%) was 22.2% (8/36 participants).

3.2  Cytokine Characteristics

Average baseline TNFα levels in the depressed cohort and healthy cohort were 7.28±1.57 
pg/mL and 7.83±2.5 pg/mL, respectively (see Table 1). Average baseline IL-6 levels in the 
depressed and healthy cohort were respectively 1.3±0.69 pg/mL and 1.28±1.45 pg/mL. No 
differences were found in cytokine levels between cohorts (see Table 1) and no differences 
were found in cytokine levels over time in the depressed cohort (see Table 2). In the 
depressed cohort, there were no differences in the cytokine levels between medicated and 
nonmedicated patients (both for all antidepressants and specifically for SSRIs), p’s > 0.39 
(see Supplemental Table S4).

3.3  Baseline Associations of Trauma with Cytokine Indices in Depressed Cohort

In adolescents with depression, greater CTQ Composite scores (indicating greater levels 
of childhood trauma) were significantly associated with greater TNFα levels (B=0.005, 
unadjusted p=0.003, adjusted p=0.007, n=52; see Figure 1) and there was a non-significant 
trend towards association of CTQ Composite scores with greater IL-6 levels (B=0.008, 
p= 0.07, adjusted p=0.07, n=52). On supplementary analysis examining CTQ subscales, 
Emotional Abuse CTQ scores were significantly associated with higher TNFα levels 
(B=0.017, unadjusted p<0.001, adjusted p=0.002, n=52; see Figure 2). These findings 
were not appreciably changed when statistically adjusting for depression severity (see 
Supplemental Table S2).

Of note, three other CTQ subscales (Physical Neglect, Emotional Neglect, and Sexual 
Abuse) were associated with higher TNFα levels, though these were not significant after 
adjustment for multiple comparisons (unadjusted p’s <0.06, adjusted p’s <0.1, n=52; see 
Supplemental Table S5). CTQ Physical Abuse was not associated with TNFα levels.

3.4  Baseline Associations of Trauma with Cytokine Indices in Healthy Cohort

To probe if observed trauma-cytokine associations might be similar for depressed and 
healthy control groups, we examined such associations in healthy controls. In the healthy 
cohort (n=20), no significant associations between CTQ Composite scores and TNFα levels

(B=−0.017, unadjusted p=0.23, adjusted p=0.45) or IL-6 levels (B=−0.002, unadjusted 
p=0.94, adjusted p=0.94) were found. No significant associations between childhood trauma 
subtypes and cytokine indices were found in the healthy cohort (unadjusted p’s > 0.06, 
adjusted p’s > 0.12, n=20).

3.5  Exploratory: Associations of Trauma with Changes in Cytokine Levels

On exploratory analysis in the depressed cohort, childhood trauma and associated subscales 
were not associated with changes in either IL-6 or TNFα levels over time (unadjusted p’s > 
0.07, adjusted p’s > 0.15, n=36).

3.6  Exploratory: Moderation Sensitivity Analyses

Moderation analyses for other factors (depression severity, first-degree family history of 
depressive illness, SSRI use, or antidepressant use) and childhood trauma severity did 
not predict inflammatory marker levels in the depressed cohort (unadjusted p’s>0.17; see 
Supplemental Table S6).

4.  Discussion

In this study of adolescents with depression, we found that higher TNFα levels were 
significantly associated with exposure to childhood trauma (as measured by the CTQ 
Total Composite scores) in adolescents with depression. IL-6 showed a similar positive 
association with CTQ Composite scores, but this relationship was not statistically 
significant. Taken together, findings suggest that in the context of adolescent depression, 
systemic low-grade inflammation may be linked to childhood trauma, although further 
research is needed to identify if such relationships differ between healthy control patients 
and depressed patients. Attending to potential relationships of childhood trauma and 
cytokines could reveal new avenues for precision medicine in treatment of adolescent 
depression, exemplified by an initial treatment study showing efficacy of the anti-cytokine 
treatment infliximab for bipolar depression in adults with childhood trauma(McIntyre et al., 
2019).

In adults, exposure to childhood trauma or early life adversity has been linked in meta­
analyses to elevated cytokine levels in non-depressed cohorts(Baumeister et al., 2016; 
Kuhlman et al., 2020) and in depressed cohorts in some preliminary studies(Gill et al., 2020; 
Moreira et al., 2018). Similarly, larger studies of adolescents find associations of adverse 
childhood experiences with higher systemic levels of proinflammatory mediators(Slopen 
et al., 2013). However, our study is the first to our knowledge that identifies significant 
associations between cytokine levels (particularly TNFα) and childhood trauma severity 
specifically in depressed adolescents. Unlike the depressed patient sample, we did not 
find that trauma-cytokine associations were present among our sample of healthy controls. 
However, it is necessary to note that our study was only powered to detect very large effect 
size differences (e.g., Cohen’s f2 >0.7; see Supplemental Table S3) in healthy controls, 
and there was a restricted range of trauma exposure among this cohort, emphasizing that 
well-powered studies in healthy samples of adolescents (i.e., without depressive symptoms), 
including resilient individuals exposed to trauma, are required to fully elucidate if medium

or small effect size relationships exist. In contrast to our primary findings, one prior smaller 
study of depressed adolescents did not find differences in cytokine levels between depressed 
adolescents with and without trauma(Peters et al., 2019). However, differences between 
this study and our study may have been due to methodological differences (e.g., in the 
aforementioned study, childhood trauma was defined dichotomously and noted to be present 
if scoring above the “moderate” threshold for any CTQ subscale) which limits between­
study comparisons as we (as opposed to the prior mentioned study) examined cytokine 
associations with overall childhood trauma burden and specific childhood trauma subtypes.

Existing theoretical and empirical evidence suggest an association between childhood 
trauma and changes in biological processes affecting the immune system (e.g., 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or sympathetic nervous system) and changes in 
biological processes might lead to long-term alterations in cytokine levels(Jaworska­
Andryszewska and Rybakowski, 2019). However, studies have yet to adequately 
demonstrate clear mediational associations between these biological processes and increased 
cytokine levels. Such studies suggest that childhood trauma may sensitize immune 
system components involved in cytokine release, potentially affecting immune cells (such 
as microglia), cortisol stress receptors, or epigenetic-mediated regulation of immune 
genes(Agorastos et al., 2019). Thus, conceptually, low-grade cytokine elevation in depressed 
adolescents with more severe childhood trauma may specifically be more representative of 
unique biological effects related to early sensitization of immune system components during 
critical developmental windows.

These effects of childhood trauma may be distinct from other factors that may additionally 
promote cytokine elevations in patients more broadly, such as stress(Danese and Lewis, 
2017; Johnson et al., 2019). Such factors may also explain some of the heterogeneity in our 
study findings related to trauma-cytokine associations in depressed and healthy adolescents 
(particularly given that our healthy cohort did not have a high level of trauma symptoms). 
Furthermore, as compared to other studies in depressed individuals, our study distinctively 
identifies these trauma-cytokine relationships in adolescents (with depression) rather than 
adults. Cytokine elevation in adolescents with depression may be particularly important 
given potential cytokine effects on dysregulating both normative immunodevelopment and 
normative development of neural circuitry involved in depression, which may contribute 
to an enduring elevated risk of adulthood depression across the lifespan(Brenhouse and 
Schwarz, 2016). Notably, in our study, depressed adolescents had significant reductions in 
depression severity over time, but were qualitatively much poorer responders to treatment 
(e.g., with a 22.2% response rate) compared to depressed adolescents in RCTs (e.g., with 
47% - 60% response rates), which might be consistent with theories that sensitization may 
have contributed to poor treatment response (Brent et al., 2008). However, in our study, the 
short timeframe of such an analysis, lack of randomized treatment design, and small sample 
size emphasize the need for future studies examining such potential sensitization hypotheses.

Importantly, our findings related to analysis of CTQ subscales provide robust and novel 
support for an association of childhood emotional abuse with higher circulating levels of 
TNFα levels in depressed adolescents. Though prior studies often find physical/sexual 
trauma associated with cytokine levels in adults, comparatively few clinical studies have

examined emotional trauma(Baumeister et al., 2016). Broadly speaking, emotional abuse 
is defined as sustained and adverse parental interactions that significantly affect a child’s 
emotional well-being and functioning, such as usage of repetitive derogatory language (e.g., 
“lazy” or “stupid”) or excessive criticism by parental figures towards a child(Thompson 
and Kaplan, 1996). A recent study from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety 
of 2778 depressed adults examined trauma subtypes found only emotional abuse was 
associated with a cumulative inflammation score (including TNFα and IL-6) (Kuzminskaite 
et al., 2020), suggesting that perhaps low-grade cytokine elevation in depressed patients 
exposed to childhood trauma may be more specifically associated with childhood emotional 
trauma. Given that meta-analyses identify childhood emotional neglect/trauma as having the 
strongest associations with adult depression (as compared with other types of childhood 
trauma)(Mandelli et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2017), our study complements the larger 
evidence base in adults and emphasizes the importance of examining emotional trauma in 
studies of cytokines in depressed adolescents.

Interestingly, we did not find any differences in circulating levels of cytokines between 
healthy and depressed adolescents, though our study was only powered to detect large 
effect size differences (e.g., Cohen’s d=0.75). Our study and the existing larger clinical 
study (Pallavi et al., 2015) examining cytokine differences between depressed and healthy 
adolescents were underpowered to detect small effect sizes between these cohorts, 
highlighting the need for larger well-powered studies to study cytokine differences between 
these cohorts and recognition that existing analyses are highly vulnerable to Type II error. 
Several smaller pediatric studies have found lower or no difference in certain cytokine 
levels such as TNFα (Brambilla et al., 2004; Gabbay et al., 2009) or IL-6(Lee et al., 
2020a) in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. One meta-analysis did not find 
associations between cytokines and depression (though trend-level associations between 
TNFα and depression were found) and noted concerns of heterogeneity and effects of 
unmeasured clinical factors on cytokine levels that may have precluded valid determination 
of differences between cohorts (D'Acunto et al., 2019). Consistently, our findings suggest 
that in depressed adolescents, cytokine elevation may be strongly associated with childhood 
trauma, which is one of many risk factors for depression, diluting cytokine elevation at 
the group level when collapsing across cohorts of patients with heterogenous depression 
etiologies and making group differences much more difficult to detect reliably without very 
large sample sizes. However, given the lack of variability in exposure to childhood trauma in 
our control cohort and lack of power, our study could not accurately make conclusions about 
potential associations between cytokine markers and childhood trauma in the control cohort, 
emphasizing the need for future larger studies with control cohorts with greater variability 
in childhood trauma exposure. Discernment of potential differences in childhood trauma 
and cytokine associations in depressed patients versus healthy controls would allow better 
understanding of this potential sensitizing mechanism.

In terms of longitudinal findings, we also did not find that CTQ scores predicted change in 
cytokine levels over time in this cohort of adolescents receiving naturalistic standard-of-care 
community treatment, who generally had improvements in depressive symptoms over the 
course of the test-retest interval (see Table 2). Such findings may be due to the complexity 
and variability of treatment effects on cytokine levels coupled with reduced power in our

subsample who contributed follow-up data (see Supplemental Table S3). Nevertheless, this 
null finding did not provide support for our exploratory hypothesis that childhood trauma 
would have a sensitizing impact on the immune system, manifesting in further escalations 
of cytokine levels over the course of a 4-month follow-up window. Other exploratory 
analyses in the depressed cohort, examining moderation effects of other factors (specifically 
depression severity, family history of depressive illness, SSRI use, or antidepressant use) 
on associations between childhood trauma severity and inflammatory marker levels, did not 
find significant interactive effects. Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, future 
well-powered studies are needed to examine potential moderation effects of depression 
symptom severity, genetic predisposition, or treatment effects on associations between 
childhood trauma severity and inflammatory marker levels.

Of note, though not statistically significant, IL-6 levels (log-transformed) were 
approximately two times lower in participants taking antidepressants, consistent with 
prior studies suggesting that SSRIs may act mechanistically through effects on IL-6 
levels(Basterzi et al., 2005). Also, the uniqueness of our results in finding association of 
TNFα, rather than IL-6, with childhood trauma severity is consistent with an existing 
preliminary adult study that found that infliximab (an anti-TNFα agent) was effective for 
reducing depressive symptoms in patients with a history of childhood trauma(Roman and 
Irwin, 2020). However, further adolescent studies (such as RCTs and studies with repeated 
measurements of cytokines and depression severity) are warranted to fully dissect effects of 
antidepressant/SSRI or anti-cytokine agent treatment on depressive symptoms in different 
patient populations.

Our study had several limitations. First, our study had a relatively small sample size, 
suggesting that both null and positive findings should be interpreted with caution, though 
our study is one of the largest studies to date examining cytokine levels in adolescents 
with depressive disorders. Particularly, for regression analyses involving healthy controls, 
our study was only powered to detect very large effect size differences (e.g., Cohens 
f2>0.7; see Supplemental Table S3) and thus null results related to this cohort should 
be interpreted tentatively given high risk of Type II error (and also limited variability of 
trauma in the control cohort). Given that emotional abuse was more frequently reported 
within our depressed patients than other types of abuse (e.g., physical abuse), lack of 
associations between other abuse types and TNFα may have been due to lack of power to 
detect such smaller effect size differences in our cohort. Second, in exploratory longitudinal 
analyses, we were unable to control for individual differences in treatment across the 
longitudinal follow-up (given that our study was naturalistic in nature), though this 
study design optimizes generalizability of our findings to real-world clinical populations. 
Third, given that medications were allowed both at baseline and throughout the follow-up 
period, we cannot definitively rule out the influence of medication effects on findings, 
though we found no differences in cytokine levels between medicated and non-medicated 
adolescents, adding to similar findings in other studies of adolescents suggesting that 
standard antidepressant treatment may not have significant effects on cytokine levels in 
adolescents with depression(Amitai et al., 2019; Pérez-Sánchez et al., 2018). This pattern 
further highlights the need to understand the unique influence of inflammation on subsets 
of depressed patients, with possible implications for personalized treatment. Fourth, given

that childhood trauma was retrospectively recalled and self-reported, childhood trauma 
may be susceptible to recall bias (e.g., depressed individuals may recall more negative 
events) or childhood traumatic events may have been intentionally minimized. Future studies 
may benefit from both a longitudinal and clinician-based assessment of traumatic events, 
repeated measurement of symptoms and cytokines longitudinally, and study designs using 
randomization (to assess effects of potential sensitization on treatment response) .

Taken as a whole, our findings add to a growing body of literature in adolescents that 
cytokine elevations in depression may be associated with childhood trauma (with our 
study observing this association in a sample of depressed adolescents), which may vary 
in severity on the individual level in adolescents with depression. This study may also 
provide a preliminary understanding of heterogeneity in cytokine studies of adolescent 
depression that find elevations of cytokines only in subsets of patients or in certain 
studies. Contemporary approaches in adult psychiatry emphasize the role of understanding 
inflammation through the lens of heterogeneity related to clinical factors and symptoms 
(rather than broad diagnostic categories), given such approaches may be more biologically 
valid and clinically informative (Miller, 2020). By more carefully dissecting the genesis 
of immune dysregulation, this conceptualization promotes potential future incorporation 
of certain treatments (e.g., immunomodulatory drugs) for certain high-risk patients (e.g., 
with specific clinical profiles with immune dysregulation). For instance, patients with 
high levels of trauma (as compared to patients without trauma) may benefit from certain 
immunomodulatory treatments that target specific cytokines (e.g., TNFα) during periods 
of depression, consistent with approaches by recent studies utilizing immunomodulatory 
treatment to target specific depressive symptoms(Lee et al., 2020b).

In summary, our study suggests that for adolescents with depressive disorders, prior 
childhood trauma might be a risk factor for increased TNFα, particularly in regard to 
childhood emotional abuse. These results contribute to existing literature in adolescents 
implicating a role of cytokines such as TNFα in depressive disorders. Future studies are 
needed to incorporate larger sample sizes, examine potential causal mechanisms linking 
trauma and cytokines, and parse specificity of trauma subtypes with cytokine elevation. 
Ultimately, such studies have the potential to identify effective individualized treatments for 
depression in adolescents.

Highlights

•

•

•

Higher childhood trauma was linked with higher levels of TNFα in depressed 
teens

Of trauma subtypes, only emotional abuse was associated with higher levels 
of TNFα

Childhood trauma was not associated with longitudinal changes in cytokine 
levels

Figure 1. Residual Baseline TNFa Level by Residual Baseline CTQ score
Note. Partial regression plot of residual baseline TNF-alpha (log-transformed) levels by 
residual baseline CTQ composite scores. Partial regression plot is provided to visualize 
relationship between independent and dependent variable while statistically adjusting for 
relevant covariates. Line of best fit provided for descriptive purposes. Partial regression 
plots were used to optimize graphical visualization of the nature of the relationship between 
relevant independent and dependent variables, by accounting for the effects of covariates in 
regression models through use of residual values.
