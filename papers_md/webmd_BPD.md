âOften, BPD is misunderstood and stigmatized because it presents as relational instability, push-pull behaviors, and intense emotional reactions,â says Victoria Grinman, PhD, apsychotherapistand counselor who specializes in posttraumatic growth, neurodiversity, and relational wellness.

âBut beneath the surface, BPD is fundamentally about deep insecurity, a heightened fear of abandonment, and a profound struggle with self-worth.â

Impulsive BPD.You act without thinking. Examples include overeating, overspending, breaking things, and getting into fights.

- Your medical history and an exam

- A discussion about your symptoms


## Borderline Personality Disorder Treatment


Psychotherapy is the most often recommended treatment for BPD.

One type âdialectical behavior therapyâ helps people living with BPD learn how to balance their emotions and logic. It focuses on mindfulness, dealing with feelings that cause distress, and having effective relationships with others.

While medication can help manage some of the BPD symptoms, such as anxiety ordepression, itâs not part of frontline treatment.

âThe true pain and dysfunction often stem from relational trauma, meaning that healing typically requires relationally based therapeutic work,â says Grinman. âAs I say, when trauma is born in relationship, it is healed in relationship, too.â
