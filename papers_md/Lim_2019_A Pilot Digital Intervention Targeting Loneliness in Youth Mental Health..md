Background:  Loneliness  is  an  emerging  issue  for  young  people,  but  yet  many 
interventions to address loneliness in this group focus on providing social opportunities. 
While these sorts of interventions may appear to increase social connections, loneliness 
is more related to quality rather than quantity of social relationships. Thus, interventions 
addressing  loneliness  should  focus  on  maximizing  the  quality  of  current  relationships. 
Together  with  youth  consumers  both  with  mental  ill  health  and  those  without,  we 
developed a digital smartphone application (app) called +Connect. The 6-week program 
delivers positive psychology content designed to improve relationship quality. We tested 
the  acceptability,  feasibility,  and  safety  of  the  program  in  lonely  young  people  with  or 
without a mental health diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. We used a mixed method 
study design to triangulate pilot quantitative and qualitative data in young people with and 
without social anxiety disorder (SAD).

Method: Nine participants with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (Mage = 21.00; SD = 1.41) 
and 11 participants with no mental health conditions (Mage = 20.36; SD = 2.16) completed the 
+Connect digital intervention.

Results: Those with social anxiety disorder reported less acceptable ratings on outcomes. 
Feasibility ratings, measured by uptake and app completion, met a priori threshold criteria 
in  both  groups.  Those  with  social  anxiety  disorder  yielded  more  attrition,  with  almost 
double the attrition rate compared with those without the disorder. There were no safety 
issues elicited during the pilot study. In terms of outcomes, exploratory analyses indicated 
that the app itself is likely to be beneficial rather than cause harm. Our qualitative data 
indicated both groups reported no negative outcomes and noted that positive outcomes 
were  driven  by  three  processes:  reflection,  learning,  and  real-life  application.  Further 
exploratory  data  on  usability  indicated  room  for  improvement  in  terms  of  giving  more 
support for different components of the app (i.e., challenges).

Conclusion: The pilot findings of this proof-of-concept app indicates some promise in 
terms of a second iterative version of +Connect.

Loneliness and Digital Intervention

INTRODUCTION

Loneliness  is  a  subjective  experience  of  social  isolation  (1), 
and  although  such  aversive  feelings  occur  across  the  lifespan 
(2),  young  adults  (18–29),  together  with  older  adults  (65–79) 
are  the  most  vulnerable  to  loneliness,  reporting  the  highest 
prevalence compared to other age groups (3). Forming meaningful 
relationships  with  others  is  critical  to  our  survival,  and  the 
lethality  of  loneliness  is  well  established.  Future  poor  health 
and increased risk of death is predicted by loneliness (4, 5). In 
addition,  deleterious  effects  have  been  observed  on  various 
physical  health  conditions,  including  decreased  immunity  (6), 
increased inflammatory response (7), elevated blood pressure (8), 
decreased cognitive health (9), and faster progress of Alzheimer’s 
disease (10), to name a few.

The challenge of loneliness is magnified by its effects on mental 
health  in  addition  to  its  effects  on  physical  health.  Loneliness 
is  well  known  to  be  associated  with  increased  mental  health 
symptoms in both clinical (11, 12) and nonclinical populations 
(13–15). In longitudinal studies that examined older adults aged 
50–68,  loneliness  predicted  depressive  symptomatology  over 
and above potential confounding variables (e.g., demographics, 
stress, and social support) (16). Similarly, in a large-scale general 
population study of people aged 18 to 87 years old (N = 1,010), 
loneliness predicted more severe social anxiety, depression, and 
paranoia  across  a  6-month  period  (17).  Given  these  results, 
targeting loneliness has the potential to prevent the development 
of more severe psychiatric symptoms.

Focusing interventions on youth might have the largest impact 
because loneliness and psychiatric symptoms are common in this 
age group and because of the potential for secondary prevention. 
In  a  large  Danish  study  of  adolescents  and  young  people  aged 
between 16 and 29 years old (n = 5,324), being female, having low 
levels of education, and living in a deprived area were risk factors 
for loneliness (18). Young people aged 12 to 25 are also at high 
risk  of  developing  emerging  mental  illnesses  (19).  In  the  2007 
Australian  National  Survey  of  Mental  Health  and  Wellbeing, 
young  people  aged  16–24  years  have  the  highest  prevalence  of 
mental disorders, but the lowest rate of receiving services in the 
past  12  months  (20,  21).  Young  adulthood  is  further  marked 
with  significant  life  changes  from  leaving  school  or  home,  to 
facing  new  social  challenges  such  as  higher  education  or  work 
(22).  Such  social  transitions  mean  that  young  adults  may  be 
more reliant than ever on their social networks for support (23). 
Having high-quality relationships can improve the young adult’s 
ability  to  adjust  to  new  social  environments  (24,  25),  buffering 
the effects of loneliness (26).

Interventions aimed at fostering social inclusion and enhancing 
social  relationships  can  promote  psychological  well-being  or 
promote  recovery  from  problematic  mental  health  symptoms 
(27).  However,  because  loneliness  is  more  related  to  the  quality 
of social relationships than to the quantity (28, 29), interventions 
that  focus  solely  on  providing  more  social  opportunities  to  the 
“lonely”  individual  have  shown  minimal  benefit  (30).  This  is 
because  loneliness  is  not  the  same  as  being  alone  or  physically 
isolated  and  is  not  strongly  correlated  with  time  spent  alone 
(31). Hence, simply asking a “lonely” individual to join a group 

or interact with others provides either transient or minimal relief 
from  loneliness.  Cognitive  models  of  loneliness  elaborate  on 
the  distinction  between  loneliness  and  being  objectively  alone. 
Proponents of such models contend that while the adverse nature 
of  loneliness  motivates  “lonely”  individuals  to  connect  with 
others, they are also hypervigilant to social threats, causing them 
to  find  evidence  that  people  are  not  trustworthy  or  accepting 
(32, 33). In response, the “lonely” individual shows less prosocial 
behaviors toward others in an attempt to protect him or herself 
from rejection thereby eliciting rejection from others (32, 33).

The cycle outlined above suggests that a key target in reducing 
loneliness  is  to  maximize  the  experience  of  social  connection 
within  existing  relationships  by  helping  the  “lonely”  individual 
to  show  more  prosocial  behaviors  toward  others.  A  positive 
psychology-based  intervention  provides  a  useful  framework 
when  addressing  loneliness  as  it  is  designed  to  increase  the 
meaningfulness  of  existing  relationships,  promote  positive 
emotions,  and  focus  on  thriving  during  adversity  (34–36). 
Positive  psychology  is  the  scientific  study  about  what  is  right 
about  the  individual  (as  opposed  to  what  is  wrong),  and  it 
involves  identifying  positive  characteristics,  strengths,  and 
psychological assets, which are inherent in a person irrespective 
of societal status (37).

Young people are well known to use digital tools extensively 
to connect with others, but existing social media apps may favor 
a large number of brief social interactions, as opposed to fewer 
and more meaningful relationships or designed to increase social 
support  (38).  Existing  social  media  platforms  carry  a  risk  of 
alienation  and  cyberbullying  (39,  40),  which  might  contribute 
to  more  loneliness  (41).  This  situation  suggests  the  possibility 
of  using  a  more  positive  app  to  build  on  strengths  and  reduce 
loneliness.  This  possibility  comports  well  with  the  increase  in 
digital  platforms  to  either  augment  face-to-face  mental  health 
interventions  or  to  simply  engage  young  people  who  would 
otherwise  not  engage  in  mental  health  intervention  (42). 
Although a digital health intervention that can deliver evidence-
based  health  information  is  highly  valuable  and  preferred  by 
young people (43, 44), significant resources for development and 
testing are required.

We  developed  a  proof-of-concept  digital  tool  to  address 
loneliness  in  young  people.  +Connect  is  a  6-week  smartphone 
intervention using a strengths-based positive psychology framework. 
It is gamified and engaging. It delivers videos and posts daily in an 
attempt to convey evidence-based concepts known to strengthen 
relationships and increase social connections. Over 2015–2017, 
young  people  aged  18  to  25  participated  in  a  series  of  focus 
groups. The groups included members that ranged from young 
people with no mental ill health, to those with a history of high 
prevalence  disorders  (e.g.,  depression,  social  anxiety)  to  those 
with  psychotic  disorders.  Feedback  from  initial  focus  groups 
also  recommended  that  content  should  be  delivered  in  short 
but  frequent  bursts  (as  opposed  to  longer  and  dedicated  time) 
(45). We opted to develop a smartphone app over other digital 
platforms because of its mobility and accessibility (46–48). The 
group  then  provided  feedback  on  design  (i.e.,  fonts,  colors, 
layout),  functionality  (e.g.,  task  completion  and  gamification), 
and language (e.g., written task and video content).

Loneliness and Digital Intervention

In a pilot study, we employed a mixed methods approach using 
both  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  in  order  to  deepen  our 
understanding of how young people experience +Connect. The 
primary study aim was to examine the acceptability, feasibility, 
and  safety  of  +Connect  in  young  people  with  or  without 
social  anxiety  disorder.  First,  we  anticipated  that  +Connect 
would  be  acceptable  to  both  groups  of  young  people.  This 
would be demonstrated by participants reporting higher than 
somewhat  in  their  satisfactory  and  helpfulness  ratings  across 
a  series  of  criteria,  including  understanding,  enjoyment,  and 
content helpfulness.

Second,  we  anticipated  that  +Connect  would  be  feasible 
across three key factors: uptake, attrition, and app completion. 
For uptake, we anticipated that at least 50% of people who were 
interested would attend a baseline assessment. For attrition, we 
anticipated no more than 30% attrition rate for both groups. We 
further  considered  a  participant  to  be  a  drop  out  if  he  or  she 
ceased using the app for >3 consecutive days, and the researchers 
were unable to contact the participant. For app completion, we 
hypothesized  that  participants  would  complete  at  least  70%  of 
the  program  (equivalent  to  30  of  the  42  days  of  content).  We 
explored  other  possible  feasibility  factors  via  the  qualitative 
interview. Third, we anticipated that +Connect would be safe to 
use  for  lonely  young  people  and  to  assess  safety,  we  measured 
the number of adverse events that occurred during the course 
of the study.

Fourth,  in  an  exploratory  analysis,  in  order  to  determine 
if  the  intervention  reduces  loneliness  severity,  we  estimated 
the  plausible  effect  size  of  +Connect  on  loneliness  ratings 
via  a  latent  trajectory  model  in  an  exploratory  analysis.  We 
included measures of mental health such as social anxiety and 
depression  symptom  severity  that  could  influence  loneliness 
severity.  Last,  in  a  second  exploratory  analysis,  we  measured 
the  usability  of  the  app  (e.g.,  functionality,  navigation)  and 
acceptability  ratings  around  the  app  design,  concepts,  and 
delivery components.

mood evaluation tracker. They are then directed to a task which 
was delivered either: 1) via text and images (e.g., an Instagram 
format); 2) SEVs featuring young people with lived experiences; 
3) EVs featuring academics introducing core concepts; or 4) AVs 
featuring  actors  who  would  model  interactions  within  specific 
social contexts.

Videos were designed to be brief (i.e., 1.21 to 4.38 min). AV 
scripts were written by a scriptwriter (under 25 years of age) and 
reviewed in a series of focus groups with young people (students, 
those  with  a  history  of  high  prevalence  and  serious  mental 
illness).  Two  coders  unrelated  to  this  study  (graduate  students 
under clinical training) rated the content of each SEV on whether 
it achieved the aims of the modules (e.g., gratitude video: to relay 
that expressing gratitude can feel awkward at first, and it is more 
than  saying  thank  you).  These  processes  meant  that  material 
was checked and refined to ensure that concepts were simple to 
understand, youth friendly, and relatable. Participants completed 
daily tasks and were asked to answer a series questions related to 
the post or video, using a multiple choice or True/False format. 
Daily tasks did not exceed past 5 min. The gamification processes 
include  winning  points  and  badges  through  task  completion, 
mood monitoring logins, progress through the app, and winning 
challenges  (52–54).  Supplementary  Table  1  outlines  what  was 
delivered  within  +Connect  app.  The  content  was  developed  by 
ML, JG, TR, and DP. There are different tasks (e.g., the gratitude 
exercise,  showing  gratitude)  that  can  sit  under  one  general 
module (e.g., Gratitude).

Participants
Twenty participants aged 18 to 23 years old were recruited for the 
study. Nine participants with social anxiety disorder (M = 21.00, 
SD = 1.41) were recruited from a local youth health service, while 
11 participants with no diagnosable mental health disorder (M = 
20.36, SD = 0.52) were recruited through convenience sampling 
from an Australian university. See Table 1 for more participant 
demographic information.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

+Connect Application Information
We  opted  to  relay  socially  oriented  content  via  video  material 
wherever possible. We developed three types of videos: 1) shared 
experience  videos  (SEVs)  using  young  people  with  lived 
experiences of loneliness (49); 2) expert videos (EVs) featuring 
academics (50), or 3) actor1 videos (AVs) demonstrating concepts 
via  modeling  (51),  all  of  which  have  already  been  utilized  in 
previous digital interventions.

Key  concepts  relayed  via  a  smartphone  app  means  that 
content  had  to  be  concise  and  frequent  as  opposed  to  other 
internet  delivered  interventions,  which  may  require  longer 
but  more  infrequent  discrete  blocks.  +Connect’s  program 
was  designed  to  be  delivered  in  less  than  5  min  over  42  days 
(6  weeks).  Participants  are  shown  a  home  screen  when  they 
opened the app. They were asked to log their mood states using a

Materials
Participants attended three assessments: Time 1 (T1), baseline; 
Time 2 (T2), post-treatment (after completing at least 33 days of 
+Connect); and Time 3 (T3), 3-month follow up (conducted 3 
months after the T2 assessment). All measures were administered 
at all timepoints except for a) the Structured Clinical Interview 
for  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders 
(SCID-5-RV;  55),  which  was  only  administered  at  baseline, 
and  b)  the  qualitative  interview,  which  was  conducted  only 
at T2.

The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID-5-RV; 55)
The  SCID-5-RV  depression  and  social  anxiety  modules  were 
administered  at  baseline  to  determine  the  study  eligibility  and 
clinical diagnosis for the SAD group. Thirty percent amount of 
the assessments was randomly selected and independently rated 
by another coder with 100% agreement on diagnosis.

The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS; 34)
The UCLA-LS, a 20-item self-report scale, was used as a measure 
of  loneliness  severity.  It  uses  a  1  (Never)  to  4  (Always)  Likert-
type scale. The measure consists of both positively and negatively 
worded items that assess loneliness (e.g., How often do you feel 
that you are no longer close to anyone)? The UCLA-LS has been 
shown to correlate negatively with life satisfaction and perceived 
social  support,  thus  supporting  its  convergent  validity  with 
related  constructs  (56).  Internal  consistencies  αs  ranged  from 
0.90 to 0.95 across time.

The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; 56)
The  original  SIAS  is  a  20-item  self-report  questionnaire  that 
measures anxiety-related reactions to different social interactions 
(e.g., I get nervous if I have to speak with someone in authority). 
The  17  straightforwardly-worded  items  (S-SIAS)  were  found 
to  be  more  valid  indicators  of  social  interaction  anxiety  than 
the  reverse-scored  items  across  different  samples  (57).  For  this 
reason, we used the straightforward items. Internal consistencies 
ranged between αs = 0.91 and 0.94 across time.

Centre for Epidemiological Studies – Depression 
(CES-D; 58)
The CES-D is a 20-self-report measure of depressive symptoms, 
which employs a 0 (rare or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of 
the time) Likert-type scale. Scores are summed to create a total 
score  indicative  of  depression  symptomatology,  where  higher 
scores  indicate  the  presence  of  more  symptomatology.  The 

CES-D has strong internal reliability (58). Internal consistencies 
for the CES-D ranged from αs = 0.88 to 0.90 across time.

Semi-Structured Qualitative Interview
Participants were invited to complete a semi-structured interview 
regarding their experiences using +Connect at T2. The questions 
are provided in Table 2. The interview was transcribed verbatim 
prior to analysis.

Design and Procedures
Human research ethics approval was obtained from the university 
ethics board, and written informed consent was obtained from 
participants.  We  recruited  young  people  who  were  assessed  to 
be  lonely.  There  were  two  groups:  1)  young  people  with  social 
anxiety disorder and young people with no current mental health 
disorder. Participants with social anxiety disorder were recruited 
via their case manager at the local youth mental health service. 
A student group was recruited via print media placed around the 
local university. All potential participants were first screened via 
telephone to assess their eligibility for the study. See Table 3 for 
inclusion–exclusion criteria for each group.

The  research  assistant  administered  the  UCLA  Loneliness 
three-item scale (59) over the telephone; those who scored 5 or 
more and did not meet the exclusion criteria were invited to a 
face-to-face baseline assessment, during which they completed 
the remaining measures. At the baseline assessment, participants 
provided consent to the study and complete the UCLA-LS. The 
research assistant scored the scale and proceeded with the SCID-
5-RV if the score is above 38. The SCID-5 was audio recorded in 
order to conduct inter-rater reliability on the clinical diagnosis. 
Participants were excluded at this point if they met any of the 
exclusion criteria. Participants who were assessed to be eligible 
then completed the remaining assessments.

Experience of the app

Benefits and challenges of the app

Functionality of the app

How did you feel after finishing 
+Connect?
What was it like to go through all the 
42 days?
What did you think about the different 
types of videos (Probe: SEV vs AV 
vs Expert)?
What was it like doing the challenges 
(Probe: applying +Connect to daily 
life)?
What would have encouraged you to 
do the challenges more?
What was it like to do all the tasks? 
(Probe: What could have encouraged 
you to complete them)?
What part of +Connect was the most 
helpful, and why?
What part of +Connect did you find 
the most fun, and why?
What did you find challenging about 
+Connect and why?
What was it like to focus on your 
strengths and positive things?
How did using the app fit in with your 
daily life?
Where and what time did you usually 
use the app?
Research tells us that people like 
apps to be interactive – are there any 
interactive features that you would 
have liked to have seen in the app? 
Were all the sections in +Connect 
relevant to you? Why or why not?
Finally, do you have suggestions 
that can help us improve the app for 
other people that use it?

Once  participants  completed  the  baseline  assessment, 
research assistants introduced and oriented the participant to 
the  app  (i.e.,  completing  the  first  day  with  the  participant). 
The  participant  was  briefed  on  the  purpose,  design,  and 
functionality  of  the  app,  and  shown  how  to  navigate  the 
different  components.  Researchers  were  able  to  monitor 
the  progress  of  the  participants  via  a  webpage.  Participants 
were  contacted  weekly  for  brief  check  in  (either  via  text  or 
a phone call). This was conducted to ensure technical issues 
were  reported  swiftly  and  to  identify  and  address  emerging 
risk  issues  during  the  course  of  the  study.  Participants  were 
reimbursed for the completion of each assessment ($15/h). If 
they completed every day of the app, they were reimbursed up 
to $1.90 per day. This was done to offset the cost of data use 
outside WIFI zones.

Data Analytic Plan
A mixed methods approach included both descriptive statistics 
and qualitative analysis. Specifically, participant interviews and 
qualitative  survey  responses  were  analyzed  using  content  and 
thematic analysis. These data were used to support quantitative 

data.  An  exploratory  analysis  using  a  latent  trajectory  model 
of  the  UCLA-LS  was  also  used  to  estimate  the  effects  of  the 
intervention on young people. Bayesian estimation was used in 
Mplus (60) to provide a credible interval for the intervention’s 
effect  over  time,  assuming  a  linear  slope  across  reporting 
periods.  We  consider  these  analyses  exploratory  because  they 
were clearly underpowered to detect anything but a large effect 
size  given  the  sample  size.  We  also  reported  Cohen’s  d  for 
effect size. Consistent with all pilot interventions, acceptability, 
feasibility,  and  safety  are  the  primary  outcomes.  Acceptability 
was  assessed  at  post-intervention  using  satisfaction  ratings 
on  questionnaires,  content  helpfulness  ratings,  and  qualitative 
interview  data  that  support  these  measures.  Feasibility  was 
assessed  by  considering  four  key  factors:  uptake,  attrition, 
retention, app completion, and engagement. Uptake was defined 
as the number of potentially eligible young people who attended 
the  baseline  assessment.  Attrition  was  defined  as  the  number 
of participants who attended the baseline assessment but failed 
to  log  into  the  app  for  more  than  three  consecutive  days  and 
where  researchers  were  unable  to  contact  the  participant.  App 
completion  was  defined  as  accessing  and  completing  at  least 
70% of the app (30 out of 42 days). Consistent with most pilot 
interventions  and  recommendations  (61),  we  also  measured 
Safety,  which  was  operationalized  as  the  incidence  of  serious 
adverse  events  (e.g.,  hospitalization  and  self-harm)  during  the 
course of the study (62).

RESULTS

Acceptability
App Satisfaction Ratings
We  set  a  priori  threshold  of  outcome  satisfaction  ratings 
of  more  than  70%  of  participants  in  each  group  would  rate 
higher  than  somewhat  satisfied  in  their  satisfactory  ratings 
(that ranged from very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, not at all 
satisfied) across a set of criteria relating to different outcome 
ratings  regarding  ease  of  understanding,  enjoyment  in  life, 
and  content  helpfulness.  Student  app  satisfaction  ratings. 
Around  72.73%  of  participants  in  the  student  group  said 
that they were somewhat or very satisfied with each outcome 
criterion  (see  Table  4).  Furthermore,  all  participants  found 
+Connect  easy  to  understand;  however,  18.18%  to  27.27% 
reported being not at all satisfied with several components of 
+Connect, including increasing social confidence and creating 
new  relationships.  See  Table  4  for  details  of  the  outcome 
satisfaction  ratings.  Social  anxiety  group  app  satisfaction 
ratings. As shown in Table 5, at least 50% of participants in 
the social anxiety group rated themselves as either somewhat 
or very satisfied with each of the outcome criterions. Similar 
to  students,  all  of  the  participants  with  SAD  reported  that 
+Connect  was  easy  to  understand  and  helped  them  accept 
their  mental  health  symptoms.  However,  25.00%  to  50.00% 
reported being not at all satisfied with several components of 
the  app,  including  creating  new  relationships  and  increasing 
social confidence.

App Content Helpfulness
Additional  acceptability  questions  related  to  how  helpful  the 
content  was.  Student  group  content  helpfulness.  Overall, 
students tended to find the modules of +Connect helpful, with 
27.27% to 81.81% reporting the modules to be either helpful or 
very  helpful.  If  we  extend  positive  ratings  to  include  somewhat 
helpful, we see that 91.01% to 100% of the participants reported 
+Connect  to  be  helpful.  In  interviews,  student  participants 
reported  Three  Good  Things  as  their  favorite  module  (n  =  7), 
e.g., “I found the ones that were about how to make you feel better 
about yourself. So ones like three good things, for example….those 
bits I found most helpful.” Those modules that students reported 
most  as  not  relevant  in  their  lives  were  self-disclosure  (n  =  2) 
and balanced relationships (n = 2). This was primarily because 
they  felt  they  were  “already  aware  of  all  that  stuff ”  or  had  not 
experienced  a  situation  in  which  the  information  would  be 
relevant,  i.e.,  “Balanced  relationships  …  I  really  didn’t  relate  to 
myself because I never had like that kind of relationship where it 
was always imbalanced or one-sided.”

All students found the shared experience and expert videos 
somewhat or very much useful and enjoyable, while 81.81% of 
students found the actor videos were useful and 72.72% rating 
them as enjoyable (see Supplementary Table 2 for details). This 
differed  somewhat  from  the  qualitative  findings;  while  four 
students reported preferring the shared experience videos, one 
student found them boring and hard to relate to, “Because when 
people  actually  shared  their  experiences,  they  are  feeling  that 

emotion, but you can’t feel that.” Three students instead reported 
a  preference  for  the  actor  videos.  However,  a  further  two 
student participants reported finding the actor videos “kind of 
forced,” “kind of creepy,” and “fake.” Three participants reported 
the expert videos as their favorite type of video.

Social anxiety group content helpfulness. Overall, participants 
with SAD tended to find the modules of +Connect helpful with 
25%  to  100%  reporting  modules  to  be  either  helpful  or  very 
helpful  (see  Supplementary  Table  3  for  details).  If  we  include 
somewhat helpful as a positive rating, we see that 75.00% to 100% 
of the participants with SAD reported +Connect to be helpful. 
In interviews, participants with SAD also reported Three Good 
Things  as  their  favorite  module  (n  =  3).  Two  participants  with 
SAD reported that the savoring module was not relevant in their 
lives as “It felt a bit wishy washy and I didn’t really know how to 
relate that too much of my life.”

Participants  with  SAD  reported  a  different  pattern  of 
preference  for  the  video  types  in  comparison  to  the  student, 
in  that  87.50%  reported  shared  experience  videos  as  being 
somewhat or very much useful, while 75.00% reported them being 
somewhat or very much enjoyable. This was supported, in part, by 
the qualitative results; five participants with SAD endorsed the 
shared  experience  videos  as  “genuine,”  “inspiring,”  and  “easy  to 
relate to,” while two participants with SAD felt that the content 
was sometimes “fake” or “not relevant to [their] own experience.” 
For the expert and actor videos, 75.00% of the participants with 
SAD  rated  the  videos  as  somewhat  or  very  much  useful,  while

only 50.00% rated the expert videos as either somewhat or very 
much enjoyable and 62.50% rated the actor videos as somewhat or 
very much enjoyable. This difference in the rating of actor video 
usefulness and enjoyable was reflected in the qualitative findings. 
Four participants with SAD reported preferring the actor videos 
over the shared experience videos as “you actually see how they 
are  feeling  and  you  understand  how  things  are.”  However,  two 
participants with SAD agreed with the student participants who 
found the actor videos “a bit cheesy.”

Feasibility
Uptake
We  set  a  priori  threshold  of  at  least  50%  of  people  who  were 
eligible  would  attend  a  baseline  assessment.  Student  uptake: 
One  hundred  and  one  participants  initially  expressed  interest 
in  participating  in  the  project  over  a  10-month  period.  Fifty-
one  students  did  not  want  to  participate  in  the  context  of  a 
research  project  but  were  given  access  outside  the  trial.  Of  the 
remaining 50 students, 22 were found to be potentially eligible 
after  the  initial  phone  screen;  the  remaining  28  were  screened 
out primarily for not identifying as lonely or needing to connect, 
exceeding  the  age  requirements,  or  having  a  mental  illness.  Of 
the 22 people who were potentially eligible for the study, we were 
unable  to  contact  two  participants  for  a  baseline  assessment, 
leaving  only  20  participants  who  were  invited  to  a  baseline 
assessment. Hence, the uptake was around 90% with 2 out of 22 
participants (around 91% uptake). Social anxiety group uptake. 
Nineteen young people were presented as potential participants 
from  a  local  health  service  over  a  12-month  period.  Two  of 
these  people  were  non-responsive  to  telephone  attempts,  while 
two people were ruled ineligible for the study during the phone 
screen for substance abuse (one participant) and increased risk 
to safety (one participant). The remaining 15 people were eligible 
to complete the baseline assessment, and of these, two people did 
not attend the baseline or did not finish the baseline assessment. 
The  remaining  13  participants  were  enrolled  in  +Connect. 
Therefore,  the  uptake  for  social  anxiety  is  around  13  out  of  15 
participants (around 87% uptake).

Attrition
We set a priori threshold of a 30% attrition rate for both groups. 
Student  group  attrition.  There  was  a  rate  of  15.38%  with  two 
participants  dropping  out  of  the  study  citing  no  reason.  Social 
anxiety  group  attrition.  There  was  an  attrition  rate  of  30.76% 
with 4 participants out of 13 dropping out of the study, and the 
only reason cited was time commitment.

App Completion
We set a priori app completion rate of 70% (30 out of 42 days) 
for  both  groups.  Student  group  app  completion.  Participants 
completed  90.26%  of  the  app  (M  =  37.91  days,  SD  =  5.09) 
exceeding the a priori requirement of 30 out of 42 days. Social 
anxiety group app completion. Participants (n = 9) completed 
approximately 84.66% of +Connect (M = 35.56 days, SD = 7.78), 
exceeding our a priori requirement of 30 days out of 42.

Other Feasibility Factors
There were additional feasibility factors relating to time burden, 
and  difficulties  with  app  components  that  were  elicited.  Time 
burden.  Around  78.95%  of  the  participants  (15/19)  found  that 
the app did not create a significant time burden, reporting they 
used the app for 3 or more minutes per day, while the remaining 
21.05% (4/19) reported using the  app less than 3 min per day2. 
In  interviews,  one  SAD  and  one  student  participant  reported 
difficulties  with  the  length  of  the  strength  challenge,  and  one 
SAD  participant  reported  difficulties  with  the  longer  videos, 
i.e., “When they started becoming four minutes and such, they got 
really really difficult to concentrate on them, or just like, find the 
time to actually do that.” Maintaining engagement. The greatest 
difficulty participants with SAD reported during interviews was 
remembering to complete the challenges and tasks (n = 5), e.g., “It 
was quite difficult to remember for me. Cos you know, even though 
like occasionally it would give me like a notification say I’ll forget 
to do it because I might have like gone to work or you know, I’ve 
got uni work I’m doing or whatever. I tried at one point to make 
it like a daily thing where I’d wake up and I’d do it. But that didn’t 
really  work  out.  So  it  was  hard  to  keep  consistent.”  Conversely, 
only two student participants reported difficulties remembering 
to  complete  the  app.  It  seemed  that  for  student  participants,  it 
became part of their routine more easily, i.e., “doing the app was 
just a daily task and then I think because there were some coming 
around  it  was  just  making  interest  to  like  continue  on  with  the 
app.” This may partly be due to more control participants (n = 4) 
reporting being motivated by the app gamification than clinical 
participants  (n  =  1).  Difficulties  with  app  components.  Three 
participants  with  SAD  also  reported  difficulties  completing  the 
challenges.  This  seemed  to  be  primarily  due  to  social  anxiety 
severity levels, i.e., “these kind of challenges I thought would take 
a  lot  of  confidence  in  me.  I  just  procrastinated  on  them  a  bit.” 
Participants suggested breaking down the challenges into smaller 
and shorter components to make completion easier, i.e., “maybe 
simple,  easy  challenges  like  ‘today,  compliment  a  stranger’s  outfit’ 
or something. I think if I did those kind of exercises each day, it will 
help me a lot in my social anxiety.”

Safety
No participant in either group reported any adverse event during 
the program.

Health and Wellbeing Outcomes
First,  we  report  the  descriptive  scores,  means,  and  standard 
deviations  across  the  two  groups  across  time  (see  Table  6  for 
descriptive statistics). Because our intent was to be descriptive, 
we do not provide tests of between-group differences, but we do 
describe changes over time within group. Next, we used a latent 
trajectory model of the UCLA-LS to estimate the effects of the 
intervention on young people. Bayesian estimation was used in 
Mplus  (60)  to  provide  a  credible  interval  for  the  intervention’s 
effect over time, assuming a linear slope across reporting periods.

2Due to a technical issue with the survey, one participant did not contribute to the 
feasibility, acceptability, and usability ratings of the +Connect App.

*n = 10 because one participant had missing data on item. SAD refers to Social Anxiety Disorder. UCLA-LS refers to University of California Loneliness Scale. S-SIAS refers to 
straightforward items from Social Anxiety Interaction Scale. CES-D refers to Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression.

Student Group Descriptives
The  UCLA-LS,  S-SIAS,  and  CES-D  scores  decreased  from 
baseline to post-intervention and 3 months post intervention.

Social Anxiety Group Descriptives
The  UCLA-LS  and  S-SIAS  scores  decreased  in  a  linear  trend 
from  baseline  to  3  months  post-intervention  for  the  SAD 
group. However, CES-D scores decreased from baseline to post-
treatment, but scores appeared to regress toward their baseline at 
the 3-month post-intervention period.

Combined Exploratory Quantitative Outcomes
Across the entire group of participants, loneliness showed a mean 
negative slope (M = −3.82, 95% Credible Interval [CI] −5.54 – 
−2.17). On the average, participants’ UCLA-LS scores decreased 
by  7.64  points  (where  the  standard  deviation  at  baseline  was 
8.11) by follow-up, suggesting a large effect (Cohen’s d = 0.94). 
If  anything,  results  were  stronger  for  students  than  the  group 
overall  (M  =  −4.38,  95%  CI  −8.45  –  −0.66,  d  =  1.12,  based  on 
an  SD  of  7.84).  The  effect  appeared  similar  in  size,  although  it 
had a wider confidence interval for the group of participants with 
SAD (M = −3.39, 95% CI −7.61 – 0.41, d = 1.20, based on an SD 
of  5.61).  In  each  analysis,  the  slope  had  a  significant  variance, 
indicating  meaningful  variation in  how  participants  responded 
to the intervention.

Qualitative App Outcomes
In interviews, 75% of the participants reported at least one positive 
outcome from using the app. These primarily included increased 
positive affect (e.g., “When I was using it more regularly … I felt 
a lot more happy with myself ”) and improved social interactions 
(e.g., “I know more friends and can talk with them more.”). Four 
participants (nclin = 2, ncontrol = 2) reported no positive outcomes 
from  using  the  app,  (e.g.,  “it  only  takes  up  such  a  small  part  of 
your day that it’s not like it changed my lifestyle in any big dramatic 
way”). No participants reported negative outcomes from using the 
app. Positive outcomes seemed to be driven by three main processes 
induced by the app: 1) reflection (nclin = 5, ncontrol = 5); 2) learning 
(nclin = 6, ncontrol = 8); and 3) real-life application (nclin = 4, ncontrol = 5).

Reflection
This  factor  seemed  to  be  the  primary  process  underlying  the 
increase in positive affect reported by participants, e.g., “I don’t 
really tend to reflect on stuff that much and it helped me to go ‘oh, 
I could do that, and it would be productive’.” Participants reported 

using  the  challenges,  video  content,  and  mood  logs  as  ways  of 
stimulating reflection.

Learning
In  terms  of  learning  processes,  while  videos  were  the  main 
source  of  psychoeducational  information,  several  participants 
(nclin = 4, ncontrol = 3) highlighted the key role of the after-video 
questions  in  their  learning  process,  i.e.,  “The  questions  were 
definitely good. They were definitely smart because they made you, 
made you watch the video. You wanted to get them right because 
you learnt something.”

Real Life Application
While some participants (nclin = 2, ncontrol = 2) found that the app 
provided  little  new  knowledge,  they  nonetheless  valued  how  it 
provided  revision  of  existing  or  commonsense  knowledge,  e.g., 
“this  stuff  you  just  rarely  notice,  but  it’s  just  a  little  bit  reminder 
that you should be doing this to people around you.” This revision 
often led participants to attempt to apply the lessons in real life, 
either  informally,  or  more  often,  through  the  challenges:  “the 
challenges  …  just  meant  that  it  became  a  lot  more  …  like  oh  ‘I 
can actually take it out into the world and do some of the things it 
suggested’.” Participants reported finding this real-life application 
both rewarding and challenging, i.e., “I feel like I’ve, there was a lot 
of information that at first seemed like common sense, to me, but 
although it may seem like common sense, it’s actually like important 
that we know those things because once we actually implement it, it 
actually makes a difference in our lives,” “Challenging? Trying to put 
it into real life context. And actually do it.”

Three clinical participants reported an intent to apply +Connect 
skills in future social interactions, primarily due to a lack of current 
opportunities to apply the skills, e.g., “because I don’t really have any 
friends or relationships [the app is] not relevant to me right now … 
But I feel like if I got a relationship it would be helpful. I definitely 
learned a lot, and I did take quite a bit of stuff from it.”

Usability
We  measured  variables  related  to  functionality,  design,  and 
delivery of concepts in order to better design a second iterative 
version of +Connect. Student group usability. Overall, students 
found  +Connect  to  be  a  usable  smartphone  application  with 
72.72% to 100% of participants rating that they agree or extremely 
agree that +Connect was easy to navigate, the format made sense, 
and that the language was easy to understand. Similarly, 72.72% 
to 100% rated that they agree or extremely agree that they liked the

color scheme, fonts, photos, and videos. This was only partially 
supported by student participants’ qualitative feedback, with the 
majority  of  suggestions  for  app  improvement  relation  to  app 
navigation and design (n = 8)3. Student participants also reported 
finding  the  app  questions  were  too  easy  (n  =  6)  and  reporting 
being able to answer them correctly without watching the videos. 
They suggested increasing the difficulty of the questions in future 
versions. Around 27% of students did not enjoy challenges within 
the  app,  indicating  that  some  work  is  required  to  improve  the 
challenges (see Table 7 for more details). Social anxiety group 
usability. Participants with SAD found +Connect to be a usable 
smartphone  application  as  indicated  by  100%  of  participants 
rating  that  they  agree  or  extremely  agree  that  +Connect  was 
easy to navigate, the format made sense, and that the language 
was easy to understand. Furthermore, 62.50% to 87.50% of the 
participants  rated  that  they  agree  or  extremely  agree  that  they 
liked the color scheme, fonts, photos, and videos. The qualitative 
feedback  of  the  participants  with  SAD  mirrored  that  of  the 
student participants in conflicting with the quantitative results; 
five  participants  with  SAD  suggested  improvements  in  app 
navigation and design, and five reported that the app questions 
were too easy. Similar to students, those with SAD did not find 
challenges  particularly  enjoyable.  Furthermore,  almost  50%  of 
those with SAD reported that they did not find the badge reward 
scheduling  system  encourage  participation,  suggesting  that  a 
different reward schedule either by item or reward schedules will 
need to be revised (see Table 8 for more details).

DISCUSSION

Key Findings
+Connect  is  a  digital  intervention  designed  to  target  loneliness 
in  young  people.  Because  loneliness  is  more  related  to  the 
quality  of  relationships  as  opposed  to  quantity,  we  employed  a 
positive psychology approach to help young people identify their 
strengths, increase their positive affect, and focus on building the 
intimacy within existing relationships. We piloted the tool in both 
lonely young people with and without social anxiety disorder.

Overall, we found higher acceptability ratings across different 
ratings  (e.g.,  ease  of  understanding,  enjoyment  in  life)  in  a 
nonclinical  lonely  student  group  compared  with  those  with 
SAD, i.e., > 70% in the student group vs 50% in the SAD group 
reported  higher  than  somewhat  in  their  satisfaction  ratings. 
Specifically, those with SAD reported that they did not feel that 
+Connect  helped  them  create  new  relationships  or  increase 
social  confidence.  While  +Connect  was  not  intended  to  create 
new relationships (rather the focus is on increasing the quality of 
existing relationships), it is important to consider modifying the 
app to assist young people with SAD because social interactions, 
including  those  suggested  within  the  app,  are  likely  to  be 
significantly more difficult for them.

3Further  app  design  feedback  primarily  focused  on  app  design  and  navigation, 
additional content, additional notifications, increased login flexibility, gamification, 
and additional opportunities for social interaction. A list of participant improvement 
suggestions is provided in Supplementary Table 4.

In  the  qualitative  interview,  at  least  four  participants 
with  SAD  reported  that  they  preferred  actor  videos  over 
shared  experience  videos  even  though  87.5%  of  the  group 
rated  the  shared  experience  videos  as  somewhat  useful  (see 
Supplementary  Table  4  for  more  details).  All  students  found 
the  shared  experience  videos  more  than  somewhat  useful  and 
enjoyable. While previous studies that have found that content 
featuring  people  with  lived  experiences  is  highly  acceptable 
to  mental  health  consumers  with  similar  experiences  (49,  63), 
our  findings  also  indicate  that  shared  experience  videos  may 
also be useful for those without a mental illness, as long as the 
experience  being  portrayed  is  shared  (in  this  case,  loneliness). 
Expert  videos  (i.e.,  academics  speaking  to  the  audience)  were 
the  least  enjoyable,  which  suggest  that  videos  that  provided 
either background or summary information should be relayed in 
a more youth-friendly format. Focus groups with young people 
with  or  without  a  mental  disorder  have  already  been  engaged 
in  the  next  iteration  and  have  given  feedback  on  how  to  relay 
seemingly  useful  but  mundane  information  within  animated 
videos instead of messages from video-recorded experts.

One  strength  of  this  study  was  the  ability  to  triangulate 
qualitative  and  quantitative  data  to  deepen  our  understanding 
of  participants’  experiences  using  the  app.  For  example,  while 
satisfaction ratings for different video types would suggest that, 
overall, both participant groups preferred the shared experience 
videos,  the  in-depth  interview  data  suggests  that  participants 
with  SAD  were  split  almost  equally  on  their  preference  for 
shared  experience  or  actor  videos,  while  student  participants 
were split almost equally between shared experience, actor, and 
expert videos. Further, their feedback provided a more nuanced 
understanding  of  the  differences  in  video  scores  for  “useful” 
versus  “enjoyable.”  Participants  seemed  to  prefer  actor  videos 
based on the quality of the learning experience (i.e., usefulness), 
despite reporting them as less enjoyable. This suggests that useful 
content is more important to users than enjoyable content.

Uptake of the app was 91% and 87%, respectively, for students 
and those with SAD. While uptake was high for both groups, the 
SAD group had a higher attrition rate of 30.76% compared with 
half of that with those with no mental health disorders at 15.38%. 
However,  for  those  who  were  retained,  both  groups  completed 
more  than  70%  of  the  program.  While  the  consumer-focused 
guidance  within  its  development  phase  may  have  contributed 
to  both  acceptability  and  feasibility  ratings,  these  findings 
suggest that clinicians and researchers have to think more deeply 
about  how  to  engage  those  with  SAD  in  digital  interventions. 
Fortunately, +Connect was assessed to be safe for young people 
with  or  without  SAD.  While  the  study  was  underpowered  to 
determine  any  meaningful  difference  pre-post,  the  evidence  of 
a generally positive effect in quantitative ratings was consistent 
with qualitative data. No participant reported negative outcomes, 
and  positive  outcomes  were  driven  by  reflection,  learning,  and 
real-life  application  processes.  In  our  exploratory  analyses,  we 
found that +Connect was more likely to benefit, or at least not 
cause any harm, to young people.

In order to ensure that feedback from this proof-of-concept 
trial can enhance the participant’s experience in future versions, 
we  assessed  its  usability,  and  results  indicated  that  participants

found  its  format  easy  to  navigate  and  the  language  easy  to 
understand.  Challenges  presented  in  the  app,  however,  may 
appear  overwhelming  for  both  groups,  in  that  challenges  were 
perceived  as  either  time  consuming  or  effortful.  Furthermore, 

the  current  badge  gamification  system  may  require  further 
revision, to encourage participation, with a participant with SAD 
suggesting changing reward schedules and a student noting that 
it was not motivating enough.

Loneliness and Digital Intervention

Study Limitations and Future Directions
First,  this  study  is  statistically  underpowered  to  determine  the 
significant effects of pre-post intervention. However, our findings 
are supported by qualitative data that will assist in revising the 
app  for  use  in  a  well-powered  randomized  control  trial.  There 
were several reasons related to the small N, which contributed to 
poor recruitment of young people with SAD: 1) there was change 
in  management  and  clinician  turnover  at  the  recruitment  site; 
2) young people with SAD were particularly difficult to recruit, 
plausibly due to a high social avoidance of services.

Second,  it  is  important  to  take  into  account  that  many 
research  studies  offer  reimbursement  to  offset  any  potential 
costs  the  participant  may  incur  during  the  study.  In  this 
case,  participants  were  reimbursed  to  offset  potential  costs 
when  logging  into  the  app  outside  WIFI  networks.  While  the 
completion of this program (84.66% to 90.26%) was high, it is 
unclear whether engagement with +Connect would be different 
in “real-world” settings.

Last,  +Connect  is  merely  a  tool  to  deliver  information 
to  young  people.  A  more  tailored  approach  to  assist  young 
people to translate these skills to real life may be required for 
at  least  some  young  people.  Such  an  approach  may  involve 
more  clinician  or  peer  interaction  within  safe  and  moderated 
chatrooms. Alternatively, the app might ask users for feedback 
about  challenges,  leading  to  a  more  titrated,  multi-step 
approach for participants who rate challenges as unachievable 
for them. A more tailored approach may be especially helpful 
for young people who are lonely, with co-occurring mental ill 
health  or  clinical  mental  disorders.  Feedback  taken  from  this 
proof-of-concept app can be used to develop a second iterative 
version, with a  focus  on  increasing therapeutic  outcomes  and 
improving engagement.

Conclusion
Our  proof-of-concept  app  +Connect  was  developed  with  an 
aim  of  addressing  loneliness  severity  in  young  people.  The 
development involved consumers aged 18 to 25 with or without 
a  mental  health  disorder.  In  this  pilot  mixed  methods  study, 
we  focused  on  pilot  primary  outcomes  such  as  acceptability, 
feasibility, and safety; next, we explored the potential outcomes 
of  the  pilot.  Our  findings  suggest  that  those  with  SAD  may 
benefit  from  such  interventions  but  may  require  more  tailored 
support  within  the  app  in  order  to  address  attrition.  Together 
with quantitative and qualitative data, there is a rationale to do 

further  work  such  as  modifying  +Connect  and  examining  its 
effectiveness within a pilot randomized controlled trial.
