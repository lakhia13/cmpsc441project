Abstract

Background: This project studies the effect of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) following
Attention Bias Modification (ABM) on residual symptoms in recurrent depression. ACT is a cognitive-behavioral
intervention combining acceptance and mindfulness processes with commitment and behavior-change processes.
ACT enjoys modest empirical support in treating depression and has also shown promising results in secondary
prevention of depression. The experimental cognitive bias modification (ABM) procedure has been shown to reduce
surrogate markers of depression vulnerability in patients in remission from depression. The aim of the current project is
to investigate if the effect of group-based ACT on reducing residual depressive symptoms can be enhanced by
preceding it with ABM. Also, assessment of the relationship between conceptually relevant therapeutic processes and
outcome will be investigated.
Methods/design: An invitation to participate in this project was extended to 120 individuals within a larger sample
who had just completed a separate randomized, multisite, clinical trial (referred to hereafter as Phase 1) in which they
received either ABM (n = 60) or a control condition without bias modification (n = 60). This larger Phase-1 sample
consisted of 220 persons with a history of at least two episodes of major depression who were currently in remission
or not fulfilling the criteria of major depression. After its inclusion, Phase-1 participants from the Sørlandet site (n = 120)
were also recruited for this study in which they received an 8-week group-based ACT intervention. Measures will be
taken immediately after Phase 1, 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the conclusion of Phase 1.

Discussion: This study sequentially combines acceptable, nondrug interventions from neuropsychology and cognitive-
behavioral psychology in treating residual symptoms in depression. The results will provide information about the
effectiveness of treatment and on mechanisms and processes of change that may be valuable in understanding and
further developing ABM and ACT, combined and alone.

Background
Depression is a condition that affects many individuals
in adverse ways. The World Health Organization Global
Burden of Disease Study ranked depression as the single
most burdensome disease in the world in terms of total
disability-adjusted years among people in the middle
years of
life [1]. Although many new approaches to
treating depression have been developed, efficacy for
both pharmacological [2] and psychological
interven-
tions [3] is still unsatisfying.

Depression is also a highly recurrent disorder. More
than 75% of patients diagnosed with major depressive
disorder (MDD) experience more than one episode,
often relapsing within 2 years of recovery [4]. National
Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence [5] has identi-
fied secondary prevention as a key goal in the long-term
management of depression. Its high recurrence rate sug-
gests specific vulnerability factors that increase risk for
developing repeated episodes of MDD. Preventive strat-
egies that identify and ameliorate these factors ostensibly
could reduce risk of subsequent episodes [6].

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the phe-
nomena of depression and its efficacious treatment, mul-
tiple perspectives and angles may be necessary [7]. In a
recent article, Beck and Bredemeier [7] proposed a more
unified model of depression, integrating clinical, cogni-
tive, biological and evolutionary perspectives for treating
and preventing depression. Consistent with this recom-
mendation, this project evaluates the impact in reducing
residual symptoms in depression of group-based Accept-
ance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) following Atten-
tion Bias Modification (ABM). ACT has been recognized
as an efficacious treatment for depression and has also
shown promising results in the secondary prevention of
depression (e.g., [8–12]). The experimental cognitive bias
modification (ABM) procedure has been shown to re-
duce surrogate markers of depression vulnerability in pa-
tients in remission from depression [13].

The current project is an offshoot of a larger random-
ized controlled, double-blinded clinical trial (i.e., Phase
1) with an outpatient population with a history of de-
pression (NCT02658682). The original NCT investigated
symptom changes after 2 weeks of ABM training. The
current trial will investigate the effect on reducing re-
sidual symptoms in depression of preceding group-
based ACT with ABM.

Attention Bias Modification
The cognitive model of depression is an empirically
based framework for identifying and understanding fac-
tors that maintain an episode of depression [14].

Within this model, biased attention is believed to play
a key role in maintaining depression by fuelling negative
thoughts and feelings. Such effects have been shown

using a dot-probe paradigm where participants are
presented with pairs of stimuli, typically words or faces,
consisting of one neutral stimulus and one emotional
stimulus. After the offset of each pair, a dot probe
appears in the location of either the neutral or the
emotional stimulus with allocation of attention mea-
sured by latency in detecting it. Participants orienting
selectively toward the emotional stimulus will be faster
to detect dot probes that replace that stimulus (where
they are already attending) and slower to detect probes
that replace the neutral stimulus. For example,
it has
been demonstrated that clinically depressed subjects
orient attention toward sad faces rather than neutral or
positive faces [15]. A bias towards sad faces has also
been reported in previously depressed, currently euthy-
mic subjects [16], and in never-depressed individuals at
high risk because of a family history [17]. In our own
research group we have shown similar effects in healthy
subjects at genetic risk [18]. Together these results
suggest that negative cognitive biases may constitute
important vulnerability factors for depression, rather
than simple markers of lowered mood.

The Attentional Bias Modification procedure
Selective biases in attention can be modified by a simple
computerized technique; the Attention Bias Modifica-
tion task (ABM), pioneered by Colin MacLeod et al.
[19], was originally developed to test the critical hypoth-
esis that attention bias towards negative emotional infor-
mation plays a causal role in depression and anxiety
[19]. The current approach uses a variant of the dot-
probe task, which encourages patients to orient atten-
tion towards positive rather
than negative stimuli,
through an implicit association between the valence of
the stimulus and the location of the probe. If the probe
appears in the location of the positive stimulus (in 80%
of the trials), a habit of automatically directing attention
toward positive stimuli
i.e., the subject
develops a positive attention bias. This manipulation can
be compared to a neutral (“placebo”) condition in which
the probe appears equally often behind the positive and
negative stimuli, without affecting attention bias Fig. 1.

is encouraged;

There has been a growing interest in ABM research
[20]. Unfortunately, some projects have been limited by
small sample sizes and poor trial methodology [20–23].
While overall
findings have been mixed, studies that
have found measurable positive changes in emotional
biases with ABM, have also reported associated changes
in clinical symptoms [13, 24, 25]. For example, a recent
small-scale study from the research group of Harmer
revealed that alteration of attention bias using the ABM
technique causally influenced residual symptoms and
the cortisol awakening response [13].

remaining focused on what one wants life to be about
both now, and in the future. Another process contribut-
ing to psychological flexibility that ACT addresses, that
would appear to be of greater relevance for the ration-
ale of this study, is that of present-moment awareness.
To somewhat varying degrees and via differing means,
ACT protocols seek to strengthen mindfulness in a
manner consistent with that of Jon Kabat-Zinn [33] as
“paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the
present moment, nonjudgmentally” (p. 4). Depressed
clients are encouraged to “just notice” with an accept-
ing attitude thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations
that might otherwise be responded to in a ruminative
and experientially avoidant manner.

The ACT model of depression
From an ACT point of view, depression is a secondary
emotion that emerges from unsuccessful efforts to
experientially control sadness and disappointment as
normal and adaptive emotional reactions to distressing
life events [26]. In effect, sadness that is not toxic or
psychologically unhealthy per se, may be transformed
into clinical depression. Rather than targeting changes in
the thinking of those who struggle with depression, ACT
seeks to change how they respond or relate to their
thoughts. For example, thoughts like “I don’t deserve to
be loved” may often lead to social isolation. Instead of
changing the
thought, ACT through mindfulness,
acceptance, and defusion strategies seeks to minimize its
impact as a barrier to psychological flexibility. In depres-
sion there is often a reduction in pleasurable and task-
oriented activities [14]. From an ACT perspective, it is
not an increase in activity levels by itself that is most
important. It is rather exploring and clarifying values,
and exemplifying psychological flexibility by committed
actions coherent with values in multiple life areas [9].
Consistent with this formulation, Plumb, Hayes, Hildeb-
randt and Martin [34] found an association between de-
pression and lack of valued action.

Combining ACT and ABM to reduce the likelihood of
recurrence of depression
The overarching hypothesis of this project is that be-
cause both ABM and ACT seek to increase attentional
flexibility, albeit in differing ways and perhaps to differ-
ing degrees, they are likely to complement each other.
Accordingly, participants who receive sequentially both
treatments generally are expected to demonstrate greater
benefits than those who only receive ACT. In a special
issue on ABM, Koster and Bernstein suggests that com-
bining ABM and clinical treatment might give a better
outcome than “stand-alone” treatment [35].

A positive attentional bias established and maintained
through ABM should reduce the degree to which

combines
acceptance and mindfulness processes, with commit-
ment and behavior-change processes. ACT is a trans-
diagnostic model that focuses on pathogenic processes
that are hypothesized to be common in different forms
of human suffering [26]. The main goal in ACT is to
foster psychological flexibility, which is defined as “the
ability to contact the present moment more fully as a
conscious human being and to change, or persist in,
behavior when doing so serves valued ends” ([27], p. 7).
Psychological flexibility has shown to be associated with
higher life satisfaction, emotional well-being, job per-
formance, and job satisfaction [28–31]. Because ACT
focuses on promoting psychological flexibility, rather
than removing psychopathology, ACT is hypothesized

strengthened through the six core processes of (1) ac-
ceptance, (2) defusion, (3) self as context, (4) commit-
ted action, (5) values, and (6) contact with the present
moment [32]. Of these six process, acceptance has re-
ceived the most attention. Correlational and experi-
mental evidence indicates that experiential avoidance,
as the converse of acceptance, contributes to the devel-
opment and maintenance of different psychological and
behavioral problems [32]. A basic tenet of ACT is that
by nurturing and developing a more accepting and psy-
chologically flexible stance makes it possible to remain

negatively valenced stimuli (whether they be sad faces
or unwanted thoughts and feelings) become the focus
of present-moment awareness. If successful, ABM,
in
effect, should thus result in less attentional material
that is subject to rumination. However, ABM alone
does not address how individuals may continue to
process and react to negatively valenced material that is
attended to in a judgmental way. To the extent that ACT
complements ABM, it may primarily do so through its
emphasis on mindfulness. In short, individuals who re-
ceive both ABM and ACT may be less likely to (1) even
be aware of stimuli and events that might otherwise trig-
ger rumination and (2) to be more accepting of that which
is still noticed. Studies have found that both ABM and
mindfulness-based treatments (of which ACT is an
example) may cause neuroplastic changes in the brain re-
gions associated with attention, emotion and self-
awareness [24, 36–39]. The changes that ABM might
bring forward could predict a boost to ACT treatment.

Another lens through which ABM and ACT could be
seen as complementing each other entails multilevels of
cognitive processing. ABM could be thought to involve
“lower-order” cognitive processes incorporating implicit
attention without the involvement of apparent language
or cultural-based processes. ACT, on the other hand,
implicates more “higher-order” cognitive processes. Some-
what relatedly, Skinner’s distinction between contingency-
shaped (ABM) and rule-governed behavior (ACT) [40]
may also be useful in considering how ABM and ACT
could work together. ABM targets contingency-shaped
behavior. In the dot-probe paradigm attention under the
discriminative control of positive stimuli
is shaped to
establish a positive bias. Once established at sufficient
strength, selective attending may be maintained by its nat-
urally reinforcing consequences. In contrast to ABM,
ACT is more concerned with rule-governed behavior.
Mindfulness instruction and practices in ACT can be
viewed as efforts to increase attentional
flexibility by
bringing certain facets of present moment awareness
under more deliberate control. However, unlike in ABM,
the agenda is less on shifting from what is attended to, to
that of altering how whatever is noticed is attended to in a
less judgmental and more accepting manner.

Hypotheses
This study has the following hypothesis;

1. Group-based ACT will reduce residual symptoms of
depression when compared to patients not receiving
group-based ACT

from depression when compared to patients not
receiving group-based ACT

3. Group-based ACT preceded by ABM will have

greater effect on reduction of residual symptoms
than group-based ACT proceeded by sham ABM
4. The absolute and relative reductions in episodes of

low-mood among those receiving group-based ACT
will be maintained over a 12-month follow-up period
5. Increased valued living and mindfulness skills as well
as decreased scores on perceived stress, experiential
avoidance, automatic thoughts and cognitive fusion,
alone or in combination, will significantly mediate
reductions in depressive symptoms in group-based
ACT

Methods/design
Overview of study design
Figure 2 illustrates the design of the study. Former
depressed participants and those in remission (n = 220)
will initially be randomized in Phase 1 to receive either
ABM or a control condition without bias modification.
All participants recruited at Sørlandet (n = 120), half of
whom will have just received ABM, will next receive an
8-week, group-based ACT intervention. The dependent
variables are residual symptoms of depression, cognitive,
neurobiological, and emotional markers of vulnerability,
as well as frequency of major depressive episodes over a
12-month follow-up. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol
Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) for
this research is available in Additional file 1.

Participants
Participants with a history of major depression will be
recruited by referrals. While referrals are accepted from
any source, the majority are expected to come from local
hospitals, regular general practitioners, and self-referrals.
The age of the participants will range from 18 to 65 years.
Diagnostic assessment and evaluation of remission will be
made in accordance with the structured clinical interviews
for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria (The Mini Inter-
national Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)) [41].

Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria are as follows:

1. Participants with a history of major depression,

currently in remission

2. Aged between 18 and 65 years

2. Group-based ACT will reduce cognitive,

Sample size and power
An earlier preliminary study using the same ABM
procedure [13] found a relatively high effect on the
measure of residual symptoms (Hedges’ g = 1.32).
Based on former group-based ACT interventions, we
expect an effect above d = 0.50 on measures of re-
sidual symptoms [42]. We have no relevant studies
that can guide our expectations when it comes to the
sequential combination of ABM and ACT compared
to ACT alone. However, we hypothesize that the com-

interventions. Statistical power
using G*Power [43] indicates that with an α-level at
0.05 and, a β-level at 0.10, the total sample size in a
design like this should be 206 to detect differences in
the main and interaction effects of a moderate to
medium effect size, f = 0.25, with a one-two-way ana-
lysis of variance (ANOVA). We plan to recruit 220
participants in total, which allows for some attrition
before the power will be reduced.

Fig. 4 Overview of measures

The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) [44] con-
sists of 21 items, and is a strong measure of depressive
severity. The Norwegian version of the BDI-II displays
high internal consistency, and acceptable convergent
and discriminative validity [45].

The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRDS)
[46, 47] is a widely used semi-structured clinical inter-
view measuring the severity of depressive symptomatol-
ogy covering a range of affective, behavioral and
biological symptoms. The HDRS-17 has acceptable psy-
chometric properties [48]. The clinical
interview has
been conducted blindly and reliably.

Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes
following:

are

as

(cid:1) Recurrence of major depressive episodes

Measured by the MINI structured interview [41] 12
months after baseline

(cid:1) Changes in symptoms of anxiety

Change in symptoms of anxiety as measured by the
21-item Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [49]. The BAI
has been found to have high internal consistency
and has shown good convergent and divergent
validity [50, 51]

(cid:1) Changes in quality of life

Quality in life is measured by the WHO Quality
of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) [52, 53], which is
a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100
assessment. With satisfactory psychometric
properties [52, 53]

(cid:1) Flourishing

There is increasing interest in investigating what
promotes positive mental health and well-being as
a continuum, separate from, albeit related to,
mental illness. Flourishing is a term describing
subjective well-being [54] which has been
operationalized as encompassing facets of (1)
emotional, (2) psychological, and (3) social well-
being ([55], p. 99). The study uses The Mental
Health Continuum – Short Form (MHC-SF) [55],

which has been found to have good psychometric
properties [55], to measure these three main
dimensions of well-being

(cid:1) Early morning cortisol response

It is well established that dysfunction of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with
elevated plasma cortisol levels is characteristic of
MDD [56]. Increased secretion of cortisol has also
been reported to be present in depressed subjects
after clinical recovery [57], and has been
suggested to be a vulnerability marker. This study
will collect early morning cortisol response, as a
natural neuroendocrine challenge test to assess
the hypothesis that reduced HPA activity will be
a surrogate marker of residual symptoms and thus
relapse prevention following ABM and ACT.

Mediator measures The following measures assess po-
tential mediators of change in the interventions. These
are psychological variables that are specifically targeted
by ACT and that are thought to promote psychological
flexibility and mental health functioning:

(cid:1) Acceptance

Acceptance is measured by the Acceptance and
Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) [58]. AAQ-II has
been found to have acceptable structure, reliability,
and validity [58]

(cid:1) Values

Value-congruent behavior is measured by using
Bull’s Eye [59]. Bull’s Eye is a process and outcome
measure for treatments that include value-based
components. It has shown good temporal stability
and has many properties supporting its construct
validity [59]
(cid:1) Engaged living

Engaged living is a term that is used to describe ways
in which valued life activities are pursued [60]. Engaged
Living Scale (ELS) [61] is a newly developed measure
that addresses the processes of values and committed

Østergaard et al. Trials  (2018) 19:203

action from the framework of ACT. A study by
Trompetter et al. [61] found ELS to be a valid and
reliable measure of an engaged response style

(cid:1) Mindfulness

Present-moment awareness and acceptance are
two key components of mindfulness. These two
key constituents will be measured by the
Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS) [62].
The psychometric evidence suggests that PHLMS
is a good measure for present-moment awareness
and acceptance [62]

(cid:1) Cognitive fusion

Cognitive fusion is central process in the ACT
model. Cognitive fusion is measured by the
Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ) [63] which
has good psychometric properties based on
preliminary findings [63]

(cid:1) Psychological stress

Psychological stress is measured by The Perceived
Stress Scale (PSS) [64] which has been found to
have acceptable psychometric properties [65]

(cid:1) Automatic thoughts

Frequency of negative automatic thoughts is
measured with the Automatic Thoughts
Questionnaire (ATQ-30) [66]. The Norwegian version
of the ATQ has been found to have adequate
reliability and validity properties [67]

(cid:1) Other cognitive measures

Because ABM involves some general cognitive control
functions, a measure of basic inhibitory control and
mental flexibility will be included; i.e., the Stroop
Color Naming Task (D-KEFS; [68]) Fig. 4

Moderators This study will look for possible moderators
of therapeutic improvements and relapse; the analyses
will, however, be exploratory. These include:
level of
depression, number of previous depressive episodes, co-
morbidity, level of education and medication.

Data analysis
The primary analyses will follow an intention-to-treat
approach using mixed models [69]. To investigate poten-
tial confounding variables, comparison conditions will
be evaluated for any pre-treatment differences in vari-
ables (e.g., gender) and levels of depression using a t test.
Any such differences will subsequently be treated as co-
variates (e.g., level of depression) or be included as vari-
ables (e.g., gender) within the primary analyses.

To accommodate missing data, mixed models, which
involve randomly deleting missing observations without
dropping participants, will be used where appropriate in
conducting primary analyses [70]. Multiple regressions
will be considered to explore potential moderators, and
how acceptance, values, engaged living, mindfulness,

cognitive fusion, psychological stress and automatic
thoughts mediate outcome [71].

Therapists and treatment adherence
The ACT group treatment is delivered by clinical psychol-
ogists who are trained and have experience in ACT. Ther-
apists will be supervised by experienced ACT therapists,
Professor Robert Zettle and PhD Tobias Lundgren. The
therapists will meet regularly to review and reflect on
treatment procedures and group processes. A manual for
ACT group treatment in Norwegian has been developed
to enhance treatment compliance and is available upon
request. Treatment adherence is investigated by independ-
ent ACT researchers. Sessions are video-recorded with
the consent of all the participants and knowledgeable
ACT researchers that are not involved the treatment
groups will check for adherence by randomly reviewing
parts of sessions.

under the most positive stimulus (out of the two examples) on 80% of trials, therefore encouraging increased attention to the positive cues

flexibility and mindfulness, which ACT identifies as es-
sential in developing an engaging and meaningful life.
An important treatment target is experiential avoidance,
which is thought to “function as a core psychological di-
athesis underlying the development and maintenance of
several forms of psychopathology” ([72], p. 369). The
intervention aims at increasing experiential acceptance,
which is a posture that reflects openness to both aversive
and pleasant experiences, as an alternative to experien-
tial avoidance. Mindfulness exercises are used in every
meeting as an exercise to become present and focused
in observing what takes place in the present. Each meet-
ing is ended by reviewing what participants are encour-
aged to practice or reflect on until the next session.
Emphasis is placed not on how well they do the exer-
cises that are important, or if they do them at all for that
matter, but on their experiences and their observations.
Each group of 8–12 participants will receive eight
weekly sessions of ACT:

(cid:1) First meeting

The first meeting provides an introduction to the
central components of ACT and seeks to create an
atmosphere of safety, trust, openness and willingness
for participants. The objective is to ready for the
journey we as a group are to undertake together.
This journey involves inviting and making room for
difficult emotions and thoughts, in order to focus on
what participants want their lives to be about. An
engaging and flexible contact with emotions and
thoughts has the potential of providing valuable
information about oneself, and, furthermore, of
releasing energy that previously would be used to try
to contain these difficult emotions and feelings. For
most of the participants, this perspective represents
a shift of paradigms

(cid:1) Second meeting

The second meeting has acceptance as a headline,
and participants are early on invited into a process

of reflection. Acceptance is introduced as an
alternative to controlling and avoiding unwanted
thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Metaphors and
exercises are used to create several experiential
examples of acceptance. To make acceptance
personally relevant participants are challenged to
share personal examples with the group that
underscores the workability of acceptance versus
avoidance
(cid:1) Third meeting

The third meeting has values as a headline.
Participants are invited to reflect on what is, and
what could be, important and meaningful in their
lives. Some perspectives on values are introduced,
but not in the sense that we as group leaders
have the power of definition. Rather, participants
are invited to share their own viewpoints to co-
create what values mean, and to make them per-
sonally relevant. The connection between accept-
ance and values is made more explicit and
exemplified. Values are often nonverbal (implicit),
and this meeting seeks to start the process of
identifying values and making them more explicit

(cid:1) Fourth meeting

The fourth meeting has defusion as a headline.
Defusion is a process of being able to create some
distance between ourselves and unwanted
psychological experiences in the service of doing
what is important, valuable, and meaningful. The
process is highlighted by reflecting on how stories
about ourselves affect us. The participants engage in
exercises designed to increase awareness of the kind
of life stories they construct and choose to represent
themselves. The life story is then challenged and
deconstructed
(cid:1) Fifth meeting

Headlines for the day are actions and engagement.
Participants are introduced to the notion that
people’s lives can be usefully divided into four

Østergaard et al. Trials  (2018) 19:203

different central areas or domains: (1) relationships,
(2) education and work, (3) health and personal
development, and (4) spare time. The remaining
meetings will examine participant goals and
aspirations in a different life area each time. In this
meeting, participants are challenged to select a focus
important to them within the broader domain of
relationships (e.g., being a loving spouse), and
choose congruent short- and long-term goals.
Participants are encouraged to set small goals and
plan concrete small actions that would bring them a
step closer to their values

(cid:1) Sixth meeting

The theme for this day is the observing self, which
describes a transcending perspective that emerges
from noticing our on-going stream of both internal
and external experiences. It can be thought of as an
invariant vantage point from which we can notice
that we notice and see that we see. The observing
self explicitly builds around the capacity to see
ourselves having thoughts and feelings while not
being defined by them. The work with value-based
actions continues in the domain of health and
personal development

(cid:1) Seventh meeting

Headline for the seventh day is self-compassion,
which is the capacity to direct kindness and warmth
towards yourself and your inner experiences. In this
meeting value-based actions are explored within the
area of work and education

(cid:1) Eight meeting

The eighth session features summarizing and
strengthening constructive processes that have been
initiated and activated in earlier meetings.
Participants are also challenged to investigate and
choose value-based actions in the life domain of
spare time. An important theme is how to continue
the work of developing, exploring, and internalizing
the processes that have been most helpful for them

Discussion
Depression is a highly recurrent disorder, and pharmaco-
therapy is largely used as an aid to prevent relapse.
However, many patients do not wish to use long-term
drug treatment and psychological interventions are often
a preferred option. Recent evidence suggests that rela-
tively automatic training using ABM can prevent some
markers of relapse in formerly depressed patients. ACT
has shown promising results in secondary prevention for
other patient groups, and is recognized as an empirically
supported treatment for depression.

The sequential presentation of these two treatments can
be viewed as somewhat controversial as they come from
quite different scientific and philosophical traditions. ACT

originates from cognitive-behavioral psychology, while
ABM originates from neuroscience. Both treatments have
had promising effect on depression separately, but their
combination has not been investigated before.

While psychological interventions may often be offered in
conjunction with antidepressant medication, they are sel-
dom combined with each other. If psychological approaches
are combined they are often closely interrelated theoretically
and philosophically; unlike ACT and ABM. Paradoxically
this may also be why ACT and ABM may work well
together. The two treatments both can be seen as targeting
attentional processes, but on different levels cognitively,
theoretically, and philosophically.

This project

takes place in a “real-world” clinical
setting, where patients have varied history, backgrounds
and challenges. ABM and group-based ACT represent
two cost-effective and easily accessible treatments. If
combining these two treatments should prove effective,
it could represent an interesting opportunity for patients
with recurrent depression, and a shift in perception of
combining two quite different treatments. To our know-
ledge there has been one other study where the effect of
combining ABM with regular treatment was investi-
gated. Salemink et al. conducted a small randomized
cognitive-
study,
behavioral therapy (CBT) with ABM, finding that ABM-
augmented CBT treatment
adolescents with
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [73]. Additional
and larger studies are needed to investigate whether
these findings can be replicated. The current ABM and
ACT project will hopefully contribute to increasing the
understanding of mechanisms in ABM and ACT, and
the clinical impact of combining the two.
