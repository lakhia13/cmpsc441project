Abstract: Depression is a mental health disorder that develops as a result of complex psycho-neuro-
immuno-endocrinological disturbances. This disease presents with mood disturbances, persistent
sadness, loss of interest and impaired cognition, which causes distress to the patient and signiﬁcantly
affects the ability to function and have a satisfying family, social and professional life. Depression
requires comprehensive management, including pharmacological treatment. Because pharmacother-
apy of depression is a long-term process associated with the risk of numerous adverse drug effects,
much attention is paid to alternative therapy methods, including phytopharmacotherapy, especially
in treating mild or moderate depression. Preclinical studies and previous clinical studies conﬁrm
the antidepressant activity of active compounds in plants, such as St. John’s wort, saffron crocus,
lemon balm and lavender, or less known in European ethnopharmacology, roseroot, ginkgo, Korean
ginseng, borage, brahmi, mimosa tree and magnolia bark. The active compounds in these plants
exert antidepressive effects in similar mechanisms to those found in synthetic antidepressants. The
description of phytopharmacodynamics includes inhibiting monoamine reuptake and monoamine
oxidase activity and complex, agonistic or antagonistic effects on multiple central nervous system
(CNS) receptors. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the anti-inﬂammatory effect is also important to the
antidepressant activity of the plants mentioned above in light of the hypothesis that immunological
disorders of the CNS are a signiﬁcant pathogenetic factor of depression. This narrative review results
from a traditional, non-systematic literature review. It brieﬂy discusses the pathophysiology, symp-
tomatology and treatment of depression, with a particular focus on the role of phytopharmacology
in its treatment. It provides the mechanisms of action revealed in experimental studies of active
ingredients isolated from herbal antidepressants and presents the results of selected clinical studies
conﬁrming their antidepressant effectiveness.

Depression is a major mood disorder presenting with a persistent feeling of sadness,
debilitating low mood, impaired cognition and loss of interest. Depression has a profound
effect on the functioning of the affected person, individually, biologically and socially.
Depression involves deep sadness, hopelessness, sorrow, emptiness and despair. Over
time, it may also involve an inability to experience pleasure, psychomotor dysfunction,
changes in sleep and eating behaviours, difﬁculty concentrating and suicidal thoughts [1].
In fact, depression belongs to a heterogeneous group of diseases, broadly included in the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO). The current ICD-11 version distinguishes a few depressive disorders: single
episode depressive disorder (moderate, without psychotic symptoms, or severe, with or
without such symptoms) and recurrent depressive disorder (current episode moderate,
without psychotic symptoms, or severe, with or without such symptoms, or recurrent
depressive disorder currently in full remission, or unspeciﬁed recurrent depressive disor-
der). Moreover, there are other different forms of depression, such as dysthymic disorder
(persistent depressive disorder), mixed depressive and anxiety disorder, other speciﬁed
depressive disorders and unspeciﬁed depression [2].

As presented in this review, depression is currently one of the most important diseases
of civilization and a signiﬁcant public health problem. Therefore, it seems important to
perform a periodic, comprehensive analysis focusing on the description of this disease and
its therapeutic management options, taking into account phytopharmacotherapy, which is
less popular in everyday clinical practice.

This paper aims to brieﬂy summarize the most important issues concerning the epi-
demiology, pathophysiology, symptomatology and treatment of depression. It also dis-
cusses the importance of phytopharmacotherapy in treating this disease and provides an
outline of the phytopharmacodynamics of medicinal plants with antidepressant activity,
with particular emphasis on the importance of their anti-inﬂammatory effect. This narrative
review employs the traditional, non-systematic literature review method (PubMed, Google
Scholar databases) with the use of the following search terms and their combinations:
“depression”, “epidemiology”, “pathophysiology”, “symptomatology”, “management”,
“treatment”, “medicinal plants”, “phytopharmacotherapy”, “phytopharmacodynamics”.
The selection of relevant articles for review based on their titles and abstracts by one au-
thor (LD) was supervised critically by the second author (KG). Both review articles and
original full-text articles were taken into account, preferring search results from the last
ten years, but also including older papers, which, according to the authors, introduced
important information to the discussion. At the same time, the performed literature screen-
ing revealed some papers analogous to our forthcoming review, e.g., Pardhe et al. [3] or
Martins and Brijensh [4] and others. These papers describe the phytopharmacodynamics
of many different plants with antidepressant activity, mostly focusing on their effect on
disturbances of neurotransmission in the CNS found in depression. However, we made ef-
forts to prepare a comprehensive review, discussing phytopharmacotherapy of depression
against the background of a broader introduction to the epidemiology, symptomatology
and pathophysiology of this disease, focusing the description of phytopharmacodynamics
also on other aspects less frequently addressed in other papers, such as the contribution of
the anti-inﬂammatory properties to the antidepressant effect.

2. Epidemiology

According to the WHO (data as of 13 September 2021), depression affects 3.8% of the
world’s population, including 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of adults over 60 years. Approx-
imately 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The disease is a leading
cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of
disease. More women are affected by depression than men [5]. A population-based study
in Europe using data from 27 countries collected between 2013 and 2015 showed that
the overall prevalence of the current depressive disorder is high (6.38%), with important
variation across European countries, ranging from 2.58% in the Czech Republic to 10.33% in
Iceland. Similarly to the WHO data, the study demonstrated higher depression prevalence
in women (7.74%) compared to men (4.89%), with clear gender differences for all countries,
except Finland and Croatia [6]. Estimates for Poland indicate that around 1.5 million people
suffer from depression, and this disease affects approximately 3% of people of productive
age (i.e., 766,000 adult Poles had at least one depressive episode in their lives) [7].

Outside Europe, the prevalence of depression is equally high. According to the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
8.1% of adults aged 18 and over had symptoms of anxiety disorder, 6.5% of depressive
disorder and 10.8% of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder in the USA in 2019 [8]. In
the Asia-Paciﬁc region, the prevalence of 1-month major depression ranged from 1.3% to
5.5%, and rates of major depression ranged from 1.7% to 6.7% [9]. Ogbo et al. estimated
the prevalence of depressive disorders in South Asia as high as 3.9%, 4.4% in Bangladesh,
3.9% in India, 3.0% in Pakistan, 4.0% in Nepal and 3.7% in Bhutan [10]. In Latin America
and the Caribbean, depression affects 5% of the adult population. Moreover, six out of
every ten people do not receive treatment [11]. In South Africa, an estimated 9.8% of the
adult population experience major (clinical) depression at some point in their life [12]. The

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

pooled prevalence of depression among older adults in Africa was estimated to be even
higher, reported at 26.3% [13]. In Australia, 9.4% of males aged 16–85 and 12.8% of females
of the same age experienced a depressive episode in their lives [14].

Thus, it should be concluded that depression is a serious disease of civilization. As
early as 2006, the WHO estimated that depression would cause the second largest increase in
morbidity after cardiovascular diseases and pose a signiﬁcant public health challenge [15].

3. Pathophysiology

There are some biological (including genetic abnormalities, microbiome disturbances,
inﬂammatory factors, stress and dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)
axis and the kynurenine pathway), psychological and social determinants of depression.
Depression may also secondarily develop in the course of many somatic or mental diseases.
In fact, depression, or collectively named depressive disorders, cannot be explained by a
single theory since many variables are involved in the entity’s initiation and sustainment.
This paper does not provide a detailed description of the pathophysiology of depression,
which can be found in numerous reviews on this issue. Only selected aspects of the
pathophysiology of depression are brieﬂy mentioned below.

There are some biological theoretical frameworks for the explanation of the onset of
depression. The most common biochemical, neurophysiological explanation for depression
is the deﬁcit of monoamines (serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine), which play a key role in
important life-regulating functions (appetite, sleep, memory, learning, temperature regula-
tion, social behaviour). The insufﬁciency of these monoamine neuromodulators in deﬁnite
structures of the central nervous system is considered to be responsible for the development
of depression [16]. This monoamine hypothesis of depression was historically the ﬁrst
theory proposed by Joseph Schildkraut in the 1960s and was based on the successful use of
iproniazid (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and imipramine (a monoamine neuromodula-
tor reuptake inhibitor) in the treatment of depression [17–19]. This theory is consistent with
clinical observations—designed tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine neuromodulator
reuptake inhibitors have conﬁrmed the important role of imbalance and neuromodulator
deﬁciency. For many years, the monoamine theory was the basic paradigm setting the
ground rules in the treatment of depression.

Moreover, the stress-induced overactivity of the HPA axis was also revealed to be
involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Signiﬁcant correlations between measures
of stress and depressive behaviour and between cortisol levels and depressive behaviour
were found in experimental studies [20]. Inﬂuencing the HPA axis and reducing its ac-
tivity may become another therapeutic option in treating depression [21]. This direction
seems to be particularly interesting and promising, especially considering the secondary
relationship between the activity of the HPA axis and the gut microbiota. It is believed that
the gut microbiota can inﬂuence the HPA axis function through the activity of cytokines,
prostaglandins or bacterial antigens of various microbial species [22].

Also, both experimental and clinical studies indicate that inﬂammatory processes may

play a causal role in the development of depressive illness.

There is growing evidence that immune system disturbances are involved in the
development of depression. Various immune cytokines released during systemic, “low
grade” and self-sustaining inﬂammation have been found to be implicated in the patho-
physiology of depression, including interleukins (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10;
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ); C-reactive protein (CRP); tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α);
and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) [23,24].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

The peripherally released cytokines may pass the blood–brain barrier, activating glial
cells and leading to a neuroinﬂammatory process contributing to brain damage [24,25].
There is also evidence that central neurotransmission disturbances are associated with
secondary disturbances concerning relevant cytokines, e.g., serotonin deﬁciency, contribut-
ing to the feeling of sadness, guilt and worthlessness and disturbed appetite related to
Il-6, Il-18, TNF-α and CRP abnormalities. Sociability dysfunction, due to lower dopamine
levels, was demonstrated to correlate with the disturbances within INF-γ, Il-17, Il-33 and
CCR6 and impaired functioning of Th1 and Th17 cells. Some symptoms depend on mul-
tiple neurotransmitters, such as psychomotor retardation (manifested by INF-γ, TNF-α,
Il-1β and Il-6 disturbances) regulated by serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and glu-
tamate [26]. It is noteworthy that antidepressant treatment affects the level of cytokines.
A meta-analysis of 32 clinical studies by Wi˛edłocha et al. [27] demonstrated signiﬁcant
decreases in IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in major depressive disorder (MDD) subjects after antide-
pressant treatment. In the case of IL-1ß, the decrease was signiﬁcant exclusively for SSRI
drugs. Moreover, the activation of the kynurenine pathway and reduced tryptophan levels
correlate with inﬂammation-induced depression, as the kynurenine pathway is believed to
precipitate depressive symptoms by depleting brain serotonin [28]. Multiple endogenous
and environmental factors appear to increase the risk of developing depression and seem
to be associated with systemic inﬂammation; these include psychosocial stressors, poor
diet, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, altered gut permeability, atopy, dental caries,
sleep and vitamin D deﬁciency [29]. Oxidative stress (OS) is a supplementary mechanism
involved in the pathophysiology of depression because OS is closely related to the in-
ﬂammatory process. In the course of an inﬂammatory process, positive reciprocal action
is established—inﬂammatory mediators intensify the synthesis of free radicals (mainly
reactive oxygen/nitrogen species), which in turn sustains inﬂammation and the release
of pro-inﬂammatory mediators. The limbic brain regions (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus
and amygdala) involved in mood and behaviour control are highly susceptible to oxidative
damage. Previous studies mention the implication of OS in neurodegenerative and psy-
chiatric disorders, including depression [30,31]. Moreover, excessive and prolonged stress
negatively impacts the immune system, which in turn affects the HPA axis. Both factors
lead to neurological impairments in the brain, causing changes in mood and behaviour [32].
There is also a relationship between systemic inﬂammatory alterations and gut micro-
biota. The gut and brain are two structures connected at multiple levels. The microorgan-
isms inhabiting the gut and their products are essential in this bidirectional communication,
conforming to the microbiota–gut–brain (MGB) axis [33,34]. Depressed patients show sig-
niﬁcant changes to the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) in comparison to healthy patients, leading
to a pro-inﬂammatory status and neuroinﬂammation, enhancing the HPA axis dysfunction
and stress sensitivity in the brain and disrupting the gut–brain communication through the
vagus nerve, hence contributing to the pathogenesis of MDD [35]. In addition, an altered
immune status described in MDD is responsible for an enhanced bacterial translocation in
the bloodstream, aggravating the systemic damage in depressed patients [36]. Moreover,
there is growing evidence of an important role of gut microbiota in the production or degra-
dation of multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine or
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [37], deﬁning the gut microbiota as a critical modulator
of brain activity.

The contribution of reproductive hormones to mood has also been a focus of efforts
to explain the detailed pathophysiology of depression. Recent longitudinal studies have
found that women are more susceptible to higher levels of depressed mood during the
menopausal transition than just before it starts, suggesting differences in the prevalence
of depression in relation to the sex of the patients [38]. In addition, signiﬁcant decreases
in oestrogen production, an overall state of hypogonadism, stability in the hypothalamic–
pituitary–gonadal axis and elevated FSH are marks of menopause. The decreased circulat-
ing androgen levels associated with menopause have also been linked to the loss of libido,
fatigue and an increase in depressive symptoms [39].

Family and twin studies have provided strong evidence for the involvement of genetic
factors in the risk of depression. Twin studies have demonstrated that the heritability rate
of depression is about 37%, and data from family studies indicate a two- to three-fold
increase in the risk of depression in the ﬁrst-degree offspring of depressed patients [40].
Heredity has also been shown to particularly affect severe forms of depression [41].

In most cases of depression, estimates indicate that about 50% of the causes are
genetic, and about 50% are unrelated to genes (psychological or physical factors). Genetic
background is especially suspected in patients whose parent or sibling has suffered from
depression more than once (“recurrent depression”) and if the depression started relatively
early in life (in childhood, teenage years or twenties). However, there is no one “depressive
gene”. Some of the possible genetic causes include the role of polymorphisms in genes
related to the neurotransmission of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, such as
serotonin transporter gene variants that inhibit serotonin reuptake, leading to a deﬁciency
of monoamines in the brain and thus predisposing to depression. Another possibility is a
polymorphism in genes regulating nervous system development, leading to a deﬁciency
in the number of neurons in the adult brain or in genes regulating anti-inﬂammatory
cytokines secreted in a compensatory manner to counteract inﬂammation. Further, genes
that regulate circadian rhythms are another potential cause of genetic predisposition to
depression by interfering with normal sleep and other bodily functions that depend on the
circadian pacemaker.

Furthermore, in terms of genetic abnormalities, there are also links between genetic
factors and depression; for example, abnormalities in brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) appear to play an important role in depression. The “BDNF theory” of depression
results from preclinical studies demonstrating that several forms of stress reduce BDNF-
mediated signalling in the hippocampus, whereas chronic treatment with antidepressants
increases BDNF-mediated signalling. Treatment with antidepressants increases several
growth factors in the hippocampus that inﬂuence neurogenesis. These include BDNF
(which promotes neuronal survival) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [42].
However, there are also studies revealing that male mice with conditional forebrain dele-
tions of BDNF or its receptor do not show depression-like behaviour [43]. Moreover, the
action of BDNF may be brain region dependent—in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
nucleus accumbens (NAc), BDNF exerts a potent pro-depressant effect, and the direct infu-
sion of BDNF into the VTA–NAc increases depression-related behaviours [44]. These results
suggest that the current formulation of the BDNF hypothesis of depression development is
too simplistic. BDNF-mediated signalling is involved in neuroplastic responses to stress
and antidepressants, but these effects are both region- and antidepressant-speciﬁc [42]. In
the neurobiology of depression, at the cellular and molecular levels, a number of signalling
pathways and targets have been suggested as implicated in the pathogenesis of depression,
including the above-mentioned neurotrophic factor and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)
pathways. The functional consequences of these systems in the context of the damaging
effects of chronic stress, including atrophy and loss of neurons and glia, were also observed
in brain imaging and postmortem studies of depressed patients [45].

In addition, there are links between genes of the core region of the tissue compatibility
system, as well as various gene polymorphisms and depression. Single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) of genes involved in the tryptophan catabolism pathway are also being
investigated [46–48].

An important role in the current description of depression is also played by epigenetics,
i.e., the science dealing with inherited changes in gene expression unrelated to changes in
the DNA sequence, examining the mechanisms of interaction between genes and their prod-
ucts in phenotype formation. Thus, epigenetics is the study explaining the cellular control
of gene activity without changing the DNA sequence [49]. Epigenetic mechanisms include
histone acetylation, which changes the structure of chromatin; cytosine methylation in
DNA (in areas rich in the sequence of dinucleotides (cytosine-phosphate group-guanine)),
which prevents gene transcription; and the inﬂuence of the non-coding microRNA binding

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

complementary to mRNA, thus regulating translation [50]. Experimental studies indi-
cate that genetic and environmental risk factors and their interactions induce aberrant
epigenetic mechanisms targeting stress response pathways, neuronal plasticity and other
behaviourally relevant pathways involved in major depression. The role of epigenetics in
depression pathogenesis would explain the differences in the incidence of this disease in
monozygotic twins. The involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in depression pathogenesis
also offers an explanation of largely inconsistent genetic association studies of depression,
for example, by undermining the transcriptional impact of DNA sequence polymorphisms
due to epigenetic modiﬁcations on those gene promoters [42,51].

In addition, growing clinical data indicate that the analysis of epigenetic changes in
patients with depressive disorders can be not only a marker of clinical improvement, but
also a predictor of response to pharmacological treatment. It is suggested that the use of
histone deacetylase inhibitors (natural or synthetic small molecules that can inhibit the
activity of deacetylases and affect the availability of chromatin for transcription factors)
may become a novel method of treating depression and other affective disorders [52].

Finally, the description of the pathophysiology of depression also takes into account
social and psychological issues. According to attachment theory, depression is determined
by a person’s inability to establish strong and long-lasting affective bonds with other people.
The attachment model postulates that vulnerability to depression stems from early experi-
ences that did not meet the child’s need for security, care and comfort, as well as the current
state of their intimate relationships. The links between secure attachment and depression
also appear to be mediated by the development of maladaptive beliefs or schemas [16].
Complex and incompletely understood psychological and social maladjustment can result
in anaclitic depression, which arises from feelings of loneliness and abandonment, and
introjective depression, which stems from a sense of failure and worthlessness [53].

There are also studies focusing on the importance of circadian rhythms and its main
mediator, melatonin, in the onset and development of the disease [54]. Based on this hy-
pothesis, some melatonin receptor agonists (ramelteon, tasimelteon) have been introduced
into clinical practice in the treatment of sleep disturbances, and those acting additionally as
serotonergic antagonists (agomelatine), which display antidepressant properties [55].

To sum up, the pathophysiology of depression is multifactorial, and the treatment of
this mental illness remains a challenge. Many causative, interrelated factors are implicated
in depression pathogenesis, as shown in Figure 1.

To underline its complexity, a “psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrinological” term has
been introduced to describe depression [56]. The main pathomechanisms of depression
have focused on impaired monoamine function, decreased monoamine production, mal-
function of the secondary messenger system or changes in other neurotransmissions. A
signiﬁcant role in the pathogenesis of depression is also attributed to inﬂammation and
oxidative stress, which exert a major inﬂuence, affecting the proper functioning of the brain.
Additional attention has also been given to endocrine abnormalities (excessive cortisol
levels) or impaired neurogenesis through reduced levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic
factor. The role of abnormal circadian rhythm is also highlighted [15].

Figure 1. The main pathomechanisms of depression. The main structures associated with the patho-
genesis of depression are the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system (including the hippocampus
and the amygdala). According to the comprehensive, psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrinological the-
ory of the development of depression, this disease results from the action of multiple exogenous
and endogenous factors. Details are given in the text. (HPA—hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis;
5HT—5-hydroxytryptamine; serotonin; NA—noradrenaline; DA—dopamine).

4. Symptomatology

Depression manifests itself in a variety of both somatic and psychological symptoms.
The disease also has a huge impact on the social and professional functioning of the pa-
tient. The typical psychological symptoms of depression include continuous low mood or
sadness, with a dominant feeling of hopelessness, helplessness and guilt, feeling worried
and/or anxious, poor concentration, lack of motivation to undertake everyday activities
and loss of previous interests. In addition, patients with depression may feel overwhelmed,
restless or angry and lack conﬁdence. The somatic symptoms include sleep abnormalities,
such as insomnia or hypersomnia (many patients experience early morning awakenings;
there are also patients who tend to feel sleepy during the day), changes in appetite or body
weight (usually reduced, but sometimes increased), feelings of low energy or adynamia,
low sex drive (loss of libido), changes in the menstrual cycle and constipation. Social
symptoms of depression include avoiding contact with friends and participating in fewer
social activities; neglecting hobbies and interests; and difﬁculties at home, work or fam-
ily life as a result of chronic emotional disorders affecting the ability to maintain family

contacts and professional activity. Usually, depressive patients may also present altered
behaviour, such as staying in rather than going out and being less productive at school
or work. Depression may also take on an atypical form, manifesting itself by increased
mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to positive events) and increased appetite;
sleeping longer; leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs); and inter-
personal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance), resulting in
signiﬁcant social or occupational impairment [57]. Depending on the number and severity
of the above-mentioned symptoms, depression can be mild, moderate or severe, with
possible suicide attempts. As an aside, it should also be mentioned that depression in
some patients may be “masked”, especially in the form of purely somatic disorders in
the elderly [58–60]. Noteworthy, increased alcohol dependence was demonstrated in the
course of depression—the prevalence of depression among alcohol-dependent persons is
high (estimated at 63.8%) [61].

5. Treatment—Pharmacotherapy and Non-Pharmacological Management
of Depression

The treatment of depression involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological
methods, including, in particular, techniques of therapeutic psychotherapeutic inﬂuence.
The concept of “collaborative care” is the basis for the comprehensive treatment of de-
pression. Psychological therapy should be the main treatment for mild depression or
complementary to pharmacological treatment in other cases. There is strong evidence for
the effectiveness of combined pharmacological antidepressants and cognitive behaviour
therapy over the sole use of antidepressants in moderate to severe depression and chronic
depression [62].

There are several classes of antidepressants used in the pharmacotherapy of this
disorder, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepres-
sants (TCAs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), noradrenaline
reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) and noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs).
These drugs inhibit the transporters responsible for the reuptake of monoamines [63].
There are also other drugs with antidepressant effects (e.g., agomelatine, an MT1 I MT2
melatonin receptor agonist and serotonin 5HT2 receptor antagonist, or mirtazapine, an
antagonist of adrenergic alpha2-autoreceptors, alpha2-heteroreceptors, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3
receptors) [63]. Recent antidepressants include desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, vortioxe-
tine or vilazodone [64]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered by
general practitioners to be ﬁrst-line drugs in the treatment of outpatients with depression.
All antidepressants are regarded to be more effective than a placebo in adults treated for
depression. In a systematic review and meta-analysis by Cipriani et al. [65], agomelatine,
amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine and vortioxetine were
found to be more effective than other antidepressants, while ﬂuoxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, re-
boxetine and trazodone were found to be the least effective. However, larger differences
in the efﬁcacy and acceptability of individual antidepressants were revealed in head-to-
head trials. For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂuoxetine, sertraline
and vortioxetine were better tolerated than other antidepressants, while amitriptyline,
clomipramine, duloxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone and venlafaxine had the
highest dropout rates [65].

Taking into account the clinical picture of depression, the response to initial treatment
and the patient’s comorbidities, a precise choice of medication is made, and the effect of
treatment is assessed after an appropriate period of follow-up. It should be stressed that
antidepressants, like other pharmacological agents, exert some adverse drug reactions
(ADRs). The most common ADRs observed in patients treated with SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine,
sertraline, ﬂuoxetine, escitalopram) at the primary care outpatient clinics were: gastroin-
testinal problems (in 17% of subjects), indigestion (22%), nausea (18%), diarrhoea (9%) and
constipation (11%). Moreover, tiredness (in 45% of subjects), dizziness (24%), hypoten-
sion (15%), headache (34%) and blurred vision (22%) were also reported [66]. SSRIs are

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

generally better tolerated than other antidepressants. The less common ADRs reported
in the literature include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), serotonin syndrome, QT pro-
longation, rash, birth defects, hyponatraemia and cataracts [67]. Tricyclic antidepressants
show more pronounced side effects due to their complex mechanism of action and receptor
non-selectivity. The most common adverse effects include constipation, dizziness and
xerostomia. Due to their cholinolytic potential, TCAs may also produce blurred vision,
constipation, xerostomia, confusion, urinary retention and tachycardia. Moreover, due to
the blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, orthostatic hypotension and dizziness may
develop. TCA-induced histamine blockade (H1) contributes to sedation, increased appetite,
weight gain and confusion. TCAs may also cause cardiovascular complications, including
arrhythmias, such as QT prolongation, ventricular ﬁbrillation and sudden cardiac death in
patients with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease. In addition, treatment with TCAs may
be associated with mild liver enzyme elevation [68].

Detailed recommendations for pharmacotherapy of depression are beyond the scope
of this paper and can be found in numerous guidelines, including those published by
psychiatric scientiﬁc societies [69–72], such as the Polish Society of Psychiatry [73].

Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important complementary role in
the comprehensive treatment of depression. They include primarily psychotherapeutic
techniques (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy, naturopathic therapy, physical activity
interventions or acupuncture) [74,75]. Some studies demonstrate the beneﬁts of some
dietary supplements on depressed mood. They are based on the polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), combining eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and
probiotics, which is in line with the assumption that inﬂammation and dysfunction of the
gut–brain axis are pathogenetic elements of depression [76]. Other highly promising dietary
interventions studied for potential use in depressive patients involve a speciﬁc group of
nutrients (vitamins, polyphenols and caffeine), foods (ﬁsh, nuts, fruit seeds and vegetables,
coffee/tea and fermented products) or dietary supplements (such as S-adenosylmethionine,
acetylcarnitine, creatine, amino acids, etc.) [77]. In severe cases of depression refractory to
classical pharmacological treatment, advanced non-pharmacological techniques, such as
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), are
also used [78,79]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrated that both techniques
are effective in depression treatment, with ECT superior compared to rTMS. Although
ECT was the most efﬁcacious, it was the least tolerated treatment, while rTMS was the
best-tolerated treatment for MDD [80,81].

6. Depression Phytopharmacotherapy as an Alternative to Classical Antidepressant
Treatment/Examples of Preparations and General Reasons for Their
Antidepressant Effect

There is now an upward trend in the number of prescriptions for antidepressants glob-
ally. The number of prescriptions for antidepressants in England has almost doubled over
the past decade. As many as 70.9 million prescriptions for antidepressants were registered
in 2018, up from 36 million in 2008 [82]. From 2009–2010 through 2017–2018, the proportion
of adults treated with antidepressants also increased in the USA. According to an analysis
by the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2017, the percentage of the US population
over the age of 12 years who had taken antidepressants in the past month was estimated
at 12.7% [83]. According to “The state of mental health in America 2022” [84], 15.08% of
youth experienced a major depressive episode in the past year, and 24.7% of adults with
a mental illness reported an unmet need for treatment. European data also indicate high
use of antidepressants. In a large general population study from 27 European countries
that measured antidepressant use and regularity of use, 7.2% of participants reported
taking antidepressants in the past year. There were large differences in the prevalence of
antidepressant use between countries, ranging from 15.7% in Portugal to 2.7% in Greece.
The top ﬁve European countries in terms of the use of antidepressants in the last 12 months
were Portugal, Lithuania, Malta, the UK and France. In contrast, the ﬁve countries with
the lowest use of antidepressants in the last 12 months were Greece, Germany, Bulgaria,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

10 of 41

Cyprus and the Czech Republic. In this respect, Poland was ranked 19th among the 27
countries assessed. In contrast, the countries with the highest proportion of patients regu-
larly taking antidepressants were Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland and
the Netherlands. The countries with the lowest percentage of patients regularly using
antidepressants were Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia. In
this respect, Poland also took 19th place in the ranking (out of all 27 countries assessed) [85].
It should be strongly emphasized that antidepressants are drugs that produce signiﬁcant,
numerous adverse drug reactions, especially in patients using polypharmacy. The most
common adverse effect reported by patients was weight gain after TCAs, followed by sex-
ual dysfunction for SSRIs, nausea or vomiting for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
and headache for SNRIs [86]. Notably, TCAs were associated with a wide range of ADRs,
such as toxic delirium, grand mal seizures, increased liver enzymes, urinary retention,
ﬂushing or cardiovascular disorders (i.e., mainly orthostatic collapse). Psychological and
neurological ADRs were the most common in SSRI-treated patients, followed by gastroin-
testinal, dermatological and endocrine/electrolyte reactions, with agitation, hyponatraemia,
increased liver enzymes, nausea and serotonin syndrome as leading adverse effects [87]. In
the study by Uher et al. [88], ADRs induced by nortriptyline or escitalopram were assessed
on the basis of the Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist and the psychiatrist-rated UKU
Side Effect Rating Scale. Dry mouth (74%), constipation (33%) and weight gain (15%) were
associated with nortriptyline treatment. Diarrhoea (9%), insomnia (36%) and yawning
(16%) were more common during treatment with escitalopram. Problems with urination
and drowsiness predicted discontinuation of nortriptyline, while diarrhoea and decreased
appetite were the main causes of discontinuation of escitalopram.

Given the high use of antidepressants and their possible side effects, other treatment
options for depression are being explored, including the use of herbal medicines. Therefore,
phytopharmacotherapy is a promising therapeutic option that appears to be a safer alter-
native, particularly for patients with mild depressive disorders or for seasonal dysthymia
(“winter depression”).

For centuries, people have tried to treat depression with available remedies of natural
origin used as part of traditional medicine. In different cultures and geographic regions,
certain medicinal plants have been known and used to treat many different conditions.
Estimates indicate that of the more than 300,000 seed plants, approximately 60% have been
used for their medicinal properties [89]. In some regions (especially Africa, South America
and Asia), the use of traditional medicine systems (including medicinal plants) based
on social and ethnic continuity and empirical ﬁndings is the main therapeutic approach.
Ethnomedicine (ethnopharmacology) has also distinguished medicinal plants as effective in
the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders [90]. In summary, medicinal plants
(“herbs”) contain various pharmacologically active compounds in their tissues: alkaloids,
glucosides, essential oils, fatty oils, mucilages, tannins, gums, ﬂavonoids, iridoids and
bitters, saponins and others that cannot be separated into individual compounds. This fact
distinguishes the mode of action of phytopharmaceuticals from classical, synthetic drugs—
the pharmacological action mediated by phytopharmaceuticals is not mediated by just one
compound, but is the result of the synergistic and polyvalent, complementary action of
many active substances. On the contrary, the “mainstream” pharmacodynamic effect in
classical pharmacology is based on an isolated, single active compound. A synergistic effect
is deﬁned as an effect produced by a combination of substances that is greater than would
be expected if the combined action of the individual components were considered [15,91,92].
A complementary concept is the theory of the polyvalent action of phytopharmacological
ingredients, which assumes that herbal extracts can exert a wide range of biological activity
due to the variety of chemical compounds present in herbs, each of which produces different
effects [15,93].

The synergistic and polyvalent effects of herbal compounds in the treatment of de-
pression and other mental disturbances are becoming increasingly important. In a study
by Kessler et al. [94], 54% of patients suffering from depression reported using herbal

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

11 of 41

medicines in the past 12 months to treat their disorder. Similar to this ﬁnding, it was
revealed that 44% of psychiatric inpatients hospitalized for acute care for various psychi-
atric disturbances had used herbal medicines in the previous 12 months [95]. Despite the
popularity of herbal medicines in the treatment of depression, as well as other psychiatric
disorders (such as anxiety or insomnia), research on phytopharmaceuticals in neuropsy-
chology is not as advanced as for synthetic drugs. For the most part, the results of beneﬁcial
effects of phytopharmaceuticals in the treatment of nervous system disorders have been ob-
tained in vitro or in preclinical studies in laboratory animals, with an abundance of clinical
studies validating the efﬁcacy and safety of phytopharmaceuticals in patients [15,96]. There
is also well-established use of herbal medicines containing active substances dating back
more than ten years, and their efﬁcacy and safety have been well-established, so the use
of such preparations is legally possible based on the results obtained from a review of the
scientiﬁc literature. In addition, there is also traditional use of herbal medicines containing
plants or parts or extracts of plants that have been traditionally used for centuries, and
their administration for various clinical conditions is based on empirical evidence, which
means that they are acceptably safe, although they do not have a precisely deﬁned level of
efﬁcacy [97,98].

Most herbal medicines used in the phytopharmacology of depression are over-the-
counter (OTC) preparations or dietary supplements and are considered safe and induce
fewer ADRs compared to conventional medicines, especially TCAs (cholinolytic symptoms,
sexual dysfunction, insomnia, withdrawal problems) [15,99–101]. Examples of OTC drugs
or dietary supplements used for depression in Poland (the country of residence of the
authors of this review) are summarized in Table 1. The examples of preparations listed
there indicate that the most popular antidepressant preparations in Poland are based on St.
John’s wort and saffron crocus, with the possible addition of lemon balm, B vitamins or
amino acids that are sources of monoamines (tryptophan, phenylalanine).

Preparations with similar compositions are used in other countries. In general, com-
mercially available OTC drugs or dietary supplements usually contain various nutraceuti-
cals, such as vitamins (including vitamin D and vitamin B group); S-adenosyl methionine
(considered the universal methyl donor in living organisms); amino acids (phenylalanine,
tyrosine and tryptophan); amino acids that are precursors of neurotransmitters (nora-
drenaline, serotonin); microelements (zinc, magnesium); and phytoceuticals (St. John’s
wort, saffron crocus, turmeric, roseroot, lavender), often with the addition of adaptogenic
ashwagandha and anxiolytic kava [102].

Unlike preparations in the Polish pharmaceutical market, foreign products are often
enriched with omega-3 acids (e.g., EPA and DHA) because these nutrients can reduce
inﬂammation in the brain, which may positively impact mood. Moreover, turmeric is rarely
found in commercially available preparations popular in the Polish pharmaceutical market.
Moreover, there is no preparation containing Piper methysticum (kava) in Poland due to
the warnings issued by the European Safety Food Authority (ESFA) about the potential
hepatotoxicity of kavalactones. Thus, kava cannot be a component of dietary supplements
or OTC drugs in Poland, and its use in pharmaceuticals has been prohibited. However, later
studies showed the hepatotoxicity of kava preparations obtained by extracting whole plants
with organic solvents, while daily intake of kavalactones in the form of tablets obtained
from a traditional aqueous plant extract was not harmful [103]. This resulted in the lifting
of restrictive regulations on the import and trade of kava-based pharmaceutical products.
Nowadays, kava trade is regulated by each country individually.

In the further part of our review, we discuss the phytopharmacodynamics of the
following plants with antidepressant activity: St. John’s wort (SJW), saffron crocus, lemon
balm, lavender, gingko, Korean ginseng, roseroot, magnolia bark, borage, brahmi and
mimosa tree.

7. Side Effects of Herbal Antidepressants Discussed in This Review

The use of herbal antidepressant preparations is characterized by greater safety com-
pared to classic antidepressants, and this issue is one of the main advantages of phy-
topharmacotherapy. These preparations, which mostly have the legal status of dietary
supplements, are available without a prescription and are perceived to be safe. However,
all medicinal agents, including herbal preparations, have potential side effects. As with
other drugs, the risk of adverse drug reactions may be inﬂuenced by a user’s age, gender,
genetics, nutrition status and concurrent disease states and treatments. In clinical practice,
recognizing adverse effects of herbal medicine is not routine, and their reporting is less
frequent compared to synthetic drugs [104].

Among herbal antidepressants, the most recognized side effects are described for
St. John’s wort, perhaps due to the fact that St. John’s wort (SJW) preparations, next
to saffron-containing medicines, are the most popular plant antidepressants. The most
commonly reported adverse reactions for SJW are gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic
reactions, dizziness/confusion, tiredness/sedation and dry mouth. Hyperesthesia and a
syndrome of dyspnoea and hyperventilation with ﬂushing headache, mydriasis, nausea,
palpitations and tremor have been also reported. The majority of these reactions were
generally considered to be mild, moderate or transient. [105–107]. Data from observational
studies have indicated that adverse events may occur in 1%–3% of patients treated with
SJW preparations [108]. In the case of SJW, there is also the possibility of triggering a manic
phase in the course of bipolar disorder [109]. In addition, the phytopharmacologically
active components of SJW (hypericin and hyperforin) are known inducers of cytochrome
enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, 3A2, 3E1), as well as p-glycoprotein. Therefore,
chronic use of St. John’s wort is associated with a risk of pharmacokinetic interactions at
the biotransformation stage with drugs whose metabolism also occurs in the cytochrome
isoenzymes mentioned [110–113]. Moreover, the most widely known, possibly serious
adverse effect associated with SJW administration is a fatal increase in serotonin, which can
possibly cause serotonin syndrome when coupled with certain antidepressants (SSRI) and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

14 of 41

monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. It is an example of a possible pharmacodynamic
SJW interaction. Serotonin syndrome is known to manifest with hyperthermia, tachycardia
hypertension, mydriasis and diaphoresis [105,106]. A detailed list of possible clinically
signiﬁcant drug interactions with SJW is presented in Table 2.

The photosensitizing effect of St. John’s wort is also well known, which reasonably
contraindicates the use of this type of preparation in summer, during high sunlight. On
the other hand, the photosensitizing effect of hypericin provides a background for the
use of this compound in photodynamic therapy [114,115]. As a side note, all these in-
dications regarding the safety of SJW preparations have been the reason why dietary
supplements and OTC monopreparations containing relatively high doses of dry St. John’s
wort extract (tablets/capsules containing 160–425 mg) have been withheld from the Polish
pharmaceutical market.

Saffron is used in foods and is generally regarded as safe when consumed in usual
quantities. Ingestion of less than 1.5 g of saffron is nontoxic for human, and it is consid-
ered toxic when ingested with doses more than 5 g. The estimated lethal dose is about
20 g/day [116]. The data indicate that the frequency and types of adverse events reported
for saffron used as antidepressant are similar to those reported for placebo and standard
antidepressants (ﬂuoxetine, citalopram) used as comparators. Spontaneous reports of
adverse reactions associated with saffron include rash, ﬂushing, hyperhidrosis, vomiting,
malaise and insomnia. However, it must be emphasized that causality has not necessarily
been established in all these cases [117].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

15 of 41

Other plant antidepressants are also characterized by high safety of use. Lemon balm
is generally well tolerated, having no relevant side effects, and only occasionally headache,
vomiting, abdominal pain and nausea have been reported [118]. Further, no signiﬁcant
adverse effects associated with the use of lavender preparations in usually appropriate
doses have been described [119]. In general, ginkgo administered in antidepressant prepa-
rations is also safe and well tolerated. The maximum recommended dose for ginkgo
extract is 240 mg/day [120]. The reported gingko-induced adverse effects were mild and
included headache, heart palpitations, gastrointestinal upset, constipation and allergic skin
reactions [121]. However, it should be emphasized that the biologically active ingredients
of gingko are inhibitors of the cytochrome CYP2C9 (important for the metabolism of se-
lected oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs) and inducers of CYP2C19 (important
for the metabolism of selected anticonvulsants). Therefore, patients treated with warfarin,
diazepam or phenytoin should avoid gingko preparations due to the increased risk of
bleeding or seizures, despite anticoagulant/anticonvulsant compliance [122]. Panax gin-
seng generally is well tolerated, and its adverse effects are mild and reversible and include
nausea, diarrhoea, euphoria, insomnia, headaches, hypertension, hypotension, mastalgia
and vaginal bleeding. However, it should be noted that biological compounds from Panax
ginseng may interact with caffeine to cause hypertension, and it may decrease the effective-
ness of warfarin. Concomitant use of Panax ginseng and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor
phenelzine may result in manic-like symptoms. Ginseng also exerts hypoglycaemic activity;
therefore, caution should be exercised in using ginseng products in patients with diabetes
because of possible pharmacodynamic interactions with oral hypoglycaemic agents and
insulin [123]. Roseroot is well tolerated, and characteristic adverse effects have not been
described. Only a few reports have indicated that repeated doses of roseroot caused mild
dizziness and gastrointestinal discomfort. However, it can be mildly stimulating for some
people; therefore, taking roseroot late in the day should be avoided to prevent potential in-
terference with sleep. Some sources suggest avoiding using roseroot in people with bipolar,
hypomania or paranoia, and as a preventive measure, roseroot preparations should not be
combined with coffee [124]. Moreover, the use of the main biologically active ingredients
of magnolia bark (magnolol and honokiol) seems to be safe. No speciﬁc adverse effects
have been described for these substances at a concentration of > 240 mg/kg b.w./day of
magnolia bark extract. Intervention trials employing concentrated magnolia bark extract
for up to 1 year did not report adverse effects. In conclusion, over the recent years, different
food safety authorities evaluated magnolol and honokiol and considered them safe [125].
Data on the side effects of other plants discussed in this review are scarce, and the literature
search does not indicate reporting signiﬁcant disorders during their use. A Sayyah et al.
study [126] did not demonstrate any signiﬁcant differences between groups of patients
treated with either 500 mg aqueous extract of borage or ﬂuoxetine (20 mg/day). In a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study aiming to determine the effect
of brahmi on attention, cognitive processing and working memory in healthy elderly, no
signiﬁcant adverse effects were demonstrated during the trial in subjects treated with
brahmi extract tablets containing either 300 or 600 mg compared to the placebo group [127].
Mimosa tree is considered safe for long-term use. Aqueous extract of mimosa tree was not
found to produce any delirious symptoms, and the plant is regarded to be safe even at the
dose 2000 mg/kg p.o. [128].

8. A Brief Description of the Phytopharmacodynamics of Plant-Derived Compounds
with Antidepressant Activity with Particular Emphasis on Their
Anti-Inﬂammatory Effect

There are several plants usually administered in depression phytopharmacotherapy.
In the opinion of the authors of this review and based on literature data [15,90,93,96],
several medicinal plants with great potential and a history of use in depression phytophar-
macotherapy can be identiﬁed. They are listed in Table 3. The authors use their common
names in this paper.

Classical pharmacotherapy of depression is still based on the monoamine theory and
aims to correct the disturbed CNS neurotransmitter levels. In general, the detailed mech-
anisms by which medicinal plants exert antidepressant effects do not differ from those
demonstrated for classic, pharmacological antidepressants. The evidence for their phy-
topharmacodynamics comes mainly from experimental studies and literature data reported
within traditional medical systems, and pharmacopoeias support the use of some herbs in
the treatment of depression. The description of the antidepressant activity of selected plant-
derived compounds involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of monoamine
reuptake; enhanced serotonin receptor binding and sensitization; monoamine oxidase
inhibition; GABAergic effects (especially for plants exhibiting sedative and anxiolytic ef-
fects accompanying the antidepressant effect); complex, excitatory or inhibitory effects
on various receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), GABA, cholinergic, adrenergic,
serotonergic, dopaminergic and opioid ones); and cannabinoid system effects [15,129–132].
In line with the complex, psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrinological pathogenesis of depres-
sion, herbal compounds have also been found to affect the activity of the HPA axis and
stimulate immunomodulatory activity, which seems to contribute signiﬁcantly to their
antidepressant effect. Considering the mechanism of action of medicinal plants with an-
tidepressant activity, it should be noted once again that their antidepressant effect results
from the comprehensive action of numerous active compounds (in line with the theory of
polyvalence and synergistic action of plant-derived compounds mentioned above). Due
to the complexity of the chemical composition of medicinal plants with antidepressant
activity (the most important ingredients are listed in Table 4), the ﬁnal effect depends on
their synergistic action. Thus, unlike traditional synthetic antidepressants, the molecu-
lar mechanism of action of herbal preparations cannot be explained based on a separate
analysis for individual compounds; instead, it is considered a result of the collective and
simultaneous action of many active compounds co-occurring in the studied plant extract.
In addition, possible differences in the composition of medicinal plants resulting from the
plant sources (harvest from cultivation vs. from a natural stand) and seasonal ﬂuctuations
in the chemical composition of plants contribute to the difﬁculties in an unambiguous
description of the phytopharmacodynamics of plant preparations. Moreover, although

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

17 of 41

research on plant-based drugs provides an important source of new antidepressants, it
faces numerous problems, including the procurement and authentication of plant mate-
rial, implementation of high-throughput screening bioassays and scale-up of bioactive
compounds with suspected antidepressant activity subjected to clinical assessment. The
issues mentioned above pose a challenge to translational pharmacology and the detailed
description of plant-derived preparations entering clinical trials [133,134].

Figure 2 presents the essential elements of the phytopharmacodynamics of antidepres-

sant medicinal plants.

the antidepressant effect is the result of the action of numerous co-occurring active compounds.
The pharmacodynamics of these compounds involve similar mechanisms to those attributed to
synthetic antidepressants. However, unlike synthetic antidepressants, an important aspect of the
antidepressant effect of herbal preparations is also their anti-inﬂammatory action. Details are

In addition to the direct effect of active, plant-derived compounds on correcting the
disturbances of CNS neurotransmission, an immunomodulatory effect is also considered
important to their antidepressant activity. There is evidence that antidepressant plants
discussed in this review exert anti-inﬂammatory effects, also involving CNS. The patho-
physiology of depression, as mentioned in the brief description above, is also associated
with immune disturbances, releasing pro-inﬂammatory mediators and increased oxidative
stress in the CNS. Hence, the alleviation of immunological disturbances may contribute
to an antidepressant effect. The anti-inﬂammatory effects of plants with antidepressant
activity examined in this review are brieﬂy discussed below.

Brahmi has been used for nearly 3000 years by Ayurvedic medical professionals for
Alzheimer’s disease, improving memory, anxiety, allergic conditions and irritable bowel
syndrome. It is a medicinal herb exerting an anti-inﬂammatory effect due to the selective
inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Therefore, it is used in relieving acute
pain and inﬂammation due to a reduction in COX-2-mediated prostanoid mediators. In
addition, brahmi helps manage diseases involving chronic systemic and brain inﬂammation
driven by the innate immune system. The administration of brahmi is associated with
cognitive enhancing (nootropic) activity, including improving free recall, observed after
prolonged intake (>3 months) due to the alleviation of chronic inﬂammation and oxidative
stress associated with ageing. Furthermore, brahmi use is associated with the down-
regulation of NO and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines: TNF-a and Il-6, and elevation of Il-10
in stimulated human blood cells [135,136]. Moreover, an additional element of the anti-
inﬂammatory action of brahmi in the brain is the inhibition of signalling enzymes associated
with CNS inﬂammatory pathways: caspase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3, as well as
caspase-3, which has been shown to cleave protein tau, an early event in the development of
Alzheimer’s disease [136]. The brahmi extract solution demonstrated antioxidant activity
in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method [137]. It was
also shown in an experimental study that brain antioxidant status improved in cigarette
smoke-exposed rats treated with an extract from brahmi [138,139].

Current pharmacological studies show that borage has analgesic, anxiolytic, antibacte-
rial and antiviral properties. A decoction and hydroalcoholic extracts of borage showed
promising antioxidant activity evaluated by DPPH and 2,2(cid:48)-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-
6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays, which are commonly applied to determine total antiox-
idative potential [140]. Borage also shows anti-inﬂammatory properties. An in vitro study
revealed that macrophages treated with a borage hexane extract modulated their inﬂamma-
tory mode by reducing NO secretion and COX-2 activity and decreasing IL-1β, IL-6 and
TNF-α cytokine levels [141].

Ginkgo is another medicinal plant with antidepressant potential. However, it also has
anticancer, antidementia, antidiabetic, antiobesity, antilipidemic, antimicrobial, antiplatelet,
hepatoprotective, anti-ageing and neuroprotective effects. It is frequently employed to treat
neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including tardive dyskinesia [142].
This plant also offers immunomodulatory and anti-inﬂammatory properties. An exper-
imental study evaluated the protective potential of ginkgo extract against hippocampal
neuronal injury induced by trimethyltin (TMT). A signiﬁcant decrease in oxidative stress,
as evidenced by reductions in malondialdehyde (MDA) and total reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and marked suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
B cells (NF-κB) and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1α, 1L-6), was demonstrated
in rats treated with the ginkgo extract [143]. In another experimental in vitro study us-
ing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated cultured primary rat microglia, the ginkgo extract
signiﬁcantly inhibited the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and differentially regulated
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β). Thus, it can be concluded that ginkgo
showed anti-neuroinﬂammatory activity [144]. In macrophage culture, the ethanol extract
of ginkgo ﬂowers and the chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions signiﬁcantly decreased
nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and PGE2 production [145]. Ethanol and acetone
extracts from ginkgo added into the culture of human endothelial cells also inhibited ROS

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

19 of 41

production and decreased soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin adhesion molecule levels [146].

Another medicinal plant used in the additional treatment of neurodegenerative dis-
eases, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, cancer and other degenera-
tive processes commonly developing with age is Korean ginseng. The administration of
preparations from this plant offers several health beneﬁts related to anti-inﬂammatory and
decreasing oxidative stress effects associated with ageing. Korean ginseng bioactive com-
pounds reduce the effects of these conditions, mainly due to the suppression of the COX-2
and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzymes. They can also decrease the production of malonalde-
hyde and increase the expression of antioxidants (glutathione and superoxide dismutase).
Furthermore, the chronic administration of preparations from Korean ginseng resulted in
the down-regulation of TNF-α, IL-1b and IL-6. Active compounds from Korean ginseng
also caused an increase in cellular proliferation; an increase in the activity of free radical
scavengers; and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) [147,148].
In vitro studies also reported ginseng saponins as NO synthesis inhibitors in LPS- and
IFN-γ-induced murine microglial cells [149].

Lavender is used for restlessness, insomnia, nervousness and depression. It is also ad-
ministered for various digestive complaints, including dyspepsia, loss of appetite, vomiting
and nausea. Lavender essential oils were also studied in macrophage cell lines as an in vitro
cell culture model for evaluation of its potential efﬁcacy in LPS-stimulated inﬂammation.
It was demonstrated that compounds constituting the lavender essential oil modulate
the activity and action of the NF-κB signalling pathway and are potent inhibitors of the
synthesis of four pro-inﬂammatory cytokines: IL-6, IL-8, IL-β and TNFα [150]. The anti-
inﬂammatory activity of lavender oil was also revealed in an animal study of inﬂammation
induced by carrageenan and croton oil. This inﬂammation model shows increased cytokine,
prostaglandin and leukotriene production. These effects are thought to be mediated by
protein kinase C, which mediates a number of intracellular signal transduction pathways
implicated in the pathogenesis of inﬂammation, including phospholipase A2-dependent
arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production. Animals pretreated with lavender oil
demonstrated decreased inﬂammatory response [151]. In an acute model of inﬂammation
(carrageenan-induced paw oedema model) in mice, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and
NO production were decreased in animals treated with lavender essential oil [152].

Lemon balm is another popular herb with multiple therapeutic properties, including
antidepressive, antispasmodic and antimicrobial effects. This medicinal plant reduces stress
and anxiety and promotes sleep. Moreover, lemon balm has marked anti-inﬂammatory
and antioxidant properties. This plant is also used to treat neurodegenerative diseases
and obesity. Additionally, it ﬁnds application in ophthalmology, gynaecology, oncology,
gastroenterology and cardiology [153,154]. In an animal study, in the carrageenan paw
oedema model in rats, an antioxidant capacity of lemon balm extract was demonstrated,
including the ability to scavenge a wide range of free radicals, including nitric oxide. The
mechanisms of antioxidant action of lemon balm extract involve improving plasma levels of
catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as a marked reduction
in plasma DNA damage, myeloperoxidase and lipid peroxidation [155]. Noteworthy,
essential oils from lemon balm are also a rich source of phenolic antioxidants (mainly
citronellal and neral), and its activity is comparable with synthetic antioxidants: butylated
hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) [155]. The anti-inﬂammatory
action of lemon balm, similar to other medicinal plants discussed in this review, was
revealed to be attributed to the alleviation of reactions induced by prostaglandins and some
pro-inﬂammatory (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) cytokines [154].

Magnolia bark also shows a strong anti-inﬂammatory effect. This medicinal plant has
been used for thousands of years in Chinese and Japanese medicines to treat anxiety, asthma,
depression, gastrointestinal disorders and headache. The main compounds with anti-
inﬂammatory effects are honokiol and magnolol. Honokiol inhibits the TNF-α-stimulated

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

20 of 41

NF-κB pathway, with subsequent inhibition of NO generation. Moreover, honokiol reduces
NF-κB target genes, such as VEGF, ICAM-1 and COX-2. This compound is regarded as a
potent inhibitor of ROS, with estimated antioxidant activity 1000 times that of α-tocopherol
(vitamin E) [156]. In an experimental in vitro study, magnolia bark extract reduced matrix
metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) secretion from LPS-
stimulated monocytes [157]. Both honokiol and magnolol have antioxidant properties [158].
Honokiol signiﬁcantly inhibited the LPS-induced TNF-α synthesis and NF-κB activity in
mouse monocytes [159].

Mimosa tree is a medicinal plant with antidepressant, anticancer, antibacterial, antial-
lergic, antinociceptive, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant
effects [160,161]. Similar to other medicinal plants mentioned above, the mimosa tree also
exerted an anti-inﬂammatory effect in experimental carrageenan, dextran and cotton pellet-
induced rat models of inﬂammation and paw oedema [162]. Furthermore, in the chronic
rat model of inﬂammation, the aqueous extract of mimosa tree alleviated both the ﬁrst
phase of the inﬂammatory response produced by histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins and
bradykinin and inhibited the second transudative and proliferative phase associated with
cyclooxygenase products of the entity [163,164]. Again, as with the other medicinal plants
discussed above, the anti-inﬂammatory effect of mimosa tree is accompanied by an antioxi-
dant effect due to potent free radical scavenging effects comparable to those of ascorbic acid
and activation of superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidase catalase [161,165].

An anti-inﬂammatory effect is also reported for roseroot, and this action is conditioned
by speciﬁc compounds: salidroside and rosavin. Roseroot is considered an adaptogen—it
means that the plant stimulates the body’s resistance to physical, environmental and
emotional stressors. Thus, it is used to ﬁght fatigue, anxiety, stress and depression. The
anti-inﬂammatory property of extracts from this medicinal plant ﬁnds use in various patho-
logical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic
disease, arthritis or cancer [166]. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments conﬁrmed the
immune-regulation effects of roseroot extract via various inﬂammatory mediators (e.g.,
TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, NO, COX-2) and signalling pathways (NF-κB, activator protein 1 (AP-1)
and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)) [166,167]. Furthermore, an
experimental study conﬁrmed the anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective effects of roseroot
constituents in microglial and neuronal cells. Activated microglia produce large amounts
of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α,
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which, in turn, cause neuronal damage.
Moreover, the active compound of roseroot protects against glutamate-induced nephro-
toxicity. Thus, roseroot preparations may offer some health beneﬁts in neurodegenerative
disorders [168].

A pronounced immunoregulatory effect is also documented for dried stigmas of the
saffron crocus. This plant may have the potential to treat cancer and age-related macular de-
generation. However, it has a well-documented efﬁcacy as an alternative treatment for mild
to moderate depression. The putative anti-inﬂammatory action of saffron crocus is likely
caused by crocin, crocetin and safranal. The molecular mechanisms of these derivatives
involve a decrease of serum levels of NF-κB p65 subunit, TNF-α, IFN-γ and some inter-
leukins, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17A. Moreover, saffron crocus has been known
as the antagonist of NF-κB and the agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPAR-γ). In addition, this ﬂower was shown to down-regulate pro-inﬂammatory
enzymes, such as MPO, COX-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and phospholipase
A2, inhibiting prostanoids synthesis [169]. In a clinical study of patients with type 2 dia-
betes, 12 weeks of supplementation with saffron tablets (100 mg/day) yielded no signiﬁcant
differences between groups treated with saffron crocus and placebo regarding TNF-α, but
the supplementation resulted in a marked decrease in blood MDA level, which is a marker
of oxidative stress [170]. Similarly, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
supplemented with saffron crocus (30 mg/day of crocin during 12 weeks) demonstrated
decreased serum levels of total oxidative status and NF-κB, which indicated that saffron

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

21 of 41

supplementation appears to effectively establish oxidant/antioxidant balance and improve
inﬂammatory conditions in patients with COPD [171]. The anti-inﬂammatory property
of saffron crocus was also proved in asthma patients. The 8-week administration of 100
mg/day of saffron crocus preparation resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of IL-10, IL-35 and
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) [172]. Some experimental studies showed that
saffron crocus contributes to neuroprotection. The saffron crocus compounds decrease
CNS inﬂammation by inhibiting the production of free radicals and enhancing antioxidant
activities in the extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway-dependent
manner. Moreover, saffron crocus preparations enhance gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase
activity, the main enzyme for glutathione synthesis [173].

St. John’s wort is one of the most popular medicinal plants. It has been used in diges-
tive disorders, e.g., dyspepsia and spastic ailments of the digestive tract (for the relaxation
of the smooth muscles of the digestive tract and bile ducts). It also has cholagogic and chole-
poietic effects. Among the numerous biological properties of SJW, the anti-inﬂammatory
effect should be stressed. The medicinal plant has a long history of traditional use in
inﬂammatory conditions, e.g., neuralgia, ﬁbrositis, rheumatism and sciatica. It is also
applied externally to treat wounds and bruises [174]. A key anti-inﬂammatory mechanism
of SJW is the inhibition of the expression of pro-inﬂammatory genes, including COX-2, IL-6
and iNOS [175]. PGE2 is formed from arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase-catalysed
synthesis of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) and further transformation by PGE2 synthases.
Experimental studies demonstrated that one of the main compounds of SJW, hyperforin,
potently inhibited the enzymatic conversion of PGH2 to PGE2, catalysed by PGE2 syn-
thases. Moreover, hyperforin was also found to inhibit 5-LOX. It also contributes to the
anti-inﬂammatory and anti-cancerogenic properties of SJW [176]. In the context of the anti-
inﬂammatory effect of St. John’s wort within the CNS and the associated antidepressant
effect, experimental studies have shown that mouse hippocampal neurons were protected
against glutamate- or NMDA-induced cytotoxicity by SJW extract. Moreover, a morpholog-
ical remodelling by increasing neurite outgrowth and activation of the anti-inﬂammatory
defence by inhibiting cytokine production was reported in human macrophages in the pres-
ence of SJW extract. These neuroprotective properties may be the beneﬁcial antidepressive
effect of SJW supplementation [177].

In conclusion, the evidence discussed brieﬂy above conﬁrms the anti-inﬂammatory
properties of medicinal plants showing antidepressant activity. In the context of the complex
pathogenesis of depression, which also includes immunological disturbances within the
brain, it should be emphasized that the anti-inﬂammatory potential of the medicinal plants
discussed in this review is an important element of their antidepressant activity. Details on
the mechanisms of antidepressant action of individual plants discussed here are presented
in Table 4.

In addition, the complex antidepressant effect caused by phytopharmacologically
active ingredients is often accompanied by an anxiolytic effect, which alleviates sleep
disorders, improves cognitive function and counteracts adynamia and fatigue. This is
due to the complex action of phytopharmacological compounds. Further, the secondary
anxiolytic effect induced by herbal antidepressants may be due to a “halo effect”, which
means that anxiety may also be reduced if depression is successfully treated [15,178]. It
should be stressed once again that the mechanisms of action of active ingredients present
in medicinal plants with antidepressant properties, in accordance with the principles of
synergy and polyvalence, are not as clearly deﬁned as for synthetic, single antidepressants.

Table 4 lists plants considered to show antidepressant activity, with details regarding

their mechanisms of antidepressant action.

The literature review also revealed the results of some clinical trials evaluating the
efﬁcacy of the antidepressant medicinal plants discussed in this paper. Although the num-
ber of these studies is much smaller than studies evaluating synthetic antidepressants,
and they are subject to some caveats, as discussed below, the available data support the
efﬁcacy of phytopharmacotherapy in mild to moderate depression, with an emphasis on the
lower potential for adverse effects. In line with the principles of evidence-based medicine
(EBM), Table 5 presents data obtained from the highest level of scientiﬁc evidence (system-
atic reviews, meta-analyses and isolated, methodologically correct (randomized, blinded)
clinical trials) [232–234]. For some plants (bacopa, mimosa tree, magnolia), the literature
review revealed a clear advantage of experimental animal studies and no results from more
extensive clinical trials. In these cases, we also enrolled prospective, observational studies.
This further justiﬁes the need to undertake large clinical trials evaluating the potential
antidepressant efﬁcacy and safety of these plants in patients with depression. Researchers
also emphasize that the vast majority of clinical trials conducted to date evaluating herbal
antidepressants have numerous limitations. We should interpret the results of these studies
with caution due to the high level of heterogeneity between them. The small sample sizes,
relatively small follow-up period and differences between the detailed methodology were
the most listed limitations of the present clinical trials. Some of these were not randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, which may lead to potential selection bias and may
not exclude natural improvement. Therefore, further high-quality clinical trials are needed
to ﬁrmly establish the clinical efﬁcacy of medicinal plants with antidepressant effects

A systemic review and

Investigation of the effects and side effects
of lemon balm as a medicinal herb on
anxiety and depression in clinical trials
published up to 30 October 2020.

SJW extract did not differ from SSRIs in
clinical response, remission and the mean
reduction in Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression score. St. John’s wort extract had
a signiﬁcantly lower rate of adverse events
than SSRIs. SJW extract and SSRIs effectively
treat mild-to-moderate depression.

Compared to antidepressants, participants
taking SJW were less likely to experience
adverse events, with no difference in
treatment effectiveness in mild and
moderate depression. Monotherapy with
SJW for mild and moderate depression was
superior to placebo in reducing depression
symptoms and not signiﬁcantly different
from antidepressant medication.

SJW showed comparable response and
remission in patients with depression and a
signiﬁcantly lower withdrawal/depression
rate compared to standard SSRIs.

Saffron crocus can reduce the symptoms and
effects of depression, premenstrual
syndrome, sexual dysfunction and infertility.

Saffron supplementation can reduce
symptoms of depression in adults
with MDD.

Participants who received the saffron crocus
extract reported reduced depression scores
and improved social relationships at the end
of the study. This extract appears to improve
subclinical depressive symptoms in healthy
individuals and may contribute to increased
resilience against the development of
stress-related psychiatric disorders.

Saffron crocus capsules were not effective in
reducing food cravings, but as a safe
over-the-counter supplement, they were
effective in reducing the symptoms of
depression in patients who experience mild
or moderate depression and are overweight.

Lemon balm signiﬁcantly improved mean
anxiety and depression scores compared
with the placebo without serious side effects.
Current evidence suggests that lemon balm
may be effective in improving anxiety and
depressive symptoms, particularly in the
acute setting.

Evaluation of the safety and efﬁcacy of R.
rosea (extract 340–1360 mg daily) versus
sertraline or placebo therapy in 57 subjects
with major depressive disorder (MDD) in
a 12-week treatment.

The intervention group receiving 8-week
supplementation with 3 g lemon balm
capsules had a signiﬁcant reduction in
scores of depression, anxiety, stress and total
sleep disturbance in patients with CSA,
compared to the placebo group.

After the intervention, herbal balm
decreased depression more in the
intervention group compared to the placebo
group. Lemon balm may reduce depression
after a coronary artery bypass graft.

The results showed a signiﬁcant efﬁcacy of
lavender in reducing depression scores
compared to the control group. Subgroup
analysis showed that the effect of lavender
was slightly more pronounced in
participants with a diagnosis of depression,
while its effect was statistically signiﬁcant in
patients with other illnesses with associated
depressive symptoms, and the oral route
was the most effective route of administration.

The study conﬁrmed the effectiveness of
lavender aromatherapy in reducing anxiety
and depression in ACS patients and
supports the use of lavender oil
aromatherapy by intensive care nurses as a
non-pharmacological and cost-effective
intervention to reduce psychological tension
and increase patient satisfaction during
hospitalization in cardiac care units.

The administration of lavender oil decreased
the scores of depression and stress in the
intervention group in comparison with the
control group. Still, the reduction in the
anxiety score was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Aromatherapy with lavender essential oil
might reduce depression and stress among
haemodialysis patients. Therefore, this
method can be used as a complementary
method with less complication to improve
the quality of life of these patients.

Depression and anxiety mean scores
decreased in the lavender group compared
with controls, providing evidence that
lavender aromatherapy may be an effective
non-invasive treatment during the
postmenopausal stage.

Although R. rosea produced less
antidepressant effect versus sertraline, it also
resulted in signiﬁcantly fewer adverse
events and was better tolerated. These
ﬁndings suggest that R. rosea, although less
effective than sertraline, may have a more
favourable risk–beneﬁt ratio for people with
mild to moderate depression.

Ginkgo

Evaluation of the efﬁcacy of ginkgo extract
(40 mg three times a day) as augmentation
of treatment in 80 venlafaxine-treated
(75–225 mg/day) post-stroke depression
(PSD) patients. Moreover, serum

which is reduced in depressive disorders.

Korean ginseng

ginseng (3 g/day for 8 weeks) in 25 female
patients with residual symptoms of major
depression.

Evaluation of the efﬁcacy and tolerability
of Korean red ginseng supplementation
(RGA; 2 g/day for 6 weeks) in major

difﬁcult-to-treat patients who were
currently on antidepressant monotherapy
(duloxetine, venlafaxine, paroxetine,
sertraline, ﬂuoxetine, escitalopram,
mirtazapine).

Borage

Patients receiving ginkgo extract plus
venlafaxine had signiﬁcantly lower mean
depression scale scores. Meanwhile,
compared to the control group, patients in
the experimental group additionally
receiving ginkgo extract had signiﬁcantly
higher 5-HT levels and BDNF levels and
required a lower dose of venlafaxine and
experienced fewer adverse events. The
results showed that ginkgo extract was a
good augmentation of venlafaxine in the
treatment of PSD.

The time to onset of efﬁcacy was
signiﬁcantly shorter in the EGb + Cit group.
After treatment, S100B levels decreased, and
the change in S100B levels in the EGb + Cit
group was greater than in the Cit group.
EGb, as an adjunctive treatment, can
effectively improve depressive symptoms
and reduce serum S100B expression, which
is a marker of brain damage, suggesting that
EGb restores neurological function when
treating depression in elderly patients.

Subjects reported a signiﬁcant reduction in
depressive symptoms over 8 weeks. The
results suggest that Korean red ginseng is
effective as an adjunctive treatment for
patients with residual symptoms of major
depression.

The study demonstrated the presumed
efﬁcacy and tolerability of RGA in the
treatment of MDD, which is difﬁcult to treat
in clinical practice. Remission rates were
signiﬁcantly better in patients treated
with RGA.

The aim of the study was to investigate
whether magnolia tea drunk for 3 weeks
(one cup per day, prepared by infusing the

Echium amoenum extract did not cause more
side effects than placebo during the study. It
was concluded that the aqueous extract of
Echium amoenum can be considered an
effective and safe treatment for MDD.

The study showed a signiﬁcant decrease in
the severity of depression, anxiety and stress
after Brahmi supplementation for 1 month.

Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale
(CESD-10) depression scores, joint state plus

over time for the Bacopa group.

In the treatment group, 8 cases were cured,
20 cases were markedly effective, 10 cases
were effective, 12 cases were invalid, the
total efﬁcacy was 76.00%. In the control
group, 10 cases were cured, 20 cases were
markedly effective, 10 cases were effective,
10 cases were invalid, the total efﬁcacy was
80.00%.

Compared to the control group, the
intervention group showed a signiﬁcant
difference in sleep deprivation related to
physical symptoms at week 3 post-test. The
comparison results also showed alleviation
of depressive symptoms at week 3 post-test
and week 6 post-test. The results suggested
that drinking a single-ingredient magnolia
tea for a 3-week duration had positive
effects on postpartum women.

9. Conclusions and Future Research Directions

Many medicinal plants exert a range of psychotherapeutic effects through their in-
ﬂuence on central nervous system activity, including antidepressant, anxiolytic, sedative,
hypnotic or cognitive effects. Moreover, medicinal plants with adaptogenic and toning
effects are important in phytopharmacotherapy because they are believed to enhance
adaptation to exogenous stressors through complex and pleiotropic neuroendocrine mech-
anisms [261,262]. The discussion in this review indicates the pharmacological effectiveness
of phytotherapy in correcting pathophysiological disturbances and alleviating the symp-
toms of depression. The mechanisms of action of herbal-derived active compounds with
antidepressant activity presented in this narrative review conﬁrm similar pharmacodynam-
ics to synthetic antidepressants. In addition, a literature review yielded some scientiﬁc
evidence (systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomized controlled clinical trials) that
indicates the clinical effectiveness of the medicinal plants discussed in this paper in treating
mild and moderate depression. It makes phytopharmacotherapy a valuable alternative to
classical antidepressant treatment (SSRIs). Antidepressant phytotherapy involves a lower

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

30 of 41

risk of side effects. However, one should not forget that it is not entirely devoid of them,
which has been particularly demonstrated for St. John’s wort preparations.

According to the authors, taking into account the number of studies carried out so far,
the greatest clinical experience regarding the use of phytopharmacotherapy in depression
should be attributed to St. John’s wort and Saffron preparations. However, we should
emphasize that there are some limitations concerning the methodological quality of clinical
studies evaluating the phytotherapy of depression. These concerns necessitate further
veriﬁcation of the antidepressant effect of medicinal plants in large, appropriately designed
clinical trials to yield conclusive and incontrovertible results conﬁrming the efﬁcacy and
safety of herbal antidepressants.

In addition to the medicinal plants described in this review, other plants are currently
being studied for their antidepressant activity. Examples of such plants include Asparagus
racemosus, Rosmarinus ofﬁcinalis, Curcuma longa, Camellia sinensis, Emblica ofﬁcinalis, Cu-
curbita pepo, Centella asiatica, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Piper methysticum and others [3,4,263,264].
Antidepressant activity is also sought in plants with documented sedative, hypnotic and
anxiolytic properties, such as Humulus lupulus (hops), Valeriana ofﬁcinalis (valerian) and Pas-
siﬂora incarnata (maypop) [192]. A promising direction in the search for new antidepressant
plants may also be turning to traditional Chinese and Indian medicine systems. Evidence
is being reported that plants exotic to Europeans, found in Africa or South America, or
those widely used for centuries in the traditional folk medicine of East Asia (China, Japan)
also have antidepressant potential. The prophylaxis and adjuvant treatment of depression
were demonstrated for the genera Aloysia, Gladiolus, Hemerocallis or Convolvulus, commonly
used in Ayurvedic and folk medicine. Aloysia virgata grows in Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina
and Paraguay. The plant is used as an anti-catarrhal, antirheumatic, diaphoretic, stimulant,
stomachic and emollient. Plants from the Aloysia genus are also traditionally used for
affective disorders, and some have proven anxiolytic and antidepressant activity. Animal
studies using the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) demonstrated
promising antidepressive activity of the ethanolic extract of Aloysia [265].

Hemerocallis citrina is a plant indigenous to Asia. It is used in the folk medicine of East
Asia (China, Japan) and North America to improve emotional health and treat various
diseases, including insomnia, hepatosis and cancer [266]. Recent clinical studies conﬁrm
the sedative effects and high efﬁciency of ethanol extracts from the plant in mitigating
sleep and memory disorders, with the antidepressant effect currently being studied in
animal models [267]. Gladiolus dalenii is used by local communities in Africa to treat various
infections, such as meningitis, malaria, diarrhoea, ulcers and HIV-related fungal infec-
tions [268]. In African ethnomedicine, especially in Cameroon, Gladiolus is regarded to be a
cure for various CNS disorders, such as epilepsy, convulsions, schizophrenia and mood
disorders. There are reasons to believe preparations from this plant show antidepressant
efﬁcacy in animal models of epilepsy. Animal experiments based on the TST and FST also
showed the potential effectiveness of this plant in an animal model of depression [267].
Convolvulus pluricaulis (shankhpushpi) is one of the perennial medicinal herbs described in
Ayurvedic literature. This plant is reported to improve memory skills as a psychostimulant
with a calming effect, reducing mental tension [269]. Pharmacological studies indicate that
compounds found in Convolvulus pluricaulis interact with various proteins, neurosynapses,
signalling pathways and serotonergic synapses, which play a crucial role in the pathophys-
iology of Alzheimer’s disease and neurotransmission abnormalities related to long-term
depression [270].

In general, according to Moragrega and Rios, there were about 650 reports of antidepressant-
like medicinal plants in the PubMed database (considering the timespan from January 2000
to March 2020). There were 155 species studied and reported as antidepressants or as
sources of active principles for treating this condition in preclinical studies [271,272]. A
paradigm shift in current research should also be noted—the main research directions are
shifting from the classic correction of neurotransmission to the immunological and inﬂam-
matory aspects, in accordance with the broad “psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrinological”

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4772

31 of 41

pathophysiological concept of depression. Thus, current research focuses not only on
verifying the effect of novel plant-derived preparations on CNS neurotransmission, but
also conﬁrming the phytopharmacological activity in the mitigation of pro-inﬂammatory
mediators and enzymes [271,272]. Therefore, the novel herbal antidepressants expected in
the near future will not strive to rectify monoamine disturbances in the CNS, but will focus
more on immunoregulatory effects, targeting immunological and hormonal disorders,
which so far have been secondary pathophysiological targets of pharmacotherapy not
covered by classical treatment with synthetic antidepressants.
