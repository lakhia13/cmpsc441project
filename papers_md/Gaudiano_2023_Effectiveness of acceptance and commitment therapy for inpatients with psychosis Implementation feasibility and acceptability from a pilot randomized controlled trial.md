Abstract

Objective:  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Inpatients (ACT-IN) with psychosis has 
been found to be efficacious in previous trials, but its effectiveness has not been studied when 
implemented by frontline clinicians in routine settings.

Method:  In this pilot randomized controlled effectiveness trial, inpatients with schizophrenia-
spectrum disorders were randomized to ACT-IN plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23) or 
a time/attention matched (TAM) supportive condition plus TAU (n = 23) delivered by routine 
hospital staff. Both conditions received individual and group therapy during inpatient care and 
completed follow-up phone sessions during the first month post-discharge. Patients were assessed 
through 4 months post-discharge (blinded to condition) to determine feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary effectiveness of ACT-IN.

Results:  ACT-IN was feasible to deliver with fidelity by frontline staff when integrated into an 
acute care setting. At post-treatment, patients reported significantly greater treatment satisfaction 
in ACT-IN relative to TAM. Overall, results showed significant but similar improvements for both 
conditions through 4-month follow-up in psychiatric symptoms, functioning, and mindfulness. 
Only ACT-IN improved over time in distress. Furthermore, patients receiving TAM had a 3.76 
times greater risk of rehospitalization over 4 months compared with ACT-IN.

Conclusions:  ACT-IN is feasible and acceptable for patients with psychosis, can be 
implemented by hospital staff when integrated into acute treatment, and may result in decreased 
rehospitalization compared to alternative therapies. A future full-scale randomized-controlled 
implementation trial is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling causes of illness (Moreno-Küstner et al., 2018; 
Vos et al., 2017). Comprising just 1% of the global population, schizophrenia accounts 
for $15.2 billion of annual US economic costs (Cloutier et al., 2016) and ranks as one 
of the costliest of disorders due to its early age of onset and associated productivity loss 
and hospitalizations (Torio and Moore, 2016). Furthermore, individuals with schizophrenia 
constitute an estimated 121.9 of every 100,000 patients hospitalized for all physical 
and mental health reasons (Heslin and Weiss, 2015). Approximately 16% of discharged 
inpatients with schizophrenia are rehospitalized within one month (Horwitz et al., 2011), 
40% within one year (Hudson, 2019), and 60% within two years (Tiihonen et al., 2011).

Antipsychotic medication is the frontline treatment for psychotic symptoms, but effects on 
functioning, negative symptoms, and overall quality of life are more limited (Leucht et al., 
2009). Furthermore, most patients do not receive evidence-based psychosocial interventions 
during inpatient care even though recommended as part of evidence-based care (Glick 
et al., 2011). Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one type of therapy that 
has been adapted to treat psychosis and helps people cope with disturbing thoughts, 
feelings, and psychotic experiences by changing the way the individual relates to them. The 
treatment uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies to promote valued living, and fosters 
nonjudgmental awareness of psychotic experiences in ways that can improve functioning 
(Gaudiano, 2015). ACT for psychosis (ACTp) is listed as an evidence-based therapy 
(American Psychological Association, 2021; Australian Psychological Society, 2018) based 
on meta-analyses and systematic reviews supporting the efficacy of ACTp for schizophrenia-
spectrum disorders in both inpatient and outpatient settings (Cramer et al., 2016; Tonarelli et 
al., 2016; Wakefield et al., 2018; Yıldız, 2020).

ACTp seeks to reduce individuals’ unhelpful avoidance or struggle with psychotic symptoms 
that cause impairment and to increase their pursuit of valued life goals, which are 
hypothesized to decrease distress and improve functioning, thereby reducing relapse and

rehospitalization risk. The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of individual ACTp for 
inpatients included 80 participants and showed a faster time to rehospitalization in treatment 
as usual (TAU) alone compared to TAU plus ACTp (Bach and Hayes, 2002). Several 
subsequent studies have also reported reduced rehospitalization rates for inpatients from 
ACT-related interventions compared with TAU (Bach et al., 2013; Jacobsen et al., 2020; 
Tyrberg et al., 2017b). However, these previous studies of ACTp typically used advanced/
doctoral-level therapists with specialized training in ACT, and thus implementation of 
ACTp by frontline inpatient (non-doctoral) clinicians has yet to be studied. Furthermore, 
implementing psychological treatment in acute hospital settings remains a challenging task 
due to the lack of trained clinicians, time, and resources, as well as the generally “busy 
nature of the ward” (Elvat et al., 2021). Thus, ACTp’s uptake in inpatient settings has been 
limited to date.

1.1.  Rationale for Current Project

In phase one of this project, we conducted an open trial (n = 26) to develop our initial 
procedures for studying ACTp in an acute inpatient setting delivered by routine hospital 
staff (Gaudiano et al., 2020). The intervention, called ACT for Inpatients (ACT-IN), included 
individual and group sessions provided during the hospital stay. Previous studies used an 
individual format alone but groups are typically employed in hospital settings. In this initial 
study, ACT-IN was reported to be acceptable to patients and frontline staff who were not 
ACT experts (after receiving brief ACT training and support).

In phase two of this project, the current pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) continued 
to examine the feasibility and acceptability of group and individual ACT-IN for psychosis, 
this time compared with a time- and attention-matched (TAM) supportive therapy condition, 
through 4-months post-discharge. In the current study, we also added brief phone follow-up 
contacts in the first month post-discharge based on feedback and lessons learned from the 
open trial to support patients’ transition to outpatient. Post-discharge support is increasingly 
recognized as a best practice in the U.S. (National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 
2019). In the current RCT phase, we evaluated the delivery of the intervention with 
fidelity by staff as part of the inpatient milieu, the acceptability of study procedures (e.g., 
assessments, randomization), and patient satisfaction with ACT-IN and TAM (Study Aim 
1). Secondarily, we explored the effects of the study interventions on changes in patients’ 
symptoms, functioning, process measures, and rehospitalization rates to inform a future 
full-scale implementation trial (Study Aim 2).

2.  METHOD

2.1  Participants

The current study was part of the Researching the Effectiveness of Acceptance-based 
Coping during Hospitalization (REACH) project and procedures are described in detail 
elsewhere (Gaudiano et al., 2017). Participants were recruited from adult inpatient units at a 
large mental health hospital in the northeastern U.S. Inclusion criteria were: (1) DSM-5 
diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, 
schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, unspecified psychosis) or a mood disorder

with psychotic features (bipolar disorder with psychotic features, major depressive disorder 
with psychotic features), based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (First et 
al., 2015); (2) 18 years or older; and (3) ability to speak and read English. Exclusion 
criteria included: (1) psychosis severe enough to prevent participation in ward treatment; (2) 
psychosis due to a general medical condition or drug/alcohol alone; or (3) severe cognitive 
impairment based on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE < 15, moderate impairment) 
(Folstein et al., 1975).

2.2  Procedure

This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients were identified through 
electronic health records review of new admissions and were approached on one of 
two units at the same hospital typically within the first couple of days of admission. 
Randomization (concealed) of participants to the two treatment groups was stratified based 
on sex (male, female) and diagnosis (primary psychotic disorder, psychotic mood disorder). 
Outcome assessors were blind to condition. Participants immediately initiated both ACT-IN 
or TAM individual and group sessions integrated into typical ward programming which 
included other therapy groups and medication management sessions. Following discharge, 
participants in both conditions received brief follow-up phone calls from a therapist during 
the first month post-discharge to improve transition to outpatient treatment. Participants 
were asked to return to the hospital (or completed this remotely if unable to return in person) 
for follow-up assessments. Participants were compensated for completing study assessments 
but not for completing treatment sessions.

2.3  Measures

2.3.1.  Diagnostic/screening.—Participants were administered the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) (First et al., 2015) to confirm mental health diagnosis and 
the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) to assess for severe cognitive 
impairment.

2.3.2.  Feasibility/acceptability.—The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) 
(Larsen et al., 1979) is an 8-item self-report measure that was administered post-
hospitalization to measure treatment acceptability and satisfaction. The Credibility and 
Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) (Devilly and Borkovec, 2000) was administered after 
treatment allocation and is a 6-item, self-report scale measuring treatment expectancies.

2.3.3.  Treatment utilization.—Treatment utilization was captured at baseline and 
follow-up using the Treatment History Interview (THI) (Linehan and Heard, 1987), adapted 
for this study, which is an interview-based measure of mental health treatment received. 
Patients were asked to self-report their treatment utilization based on structured questions 
from the THI assessing pharmacotherapy, counseling, case management, and psychiatric 
rehospitalizations. Rehospitalization was also monitored during follow-up based on research 
staff review of electronic health records.

2.3.4.  Primary symptom outcome.—The primary symptom outcome measure used 
was the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), which is an 18-item structured, interview-

based scale of psychiatric symptoms including psychosis (Overall and Gorham, 1962). We 
chose the BPRS as our primary outcome based on the large effect size changes found on this 
measure in our previous inpatient studies of ACT (Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006; Gaudiano, et 
al. 2020).

2.3.5.  Secondary outcomes.—Global psychological distress was captured using the 
34-item, self-report Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE) (Barkham et al., 
1998). We used the short form of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment 
Schedule-II (WHODAS-II) (Federici et al., 2009), which is a 12-item, self-report scale 
measuring functional impairment (Andrews et al., 2009). We also collected the abbreviated 
Quality of Life Scale (QLS) (Bilker et al., 2003), a 7-item, interview-based measure of 
psychosocial functioning specific to schizophrenia.

2.3.6.  Process measures.—We administered the Acceptance and Action 
Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) (Bond et al., 2011), which is a 7-item, self-report measure of 
psychological flexibility. Mindfulness was measured using the Cognitive and Affective 
Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), a 12-item questionnaire (Feldman et al., 2007). The 
Valuing Questionnaire (VQ) (Smout et al., 2014) is a 12-item, self-report questionnaire 
measuring the perception that one’s actions are consistent with one’s personal values. The 
VQ captures both progress and obstruction to living in accordance with values. Items 
measuring obstruction to valued living were reverse scored before calculating an average 
score.

2.3.7.  Fidelity Scales.—Individual and phone session audiorecordings were rated for 
fidelity based on previously developed scales at the end of the project and fidelity checklists 
were used for group sessions. Treatment scales contained items of therapist adherence 
(yes/no) and competence (0 = poor to 6 = excellent) to prescribed session content, use 
of ACT strategies (cognitive defusion, acceptance, mindfulness, values, committed action), 
and absence of ACT inconsistent strategies (cognitive restructuring, reality testing, belief 
confrontation) (for details, see Gaudiano et al, 2020).

2.3.8.  Adverse events.—Adverse events (unfavorable medical occurrences) were 
collected by research staff at each study assessment or during routine chart review based 
on the following categories: hospitalizations, suicide attempts, deaths, or distress related to 
study procedures.

2.4  Treatments

2.4.1.  Treatment as Usual (TAU).—All patients received treatment as usual (TAU). 
Being involved in the study did not restrict their ability to participate in other treatments 
being offered. Inpatient TAU typically involved a 5–7 day length of stay and included 
medication management (e.g., daily meetings with a psychiatrist to adjust medications), 
psychoeducation (e.g., information about mental illness, warning signs, relapse prevention, 
community resources), occupational therapy (e.g., supporting activities of daily living 
including self-care, work, and leisure skills), recreational activities (e.g., crafts, open air 
walks), and discharge planning by a social worker (e.g., identifying psychosocial needs

and scheduling appropriate aftercare appointments). All patients received a post-discharge 
appointment with a medication prescriber and were offered other services (e.g., outpatient 
counseling) based on availability and interest. Typically, patients were discharged to their 
local community mental health center or independent practitioner to receive aftercare.

2.4.2  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Inpatients (ACT-IN) 
Condition.—For a more detailed description of the treatment protocol, see Gaudiano et 
al. (2020). Patients received a variable number of ACT-IN sessions based on length of stay. 
The target dose was three individual and three group sessions over the typical one-week 
stay, and four brief phone contacts in the first month post-discharge. ACT-IN individual 
therapy included 50-minute sessions consisting of an explanation of ACT, development of 
values-based treatment goals, and practice of various ACT techniques and strategies. Group 
therapy was led by one to two facilitators and consisted of 50-minute meetings that included 
presentation of the ACT model, mindfulness/acceptance activities, and values clarification 
with goal setting. We used a rolling/open format for group sessions to accommodate 
individual admission and discharge dates, and included patients not enrolled in the study. 
In the first month post-discharge, brief (15–20 min) weekly phone sessions were provided 
by the patient’s individual inpatient therapist to aid in care transition to outpatient services. 
Therapists reviewed progress, conducted risk assessment, reviewed key principles of ACT, 
and continued valued goal setting.

2.4.3.  Time and Attention Matched (TAM) Supportive Condition.—In addition 
to TAU, patients in TAM received a target of three manualized individual support-focused 
sessions, three standard inpatient group sessions (e.g., coping with illness), and four brief 
post-discharge follow-up calls comparable in frequency and length to ACT-IN using a 
structured protocol. The rationale given to patients was that TAM would provide them with 
additional support along with their usual medical care. TAM individual sessions consisted of 
reflective listening and non-directive support (e.g., discussion of interests, symptoms, events 
preceding hospitalization, and discharge coordination). Therapists were trained to refrain 
from teaching ACT-specific strategies. During the first month post-hospitalization, TAM 
participants also received weekly, 15–20 minute phone sessions, but without ACT content. 
Phone sessions provided by the patient’s individual inpatient therapist included friendly 
conversation with reflective listening, risk assessment, and outpatient referrals if needed.

2.5.  Training and Supervision

Study assessors were trained in reliable administration of assessments, and were required 
to demonstrate interrater reliability (e.g., SCID and BPRS to interrater reliability > .80). 
Study therapists were approximately 10 hospital staff including master’s level counselors/
social workers, occupational therapists and trainees, and psychiatric nurses employed at the 
hospital. Therapists provided both treatment conditions and training involved review of the 
study treatment manuals and training materials, an initial didactic workshop (3 hours), and 
weekly supervision throughout the study by the first author. Steps were taken to minimize 
potential treatment contamination by following a specified treatment protocol that outlined 
strategies that were consistent vs inconsistent with the study interventions, providing weekly

supervision to discuss fidelity, and reviewing session recordings periodically to prevent 
therapist drift.

2.6.  Analyses

Our a priori feasibility/acceptability targets were as follows: CEQ >/= 5 (treatment 
credibility greater than 50%), CSQ >/= 24 (overall satisfied with treatment), sessions 
completed >/= 6 (total number of individual and group), attrition </= 25%, no serious 
adverse events related to study participation, approach/consent rate > 50%, and treatment 
fidelity > 80%. Multilevel modeling (MLM) was used to calculate trajectories of change and 
estimated marginal means for outcome and process measures. Analyses of variance were 
conducted via R to compare the model fit indices (−2 log likelihood difference test) with 
each additional model. Using a restricted estimated maximum likelihood (REML) estimator 
approach, we modeled trajectories of change across up to five points (baseline, discharge, 
1-month, 2-month, and 4-month follow up) separately by group. Time was nested within 
individual. We modeled the fixed effects for the linear trajectory of change using time 
as a predictor in all indices. Estimated marginal means (EMM) were obtained via REML 
estimator approach. Both time and group were included as predictors in this model, with 
time being nested within individual. Time and group were converted to factors to allow for 
calculation of EMM. Bias-corrected Hedges g effect sizes were calculated for EMM from 
baseline to 4-month follow up, with upper and lower confidence intervals included. Survival 
analysis and cox regression were conducted to compare time to rehospitalization between 
groups through 4 months.

3.  RESULTS

3.1.  Sample Characteristics

The overall sample consisted of 46 participants with an average age of 40 (SD = 11.6, range 
= 18–62). Additional demographic breakdown by condition is presented in Table 1. Chi 
square tests revealed no significant group differences (all ps > .05).

3.2.  Feasibility and Acceptability

3.2.1.  Recruitment and retention.—See Figure 1 for the participant flow diagram. 
Of 534 total inpatient charts screened, 144 potentially met study criteria (27%), of whom 
44 were discharged before they could be contacted for the study. Of the 100 patients 
approached for study participation, 48 declined and 62 consented (62%), of whom 46 
were confirmed eligible following the baseline assessment and randomized to condition. No 
patients withdrew from the treatment phase. Over the follow-up period, 6 (26%) patients 
were lost to contact in the ACT-IN condition vs 5 (21.7%) in the TAM condition (p > .05; 
see Figure 1). Bivariate correlations between follow-up and baseline variables indicated that 
only Latino/Hispanic ethnicity (r = .37, p = .012) and higher level of education (r = .37, p = 
.013) were positively correlated with increased study retention.

3.2.2.  Study and community treatment received.—See Table 1 for rates of 
treatment received across conditions. No significant differences were found by condition 
for study-related individual, group, or phone sessions completed (all ps > .05;). Rates of

post-discharge community treatments received (medication management, counseling, case 
management) also did not significantly differ across groups (all ps > .05).

3.2.3.  Treatment fidelity.—Therapist adherence/competence was assessed for a 
randomly selected subsample of individual, phone, and group sessions (n = 36) by an 
independent clinician trained to interrater reliability by the first author but not otherwise 
involved in the study. Results showed high levels of adherence (93%) and competence (M = 
5.5 out of 6; SD = 0.4) for treatment fidelity purposes.

3.2.4.  Adverse events description.—No unexpected or study-related adverse events 
were reported during the trial. No patients died or attempted suicide during follow-up. 
Psychiatric rehospitalizations (expected due to the nature of the sample and unrelated to 
study participation) are reported below.

3.2.5.  Treatment Credibility/Satisfaction.—CEQ scores showed generally high 
levels of credibility/expectancies (ACT-IN M = 6.8, SD = 1.6; TAM M = 6.0, SD = 1.8), 
with no significant difference between groups (t = 1.695, p = .097, d = .50). In addition, 
scores on the CSQ showed overall high levels of satisfaction in both conditions (ACT-IN 
M = 28.2, SD = 3.7; TAM M = 25.5, SD = 3.4). However, averaged CSQ scores were 
significantly higher in ACT-IN compared with TAM (t = 2.47, p = .018, d = .76).

3.3.  Clinical Outcomes and Processes

3.3.1.  Change over time.—See Table 2 for the descriptive statistics of measures 
collected at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up. Longitudinal analyses showed that 
both groups significantly improved across 4-month follow-up in overall symptom severity 
and psychosocial functioning, but not quality of life. Both groups also showed significant 
improvement over time in mindfulness, but only the ACT group demonstrated significant 
improvement in psychological distress. Neither condition showed significant improvement 
over time in psychological flexibility or valued living. Between-group effect sizes were 
similar in magnitude with effect sizes slightly larger in the ACT-IN condition for most 
outcomes. However, we were not able to examine differences further due to low statistical 
power.

3.3.2.  Rehospitalization rates.—By 4 months post-discharge, 17.4% (n = 4) in ACT-
IN were rehospitalized vs 39.1% (n = 9) in TAM (chi-square = 2.68, df = 1, p = .10). To 
examine the utility of the post-discharge follow-up component we added to the intervention, 
a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for those receiving at least 1 follow-up phone session 
(n = 38) showed that the TAM condition had a faster time to rehospitalization compared 
to the ACT-IN condition (log rank chi square = 6.13, df = 1, p = .013, TAM M = 86.7 
days vs ACT-IN M = 112.6 days). Using the full intent-to-treat sample, we conducted a 
cox regression analysis controlling for baseline variables that we selected post hoc because 
they are known to be associated with rehospitalization: education level, relationship status, 
disability status, gender. Results showed that patients receiving TAM had a faster time to 
rehospitalization compared to those receiving ACT-IN over follow-up (B = 1.33, SE = .65,

4.  DISCUSSION

Previous research on ACTp for inpatients has focused on the efficacy of the intervention 
using expertly trained and experienced therapists. In contrast, the current effectiveness trial 
provided ACT-IN during and immediately following an acute mental health hospitalization 
for patients with psychosis delivered by frontline hospital staff integrated into inpatient 
care. The intervention combined individual and group inpatient sessions (formats that 
are typically provided in hospitals) plus brief follow-up phone calls post-discharge 
recommended to aid in transition to outpatient services. Results of this pilot trial indicated 
that ACT-IN was feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective. To our knowledge, this is 
the first study of ACTp implemented by non-ACT specialists in the U.S., as well as the first 
RCT comparing ACTp for inpatients to use a supportive intervention that controlled for time 
and attention.

In terms of feasibility, we met all our prespecified targets. For example, we were able to 
identify sufficient numbers of patients willing to participate in the study (obtaining a study 
approach/consent rate of 62%). Rates of follow-up were comparable between conditions 
with an overall loss of 24% (due to inability to contact). Furthermore, treatment fidelity 
ratings indicated that hospital staff were able to deliver the intervention with good adherence 
(> 90%) and competence following training and minimal support. In terms of safety, no 
serious adverse events were detected that were related to study involvement. In terms 
of acceptability, we had no treatment-related withdrawals in either condition and both 
conditions were rated as highly credible by patients. However, those assigned to ACT-IN 
reported being significantly more satisfied at post-treatment compared with TAM, showing 
that patients found ACT-IN acceptable and preferrable.

Participants in both groups demonstrated significant improvements over time in symptoms 
and functioning. Patients were also engaging in other post-discharge community treatments 
(e.g., medication management, case management, psychotherapy) that likely contributed 
to the observed improved outcomes in both groups. Given the pilot nature of the study, 
modest sample size, and comparison of two credible interventions adjunctive to treatment 
as usual including medication, we did not have statistical power to examine differences on 
most clinical outcomes. Results reported in past RCTs of traditional cognitive-behavioral 
therapies for psychosis vs supportive interventions also tend to show largely overlapping 
effects (Lynch et al., 2010).

We found large effect size changes on our primary outcome of psychiatric symptoms as 
assessed by the BPRS, but similar improvement was observed in the comparison condition, 
suggesting that this measure was not as sensitive in detecting treatment differences. In 
contrast, our measure of psychological distress (CORE) showed significant improvement in 
ACT-IN but not TAM and may be a more useful for differentiating the groups in future 
studies. In addition, process measures produced mixed results, with the ACT-IN condition 
being associated with significant changes in mindfulness, but not with a general measure

of psychological flexibility or valued living, suggesting that mechanism engagement could 
be improved in the future. For example, future studies might benefit from using a psychosis-
specific measure of psychological flexibility, such as the Voices Acceptance and Action 
Scale (Shawyer et al., 2007).

Those in the comparison group had a 3.7 times greater risk of rehospitalization than 
ACT-IN, suggesting a clinically significant effect. Previous research on inpatients has 
shown that ACTp delivered by experienced ACT therapists significantly reduced risk of 
rehospitalization compared to routine care alone (Bach et al., 2013; Jacobsen et al., 2020; 
Tyrberg et al., 2017b). The present study extends these findings by showing that ACTp 
may be effective in reducing rehospitalizations when delivered by frontline clinicians, and 
when compared to an active control intervention matched for time and attention. Such 
findings indicate that ACT might have a specific effect on reducing rehospitalizations 
compared with other therapies for this population. In addition, only the ACT-IN condition 
improved over time in psychological distress, which was also reported in a previous ACTp 
inpatient RCT (Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006). Consistent with ACT theory, future research 
should explore whether symptom distress (and by extension maladaptive forms of reactivity 
to those symptoms) is a more specific mechanism related to reducing the possibility of 
rehospitalization.

To date, less work has been done studying the feasibility of ACTp for inpatients in real 
world settings. Tyrberg et al. (Tyrberg et al., 2017a) evaluated a 12-hour training program 
of ACT on inpatient staff (n = 20) and patients with psychosis (n = 9). Results supported 
the feasibility and acceptability of ACT for staff, but the investigators reported challenges 
collecting data from patients or determining outcomes. The current study is the first known 
RCT to examine the effectiveness and implementation of ACTp for inpatients.

Study strengths included the prospective randomized design, a well-specified attention-
matched control condition, blind raters, broad inclusion criteria, use of frontline clinicians, 
and integration into a real-world setting. Limitations included the modest sample size, 
limiting our ability to test for group differences. In addition, patients were receiving other 
treatments, antipsychotic medications, and a range of outpatient services, which likely 
contributed to their improvement independent on the study interventions. However, we 
controlled for time and attention in the comparison condition and therefore the effects found 
for improving rehospitalization rates in ACT-IN were beyond the effects that could be 
attributed to other treatment received. Finally, the study occurred at a single mental health 
hospital, and results may not generalize to other hospitals or regions of the U.S.

There are pros and cons to the individual level randomization we used in the current study vs 
alternative designs that randomize to units or hospital. Multi-site and/or cluster randomized 
designs may be helpful for testing the implementation of ACT-IN in future large-scale 
trials. Although it was useful to compare ACT-IN to an active control group to determine 
the specificity of rehospitalization effects, this also had several downsides (e.g., requiring 
staff to be trained in two different interventions, protecting against possible contamination 
between conditions). As an alternative, future effectiveness trials could also test the additive

5.  CONCLUSIONS

In the U.S., the average cost of one mental health hospital admission is about $7,200 
(Heslin and Weiss, 2015), and thus adjunctive interventions that can reduce unnecessary 
hospitalizations are needed. Previous research along with the current trial indicate that ACT-
IN is a promising approach that has the potential to improve meaningful patient outcomes, 
such as reducing unnecessary rehospitalizations, when delivered by routine hospital staff. 
Fully-powered, multi-site effectiveness trials of ACT-IN are needed to continue to specify 
treatment effects and to determine optimal procedures for uptake and sustainability.
