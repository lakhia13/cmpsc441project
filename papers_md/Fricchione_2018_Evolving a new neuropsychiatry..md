An evolutionary neuropsychiatry

Clinical  neuroscience  struggles  with  poor  scientific  va-
lidity of neuropsychiatric diagnosis and its negative im-
pact  on  management.  Sydenham’s  ancient  conformity 
of type approach to nosology with its assumption that 
the symptom cluster and course of a disorder are due to 
a common etiology, has proven no match for the com-
plicated comorbidities faced in neuropsychiatry. In the 
absence of accurate pathological biomarkers there is a 
challenge in finding a solid foundation for modern neu-
ropsychiatry.  We  find  standard  psychiatric  nosology  to 
be of limited benefit at the general hospital bedside in 
evaluating and treating neuropsychiatric disorders. Con-
sequently, we have developed over the years a neuro-
circuitry-based training for our psychosomatic medicine 
fellows. In this commentary, we will introduce a strategy 
for understanding patients with neuropsychiatric disor-
ders that may advance our ability to diagnose and treat 
them  in  accordance  with  neuroscientific  evidence  an-
chored  in  evolutionary  neurocircuitry  and  attachment 
neurobehavior.

findings.10-12 Psychiatric nosology is of limited benefit in 
evaluating  and  treating  neuropsychiatric  disorders  in 
the general hospital. This realization led us to develop 
a neurocircuitry training program for fellows based on 
the science of brain evolution.
  Tinbergen urged scientists interested in understand-
ing any biological or psychological process to ask four 
questions.13  How  does  the  process  work?  How  did  it 
develop? What is it for? How did it evolve? By asking 
Tinbergen’s four questions and combining two founda-
tional  principles  that  emerge  in  the  course  of  answer-
ing  them,  we  may  build  a  neuropsychiatric  nosology 
capable of providing greater diagnostic understanding 
regardless of complex comorbidities.
  Evolutionary  brain  biology  depicts  life’s  unfolding 
as  a  sensory-motor  analyzer-effecter  entity.14  Because 
fitness may be defined in terms of attachment solutions 
to separation challenges, natural selection has sculpted 
a specialized organ to focus functions on human life’s 
four  attachment-based  objectives  (metabolic  energy, 
sexual, social, and future objects).15 These functions are 
manifested through neurocircuitry allowing for discern-
ment of brain form and function.
  While  wrestling  with  Tinbergen’s  questions,  two 
foundational  principles  emerge.  The  first  recognizes 
what  the  brain’s  workplan  is  and  how  it  developed. 
In  the  brain,  we  see  evidence  of  the  sensory-motor 
analyzer-effecter  bauplan  (body  plan)  in  the  cortico-
striato-thalamo-cortical  loops  that  are  segregated  yet 
integrated for the purpose of deciding whether to avoid 
or approach, separate or attach.16 This first foundational 
principle also hints at how the brain evolved its bauplan 
to  accomplish  what  it  is  for.  Indeed,  the  performance 
demands of brain function as prescribed by natural se-
lection gave rise to brain form. 

In  a  meta-analysis  based  on  voxel-based  mor-
phometry  (VBM)  studies,  six  major  neuropsychiatric 
disorders—schizophrenia,  bipolar  illness,  depression, 
obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  anxiety  and  addic-
tion—showed  a  common  defect  called  the VBM  psy-
chiatric core, centered in the dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex (dACC)/anterior insula network.17 This network 
is central to analyzer-effecter functioning and is key to 
response selection. The brain actively constructs infer-
ences based on sensory data to predict future rewards 
leading  to  approach  or  avoidance  response  selections 
via  the  dACC  and  other  PFC  zones.18  The  VBM  re-
searchers  suggest  that  this  psychiatric  core  “concor-

dance  provides  an  organizing  model  that  emphasizes 
the importance of shared neural substrates across psy-
chopathology, despite likely diverse etiologies, which is 
currently not an explicit component of psychiatric no-
sology.”17 In another recent study, conjunction analysis 
showed smaller VBM psychiatric core volumes in sub-
jects with major depression and bipolar disorder, lend-
ing support to this notion.19  

Some  of  the  sensory-motor  neural  networks  are 
confined  to  primary  sensory  and  motor  cortex  termi-
nal zones. Analyzer-effecter networks spread out across 
many brain regions, allowing for more integrative func-
tioning. Several lines of integration are postulated. There 
is convergence of terminals from functionally proximate 
cortical  areas  onto  increasingly  more  confined  basal 
ganglia structures resulting in an interpenetration of sig-
nals.20,21  In  addition,  information  from  the  motivational 
system can reach the motor system through a series of 
interconnections.  Information  in  the  “paralimbic”  and 
“limbic”  basal  ganglia-thalamo-cortical  circuits  and  in-
formation  within  the  “motor”  basal  ganglia-thalamo-
cortical circuit come together to enable the organism to 
effect  an  appropriate  avoidance-approach  response  to 
sensory stimulation. This occurs when the ventral stria-
tum receives input from the paralimbic medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC) and in turn projects to a midbrain region 
that feedforwards to the central associative striatum. The 
central striatum then projects in part to a section of the 
substantia  nigra,  which  connects  with  the  dorsolateral 
motor striatum.20,22 Haber and Calzavara20 conclude that 
cortex “exploits” basal ganglia as an additional proces-
sor forming a central selection-effecter mechanism that 
enhances  decision-making  in  the  service  of  attachment 
goal-directed behaviors and habits. 
  One important integrative neural network is the de-
fault-mode network (DMN).23,24 It has nodes in mPFC, 
posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC),  precuneus,  and  lat-
eral  parietal  cortex.  The  DMN  mediates  self-focused 
introspective  and  prospective  thinking.  Another  net-
work looks outward and is known as the task-positive 
network  and  includes  the  frontoparietal  central  execu-
tive sub-network (CEN), which is important for work-
ing  memory  and  attention.  Another  task-positive 
subnetwork  is  the  anterior  cingulo-insular  network 
(aCIN)  or  salience  network,  which  overlaps  with  the 
VBM psychiatric core (left and right insular cortex and 
dACC also known as the midcingulate [MCC]).25 Much 
of neuropsychopathology emerges from dissolution of 

142

aCIN (implicit) and CEN (explicit) emotion regulation 
pathways,  which  emanate  from  the  ventral  ACC  and 
medial orbital frontal ventromedial PFC in the former 
case  and  from  the  dACC/MCC  and  the  dorsolateral 
PFC (dlPFC) in the latter case, to provide circuit-based 
control  of  the  amygdalar  fear  conditioning  separation 
stress pathway. This dissolution may come from disrup-
tions  in  point-to-point  channel  connectome  functions 
leading  to  neurological  defects  in  informational  con-
tent flow and/or from state shifting modulatory system 
psychiatric dysfunctions leading to deficits in the state 
of information processing. Modulatory systems include 
neurotransmitter,  neurohormone,  and  neuroimmune 
cytokine impacts on these neural node terminals via the 
brain  reward  and  motivation  circuitries  in  the  medial 
forebrain bundle (MFB) as well as frontocerebellar and 
dorsal  diencephalic  habenular  tract  influences.26-28  A 
strategy for assessing loop channel and state function-
ing at the bedside or in the clinic becomes an integral 
part of the neuropsychiatric exam. For example, inter-
rogating MFB dopamine tracts entails monitoring eye 
blink rate and speech latency.
  The second foundational principle defines the rela-
tionship between separation challenge and attachment 
solution. Because fitness can be defined in these terms, 
the brain has been sculpted to focus its form and struc-
ture  on  the  four  attachment-based  objectives  of  life 
mentioned  above.  This  understanding  helps  us  assess 
how individuals perform when experiencing amygdalar 
stress. 
  Bowlby contended that human evolutionary adapt-
edness  was  sourced  in  an  environment  of  secure  base 
attachment.29,30  Recently  a  transdiagnostic  model  of 
psychopathology  based  on  Bowlby’s  attachment  be-
havioral system has emerged.31 There are mechanisms 
through  which  epigenetically  developed  attachment 
dispositions serve as transdiagnostic risk factors when 
insecure attachment, be it attachment anxiety or avoid-
ance, becomes the residual internal working model for 
self and the world perhaps reflecting DMN and aCIN 
disconnection. MacLean cited the ACC as the hub for 
what  he  called  the  mammalian  behavioral  triad  com-
prised  of  key  attachment  sustaining  behaviors—the 
separation  cry,  maternal  nurturance,  and  play.32  This 
may tie in the VBM psychiatric core in the first founda-
tional principle with the second foundational principle. 
Thus,  attachment-based  transdiagnostic  risk  factors 
may mediate pathways that set the stage for so-called 

“multifinality” in which the attachment risk factor leads 
to multiple disorders.33
  Analyzing  separation  stress  and  implementing  at-
tachment solutions is integral to caregiving. If we exam-
ine  anxiety  based  in  separation  threat  and  depression 
based in attachment loss according to these principles, 
we discover particular subset neural network dysfunc-
tions.34 The DMN may contribute to maladaptive rumi-
nation and negative thinking as an endophenotype; the 
aCIN  salience  circuit  may  produce  social  anxiety  and 
panic  as  well  as  depression;  the  cingulo-opercular  sub 
circuit may play a role in anxious avoidance; the nega-
tive affect circuit (mPFC, ACC, vmPFC, hippocampus, 
insula,  and  amygdala)  may  mediate  negative  bias  and 
implicit separation threat dysregulation; the positive af-
fect circuit (mPFC, mOFC, nucleus accumbens, ventral 
striatum, VTA) may mediate an anhedonia endopheno-
type  when  dysfunctional;  the  attention  circuit  (medial 
superior frontal cortices, anterior insula, anterior infe-
rior parietal lobe, and precuneus) may contribute to in-
attentiveness; and a disordered cognitive control circuit 
(dlPFC,  dACC,  dorsal  parietal  cortex,  and  precentral 
gyrus), may lead to an explicit inability to dampen de-
fault mode rumination. A similar analysis can be made 
for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases.35,36
  These sensory-motor analyzer-effector malfunctions 
disturb a patient’s ability to separate or attach expedi-
tiously, efficiently, and effectively. In this dysfunctional 
matrix, we can begin to see analyzable biological mark-
ings that correlate with the dimensions of neuropsychi-
atric disorders. 
  By using our own segregated yet integrated analyz-
er-effecter capacity, we neuropsychiatrists can endeav-
or, with our patients, to effect an attachment solution to 
their illness separation challenge.15  

Conclusion

Embedding neuropsychiatry in the dual principles of evo-
lutionary  neuroanatomy  and  attachment  theory  should 
be  a  priority.  Our  diagnostic  tasks  require  attention  to 
two foundational principles, ie, neurology anchored in an 
understanding  of  brain  evolution  and  psychiatry  based 
on the concept of separation challenge and attachment 
solution decision-making. Building the capacity of neu-
ropsychiatrists  to  ask  the  Tinbergen  questions  and  to 
link up foundational principles with the mechanisms on 
which they are based can create brain doctors capable of 

143

anchoring their diagnoses in a scientific safe harbor and 
of providing healing care. It is the evolution of the brain’s 
neurocircuitry that has led to the meaningful experience 
of separation stress and attachment loss that fuels neuro-
psychiatric dysfunction and distress.
  After  decades  studying  brain  evolution,  MacLean 
concluded  in  an  inscription  in  his  magnum  opus,  The 

Triune Brain, that separation is “the most painful mam-
malian  condition.” We  would  do  well  to  take  heed  in 
developing a solid foundation for neuropsychiatry. q

Evolucionando hacia una nueva neuropsiquiatría

Élaborer une nouvelle neuropsychiatrie

Las  neurociencias  clínicas  luchan  contra  una  pobre  va-
lidación  científica  del  diagnóstico  neuropsiquiátrico  y 
su  impacto  negativo  sobre  el  manejo.  La  antigua  con-
formidad  de  Sydenham  con  el  tipo  de  aproximación  a 
la nosología, asumiendo que el grupo de síntomas y el 
curso de un trastorno se deben a una etiología común, 
no ha demostrado ser compatible con  las complicadas 
comorbilidades que enfrenta la neuropsiquiatría. En au-
sencia de biomarcadores patológicos precisos existe un 
desafío  para  encontrar  bases  sólidas  para  la  moderna 
neuropsiquiatría. Se cuenta con una nosología psiquiá-
trica  estándar  que  es  de  beneficio  limitado  para  pa-
cientes  del  hospital  general  respecto  a  la  evaluación  y 
el tratamiento de los trastornos neuropsiquiátricos. En 
consecuencia, a través de los años se ha desarrollado un 
entrenamiento para los residentes de medicina psicoso-
mática en base a circuitos neurales. En este artículo bre-
ve, se presentará una estrategia para la comprensión de 
pacientes con trastornos neuropsiquiátricos que puede 
mejorar nuestra capacidad para diagnosticarlos y tratar-
los de acuerdo con evidencia neurocientífica sustentada 
en circuitos neurales evolutivos y en las bases neurocon-
ductuales del apego.   

Les  neurosciences  cliniques  sont  en  conflit  avec  la  mé-
diocre validité scientifique du diagnostic neuropsychia-
trique et son impact négatif sur la prise en charge. La 
nosologie  ancienne  de  type  Sydenham,  postulant  que 
l’étiologie des groupes de symptômes et de l’évolution 
de la maladie est commune, a montré qu’elle ne s’ap-
pliquait pas aux comorbidités compliquées rencontrées 
en neuropsychiatrie. Il est difficile de trouver une base 
solide  pour  la  neuropsychiatrie  moderne  en  l’absence 
de biomarqueurs pathologiques précis. Au lit du malade 
à  l’hôpital,  la  nosologie  psychiatrique  standard  est  de 
peu d’aide pour évaluer et traiter les troubles psychia-
triques.  Nous  avons  donc  développé  au  fil  des  années 
un  enseignement  basé  sur  les  circuits  neurologiques 
pour nos confrères de médecine psychosomatique. Nous 
présentons  dans  ce  commentaire  une  stratégie  pour 
comprendre les patients atteints de troubles neuropsy-
chiatriques, qui pourrait améliorer nos capacités de dia-
gnostic et de traitement en accord avec les preuves neu-
roscientifiques  enracinées  dans  l’évolution  des  circuits 
neurologiques et les comportements neurologiques de 
l’attachement.
