Abstract
The purpose of this study was to explore exposure to trauma as well as demographic and psychosocial factors as predictors of
mental health symptoms among Somali refugees in Kenya. Participants were recruited via snowball sampling to complete a
survey and included 86 Somali refugee youth, aged 15 to 34 years, who were living in Eastleigh. We measured trauma using a
total traumas experienced variable as well as four trauma types categories (pre-migration/migration trauma, post-migration
trauma, family trauma, and individual trauma). We measured anxiety and depression symptoms using the Hopkins Symptom
Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and PTSD using the PTSD Check List – Civilian Version (PCL-C). We ran descriptive statistics
followed by multiple linear regression models with trauma exposure, education, gender, and willingness to share problems as
predictors of mental health symptoms. Out of 12 possible traumatic events, most participants (83.7%) reported experiencing at
least one trauma, and participants reported experiencing an average of 3.76 total traumas. The regression models predicted
between 11.5% and 35.5% of the variance of the mental health symptoms. Willingness to share problems was a significant
predictor of decreased mental health symptoms in most models. These findings highlight the role of trauma exposure and
psychosocial factors in predicting Somali refugee mental health and indicate that implementing programs to encourage problem
sharing may help address Somali refugee mental health needs. Further research is needed to explore the differential impact of
trauma exposure and various psychosocial factors on Somali refugee mental health.

Background

Over two million Somalis have been forcefully displaced
since the Somali civil war in 1991 and its aftermath which
has caused chaos and social conflict in the country for decades
(United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR]
2017). Approximately 1.5 million people are internally
displaced in Somalia, and nearly 900,000 Somalis are refu-
gees, the majority of whom have fled to neighboring countries
including Kenya, Yemen, and Ethiopia (UNHCR 2017;
UNHCR 2020). Throughout forced migration, Somali refu-
gees experience high levels of trauma, violence, and resource
loss (Betancourt et al. 2015; Im et al. 2017; de Jong et al.
2011; Onyut et al. 2009). Existing research suggests that,

among Somali refugees, this exposure to trauma predicts com-
mon mental disorders (CMDs), including depression, anxiety,
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Bentley 2010; Bhui
et al. 2003; Ellis et al. 2008; Feyera et al. 2015; Im et al. 2017).
In fact, Somali refugees are at high risk for CMDs, with re-
search indicating that between 4 and 48% of Somali refugees
experience PTSD (Ellis et al. 2008; Ellis et al. 2010; Gerritsen
et al. 2006; Onyut et al. 2009) and about one-third experience
depression (Feyera et al. 2015). The United Nations Refugee
Agency (UNHCR; 2016) acknowledges that, although mental
health prevalence rates vary across studies, much research
indicates that Somali refugees experience high levels of
PTSD in particular (e.g., de Jong et al. 2011; Ellis et al.
2008; Ellis et al. 2010; Onyut et al. 2009).

Mental health research with Somali refugees has focused
broadly on exposure to pre-migration trauma (e.g., de Jong
et al. 2011; Feyera et al. 2015), including war exposure, ex-
periences of violence in the home country, and forced migra-
tion in refugee camp settings (e.g., Feyera et al. 2015) or while
still in Somalia (e.g., de Jong et al. 2011). Additionally, some

322

research has explored resettlement/acculturation stressors in
resettlement contexts (e.g, Ellis et al. 2008). However, refugee
trauma experiences are multifaceted and cumulative (Carlsson
and Sonne 2018; Kira et al. 2019; McDonald et al. 2019), and
therefore, the divergent impacts of varied types of trauma
should be acknowledged in exploring refugee mental health
outcomes. This is especially relevant when considering somat-
ic pains and emotional distress that are pervasive and yet less
detectable in refugee populations (Bentley 2010; Rohlof et al.
2014). Those studies that have considered both pre-migration
trauma exposure and resettlement stressors (Ellis et al.
2010; Lincoln et al. 2016) have been conducted in US
resettlement contexts, leaving a gap in knowledge relat-
ed to the impact of multifaceted trauma exposure on
Somali refugees in other contexts.

Most importantly, despite the high prevalence of CMDs
among Somali populations (Ellis et al. 2008; Ellis et al.
2010; Feyera et al. 2015; Gerritsen et al. 2006; Onyut et al.
2009), research with Somali refugees has emphasized the im-
pact of trauma on PTSD symptoms (see de Jong et al. 2011;
Giacco et al. 2018) while leaving a gap in the understanding of
the impact of psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, coping
style, willingness to share problems and seek help). Some
studies have investigated the impact of psychosocial factors
on mental health among Arab, Mexican, Korean, and general
immigrants to the US, Canada, Germany, and Australia, indi-
cating that lack of social support predicts mental health prob-
lems (Alhasanat-Khalil et al. 2018; Aroian et al. 2017; Kung
et al. 2003; Puyat2013 ; Roh 2010; Sierau et al. 2019), and
type of coping style predicts mental health outcomes (Kung
et al. 2003; McGregor et al. 2015). A few studies have inves-
tigated these factors with Somali refugees, finding that Somali
refugee youth may conceal their desire for support from others
despite friend, family, and community support being central to
their coping (Kaliniecka 2012) and finding that social
support
interventions can improve perceived support,
social integration, loneliness, and coping (Stewart et al.
2011). Further research is needed to determine whether
these psychosocial factors may serve as risk or protec-
tive factors for Somali refugees.

In addition, many scholars have attempted to explain how
refugee help-seeking and willingness to share their problems
can affect mental health outcomes (Ampadu 2016; Han and
Oliffe 2015; Patel2003 ; Sachs et al. 2008; Straiton et al. 2018;
Yorke et al. 2014), but a small number of studies have been
conducted with Somali refugees (e.g., Markova and Sandal
2016; Rae 2014; T homas2008). These studies suggest that
immigrants to Western countries fear perceived stigma asso-
ciated with mental health problems (Han and Oliffe 2015;
Patel 2003; Straiton et al. 2018; Yorke et al. 2014) and are
often reluctant to share such problems with others, often pre-
ferring to self-manage their problems (Han and Oliffe 2015;
Patel 2003). When immigrants and refugees (Ampadu 2016;

Sachs et al. 2008), including Somali refugees (Markova and
Sandal 2016; Rae 2014; Thomas 2008), do seek help, they
often report a preference to share their problems with informal
support systems, such as family members or religious leaders,
rather than healthcare professionals. Furthermore, qualitative
research suggests that Somali refugee communities have “a
strong culture of sharing” and highly value sharing in all as-
pects of life, including food, information, resources, money,
religion, and culture, believing that socializing and sharing is a
cultural health asset which helps people prevent and cope with
mental illness (Lightfoot et al. 2016, p.252). Using this infor-
mation, we can begin to understand the relationship between
psychosocial factors and mental health among refugees; how-
ever, more research is needed to determine whether these re-
lationships are present in Somali refugee samples and to better
understand the complexities associated with psychosocial fac-
tors such as social support and willingness to share problems.

Study Purpose

The purpose of this study was to explore how psychosocial
factors increase or decrease the risk of common mental health
symptoms. We controlled for gender and level of education,
as existing research suggests that trauma exposure and mental
health symptoms differ based on refugee gender and educa-
tion (e.g., Bhui et al. 2006; Ellis et al. 2010; Rasmussen et al.
2010; Young and Chan 2015). The following research ques-
tion guided our study: Among Somali refugees living in urban
Kenya, do trauma exposure (total number of traumas, pre-
migration/migration trauma, post-migration trauma, family
trauma, and individual trauma), education, gender, and will-
ingness to share problems predict mental health (depression,
anxiety, and PTSD) symptoms? We hypothesized that greater
willingness to share problems would predict lower mental
health symptoms while also considering trauma exposure, lev-
el of education, and gender.

Methods

Participants and Procedure

In Kenya, many Somali refugees live in urban settings, such as
Nairobi, where they move in search of improved livelihoods,
employment, education, family reunification, and a sense of
community (Pavanello et al. 2010). The current study was
conducted in partnership with a community-based organiza-
tion and local clinic in an area of Eastleigh, in Nairobi, Kenya,
known as “little Mogadishu.” This area is highly populated by
Somali refugees who have experienced high levels of commu-
nity violence and trauma related to war, political chaos in
Somalia, internal clan conflicts, and xenophobia (Im et al.

2017). Participants were recruited via snowball sampling in a
local clinic and included 86 Somali refugee youth, aged 15 to
34 years, who were living in Eastleigh (M = 19.37, SD =
3.16). Because definitions of “youth” vary based on the de-
fining organization, we used The African Youth Charter def-
inition of youth, including participants up to 35 years old
(United Nations Educational Scientific, and Cultural
Organization 2016). This research was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the authors’ institution. In order
to include local perspectives and ensure the protection of par-
ticipants, the research protocol and materials, including re-
cruitment strategies and survey questionnaires, were also
reviewed and approved by a community advisory board
consisting of local service providers (i.e., doctors and coun-
selors) and community leaders in Eastleigh.

Measures

Our community partners administered the survey at their facili-
ties in Eastleigh, allowing participants to self-complete the ques-
tionnaire, which consisted of four sections: (a) trauma exposure,
(b) mental health symptoms, (c) psychosocial factors, and (d)
demographics. All measures were translated from English to
Somali by local clinic staff. Both English and Somali versions
were provided, allowing each participant to choose the language
in which they preferred to complete the survey.

Trauma Exposure We measured four different categories of
trauma exposure, which consists of the most prevailing types
of traumatic events identified by the community advisory
board. Each trauma category measured exposure to three trau-
ma events, with a total of 12 traumatic events assessed in this
study (war trauma, refugee camp, forced displacement, injury
from violence, exposure to violence, police harassment, loss
of family, exposure to domestic violence, child abuse, kidnap-
ping, sexual abuse, and serious accident). For each of these 12
items, participants checked whether they had experienced this
type of trauma, with responses coded as: not experienced = 0
and yes experienced = 1. Cronbach’s alpha indicated that in
the current sample, the estimate of internal consistency for the
12 trauma exposure items was 0.713.

Pre-Migration/Migration Trauma The pre-migration/migra-
tion trauma variable was created by summing dichotomized
versions (0 = not experienced, 1 = yes experienced) of war
trauma, refugee camp, and forced displacement. This created
a continuous variable with a theoretical range of 0 to 3.

Post-Migration Trauma The post-migration trauma variable
was created by summing dichotomized versions (0 = not ex-
perienced, 1 = yes experienced) of injury from violence, ex-
posure to violence, and police harassment. This created a con-
tinuous variable with a theoretical range of 0 to 3.

Family Trauma The family trauma variable was created by
summing dichotomized versions (0 = not experienced, 1 =
yes experienced) of loss of family, exposure to domestic vio-
lence, and child abuse. This created a continuous variable with
a theoretical range of 0 to 3.

Individual Trauma The individual trauma variable was created
by summing dichotomized versions (0 = not experienced, 1 =
yes experienced) of kidnapping, sexual abuse, and serious
accident. This created a continuous variable with a theoretical
range of 0 to 3.

Total Traumas Experienced The total traumas experienced var-
iable was created by summing all four types of trauma. This
created a continuous variable with a theoretical range of 0 to 12.

Demographic and Psychosocial Factors Education was
assessed through an open-ended question asking participants
how many years of education they had received from religious
or secular schools. Gender was assessed using a dichotomous
item with answer choices male (=1) and female (=0). The
willingness to share problems variable was calculated by sum-
ming how much participants agreed with three items: (a) “I
can talk about my problems with my friends,” (b) “I can talk
about my problems with my family,” and (c) “I can talk about
my problems with people other than my family or friends -
such as teachers, religious leaders, or health professionals.”
For each of these three items, participants were asked how
much they agreed with the statement on a range from not at
all (=0) to almost always (=4). Summing these three items
created a continuous variable with a theoretical range of 0 to
12. Cronbach’s alpha indicated that in the current sample, the
estimate of internal consistency for the three willingness to
share problems items was 0.768.

We also measured other psychosocial factors including
problem-solving and sense of community. Each of the items
used to assess these variables used response options ranging
from not at all (=0) to almost always (=4). Problem-solving
was assessed by summing five items (α = 0.834): (a) “I ener-
getically pursue my goals,” (b) “I learn and grow from hard-
ships,” (c) “I can think of many ways to solve and get out of a
problem,” (d) “I feel confident and competent in dealing with
daily issues,” and (e) “I can keep myself calm any time.” This
created a problem-solving variable with a theoretical range of
0 to 20. Sense of community was assessed by summing eleven
items partially adopted from Adapted Social Capital
Assessment Tool (A-SCAT; Harpham et al. 2002; Thomas
2003). This created a variable with a theoretical range of 0
to 44 (α = 0.892). The items include questions about how they
value their community and feel valued in the community, such
as “People in my community are willing to help each other”
and “I feel valued by my community” (full list of items avail-
able upon request).

Mental Health Symptoms We assessed participants’ mental
health symptoms with three variables: depression symptoms,
anxiety symptoms, and PTSD symptoms. These measures of
mental health symptoms were included as dependent variables
in our analyses. For each of the items assessing mental health
symptoms, a 5-point Likert-type scale was used in
which participants responded not at all (=0) to almost
always (=4). Additionally, a visual scale of glasses
filled with various amounts of water was adopted from
Terheggen et al. (2001) in order to aid participants in
responding using a Likert-type scale.

Depression Symptoms We assessed depression symptoms
with 15 items, using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25
(HSCL-25). This measure has been used previously to assess
mental health symptoms among Somali and refugee popula-
tions (e.g., Gerritsen et al. 2006; Jakobsen et al. 2017; Wind
et al. 2017). These 15 items were summed, producing the
depression symptoms variable, with a theoretical range from
0 to 60. Cronbach’s alpha indicated that in the current sample,
the estimate of internal consistency for the 17 depression
symptom items was 0.899.

Anxiety Symptoms We assessed anxiety symptoms with nine
items, which were also adapted from the HSCL-25. These
nine items were summed, producing the anxiety symp-
toms variable, with a theoretical range from 0 to 36.
Cronbach’s alpha indicated that
in the current sample,
the estimate of internal consistency for the 17 anxiety
symptom items was 0.842.

PTSD Symptoms We assessed PTSD symptoms with 17 items,
which were adapted from the PTSD Check List – Civilian
Version (PCL-C). This measure is commonly used to assess
and screen for PTSD among refugee populations, including
Somali refugees (e.g., Robertson et al. 2006; Yeomans et al.
2010). The 17 items were summed, producing the PTSD
symptoms variable, with a theoretical range from 0 to 68.
Cronbach’s alpha indicated that in the current sample, the
estimate of internal consistency for the 17 PTSD symptom
items was 0.898.

Data Analysis

First, we conducted descriptive analysis to understand our sam-
ple characteristics. Then, we used linear regression analyses to
examine the associations between trauma and mental health
symptoms, while controlling for demographic and psychosocial
factors. We ran a total of 15 regression models, controlling for
education, gender, and willingness to share problems in each
model. In each of the first three models, one for each mental
health symptoms variable (model 1A: depression symptoms,
model 1B: anxiety symptoms, and model 1C: PTSD symptoms),

we included all four trauma types (pre-migration/migration trau-
ma, post-migration trauma, family trauma, and individual trau-
ma). Then, in order to begin to tease apart the influence of the
four trauma types, we ran four separate models with each indi-
vidual trauma type for each of the three mental health variables
(depression symptoms: models 2A-2D; anxiety symptoms:
models 3A-3D; PTSD symptoms: models 4A-4D). We initially
included two other psychosocial factors in these models (prob-
lem-solving and sense of community), which were not included
in our final models due to non-significance.

Results

Descriptive Results

The mean age for this sample was 19.37, and 53.09% of partic-
ipants were female. The majority of participants reported speak-
ing Somali (83.72%), and participants also reported speaking
Swahili (56.98%), English (58.14%), Sheng (25.58%), and other
languages (8.14%). Participants reported an average of 9.72 years
of education and an average of 9.11 years living in Eastleigh. On
a scale of one to five, they rated their physical health status as an
average of 3.99. The mean depression symptoms score was
14.83 (theoretical range of 0–60), the mean anxiety symptoms
score was 8.24 (theoretical range of 0–36), and the mean PTSD
symptoms score was 17.15 (theoretical range of 0–68). These
descriptive findings are shown in Table 1.

Out of 12 possible traumatic events, most participants
(83.7%) reported experiencing at least one trauma, and partic-
ipants reported experiencing an average of 3.76 total traumas.
When these traumas were grouped into four trauma types,
each with a theoretical range of zero to three, participants
reported experiencing an average of 1.09 pre-migration/mi-
gration traumas, 1.27 post-migration traumas, 1.01 family
traumas, and 0.38 individual traumas. Men experienced a
higher average of each of these trauma types than women.
These descriptive findings are shown in Table 2.

Linear Regression Results

Combined Trauma Types (Models 1A-1C) We ran a total of 15
linear regression models. The first three models included all
four trauma types (pre-migration/migration trauma, post-
migration trauma, family trauma, and individual trauma) as
predictors of mental health symptoms. In model 1A, with an
adjusted R2 of 0.289 (F7,55 = 4.60, p < 0.001), depression
symptoms scores were significantly associated with pre-mi-
gration/migration trauma (B = 3.66, p = 0.011) and willing-
ness to share problems (B = −2.33, p = 0.040) but not signifi-
cantly associated with post-migration (B = 1.33, p = 0.449),
family (B = 2.98, p = 0.081), and individual trauma (B =
−1.73, p = 0.516).

In model 1B, with an adjusted R2 of 0.309 (F7,54 = 4.90,
p < 0.001), anxiety symptoms scores were significantly asso-
ciated with education (B = 0.644, p = 0.010) and gender (B =
−4.52, p = 0.004) but not with any of the trauma types (pre-
migration/migration trauma B = 1.19, p = 0.100; post-
migration trauma B = 0.43, p = 0.635; family trauma B =
1.57, p = 0.073; individual trauma B = 0.72, p = 0.596). In
model 1C, with an adjusted R2 0.355 (F7,55 = 5.87,
p < 0.001), PTSD symptoms scores were significantly associ-
ated with pre-migration/migration trauma (B = 1.74, p =
0.001) and family trauma (B = 3.31, p = 0.047), as well as
education (B = 0.97, p = 0.040) and willingness to share prob-
lems (B = −2.29, p = 0.038). Table 3 shows the results of these
three linear regression models.

Separated Trauma Types (Models 2A-2D, 3A-3D, 4A-4D) Next,
we aimed to tease apart the influence of the four trauma types
by running four separate models with each individual trauma
type for each of the three mental health symptoms variables.

Depression Symptoms In models 2A-2D (shown in Table 4),
the depression symptoms variable was regressed on educa-
tion, gender, and willingness to share problems as well as
trauma type (pre-migration/migration in model 2A, post-
migration in model 2B, family trauma in model 2C, and indi-
vidual trauma in model 2D. In model 2A, with an adjusted R2
of 0.268 (F4,58 = 6.68, p < 0.001), depression symptoms
scores were significantly associated with pre-migration/migra-
tion trauma (B = 4.68, p = 0.001), education (B = 1.25, p =
0.006), and willingness to share problems (B = −2.80, p =
0.013) but not significantly associated with gender (B =
−3.39, p = 0.239).

In model 2B, with an adjusted R2 of 0.173 (F4,58 = 4.25,
p = 0.004), depression symptoms scores were significantly as-
sociated with post-migration trauma (B = 3.48, p = 0.035) and
willingness to share problems (B = −2.65, p = 0.027) but not
significantly associated with education (B = 0.96, p = 0.050)
or gender (B = −3.97, p = 0.198). In model 2C, with an adjust-
ed R2 of 0.215 (F4,58 = 5.24, p = 0.001), depression symptoms
scores were significantly associated with family trauma (B =

4.34, p = 0.007) and willingness to share problems (B = −2.37,
p = 0.044) but not significantly associated with education
(B = 0.76, p = 0.116) or gender (B = −2.99, p = 0.315). In
model 2D, with an adjusted R2 of 0.115 (F4,58 = 3.01, p =
0.025), depression symptoms scores were significantly asso-
ciated with education (B = 1.17, p = 0.019) and willingness to
share problems (B = −2.94, p = 0.018) but were not signifi-
cantly associated with individual trauma (B = 1.83, p =
0.489) or gender (B = −3.77, p = 0.248).

Anxiety Symptoms In models 3A-3D (shown in Table 5), the
anxiety symptoms variable was regressed on education, gen-
der, and willingness to share problems as well as trauma type
(pre-migration/migration in model 3A, post-migration in
model 3B, family trauma in model 3C, and individual trauma
in model 3D. In model 3A, with an adjusted R2 of 0.268
(F4,58 = 6.68, p < 0.001), anxiety symptoms scores were sig-
nificantly associated with pre-migration/migration trauma
(B = 4.68, p = 0.001), education (B = 1.25, p = 0.006), and
willingness to share problems (B = −2.80, p = 0.013) but not
significantly associated with gender (B = −3.39, p = 0.239).

In model 3B, with an adjusted R2 of 0.239 (F4,57 = 5.78,
p = 0.001), anxiety symptoms scores were significantly asso-
ciated with post-migration trauma (B = 1.67, p = 0.048) and
education (B = 0.69, p = 0.006), and gender (B = −4.58, p =
0.004) but not significantly associated with willingness to
share problems (B = −0.90, p = 0.137). In model 3C, with an
adjusted R2 of 0.296 (F4,57 = 7.41, p < 0.001), anxiety symp-
toms scores were significantly associated with family trauma
(B = 2.28, p = 0.004), education (B = 0.58, p = 0.017), and
gender (B = −4.05, p = 0.007) but not significantly associated
with willingness to share problems (B = −0.77, p = 0.186). In
model 3D, with an adjusted R2 of 0.223 (F4,57 = 5.38, p =
0.001), anxiety symptoms scores were significantly associated
with education (B = 0.81, p = 0.001) and gender (B = −4.83,

p = 0.004) but were not significantly associated with individ-
ual trauma (B = 2.18, p = 0.096) or willingness to share prob-
lems (B = −1.10, p = 0.070).

PTSD Symptoms In models 4A-4D (shown in Table 6), the
PTSD symptoms variable was regressed on education, gender,
and willingness to share problems as well as trauma type (pre-
migration/migration in model 4A, post-migration in model
4B, family trauma in model 4C, and individual trauma in
model 4D. In model 4A, with an adjusted R2 of 0.333
(F4,58 = 8.74, p < 0.001), PTSD symptoms scores were signif-
icantly associated with pre-migration/migration trauma (B =
5.62, p < 0.001), education (B = 1.35, p = 0.003), and willing-
ness to share problems (B = −2.78, p = 0.012) but not signifi-
cantly associated with gender (B = −3.70, p = 0.189).

In model 4B, with an adjusted R2 of 0.166 (F4,58 = 4.09,
p = 0.005), PTSD symptoms scores were significantly associ-
ated with education (B = 1.05, p = 0.037) and willingness to
share problems (B = −2.66, p = 0.031) but not significantly
associated with post-migration trauma (B = 3.24, p = 0.055)
or gender (B = −4.20, p = 0.185). In model 4C, with an adjust-
ed R2 of 0.230 (F4,58 = 5.64, p = 0.001), PTSD symptoms
scores were significantly associated with family trauma (B =
4.67, p = 0.004) but not significantly associated with educa-
tion (B = 0.81, p = 0.099), gender (B = −3.25, p = 0.281), or
willingness to share problems (B = −2.32, p = 0.051). In mod-
el 4D, with an adjusted R2 of 0.115 (F4,58 = 3.02, p = 0.025),
PTSD symptoms scores were significantly associated with
education (B = 1.25, p = 0.015) and willingness to share prob-
lems (B = −2.92, p = 0.021) but were not significantly associ-
ated with individual trauma (B = 1.40, p = 0.607) or gender
(B = −3.92, p = 0.242).

Non-significant Findings We also ran versions of the models
1A, 1B, and 1C that included two additional psychosocial

factors: problem-solving and sense of community. However,
the psychosocial factor coefficients were not significant in any
of these models, and the overall model fit appeared poorer for
these models (depression: adjusted R2 = 0.267, F9,53 = 3.51,
p = 0.002; anxiety: adjusted R2 = 0.285, F9,52 = 3.71, p =
0.001; PTSD: adjusted R2 = 0.361, F9,53 = 4.89, p < 0.001).
As such, these psychosocial factors are not included in our
final models reported above (results available per request).

Discussion

The current study explored how trauma and psychoso-
cial factors impact risk of common mental health symp-
toms among Somali refugees living in urban Kenya.
The results indicated that, among this Somali refugee
sample, willingness to share problems was a significant
psychosocial predictor of depressive, anxiety, and PTSD
symptoms,
in addition to trauma exposure, education,
gender. This finding is aligned with previous research
indicating a protective effect of social support on mental
health symptoms among refugees (Alhasanat-Khalil
et al. 2018; Aroian et al. 2017; Kung et al. 2003;
Puyat 2013; Roh 2010; Sierau et al. 2019). This finding
is particularly meaningful in light of research suggesting
that refugees often report low help-seeking for emotion-
al support (Han and Oliffe 2015; Patel 2003), pointing
to the potential
impact of social support for different
needs (psychosocial needs and problems vs. mental
health services) and different sources of supports (e.g.,
family vs. professionals). Specifically, willingness to
share problems was a stronger predictor of depression
and PTSD symptoms than of anxiety symptoms among
Somali refugee youth. This implies that sharing itself
may not be helpful in relieving certain CMDs (i.e., anx-
iety) and other factors may affect the practice of shar-
ing, such as cultural customs, gender roles as well as
mental health stigma (De Antiss and Ziaian 2010;
Gopalkrishnan 2018; Kirmayer et al. 1995). This also
indicates support for including anxiety as a separate
measure of mental health rather than combining it with
influence
depression as psychosocial factors may not
depression and anxiety in the same way (Eckberg
et al. 2017; Ferreira-Valente et al. 2011; Ho et al.
2011; Sharapova and Goguikian Ratcliff 2018).

Trauma types also mattered in revealing the differen-
tial effects of traumatic events. When all four trauma
types were included in one model, only pre-migration/
migration trauma was a significant predictor of depres-
sion symptoms, and only pre-migration/migration trauma
and family trauma were significant predictors of PTSD
symptoms. This seemingly corroborates previous re-
search emphasizing the pivotal role of traumas from

war and forced migration in PTSD (de Jong et al. 2011;
Giacco et al. 2018) and depression (Ellis et al. 2010;
Lincoln et al. 2016). However, when we included vari-
ous trauma types entered in models one at a time, we
found that pre-migration/migration, post-migration, and
family trauma were all significant predictors of depres-
sion symptoms. In previous research with Somali refu-
gees in resettlement, traumatic events related to accul-
turation during adjustment to new societies have stood
out as a key predictor of mental health issues (e.g., Ellis
et al. 2008; Ellis et al. 2010; Lincoln et al. 2016). This
implies that Somali refugees are not a homogenous
group; rather,
their trauma experiences are varied and
complex, and therefore, different backgrounds and relat-
ed trauma types should be taken into account.

the education level

Education and gender also differentially predicted
mental health symptoms based on the type of trauma
exposure and the type of mental health symptoms in
question. Education is a known protective or resilient
factor that protects against mental health issues in some
refugee groups (e.g., Ayazi et al. 2014; Bond et al.
2007; Maguen et al. 2010). However, our results show
that those with higher education reported higher CMD
symptoms when having multiple trauma experiences. A
possible reason is that
in Somali
refugees might affect awareness of mental health symp-
toms and this reporting. In fact, education likely pro-
motes individual capacity and willingness to self-report
mental health problems (Poudel-Tandukar et al. 2019).
Future research could also explore whether refugee age
mitigates the relationships between trauma and psycho-
social factors and mental health. Additionally, while pre-
vious research has revealed gender differences in refu-
gee CMDs (e.g., Blight et al. 2006; Gerritsen et al.
2006; Guruge and Butt 2015), in the current study, gen-
der did not significantly predict depression or PTSD
symptoms in any trauma model. However, gender did
significantly predict anxiety symptoms in the post-
migration trauma, family trauma, and individual trauma
models. Although male participants experienced more
trauma than female participants in our sample,
trauma
exposure predicted greater mental health symptoms
among women than men. This justifies the importance
of gender in understanding trauma exposure and mental
health, even when gender is not a significant predictor
of specific mental health symptoms.

While the majority of our participants (59%) were
born in Somalia and then migrated to Kenya, 39% were
born in Kenya, making them second-generation Somali
refugees. These refugees share many of
the post-
migration trauma exposures that first-generation Somali
refugees have experienced, with protracted refugee situ-
ations causing second-generation refugees to remain
living in fear of persecution (Long
trapped in limbo,

2011; MOAS 2019) and experiencing decreased health
trauma
and wellness attributed to intergenerational
(Sangalang and Vang 2017). Due to these shared expe-
riences and taking into account guidance from our com-
munity partners, we included both first- and second-
is
generation Somali refugees in this study sample. It
possible, however, that trauma and psychosocial factors
impact first- and second-generation refugees differently,
indicating a need for future research exploring these
topics further.

This study showed both shared and discrete risk fac-
tors for CMDs. The pre-migration/migration, post-migra-
tion, and family trauma were all significant predictors of
anxiety symptoms. Three of the types of trauma events
(pre-migration/migration, post-migration, and family
trauma) were significant predictors of both anxiety
symptoms and depression symptoms, pointing to possi-
ble comorbidity of symptoms of depression and anxiety
(Bhui et al. 2003; Kroll et al. 2011). However, the other
predictors included in our regression models seem to
have a differential effect on depression and anxiety
symptoms, with gender significantly predicting anxiety
symptoms but not depressive symptoms.

Notably, individual trauma was not a significant pre-
dictor of mental health symptoms in any of our models.
This type of trauma, which represents experiences of
kidnapping, sexual abuse, and serious accident, was
the least common type of trauma exposure reported by
this Somali refugee sample. Therefore, while it is pos-
sible that these types of experiences are less likely than
other types of trauma to predict mental health symptoms
(Ford et al. 2008), it is also possible that these traumat-
ic events could predict mental health symptoms among
samples who have experienced more of this type of
trauma (Klæboe Greger et al. 2015).

This study has a few limitations to consider, which lead to
implications for future research. We used snowball sampling
because Somali refugees can be difficult to recruit. Although
this sampling method helps with recruitment of this highly mo-
bile population, it also reduces the generalizability of our find-
ings. A quantitative research design was necessary to investi-
gate the contributing factors for CMDs in this population.
However, Somali refugees are likely unfamiliar with survey
research (e.g., Bloch 1999; Bloch 2004; Bulmer 1998;
Moswete and Darley 2012), and thus, we made efforts to make
this data collection method more applicable by keeping the
survey as short as possible and only including the most neces-
sary items. Given the lack of culturally-validated psychosocial
measures in the research setting, it was sometimes difficult to
use entire existing measures to operationalize psychosocial fac-
tors. This presents a significant weakness of the current study,
indicating the need to interpret these findings tentatively and
provide future research to confirm these results.

In addition to willingness to share problems, some
other psychosocial factors could be included in future
research. In the current study, we originally included
other psychosocial factors in our regression models
(problem-solving and sense of community),
though
these variables were non-significant predictors of mental
health symptoms. There are several possible reasons for
this finding. First,
there were con-
founding variables that were not measured (e.g., pover-
ty) that could be causing the non-significant finding.
Second,
it could be our relatively small sample size
and therefore limited statistical power causing the non-
significant findings. Third, it is possible that a sampling
issue caused the non-significant finding, as we used a
non-probability sampling method, which reduces the
representativeness of our sample.

is possible that

it

Future research could prioritize creating short ver-
sions of these measures to help researchers better cap-
ture these variables even when short surveys must be
prioritized. In addition, future research could continue
examining relevant psychosocial factors with this popu-
lation in order to reveal a comprehensive set of predic-
tors of CMDs. Although our findings revealed that in-
dividual
trauma plays little role in predicting CMDs,
future research could continue to expand knowledge of
the differential impact of trauma exposure by investigat-
ing how individual traumatic events (e.g., sexual abuse,
kidnapping, serious accident) influence mental health
symptoms. Researchers could also work to establish val-
idated measures of different types of trauma exposure,
as relevant to refugees in particular.

The significance of willingness to share as a predictor of
decreased mental health symptoms is particularly relevant to
practice with refugees as it indicates a need for programs that
promote sharing problems with others. For example, refugee-
serving agencies could implement group therapy and support
groups in order to provide space for and encourage the sharing
of problems with others.

Conclusion

These findings highlight the role of trauma exposure and de-
mographic and psychosocial factors in predicting Somali ref-
ugee mental health symptoms. In order to address the mental
health needs of Somali refugees, refugee-serving agencies
could consider developing and implementing programs to en-
courage problem sharing. Additionally, continued research
exploring the differential impact of trauma exposure and var-
ious psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, coping, stigma)
on Somali refugee mental health could help us understand and
address the needs of this population.
