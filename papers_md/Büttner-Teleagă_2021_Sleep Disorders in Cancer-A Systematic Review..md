Abstract: Introduction: Sleep disorders, especially insomnia, are very common in different kinds
of cancers, but their prevalence and incidence are not well-known. Disturbed sleep in cancer is
caused by different reasons and usually appears as a comorbid disorder to different somatic and
psychiatric diagnoses, psychological disturbances and treatment methods. There can be many
different predictors for sleep disturbances in these vulnerable groups, such as pre-existing sleep
disorders, caused by the mental status in cancer or as side effect of the cancer treatment. Methods: A
systematic literature review of 8073 studies was conducted on the topic of sleep and sleep disorders
in cancer patients. The articles were identiﬁed though PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Knowledge,
and a total number of 89 publications were qualiﬁed for analysis. Results: The identiﬁed eighty-nine
studies were analyzed on the topic of sleep and sleep disorders in cancer, twenty-six studies on sleep
and fatigue in cancer and sixty-one studies on the topic of sleep disorders in cancer. The prevalence
of sleep disturbences and/or sleep disorders in cancer was up to 95%. Discussion: Sleep disturbances
and sleep disorders (such as insomnia, OSAS, narcolepsy and RLS; REM-SBD) in cancer patients
can be associated with different conditions. Side effects of cancer treatment and cancer-related
psychological dysfunctions can be instigated by sleep disturbances and sleep disorders in these
patients, especially insomnia and OSAS are common. An evidence-based treatment is necessary for
concomitant mental and/or physical states.

1. Introduction

Sleep disturbances and different sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia and sleep-related
breathing disorder (SRBD)/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)) are common and
considerable complaints of cancer patients. Narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and
REM-sleep behavior disorder (REM-SBD) are rarely found. Up to 95% of cancer patients
complain of sleep disturbances/disorders during diagnosis, treatment and after 10 years of
survivorship. Sleep disturbances/disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) have
been reported to inﬂuence fatigue [1–27] and its perceptions. Savard et al. studied cancer
survivors and showed that 52% of them reported sleeping difﬁculties, and 58% reported
that cancer either caused or aggravated their sleeping problems [28–88], especially [58].

Disturbed sleep appears before, while and after cancer diseases. The personalized
treatment of the most frequent sleep disorders, e.g., insomnia or sleep-related breathing
disorder, could improve both their mental and physical health, speciﬁcally for diseases such
as cancer. The analyses for this review were very challenging, speciﬁcally with regards to
systematizing the complex and nonhomogeneous literature about sleep, sleep disturbances
and different sleep disorders, their prevalence and the severity of sleep complaints in
cancer patients, especially because the cancer population is very heterogenous.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate critically the prevalence, severity

and efﬁcacy of treatments in cancer-related sleep disorders (CRSD).

2. State-of-the-Art
2.1. Sleep Disturbances in the Case of Cancer-Related Fatigue (CrF)

In spite of severe cancer-related fatigue (CrF) [1–27] and its perceptions [43,54,58,63,64,67]
in cancer patients, there is often also a high prevalence of sleep disturbances (30–50%) in
which the proportion of poor sleep or bad sleep quality is signiﬁcantly higher than in the
general population [6,21,23,58,64] (Table 2). Due to frequent “naps” during the day caused
by CrF, an additional increase in nocturnal problems can observed [1].

For the research of sleep and quality of sleep, the easy-to-use actigraphy is commonly
used [89,90]. Actigraphy data from various studies have shown that there is a strong
correlation between the changes in subjectively experienced CrF and sleep quality [2,10,16].
Therefore, CrF-induced sleep disorders can be used as a well-quantiﬁable CrF-induced
event to diagnose and control the course of CrF. Table 1 shows the four sleep-speciﬁc
phenotypes according to which patients with chronic fatigue syndrome can be classiﬁed by
means of the more elaborate, but more informative, polysomnography [11].

2.2. Insomnia in Cancer

longer Total Sleep Time (TST)

shortest Total Sleep Time (TST)

Insomnia is a very common and frequent comorbidity in cancer patients. The cancer-
related insomnia rate is nearly three times higher than that in the general population.
Different analyses have shown that 30–50% (up to 95%) of cancer patients have severe
sleep difﬁculties, such as insomnia symptoms or insomnia syndromes (Tables 3–5). Cancer-
related insomnia is characterized by a delayed sleep onset, sleep maintenance disorders,
reduced total sleep time and/or early-morning awakenings and is associated with excessive
daytime sleepiness, fatigue, impaired performance and daytime wellbeing. Furthermore,
we established a connection between insomnia and pain, depression, anxiety and/or a
reduced quality of life [27,43,53,54,58,63–65]. Various types of treatments for insomnia
include pharmacological therapies (e.g., hypnotica, sedativa, antidrepressiva, neuroleptics,
antihistamine, hormones (melatonin) and herbal extracts) [28,30,42,44,48,57] and nonphar-
macological therapies (like Psychoeducational intervention, Cognitive Behavior Therapy
(CBT), Professionally administered CBT (PCBT), Video-based CBT (VCBT), Behavioral
Therapy (BT), Individualized Sleep Promotion Plan (ISPP), Mindfulness-Based Stress Re-
duction (MBSR), Valencia model of Waking hypnosis, Internet intervention/Sleep Healthy
Using The internet (SHUTi), Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), Autogenic Training

(AT), (Electro)Acupuncture (EA), Tai Chi Chih (TCC), Cool Pad Pillow Topper (CPPT),
Combined multimodal-aerobic Treatment (CT), Multimodal Treatment (MT) and Aerobic
Treatment (AeT)) [29,31–41,44,46,47,49–52,55–57,59,61,62,66–71]. Most of the patients with
comorbid cancer-related insomnia (that means around 25–50%) are treated pharmacologi-
cally [31]. Especially, cancer patients have many side effects and sevaral physical problems
from this kind of treatment, so there are numerous limitations that emerge from these phar-
macological treatments. Such side effects generally include headaches, dizziness, fatigue,
excessive daytime sleepiness and residual daytime sedation and could be potentiated in
cancer patients [31]. There is a need and use of complementary and alternative medical
methods in cancer patients with cancer-related insomnia. Recent research has shown that
complementary and alternative treatments may provide a clinically relevant beneﬁt in
cancer-related insomnia [29,31–41,44,46,47,49–52,55–57,59,61,62,66–71].

2.3. Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder (SRBD)/Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS)
in Cancer

Sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), especially obstructive sleep apnea syn-
drome, (OSAS) are common disorders that are characterised by repetitive interruptions
of ventilation during sleep. They are caused by recurrent (upper) airway collapses and
follwed by sleep fragmentation, intermitted hypoxia and oxidative stress. Systemic and
vascular inﬂammations with endothelial dysfunctions cause diverse multiorgan chronic
morbidities and mortalities that affect the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and metabolic
systems in the progress to cancer. Sleep-related breathing disorders are an independent
risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and
cognitive decline and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [72–82].

Chronic and intermittent hypoxias seem to play a key role in the regulation of various
stages of tumor formation and their progressions. In recent years, some important studies
have shown that OSAS patients tend to have a higher prevalence and incidence of cancer
and even a higher prevalence of cancer-related mortality [72–82]. One article was able
to show that early CPAP treatment can reduce these prevalences: In vitro studies have
shown that, in OSAS, there are pro-oncogenic hypoxia properties that are mediate mainly
by enhanced posttranslational HIF effects. Intermittant hypoxia results in the increased
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and in tumor growth and metasta-
sis. An effective OSAS treatment coud prevent cancer, its growth and/or metastasis [74]
(Tables 3 and 6).

2.4. Narcolepsy in Cancer

The cancer risk as a comorbidity proﬁle of narcoleptic patients has been rarely ana-
lyzed [83–85] (Tables 3 and 7). There exist only two case studies, and one evaluated the
Taiwan nationwide database. Tseng et al. researched the risk of cancer (incidence) among
adult narcoleptics [85]. They found that adult narcoleptic patients have a higher risk for
developing cancer, but the study was not able to describe the underlying mechanisms for
this [83–85]. Further research is needed to understand the association between narcolepsy
and the development of cancer.

2.5. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in Cancer

Decreased sleep quality, sleep disturbences and/or sleep disruption are very common
in cancer patients, especially when they receive chemotherapy [1–26] (Tables 3 and 7). Until
now the processes and their pathophysiology have not been completely understood, but
most likely, they are multifactorial [86]. Additionally, disturbed sleep and sleep disorders
like insomnia and OSAS as disorders and/or diseases with pain, fatigue and mood dis-
turbances often occur in clusters. These clusters can negatively impact the quality of life
and the outcome of diseases [1–26]. Sleep disturbance, fatigue and mood disorders (like
depression and anxiety) can be based on distinct biologic processes. These processes could
be the trigger for inﬂammatory signaling as a contributing factor of restless legs syndrome
(RLS) [86].

The prevalence and/or incidence of restless legs syndrome in cancer is insufﬁciently
researched. A recent study of Saini et al. showed that RLS is frequent in patients with
cancer during chemotherapy. They demonstrated that the prevalence is approximately
double compared to the normal population (around 18%). In most cases, restless legs
syndrome was correlated with depression, anxiety and a decreased quality of life [86].

2.6. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in Cancer

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorders (REM-SBD) and cancer are very
seldom reported [83,87,88] (Tables 3 and 9). REM-SBD are forms of parasomnias. They are
characterised by severe dream-related behavior and increased abnormal electromyographic
activity during REM sleep. Sometimes, they are associated with nightmares and parvor
nocturnus [83,87,88]. The excessive electromyographic activity during REM sleep reﬂects
the dysfunction of the brainstem structures in REM-SBD patients [87]; acutely, they can be
caused by different medications, such as antidepressants or anticholinergic drugs [88].

3. Method
3.1. Data Sources

This review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and

Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting process where applicable [91].

A systematic literature search was carried out on January 2019 of the databases

PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Knowledge (Figure 1).

Types of Studies Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (qRCTs), prospective and retrospective studies, cross-sectional surveys, uncontrolled studies and controlled trials without randomization methods, a special article and case studies were included in this systematic review, because important literature was very rare and inconsistent. We only excluded any forms of qualitative studies. 3.3. Types of Participants Participants who were diagnosed with a sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD)/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and REM-sleep behavior disorder (REM-SBD)) due to cancer (re-gardless of gender and age) were included. 3.4. Types of Intervention The review included studies that evaluated different types of insomnia interventions: nonpharmacological interventions—Psychoeducational intervention, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Professionally administered CBT (PCBT), Video-based CBT (VCBT), Be-havioral Therapy (BT), Individualized Sleep Promotion Plan (ISPP)), Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Valencia model of Waking hypnosis, Internet intervention / Sleep Healthy Using The internet (SHUTi), Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), Auto-genic Training (AT), (Electro)Acupuncture (EA), Tai Chi Chih (TCC), Cool Pad Pillow Topper (CPPT), Combined multimodal-aerobic Treatment (CT), Multimodal Treatment PubMed 8073 Citations PsycInfo 340 Citations Web of Knowledge 1584 Citations Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria applied 9499 Articles excluded after Title/Abstract Screen  498 Articles retrieved Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria applied 409 Articles excluded after Full Text Screen  89 Articles included Identification Screening Eligibility Inclusion Int.

The search terms included the following keywords and keyword combinations (sleep
OR sleep quality OR sleep disorders OR insomnia OR sleep-related breathing disorder
OR obstructive sleep apnea syndrome OR narcolepsy OR restless legs syndrome) OR
REM sleep behavior disorder (REM-SBD) AND (cancer) (AND (fatigue)) in English. The
keywords were combined as pairs, e.g., sleep disorders AND cancer.

In addition, the reference lists of all of the obtained studies were evaluated. Hard

copies of all of the articles were obtained, and they were fully read.

For the analyses of sleep disorders in cancer, only studies from the period 1999/2000–
2018 were included in the review, with three exceptions: two studies about sleep and
cancer-related fatigue (CrF) in cancer from 1983 to 1993 and a study about OSAS and cancer
from 1988. For the analysis of sleep and fatigue in cancer, we even included some older ones.
The 8073 publications were found in the three databases—498 articles were read, and

a total number of 89 publications were included in the ﬁnal analysis.

3.2. Types of Studies

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (qRCTs),
prospective and retrospective studies, cross-sectional surveys, uncontrolled studies and
controlled trials without randomization methods, a special article and case studies were
included in this systematic review, because important literature was very rare and inconsis-
tent. We only excluded any forms of qualitative studies.

3.3. Types of Participants

Participants who were diagnosed with a sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep-related breath-
ing disorder (SRBD)/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), narcolepsy, restless legs
syndrome (RLS) and REM-sleep behavior disorder (REM-SBD)) due to cancer (regardless
of gender and age) were included.

3.4. Types of Intervention

The review included studies that evaluated different types of insomnia interventions:
nonpharmacological interventions—Psychoeducational intervention, Cognitive Behavior
Therapy (CBT), Professionally administered CBT (PCBT), Video-based CBT (VCBT), Be-
havioral Therapy (BT), Individualized Sleep Promotion Plan (ISPP)), Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR), Valencia model of Waking hypnosis, Internet intervention/Sleep
Healthy Using The internet (SHUTi), Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), Autogenic
Training (AT), (Electro)Acupuncture (EA), Tai Chi Chih (TCC), Cool Pad Pillow Topper
(CPPT), Combined multimodal-aerobic Treatment (CT), Multimodal Treatment (MT) and
Aerobic Treatment (AeT) and pharmacological interventions, for example, —melatonin
(hormone), mirtazapine (hypnoticum); herbal extracts—valerian.

3.5. Types of Outcomes
3.5.1. Primary Outcomes

1.

2.

The prevalence and/or the incidence of sleep disturbences and/or sleep disorders
in cancer were evaluated ﬁrstly by objective measurements—polysomnography
(PSG)/gold standard and polygraphy (PG) for OSAS or actigraphy. The important
sleep parameters included total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TIB), sleep efﬁciency
(SE), sleep quality (SQ), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset or total
waking time (WASO).
The prevalence and/or the incidence of sleep disturbences and/or sleep disorders
in cancer are measured secondly by subjective measurements—by scales or indices
for the sleep quality (e.g., the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) or special
sleep disorders: insomnia (e.g., Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Athens Insomnia Scale
(ASI)), OSAS (e.g., Berlin questionnaire), Narcolepsy (e.g., Narcolepsy Symptom
Questionnaire (NSQ)) or RLS (International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group
rating scale (IRLS)).

3.5.2. Secondary Outcomes

The effectiveness of insomnia treatments are measured with sleep diaries. Generally,
they include various subjective approaches or several items for reflecting the subjective
assessment of daily night’s sleep, including the total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TIB), sleep
efficiency (SE), sleep quality (SQ), satisfaction of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep
onset, total waking time (WASO), number of awakenings and morning woken-up time.

3.6. Selection of Studies and Data Extraction

The databases PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Knowledge were searched and poten-
tially studies screened: After the initial screening with checking the titles and abstracts,
all the full-text articles were read. The articles that were included in the review were
identiﬁed, and the data, according to predeﬁned criteria, were extracted. Information such
as samples (e.g., kind and number of participants), interventions (in the case of insomnia),
measuring instruments, measuring times, methods, outcomes and results were obtained
and documented from each study.

4. Results

Twenty-six studies for the topic of sleep and fatigue in cancer and sixty-one studies
for the topic of sleep disorders in cancer were analyzed, one for sleep disorders generally,
forty-four studies for the topic “Insomnia in Cancer” (eight for the “Prevalence of Insomnia
in Cancer” and thrirty-six for the “Treatment of Insomnia in Cancer”), twelve studies for
the topic “Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder (SRBD)/Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome
(OSAS) in Cancer”, three studies for the topic “Narcolepsy in Cancer”and one study for
the topic “Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in Cancer” (Tables 2–9).

5. Discussion

Sleep disturbances and sleep disorders in cancer patients are very common and have
different backgrounds compared with sleep difﬁculties in normal populations because of
the differences in the risk factors, vulnerability and cancer-speciﬁc life events.

A personalized treatment of sleep disorders in patients with cancer could improve

both their mental and physical health.

The goal of this review was to illuminate approaches that might inﬂuence sleep, sleep
quality and sleep disorders in cancer patients and treatment possibilities in cancer-related
insomnia. However, before treatment trials in different sleep disorders (insomnia, OSAS,
narcolepsy, RLS and REM-SBD) can be started, prospective and objective studies are needed
to unterstand the baseline levels of sleep, sleep difﬁculties and circadian rhythm in cancer.
Sleep disruption in cancer can be caused by many different reasons, such as stress, mental
disorders (like depression and anxiety), pain and treatment side effects.

Bad sleep quality, the degree of sleep disruption and sleep disorders have a very
important impact on cancer and can used as predictors. Sleep disruptions and disruptions
in the circadian rhythms affecting the sleep quality and the circadian rhythm themselves
can result in a variety of psychological and physiological mechanisms, which can foster
the developent and persistance of cancer-related fatigue. The role of naps in fatigued
cancer patients is unclear; it could be that naps are not helpful to decrease cancer-related
fatigue—they could have the opposite effect [17]. In noncancer patients, it is known that
daytime naps reduce the nightly sleep quality and total sleep time.

Although the relationship between fatigue, sleep and circadian rhythms in cancer is
known, there is a very small quantity of scientiﬁc reseach about this topic, and the quality
is mostly very poor. The existing literature and research is inhomogeneous, and there are
many methodological limitations: the types of studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials,
quasi-randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective studies, cross-sectional
surveys, uncontrolled studies and controlled trials without randomization methods, a
special article and case studies); participants (different kinds of cancer patients—e.g., with
or without treatment and with different entities); interventions (in the case of insomnia:
nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions); outcomes (objective and/or
subjective measurements) are not comparable and the sample sizes are mostly very small.
Davidson et al. found in a big sample size with nearly a thousand patients that the
total prevalence scores of RLS were present in nearly half of the researched cancer patients,
of overly sleepy and of insomnia in around one-third of the patients, of sleeping more
than usual and repetitive leg movements in almost one-ﬁfth of them and of breathing
interruptions in approximately ten percent [27].

The causes of decreased sleep quality; chronic sleep difﬁculties and the different
sleep disorders (insomnia, OSAS, narcolepsy, RLS and REM-SBD) are multifaceted, and in
recent studies, the attention that was paid this problem was too insufﬁcient. Until now, the
pathogenesis of cancer-related sleep disorders and the development such as the progression
of cancer based on sleep disorders has been unclear. More research about these topics is
needed to understand the nature, duration and severity of the different sleep disorders in
cancer or their relationship with it.

The prevention of sleep disorders generally and in cancer patients especially and an
early personalized treatment can contribute to reducing cancer-related fatigue and severe
mental disorders (like depression and anxiety) and can possibily prevent the development,
preservation and/or aggravation of cancer.

5.1. Expert Recommendations

Sleep disturbances; disruptions of the circadian rhythms and different sleep disorders
(e.g., insomnia and sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD)/obstructive sleep apnea syn-
drome (OSAS)) could be predictors of cancer development and treatment success (look
above). Due to that, cancer patients should be screened by sleep anamnesis and/or by
sleep diaries, including the structured exploration of predisposing and precipitating cancer

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11696

factors, and should be diagnosed—in the case of any kind of sleep-wake difﬁculties—by
polysomnography.

Screening should explore unrefreshing sleep: prolonged sleep latency, frequent awak-
ening and reduced sleep efﬁciency; daytime sleepiness and fatigue; loud snoring; inade-
quate nightly behavior and/or nightmares.

Both screening and/or the diagnosis of sleep disturbances; disruptions of the circadian
rhythm and/or sleep disorders, as well as adequate sleep health education (including sleep
hygiene, rules for good sleep quality and information about the consequences of unhealthy
and/or untreated sleep disorders for mental and physical health) should be implemented
to minimize the health risks caused by sleep disorders.

Tailored programs are needed and could be helpful to reduce cancer-related fatigue
and/or severe mental disorders (like depression and anxiety) to support the outcome of
the treatment of patients with cancer and comorbid sleep disorders.

Currently, sleep–wake solutions in cancer are mostly aimed only by responding to
emergency reasons and based on isolated and/or fragmented interventions, e.g., the
treatment of insomnia: cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, nightmares: rehearsal
therapy and SRBD: CPAP adherence.

Peronalized medical services for cancer patients should include integrated coaching
or the early treatment of the most common sleep disorders and web-based telehealth
programs [92] to reduce the preservation and/or aggravation of cancer an/or serious im-
plications, including increased cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and/or metabolic diseases;
excessive daytime sleepiness and/or cancer-related fatigue.

6. Conclusions

Cancer patients can suffer under different sleep disturbances and sleep disorders, and
these difﬁculties can be associated with different mental and/or physical problems. Side
effects of cancer treatment and cancer-related psychological dysfunctions can be triggered it.
Especially insomnia and OSAS are very common in cancer. Because of it, an evidence-based
and tailored treatment is necessary.
