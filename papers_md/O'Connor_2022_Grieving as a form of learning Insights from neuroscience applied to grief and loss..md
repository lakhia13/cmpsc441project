Abstract

Recent grief research suggests that the influential cognitive stress theory should be updated 
with evidence from cognitive neuroscience. Combining human and animal neuroscience with 
attachment theory, we propose that semantic knowledge of the everlasting nature of the 
attachment figure, and episodic, autobiographical memories of the death are in conflict, perhaps 
explaining the duration of grieving and generating predictions about complications in prolonged 
grief disorder (PGD). Our Gone-But-Also-Everlasting model emphasizes that grieving may be 
a form of learning, requiring time and experiential feedback. Difficulties pre-loss, such as 
spousal dependency or pre-existing hippocampal volume, can prolong learning and predict PGD. 
Complications such as avoidance, rumination, and stress-induced hippocampal atrophy may also 
develop post-loss, and create functional or structural mechanisms predicting PGD.

Since the 1980’s, dominant approaches to bereavement research have derived from 
cognitive stress theory [1,2] and attachment theory [3]. Cognitive stress theory suggests 
that bereavement is a stressful life event because the loss is appraised as exceeding one’s 
resources to cope with major readjustments [1]. This view of bereavement focuses on the 
addition of a stressful event to ongoing life goals and behaviors, rather than the subtraction 
of a functioning element of the self (the loved one, or the overlapping other) that has enabled 
successful goals and behaviors. However, evidence from both human and animal models 
of grief and loss suggests that cognitive stress theory may be an incomplete understanding 
of the basic neurobiology of the stress response during separation_[4,5]. Specifically, the 
encoding of attachment during bonding creates a stress response during separation that is 
more unconscious and automatic than suggested by cognitive stress theory.

In daily life, our need for attachment figures poses a problem, since social mammals are 
mobile, and we must find our loved ones again to fulfill this need. Attachment relies on the 
prediction of the persistence of the other, given that attachment is the tether enabling social 
mammals to leave and return to their mates and offspring multiple times a day. Locating 
those we are bonded to is therefore a critical function of the brain, as evidenced by a devoted 
category of partner-approach neurons, for example [6]. In prairie voles, the partner-approach 
neuronal ensemble in the nucleus accumbens increases in size following bond formation, 
and differences in the size of approach ensembles between partner and novel voles predict 
attachment bond strength.

Bonding is like a gun being cocked, and separation pulls the trigger. At the time of 
bond formation, neural encoding is created to trigger a physiological stress response upon 
separation. Epigenetic changes in the nucleus accumbens during mating in the prairie vole 
lead to increased oxytocin receptors, and this epigenetic change ensures the monogamous 
bond [7]. Once the voles are pair-bonded, they are primed to make the precursor of animal 
cortisol if their mate goes missing, so it can quickly be released when they lose track 
of each other, motivating the vole to seek out its partner to reduce the resulting stress 
[8,9]. Although the separation stress response fulfills an adaptive function when reunion 
is possible, in bereavement, the physiological stress continues without the input of the 
pair-bonded mate. This evidence is congruent with overlapping self-other representation 
in human neuroimaging [10] and the increased cortisol we see in acute grief [11]. We 
hypothesize that the encoding that occurs during bonding includes the prediction that this 
particular other will always be one’s partner, with the emphasis on “always”. Built into 
the encoded characteristics constitutive of the mate is their everlasting nature, and absence 
is just a temporary state, requiring proximity seeking. Rather than the cognitive stress 
appraisal, we interpret this evidence to suggest the automaticity may mean the stress of 
bereavement is primary and outside of awareness. Thus, rather than the appraisal, “I realize 
the other part of me is missing, and so I feel terrible”, more likely the order is “I feel 
terrible—oh, that must mean that the other part of me is missing”.

We hypothesize that the neural architecture of the bond supports the belief (or semantic 
knowledge) that the other persists, despite any sensory evidence to the contrary. This belief 
serves a great evolutionary need—those who persisted in their belief that the other existed 
remained in place to have a caregiver return with food, for example, or sought out their 
partner to maintain their sexual or co-parenting relationship and pass on their genes. The 
typical rewarding experience of daily reunion with a loved one after separation (liking) 
confirms the prediction made during their absence (wanting, yearning). Neurohormones 
instantiate the reaction to reunion, which elicits a reduction in cortisol, and release of 
oxytocin and dopamine. The reason that the emphasis on this semantic knowledge is 
important and novel, is because it determines how the brain makes predictions about where 
the attachment figure is, and when a reunion will happen. These predictions determine how 
the bereaved will function and behave in the world after the rare but permanent separation of 
death.

The human mind functions as a predicting, generative agent, which maintains relatively 
stable “models” or representations of both external and internal environments, constantly

making predictions about the environment, and updating these models with new stimuli and 
life events via a learning mechanism [12]. At a neurobiological level, once a pair bond 
or caregiving bond has been formed, the neural circuitry is reset (e.g., through epigenetic 
changes) to include both members of the dyad as the functioning unit. Viewing separation 
and loss as the subtraction (and then absence) of a functioning aspect of the individual’s 
“self” is illuminated when considering subsequent prediction. How does awareness of loss 
change the expectations of where the missing other is, and whether future predictions should 
be changed based on the absence? When there can be no reward of reunion given the loved 
one’s death, prediction error is experienced until the updated semantic knowledge can be 
learned.

The Gone-But-Also-Everlasting theory of grieving

The brain’s model of the world must change in order for the person to fulfill their goals 
and achieve a state of safety and comfort [4,13]. Death of a loved one poses a unique 
and rare challenge, since the stream of information from semantic knowledge (persistence 
of the attachment figure’s existence) now conflicts with episodic knowledge of the death 
of the person (e.g., memory of the death event or funeral). We propose the Gone-But-Also-
Everlasting theory to emphasize the dissonance between those two sources of information. 
This new theory emphasizes that grieving can be considered a form of learning, requiring 
time and feedback in the form of real-world experience. The first morning that a widowed 
husband wakes up alone after thousands of mornings of waking up next to his wife, the best 
prediction is not to assume that she has died. In fact, many experiences will be required to 
convince him that he will never again wake up next to her again, and enable him to predict 
that her absence means he must change his way of understanding himself, the world, and the 
future [14,15].

The importance of the conflict between these dual streams of information is that the conflict 
will interfere with learning (or updating the model of the attachment figure), and with 
making new predictions that reflect the reality of the permanent absence of the attachment 
figure (applying the model). Acutely, difficulty with learning the new reality will lead 
to a) emotional intensity and lability, when the reality is confronted over and over, and 
b) confusion, disbelief, magical thinking, and counterfactuals (if only, what if), as the 
brain attempts to accommodate the two sources of information. Further, the experience of 
bereavement involves multiple mechanisms that drive intrusive thoughts in grief: emotional 
salience, inability to complete the seeking-reunion process, environments that stimulate 
cue-elicited retrieval, and dissonance between the predicted/desired and actual experience 
[16].

Evidence for the new theory in neuroscience of grief

At different levels of complexity, learning to make new predictions means 1) new automatic 
habits must be learned [17], 2) the self must be updated to include the absence of the person, 
or a revision in predicting their presence/availability, and 3) other bonds must be developed/
strengthened to meet ongoing attachment needs (revising the attachment hierarchy [4]). Note

that each of these require new neural connections in the brain, a biomechanical process 
requiring time, feedback through experience, and a brain with structural integrity.

Incorporating new knowledge into predictions goes beyond habit. At one level, it is a long 
time before a daughter stops picking up the phone to relay a funny incident to her deceased 
mother. This behavior suggests an automaticity that must be relearned. In addition, however, 
changes in nucleus accumbens seen in animal and human fMRI research suggest that 
regions of the reward network (including caudate, orbitofrontal cortex, etc.) are important 
for predicting their presence and motivating us to seek/yearn for them [18–22].

Evidence for the new theory in neuroscience of prolonged grief disorder

By focusing on grieving as a form of learning, we can see how complications in adaptation 
may occur. Lab-based behavioral tasks can show us where functional problems in learning 
(e.g., using reward feedback, avoiding experience) may lead to prolonged grief disorder 
(PGD; [23]) and structural neuroimaging can help us see where problems in structural 
integrity of the brain can lead to PGD (Figure 1).

An excellent systematic review of the neurobiology of disordered grief has conceptualized 
PGD as a disorder of reward [24]. Reward is inherently a process by which learning 
develops, as one’s predictions about the world are either rewarded or not, leading to 
accommodation and consolidation of information and future predictions. Those who 
develop PGD may have 1) a pre-existing reward system that strongly supports the anxiety 
and attention to the “everlasting” aspect of attachment as a diathesis (dependency [25], 
attachment style [26], and separation anxiety as predictors [27]). Attachment style may also 
be a diathesis for brain function [28], and may predict complications when layered with 
bereavement. Another possibility is that 2) complications arise after the death, due to the 
emotional pain of grief [25,29], and complications develop in how the death information 
is brought to awareness [30]). These complications, including avoidance and grief-related 
rumination, may lead to prolonged grieving, or lack of learning over time [31].

Spousal dependence predicts feelings that life is empty or meaningless, a sense of 
diminished identity, and difficulty imagining the future [32]. Dependence prior to the loss 
may be a risk factor for PGD because of the increased risk for preoccupying thoughts 
related to the deceased and a sense that one’s identity, meaning in life, and plans for the 
future are lost without the deceased [33]. These findings are in keeping with Maccallum and 
Bryant’s [34] cognitive attachment model in which they posit that a merged identity with the 
deceased will enhance the accessibility of deceased-related memories and reduce the ability 
to imagine the future. Additionally, a robust predictor of PGD severity is the extent to which 
the self-concept of the bereaved is dominated by the deceased [35].

Learning requires experience, and avoidance of things that remind the bereaved of the 
loved one’s death or absence will prevent accommodation of the information. Only through 
learning does the integration of the loss experience enable the restoration of a meaningful 
life. Ironically, grief-related rumination may actually serve the same function as avoidance. 
Grief-related rumination focuses on the counterfactuals (what ifs and would’ve/could’ve/

should’ve); all of which are virtual reality scenarios that end in the loved one not dying 
[36]. Grief-related rumination may maintain the “everlasting” aspect of the attachment 
relationship, enabling the bereaved to avoid the painful evidence of “gone” [37,38]. Of 
course, these counterfactual outcomes only create grief anew each time that the reality of the 
loss resurfaces.

Structural neuroimaging shows us another reason why learning may be disrupted in PGD. 
As with functional predictors of PGD, differences in brain structure could 1) precede 
the death as a diathesis, or 2) follow from the stress of the bereavement experience. A 
prospective study showed that a smaller hippocampus prior to the death predicted disordered 
grieving [39]. Most studies are more equivocal as to whether structural differences precede 
or follow the loss. Importantly, all of this learning/grieving must be done while there is 
concurrent excessive cortisol, blood pressure, and inflammation as a physiological stress 
response to the death event [40]. Cortisol impacts brain structures such as hippocampus, 
regions needed for learning and memory. Decreased hippocampal volume has been shown 
in those who have lost a child, with and without post-traumatic stress disorder [41]. 
On the other hand, recent work has shown increased bilateral amygdala volumes, and 
in subsamples, larger nucleus accumbens and caudate volumes after bereavement or 
relationship break-up across the lifetime [42].

Education is a predictor of poor bereavement outcomes, including higher levels of PGD, 
and might reflect long-standing learning difficulties [43,44], although there may be many 
reasons why education is predictive. Behavioral studies also suggest that Stroop learning 
is affected in PGD [21], a neuropsychological test of managing conflicting inputs. Another 
possible view is that the death of a loved one is a notable inflection point in an ongoing 
trajectory of cognitive decline in older adults, possibly hastening the trajectory, but not 
causal per se [45].

Almost all functional and structural neuroimaging studies are about grief rather than 
grieving—they sample a single time point, and learning/grieving is inherently a trajectory 
of change over time. Thus, we don’t have functional neuroimaging evidence for many pre-
existing diatheses. Worst of all, not distinguishing acute and/or typical grief and prolonged 
grief within the sample muddies the waters further.

Most of the observations in this article are simply updated, empirical examples of 
existing attachment theory [46] and cognitive psychology research, but the Gone-But-
Also-Everlasting theory incorporates new evidence from cognitive neuroscience and the 
neuroscience of relationships and grief and loss. This emphasis on grief or PGD as the 
consequence of updating the neural encoding of an attachment bond, and the required brain 
structure and function for that learning, enables novel predictions that can be tested to 
further advance our understanding of grief and loss.

Prolonged grief often involves hypervigilance and avoidance of grief-related cues. In this 
study, bereaved adults with an avoidant grieving style reported more intrusive thoughts of 
the loss during a sustained attention task -- despite fMRI activation indicating attempts to 
monitor internally-focused thought for reminders of the deceased via interactions between a 
fronto-temporoparietal network (linked to deceased-related attention) and an orbitofrontal-basal 
ganglia network (linked to mental representation of the deceased).

(2020) 397–407. 10.1037/abn0000520. [PubMed: 32250140] The feeling that part of one’s self 
died along with the deceased can be especially acute in people with disordered grief. The 
authors identified that complicated grief was associated with disrupted self-concept fluency (or 
accessibility) and more impoverished description. They suggest that identity disruption in grief 
may be most impairing when the death is perceived to eliminate entire domain(s) of a person’s 
self-concept.

Highlights

•

Neural encoding of attachment during bonding sets the stage for separation 
distress.

Predicting that the attachment figure exists, even when temporarily absent, is 
adaptive.

Grief requires updating predictions of the loved one’s presence given their 
permanent absence.

Failure to reconcile conflicting streams of information may prolong grief.

Grief can be considered a form of learning.
