Abstract: Since the start of this millennium the diaspora of families with children has continued
unabated. UNICEF estimates that nearly 31 million children have been forcibly displaced from their
homes by the end of 2017. This includes 13 million child refugees, an estimated 17 million children
internally displaced within their own countries and over 900 thousand children seeking asylum in a
diﬀerent country. Even more staggering is the 75 percent increase in the number of child refugees
between 2010 and 2015. This Special Issue, Children on the Move: The Health of Refugee, Immigrant
and Displaced Children, examines in detail the health and well-being of our most vulnerable children
today. It follows the arc of migration from home country, through transit and ﬁnally the challenges
experienced in a child’s new country. The papers explore a variety of acute and chronic health
conditions as well as the mental health of these children and youth. The articles examine the trauma
experienced in their home country, the ﬂeeing of war, violence and/or poverty, the travails during
their journey, the stress throughout their stay in detention centers and refugee camps, and ﬁnally the
transition to a new home country.

Since the start of this millennium the diaspora of families with children has continued unabated.
The general population’s attention was drawn to the issue following the 2015 drowning of Alan Kurdi,
the three-year-old Kurdish refugee from Syria. The photograph of the toddler lying face down on
the shore made the journey palpable to millions worldwide. More recently, the image of children
separated from their parents and held in detention centers on the southern border of the United States
reawakened our collective awareness of the ongoing tragedy experienced by the global diaspora of
families and their children.

UNICEF estimates that nearly 31 million children have been forcibly displaced from their homes
by the end of 2017. This includes 13 million child refugees, an estimated 17 million children internally
displaced within their own countries and over 900 thousand children seeking asylum in a diﬀerent
country [1]. Even more staggering is the 75 percent increase in the number of child refugees between
2010 and 2015 [2]. They are ﬂeeing armed conﬂict, poverty, oppression and natural disasters, seeking
to ﬁnd a safe and welcoming new home.

This Special Issue, Children on the Move: The Health of Refugee, Immigrant and Displaced Children,
examines in detail the health and well-being of our most vulnerable children today. It follows the arc of
migration from home country, through transit and ﬁnally the challenges experienced in a child’s new
country. The articles examine the trauma experienced in their home country, the ﬂeeing of war, violence
and/or poverty, the travails during their journey, the stress throughout their stay in detention centers
and refugee camps, and ﬁnally their transition to a new home country. It contains contributions from
an international community of professionals working on behalf of all refugee, immigrant and displaced

children. The papers explore a variety of acute and chronic health conditions as well as the mental
health of these children and youth with an emphasis on trauma informed care. The contributions are
grounded in the principles, standards and norms of child rights as articulated by the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child (CRC). All the articles provide new insights and strategies on how best to
ground our clinical work as well as advocating for programmatic and policy change through a child
rights based framework.

The Special Issue begins with an editorial by Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba, Allison Bovell-Ammon
and Diana Becker Cutts that eloquently speaks to the “invisible walls” that are created through global
policies within and across nations that ﬁrst fail to address the antecedents of poverty, violence and
climate change, and then isolationist and xenophobic polices that limit migration across borders. This
is best exempliﬁed by the present policy of the United States regarding its southern border and the
especially harmful eﬀect it is having on children and their families.

Nina Frield and Oliver Muensterer provide a glimpse into the hospitalization of refugee children
admitted to hospitals in Germany. When families migrate from transitional refugee camps to hopefully
their ﬁnal destination, the morbidity and health burden frequently migrates with them. Their study
is a retrospective review over a 10-year span. They found that hospitalized refugee children were
signiﬁcantly more likely to experience anemia, colonized with Methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, minor
trauma, and esophageal foreign bodies as compared to non-refugee children. The results speak to the
need to remain vigilant in the screening and assessment of refugee children once they have reached
their destination.

Allison Bovell-Ammon, Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba, Sharon Coleman and colleagues provide an
important paper from the Children’s Healthwatch collaborative that highlights a worrying trend of
increased food insecurity rates and decreased participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP) amongst children born in the United States to immigrant families. This investigation
of economic and nutritional hardship complements the other articles in the Special Issue and completes
the arc regarding the family diaspora over the last decade. Speciﬁcally, the ongoing stress that
accompanies the migration of families from their country of origin to the assimilation to a new home.
The ﬁndings have major policy implication for the United States’ policies toward immigration and
identiﬁes that restrictive policies do have human consequences for children and youth.

Asterios Kampouras, Georgios Tzikos, Eustathios Partsanakis and colleagues examine the
prevalence of disease and its resultant morbidity in the refugee camps on mainland Greece. A full
45% percent of those seen in the primary care oﬃce were infants, children and adolescents. The
paper explores the magnitude of acute and chronic infectious diseases as well as non-communicable
conditions including those associated with trauma and/or stress. The evolution in the approach to
sheltering from a short-term way station into a long term encampment occurring during the winter
months is poignant. It speaks to the adversity faced by these families as well as the need for policies by
countries who are receiving migrating families with children.

The article by Andie Buccitelli and Myriam Denov explores the barriers experienced by young
refugees ﬂeeing war and conﬂict who are seeking asylum in Quebec, Canada. They face a myriad of
care systems that are insensitive to their needs, values and beliefs. Trauma is a consistent and pervasive
experience that spans from their home country, dangerous travels and resettlement at their destination.
The paper examines a number of alternative approaches that were generated from the youths’ insights.
These approaches validate their own identity and lived experiences so as to facilitate adjustment to
their new home now as well as their lives for the foreseeable future.

Eileen Crespo highlights in her review the importance of oral health for newly arrived children
in the United States. For these new arrivals, oral health is often a signiﬁcant issue, with the severity
of dental disease varying by the country of origin as well as cultural beliefs that can hinder access
to care. It concludes with a call to health care providers to recognize oral health problems, make
appropriate referrals and communicate eﬀectively with families on the need for both preventive oral
health and care.

Kathleen Miller, Calla Brown, Maura Schramko and Maria Svetaz provide a review of
trauma-informed care approaches designed to address the toxic stress and trauma experience by
refugee youth. It outlines 10 clinical pearls that provides guidance to providers who are caring for
this vulnerable group of children and youth. These included utilizing a strength-based approach to
care, creating an immigrant-friendly environment that promotes trusting relations, and utilizing a
two-generational approach to care and advocacy both within the clinic and community.

Logan DeBord, Kali Hopkins and Padma Swamy provide a unique insight from the trainee
perspective on providing care for children on the move. They provide two case studies that highlight
the need for quality interpreters/translators when working with refugee and immigrant families.
They also provide recommendations on the need for medical education changes designed to address
this issue.

Ranit Mishori provides an introduction to the topic of age assessment of minors crossing
international borders and the diﬃculty of establishing the correct assessment of the age of immigrant
and refugee children. This introduction provides a summary of the best practices presently available in
estimating a child’s chronological age. It discusses how medical knowledge can be misused during this
sentinel event and concludes with a series of recommendations on adopting best policies, procedures
and practices in the initial assessment and evaluation.

Ziba Vighri, Zoë Tessier and Christian Whalen, in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), examine in depth the rights to provide for and
protect children who have been displaced from their homes due to violence and war. The manuscript
outlines the ramiﬁcations on children’s health and development. It provides an in-depth analysis of
the mandated provisions of the CRC dedicated to protecting displaced and asylum-seeking children.
Melissa Diamond and Charles Oberg provide a brief report on the trauma experience of Syrian
refugee families and their children presently living in Turkey. It explores gender related trauma such as
sexual violence, domestic violence and cultural constructions of masculinity, as well as the impact on
the educational experience of Syrian children. The paper concludes with a call for increased integration
of parent trauma support in educational intervention trainings and the creation of safe spaces where
mothers and fathers can discuss their own trauma and in hope of enhancing educational program
eﬃcacy for their children.

Avinash Shetty provides a comprehensive review of infectious diseases experienced by refugee
children. The review focuses on the notable infectious diseases of active tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis
B and C and malaria as well as other parasitic infections. It also highlights vaccine preventable
diseases. It provides a summary of health assessment guidelines for newly arriving immigrant and
refugee children.

The Special Issue concludes with an opinion piece by the Special Issue Guest Editor, Charles
Oberg on the Budapest Declaration, summarizing this landmark document on the rights of immigrant
and refugee children [3]. It also discusses how as child health providers we must alter our approaches
to a holistic plan based on a child rights based approach (CRBA) that melds the intersection between
health care, health systems, policies and programs [4]. It demands we advocate for a new approach in
the 21st century to global migration and the health and well-being of children and youth who are on
the move.
