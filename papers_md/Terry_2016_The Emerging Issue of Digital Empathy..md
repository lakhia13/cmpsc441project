Empathy can have strong positive effects on patient outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, and reduce
malpractice litigation. With modern advances in technology, however, the appropriate expression of
empathy in today’s age is being threatened, largely as a result of psychological processes that form
online disinhibition. The digitization of health care and the corresponding decrease in the expression of
empathy may be cause for concern. Because empathy is strongly correlated to positive health outcomes
and is an important part of health professions in general, the construct of digital empathy should be
considered for integration into health professions curricula.

INTRODUCTION

The importance of empathy in patient care and in
the patient-provider relationship is well documented
in the medical literature. As Neuwirth stated, empathy
increases both patient satisfaction and compliance and
enhances a practitioner’s ability to treat patients.1 In ad-
dition, empathy has strong positive effects on patients’
health outcomes2 and reduces the risk of malpractice
litigation.3,4

As with many other aspects of contemporary culture,
rapid adoption of social and mobile technologies has al-
tered society’s communication patterns5 and disrupted
the expression of empathy, speciﬁcally in digital conver-
sations. Mobile and social media use has transformed
when and how individuals interact with others. The ability
to instantly share thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with
the rest of society via digital channels can occur in mere
seconds, often without the empathetic social ﬁlter that
accompanies traditional communications. Moreover, dig-
ital communications are devoid of many of the emotional
signals and cues experienced in face-to-face settings,
often leading to more impersonal interactions.6 These
changes in modern technology present challenges to the
evolving socio-communicative aspects of health care and
require an understanding of the emerging construct of
“digital empathy.” We offer a deﬁnition of digital empa-
thy as the “traditional empathic characteristics such
as concern and caring for others expressed through
computer-mediated communications.”

DIGITIZATION OF HEALTH CARE

The importance of the digital empathy construct has
developed over time as societal communication trends
and technology use have intersected with the provision
of health care services. According to a national survey of
health care and information technology professionals
conducted by Intel Corporation, health care delivery in
the United States will undergo dramatic changes in the
near future with the increase in utilization of technology
and telemedicine.7 Eighty-nine percent of health care
executives and IT professionals interviewed via phone
expected telemedicine to transform the US health care
system in the next decade. Two of every three respondents
to the survey stated they used telemedicine services and,
of those who did not use telemedicine services at that
time, half said they planned to implement the technology
within the year.7

While telemedicine and other Medicine 2.08 ser-
vices are becoming more popular, research indicates that
expression of empathy is reduced in these digital set-
tings. In a crossover study at Gunma University Hospital
in Japan,
telemedicine consultations via video chat
between doctors and patients in two separate rooms
communicating through cameras mounted on computer
monitors and face-to-face consultations were assessed
and compared. Affective behavior patterns, speciﬁcally
empathy utterances, were less evident in telemedicine
consultations.9 Although only one study, this signiﬁcant
ﬁnding suggests a small measure of validity to the anec-
dotal evidence that expression of empathy is lacking in
technology-based settings and warrants an examination
and discussion of the issues in a public forum, particu-
larly a conversation about how to appropriately address
these concerns.

ONLINE DISINHIBITION EFFECT

Which personal thoughts and attitudes are commu-
nicated to others and the manner in which they are
expressed may be different in digital vs traditional face-
to-face settings. Some individuals may exhibit unusual
acts of compassion in online settings, while others may
devolve into sarcasm, harsh language, uncouth criticisms,
and even cyber bullying.10-12 It is not uncommon to read
vitriol-ﬁlled remarks on social media applications or in
the comments section of online news sites. Disrespect and
thus a lack of empathetic concern for others is all too
evident in contemporary online discussions.13 In many
instances, those unsavory comments are unprovoked and
unwarranted.

While there may be other influences, the online
disinhibition effect14 describes several subtle, but pow-
erful underlying factors that contribute to the nature of
communication via digital devices. These factors may
help explain the sometimes toxic and aggressive nature
of online communications.15 First, the anonymity asso-
ciated with computer-mediated communication may
permit people to possess an alternate online identity
and essentially hide behind a nonidentifying pseudo-
nym or username. This form of dissociative anonymity
allows people to separate from in-person identity and
moral agency, thereby freeing them to express hostility
and criticism without any effect to the psyche. Simi-
larly, online users may dissociate those at the other
end of the communication by subconsciously viewing
them merely as avatars or usernames instead of actual
persons.

Second, as online communication can be asynchro-
nous, individuals do not have to manage immediate
reactions to online conversations and can remove
themselves from the repercussions of online discussions,
even avoiding ownership for hostile and intimidating
comments. Third, even in a completely nonanonymous
environment (ie, computerized medical record, e-mail
correspondence, blogs), the nature of online communi-
cations is such that individuals are physically invisible to
others, permitting them to disregard any type of eye
contact or physical reaction of the other person(s). A
significant portion of traditional face-to-face communi-
cations tends to be nonverbal (eg, body language, tone of
voice), and without these cues, online conversations lack
an essential element of understanding.16

Overt negativity toward others manifested in online
communications should not be attributed merely to char-
acter flaws. The online disinhibition effect applies to all
individuals regardless of ethical and moral character.
Even those of high moral judgment and character can
subconsciously devolve into a more pernicious state when

2

they psychologically disconnect their words from their
actual being. In essence, the subconscious psychological
factors associated with the online disinhibition effect
negatively impact the likelihood that empathy will be
expressed in digital environments. In fact, a contributor
to declining empathy is the “rising prominence of per-
sonal technology and media use in everyday life.”17 Thus,
interpersonal dynamics are altered by the use of technol-
ogy as a communication tool.17 As the provision of health
care services becomes more entwined with a technologi-
cal world, we must elevate the construct of digital empa-
thy into the collective consciousness of both educators
and trainees in the medical community and seek to pre-
pare future health care providers to exhibit empathy in
digital venues.

TEACHING DIGITAL EMPATHY

Similar to e-professionalism and electronic health
records, the concept of digital empathy is another aspect
of a technologically evolving environment that should
be addressed within health professions curricula. Be-
cause of the growth of computer-mediated communica-
tion, the need to make future health care providers aware
of digital empathy and teach them how to recognize and
avoid harmful online communications is unlikely to re-
cede. From an educational standpoint, one needs to look
first at empathy training in general to determine how
health professions education might approach issues per-
taining to digital empathy. Unfortunately, research by
Ahrweiler et al indicated that medical education in gen-
eral does not promote the development of empathy.18
Unlike other skills and knowledge-based content, teach-
ing skills from the affective domain is not straightfor-
ward and may require creative and focused educational
methods.

Although the construct of empathy is multidimen-
sional in nature and difficult to measure, there are effec-
tive strategies for teaching empathy that focus specifically
on communication skills training,19 a concept that aligns
with other digital communication training. Communica-
tion skills training in the form of traditional lectures and
small group workshops increases empathy scores for stu-
dents in all phases of training.19 If sharpening students’
communication skills leads to an increase in tradi-
tional empathy, it may also be an excellent way to ad-
dress digital empathy.

Self-reflection and reflective writing are also useful
methods for addressing empathy in medical education
curricula19 and in developing empathy.18 In their system-
atic literature review, Chen and Forbes noted that signif-
icant change in student empathy occurred in 100% of
the studies in which reﬂective writing activities were

American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2016; 80 (4) Article 58.

incorporated.20 The authors suggested the process of re-
ﬂective writing should be considered in any curricula, as
this approach was successful at developing empathy.18
Self-reﬂection activities have been successfully intro-
duced into curricula through a variety of formats, includ-
ing group peer discussions21 and mindfulness training.22
Because the underlying principles of traditional and
digital empathy constructs are the same, both communi-
cations training and self-reflection activities could theo-
retically prompt learners to question and examine their
interactions in the online world. This self-examination
process may potentially develop heightened online
awareness and promote increased digital empathy. A tar-
geted awareness that digital communication is powerful
and can often have unintended effects on others is an
important element of developing digital empathy. Raising
awareness of the importance of digital empathy is the first
step in appropriately educating trainees and adequately
preparing them for the future of health care in an ever-
changing technological world.

Raising awareness alone may not address all issues,
however. Several questions still remain, such as whether
empathy training specifically addresses the subcon-
scious effects of online disinhibition. These subcon-
scious effects are instrumental and potentially the
primary reasons why a general lack of digital empathy
is exhibited throughout society as a whole. It is unknown
whether traditional empathy training merely applied to
digital communications is sufficient. Another question is
whether an awareness or understanding of one’s online
disinhibition is enough to prevent it from occurring or if
other psychological interventions are necessary. More-
over, should empathy education incorporate instruction
to address the process of online disinhibition? Research
is needed to answer these questions. As educators, we
should be designing and testing educational models that
will increase digital empathy skills of the next genera-
tion of health care providers.

CONCLUSION

Empathy at its core will never change; however, the
means by which empathy is expressed is naturally evolv-
ing as the world and its forms of communications become
increasingly digital. As we continue to adopt techno-
logical tools to improve patient communications and
outcomes, recognizing and addressing barriers to the
expression of digital empathy is important. If trends in
technology advancements continue as expected, digital
empathy will become an even more critical issue. Efforts
to address the emerging issue of digital empathy and its
expression should begin now, as relationships remain es-
sential to delivering optimal patient care.23
