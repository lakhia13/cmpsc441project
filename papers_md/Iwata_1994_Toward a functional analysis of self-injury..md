This study describes the use of an operant methodology to assess functional relationships between
self-injury and specific environmental events. The self-injurious behaviors of nine developmentally
disabled subjects were observed during periods of brief, repeated exposure to a series of analogue
conditions. Each condition differed along one or more of the following dimensions: (1) play materials
(present vs absent), (2) experimenter demands (high vs low), and (3) social attention (absent vs
noncontingent vs contingent). Results showed a great deal of both between and within-subject
variability. However, in six of the nine subjects, higher levels ofself-injury were consistently associated
with a specific stimulus condition, suggesting that within-subject variability was a function of
distinct features of the social and/or physical environment. These data are discussed in light of
previously suggested hypotheses for the motivation of self-injury, with particular emphasis on their
implications for the selection of suitable treatments.

The description, incidence and damaging effects
of self-injury, as well as numerous attempts to con-
trol it, have been repeatedly documented in the
literature. Self-injury is a bizarre and often chronic
form of aberrant behavior, the etiology of which is
at best poorly understood. It poses serious risks to
those who engage in the behavior, and it represents
a formidable challenge to those who are responsible
for treating it.

Most of the research on self-injury over the past
15 years has focused on discovering means for its
effective elimination. The greatest success has been
found using methods based on operant condition-

ing principles (Bachman, 1972; Baumeister &
Rollings, 1976; Frankel & Simmons, 1976; John-
son & Baumeister, 1978; Romanczyk & Goren,
1975; Schroeder, Schroeder, Rojahn, & Mulick,
1981; Smolev, 1971). However, some mixed find-
ings have been noted with almost all of the be-
havioral interventions. For example, although a
number of studies have shown that the reinforce-
ment of incompatible or other behavior (DRI/
DRO) reduced self-injury (Allen & Harris, 1966;
Frankel, Moss, Schofield, & Simmons, 1976; Lo-
vaas, Freitag, Gold, & Kassorla, 1965; Tarpley &
Schroeder, 1979), others have reported poor results
with DRO/DRI (Corte, Wolf, & Locke, 1971;
Measel & Alfieri, 1976; Young & Wincze, 1974).
Extinction has been effective in some instances
(Jones, Simmons, & Frankel, 1974; Lovaas & Sim-
mons, 1969) but not in others (Corte et al., 1971;
Myers, 1975), and conflicting findings also have
been reported with both timeout (Adams, Klinge,
& Keiser, 1973; Corte et al., 1971; Duker, 1975;
Solnick, Rincover, & Peterson, 1977), and over-
correction (Azrin, Gottlieb, Hughart, Wesolowski,
& Rahn, 1975; Foxx & Martin, 1975; Harris &
Romanczyk, 1976; Measel & Alfieri, 1976).

The only treatments that have been consistently
effective in treating self-injury are those based on
punishment in the form of aversive stimulation

(Birnbrauer, 1968; Corte et al., 1971; Dorsey,
Iwata, Ong, & McSween, 1980; Sajwaj, Libet, &
Agras, 1974; Tanner & Zeiler, 1975). However,
due to concerns regarding the appropriate and safe
use of "restrictive" or "intrusive" treatments (e.g.,
ACFMR, 1971), it has been recommended that
punishment be limited to those situations in which
other interventions have failed (May, Risley, Twar-
dosz, Friedman, Bijou, Wexler et al., 1975). It is
therefore important to conduct research that may
eventually identify the limiting conditions of the
various treatments for self-injury. It would be es-
pecially useful if these conditions were known prior
to initiating what otherwise might be an arbitrarily
determined and seemingly endless series of inter-
ventions.

Recent reviews (Carr, 1977; Johnson & Bau-
meister, 1978) have suggested that some of the
treatment failures and inconsistencies
reported
throughout the literature may reflect a lack of un-
derstanding regarding the variables that either pro-
duce or maintain self-injury. In discussing a number
of hypotheses for the motivation of self-injury, Carr
(1977) indicated that the behavior may be rein-
forced through extrinsic sources (e.g., through pos-
itive reinforcement such as attention, or negative
reinforcement such as the termination of demands),
or that the behavior itself may produce some form
of intrinsic reinforcement (e.g., sensory stimulation,
pain reduction). This conceptualization of self-in-
jury as a multiply controlled operant would indicate
that no single form of treatment can be expected
to produce consistent positive results, and it sug-
gests that one means of selecting a potentially ef-
fective treatment would consist of first determining
what events are currently maintaining the behav-
ior.I

I Punishment would be an exceptional case because its
effectiveness does not depend on its ability to alter a rein-
forcement contingency. Rather, punishment is effective due
to the fact that its "aversive" properties are sufficient to
overcome whatever source of reinforcement is maintaining
the behavior (Azrin & Holz, 1966). Given the types of
stimuli that typically have been used as punishing events
(e.g., electric shock, aromatic ammonia), it is not surprising
to find that punishment has been found to be the most
effective treatment for self-injury.

For several reasons, very little behavioral research
has focused on the environmental determinants of
self-injury. First, in light of data from numerous
sources suggesting that self-injury is a learned phe-
nomenon, behavioral researchers and clinicians gen-
erally have dismissed the importance of etiology,
since the conditions that are necessary to develop
or maintain a response may be totally unrelated to
the conditions that are sufficient to alter or eliminate
it. Second, with respect to the initial development
of self-injury, functional analyses have been limited
to animal studies (Holz & Azrin, 1961; Schaeffer,
1970), since experimental attempts to induce self-
injury in humans when it does not already exist
would be regarded as unacceptable from the stand-
point of subject risk/benefit. Third, the apparent
severity of the behavior often suggests the need for
immediate attention,
thereby discouraging at-
tempts to identify features of the social and physical
environment that may serve to maintain self-injury
(see Carr, Newsom, & Binkoff, 1976, for a notable
exception).

Over the past two years, we have been working
toward the development and refinement of an op-
erant methodology whose application might prove
useful in identifying the functional properties of
self-injury on a pretreatment basis. This article de-
scribes and presents the results obtained with our
initial assessment protocol, in which subjects' be-
havior was repeatedly observed across several well-
defined analogue environments. Similar approaches
have been used to examine the effects of physical
aspects of the environment on behaviors such as
stereotypy (Adams, Tallon, & Stangl, 1980) and
pica (Madden, Russo, & Cataldo, 1980). In the
present study, environmental events consisted of
both physical and social manipulations that might
differentially affect the occurrence of self-injury.

University School of Medicine. Interviews and di-
rect observations conducted prior to admission in-
dicated that each subject exhibited moderate to high
rates of self-injurious behavior. Demographic in-
formation for each subject is provided in Table 1.
Sessions were conducted in 3.Om by 3.Om therapy
rooms, equipped with tables and chairs, a variety
of games and toys, and either floor carpeting or a
mat. Each therapy room was adjoined to a 3.Om
by 1.5m observation room via a one-way mirror.

Human Subjects Protection

In order to assess the differential effects of en-
vironment on self-injury, the present study required
that subjects be allowed to engage in self-injurious
behavior while free from mechanical, physical or
chemical restraint. All procedures were reviewed
and approved by a human subjects committee, and
the following safeguards were employed to reduce
the risk of physical damage as a function of self-
injury exhibited during the observation sessions.
First, each subject received a complete medical ex-

amination by a physician, as well as other diagnostic
consultations (e.g., neurological, audiological, vi-
sual). The purpose of the examination was to assess
current physical status and to rule out organic fac-
tors that might be associated with or exacerbated
by self-injury. Potential subjects who presented an
immediate risk of severe physical damage due to
self-injury were not induded in the study. Second,
each subject's physician recommended a criterion
(expressed in terms of either degree of injury or
level of responding or both) for terminating ob-
servation sessions due to physical risk. Physicians
and nurses observed sessions intermittently in order
to assess subjects' self-injury as it occurred and, if
necessary, to modify the criterion. Third, if a sub-
ject's physical condition or level of responding met
the criterion for terminating a session, (s)he was
removed from the therapy room, self-injury was
interrupted via brief physical or mechanical re-
straint, and a physician or nurse examined the sub-
ject and either approved continuation or recom-
mended postponement of the sessions. Fourth,
following each set of four observation sessions, sub-

jects were routinely examined by a nurse who noted
any changes in physical status as a result of self-
injury. Finally, each subject's case was reviewed at
least weekly in both departmental case conferences
and interdisciplinary rounds.

In light of the above procedures, it was felt that
the degree of risk to which subjects were exposed
was no greater (and perhaps considerably less) than
that found in their natural environment. During
the course of the study, subjects often engaged in
self-injury to the extent that minor bleeding or
swelling occurred; however, at no time did subjects
require any medical care due to their self-injury
other than routine deaning and/or topical dressing
by a nurse. On three occasions, a session was ter-
minated prematurely for subject 7, due to an ex-
tremely high rate of forceful head banging against
the floor of the observation room. However, self-
injury was never severe enough to require the ter-
mination of a session for other subjects, and no
subject was ever exciuded from participation in
sessions due to residual effects of accumulated self-
injury.

Response Definitions and Measurement

Observations conducted prior to and upon ad-
mission indicated that all subjects engaged in two
or more self-injurious topographies, with head
banging the most prevalent. Table 2 contains a

listing of the specific self-injurious responses ob-
served for each subject, along with operational def-
initions used in collecting data.

During each session, an observer recorded the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of self-injurious be-
havior from the observation room during contin-
uous, 10-sec intervals (Powell, Martindale, & Kulp,
1975). Interval changeovers were signalled by a
cassette tape containing pre-recorded prompts. The
dependent variable of interest consisted of the per-
centage of intervals during which one or more self-
injurious responses were scored, and was calculated
by dividing the number of positively scored inter-
vals by the total number of intervals, and multi-
plying by 100.

Interobserver Agreement

Two observers independently scored responses
during 35% of the sessions (the range for individ-
uals was 17% to 67%). Overall, occurrence, and
nonoccurrence reliability percentages were calculat-
ed on an interval-by-interval basis by dividing the
number of agreements by the number of agree-
ments plus disagreements, and multiplying by 100
(Bailey & Bostow, 1979; Hawkins & Dotson,
1975). Overall, occurrence, and nonoccurrence
agreement averaged 96.8%, 82.8%, and 91.7%,
respectively. Individual means and ranges for each
subject are presented in Table 3. Lower agreement

ly low levels of responding.

Staff Training

All observers and experimenters who participat-
ed in the study had previous coursework and ex-
perience in the use of behavioral interventions with
developmentally disabled children. In addition,
specific training activities were employed to ensure
that staff could reliably observe behavior and re-
spond appropriately during sessions in which they
served as an experimenter. Each staff member re-
ceived written instructions describing the observa-
tion procedure and experimental protocol. After
reading and reviewing these materials with an ex-
perienced staff member, a new staff member was
assigned to conduct informal observations, reli-
ability observations, and primary data observations
for approximately five sessions each. Persons serving
as experimenters (i.e., those conducting sessions)
did so only after demonstrating competence as an
observer. At least one of the authors was present
during each session and provided feedback regard-
ing compliance with the procedures as needed.

Experimental Conditions

Eight of the nine subjects were exposed to each
of four different conditions in an experimental de-

sign that used a multielement manipulation (Bar-
low & Hayes, 1979; Sidman, 1960; Ulman &
Sulzer-Azaroff, 1975). Subject 1, who served as a
pilot, was exposed to three of the four conditions.
Eight sessions (two per condition) were conducted
each day, with four sessions occurring in the morn-
ing and four in the afternoon. The order of pre-
sentation for each series of four sessions was deter-
mined by random drawing. Each session lasted for
15 min, with the exception of the three occasions
noted earlier. For those conditions requiring the
presence of an experimenter in the room with a
subject, at least three different persons were trained
to conduct sessions for each subject, and were ro-
tated to control for experimenter-specific effects.
Within each series of conditions, experimenters were
changed between sessions, and subjects were briefly
removed from the room.

Social disapproval. The experimenter and sub-
ject entered the therapy room together, where a
variety of toys were available on a table and the
floor, within easy reach of the subject. The exper-
imenter directed the subject to "play with the toys"
while the experimenter "does some work." If the
subject had questionable receptive language or poor
hearing, the experimenter initially placed the sub-
ject in physical contact with the toys. The experi-
menter then sat in a chair across the room and
assumed the appearance of reading a book or mag-

202

azine. Attention was given to the subject contingent
upon each episode of self-injury (either a single
response or a rapid burst of responses), and took
the form of statements of concern and disapproval
(e.g., "Don't do that, you're going to hurt your-
self'; "Look at your hand, don't hit yourself';
etc.), paired with brief physical contact of a non-
punitive nature (e.g., hand on shoulder). All other
responses exhibited by the subject were ignored.
This condition was designed to approximate one
type ofreinforcement contingency that might main-
tain self-injury. In the natural environment, es-
pecially in institutional settings having low staff-
to-client ratios, self-injury often produces much
emotional behavior and attention from caregivers,
while other behavior receives relatively little atten-
tion (Frankel & Simmons, 1976; Lovaas et al.,
1965; Lovaas & Simmons, 1969; Risley, 1968).
Thus, statements of concern and social disapproval
paired with physical contact contingent upon self-
injury may maintain the behavior via inadvertent
delivery of positive reinforcement.

Academic demand. Educational activities ap-
propriate for each subject were selected on the basis
of a special education evaluation conducted upon
admission, or from an individual education pro-
gram plan obtained from the subject's current school
or institutional placement. Examples of the edu-
cational tasks included: placing plastic rings on a
peg, stacking wooden blocks or placing them in a
bucket, putting pieces in a wooden puzzle, thread-
ing large plastic beads on a string, grasping and
holding small objects, and touching various body
parts upon request. The tasks were judged to have
a low probability of occurrence, in that subjects
never completed them spontaneously. In addition,
the tasks were apparently difficult for subjects to
perform even when physically guided.

During the academic session, the experimenter
and subject were seated at a table, and the exper-
imenter presented learning trials using a graduated,
three-prompt procedure (Homer & Keilitz, 1975;
Tucker & Berry, 1980). The experimenter initially
gave a verbal instruction and allowed the subject
5 sec to initiate a response. If, after the 5 sec, the
subject failed to initiate an appropriate response,

the experimenter repeated the instruction, modeled
the correct response, and waited an additional 5
sec. If no response occurred at that point, the ex-
perimenter repeated the instruction and physically
guided the subject through the response, using the
least amount of contact necessary to complete it.
Appropriate modification and/or elimination in the
first two steps occurred for subjects with auditory
or visual deficits. Social praise was delivered upon
completion of the response, regardless of whether
or not modeling or physical guidance were required,
and the next trial was begun. Contingent upon the
occurrence of self-injury at any time during the
session, the experimenter immediately terminated
the trial and turned away from the subject for 30
sec, with an additional 30-sec change-over delay
for repeated self-injury. While such a consequence
for self-injury might resemble an extinction pro-
cedure, it was actually designed to assess whether
or not self-injury was maintained through negative
reinforcement as a result of escaping or avoiding
demand situations (Carr, 1977; Carr et al., 1976;
Jones, Simmons, & Frankel, 1974; Measel & Al-
fieri, 1976; Wolf, Risley, Johnston, Harris, & Al-
len, 1967).

Unstructured play. As in the two previous con-
ditions, an experimenter and subject were present
in the room. No educational tasks were presented,
and a variety of toys were available within the
subject's reach. Throughout the session, the exper-
imenter maintained dose proximity to the subject
(i.e., within im when both were seated), allowed
the subject to engage in spontaneous isolate or co-
operative toy play or to move freely about the room,
and periodically presented toys to the subject with-
out making any demands. The experimenter de-
livered social praise and brief physical contact con-
tingent upon appropriate behavior-the absence of
self-injury-at least once every 30 sec. Self-inju-
rious behavior was ignored, unless its severity reached
the point where the session was terminated. This
condition served as a control procedure for the
presence of an experimenter, the availability of
potentially stimulating materials, the absence of
demands, the delivery of social approval for ap-
propriate behavior, and the lack of approval for

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF SELF-INJURY

self-injury. Additionally, it was designed to serve
the function of an "enriched environment" (Hor-
ner, 1980), in which relatively little self-injury might
be expected to occur.

Alone. The child was placed in the therapy room
alone, without access to toys or any other materials
that might serve as external sources of stimulation.
The purpose of this condition was to approximate
a situation that would be considered "impover-
ished" or "austere" from a social and physical
standpoint (Homer, 1980). There is growing evi-
dence to suggest that self-stimulatory behavior is
motivated through self-produced reinforcement of
a sensory nature (Rincover, 1978; Rincover, Cook,
Peoples, & Packard, 1979), and it is possible that
self-injury may be similarly maintained (Carr, 1977;
Dorsey, Iwata, Reid, & Davis, in press; Favell,
McGimsey, & Schell, 1982; Parrish, Aguerrevere,
Dorsey, & Iwata, 1980; Rincover & Devany, 1982).
If so, one might expect to observe higher levels of
self-injury in situations where minimal amounts of
stimulation are provided by the environment.

The above procedures continued until: (1) ap-
parent stability in the level of self-injury was ob-
served, (2) unstable levels of responding persisted
in all conditions for 5 days, or (3) 12 days ofsessions
were completed. The length of subject participation
in this study averaged 8 days (range = 4-1 1),
while the total number of sessions run per subject
averaged 30 (range = 24-53).

RESULTS
Figure 1 summarizes the results for the nine
subjects. For each subject, the numerical data in
Figure 1 indicate the overall mean percent of in-
tervals of self-injury and its standard deviation, and
means for the separate experimental conditions.
These data allow for an examination of overall
responding between subjects, as well as condition-
by-condition comparisons within subjects. How-
ever, in light of the rather large differences observed
in subjects' overall level of self-injury, it is difficult
to make condition-by-condition comparisons be-
tween subjects on the basis of absolute data alone
(e.g., 81.3% vs 44.4% vs 8.9% self-injury for sub-

jects 4, 7, and 9, respectively, during the Alone
condition). For this reason, the condition means for
individual subjects are also portrayed graphically
in standard deviation units above or below a sub-
ject's overall mean. Thus, Figure 1 provides a sum-
mary of both absolute level and relative variability
of subjects' self-injurious behavior.

Several differences can be seen in the present
data. First, the level of responding varied widely
across subjects, with the overall mean percent of
intervals of self-injury ranging from a low of 4.5%
(subjects 1 and 9) to a high of 91.2% (subject 6).
Second, considerable variability was observed with-
in subjects across the different experimental con-
ditions. The within-subject variability was evident
regardless of a subject's overall level of responding.
For example, subjects 1 and 6, who displayed
markedly different overall levels of self-injury, both
showed variable responding across conditions. Third,
within-subject patterns of responding did not ap-
pear related to the overall level of self-injury. For
example, subjects 3 and 9, both of whom displayed
relatively little self-injury, differed with respect to
the condition in which self-injury was found to be
the greatest.

In spite ofthe above differences, the data provide
information regarding specific conditions that may
affect self-injury, and the results shown in Figure
1 suggest five general patterns of responding for
the present subjects. The first pattern was charac-
terized by a relatively low level of self-injury during
the Unstructured play condition. For all of the eight
subjects exposed to this condition (subject 1 was
exduded), self-injury during Unstructured play was
at or below their overall mean level, and four of
the subjects (subjects 2, 4, 5, 9) showed less self-
injury during Unstructured play when compared
to any of the other conditions. A second pattern
was reflected in the data for subjects 4, 6, 7, and
9. For these individuals, self-injury was greatest
during the Alone condition, in which access to
external sources of stimulation was minimized. This
pattern is most dearly evident in subject 4's data.
However, subjects 6 and 9, whose overall level of
self-injury differed considerably, also displayed more
self-injury during the Alone condition. A third pat-

more conditions. Subject 6's data might also be
considered an example of undifferentiated respond-
ing merely because he exhibited very high levels of
self-injury across all conditions, even though the
greatest amount was seen during the Alone con-
dition.

Figure 2 presents session-by-session data for four
subjects whose results are characteristic of different
response patterns. Subjects 1, 4, and 5 exhibited
higher levels of self-injury during the Academic
demand, Alone, and Social disapproval conditions,
respectively, while subject 2 engaged in relatively

high levels of self-injury across all experimental
conditions.

DISCUSSION
Present results indicate that the occurrence of
self-injury varies considerably, both between and
within individuals. More importantly, the data show
that within-subject variability is not merely a ran-
dom process. In six of the nine subjects, higher
levels ofself-injury were consistently associated with
a specific stimulus condition. These results provide

206

BRIAN A. IWATA et al.

direct empirical evidence that self-injury may be a
function of different sources of reinforcement (Carr,
1977), a finding that has significant implications
for treatment.

In four of our subjects, self-injury was relatively
high during the Alone condition, suggesting a form
of self-stimulation as a motivational variable. As-
suming that this analysis is a correct one, knowledge
of the specific reinforcing event provided by self-
injury would greatly enhance the effectiveness of
reinforcement procedures designed to reduce the
behavior. For example, on several occasions, we
have noticed that visually impaired clients engage
in eye-poking that probably intensifies visual stim-
ulation. Intervention for such individuals might
include the use of bright flashing lights, massage
to the ocular area, etc., that is delivered contingent
upon the absence of self-injury, or produced by a
response that is incompatible with self-injury (Fa-
vell et al., 1982). Alternatively, effective extinction
procedures may not require the withholding of so-
cial consequences but, instead, the elimination or
attenuation of sensory stimulation derived from the
response (e.g., Dorsey et al., in press; Rincover,
1978; Rincover et al., 1979; Rincover & Devany,
1982).

Two subjects exhibited more self-injury during
the Academic sessions, where the behavior func-
tioned to briefly terminate demands made by an
experimenter. The pattern of behavior shown by
these subjects resembles that described by Carr et
al. (1976) who were able to reduce self-injury by
including non-demand periods (reading entertain-
ing stories to the subject) during a demand con-
dition. The use of "guided compliance" trials, in
which a client's self-injury is followed by physical
assistance in completing the desired academic re-
sponse and continuation of the session until a per-
formance criterion is reached, might also be effective
in "extinguishing" the negative reinforcement pro-
vided through escape responding. On the other
hand, a typical extinction technique-the contin-
gent withdrawal of attention-would be expected
to strengthen the behavior.

Only one subject in the present study showed
higher levels of self-injury during the Social dis-

approval condition. This finding was rather sur-
prising in light of the fact that social attention often
has been suggested as a likely source of reinforce-
ment for self-injury. However, in situations where
it can be determined that clients engage in self-
injury for the attention that it produces, extinction
(ignoring), timeout, and DRO would seem to be
the most effective treatments.

Three of the subjects showed either undifferen-
tiated patterns or high levels of self-injury across
all stimulus conditions. Although it is impossible
to determine what may have accounted for these
results, several possibilities appear likely. Each of
these subjects was either quite young or profoundly
retarded, and it is possible that the different con-
ditions were not dearly discriminable to them. Al-
ternatively, the behavior may have been a function
of variables that were not controlled in the present
study. Finally, self-injury in these individuals may
represent a response that serves multiple func-
tions-providing stimulation when little is avail-
able, producing attention from others, and termi-
nating undesirable situations. The latter possibility
is most significant in that it suggests the need for
different treatments applied to the same individual,
depending upon the situation in which self-injury
is observed.

Although clear differences were observed in a
majority of our subjects, the present data must be
regarded as limited in two respects. First, our meth-
odology did not control for very subtle aspects of
contingencies that may affect behavior. For ex-
ample, assuming that the attention provided during
the Social disapproval condition serves a reinforcing
function, the reinforcement is provided on a very
frequent basis.2 The Alone condition differed from
the Social attention condition in at least two re-
spects: it not only represented a condition of stim-

2 The use of these schedules raises the question of whether
or not procedures in this study could have contributed to
the development ofself-injury in our subjects. Data indicating
an increasing function across time would have suggested that
learning or acquisition was taking place. However, only the
data for subject 2 showed any increase across sessions, and
it can be seen (Figure 2) that this subject's self-injury was
occurring at high levels during initial sessions.

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF SELF-INJURY

ulus deprivation, but also eliminated access to all
social attention. In light of the fact that an operant
response may occur at higher rates during the initial
stages of extinction than during a CRF condition,
a high level of self-injury during the Alone con-
dition might not be maintained by reinforcement
of a self-stimulatory nature, but by the withdrawal
of social reinforcement. Thus, our methodology
does not isolate conclusively the exact nature of the
contingency responsible for maintaining self-injury,
and we foresee the need for constructing an ex-
tended series of conditions that progressively ana-
lyzes variables such as reinforcement schedules. A
second limitation can be found in the incomplete-
ness of our analysis. For example, if subjects exhibit
self-injury primarily in demand situations, a re-
duction of self-injury following a reversal of the
apparent contingency operating in that environment
(i.e., the elimination of escape as a consequence for
self-injury) would provide stronger evidence that
the behavior was, in fact, maintained through neg-
ative reinforcement. Furthermore, a comparison of
that technique to one whose use is unrelated to the
concept of negative reinforcement for self-injury
(e.g., timeout, DRO) would provide the ultimate
test ofthe clinical utility ofthe assessment procedure
in selecting effective treatments. Although no treat-
ment data are included in this study, all of the
present subjects were provided a therapy program
following the completion of their assessment. Dur-
ing the course of that treatment, we have conducted
several types of intervention analyses, the results of
which have been very encouraging in cases where
self-injury was dearly differentiated during the as-
sessment period.

In addition to the above limitations, several dis-
tinctive features of the present study are worth
noting. The use ofenvironments that may not close-
ly resemble naturalistic situations was based on our
experience that it is often difficult to either precisely
identify or control naturally occurring events related
to self-injury. Also, by using well-defined analogue
environments, it was possible to limit subjects' in-
clusion in the study to an amount of time no greater
than that of a typical baseline period, yet provide
data on a number of variables that may affect self-

injury. Both of these features (operational definition
of the environment and limited duration) should
increase the likelihood that the present methodol-
ogy, or one similar to it, could be incorporated into
the design of most intervention research. Procedures
for minimizing risks to subjects were also carefully
considered, and provide a model for screening and
monitoring that might be considered essential in
research of this type. In particular, the independent
monitoring system was seen as a safeguard to ex-
perimenters as well as subjects, and should be em-
ployed whenever possible.

The major focus of the present study was on the
identification of variables that are associated with
(and may serve to maintain) the occurrence of self-
injury. However, it is important to note that lower
levels ofself-injury were consistently associated with
the control condition, which included the avail-
ability of toys, the relative absence of demands,
and reinforcement for behavior that was generally
incompatible with self-injury. This finding is con-
sistent with previous data (Homer, 1980) sug-
gesting that physical and social characteristics as-
sociated with an "enriched environment" may
produce a number ofbeneficial outcomes, including
reductions in self-injury. In addition to enrichment,
in cases where individuals exhibit few adaptive be-
haviors, successful treatment of self-injury may in-
clude the active shaping and/or reinforcement of
specific appropriate responses, such as toy play
(Favell et al., 1982).

In summary, the present study offers a meth-
odology for examining the multiple effects of en-
vironment on the occurrence ofself-injury. Whether
or not it will contribute to a more thorough un-
derstanding of the etiology of self-injury remains
to be seen.3 However, it is dear that improvements
are needed in our approach to the treatment of self-
injury. The present results suggest that it may be

I The present study does not address the issue of environ-
mental versus physiological determinants of self-injury. How-
ever, assuming that there may be a physiological basis for
the development or maintenance of self-injury, research of
the present type should suggest ways to reduce the effects of
environmental variance when conducting biobehavioral in-
vestigations.

208

possible to empirically identify variables that affect
self-injury prior to implementing lengthy treatment
conditions. Ifso, we can no longer afford to conduct
clinical research in which the baseline data provide
information regarding behavior in a single invariant
situation, or to make treatment decisions based on
a "best guess" as to what might constitute the most
effective means of intervention.
