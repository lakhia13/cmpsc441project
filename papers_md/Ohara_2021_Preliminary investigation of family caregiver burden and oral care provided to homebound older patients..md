Abstract

Objectives: Family caregivers play an important role in maintaining the oral health of

homebound older adults. Thus, this preliminary study investigated family caregivers'

burdens and the oral care they provide to homebound older patients.

Material and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A questionnaire was

distributed to 230 family caregivers of homebound older patients. We used the Japa-

nese version of the Zarit Burden Interview (J-ZBI) to measure caregiver burden. The

cut-off score for the J-ZBI was 21 points. Caregivers with a care burden score below

21 points formed the mild group, while those scoring 21 points or more were

included in the moderate/severe group. The differences between the groups were

examined. The implementation status of oral care was assessed by the amount of

time caregivers spent providing oral care and related concerns. The degree of inde-

pendence for homebound older patients was measured using the Barthel Index. Mul-

tiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the factors associated

with the severity of caregiver burden.

Results: A total of 114 caregivers returned the questionnaires by mail (response rate:

49.6%). The moderate/severe care burden group represented 80.7% of the care-

givers. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the level of patient inde-

pendence and time spent performing oral care were significantly associated with the

severity of caregiver burden.

Conclusions: The results show that family caregivers experiencing high caregiver burden

spent less time providing oral care than caregivers who reported less caregiver burden.

Thus, support for oral health management provided by oral health professionals is con-

sidered necessary for family with a high caregiver burden of homebound older patients.

conducted via a questionnaire survey that made it easy to collect data

for a relatively small sample size.

In this study, approximately 80% of family caregivers who rated

their caregiver burden as moderate or severe spent significantly less

time providing oral care and cared for patients with higher levels of

independence than caregivers who perceived their caregiver burden

as mild. Generally, family caregivers of older adults with low BI scores

may experience greater caregiver burden because lower BI scores

indicate that older patients require nursing care and additional long-

term support in their lives (Mahoney & Barthel, 1965). However, in

the present study, caregivers of older adults with a relatively high

level of independence reported a higher level of caregiver burden.

This is possibly because it influenced the long-term care insurance

system in Japan, which expands the range of services available as the

to the severer the degree of nursing care (Tamiya et al., 2011). For

example, family caregiver burden was relatively low since the nursing

care service sufficiently by the public assurance system could be pro-

vided if the independence of homebound older patients was low. On
