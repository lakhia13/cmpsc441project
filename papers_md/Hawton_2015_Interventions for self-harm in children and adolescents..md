Background

A B S T R A C T

Self-harm (SH; intentional self-poisoning or self-injury) is common in children and adolescents, often repeated, and strongly associated
with  suicide.  This  is  an  update  of  a  broader  Cochrane  review  on  psychosocial  and  pharmacological  treatments  for  deliberate  SH  first
published in 1998 and previously updated in 1999. We have now divided the review into three separate reviews; this review is focused on
psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for SH in children and adolescents.

Objectives

To identify all randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions, pharmacological agents, or natural products for SH in children
and adolescents, and to conduct meta-analyses (where possible) to compare the effects of specific treatments with comparison types of
treatment (e.g., treatment as usual (TAU), placebo, or alternative pharmacological treatment) for children and adolescents who SH.

Search methods

For this update the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CCDAN Specialised
Register (30 January 2015).

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial or pharmacological treatments with treatment as usual, alternative
treatments, or placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment in children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with a recent (within
six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services.

Data collection and analysis

Two  reviewers  independently  selected  trials,  extracted  data,  and  appraised  study  quality,  with  consensus.  For  binary  outcomes,  we
calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes measured using the same scale we calculated

the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI; for those measured using different scales we calculated the standard mean difference (SMD) and 95%
CI. Meta-analysis was only possible for two interventions: dialectical behaviour therapy for adolescents and group-based psychotherapy.
For these analyses, we pooled data using a random-effects model.

Main results

We included 11 trials, with a total of 1,126 participants. The majority of participants were female (mean = 80.6% in 10 trials reporting
gender). All trials were of psychosocial interventions; there were none of pharmacological treatments. With the exception of dialectical
behaviour therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) and group-based therapy, assessments of specific interventions were based on single trials. We
downgraded the quality of evidence owing to risk of bias or imprecision for many outcomes.

Therapeutic assessment appeared to increase adherence with subsequent treatment compared with TAU (i.e., standard assessment; n =
70; k = 1; OR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.70 to 15.39), but this had no apparent impact on repetition of SH at either 12 (n = 69; k = 1; OR 0.75, 95% CI
0.18 to 3.06; GRADE: low quality) or 24 months (n = 69; k = 1; OR = 0.69, 05% CI 0.23 to 2.14; GRADE: low quality evidence). These results are
based on a single cluster randomised trial, which may overestimate the effectiveness of the intervention.

For patients with multiple episodes of SH or emerging personality problems, mentalisation therapy was associated with fewer adolescents
scoring above the cut-off for repetition of SH based on the Risk-Taking and Self-Harm Inventory 12 months post-intervention (n = 71; k =
1; OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78; GRADE: moderate quality). DBT-A was not associated with a reduction in the proportion of adolescents
repeating SH when compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (n = 104; k = 2; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.40; GRADE: low quality). In the
latter trial, however, the authors reported a significantly greater reduction over time in frequency of repeated SH in adolescents in the DBT
condition, in whom there were also significantly greater reductions in depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation.

We found no significant treatment effects for group-based therapy on repetition of SH for individuals with multiple episodes of SH at either
the six (n = 430; k = 2; OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 5.24; GRADE: low quality) or 12 month (n = 490; k = 3; OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.97; GRADE: low
quality) assessments, although considerable heterogeneity was associated with both (I2 = 65% and 77% respectively). We also found no
significant differences between the following treatments and TAU in terms of reduced repetition of SH: compliance enhancement (three
month follow-up assessment: n = 63; k = 1; OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.08; GRADE: very low quality), CBT-based psychotherapy (six month
follow-up assessment: n = 39; k = 1; OR = 1.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 11.73; GRADE: very low quality), home-based family intervention (six month
follow-up assessment: n = 149; k = 1; OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.51; GRADE: low quality), and provision of an emergency card (12 month
follow-up assessment: n = 105, k = 1; OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.04; GRADE: very low quality). No data on adverse effects, other than the
planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were reported.

Authors' conclusions

There are relatively few trials of interventions for children and adolescents who have engaged in SH, and only single trials contributed to
all but two comparisons in this review. The quality of evidence according to GRADE criteria was mostly very low. There is little support
for the effectiveness of group-based psychotherapy for adolescents with multiple episodes of SH based on the results of three trials, the
evidence from which was of very low quality according to GRADE criteria. Results for therapeutic assessment, mentalisation, and dialectical
behaviour therapy indicated that these approaches warrant further evaluation. Despite the scale of the problem of SH in children and
adolescents there is a paucity of evidence of effective interventions. Further large-scale trials, with a range of outcome measures including
adverse events, and investigation of therapeutic mechanisms underpinning these interventions, are required. It is increasingly apparent
that development of new interventions should be done in collaboration with patients to ensure that these are likely to meet their needs.
Use of an agreed set of outcome measures would assist evaluation and both comparison and meta-analysis of trials.

Interventions for children and adolescents who self-harm

Why is this review important?

Self-harm (SH), which includes intentional self-poisoning/overdose and self-injury, is a major problem in children and adolescents in many
countries and is strongly linked to risk of future suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed.

Who will be interested in this review?

Clinicians working with young people who engage in SH, policy makers, young people who themselves have self-harmed or may be at risk
of doing so, and their families and relatives.

What questions does this review aim to answer?

This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH
aimed specifically at children and adolescents. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial and
pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes, particularly with regards to

investigating whether there are specific treatments for children and adolescents who SH which have greater benefit compared to routine
care in terms of treatment adherence and improvements in psychological well-being.

Which studies were included in the review?

To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or pharmacological treatments for
children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH and presented to clinical services.

What does the evidence from the review tell us?

There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many
countries. Providing therapeutic assessment may improve attendance at subsequent treatment sessions. Only one therapeutic approach
- mentalisation - was associated with a reduction in frequency of repetition of SH. However this effect was only modest and the trial was
small, which prevents us from being able to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this treatment. There was no clear evidence
of effectiveness for compliance enhancement, individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based psychotherapy, home-based family
intervention, or provision of an emergency card, nor was there clear evidence for group therapy for adolescents with a history of multiple
episodes of SH.

What should happen next?

Therapeutic assessment, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation. While in a single small study,
individual CBT-based psychotherapy appeared ineffective, further evaluation of this treatment is also desirable given the favourable results
found in adults who SH. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and
evaluation of specific therapies for this population.

Quality was downgraded as information on allocation
concealment, participant blinding, outcome assessor
blinding, and selective outcome reporting was not ad-
equately described. The trial was further downgraded
as the same therapists delivered both the intervention
and control treatments leading to possible confound-
ing which could have led to a reduction in the demon-
strated effect.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% CI) is based on the as-
sumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CBT: cognitive behavioural therapy; CI: confidence interval; OR: odds ratio; RCT: randomised controlled trial; SH: self-harm.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1 Risk of bias was rated as VERY SERIOUS as information on allocation concealment, participant blinding, outcome assessor blinding, and selective outcome reporting was not
adequately described raising the possibility of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias. Given that the same therapists delivered both the intervention
and control treatments in this trial, there is also the possibility of confounding which could have led to a reduction in the demonstrated effect.
2 Imprecision was rated as SERIOUS owing to the wide confidence interval associated with the estimate of treatment effect.

1 Risk of bias was rated as SERIOUS as the nature of the intervention means that clinical personnel could not have remained blind to treatment allocation suggesting that
performance and detection bias may have been present.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1 Risk of bias was rated as SERIOUS as the nature of the intervention means that clinical personnel could not have remained blind to treatment allocation suggesting that
performance and detection bias may have been present.
2 Imprecision was rated as SERIOUS owing to the wide confidence interval associated with the estimate of treatment effect.

Quality was downgraded as an open random numbers
table was used to generate the allocation sequence and,
as allocation was not concealed, there is possible selec-
tion bias. Quality was further downgraded as the nature
of this intervention means it is unlikely participants and
clinical personnel would have been blind to treatment
allocation and, as no details on outcome assessor blind-
ing were provided, performance and detection bias can-
not be ruled out. Lastly, there was an error in the ran-
domisation sequence such that five participants in the
intervention group either did not receive emergency
cards, or alternatively, received them only after a delay
thereby invalidating follow-up data for these five indi-
viduals.

Description of the condition

The term ‘self-harm’ is used to describe all intentional acts of self-
poisoning (such as overdoses) or self-injury (such as self-cutting),
irrespective of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation
(Hawton  2003).  Thus  it  includes  acts  intended  to  result  in  death
(‘attempted suicide’), those without suicidal intent (for example, to
communicate distress, to temporarily reduce unpleasant feelings),
and those with mixed motivation (Hjelmeland 2002; Scoliers 2009).
The term ‘parasuicide’ was introduced by Kreitman 1969 to include
the same range of behaviour. However, ‘parasuicide’ has been used
in the USA to refer specifically to acts of self-harm without suicidal
intent (Linehan 1991), and the term has largely fallen into disuse
in the UK and other countries. In the fifth version of the Diagnostic
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-5;  American
Psychiatric Association 2013), two types of self-harming behaviour
are included as conditions for further study, namely "Non-Suicidal
Self  Injury"  (NSSI)  and  "Suicidal  Behavior  Disorder"  (SBD).  Many
researchers and clinicians, however, believe this to be an artificial
and somewhat misleading categorisation (Kapur 2013), and recent
research  has  shown  a  high  level  of  co-occurance  between  NSSI
and attempted suicide, in particular among young people (Andover
2012). We have therefore used the approach favoured in the UK and
some other countries of conceptualising all intentional self-harm in
a single category, namely self-harm (SH).

SH is a major problem in children and adolescents (Hawton 2012a).
Unlike  suicide,  in  most  countries  SH  in  young  people  occurs
far  more  commonly  in  females  than  males  (Evans  2005).  SH  is
uncommon  below  the  age  of  12  years  (Hawton  2003);  from  age
12 years onwards, SH becomes increasingly frequent in girls such
that  the  female:male  ratio  between  12  and  15  years  of  age  is
as  high  as  five  or  six  to  one.  This  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the
increased prevalence of depression in young adolescent females,
and  alcohol  consumption  and  engagement  in  sexual  activity  in
both genders (Patton 2007). The gender ratio decreases in the older
teenage  years  as  the  behaviour  becomes  more  frequent  in  boys
and  rates  level  off  in  girls.  SH  is  more  frequent  in  adolescents
from  lower  socioeconomic  groups  (Burrows  2010).  In  the  UK,  SH
has  become  more  common  in  adolescents  in  recent  decades,
at  least  as  reflected  in  hospital  presentations  (Hawton  2003).
However,  only  about  one  in  eight  adolescents  in  the  community
who self-report engaging in SH ever presents to hospital (Hawton
2002;  McMahon  2014;  Ystgaard  2009).  In  fact,  it  has  become
increasingly  apparent  that  SH  in  adolescents  in  the  community
(without  hospital  presentation)  is  extremely  common  (Hawton
2012a; Madge 2008; McMahon 2014), although less is known about
these individuals.

In  children  and  adolescents  who  present  to  hospital,  the  most
common  method  of  SH  is  self-poisoning,  with  overdoses  of
analgesics  (especially  paracetamol)  being  common  in  some
countries,  particularly  those  of  high  income  (Hawton  2012b;
Sheen  2002).  In  a  multicentre  study  of  child  and  adolescent  SH
presentations to hospitals in England, three-quarters of individuals
were girls and self-poisoning occurred in just over three-quarters
of episodes (Hawton 2012b). Self-cutting is the next most frequent
method  for  those  who  present  to  hospital.  In  the  community,
however,  self-cutting  and  other  forms  of  self-mutilation  are  far
more frequent than self-poisoning (Madge 2008).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

SH  (and  suicide)  in  adolescents  is  the  result  of  a  complex
interplay  between  genetic,  biological,  psychiatric,  psychosocial,
social, and cultural factors (Hawton 2012a). Relationship problems
are common in adolescents who engage in SH, especially problems
with  family  members.  Relationship  problems  with  partners  are
more  common  in  older  adolescents  than  in  younger  adolescents
(Hawton  2012b);  there  may  also  be  a  history  of  emotional,
physical,  or  sexual  abuse  (Madge  2011).  Bullying,  including
cyberbullying,  can  also  increase  the  risk  of  SH  (Hinduja  2010).
Psychiatric  disorders  are  common  in  adolescents  who  present
to  hospital  because  of  SH,  with  depression,  anxiety,  ADHD,  and
eating disorders being particularly frequent (Hawton 2013). While
personality  disorders  should  not  be  diagnosed  in  adolescents,
emergent pathological personality traits may be apparent during
this  phase  of  development,  with  traits  similar  to  those  in  adult
borderline personality disorder being found in some adolescents
who  engage  in  frequent  repetition  of  SH  (Crowell  2012).  Poor
emotion  regulation  abilities  or  poor  emotional  intelligence  may
also  contribute  to  the  risk  of  SH  in  this  population  (Mikolajczak
2009).

SH in adolescence often has a 'contagious' quality, and exposure
to  SH  (and  suicide)  in  friends  and  family  members  can  be  a
strong  influence  (Hawton  2002;  McMahon  2013;  O'Connor  2014).
Adolescents  are  also  vulnerable  to  media  influences;  SH  in  both
traditional  media,  such  as  films  and  television  soaps,  and  new
media, especially the Internet and social networking (Daine 2013),
are important.

Psychological  influences  on  SH  in  young  people  include  feelings
of  entrapment,  lack  of  belonging,  and  perceiving  oneself  as  a
burden  (O'Connor  2012).  Deficiencies  in  problem-solving  skills
may also be relevant (Speckens 2005). Other contributors include
impulsivity,
perfectionism, 
hopelessness, and poor parent-child attachment (Hawton 2012a).
On  the  other  hand,  social  attachment  to  family  (Carter  2007),
friends, and school may be protective (King 2008; Stallard 2013).

low  self-esteem,  social 

isolation, 

Repetition  of  SH  is  common  in  adolescents,  with  15-25%  of
individuals who present to hospital following SH returning to the
same  hospital  following  a  repeat  episode  within  a  year  (Hawton
2008b). There may also be other repeat episodes that do not result
in hospital presentation. Repetition is also common in adolescents
who do not present to clinical care (Hawton 2002).

While  suicide  is  relatively  uncommon  in  younger  adolescents,
SH  generally  increases  the  risk  of  future  suicide,  especially  in
adolescent  males.  Risk  is  also  increased  in  those  who  repeat
SH  and,  contrary  to  clinical  opinion,  possibly  in  those  who  cut
themselves  (compared  to  those  who  engage  in  self-poisoning)
(Hawton 2012c).

Of  particular  concern  regarding  after-care  of  adolescents  who
engage SH and who present to hospital is the fact that adherence
to recommended treatment tends to be relatively poor; between
25% and 50% of adolescents will not attend any follow-up sessions
(Granboulan 2001; Taylor 1984).

Description of the intervention

Treatment  for  SH  in  children  and  adolescents  may  involve
psychosocial  interventions,  pharmacological  interventions,  or  a
combination of the two approaches.

Psychosocial interventions

(Speckens  2005), 

Given  the  role  of  psychological  influences,  and  particularly
problem-solving  deficits 
in  children  and
adolescents who engage in SH, psychological approaches used in
the treatment of these individuals typically involve brief individual
or  group-based  psychological  therapy 
(such  as  cognitive-
behavioural  therapy  or  problem-solving  therapy),  family  therapy,
and  contact  interventions;  enhanced  assessment  interventions
may  also  be  used.  Treatment  may  vary  in  terms  of  initial
management,  location  of  treatment,  continuity,  and  intensity  or
frequency  of  contact  with  therapists.  There  is  also  considerable
variation  among  countries  in  the  availability  of  services  to
provide  such  interventions.  Consequently,  there  is  no  standard
psychosocial  treatment  for  SH  in  children  and  adolescents.
However, in high income countries treatment generally consists of a
combination of assessment, support, involvement of relatives, and
individual psychological therapies.

Pharmacological interventions

Given  the  prevalence  of  depression  in  children  and  adolescents
who  present  to  hospital  following  an  episode  of  SH  (Hawton
2013),  pharmacological  treatments  may  include  antidepressants.
Other pharmacological agents, such as benzodiazepines and other
anxiolytics,  may  also  be  prescribed.  However,  treatment  with
pharmacological agents is generally less common than treatment
with psychosocial interventions, partly due to concerns about the
risk of exacerbating suicidality (Miller 2014).

How the intervention might work

Psychosocial interventions

The  mechanisms  of  action  of  psychosocial  interventions  might
include helping adolescents improve their coping skills and tackle
specific  problems,  overcoming  psychiatric  disorders,  improving
self-esteem,  increasing  a  sense  of  social  connectedness,  and
reducing  impulsivity,  aggression,  and  unhelpful  reactions  to
distressing situations.

Cognitive behavioural therapy-based psychotherapy

This  intervention  includes  both  cognitive  behavioural  therapy
(CBT)  and  problem-solving  therapy  (PST).  CBT  helps  patients
identify and critically evaluate the ways in which they interpret and
evaluate disturbing emotional experiences and events (Westbrook
2011), and aims to help them change the ways in which they deal
with  problems.  This  is  achieved  in  three  steps:  first,  patients  are
helped  to  change  the  ways  in  which  they  interpret  and  evaluate
distressing  emotions;  second,  patients  learn  strategies  to  help
them  change  the  way  in  which  they  think  about  the  meanings
and  consequences  of  these  emotions;  finally,  with  the  benefit
of  modified  interpretation  of  emotions  and  events,  patients  are
helped to change their behaviour and develop positive functional
behaviour (Jones 2012).

PST,  which  is  an  integral  part  of  CBT,  assumes  that  ineffective
and maladaptive coping behaviours might be overcome by helping
patients  learn  skills  to  actively,  constructively,  and  effectively
solve the problems they face in their daily lives (Nezu 2010), and
that  this  will  reduce  SH.  PST  consists  of  encouraging  patients  to
consciously  and  rationally  appraise  problems,  reduce  or  modify
the  negative  emotions  generated  by  problems,  and  develop
a  range  of  possible  solutions  to  address  problems  (D'Zurilla

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2010).  Treatment  goals  include  helping  patients  to  develop  a
positive problem-solving orientation, use rational problem-solving
strategies,  reduce  the  tendency  to  avoid  problem-solving,  and
reduce the use of impulsive problem-solving strategies (Washburn
2012). Homework assignments are an essential component of CBT-
based psychotherapy.

Interventions for patients with multiple episodes of SH or
emerging personality problems

Dialectical behaviour therapy

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) in adults combines problem-
solving training, skills training, cognitive modification training, and
mindfulness techniques (Washburn 2012), encouraging patients to
accept their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours without necessarily
attempting to change, suppress, or avoid these experiences (Lynch
2006).  Within  this  framework,  the  aim  of  DBT  is  to  help  patients
better  regulate  their  emotions,  achieve  a  sense  of  interpersonal
effectiveness,  become  more  tolerant  of  distressing  thoughts  or
feelings, and become better at managing their own thoughts and
behaviours (Linehan 1993; Linehan 2007). The primary treatment
goals of DBT are therefore threefold: to reduce SH, behaviours that
interfere  with  the  success  of  treatment  (such  as  treatment  non-
adherence), and any other factors which may adversely affect the
patent's quality of life (such as frequency or duration of psychiatric
hospitalizations) (Linehan 1993).

Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) is a clinical
programme for adolescents with severe personality difficulties and
co-morbid  mental  health  problems.  DBT-A  has  been  adapted  by
Miller 2007 from Linehan’s initial conceptualisation of DBT which
was  developed  for  adults  diagnosed  with  borderline  personality
disorder.  DBT-A  typically  includes  a  combination  of  individual
and  family  sessions  (Mehlum  2014).  As  the  aim  of  DBT-A  is  to
help  adolescents  change  or  adjust  to  maladaptive  personality
characteristics, the treatment is intensive and relatively prolonged,
although usually less so than in adults (James 2008; Miller 2007).

Mentalisation

Mentalisation refers to the ability to understand the actions of both
the self and of others as meaningful given knowledge of the desires,
beliefs,  feelings,  emotions,  and  motivations  that  underscore  the
behaviour  (Bateman  2004;  Choi-Kain  2008).  During  times  of
interpersonal  stress,  however,  individuals  may  fail  to  represent
experiences  in  terms  of  mental  states,  and  instead  become
overwhelmed  with  negative  thoughts  and  feelings  about  the  self
(Rossouw 2013). Behaviours such as SH may therefore represent an
escape from these negative self-evaluations. Mentalisation therapy
aims  to  improve  patients’  ability  to  empathise  with  others  by
developing  an  understanding  of  how  their  own  behaviours  may
impact on the feelings of others, and to regulate their own emotions
more effectively (Rossouw 2013).

Group-based psychotherapy

In  the  treatment  of  adolescents  who  have  engaged  in  SH,
group  psychotherapy  has  included  the  integration  of  techniques
from  several  therapies,  including  CBT,  DBT-A,  and  specific  group
techniques  (Green  2011;  Wood  2001a).  In  adolescents,  group-
based  psychotherapy  may  be  more  effective  than  individual
psychotherapy  as  it  provides  patients  with  a  chance  to  work
on  skills  related  to  developing  interpersonal  relationships  and

problem-solving, which are deficient in some suicidal adolescents
(Evans 2004; Speckens 2005).

Enhanced assessment approaches

Therapeutic  assessment  combines  standard  psychosocial  history
and  risk  assessment  techniques  with  cognitive-analytic  therapy
and  PST  (Ougrin  2011a).  Adolescents  learn  to  identify  sources  of
psychological  pain  and  their  connection  to  problem  behaviours
such  as  SH,  and  identify  ways  to  break  this  cycle.  The  aim  is
to  enhance  adherence  with  subsequent  treatment  and  therefore
potential benefit from it.

Compliance enhancement approaches

Given  the  known  poor  treatment  adherence  of  adolescents
who  engage  in  SH  (Granboulan  2001;  Taylor  1984),  efforts  to
maintain  contact  with  patients,  such  as  following  up  patients  in
the  community,  as  well  as  efforts  to  address  factors  likely  to
impede attendance at treatment sessions may be used to enhance
treatment engagement and adherence (Spirito 2002).

Home-based family interventions

Home-based family intervention typically involves conjoint therapy
sessions  with  the  child  or  adolescent  and  family  members.  It
includes  negotiation  of  goals,  exploration  of  the  SH  episode,
communication  between  family  members,  problem  solving,  and
discussion of developmental issues and their impact on the family.
The  basis  of  this  therapy  is  that  SH  in  young  people  may  relate
to  family  dysfunction  and  that  this  therapeutic  approach  could
help families function better and hence reduce the risk of suicidal
ideation and SH (Harrington 1998).

Remote contact interventions

Contact interventions, particularly emergency card interventions,
can  be  used  to  encourage  patients  to  seek  help  when  they  feel
distressed as well as offering provision of on-demand emergency
contact with psychiatric services (Kapur 2010). In adolescents this
has  been  used  as  a  means  of  gaining  admission  to  psychiatric
inpatient care (Cotgrove 1995). The aim is to reduce the risk of SH
by facilitating rapid access to care.

Pharmacological interventions

Antidepressants

Antidepressants  might  be  expected  to  have  general  benefits
on  mood  in  young  people  with  depression  and,  hence,  reduce
thoughts and acts of SH. Commonly used antidepressants include
tricyclics and newer generation antidepressants (such as selective
serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)).  Tricyclic  antidepressants
primarily  inhibit  both  serotonin  and  norepinephrine  reuptake,
whereas  SSRIs  specifically  target  synaptic  serotonergic  reuptake
(Feighner  1999).  Given  the  link  between  serotonin  activity,
impulsivity,  and  suicidal  behaviour  (van  Heeringen  2014),  both
tricyclic  and  SSRI  antidepressants  might  be  expected  to  be
associated  with  a  serotonin-mediated  reduction  in  impulsivity
which could reduce the likelihood that an individual will engage in
SH. However, there have been significant concerns that SSRIs (apart
from fluoxetine) may increase suicidality in young people, resulting
in warnings from regulatory agencies in both the UK (Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; MHRA 2003) and the USA
(Food and Drug Administration 2004). Guidance from the National
Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests that only fluoxetine

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

has  been  shown  to  be  of  benefit  for  depression  in  children  and
young people (NICE 2005). Recent studies, however, indicate that
warnings  from  regulatory  agencies  may  have  had  unintended
consequences, such as increases in suicide attempts among young
people (Lu 2014).

Antipsychotics

One  risk  factor  for  SH,  including  repetition  of  the  behaviour,
may  be  heightened  arousal,  especially  in  relation  to  stressful  life
events.  The  rationale  for  the  use  of  antipsychotics  is  that  by
reducing  this  arousal,  the  urge  to  engage  in  SH  may  also  be
reduced.  Case  series  data  suggest  some  benefit  for  low  potency
second generation antipsychotics (such as quetiapine) in reducing
suicidality  in  adolescents  diagnosed  with  major  depression  (e.g.,
Good 2006).

Mood stabilisers (including antiepileptics)

Mood  stabilisers  may  have  specific  benefits  for  children  and
adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder or unipolar disorder,
especially in terms of preventing recurrence of episodes of mood
disorder. It might therefore be anticipated that these drugs would
offer  benefits  in  terms  of  reducing  the  risk  of  suicidal  behaviour.
To date, however, such an effect has only been found for lithium in
adults (Cipriani 2013). Lithium may also reduce the risk of suicidal
behaviour  via  a  serotonin-mediated  reduction  in  impulsivity  and
aggression. It is also possible that the long-term clinical monitoring
that  all  patients  prescribed  lithium  treatment  must  undergo
contributes to a reduction in SH (Cipriani 2013).

Other pharmacological agents

Benzodiazepines  and  other  anxiolytics  might  be  expected  to
reduce suicidal behaviour through their specific effects on anxiety
(Tyrer  2012).  However,  because  of  their  GABAminergic  effects,
benzodiazepines  may  also  increase  aggression  and  disinhibition
(Albrecht 2014). In adolescents, furthermore, case series data also
describe an increased risk of suicidality and SH in those prescribed
benzodiazepines  (e.g.,  Kandemir  2008).  Other  pharmacological
agents,  such  as  the  N-Methyl-D-aspartate  receptor  antagonist
ketamine, may also have beneficial effects in patients with major
depression. However, it is presently unclear whether ketamine has
a specific antisuicidal effect, or rather whether its effectiveness is
due to a reduction in depressive symptomatology more generally
(Fond 2014).

Natural products

In  adults,  the  main  focus  with  regard  to  natural  products  and
suicidal  behaviour  has  been  on  dietary  supplementation  of
omega-3 fatty acids (fish oils; Tanskanen 2001). Omega-3 fatty acids
have  been  implicated  in  the  neural  network  shown  to  correlate
with the lethality of recent suicidal behaviour (Mann 2013). Blood
plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid levels have also been implicated
in  the  serotonin-mediated  link  between  low  cholesterol  and
suicidal  behaviour,  suggesting  that  low  omega-3  fatty  acid  levels
may have a negative impact on serotonin function (Sublette 2006).
For  those  in  whom  SH  is  impulsive,  omega-3  supplementation
may stimulate serotonin activity, thereby reducing the likelihood of
engaging in SH (Brunner 2002).

Why it is important to do this review

M E T H O D S

SH  in  adolescents  is  a  major  social  and  healthcare  problem.  It
represents significant morbidity, is often repeated, and has strong
links to suicide. It also leads to substantial healthcare costs (Sinclair
2011).  Many  countries  now  have  suicide  prevention  strategies
(World Health Organization 2014); all include a focus on improved
management  of  patients  presenting  with  SH  because  of  their
greatly  elevated  suicide  risk  and  high  levels  of  psychopathology
and distress. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England
(Her  Majesty's  Government  Department  of  Health  2012)  and  the
national  suicide  prevention  strategy  for  the  USA  (Office  of  the
Surgeon  General  (US)  2012),  for  example,  highlight  adolescent
SH  patients  as  a  key  high  risk  group  for  special  attention.  In
recent years there has been considerable focus on improving the
standards  of  general  hospital  care  for  SH  patients.  In  2014  in  the
UK,  the  Royal  College  of  Psychiatrists  published  a  guideline  on
services  (including  assessment  and  treatment)  for  young  people
who  engage  in  SH  (Royal  College  of  Psychiatrists  2014).  In  2004,
NICE  produced  a  guideline  on  SH  which  focused  on  its  short-
term physical and psychological management (NCCMH 2004). More
recently  it  produced  a  second  guideline  focused  particularly  on
longer-term  management  (NICE  2011),  using  some  interim  data
from  the  present  review  as  the  evidence  base  on  therapeutic
interventions.  A  similar  guideline  was  produced  in  Australia  and
New  Zealand  (Boyce  2003).  We  had  previously  conducted  a
systematic review of treatment interventions for SH patients of all
ages in terms of reducing repetition of SH which had highlighted
the paucity of evidence for effective treatments, at least in terms of
this outcome (Hawton 1998; Hawton 1999). The first NICE guideline
essentially reinforced this conclusion (NCCMH 2004). Using interim
data from the present review, the second NICE guideline concluded
that  there  was  no  evidence  showing  that  specific  treatments  for
adolescent  patients  were  more  effective  than  routine  care  (NICE
2011).

We have now fully updated our original review in order to provide
contemporary  evidence  to  guide  clinical  policy  and  practice.
Because of the increasing number treatment types and the need
for  a  special  focus  on  adolescents  who  engage  in  SH,  we  have
divided the original review into three reviews: the present review
which  focuses  on  interventions  for  children  and  adolescents,  a
second review on pharmacological interventions in adults, and a
third review on psychosocial interventions for adults. In the earlier
review  we  focused  on  repetition  of  SH  and  suicide  as  the  main
outcomes.  In  this  update  we  have  now  also  included  data  on
treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation,
and problem-solving.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We  included  RCTs,  including  cluster  randomised  and  cross-over
trials,  of  specific  psychosocial  or  pharmacological  treatments
versus treatment as usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual
care,  placebo,  or  any  other  pharmacological  comparison  in  the
treatment of child and adolescent SH patients.

Types of participants

Participant characteristics

Participants  were  males  and  females  up  to  18  years  of  age  of  all
ethnicities. We also included trials where there was a small minority
(<15%) of adult participants, providing these participants had been
referred to child and adolescent mental health services. However,
we undertook sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of inclusion
of such trials.

Diagnosis

Participants who had engaged in any type of non-fatal intentional
self-poisoning  or  self-injury  resulting  in  presentation  to  child
and  adolescent  mental  health  services  in  the  six  months  prior
to  trial  entry  were  included.  There  were  no  restrictions  on  the
frequency  with  which  patients  engaged  in  SH;  thus,  for  example,
we included studies where participants had frequently repeated SH
(for example, those with SH behaviour associated with emergent
borderline personality disorder).

We  defined  SH  as  any  intentional  act  of  self-poisoning  or  self-
injury,  irrespective  of  degree  of  suicidal  intent  or  other  types
of  motivation.  Thus  it  includes  acts  intended  to  result  in  death
(‘attempted suicide’), those without suicidal intent (for example, to
communicate distress or temporarily reduce unpleasant feelings),
and  those  with  mixed  motivation.  Self-poisoning  includes  both
overdoses  of  medicinal  drugs  and  ingestion  of  substances  not
intended for consumption (such as pesticides). Self-injury includes
acts such as self-cutting, self-mutilation, attempted hanging, and
jumping in front of moving vehicles. We only included trials where
participants presented to clinical services as a result of SH.

Co-morbidities

There were no restrictions in terms of whether or not patients had
psychiatric  disorders,  or  the  nature  of  those  disorders,  with  the
exception of intellectual disability (where any SH behaviour, such
as  head-banging,  is  likely  to  be  repetitive,  as  the  purpose  of  this
behaviour is usually different from that involved in SH; NICE 2004).

Setting

Interventions  delivered  in  inpatient  or  outpatient  settings  were
eligible for inclusion, as were trials from any country.

Subset data

We  did  not  include  trials  in  which  only  some  participants  had
engaged  in  SH  or  studies  of  people  with  psychiatric  disorders
in  which  SH  was  an  outcome  variable  but  was  not  an  inclusion
criterion for entry into the trial.

Types of interventions

Categorisation  of  the  interventions  included  in  this  review  was
informed  by  the  trials  themselves  and  was  based  on  consensus
discussions  among  the  review  team  who  have  considerable
experience in both research and clinical practice related to SH.

Psychosocial interventions

Experimental interventions

This could include:

1.
2.

individual CBT-based psychotherapy;
interventions  for  patients  with  multiple  episodes  of  SH  or
emerging personality problems;

3. group-based psychotherapy;
4. enhanced assessment approaches;
5. compliance enhancement approaches;
6. home-based family interventions;
7. remote contact interventions.

Comparator interventions

As treatment as usual (TAU) is likely to vary widely between settings,
following previous work we defined TAU as routine clinical service
provision that the patient would receive had they not been included
in the study (i.e., routine care or 'standard disposition'; Hunt 2013).
Other routine management comparators could include no specific
treatment or enhanced usual care which refers to TAU that has in
some  way  been  supplemented,  such  as  through  the  provision  of
psychoeducation, assertive outreach or more regular contact with
case managers, and standard assessment approaches.

Pharmacological interventions

Experimental interventions

This could include:

1. tricyclic antidepressants (TADs; e.g., amitriptyline);
2. newer  generation  antidepressants  (NGAs)  such  as  SSRIs
(e.g., 
fluoxetine),  serotonin  and  noradrenaline  reuptake
inhibitors  (SNRIs;  e.g.,  venlafaxine),  norepinephrine  reuptake
inhibitors  (NRIs;  e.g.,  reboxetine),  tetracyclic  antidepressants
serotonergic
(e.g.,  maprotiline),  noradrenergic 
antidepressants

antagonist  or  reuptake  inhibitors  (SARIs;  e.g.,  trazodone),  or

such  as  sugar  pills  or  injections  with  saline,  although  in  some
trials  another  comparator  pharmacological  intervention  (such  as
another  standard  pharmacological  agent  or  reduced  dose  of  the
intervention agent) may be used.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

The primary outcome measure in this review was the occurrence of
repeated SH (defined above) over a maximum follow-up period of
two years. Repetition was identified through self-report, collateral
report,  clinical  records,  or  research  monitoring  systems.  As  we
wished to incorporate the maximal amount of data from each trial,
we included both self-reported and hospital records of SH where
available. We report both proportions of participants repeating SH
and frequency of repeat episodes.

Secondary outcomes

1. Treatment adherence

This  was  assessed  using  a  range  of  measures  of  adherence,
including  pill  counts,  changes  in  blood  measures,  and  the
proportion  of  participants  that  both  started  and  completed
treatment.

2. Depression

This was assessed either continuously, as scores on psychometric
measures  of  depression  symptoms  (for  example  total  scores  on
the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI;  Beck  1961)  or  scores  on  the
depression sub-scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS;  Zigmond  1983)),  or  dichotomously  as  the  proportion  of
patients reaching defined diagnostic criteria for depression.

3. Hopelessness

This  was  assessed  as  scores  on  psychometric  measures  of
hopelessness, for example, total scores on the Beck Hopelessness
Scale (BHS; Beck 1974).

4. Suicidal ideation

This was assessed either continuously, as scores on psychometric
measures of suicidal ideation (for example, total scores on the Beck
Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS; Beck 1988)), or dichotomously, as
the proportion of patients reaching a defined cut-off for ideation.

5. Problem-solving

This was assessed either continuously, as scores on a psychometric
measure of problem-solving ability (for example total scores on the
Problem Solving Inventory (PSI; Heppner 1988)), or dichotomously,
as the proportion of patients with improved problems.

Timing of outcome assessment

We have reported outcomes for the following time periods.

1. At the conclusion of the treatment period.
2. Between  zero  and  six  months  after  the  conclusion  of  the

treatment period.

Comparator interventions

In  pharmacological  trials,  where  a  comparison  with  the  specific
effects of a drug is being made, the comparator is typically placebo,
which  consists  of  any  pharmacologically  inactive  treatment

4. Between 12 and 24 months after the conclusion of the treatment

Where there was more than one outcome assessment within a time
period,  we  only  used  data  from  the  last  assessment  in  the  time
period, unless different outcomes were assessed at different points.
For  treatment  adherence,  we  also  used  within-treatment  period
results.

Hierarchy of outcome measures

Where  a  trial  measured  the  same  outcome  (for  example,
depression)  in  two  or  more  ways,  we  used  the  most  common
measure  across  trials  in  any  meta-analysis,  but  we  also  reported
scores from the other measure in the text of the review.

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's
Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)

The  Cochrane  Depression,  Anxiety  and  Neurosis  Group  (CCDAN)
maintains  two  clinical  trials  registers  at  their  editorial  base  in
Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The
CCDANCTR-References  contains  over  37,500  reports  of  RCTs  on
depression,  anxiety,  and  neurosis.  Approximately  60%  of  these
references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded
trials  are  held  in  the  CCDANCTR-Studies  and  records  are  linked
between  the  two  registers  through  the  use  of  unique  study  ID
tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please
contact the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details.

Reports of trials for inclusion in the group's registers are collated
from weekly generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE
(1974  to  date),  and  PsycINFO  (1967  to  date),  as  well  as  quarterly
searches  of  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials
(CENTRAL).

2.

Hand searching

For the original version of this review, the authors hand searched
ten  specialist  journals  within  the  fields  of  psychology  and
psychiatry, including all English language suicidology journals as
outlined in Appendix 3. As these journals are now indexed in major
electronic  databases,  we  did  not  repeat  hand  searching  for  this
update of the review.

Reference lists

The reference lists of all relevant papers known to the investigators
were  checked,  as  were  the  reference  lists  of  major  reviews
which  included  a  focus  on  interventions  for  SH  in  children  and
adolescents  (Brausch  2012;  Brent  2013;  Burns  2000;  Daniel  2009;
Gould 2003; Hawton 2012a; Newton 2010; Nock 2007; Ougrin 2011b;
Ougrin 2015; Robinson 2011).

Correspondence

We consulted the authors of trials and other experts in the field of
suicidal  behaviour  to  find  out  if  they  were  aware  of  any  ongoing
or  unpublished  RCTs  concerning  the  treatment  of  adolescent  SH
patients.

Data collection and analysis

For details of the data collection and analysis methods used in the
original version of this review see Appendix 4.

Selection of studies

For this update of the review, all authors independently assessed
the titles of trials identified by the systematic search for eligibility.
We made a distinction between:

1. eligible 

any 

trials, 

in  which 

psychosocial 

or
psychopharmacological treatment was compared with a control
(treatment as usual, standard or less intensive types of aftercare,
placebo medication, or comparator drug/dose);
ineligible  general  treatment  trials 
treatment).

(without  any  control

The  CCDANCTR  (Studies  and  References)  was  searched  on  30
January 2015 using terms for self-harm (condition only), as outlined
in  Appendix  1.  No  restrictions  on  date,  language,  or  publication
status were applied to the search.

All  trials  identified  as  potentially  eligible  for  inclusion  then
underwent  a  second  screening.  Pairs  of  review  authors,  working
independently from one another, screened the full text of relevant
trials to identify whether the trial met our inclusion criteria.

Additional electronic database searches

Complementary  searches  of  MEDLINE  (1998  to  2013),  EMBASE
(1998  to  2013),  PsycINFO  (1998  to  2013),  and  CENTRAL  (The
Cochrane  Library,  Issue  10,  2013)  were  conducted  by  Sarah
Stockton, librarian at the University of Oxford, following the search
strategy  outlined  in  Appendix  2.  Additionally,  KW  searched  the
Australian Suicide Prevention RCT Database (Christensen 2014). KW
also  conducted  electronic  searches  of  ClinicalTrials.gov  and  the
ISRCTN registry using the keywords random* AND suicide attempt*
OR self$harm* to identify relevant ongoing trials.

Both the original version of this review and an unpublished version
also incorporated searches of the following databases: SIGLE (1980
to March 2005) and Sociofile (1963 to July 2006).

Disagreements  were  resolved  following  consultation  with  KH.
Where disagreements could not be resolved from the information
reported  within  the  trial,  or  where  it  was  unclear  whether  the
trial satisfied our inclusion criteria, we contacted study authors to
provide additional clarification.

and  information  on  the  outcome  measures  used  to  evaluate  the
efficacy  of  the  intervention.  Study  authors  were  contacted  to
provide raw data for outcomes that were not reported in the full text
of included trials.

Both  dichotomous  and  continuous  outcome  data  were  extracted
from eligible trials. As the use of non-validated psychometric scales
is  associated  with  bias,  we  extracted  continuous  data  only  if  the
psychometric scale used to measure the outcome of interest had
been  previously  published  in  a  peer-reviewed  journal  (Marshall
2000), and was not subjected to item, scoring, or other modification
by the trial authors.

We planned the following main comparisons.

1. Individual CBT-based psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, PST) versus TAU

or other routine management.

2. Interventions  for  patients  with  multiple  episodes  of  SH  or
emerging  personality  problems  versus  TAU  or  other  routine
management.

Each  source  of  potential  bias  was  judged  as  contributing  to  at
"low," "high," or "unclear" risk of each potential bias independently
by two reviewers. Where inadequate details of the randomisation,
blinding,  or  outcome  assessment  procedures  were  provided  in
the original report, we contacted authors to provide clarification.
Disagreements were resolved following discussion with KH. Risk of
bias for each included trial is reported in the text of the review, as
well as in the 'Risk of bias' tables, along with supporting quotations
from the trial report to justify each judgment.

Measures of treatment effect

Dichotomous outcomes

We  summarised  dichotomous  outcomes,  such  as  the  number  of
participants engaging in a repeat SH episode and deaths by suicide,
using  the  summary  odds  ratios  (OR)  and  the  accompanying  95%
confidence interval (CI), as the OR is the most appropriate effect size
statistic for summarising associations between two dichotomous
groups (Fleiss 1994).

4. Enhanced assessment approaches versus TAU or other routine

5. Compliance  enhancement  approaches  versus  TAU  or  other

6. Home-based  family  interventions  versus  TAU  or  other  routine

management.

7. Remote  contact  interventions  versus  TAU  or  other  routine

8. Tricyclic  antidepressants  versus  placebo  or  other  comparator

9. Newer  generation  antidepressants  versus  placebo  or  other

10.Any other antidepressants versus placebo or other comparator

11.Antipsychotics versus placebo or other comparator drug/dose.
12.Mood stabilisers versus placebo or other comparator drug/dose.
13.Other  pharmacological  agents  versus  placebo  or  other

comparator drug/dose.

14.Natural  products  versus  placebo  or  other  comparator  drug/

dose.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Given  that  highly  biased  studies  are  more  likely  to  overestimate
treatment  effectiveness  (Moher  1998),  the  quality  of  included
studies was evaluated independently by KW and one of either TTS,
EA, DG, PH, ET, or KvH using the criteria described in Higgins 2011.
This tool encourages consideration of the following domains.

1. Random sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Blinding of participants and personnel.
4. Blinding of outcome assessment.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Selective outcome reporting.
7. Other bias.

For  outcomes  measured  on  a  continuous  scale,  we  used  mean
differences  (MD)  and  accompanying  95%  CI  where  the  same
outcome  measure  was  employed.  Where  different  outcome
measures  were  employed,  we  used  the  standardised  mean
difference (SMD) and its accompanying 95% CI.

Trials  were  aggregated  for  the  purposes  of  meta-analysis  only  if
treatments  were  sufficiently  similar.  For  trials  that  could  not  be
included  in  a  meta-analysis,  we  have  instead  provided  narrative
descriptions of the results.

Unit of analysis issues

Zelen design trials

Trials  in  this  area  are  increasingly  employing  Zelen's  method
in  which  consent  is  obtained  subsequent  to  randomisation
and  treatment  allocation.  This  design  may  lead  to  bias  if,  for
example,  participants  allocated  to  one  particular  arm  of  the  trial
disproportionally  refuse  to  provide  consent  for  participation  or,
alternatively,  if  participants  only  provide  consent  provided  they
are allowed to cross-over to the active treatment arm (Torgerson
2004).  No  trial  included  in  this  review  used  Zelen's  design.  Given
the uncertainty of whether to use data based on those randomised
or  those  consenting  to  participation,  should  a  trial  using  Zelen's
method  be  identified  in  future  updates  of  this  review  we  plan  to
extract  data  using  both  sources  where  possible.  We  also  plan  to
conduct  sensitivity  analyses  to  investigate  what  impact,  if  any,
the  inclusion  of  these  trials  may  have  on  the  pooled  estimate  of
treatment effect.

Cluster randomised trials

Cluster randomisation, for example by clinician or practice, can lead
to overestimation of the significance of a treatment effect, resulting
in an inflation of the nominal type I error rate, unless appropriate
adjustment is made for the effects of clustering (Donner 2002; Kerry
1998).  One  trial  included  in  the  review  used  clustering  (Ougrin
2011a).  As  the  study  authors  were  unable  to  provide  us  with
the values of either the inter-cluster correlation coefficient or the
design effect to enable us to statistically account for the effects of
clustering  (as  per  the  guidance  in  Higgins  2011),  for  this  trial  we

have  used  unadjusted  data,  but  have  commented  on  the  impact
this may have had on the results observed in the text of the review.

In  future  updates  of  this  review,  should  we  be  able  to  obtain
information  on  either  the  inter-cluster  correlation  coefficient  or
the design effect, we will use the formula given in Higgins 2011 to
account for the effects of clustering.

Cross-over trials

A primary concern with cross-over trials is the "carry-over" effect
in which the effect of the intervention treatment (pharmacological,
physiological,  or  psychological) 
influences  the  participant's
response to the subsequent control condition (Elbourne 2002). As a
consequence, on entry to the second phase of the trial, participants
may differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out
phase. This, in turn, may result in a concomitant underestimation
of  the  effectiveness  of  the  treatment  intervention  (Curtin  2002a;
Curtin 2002b). No trials in the current review included cross-over
methodology. However, should we identify any such trials in future
updates, only data from the first phase of the study, prior to cross-
over, will be included to protect against the carry-over effect.

Studies with multiple treatment groups

No trials in the current review included multiple treatment groups.
In future updates, however, should trials with multiple treatment
groups be identified, all relevant treatment arms will be included
in the review. For binary data we will combine data or use the data
from the comparison arm in two or more analyses as appropriate.
For continuous data, we will combine data following the formula
given in Higgins 2011, section 7.7.3.8.

Studies with adjusted effect sizes

None of the trials included in the current update provided adjusted
effect  sizes.  In  future  updates,  however,  where  trials  reported
both  unadjusted  and  adjusted  effect  sizes,  we  will  include  only
unadjusted effect sizes.

Dealing with missing data

We  did  not  impute  missing  data  as  we  considered  that  the  bias
that  would  be  introduced  by  doing  this  would  have  outweighed
any benefit (in terms of increased statistical power) that may have
been  gained  by  the  inclusion  of  imputed  data.  However,  where
authors omitted standard deviations (SD) for continuous measures,
we  planned  to  estimate  these  using  the  method  described  in
Townsend 2001.

Dichotomous data

Although  some  authors  said  they  conducted  intention-to-treat
analyses,  few  presented  such  analyses  as  defined  by  Higgins
2011.  Therefore,  outcome  analyses  for  both  dichotomous  and
continuous data were based on all information available on study
participants.  For  dichotomous  outcomes,  we  included  data  on
only  those  participants  whose  results  were  known,  using  as  the
denominator  the  total  number  of  participants  with  data  for  the
particular outcome of interest, as recommended (Higgins 2011).

Continuous data

For continuous outcomes, we have included data only on observed
cases.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Missing data

Where  data  on  outcomes  of  interest  were  incomplete  or  were
excluded from the text of the trial, we contacted study authors in
order to try to obtain further information.

Assessment of heterogeneity

Between-study heterogeneity can be assessed using either the Chi2
or I2 statistics. In this review, however, we used only the I2 statistic
to determine heterogeneity as this is considered to be more reliable
(Higgins 2011). The I2 statistic indicates the percentage of between-
study  variation  due  to  chance  (Higgins  2011),  and  can  take  any
value  from  0%  to  100%.  We  used  the  following  values  to  denote
relative  importance  of  heterogeneity:  0%  to  40%  (unimportant),
30% to 60% (moderate), 50% to 90% (substantial), and 75% to 100%
(considerable),  as  per  the  guidance  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  (
Higgins 2011). Where we found substantial levels of heterogeneity
(i.e.,  ≥  75%),  we  explored  reasons  for  this  heterogeneity.  We  also
planned  to  investigate  heterogeneity  when  the  I2  statistic  was
lower than 75% where either the direction or magnitude of a trial
effect size was clearly discrepant from that of other trials included
in  the  meta-analysis  (see  Subgroup  analysis  and  investigation  of
heterogeneity for further information on these analyses).

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting bias occurs when the decision to publish a particular trial
is influenced by the direction and significance of its results (Egger
1997). Research suggests, for example, that trials with statistically
significant findings are more likely to be submitted for publication
and to subsequently be accepted for publication (Hopewell 2009),
leading to possible overestimation of the true treatment effect. To
assess whether trials included in any meta-analysis were affected
by  reporting  bias,  we  planned  to  enter  data  into  a  funnel  plot
when a meta-analysis included results of at least ten trials. Should
evidence  of  any  small  study  effects  be  identified,  we  planned  to
explore reasons for funnel plot asymmetry, including the presence
of publication bias (Egger 1997).

Data synthesis

For  the  purposes  of  meta-analysis,  we  calculated  the  pooled  OR
and accompanying 95% CI using the random-effects model as this
is  the  most  appropriate  model  for  incorporating  heterogeneity
between studies (Higgins 2011). Specifically, for dichotomous data,
the Mantel-Haenszel method was used, whilst the inverted variance
method  was  used  for  continuous  data.  However,  a  fixed-effect
analysis was also undertaken to investigate the potential effect of
method choice on the estimates of treatment effect. Any material
differences  in  ORs  between  these  two  methods  are  reported
descriptively in the text of the review. All analyses were undertaken
in RevMan, version 5.3 (RevMan 2014).

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Subgroup analyses

In  the  original  version  of  this  review,  we  planned  to  undertake
subgroup analyses by repeater status and gender but found there
were  insufficient  data.  Consequently,  in  this  update  we  only
undertook a priori subgroup analyses by gender or repeater status
where there were sufficient data to do so.

Better health.

Given the increasing use of enhanced usual care rather than TAU in
trials in this area, we also planned to undertake sub-group analyses
to determine whether comparator choice influenced the pattern of
results observed.

Investigation of heterogeneity

We  planned  that  should  any  meta-analysis  be  associated  with
substantial levels of between-study heterogeneity (i.e., I2 ≥ 75%),
KH and KW would independently triple-check data to ensure these
had  been  correctly  entered.  Assuming  data  had  been  entered
correctly, we would investigate the source of this heterogeneity by
visually  inspecting  the  forest  plot  and  removing  each  trial  which
has a very different result to the general pattern of the others until
homogeneity was restored as indicted by an I2 statistic < 75%. We
planned to report the results of this sensitivity analysis in the text of
the review alongside hypotheses regarding the likely causes of the
heterogeneity.

Sensitivity analysis

We planned to undertake sensitivity analyses, where appropriate,
as outlined below.

1. Where a trial made use of Zelen's method of randomisation (see

Unit of analysis issues section).

2. Where  a  trial  contributed  to  substantial  between-study
heterogeneity  (see  Subgroup  analysis  and  investigation  of
heterogeneity section).

3. Where a trial included a mixture of both adolescent and adult

participants.

'Summary of findings' table

A  'Summary  of  findings'  table  was  prepared  for  the  primary
outcome  measure,  repetition  of  SH,  following  recommendations

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

outlined  in  Schünemann  2008a,  section  11.5.  This  table  provides
information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each
included  trial.  The  'Summary  of  findings'  table  was  prepared
using GRADEpro software (GRADEpro). Quality of the evidence was
assessed following recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook
(Higgins 2011).

Description of studies

Results of the search

For  this  update,  a  total  of  23,763  citations  were  found  using  the
search strategies outlined in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. A further
10 trials were identified through correspondence with researchers
in the field; these trials were ongoing at the time of the systematic
search. All but one have subsequently been published and a report
on the remaining trial is currently in preparation. We were able to
include data for this unpublished trial, however, by correspondence
with  and  permission  from  study  authors.  In  consultation  with
CCDAN,  we  have  divided  the  original  review  into  three  separate
reviews:  the  present  review  which  focuses  on  psychosocial  or
pharmacological  interventions  for  children  and  adolescents,  a
second  review  on  psychosocial  interventions  for  adults,  and  the
third  on  pharmacological  interventions  for  adults.  All  but  one  of
the  10  additional  trials  identified  through  correspondence  with
study authors have evaluated psychosocial interventions in adults
and  these  have  therefore  been  included  in  the  corresponding
review.  The  remaining  trial  is  one  of  a  psychosocial  intervention
for children and adolescents (Cooney 2010) and has therefore been
included in the present review.

After deduplication, the overall figure for citations was reduced to
16,736.  Of  these,  16,491  were  excluded  after  screening,  whilst  a
further 221 were excluded after reviewing the full texts (Figure 1).

Included studies

In  the  previous  versions  of  this  review  (Hawton  1998;  Hawton
1999;  NICE  2011),  six  trials  of  psychosocial  interventions  for
adolescent SH patients were included (Cotgrove 1995; Donaldson
2005; Harrington 1998; Hazell 2009; Spirito 2002; Wood 2001a). The
present update includes information from an additional five trials

(Cooney 2010; Green 2011; Mehlum 2014; Ougrin 2011a; Rossouw
2012a). The present review therefore includes 11 non-overlapping
trials. A further report (Ougrin 2013) provided two-year follow-up
data for one of the previously-included trials (Ougrin 2011a).

11 included trials (Cooney 2010; Cotgrove 1995; Donaldson 2005;
Green  2011;  Ougrin  2011a;  Rossouw  2012a;  Spirito  2002;  Wood
2001a).

Five  ongoing  trials  of  interventions  for  SH  in  children  and
adolescents  were  also  identified  (see  Characteristics  of  ongoing
studies for further information on these trials).

Design

Of the 11 trials, all were described as randomised controlled trials.
Most (k = 10) employed a simple randomisation procedure based on
individual allocation to the intervention and control groups. In one
trial, clinicians rather than participants were randomised (Ougrin
2011a).

Participants

The included trials comprised a total of 1,126 child and adolescent
participants. All had engaged in at least one episode of SH in the six
months prior to randomisation.

Participant characteristics

Of  the  nine  trials  in  which  information  on  age  was  provided,  the
average  age  of  participants  at  randomisation  was  15.3  years  (SD
0.5).  All  participants  had  been  referred  to  child  and  adolescent
mental health services. Of the 10 trials that recorded information on
gender, the majority of participants were female (80.6%), reflecting
the  typical  pattern  for  SH  in  children  and  adolescents  (Hawton
2008a).

Diagnosis

A history of SH prior to the index episode (i.e., multiple episodes
of  SH)  was  a  requirement  for  participation  in  five  trials  (Cooney
2010; Green 2011; Hazell 2009; Mehlum 2014; Wood 2001a). In one
trial,  over  half  of  the  sample  (58.6%)  had  a  history  of  multiple
episodes of SH (Ougrin 2011a), whilst in a further trial just under
half  of  the  sample  (48.4%)  had  a  history  of  multiple  episodes
(Donaldson 2005). For four trials, information on the proportion of
participants with a history of SH prior to the index episode was not
reported (Cotgrove 1995; Harrington 1998; Rossouw 2012a; Spirito
2002).  Two  trials  included  participants  who  had  made  a  "suicide
attempt"  (i.e.,  with  evidence  of  suicidal  intent)  (Donaldson  2005;
Spirito  2002);  however,  most  trials  (k  =  7)  included  adolescents
irrespective of intent (Cooney 2010; Harrington 1998; Hazell 2009;
Mehlum  2014;  Ougrin  2011a;  Rossouw  2012a;  Wood  2001a).  In
the  two  remaining  trials,  information  on  intent  was  not  reported
(Cotgrove 1995; Green 2011).

Information  on  the  method  of  SH  for  the  index  episode  was
not  reported  in  two  trials  (Cooney  2010;  Mehlum  2014).  In  three
trials, information on methods used in all lifetime episodes of SH
(including the index episode) was reported (Hazell 2009; Rossouw
2012a;  Wood  2001a).  In  the  latter  two  trials,  64.0%  and  94.4%
respectively had a history of self-poisoning whilst 95.5% and 74.6%
respectively had a history of self-injury. In Hazell 2009, 97.0% had
a  history  of  self-cutting,  71.0%  of  head  banging,  57.0%  of  self-
poisoning with prescription medication, 36.0% of self-smothering,
25.0%  of  self-strangulation,  19.0%  of  other  forms  of  self-injury,
19.0% of self-drowning, 17.0% of jumping from a height, and 35.0%
some other form of SH. Information on methods used for the index
episode only for the remaining six trials is presented in Table 1. In

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

these trials, the majority of participants (k = 6; 67.1%) had engaged
in self-poisoning.

Co-morbidities

Information  on  current  psychiatric  diagnoses  was  reported  in  10
trials  (see  Table  2).  In  these  trials,  the  most  common  psychiatric
diagnoses  were  major  depression  (k  =  8;  mean  65.2%)  and
behavioural  disorders  (k  =  4;  mean  35.8%).  One  trial  included  a
high  proportion  of  adolescents  diagnosed  as  having  features  of
emerging borderline personality disorder (72.5%; Rossouw 2012a).

Details  on  comorbid  diagnoses  were  not  reported  in  eight  of  the
11 trials (Cotgrove 1995; Green 2011; Harrington 1998; Hazell 2009;
Mehlum 2014; Ougrin 2011a; Rossouw 2012a; Wood 2001a). In the
remaining  three  trials,  between  7.3%  (Spirito  2002)  and  93.1%
(Cooney  2010)  of  participants  were  diagnosed  with  two  or  more
psychiatric  disorders.  However,  further  information  on  specific
diagnoses was not provided.

Setting

Of the 11 non-overlapping RCTs included in this review, five were
from the UK (Cotgrove 1995; Green 2011; Ougrin 2011a; Rossouw
2012a;  Wood  2001a),  three  were  from  the  US  (Donaldson  2005;
Harrington 1998; Spirito 2002), and one was from each of Australia
(Hazell 2009), New Zealand (Cooney 2010), and Norway (Mehlum
2014). Although all participants were identified following a clinical
presentation  for  SH,  treatment  was  delivered  on  an  outpatient
basis  or  in  the  patient's  home  in  nine  trials.  In  the  remaining
trials  of  brief  (one  hour)  compliance  enhancement  (Spirito  2002)
and therapeutic assessment (Ougrin 2011a), the intervention was
delivered whilst the adolescent was receiving treatment in hospital.

Interventions

All 11 trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of
various forms of psychosocial therapy.

1. Individual  CBT-based  psychotherapy  versus  TAU  (Donaldson

2005).

2. Interventions  for  patients  with  multiple  episodes  of  SH  or
emerging  personality  problems  versus  TAU  or  other  routine
management (i.e., enhanced usual care) (Cooney 2010; Mehlum
2014; Rossouw 2012a).

3. Group-based  psychotherapy  versus  TAU  (Green  2011;  Hazell

2009; Wood 2001a).

4. Therapeutic assessment versus TAU (i.e., standard assessment)

(Ougrin 2011a).

5. Compliance  enhancement  plus  standard  disposition  planning

versus TAU (i.e., standard disposition) (Spirito 2002).

6. Home-based family intervention versus TAU (Harrington 1998).
7. Remote  contact  interventions  plus  TAU  versus  TAU  (Cotgrove

1995).

There  were  no  trials  in  which  pharmacological  treatments  were
investigated.

Outcomes

All  11  trials  reported  information  on  the  primary  outcome:
repetition  of  SH.  In  the  majority  of  these  trials  (k  =  8),  this
was based on self-reported information (Cooney 2010; Donaldson
2005; Harrington 1998; Hazell 2009; Mehlum 2014; Rossouw 2012a;

Spirito 2002; Wood 2001a), whilst in one further trial, self-reported
information  was  combined  with  information  from  a  collateral
informant such as a parent (Green 2011). In one trial, information
on  repetition  of  SH  was  obtained  from  clinical  or  hospital  notes
supplemented  by  information  from  general  practitioners,  social
workers,  and  psychologists  (where  relevant)  (Cotgrove  1995).  In
only  one  trial,  information  on  repetition  of  SH  was  based  solely
on representation to accident and emergency departments (Ougrin
2011a).

In  the  seven  trials  that  recorded  information  on  treatment
adherence, this was assessed using a variety of methods including:
the  proportion  of  participants  that  completed  the  full  course  of
treatment (Donaldson 2005; Harrington 1998; Rossouw 2012a), the
proportion  attending  their  first  appointment  (Ougrin  2011a),  the
proportion attending at least one treatment session (Spirito 2002),
and the total number of treatment sessions attended (Cooney 2010;
Mehlum  2014;  Spirito  2002).  Depression  was  assessed  using  the
Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ; Angold 1995) in five trials
(Green  2011;  Hazell  2009;  Mehlum  2014;  Rossouw  2012a;  Wood
2001a), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS;
Montgomery 1979) in one trial (Mehlum 2014), and the Center for
Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale  (CES-D;  Radloff  1991)  in
one trial (Donaldson 2005). Hopelessness was assessed using the
Hopelessness Scale (HS; Kazdin 1986) in one trial (Harrington 1998),
the BHS in a second trial (Mehlum 2014), and by the future optimism
sub-scale  score  on  the  Reasons  for  Living  Inventory-Adolescent
(RFL-A;  Osman  1998),  which  was  reverse  coded  in  the  present
review  to  indicate  a  perceived  lack  of  optimism  about  the  future
(Cooney  2010).  In  six  trials,  information  on  suicidal  ideation  was
assessed using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ; Reynolds
1985;  Reynolds  1988;  Reynolds  1999)  whilst  in  a  further  trial
(Cooney 2010) suicidal ideation was assessed using the Beck Scale
for  Suicide  Ideation  (Beck  1991).  For  the  two  trials  that  reported
information on problem-solving, this was assessed using the Social
Problem-Solving  Inventory  (SPSI;  Maydeu-Olivares  1996)  and  the
Means  Ends  Problem-Solving  test  (MEPS;  Platt  1971)  in  one  trial
(Donaldson  2005)  and  by  the  Generation  of  Alternative  Solutions
subscale  of  the  SPSI  in  a  second  (Harrington  1998).  Suicide  was
assessed  using  medical  or  health  service  records  (Green  2011;
Hazell 2009) or via interviews with parents (Donaldson 2005). In the
majority of trials (k = 6), however, it was unclear how suicide was

assessed (Harrington 1998; Mehlum 2014; Ougrin 2011a; Rossouw
2012a; Spirito 2002; Wood 2001a).

Excluded studies

A  total  of  221  articles  were  excluded  from  this  update:  94  were
excluded because not all patients engaged in SH, 63 used a non-
randomised clinical trial design, 28 were reviews, editorials, letters
to the editor, or conference proceedings that were not relevant to
the treatment of SH in children and adolescents, and 23 were trial
protocols. In addition, 11 were excluded as SH could have occurred
at  any  time  rather  than  within  six  months  of  randomisation,  and
one each were excluded either because only data from one trial arm
was  presented  (however,  a  related  publication  in  which  data  for
both the intervention and control arms were presented was eligible
for inclusion), or because the data reported in the article was for
a  period  beyond  two  years  (however,  articles  reporting  data  for
earlier follow-up periods for this trial were eligible for inclusion).

Details  on  the  reasons  for  exclusion  of  32  trials  clearly  related  to
interventions  for  suicidality  in  children  and  adolescents  can  be
found in the Characteristics of excluded studies section.

Ongoing studies

Five ongoing trials of psychosocial interventions for SH in children
and adolescents were identified. In these trials, the effectiveness
of the following treatments are being investigated: family therapy
(Asarnow  2014;  Cottrell  2014;  Diamond  2014),  a  crisis  card  in
conjunction with individualised psychotherapy (Fischer 2013), and
combined individual and group sessions of DBT-A (Linehan 2014).
Full details of these studies are provided in the Characteristics of
ongoing studies.

Studies awaiting classification

There  were  no  potentially  eligible  studies  which  have  not  been
incorporated into the review.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Sequence generation

Of  the  11  independent  trials  included  in  this  review,  all  used
random allocation. We rated the majority (k = 9; 81.8%) as having
a  low  risk  of  bias  for  this  item.  Four  used  a  random  numbers
table to allocate adolescents to the intervention and control groups
(Donaldson  2005;  Hazell  2009;  Spirito  2002;  Wood  2001a),  three
used permuted block randomisation (Mehlum 2014; Ougrin 2011a;
Rossouw 2012a), one used a minimisation algorithm (Green 2011),
and  one  used  a  computerised  randomisation  sequence  (Cooney
2010).  We  rated  one  trial  as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias  for
this  item  as  although  opaque,  sealed  envelopes  were  used,  it  is
unclear whether these were shuffled to ensure random sequence
generation (Harrington 1998). We rated one trial as having a high
risk  of  bias  for  this  item  as  an  open  numbers  table  was  used
(Cotgrove 1995).

Allocation concealment (selection bias)

We  rated  the  majority  of  trials  as  having  a  low  risk  of  bias  for
allocation concealment (k = 8; 72.7%). Allocation was by an offsite
researcher  in  four  trials  (Green  2011;  Hazell  2009;  Mehlum  2014;
Rossouw 2012a), by a third party researcher working independently
of the trial team in one trial (Ougrin 2011a), and by using opaque,
sealed  envelopes  in  two  further  trials  (Cooney  2010;  Harrington
1998). In one trial, "[t]reatment allocation was concealed from the
outcome assessors" (Wood 2001a, p.1247), although details of the
method used to conceal allocation were not provided. We rated two
trials  as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias  for  this  item  as  no  details
on allocation concealment were provided (Donaldson 2005; Spirito
2002), whilst we rated the remaining trial as having a high risk of
bias  for  this  item  as  an  open  numbers  table  was  used  (Cotgrove
1995).

Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)

We  assessed  blinding  separately 
personnel, and outcome assessors.

for  participants,  clinical

Blinding of participants

Overall, we classified blinding of participants as resulting in a high
risk  of  bias  for  the  majority  of  trials  included  in  this  review  (k
=  9;  81.8%),  as  psychosocial  interventions  predominated  and  we
contend  that  it  is  generally  not  possible  to  blind  participants  to
psychosocial  therapy.  We  rated  one  trial  as  having  a  low  risk  of
bias for this item as it was reported that participants were blind to
the treatment allocation; however, further details on the method of
achieving participant blinding were not reported (Rossouw 2012a).
We  rated  the  remaining  trial  as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias
for  this  item  as,  although  no  information  on  participant  blinding
was provided, both treatments were so similar it remains possible
that  participants  may  have  been  blind  to  treatment  allocation
(Donaldson 2005).

Blinding of personnel

Again, we classified blinding of clinical personnel as resulting in a
high  risk  of  bias  for  the  majority  of  trials  included  in  this  review
(k  =  10;  90.9%),  as  we  contend  that  it  is  not  possible  to  blind
clinicians to the psychosocial therapy they are delivering. We rated
one  trial,  however,  as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias  for  this  item
as, although no information on personnel blinding was reported,

the intervention consisted of a one-off emergency card which could
have been given to participants in private (Cotgrove 1995).

Blinding of outcome assessors

As outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation in eight
trials  (72.7%),  we  rated  this  item  as  having  a  low  risk  of  bias  for
the majority of trials. We rated the remaining three trials, however,
as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias  for  this  item  as  no  information
on  blinding  of  outcome  assessors  was  provided  (Cotgrove  1995;
Donaldson 2005; Spirito 2002).

Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)

For four trials, the authors reported having conducted analyses on
an intention-to-treat basis we therefore classified them as having a
low risk of bias for this item (36.4%); although the methods used to
conduct these analyses were not clear (Donaldson 2005; Harrington
1998;  Mehlum  2014;  Wood  2001a).  Although  the  authors  of  one
trial undertook per protocol analyses (Cooney 2010), as there was
a  0%  drop-out  rate  we  nevertheless  rated  it  as  having  a  low  risk
of  bias  for  this  item.  Two  trials  used  the  last  observation  carried
forward method (Hazell 2009; Ougrin 2011a), which we understand
may introduce bias (Engles 2003). We therefore rated these trials
as having an unclear risk of bias for this item. We also rated three
additional  trials  as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias  for  this  item
as there were insufficient details to confirm whether intention-to-
treat or per protocol analyses had been undertaken (Green 2011;
Rossouw 2012a; Spirito 2002). We rated one trial as having a high
risk  of  bias  for  this  item  as  around  one-fifth  of  the  consecutive
admissions during this period were not included in the trial and the
reasons for excluding these participants were not clearly stated.

Selective reporting (reporting bias)

As we did not have access to trial protocols for the trials included
in this review, it is difficult to assess the degree to which selective
outcome reporting could have occurred. Consequently, we rated all
11 trials as having an unclear risk of bias for this item.

Other potential sources of bias

We classified most trials as having a low risk of bias for this item
as  no  evidence  of  other  bias  was  apparent  (k  =  9;  81.8%).  In
one  trial,  however,  some  participants  randomised  to  the  control
group mistakenly received the intervention treatment and yet were
included in the control group for all subsequent analyses (Cotgrove
1995), whilst in another there was the potential for contamination
as therapists delivered both the intervention and control therapy
(Donaldson  2005).  We  therefore  classified  both  of  these  trials  as
having a high risk of bias for this item.

The  source  of  funding  was  not  indicated  in  three  trials  (Cooney
2010;  Cotgrove  1995;  Rossouw  2012a).  For  the  remaining  trials,
funding  was  received  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including:
government  (Harrington  1998),  health  promotion  foundations
(Wood  2001a),  joint  university  and  suicide  prevention  or  health
promotion  foundations  (Donaldson  2005;  Green  2011),  joint
charitable  and  research  foundations  (Ougrin  2011a),  and  a
combination  of  government,  university,  and  health  promotion
foundations  (Mehlum  2014;  Spirito  2002).  For  one,  no  specific
funding was received for the trial (Hazell 2009).

Comparison  9:  remote  contact  interventions  versus  treatment  as

As  only  two  interventions,  DBT-A  and  group-based  therapy,  were
evaluated in more than one independent trial, meta-analyses were
only undertaken for these two interventions. We have reported all
other interventions, which were evaluated in only single trials, in
the text.

There were no trials of pharmacological agents.

Comparison 1: Individual CBT-based psychotherapy versus
TAU

The  effectiveness  of  brief  (i.e.,  up  to  10  sessions)  skills-based
psychological  therapy  (mainly  involving  training  in  problem-
solving  and  affect  management)  versus  supportive  relationship
therapy,  which  was  designed  to  be  as  close  as  possible  to  usual
care for this population, was assessed in one small study of 12 to
17 year olds presenting to paediatric general or psychiatric facilities
following self-injury in which an intent to die was indicated (N = 39;
Donaldson 2005).

Primary outcome

1.1 Repetition of SH

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  for  brief
psychological  therapy  on  repetition  of  SH  during  the  six  month
follow-up period (4/21 versus 2/18; OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 11.73;
k  =  1;  N  =  39).  The  evidence  contributing  to  this  outcome  was  of
moderate  quality  according  to  the  GRADE  criteria  (Summary  of
findings 1).

Secondary outcomes

1.2 Treatment adherence

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  on  the
proportion  of  participants  who  completed  the  full  course  of
treatment (13/21 versus 13/18; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.43; k = 1;
N = 39).

Data  on  the  number  of  treatment  sessions  attended  was  only
available for those who completed the three and six month follow-
up assessments. There was no evidence of a significant treatment
effect on the number of sessions attended (mean 9.70, SD 2.40, n =
15 versus mean 9.50, SD 1.30, n = 16; MD 0.20, 95% CI -1.17 to 1.57;
k = 1; N = 31).

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  of  brief

1.4 Hopelessness

There were no data available for this outcome.

1.5 Suicidal ideation

There  was  also  no  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  on
suicidal ideation scores at six months (mean 27.08, SD 39.82, n = 15
versus mean 32.19, SD 30.45, n = 15; MD -5.11, 95% CI -30.48 to 20.26;

33.33, SD 30.42, n = 15; MD -8.44, 95% CI -29.54 to 12.66; k = 1; N = 30).

1.6 Problem-solving

Similarly,  no  clear  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  was
found  for  problem-solving  scores  according  to  either  the  SPSI  or
MEPS at the six month follow up assessment (SPSI: mean 126.69, SD
39.92, n = 15 versus mean 108.81, SD 31.00, n = 15; MD 17.88, 95% CI

mean 7.56, SD 3.41, n = 15; MD -0.56, 95% CI -3.31 to 2.19; k = 1; N
= 30). However, by the 12 month assessment there was evidence
of a significant treatment effect of psychological therapy according
to scores on the SPSI (mean 139.00, SD 31.39, n = 15 versus mean
105.00, SD 29.48, n = 15; MD 34.00, 95% CI 12.21 to 55.79; k = 1; N
= 30) but not on the MEPS (mean 9.44, SD 4.72, n = 15 versus mean
9.89, SD 2.47, n = 15; MD -0.45, 95% CI -3.15 to 2.25; k = 1; N = 30).

With respect to frequency of SH episodes, there was no evidence
of a treatment effect of DBT-A at the post-intervention assessment
(Analysis 1.2; k = 2; N = 104). Once again, there was no evidence of a
significant difference based on the comparator condition (i.e., TAU
or enhanced usual care; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 2.86; df
= 1; p = 0.09; I2 = 65.1%). The quality of evidence for both outcomes
was low (Summary of findings 2).

The  study  authors  of  one  of  these  trials  measured  longitudinal
changes  in  frequency  of  SH  over  a  15  week  period,  based  on
comparisons  of  assessments  "from  baseline  to  week  9  and  from
week  10  to  week  15,"  and  reported  that  "[t]he  average  drop  on
logarithmic scale in self-harm frequency in the DBT-A group (slope
-1.28,  95%  CI  -1.77  to  -0.80,  P  <  0.001)  was  highly  significant,
whereas the drop in the [enhanced usual care] group (slope -0.36,
95%  CI  -0.99  to  0.26,  P  =  0.254)  was  not.  The  between-group
difference was statistically significant (Δ slope = -0.92, 95% CI -1.69
to -0.15, P = 0.021)" (Mehlum 2014, p.7).

Secondary outcomes

2.2 Treatment adherence

Although  adolescents  randomised  to  the  DBT-A  treatment  group
attended  a  greater  number  of  individual  therapy  sessions,  there
was no evidence of a significant treatment effect (Analysis 1.3; k =
2; N = 106). However, there was evidence of a significant treatment
effect  based  on  comparator  condition  (i.e.,  TAU  versus  enhanced
usual care; Analysis 1.3; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 30.01;
df  =  1;  P  <  0.001;  I2  =  96%).  Compared  against  TAU,  participants
randomised  to  DBT-A  attended  a  significantly  greater  number  of
individual therapy sessions (MD 16.10, 95% CI 12.16 to 20.04; k = 1;
N = 29).

There  was  no  evidence  that  adolescents  randomised  to  the  DBT-
A group attended a significantly greater number of family therapy
sessions overall (Analysis 1.4; k = 2; N = 106). Once again, however,
there  was  evidence  of  a  significant  difference  by  comparator
condition (Analysis 1.4; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 16.14;
df  =  1;  P  <  0.001;  I2  93.8%).  Compared  against  TAU,  participants
randomised  to  DBT-A  attended  a  significantly  greater  number  of
family therapy sessions (MD 4.90, 95% CI 2.57 to 7.23; k = 1; N = 29).

Participants  in  the  DBT-A  group  in  Mehlum  2014  attended
significantly  more  group  sessions  compared  to  those  in  the
enhanced usual care group (mean 11.2, SD 5.9, n = 39 versus mean
0.50, SD 2.10, n = 38; MD 10.70, 95% CI 8.73 to 12.67; k = 1; N = 77). As
adolescents randomised to TAU in Cooney 2010 were not required
to attend group therapy sessions, it was not possible to assess the
effectiveness of DBT-A in this trial with respect to this outcome.

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  for  the
number of medication review meetings attended in Cooney 2010
(mean  2.40,  SD  2.20,  n  =  14  versus  mean  1.60,  SD  2.90,  n  =  15;
MD 0.80, 95% CI -1.07 to 2.67; k = 1; N = 29) or for the number of
telephone contacts received in Mehlum 2014 (mean 3.30, SD 4.50,
n = 39 versus mean 3.50, SD 4.40, n = 38; MD -0.20, 95% CI -2.19 to
1.79; k = 1; N = 77).

MADRS. There was no clear evidence of a difference in treatment
effect for DBT-A according to either measure at the post-treatment
assessment (MFQ: Analysis 1.6; MD -2.39, 95% CI -5.02 to 0.24; k = 1;
N = 77; MADRS: mean 12.29, SD 7.52, n = 39 versus mean 15.76, SD
8.14, n = 38; MD -3.47, 95% CI -6.97 to 0.03; k = 1; N = 77).

The  authors  of  this  trial  also  analysed  longitudinal  changes
in  depression  scores,  based  on  the  assessments  at  baseline
and  at  nine,  15,  and  19  weeks.  They  reported  that  whilst
"[b]oth  patient  groups  displayed  a  significant  reduction  in  self-
reported symptoms of depression...only the DBT-A group showed
a significant reduction in interviewer-rated depression..." (Mehlum
2014, p.7).

2.4 Hopelessness

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  treatment  effect  of  DBT-A  on
hopelessness at the post-intervention assessment (Analysis 1.7; k =
2; N = 101). There was, however, evidence of a significant difference
by  comparator  condition  (i.e.,  TAU  versus  enhanced  usual  care;
Analysis 1.7; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 5.13; df = 1; p =
0.02;  I2  =  80.5%).  When  compared  to  enhanced  usual  care,  DBT-
A was associated with a significant improvement in hopelessness
scores at the post-intervention assessment (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.93
to -0.02; k = 1; N = 77).

2.5 Suicidal ideation

There  was  evidence  of  an  overall  benefit  of  DBT-A  on  suicidal
ideation  at  the  post-intervention  assessment  (Analysis  1.8;  SMD
-0.62, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.16; k = 2; N = 100), but with no evidence
of a significant difference by comparator condition (i.e., TAU versus
enhanced  usual  care;  Analysis  1.8;  test  for  subgroup  differences:
Chi2 = 1.15; df = 1; p = 0.28; I2 = 13.3%).

2.6 Problem-solving

There were no data available for this outcome.

2.7 Suicide

Data  obtained  by  correspondence  with  study  authors  indicated
that  there  were  no  suicides  in  either  group  during  the  treatment
period  or  over  the  12  month  follow-up  period.  Correspondence
with study authors for Mehlum 2014 further indicated that although
information  on  outcomes  over  a  24  month  follow-up  period  are
still being collected, of those participants followed until the date of
correspondance, none had died by suicide.

Mentalisation

One  study  investigated  the  effectiveness  of  mentalisation-based
therapy in 12 to 17 year olds diagnosed with comorbid depression
presenting  to  emergency  departments  or  community  psychiatric
services  following  an  episode  of  self-injury  or  self-poisoning,
irrespective  of  whether  suicidal  intent  was  present  (Rossouw
2012a; N = 80).

Primary outcome

2.3 Depression

No data on depression scores were reported in Cooney 2010.

In Mehlum 2014, depression was measured in two ways: as scores
on the depression sub-scale of the MFQ and as total scores on the

At the 12 month (post-intervention) assessment, significantly fewer
adolescents scored above the cut-point on the Risk-Taking and Self-

k = 1; N = 71). The quality of evidence was moderate (Summary of
findings 2).

The  study  authors  also  measured  longitudinal  changes  in  scores
on  the  RTSHI  and  found  that  although  "[b]oth  groups  showed
significant  reductions  in  self-harm...following  both  a  linear  and
a  quadratic  pattern.  The  interaction  term  for  group  x  time  was
also  significant...indicating  that  the  linear  decrease  in  RTSHI
was significantly greater for the [mentalisation-based therapy for
adolescents] group" (Rossouw 2012a, p.1308).

Secondary outcomes

2.9 Treatment adherence

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  in  terms
of the number of adolescents in each group who completed all 12
months of treatment (Analysis 1.5).

2.10 Depression

Adolescents  in  the  intervention  group  had  significantly  lower
scores  on  the  depression  sub-scale  of  the  MFQ  at  the  12  month
(post-intervention) assessment (Analysis 1.6; MD -2.28, 95% CI -2.81
to -1.75; k = 1; N = 80).

Depression  was  also  measured  dichotomously  as  the  proportion
of participants scoring above the cut-point on the depression sub-
scale of the MFQ. Although fewer adolescents in the intervention
group  scored  above  the  cut-point  for  depression,  there  was  no
evidence  of  a  significant  treatment  effect  at  the  12  month  (post-
intervention) assessment (19/39 versus 25/37; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.18
to 1.16; k = 1; N = 76).

Changes  in  depression  scores  were  also  measured  longitudinally
in  the  original  report  of  this  trial.  The  study  authors  found  that
"[t]he  level  of  self-rated  depression  decreased  for  participants  in
both  groups...The  linear  rate  of  decrease  was  somewhat  greater
for the MBT-A group (P < 0.04) and the model yielded a significant
difference at 12 months" (Rossouw 2012a, p.1308).

involved  a  variety  of  techniques,  including  CBT,  PST,  DBT,  and
group  psychodynamic  psychotherapy.  Therapy  consisted  of  six
weekly  acute  group  sessions,  followed  by  weekly  or  bi-weekly

Primary outcome

3.1 Repetition of SH

There  was  no  clear  evidence  of  a  difference  in  treatment  effect
of group therapy on repetition of SH during either the six month
(Analysis 2.1; k = 2; N = 430) or 12 month (Analysis 2.2; k = 3; N =
490) intervals after entry to treatment. A low quality of evidence was
found for both analyses (Summary of findings 3). Additionally, both
of these analyses were associated with considerable heterogeneity
(I2  =  65%  and  77%,  respectively)  with,  at  six  months,  evidence
of  a  significant  adverse  effect  apparent  in  Hazell  2009.  While  we
were unable to undertake formal investigation into the source of
heterogeneity, it should be noted that in Wood 2001a, the definition
of repetition of SH was based on there being two or more further
episodes whilst in Hazell 2009 and Green 2011, repetition was based
on there being any further episodes of SH. Also, Wood 2001a and
Hazell 2009 were relatively small such that chance findings may be
more likely.

Primary outcome

4.1 Repetition of SH

There was no evidence for a difference in treatment effect following
an episode of SH during either the 12 month (4/35 versus 5/34; OR

One  study  investigated  the  effectiveness  of  standard  disposition
(i.e.,  aftercare)  planning  with  and  without  an  added  compliance
enhancement intervention over a three month follow-up period in a
sample of 12 to 19 year olds admitted to the emergency department
of a general hospital following an episode of self-injury irrespective
of intent (Spirito 2002 N = 76).

in  the  compliance  enhancement  group  did,  however,  "engage  in
fewer repeat SH episodes" compared to participants in the control
group  (mean  0.10  versus  0.15;  Spirito  2002),  although  no  more

This  systematic  review  is  an  update  of  previous  versions  of
a  Cochrane  review  (Hawton  1998;  Hawton  1999).  It  also  adds
to  raw  data  we  provided  to  the  UK's  National  Institute  for
Clinical  Excellence  in  2010  to  contribute  to  its  guidance  on  the
longer-term  management  of  self-harm  (NICE  2011).  Whilst  those
versions included psychosocial and pharmacological interventions
for  adults  as  well  as  children  and  adolescents  who  engage  in
SH,  this  update  is  solely  focused  on  interventions  for  children
and adolescents. Previously we commented on the small number
of  trials  that  have  focused  on  interventions  for  this  population.
Although  for  this  update  we  identified  five  additional  trials,  it  is
still surprising that there have been so few trials in this population,
especially  given  the  size  of  the  problem  of  SH  in  young  people
in  many  countries  and  the  known  association  between  SH  and
suicide.

In our previous review we commented on the fact that the majority
of trials included either solely patients who had taken overdoses,
or  samples  in  which  the  majority  had.  However,  there  are  other
important patient subgroups, especially those who cut themselves.
None  of  the  trials  included  in  this  review  specifically  focused  on
these patients. However, such patients were included in many of
the trials, especially those where a large proportion (or all) of the
participants had a history of multiple episodes of SH at trial entry
(e.g., Green 2011; Hazell 2009; Mehlum 2014; Rossouw 2012a; Wood
2001a).  It  should  be  noted  that  individuals  who  repeat  SH  may
change from one method of SH to another method in subsequent
episodes (Lilley 2008).

None  of  the 
included  trials  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of
pharmacological  agents  in  this  patient  group.  Additionally,  only
one  included  information  on  adverse  effects  of  the  intervention
therapies  other  than  those  relating  to  further  suicidal  behaviour
(Hazell 2009).

We have used the intention-to-treat method where data allowed.
This  was  usually  possible  when  examining  the  outcomes  of
repetition  of  SH  and  suicide.  Where  outcomes  relied  on  patient
interview, this was generally not possible and we have instead used
all available case data.

Summary of main results

Individual CBT-based psychotherapy

In a single trial of brief psychological therapy consisting of problem-
solving  and  affect  management  training  skills  compared  with
supportive  relationship  therapy  (Donaldson  2005),  no  beneficial
effects  of  the  psychological  therapy  were  found  in  terms  of
repetition  of  SH,  treatment  adherence,  depression,  and  suicidal
ideation. There was evidence of improved problem-solving on one
measure at 12 months but not on a second measure.

Interventions for patients with multiple episodes of SH or
emerging personality disorder

There was no apparent benefit for DBT-A, compared with either TAU
(Cooney 2010) or enhanced usual care (Mehlum 2014), using cross-
sectional analyses of the proportion of participants repeating SH
(Cooney 2010) or the numbers of SH episodes per patient by the
end of the therapy period (Cooney 2010; Mehlum 2014). However,
in  Mehlum  2014,  the  authors  analysed  the  longitudinal  slope  of

decline  in  mean  number  of  SH  episodes  per  participant  based
on information reported at the baseline, nine week, and 15 week
assessments,  and  reported  a  significant  benefit  for  DBT-A.  It  is
difficult to rationalise these two sets of results. The results of our
analyses suggest that any differences between the groups following
treatment were not marked.

There  was  no  apparent  treatment  effect  in  the  second  trial  on
depression using data from both the Self-report Mood and Feelings
Questionnaire  (SMFQ)  and  the  Montgomery-Åsberg  Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS) based on analyses of the post-intervention
scores. However, again when the authors of the Mehlum 2014 trial
used  a  longitudinal  analysis  based  on  scores  from  the  SMFQ,  it
suggested  significant  positive  benefits  of  DBT-A  on  depression.
Again, the difference between the result of this analysis and ours
based on post-treatment results would suggest that any treatment
effect was not marked. Our analyses showed significant benefits of
DBT-A for both hopelessness and suicidal ideation at the 19 week
(post-intervention) assessment in Mehlum 2014 but not at the post-
intervention assessment in Cooney 2010. There is therefore some
evidence  of  beneficial  effects  for  DBT-A,  although  the  evidence
regarding  repetition  of  SH  and  depression  must  currently  be
regarded as equivocal.

In  a  single  trial  of  mentalisation-based  therapy,  there  was  a
significant effect on repetition of SH in favour of mentalisation at
the post-intervention assessment (Rossouw 2012a). However, this
was based on fewer adolescents scoring above the cut-point on the
Risk Taking and Self-Harm Inventory (RTSHI) and it is unclear how
this scale may relate to actual SH behaviour.

There  was  no  apparent  beneficial  effect  of  mentalisation  on
depression as measured by the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire at
the post-intervention assessment. However, it is worth noting that
considerably fewer adolescents in the mentalisation group scored
above  the  cut-point  for  depression  at  the  12-month  assessment,
although the study was relatively underpowered for this outcome
criterion (n = 40 per treatment arm). Changes in depression scores
were also measured longitudinally in the original report of this trial.
The study authors found that "[t]he level of self-rated depression
decreased  for  participants  in  both  groups...The  linear  rate  of
decrease was somewhat greater for the MBT-A group (P < 0.04) and
the model yielded a significant difference at 12 months" (Rossouw
2012a,  p.1308).  These  results  suggest  there  might  be  benefits
for  mentalisation  over  usual  care,  but  this  treatment  approach
requires  evaluation  in  further  trials  before  a  stronger  conclusion
can be reached.

Group-based therapy

Three trials investigated group-based therapy in adolescents with
a history of multiple SH episodes (Green 2011; Hazell 2009; Wood
2001a).  There  was  no  overall  evidence  of  apparent  benefit  of
group  psychotherapy  on  repetition  of  SH.  However,  considerable
heterogeneity  was  associated  with  the  results  of  the  earlier  two
studies  (Hazell  2009;  Wood  2001a),  whilst  the  results  of  the  third
much larger trial indicated no superiority of group-based therapy
compared with treatment as usual (Green 2011).

Therapeutic assessment

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

following SH. In a single trial a therapeutic assessment approach
appeared to considerably increase treatment adherence in terms
of  the  number  of  participants  who  attended  the  first  treatment
session as compared to treatment as usual (Ougrin 2011a). There
were, however, no apparent beneficial effects in terms of repetition
of SH at 12 or 24 months. These results are based on a single cluster
randomised trial, which may overestimate the effectiveness of this
intervention.

Compliance enhancement

In  a  single  small  trial,  compliance  enhancement  did  not  result  in
improved outcomes compared with standard treatment in terms of
treatment adherence or repetition of SH (Spirito 2002). However,
the trial was probably underpowered to evaluate these outcomes.
The  findings  of  this  study  are  at  odds  with  that  of  therapeutic
assessment  (Ougrin  2011a),  which  also  focused  on  enhancing
treatment adherence. However, the latter trial appeared to involve
a more intensive and pro-active therapeutic approach as part of the
assessment.

Home-based family intervention

A  home-based  family  intervention  did  not  appear  to  produce  a
better outcome than standard treatment in terms of repetition of
SH, suicidal ideation, problem solving, and hopelessness. However,
Harrington 1998 did report that parents were more satisfied with
the home-based family intervention at initial follow-up.

Remote contact interventions

In a single study to assess the effects of provision of an emergency
card allowing patients to re-admit themselves to hospital (Cotgrove
1995),  there  was  no  difference  in  repetition  of  SH  between  the
intervention and control groups. However, the study appeared to
be underpowered to properly test this outcome. Few adolescents
made  use  of  the  emergency  card,  but  none  of  those  who  did
repeated SH.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Completeness of evidence

There have been relatively few trials of interventions for adolescent
SH  patients  (we  identified  just  11),  especially  compared  with  the
numbers of trials of psychosocial treatments for adults. Therefore
our  conclusions  are  limited  to  a  small  range  of  interventions
and  outcomes.  Additionally,  as  there  were  no  eligible  trials  of
pharmacological  interventions,  perhaps  due  to  concerns  about
safety  in  this  clinical  population,  our  findings  are  limited  to
psychosocial interventions.

A  range  of 
including
modifications  of  existing  assessment  procedures  and  attempts
to  increase  participant  adherence,  as  well  as  specific  aftercare
interventions.  Mostly,  however,  these  evaluations  have  been
limited  to  single  trials.  Three  trials  focused  on  group-based
psychotherapy,  which  is  perhaps  unsurprising  given  the  initial
optimism associated with the publication of the first trial of group-
based therapy in 2001 (Wood 2001a). There were two trials of DBT-
A; all other interventions, including brief psychological therapy and
mentalisation, were evaluated only in single trials.

Given  the  known  poor  treatment  adherence  of  adolescents  who
engage  in  SH  (Granboulan  2001;  Taylor  1984),  efforts  have  been
made  to  increase  adherence  through  therapeutic  assessment

In  the  previous  versions  of  this  review  we  only  focused  on  a
single  clinical  outcome,  namely  repetition  of  SH  and  suicide.

In  this  update  we  have  considerably  expanded  the  range  of
clinically  relevant  outcomes  that  have  been  examined  to  include
treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation,
and  problem-solving  where  available.  We  have  also  reported  on
the  frequency  of  SH  where  these  data  were  available.  However,
limited  data  were  available  on  secondary  outcomes.  Only  four
trials included information on depression, five on suicidal ideation,
three on hopelessness and two on problem-solving. Information on
suicide had to be requested from study authors for all 11 trials.

Applicability of evidence

The  participants  in  the  included  trials  appear  to  have  been
reasonably representative of adolescents who present to hospital
following SH, including a greater proportion of female participants
in all trials that recorded information on gender. Four trials focused
specifically  on  individuals  with  a  history  of  multiple  episodes  of
SH, which is a particular concern in this clinical population given
its association with subsequent repetition (Hawton 2012c). In two
further  trials  around  one-half  of  participants  had  a  history  of
multiple episodes of SH.

It should be noted that this review is focused exclusively on children
and  adolescents  who  have  engaged  in  SH.  As  a  result,  we  have
excluded  patients  with  conditions  such  as  emergent  borderline
personality disorder who have not engaged in SH, and mixed trials
of  patients  with  either  SH  or  suicidal  ideation  in  the  absence  of
suicidal behaviour.

Quality of the evidence

The  trials  included  in  this  review  were,  in  general,  relatively
small  to  detect  significant  differences  in  proportions  of  patients
who  engaged  in  a  repeat  episode  of  SH.  Additionally,  quality
of  evidence,  as  assessed  using  the  GRADE  approach,  was,  in
general,  low  suggesting  that  further  research  is  likely  to  have  an
important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment
effectiveness,  and  may,  in  fact,  change  the  estimate.  This  is
particularly  likely  to  affect  results  on  those  interventions  that
have so far only been assessed in single trials. However, it should
be  noted  that  because  of  the  virtual  impossibility  of  blinding
participants  and  clinical  personnel  to  treatment  condition  in
psychosocial  intervention  trials  such,  studies  are  always  likely  to
receive relatively low quality ratings.

Limitations in design and implementation

All  trials  included  in  this  review  possessed  high  risk  of  bias  in
relation to at least one aspect of trial design, with weaknesses most
commonly observed with respect to blinding of both participants
and  clinical  personnel.  In  part  this  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that
psychological  interventions  predominated  in  this  review  and  we
believe it is generally not possible to blind participants or clinical
personnel to psychological therapy. Such trials are therefore always
likely to receive relatively low ratings. Nevertheless, performance
and detection bias cannot be ruled out.

Indirectness of evidence

Repetition  of  SH  was  measured  using  self-reported  information,
medical records, or representation to hospital in all trials included
in  this  review.  Secondary  outcomes  were  assessed  using  widely
validated psychometric measures (such as MFQ, SIQ) that were not
subjected to modification in scoring.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Unexplained heterogeneity of inconsistency of results

Meta-analysis  was  only  undertaken  for  two  interventions:  DBT-
A  and  group-based  therapy.  Considerable  heterogeneity  was,
however, found for the three trials included in the latter analyses,
particularly  with  respect  to  the  primary  outcome  of  repetition  of
SH (I2= 65% for repetition at six months and I2= 77% for repetition
of  SH  at  12  months).  I2  values  for  all  other  secondary  outcome
measures equalled zero. It is possible that differences in available
services, and hence in treatment as usual more broadly, might be
one  explanation  for  this  heterogeneity.  Another  might  be  that  a
different  definition  of  repetition  was  used  in  the  first  trial  (Wood
2001a), namely two or more further SH episodes. However, it may
also be that group-based therapy does not adequately address the
psychological needs of young people who have a history of multiple
SH episodes (Townsend 2014) or, possibly, treatment of adolescent
repeaters of SH in a group may carry risks of encouraging repetition
through contagious influences (Hawton 2012a).

Imprecision of results

Results  of  the  individual  trials  included  in  this  review  were
associated with a high level of imprecision as indicated by the wide
confidence intervals around the effect size estimates.

Probability of publication bias

Presence of publication bias could not be formally evaluated in this
review as no meta-analysis included ten or more trials. However, it
is notable that one trial was not published in full in a peer-reviewed
journal (Cooney 2010).

Potential biases in the review process

We  have  no  reason  to  believe  we  have  not  identified  all  relevant
trials of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. By using
the  random-effects  model  in  all  analyses,  our  results  possess
greater generalisability than if we had used the fixed-effect model
(Erez  1996).  However,  because  our  review  criteria  included  only
studies  of  patients  who  had  all  engaged  in  SH  and  presented
to  child  and  adolescent  clinical  services  in  the  preceding  six
months,  we  excluded  trials  where  only  some  of  the  patients  had
engaged in SH. Thus, for example, trials of adolescents with suicidal
ideation were excluded. Positive results of some trials which have
included  such  participants  suggest  a  possible  preventive  role  of
more  intensive  forms  of  psychotherapy,  including,  for  example,
multisystemic therapies in adolescents who SH (e.g., Huey 2004).
However, such an assumption requires further evaluative research,
especially  given  the  recognised  differences  between  adolescents
who  have  ideas  of  SH  and  those  that  actually  engage  in  SH
(O'Connor  2012).  We  also  excluded  studies  where  SH  was  an
outcome  in  studies  of  general  interventions  for  patients  with
psychiatric disorders. Data on repetition of SH were available for all
the included trials and information on suicides was available for all
but one trial (although there was only one such event recorded).

We  only  included  trials  in  which  adolescents  engaged  in  SH  and
presented  to  clinical  services.  For  those  who  do  not  present
to  services  possible  therapeutic  approaches  include  online/
bibliotherapy  interventions,  or  screening  adolescents  to  identify
those at risk.

We categorised the interventions in this review based on consensus
discussions  among  the  review  team  who  have  considerable

experience  in  both  research  and  clinical  practice  related  to
SH.  We  believe  this  approach  is  more  informative  and  far
less  misleading  than  where  reviewers  have  combined  disparate
therapies in an attempt to evaluate whether psychosocial therapy
in  general  might  be  effective,  irrespective  of  the  specific  content
of  the  interventions,  which  provides  little  useful  information  for
clinicians.  Nevertheless,  we  have  combined  interventions  only
where  the  therapeutic  model  is  similar  between  trials.  For  this
reason, meta-analysis was undertaken for only two interventions
(i.e., DBT-A and group-based psychotherapy). Both trials of DBT-A,
Cooney  2010  and  Mehlum  2014,  refer  to  the  original  manualised
adaption of DBT for adolescents (Miller 2007). We therefore believe
that these two trials are based on the same therapeutic model and
are sufficiently similar to justify pooling within meta-analysis. The
latter two replications of group-based psychotherapy, Green 2011
and  Hazell  2009,  refer  to  the  original  trial  of  this  therapy  (Wood
2001a); all three trials were based on the same therapeutic model
and all recruited adolescents with a history of multiple episodes of
SH. We therefore believe that these three trials are also sufficiently
similar to justify pooling within a second meta-analysis.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

identified  11  reviws  of 

We 
interventions  for  children  and
adolescents  following  SH.  Ten  were  systematic  reviews  (Brausch
2012;  Daniel  2009;  Gonzales  2013;  Gould  2003;  Newton  2010;
Nock  2007;  Ougrin  2011b;  Ougrin  2012;  Ougrin  2015;  Robinson
2011),  and  one  was  a  narrative  review  (Brent  2013).  All  reviews
included  both  randomised  and  non-randomised  trials  and  some
also  included  findings  relating  to  adults  who  had  self-harmed.
Only  two  included  meta-analyses  (Ougrin  2011b;  Ougrin  2015).
However, these pooled very disparate treatment approaches with
likely differing therapeutic mechanisms of action and patients with
different characteristics (especially in terms of frequency of prior
repetition of SH).

A  number  of  these  reviews  focused  specifically  on  engagement
with  treatment,  although  no  one  intervention  was  found  to
be  significantly  better  than  treatment  as  usual  for  engaging
adolescents  in  subsequent  treatment  (Ougrin  2011b;  but  see
Ougrin 2011a in the present review). With respect to repetition of
SH,  several  reviews  suggest  that  DBT-A  (Brausch  2012;  Gonzales
2013; Gould 2003; Nock 2007), hospital-based interventions (Brent
2013),  transitional  interventions  (Newton  2010),  or  those  with
a  brief  cognitive  behavioural  or  problem-solving  orientation
(Daniel  2009;  Robinson  2011),  may  show  promise  for  the
treatment  of  suicidal  behaviour  in  adolescents.  However,  these
recommendations  are  typically  based  on  data 
from  non-
randomised trials, or from trials in adults.

Group-based  therapy  was  also  identified  as  a  potentially  useful
treatment  in  one  review  (Gonzales  2013),  on  the  basis  of  data
from one RCT in adolescents (Green 2011). However, we found no
evidence of a significant treatment effect for this trial, including in
terms of reduced repetition of SH, at either six or 12 months follow-
up (we also found no evidence of a significant treatment effect for
all  other  outcomes  in  this  trial).  Multisystemic  therapy  was  also
found to be effective in one review for reducing suicide attempts in
adolescents experiencing a variety of psychiatric crises, but not in
those with a history of SH specifically (Ougrin 2012).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

For  the  trial  by  Mehlum  2014,  Ougrin  2015  reported  data  on
the  proportions  of  participants  who  repeated  SH,  irrespective
of  whether  this  resulted  in  hospital  presentation  (the  only  data
available for the present review) or not. This apparently showed a
significant  difference,  with  fewer  participants  in  the  DBT-A  group
repeating SH than in the control group. However, correspondence
with  the  study  author  indicated  that  these  data  have  not  been
released.  The  only  relevant  data  were  presented  in  an  interim
analysis  on  an  initial  sample  of  participants,  not  the  full  study
population. We were unable to obtain the final study data for this
outcome.

The  lack  of  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  pharmacological
interventions  for  SH  in  adolescents  is  also  highlighted  in  several
of  these  reviews.  However,  as  noted  in  the  How  the  intervention
might work section, concerns about safety of drug therapy in young
people may partly explain this.

Implications for practice

There have been relatively few investigations into interventions for
children and adolescents who engage in SH. Thus there is not much
evidence on which to draw conclusions on effects of interventions
for  SH  in  this  population.  While  there  were  some  very  limited
positive findings regarding DBT-A, mentalisation, and therapeutic
assessment,  these  approaches  require  further  evaluation  before
any  definitive  conclusions  about  their  use  in  clinical  practice
can  be  made.  Results  of  this  review  would  suggest  that  a
comprehensive therapeutic assessment may increase engagement
with  subsequent  treatment.  Although  this  finding  is  based  on
a  single  cluster  randomised  trial  which  may  overestimate  the
effectiveness  of  the  intervention,  this  result  suggests  that  a
comprehensive therapeutic assessment might be a useful part of a
clinical intervention.

However,  on  the  strength  of  the  evidence  from  three  trials,
including  one  recent  larger  trial,  there  is  little  support  for  group-
based therapy for adolescents with a history of multiple episodes of
SH. Additionally, it is notable that the authors of one of these trials
reports  an  incident  in  which  one  participant  posted  confidential
information  about  another  participant  on  an  online  blog  (Hazell
2009), highlighting the potential risks associated with group-based
therapy in this clinical population.

Implications for research

While  there  were  no  very  strong  positive  findings  from  the
review,  some  of  the  results  regarding  therapeutic  assessment,
mentalisation, and DBT-A suggests that these approaches warrant
further evaluation.

Given  the  evidence  for  its  benefit  in  adults  who  engage  in  SH
(NICE  2011),  individual  CBT-based  psychotherapy  needs  to  be
further  developed  and  evaluated  in  children  and  adolescents.
The  development  of  this  type  of  treatment  could  benefit  from
being based on detailed investigation of the psychological factors
contributing  to  SH  in  children  and  adolescents,  including  factors
that might enhance resilience and thereby reduce the risk of further
SH,  as  well  as  having  benefits  for  other  outcomes.  Ideally,  the
development of new treatments should ensure their feasibility and
suitability for the young people for whom they are designed (Craig
2008);  children  and  adolescents  with  experience  of  SH  and  their

carers should be involved in this process. Heed should also be paid
to the principles of development and evaluation of treatments as
laid  out  in  the  UK  Medical  Research  Council  guidance  regarding
complex interventions.

In trials of interventions for children and adolescents who engage
in  SH,  investigations  of  treatment  could  focus  on  subgroups  of
adolescents, including those with a history of multiple episodes of
SH and those with a single or only few episodes, those with clearly
identified  psychiatric  disorders,  especially  depression,  and  those
with emergent borderline personality disorder. Specific treatments
for  self-cutting  and  other  forms  of  self-mutilation,  which  are
common in adolescents, also merit development and evaluation.

In  several  trials  in  this  review,  especially  the  more  recent
trials,  a  relatively  broad  range  of  outcome  measures  have  been
investigated. This is to be encouraged in future trials. Any trial of
an intervention for SH in children and adolescents should include
a  range  of  outcome  measures;  not  just  SH  and  suicide,  but  also
adherence,  mood,  and  attitudes  towards  treatment,  as  this  may
help  to  identify  contributors  to  any  apparent  benefits  or  lack  of
impact. Investigation of the mechanisms through which treatments
might  work  is  also  desirable  to  assist  with  the  identification  of
clinically  relevant  sub-groups  of  patients  who  may  benefit  from
certain  more  intensive  forms  of  intervention.  It  is  also  important
that  any  adverse  effects  of  treatment,  such  as  the  release  of
confidential  information  described  in  the  Hazell  2009  trial,  are
carefully evaluated. It is essential that future trials in this patient

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

population  are  adequately  powered  to  detect  differences  in  key
clinical outcomes, especially repetition of SH.

The interventions we found to warrant further investigation given
some  positive  findings  regarding  frequency  of  repetition  of  SH
-  mentalisation  and  DBT-A  -  both  involve  a  core  component  of
intensive,  relatively  prolonged,  one-on-one  therapy  suggesting
that  where  novel  therapies  for  this  population  are  considered,
those involving extended contact may be particularly valuable.

It  is  essential  that  future  trials  in  this  patient  population  are
adequately powered to detect differences in key clinical outcomes,
especially repetition of SH.

Methods

Allocation: random allocation using open number table.

Follow-up period: 12 months.

N lost to follow up: 0/105 (0%) for repetition of SH data.

Participants

Inclusion criteria: i) aged 16 years or under.

Exclusion criteria: i) records of original suicide attempt missing or those with "insufficient follow-up da-
ta" (p.572).

Numbers: Of the 105 participants, 47 were allocated to the experimental arm and 58 to the control arm.

ror in one centre in the way five of the green cards were issued; either sever-
al weeks after discharge without adequate explanation, or in a couple of cas-
es, not at all. This invalidated the follow-up data from this centre for these five
cases in the treatment group, but not on those in the control group." (p. 572)

Comment: The inclusion of participants who may have received the treatment
intervention within the control group may lead to bias in the estimation of
the treatment effect, particularly as it is unclear how these five cases were as-
sessed. Additionally, the authors claim the intervention was effective even

Study characteristics

Methods

Allocation: Following correspondence with study authors, it became apparent that simple randomisa-
tion using a random numbers table had been used to generate the allocation sequence.

Follow-up period: 3 and 6 months. Follow-up data on functioning for a sub-sample of participants was
available for 12 months.

N lost to follow up: 8/39 (21%) for repetition data.

Participants

Inclusion criteria: i) aged 12-17 years; ii) primary language was English; iii) outpatient care indicated; iv)
intent to die indicated.

Interventions

Exclusion criteria: i) psychosis indicated on mental status examination; ii) clinician judgement that in-
tellectual functioning precluded outpatient psychotherapy.

Numbers: Of the 39 participants, 21 were allocated to the experimental arm and 18 to the control arm.

Profile: 48% (15/31) were repeaters, 29% (9/31) were diagnosed with major depression, 19% (6/31) were
diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.

Source of participants: patients presenting to a general paediatric emergency department or inpatient
unit of an affiliated child psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt.

Location: Northeast USA, possibly Providence, RI.

Experimental: Skills-based treatment focused on improving problem solving and affect management
skills. Additionally, participants were taught problem solving and cognitive and behavioural strategies
and given homework assignments to further improve their skills. Treatment comprised two parts: i) ac-
tive treatment for the first three months which included six individual sessions and one adjunct fami-
ly session with two additional family sessions and two crisis sessions available at the therapist’s discre-
tion; ii) maintenance treatment for the remaining three months which included three sessions.

Control: Supportive relationship therapy focused on addressing the adolescent's mood and behaviour,
including unstructured sessions which addressed reported symptoms and problems, and fostered the
development of specific skills not otherwise addressed during treatment. This intervention was de-
signed to resemble usual care for this population in this community.

Therapist: 5 clinicians and 2 individuals with master’s degrees provided treatment for both study arms.

Type of therapy offered: problem solving therapy.

Length of treatment: 6 months.

Outcomes

Notes

Included: i) repetition of SH; ii) suicide; iii) suicidal ideation; iv) depression; v) problem solving; vi) com-
pliance.

Excluded: i) anger.

Source of funding: "This project was supported by NIMH (MH05749), the American Foundation for Sui-
cide Prevention, and the Harvard Pilgrim Research Foundation" (p.113).

Asarnow 2014 

Study name

Family-based intervention for adolescent suicide attempters. Extension: Self-Harm and Suicide At-
tempt Risk: Evaluation of an Intervention for Youths with Self-Harm Behaviour. The SAFETY Study.

Trial Registration Number: NCT00692302.

Methods

Allocation: single-blind randomisation.

Participants

Interventions

Design: single-centre (hospital-affiliated outpatient psychiatric clinic).

Setting: hospital-affiliated outpatient psychiatric clinic in an academic medical centre.

Follow-up period: 3 months.

Location: Los Angeles, USA.

Males and females, between 11 and 18 years of age inclusive, selected for presence of suicide at-
tempt within the previous 3 months, were eligible for participation in this trial. An extension of this
protocol also enables those with a history of clinically significant self-harming behaviour to be in-
cluded. Clinically significant self-harming behaviour is defined as: 1) an episode of NSSI in the past
3 months; 2) this episode of NSSI is viewed as indicating the presenting problem or a major part of
the presenting problem (e.g., the youth presents with NSSI plus suicidal ideation, or with NSSI plus
depression), and 3) a pattern of repeated self-harm behaviour is present as evident by a total or 2
or more lifetime episodes of NSSI and/or suicidal attempts.

Those randomised to the intervention group received SAFETY, a cognitive-behavioural oriented
family treatment rooted in socio-ecological theory. Those randomised to the control group re-
ceived enhanced treatment as usual. In this study, enhancements included 2 additional elements:
1) parents and the youth attended one session with a study clinician to discuss safety, self-harm,
and suicide risk as well as the importance of outpatient treatment to address these issues; and 2)
care linkage support was also offered for a period of 12 weeks with monthly check-in sessions to
support patients in linking up with community treatment through the provision of motivational en-
hancement and problem-solving therapy.

Outcomes

Primary outcome: repeat episodes of self-harming behaviour at 3 months follow-up.

Secondary outcomes: repeat episodes of NSSI and/or attempted suicide as separate outcomes at
3 months follow-up, scores on a measure of depression for both the youth and his/her parents at
3 months follow-up, scores on a measure of hopelessness at 3 months follow-up, scores on a mea-
sure of social adjustment at 3 months follow-up, and patient satisfaction at 3 months follow-up.

Starting date

December 2010.

Recruitment period closed: between December 2011 and July 2012.

Proposed end date: December 2014.

Cottrell 2014 

Study name

Self-harm intervention, family therapy (SHIFT): A randomised controlled trial of family therapy ver-
sus treatment as usual for young people seen after second or subsequent episodes of self-harm.

Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN 59793150.

Methods

Allocation: randomised.

Design: multi-centre (hospital and community).

Setting: community.

Follow-up period: 18 months.

Participants

Interventions

Outcomes

Location: multiple locations around the north of England and London.

Males and females, between 11 and 17 years of age, who have engaged in at least one episode of
self-harm as assessed by the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health team as well as at least one
additional episode of self-harm prior to the index presentation, will be included in this trial. Those
diagnosed with severe major depression necessitating psychiatric inpatient care will be excluded
from participation. Self-harming behavior includes any form of non-fatal self-poisoning or self-in-
jury such as cutting, overdose, hanging, self-strangulation, jumping from a height, and deliberately
running in front of traffic regardless of the motive and/or intent to die.

N: 832.

Participants (and their families) randomised to the experimental group will receive up to 8 sessions
over a 6 month period of family therapy delivered by qualified family therapists using a modified
version of the Leeds Family Therapy and Research Centre Systemic Family Therapy Manual.

Primary outcome: rates of repetition of self-harm leading to hospital admission within the 18 month
follow-up period.

Secondary outcomes: number of participants engaging in self-harm within 12 months post-ran-
domisation, cost effectiveness of family therapy as measured by the cost of each self-harm event
avoided due to family therapy, number of subsequent self-harm episodes, time to subsequent
self-harm episodes, severity of subsequent episodes, dangerousness of the method/s used in any
subsequent episode as measured by the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview, scores on the Beck
Scale for Suicide Ideation, and scores on the Paediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction
questionnaire.

Starting date

September 2009. First participant recruited April 2010.

Recruitment period closed: December 2013.

Follow-up period concludes: June 2015.

Diamond 2014  (Continued)

Trial Registration Number: NCT01195740.

Methods

Allocation: randomised.

Design: single-centre (mental health inpatient unit).

Setting: community.

Follow-up period: 16 weeks.

Location: Philadelphia, USA.

Participants

Interventions

Male and female adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age, who made at least one suicide at-
tempt in the previous month were included in this trial. Preliminary results suggest 80% of partici-
pants were female, 65% were of African-American ethnicity.

Participants randomised to the experimental group received attachment based family therapy
alongside enhanced usual care. Enhanced usual care is a facilitated referral process with ongoing
clinical monitoring. Each adolescent's treating therapist was ultimately responsible for engaging
and retaining the adolescent and their family with treatment.

Outcomes

Primary outcome: scores on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Cornell Services Index
measured at 16 weeks post-treatment.

Secondary Outcomes: scores on various measures of attachment with parents (e.g., the Relatedness
Scale and the Relationship Structures Questionnaire), and scores on the Lethality of Suicide At-
tempt Rating Scale at 16 weeks post-treatment. Information on future suicide attempts and scores
on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, the Columbia Suicide-Sever-
ity Scale, and the Suicide Intent Scale were also collected.

Starting date

April, 2009.

End date: May, 2011.

Notes

Dr. Suzanne Levy and Dr. Guy Diamond very kindly provided unpublished information relating to
this trial. Additionally, Dr. Levy provided the following notes pertaining to the findings of this study:

"In 2011, we completed a pilot study testing the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of Attach-
ment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT; Diamond et. al, 2002) as an aftercare model. We aimed to build
on the gains made during inpatient treatment and reduce risk factors for future suicide attempt.
Additionally, we sought to strengthen our partnership with an adolescent inpatient unit, creat-
ing an infrastructure for long-term collaboration in suicide research. Twenty adolescents (80% fe-
male, 65% identified as African American), with mean age of 14.9 years, and a parent/caregiver
were recruited from inpatient care following a suicide attempt. Of the parents, 8 (40%) had an in-
come under $30,000, 14 (70%) were single or separated/divorced, and 7 (35%) had no more than
a high school education. Families were randomised to 16 weeks of either ABFT or Enhanced Usu-
al Care (EUC). As a result of variety of means to build a relationship with a local psychiatric hospi-
tal (meeting with hospital staff, holding case conferences, quick response time to referrals [intake
within 48 hours of discharge], follow-up post referral, and hosting free educational presentations)
we were able to successfully join with the hospital and create a lasting research infrastructure to
support future research projects. ABFT was a welcomed option by all of the social workers, nurs-
es, and psychiatrists on the inpatient unit. In terms of feasibility, we met our recruitment goals, the
majority of families were interested in receiving family therapy (74% of those referred) and those
that got ABFT attended sessions regularly (mean = 11.2 sessions). Additionally, we were able to col-
lect weekly data from participants the majority of the time and collect post treatment data from
90% of the participants. Participants receiving ABFT indicated they were marginally statistically

significantly more satisfied with treatment than those receiving EUC (t(12)=2.02, p=0.07). Related
to effectiveness, results show that compared to EUC, ABFT was marginally significantly more effec-
tive at preventing future suicide attempts (0% ABFT, 16.7% EUC Chi(1)=3.60, p=0.058; Fisher’s ex-
act p=0.206), reducing attachment related avoidance for mothers (F(1,9)=3.85, p=0.08), and ABFT
participants received treatment faster than EUC participants (t(6)=-2.09, p=.08). Additionally, ABFT
compared to EUC, was statistically more effective at reducing attachment related anxiety for fa-
thers (F(1,3)=12.33, p=0.04). Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that ABFT is both a feasi-
ble and acceptable treatment as aftercare for youth with a suicide attempt after discharge from in-
patient care."

1 All diagnoses refer to current, rather than lifetime, diagnoses. The total percentages were more than 100% in some studies due to comorbidity.
2 Conduct disorder or oppositional defiance disorder.
3 The authors state that 53/70 (75.7%) participants had previous contact with mental health services. Diagnoses are only provided in broad categories, however. Specifically,
42/70 (60.0%) were diagnosed with an "emotional disorder," 9/70 (12.8%) were diagnosed with a "disruptive disorder," and 2/70 (2.8%) were diagnosed with "another disorder."

Appendix 4. Data collection and analysis methods used for the original review

Selection of studies

In the original version of this review, Sarah Stockton, Librarian at the University of Oxford, conducted the systematic search for trials. Two
out of TTS, EA, ET, and KH then independently screened the titles of identified trials for relevancy. A distinction was made between:

1) eligible studies, in which any psychological and/or psychopharmacological treatment was compared with a control (e.g. standard or
less intensive types of aftercare or medication), and;

2) ineligible general treatment studies, without any control treatment.

A second screening was then undertaken in which two of TTS, EA, ET, and KH independently screened the full text of relevant studies with
reference to the following inclusion criteria:

1. All participants must have engaged in SH (self-poisoning or self-injury) shortly prior to randomisation;

2. Studies must have reported the number of participants engaging in a repeat episode of SH as an outcome measure;

3. Study participants must have been randomised to the treatment and control groups.

Data extraction and management

Data extraction was carried out by EA and second member of the review group (TTS, ET, or KH) using a standardised data extraction form.
Members of the review team extracted data independently from one another. Disputes were resolved through consensus discussions with
a third member of the review group, with assistance from the CCDAN editorial base.

We extracted data from each eligible trial concerning the characteristics of patients, the details of the interventions used, and information
on  the  number  of  participants  engaging  in  a  repeat  episode  of  SH  during  the  follow-up  period.  Where  these  details  were  unclear,
corresponding authors were contacted to provide additional clarification.

Assessment of risk of bias

For the original version of this review, the quality of the studies was rated by three independent review authors (EA and ET plus another
member  of  the  review  group).  Review  authors  were  blind  to  authorship  according  to  the  recommended  Cochrane  criteria  for  quality
assessment (Sackett 1997).

Given  that  the  quality  of  concealment  of  allocation  can  affect  the  results  of  trials  (Schulz  1995),  studies  were  assigned  a  quality  of
concealment rating ranging from C (poor quality) to A (high quality). Trials rated as inadequately concealed, for example via reference to an
open random number table, were given a rating of C. Trials that did not provide adequate details about how the randomisation procedure

was carried out were given a rating of B, and trials that were deemed to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation, for example
through the use of serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes and numbered or coded bottles or containers, were rated as A quality.
Where the concealment of allocation was not clearly reported (i.e. where trials were initially in category B), we contacted corresponding
authors for more information. Where raters disagreed as to the category to which a trial should be been allocated, the final rating was
made by consensus discussion in consultation with TTS, KH, and a third member of the review group.

Measures of treatment effect

RevMan, version 3.0, was used to calculate summary odds ratios and accompanying 95% CIs for the number of participants engaging in
a repeat episode of SH during the follow-up period.

Unit of analysis issues

1. Cluster trials

Clustering was an issue in one included study (Bennewith 2002), however, as the authors reported adjusting for the effects of clustering in
their primary analyses, we reproduced the data from this study as if it came from a non-cluster randomised study.

2. Studies with multiple treatment groups

One included study presented data for multiple treatment groups (Hirsch 1982). As both treatment groups were prescribed antidepressants
in this study, we combined the data from these two treatment arms.

Dealing with missing data

Where data on the primary outcome measure were incomplete or excluded from the study, corresponding author(s) were contacted to
obtain further information. Some authors used intention to treat analyses to account for missing data using a variety of different methods
which  are  discussed  within  the  'Risk  of  bias'  tables.  We  as  review  authors  did  not  attempt  to  impute  data  for  those  studies  in  which
intention-to-treat analyses had not been conducted, however. Instead, the effects of missing data were discussed in the text of the review.

Assessment of heterogeneity

Clinical  heterogeneity  was  examined  using  the  Chi2  test.  Where  this  statistic  was  significant,  potential  causes  of  heterogeneity  were
investigated as outlined in the "Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity" section below.

Assessment of reporting biases

To  assess  whether  any  meta-analysis  reported  in  this  review  are  affected  by  reporting  bias,  we  planned  to  construct  funnel  plots  to
investigate the likelihood that the results of our meta-analysis were affected by reporting bias. We were unable to undertake these analyses,
however, due to the very small number of trials included in our meta-analyses.

Data synthesis

The Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method was used to calculate pooled summary ORs and accompanying 95% CIs.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

In analyses resulting in significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the Chi2 test, an investigation into the source of this heterogeneity was
conducted. We had planned to conduct subgroup analyses by repeater status and gender, however, there were insufficient studies with
appropriate data to enable these analyses to be undertaken.

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity  analyses  were  undertaken  where  appropriate  (e.g.,  in  relation  to  risk  of  bias  of  included  trials  in  the  relative  intensity  of
treatment).

In the original protocol for this review, we planned to assess dichotomous outcome data (i.e., repetition of self-harm and suicide) using
the Peto odds ratio. Following revisions to iterations of the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2011) and new statistical advice, however, we
have instead used the Mantel-Haenszel method in this update. For this version of the review we have also expanded the range of outcomes
assessed to include depression, hopelessness, problem-solving, and suicidal ideation. We have also used the I2 statistic, rather than the
Chi2 test, to summarise between-study heterogeneity in this version in light of revisions to the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2011).

We  also  planned  to  assess  methodological  quality  of  included  trials  by  the  means  recommended  by  the  contemporary  version  of  the
Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2011). For this version of the review we have therefore created 'Risk of bias' and 'Summary of findings' tables
as per current recommendations. We have also refined the unit of analysis section, as per current recommendations, to include Zelen
designed trials and trials that report adjusted effect sizes.

We  have  also  added  three  sensitivity  analyses:  one  for  trials  which  employed  Zelen's  method  of  randomisation;  one  for  trials  that
contributed to substantial (> 75%) levels of heterogeneity; and a third for trials that included a small minority (< 15%) of adult participants.
Given the increasing use of enhanced usual care, rather than TAU, in trials in this area, we also added one sub-group analysis to determine
whether comparator choice influenced the pattern of results observed.

As we were unable to rank outcomes in a hierarchy in the present review, and given the absence of consensus rankings particularly for
hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and problem-solving, we have instead used the most common measure in any meta-analysis and report
results from any other measure in the text of the review. In future updates of this review, we will adopt any accepted outcome hierarchies.
