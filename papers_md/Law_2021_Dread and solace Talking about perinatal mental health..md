ABSTRACT: Perinatal mental health issues are a global public health challenge. Worldwide, it is
estimated that 10% of pregnant women, and 13% of women who have just given birth, experience
a mental disorder. Yet, for many reasons – including stigma, limited access to services, patients’
lack of awareness about symptoms, and inadequate professional intervention – actual rates of
clinical and subclinical perinatal mental health issues are likely higher. Studies have explored
experiences such as postpartum depression, but few involve a wider-ranging exploration of a
variety of self-reported perinatal mental health issues through personal narrative. We conducted
21 narrative interviews with women,
in two Canadian provinces, about their experiences of
perinatal mental health issues. Our aim was to deepen understanding of how individual and
cultural narratives of motherhood and perinatal mental health can be sources of shame, guilt, and
suffering, but also spaces for healing and recovery. We identiﬁed four predominant themes in
women’s narrative:
feeling like a failed mother; societal silencing of negative experiences of
motherhood; coming to terms with a new sense of self; and ﬁnding solace in shared experiences.
These ﬁndings are consistent with other studies that highlight the personal challenges associated
with perinatal mental health issues, particularly the dread of facing societal norms of the ‘good
mother’. We also highlight
for healing and self-care through sharing
experiences, and the power of narratives to help shape feelings of self-worth and a new identity.
This study adheres to the expectations for conducting and reporting qualitative research.

INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, approximately 10% of pregnant women,
and 13% of women who have just given birth, experi-
ence a mental disorder (World Health Organization
2020). Despite this relatively high incidence of mental
illness during the perinatal period (deﬁned here, as
from conception up to one-year postpartum), women
are often reluctant to disclose symptoms and access
treatment, and only about one third actually receive
professional care (Coates et al. 2004).

PREGNANCY AND MENTAL HEALTH

There have been recent calls to action at both
national and international levels (National Collaborat-
ing Centre for Mental Health 2018, American Public
Health Association 2019), to improve access to services
and support for women with perinatal mental health
problems. However, uptake has been poor
and
research suggests that this may be due, in part, to the
stigmatization of women whose experiences of preg-
nancy and motherhood do not align with idealized soci-
etal norms. For example, scholarship on postpartum
depression suggests that women are discouraged from
disclosing symptoms and seeking help for fear of being
judged as bad mothers (Anderson 2013; Beck 2002).
Other research demonstrates how the discourse of the
‘good mother’ as a ‘happy mother’ contributes to ante-
natal anxiety and depression (Staneva & Wigginton
2018), and how social expectations of pregnancy engen-
der and exacerbate antenatal distress (Staneva et al.
2017).

illness

Feminist scholars have thus critiqued the discourse
of the ‘good mother’ for the ways in which it obscures
women’s suffering (Lupton 2000). For instance, they
that medical discourse about postpartum
point out
depression often emphasizes the risk of the mother’s
mental
to the child, while minimizing the
woman’s experience and engendering fear of judge-
ment or punishment for her perceived failures as a
mother (Godderis 2010). They also show how the ‘good
mother’
experience by
instructing pregnant women to minimize stress in order
to protect their unborn child (Lupton 2012). Central to
the ‘good mother’ discourse, then,
is an exercise of
control over women’s emotions throughout the perina-
tal period to protect
the child from harm (Lupton
2000).

inﬂuences

antenatal

ideal

Existing studies on perinatal mental illness typically
focus on a single diagnosis, such as postpartum depres-
sion (Beck 2002; Holopainen & Hakulinen 2019; Max-
well et al. 2019), postpartum psychosis (Forde et al.
2020; Glover et al. 2014), or antenatal anxiety (Rowe &
Fisher 2015). Several studies also examine experiences
that evade clinical categorization, such as perinatal or
antenatal distress (Coates et al. 2015; Delaney et al.
2015; Staneva et al. 2015). While these studies provide
insight into speciﬁc experiences of perinatal distress
and mental illness, we extend this by analysing diverse
mental health issues that occur throughout the perina-
tal period. By studying multiple perinatal mental health
issues collectively, we aim to shed light, more broadly,
on women’s experiences throughout the time of preg-
nancy and birth. We believe that identifying recurring

patterns across a range of experiences will contribute
to a more holistic understanding of both diagnosed and
undiagnosed perinatal mental health issues.

A second area where we aim to contribute to the
scholarship on perinatal mental health is in relation to
the range of narratives under consideration. Current
literature on the discourse of the ‘good mother’ and
perinatal mental health tends to emphasize the harmful
effects of common socio-cultural narratives about preg-
nancy and motherhood. While we, too, explore cultural
stereotypes and discourses of ‘good’ or ‘failed’ mothers,
we also consider the therapeutic possibilities in sharing
personal narratives. This article thus explores how indi-
vidual and cultural narratives of motherhood and men-
tal health can be sources of shame, guilt, and suffering,
but also spaces for healing and recovery.

Finally,

there are compelling reasons to consider
narrative accounts of illness and healthcare such as
those presented here. People facing health issues seek
information not only about
the ‘facts and ﬁgures’
related to their illness, but also about the lived experi-
ences of others; there is a need for reliable, accessible,
and evidence-based narrative information (Shaffer
et al. 2018; Shaw et al. 2006; Ziebland & Wyke 2012),
and a dearth of accessible resources for women with
perinatal mental health issues (Schwartz et al. 2021).

METHODS

This study used a qualitative, descriptive design (San-
delowski 2000) to understand the lived experiences of
women with perinatal mental health issues. Our
approach included: a rigorous participant selection and
recruitment process to achieve a maximum variation
sample; in-depth data collection through individual nar-
rative interviews using audio and/or video recording;
and inductive, thematic data analysis and interpretation
(Braun & Clarke 2006; Patton 2002); and preparation
of a short ﬁlm for our www.healthexperiences.ca web-
site.

The study was reviewed and approved by the St.
Mary’s Hospital Research Ethics Board, and adheres to
reporting qualitative
the COREQ standards
research (Tong et al. 2007).

for

Recruitment was via email invitations to established
mental health programmes and support groups
in
Ontario and Quebec to invite patients and users of
these programmes to consider participation. We also
sent recruitment notices to professional and personal
networks who shared information about the study with
women in their circles of care. Interested participants

completed a short reply form providing their contact
information and a brief description of their emotional
or mental health issues in their own words. One of the
qualitative researchers then contacted potential partici-
pants to answer any questions, ascertain eligibility (self-
reported mental health issues at any time from concep-
tion to one-year postpartum and the ability to speak
English or French for the interview) and arrange an
interview time. In keeping with best practice in experi-
ential qualitative and narrative research (Sandelowski,
study relied on the stories and self-
1991),
described experiences of mental health problems, and
not a formal clinical diagnosis, to determine eligibility,
in contrast with effectiveness or epidemiological studies
where the diagnosis is pertinent in resolving questions
about outcomes and attribution.

this

Consent was obtained in two steps: ﬁrst to partici-
pate in the interview, with audio and/or video record-
ing; second, following their review and approval of the
transcript, to use their interview material to produce
the short ﬁlm or in future research or teaching. Partici-
pants wishing to remain anonymous could choose an
alias for any presentation of their material in print or
online. All participants were offered the opportunity to
view the ﬁlm and provide feedback or request changes
prior to the launch of the ﬁlm on the website.

Individual interviews were conducted, between June
2016 and October 2017, by senior qualitative research-
ers, with 21 women who experienced perinatal mental
health issues during the perinatal period. Participants
were aged 25–46 years (average age 35) and self-
reported a wide range of symptoms including anxiety,
mood-related problems, psychosis, personality-related
issues, and developmental problems. The most com-
mon treatments mentioned were anti-depressants. Most
had one additional child at home and the majority indi-
cated English or French as their ﬁrst language. It was
difﬁcult to ascertain diversity of ethnic or cultural back-
ground as many did not answer this question (reasons
for not answering were not clear). Table 1 presents
self-described participant attributes.

A two-part interview guide was used, beginning with
the open-ended question, ‘Tell me about your experi-
ences from when you ﬁrst noticed a change’, followed by
a semi-structured set of questions about their experi-
ences with healthcare professionals, with their family
and friends, and about where they looked for and found
support, as well as their advice for others. Interviews
took place in participants’ homes or a preferred location
(seven were conducted in workplace or research set-
tings) and ranged from 44 to 107 min. (Interview guide

is available as Supporting information). Audio recordings
were professionally transcribed and then checked for
accuracy and anonymized by the qualitative researchers.
Five participants chose to use an alias. We included
women with a range of issues including those related to
depression, anxiety, and substance use.

We undertook thematic analysis of the ﬁnal tran-
scripts, using the constant comparative method, and
the application of hybrid inductive-deductive coding
strategy, working from the original text of the tran-
script, the emerging themes, and the questions posed
in the interview guide (Miles & Huberman 1994;
Strauss & Corbin 1990). Three qualitative researchers
from the study team participated in the development
of the initial coding framework, analysis, and identiﬁca-
tion of key themes. (Green & Thorogood 2018).

Feeling like a failed mother

Many women described themselves as feeling like a
failed mother. Some associated past events with their
current feelings about their capacity to parent. For
example, one participant, who had previously lost twins
in the ﬁrst trimester, recalled how she felt immediately
after the birth of a subsequent baby:

I slept there in the, the paeds ward with, you know, all
these other moms . . . my baby was a few days old and
I’m feeling really I have no conﬁdence in myself as a
mom. Because, you know, I still
in the back of my
mind had this ‘Well I killed my ﬁrst two babies, I can’t
(PMH03)
be trusted with a baby now’.

Such feelings of inadequacy, stemming from a per-
ceived inability to live up to a high standard of mother-
ing, were widely shared.

As participants explained, self-doubt often emerged
in comparisons with past or aspirational selves, with
other women, or with unattainable, gendered ideals.
Many participants
saw other mothers or pregnant
women as happy and connected to their babies, while
they felt different from these ‘normal’ moms. Partici-
pants also described feeling pressured to appear happy
when they were around other pregnant women and
mothers, or judged for their choices such as using for-
mula instead of breast feeding or taking antidepressant
medication while pregnant:

When you’re feeling this way and you meet up with

because, you know, they feel happy, they look like
they’ve got things together, and you’re just like feeling,

Silencing negative experiences of motherhood

life,

sense of

Having experiences that deviated from social expecta-
tions of pregnancy and the postpartum period as happy
phases of
safety
impacted women’s
around sharing their negative or challenging experi-
ences. Sharing one’s story was often marked with fear,
shame, and feelings of isolation as participants com-
pared their own experiences to the apparent experi-
ences of others. As one participant put it, ‘If it hadn’t
have been pushed at me how happy you should be I
wouldn’t have felt so crappy about
that I
wasn’t there’ (PMH19).

the fact

Women described themselves as keeping it inside,
developing a mask, putting on a happy face, or putting
up a front rather than sharing their negative experi-
ences, because they feared the potential consequences
and judgement of others. Some worried that
they
would alienate family and friends or even that their
child might be taken into protective custody:

I decided not to share my deepest thoughts with others
because I was very embarrassed, but more than embar-
rassed, then, I was afraid . . . that my daughter would
be taken away . . . I was worried because of potential
repercussions on myself and my husband profession-
ally. If my daughter ended up needing to be in child
services or just having people know what’s going on in
our family base, we’re pretty private and just knowing
that this situation requires outside help, how is that
going to look and how is that going to have repercus-
(PMH 13)
sions on us as individuals and as a family?

Several participants described a highly competitive
culture of new motherhood and said they felt vulnera-
ble to judgement about the kind of parent they were.

The moms are nuts. Like other moms are horrible to
each other. . . And I’m like ‘Okay you have no idea
what anyone’s going through’. . . And I was like very
adamant . . . I’m not getting into play groups . . .I did
not want to be part of this mom-eat-mom world where,
you know, women can’t even be nice to each other but
(PMH19)
they’re going through the same thing.

Coming to terms with a new sense of self

Many of the women we interviewed talked about the
ways in which perinatal mental health issues and moth-
erhood had changed them. As one woman commented,
‘Although it’s wonderful bringing a new life and having
a new love,
it also is a loss of your former self’
(PMH15).

While this may be true of motherhood in general,
perinatal mental health issues involved a loss of partic-
ular personality traits which had previously been cen-
tral to some women’s sense of self. For example, one
woman felt she had lost her vitality and sociability:

That’s never happened to me, so it was very new. Like
this feeling of dread, no, that had never happened to
me. I’m somebody who’s full of life even if I have anxi-
ety, even if I’ve had terrible things happen to me. I get
through them. This was like everything shut down.
(PMH16)
Everything.

Another participant

felt

that, on account of her

experience, she had fundamentally changed:

I don’t know how I feel about the question of feeling
like myself again because I, I mean I’m always me but
I’m profoundly changed by both experiences, by having
a son and being a mother and by having had such sev-
ere depression where I had no desire to even get out
of bed. Those have profoundly affected me as a person
(PMH15)
and changed the way I look at things.

A third felt that she, too, had undergone profound
change but, ultimately, came to see this as an experi-
ence of personal growth:

I feel pretty good. I feel much, much better than I did.
Um I feel uh really very peaceful with everything I’ve
gone through. Um as difﬁcult as it was it’s made me
who I am and I like who I am. [laughs] I like me as a
person. [laugh]. . . I mean would I trade this for any-
thing? Yes, probably I wish I hadn’t gone through it. I
wish everything had been smooth sailing. But I also
feel I wouldn’t be the person I am had I not gone
(PMH03)
through it.

Finding solace in shared experience

While many of the women felt stigmatized, and feared
the consequences of disclosing their perinatal mental
health problems, some were able to share their experi-
ences with select family members or friends and, on
occasion, health care professionals. This sometimes
resulted in receiving direct support or helpful referrals
to groups or resources:

I was very lucky to fall on compassionate doctors, med-
ical professionals who helped me, who listened to me,
who understood me, who didn’t pathologize, over-
diagnose me, and over-medicate me. Who got the full
story assessed, were there to support and most impor-
tantly to give me accurate, reliable, recent research
(PMH16)
information. That was a godsend.

similar

I also went to a postpartum depression support group
and that group helped so much. I was there during the
thick of the postpartum depression. There were six of
us and we all had babies around the same age and we
were all going through very similar things. Even though
we had different lifestyles and different backgrounds
we were all feeling the same emotions . . . I think those
girls really saved my life many times . . . knowing that
there was no judgement there because when you’re
going through this you feel like everybody is judging
you.
(PMH18)
I saw this poster. . . for the ‘Not What I Expected Sup-
port Group’. . . One week we talked about how we deal
with distressed situations, you know, when things get
really bad and you feel like you’re at the edge . . . That
. . . was a very raw vulnerable kind of day for all of us
because that was the day that we all really opened up
to each other and told our stories. We talked about . . .
our darkest moments and what we did during those
darkest moments and how would we overcome them in
the future. . . It was a day of healing though I think for
all of us really because I think for most of us we hadn’t
told anybody else about all those times. We’d kept
them to ourselves and ﬁnally being able to open up
about them in a room where you weren’t judged,
it
(PMH20)
was good.

Several participants had initiated,

or become
involved in, online support groups or were inspired to
take on peer support roles as a result of their experi-
ence:

I feel a very interesting accountability to other women
to share my experience . . . This very tragic thing that
can happen to you can bond you with some of the most
inspiring strong women that you’ll probably meet in
your life . . . my role in that group is more so as, like, a
peer support for other women that are coming because
I’ve already been through, you know, the dark times,
and I’ve learned the skills that I need. I’ve been able
to act more as sort of like a mentor. . . I just don’t want
them to feel alone like I did, or not safe.
(PMH13)
It sounds clich(cid:2)e, but if I can help one woman under-
stand that what she is going through is maybe not nor-
mal by mental health standards, but it’s normal in the
sense that so many people experience it . . . If this
less alone . . . I just want to
could help women feel
raise awareness and I just want to lessen the stigma.
(PMH18)
And it’s become a real passion of mine.

DISCUSSION

Our results show the different roles that personal and
societal narratives play in shaping experiences and
ideas of self
in relation to perinatal mental health
issues. Across a variety of perinatal mental health prob-
lems, unrealistic and idealized cultural narratives about
pregnancy and motherhood shape experiences and
help-seeking behaviours. As previous
literature has
shown, stigma and fear of being perceived as a ‘bad’ or
‘failed’ mother discouraged women from disclosing
mental health problems and from seeking help (Baldis-
serotto et al. 2020; Forde et al. 2020; Moore et al.
2016). Similarly, women’s accounts of hiding their neg-
ative thoughts or emotions for fear of judgement, or of
negative ramiﬁcations, show how women internalize
the myth that an unhappy mother is a bad mother
(Johnston 2003). Staneva and Wigginton (2018) have
for new

The interviews we conducted revealed that mental
health issues contributed to the changes
in, and
losses of, their sense of identity that women experi-
enced through the transition to motherhood. Previous
work similarly shows that transitions to motherhood
and experiences of postpartum depression entail mul-
tiple forms of loss – of freedom and autonomy, of
one’s former self, and of certain relationships (Stone
& Kokanovic 2016; Vik & Hafting 2012; Yu & Bow-

Additionally, our study echoes literature that shows
how pressures to ﬁt the mould of the ‘good mother’
can result in self-silencing and in a denial of one’s
own needs (Lafrance & Stoppard 2006), while cul-
the ‘good mother’ and personal

narratives about one’s inadequacies as a parent, act,
in concert, to silence women who suffer from perina-

studies,
the women in our study experienced loss
and suffering but were wary of sharing their strug-
gles because of a perceived lack of support, both
from other parents as well as from healthcare profes-
sionals.

The relational perspective, brought forward in Mau-
thner’s (1998, 1999) work, further highlights how ﬁnd-
ing other women with whom one’s own experience
resonates, contributes to recovery. In our study, narra-
tive could also play a therapeutic role. Speciﬁcally,
exchanging stories with other mothers helped women
feel
less isolated and more validated. By speaking
openly about pregnancy, birth, and postpartum experi-
ences that deviate from socially prescribed norms,
women were able to question, and sometimes resist,
unattainable ideals of motherhood.

Our work thus suggests a need for resources and
support that encourage disclosing negative experiences
throughout the perinatal period and challenging the
myth of the ‘good mother’. Normalizing a wide range
of perinatal experiences and identities, in both clinical
and community settings, may reduce stigma around
perinatal mental health issues while also providing
opportunities for diagnosis and treatment. Previous
work has emphasized the value of peer support groups
in helping with feelings of social isolation and address-
ing the silent burden of living with postpartum depres-
sion (Montgomery et al. 2012). Scharp and Thomas
(2017) refer to the normalization of birth experiences
and the processes of seeking validation for one’s experi-
ences and reactions to motherhood, supportive commu-
nication,
and birth storytelling as motherwisdom.
Motherwisdom involves reclaiming the importance of
story and narrative in medicine and views sharing sto-
ries as therapeutic (Scharp & Thomas 2017). Research
on depression also suggests that recovery may involve
’breaking free’ from a former self and actively resisting
a ’good woman’ identity (Lafrance & Stoppard 2006).
Women suffering from perinatal mental health prob-
lems may similarly require tools and support in order
to resist norms of the ‘good mother’. Our work stresses
this need in relation to illnesses that occur at any time
from conception to one-year postpartum. A qualitative
meta-synthesis of experiences of using online forums
for maternal mental illness also shows that forums pro-
vide spaces where mothers can reconcile their mental
illness experiences with their identities as ‘good moth-
ers’. Posted experiences and anecdotes challenge domi-
nant narratives of ideal parenthood and show how good
parenting and mental
illness are reconcilable (Moore
et al. 2016, 2019).

Limitations

several

study has

limitations. First, existing
Our
research shows that factors such as income, race, and
education create additional structural barriers to per-
forming ideal motherhood (Keefe et al. 2018). Our
study was only able to consider the social determinants
that contribute to perinatal mental health problems
within a single sample. Second, while our recruitment
process aimed for maximum variation,
it was carried
in only two provinces and achieved a limited
out
degree of diversity in relation to socio-cultural back-
ground, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

Conclusions

In this study we considered the ways in which women
describe their perinatal mental health challenges, how
they coped, what worked for them, and how narratives
(both in the sharing of their personal experience and in
the receiving of others’ narratives) shape identity, feel-
ings of self-worth, and the capacity for self-care. We
identiﬁed four predominant themes in women’s narra-
tives of perinatal mental health issues: feeling like a
failed mother; societal silencing of negative experiences
of motherhood; coming to terms with a new sense of
self; and ﬁnding solace in shared experiences. These
ﬁndings are consistent with other studies that highlight
the personal challenges associated with perinatal men-
tal health issues, particularly the dread of associated
with social expectations of the ‘good mother’. We also
highlight the positive potential for healing and self-care
through shared experiences, and the power of narra-
tives to help shape feelings of self-worth and a new
identity. The personal journey that these women have
been on is indicative of both their resilience and the
need for improvements in awareness about, acceptance
of, and care for, women with perinatal mental health
issues.

RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE

This study provides further evidence of the need to
raise awareness and enhance communication skills
amongst healthcare professionals involved in perinatal
care,
teams,
including hospital maternity/obstetrical
public health and primary care teams, midwives and
other generalist and specialist personnel. Knowing
when and how to provide timely information is critical
to support women experiencing perinatal mental health
problems. The provision of information about mental

health issues and effective therapies should be rou-
tinely adopted throughout
the perinatal period to
reduce stigma and create a safe space for women to
talk about their experiences. Those directly involved in
leading prenatal classes, for instance, could consistently
raise the topic of perinatal mental health with a view to
normalizing experiences that are relatively common,
yet remain hidden. In addition to normalizing a range
of experiences, enabling women to, more readily, rec-
ognize behaviours, and symptoms that may represent
an underlying psychiatric disorder and feel comfortable
seeking help, would be desirable.

ETHICS APPROVAL

Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the
St. Mary’s Hospital Research Ethics Committee,
SMRC-REC #11-22E. Written consent was obtained
from all study participants by the study team to con-
duct qualitative interviews about their experiences of
mental health and pregnancy, and for future use of this
data, including the production of online material and
future secondary analysis.

PATIENT CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION

Written consent was obtained from all participants in
this study as described above and in the text of the
manuscript. We used a two-step consent process. Par-
inter-
ticipants ﬁrst provided consent to the original
view. They then provided a second consent
(after
review of their transcript) to permit use of the inter-
view materials for future research (including secondary
analysis), in publications, for teaching purposes and for
online materials with video/audio excerpts at www.hea
lthexperiences.ca.

After their interview and prior to giving secondary
consent, participants were sent the transcript for review
with a request to remove any material they did not wish
the research team to use. They were given the option of
using an alias or their real name in this work. Prior to
release of the short ﬁlm online, all participants were
provided an opportunity to review their excerpts and
the ﬁlm and to provide feedback or request the removal
of their material. Following the launch of the online
material, participants could request the removal of their
information at any time. This is the standard approach
adopted for the international network of research teams
known as DIPEx International of which our Canadian
team is a part. See: www.dipexinternational.org.
