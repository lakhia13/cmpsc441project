Abstract

BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments are core characteristics of 
psychotic disorders, which are present in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) and strongly predict 
poor social functioning. Addressing cognitive impairments through cognitive training and 
remediation (CTR) may be a crucial component of recovery-oriented treatment.

AIMS: The objectives of this review were to (1) evaluate the CTR theoretical basis and 
intervention components and (2) examine the effects of CTR on cognition and social functioning 
in FEP.

METHOD: A combined search of Ovid Medline, Embase, and Psych Info databases was 
conducted using keywords. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses guidelines were followed. Quality and risk of bias were assessed using established 
instruments.

RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials were included in this review and had an overall fair 
to poor quality. CTR interventions in FEP utilize a range of theoretical backgrounds, with most 
including a focus on higher order cognitive processes. Varied doses and intervention components 
are used. All but one study found improvements in at least one cognitive domain. Global 
cognition, verbal learning, and memory and executive function were most commonly improved. 
Three studies found an effect on a range of functional outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of CTR interventions have promising effects for addressing 
cognitive impairments in FEP. Evidence of functional impact is less consistent. Further research is

Introduction

A first episode of psychosis (FEP) occurs in 100,000 adolescents and young adults annually 
in the United States (National Institute of Mental Health, n.d.; Simon et al., 2017). Psychotic 
disorders, such as schizophrenia, are associated with devastating disability in social 
functioning, defined as attainment of education, employment, and meaningful social 
relationships (Bromley & Brekke, 2010; Desai, Lawson, Barner, & Rascati, 2013; Wiersma 
et al., 2000). This disability places a significant burden on affected individuals, caregivers, 
and society. In 2013, the national cost of schizophrenia was $155 billion, and nearly 75% of 
this cost was attributable to patients’ unemployment and caregivers’ lost productivity 
(Cloutier et al., 2016). Disability in social functioning is evident in the early stages of illness 
and is often not recovered with psychosis symptom remission (Henry et al., 2010; Norman et 
al., 2018). The FEP period, encompassing the first 5 years after the onset of psychosis, 
represents a critical treatment opportunity to alter an individual’s functional trajectory 
(Birchwood, Todd, & Jackson, 1998; Crumlish et al., 2009; Norman et al., 2018). As a 
result, FEP specialty programs have grown substantially in recent years. However, such 
programs have failed to result in robust long-term improvements in social functioning 
(Bertelsen et al., 2008; Norman et al., 2018; Secher et al., 2015), suggesting that a critical 
treatment target may be missing.

Cognitive impairments are a core characteristic of psychotic disorders that are present before 
psychosis symptom onset and persist throughout the course of illness (Addington, Saeedi, & 
Addington, 2005; Bora & Murray, 2014; Mesholam-Gately, Giuliano, Goff, Faraone, & 
Seidman, 2009). These impairments include both neurocognitive deficits (i.e., the domains 
of verbal learning and memory, executive functions, and attention) and social cognitive 
deficits, which refer to the processing and interpretation of social information, including 
emotion perception, inferring the mental states of others, and reading social cues (Fett et al., 
2011). Both neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments have been strongly linked to 
poor social functioning in individuals with psychosis. Neurocognitive impairments have 
been found to account for up to 20% to 60% of the variance in functional outcomes 
(Fervaha, Foussias, Agid, & Remington, 2014; Fett et al., 2011; Green, Kern, Braff, & 
Mintz, 2000; Lepage, Bodnar, & Bowie, 2014; Najas-Garcia, Gómez-Benito, & Huedo-
Medina, 2018). Social cognitive impairments are related to but distinct from neurocognitive 
impairments and may be more strongly linked to community functioning (Fett et al., 2011; 
Schmidt, Mueller, & Roder, 2011). Together, these impairments contribute more to 
functional decline than any other symptom domain (Fervaha et al., 2014; Fett et al., 2011; 
Lepage et al., 2014), and are one of the few consistent predictors of poor social functioning 
trajectories in FEP (Santesteban-Echarri et al., 2017).

As a result, remediating cognitive deficits may be a critical component of early intervention 
services. A large body of literature in chronic psychotic disorders suggests that cognitive 
training and remediation (CTR) interventions are effective at improving both cognitive and 
functional outcomes (Wykes, Huddy, Cellard, McGurk, & Czobor, 2011). A 2015 meta-
analysis of CTR in early psychosis found small to moderate effects on cognition and 
functioning (Revell, Neill, Harte, Khan, & Drake, 2015). However, this analysis included 
patients who were high risk but had not yet developed a psychotic disorder, and due to its 
quantitative aims, was unable to provide a detailed analysis of the CTR theoretical basis and 
intervention components, which vary substantially between studies and may affect results. 
The current review sought to provide an updated narrative synthesis of the CTR literature in 
FEP. The objectives of this review were to (1) evaluate the theoretical basis and intervention 
components of CTR in FEP and (2) examine the effects of CTR on cognition and social 
functioning in FEP.

Method

Search Strategy

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were 
followed for the literature search and study selection (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 
2009). The search protocol included establishing eligibility criteria, an initial database 
search, abstract screening, full text review, and review of reference lists. A search strategy 
was developed as follows: ((early or first episode) AND (schiz* OR psychosis OR 
psychotic) AND cognit* AND (remediation OR rehabilit* OR train*)). The search was 
conducted as a multiplacement keyword search (searching the title, abstract, keyword, and 
subject heading fields) in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO, all via the Ovid interface. 
Results were limited to journal articles only (i.e., conference abstracts were excluded). No 
other language or date limits were applied in the search. The search strategy can also be 
found in Supplemental Table 1, available online.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: were a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT), tested a CTR intervention, included an FEP population, and reported 
on cognitive or functional outcomes. Studies were excluded if the sample included a 
nonpsychotic disorder diagnostic group (i.e., high risk for psychosis or nonpsychotic 
depression), were follow-up reports or secondary analysis from another study, or were 
conference abstracts only.

Data Extraction

A data extraction form was created to include relevant data from each study, including study 
identification (title, authors, and publication year), sample characteristics (sample size, 
gender, age, education level, and baseline symptoms), study characteristics (design, blinding, 
intervention description, treatment context, dose, and duration of CTR), main findings, and 
the risk of bias and quality assessment ratings.

Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

Each study was appraised by one reviewer for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials (Higgins & Green, 2011). This tool consists of seven 
categories of potential bias, and each category was rated low, high, or unclear risk of bias 
(Table 1). Study quality was appraised using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
(NHLBI) Quality Assessment of Controlled Intervention Studies tool (NHLBI, n.d.). This 
tool includes 14 criteria that may affect study quality. Overall quality for each study was 
rated as good, fair, or poor based on the criteria and guidelines in the NHLBI tool (Table 1).

Results

Study Selection

The initial database search returned 343 reports from Ovid Medline, 372 reports from 
PsychINFO, and 371 reports from Embase for a total of 1,086 reports. After removing 
duplicates, 409 studies were identified. Initial abstract review excluded 379 studies for 
failing to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the remaining 30 studies, five were 
excluded in full text review for not having an RCT design, three for including a non-
psychotic diagnostic group in the sample, six for being follow up data from a primary report, 
four for lack of relevant outcomes reported, one for being a conference abstract, and one for 
not including a CTR intervention. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for this review 
(Figure 1).

Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

Table 1 details the risk of bias and quality assessment results. Areas of high or unclear risk 
of bias included blinding of outcome assessors (Eack et al., 2009; Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 
2015; Mendella et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Ventura et al., 2017) and incomplete 
outcome reporting (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Mendella et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 
2004; Ventura et al., 2017). Four studies received a poor quality rating (Fernandez-Gonzalo 
et al., 2015; Mendella et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Ventura et al., 2017), four 
received a fair quality rating (Drake et al., 2014; Eack et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2015; Puig 
et al., 2014), and two received a good quality rating (Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; 
Wykes et al., 2007). Poor quality was largely due to a combination of insufficient or unclear 
blinding of outcome assessors (Eack et al., 2009; Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Mendella 
et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Ventura et al., 2017), high or unreported overall attrition 
(Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Ventura et al., 2017), and failing to 
include a power calcuation or use intent to treat analysis (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; 
Mendella et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Ventura et al., 2017).

Study Characteristics

Sample.—Sample characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Studies were conducted in the 
United States (n = 3), the United Kingdom (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), Denmark (n = 1), Canada 
(n = 1), and Norway (n = 1). Sample sizes ranged from 26 (Ueland & Rund, 2004) to 117 
participants (Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014). The mean age ranged from 15 (Ueland & 
Rund, 2004) to 30 years (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015). All studies had more male than

female participants. Three studies reported race data, with one including 50% non-White 
participants (Ventura et al., 2017) and two including a majority of White participants (Drake 
et al., 2014; Eack et al., 2009). Participants had mild psychosis symptoms in all studies 
except one, where symptoms were moderate to marked (Ueland & Rund, 2004).

Treatment Context.

Five studies occurred within an FEP specialty service (Drake et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2015; 
Mendella et al., 2015; Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; Ventura et al., 2017), and two 
additional studies described services similar to an FEP specialty services and are considered 
“FEP-like” (Eack et al., 2009; Puig et al., 2014). One study occurred in an inpatient setting 
(Ueland & Rund, 2004) and two were unspecified (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Wykes 
et al., 2007; Table 2).

Intervention.

Intervention characteristics are detailed in Table 2, and a detailed description of each 
intervention is provided in Table 3.

Theoretical basis.

CTR interventions fall into two primary theoretical categories: “top-down” or broad 
neuropsychological rehabilitation approaches and “bottom-up” or targeted cognitive training 
approaches (Fisher, Herman, Stephens, & Vinogradov, 2016; Nuechterlein et al., 2014). The 
broad CTR approaches draw from fields of neuropsychology and educational psychology 
and focus on the higher order cognitive processes of memory, reasoning, executive 
functioning, and social cognition (Nuechterlein et al., 2014; Wykes & Reeder, 2005). The 
targeted cognitive training approach is rooted in neuroplasticity and cognitive neuroscience 
research and focuses on perceptual information and sensory processing. Training typically 
focuses on improving accuracy and efficiency of auditory and visual information processing, 
and then builds on the perceptual domain with more complex cognitive tasks in that domain 
(Nuechterlein et al., 2014; Vinogradov, Fisher, & De Villers-Sidani, 2012).

Six of the 10 studies used broad interventions (Drake et al., 2014; Eack et al., 2009; 
Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; Puig et al., 2014; 
Wykes et al., 2007), and two broad interventions also incorporated social cognition training 
(Eack et al., 2009; Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015); however, the specific cognitive domains 
trained varied between studies (Table 3). One study used a purely targeted training approach 
of auditory information processing and verbal working memory (Fisher et al., 2015). Two 
used a hybrid intervention that combined targeted and broad components, with one focusing 
on visual information processing for the targeted training (Ventura et al., 2017) and one 
using a cognitive differentiation module to “improve basic cognitive skills” prior to 
advancing to complex tasks of memory and social perception (Ueland & Rund, 2004). One 
study used a compensatory training-only approach (Mendella et al., 2015), in which 
strategies to work around cognitive deficits were used, as opposed to training these domains 
directly.

Dosing and delivery.

Page 6

There was a high degree of heterogeneity in intervention dosing and duration. Dosing ranged 
from 24 hours (Mendella et al., 2015) to 127.5 hours (Eack et al., 2009) and from a duration 
of 8 weeks (Fisher et al., 2015) to 2 years (Eack et al., 2009). Most studies (n = 7/10) dosed 
the intervention between 30 and 40 hours, however, one study had 24 hours (Mendella et al., 
2015) and two studies had over 100 hours of CTR (Eack et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2017). 
Training typically occurred for 1 hour per session. Frequency of CTR varied from one 
(Mendella et al., 2015) to five times per week (Fisher et al., 2015).

Five interventions were delivered by a therapist on a one-to-one basis (Drake et al., 2014; 
Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; Puig et al., 2014; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Wykes et al., 
2007), one was delivered in a therapist led group (Mendella et al., 2015), one was self-
delivered by participants at home without therapist involvement (Fisher et al., 2015), one 
was delivered in small groups with each participant training individually and a therapist 
present (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015), and two used a combination of small groups with 
a therapist and larger therapist-lead groups (Eack et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2017).

Adherence.

Three studies reported adherence data. There was a completion of 32.9 (SD = 10.5) hours of 
40 hours in Fisher et al. (2015), 28.7 hours (SD = 11.2) of 32 hours in Østergaard 
Christensen et al. (2014), and 30.7 (SD = 8.8) of 32 to 40 hours in Fernandez-Gonzalo et al. 
(2015).

Effects of CTR on Cognitive and Functional Outcomes

Cognition.—All studies except Ventura et al. (2017) reported on cognitive outcomes. A 
wide range of cognitive improvements were found across the studies, with eight of nine 
studies finding improved cognition in at least one domain. Ueland and Rund (2004) found 
no effect on any cognitive outcomes and was the only study to occur in an inpatient setting, 
had the smallest sample size, and was rated low quality. Global cognition, verbal learning 
and memory, and executive functioning were most commonly improved.

Global cognition.—Seven studies reported on global cognition, with four studies finding 
an effect in the moderate (Eack et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2015) to large (Mendella et al., 
2015; Puig et al., 2014) range and three failing to find an effect (Drake et al., 2014; 
Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; Ueland & Rund, 2004). Each study finding an effect 
was from a different theoretical base, with a dosing range from 24 to 127.5 hours. One study 
finding a large effect received a poor quality rating (Mendella et al., 2015). All of the 
interventions finding no effect on global cognition were broad interventions and each had a 
different quality rating.

Verbal learning and memory.—Seven studies reported on verbal learning and memory, 
with four finding a signficant effect (Eack et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2015; Østergaard 
Christensen et al., 2014; Puig et al., 2014) and three finding no effect (Fernandez-Gonzalo et 
al., 2015; Mendella et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004). There was a wide range of 
theoretical base and dosing represented in both the group of studies that found an effect and

the group that did not. All studies failing to find an effect were rated poor quality and two 
had the smallest sample sizes of all studies (Mendella et al., 2015; Ueland & Rund, 2004).

Executive functioning.—Nine studies reported on executive functioning, with five 
finding a significant effect (Drake et al., 2014; Eack et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2015; Puig et 
al., 2014; Wykes et al., 2007) and four finding no effect (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; 
Mendella et al., 2015; Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; Ueland & Rund, 2004). Studies 
finding an effect had a dose of at least 40 hours, while those failing to find an effect tended 
to have a dose of 32 hours or less of CTR. Theoretical basis and delivery were varied in both 
the group of studies that found an effect and the group that did not. Most studies failing to 
find an effect were poor quality (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Mendella et al., 2015; 
Ueland & Rund, 2004), whereas no studies finding an effect were poor quality.

Social cognition.—Three studies targeted social cognition with two showing large effects 
in varied social cognitive domains (Eack et al., 2009; Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015) and 
one showing no effect (Ueland & Rund, 2004).

Durability of cognitive effects.—Four studies included a follow up assessment ranging 
from 3 to 12 months post-treatment. Cognitive effects were durable in three studies in at 
least one domain (Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; Puig et al., 2014; Wykes et al., 2007). 
The study failing to show durability had a very high rate of attrition at follow-up (Drake et 
al., 2014). All studies assessing durability used a broad CTR, delivered one-to-one, and a 
dose of between 32 and 40 hours.

Social Functioning.—All studies assessed a range of functional outcomes, and the 
majority failed to find differences between CTR and control groups (Drake et al., 2014; 
Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2015; Fisher et al., 2015; Mendella et al., 2015; Østergaard 
Christensen et al., 2014; Ueland & Rund, 2004; Wykes et al., 2007). Three studies found an 
effect on functioning, including engaging in social relationships and work attainment (Eack 
et al., 2009), participation in meaningful activities and platonic and romantic relationships 
(Ventura et al., 2017), and overall functioning from communication to daily living skills 
(Puig et al., 2014). All studies finding functional improvement included some degree of 
broad CTR, occurred in an FEP or FEP-like treatment context, and incorporated one-to-one 
coaching as part of the delivery method. Two also incorporated group delivery and had the 
largest doses of training (Eack et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2017). One included a bridging 
group to practice applying cognitive skills to real-world situations (Ventura et al., 2017). 
Functional improvements were observed more often in studies lacking blinded outcome 
assessors (Eack et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2017). One additional study failed to find group 
effects in functional outcomes; however, it was found that improved cognition in any domain 
was associated with improved social behavior (Wykes et al., 2007). Four studies included a 
follow-up assessment of functioning (Drake et al., 2014; Østergaard Christensen et al., 2014; 
Puig et al., 2014; Wykes et al., 2007), and none found an effect on functioning at this time 
point.

Discussion

Page 8

The findings from this review indicate that CTR interventions incorporating a broad 
theoretical approach are most commonly studied in the FEP population, and due to a limited 
number of studies from a targeted theoretical approach, the relative efficacy of each 
approach cannot be determined. The majority of studies dosed CTR between 32 and 40 
hours, which appears to be sufficient to induce cognitive improvements. Overall, findings 
support CTR’s efficacy for improving cognition in individuals with FEP in a manner that 
may persist after intervention completion, with common improvements in global cognition, 
verbal learning and memory, executive functioning, and social cognition. However, the 
evidence for an effect on social functioning is mixed. These results must be considered in 
the context of the overall fair quality of included studies, with several risks of bias due to 
insufficient blinding of participants and outcome assessors, high rates of attrition, lack of 
adherence reporting, and insufficient use of power and intent to treat analysis. In addition, 
interpretations of the results are limited by the high degree of heterogeneity in CTR 
intervention components, dosing and delivery, and by the variety of instruments used for 
cognitive and functional assessment, which presented barriers to comparing results across 
studies.

The results from this review highlight the tremendous variability in CTR theoretical 
approaches and intervention components used in FEP. Across just 10 studies, four different 
theoretical approaches were identified, and further variability exists within each approach 
related to the specific cognitive domains trained. The two dominant theoretical paradigms, 
broad versus targeted CTR, each have particular strengths, which may be expected to lead to 
different patterns of results. For example, broad CTR approaches are based upon evidence 
that it is possible to improve higher order cognition by explicitly training these domains 
(Nuechterlein et al., 2014; Wykes & Reeder, 2005). These programs typically strive for 
transfer of cognitive skills to tasks important for everyday living, and many teach strategies 
to more efficiently learn cognitive skills (Nuechterlein et al., 2014). However, broad CTR 
lacks a focus on improving perceptual and sensory information processing, which is known 
to be impaired in psychotic disorders in a manner that affects effective higher order cognitive 
processing (Javitt, 2009; Silverstein & Keane, 2011; Vinogradov et al., 2012). In contrast, 
the targeted cognitive training approach emphasizes that successful CTR must start by 
improving the efficiency and accuracy of information processing at the sensory and 
perceptual phase of the information processing pathway before building to more complex 
cognitive tasks (Nahum, Lee, & Merzenich, 2013; Vinogradov et al., 2012). This approach 
recognizes that psychotic disorders are characterized by impairments in neural systems 
distributed throughout the brain, versus discrete impairments in neurocognitive domains, and 
that these distributed systems must interact together to process sensory information 
(Vinogradov et al., 2012). Targeted approaches emphasize massed practice in one cognitive 
domain to promote neuroplasticity and are designed to leverage implicit learning 
mechanisms by gradually adapting in difficulty level (Fisher et al., 2016). Due to the 
variability in intervention design and treatment targets arising from the theoretical basis, it is 
difficult to combine results of the varied CTR interventions for meta-analytic study. There is 
a need for a greater volume of research on each approach so that comparative effectiveness

analyses can be completed. Until then, it is difficult to compare the efficacy of CTR 
interventions in FEP given the heterogeneity of interventions from and within different 
theoretical approaches.

While there was a high degree of heterogeneity in cognitive domains improved across 
studies, the results from this review paint an overall optimistic picture of the ability to 
improve cognitive impairments in FEP with CTR regardless of theoretical basis. Common 
cognitive improvements were observed in global cognition, verbal learning and memory, and 
executive functioning. Improvements in verbal learning and memory may be especially 
promising, as this has been found to be the most impaired cognitive domain in FEP (Aas et 
al., 2014; Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009). Given the broad range of cognitive improvements, 
it is difficult to determine whether patient characteristics or the theoretical basis, dosing or 
delivery of the intervention affected cognitive results. Our findings suggest that 32 to 40 
hours of training are sufficient to induce at least moderate cognitive changes, regardless of 
how the doses were distributed (i.e., 2 vs. 5 months). It may be that the effective dose is 
domain-specific, as improvements in executive functioning were more common with doses 
of at least 40 hours versus 32 hours or less. However, in the absence of adherence data the 
exact training threshold needed to produce cognitive gains is unknown.

The only study to find no cognitive effect was conducted in an inpatient setting with 
participants who had elevated psychotic symptoms (Ueland & Rund, 2004), suggesting that 
the optimal window for CTR may require psychosis symptoms to be well controlled. 
However, the null results may also be attributed to the small sample size. Indeed, several 
studies in this review may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups 
(Lewandowski, 2016). Alternatively, the null results of this study could be related to the 
adolescent age-group of participants, which represented the youngest mean age of all 
studies. It has been shown that earlier onset of psychosis in the adolescent years is associated 
with more severe symptoms and worse treatment outcomes, which may have reduced the 
responsiveness to CTR interventions (Vyas, Kumra, & Puri, 2010). However, adolescence 
may also be a time of heightened neuroplasticity, allowing for greater gains from CTR 
interventions (Fuhrmann, Knoll, & Blakemore, 2015; Vyas et al., 2010). Another study also 
included an adolescent sample (Puig et al., 2014) and this study found improvements in 
cognition and functioning, suggesting that CTR can be effective for adolescents as well as 
young adults with FEP. This is consistent with a null finding of a moderating effect of age on 
CTR outcomes in FEP found in a recent meta-analysis (Revell et al., 2015). As only three 
studies reported race demographics of their participants (Drake et al., 2014; Eack et al., 
2009; Ventura et al., 2017), with only one including a racially diverse sample (Ventura et al., 
2017), the generalization of outcomes to diverse populations representative of those affected 
by FEP is limited.

The case for CTR to improve the social functioning of individuals in the FEP period is 
developing but is less robust. The lack of far transfer effects from cognitive gains to 
improved everyday functioning is likely attributable to several factors, including an 
incomplete understanding of the cognitive, behavioral and neural targets of social 
functioning, potentially insufficient dosing, lack of concurrent psychiatric rehabilitation 
interventions, limitations of assessing only group effects, lack of post-trial follow-up

periods, and inconsistent operationalization of social functioning. As all studies finding 
functional improvement used some degree of broad CTR, it may be that training of higher 
order cognitive processes, such as reasoning and executive functions, is needed in order to 
transfer cognitive skills to improved daily functioning (Wykes & Reeder, 2005). However, 
the necessary cognitive domains that must improve to drive improved functioning cannot be 
determined from this review due to the varied cognitive improvements across studies.

Previous research has indicated that changes in verbal learning, executive functioning, and 
social cognition may contribute most to improved functioning after CTR in FEP, suggesting 
that targeting these domains holds the greatest promise for restoring functioning (Eack, 
Pogue-Geile, Greenwald, Hogarty, & Keshavan, 2011). Social cognition may be a critical 
treatment target as it is more strongly linked to social functioning than neurocognition (Fett 
et al., 2011). In addition, impairments in social cognition may be linked to poor motivation, 
which has additional impact on functioning (Gard, Fisher, Garrett, Genevsky, & Vinogradov, 
2009; Najas-Garcia et al., 2018). Early evidence suggests that social cognition training may 
lead to improved reward processing related to motivation in schizophrenia (Fisher et al., 
2017). Thus, CTR interventions that combine neurocognitive and social cognitive training 
may be capable of improving functioning through three pathways—neurocognition, social 
cognition, and motivation—which all have unique contributions to functional outcome 
(Fisher et al., 2017; Najas-Garcia et al., 2018); however, more research is needed to test this 
hypothesis.

The effects of combined interventions on social functioning should also be explored. For 
example, meta-cognition, or the ability to form an integrated and complex understanding of 
the self and others, has been associated with social functioning and insight in psychotic 
disorders (Lysaker et al., 2019). No studies in this review incorporated metacognitive 
approaches, and addressing metacognition may lead to improved insight into cognitive 
impairments and treatment needs, thus promoting engagement in CTR interventions (Vohs et 
al., 2018). Finally, little is known about the neural mechanisms supporting social functioning 
in FEP. A recent meta-analysis points to a link between whole brain volume and structural 
and functional integrity of fronto-limbic brain areas and functional outcome in schizophrenia 
(Wojtalik, Smith, Keshavan, & Eack, 2018). However, little is known about such 
relationships in FEP, and importantly, no studies in FEP have investigated whether these 
areas are malleable in response to CTR in a manner that is associated with improvements in 
social functioning.

Two studies finding functional improvement were unique in their intensive dosing and long 
treatment periods (Eack et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2017). These studies also included a high 
degree of social contact with peers and therapists, and one included a bridging group to 
apply cognitive skills to real-world situations (Ventura et al., 2017). Thus, it is difficult to 
ascertain whether the high dose of CTR or the nonspecific effects of these intervention 
components contributes most to functional improvement (Fisher et al., 2016). A recent 
secondary analysis found that among the “active ingredients” of a CTR intervention, only 
therapeutic alliance was associated with improvements in social functioning (Cella & 
Wykes, 2019). Thus, it is possible that the intensive nature of Eack et al (2009) and Ventura 
et al. (2017) facilitated a stronger therapeutic alliance, which translated to improved

functioning. The Cella and Wykes (2019) findings may have important implications for the 
design of CTR interventions if the ultimate goal is to improve individuals’ everyday 
functioning; however, resource- and time-intensive interventions may come at the expense of 
limited scalability and practicality in real world settings.

The treatment context in which functional gains occur following CTR has clinical relevance, 
as FEP specialty services share a goal of functional recovery. The lack of cognitive 
interventions included in such services has been suggested as a contributor to suboptimal 
results (Breitborde, Moe, Ered, Ellman, & Bell, 2017). This review found mixed evidence 
that addition of CTR to early intervention services improves functional outcomes, 
warranting further research. Research in chronic schizophrenia has found that functional 
gains are largest when CTR is provided in the context of psychiatric rehabilitation programs, 
such as those explicitly targeting vocational rehabilitation (Wykes et al., 2011). No studies in 
this review provided such services.

Finally, lack of consensus for best practices in measurement of social functioning in FEP 
complicates evaluation of far transfer effects from cognitive gains to improved functioning. 
Due to the complex nature of social functioning, such improvements likely should not be 
expected immediately after CTR (Fisher et al., 2016). The optimal length of follow-up 
needed to accurately assess gains in functioning is not known; however, the low number of 
studies including a follow-up assessment may have contributed to negative results. Due to 
the heterogeneity of cognitive impairments in FEP, assessing individual differences, that is, 
whether improvements in cognition are associated with improvements in social functioning
—as opposed to only group differences in social functioning—may also be needed to assess 
the effects of CTR on functional outcomes.

Strengths and Limitations

This is the first known review of CTR in FEP to incorporate a descriptive analysis of the 
theoretical basis, intervention components, and treatment context of included studies and to 
select a homogeneous FEP sample. This review is limited by searching only major databases 
and performing the quality assessment with only one reviewer. Limiting the search to major 
databases may prevent inclusion of negative studies published in the grey literature, resulting 
in biased conclusions. The lack of two reviewers for the quality and risk of bias assessments 
may result in a biased assessment of study quality, and thus these results should be 
interpreted with caution. The authors minimized this bias by utilizing well-validated quality 
and risk of bias assessment tools.

A broad range of CTR interventions are promising for improving cognitive impairment in 
FEP, but their effects on social functioning are mixed. Broad and targeted CTR likely affect 
cognition and social functioning via different pathways. The wide heterogeneity of CTR 
intervention components, coupled with limitations of overall study quality, presents barriers 
to identifying which particular CTR protocols may be most useful in clinical practice. 
However, when considered together with meta-analyses demonstrating efficacy of CTR for a 
range of cognitive outcomes in both FEP and chronic schizophrenia (Revell et al., 2015;

Wykes et al., 2011), results from this review suggest that CTR, regardless of theoretical 
background, may be beneficial for improving cognition in FEP. Future studies must continue 
to identify the necessary treatment targets, intervention components, and doses needed to 
drive robust and durable improvements in cognition and functioning. Together, these 
research initiatives hold promise for filling a critical treatment gap in early psychosis.
