Abstract

Background:  Mobile apps may offer a valuable platform for delivering evidence-based psychological interventions for individuals
with atypical appearances, or visible differences, who experience psychosocial appearance concerns such as appearance-based
social anxiety and body dissatisfaction. Before this study, researchers and stakeholders collaboratively designed an app prototype
based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), an evidence-based form of cognitive behavioral therapy that uses strategies
such as mindfulness, clarification of personal values, and value-based goal setting. The intervention also included social skills
training,  an  established  approach  for  increasing  individuals’ confidence  in  managing  social  interactions,  which  evoke
appearance-based anxiety for many.

Objective:  In this study, the authors aim to evaluate the feasibility of an ACT-based app prototype via the primary objectives
of user engagement and acceptability and the secondary feasibility objective of clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness.

Methods:  To address the feasibility objectives, the authors used a single-group intervention design with mixed methods in a
group of 36 participants who have a range of visible differences. The authors collected quantitative data via measures of program
use, satisfaction ratings, and changes over 3 time points spanning 12 weeks in outcomes, including selected ACT process measures
(experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and valued action), scales of appearance concerns (appearance-based life disengagement,
appearance-fixing behaviors, appearance self-evaluation, and fear of negative appearance evaluation), and clinical well-being
(depression and anxiety). Semistructured exit interviews with a subsample of 12 participants provided qualitative data to give a
more in-depth understanding of participants’ views and experiences of the program.

Results:  In terms of user engagement, adherence rates over 6 sessions aligned with the upper boundary of those reported across
mobile mental health apps, with over one-third of participants completing all sessions over 12 weeks, during which a steady
decline in adherence was observed. Time spent on sessions matched design intentions, and engagement frequencies highlighted
semiregular mindfulness practice, mixed use of value-based goal setting, and high engagement with social skills training. The
findings indicate a good overall level of program acceptability via satisfaction ratings, and qualitative interview findings offer
positive feedback as well as valuable directions for revisions. Overall, testing for clinical safety and potential effectiveness showed
encouraging changes over time, including favorable changes in appearance-related life disengagement, appearance-fixing behaviors,
and selected ACT measures. No iatrogenic effects were indicated for depression or anxiety.

Introduction

Background
Visible  difference  refers  to  an  unusual  physical  appearance
caused by a congenital or acquired health condition, injury, or
medical intervention [1]. Between visible skin conditions such
as  psoriasis  and  eczema,  scarring  from  trauma  or  surgery,
craniofacial conditions such as cleft lip and/or palate, and many
other causes, approximately 1 in 60 people are estimated to live
with  a  visible  difference  [2].  In  the  context  of  heightened
conspicuousness  and  common  reports  of  negative  social
reactions [3], there is a marked prevalence of appearance-related
distress, most commonly in the form of anxiety (particularly
social  anxiety,  marked  by  a  fear  of  negative  appearance
evaluation  and  social  withdrawal),  depression,  and  body
dissatisfaction, across a range of appearance-affecting conditions
[4-6]. Although many adjust well to having a visible difference,
samples of individuals with visible differences commonly show
significantly  higher  rates  of  appearance-based  anxiety  and
depression  across  cultures  (eg,  in  adults  with  acne  [7]  and
alopecia  [8])  when  compared  with  matched  controls.  With
minimal specialist psychological provision available (eg, across
Europe [9]), the development and testing of specialist self-help
interventions  are  warranted.  Indeed,  existing  self-help  shows
promise in addressing appearance concerns for this population
[10].

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Visible
Differences
Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  offers  a  novel
approach  to  the  population  with  visible  differences,  with
traditional cognitive behavioral therapy having dominated the
research  field  to  date  [11].  ACT  is  a  third-wave  cognitive
behavioral  therapy  in  which  psychological  flexibility  is
cultivated,  namely,  the  capacity  to  hold  present  moment
awareness and acceptance of one’s internal experiences while
acting  in  ways  aligned  to  one’s  personal  values  [12].  The
psychological flexibility model holds conceptual promise for
addressing appearance concerns in this group, for some of whom
thoughts such as “I look strange” or “People will stare” represent
a degree of objective reality, therefore being less amenable to
the  thought  challenging  approaches  adopted  in  traditional
cognitive behavioral therapy. In ACT, individuals learn to accept
the presence of such unwanted thoughts and associated emotions
while also detaching from their literality through an awareness
of thoughts as an ongoing internal process rather than focusing
on  their  content  (via  cognitive  defusion).  Concurrently,
individuals clarify their personal values as guides for ongoing
purposeful  behavior.  These  values  are  qualities  of  behavior,
namely,  a  quality  that  can  be  enacted,  such  as  skillfulness,

honesty, and intimacy. Present moment acceptance and cognitive
defusion  are  cultivated  in  ACT  primarily  as  a  means  of
facilitating  a  commitment  to  value-consistent  activity.  In
combination, ACT may offer a pragmatic therapeutic approach
for this population [13].

In a cross-sectional study involving individuals with a range of
visible differences, researchers [14] drew from an established
model of body image coping strategies [15] to investigate the
role of 2 key psychological flexibility subprocesses in relation
to  appearance-related  outcomes.  The  authors  found  that
cognitive  fusion  (taking  thoughts  as  factual  statements  to  be
acted  on)  mediated  the  relationship  between  appearance
evaluation  and  2  unhelpful  coping  strategies  in  the  form  of
appearance-related  life  disengagement  (physically  avoiding
situations 
and
appearance-fixing  behaviors  (eg,  compulsive  concealment  of
the  visible  difference).  They  also  found  that  experiential
avoidance (an unwillingness to remain in contact with unwanted
internal experiences) partially mediated disengagement but not
appearance-fixing  behaviors.  Cognitive  fusion,  experiential
avoidance, and reduced committed action were also found to
correlate with appearance anxiety in patients with burn scarring
[16].

Recent trials offer some evidence for the efficacy of book-based
ACT  self-help  in  related  clinical  areas  of  social  anxiety  [17]
and body dissatisfaction in the general population [18]. These
interventions that are based on evidence-based ACT protocols
[19,20]  offer  a  valuable  starting  point  for  developing  ACT
programs  for  individuals  with  visible  differences.  However,
modification is needed both from social anxiety interventions
(eg,  acknowledging  that  individuals  with  visible  differences
may  encounter  initial  negative  reactions  to  their  appearance
from  others)  and  body  dissatisfaction  protocols,  which
predominantly focus on shape and weight rather than unusual
appearance.  To

Mobile Delivery
Mobile  apps  offer  a  unique  level  of  user  functionality  to
facilitate everyday skills training and self-monitoring in self-help
programs [21]. Real-time tailored feedback can reinforce target
behaviors [22], which, for individuals with a visible difference,
could  include  the  practice  of  social  skills  training  (an
evidence-based component to help individuals manage difficult
social  encounters  [23]),  tailored  mindfulness  practices,  and
valued goals related to appearance concerns. Notifications can
also be set to remind users to engage, a function that has been
shown to improve the efficacy of mental health apps [24]. In

addition  to  acting  as  standalone  interventions  for  individuals
with  mild  to  moderate  support  needs,  apps  can  be  used  to
augment professional interventions [25,26].

Research  on  existing  ACT-based  app  interventions  offers  a
valuable direction for designing ACT-based apps for behavior
change. For example, participants who used a more complex
ACT matrix health app made greater health improvements and
used the app more than those who used a simpler version [27],
suggesting that users may prefer a variety of novel toolbox-like
activities. The involvement of key stakeholders at the design
stage of an app program, including end users from the intended
population  and  clinicians  with  relevant  expertise,  is  also
its  appeal,  accessibility,  and
paramount 
trustworthiness  [28].  For 
intervention
this  reason, 
investigated  in  this  study  was  designed  using  participatory
design methods involving individuals with visible differences
and clinicians with relevant expertise, as detailed in a previous
article [29].

to  optimize 

the 

Another design consideration is whether to make a mobile app
self-guided or guided. In general, higher levels of professional
input may confer greater efficacy [24]. However, self-guided
mobile apps require fewer support resources and, therefore, are
capable of reaching more users. Equally, in the field of ACT
self-help  studies,  evidence  for  the  superiority  of  guided
interventions is equivocal. Selvi et al [18] found no additional
benefit of guided self-help for body dissatisfaction compared
with  the  self-guided  version.  Similarly,  in  a  trial  of  an
ACT-based  social  anxiety  intervention  delivered  on  the  web
and via an app (with equivalent content), researchers [30] found
no  differences  between  guided  and  unguided  versions  of  the
intervention on social anxiety outcomes. The authors proposed
that  mobile  app  features  may  partially  compensate  for  the
absence  of  a  guiding  therapist,  for  example,  by  providing
real-time feedback during exposure tasks. However, an absence
of professional oversight may heighten concerns of potential
iatrogenic effects on well-being [31]. Therefore, it is important
to  mitigate  against  and  test  for  any  iatrogenic  effects  in  the
design and testing of mobile interventions.

Goal of This Study
The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  assess  the  feasibility,  or  proof  of
concept,  of  an  ACT-based  self-guided  prototype  mobile
intervention  for  individuals  with  visible  differences  who
experience  appearance-related  concerns.  The  prototype  is
delivered via a mobile-optimized web app that simulates a native

mobile  app,  which  is  consistent  with  the  recommendation  to
test low-cost iterations of behavior change apps before building
full-scale versions [32]. By assessing the prototype’s feasibility
using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, we aim to
make subsequent modifications to develop a native app and test
this via a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The primary feasibility objectives target user engagement and
acceptability,  and  the  secondary  objective  is  to  determine
whether the program indicates clinical safety and preliminary
effectiveness.

Methods

Participants
A sample of 36 adults was recruited between July and November
2020.  The  primary  recruitment  strategy  drew  from  19  UK
charities that represented and supported individuals with a range
of congenital and acquired appearance-affecting conditions and
advertised the study to potential participants via social media,
newsletters, distribution lists, and web-based events. Researchers
also promoted the study on relevant Reddit subgroups with the
aim  of  boosting  the  number  of  male  participants,  given  the
comparatively higher use of Reddit by men versus women [33].

To be eligible, participants had to self-report as having a visible
difference (defined to participants as a physical appearance they
considered  to  be  significantly  different  from  a  typical
appearance,  with  a  list  of  example  causes  given).  Eligibility
also  included  currently  experiencing  appearance  concerns,
defined  as  psychological  and/or  social  difficulties  related  to
their  visible  differences,  such  as  appearance-based  social
anxiety, low mood, and body image concerns. Participants also
had to be aged ≥18 years, a UK resident, own a smartphone and
have regular internet access (either through home Wi-Fi and/or
cellular data), and have experience in using apps. Participants
were  ineligible  if  they  acquired  a  visible  difference  from
traumatic  injury  in  the  preceding  6  months  because  of  the
heightened risk of unprocessed psychological trauma, for which
intervention  would  be  clinically
a 
inappropriate. Ineligibility also included current experience of
a mental health crisis (eg, suicidality or self-harm), undergoing
talking therapy, or having appearance concerns primarily related
to  weight  or  eating.  The  sample’s  mean  age  was  36.67  (SD
14.25) years. All other demographic characteristics are presented
in Table 1.

The Intervention
The program ACT It Out comprises 6 sessions designed to take
approximately  30  minutes  each  and  be  completed  weekly,
augmented  with  between-session  Skill  builder toolbox-like
activities  for  the  everyday  practice  of  the  ACT-based  skills
presented  in  session.  Textbox  1 shows  an  overview  of  the
program content. The material was derived from a combination
of  the  intervention  research  literature  and  stakeholder  input.
ACT-specific content was drawn from evidence-based protocols

for  social  anxiety  [19]  (eg,  safety  mode for  threat-focused
attention in public) and body dissatisfaction [20] (eg, mindful
mirror exercise) and adapted for the population, for example,
by acknowledging the possibility of unsolicited public attention
in relation to social anxiety and modifying the mindful mirror
script  to  account  for  participants’ bodily  areas  of  visible
difference rather than their body weight and shape. Social skills
training for managing difficult social interactions was informed
by  existing  evidence-based  self-help  programs,  for  example,
the study by Bessell et al [23].

feedback 

ACT  It  Out underwent  an  iterative  design  process  led  by  the
first  author 
from  user
incorporating 
representatives and psychological practitioners with expertise
in ACT and/or visible differences. The second and third authors
(OD and ER) contributed to the program’s design and testing
as  clinical  lead  and  user  representative  lead,  respectively.
Examples of user-driven content incorporated into the prototype
included a human interactive element (involving an app guide,
the  second  author  OD);  real  case  examples  throughout  to
illustrate  ACT  principles  and  offer  a  sense  of  commonality
(many  provided  by  user  representatives);  and  accessible
formatting, including large font, subtitles, and audio transcripts.
Content based on clinicians’ input reflected their preferences
for the inclusion of a range of established ACT metaphors used
important  concepts,  management  of  users’
to  convey 
expectations through clear information and periodic check-ins
on the ACT model (eg, reiterating that the goal is not to directly
reduce  negative  affect),  and  provision  of  sufficient  time  for
behavior modification.

ACT  It  Out is  self-guided,  although  the  in-built  app  guide
featuring  in  the  introductory  videos  in  each  session  and  in
tailored  feedback  throughout  is  designed  to  facilitate  human
interaction. ACT metaphors integrated into the program included
passengers on a bus (whereby unwanted thoughts and feelings
are represented by passengers on a bus), the choice point (in
which a dichotomous choice is presented between actions that
serve  personal  values  (toward  moves)  and  those  that  do  not
(away  moves)  [34]),  and  modified  psychological  flexibility
pillars (with the different psychological flexibility subprocesses
each presented as a pillar) that can be built up over time, with

the addition of self-compassion, as used in clinical practice for
this  population  by  the  second  author  (OD)  [18].  These  were
presented  in  a  multimedia  form  via  videos,  pictures,  and
interactive exercises (as preferred by ACT clinicians [25]), along
with 
practices.
Self-monitoring of various ACT processes via single questions
(eg,  present  moment  contact),  value-based  goals,  and  social
skills training was integrated throughout. Real-time behavioral
recording (eg, of toward or away moves) was built into Skill
builders, and personalized timed reminders to engage in Skill
builders and subsequent sessions were programmed.

guided  mindfulness 

As  new  content  was  introduced  in  each  session,  users  were
encouraged to complete all 6 sessions, which would represent
full completion. However, the core components of the program
in  the  form  of  mindfulness  (incorporating  acceptance  and
cognitive  defusion),  self-compassion,  value  clarification,
value-based goal setting, and social skills were all covered by
session 4, with sessions 5 and 6 building on and consolidating
these components. Completion of sessions 1 to 4 could therefore
be expected to represent a cutoff for minimal completion.

Program content was delivered via the Qualtrics XM (Qualtrics
International Inc) survey web app, which was constructed by
the  first  and  fifth  authors  (FZ  and  HG).  Qualtrics  XM  is  a
mobile-optimized survey platform that can accommodate many
native app features, such as embedded multimedia, responsive
content tailored to users’ actions, and discrete toolbox options
accessible  from  the  home  screen.  Example  screenshots  are
shown in Figure 1. Text reminders were programmed to simulate
push notifications.

Design
This study adopted a single-group mixed methods design. We
chose this design for its suitability to the study’s objectives of
user  engagement,  acceptability,  and  clinical  safety  and
preliminary effectiveness, which together focused on assessing
proof of concept before justifying native app development and
more rigorous testing of a final product via a randomized design
[35]. These objectives and the study design were informed by
a combination of the Bowen et al [36] feasibility study design
recommendations, as used in comparable mobile app feasibility
trials [37,38]; the UK Medical Research Council guidance on
developing and testing complex interventions [39,40]; and the
Obesity-Related  Behavioral  Intervention  Trials  model  for
developing  behavioral  interventions  in  long-term  health
conditions  [35].  As  is  the  case  in  this  study,  both  the  UK
Medical  Research  Council  and  Obesity-Related  Behavioral
Intervention  Trials  models  recognize  that  there  is  often  an
overlap between the later objectives of the development phase,
in  which  an  intervention  is  refined,  and  the  early  feasibility
objectives of the testing phase.

Led by this guidance, the authors used a range of mixed methods
to  meet  the  objectives.  The  authors  aimed  to  assess  user
engagement  via  program  adherence,  duration  of  use,  and
in-program use. Acceptability was determined via satisfaction
ratings  and  explored  in  greater  depth  through  semistructured
qualitative exit interviews.

To test the secondary objective of whether the program indicated
clinical  safety  and  preliminary  effectiveness,  we  assessed
changes  in  a  range  of  outcomes  over  3  time  points.  The
outcomes included (1) appearance-related life disengagement
and  appearance-fixing  behaviors  as  primary  outcomes  of
targeted  behavior  change;  (2)  measures  of  key  targeted  ACT
processes,  cognitive  fusion,  and  experiential  avoidance,  as
indicated  in  prior  research  [14],  as  well  as  valued  action  (a
targeted  behavioral  component  of  psychological  flexibility);
and 
(3)  clinical  well-being  outcomes  and  secondary
appearance-focused  measures  to  test  for  iatrogenic  effects.
Clinical safety would be indicated by improvement or stability
in the relevant measures and preliminary effectiveness indicated
by  improvement  in  measures.  Completion  rates  and  scale
attenuation  effects  were  also  checked  for  measures  to  assess

their feasibility for use in future RCTs. In addition, qualitative
interviews  were  used  to  gain  a  richer  understanding  of  how
participants  may  have  experienced  the  program  in  terms  of
perceived psychological safety and any benefits from using the
program.

Procedure
Ethical approval was granted by the university faculty research
ethics  committee.  The  first  author  (FZ)  contacted  interested
individuals  by  their  chosen  method,  then  arranged  a  15-  to
20-minute orientation telephone call, in which FZ confirmed
individuals’ eligibility,  guided  participants  in  setting  up  the
program, and oriented them to the platform. Before commencing
the program, participants were instructed to check and complete
a web-based consent checklist, followed by baseline outcome
measures.  Upon  consent,  participants  were  sent  a  £10  (US
$13.28)  web-based  shopping  voucher  to  compensate  for  any
data use costs. Outcome measures were sent to participants after
8  weeks  (allowing  2  additional  weeks  for  anticipated  time
slippage) and after 12 weeks, when a second compensatory £10
(US  $13.28)  web-based  shopping  voucher  was  sent  to
completers. Access to ACT It Out was available to participants
for  12  weeks  as  the  authors  sought  to  measure  completion
duration as part of the user engagement objective.

Semistructured  exit  interviews  with  FZ  were  planned  for  a
representative subsample of up to half of the sample, including
program noncompleters. Full completers were invited after the
12-week measurement, and noncompleters were invited 3 weeks
after  their  final  use  of  ACT  It  Out to  mitigate  loss  in  recall
memory.  Participants  were  invited  via  email,  with  the
information sheet sent as an attachment. The first author (FZ)
took  verbal  consent  at  the  start  of  the  interview  and  sent
participants  a  £10  (US  $13.28)  web-based  shopping  voucher
following the interview (offered as a small incentive). Participant
flow and dropout across the entire study are presented in Figure
2.

This  study  coincided  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  In
consultation with the user representative lead (third author, ER),
we decided to commence the study in July 2020 when national
COVID-19  lockdown restrictions  had  been  eased,  and  study
recruitment was ended when a further national lockdown was
enforced in November 2020.

Quantitative Measures

User Engagement

Data embedded within the program were collected on total and
session-by-session  duration  of  use,  as  well  as  self-reported
engagement with key content features, including value-based
goals  and  mindfulness  and 
skills  exercises.
Session-by-session  program  adherence  was  monitored  and
recorded daily by the first author (FZ).

social 

Acceptability

Satisfaction rating questions were embedded at the end of each
program session, with ratings ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree). These questions were based on a previous
feasibility trial of a web-based intervention for individuals with
visible  differences  [41].  Participants’ mean  scores  across  all
completed  sessions  were  calculated  to  provide  an  overall
satisfaction score.

α=.86).  The  score  range  of  the  CFQ  is  7  to  49,  with  higher
scores representing higher cognitive fusion.

The Body Image Life Disengagement Questionnaire [42] was
used to measure the degree of participants’ disengagement from
appearance-salient  activities  across  recreational,  social,  and
occupational  life  domains  because  of  appearance  concerns.
Items are rated from 1 (has not stopped me at all) to 4 (stopped
me all the time). The 11-item modified version of the 10-item
original version that includes a population-specific item (use
public transport) has been used in a previous study with visibly
different participants, showing good reliability [14]. Reliability
in this study was good (Cronbach α=.88). The score range of
the Body Image Life Disengagement Questionnaire is 1 to 4,
with a lower mean score indicating greater life engagement.

Strategies
The 
Inventory–Appearance-fixing 
subscale
assessed  participants’ tendency  to  conceal,  correct,  seek
reassurance,  and  engage  in  social  comparisons  about  their
appearance. Items are rated between 0 (definitely not like me)
and 3 (definitely like me). The BICSI-AF demonstrated good
reliability  and  validity  in  college  students  [15]  and  strong
reliability  in  visibly  different  populations  [14,43].  Internal
consistency in this study was good (Cronbach α=.86). The score
range  of  the  BICSI-AF  is  0  to  3,  with  higher  mean  scores
representing greater use of appearance-fixing behaviors.

The  Body  Esteem  for  Adolescents  and  Adults–Appearance
subscale  [44]  measured  participants’ evaluation  of  their  own
appearance on 10 items. The subscale has shown good reliability
and validity in young adults [45] and good reliability in samples
with  visible  differences  [14,46].  In  this  study,  reliability  was
excellent  (Cronbach  α=.92).  A  total  of  6  items  were  reverse
coded, and higher scores in the range of 0 to 4 indicated a more
positive appearance evaluation.

The  6-item  Fear  of  Negative  Appearance  Evaluation  Scale
(FNAES [47]) was used to assess participants’ level of concern
that  others  would  negatively  evaluate  their  appearance.  The
FNAES has been shown to have good validity and reliability
in  college  students  [47],  and  reliability  in  this  study  was
excellent (Cronbach α=.96). The scale range for the FNAES is
6 to 30, with higher scores suggesting participants’ greater level
of concern.

The  Comprehensive  Assessment  of  Acceptance  and
Commitment Therapy–Valued Action subscale [50] was used
to  determine  the  extent  to  which  participants  engaged  in
value-oriented action, combining the traditional psychological
flexibility  subprocesses  of  value  clarification  and  committed
action. The 8-item subscale demonstrated strong reliability and
validity in a variety of adult samples [51] and showed acceptable
reliability in this study (Cronbach α=.78). The Comprehensive
Assessment of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy–Valued
Action scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores reflecting
greater valued action.

Clinical Well-being Measures

The  14-item  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS
[52]) measured depression and anxiety in participants, with 7
items  for  each  subscale.  The  HADS  has  well-established
reliability  and  validity  in  a  range  of  clinical  and  community
populations  [53].  In  this  study,  internal  consistency  was
acceptable  for  depression  (Cronbach  α=.77)  and  anxiety
(Cronbach α=.74).

Anxiety and depression caseness on the scale range of 0 to 21
is  indicated  by  subscale  scores  of  8  to  10  (mild),  11  to  14
(moderate),  and  15  to  21  (severe).  As  the  HADS  alone  is
insufficient  for  a  diagnosis,  this  study  did  not  exclude
participants  scoring  in  the  severe  range.  Instead,  automated
messages offering support contact details and a suggestion to
consider whether involvement in the study was suitable were
presented to any participants scoring in the severe range.

Qualitative Measures
To explore areas related to (1) program acceptability and (2)
clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness in more depth, the
first  author  (FZ)  conducted  semistructured  interviews  via
telephone,  lasting  an  average  of  27  (SD  10.0;  range  14-38)
minutes. The schedule explored participants’ overall impression
of ACT It Out, any aspects they particularly liked or disliked
and/or  found  helpful  or  unhelpful,  any  notable  benefits  or
detriments from using it, their views on the various program
features,  and,  particularly  for  noncompleters,  whether  there
were any aspects of the program that hindered adherence.

ACT Measures

Data Analysis

The Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire [48] measured
participants’ level  of  experiential  avoidance  using  15  items.
The scale showed strong reliability and validity in a mixed adult
group [48], good internal consistency in a previous study with
visibly different participants [46], and good internal consistency
in  this  study  (Cronbach  α=.86).  The  Brief  Experiential
Avoidance  Questionnaire  scores  range  from  15  to  90,  with
higher scores indicating higher experiential avoidance.

The 7-item Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ [49]) assessed
participants’ degree  of  cognitive  fusion.  The  CFQ  has  good
validity and reliability in clinical and nonclinical adult samples
[49]  and  showed  strong  reliability  in  a  visibly  different
population [14]. In this study, reliability was good (Cronbach

Quantitative Data
Frequencies and descriptive data (mean and SD) were calculated
for  data  pertaining  to  user  engagement  and  acceptability.
Adherence was recorded in increments of 0.5 sessions to include
partially  completed  sessions,  which  were  defined  as  when
participants completed a minimum of one-third of the relevant
session  without  completing  the  full  session.  In  exploratory
analyses of the predictive effect of demographic data on user
engagement, we used a binomial logistic regression model with
age and education level (dichotomized into categories of higher
education  and  high  school  or  vocational  training)  as  the
independent  variables  and  adherence  (full  completion  or
noncompletion) as the dependent variable. Independent sample
tests  (2-tailed)  were  used  to  check  for  differences  in

acceptability scores by gender and education status, and Pearson
correlation coefficients were calculated to test for a relationship
between age and acceptability scores.

To assess clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness, mixed
model  repeated  measure  (MMRM)  analyses  were  used  to
determine  the  significance  level  of  any  changes  in  scores
between baseline and week 8, baseline and week 12, and across
all time points. Hedge g was calculated as corrected effect sizes
for baseline to week 8 and baseline to week 12 changes because
of  the  small  sample  size  [54].  Scale  attenuation  effects  were
checked  for  each  scale  at  all  time  points  by  assessing  the
percentage  of  participants  who  reported  the  maximum  and
minimum possible scores, with ≥15% indicating ceiling or floor
effects [55]. Of the 36 participants, 8 (22%) participants did not
complete week 8 measures and 5 (14%) did not complete week
12 measures. The MMRM analyses accounted for all recorded
data  and  modeled  intention-to-treat  analyses.  Item-level
missingness was negligible: a single item was missing from the
data set, and available item analysis was used to score the scale
in this case [56].

Qualitative Data
Interview data were analyzed by the first author (FZ) on NVivo
software version 12 (QSR International) using thematic analysis
from  a  primarily  deductive  approach;  namely,  themes  were
generated  to  answer  the  specific  research  questions  of
acceptability  and  preliminary  effectiveness.  The  first  author

(FZ) followed the Braun and Clarke [57] six-step procedure,
with minor modifications recommended by Braun and Clarke
[58], as follows: (1) data familiarization through transcription,
reading, and rereading; (2) generating initial codes across the
entire data set; (3) generating draft themes; (4) reviewing themes
by  cross-referencing  against  coded  extracts;  (5)  defining,
refining, and naming themes; and (6) producing a report of the
results and relating these findings to the research question and
literature. The sixth author (HW) read a sample of interview
transcripts and reviewed the first author’s (FZ) analysis. Minor
changes to theme descriptions were made following discussions
between the authors. FZ sent a summary of these findings to
interview  participants 
the  purpose  of  conferring
trustworthiness via member checking [59]. Approximately 19%
(7/36) of participants responded and requested no changes.

Results

User Engagement
Out of the 6 sessions, participants completed an average of 3.32
(SD 1.85) sessions by week 8 and 3.72 (SD 2.11) by week 12.
Of 36 participants, 16 (42%) completed the entire program by
week 12, and 19 (53%) participants completed the suggested
minimal completion cutoff of ≥4 sessions. Session-by-session
adherence rates showed a slightly steeper dropout rate in the
first half of the program (up to session 3), as shown in Figure
3.

A binomial logistic regression model with age and education
level  as  predictors  of  adherence  was  statistically  significant
(χ2
2=12.5;  P=.002,  with  the  combined  predictors  explaining
39.6%  of  the  variance  in  the  likelihood  of  participants
completing  the  program  (Nagelkerke  R2).  Within  the  model,
age  and  education  level  were  both  statistically  significant  in

isolation.  Higher  age  of  participants  was  associated  with  a
greater likelihood of completing all 6 sessions, and those with
a high school or vocational training level of education had 9.01
times higher odds of completing the program compared with
those with university-level education. Owing to the low number
of  male  participants,  gender  could  not  be  included  in  the
binomial logistic regression model. However, although based

on a small number of male participants (7/36, 19%), the mean
age  of  male  participants  was  lower  than  that  of  the  females
(29/36, 81%; mean age: 25.57 years vs 39.34 years), and a lower
proportion  of  males  (2/7,  29%)  fully  completed  the  course
compared with females (13/27, 48%), suggesting the possibility
of a gender effect on completion likelihood, either in addition
to or explaining the effect of age and education.

Participants spent an average of 25.7 (SD 14.67) minutes per
session and 317.65 (SD 74.10) minutes in total over an average
of 6.9 (SD 3.84) weeks. The engagement rates with value-based
goal-setting  activities  are  shown  in  Table  2.  Of  the  19
participants  who  completed  session  4,  14  (74%)  reported
practicing the guided mindfulness of breath exercise introduced
in session 3 a few times (not daily); 3 (17%) reported practicing
the  exercise  daily;  and  2  (11%)  reported  not  once.  In  the

following  session,  of  the  17  participants,  13  (76%)  reported
practicing  the  mindfulness  of  intense  experiences  exercise  a
few times (not daily), and 2 (12%) selected daily and not once,
respectively.  Of  the  16  participants  who  took  session  6,  12
(75%) reported practicing the final guided mindfulness practices
(mindful  mirror)  a  few  times  (not  daily),  3  (19%)  reported
practicing it daily, and 1 (6%) selected not once. In session 6,
participants  were  asked  which  of  a  set  of  statements  best
described  their  efforts  in  applying  the  social  skills  they  had
chosen  to  work  on  in  sessions  4  and  5.  Of  14  responders,  7
(50%) selected “I’ve tested skills for real, and found it helpful”;
4 (29%) chose “I’ve practiced skills but struggled with it”; 2
(14%)  selected  “I’ve  practiced  skills,  but  not  used  them  for
real”; and 1 (7%) chose “I’ve not practiced or used skills for
real.”

Acceptability

Overview
As presented in Table 3, most participants reported satisfactions
with the program in terms of comprehensibility, interest, and
helpfulness (although a smaller majority reported finding the

sessions  helpful).  Independent  samples  t tests  revealed  no
significant  differences  in  any  of  the  3  satisfaction  ratings
between male and female participants or in those with university
level  of  education  and  high  school  level  education.  Pearson
correlation  coefficients  showed  no  relationship  between  age
and scores on any of the 3 satisfaction ratings.

Of the 36 participants, 12 (33%) participants took part in exit
interviews. The mean age of the interview participants was 39.9
(SD 15.49) years. Of the 12 participants, 10 (83%) were female,
2  (17%)  were  male,  and  11  (92%)  were  White.  Of  the  12
participants,  6  (50%)  had  completed  all  6  sessions  of  the
program,  and  6  (50%)  had  not.  Thematic  analysis  of  the
interviews  generated  4  overall  themes,  with  3  relevant  to
program  acceptability.  These  are  presented  in  the  following
sections with illustrative quotes.

Mobile Features Facilitated Engagement
Most  participants  described  the  program’s  mobile  features
favorably, especially in terms of giving flexible and immediate
access:

...it felt like a little pocketbook. And just to sort of pull
it out if I was waiting for my daughter to come out of
work, I could just read something and it focused my
mind a bit. [female, 44 years, acquired craniofacial
condition]

Zucchelli et al

Participants particularly highlighted the tailored text reminders
(simulating notifications) as a crucial feature in prompting the
use of the program:

I liked that this alerted you as well, you could set it
to send you text messages and it reminded you to be
mindful...even though I was busy with work, some of
those  I  set  them  and  they  came  through  during  the
day and I just did them. Which I thought was super
helpful. [female, 26 years, congenital difference]

Engaging Content (With Room for Improvement)
All participants felt that the multimedia elements of ACT It Out
aided  their  understanding  of  the  ACT  model,  although  some
felt  these  elements  could  be  presented  in  a  more  dynamic,
interactive, and clear way or more material presented visually
rather  than  via  text.  Some  referred  to  the  toward and  away
arrows and the pillars, and many highlighted the passengers on
the bus animation:

There’s like a video of the people on the bus...even
though I now think about it as maybe too simple, it
actually  is  probably  quite  effective  because  I
remember it very vividly. [female, 26 years, congenital
difference]

Some participants described the content as easy to follow (male,
21 years, skin condition):

Well I sound strange given I didn’t complete it, but
it was still very positive, the bits that I did actually
do. It was very clear...the information was very sort
of concise and clear. [male, 22 years, skin condition]

Others felt improvements could be made to improve the clarity
and navigation of the program:

I  wasn’t  sure  to  do  these  [exercises],  do  they  get
recorded  [in  the  program]  or  are  you  just  doing  it
for yourself? That wasn’t clear enough to me I don’t
think.
[female,  56  years,  acquired  craniofacial
condition]

Challenges to Sustained Use
Some participants, including noncompleters, discussed the effort
required  to  fully  engage,  such  as  needing  strong  motivation,
self-discipline,  and  sufficient  energy  to  work  through  the
program in the face of competing demands and stressors:

...with  all  the  apps  you’ve  got  on  your  phone...it’s
massive  competition  for  attention  and  those  other
things like Tik Tok and Instagram, they’re obviously
geared towards trying to reward. And this [program]
requires a lot more self-discipline and it’s something
that’s not necessarily going to make you feel good or
anything like that. [male, 22 years, skin condition]

To  place  participants’ views  in  context,  it  is  noteworthy  that
they  highlighted  challenging  personal  circumstances  and
stressors as a barrier to engaging fully in the course, especially
given that the study spanned the COVID-19 pandemic: “...when
obviously the pandemic started to happen with the Coronavirus
and the lockdown and then things changed at home, I just found
it kind of impossible to remember to actually go on it” [female,
24 years, congenital condition].

Clinical Safety and Preliminary Effectiveness

Overview
Table  4 shows  the  results  of  the  MMRM  analyses  for  all
outcome measures. Regarding the primary outcomes, appearance
fixing  significantly  decreased  at  8  weeks;  however,
improvements were lost at 12 weeks, and the opposite was found
for life disengagement. Of the 2, only appearance fixing showed
significant improvements over the combined time points. Hedge
g corrected effect sizes for the primary measures ranged between
0.34 and 0.62 at premeasurement to week 8 measurement and
premeasurement to week 12 measurement, suggesting small to
medium effects. Changes in ACT measures were significantly
favorable  in  all  analyses,  other  than  the  valued  action  from
premeasurement  to  week  12  measurement.  Of  the  36
participants, at baseline, 5 (14%) participants scored in the mild
range  for  depression  caseness  and  5  (14%)  scored  in  the
moderate range; 3 (8%) scored in the severe range for anxiety,
11 (31%) scored in the mild range, and 7 (19%) scored in the
moderate  range.  Overall  anxiety  and  depression  scores  were
significantly  reduced,  and  although  anxiety  scores  did  not
significantly reduce at week 8, the trend was toward a decrease,
suggesting no iatrogenic effects from the program. Floor and
ceiling effects were not detected other than for fear of negative
appearance evaluation at baseline measurement, in which 17%
(6/36)  of  participants  reported  the  highest  possible  score,
suggesting a higher level of concern and a possible ceiling effect.

Of  the  4  themes  from  the  interview  data,  1  (25%)  related  to
clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness.

How the Program Helped
Relevant  to  clinical  safety,  some  participants  described  the
content as supportive and encouraging, especially the interaction
from the app guide: “I came out of [a mindfulness exercise],
before I read [the app guide’s] comment, thinking ‘Well that
was pointless’, but then reading what she said, it was like well
actually no, it’s quite difficult to do and I don’t feel so bad about
it now” [female, 44 years, acquired craniofacial condition].

Most  participants  talked  about  specific  ways  in  which  using
ACT It Out had benefited their behavior and/or self-awareness
regarding  their  appearance.  Some  referred  to  ACT-specific

behavior change, whereas others highlighted appearance-specific
content such as social skills training or a combination of the 2,
such as safety mode behaviors like appearance comparisons:

[ACT It Out] actually inspired me to delete Facebook.
I did find that it was a massive trigger to me...I think
it  was  the  question  prompts,  when  it  said  about
comparing yourself to others, and it really made me
think actually I do that a lot of the time. I just thought
“I don’t need that in my life. Why am I spending 2
hours  scrolling  through  Facebook,  to  look  at  other
people  that  look  perfect?” [female,  24  years,

Many  participants  described  the  course  content  as  bringing
about  greater  self-awareness  of  psychological  processes  and
their link to overt behavior:

So I have some old habits as a result of my scarring
which I didn’t know were there...For example when
I go for a run I’ll wear a sports top, and while I’m
running  I  touch  my  chest.  I  didn’t  know  I  did  that,
because I was thinking people are looking at me, so
I try and move my top around and things like that,
which are a bit odd. And I hadn’t noticed that before
until I did the app. I suppose [it was because of] those
people when they gave their experiences [in ACT It
Out],  the  little  bubbles  with  personal  experiences.
That  resonated  with  me. [female,  23  years,  skin
condition]

Discussion

Principal Findings
The  overall  finding  of  this  feasibility  study  was  that  a  novel
prototype mobile ACT program, ACT It Out, showed proof of
concept  for  adults  with  visible  differences  who  experienced
appearance  concerns.  The  results  pertaining  to  the  primary
feasibility  objectives  of  determining  user  engagement  and
acceptability support this overall finding.

time  similarly  follows 

In  terms  of  user  engagement,  over  half  of  the  participants
completed the minimum cutoff of at least 4 of 6 sessions, and
full completion rates were at the upper end of the 34% to 41%
range reported in a recent meta-analysis on apps for anxiety,
depression,  and  stress,  whereas  the  observed  decline  in
participant  adherence  over 
the
meta-analytical findings [61]. Combined, these findings suggest
acceptable  levels  of  adherence.  The  finding  that  higher  age
significantly predicted a greater likelihood of completion is of
potential noteworthiness. Research findings on the influence of
age on mental health app adherence are equivocal, with 3 studies
included in a meta-analysis finding no relation and 1 finding
older age to be associated with greater adherence [61]. Given
that  in  this  study,  young  interview  participants  made  more
mention  of  the  look  and  feel  of  the  prototype  than  older
participants, it may be that the younger participants held higher
expectations of the prototype’s interface and were more deterred
by the somewhat basic Qualtrics web app interface. This finding
could also reflect the overall higher use of smartphone apps in
younger people, especially in the form of social, gaming, and
video  apps  [62],  which  may  offer  greater  competition  for
smartphone use, as noted by a young noncompleter participant
in  the  interviews.  The  apparently  lower  completion  rates  of
male  participants,  who  were  also  younger  on  average  than
female participants, introduce a potential alternative or additive
explanation. Either way, this finding points to the importance
of us gaining feedback from young and male user representatives
when developing a final native app. It also poses the question
of whether participants’ use rates of other apps would moderate
their level of engagement with the final ACT It Out. This could
be answered in a larger trial by asking participants to self-report
their broader app use. The finding that individuals with a lower
level of education were more likely to complete all sessions is

also  of  interest.  As  part  of  the  stakeholder-informed  design
phase  of  ACT  It  Out,  the  authors  made  a  concerted  effort  to
create  an  accessible  and  comprehensible  intervention.  As
reflected by a minority of interview participants, some of the
program content may potentially have been considered overly
simplistic, and hence less stimulating for some. That being said,
there was no difference in participants’ satisfaction ratings of
interest between those with university education and those with
high school education. Nevertheless, offering optional advanced
informational  resources  in  a  final  app  would  help  enrich  the
depth  of  material  while

retaining 

the 

Encouragingly,  participants’ average  time  spent  completing
sessions was consistent with the design intentions of 30 minutes
per  session  over  6  to  8  weeks,  with  individual  sessions
completed in a mixture of single and multiple sittings, according
to supplementary interview data. This tallies with the interview
findings  that  participants  valued  being  able  to  flexibly  work
through the program according to their schedule. The finding
that most participants reported completing mindfulness practices
only semiregularly aligns with the literature on mindfulness app
use, for example, the study by Mikolasek et al [63]. Mindfulness
practice  rates  may  also  have  been  hindered  by  the  web  app
interface,  with  some  interview  participants  discussing  the
challenge  of  navigating  into  target  content  in  Qualtrics  after
receiving text reminders. The same issue may have contributed
to the low uptake of long-term value-based goal setting, a feature
accessed via Skill builders in the program menu rather than in
session. Given apparently higher engagement with social skills
training and its tangible relevance to appearance concerns, its
earlier introduction in the program could potentially improve
adherence.

Overall,  the  program  was  rated  as  acceptable,  with  the
percentage  of  affirmative  satisfaction  ratings  pertaining  to
comprehensibility  and 
interest  well  above  acceptability
thresholds of 70% used in comparable app feasibility studies,
for example, the study by Huberty et al [38]. The lower majority
of participants rating the sessions as helpful may partly reflect
the questions being delivered immediately at the end of each
session, thereby giving no practice time for skills introduced in
the session.

The  interview  data  offered  vital  insight  into  participants’
experience of using the program in terms of its suitability and
appeal,  highlighting  both  strengths  and  areas  for  refinement.
Participants’
the  added  value  of
mobile-specific benefits such as tailored, immediately actionable
reminders  and  remote,  location-flexible  accessibility.  Most
interview participants also described the content as appropriately
clear, concise, and engaging for the mobile platform, a common
challenge in adapting material from other self-help formats [32]
(as was involved in the design process of this program). The
supportive  tone  described  by  participants  may  reflect  the
importance placed on this aspect in the program’s design, based
on preceding stakeholder-informed design work. The need for
personal  effort  and  self-discipline  highlighted  by  some
participants may suggest that a greater degree of extrinsic reward
be built into future versions of the program. This could include
elements successfully used in ACT-based behavior change apps,

for example, in the study by Bricker et al [64], such as badges
awarded  for  completed  goals  and  sequential  unlocking  of
features such as mindfulness exercises as users progress.

Results pertaining to the secondary objective of assessing the
program’s clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness are only
indicative, given the possibility of artifact findings arising from
demand characteristics in single-group designs [65], the small
sample size, and the short-term measurement. Nevertheless, the
finding that all outcomes, including primary appearance-related
behaviors  and  ACT  process  measures,  showed  significantly
favorable changes from baseline to at least one of the week 8
and week 12 time points offers encouragement for the program’s
potential effectiveness under more rigorous evaluation.

Importantly, for the purpose of checking for iatrogenic effects
from the program, there was no increase in depression or anxiety
over  time.  Similarly,  both  secondary  appearance-related
measures  of  appearance  self-evaluation  and  fear  of  negative
appearance evaluation, which were not directly targeted through
the program’s focus on valued action, improved over the 3 time
points. However, the FNAES [47] used did show a signal of a
ceiling  effect  at  baseline  measurement,  with  >15%  of
participants scoring the maximum fear of negative evaluation
score. This indicates potential concern with its content validity
and  responsiveness  in  the  target  population  [55]  and  hence
requires  careful  consideration  for  use  in  future  RCTs.  The
finding that improvements in valued action were lost at week
12  may  be  partly  explained  by  the  low  uptake  in  long-term
value-based goal setting in the final session, suggesting that the
design  of  this  feature  requires  close  attention  in  the  future
version. Interviews also offered illustrative accounts of specific
ways in which participants benefited from the program, most
prominently in terms of reducing appearance-fixing behaviors
(eg, engaging in hours of appearance comparisons on Facebook
and habitually adjusting sportswear).

Strengths and Limitations

the  comprehensive  and
the  study 
stakeholder-focused process through which the program, ACT

insight 

The limitations of this study include its co-occurrence with the
COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for confounding effects
on at least some data. Although data were collected during a

period of lesser restrictions, the context of participants’ lives
was nevertheless altered in ways relevant to common appearance
concerns in individuals with visible differences. For example,
the implementation of mandated mask-wearing may have offered
individuals with facial differences such as cleft lip and/or palate
a  socially  sanctioned  means  of  concealment,  and  social
restrictions  may  have  similarly  reduced  some  participants’
appearance concerns because of enforced minimization of social
contact. Conversely, the widespread use of video calling and
conferencing platforms during the pandemic has been indicated
as a source of heightened appearance anxiety for individuals
with visible differences (personal communication by Professor
Diana Harcourt, October 14, 2021). Therefore, the exact impact
of  the  pandemic  context  on  participants’ data  is  difficult  to
determine. Nonetheless, the validity and reliability of certain
outcome  measures 
disengagement  with
appearance-salient activities may have been adversely affected.

as 

The widespread disruption caused by the pandemic may also
at  least  partly  account  for  participants’ higher-than-expected
anxiety scores at baseline, as suggested by an increase in anxiety
scores since the pandemic in the general UK population [66].
Some noncompleter participants also cited COVID-19–related
disruption as a cause of program nonadherence in interviews,
suggesting  that  adherence  rates  may  have  been  higher  under
typical circumstances. Other data more centered on the content
of ACT It Out and the experience of using it, such as satisfaction
ratings and the detailed accounts collected via interviews, should
be less dependent on societal conditions.

Conclusions
Despite  these  limitations,  overall  findings  suggest  promising
feasibility  of  the  ACT  It  Out program  via  adequate  levels  of
engagement, acceptability, and indication of clinical safety and
positive changes in outcomes. The study also yielded valuable
direction for refinements to further enhance its potential utility.
When developed further and shown to be effective under more
rigorous  evaluation,  the  program  could  offer  a  valuable
standalone resource for individuals with visible differences who
have mild to moderate appearance concerns, as well as a tool
for specialist clinicians to use alongside psychological therapy.
