Summary A substantial number of neurological dis-
eases lead to chronic impairment of activities of daily
living (ADL) and physical or mental dependence. In
Austria, homecare is provided mostly by female fam-
ily members. Moreover, mainly female personnel, in
the majority from southern and eastern European
countries, contributes to care. Dependence and need
for care vary between neurological diagnoses and
accompanying diseases. Caregiver burden (CB) de-
pends on patient- and caregiver-related and external
factors, such as integrity of a family network, spatial
resources, and socioeconomic factors. Depending
on the neurological diagnosis, disease severity, and
behavioral
impairment and psychiatric symptoms,
caregivers (CG) are at a signiﬁcant risk of mental and
somatic health problems because of limitations in
personal needs, occupational and social obligations,
ﬁnancial burden, and restricted family life and leisure.
Subjective and objective CB needs to be assessed in
time and support should be provided on an individual
basis. Recently, COVID-19 has caused additional mul-
tifactorial distress to dependent patients and informal
and professional CG.

Introduction

A substantial number of neurological diseases lead
to chronic impairment of activities of daily living
(ADL) and dependence. Neurological patients are
cared for in their homes if impairments (motor, sen-
sory, vegetative, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, or be-
havioral deﬁcits) are manageable and if homecare
is not precluded by spatial or socioeconomic limita-
tions and support is sufﬁciently provided by family
members alone or in cooperation with professional
care persons. Otherwise, dependent patients move
to the homes of family members or nursing homes.
A need for professional care may occur unexpectedly
as a consequence of signiﬁcant deterioration of neu-
rological symptoms or steadily increasing or acute
failure of family-based homecare.
In this context,
concomitant or newly emerging non-neurological
disorders and injuries of the patient and health prob-
lems of the caregiver (CG) may play a crucial role.

Caregiving is mostly time and energy consuming
and a major challenge for CGs. Most CGs are fe-
male family members [1]. In 1986, caregiver burden
(CB) related to the care of dementia patients was
addressed for the ﬁrst time in the medical literature
[2]. Several hundred publications dealing with CB
have been listed in PubMed thus far (https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/).
In the past 20 years the
number of publications has increased exponentially.
CB has been addressed in the scientiﬁc literature
from many different countries, cultures, and from all
continents. The majority of the studies are monocen-
tric and cross-sectional, but a substantial number of
studies are longitudinal and multicentric. Some stud-
ies are transnational and cover a wider spectrum of
caregiving-related issues. Interestingly, international
comparative studies reveal differences between na-
tions in the subjective and objective burden of care for
patients with comparable diagnoses, disease severity,
and age, probably due to differences in the workload
of CGs, traditions, and medical, psychological, or
ﬁnancial support [1, 3, 4].

This article summarizes and reviews important
issues of caregiving and CB in different neurolog-
ical diagnoses and addresses recent challenges for
patients and CGs during the COVID-19 pandemic,
which have also been addressed in public media and
websites of ministries and health and care organi-
zations (www.sozialministerium.at; www.hilfswerk.at;
www.volkshilfe.at).

Neurological diagnoses leading to variable degrees

age, or in midlife, such as multiple sclerosis, cere-
bral and spinal neoplasms, Huntington’s disease, trau-
matic brain injury, and neuromuscular and chronic
pain disorders. Parkinsonian syndromes, stroke, and
dementia usually occur in late life. Onset, course,
degree, and type of dependence and need for care,
and thus CB, differ between diagnoses, age at dis-
ease onset, sex, and the presence of dementia and
behavioral abnormalities [5]. CB mainly depends on
patient- and diagnosis-related factors; moreover, on
educational and socioeconomic factors of the patient,
the relationship between the client and the CG, pro-
fessional and ﬁnancial support, and the presence of
a network of family members who contribute to care.
CG-related factors of CB, such as age, sex, health sta-
tus, and education are often underestimated or ne-
glected [6, 7]. CB is mainly subjective; however, ob-
jective criteria of CB exist, such as daily duration of
care, quality of sleep at night, psychological and so-
matic input, body mass index of the patient, degree
of dependence, severity of cognitive and behavioral
impairments, socioeconomic aspects, and support by
other persons, etc. Both objective and subjective cri-
teria of CB should be assessed systematically and in-
corporated in future concepts of public allowances.

1. Dementing illnesses are among the most frequent
and devastating diseases in old age. The preva-
lence of dementia increases exponentially from the
age of around sixty to very old age. Thirty to 50%
of very old individuals suffer from signiﬁcant neu-
rocognitive disorders including dementia, caused
by neurodegeneration, stroke, chronic vascular and
metabolic disorders of the brain, neuroinﬂamma-
tion, (repeated) traumatic brain injury, toxic sub-
stances, medication, or a combination of these eti-
ologies [4]. Depending on etiology, age at dementia
onset, dementia severity, and comorbidities, de-
mentia patients live maximum of 8–12, a mean of
around 5 years after diagnosis. Male sex, old age,
and behavioral, neuropsychiatric, and motor im-
pairment are adverse prognostic factors [5–7]. Mor-
tality is around 80% higher than in persons without
dementia ([8, 9]; https://www.dementiacarecentral.
com/aboutdementia/life-expectancy-calculator)
Most dementias start insidiously and progress re-
lentlessly. Thus, in most patients the need for care
develops slowly, except in the case where a severe
secondary disorder occurs. Daily care time and care
intensity depend on etiology, disease duration, and
severity. Medical treatment may achieve modest
temporary improvement of cognitive symptoms,
dependence, and CB [10, 11]. Neuropsychiatric
symptoms and behavioral deﬁcits in dementia ac-
cumulate mainly in the mid and late stages of de-
mentias. They are important factors of CB and also
prognostic factors of dementia [5, 7], but can be
modiﬁed by pharmacotherapy and psychoeduca-

tive measures [12]. Therefore, medical and psycho-
logical support are important.

2. Parkinson’s disease and atypical parkinsonian syn-
dromes are characterized by impairment of mobil-
ity, cognitive deterioration, neuropsychiatric and
behavioral symptoms, and depending on the diag-
noses (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy,
dementia with Lewy bodies), also signiﬁcant im-
pairments of autonomic nervous system functions
(orthostatic hypotension, collapse, with and with-
out injuries, incontinence) and sleep [13–16]. De-
pendence and CB deteriorate with disease progres-
sion. Life expectancy is mildly reduced in Parkin-
son’s disease, markedly reduced in atypical parkin-
sonian syndromes (progressive supranuclear palsy,
multiple system atrophy, corticobasal syndrome,
and dementia with Lewy bodies) [17–20]. Mainly
in atypical parkinsonian syndromes, the need for
care starts early, especially in elderly persons, and is
a major life-long challenge for CGs because of the
complexity of symptoms and impairments.

3. In contrast to diseases summarized in the previous
two paragraphs, a number of neurological disor-
ders, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, Guil-
lain–Barré syndrome, or epilepsy, occur suddenly
and may cause an acute need for care or obser-
vational accompaniment, which may cause major
distress for patients and caregiving family members
[21]. Neuro- and psychopharmacological treatment
may be effective in avoiding or reducing depen-
dence [22]. A crucial factor for partial, subtotal, or
full functional recovery from functional deﬁcits is
comprehensive neurorehabilitation [23].
In Aus-
tria, even in severely disabled patients, acute care
often needs to be taken over by family members,
depending on administrative issues or waiting lists
for free capacities in rehabilitation centers or nurs-
ing homes. Mainly in monophasic disorders such
as stroke, CB may improve, mostly within weeks
to months. Many patients, however, need perma-
nent care for the rest of their lives.
In epilepsies,
often safety measures and surveillance rather than
permanent care are needed.

4. Malignant brain tumor or motor neuron disease
(MND) often develop subacutely and progress rapid-
ly. In MND motor impairments prevail among other
neurological symptoms. Life expectancy is mean 1
to 3 years [24, 25]. Most patients with these diag-
noses are cared for by their families in their homes,
often under difﬁcult circumstances and major dis-
In
tress, supported by ambulatory palliative care.
motor neuron disease, mechanical ventilatory as-
sistance may be needed. A variable proportion of
motor neuron disease and brain tumor patients may
suffer from intellectual, neuropsychological, and
behavioral decline and communication difﬁculties
[25–27]. Brain tumors are frequently associated with
epileptic seizures.

5. Patients with chronic pain, such as neuropathic
pain, due to acute, subacute, or chronic lesions
of the central or peripheral nervous system may
depend on care if the underlying disorder causes
substantial impairment of ADL or technical sup-
port is needed, such as chronic parenteral analgesic
therapies [28].

Common features and factors of care burden

In most societies, care is mainly provided by fam-
ily members—partners, daughters or daughters-in
law, sons, and also parents, siblings, or more distant
relatives or friends [1–4, 7]—mostly by women and
mostly in the homes of the patients or in the house-
hold of the CG as long as care is manageable [29].
Apart from speciﬁc diagnoses, old age and male sex,
body weight and height, impairment of mobility and
impairments of ADL, dependence, cognitive decline,
and neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms are
important factors of CB [1–4, 7]. Frontal dysexecutive
disorders (loss of insight, reasoning, logical thinking,
etc.), behavioral impairment (hyperactivity or apa-
thy, aggression, disinhibition), and neuropsychiatric
symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, or depression,
paranoic ideation and hallucinations, and communi-
cation difﬁculties are important factors of CB [5, 7,
25, 26, 29–32]. They may attenuate in late phases of
dementing illnesses. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are
frequent in dementias, mainly in dementia related to
Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, atyp-
ical parkinsonian syndromes (corticobasal syndrome
and progressive supranuclear palsy), and frontotem-
poral dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may
vary and occur abruptly. Pharmacotherapy and psy-
choeducative measures are helpful to improve neu-
ropsychiatric symptoms, especially in acute phases
of neuropsychiatric deterioration. Nevertheless, CGs
of patients with intermittent severe neuropsychi-
atric diagnoses often need immediate comprehensive
(multidisciplinary) support.

Recent studies driven by the COVID-19 pandemic
have shown that video consultations are beneﬁcial for
patients and CGs. For technical reasons, teleradiolog-
ical consultations including video-visits may be chal-
lenging for elderly CG. However, the acceptance of
video-visits was found to be high [33]. Strainful trans-
fers to medical services can be minimized and pa-
tients and CGs can communicate with their doctors,
psychologist, physiotherapist, nurse, or social worker
in their usual familiar environment. Video-visit-based
home rehabilitation programs have been developed.
Video-visits may be less favorable for patients with
severe impairments or symptom ﬂuctuations than for
patients with stable disease [33]. In summary, video
consultations save time and seem altogether helpful
to attenuate CB.

injuries, pain, fatigue, nausea, respiratory distress,
incontinence, nocturnal sleep impairment, and con-
comitant diseases markedly deteriorate quality of life
and exacerbate CB [14, 30–32, 34].

CB does not only depend on the patient, but also
on CG-related factors such as age, sex, health status,
quality of sleep, education, occupational obligations
versus retirement, information about perspectives of
the disease and medical, social, psychological, or legal
consequences, personal competences, and support-
ive measures of the public health systems or private
care institutions. Family background, relationship be-
tween the CG and the client, space in the patient’s
home, socioeconomic parameters, and resilience of
the CG [7, 31, 32, 34–37] are further important fac-
tors of CB. In most diseases CB increases with disease
duration and progression, and with the duration of
care. However, CB may stabilize with duration of care
following adequate comprehensive support measures
and in end stages of dementing illnesses. Knowledge
about the individual needs of the patient and the CG
as well as personal, psychological, and medical sup-
port may help the CG to cope with daily challenges of
caregiving and improve the CG’s quality of life.

Scales to assess care burden and underlying factors

In most studies analyzing CB in neurological diseases,
inventories such as the Zarit CG Burden Interview
(ZCBI), the CG Strain Index (CSI), the Burden Scale
of Family CGs (BSFC), and patient- or CG-related
quality of life interviews are used [38–41]. Objective
measures of CB are less frequently applied, such as
scales assessing informal care time [42]. Most of these
inventories address speciﬁc questions about aspects
and consequences of care and factors underlying CB,
resulting in sum scores reﬂecting severity classes of
CB (mild, moderate, severe CB) [38]. In some of the
inventories, such as the ZCBI and the CSI, cut-off
scores indicate thresholds to severe CB and a high
risk of mental health problems for the CG [38, 39,
42]. CGs of neurological patients often report limita-
tions in personal needs, privacy, self-determination
(especially if patient and CG live together), strain
with regard to occupation, family and social life, neg-
ative expectations and concern about the patient’s
future, exhaustion, sleep impairment, and somatic
and mental health problems. Moreover, ﬁnancial
distress, information deﬁcits, a feeling of guilt and
incompetence in providing appropriate care, of be-
ing left alone with the client, and negative emotions
(irritation, anger) are reported [7, 26, 42]. Absence
of support by other persons, low levels of education
and income, living together with the patient, lack of
leisure and recreation, and impaired health of the CG
(psychiatric and somatic diagnoses) are determinants
of CG-related CB. Caregiving children may be more
burdened than partners because of unmet needs of
caregiving, occupation, and family, conﬂicts of inter-

main topic

ests, and loss of contacts with friends [7]. CGs often
give up their job or reduce working time, resulting in
a loss of income.

Comparison of severity of CB in neurological
diseases

In stroke patients, patients suffering from a trau-
matic injury to the nervous system, and brain tumor
patients, CB depends on the severity of functional
decline including neuropsychiatric and behavioral
deﬁcits and the coherence of caregiving persons. CB
is mostly severe in advanced stages of motor neuron
disease and brain tumor disease, similar or somewhat
milder in atypical parkinsonian syndromes [14, 24–26,
32]. Parkinson’s disease is associated with substantial
CB in advanced but not in early disease stages, early
Alzheimer’s disease with mild to moderate CB [7, 14,
25, 26] in the ﬁrst years of the disease. Nevertheless,
a substantial proportion of CGs of Alzheimer patients
have a high risk of mental health problems, such as
depression and burnout [7].

In multiple sclerosis patients, motor, vegetative (in-
continence), and neuropsychological deﬁcits, depen-
dence, and need for care determine the severity of CB
depending on the degree of functional deﬁcits [42].
In stroke patients, CB depends on motor and sensory
impairment, mobility, ADL, anxiety, and depression
[43, 44].

Which measures should be taken to prevent or to
reduce care burden?

Studies have shown that support from other family
members or formal (professional) CGs are prerequi-
sites for a CG to take a break, to have time for personal
needs such as leisure, recreation, sports, social con-
tacts, occupation, and family. Networks of dementia-
speciﬁc care institutions are very helpful in supporting
caregiving family members (such as www.alzheimer-
hilfe.at). Holidays for pairs (partners of dementia pa-
tients together with the demented client, supported
by professional CGs) are highly appreciated. CGs feel
signiﬁcantly better when caregiving is appreciated by
the client, the family, and also the public [45]. CB is
lower in families with close ties between family mem-
bers, personal support, respect, and understanding
of the CG’s needs. In pauses from care for personal
needs or obligations, family CGs need conﬁdence that
their loved one is competently cared for by other per-
sons [46]. A health psychologist should be contacted if
CGs suffer from emotional distress. Financial support
is an important issue, in particular for persons with
low income, for compensation of ﬁnancial strain, and
personal support. Exchange of personal experiences
between CGs in self-help organizations and speciﬁc
information may also attenuate CB.

In our country (Austria), public allowances for care-
giving (Pﬂegegeld) are mainly based on the average

time needed for care per week (www.oesterreich.gv.
at).
In demented persons, care is considered more
demanding than in clients with other diagnoses, so
that the allowance rates for dementia care are higher
than in other diagnoses. Nevertheless, important fac-
tors contributing to subjective and objective CB and
strain, such as behavioral abnormalities, severity, and
nature of dependence as well as CG-related factors
and the burden for the families are not speciﬁcally
reﬂected in the funding procedures. A more compre-
hensive assessment of objective and subjective CB is
required in time, to take adequate support measures,
to maintain high-quality care, and to prevent the CG
from severe CB and health problems.

Caregiving and the COVID-19 pandemic

Caregiving for senior residents in our country (Austria)
relies on informal family members and on mostly for-
eign, mainly female, professional CGs. Around 60,000
foreign professional CGs work in Austrian households
(www.ooe.arbeiterkammer.at;
www.derstandard.at,
www.ams.at). Both informal and formal CGs and
patients, as reported in detail for dementia patients,
were struck by the COVID-19 pandemic [47]. Travel
restrictions resulted in deﬁcits of professional CGs
for Austrian patients. Instead, family members often
take over care functions. Many of them also had to
cope with homeschooling and homeofﬁce. For those
persons, caregiving became extremely challenging.
Extra nursing leave was legalized. Foreign CGs who
could not return to their families remained in Austria
for longer periods of time than primarily intended.
To compensate for this extra work, public allowances
were provided by the government. CB also increased
because of hygiene measures, such as the mouth/
nose mask, which is problematic for patients who
forget the meaning of this measure and persons with
senile hearing impairment, communication deﬁcits,
or respiratory illness. Physical and social distanc-
ing including family members in nursing homes has
caused major psychological distress in patients and
therefore also in CGs (www.tnp.sg/lifestyle/health/
managing-caregiver-stress-during-covid-19). Before
vaccination became available, CGs involved in the
care for COVID-19-infected persons were at a high
risk of becoming infected. In summary, the COVID-19
pandemic is a major general stressor for CGs working
at home and in nursing homes in general, and also
for neurological patients.

Conclusion

CB is a largely underestimated issue and needs more
political and public awareness. There is no systematic
and standardized tool to assess overall (objective and
subjective) CB from the start of a care. These factors
of CB need to be assessed as early as possible to pro-
vide individualized support and to avoid a collapse

of homecare and premature admission to a nurs-
ing home. The network of multidisciplinary support
needs improvement and all possible resources need to
be integrated. Financial support (public allowances)
is often delayed or even rejected. The need for profes-
sional care increases steadily. More professional CGs
are needed, as is speciﬁc training for CGs of patients
with neurological diagnoses, in order to provide the
best possible care for clients with neurological dis-
eases.
