Abstract

Purpose of Review—We review recent evidence concerning the epidemiology, etiology, and 
treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in the perinatal period. We examine studies 
reporting on rates of both new-onset OCD and exacerbation in both pregnancy and postpartum; 
explore both biological and psychosocial risk factors for the disorder; and review the latest 
evidence concerning treatment.

Recent Findings—Evidence is limited in all areas, with rates of both OCD and subthreshold 
obsessive–compulsive symptoms varying widely across studies. Prevalence is likely higher in 
the perinatal period than in the general population. Clinical features in the perinatal period 
are more likely than at other times to concern harm to the child, with contamination and 
aggressive obsessions and cleaning and checking compulsions especially common. Research 
into the biological etiology is too limited at this time to be definitive. Both observational and 
randomized controlled trials support cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response

prevention (CBT with ERP) as a first-line treatment, with limited evidence also supporting the use 
of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Treatment considerations in the perinatal period 
must weigh the risks of treatment vs. the risks of untreated illness.

Summary—Perinatal OCD is common and can be impairing. Clinical features differ somewhat 
compared to non-perinatal periods. Treatment does not differ from that used in the general 
population, though evidence pertaining specifically to the perinatal period is sparse.

Introduction

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, sometimes debilitating, and under-
recognized psychiatric illness, affecting approximately 1–2% of the population (and a larger 
group with sub-threshold symptoms) [1–3]. Clinical features include unbidden intrusive 
thoughts or images (obsessions), often accompanied by mental or physical rituals designed 
to lessen the distress of the obsessions. OCD shares with anxiety disorders a higher 
prevalence among women compared to men (about 1.6 times) [3, 4], and considerable 
research points to increased incidence and prevalence at times of reproductive transition 
[5–7]. The perinatal period is a time of especially increased vulnerability, not only for 
the disorder, but also for sub-threshold symptoms [8–11]. In one study, fully 65% of new 
parents reported experiencing intrusive thoughts, though for many these were fleeting and 
did not affect function [5, 12]. In addition, obsessions are a common feature of other mood 
and anxiety disorders arising in the perinatal period [13].

An understanding of perinatal OCD is a critical skill for clinicians who treat pregnant 
and postpartum women. Perinatal OCD has adverse effects for both mother and child. 
Pregnancies affected by OCD have a higher risk for adverse obstetrical and neonatal 
outcomes (including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, poor fetal growth, preterm 
birth, and elevated inflammatory markers in the neonate) [14–17]. Women with perinatal 
OCD report poorer quality of life, greater distress, and lower maternal responsiveness [18, 
19].

While the disorder resembles OCD at other points in the lifetime, there are some unique 
clinical features, and evaluation that does not account for these nuances will often miss OCD 
and attribute symptoms instead to mood or anxiety disorders, with which there are crucial 
differences in treatment. In addition, the intrusive thoughts of OCD can be mistaken for 
the delusions of postpartum psychosis, leading either to a failure to recognize the latter (a 
psychiatric emergency) or, more usually, to a misinterpretation and overreaction to OCD, 
which can lead to inappropriate actions that may include a higher level of care than is 
warranted and/or involvement of child services.

This article offers a brief overview of the current understanding of perinatal OCD, focusing 
on epidemiology and phenomenology, etiology, and treatment.

Epidemiology and Phenomenology

While exact numbers differ across studies, there is considerable evidence that the perinatal 
period is a time of risk for both new-onset OCD and exacerbation of existing OCD. Rates 
for new-onset OCD in pregnancy range from 2 to 22%, [2, 11, 20–25], with evidence 
indicating somewhat higher risk in the postpartum (from 2 to 24%) [8–10, 26]. In addition, 
studies have shown that 8–70% of women with existing OCD will experience perinatal 
exacerbations [7, 25, 27–30]. A recent article that carefully characterized women using 
strict diagnostic criteria found a period prevalence of 7.8% in pregnancy and 16.9% in the 
postpartum [31].

The clinical features of perinatal OCD have both similarities to and differences from 
OCD in the general population. As with general OCD, the disorder is characterized 
by obsessions (intrusive thoughts, ideas, images or impulses), compulsions (repetitive or 
ritualistic behaviors), or both. To meet criteria for the disorder (as opposed to subthreshold 
symptoms), the symptoms must affect functioning by being very time-consuming or causing 
clinically significant distress, and cannot be explained by a different condition [32]. Unique 
to the perinatal period, obsessions often center on infant harm; aggressive intrusive thoughts 
of infant harm are especially common in the postpartum [5, 7, 33]. Some literature shows 
that obsessions that begin in pregnancy are likely to focus on contamination and can be 
accompanied by cleaning and washing compulsions, while postpartum onset obsessions 
are more likely to focus on infant harm and be accompanied by checking and avoiding 
compulsions [33–35].

Thoughts of infant harm in particular can be graphic (including violent or sexual images) 
and extremely distressing. They cause acute suffering in the mother, and many women 
are reluctant to disclose such thoughts to a healthcare provider. It is therefore critically 
important for clinicians to ask specifically and non-judgmentally about intrusive thoughts. 
It is also of critical importance that clinicians understand how to distinguish between these 
ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts (which are horrifying to the mother) and the ego-syntonic 
thoughts of infant harm that can be a feature of postpartum psychosis [36].

Compulsions in the perinatal period are mostly likely to take two forms, in keeping with 
the most common types of obsessions: contamination-related rituals (such as cleaning and 
sterilizing baby equipment) and checking or ordering rituals (such as repeated checking on 
a sleeping infant), with checking the most common perinatal compulsion [33]. If obsessions 
are extreme, they can also lead to avoidance—for example, the woman who fears dropping 
her child out the window may avoid all windows, and the woman who has images of her 
child being stabbed may refuse to use knives or enter the kitchen. Most compulsions and 
avoidances do not directly harm the child, but in extreme cases, they can— for example, 
the woman who cleans her child too vigorously or using inappropriate household cleaning 
products, or the woman who so avoids her child that neglect is the result. Even when 
symptoms are not extreme, however, they can have deleterious effects on both mother and 
child by impairing mother–child bonding and attachment [18]. Impairments in attachment 
can, of course, affect child temperament and fussiness in the short term and can also lead to 
a lifelong vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.

Perinatal OCD is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, and it is important for 
clinicians to understand how to distinguish a mood or anxiety disorder (possibly with 
sub-threshold obsessions) from OCD, as treatment differs. The most common mis-diagnoses 
are generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and perinatal depression. While both disorders can 
present with worry and rumination, which can be confused with obsessions, the content 
of such thoughts in GAD and depression is generally tied to reallife circumstances; in 
other words, exaggerated levels of distress surrounding things that are actually happening or 
will happen. Such worries and ruminations generally shift over time. In perinatal OCD, by 
contrast, intrusive thoughts center on senseless and irrational events and do not shift over 
time [37].

While it is important to distinguish perinatal OCD from mood and anxiety disorders because 
of differences in treatment, it is even more important to distinguish it from the psychiatric 
emergency postpartum psychosis, which can also present with thoughts of infant harm. 
Women with OCD have preserved insight, are extremely distressed by their thoughts, and 
will protect or even avoid their infants to prevent harm. Women with postpartum psychosis, 
by contrast, have delusional beliefs without insight [18, 38, 39]. This crucial distinction 
means that women with postpartum psychosis are at elevated risk of infant harm, while those 
with OCD are not [40]. Women with postpartum psychosis nearly always require inpatient 
hospitalization and alternate care for their infants, and the involvement of social services to 
ensure the protection of the child is often necessary. Women with OCD, on the other hand, 
are more appropriately treated in outpatient or partial hospital settings that do not require 
separation from their babies, and it is rarely necessary to involve social services for the 
protection of the child (see Table 1).

The etiology of perinatal OCD at this time is poorly understood, but it is clear that 
there are both psychosocial and biological contributors. Some studies report that obstetric 
complications and mode of delivery may affect risk [2, 14, 41–43], but this is not a 
consistent finding. A personal or family history of mood disorders increases risk [27, 
44], as does the presence of dysfunctional obsessive beliefs or an avoidant or obsessive–
compulsive personality [5, 23, 45]. Primiparity is a known risk factor and may be due in 
part to biological influences and in part to the new responsibilities associated with the role 
transition of new motherhood [45].

Research into the biological etiology of perinatal OCD is very much in its infancy. A 
large-scale multi-site trial currently underway (NIMH R01MH11824) may, in a few years, 
increase our understanding of the biology. In the meantime, we must look to the overlap 
between research on general OCD and that on perinatal mood and anxiety disorders to 
come up with some plausible hypotheses about the biological origins of perinatal OCD. 
Genetic contributions have been examined in both general OCD and perinatal depression 
in the genes for MAO-A, BDNF, and the estrogen and oxytocin receptors, but with no 
clear consistent findings [46]. Polymorphisms in two genes (5-HTTLPR and COMT) have 
more consistently been implicated in both general OCD and perinatal depression and so 
may have more applicability to perinatal OCD [46–48]. Epigenetic biomarkers have been

established that predict the exacerbation of OCD symptoms during pregnancy, and this 
remains a promising future area of research [49, 50].

The immune system is one plausible area of research for the biological etiology of perinatal 
OCD. There are substantial immune changes in even healthy pregnancy, to prevent the 
rejection by the mother of the fetus, and immune dysregulation has been implicated in 
various perinatal morbidities (including mood and anxiety disorders) as well as in general 
OCD [51–54]. Due to inconsistencies in measurement tools (both of psychiatric diagnoses 
and of immune markers), however, it is too early to say definitively whether immune 
dysregulation will prove a strong component.

The same inconclusive conclusion must be applied at this stage to other biological systems. 
Dysregulation of several neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, glutamate, and 
GABA, has also been suggested for both general OCD and perinatal mood and anxiety 
disorders, making these systems possible targets for future research in perinatal OCD [55–
60]. The stress response system may also be involved, with some research showing that 
women with postpartum OCD have higher levels of basal salivary cortisol than do healthy 
postpartum controls [61]. Finally, reproductive and other hormones (including estrogen, 
progesterone, thyroid hormone, and oxytocin) are also ripe areas for future research in 
perinatal OCD, as all have been examined in perinatal mood and anxiety disorders.

Sleep deprivation may also prove to be a promising future avenue of research. General 
OCD has been associated with disturbed sleep [62, 63]. All postpartum women experience 
significant sleep disruption, and those vulnerable to OCD may be more sensitive to such 
disruption [10, 64–66]. Postpartum obsessions involving fear of harm coming to the baby 
may make it difficult for women to sleep even when they have the chance, while postpartum 
compulsions such as checking and cleaning may use up time that could otherwise be spent 
sleeping [64, 67].

As OCD symptoms can be debilitating and can impair the functioning of the entire family, 
it is vital to recognize and treat them. Unfortunately, there is little research on treatment of 
OCD specific to the perinatal period, and there are no specific treatment guidelines. There 
is no reason to expect that perinatal OCD will respond differently to treatment than general 
OCD, but without more research specific to this population, we cannot be certain.

In the perinatal period, treatment requires a careful consideration of the risks of treatment 
compared to the risks of no treatment. The risks attaching to psychotropic drugs have been 
studied extensively at this point, and while there are no randomized controlled trials to guide 
our treatment choices there is a large and largely reassuring body of observational literature. 
Studies that use appropriate control groups show few (though not absent) risks associated 
with the medications most commonly used for OCD. It is imperative for clinicians to view 
this information in the light of known information about the risks to mother, child, and 
family of NOT treating the illness. Although there is little research specific to the risks of 
untreated perinatal OCD, we know that perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, as well as

other types of stress and distress in pregnancy, are associated with substantial risk, including 
relapse of psychiatric illness for the mother; preterm birth; and deficits in cognitive and 
emotional development of the child [68–72]. It is therefore prudent to use for the perinatal 
OCD patient a treatment approach that best minimizes risk—by using the lowest effective 
dose of as few medications as possible. In other words, if it is possible to get the mother 
well without medication, do that—but if not, treat her and do not be stingy with dosage. 
Treating her with lower doses than are effective just exposes the baby to both the illness and 
the medications, while treating to remission creates FEWER exposures for the baby (see Fig. 
1).

Nonpharmacological Approaches

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the only therapy with evidence to support its 
effectiveness in OCD [73]. CBT with exposure and response prevention (ERP) has the 
most evidence [74–76] and should be considered the first-line treatment. While numerous 
randomized-controlled trials support the use of CBT with ERP in the general population, 
evidence for the perinatal period specifically is largely limited to observational trials, all 
of which report improvement in a limited number of patients without a comparator group 
[77–81]. One recent trial randomized patients with postpartum OCD to intensive CBT vs. 
treatment as usual and found a significant reduction in OCD symptoms in the intervention 
group [82]. Treatment guidelines from the general population can be applied in perinatal 
OCD, with 13–20 weekly sessions followed by a 3–6-month period of booster sessions.

While CBT with ERP is the only evidence-based psychotherapeutic approach, other forms 
of therapy can be useful for some of the symptoms of perinatal OCD. Family therapy, 
supportive therapy, motivational interviewing, and dialectical behavioral therapy can be 
helpful at alleviating distress caused by symptoms, especially for patients who are unable to 
engage in CBT with ERP due to the severe distress caused by their symptoms [73]. These 
are, however, stop-gap measures—and the patient who does not benefit from or cannot 
engage in CBT with ERP will likely require psychopharmacological treatment.

Pharmacological Treatment

The FDA has approved the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline as well as the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) 
clomipramine for OCD, and all are considered first-line agents [32] that are compatible 
with pregnancy and lactation. Escitalopram and citalopram are also efficacious and can 
be used despite the lack of FDA indication [83–85]. Monotherapy with one of these 
agents should be attempted first, and as always in the perinatal period, it is important to 
maximize one drug before adding a second, to reduce the number of exposures for the fetus 
or breastfeeding infant. As OCD generally requires higher doses than mood and anxiety 
disorders—and as pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy result in plasma concentration 
drops of 40–50% by the end of pregnancy—doses may need to be much higher than most 
clinicians are accustomed to in order to be efficacious. Modest evidence also supports 
second-line approaches, including augmentation with antipsychotics and venlafaxine and 
mirtazapine monotherapy [86–92].

FDA approval and evidence for the treatments listed above is based on non-perinatal 
patients, and only open-label trials exist during the perinatal period; efficaciousness in these 
few trials is largely consistent with that from the general population [44, 79, 93–95]. As with 
the general population, treatment should be continued for 1–2 years before considering a 
gradual taper [73]. There is no reason to alter this in the perinatal period, as the relatively 
benign risks and side effect profiles of the approved drugs make them compatible with 
pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Other Somatic Interventions

Transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep-brain stimulation and other neurosurgical 
approaches, and electroconvulsive therapy have all been investigated for general OCD. 
The significant morbidity associated with these, as well as the small amount of evidence 
supporting their efficacy (including none in the perinatal period), makes them inadvisable 
for pregnant and postpartum women in all but the most egregiously treatment-refractory 
cases.

Conclusions

OCD in the perinatal period is common and often misdiagnosed. Incidence and prevalence 
rates differ widely across studies, but most literature indicates at the least a modest increase 
in risk during pregnancy and especially postpartum. While clinical features can resemble 
those of OCD in the general population, symptoms are often centered around thoughts of 
infant harm (either direct or indirect), and at their most severe can induce significant distress 
in mothers and at times lead to avoidance or even neglect of the child. Etiology is poorly 
understood, though prior history of mood or anxiety disorders and certain personality types 
enhance risk. There may be both genetic and epigenetic risk factors, and growing but still 
quite limited evidence points to dysregulation in the stress response system, the immune 
system, and the neuroendocrine system. Women with OCD rarely act on intrusive thoughts 
of child harm (unlike those with postpartum psychosis), and most can be appropriately 
treated on an outpatient basis. CBT with ERP and SSRIs are both first-line treatments, but 
few data exist on unique features of treatment in the perinatal period. Research into all 
aspects of this common and debilitating disorder has lagged behind those of other perinatal 
mood and anxiety disorders.
