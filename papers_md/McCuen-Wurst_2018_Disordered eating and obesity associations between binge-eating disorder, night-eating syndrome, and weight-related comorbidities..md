Abstract

Binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES) are two forms of disordered eating 
associated with overweight and obesity. While these disorders also occur in non-obese persons, 
they seem to be associated with weight gain over time and higher risk of diabetes and other 
metabolic dysfunction. BED and NES are also associated with higher risk of psychopathology, 
including mood, anxiety, and sleep problems, than those of similar weight status without 
disordered eating. Treatments are available, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), 
interpersonal psychotherapy, lisdexamfetamine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) for BED; and CBT, SSRIs, progressive muscle relaxation, and bright light therapy for 
NES.

Introduction

Disordered eating spans the spectrum of over-controlled eating, resulting in anorexia 
nervosa, to a variety of forms of under-controlled eating such as bulimia nervosa and binge-
eating disorder (BED), or night-eating syndrome (NES), which causes eating when humans 
are meant to be fasting. Two of these disorders (i.e., BED and NES) are often comorbid with 
overweight and obesity. We will review these disorders here, along with their relation to 
psychosocial and metabolic correlates.

Binge Eating Disorder

Definition

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th edition,1 
BED is defined by several criteria. Individuals must report consuming an unusually large 
amount of food in a short duration (compared to what others may consume in a similar 
situation) in addition to experiencing a loss of control over one’s eating behavior during this 
time. In addition, at least three of the following characteristics must also be present: 
consuming food much more rapidly than normal, eating food until uncomfortably full, 
consuming large amounts of food when not hungry, consuming food alone to avoid 
embarrassment, or feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty after the eating event. The 
diagnosis also requires that a significant amount of distress be associated with the binge 
episodes, which must occur at least once per week for 3 months or more (on average). 
Lastly, the disorder must not be accompanied by any regular compensatory behavior, nor 
should the binge eating occur solely during an episode of bulimia nervosa or anorexia 
nervosa.

BED affects an estimated 1–3% of the general population, making it the most common 
eating disorder.2–3 Method of assessment is clinical interview or self-report questionnaire, 
with the latter generally identifying a higher prevalence.4–5 Lifetime risk of BED diagnosis 
is higher among women than men,2 however men who are diagnosed experience equal 
impairment.6 Also at a higher risk are those under the age of 30 compared to older 
individuals.2 Prevalence among varying ethnicities is somewhat unclear, with studies finding 
different racial/ethnic prevalence estimates,7 and other studies suggesting no significant 
difference between whites and minorities.8 Typical age of onset of the disorder is between 
15.5–27.2 years old with the average duration lasting between 4–8 years.2–3

Prevalence

Comorbidities

Those with BED have a high prevalence of psychiatric and physical comorbidities. Nearly 
80% of those with lifetime BED have suffered from another DSM disorder including mood, 
anxiety, substance use, and eating disorders.2,9 In addition to psychiatric concerns, BED is 
independently associated with increased risk of physical comorbidities including chronic 
diabetes, hypertension, back/neck pain, chronic headaches, and other types of chronic pain.2

Obesity and weight-related factors

Those with BED are an estimated 3–6 times more likely to be obese than those without an 
eating disorder.2–3 BED is also associated with an earlier onset of being overweight8 and 
history of obesity, with about 30% of those with BED reporting childhood obesity.10 
Additionally, negative talk regarding shape, weight, and eating from family members,11 
body shape concerns, and cycling of weight12 are all also correlated with a BED diagnosis. 
Binge eating is more prevalent among those seeking weight loss approaches compared to 
those who are not, with between 9–29% of those reporting binge episodes.8, 13–15. However, 
only 1–2% of those seeking weight loss treatment meet full DSM criteria for BED13–15.

Among bariatric surgery patients the prevalence is much higher; prevalence rates of those 
seeking bariatric surgery who meet clinical diagnosis for BED range from 4.2%5 to 47%16, 
depending upon method of assessment.

In addition to the prevalence of obesity among those with BED, the disorder itself is 
associated with a variety of weight-related comorbidities. Certain evidence suggests that 
BED, perhaps due to eating behaviors adapted by those with the disorder, may pose as a risk 
factor for metabolic syndrome aside from obesity alone.9 Metabolic syndrome labels a 
cluster of risk factors associated with increased risk for heart disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, 
and other cardiovascular problems,17 making it a public health concern. Prevalence of BED 
among those with type 2 diabetes is projected to range from 1.4%15 to 25.6%,18 with 
increasing prevalence among those with a higher body mass index (BMI).15,19 Additionally, 
differences in prevalence of metabolic syndrome among those with BED exist among 
genders and ethnicities; men and African Americans with BED have a higher risk of 
developing components of metabolic syndrome such as increased systolic blood pressure, 
fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c and triglycerides, and reduced high density lipoprotein 
levels compared to women and other ethnicities.20 In a longitudinal study over the course of 
5 years, those with BED who were obese had over two times the chance of developing a new 
diagnosis of dyslipidemia compared to a non-BED matched sample,21 suggesting a link 
between the disorder and certain components of metabolic syndrome, aside from the risks 
presented solely from obesity alone.21 However, rates of metabolic syndrome among those 
with obesity and BED versus those with obesity alone have been shown to be comparable, 
around 60%.21–22 Recently, BED was found to be strongly associated with diabetes (five-
fold increased risk) and components of the metabolic syndrome (two-fold increased risk) 
among participants of the Swedish National Registers.23 Further, those with obesity and 
BED were at increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases as compared to those 
without these disorders. More research is needed to further evaluate the relationship between 
metabolic syndrome and BED, apart from the effects of obesity alone.

Psychopathology

There are several explanatory models of binge eating pathology. One of the first theories of 
binge eating, the restraint model, explains binge eating as originating from shape and weight 
concerns, which lead to dietary restraint, then binge eating, followed by an ongoing cycle of 
restraint and binge eating.24–25 Some studies have provided further support for this model, 
showing dietary restraint is associated with increased binge eating episodes among those 
with BED,26–27 while other studies have shown dietary restraint precedes binge eating only 
about half of the time.28 Those with BED tend to eat more often, eat higher calorie meals,29 
and have more frequent weight fluctuations compared to those with other eating disorders,8 
all behaviors which are consistent with the restraint model. This model could also help 
explain the higher prevalence of binge eating among people seeking behavioral weight loss, 
because those patients may be seeking methods to implement dietary restraint successfully, 
which is something they may not have been able to accomplish on their own without 
experiencing binge episodes. Two newer models are the affect regulation model and escape 
theory. The affect regulation model describes binge eating as a distracting coping 
mechanism used to reduce negative feelings. This behavior is then thought to be maintained

by the reinforcing reduction in negative affect through binge eating30, despite evidence of no 
actual reduction in negative affect.31–32 Escape theory explains binge eating as a strategy 
used to avoid self-awareness and redirect attention towards the binge eating instead of the 
stressor. This is thought to occur in an effort to avoid one’s own feelings and thoughts and 
instead focus attention on the stimulus at hand,33 i.e., the experience of eating.

Treatment

Treatment for BED largely targets the behavioral, psychological, and physical outcomes 
related to the disorder.34–35 According to several meta-analyses and reviews, 
psychotherapies, specifically cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) based approaches, are 
widely considered the most effective intervention for BED. However, other methods of 
treatment, including weight loss and pharmacological treatments are proven effective in 
treating certain BED outcomes in specific populations.34–36

Psychotherapies—CBT based interventions are based on the restraint model which, as 
previously discussed, theorize that unhealthy eating, shape, and weight concerns give rise to 
food restriction. This initial restriction then leads to a cyclical pattern of restriction and 
binge eating.25 CBT based interventions aim to stop this cycle by addressing abnormal 
thoughts and behaviors regarding eating, shape, and weight that trigger binge eating and by 
developing healthier responses to these triggers.37 A meta-analysis by Vocks et al.35 
concluded that therapist-led CBT was more effective than untreated control groups in 
reducing binge eating frequency, decreasing days with binge eating, increasing binge eating 
abstinence, and also reducing depression, concern with weight, and concern with eating. 
CBT however, was not effective in reducing dietary restraint scores, shape concern, or 
weight. Self-help forms of CBT were effective in the same domains, except in reducing days 
with binge eating and depressive symptoms, but with the additional benefits of decreased 
dietary restraint scores and shape concern.35 A meta-analysis by Brownley et al.34 found 
therapist-led CBT to be more effective than a waitlist condition: increasing binge abstinence 
but not reducing binge-eating frequency, eating-related obsessions and compulsions, 
depressive symptoms, or weight-related outcomes.35 The American Psychological 
Association and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend both 
therapist-led and self-help forms of CBT for treating the behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of the disorder as the first line approach, with interpersonal therapy (IPT) and 
dialectical behavior therapy as potential psychological alternatives.36, 38

IPT, one of these psychotherapies, is based on the belief that binge eating is used as a coping 
mechanism to escape negative affect created by poor interpersonal social functioning.39 In a 
randomized control trial (n = 90) comparing the long term efficacy of CBT compared to IPT, 
the two treatments showed similar efficacy with a total of 64.4% of participants achieving 
full recovery at the 4 year follow-up. CBT participants achieved a higher percentage of 
recovery post-treatment (81.8%) compared to IPT participants (64.4%); however, at 4 year 
follow-up CBT participants decreased in full-recovery (52.0%) and IPT participants 
improved in full-recovery (76.7%).40 Overall, CBT is still recommended first, as it works 
most rapidly, but IPT seems to be a promising second line approach or perhaps may be a

good match for those with binge eating consistent with the escape theory of BED; but more 
research is needed regarding matching therapies with different phenotypes of the disorder.

Behavioral weight loss—While psychotherapies are often recommended as the first line 
of treatment, they are often not successful at achieving weight loss.34–35 Behavioral weight 
loss (BWL) treats the disorder by targeting the excess weight that is often pervasive among 
the BED population.2–3 Randomized control trials (RCT’s) examining BWL are limited; 
however, the meta-analysis Vocks et al.35 of uncontrolled studies showed a moderate effect 
size of BWL on binge eating frequency and weight pre-and post-treatment. In one RCT of 
125 participants with obesity and BED, mean percent BMI loss was significantly greater 
among those who received BWL (−2.1) compared to CBT (−0.9) or CBT combined with 
BWL (1.5) post treatment.41 However, binge frequency was significantly reduced through 6- 
and 12-month follow-up in the CBT group compared to BWL group,41 suggesting the BWL 
intervention’s effect on binge eating may be less durable.

Pharmacological treatments—Common forms of pharmacotherapy include 
antidepressants, antiepileptic medications, anti-obesity medications, and stimulant 
medications (typically used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder),42 with 
lisdexamfetamine being the only currently approved drug by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration for treating BED.34 The meta-analysis by Vocks et al. found a significant 
effect of pharmacological treatments compared to control groups on reduction of days with 
binge eating, depressive symptoms, and a mild effect on binge eating abstinence.35 The 
meta-analysis by Brownley et al. found compared to placebo, lisdexamfetamine and second-
generation antidepressants (SGA’s) (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) 
resulted in greater abstinence from binge eating and less eating-related obsessions and 
compulsions.34 Additionally, SGA’s were significantly more effective in reducing depressive 
symptoms than placebo, while lisdexamfetamine and topiramate showed greater reductions 
in weight compared to placebo.34 With pharmacological treatments, it is important to note 
the presence of potential side-effects associated with treatment. Brownley et al. found 80% 
of the studies included in their meta-analysis reported harms, compared to none from the 
psychological treatment studies.34 From the studies included in this analysis, reported side 
effects for topiramate and SSRIs include insomnia, sleep disturbances, headaches, 
gastrointestinal upset, and sympathetic nervous system arousal, which are not uncommon.34

Summary

In sum, BED occurs in persons across the weight spectrum, but its prevalence increases with 
BMI. BED is comorbid with somatic disorders, including diabetes and the components of 
the metabolic syndrome. Binge-eating is often used to reduce distress related life stress or 
internal dysphoria, and it may also be related to chronic efforts of food restriction. 
Efficacious treatments for BED include CBT, BWL, and pharmacotherapy, such as 
lisdexamfetamine and SSRIs.

Night-eating syndrome

Definition

The other prominent form of disordered eating related to overweight and obesity is NES. 
NES was first described by Stunkard, Grace, and Wolff among a group of individuals with 
obesity seeking weight loss treatment.43 They reported that those with the syndrome 
consumed a large majority of their caloric intake (25% or more) at a time when individuals 
without obesity would not be eating. In addition, the patients experienced insomnia and 
morning anorexia. Most of the patients with night-eating syndrome reported that they 
experienced symptoms during times of weight gain and life stress.43 Since this time, the 
definition of NES has varied. For example, in later years, Stunkard’s definition was 
expanded to include nocturnal ingestions.44

NES is characterized by recurrent episodes of night-eating, which is described as either 
excessive food consumption in the evening (after dinnertime, i.e., evening hyperphagia) or 
eating after awakening from sleep (i.e., nocturnal ingestions). NES is also characterized by 
at least three of the following symptoms: morning anorexia, the presence of a strong urge to 
eat between dinner and sleep and/or during the night, sleep onset and/or maintenance 
insomnia, frequently depressed mood or mood worsening in the evening, and a belief that 
one cannot get back to sleep without eating.44–45 In order to be diagnosed with NES, 
individuals must be aware of and be able to recall the eating episodes. These symptoms must 
also cause significant distress and/or impairment in functioning and not be better explained 
by external factors or another disorder, such as a sleeping disorder or other disordered eating 
pattern.1 NES is classified in the DSM 5 as an “other specified feeding or eating disorder.”

Prevalence, demographics, and comorbidities

The prevalence of NES is estimated at 1.5% in the general population in the United States, 
which is similar to binge-eating disorder and higher than more traditionally recognized 
eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.46–48 Although not all 
persons with NES are overweight or obese, the syndrome is more frequently found in obese 
populations.49–50 In a population-based twin study in Sweden, NES was 2.5 times more 
prevalent in males with obesity and 2.8 times more prevalent in females with obesity as 
compared to non-obese men and women.51 In a 2003 review conducted by de Zwaan, 
Burgard, Schenck, and Mitchell,52 NES prevalence was found to be between 6–64% among 
obese persons seeking weight loss surgery. Other studies have found up to 55% of 
individuals who seek bariatric surgery report some symptoms of NES.53

NES typically begins during early adulthood (late teens to late twenties) and appears to be 
long lasting with periods of remission and relapse, often tied to life stressors.54–55 In one age 
and gender population survey, similar proportions of males and females reported waking at 
night to eat.56 However, in an interview-based study of NES among Swedish Twin Registry 
participants, fewer men than women met full criteria for NES, possibly due to low levels of 
distress associated with their NES symptoms.57 This may suggest that both men and women 
experience NES symptoms equally, but women are more negatively affected. The prevalence 
of NES and associated features in various racial groups is not well characterized, although a

wide number of studies have included Caucasian, Hispanic, African-American and Pima 
Indian ethic and racial group.49

NES is more common among people with insomnia, eating disorders, and other psychiatric 
disorders.49 Individuals diagnosed with NES are more likely than those in the general 
population to have another eating disorder with prevalence estimates ranging from 5–44%.49 
Approximately 15–20% of patients with NES also have BED. Although there are some 
overlapping symptoms between NES and BED, it has been suggested that the disorders can 
be differentiated by the amount of food eaten per episode, as well as the motivation to eat 
(i.e., in NES, the motive is to achieve sleep) and level of concern regarding shape and 
weight.45,58

NES prevalence also increases with BMI in psychiatric populations. In a study conducted by 
Lundgren and colleagues, participants were recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics.59 
The night eating questionnaire (NEQ)60 was used to screen broadly for morning anorexia, 
food cravings in the evening, number of awakenings, and nocturnal ingestions, followed by a 
clinical interview. The Night Eating Syndrome History and Inventory was subsequently used 
to diagnose NES. The researchers found that 12.3% of the study population met criteria for 
NES. In addition, those with NES were more likely to have obesity.

NES can cause sleep disturbances, but sleep disturbances and insomnia may also precede 
NES. Studies have found that patients with NES have difficulties initiating and maintaining 
sleep.50 Agents of sleep disturbances in individuals with NES may include nocturnal 
ingestions and insomnia. Although NES is largely characterized by nocturnal ingestions, 
these episodes also occur in sleep related eating disorder (SRED). This disorder is 
characterized by recurrent episodes of involuntary eating and drinking during sleep. It is 
considered a parasomnia rather than an eating disorder.50 NES and SRED can be 
differentiated by a lower level of consciousness while eating, as well as the consumption of 
unusual subtances with SRED.61

Psychopathology

The cause of NES is unknown, but research suggests links to genetics and neurobiological 
and psychological processes. In a study conducted by Lamerz and colleagues, German 
children were more likely to report night eating if their mothers exhibited night eating 
behavior, as compared to children of mothers who did not engage in this behavior.62 Also, in 
a study comparing night eating in families with NES to those without, the probability of an 
individual with NES having a first degree relative with the disorder was greater than those in 
the control group, suggesting heritability.63 In fact, among participants in the Swedish Twin 
Registry, heritability of night eating symptoms was.64

The literature suggests that NES is exacerbated during times of major life stress. This 
finding has led researchers to examine the role of cortisol and other stress hormones in night 
eating. Cortisol is a hormone released by the adrenal cortex in response to stress that has 
been associated with overeating and weight gain.65–66 In a study conducted by Birketvedt 
and colleagues, 12 participants with NES and 21 control participants were fed fixed meals at 
regular intervals over a 24 hour period with no food after 8:00 PM.67 Blood drawn every 2 h

over 24 h showed that cortisol levels were highest from 8:00 AM until 2:00 AM in night 
eaters, as compared to individuals in the control group. This finding led researchers to 
hypothesize that NES may be associated with a dysregulation of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis, which controls the cortisol stress response.68

In 1955, Stunkard and colleagues suggested that major life stress worsened symptoms of 
night eating and removing that person from a stressful environment would alleviate 
symptoms.43 More recent studies have found that stress, as well as psychiatric disorders, 
such as depression, are often associated with the initial onset of night eating and 
maintenance of the disorder.47 Additionally, researchers are now suggesting that emotions 
and cognitions may play a major role in the onset and maintenance of NES. Nocturnal 
episodes may be maintained by possessing the belief that one cannot sleep without eating, as 
well as the desire to control the anxiety associated with that belief.69–70

Association with obesity, disordered feeding, and metabolism

NES appears to be associated with obesity. As mentioned earlier, previous studies suggest 
that the syndrome is more common among weight loss treatment seeking individuals.49 NES 
may also be associated with weight gain. Marshall and colleagues compared the 
characteristics of people with obesity and NES and those of individuals without obesity or 
the disorder. Twenty-one patients with obesity were included in the study which included a 
clinical interview, while 80 patients completed the NEQ on the Internet.54 The participants 
were separated into three groups: 40 participants with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 completing 
the NEQ on the internet, 40 participants with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 completing the 
NEQ on the internet, and 21 participants with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 who completed a 
clinical interview. The study found that there were remarkable similarities between the 
internet-based participants without obesity and those with obesity on their total and 
individual item NEQ scores. The most important difference between the two groups was that 
the non-obese individuals with NES were 8.9 years younger than the obese group, 
suggesting that NES may contribute to the development of obesity.54 These results are also 
in line with the finding that night eating severity is correlated with a higher BMI in middle-
aged, but not young adults.71

Other studies suggest that obesity and weight gain are not necessarily associated with NES. 
In a cross-sectional observational study examining 266 participants with class II-III obesity 
either with or without NES, the researchers found that NES was non-significantly associated 
with higher BMI. There were also no differences in metabolic complications or 
psychological features, with the exception of depression.72 However, given that all patients 
were obese, there could be a ceiling effect. In a nationally representative population study in 
Denmark, NES, as indicated by endorsement of “getting up at night to eat”, was not 
associated with weight gain during the previous or following 5 years. However, women with 
obesity and NES gained more weight than women with obesity but without the disorder, 
suggesting that getting up at night to eat may contribute to additional weight gain in 
individuals with obesity.56

Delays in usual daytime eating patterns increase the risk of metabolic syndrome.73–74 
Research suggests that NES has a prevalence of 9.7% in those with diabetes, and those with

Treatment

symptoms of night eating have substandard metabolic control (elevated A1C) and two or 
more diabetes related complications.75 In another study conducted by Hood and colleagues, 
194 participants with type 2 diabetes showed that 7% of the sample met criteria for NES. 
Night eating was also correlated with poorer glycemic control, which could be a result of the 
food choices made by individuals with night eating, including high carbohydrate and high 
fat foods.76

Several treatment approaches have been tested for NES. Psychotherapy has shown efficacy 
in reducing night eating symptoms. Allison and colleagues developed a CBT approach that 
was administered in a pilot study to 25 patients over 12 weeks.77 The intervention included 
building rapport, providing education about CBT, self-monitoring of sleep and eating 
disturbances and negative thoughts, regulation of eating and sleep patterns, development of 
coping skills, and, for those with overweight or obesity, behavioral weight management. At 
the conclusion of the study, the participants showed significant reductions in caloric intake 
in the evening (after dinner), nocturnal ingestions and awakenings at night and 
improvements in mood and quality of life. They also lost a modest but statistically 
significant amount of weight (3.1 kg).77

Pharmacological treatments have also been examined, as NES research has suggested that 
the serotonin system plays a role in regulating eating, sleep, and mood, all components of 
NES. The hypothesized decrease in serotonin availability in NES would lead to disturbances 
in circadian rhythms and a decrease in satiety, thereby increasing risk of evening 
hyperphagia and nocturnal ingestions.78 Therefore, increasing postsynaptic serotonergic 
activity by blocking the serotonin reuptake transporter by use of SSRIs may be effective in 
treatment NES. The first clinical trial examining the efficacy of pharmacotherapy was a 12-
week, open label study of 17 participants treated with the SSRI sertraline.79 Two additional 
trials with sertraline followed, including an RCT. The three studies showed significant 
reductions in awakenings, nocturnal ingestions, and caloric intake after the evening meal,
79–81 including a response rate of 67% and a remission rate of 29% with sertraline.79 Those 
who achieved remission also lost a significant amount of weight (−4.8 kg). In the RCT, those 
with overweight and obesity lost an average of −2.9 kg compared to those receiving the 
placebo.76 The researchers noted that the effects on NES were independent of its 
antidepressant effects, with no significant correlation found between NES symptoms and 
mood changes.79 Escitalopram has also been tested with reductions in the core NES 
symptoms, number of nocturnal ingestions and percent of energy intake consumed after 
dinner, in an open label trial.82 However, no significant differences in symptom reduction 
were found when escitalopram was compared to a placebo in an RCT.83

Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) has also been studied in an effort to find alternative 
treatments for NES. PMR has been shown to reduce stress, which is often associated with 
NES. In a recent study, Vander Wal and colleagues randomized 44 men and women to one of 
three groups: education, education plus PMR, or PMR plus exercise.84 The three groups 
reported reduction in NES symptoms, as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and 
perceived stress. The only significant difference between groups was the percentage of food

eaten after the evening meal, with the PMR group showing the greatest reduction, followed 
by the PMR plus exercise group and the educational group, respectively.84

Phototherapy––or bright light therapy––another alternative treatment for NES, has been 
studied to examine its possible efficacy in treatment of symptoms. Phototherapy has been 
shown to increase the availability of postsynaptic serotonin.85 In two case studies, bright 
light therapy was used to treat both seasonal depression and symptoms of NES. In a study 
conducted by Friedman and colleagues, a 51-year-old woman diagnosed with NES and 
comorbid depression was treated with paroxetine; light therapy was added. After 14 daily 
sessions of white light for 30 min, the patient no longer met the DSM-IV criteria for 
depression or the core symptoms of NES. However, once the light treatment was 
discontinued, her symptoms of NES returned, although her depression remained in 
remission. After being treated for another 12 days with light therapy, her night eating 
symptoms remitted once more.86 Additionally, in a pilot study conducted on the effects of 
bright light therapy among 15 individuals with NES, significant reductions were found in 
NES symptoms and mood and sleep disturbances post treatment.87

Summary

NES is a disorder of a delayed pattern of eating that is associated with increased weight and 
metabolic dysfunction. NES is often associated with other forms of psychopathology, 
including mood, anxiety and insomnia. Treatments are available, including CBT, PMR, 
bright light, and pharmacotherapies (mainly SSRIs). Further research is needed to 
understand the etiology of NES and to test these treatments more rigorously and in larger 
samples.

Conclusion

Overall, BED and NES occur in 5–15% of persons with obesity. Both disorders likely 
contribute to weight gain and are linked to medical comorbidities, or the worsening of their 
symptoms, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome (Table 1). Identification of these 
disorders through simple screening questions and referral to proper treatment is 
recommended, because patients often do not bring up these issues on their own due to the 
guilt and shame related to these disorders. However, absence of treatment likely exacerbates 
their medical co-morbidities and impedes treatment efforts overall. As such, asking about 
the presence of loss of control eating involving large amounts of food and eating habits in 
the evening and during the nighttime could yield important information for healthcare 
providers wanting to optimize treatment of the medical issues their patients are presenting, 
as well as improve psychological functioning and quality of life. Further research on 
treatment options and dissemination of treatments for these disorders is also warranted.
