Abstract

We review recent developments in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar disorder and
identify promising future routes to therapeutic innovation. Overall, advances in drug treatment
remain quite modest. Antipsychotic drugs are effective in the acute treatment of mania; their
efficacy in the treatment of depression is variable with the clearest evidence for quetiapine.
Despite their widespread use, considerable uncertainty and controversy remains about the use of
antidepressant drugs in the management of depressive episodes. Lithium has the strongest
evidence for long-term relapse prevention; the evidence for anticonvulsants such as divalproex
and lamotrigine is less robust and there is much uncertainty about the longer term benefits of
antipsychotics. Substantial progress has been made in the development and assessment of
adjunctive psychosocial interventions. Long-term maintenance and possibly acute stabilisation of
depression can be enhanced by the combination of psychosocial treatments with drugs. The
development of future treatments should consider both the neurobiological and psychosocial
mechanisms underlying the disorder. We should continue to repurpose treatments and to recognise
the role of serendipity. We should also investigate optimum combinations of pharmacological and
psychotherapeutic treatments at different stages of the illness. Clarification of the mechanisms by
which different treatments affect sleep and circadian rhythms and their relation with daily mood
fluctuations is likely to help with the treatment selection for individual patients. To be
economically viable, existing psychotherapy protocols need to be made briefer and more efficient
for improved scalability and sustainability in widespread implementation.

Introduction

Bipolar disorders types I and II affect about 2% of the world’s population, with subthreshold
forms of the disorder affecting another 2%.1–2 Even with treatment, about 37% of patients
relapse into depression or mania within 1 year, and 60% within 2 years.3 In the STEP-BD
cohort (n=1469), 58% of patients with bipolar disorder types I and II achieved recovery, but
49% had recurrences in a 2-year interval; twice as many of these recurrences were of
depressive polarity (marked by sad mood, loss of interests, or fatigue) rather than of manic
polarity (marked by elevated mood, grandiosity, and decreased need of sleep).4 After initial
onset, patients with bipolar disorder have residual depressive symptoms for about a third of
the weeks of their lives.5 In 2009, the direct and indirect costs of bipolar disorder were
estimated to be US$151 billion.6 Patients also experience psychotic symptoms, impaired
functioning, compromised quality of life, and stigma.7,8

Treatment of bipolar disorder conventionally focuses on acute stabilisation, in which the
goal is to bring a patient with mania or depression to a symptomatic recovery with euthymic
(stable) mood; and on maintenance, in which the goals are relapse prevention, reduction of
subthreshold symptoms, and enhanced social and occupational functioning. Treat ment of
both phases of the illness can be complex, because the same treatments that alleviate
depression can cause mania, hypomania, or rapid cycling (defined as four or more episodes
in 12 months), and the treatments that reduce mania might cause rebound depressive
episodes.

We focus on contemporary issues in the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar
disorder. Developments in diagnosis and neurobiology are beyond the scope of this review
and are mentioned only when they have direct implications for management. Despite a
substantial expansion of research into bipolar disorder and potential treatments during the
past 2 decades, true advances have been few. The development of effective treatments for
bipolar disorder is hampered by our scarce knowledge of basic disease mechanisms and the
consequent absence of validated pharmacological targets, and unconvincing animal or
human experimental drug models (table 1 provides a summary of putative treatment targets).
Most newly introduced treatments for bipolar disorder, whether pharmacological or
psychological, have been based on an extension of use from another disorder—eg,
antipsychotics in mania and antidepressants or cognitive-behavioural therapy for bipolar
depression. However, lithium remains unique because its main therapeutic use is in bipolar
disorder, and investigation of its mechanism of action has, and remains, crucially important
in the identification of future targets.

Treatment of mania

The pioneering trials of lithium and chlorpromazine were done in the 1970s and were
followed by a focus on antiepileptics (eg, valproate and carbamazepine) in the 1980s and
1990s. Few trials directly assessing the comparative efficacy of different second-generation
antipsychotics exist, but a mixed treatments meta-analysis compared 13 agents studied in 68
randomised controlled trials (16 073 participants).9 This review found substantial and
clinically important differences in terms of both efficacy and tolerability between agents.
Antipsychotic drugs seem to be better than anticonvulsants and lithium in the treatment of
manic episodes. Olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol seem to have the best profile of
presently available agents (figure).9 Therefore, antipsychotic agents will often be the
appropriate short-term clinical treatment, although a drug with better long-term evidence of
efficacy such as lithium might be preferred when continued drug therapy is planned.

Treatment of bipolar depression

The treatment of bipolar depression is a major challenge, with few treatments of proven
efficacy and, in particular, substantial controversy about the role of antidepressant drugs.
Authors of guidelines and consensus statements on this topic often ponder why
antidepressants are so commonly used despite the scarce evidence for efficacy.30–32 Until
recently, after the work of Emil Kraepelin, bipolar depressive episodes were deemed
phenomenologically and biologically similar to unipolar depressive episodes. Even as late as
the 1990s, inclusion and exclusion criteria in clinical trials of antidepressants in patients
with depressive disorder did not usually either select or stratify according to polarity. Earlier
trials suggested that when given with antimanic treatment, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor antidepressants were more effective and no more likely to induce mania than
placebo, and were less likely to induce mania than tricyclic antidepressants.32 In 2007, a
large trial found no benefit associated with the addition of paroxetine or bupropion to a

mood stabiliser;33 another reported that paroxetine was no better at achieving a durable
recovery than placebo.34

A recent updated meta-analysis of antidepressants in bipolar depression reported a pooled
effect no different from placebo (relative risk [RR] of response 1·17, 95% CI 0·82–1·57)
with statistically significant heterogeneity.35 Meta-analyses in patients with bipolar disorder
have grouped antidepressant drugs together as one class, despite the observed statistically
significant heterogeneity and the evidence in patients with unipolar disorder that
antidepressant agents vary to a clinically significant degree in both efficacy and
tolerability.36 Therefore, to conclude that no antidepressant agent is effective in bipolar
depression is probably premature, although the emerging evidence suggests that paroxetine
is ineffective.

The antiepileptic drug lamotrigine was investigated in patients with bipolar depression after
a clinical benefit was seen after treatment with the drug in patients with bipolar disorder.37
A meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from five trials of lamotrigine in bipolar
depression reported a modest treatment effect; however, no one trial showed statistically
significant benefits of treatment with lamotrigine in comparison with placebo. Thus, the
place of lamotrigine in acute treatment remains uncertain.38

Atypical antipsychotics have been investigated in bipolar depression with variable results.39
Treatment with quetiapine leads to more symptomatic improvement in patients with bipolar
depression than do placebo, paroxetine, and lithium.39 Some evidence exists of a reduced
risk of recurrence in patients who respond to acute-phase treatment and continue quetiapine
rather than switch to placebo; thus, continuation could be of benefit in patients who can
tolerate the drug’s adverse effects, including sedation and weight gain.40 The reasonably fast
onset of action of quetiapine is clinically useful because it provides clinicians and patients
with a treatment that can be initiated early in the course of a worsening depression in the
same way that antipsychotics are used for emerging manic symptoms. Combined olanzapine
and fluoxetine leads to more symptomatic improvement than does olanzapine or placebo
alone, which could suggest that fluoxetine is an effective treatment of acute bipolar
depression or that the combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine is synergistic.41

So far, the investigation of atypical antipsychotic drugs has been instructive for both clinical
and methodological reasons. Quetiapine and olanzapine–fluoxetine combination have
regulatory approval for bipolar depression in some countries and are included as first-line
recommendations in recent guidelines. Emerging evidence suggests that lurasidone might
also be efficacious, whereas aripiprazole does not seem to be so.39,42 The transdiagnostic
benefits of a drug like quetiapine, which is antipsychotic, antimanic, and antidepressant in
both unipolar and bipolar depression, emphasises the importance of the investigation of
treatment effects across conventional diagnostic boundaries.9,40,43 However, this non-
specificity and scarcity of convincing evidence of long-term disease modification by known
mechanisms suggests that the effects are mediated by short-term alleviation of symptoms.
Nonetheless, because bipolar depression is very difficult to treat, this relief is often useful
for patients and clinicians. Further, combinations of atypical antipsychotics with selective
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, or with agents that have medium-term to long-term effects on
depression (eg, lamotrigine) are often used in clinical practice and warrant investigation in
clinical trials.

Up to a third of patients with bipolar disorder do not respond to treatments in naturalistic
studies;4,5,7 these figures probably underestimate the proportion of treatment-resistant
patients with depression in clinical practice. Even patients who receive adequate
pharmacotherapy have lengthy and debilitating periods of subthreshold depressive

symptoms after major episodes. Longitudinal studies estimate that patients with bipolar
disorder type I spend as many as 3 weeks depressed for every 1 week (hypo)manic; the ratio
in bipolar disorder type II is 37:1.5,44 Subthreshold depressive symptoms are associated with
social and occupational impairment,45 and increased psychosocial impairment is
prospectively associated with earlier recurrences.46,47

Very little evidence exists of effective strategies for patients who do not respond to first-line
treatments. A recent review of strategies reported just seven small trials; one each for
ketamine, pramipexole, lamotrigine, and risperidone, and two each for modafinil and
electroconvulsive therapy.48 Therefore, recommendations in clinical practice guidelines for
treatment-resistant bipolar depression are still often based on extrapolation from the
evidence on augmentation and switching strategies in unipolar major depression. This
situation might lead to an underestimation of the attendant risks of treatment-emergent
hypomania or mania in patients with bipolar disorder.

Long-term maintenance treatment

Lithium, introduced by John Cade in 1949, remains the best established long-term treatment
for bipolar disorder.49 Although the metal has been in clinical use for more than 50 years,
the most convincing evidence of long-term efficacy comes from randomised clinical trials in
which lithium was included as an active comparator.50 A meta-analysis of five placebo-
controlled lithium maintenance trials (n=770) showed that lithium reduces the risk of manic
relapses by 38% (RR 0·62, 95% CI 0·50–0·84) and depressive relapse by 28% (0·72, 0·40–
0·95).50 Lithium is the only known anti-suicidal treatment with randomised evidence of a
reduction in the risk of suicide of more than 50%.51 However, the benefits of lithium are
restricted by adverse effects and a low therapeutic index.52 Although little evidence exists of
a clinically substantial reduction in renal function in most patients, the risk of end-stage
renal failure remains unclear. The risk of congenital malformations in the babies of mothers
who have taken lithium during pregnancy is uncertain, but probably lower than previously
thought. The balance of risks should be considered before lithium is withdrawn during
pregnancy. In addition to known effects of lithium on the thyroid, the risk of
hyperparathyroidism is increased and calcium concentrations should be checked before and
during treatment.52

The limitations of lithium mean that alternatives are often needed for long-term treatment. A
pooled analysis of two randomised lamotrigine versus placebo trials reported a 36%
reduction for lamotrigine in the risk of relapse over 18 months.53 Despite the dramatic
increase in the use of valproate in the past two decades,54 placebo-controlled evidence for
valproate in long-term prevention remains scarce.55 Moreover, the BALANCE trial found
that lithium was better than valproate in the prevention of mood episodes (RR 0·71, 95% CI
0·51–1·00), but a combined analysis finds heterogeneity between studies. Combination
treatment with lithium plus valproate is better than treatment with valproate monotherapy
(0·59, 0·42–0·83).56

Enrichment designs are standard in continuation trials sponsored by industry. Enrichment
selects patients with known acute response to, or who can tolerate, the investigational agent.
Patients are then randomly assigned to either continue the investigational agent during the
active trial or switch to placebo or an active comparator. The enrichment design can answer
questions about the continued benefits of the investigational medicine, but is not a fair test
of the comparator agents that do not have the prerandomisation selection. For example, one
trial protocol treated 2438 patients with quetiapine for 4–24 weeks; 1226 (50%) who
responded to treatment were randomly allocated to continue quetiapine or to switch to
placebo or lithium (0·6–1·2 mEq/L).40 Over 104 weeks, time-to-recurrence of any mood

event was significantly longer for patients given quetiapine versus placebo and for patients
given lithium versus placebo.

Because antipsychotics are the most potent treatments in acute mania,9 in many clinical
situations, it will seem reasonable to continue them after remission from the acute episode.30
However, there are few long-term trials, most use enrichment designs, and none have the
same degree of independent replication of efficacy as lithium. Thus, the role of
antipsychotics as long-term mood stabilisers remains uncertain.

Psychosocial treatments for bipolar disorder

Treatment guidelines increasingly suggest that optimum management of bipolar disorder
needs integration of pharmacotherapy with targeted psychotherapy.30,57 A recent
randomised trial in Denmark has shown clinical benefits from this approach.58
Psychological approaches build on evidence that psychosocial stressors, including excessive
family discord or distress, negative life events, or events that disrupt sleep and wake
rhythms or accelerate goal attainment are associated with relapses and worsening
symptomatic states (table 1).23 The main goals of adjunctive psychotherapy for bipolar
disorder include the education of patients, and when possible, caregivers, about strategies for
the management of stress, the identification and intervention of early signs of recurrence,
and how to keep regular lifestyle (eg, sleep and exercise) habits (panel).59 Moreover, in
view of the high rate of non-adherence to drug treatments (up to 60% after acute
episodes27), psychosocial treatments emphasise consistency with pharmacotherapy.

Evidence-based models of psychotherapy (table 2) include cognitive-behavioural therapy,
family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, group psychoeducation,
and systematic care management. Although these models have common objectives, their
methods, assumptions, and structure differ substantially.59,84

Adjunctive psychotherapy in acute treatment

Patients in acute manic episodes are not likely to respond well to intensive psychotherapy
because of insufficient insight or rejection of help.85 Some trials have examined whether
psychotherapy enhances remission from acute depression.86 The STEP-BD study compared
up to 30 sessions of family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, or
cognitive-behavioural therapy (ie, intensive treatment) with a brief psychoeducational
therapy (three individual sessions) for 293 patients with acute depression who also received
mood stabilisers. Over 1 year, patients in intensive therapy recovered more rapidly (hazard
ratio [HR] 1·47, 95% CI 1·08–2·0) and were more likely to be clinically well (1·58, 1·17–
2·13) in any study month than those in brief treatment.61 Effects extended to relationship
functioning and life satis faction.62 No differences emerged between the three intensive
modalities in symptoms or psychosocial functioning over 1 year. Interestingly, patients with
depression in STEP-BD who were treated with mood stabilisers and randomly assigned to
adjunctive anti depressant treatment did not recover faster than patients who were assigned
to adjunctive placebo treatment.33 Therefore, psychosocial treatment might be a more
effective adjunct to mood stabilisers than antidepressants after a bipolar depressive episode.

Adjunctive psychotherapy in long-term maintenance

Most studies of psychotherapy for bipolar disorder are maintenance trials in which patients
receive standard drugs and either an experimental psychosocial intervention or usual care
(eg, brief treatment or a supportive treatment of equal frequency and duration; table 1). A
meta-analysis of eight maintenance psycho therapy trials, which included family, individual,
and group treatment trials, yielded effect sizes ranging from an odds ratio (OR) of 0·57 (95%

CI 0·39–0·82) for reductions in any type of mood relapse to 1·2 (0·3–2·1) for enhanced
social functioning.87 A second meta-analysis of ten trials showed an overall RR of 0·74
(0·64–0·85) for mood relapse.88

Family-focused therapy

Family-focused therapy is based on the frequently replicated association between criticism
and hostility in caregivers (so-called expressed emotion) and an increased likelihood of
relapse in mood disorders and schizophrenia.25 Family-focused therapy involves the patient
and caregivers (parents or spouse) in up to 21 sessions of psychoeducation, communication
skills training, and problem-solving skills training.89 Two randomised controlled trials
including symptomatic patients with bipolar I and II found that, in the 1–2 years after a
manic, mixed, or depressive episode, patients with bipolar disorder who received family-
focused therapy and pharma cotherapy had 30–35% lower rates of relapse and
rehospitalisation and less severe symptoms than did patients in case manage ment28 or
equally intensive individual treatment.63 Two randomised controlled trials in paediatric
populations—one in adolescents (aged 12–18 years) with bipolar disorder64 and one in
children and adolescents (aged 9–17 years) with depression or hypomania with a first degree
relative with bipolar disorder65—found that children and adolescents who received family-
focused therapy and pharmacotherapy recovered more rapidly from depressive episodes (HR
0·37–0·54) than did children and adolescents in brief psychoeducation and pharmacotherapy.

The education of caregivers about bipolar disorder might translate into benefits for patients,
even if patients do not attend educational sessions. In one randomised controlled trial,68
remitted patients whose relatives attended psychoeducation groups had longer intervals
before manic and hypomanic episodes than did those whose relatives did not attend groups.
In a second trial,66 patients whose caregivers attended 12–15 family education sessions
showed significant decreases in symptoms of depression, especially if caregivers also
showed mood improvement. Thus, adjunctive family interventions have the potential to
lengthen periods of stability and alleviate residual symptoms in maintenance care. However,
differences in treatment preferences, cultural factors (eg, willingness to disclose in front of
others), and family structure (eg, parental vs spousal) might affect the willingness of patients
or caregivers to participate in family-based treatment.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy

Cognitive-behavioural therapy presumes that recurrences of mood disorder are determined
by pessimistic thinking in response to life events and core dysfunctional beliefs about the
self, the world, and the future.90 Cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat depression has been
adapted for patients with bipolar disorder with recognition that manic episodes are often
associated with excessively optimistic thinking.71 One randomised controlled trial58
reported that patients who received 12–14 sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy were
less likely to have depressive episodes and had better social functioning than patients in
routine care for 30 months. However, an effectiveness trial (n=252) comparing cognitive-
behavioural therapy with treatment as usual in five UK community care centres found no
advantage for cognitive-behavioural therapy over 18 months, except among patients with
fewer than 12 previous episodes.73

A Canadian trial compared six group psychoeducation sessions with 20 sessions of
individual cognitive-behavioural therapy, both with pharmacotherapy, in 204 patients in full
or partial remission.75 No differences were recorded over 72 weeks in symptom burden or
recurrence. Group psychoeducation was estimated to cost US$180 per patient, whereas
cognitive-behavioural therapy was estimated to cost $1200 per patient. In summary, the
evidence for adjunctive cognitive-behavioural therapy for relapse prevention is inconclusive.

Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy

Substantial evidence exists that mood instability in bipolar disorder is related to changes in
circadian rhythms (table 1).20 The relation between sleep and mood disturbances seem to be
bidirectional. Polymorphisms in CLOCK genes are related to circadian mood fluctuations
and recurrences in bipolar disorder.91 In one promising animal model,92 mice with
mutations in CLOCK genes behaved in ways that resembled manic behaviour in people (eg,
increases in activity and decreased sleep); these behaviours were reversed upon treatment
with lithium.

Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, an adaptation of the interpersonal psychotherapy
for depression, uses a problem-solving approach to interpersonal problems by encouraging
patients to maintain and regulate daily routines and sleep and wake rhythms.21 In a large
(n=175) randomised clinical trial,21 acutely manic, mixed, or depressed patients with bipolar
I disorder were assigned to weekly interpersonal and social rhythm therapy or to equally
intensive clinical management, both with pharmacotherapy. After acute stabilisation,
random assignment was done again (interpersonal and social rhythm therapy vs clinical
management) and treatment continued for a 2-year maintenance phase. No differences in
time-to-recovery between the groups during acute stabilisation were recorded. However,
patients who received interpersonal and social rhythm therapy in the acute phase had longer
times to recurrence and better vocational functioning in the maintenance phase than did
patients who received clinical management during the acute phase. Moreover, the effects of
interpersonal and social rhythm therapy in the delay of recurrences were most pronounced in
patients who had been able to stabilise their daily or nightly routines during acute
treatment.21 Thus, to help patients to stabilise their sleep and wake rhythms after an acute
episode might have downstream effects on the prevention of future mood instability.

Group psychoeducation

In view of the many patients who could benefit from psychoeducation, group approaches
following a predesigned curriculum have been proposed. The Barcelona approach78
emphasises awareness of illness, treatment adherence, early detection of recurrences, and
sleep and wake regularity. In a trial of patients with bipolar disorder types I and II in the
euthymic phase of illness, patients were randomly assigned to pharmacotherapy and 21
sessions of structured group psychoeducation or 21 sessions of an unstructured support
group. After 5 years, patients who had received the structured groups had fewer relapses and
were ill for less time than those who had been in the unstructured groups.29,78 Moreover,
over 5 years, the reduction in days in hospital translated into a cost savings of approximately
€5000 per patient in psychoeducation. 93

Functional remediation

Functional remediation treatment emphasises patients’ cognitive functioning through
exercises for memory, attention, problem solving, reasoning, and organisation. In a ten-site
randomised clinical trial in Spain,79 268 euthymic patients who had moderate to severe
psychosocial impairment were assigned to 21 weekly group sessions of functional
remediation, 21 sessions of standard group psychoeducation, or treatment as usual. Patients
in functional remediation showed greater changes in occupational and social functioning
than did those treated as usual, but differed only slightly from patients in the standard
psychoeducation groups. No differential effects of functional remediation were recorded for
neurocognitive or clinical change variables.

Systematic care management

Two research groups have examined collaborative care programmes that combine protocol-
driven pharmacotherapy, group psychoeducation, and intensive patient monitoring by a
nurse care manager. Importantly, these studies were done in managed health-care
cooperatives in the USA and included large patient samples with systematic follow-up. In
trials at a group health cooperative (n=441)82 and in 11 Veterans Administration sites
(n=306),83 patients were randomly assigned to systematic care or usual care. Although
neither study showed reductions in relapses, patients in systematic care had fewer weeks in
manic episodes than did those in usual care. In the Veterans Administration study, patients
in collaborative care also had improved social functioning and quality of life over 2 years.
Cost-effectiveness analyses suggested that the care programmes saved money despite their
greater intensity of follow-up.82,83

Future directions

Advances in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder have come mainly from the
repurposing of drugs used in other neuropsychiatric disorders, and do not target the mood
instability that characterises the disorder. Dopamine antagonism seems to be a potential
target for antimanic treatments, but the scarce convincing evidence that increasing
serotonergic transmission improves symptoms in bipolar depression shows the need for
development of bipolar-specific validated targets for novel treatments. Existing treatments
(especially lithium) and the gradual emergence of insights into the neurobiology of the
disorder provide potential targets (table 1). Opportunities should increase with the
implementation of new methods such as the use of induced pluripotential stem cells to
provide in-vitro models of neural systems,94 the identification of genetic and epigenetic
factors,95,96 and the use of optogenetics to develop more precise animal models.97
Meanwhile, faced with the neurobiological complexity of the disorder, present approaches to
drug discovery and repurposing will need to use existing targets in addition to any novel
targets such as oxidative damage.17

Following up leads emerging from insights into the underlying neurobiology is already
producing promising results. For example, after evidence of dysfunction in the N-methyl-D-
aspartate–receptor complex in the glutamatergic system in bipolar disorder, two crossover
trials12,13 found that infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produced
rapid alleviation of depressive symptoms in bipolar depression. These findings open a new
approach to drug development and provide insights into the neurobiology of the disorder.
The recent identification of the failed stroke treatment antioxidant ebselen as a potential
lithium mimetic—obtained from screening of 450 compounds from the National Institutes of
Health Clinical Collection—is an elegant and comprehensive approach using several targets,
which now needs clinical evaluation.98

Acceleration of the development of novel treatments needs improved validation strategies
for preclinical targets and the development of innovative biomarkers and intermediate
outcomes for use in early-phase clinical trials.99 Validation strategies might include
neuroimaging, cognitive or biochemical measures, and molecular genetic studies. Moreover,
a more deeply characterised picture of the core clinical phenotype is urgently needed. The
emerging picture of the course of bipolar disorder is one of chronic mood instability rather
than discrete episodes of mania and depression.100,101 Early detection of treatment effects
on short-term mood instability could provide the much needed intermediate outcomes for
early-phase trials and experimental medicine.

For example, clarification of the mechanisms by which different mood stabilisers and
atypical antipsychotics affect sleep and circadian rhythms and their relation with daily mood

fluctuations is likely to help with the treatment selection for individual patients.
Conventional episode-based maintenance designs are likely to be inefficient, especially for
early-phase therapeutic development.

Substantial progress has been made in the past decade in understanding of the role of
psychotherapy in bipolar disorder. All existing forms of psychotherapy for bipolar disorder
include psychoeducation, although which didactic ingredients lead to the most clinical
change is not clear (panel). The next generation of psychotherapy studies will need to
systematically assess mediators in the pathways from treatments to changes in illness course.
The identification of mechanisms of change—eg, regulation of sleep and wake rhythms,
reductions in family conflict, consistency of adherence to drugs, or the ability to intervene
early with prodromal symptoms—might lead to the development of briefer treatments with
more durable effects.102 The identification of mediators might be enhanced by controlled dis
mantling designs that test the effects of psychotherapies with and without the components
believed to induce change. Further identification of psychological processes underlying
mood instability, such as the role of imagery in increasing anxiety and mood instability,
might lead to more focused psychological interventions.103

Drug and psychotherapy trials have largely proceeded independently of one another.
Specifically, drug studies have not examined the effects of psychotropic agents on
psychosocial variables (eg, a patient’s ability to regulate emotions in response to life events),
nor have psychotherapy studies analysed changes in presumed biological mechanisms (eg,
degree of amygdala activation in emotional challenge paradigms104). Pragmatic trials that
examine the interactive effects of psychotropic drugs and psychotherapy in maintenance
treatment would help to move the field forward. For example, a trial in which patients with
bipolar disorder in the depressive phase of illness are initially treated with quetiapine or
lithium or both, and then randomly assigned to continued pharmacotherapy with adjunctive
psychotherapy versus adjunctive antidepressants, could help to define effective algorithms
for bipolar depression.

As the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of children who are predisposed to adult
bipolar disorder are identified,105 the focus of treatment research may change to early
intervention. One small randomised trial found that family-focused therapy was more
effective than usual care in the treatment of hypomanic and depressive symptoms in young
people (aged 9–17 years) with a first-degree bipolar relative.65 Whether early pharma
cological or psychosocial interventions for prodromal youth can help to delay or prevent the
transition to bipolar disorder types I or II in adulthood will be crucial to investigate in this
decade.

Innovations in service provision often focus on the early detection of manic and depressive
symptoms.58,82,83 In our opinion, early detection combined with helpful self-management
and targeted psychosocial and drug treatment promises substantial benefits. To be
economically sustainable, psychosocial protocols need to be standardised for settings that
serve large numbers of patients and have few resources for clinician training. The addition
of web-based interactive protocols that track mood and sleep cycles and provide real-time
information to providers, such as our OXTEXT programme based on mood monitoring,
might enhance this effort.102,103

Validation evidence of putative treatment development targets in bipolar disorder

Table 1

Neurotransmitter and neurohormonal dysregulation

Evidence of target validation

Dopamine9,10

Serotonin11

Glutamate12–14

Intracellular signalling

Inositol monophosphatase15,16

GSK-314,17

Protein kinase C pathway18

Calcium channels17

Neural mechanisms

Corticolimbic emotion control circuit19

Sleep and circadian regulation

Circadian clock associated with impaired
sleep and weight changes20–22

Psychosocial variables

Responses to stressful events23,24

High expressed emotion and negative
family interactions23,25,26

Antipsychotic agents block dopamine D2 receptors and are potent antimanics

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of uncertain efficacy, atypical antipsychotics enhance
serotonin activity

Valproate, lamotrigine, and some antidepressants modulate glutamate transmission; rapid
alleviation of
depressive symptoms with ketamine infusion

Lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine reduce intracellular myoinositol concentration and increase
neuronal
growth cone spreading at therapeutic concentrations

Neuroprotective effects of lithium and other agents might be mediated by inhibition of GSK-3

Lithium and valproate inhibit PKC activity; tamoxifen inhibits PKC activity and might be
antimanic

CACNA1C risk allele associated with bipolar disorder; lamotrigine inhibits voltage-activated
calcium channels;
calcium channel blockers might be antimanic

Hyperactivation of amygdala and reduced anterior cingulate activity during mania; reduced
ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex activity and hyperactivation of basal ganglia across mood states; reduced resting
state
connectivity of amygdala and prefrontal regions

Antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate regulate sleep and circadian rhythms and stabilise mood;
interpersonal and
social rhythm therapy is associated with delayed recurrences when social and circadian rhythms are
regulated

Negative events are associated with depressive episodes; goal attainment events are associated with
manic
episodes; psychosocial treatments can modulate responses to stress

Crucial attitudes in caregivers and negative verbal interactions between caregivers and patients
associated with
greater likelihood of recurrence; family-focused therapy enhances family communication and is
associated with
reduction in mood symptoms

Drug adherence27–29

Psychoeducational treatments improve adherence to mood stabilisers, leading to lower likelihood of
manic recurrence

recovery from depression
and less severe symptoms of
depression over 2 years

FFT associated with more rapid
recovery from depression,
less time ill, and less severe
manic symptoms over 1 year

FFT associated with greater
decreases in caregiver
depression and health risk
behaviour and greater reductions

decreases in depression in
both family treatments than in
treatments as usual

Over 15 months, fewer patients
whose caregivers attended
groups had manic or hypomanic
relapses

Children with mood disorders
assigned to multifamily
