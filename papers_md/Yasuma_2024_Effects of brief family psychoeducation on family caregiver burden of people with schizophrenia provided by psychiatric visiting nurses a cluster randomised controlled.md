Abstract
Background  The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a brief family psychoeducation (BFP) 
programme provided by psychiatric visiting nurses on caregiver burden of family caregivers of people with 
schizophrenia through a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT).

Methods  The study was a two-arm, parallel-group cRCT. Forty-seven psychiatric visiting nurse agencies were 
randomly allocated to the BFP programme group (intervention group) or treatment as usual group (TAU; control 
group). Caregivers of people with schizophrenia were recruited by psychiatric visiting nurses using a randomly 
ordered list. The primary outcome was caregiver burden, measured using the Japanese version of the Zarit Burden 
Interview. Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, 1-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Intention-
to-treat analysis was conducted to examine the effects of the BFP programme on caregiver burden.

Results  Thirty-four psychiatric visiting nurse agencies and 83 family caregivers of people with schizophrenia 
participated in the study. The participant attrition rate was less than 20%. Adherence to the program was 100%. 
Compared with TAU group, the BFP programme group had decreased caregiver burden. However, this improvement 
was not significant at 1-month follow-up (adjusted mean difference [aMD] = 0.27, 95% CI = − 5.48 to 6.03, p = 0.93, 
d = 0.01) or 6-month follow-up (aMD = − 2.12, 95% CI = − 7.80 to 3.56, p = 0.45, d = 0.11).

Conclusions  The BFP programme provided by psychiatric visiting nurses did not achieve significant decreases 
in caregiver burden. This result may be attributed to the difficulty in continuing the research due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, which prevented us from achieving the targeted sample size necessary to meet the statistical power 
requirements, as well as to the participation of caregivers with relatively low burden. However, the program had the

advantage of high adherence to treatment plan. Further studies should be conducted with a larger sample size and a 
more diverse sample that includes caregivers with a higher care burden.

Background
Families caring for people with schizophrenia have many 
difficulties  in  their  community  lives  [1].  They  often  do 
not acquire adequate general knowledge of schizophrenia 
[2].  Indeed,  many  family  members  have  trouble  coping 
with symptoms, communicating with people with mental 
illness, and keeping an appropriate distance from people 
with  schizophrenia  [2–4].  Due  to  these  concerns,  they 
feel  both  physical  and  psychological  distress  when  tak-
ing  care  of  people  with  schizophrenia  and  they  wish  to 
have their own free  time [4]. Therefore, providing effec-
tive family interventions is an urgent matter in the field of 
community mental health services.

Previous studies have developed effective family inter-
ventions.  Several  systematic  reviews  showed  that  a 
family  psychoeducation  (FPE)  programme  is  an  effec-
tive  approach  that  reduces  caregiver  burden  [5,  6].  The 
FPE  programme  mainly  includes  components  such  as 
sharing  information  about  the  disorder,  early  warn-
ing  signs,  relapse  prevention,  as  well  as  training  in  cop-
ing,  communication,  and  problem-solving  skills  [7].  A 
FPE  programme  could  improve  caregivers’  knowledge 
about  schizophrenia  and  related  caregiving  problems 
[8].  Improved  knowledge  could  lead  to  a  more  positive 
appraisal of caregiving experiences as well as caregivers’ 
own self-efficacy, which decreases their burden [5].

Despite  the  accumulation  of  evidence,  there  are  sev-
eral  barriers  to  FPE  programme  implementation.  The 
implementation  rate  for  FPE  programmes  at  psychiatric 
facilities  is  low  in  Japan  and  other  countries  [9,  10].  A 
nationwide survey in Japan revealed that the implemen-
tation  rate  for  FPE  programmes  at  psychiatric  facilities 
was  35.9%  in  hospitals  and  14.5%  in  outpatient  settings 
[9]. The initial report on the Schizophrenia Patient Out-
comes  Research  Team’s  treatment  recommendations 
found  that  a  FPE  programme  was  provided  to  31.6%  of 
inpatients and 9.6% of outpatients [10]. One challenge in 
FPE  programme  implementation  was  the  length  of  the 
intervention.  A  FPE  programme  usually  ranges  from  9 
months to 2 years, which is impractical for medical staff, 
people with schizophrenia, and their families [11]. Other 
reasons include funding and staff shortages, as well as the 
need for training [12]. To address these issues, the devel-
opment  of  a  brief  and  implementable  FPE  programme 
within  the  existing  mental  health  system  was  greatly 
needed [13].

The  outcomes  of  brief  family  psychoeducation  (BFP) 
programmes  have  been  studied  in  caregivers  of  people 
with  schizophrenia  in  previous  studies.  A  BFP  pro-
gramme is defined as including five or fewer sessions or 
lasting no more than 3 months. It was easy to conduct for 
both practitioners and caregivers [14]. BFP programmes 
have  been  shown  to  significantly  increase  caregivers’ 
knowledge  of  the  disorder,  which  could  reduce  relapse 
and  rehospitalisation  rates  [15].  In  addition,  at  least  five 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed that the BFP 
programme  had  an  effect  on  caregiver  burden  [16–20] 
and three RCTs indicated a significant decrease in care-
giver burden [17–19]. However, evidence of the effect of 
the  BFP  programme  on  caregiver  burden  has  remained 
inconclusive  due  to  at  least  two  methodological  prob-
lems. One is that the previous studies were single-centre 
RCTs,  and  contamination  between  the  intervention  and 
control groups might have occurred. The other is that the 
follow-up period was short, ranging from 1 to 3 months 
after  the  intervention.  In  other  words,  the  long-term 
effects  of  the  intervention  remain  unknown.  Given  the 
limitations of the previous studies, a cluster RCT (cRCT) 
with a longer follow-up period should be conducted.

Practical  implementation  strategies  for  the  BFP  pro-
gramme  in  each  health  system  need  to  be  considered, 
in  addition  to  a  scientific  evaluation  of  the  effects.  A 
BFP  programme  provided  by  psychiatric  visiting  nurses 
appears  to  be  a  potentially  feasible  and  sustainable  way 
of  implementing  the  FPE  programme  in  the  Japanese 
clinical setting. Psychiatric visiting nurses routinely visit 
clients  with  schizophrenia  and  their  family  members. 
They  have  already  built  rapport  with  clients  and  fam-
ily members and would be able to respond according to 
their needs, which means they could seamlessly provide 
a  highly  individualized  BFP  programme  [21].  In  addi-
tion, the system of psychiatric visiting nurses could eas-
ily be applied because the number of psychiatric visiting 
nurses has been increasing recently in Japan [22]. From a 
cost perspective, it would be possible to make family sup-
port a service that is reimbursable by the national health 
insurance to cover psychiatric visiting nurse consultancy 
fees.  Taken  together,  incorporating  the  BFP  programme 
into  psychiatric  visiting  nurse  practices  could  increase 
the  implementation  rate  and  lead  to  effective  family 
interventions in the community setting in Japan.

Hypothesis and aims

Given  the  above,  the  novelty  of  this  study  lies  in  using 
a  long-term  cRCT  to  elucidate  the  effects  of  BFP  on 
caregiving  burden,  and  in  evaluating  it  within  the  con-
text  of  psychiatric  visiting  nursing,  an  existing  psychi-
atric  healthcare  system.  Considering  the  low  adoption 
rate  of  FPE,  conducting  an  effectiveness  validation  of 
the  easily  implementable  BFP  in  a  real-world  setting  is 
deemed  crucial.  Additionally,  given  the  simplicity  of  the 
BFP,  it  is  expected  to  be  of  low  intensity,  and  therefore, 
its  effect  size  may  be  limited.  There  is  a  possibility  that 
the  program’s  effects  could  be  underestimated  due  to 
the  exchange  of  information  between  psychiatric  visit-
ing  nurses  (program  providers)  in  the  intervention  and 
control  groups,  or  among  the  families  (program  recipi-
ents).  To  minimize  this  impact,  the  adoption  of  a  cRCT 
offers  advantages.  Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  study  is  to 
determine  whether  the  caregiving  burden  among  fami-
lies  caring  for  individuals  with  schizophrenia  decreases 
when  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  provide  BFP,  through  a 
6-month follow-up cRCT. Based on the research aim, we 
hypothesised that a BFP programme provided by psychi-
atric visiting nurses could alleviate the burden on family 
caregivers of people with schizophrenia.

Methods
Trial design

A  two-arm,  parallel-group  cRCT  was  performed.  The 
study protocol [23] was registered in the University Hos-
pital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Tri-
als  Registry  (UMIN-CTR  ID,  UMIN000038044).  First 
registration  date  was  September  18,  2019.  We  reported 
study findings in accordance with the Consolidated Stan-
dards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for cRCTs [24].

Setting and site selection at the cluster level

The first author (NY) approached 68 psychiatric visiting 
nurse agencies in 4 prefectures in Japan (Tokyo, Saitama, 
Kanagawa,  and  Chiba)  managed  by  one  organisation. 
Forty-seven visiting nurse agencies agreed to participate 
in the study.

The  inclusion  criterion  for  psychiatric  visiting  nurse 
agencies  was  that  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  provided 
services mostly to psychiatric patients rather than elderly 
people  or  those  with  physical  diseases.  In  each  agency, 
psychiatric visiting nurses must care for at least two peo-
ple with schizophrenia who live with their family. There 
were no exclusion criteria at the cluster level.

Randomisation at the cluster level

We  randomly  allocated  psychiatric  visiting  nurse  agen-
cies into the BFP programme group (intervention group) 
or  the  treatment  as  usual  (TAU)  group.  Randomiza-
tion of clusters was performed prior to the collection of 

baseline data, and the results of the randomization were 
conveyed to each psychiatric visiting nurse agencies after 
the  completion  of  participant  recruitment.  It  was  also 
stratified  by  the  median  of  the  average  caseload  of  psy-
chiatric  visiting  nurses  in  each  agency  because  the  ser-
vice  quality  of  a  psychiatric  visiting  nurse  is  affected  by 
caseload  [25].  Family  support  is  unlikely  to  be  provided 
when a psychiatric visiting nurse has a high caseload. A 
researcher (HT) in the statistics department who was not 
involved in the study protocol development process cre-
ated  a  random  sequence  table.  Another  researcher  (SY) 
who was not involved in the intervention or analysis con-
ducted the randomisation and informed each psychiatric 
visiting  nurse  agency  of  the  randomisation  results  after 
the  recruitment  procedure  at  the  individual  level.  The 
primary investigator (NY) was blinded through the entire 
randomisation  process.  Further  information  about  the 
randomisation process was provided in the study proto-
col [23].

Participant eligibility criteria and recruitment procedure at 
the individual level

The  inclusion  criteria  for  a  family  caregiver  of  a  person 
with schizophrenia were as follows: (1) primary caregiver; 
(2) age over 20 years; (3) family member of a person with 
schizophrenia such as a parent, sibling, spouse, or child; 
and (4) living with the person with schizophrenia. There 
were  no  exclusion  criteria  for  caregivers.  The  inclusion 
criteria  for  people  with  schizophrenia  were  as  follows: 
(1) diagnosis of schizophrenia based on the International 
Statistical  Classification  of  Diseases  and  Related  Health 
Problems,  10th  revision  and  (2)  receiving  services  from 
psychiatric visiting nurses.

During  the  recruitment  procedure  at  the  individual 
level, we listed all potential participants (family caregiv-
ers of people with schizophrenia and people with schizo-
phrenia) at each agency. Second, we created a randomly 
ordered  list  using  a  random  number  generator  in  the 
Stata  statistical  software  program,  version  15,  in  order 
to avoid selection bias at the individual level. Third, each 
psychiatric visiting nurse who attended a lecture on study 
design  and  ethical  considerations  recruited  participants 
according  to  the  randomly  ordered  list  until  five  par-
ticipants  were  recruited.  Psychiatric  visiting  nurses  also 
obtained  written  informed  consent  from  people  with 
schizophrenia  and  their  caregivers.  Only  participants 
who  voluntarily  agreed  to  participate  in  the  study  were 
included.

The  deadline  for  participant  registration  submitted  to 
the  ethics  committee  was  October  31,  2020.  In  Japan,  a 
state of emergency was declared after April 2020, which 
led to restrictions on the number of visits and duration of 
psychiatric visiting nurses’ visits from the perspective of 
infectious  disease  prevention.  Consequently,  conducting

family psychoeducation, which requires longer visit times 
than  usual,  became  a  burden  for  both  the  participating 
facilities  and  the  patients  or  their  families,  making  fur-
ther recruitment challenging.

Intervention programme

This  intervention  program  was  a  single-family  interven-
tion  conducted  by  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  that  was 
based on the Family Intervention and Support in Schizo-
phrenia: A Manual on Family Intervention for the Men-
tal  Health  Professional  [26].  Based  on  the  concept  of 
coproduction  and  patient  and  public  involvement  (PPI), 
we  created  this  program  through  discussions  and  col-
laborations among members of the Family Association of 
Schizophrenia,  psychiatric  visiting  nurses,  FPE  experts, 
psychiatrists,  psychiatric  nurses,  clinical  psychologists, 
and mental health social workers [27].

The program consisted of four sessions lasting 60 min 
each,  which  was  completed  over  1  month.  Attendance 
of at least one session was required. In Session I, general 
knowledge  about  schizophrenia  was  covered,  includ-
ing its definition, causes, symptoms, and prognosis. The 
definition and causes were emphasized using the stress-
vulnerability model and dopamine hypothesis, highlight-
ing  that  schizophrenia  is  a  brain  disease  that  can  affect 
anyone. It was important to explain biological causes, as 
some  families  believe  that  familial  relationships  are  the 
cause of schizophrenia. Regarding symptoms, the session 
emphasized the challenges that individuals face in main-
taining their typical way of life due to psychiatric symp-
toms. The course of the illness, including the prodromal, 
acute,  and  recovery  phases,  was  explained,  detailing 
the  characteristics  and  management  strategies  for  each 
phase. The prognosis discussed how schizophrenia is not 
necessarily a condition with a poor outcome. Medication 
therapy was addressed, acknowledging the difficulties of 
daily medication adherence, and discussing the necessity 
and safety of pharmacological treatment. The side effects 
of antipsychotic  medications were explained  using illus-
trations.  The  session  concluded  with  an  explanation  of 
psychosocial  treatments  such  as  psychoeducation  and 
daycare,  and  a  knowledge  check  quiz  was  conducted. 
In  Session  II,  various  family  concerns  and  problem-
solving  techniques  were  addressed.  The  session  cov-
ered  responses  to  hallucinations  and  delusions,  signs  of 
relapse, creating a crisis plan, managing worsening con-
ditions,  dealing  with  a  family  member  staying  indoors, 
reluctance  to  take  medication,  potential  and  occurring 
violence,  and  suspected  self-harm  or  suicidal  behaviors. 
Finally,  problem-solving  techniques  were  taught,  and 
families  practiced  solving  everyday  caregiving  issues 
using  these  methods.  Session  III  dealt  with  engagement 
and  communication  training  with  the  affected  individ-
ual.  It  focused  on  understanding  the  patient’s  feelings, 

Expressed  Emotion  (EE)  theory,  basic  communication 
knowledge and skills, and methods to enhance resilience. 
The  importance  of  showing  understanding  for  the  indi-
vidual’s  pessimistic  views  about  their  future  and  their 
difficulties  was  emphasized.  EE  theory  also  highlighted 
that  it  is  understandable  for  families  to  exhibit  high  EE 
levels,  and  explained  how  changing  the  way  families 
interact could potentially alter the individual’s symptoms 
and  condition.  Additionally,  the  session  included  prac-
ticing  conversation  using  hypothetical  case  scenarios  to 
think  about  better  communication  methods.  Session  IV 
focused on family recovery. It addressed the importance 
of family recovery, the significance of families living their 
own lives, considerations for physical and mental health, 
strategies for managing stress without exhaustion, expe-
riences, and messages from members of a schizophrenia 
family  association,  and  available  community  resources. 
This session emphasized the importance of both the indi-
vidual  and  family  having  their  own  lifestyles  and  goals, 
encouraged  families  not  to  devote  themselves  solely  to 
caregiving but to utilize various social resources to  pur-
sue their own lives. It also aimed to improve family mem-
bers’  physical  and  mental  health  through  knowledge  of 
self-care and stress management. Experiences from three 
family  association  members  were  shared  to  help  fami-
lies understand that they are not alone in their struggles, 
aiming  to  alleviate  their  sadness  and  despair.  Lastly,  the 
session discussed community resources available and the 
importance  of  connecting  with  multiple  supporters.  We 
also  described  the  development  and  contents  in  greater 
detail in the study protocol [23].

Training and program adherence

The intervention team of psychiatric visiting nurses was 
provided with a 1-day group lecture before the interven-
tion,  which  consisted  of  three  parts.  First,  family  care-
givers  of  people  with  schizophrenia  talked  about  their 
life  problems  and  what  they  wanted  psychiatric  visit-
ing  nurses  to  do.  Second,  basic  communication  training 
was performed through role-playing. Third, the primary 
investigator  (NY)  equipped  psychiatric  visiting  nurses 
with basic knowledge about FPE and explained the con-
tents of this intervention tool and the points that the pri-
mary investigator wanted to emphasise.

With regard to program adherence, we created a check-
list to confirm the date the programme was implemented 
and  how  many  sessions  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  were 
actually able to conduct with participants. The checklist 
was self-reported by psychiatric visiting nurses at the end 
of each session.

Treatment as usual (TAU) group

Family  caregivers  of  people  with  schizophrenia  in  the 
control  group  received  usual  care  from  psychiatric 

Yasuma et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:445 Page 5 of 12

visiting nurses. They did not receive any type of psycho-
education or supportive therapy.

Outcomes

The following outcome measures were assessed at base-
line prior to the intervention (T1), immediately after the 
completion of the intervention (1-month follow-up, T2), 
and 6 months after the baseline assessment (6-month fol-
low-up, T3).

Primary outcome for caregivers
Zarit burden interview (ZBI-22)

ZBI-22 was used for measuring caregiver burden. It con-
sists of 22 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 
(never)  to  4  (nearly  always)  [28].  The  total  score  ranges 
from 0 to 88, with higher scores indicating higher burden. 
Cut-off points are as following: 0–21, little or no burden; 
21–40,  mild  to  moderate  burden;  41–60,  moderate  to 
severe  burden;  and  61–88,  severe  burden.  The  Japanese 
version  of  ZBI-22  has  high  test–retest  reproducibility 
and internal consistency [29]. Construct validity has also 
been confirmed [30].

Secondary outcome for caregivers
Kessler psychological distress scale (K6)

K6 was used to measure sub-clinical depression and anxi-
ety disorders as part of a self-administered questionnaire, 
which consists of six items answered on a five-point Lik-
ert  scale.  Scores  range  from  0  to  24,  with  higher  scores 
representing  higher  degrees  of  sub-clinical  depression 
and anxiety disorder. The Japanese version has essentially 
equivalent screening performance as the original English 
version [30].

General self-efficacy scale (GSES)

GSES  is  a  measure  of  self-efficacy  in  daily  living,  which 
includes  16  items  with  dichotomous  questions  [31].  In 
general,  higher  scores  indicate  better  self-efficacy  [31]. 
GSES  has  high  test–retest  reproducibility  and  internal 
consistency  [31].  Construct  validity  has  also  been  con-
firmed [31].

WHO-five well-being index (WHO-5)

WHO-5  was  used  to  measure  subjective  well-being  or 
quality  of  life  based  on  positive  mood  (good  spirits  and 
relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh and 
rested), and general interest (being interested in things). 
The scale consists of five items rated on a six-point Lik-
ert  scale.  Higher  scores  mean  higher  well-being.  The 
Japanese  version  of  WHO-5  has  adequate  internal  con-
sistency  [32].  External  concurrent  validity  and  external 
discriminatory  validity  have  also  been  confirmed  in  a 
previous study [32].

Knowledge of illness and drug inventory (KIDI)

KIDI  was  used  to  assess  the  knowledge  regarding  men-
tal illness and the effects of medications on mental illness 
[33]. There were 2 sub-scales: 10 items assessing knowl-
edge  of  mental  illness  and  the  remaining  items  assess-
ing knowledge of the effects of antipsychotic drugs. This 
inventory  consists  of  a  self-reported  inventory  where 
respondents were asked to select the correct answer from 
three  choices,  with  higher  scores  representing  greater 
knowledge.

Secondary outcomes in people with schizophrenia
Behaviour and symptom identification scale (BASIS-32)

BASIS-32  has  been  used  to  measure  mental  health.  It 
includes 32 items on a 5-point Likert scale, where 0 indi-
cates no difficulties and 4 indicates severe difficulties. The 
scale  measured  five  factors:  (1)  relation  to  self  and  oth-
ers  (seven  items);  (2)  depression/anxiety  (six  items);  (3) 
everyday life and role functioning (nine items); (4) impul-
sive and addictive behaviour (six items); and (5) psychosis 
(four  items).  Internal  consistency  and  construct  validity 
of  the  Japanese  version  of  BASIS-32  have  been  demon-
strated  [34].  For  overall  symptom  severity,  we  used  the 
average score of the 32 items.

WHO-five well-being index (WHO-5)

WHO-5  was  used  to  measure  subjective  quality  of  life 
based  on  positive  mood  (good  spirits  and  relaxation), 
vitality (being active and waking up fresh and rested), and 
general  interest  (being  interested  in  things).  It  consisted 
of  five  items  rated  on  a  six-point  Likert  scale.  Higher 
scores  mean  higher  well-being.  The  Japanese  version  of 
WHO-5  [32]  had  adequate  internal  consistency.  It  had 
been confirmed to have external concurrent validity and 
external discriminatory validity.

Hospitalisation by 6-month follow-up

We  created  a  self-reported  measure  for  hospitalisation 
that  included  a  dichotomous  variable  about  whether  a 
person  with  schizophrenia  had  been  hospitalised  dur-
ing the past 6 months. The participating family caregiver 
reported  this  measure  at  the  6-month  follow-up.  If  the 
person  with  schizophrenia  had  been  hospitalised,  the 
caregiver reported the date of admission.

Sample size calculation

We  calculated  sample  size  according  to  the  CONSORT 
guidelines  for  cRCTs  [24],  taking  into  account  intra-
class correlations (ICCs). The effect size of the BFP pro-
gramme  for  individual  caregiver  burden  was  estimated 
based  on  a  previous  pre–post  test  [35].  The  pre–post-
test concluded that the standardised mean difference (d) 
of  the  BFP  programme  on  caregiver  burden  was  0.46. 
Sample size was estimated as 76 in each arm based on an 

Yasuma et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:445 Page 6 of 12

alpha error probability of 0.05 and power (1 − β) of 0.80, 
using  G*Power  version  3.1.9.2  [36,  37].  For  cRCTs,  this 
value should be multiplied by the design effect (1+[m − 1]
ρ),  where  m  is  the  average  cluster  size  and  ρ  is  the  ICC 
[38]. The estimated ICC for the primary outcome in this 
study was set to 0.05 and the average number of caregiv-
ers per cluster was set at 5. Assuming an attrition rate of 
20%,  the  required  sample  size  is  110  caregivers  in  each 
arm.  Thus,  at  least  44  visiting  nurse  agencies  should  be 
recruited.

Statistical analyses

All  analyses  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  inten-
tion to treat (ITT) model. The effect of the intervention 
on primary and secondary outcomes was estimated using 
linear  mixed  models,  which  allowed  for  missing  data  to 
be taken into account within the statistical model. In this 
study, a three-level model was used, with repeated mea-
sures  nested  in  participants  and  participants  nested  in 
clusters.  Time  (baseline,  1-month  follow-up,  6-month 
follow-up)  was  considered  level  1,  individual  caregivers 
were  considered  level  2,  and  clusters  (psychiatric  visit-
ing  nurse  agencies)  were  considered  level  3.  For  fixed 
effects,  condition  (BFP  programme  versus  TAU),  time, 
and  the  two-way  interaction  effect  of  condition  by  time 
were included. Models were adjusted for baseline differ-
ences in caregiver socio-demographics such as age, gen-
der, education, household income, family relationship to 
the person with schizophrenia, length of caregiving, and 
length of psychiatric visiting nurse system use. Subgroup 

analyses  were  conducted  separately  among  respondents 
who  had  mild  or  higher  caregiver  burden  (ZBI-22  score 
of  21  or  higher)  at  baseline.  A  p-value  of  less  than  0.05 
was  considered  statistically  significant.  SPSS  (Windows 
version 27) was used for statistical analysis.

Changes to the protocol

Two  changes  for  statistical  analyses  were  made  to  the 
registered  protocol  [24].  One  was  analysis  for  rehospi-
talisation. We had intended to conduct Cox proportional 
hazards  regression  models  with  multiple  levels  for  the 
dichotomous question of hospitalisation by 6-month fol-
low-up. However, we were unable to perform the analysis 
because  the  date  of  admission  was  not  available  for  one 
participant. Therefore, the number of hospitalisations by 
6-month follow-up was just described and the chi-square 
test  was  conducted.  The  other  change  was  a  subgroup 
analysis to clarify the effect of the BFP programme based 
on the existence of caregiver burden (ZBI-22 score of 21 
or  higher).  We  determined  that  study  participants  had 
relatively a low level of caregiver burden compared with 
participants  of  previous  studies  [17–19]  and  the  effect 
of the BFP programme may have been weakened by the 
floor effect.

visiting  nurse  agencies  were  allocated  to  intervention 
group  and  22  psychiatric  visiting  nurse  agencies  were 
allocated to the TAU group. Thirteen psychiatric visiting 
nurse  agencies  (eight  in  the  intervention  group  and  five 
in the TAU group) could not recruit any participants. Of 
the  34  psychiatric  visiting  nurse  agencies  that  recruited 
participants, 83 family caregivers of people with schizo-
phrenia  and  83  people  with  schizophrenia  completed 
the  baseline  survey.  At  the  6-month  follow-up  survey, 
17  agencies  (100%),  43  family  caregivers  of  people  with 
schizophrenia (100%), and 40 people with schizophrenia 
(93%) in the intervention group and 15 agencies (88%), 36 
family caregivers of people with schizophrenia (90%), and 
33  people  with  schizophrenia  (83%)  in  the  TAU  group 
completed  the  follow-up  survey.  Reasons  for  dropping 
out  included  rehospitalisation  (n2 = 6)  and  the  COVID-
19 pandemic (k = 2, n1 = 4, n2 = 4), where k is the number 
of psychiatric visiting nurse agencies, n1 is the number of 
family caregivers of people with schizophrenia, and n2 is 
the number of people with schizophrenia.

Baseline characteristics

Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of family 
caregivers of people with schizophrenia (n = 83) at base-
line. Most participating family caregivers of people with 
schizophrenia were elderly mothers who were not work-
ing. Half of participating family caregivers had experience 

with  care  for  more  than  10  years.  Table  2  describes  the 
demographic  characteristics  of  people  with  schizophre-
nia  (n = 83)  at  baseline.  Most  participating  people  with 
schizophrenia were unemployed and never married, had 
schizophrenia for more than 10 years, and had used psy-
chiatric visiting nurse services for more than 3 years. The 
average  number  of  lifetime  hospitalisations  was  3.0  in 
the intervention group and 4.7 in the TAU group. Three 
participants (7%) in the intervention group and two par-
ticipants  (5%)  in  the  TAU  group  had  been  hospitalised 
within 6 months before the study.

Effects of the BFP programme on the primary outcome

Table  3  presents  the  effects  of  the  BFP  programme  by 
psychiatric visiting nurses on the primary outcome. The 
BFP  programme  decreased  caregiver  burden  but  the 
effect  size  was  small.  However,  adjusted  mean  differ-
ences (aMDs) between the groups were not significant at 
both the 1-month follow-up (aMD = 0.27, 95% CI = − 5.48 
to  6.03,  p = 0.93,  d = 0.01)  and  the  6-month  follow-up 
(aMD = − 2.12,  95%  CI = − 7.80  to  3.56,  p = 0.45,  d = 0.11). 
Table 4 shows the subgroup analysis. The effect size was 
larger  when  stratified  by  the  presence  of  care  burden 
(ZBI-22  score  of  21  or  higher)  compared  to  the  whole 
sample, but there were no significant differences between 
the groups.

Effects of the BFP programme on secondary outcomes

Table 3 shows the effects of the BFP programme on sec-
ondary  outcomes.  For  family  caregivers  of  people  with 
schizophrenia,  there  were  no  statistically  significant 
effects of the BFP programme on K6, GSES, WHO-5, or 
KIDI  at  the  1-month  follow-up.  No  statistically  signifi-
cant effects of the BFP programme were observed for K6, 
GSES, or WHO-5 at the 6-month follow-up. For people 
with  schizophrenia,  BASIS-32  and  WHO-5  scores  were 
not statistically significantly different between the groups 
at  the  1-month  or  6-month  follow-up.  The  number  of 
people with schizophrenia who were admitted to the hos-
pital  by  6-month  follow-up  was  five  (12%)  in  the  inter-
vention group and four (10%) in the TAU group (χ2 = 0.06, 
p = 0.81).

Program adherence

All  participants  (100%)  in  the  intervention  group  com-
pleted the four sessions of the BFP programme in accor-
dance with the protocol.

Discussion
Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the BFP pro-
gramme  did  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  caregiver 
burden  among  family  caregivers  of  people  with  schizo-
phrenia  compared  with  the  TAU  group.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  in  secondary  outcomes.  However, 
the attrition rates of participants were 7% in the interven-
tion  group  and  13.7%  in  the  control  group  through  the 

final follow-up, and adherence to the program was 100% 
throughout the intervention period.

The  BFP  programme  provided  by  psychiatric  visit-
ing nurses had no significant effect on caregiver burden. 
Our  results  were  consistent  with  the  study  of  Shinde  et 
al.  [16]  and  Shiraishi  et  al.  [20]. The  most  plausible  rea-
son for the absence of significant differences in both the 
primary and secondary outcomes is that the sample size 
in  this  study  was  smaller  than  planned.  This  resulted  in 
limited  statistical  power,  which  may  have  affected  the 
results.  Original  research  protocol  planned  to  continue 
recruitment of participants to meet the sample size.  On 
the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely influ-
enced  the  research  activities.  For  example,  informed 
consent  interview  and  the  60-minute  face-to-face  BFP 
sessions  increased  the  risk  of  infection,  making  addi-
tional recruitment and intervention implementation dif-
ficult. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the 
frequency of visits and shortened the time per visit in the 
usual  support.  This  resulted  in  difficulty  to  ensure  time 
spent  on  BFP.  In  summary,  small  sample  size  and  lim-
ited usual services due to the COIVD-19 pandemic may 
affect the results that we did not find significant effects of 
the  BFP  program.  Additionally,  there  were  five  assump-
tions  that  can  be  considered  for  the  lack  of  significant 
differences.  First  is  another  potential  influence  of  the 
COVID-19  pandemic.  The  6-month  follow-up  survey 
was  conducted  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  lock-
downs in Japan. There might have been unusual caregiver

burden that was difficult to alleviate through intervention 
[39]. In other words, the COVID-19 and lockdowns may 
adversely  affect  the  effectiveness  of  the  BFP  program. 
Second, the caregivers who participated in this study had 
relatively mild to moderate (21 ≤ ZBI-22 score ≤ 40) care-
giver burden, which could have led to the floor effect and 
weakened the effect of the BFP programme on caregiver 
burden. This was supported by the studies of Sharif et al. 
[17], Khoshknab et al. [18], and Hasan et al. [19], which 
targeted  populations  with  a  high  caregiver  burden  and 
had significant results, while the study of Shiraishi et al. 
[20]  included  populations  with  a  low  caregiver  burden 
and did not have significant results. Our subgroup analy-
sis also supported the fact that the effect size was larger 
when  stratified  by  level  of  care  burden.  Third,  a  Japa-
nese culture might be related to the results. In a culture 
of  shame  in  which  the  Japanese  are  uniquely  concerned 

about public views, the participating caregivers may have 
under-reported their burden. In addition, Japanese fami-
lies have a long history of being forced to take on caregiv-
ing responsibilities [40] and tend to prioritise improving 
the  lives  of  people  with  schizophrenia  over  their  own 
internal challenges [39]. As a results, some family mem-
bers  tend  to  feel  ashamed  of  having  a  sense  of  caregiv-
ing burden. This may have contributed to the floor effect 
and weakened the effect of intervention. Forth, the inter-
vention  might  have  been  inadequately  implemented. 
Although  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  received  a  1-day 
lecture, they might not have been able to acquire all the 
skills needed to successfully provide the BFP programme. 
Fifth, the psychiatric visiting nurses in the control group 
might  have  become  more  aware  of  family  support 
because of participating in the study. This may have led to

more extensive normal family support and a reduction in 
caregiver burden.

This  study  had  four  strengths.  First,  this  study  had  a 
cRCT  design  and  included  34  psychiatric  visiting  nurse 
agencies  in  4  prefectures  in  Japan  (Tokyo,  Saitama, 
Kanagawa,  and  Chiba).  The  multi-site  implementation 
could have increased the representativeness of the study 
population  seen  in  the  real  world.  Second,  the  attrition 
rate of participants was less than 20% from the baseline 
to  the  6-month  follow-up,  which  could  have  reduced 
withdrawal bias. Third, all participants in the BFP group 
attended  all  the  sessions,  which  could  imply  that  family 
caregivers and people with schizophrenia considered the 
programme  meaningful,  although  we  did  not  assess  the 
usefulness  of  the  programme  through  qualitative  inter-
views. Fourth, the BFP programme contents were devel-
oped  through  a  co-productive  process  that  involved  a 
wide  variety  of  stakeholders,  including  family  members 
and  experts,  suggesting  that  the  programme  could  be 
improved and enriched by adding perspectives based on 
the  unique  experiences  of  family  caregivers  that  are  dif-
ficult for experts to recognize.

This  study  had  three  limitations.  First,  the  number 
of  participants  was  small  compared  to  the  planned 
sample size, and statistical power was limited. Second, 
the characteristics of participants might have been dif-
ferent from those of non-participants such as caregiv-
ers  with  high  care  burden,  which  might  have  reduced 
the external validity of this study. Third, there was the 
possibility  that  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  in  the  TAU 
group  could  have  received  information  about  the  BFP 
programme  from  psychiatric  visiting  nurses  in  the 
intervention group because the nurses in the interven-
tion  and  TAU  groups  work  for  the  same  organisation. 
This possible contamination might have weakened the 
intervention effect.

Implications for future research

This  study  yields  several 
implications  for  future 
research  endeavours.  Firstly,  future  studies  should 
undertake  a  cRCT  with  adequate  sample  sizes,  focus-
ing on enrolling families enduring high caregiving bur-
dens.  Refinements  in  recruitment  methodologies  are 
needed  to  ensure  that  families  receive  comprehensive 
information  about  the  study  through  their  accessible 
means,  such  as  an  online  session.  Moreover,  tailoring 
the  intervention  schedule  to  offer  more  flexibility  for 
families with heavy caregiving burdens could enhance 
participation.  For  instance,  adjusting  the  duration 
based on the needs of the caregivers might be benefi-
cial. This is because some caregivers may find shorter, 
more  focused  sessions  to  be  helpful,  while  others 
may  prefer  extended  interactions  for  deeper  discus-
sions.  Providing  separate,  private  consultations  for 

family members, distinct from those with schizophre-
nia,  might  be  a  beneficial  strategy,  given  that  caregiv-
ers  could  have  reservations  or  concerns  that  they  are 
reluctant  to  disclose  in  a  shared  setting.  Indeed,  the 
COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the imple-
mentation  of  our  study.  The  challenges  presented  by 
the pandemic highlight the need for online family psy-
choeducation.  This  could  be  a  crucial  tool  in  ensur-
ing  continuous  support  and  effective  interventions  in 
similar  future  scenarios.  A  recruitment  strategy  that 
screens  families  based  on  caregiving  burden  could 
potentially  increase  participation  rates.  Secondly,  the 
BFP  could  benefit  from  qualitative  surveys  target-
ing  various  families  and  psychiatric  visiting  nurses 
to  accumulate  feedback  on  satisfaction  and  potential 
enhancements.  Such  an  approach  would  ensure  that 
the program reflects a variety of perspectives, thereby 
improving  its  generalizability.  Finally,  psychiatric  vis-
iting  nurses’  quality  evaluation  and  reproducibility  of 
the  BFP  are  essential.  The  development  of  a  fidelity 
scale  could  facilitate  the  assessment  of  the  reproduc-
ibility  and  consistency  of  the  BFP  across  diverse  set-
tings.  Essential  advancements  toward  enhancing  the 
program’s  efficacy  might  also  encompass  evaluating 
practical  training  for  psychiatric  visiting  nurses,  inte-
grating  expert  insights  into  family  support  training, 
and examining the resulting influence of such training.

Conclusions
In  the  present  study,  BFP  provided  by  psychiatric  vis-
iting  nurses  did  not  significantly  reduce  the  family’s 
sense  of  caregiving  burden.  Therefore,  it  is  difficult 
to  recommend  the  BFP  programme  developed  by  this 
study  for  use  in  clinical  practice  as  is.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  results,  in  which  all  study  participants  in 
the BFP intervention group attended all sessions, sug-
gest that BFP delivered by psychiatric visiting nurses is 
partly  feasible.  Therefore,  future  research  is  expected 
to  develop  and  study  more  effective  practices  while 
maintaining  feasibility.  Specific  challenges  for  future 
research  will  require  cRCTs  to  be  conducted  with 
study  subjects  that  meet  the  sample  size  and  include 
family members with higher care burden. At the same 
time,  it  is  necessary  to  improve  the  BFP  programme 
and ensure the quality-of-service provision by creating 
fidelity,  and  to  reconsider  the  content  of  training  for 
psychiatric visiting nurses and verify its effectiveness.
