We provide a systematic review of epidemiological surveys of autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorders
(PDDs) worldwide. A secondary aim was to consider the possible impact of geographic, cultural/ethnic, and socioeco-
nomic factors on prevalence estimates and on clinical presentation of PDD. Based on the evidence reviewed, the median
of prevalence estimates of autism spectrum disorders was 62/10 000. While existing estimates are variable, the evidence
reviewed does not support differences in PDD prevalence by geographic region nor of a strong impact of ethnic/cultural
or socioeconomic factors. However, power to detect such effects is seriously limited in existing data sets, particularly in
low-income countries. While it is clear that prevalence estimates have increased over time and these vary in different
neighboring and distant regions, these ﬁndings most likely represent broadening of the diagnostic concets, diagnostic
switching from other developmental disabilities to PDD, service availability, and awareness of autistic spectrum disorders
in both the lay and professional public. The lack of evidence from the majority of the world’s population suggests a
critical need for further research and capacity building in low- and middle-income countries. Autism Res 2012, 5:

Introduction

Autism is a life-long neurodevelopmental condition in-
terfering with the person’s ability to communicate and
relate to others. Since the earliest epidemiological sur-
veys in the 1960s, a wealth of data has become available,
indicating a much higher prevalence of the condition
than previously thought [Fombonne, 2003a, 2005; Fom-
bonne, Quirke, & Hagen, 2011]. It is now recognized
that some individuals with the condition are able to
lead independent and fulﬁlling lives, whereas for others
the impact can be severe, interfering signiﬁcantly with
quality of life [Farley et al., 2009]. While the global
burden of autism is currently unknown, in the United
States and in the UK, the annual societal cost of the
condition exceeds several billions [Ganz, 2007; Knapp,
Romeo, & Beecham, 2007].

Increased recognition, understanding, and awareness
of autism in the last few decades have been, in part,

driven by the signiﬁcant growth in research evidence.
While many aspects of autism remain poorly under-
stood, major advances have been made in terms of
highlighting the genetic [Abrahams & Geschwind,
2008], biological [Belmonte et al., 2004], environmental
[Currenti, 2009], and developmental
[Elsabbagh &
Johnson, 2010] origins of the condition. Large-scale
and well controlled cohort studies (e.g., http://www.
earlistudy.org) following-up pregnant mothers are likely
to clarify the effects of some pre- and perinatal risk factors
implicated in autism. Signiﬁcant strides have also con-
tributed towards developing and validating screening
and diagnostic instruments, helping to reduce heteroge-
neity in clinical characterization in research studies.
While some of these diagnostic tools remain highly
resource intensive, they are increasingly used in clinical
settings, as they provide rich and systematic information
to inform service provisions where those are available.
However, even in high-income countries, provisions

for screening, diagnosis, and intervention are highly
variable and many cases absent in community settings.
Such advances in autism research have contributed
towards bridging the gap between evidence and practice
in some countries, but there is little systematic infor-
mation available with regards to the impact of the con-
dition on most of the world’s population. Frequently
regarded as essential for advancing basic research and
strategic for informing policy and developing services,
epidemiological studies have emerged as a clear priority
within several global
initiatives. The charity Autism
Speaks in partnership with the US Center for Disease
Control (CDC) launched the International Autism Epide-
miology Network (http://www.autismepidemiology.net),
bringing together researchers worldwide and focusing
in developing
speciﬁcally on service improvements
countries. According to the network, prevalence studies
for PDD are ongoing in Australia, Mexico, Finland,
Portugal, Iceland, India, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Africa,
than
and Uganda. Focusing on a broader context
autism, the Movement for Global Mental Health has
identiﬁed a clear treatment gap, particularly pronoun-
ced in low- and middle-income countries
[http://
www.globalmentalhealth.org; Patel et al., 2008]. Epide-
miological data on the burden of mental and neurolo-
gical disorders and systematic mapping of
relevant
services in low- and middle-income countries encou-
raged World Health Organization (WHO) to launch the
mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) [WHO,
2008]. Moreover, the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease,
which groups
including Australia’s
National Health Medical Research Council, the Canadian
Institutes of Health Research, the Chinese Academy of
Medical Science, the UK’s Medical Research Council,
and the United States’ National Institutes of Health,
announced a program to identify the world’s “Grand
in Global Mental Health” (http://www.
Challenges
grandchallenges.org). The reasons for why epidemio-
logical surveys are viewed as a priority extend beyond
the need for objective and robust estimates of pre-
valence. These provide additional valuable beneﬁts as
they often result in systematic information regarding
existing services and may help in assessing the needs
and priorities for each community. In the long run,
the availability of comparable estimates from different
geographic regions may also enable testing challenging
hypotheses regarding the etiology of PDD.

Systematic Review Methodology

The primary aim of this report is to provide an up-to-
date and systematic review of the methodological fea-
tures and substantive results of epidemiological surveys
of the prevalence of pervasive developmental disorders

(PDDs), including autistic disorder (AD) worldwide. This
is to our knowledge the ﬁrst attempt to review available
evidence from different world regions, including low-
and middle-income countries. While the scope of the
current review does not provide extensive coverage of
the situation in all countries, every effort was made to
represent objectively available evidence from regions
where research capacity is limited.

Search Strategies

We adopted a systematic review methodology in the
identiﬁcation of epidemiological reports included in
the current article. First, as a preliminary step, key ﬁnd-
ings from previous reviews of epidemiological surveys
were incorporated into the current report [Fombonne,
2003a, 2005; Fombonne et al., 2011; Sun & Allison, 2010;
Williams, Higgins, & Brayne, 2006]. Second, several
authors or group of authors undertook a comprehensive
review of available evidence from regions that were
underrepresented in previous reviews. Different coun-
tries were grouped into subregions according to the
WHO classiﬁcation. The main search strategy was to
perform extensive region and/or country-speciﬁc search
of Medline publications. When the authors were familiar
with additional local or regional search engines, these
were also used. Additional search sources included
IndMed search engine, indmed.nic.in national medical
database, VIP.cn Chinese search engine, and arabpsy-
net.com regional engine. Search terms included Autis*,
Asperger, Autistic Disorder and Child Development and
Disorders, Pervasive (mesh term), or their other-language
equivalent. In regions where it was difﬁcult to identify
epidemiological reports, authors also consulted other
researchers and practitioners who supplied references
or information. Using these strategies authors identiﬁed
and reviewed over 600 studies typically not included in
previous reviews (133 from South and Central America,
and the Caribbean, 319 from South East Asia and the
Western Paciﬁc, and 130 from the Eastern Mediterranean,
54 from Africa). Languages of the identiﬁed articles
included Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, Portu-
guese, and Spanish.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria of Prevalence Estimate

From the identiﬁed publications, the following crite-
ria were used for selecting epidemiological surveys
included in Tables I–III:

(cid:129) A full article (published or otherwise) was available in
a language that could be read by one of the authors.
(cid:129) The primary aim of the survey was to estimate
prevalence of PDD and/or narrower AD. Studies
exclusively focusing on other categories of PDD,

Combining and Appraising Results

Each group of authors focusing on speciﬁc WHO regions

included the following: (a) general context and back-
ground for the region covered; (b) key ﬁndings on preva-
lence estimates entered into the same format presented
in Tables I–III; (c) key ﬁndings clinical characterization
summarized qualitatively; and (d) commentary on oppor-
tunities and barriers in conducting research in the region
covered. Studies included were appraised by each group

Methodological Issues and Interpretation of
Prevalence Estimates

Before summarizing the key ﬁndings related to preva-
lence and clinical characterization, we will discuss some
methodological issue that need to be accounted for when
interpreting epidemiological data. These include charac-
terization of PDD, changes in concepts over time, and
case identiﬁcation and evaluation.

Characterization of PDD

Over time, the deﬁnitions of autism have changed as
illustrated by the numerous diagnostic criteria that were
used in both epidemiological and clinical settings. Start-
ing with the narrowly deﬁned Kanner’s autism, deﬁni-
tions progressively broadened in the criteria proposed by
Rutter [Rutter, 1970], and then International Classiﬁca-
tion of Diseases (ICD)-9 [WHO, 1975], Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III [Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association, 1980] and DSM-III-R [Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association, 1987], and more recently in
the two major nosographies used worldwide: ICD-10
[WHO, 1992] and DSM-IV [American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 1994]/DSM-IV-TR [American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2000]. The ﬁrst diagnostic criteria reﬂected the more
qualitatively severe forms of the phenotype of autism,
usually associated with severe delays in language and
cognitive skills. It is only in the 1980s that less severe
forms of autism were recognized, either as a qualiﬁer for
autism occurring without intellectual disability (so-called
“high-functioning” autism), or as separate diagnostic cat-
egories (PDDs not otherwise speciﬁed [PDDNOS]) within
a broader class of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
denominated “PDDs” (an equivalent to ASD) in current
nosographies. Whilst it had been described in the litera-
ture as early as 1944, one type of PDD, Asperger disorder,
appeared in ofﬁcial nosographies only in the 1990s and,
then, with unclear validity, especially with respect to its
differentiation from “high-functioning” autism. Subtypes
of PDD that existed in DSM-III subsequently disappeared
(i.e., autism—residual state). While there is generally high
inter-rater reliability on the diagnosis of PDDs and com-
monality of concepts across experts, some differences

166

Elsabbagh et al./Global epidemiology of autism

INSAR

persist between nomenclatures about the terminology
and precise operationalized criteria of PDDs. For example,
DSM-IV [American Psychiatric Association, 1994] has a
broad category of PDDNOS, sometimes referred to loose-
ly as “atypical autism,” whereas ICD-10 [WHO, 1992]
has several corresponding diagnoses for clinical presenta-
tions that fall short of AD, which include atypical autism
(F84.1, a diagnostic category that existed already in
ICD-9), Other PDD (F84.8), and PDD, unspeciﬁed (F84.9).
In the recent years, the research deﬁnitions of syn-
dromes falling on the autism spectrum have been
expanded further with an increasing reliance on a dimen-
sionalization of the autism phenotype. As no impair-
ment or diagnostic criteria are available for these milder
forms, the resulting boundaries with the spectrum of
PDDs are left uncertain. Whether or not this plays a role
in more recent epidemiological studies is difﬁcult to
know, but the possibility should be considered in assess-
ing results for the new generation of surveys. While the
vast majority of studies have relied on these common
nosographies, culturally speciﬁc instruments and systems
have been used. For example, the Chinese Classiﬁcation
of Mental Disorders (CCMD) has been used in some of
the studies appearing in Chinese journals and often com-
bined with other classiﬁcation systems.

Case Identiﬁcation

When an area or population has been identiﬁed for a
survey, different strategies have been used to ﬁnd partici-
pants matching the case deﬁnition retained for the study.
Some studies have solely relied on existing service pro-
viders databases [Croen, Grether, Hoogstrate, & Selvin,
2002]; on special educational databases [Fombonne,
Zakarian, Bennett, Meng, & McLean-Heywood, 2006;
Gurney et al., 2003; Lazoff, L., Piperni, & Fombonne,
2010]; or on national registers [Madsen et al., 2002] for
case identiﬁcation. These studies have the common limi-
tation of relying on a population group who happened
to access the service provider or agencies rather than
sampling from the population at large. As a result, par-
ticipants with the disorder who are not in contact with
these services are yet unidentiﬁed and not included as
cases, leading to underestimation of prevalence propor-
tion. This is a particularly signiﬁcant issue when estimat-
ing prevalence using such methods in communities with
recognized limitations in service provisions.

Other

investigations have relied on a multistage
approach to identify cases in underlying populations [e.g.,
Baird et al. 2006; Kim et al., 2011]. The aim of the ﬁrst
screening stage of these studies is to cast a wide net in order
to identify participants possibly affected with a PDD, with
the ﬁnal diagnostic status being determined at a subse-
quent phase. The process used by researchers often con-
sisted of sending letters or brief screening scales requesting

school and health professionals and/or other data sources
to identify possible cases of autism. Few investigations
have relied on systematic sampling techniques that would
ensure a near complete coverage of the target population.
Moreover, each investigation differed in several key
aspects of this screening stage. First, the thoroughness of
the coverage of all relevant data sources varied enormously
from one study to another. In addition, the surveyed areas
were not comparable in terms of service development,
reﬂecting the speciﬁc educational or health care systems of
each country and of the period of investigation. Second,
the type of information sent out to professionals invited to
identify children varied from simple letters, including a
few clinical descriptors of autism-related symptoms or
diagnostic checklists rephrased in nontechnical terms, to
more systematic screening strategy based on question-
naires or rating scales of known reliability and validity.
Third, variable participation rates in the ﬁrst screening
stages provide another source of variation in the screening
efﬁciency of surveys, although refusal rates tended, on
average, to be very low.

Few studies provided an estimate of the reliability
of the screening procedure. The sensitivity of the screen-
ing methodology is also difﬁcult to gauge in autism
surveys, and the proportion of children truly affected
with the disorder but not identiﬁed in the screening
stage (the “false negatives”) remains generally unmea-
sured. The usual approach, which consists of sampling at
random screened negative participants in order to esti-
mate the proportion of false negatives, has not been
used in these surveys for the obvious reason that, because
of the relatively low frequency of the disorder, it would
be both imprecise and very costly to undertake such
estimations. This approach may gradually change in
view of recent prevalence studies suggesting that autism
can no longer be regarded as a rare condition. In any
case, the magnitude of this of under- or over-estimation
of prevalence studies relative to “true” prevalence is cur-
rently unknown.

Case Evaluation

When the screening phase is completed, participants
identiﬁed as positive screens go through the next step
involving a more in-depth diagnostic evaluation to
conﬁrm their case status. Similar considerations about
the methodological variability across studies apply to
these more intensive assessment phases. Participation
rates in second stage assessments within the studies
reviewed were generally high. The source of information
used to determine caseness usually involved a combina-
tion of data coming from different informants and data
sources (medical records, educational sources, parents,
teachers, health professionals, etc.), with a direct assess-
ment of the person with autism being offered in some but

not all studies. Obviously, surveys of very large popula-
tions as those conducted in the United States by the CDC
[CDC, 2007a, 2007b, 2009] or in national registers
[Madsen et al., 2002] did not include a direct diagnostic
assessment of all participants by the research team.
However, these investigators could generally conﬁrm the
accuracy of their ﬁnal caseness determination by under-
taking, on a randomly selected subsample, a more com-
plete diagnostic work-up. The CDC surveys have
established a methodology for surveys of large popula-
tions that relies on screening of population using mul-
tiple data sources, a systematic review and scoring system
for the data gathered in the screening phase combined
with, in the less obvious cases, input from experienced
clinicians. This methodology is adequate for
large
samples, and is likely to be used in the future for surveil-
lance efforts. When participants are directly examined,
the assessments were conducted with various diagnostic
instruments, ranging from an unstructured examination
by a clinical expert to the use of batteries of standardized
measures by trained research staff. The Autism Diagnostic
Interview [ADI; Le Couteur et al., 1989] and/or the
Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule [ADOS; Lord
et al., 2000] have been increasingly used in the most
recent surveys in North America and some European
countries. Against this background and in view of these
diverse methodological features in the studies we report,
we now turn to the available evidence from epidemio-
logical surveys and studies on clinical characterization.

Europe
Older Prevalence Estimates

Prior to the modern conceptualization of PDD, epidemio-
logical surveys presented in Table I conducted as early as
the 1960s in Europe, mainly in Northern countries, pro-
vided useful information on rates of syndromes similar to
autism but not meeting strict diagnostic criteria for AD
then in use [Fombonne, 2003b, 2005]. At the time, dif-
ferent labels were used by authors to characterize these
clinical pictures such as the triad of impairments involv-
ing deﬁcits in reciprocal social interaction, communica-
tion, and imagination [Wing & Gould, 1979], or “autistic-
like” syndromes [Burd, Fisher, & Kerbeshan, 1987]. These
syndromes would be falling within our currently deﬁned
autistic spectrum, probably with diagnostic labels such as
atypical autism and/or PDD-NOS. In surveys providing
separate estimates of the prevalence of these develop-
mental disorders, higher rates for the atypical forms were
found compared with those for more narrowly deﬁned
AD [see Fombonne, 2003a, p.172]. This group received
little attention in previous epidemiological studies and
these participants were not counted in the numerators of
prevalence calculations, thereby underestimating system-
atically the prevalence of what would be deﬁned today as

the spectrum of ADs. For example, in the surveys con-
ducted by Lotter [Lotter, 1966] and Wing et al. [Wing,
Yeates, Brierly, & Gould, 1976], prevalence ﬁgures would
rise substantially if atypical forms had been included in
the case deﬁnition. For purpose of historical compari-
sons, it is important to be attentive to this earlier ﬁgure,
bearing in mind that the study was conducted in the
early 1970s for the ﬁeld work and that autism occurring
in participants with an IQ within the normal range was
not yet being investigated. Progressive recognition of the
importance and relevance to autism of these less typical
clinical presentations has led to changes in the design of
more recent epidemiological surveys (see following dis-
cussion) that are now using case deﬁnitions that incor-
porate upfront these milder phenotypes.

Recent Prevalence Estimates

Available studies from Northern European countries (UK,
Iceland, Denmark, Sweden) provide estimates for com-
bined PDD as well as AD. Much less data are available
from other European countries, namely from France,
Germany, Portugal, and Israel. Sample sizes of multiple
surveys estimating AD varied from 826 to 490 000 par-
ticipants, with an age range of birth to adulthood. Preva-
lence rates varied from 1.9/10 000 to 72.6/10 000 with
a median value of 10.0/10 000. In studies published since
1999, the median rate was 18.75/10 000. Studies provid-
ing estimate for combined PDD ranged in sample size
from 2536 to 134 661 participants. All these surveys
were published since 2000, and the majority since 2006.
The diagnostic criteria reﬂect reliance on modern diag-
nostic schemes. There was high variation in prevalence
proportions that ranged from a low 30.0/10 000 to a
high of 116.1/10 000, with a median rate of 61.9/10 000.
The wide range of prevalence estimates reported
in these studies may be attributed, at least in part, to
methodological issues outlined earlier. Furthermore, such
estimates should always be regarded in the context of the
imperfect sensitivity of case ascertainment that results
in downward biases in prevalence proportions. For
example,
in the Danish investigation [Madsen et al.,
2002], case ﬁnding depended upon notiﬁcation to a
National Registry, a method that is usually associated
with lower sensitivity for case ﬁnding. By contrast, case-
ﬁnding techniques used in other surveys relied on mul-
tiple and repeated screening phases,
involving both
different informants at each phase and surveying the
same cohorts at different ages, which certainly maxi-
mized the sensitivity of case identiﬁcation [Baird et al.,
2006; Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2005].

Clinical Presentation

Clinical characterization in Europe has increasingly
relied on standardized measures, serving to reduce

168

Elsabbagh et al./Global epidemiology of autism

INSAR

heterogeneity in clinical judgment. Assessments in seve-
ral of the studies summarized earlier were often perfor-
med with these diagnostic measures that match the more
dimensional approach for case deﬁnition. Extensive dis-
cussion of clinical presentation has been previously pre-
sented based on these studies [Fombonne, 2003a, 2005].
To summarize, males consistently outnumbered females
in the vast majority of studies, with a ratio ranging from
1.33 to 16.0 for AD and 3.3 to 15.7 for PDD. In studies
where IQ scores were available, the proportion of partici-
pants with normal
IQ was 15.6–86.7% for AD and
45–85.3% for PDD. A few studies provided information
on the social class of the families of autistic children. Of
these, two older studies [Brask, 1972; Lotter, 1966] sugges-
ted an association between autism and social class or
parental education. Studies conducted thereafter provi-
ded no evidence for the association. Thus, the epidemio-
logical results suggest that the earlier ﬁndings were
probably due to artifacts in the availability of services and
in the case-ﬁnding methods, as already shown in other
samples [Schopler, Andrews, & Strupp, 1979; Wing, 1980].
Some investigators have mentioned the possibility that
rates of autism might be higher among immigrants in
Northern Europe [Gillberg, 1987; Gillberg, Schaumann, &
Gillberg, 1995; Gillberg, Steffenburg, & Schaumann,
1991; Wing, 1980]. A meta analysis including ﬁve studies
found weak (nonsigniﬁcant) association between autism
and mother’s birthplace [in the country where the study
was conducted vs. abroad; Gardener, Spiegelman, & Buka,
2009]. Serious methodological caveats related to these
comparisons have been extensively discussed, including
small samples, variation in rate of immigration in the
areas samples, and the lack of a reasoned biologically
plausible hypothesis linking immigration to autism
[Fombonne, 2005].

Complex sociobiological [Gillberg et al., 1995; Gillberg
et al., 1991] and environmental routes [Dealberto, 2011]
have been suggested to explain the differences reported
across a range of studies but none have been formally
tested. In trying to ascertain factors that might explain
differences in rates among immigrants and nonimmi-
grants, a recent study in the Netherlands [Begeer, Bouk,
Boussaid, Terwogt, & Koot, 2009] showed that ethnic
minorities were underrepresented among cases referred
to autism institutions. Yet, the study also found that bias
in clinical judgment among pediatricians may lead to
under-referral. Moreover, the same bias was no longer
apparent when pediatricians were asked to provide
explicit structured ratings of the probability of autism.
Taken together, in view of methodological limitations
related to low numbers of identiﬁed cases, appropriate-
ness of the comparison data that were used and large
heterogeneity in the deﬁnition of immigrant status these
ﬁndings cannot support a difference in PDD rates among
immigrants and nonimmigrants.

Western Paciﬁc, South East Asia, and the
Eastern Mediterranean
Prevalence Estimates

The oldest and most comprehensive prevalence surveys
of AD in the Western Paciﬁc Region come from Japan
and China. While studies from Japan have tended to be
published in English and have been reported in previous
reviews, Chinese search engines provided a substantial
body of studies published in local journals. Studies in
this region had population size ranging from 3606 to
609 848. Since 2000, prevalence rates varied from 2.8/
10 000 to 94/10 000 with a median value of 11.6/10 000.
The median is somewhat similar (13/10 000) when older
studies are included. The median value does not differ
when older studies are excluded. This rate of AD is lower
than current estimates from a comparable number of
studies in Northern Europe but resembles estimates from
older studies in that region. Only one estimate of AD was
available from South East Asia. The study conducted in
Indonesia estimated the rate of AD to be 11.7/10 000
[Wignyosumarto, Mukhlas, & Shirataki, 1992]. No esti-
mates of AD were found in the Eastern Mediterranean.

In relation to combined PDD, three were available from
the Western Paciﬁc Region. One study in Australia esti-
mated prevalence of PDD to be 39.2/10000 [Icasiano,
Hewson, Machet, Cooper, & Marshall, 2004]. The highest
rate of PDD internationally comes from a recent Korean
study estimating the prevalence to be 189/10 000 [Kim
et al., 2011] followed by a Japanese study estimating the
prevalence to be 181.1/10 000 [Kawamura, Takahashi, &
Ishii, 2008]. In fact, the former study [Kim et al., 2011]
also reports a high probability estimate of 264/10 000
in addition to the general population estimate. By con-
trast, a study from China [Wong & Hui, 2008] reported a
much lower estimate of 16.1/10 000. The Chinese study
also reported that ASD incidence based on registry data
in Hong Kong has been rather stable during 20 years.
Estimated rates of 5-year incidence increased slightly
from 5.19 (CI: 4.43–5.94) to 7.86 (CI: 6.68–9.05) per
10 000 over the study period.

Four estimate of PDD was available from South East
Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean. These were 100/
10 000 in Sri Lanka [Perera, Wijewardena, & Aluth-
welage, 2009], 29/10 000 in the United Arab Emirates
[Eapen, Mabrouk, Zoubeidi, & Yunis, 2007], 1.4/10 000
in Oman [Al-Farsi et al., 2010], and 6.3/10 000 in
Iran [Samadi, Mahmoodizadeh, & McConkey, 2012].
Another estimate (not included in Table II) from Iran
[1.9%, Ghanizadeh, 2008] was available but the study
did not conﬁrm diagnosis in the identiﬁed group. In
addition to these estimates, ASD incidence based on
referral statistics in Bangkok were reported to have

incidence changes
stemmed from the increase of the AD cases, not from
incidence
an increase of PDD-NOS. Additionally,
in children older than ﬁve did not change (1.52 to 1.66)
during the same period [Plubrukarn et al. 2005]. These
ﬁndings suggest that younger and more severe cases of
PDD rather than older and milder cases of children over
ﬁve years account for the increase. By contrast, the
relatively low prevalence in the Omani and Iranian
studies was attributed to prevalence caused by underdi-
agnosis and underreporting of cases resulting from
limited access to service centers [Al-Farsi et al., 2010].

Clinical Presentation—Western Paciﬁc

While detailed medical conditions and ASD phenotype
data were not available, several studies reported simila-
rities in the PDD phenotypes within this region. Exclud-
ing older studies from Japan, AD and PDD were more
prevalent in boys than girls in the epidemiological studies
in Table II. In Japan, 66.4% of participants in the study
with the highest prevalence estimate had IQ scores
within the normal range. By contrast, all cases with AD
identiﬁed in the population-based prevalence study in
China had intellectual disabilities. Zhang and Ji, [2005]
speculated that autistic children with average cognitive
function or mild intellectual disabilities might be neg-
lected during the screening and case-ascertainment
process. The Tanjin study [Zhang & Ji, 2005] reported that
the AD prevalence was higher among urban children
than children in suburban area (1.37% vs. 0.80%, respec-
tively). Authors also noted that parents in urban areas
had higher education and higher family income, leading
to better accessibility for clinical care and rehabilitation
services in these families.

Clinical Presentation—South East Asia

In addition to the two prevalence studies in Table II,
a few studies characterized relatively small samples
of children in tertiary care settings in India among a
larger literature on intellectual disabilities from the
region. The studies had a high but variable male-to-
female ratios
[Juneja, Mukherjee, & Sharma, 2004;
Kalra, Seth, & Sapra, 2005; Malhi & Singhi, 2005; Singhi
& Malhi, 2001]. Across studies, the concern that most
commonly led to referral from medical professionals
was language delay or regression in language skills, fol-
lowed by social difﬁculties and hyperactivity. Most
children received the diagnosis of ASD between 3 and 6
years [Juneja et al., 2004; Kalra et al., 2005]. The time

between recognition of symptoms by caregivers and
diagnosis averaged about 2 years. Three Indian studies
noted that the majority of families were from middle-
class backgrounds [Daley, 2004;
Juneja et al., 2004;
Singhi & Malhi, 2001] and postulated that the higher
socioeconomic families do not attend state-run faci-
lities while the lower socioeconomic groups may not
access care unless the child is acutely ill. Regression of
skills was found in 25% of the children in one study
[Singhi & Malhi, 2001]. Seizures were associated with
ASD in 6.8–31% of children [Daley, 2004; Juneja et al.,
2004; Kalra et al., 2005]. Intellectual disability was the
most common co-morbid condition ranging from 24 to
95% of children. Perinatal events were examined in
three studies [Juneja et al., 2004; Kalra et al., 2005; Malhi
& Singhi, 2005]; two reported such events in up to 25%
of the children whereas the third found no signiﬁcant
perinatal events.

Clinical Presentation—Eastern Mediterranean

Similar to other regions, a number of studies report a
high but variable male-to-female ratios [Al-Farsi et al.,
2010; Al-Salehi, Al-Hifthy, & Ghaziuddin, 2009; Eapen
et al., 2007; Seif Eldin et al., 2008]. The gender ratio in
the Iranian study was more equally distributed between
males and females [Ghanizadeh, 2008], but the rate
reported in this study most likely reﬂects that of PDD
symptoms among school-aged children rather than esti-
mates of the disorder because a stage of diagnostic con-
ﬁrmation was not conducted [Ghanizadeh, 2008]. One
study from Saudi Arabia reported that girls were older
than boys in a tertiary referral center [Al-Salehi et al.,
2009].

Parallel ﬁndings were observed across a number of
studies
from neighboring Arabic-speaking countries
[Al-Salehi et al., 2009; Eapen et al., 2007], including one
study that combined groups of children from nine coun-
tries [Seif Eldin et al., 2008]. These studies suggest high
rates of behavioral, cognitive, and/or medical problems
among children with PDD. One study highlighted that
communication difﬁculties were a main reason for refer-
ral and reported a regressive proﬁle in 10% of cases
[Al-Farsi et al., 2010; Al-Salehi et al., 2009]. Two studies
examining family characteristics of groups of children
with PDD reported that the rate of consanguinity did
not differ from a control group [Seif Eldin et al., 2008] or
from population estimates [Al-Salehi et al., 2009]. Yet, the
affected groups typically had higher parental age, inci-
dence of pregnancy and labor complications [Seif Eldin
et al., 2008], and incidence of familial mental health
problems [Eapen et al., 2007; Seif Eldin et al., 2008]. In
the Omani study, most cases identiﬁed were in the capital
Muscat and the rates were variable across the other
regions examined [Al-Farsi et al., 2010].

America
Prevalence Estimates

The vast majority of data from this region (Table III)
comes from the United States and Canada from as early
as the 1970s. The sample sizes of studies estimating AD
were fairly large ranging from 8896 to 4 950 333 indi-
viduals. Estimates of AD varied from 0.7–40.5/10 000,
with a median of 11/10 000. Studies done since 2000,
however, yield estimates ranging from 11 to 50.5/10 000,
with a median of 21.6/10 000. Studies estimating com-
bined PDD, all of which were conducted since 2000
ranged from 8896 to 407 578 individuals in the target
population. PDD estimates varied from 34 to 90/10 000,
with a median of 65.5/10 000. Despite huge variation in
ranges, both AD and PDD median estimates correspond
closely to those derived from Northern Europe. Similar to
the latter studies, a likely underestimation of the true
population rates holds in this region as well. For example,
the Atlanta survey by the CDC [Yeargin-Allsopp et al.,
2003] was based on a very large population and included
younger age groups than subsequent CDC surveys, and
age speciﬁc rates were in fact in the 40–45/10 000 range
in some birth cohorts [Fombonne, 2003b].

Less data were available from other countries in
America. Two published studies from Argentina [Lejar-
raga et al., 2008] and Venezuela [Montiel-Nava & Peña,
2008] along with unpublished reports from Brazil [Paula,
Ribeiro, Fombonne, & Mercadante, 2011] and Mexico
[Marcín, personal communication] provided prevalence
data (Table III). There was also one study from the Carib-
bean (Aruba) [van Balkom et al., 2009]. All of the studies
had relatively small sample sizes. The two studies from
Venezuela and Aruba provided similar AD estimates of
13 and 19/10 000. With the exception of one study con-
ducted in 1982, the remaining estimates of PDD ranged
from 27 to 39.2/10 000. Administrative prevalence was
available from Mexico through a registry of minors with
disabilities reporting the number of children identiﬁed
with autism, combined with Mexican census ﬁgures.
Based on these ﬁgures the rate for childhood autism in
Mexico was estimated to be 14.3 per 10 000 [Marcín,
personal communication]. The estimates in those studies
are smaller than those reviewed earlier but it is difﬁcult
to compare the ﬁndings given the limited data and
methodological differences among studies.

Clinical Presentation

Similar to Northern Europe, clinical characterization of
PDD in the United States and Canada has increasingly
relied on standardized measures and have been previous-
ly reviewed [Fombonne, 2003a, 2005]. Across all studies
reported in Table III, the male-to-female ratio ranged from
2.2 to 5.8 for AD and from 2.7 to 6.7 for PDD. In studies
reporting IQ scores, 23.8–62.5% of participants with AD

and 31.8–60.0% of participants with PDD were reported
to have normal IQ, with the higher estimate correspond-
ing to the United States (South Carolina) and Aruba.

(10.6/1000)

The largest studies internationally to utilize comparable
methodology for examining variation of prevalence
among neighboring geographical regions were conducted
by the CDC in the United States. Findings from geo-
graphic regions falling within 10 American states found
a threefold variation of rate by state, where Alabama had
the lowest rate (3.3/1000) whereas New Jersey had the
highest
[CDC, 2007b]. Subsequent CDC
surveys found a similar variation of rates but the lowest
was in Florida (4.2/1000) and highest in Missouri and
Arizona (12.1/1000) [CDC, 2009]. The CDC surveys found
that prevalence estimates were lower in sites that relied
solely on health sources to identify cases compared with
sites that also had access to education records, and hence
a less rich database for those areas where ASD indicators
could be found. As surveillance efforts continue, it is likely
that awareness and services will develop in states that
were lagging behind, resulting in a predictable increase in
the average rate for the United States as time elapses.

CDC surveys also monitor variation in prevalence esti-
mates among different ethnic communities. In the last
survey [CDC, 2009] prevalence among white children
was greater than that among black and Hispanic children.
Similar to other world regions, service availability may
account for the observed differences. In support of this,
prevalence has increased over time across all sex, racial/
ethnic, and cognitive functioning subgroups, making it
unlikely that one group is differentially affected. Variabil-
ity of estimates as a function of income level has also
been noted. As an example, a study conducted in Texas
showed that the top decile of income had a 6 times
greater administrative prevalence than the bottom decile
[Palmer, Blanchard, Jean, & Mandell, 2005].

Africa
Prevalence Estimates

As early as 1970s, a report describing autism among
children with mental handicaps who were known to
authorities in six central and south African countries
reported a preliminary observation that the number of
cases of autism maybe smaller than those observed in
the UK [Lotter, 1978]. Findings from this preliminary
report, which was not designed as an epidemiological
survey, were never corroborated. At the time, however,
this served as crucial evidence that autism can be identi-
ﬁed across varied geographic region. Similar to the con-
clusion of a recent review on autism in Africa [Bakare &
Munir, 2011], we could not identify published data on
population-based estimates of prevalence of PDD from
African region.

Clinical Presentation

A few studies [reviewed in Ametepee & Chitiyo, 2009]
including Lotter’s [Lotter, 1978], documented unambigu-
ous recognition of autism among African children, albeit
raising some questions about the relative frequency of
some of the manifestations [Lotter, 1978; Mankoski et al.,
2006]. A higher male-to-female ratio was consistent
[Khan & Hombarume, 1996; Lotter, 1978; Mankoski
et al., 2006]. Similar to observations from other regions,
those studies suggested an over representation of higher
socioeconomic background and higher frequency of cases
with intellectual difﬁculties, i.e., the children identiﬁed
were mainly nonverbal. Yet, none of the studies used
appropriate tools for the evaluation of cognitive abilities
and similar arguments related to service accessibility
apply here as well. In one study, 3/14 cases described were
described as having developed autism after the second
year subsequent to a severe malaria infection [Mankoski
et al., 2006]. The ﬁndings, however, were never repli-
cated with appropriate sample sizes or with a prospective
rather than retrospective methodology to account for
the possibility of biased recall. In contrast to the dearth of
evidence, there has been an abundance of claims regard-
ing the prevalence and etiology of the autism in Africa
[reviewed in Ametepee & Chitiyo, 2009; Bakare & Munir,
2011]. The clinical presentation of the condition in this
region remains elusive.

PDD in the Global Context: Prevalence,
Determinants, and Burden
Global Variation in Prevalence Estimates

Epidemiological surveys of autism and AD and PDD
(summarized inFigs 1 and 2) have now been conducted in
several countries. Methodological differences in case deﬁ-
nition and case-ﬁnding procedures make between survey
comparisons difﬁcult to perform. However, most studies
conducted since the year 2000 in different geographical
regions and by different teams converge to estimates to a
median of 17/10 000 for AD and 62/10 000 for all PDDs
combined (Table IV). This is currently the best estimate
for the prevalence of PDDs available. The estimate repre-
sents an average ﬁgure and there is substantial variability
across studies.

Notwithstanding considerable variability across and wi-
thin geographical regions, estimates of AD collected since
the year 2000 in America, Western Paciﬁc, and Europe do
not differ statistically (P = 0.3). While considerably less
studies have been conducted on PDD, those estimates do
not differ between America and Europe. The global mean
prevalence of 62/10 000 translates into one child out of
160 with a PDD. Some well-controlled studies have,
however, reported rates that are two to three times higher
[Baird et al., 2006; Kawamura et al., 2008; Kim et al.,

2011]. By contrast, in many regions of the world includ-
ing Africa, prevalence estimates are either unavailable or
preliminary. Moreover, within each of the regions cove-
red, the majority of studies were conducted in circum-
scribed regions, namely,
Japan,
China, and the United States. With the exception of
China, countries where a relatively large evidence base
exists are high-income countries. A few studies have been
conducted in middle-income countries and no prevalence
estimates were available from any low-income country.

in northern Europe,

Our minimal criteria for inclusion of prevalence esti-
mates described in the previous section were motivated
by the need for a systematic and comprehensive account
of available estimates. However, given the signiﬁcant
variability in resulting prevalence estimates, and the vari-
ability in methodological features outlined earlier, the
estimates should be considered with caution. Speciﬁcally,
these should not be considered as reﬂecting “world-wide”
estimates, but rather, a general reﬂection of the current
state of evidence from various regions. As we note in the
ﬁnal section, our ﬁndings offer critical public health
messages regarding the need for scaling of services as well
as research in most of the world’s regions.

Phenotypic presentation of PDD

As early as the 1970s, the phenotypic characteristics of
autism have been observed and described across a wide
range of geographical, economic, social and cultural set-
tings. Based on available evidence world-wide, the higher
ratio in males relative to females is consistently observed.
It is also clear that PDD is associated with a degree of
intellectual impairment among a signiﬁcant portion of
those affected. Yet, the range of variation in gender ratio
and intellectual functioning is vast. By contrast, very few
studies examined the impact geographical, economic,
social and cultural factors directly and, on the whole, the
ﬁndings indicate little impact. Differences in such fac-
tors reported retrospectively in large-scale surveys such
as those conducted by the CDC [CDC, 2007a, 2007b] may
be accounted for entirely by differences in service provi-
sions, richness of registered data, and community aware-
ness. Moreover, there is a striking absence of controlled
studies examining the potential impact of such factors
on the understanding, experience, expression, and help-
seeking for autism, masking the true global burden of the
condition. Some positive indicators suggest improved
identiﬁcation of autism in low-resource countries, as
inferred from the increase in referrals and identiﬁed cases
[e.g., Plubrukarn et al., 2005]. Yet, it has also been sug-
gested that regional variation in parental education
may still determine their help seeking for autism [Seif
Eldin et al., 2008] and that it is predominantly severe
cases that are currently being identiﬁed in poor commu-
nities [Daley, 2004; Juneja et al., 2004; Singhi & Malhi,

2001]. Such possibilities require conﬁrmation in future
large-scale controlled studies.

The data we reviewed is also relevant for the ongoing
debate regarding time trends in autism. Considering
all studies conducted since the 1960s, prevalence data
suggest that there is a correlation between AD estimates
and year of publication (r = 0.4, P < 0.01, R2 = 18.5%).
While this simple test is limited by the considerable
variation, it does conﬁrm that when data is considered
from several world regions there is indeed a rise in
prevalence over time, conﬁrming previous conclusions.
Such time trends have given rise to the hypothesis that
there is a secular increase in rates of autism. However in
view of a number of conceptual and methodological
reasons, no inference related to trends in the incidence
of PDDs can be derived from a simple comparison of
prevalence rates over time. In particular, it is crucial to
differentiate prevalence (the proportion of individuals in
a population who suffer from a deﬁned disorder at any
one point in time) from incidence (the number of new
cases occurring in a population over a period of time).
Prevalence is useful to estimate needs and plan services;
only incidence rates can be used for causal research.
Both prevalence and incidence estimates will increase
when case deﬁnition is broadened and case ascertain-
ment is improved. Time trends in rates can therefore
only be gauged in investigations that hold these param-
factors
eters under strict control over time. Several
accounting for this rise have been proposed and dis-
cussed extensively in previous studies. These factors
include: (a) the broadening of diagnostic criteria; (b) the
increased efﬁciency over time in case identiﬁcation
methods used in surveys as well as changes in diagnostic
practices; and (c) the diagnostic substitution (or switch-
ing) when some diagnostic categories become increas-
ingly familiar to health professionals and/or when access
to better services is insured by using a new diagnostic
category.

The Way Forward
Prospects and Challenges in Global Epidemiological
Research

Because signiﬁcant costs are associated with prevalence
studies, some have questioned whether country-speciﬁc
estimates should be a priority, especially where resources
are limited and priorities
include preventable life-
threatening conditions. Such epidemiological studies are
useful, however, for assessing needs and priorities within
each community. Epidemiological studies often provide
systematic information regarding the availability, quality,
and accessibility of existing services. These studies also
require development of valid tools for systematic clinical
characterization, including screening and/or diagnostic
instruments that can be useful for immediate improve-
ments in training, services, and awareness, as well as
facilitating future research. As such, epidemiological
research may be viewed as a systematic framework for
unveiling local burden and informing policy and research.
The power of epidemiological research extends well
beyond the communities in which it is conducted, par-
ticularly in view of mounting speculation regarding time
trends and the potential impact of geographical and
socioeconomic factors on the prevalence and possibly on
the incidence of autism. While research within a global
context is likely to help address such perplexing puzzles,
currently, available evidence is extremely limited. There
is also a clear need for better theoretical and experimental
modelling to test the possible mechanisms through
which various factors may have an impact on incidence,
clinical presentation, or both. Studies using comparable
methodology to estimate prevalence across different geo-
graphical regions and to monitor changes to it over time
provide a powerful approach. Such ﬁndings may address
whether certain factors, environmental or otherwise,
operating in speciﬁc regions, have a disproportionate
impact on prevalence over time as well as ascertain the

true global burden of the condition. Moreover, epidemio-
logical studies can be potentially translated into public
health practices through developing or validating screen-
ing and diagnostic methods and though strengthening
capacity for services.

Rapid developments in the public policy context for
autism in various regions have given rise to promising
opportunities for furthering research in this area. A num-
ber of parent and professional led groups as well as gov-
ernmental agencies have been established around the
world, who are actively working on creating awareness,
services, and advocacy for people with PDD. While the
critical need for population-based studies of the epidemi-
ology of PDD may be evident, it is essential to also con-
sider the likely reasons for the current lack of such data.

Funding for research in some countries is dispropor-
tionate to the burden of disease they face (referred to as
the 10/90 gap, that is, only 10% of global spending on
health research is directed towards the problems that
primarily affect the poorest 90% of the world’s popula-
tion). There is limited local capacity to conduct research
in these settings, let alone research in ﬁeld of childhood
autism. Despite this situation being common to several
low- and middle-income countries, our review high-
lighted that regional or country-speciﬁc economic and
development capacity only one factor contributing to
the scarcity of data. More general contextual difﬁculties
may be encountered in conducting epidemiological
surveys worldwide. First, the epidemiological research
concept of PDD is relatively new, thus little cumulative
information on epidemiology of PDD are available.
Second, service availability/accessibility in many regions
remains low, which creates problems for case ﬁnding.
Third, awareness of PDD among the public as well as
clinical experts remains limited. Such contextual factors
may help explain why epidemiological data is limited
in some countries within Western Europe, where psycho-
analytic frameworks for management of PDD may still be
operative, as they were in the 1960s and 1970s in other
regions of Europe and North America (and remain opera-
tive is some parts of Europe). Hence, there is a need for
continued educational, training, and awareness programs
with speciﬁc targets tailored to the needs and resources
available for each community.

Further challenges face the research community in
particular. Diagnosis of PDD still relies on behavioral
observation, leaving room for wide variation in clinical
judgment, and in cultural and social
impact in the
identiﬁcation of biological conditions. While these
challenges have been addressed in some countries with
strong research capacity through the development and
standardization of diagnostic tools, progress has been
slow in using such instruments widely within those
countries themselves, let alone, within a global context,
where signiﬁcant cultural and linguistic variation across

and within communities needs to be accounted for. A
number of instruments have been or are in the process
of being translated and/or validated. Translation of
instruments has also been identiﬁed as a priority within
the International Epidemiology Network (http://www.
autismepidemiology.net). Yet the biggest challenge to
describing the true burden of PDD is the availability of
low cost tools for epidemiological surveys, which would
allow those to be conducted with adequate samples in
different world regions.

Further questions are often raised as to whether
research efforts need to focus on PDD in particular or
incorporate a wider range of disabilities. For example,
a group of scientists and practitioners, led by INCLEN-
India (http://www.inclentrust.org), have been developing
and validating a neurodevelopmental screening test
for use by community health workers for the detection of
10 neurodevelopmental disabilities (including ASD). This
work is leading to the emergence of a collaborative frame-
work for research on neurodevelopmental disorders in
the region to carry out multicenter epidemiological
studies with a common protocol. The availability of these
tools will provide a new opportunity for studies of the
burden, determinants and needs of families affected by
PDD in the region. Epidemiological studies themselves
may also eventually provide revealing ﬁndings regarding
the manifestation of PDD across cultures. In view of the
increased awareness of autism worldwide and the interest
from a wide range of stakeholders, research in this rela-
tively narrow area may become a vehicle for broader
improvements in evidence, and consequently in practice
standards, in child mental health in general.

Public Health Implications

Based on already available knowledge indicating that
PDDs are not limited to high-income countries; the need
for services especially in low and middle-income coun-
tries is felt more than before. It is imperative to engage
community resources and more peripheral extensions of
health systems as well. The situation in low- and middle-
income countries appears to be that child health pro-
grams focus mainly on child survival issues. Very little
attention is paid to developmental disabilities at policy
and implementation level and as a result budget alloca-
tions and human resource deployment is directed away
from these programs. For example, some regions in Africa
face a dual burden of communicable and noncom-
municable conditions, including childhood disabilities
[Murray, Lopez, Mathers, & Stein, 2001]. Dysfunctional
health systems contribute further to lack of service deliv-
ery for children with developmental disabilities. Where
they exist, access to these facilities is also hindered by
lack of effective identiﬁcation and referral programs. An
even bigger barrier has been the lack of an evidence-

176

based, affordable, package of care for people with PDD,
which could be delivered if such facilities were available.
Only recently WHO’s mhGAP has included evidence-
based and simple interventions for PPD and intellectual
disability in a package that needs to be pilot tested and
evaluated in low- and middle-income countries. This
review indicates that increase in prevalence estimates over
time most likely represent broadening of the diagnostic
concepts, diagnostic switching from other developmental
disabilities to PDD, service availability, and awareness of
autistic spectrum disorders in both the lay and profes-
sional public. This has clear public health implications
that services for different categories of developmental
disorders should not be segregated prematurely and
health systems need to consider overarching programmes
to ﬁll the gap for all developmental disorders.
