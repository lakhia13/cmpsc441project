Abstract 
Background:  This study evaluated the feasibility of a short-term, multimodal trauma-focused treatment approach 
adapted specifically for unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) in the Netherlands. This approach aims to overcome 
barriers to mental health care and to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.

Methods:  An uncontrolled study was conducted, evaluating the main request for help, treatment integrity and 
feasibility, and the course of symptoms of PTSD (Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale-13) and depression (Patient 
Health Questionnaire modified for Adolescents).

Results:  In total, 41 minors were included in the study. Most participants were male (n

made to meet the current needs of the minors. Factors limiting the feasibility of the approach were often related to 
continuous stressors, such as news concerning asylum status.

Background
Tailored  psychosocial  support  for  vulnerable  groups, 
such  as  unaccompanied  refugee  minors  (URMs),  is  of 
great  importance.  URMs  are  refugee  children  and  ado-
lescents  under  the  age  of  18,  who  have  been  separated 
from their primary caregivers [1]. In 2017, approximately

6000 URMs were under guardianship in the Netherlands, 
with  the  majority  coming  from  Eritrea,  Afghanistan,  or 
Syria. In general, refugee minors are exposed to a variety 
of stressors before and during their flight, such as forced 
migration  and  other  dangerous  circumstances.  After 
migration,  these  minors  often  continue  to  experience 
hardships,  such  as  resettlement  in  a  new  and  strange 
environment,  racial  discrimination,  isolation,  and  inse-
curities concerning family reunification and their refugee 
status.  The  potentially  traumatic  events  before  and  dur-
ing the flight, as well as the continuous stressors related

to  the  post-migration  context  can  affect  the  mental 
health of these refugee minors [2–4]. URMs are consid-
ered  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  groups  of  refugees  [5]. 
Studies indicate that, compared to accompanied minors, 
many URMs were exposed to more adverse events, such 
as sexual assault and violence [5, 6]. The vulnerability of 
URMs might be further enhanced by the separation from 
their caregivers and the lack of support that parental and 
family care can offer [7].

Altogether,  URMs  are  at  greater  risk  of  developing 
mental  health  problems  than  accompanied  minors.  A 
substantial  group  of  URMs  develop  symptoms  of  post-
traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  and/or  depression, 
which  may  become  chronic  [8].  As  mental  health  prob-
lems  during  childhood  and  adolescence  can  be  long-
lasting,  it  is  crucial  to  address  these  problems  promptly 
[9].  Furthermore,  the  continuous  stressors  URMs  face 
are likely to maintain their mental health complaints [8, 
10]. For example, Eritrean URMs and their caregivers in 
the Netherlands stated that continuous stressors, such as 
worries about their family members, the complex family 
reunification procedure, and a lack of financial resources, 
highly  affected  their  psychological  functioning.  URMs 
and  their  caregivers  suggested  that,  as  a  result,  URMs 
developed,  or  experienced  an  exacerbation  of,  sleeping 
problems,  difficulties  concentrating,  and  other  health 
issues [11].

Although  URMs  have  an  elevated  risk  of  developing 
mental  health  complaints,  few  studies  have  focused  on 
interventions  and  programmes  targeting  these  com-
plaints.  Most  of  these  studies  were  qualitative  or  based 
on case descriptions [12, 13]. To our knowledge, only one 
randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT)  was  conducted.  This 
study  showed  that  a  trauma-focused  group  intervention 
for  URMs,  drawing  on  cognitive  behavioural  principles, 
improved  self-reported  symptoms  of  PTSD  and  depres-
sion,  but  not  caregiver-reported  symptoms  [14].  More-
over,  a  case  study  and  an  uncontrolled  pilot  study  on 
trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) 
yielded preliminary evidence that this therapy is feasible 
and  may  effectively  reduce  PTSD  symptoms  in  trauma-
tized URMs [2, 13]. Finally, a recent pilot study suggested 
it  is  feasible  to  implement  Narrative  Exposure  Therapy 
(NET) for URMs [14, 15].

One  possible  reason  for  the  lack  of  intervention  stud-
ies is the number of barriers faced when offering trauma-
focused interventions to URMs. One study indicated that 
although  approximately  60%  of  the  participating  URMs 
reported  a  need  for  professional  support,  only  11.7% 
had  actually  received  this  help  [16].  Barriers  to  the  pro-
vision of adequate mental health care include individual 
barriers—such  as  linguistic  differences,  taboos  concern-
ing  mental  health  care,  lack  of  knowledge  of  the  mental 

health  system  and  mental  health  disorders,  as  well  as  a 
fear  of  stigma—and  structural  barriers—such  as  a  lack 
of financial coverage for treatment and interpreters, and 
poor access to services [7, 12, 16–19]. We therefore face 
the  challenge  of  diminishing  these  barriers  and  offering 
culturally  sensitive  and  accessible  interventions  to  this 
group of minors.

To overcome barriers to mental health care, we devel-
oped  a  short-term  (approximately  eight-session)  multi-
modal  trauma-focused  treatment  approach,  specifically 
adapted  for  URMs.  This  approach,  described  in  more 
detail  below,  includes  CBT  interventions  to  target  con-
tinuous stressors and to alleviate symptoms of depression 
and  (traumatic)  stress.  The  treatment  approach  aims  to 
overcome  individual  as  well  as  structural  barriers  by  (a) 
offering the treatment at the living location of the minors 
or another location of the minor’s choice, (b) collaborat-
ing  with  intercultural  mediators  (ICMs),  who  aided  in 
understanding cultural and language differences between 
the minor and the therapist, and (c) conducting a flexible, 
multimodal  treatment  approach  that  allows  the  treat-
ment sessions to focus on the minors’ current request for 
help.

This paper describes a pilot study designed to evaluate 
this trauma-focused treatment approach for URMs. Spe-
cifically, we explored (a) the main request for help among 
URMs  in  the  Netherlands  referred  to  the  treatment 
approach; (b) the treatment integrity (the extent to which 
we were able to apply the approach as intended) and fea-
sibility  (whether  the  approach  can  be  implemented  suc-
cessfully), and (c) the course of symptoms of PTSD and/
or depression. The information collected during this pilot 
study  was  meant  to  help  us  in  refining  the  treatment 
approach to meet the needs of URMs in the Netherlands 
adequately. The findings will also inform future efforts in 
studying treatment programmes for URMs.

Methods
Participants

Participants  were  URMs  referred  to  the  multimodal 
treatment  approach  by  their  legal  guardian  or  general 
practitioner. Inclusion criteria were being (a) a URM liv-
ing  in  the  Netherlands  under  the  guardianship  of  Nidos 
(the national guardianship institution for unaccompanied 
and separated children under the age of 18 in the Nether-
lands); (b) younger than 19 years old at referral; (c) from 
Eritrea,  Syria  or  Afghanistan;  and  (d)  with  symptoms  of 
PTSD and/or depression as reported by the legal guard-
ian/general  practitioner.  Minors  were  excluded  when 
pharmacological  treatment  or  crisis  intervention  was 
required for acute suicidality or psychosis, as these issues 
were  beyond  the  scope  of  the  multimodal  treatment

approach. In these cases therapists or youth care profes-
sionals aided in finding adequate help.

purposes. Participating therapists and ICMs gave online 
consent for the use of their data for research purposes.

As some URMs receive extended youth care after they 
turn 18, minors up to 19 years old could be referred for 
treatment. It was chosen to offer the treatment to minors 
from  Eritrea,  Syria  or  Afghanistan  because  the  major-
ity  of  URMs  in  the  Netherlands  came  from  these  coun-
tries  [20]  and  professionals  working  at  Nidos  perceived 
that minors from these countries experienced barriers to 
accessing regular mental health care. ICMs from Eritrea, 
Syria  and  Afghanistan  were  therefore  trained  to  offer 
the  treatment  approach.  Finally,  as  the  treatment  aims 
to  address  symptoms  of  PTSD  and/or  depression,  only 
minors with reported symptoms were referred. No power 
analysis was conducted to estimate the number of partic-
ipants as the aims of the current study were exploratory. 
Recruitment and inclusion ran from  October  2017 until 
March 2020.

Procedure

Guardians  were  informed  about  the  intervention  by 
youth  care  professionals  working  at  Nidos.  Guardians 
identified  minors  who  experienced  symptoms  of  PTSD 
and/or depression in addition to barriers to regular men-
tal  health  care,  such  as  low  motivation  for  treatment, 
long waiting lists, and the idea that Western health care 
would not correspond with the URM’s needs and culture. 
The  minors  were  consequently  referred  for  the  multi-
modal trauma-focused treatment approach. Next, a ther-
apist  and  ICM  visited  the  minor  at  their  living  location 
or  another  location  of  the  minor’s  choice,  for  an  intake 
interview. The  trauma-focused  treatment  approach  then 
started.  Assessments  of  psychological  complaints  and 
potentially traumatic events were carried out during the 
session  following  the  intake  interview   (t1).  Post-meas-
urements  of  psychological  complaints  were  conducted 
during the last session  (t3). After each session, therapists 
filled in a list assessing elements of programme integrity 
 (t2).  After  all  treatments  had  been  completed,  all  ICMs 
and  therapists  were  asked  to  fill  in  a  questionnaire  to 
evaluate  the  trauma-focused  treatment  approach.  The 
questionnaires  were  conducted  online  or  over  the  tel-
ephone due to restrictions related to COVID-19.

To  assure  data  integrity  and  compliance  with  ethical 
and juridical aspects, the study was reviewed by the Med-
ical  Ethics  Committee  of  the  Leiden  University  Medical 
Centre. The Committee stated the study did not require 
ethical approval as it intended to improve care as usual. 
Minors  received  verbal  information  on  the  study  and 
provided verbal or written informed consent. For minors 
below 16 years of age, legal guardians also gave verbal or 
written  consent.  The  assessments  with  the  minors  were 
part of the treatment evaluation and also used for clinical 

Measurements

All  assessments  of  the  minors  were  administered  with 
help  from  an  ICM.  The  Children’s  Revised  Impact  of 
Event  Scale-13  (CRIES-13)  is  available  in  several  lan-
guages  (www. child renan dwar. org).  The  Patient  Health 
Questionnaire-9,  modified  for  adolescents  (PHQ-A)  is 
available  in  English.  When  a  minor  spoke  another  lan-
guage,  the  questionnaires  were  translated  into  this  lan-
guage by an ICM.

Demographic information

The  following  demographic  information  was  collected: 
gender,  age,  country  of  origin,  whether  the  minor  came 
from a city or town, and whether the minor had any fam-
ily members in the Netherlands.

Request for help

To  map  how  URMs  define  their  main  problem  and 
request  for  help,  minors  were  asked  to  formulate  their 
main problem.

Life events

During  the  second  treatment  session,  therapists  iden-
tified  positive  life  events,  adverse  life  events,  and  losses 
of loved ones the minors had been exposed to. They did 
so by laying down a lifeline, as is described in the Narra-
tive  Exposure  Therapy  for  the  treatment  of  traumatized 
children  and  adolescents’  protocol  (KIDNET;  described 
in more detail in the ‘Treatment and Therapist’ section). 
Minors were asked for their permission to share informa-
tion  concerning  their  treatment  sessions,  including  the 
lifeline, with the researchers.

Programme integrity

To assess whether the treatment approach was performed 
as  intended,  two  components  of  programme  integrity, 
based  on  the  conceptual  framework  of  Carroll  et  al. 
[21]  were  assessed:  exposure  and  adherence.  Exposure 
was operationalized as the number of sessions per client 
and minutes per session. Adherence was operationalized 
as the extent to which therapists adhered to the specific 
components  of  the  approach.  The  programme  integrity 
list was completed by the therapist after each session. In 
addition, the programme integrity list included questions 
on  the  duration  of  the  treatment  approach,  how  thera-
pists evaluated the collaboration with the ICM, the main 
theme  of  each  session,  whether  a  module  protocol  was 
used, whether the therapist deviated from the treatment

approach,  and  why  they  deviated  from  the  treatment 
approach.

Feasibility

After  finishing  all  sessions,  the  therapists  and  ICMs 
involved in the study were asked to evaluate the multi-
modal trauma-focused treatment approach by filling in 
an  online  questionnaire.  The  questionnaire  was  based 
on  a  brainstorming  session  in  which  the  researchers 
discussed  the  evaluation  aims.  It  consisted  of  mostly 
open-ended  questions  focusing  on  positive  aspects  of 
the  intervention  and  elements  that  could  be  improved 
or  changed.  Therapists  and  ICMs  were  also  asked  to 
arrange  aspects  of  the  approach  according  to  their 
importance, based on their experience.

Symptoms of posttraumatic stress

All  minors  completed  the  CRIES-13,  a  13-item  tool 
measuring  symptoms  of  posttraumatic  stress  in  chil-
dren  aged  8  and  older.  The  scale  includes  three  sub-
scales:  intrusion,  avoidance,  and  arousal.  Items  are 
rated on a 4-point scale rating 0 = not at all, 1 = rarely, 
3 = sometimes,  and  5 = often.  A  total  score  of ≥ 30  sug-
gests  an  increased  risk  of  PTSD  [22]. The  CRIES-13  is 
a  valid  measure  of  posttraumatic  stress  that  has  been 
used  extensively  among  children  exposed  to  war  and 
with different cultural backgrounds [22, 23]. The Cron-
bach’s alpha in this study was good (0.81).

Symptoms of depression

To  measure  symptoms  of  depression,  the  PHQ-A  [24] 
was  used.  The  PHQ-A  is  a  modified  version  of  the 
PHQ-9.  For  example,  ‘reading  the  newspaper’  in  the 
PHQ-9  questionnaire  was  changed  to  ‘schoolwork  and 
reading’ in the PHQ-A. The PHQ-A includes nine items 
rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) with a 
time  period  of  the  past  7  days.  In  line  with  the  PHQ-
9,  a  total  score  of ≥ 10  was  considered  as  the  cut-off 
score  for  detecting  depression  [25].  Despite  a  few  dif-
ferences, the measure is mostly consistent with DSM-5 
criteria  for  a  major  depressive  disorder.  The  PHQ-9 
is  a  validated,  frequently  used  instrument  measuring 
depression in adolescents [26]. The last question of the 
PHQ-A  is  on  self-harm  and  suicidality.  All  therapists 
were  licensed  and  trained  to  explore  suicidality,  and 
suicidality  was  also  included  in  the  training  for  ICMs. 
If  a  minor  was  suicidal,  it  was  explained  to  the  URM 
that their guardian and/or mentor would be informed. 
If  needed,  a  child  and  youth  psychiatrist  could  be 
consulted.  Although  the  reliability  and  validity  of  the 
PHQ-A for refugee minors from different backgrounds 

have,  to  our  knowledge,  not  yet  been  established,  the 
PHQ-A  has  been  shown  to  have  acceptable  psycho-
metric  properties  when  completed  by  Arabic-speaking 
adolescent  refugees  [27].  The  Cronbach’s  alpha  in  this 
study was acceptable (0.79).

Treatment and therapists

Before  starting  the  present  study,  we  performed  a  non-
systemic  evaluation  of  the  multimodal  trauma-focused 
treatment  approach  [28].  After  offering  the  treatment 
to  33  Eritrean  URMs,  the  therapists  and  researchers 
reviewed the approach. They noted that it focused mainly 
on  traumatic  events  in  the  past,  however,  they  empha-
sized  the  importance  of  tailoring  the  treatment  to  meet 
the  minor’s  individual  needs,  for  example  by  focusing 
more  on  current,  ongoing  stressors.  The  approach  was 
therefore  adapted  to  allow  for  more  flexibility.  Moreo-
ver, the importance of involving the direct context of the 
URM (e.g., guardian and mentor) was emphasized by the 
involved professionals.

The  procedure  is  presented  in  Fig.  1.  URMs  were 
offered  the  multimodal,  culturally  sensitive,  trauma-
focused  treatment  approach.  The  approach  started  with 
a  clinical  intake  interview.  During  the  intake,  confiden-
tiality  and  mutual  expectations  were  discussed.  Dur-
ing  the  following  session,  psychoeducation  about  PTSD 
symptoms  and  trauma-focused  treatment  were  offered. 
As URMs are often unfamiliar with such treatments, and 
differences  in  explanatory  models  between  the  therapist 
and the minors might exist, considerable time was spent 
on  psychoeducation.  For  example,  therapists  normal-
ized  symptoms  by  explaining  how  complaints  might  be 
linked to traumatic experiences in the past and continu-
ous  stressors.  Additionally,  the  treatment  rationale  and 
potential  side  effects  of  the  treatment  approach  were 
explained.  Finally,  the  minors’  lifeline  (as  derived  from 
KIDNET)  was  laid  out,  either  by  drawing  or  by  laying 
down a rope and placing flowers for their positive experi-
ences  and  stones  for  their  negative  experiences.  Next,  it 
was decided which intervention module suited the minor 
best. This was done during multidisciplinary consultation 
based on the request for help and complaints as reported 
by the minor. Each session lasted approximately 90 min. 
The  final  session  focused  on  leave-taking.  If  more  help 
was needed, the therapist discussed with the minor and 
the guardian what was needed and, if necessary and suit-
able,  the  therapist  provided  this.  If  therapists  were  not 
able  to  offer  this  support,  they  assisted  the  URM  and 
their  guardian  to  find  suitable  help.  For  example,  thera-
pists helped finding suitable mental health care nearby.

The  treatment  approach  included  different  modules, 
including  CBT  interventions  and  elements  of  KIDNET 
(the  lifeline)  and  Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and

Reprocessing  (EMDR),  to  address  continuous  stress-
ors, and symptoms of depression and (traumatic) stress. 
Culturally sensitive adaptations of the modules included 
collaborating with ICMs before and during the sessions. 
Before  the  sessions,  how  to  offer  psychoeducation  in  a 
culturally  sensitive  way  was  discussed,  for  example  by 
using  suitable  metaphors.  The  core  components  of  the 
treatment modules were not adapted.

NET  The lifeline was construed based on KIDNET [29] 
and served as a way to identify key adverse life events, pos-

itive  life  events,  and  losses  of  loved  ones.  Moreover,  the 
lifeline provided insight into the link between complaints 
and  traumatic  events  (a  case  conceptualization).  NET  is 
conditionally recommended by the American Psychologi-
cal Association (APA) for the treatment of PTSD [30].

EMDR  URMs  who  had  developed  traumatic  stress 
reactions as a result of a clearly defined traumatic inci-
dent  received  EMDR  to  address  these  issues.  EMDR 
is  a  frequently  used  psychotherapeutic  treatment 
[31]  focused  on  weakening  negative  and  strengthen-

 van Es et al. Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health           (2021) 15:53

ing  positive  cognitions  associated  with  the  traumatic 
event. A key element of EMDR is a dual attention task. 
Whilst the client focuses on an image of the traumatic 
memory,  bilateral,  rhythmic  stimulation,  for  example 
evoking  saccadic  eye  movements,  is  offered  [32].  Oras 
et al. [33] suggested that EMDR is an effective treatment 
for  traumatized  refugee  children  and  the  guidelines  of 
the  National  Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence 
(NICE) cited EMDR as a promising treatment for chil-
dren  and  adolescents  [34,  35].  After  discussions  with 
ICMs,  therapists,  professionals  with  experience  work-
ing  in  Eritrea,  and  EMDR  experts,  it  was  decided  to 
offer EMDR, because during EMDR minors do not have 
to verbalize all of their traumatic experiences, which is 
more often the case in other trauma-focused treatments, 
such as KIDNET. URMs might be unfamiliar with talk-
ing about their experiences and therefore might be hesi-
tant to do so.

CBT  NICE  recommends  CBT  for  the  treatment  for 
depression  [36].  During  the  intervention,  CBT  was 
offered, for example, by supporting URMs in increasing 
activities and improving social connections [37].

Therapists

The  trauma-focused  treatment  approach  was  per-
formed  by  therapists  working  at  various  mental  health 
care  institutions  throughout  the  Netherlands.  Thera-
pists  were  recruited  based  on  the  network  of  the  pro-
ject team involved in designing the treatment approach. 
Therapists were all licensed mental health care workers 
and  trained  EMDR-therapists  with  multiple  years  of 
experience  with  minors  from  different  cultural  back-
grounds.  Therapists  took  part  in  multidisciplinary 
consultation  as  part  of  their  regular  work,  as  well  as 
multidisciplinary  consultation  and  supervision  as  part 
of  the  multimodal  treatment  approach.  The  motiva-
tion for therapists to take part in offering the treatment 
approach  included  the  collaboration  with  ICMs,  being 
part  of  a  network  of  experienced  psychologists,  and 
working together to increase the understanding of what 
works for URMs in the Netherlands.

ICMs

ICMs were persons close to the URMs in cultural back-
ground  and  experience,  who  aimed  to  facilitate  com-
munication  between  the  therapist  and  the  minor.  They 
interpreted  language  and  offered  information  on  the 
cultural  background  of  the  URMs.  All  ICMs  followed  a 
training  focused  on  trauma,  stress,  and  selfcare  before 
providing  the  approach  and  were  given  the  opportunity 
to participate in intermediate supervision sessions.

Analysis
Main request for help

After an initial assessment of the main requests for help 
of  the  minors  their  requests  were  categorized  into  psy-
chological problems, psychosocial problems, and somatic 
problems. All requests for help were related to these cate-
gories. In addition, a previous study indicated that URMs 
in  the  Netherlands  often  report  psychosocial  stressors 
and  psychological  complaints  [11].  Moreover,  refugees 
often present somatic symptoms [38].

Treatment integrity and feasibility

To  evaluate  programme  integrity,  exposure,  and  adher-
ence  were  computed.  Missing  items  were  allowed  on 
the  programme  integrity  list.  When  percentages  are 
reported, they apply to all questions that have been com-
pleted.  Adverse  events  were  categorized  following  the 
subsequent  categories,  in  line  with  the  World  Health 
Organization World Mental Health Surveys [39]: [1] nat-
ural and man-made disasters and accidents; [20] combat, 
war, and refugee experiences; [6] sexual and interpersonal 
violence; [7] witnessing or perpetrating violence; and [8] 
death of a loved one. Being captured or held against one’s 
will was added as a category as more than 25% of minors 
reported experiencing this adverse event.

Data  from  the  online  questionnaires  were  analysed 
using the general inductive approach for analysing quali-
tative evaluation data [40] in the following steps. All steps 
were conducted in parallel (CvE and MeV). First, the text 
was  read  thoroughly.  Second,  specific  text  fragments 
related  to  the  research  questions  were  identified  and 
labelled  to  create  categories.  Third,  overlap  and  redun-
dancy were reduced. Finally, the most important catego-
ries were identified. The categories were discussed among 
the two raters until a consensus was reached. During this 
process, an ongoing discussion was maintained with the 
rest of the research team.

Course of symptoms

Data  of  the  pre-  and  post-treatment  assessments  of  the 
CRIES-13 and PHQ-A were analysed using SPSS (version 
27, IBM Statistics). For the CRIES-13, in line with Verlin-
den et al. [41], data were counted as missing if more than 
one  item  on  a  subscale  was  missing.  For  the  PHQ-A,  in 
line  with  prior  studies  on  the  PHQ-9  [42],  data  were 
counted as missing if more than two items were missing. 
Missing values on the PHQ-A were replaced by the mean 
of  the  completed  items  of  the  PHQ-A,  as  suggested  by 
Kocalevent et al. [43] and missing items on the CRIES-13 
were replaced by the mean of the completed items of the 
same subscale. A Chi-square test and independent t-test 
were  conducted  to  evaluate  whether  any  differences 
related  to  demographic  information  and  baseline  scores

on  the  CRIES-13  and  PHQ-A  existed  between  partici-
pants who completed the questionnaires and participants 
who did not. To assess whether any changes occurred in 
symptoms  of  depression  and  PTSD,  paired  t-tests  and 
Wilcoxon-signed rank tests were conducted. To evaluate 
clinical significance of change, we calculated the Reliable 
Change Index (RCI) for changes in symptoms of depres-
t3−t1
sion and PTSD, using the formula 
Sdiﬀ  [44], with  t3 refer-
ring  to  post-treatment  assessments  of  the  PHQ-A  and 
CRIES-13,   t1  referring  to  pre-treatment  assessments  of 
the  PHQ-A  and  CRIES-13,  and   Sdiff  being  calculated 
using  the  test–retest  reliability  coefficient  of  the  ques-
tionnaires  and  the  standard  deviation  of  the  pre-treat-
ment scores. The test–retest coefficient of the CRIES-13 
is 0.85 [45]. Kroenke et al. [46] found that the test–retest 
reliability of the PHQ-9 was 0.84. A calculated RCI larger 
than  |1.96|  indicated  a  clinically  reliable  change,  with 
95%  certainty.  The  RCI  resulted  in  numbers  of  minors 
improved,  unchanged,  and  worsened  from   t1  to   t3.  In 
addition to the RCI, clinically significant change was fur-
ther evaluating by assessing whether clients had obtained 

a score of < 30 on the CRIES-13, and a score of < 10 on the 
PHQ-A after the treatment approach.

Results
In  total,  61  minors  were  referred  to  the  treatment 
approach.  Fifteen  did  not  start  with  the  approach  for  a 
variety  of  reasons,  including:  not  being  able  to  contact 
the  guardian  and/or  minor  (n = 3),  not  being  motivated 
for  treatment  (n = 3),  no  longer  having  a  request  for 
help because family reunification took place (n = 2), and 
starting  treatment  at  another  facility  whilst  placed  on 
the waitlist (n = 2). In addition, four minors did not give 
consent to taking part in the study. Ultimately, 41 minors 
participated in the study. Three participants dropped out 
immediately after intake, for the following reasons: mov-
ing  house,  needing  another  form  of  support  because  of 
current threat of deportation, and placement in a secure 
psychiatric  facility.  A  flowchart  is  provided  in  Fig.  2.

but  one  of  the  ICMs  (n = 8)  completed  the  online  ques-
tionnaires. The ICM who did not complete the question-
naire was contacted several times but did not reply to the 
requests of the researchers.

Request for help

Most  participants  (95.1%)  reported  psychological  prob-
lems,  such  as  difficulties  sleeping  and  concentrating, 
flashbacks,  and  feelings  of  depression.  Moreover,  psy-
chosocial  problems,  such  as  worries  concerning  family 
members  and  problems  with  housing,  were  reported  by 
27  participants  (65.9%).  Finally,  six  participants  (14.6%) 
stated that they experienced somatic complaints, such as 
headaches and incontinence.

Programme integrity

The  data  of  minors  who  attended  at  least  one  session 
after intake were included in analyses based on the pro-
gramme  integrity  list  (n = 38).  Participants  were  offered 
8 sessions on average (range 4–17), which lasted approxi-
mately  80  min.  Three  minors  dropped  out  after  2  or  3 
sessions  for  the  following  reasons:  wanting  to  focus  on 
their future and preparing for their asylum interview, not 
being  able  to  find  motivation  for  treatment,  and  expe-
riencing  too  much  stress  after  receiving  negative  news 
concerning their asylum status.

Therapists  collaborated  with  ICMs  during  93%  of 
the  sessions.  The  main  reasons  for  collaboration  with 
ICMs  reported  by  the  therapists  included  ICMs  bridg-
ing  the  cultural  and/or  language  gap  (53.7%),  that  col-
laboration with ICMs is part of the protocol (16.6%), and 
ICMs  helping  in  creating  a  connection  with  the  minors 
(13.2%). Therapists  sometimes  worked  with  professional 

interpreters  (3.3%),  or  without  an  ICM  or  interpreter 
(3.7%), mostly when the ICM was not able to join a ses-
sion due to practical reasons. During the majority of the 
sessions,  therapists  rated  their  collaboration  with  ICMs 
positively  (96.4%),  stating  for  example  that  they  ‘under-
stand the culture’, and that they promote the building of 
a trusting relationship. In a few cases therapists said the 
collaboration could be improved—this was mostly when 
the  ICM  joined  the  session  online  or  via  telephone  as  a 
result of restrictions due to COVID-19.

The sessions focused primarily on continuous stressors 
(27.1%),  trauma  (21.9%),  laying  the  lifeline  (20.8%),  get-
ting to know each other (11.5%), saying goodbye (8.7%), 
and psychoeducation (7.3%). During 56% of the sessions, 
therapists followed a treatment module protocol. In these 
sessions, therapists primarily offered EMDR (47.2% of the 
sessions)  and  the  lifeline  derived  from  KIDNET  (40.3% 
of  the  sessions).  In  other  sessions  where  a  protocol  of  a 
treatment  module  was  followed,  therapists  used  CBT 
(11.9%  of  the  sessions  following  a  protocol),  or  specific 
protocols, for example focused on stabilization or dealing 
with anger.

Therapists  documented  several  deviations  from  the 
treatment  approach.  For  example,  they  deviated  to 
address  the  current  needs  of  the  minor,  which  often 
concerned  dealing  with  continuous  stressors  (e.g.  wor-
ries about family members, problems concerning school 
and  housing),  and  news  the  minors  had  received  (e.g. 
concerning  asylum  status,  family  reunification,  death  of 
a loved one). Moreover, therapists noted that they some-
times  needed  to  take  extra  time  for  psychoeducation, 
explaining  EMDR,  building  trust,  laying  down  the  life-
line  and  translation.  The  circumstances  due  to  COVID-
19  resulted  in  several  deviations  from  the  approach  for 
approximately  a  third  of  the  minors.  For  example,  two 
of  the  minors  received  all  sessions  online/over  the  tele-
phone. In addition, several minors were contacted online 
or  via  telephone  by  their  therapist  between  sessions  for 
continuity. These sessions resulted in several challenges, 
including  arranging  devices,  a  secure  internet  connec-
tion,  and  adequate  space  for  the  minors.  Furthermore, 
the  focus  of  these  sessions  sometimes  shifted  to  dealing 
with social isolation and restrictions. Therapists reported 
they took time to involve the direct context of the minors, 
for  example  by  having  a  guardian  or  mentor  attend  the 
intake interview, and by talking to a guardian or mentor 
concerning the minors’ continuous stressors. In addition, 
therapists  sometimes  deviated  from  the  EMDR  proto-
col  because  minors  reported  they  did  not  want  to  con-
tinue, for example because their arousal was too high or 
because they had an extreme headache.

Therapists  described  many  differences  between  the 
participating minors. For example, whereas some minors 

van Es et al. Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health           (2021) 15:53 

Page 9 of 14

were  very  motivated  and  wanted  to  talk  about  their 
experiences, others had difficulties developing a trusting 
relationship.  One  minor  stated  he  did  not  want  to  con-
tinue with EMDR as it reminded him of magic. In some 
cases,  treatment  was  mostly  focused  on  motivating  the 
minor  to  receive  mental  health  care.  Treatment  termi-
nation took place for different reasons. Most minors felt 
the treatment had helped them overcome their problems 
(75.1%),  some  minors  were  referred  to  another  mental 
health  facility  (11.4%),  and  others  wanted  to  focus  on 
their future/current worries rather than therapy (8.6%).

Evaluation by therapists

The  therapists’  experience  with  offering  the  treatment 
approach  varied  widely.  For  example,  three  therapists 
had treated one minor, and two others had seen approxi-
mately 20 minors. All therapists found the approach use-
ful and wanted to  continue offering  it.  According to the 
therapists the most important elements of the approach 
included outreach work, working on a mutual established 
goal,  and  working  with  an  ICM  with  a  similar  cultural 
background  to  the  minor.  They  also  valued  the  flexibil-
ity of the approach and being able to deviate to suit the 
needs  of  the  minor.  Some  therapists  experienced  dif-
ficulties  whilst  explaining  EMDR  to  the  minors,  and 
some thought that EMDR did not always suit the minors’ 
needs. Several stated that the protocol could be improved 
by  some  adaptations,  for  example  by  allowing  for  more 
flexibility,  and  by  adding  more  psychoeducation,  CBT 
exercises relaxation exercises, and homework exercises to 
the  protocol.  Finally,  they  underlined  the  importance  of 
local  professionals  throughout  the  Netherlands  offering 
the approach, and of sharing knowledge and expertise.

Therapist: ‘We reach minors that wouldn’t normally be 
reached. We try to adapt to fit to the needs of the minor, 
instead  of  the  minor  adapting  to  the  mental  health  care 
institution.’

Evaluation by ICMs

Eight ICMs took part in the evaluation. Their experience 
with  the  approach  varied  from  one  treatment  to  more 
than ten treatments. The majority of ICMs were involved 
in  more  than  four  treatments.  Seven  ICMs  found  the 
approach useful and all ICMs wanted to continue to offer 
the  approach.  The  ICM  who  did  not  find  the  approach 
useful stated that more time should be invested in getting 
to know each other, and that the therapists as well as the 
ICM should share more personal stories with the minors. 
ICMs  especially  valued  that  the  treatment  approach 
could  be  adapted  to  fit  the  minors’  needs  better.  ICMs 
rated  the  KIDNET  lifeline,  the  outreach  work,  and  the 
engaged approach by the therapist and ICMs as the most 
important  elements  of  the  approach.  Most  ICMs  felt 

their  work  was  an  important  addition  to  the  approach. 
For example, one ICM explained that ICMs can assist in 
formulating  certain  questions.  Some  ICMs  added  that 
the approach could be improved by offering more psych-
oeducation, and spending time on building trust. Several 
ICMs  stated  their  work  could  be  improved  by  receiv-
ing more training focused on their role in the treatment 
approach, and some ICMs stated that the communication 
between  therapist  and  ICM  could  be  improved.  Finally, 
the  ICMs  highlighted  the  importance  of  involving  the 
patient’s context and added that this could be improved.

ICM: ‘Before the therapy begins, the ICM and therapist 
should  spend  more  time  with  the  minor.  Otherwise,  you 
can’t build trust. My experience is that when more time is 
invested in the beginning, the outcomes are better’

Course of symptoms

Most  participants  did  not  complete  the  questionnaires. 
Twelve  participants  completed  the  Pre-  and  post-meas-
urements  of  the  PHQ-A,  and  17  completed  the  pre- 
and  post-measurements  of  the  CRIES-13.  Obstacles  in 
obtaining  complete  measurements  included  drop-out; 
limited time to conduct the assessments; restrictions due 
to COVID-19 (in some cases, therapists and ICMs were 
not able to explain the questionnaires online or over the 
telephone);  a  lack  of  motivation  to  fill  in  the  question-
naires; and difficulties with understanding the questions. 
Another  reason  for  non-completion  was  that  therapists 
were  afraid  to  burden  the  minors  by  asking  questions 
about their mental health.

Based on an independent t-test and a Chi-square test, 
we  found  no  differences  in  demographic  information 
(age, gender, country of origin, whether they came from 
a  town  or  city)  or  baseline  scores  on  the  PHQ-A  and 
CRIES-13 between minors who completed the question-
naires  and  minors  who  did  not  complete  the  question-
naires.  Most  participants  who  filled  in  the  CRIES-13 
pre-treatment  (24  out  of  the  29,  82.8%)  had  developed 
heightened  symptoms  of  PTSD,  and  approximately  half 
(12 out of 21, 57.1%) reported moderate to severe symp-
toms  of  depression.  A  paired  t-test  was  conducted  to 
compare pre-and post-intervention scores on the CRIES-
13  and  PHQ-A  (see  Table  2).  A  statistically  significant 
reduction  in  PTSD  scores  was  found. There  was  no  sig-
nificant  change  in  depression  scores.  To  ensure  robust-
ness,  Wilcoxon  signed-ranks  tests  were  also  conducted, 
yielding a significant difference for the CRIES-13, but not 
for the PHQ-A (see Table 2).

Table  3  shows  the  CRIES-13  and  PHQ-A  scores  at 
 t1  and   t3,  and  the  RCI  scores  for  participants  who  com-
pleted  pre-  and  post-treatment  measurements.  As 
indicated by the RCI, 10 of the 17 participants who com-
pleted  the  CRIES-13  improved  (59%),  seven  remained

after treatment. Concerning the PHQ-A, three of the 12 
participants improved (25%), eight remained unchanged 
(67%),  and  one  worsened  (8%).  Two  participants  who

whereas  two  participants  who  scored  below  the  cut-off

Discussion
The  aim  of  the  current  study  was  to  provide  an  evalua-
tion of a multimodal trauma-focused treatment approach 
offered  to  URMs  in  the  Netherlands.  Forty-one  URMs, 
mostly from Eritrea and Syria, started with the interven-
tion. These minors arrived in the Netherlands after a har-
rowing journey, often being exposed to atrocities, hunger, 
thirst,  and  losing  loved  ones  including  companions  and 
friends. Minors reported they would like to receive help 

to alleviate psychological issues, such as difficulties sleep-
ing. Moreover, most minors reported psychosocial prob-
lems, including worries about their family members and 
their  asylum  status.  A  few  minors  stated  they  wanted 
help with somatic issues. Somatization in refugees is con-
nected with psychopathology and can be perceived as an 
idiom  of  distress  [38].  Moreover,  some  minors  experi-
enced physical abuse and neglect and might have experi-
enced somatic issues as a result. In addition, most minors 
had  developed  heightened  symptoms  of  PTSD,  and 
approximately  half  reported  moderate  to  severe  symp-
toms of depression.

Minors  attended  approximately  eight  sessions  of  the 
trauma-focused  treatment  approach.  Concerning  pro-
gramme  integrity,  therapists  often  deviated  from  the 
approach.  ICMs  and  therapists  elaborated  that  they 
often  needed  more  time  to  offer  psychoeducation. 
Moreover,  therapists  and  ICMs  emphasized  the  need 
to  adapt  the  focus  of  the  session  to  meet  the  current 

van Es et al. Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health           (2021) 15:53 

Page 11 of 14

need  of  the  minors.  In  addition  to  a  focus  on  trauma, 
continuous  stressors  often  played  a  prominent  role  in 
the treatment approach. The treatment approach often 
consisted  of  a  combination  of  modules,  including  the 
lifeline (as derived from KIDNET), sessions focused on 
trauma, and sessions focusing on continuous stressors.

The  feasibility  of  the  pre-  and  post-measurements 
of  PTSD  and  depression  was  low.  The  majority  of  the 
minors  did  not  complete  the  questionnaires,  and  as 
a  result,  these  findings  are  not  representative  of  the 
entire  sample.  Most  minors  who  did  complete  the 
measurements  reported  a  decrease  in  symptoms  of 
PTSD.  No  significant  change  in  symptoms  of  depres-
sion  was  found.  An  important  reason  for  non-com-
pletion  was  that  therapists  were  afraid  to  burden  the 
minors  by  asking  questions  about  their  mental  health. 
It  is  possible  the  minors  who  were  experiencing  men-
tal  health  issues  were  spared  by  not  conducting  the 
questionnaires. This finding emphasizes the need of an 
(independent) assessor other than the therapist to con-
duct the questionnaires.

The results suggest that the trauma-focused treatment 
approach is partly feasible and indicates that certain bar-
riers  to  mental  health  care  can  be  overcome  by  offering 
this  short-term,  outreach  approach.  For  example,  sev-
eral  minors  who  experienced  barriers  to  regular  men-
tal  health  care,  where  motivated  for  referral  to  another 
mental  health  facility  after  getting  offered  the  treat-
ment approach. The professionals involved in the execu-
tion  of  the  treatment  approach  evaluated  it  positively, 
and all of them said they wanted to continue to offer it. 
Moreover, the drop-out (15% dropped out after 1–3 ses-
sions) was similar to drop-out in other studies research-
ing trauma-focused treatments [47]. Drop-out was often 
due to circumstances linked to the minors’ asylum status, 
and  needing  more  help  than  this  short-term  treatment 
approach can offer.

There  were  several  limitations  to  the  feasibility  of  the 
treatment  approach,  including  low  treatment  adherence 
and  challenges  faced  during  implementation  of  the  pro-
tocol. Notably, factors limiting programme integrity and 
feasibility  were  frequently  related  to  structural  barriers. 
For example, deviations, reasons for drop-out, and miss-
ing data, were often due to factors such as news concern-
ing asylum status, moving house, and restrictions due to 
COVID-19.  When  evaluating  a  treatment  approach  in 
the context of trauma and resettlement, structural barri-
ers  often  arise.  Although  these  barriers  are  out  of  reach 
for the minors and therapists, it is important to take these 
barriers  into  account  while  planning  the  evaluation  and 
organizing  funding.  For  example,  it  could  be  helpful  to 
adopt a flexible approach to deal with the ever-changing 
context of these young refugees, and to support URMs in 

developing  coping  strategies  to  deal  with  these  continu-
ous, structural stressors.

Strengths and limitations

The current study is one of the first to evaluate a trauma-
focused  treatment  approach  specifically  for  URMs  [12, 
13].  Although  there  are  several  limitations  due  to  the 
design  of  the  study,  this  study  offers  an  overview  of  a 
treatment  approach  that  can  be  offered  to  this  under-
studied  population  in  a  naturalistic  setting.  Conducting 
this culturally-sensitive outreach approach, we were able 
to reach a group subject to barriers to mental health care 
who often do not receive adequate care. Another strength 
of the current study is that different perspectives are pre-
sented, including the perspectives of the therapists, ICMs 
and URMs.

A  factor  that  might  have  contributed  to  the  feasibil-
ity of the trauma-focused intervention was the flexibility 
of  the  treatment  approach.  During  a  previous  evalua-
tion [11], professionals noted the importance of offering 
a  flexible  approach.  This  study  offered  insight  into  the 
wide  range  of  requests  for  help  reported  by  the  partici-
pating URMs. Treatment sessions were often tailored to 
meet  the  needs  of  the  minors,  which  is  reflected  in  the 
main  themes  of  the  sessions  as  well  as  in  the  deviations 
reported  by  the  therapists.  A  multimodal  approach  was 
conducted,  offering  modules  of  KIDNET,  EMDR,  and 
CBT, all of which are promising or recommended treat-
ments for PTSD and depression. Multimodal treatments 
have been offered successfully to children suffering from 
psychological  problems, 
including  depression,  anxi-
ety, and trauma [48, 49]. Although the flexible approach 
was valued as a strength by both therapists and ICMs, it 
complicates drawing conclusions on what aspects of the 
approach contributed to its impact.

Several limitations deserve attention. First, the data col-
lection of the questionnaires in this study relied solely on 
therapists, as there was insufficient funding for research-
ers to conduct the measurements. Because many sessions 
did not contain the planned treatment, it is not possible 
to draw any inferences about the impact of the presented 
treatment  approach.  Second,  therapists  were  recruited 
based on their training level and experience with minors 
with  different  cultural  backgrounds.  It  is  plausible  that 
this  resulted  in  the  selection  of  highly  motivated  thera-
pists,  and  therapists  with  less  experience  and  affinity 
with this population might have evaluated the approach 
less positively. Third, the CRIES-13 was used in the cur-
rent study to measure symptoms of PTSD, however, this 
questionnaire  is  based  on  the  Diagnostic  and  Statisti-
cal  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders-IV  (DSM-IV).  Future 
studies  should  include  a  more  up-to-date  questionnaire 
in  line  with  the  current  DSM-5  or  the  International

Classification  of  Diseases  11th  Revision  (ICD-11),  such 
as the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) [50]. 
Fourth,  URMs  form  a  heterogeneous  group  with  a  wide 
range of cultural backgrounds, experiences, and requests 
for  help.  The  generalizability  of  the  findings  is  limited, 
as the current study only focused on a small sample size 
with  participants  from  three  different  countries.  As  a 
prior  evaluation  of  this  approach  focused  solely  on  Eri-
trean  minors,  guardians  often  referred  Eritrean  minors. 
The  current  design  did  not  allow  for  comparison  of  the 
treatment’s impact for different cultural groups.

Research implications

The current study aimed to explore the feasibility of the 
multimodal  trauma-focused  treatment  approach.  Future 
efforts  should  focus  on  examining  the  effectiveness  of 
this  treatment  approach.  Demazure  et  al.  [12]  state  that 
there are many challenges to conducting double-blinded 
RCTs  of  the  impact  of  interventions  for  URMs.  How-
ever,  the  authors  suggest  that  small-N  designs  could  be 
a viable alternative to evaluate intervention effectiveness. 
In  addition  to  a  quantitative  evaluation,  future  research 
can adopt a mixed-methods approach by including quali-
tative  data,  such  as  interviews  with  URMs  who  have 
received treatment, in order to hear the voices and expe-
riences of the URMs themselves.

Clinical implications

The  collaboration  between  psychologists  and  ICMs 
emerged  as  one  of  the  strengths  of  the  treatment 
approach.  The  involvement  of  ICMs  went  beyond  the 
translation of language. ICMs can aid in providing a cul-
turally  sensitive  explanation  of  the  treatment  rationale, 
in  bridging  the  cultural  gap,  in  building  a  trusting  rela-
tionship,  and  in  motivating  minors.  Nierkens  et  al.  [51] 
emphasize that the quality and accessibility of health care 
can  benefit  from  collaborating  with  ICMs.  In  line  with 
the evaluation by ICMs, Qureshi et al. [52] note that the 
role of ICMs can be improved by offering clarity regard-
ing  their  role.  To  contribute  to  the  professionalization 
of  ICMs,  it  is  essential  to  continue  to  offer  supervision, 
guidance and training.

The  current  study  offers  several  clinical  implications 
for the multimodal trauma-focused treatment approach. 
Modifications  include  providing  specific  approaches  to 
address  continuous  stressors,  and  offering  more  atten-
tion to psychoeducation, as an important deviation from 
the  approach  was  that  therapists  often  spent  more  time 
on  continuous  stressors  and  psychoeducation.  Continu-
ous  stressors  related  to  resettlement  can  play  a  crucial 
role  in  the  development  of  mental  health  problems  in 
refugees.  A  recent  pilot  study  emphasized  that  current 
stressors,  including  the  rejection  of  the  asylum  claim, 

can  potentially  increase  symptoms  of  PTSD  in  URMs 
post-treatment.  Bruhn  et  al.  [53]  state  that  identifying 
and  dealing  with  postmigration  stressors  might  limit 
the  impact  of  these  stressors  on  treatment.  Although 
addressing  these  problems  can  be  very  complex  and  at 
times impossible (e.g. when they are related to local leg-
islation),  interventions  can  focus  on  dealing  with  these 
problems,  for  example  by  strengthening  the  social  net-
work,  and  by  improving  coping  strategies.  The  protocol 
could  therefore  benefit  from  providing  specific  (CBT) 
approaches  to  deal  with  continuous  stressors.  In  addi-
tion, both therapists and ICMs noted they often needed 
more time for psychoeducation, which psychoeducation 
is suggested to have a positive impact on PTSD and psy-
chosocial factors, such as social support  [54]. The treat-
ment  approach  protocol  can  be  further  improved  by 
offering more attention to psychoeducation.

One of the major future challenges is implementing the 
presented  treatment  approach  in  a  sustainable  way.  The 
current design requires many resources, including highly 
trained and experienced ICMs and therapists. Therapists 
conducting the treatment approach have to be trained to 
offer KIDNET, EMDR and CBT. However, it is not always 
feasible  to  secure  these  resources.  One  solution  might 
be  to  put  effort  into  training  and  motivating  therapists 
who are less experienced. Motivation for participation in 
offering this treatment approach might be the collabora-
tion with ICMs and working together with a network of 
experienced therapists to find out what works for URMs. 
To  assure  quality  of  the  treatment,  continued  super-
vision  and  multidisciplinary  consultation  needs  to  be 
offered. Another option is to invest in alternative models. 
For  example,  the  World  Health  Organization  developed 
Problem  Management  Plus  (PM +),  a  brief  intervention 
targeting  common  mental  health  problems,  based  on 
CBT and problem solving strategies [55]. A recent study 
found that PM + is acceptable, feasible, safe, and may be 
effective  in  improving  mental  health  and  psychosocial 
functioning  in  refugees.  In  addition,  PM + can  be  deliv-
ered by non-specialist refugee helpers [56]. Furthermore, 
two RCTs are currently assessing the effect of a stepped 
care approach addressing PTSD in URMs [57, 58]. Using 
a  stepped  care  model  lay  counsellors  or  ICMs  could 
be  trained  to  offer  psychoeducation  and  the  lifeline  as 
derived from KIDNET.

The  presented  treatment  approach  seems  to  be  indi-
cated when URMs and their guardians experience barri-
ers to regular mental health care. The outreach care and 
collaboration with ICMs aids in overcoming these barri-
ers. However, it remains unclear whether the content of 
the treatment approach—including the lifeline as derived 
from  KIDNET,  EMDR,  and  CBT—is  more  suitable  than 
other  treatment  approaches,  such  as  TF-CBT.  Future 

van Es et al. Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health           (2021) 15:53

research efforts should focus on what treatment (module) 
is indicated for which minor. The aforementioned studies 
focusing on a stepped care model can further inform us 
on what works.

Conclusion

This  study  offers  a  first  evaluation  of  the  feasibility  of  a 
multimodal trauma-focused treatment approach specifi-
cally  for  URMs  in  the  Netherlands,  taking  into  account 
their  specific  needs;  the  context;  pre-  and  postmigra-
tion  stressors;  and  language  and  cultural  differences. 
The  results  are  promising  and  provide  a  first  indication 
that  this  approach  mostly  overcomes  barriers  to  mental 
health care, and that the treatment is partly feasible.
