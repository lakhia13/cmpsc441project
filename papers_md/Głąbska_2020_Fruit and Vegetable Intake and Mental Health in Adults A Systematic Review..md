Abstract: The role of a properly balanced diet in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders
has been suggested, while vegetables and fruits have a high content of nutrients that may be of
importance in the case of depressive disorders. The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic
review of the observational studies analyzing association between fruit and vegetable intake and
mental health in adults. The search adhered to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and the review was registered in the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42019138148). A search
for peer-reviewed observational studies published until June 2019 was performed in PubMed and
Web of Science databases, followed by an additional manual search for publications conducted via
analyzing the references of the found studies. With respect to the intake of fruit and/or vegetable,
studies that assessed the intake of fruits and/or vegetables, or their processed products (e.g., juices),
as a measure expressed in grams or as the number of portions were included. Those studies that
assessed the general dietary patterns were not included in the present analysis. With respect to
mental health, studies that assessed all the aspects of mental health in both healthy participants
and subjects with physical health problems were included, but those conducted in groups of
patients with intellectual disabilities, dementia, and eating disorders were excluded. To assess
bias, the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied. A total of 5911 studies were independently
extracted by 2 researchers and veriﬁed if they met the inclusion criteria using a 2-stage procedure
(based on the title, based on the abstract). After reviewing the full text, a total of 61 studies were
selected. A narrative synthesis of the ﬁndings from the included studies was performed, which was
structured around the type of outcome. The studies included mainly focused on depression and
depressive symptoms, but also other characteristics ranging from general and mental well-being,
quality of life, sleep quality, life satisfaction, ﬂourishing, mood, self-eﬃcacy, curiosity, creativity,
optimism, self-esteem, stress, nervousness, or happiness, to anxiety, minor psychiatric disorders,
distress, or attempted suicide, were analyzed. The most prominent results indicated that high
total intake of fruits and vegetables, and some of their speciﬁc subgroups including berries, citrus,
and green leafy vegetables, may promote higher levels of optimism and self-eﬃcacy, as well as reduce
the level of psychological distress, ambiguity, and cancer fatalism, and protect against depressive
symptoms. However, it must be indicated that the studies included were conducted using various
methodologies and in diﬀerent populations, so their results were not always suﬃciently comparable,
which is a limitation. Taken together, it can be concluded that fruits and/or vegetables, and some of
their speciﬁc subgroups, as well as processed fruits and vegetables, seems to have a positive inﬂuence
on mental health, as stated in the vast majority of the included studies. Therefore, the general
recommendation to consume at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day may be beneﬁcial also
for mental health.

1. Introduction

Mental disorders (referred by the International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related
Health Problems (ICD-10) [1] as F00–F99) are indicated as a global problem by the World Health
Organization (WHO). One in four individuals suﬀers from a mental disorder during some period of
life [2], and hence, the WHO has recognized mental disorders as a health burden that should be no
longer neglected [3]. Within the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020 implemented by
the WHO [4], it was indicated that there is a need for, inter alia, evidence-based practice for a life course
and a multidisciplinary approach to solve this problem. Taking into account the recommendation of
multisectoral actions that should be taken by various specialists from the sectors of health and social
services [4], the potential inﬂuence of nutrition should be included.

Some published studies have concluded that following a properly balanced diet allows maintaining
a better well-being and lowers the risk of mental disorders in adolescents and students [5,6]. This ﬁnding
was also conﬁrmed by O’Neil et al. in their systematic review [7]. At the same time, a therapeutic
role was indicated for the Mediterranean diet in 2 randomized controlled trials—HELFIMED [8] and
SMILES [9]—for the adults suﬀering from depression.

However, it is not easy to assess single elements of a whole dietary pattern and recognize their
eﬀect, as each individual consumes a wide range of various products at the same time [10]. Nonetheless,
some attempts have been made to identify the elements of a properly balanced diet, which are also
typical for the Mediterranean diet, that may be deﬁned as food products with beneﬁcial eﬀects on
mental health and aiding in recovery from mental illness; these include ﬁsh and seafood, legumes,
leafy greens and other vegetables, olive oil, dairy beverages, and nuts [11]. Similarly, the highest
Antidepressant Food Score (AFS), calculated based on the content of 12 nutrients that are related to the
prevention and treatment of depressive disorders, was given for vegetables, followed by organ meats
and fruits [12].

So far, some reviews have assessed the inﬂuence of the intake of fruit and vegetable, including
a meta-analysis by Liu et al. [13], which focused exclusively on the risk of depression and aroused
a great deal of controversy [14,15], and a recent meta-analysis by Saghaﬁan et al. [16], which also
focused exclusively on the risk of depression. In addition, a systematic review of prospective research,
analyzing the eﬀect on psychological health, was performed by Tuck et al. [17], but it focused exclusively
on vegetables. A review by Rooney et al. [18] analyzed the role of fruits and vegetables in the broad
aspects of psychological well-being, but it was not a systematic review and the authors emphasized
the need for a more exhaustive synthesis of studies in the form of a systematic review.

Fruit and vegetables are beneﬁcial for general health and the recent studies indicate that they may
be even more important than it was previously supposed and that to obtain prevention of cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and premature mortality even the higher intake than the generally-recommended
400 g is needed [19]. However, the mechanism of their inﬂuence on mental health is still unknown,
while a number of possible factors that may contribute to the positive impact are indicated [18].
Among them, there are speciﬁc nutrients, which are known as such that may be related to mental
health and for which fruit and vegetables are indicated as a valuable sources in diet, such as
complex carbohydrates [20] and ﬁber [21], being associated with glycemic index [22], C vitamin [23],
B vitamins [24], carotenoids [25], potassium [26], and polyphenols [27]. The other explanations are
associated with either possibility of reverse mechanism (higher level of mental health may promote
better diet, including higher fruit and vegetables intake) [28], or psychological explanation (following
better diet, including higher fruit and vegetables intake may promote more positive emotions and
better mental health) [29].

Taking this into account, the present study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the
observational studies analyzing the association between the intake of fruit and vegetables and
the broad aspects of mental health in adults.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Design

The search used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [30] and the review was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO) database (CRD42019138148). A systematic review of peer-reviewed observational studies
published until June 2019 was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases with the additional
manual search conducted via references of found studies.

2.2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

The present systematic review analyzed the association between the intake of fruit and/or
vegetable and mental health in adults. The studies included were those that assessed the intake of
fruit or vegetables (conducted using various methods) to specify the amount consumed (supposed
reason), together with an assessment of mental health (various factors, both self-assessed and
diagnosed) (supposed consequence) and an analysis of the association between the indicated factors.
The studies which analyzed the reverse association (assessment of the intake of fruit or vegetables as
inﬂuenced by mental health) were not included, but those that did not deﬁne the supposed reason
and consequence and considered only the intake of fruit or vegetables and mental health as coexisting
factors were included.

With respect to the intake of fruit and/or vegetables, studies that assessed the intake of fruits
and/or vegetables, or their processed products (e.g., juices), either as a measure expressed in grams
or as the number of portions, were included. Studies involving the analysis of highly processed
products (e.g., jam, beverages other than juices) were excluded. Only those studies presenting the
observations of habitual intake, with no short-term interventions, were included. The studies that did
not assess single products (intake of a speciﬁc fruit or vegetable) or groups (total intake of fruits and/or
vegetables) but assessed the general dietary patterns were analyzed; however, they were not included
in the present analysis if there was no separate assessment of the intake of fruit or vegetables.

With respect to mental health, studies that assessed all the aspects of mental health in both healthy
participants and those with physical health problems were included. However, studies conducted in
groups of patients with (1) intellectual disabilities, (2) dementia, and (3) eating disorders were excluded.
Only studies conducted in humans and especially adults were included.

The included studies presented the research conducted in all the countries, independent of the
location and income, but only those published in English, in peer-reviewed journals were taken
into account.

2.3. Search Strategy

The search for studies was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases; the strategy
applied for electronic search in both databases is presented in Supplementary Table S1. In addition,
a manual search for publications was conducted via analyzing the references of the found studies.
The search focused on gathering observational studies published until June 2019.

Studies were independently extracted by 2 researchers and screened based on the inclusion and
exclusion criteria using a 2-stage procedure: (1) Studies were veriﬁed based on the title; and (2) studies
included based on the title were veriﬁed based on the abstract. Any disagreement between the two
researchers over including a particular study was resolved through discussion with a third researcher.
The full texts of these potentially eligible studies were retrieved (by asking the corresponding author
for the full text, if needed) and independently assessed for eligibility by the two researchers. Again,

any disagreement between them over the eligibility of a particular study was resolved through
discussion with a third researcher.

The procedure of identiﬁcation, screening, assessment of eligibility, and inclusion is presented in

conducted systematic review.

2.4. Data Extraction

Data extraction was carried out independently by two researchers. Any disagreement between
them over speciﬁc data was resolved through discussion with a third researcher. Missing data were
requested from the authors of the studies, if possible, while the total number of 46 individual e-mails
have been sent to corresponding authors of the included studies, as well as to ﬁrst authors (if the ﬁrst
author was not corresponding one, but his e-mail address was provided in the full text of article). For 6
studies, authors not only answered, they also provided the requested data (in tables those data are
referred as provided by authors on request).

Data extracted from the studies included the following: General details of the study (author,
study design), observation (country/location, study group, time), participants (number of participants,
gender proportions, age, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria), exposure (method of assessment,
measure of fruit and vegetable, other fruit and vegetable products included), outcomes (method of
assessment, psychological measure), and ﬁndings (observations, conclusions).

In order to assess bias and the general quality of the studies, based on the Cochrane
recommendations for the tools for assessing the methodological quality or the risk of bias in
non-randomized studies [31], the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) [32] was applied, which is used

The procedure of identification, screening, assessment of eligibility, and inclusion is presented in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Procedure of identification, screening, eligibility assessment, and inclusion within the conducted systematic review. 2.4. Data Extraction Data extraction was carried out independently by two researchers. Any disagreement between them over specific data was resolved through discussion with a third researcher. Missing data were requested from the authors of the studies, if possible, while the total number of 46 individual e-mails have been sent to corresponding authors of the included studies, as well as to first authors (if the first author was not corresponding one, but his e-mail address was provided in the full text of article). For 6 studies, authors not only answered, they also provided the requested data (in tables those data are referred as provided by authors on request). Data extracted from the studies included the following: General details of the study (author, study design), observation (country/location, study group, time), participants (number of participants, gender proportions, age, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria), exposure (method of assessment, measure of fruit and vegetable, other fruit and vegetable products included), outcomes (method of assessment, psychological measure), and findings (observations, conclusions). In order to assess bias and the general quality of the studies, based on the Cochrane recommendations for the tools for assessing the methodological quality or the risk of bias in non-randomized studies [31], the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) [32] was applied, which is used commonly [33]. Each included study was assessed for the following criteria: For case-control Nutrients 2020, 12, 115

commonly [33]. Each included study was assessed for the following criteria: For case-control
studies—selection (scale from 0 to 4), comparability (scale from 0 to 2), and exposure (scale from 0 to 3);
and for cohort studies—selection (scale from 0 to 4), comparability (scale from 0 to 2), and outcome
(scale from 0 to 3). The results were interpreted based on the commonly assumed criteria and attributed
to the following categories: very high risk of bias (0–3 NOS points), high risk of bias (4–6 NOS points),
and low risk of bias (7–9 NOS points) [34].

The following types of outcomes were included to the presented systematic review: General
and mental well-being, quality of life, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and mood (general outcomes);
ﬂourishing, self-eﬃcacy, curiosity, creativity, optimism, self-esteem, and happiness (positive outcomes);
stress, nervousness, anxiety, minor psychiatric disorders, distress, depressive symptoms, depression,
and attempted suicide (negative outcomes). Due to the fact that numerous various outcomes were
included, while the number of studies for each outcome diﬀered from only one study, to a lot of studies
(as for depression or depressive symptoms), it was not possible to summarize the results in the form
of meta-analysis, as it requires including comparable studies only (for one type of outcome). As not
only outcomes, but also way to express risk factor (namely fruit and/or vegetable intake), studied
populations, and settings were not comparable, the studies may not be treated as suﬃciently similar
to be able to reanalyze the data in the form of meta-analysis, but in the future, while the number of
such studies will be higher, for each outcome, an adequate meta-analysis will be valuable to conclude.
Taking it into account, based on the data extracted and the assessment of the general quality of the
study, a narrative synthesis of the ﬁndings from the included studies was performed, which was
structured around the type of outcome.

3. Results

The list of studies included to the systematic review is presented in Supplementary Table S2.
The basic study details and design of observation for the studies included to the systematic review is
presented in Table 1. The studies presented in all the tables are listed accordingly based on the year
of publication. Among 61 included studies, the majority were conducted for European countries (20
studies), Asian countries (14 studies), or United States of America (USA) (11 studies), but also those
conducted for African (1 study), or South American country (1 study), Australia or New Zealand (7
studies), or Canada (3 studies) were included and some of them were conducted for mixed countries (4
studies). The studied populations were mainly adults (including young, middle aged, and older ones,
or only some of indicated groups) (37 studies), as well as only young ones (12 studies), middle aged
ones (3 studies), or old ones (9 studies). It should be indicated that 3 included studies were conducted
in a speciﬁc populations, while the health-related inclusion criteria for the study were deﬁned as
prediabetes and/or prehypertension [35], being after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery [36],
or having excessive body mass [37].

The characteristics of the study participants for the studies included to the systematic review is
presented in Supplementary Table S3. The characteristics of the study exposure and outcomes for the
studies included to the systematic review is presented in the Table 2. Among 61 included studies,
for the majority of them, a food frequency questionnaire, or a rapid screener was applied (32 studies),
or a speciﬁc questionnaire to assess the diet quality (1 study), or a simple question about fruit and
vegetable intake (22 studies), but for 4 studies, the method of dietary recall or record was applied, either
alone or combined with previously indicated methods, and for 2 studies the applied method was not
speciﬁed. To assess the mental health, various aspects of it were analyzed in the studies, while either
a single aspect or some aspects combined were assessed, including mainly depressive symptoms (18
studies), depression (15 studies), general and mental well-being (9 studies), stress (8 studies), distress
(8 studies), quality of life (7 studies), mood (5 studies), or anxiety (5 studies), but also in some of them
happiness (4 studies), life satisfaction (3 studies), or optimism (2 studies) were analyzed, and in single
studies only: sleep quality, ﬂourishing, self-eﬃcacy, curiosity, creativity, self-esteem, nervousness,
minor psychiatric disorders, or attempted suicide were indicated.

The characteristics of the study ﬁndings for the studies included to the systematic review
accompanied by the quality assessment based on the total score for the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale is
presented in the Table 3. The detailed results of the quality assessment based on the total score for the
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for categories of selection, comparability and exposure/outcome are presented
in Supplementary Table S4. Among 61 included studies, for the majority of them, a statistically
signiﬁcant inﬂuence of fruit and/or vegetable consumption on mental health was proven, but there
were also some studies, for which it was proven only in case of some factors associated with mental
health and not for all assessed ones and only few studies, for which it was not proven that there is
any association [37–39]. While concluding, authors of the included studies emphasized the existing
association, but also among most important remarks, they indicated risks resulting from not following
a recommendation to consume at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetable each day (2 studies), or they
indicated especially beneﬁcial groups of fruit and vegetables (2 studies).

Conclusion

Quality *

Ref.

[40]

[41]

Findings

Observation
Women with high stress consumed signiﬁcantly less fruits (p = 0.01) and vegetables (p = 0.02)
than women with low stress, with eﬀect sizes of d = 0.24 and 0.25, respectively, for the
between-group diﬀerences.

After adjustment for confounding variables, participants in the highest quartile of the fruits
consumption and vegetables consumption had lower prevalence ratio (PR) for depressive
symptoms (PR = 0.76; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.603–0.974, p = 0.042; PR = 0.77; 95% CI:
0.612–0.977, p = 0.045) than those in the lowest quartile. Those in the highest quartile of total
vegetables and fruits consumption had also a lower PR of depressive symptoms (PR = 0.67; 95%
CI: 0.503–0.806, p = 0.037) than did those in the lowest quartile.

[42]

Frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with improved health outcomes,
including mental health.

[43]

[44]

[45]

[35]

Fruit and vegetable consumption predicted an increased cognitive performance in older adults
including improved verbal recall, improved delayed verbal recall, improved digit span test
performance and improved verbal ﬂuency; the eﬀect of fruit consumption was much stronger
than the eﬀect of vegetable consumption. Regarding mental health, fruit consumption was
signiﬁcantly associated with better subjective quality of life and less depressive symptoms;
vegetable consumption, however, did not signiﬁcantly relate to mental health.

Consumption of vegetables and fruits in the last 3 days was less likely to be associated with
depression (OR 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02–0.45) and subsyndromal depression (OR 0.10; CI 95%:
0.03–0.39).
Fixed eﬀects regressions show that mental well-being (GHQ-12) responds in a dose-response
fashion to increases in both the quantity and the frequency of fruit and vegetables consumed.
This relationship is robust to the use of subjective well-being (life satisfaction) instead of mental
well-being. Increasing one’s consumption of fruit and vegetables by one portion (on a day where
at least one portion is consumed) leads to a 0.133-unit increase in mental well-being (p < 0.01).

Results of generalized estimating equations predicting mental-health-related quality of life
indicated that more frequent fruit consumption (p = 0.485) was not, but more frequent vegetable
consumption (p = 0.027) was in the fully adjusted model associated with greater mental
health-related quality of life. Fruit and vegetable consumption (p = 0.033) was associated with
greater mental-health-related quality of life only in the unadjusted model. More frequent fruit (p
= 0.566 and p = 0.751, respectively), vegetable (p = 0.173 and p = 0.399), and fruit and vegetable
consumption (p = 0.252 and p = 0.634, respectively) did not signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of major
depression and generalized anxiety disorder.

Nutrition counselling on increasing fruit and vegetable intakes may consider targeting
women who are black or younger or who report high stress, respectively.

Higher consumption of vegetables and fruits is signiﬁcantly associated with a lower
risk of depressive symptoms.

Frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables contributes to slower disablement
processes and might be an easily implementable way to improve the overall health of
older adults.

Consumption of fruits is associated with both improved cognitive and mental health in
older adults from non-Western developing countries, and consumption of vegetables is
associated with improved cognitive health only. Increasing fruit and vegetable
consumption might be one easy and cost-eﬀective way to improve the overall health
and quality of life of older adults in non-Western developing countries.

Findings support the importance for a healthy consumption of vegetables and fruits for
the older adult population in Singapore.

Persuading people to consume more fruits and vegetables may not only beneﬁt their
physical health in the long-run, but also their mental well-being in the short-run.

The study did not ﬁnd evidence that more frequent fruit and vegetable consumption
was associated with mental-health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety.
However, more frequent vegetable consumption was associated with greater
mental-health-related quality of life.

[46]

Inverse association was found between mental distress and higher intake of fruits (β = −0.64,
95% CI: −0.89 to −0.39; p < 0.001), vegetables (β = − 0.39, 95% CI: −0.65 to −0.13; p < 0.003).

Study suggests beneﬁcial association of Mediterranean diet and its elements (including
fruit and vegetables intake) and overall mental health, oﬀering important implications
for public health provisions.

Findings

After adjusting for potential confounders such as age, body-mass-index (BMI), parity,
educational status, occupation, marital status, household hunger scale and household asset
index, there was an increasing trend across terciles of vegetable intake in the past month for the
HR-QoL (p = 0.0003), mental health (MH) (p = 0.001) domain of the SF-36 and role emotional (p <
0.0001) domain of the SF-36. The multivariate model results a signiﬁcant increasing trend in the
adjusted mean scores of the HR-QoL (p = 0.04), MH (p = 0.001) as well as 4 subscales of the SF-36
[role-physical (p = 0.02), role-emotional (p = 0.05), emotional well-being (p = 0.002) and vitality (p
< 0.0001)] across terciles of the vegetable variety score.

Results suggest a potential beneﬁcial role of high vegetable intake and consumption of
more varied vegetables on HR-QoL.

[48]

After adjustment for confounding variables, the participants in the lower quartiles of total fruit
and vegetables, total vegetables, total fruits, citrus, other fruits and green leafy vegetables intake
were more likely to experience depression compared to those in the higher quartiles (p < 0.03).

Lower intake of total fruit and vegetables and some of its speciﬁc subgroups might be
associated with depression. The ﬁndings support encouragement of fruit and
vegetables consumption as part of a healthy diet and highlight the importance of fruit
and vegetables consumption and a number of their subgroups in mitigating the chance
of depression.

Mixed linear models showed that higher baseline levels of psychological well-being were
associated with more fruit and vegetable consumption at baseline (β = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02–0.08)
and that fruit and vegetable consumption declined across time (β = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.02–0.004).
Psychological well-being interacted signiﬁcantly with time such that individuals with higher
baseline psychological well-being had slower declines in fruit and vegetable consumption (β =
0.01, 95% CI: 0.01–0.02). Among individuals who initially met recommendations to consume 5 or
more servings of fruits and vegetables, higher baseline psychological well-being was associated
with 11% reduced risk of falling below recommended levels during follow-up (hazard ratio =
0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.95).

Controlling for covariates, raw fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) predicted reduced depressive
symptoms and higher positive mood, life satisfaction, and ﬂourishing; processed FVI only
predicted higher positive mood. The top 10 raw foods related to better mental health were
carrots, bananas, apples, dark leafy greens like spinach, grapefruit, lettuce, citrus fruits, fresh
berries, cucumber, and kiwifruit.

Psychological well-being may be a precursor to healthy behaviors such as eating a diet
rich in fruits and vegetables. Analyses also considered the likelihood of reverse
causality.

Raw FVI, but not processed FVI, signiﬁcantly predicted higher mental health outcomes
when controlling for the covariates. Applications include recommending the
consumption of raw fruits and vegetables to maximize mental health beneﬁts.

Individuals who were depressed at both times points had the highest proportion who failed to
consume any fruit (31%) or vegetables (42%) on the previous day. Fruit and vegetable
consumption did not predict of adult depression in fully adjusted models.

Cross sectional associations existed for diet and adolescent depression only. For adult
depression association was subsequently attenuated on adjustment for other relevant
factors.

Happiness was linearly associated with total fruit and vegetable intakes (p = 0.002).

Maintaining good nutrition and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption may be
important for psychological health of older people.

Subjects who reported to consume a greater amount of fruit were associated with a lower risk of
depression (OR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26–0.84, p = 0.011) after adjustment for many possible
confounders. Similar results were obtained for women, while no statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences emerged for men.

Diet rich in olive oil and fruit, characteristics of Mediterranean diet, may protect against
the development of depressive symptoms in older age.

Women in the top quintile of fruit intake, compared with those in the bottom quintile, had 57%,
50%, and 60% lower odds of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Consumption of
vegetables was signiﬁcantly associated with lower odds of depression (OR 0.65; 95% CI:
0.46–0.93) in women and lower odds of anxiety (OR 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22–0.87) in men. After
adjustment for potential confounders, women in the highest quintile of fruit and vegetables
intake, compared with those in the bottom quintile, had signiﬁcantly lower odds of depression
(OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37–0.80) and psychological distress (OR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40–0.90). High intake
of total fruit and vegetables was associated with lower odds of psychological distress (OR 0.42;
95% CI: 0.21–0.81) in men.

There was a signiﬁcant inverse associations between high intake of fruit with
depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in Iranian women. High consumption of
vegetables was also associated with lower risk of depression and anxiety, in women and
men. In addition, high intake of total fruit and vegetable was associated with lower
odds of depression and psychological distress in women and men.

Vegetable intake were associated with increased sleep quality, which in turn was associated with
increased overall quality of life (p < 0.05).

Results suggest possible relationships among the multiple health behaviors and their
associations with overall well-being.

Perceived ambiguity and cancer fatalism were negatively associated with fruit and vegetables
consumption (p < 0.001) whereas health-related self-eﬃcacy was positively associated with fruit
and vegetables consumption (b = 0.34, p < 0.001).

In India, those who consumed less than ﬁve servings of vegetables were respectively 41% (AOR
= 1.41; 95% CI: 0.60–3.33) and 57% (AOR = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.93–2.64) more likely to report
severe-extreme and mild-moderate depression during past 30 days compared to those who
consumed ﬁve servings a day. Regarding fruit consumption, compared to those who consumed
ﬁve servings a day, the odds of severe-extreme and mild-moderate self-reported depression were
respectively 3.5 times (AOR = 3.48; 95% CI: 1.216–10.01) and 45% (AOR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.89–2.32)
higher in Bangladesh, and 2.9 times (AOR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.12–7.64) and 42% higher (AOR = 1.41;
95% CI: 0.89–2.24) in Nepal compared to those who consumed less than ﬁve servings a day
during last 30 days.

Baseline fruit and vegetable consumption considered separately or combined, was associated
with a lower prevalence of psychological distress even after adjustment for sociodemographic
characteristics and lifestyle risk factors. Baseline fruit and vegetable consumption, measured
separately or combined, was associated with a lower incidence of psychological distress in
minimally adjusted models. Most of these associations remained signiﬁcant at medium levels of
intake but were no longer signiﬁcant at the highest intake levels in fully adjusted models.

Results indicate that the amount of fruit and vegetable consumption was positively associated
with happiness and inversely associated with depression. Happiness increased with any increase
to fruit and vegetable consumption, the strongest increase in the adjusted analysis was with 6
servings of fruit and vegetables, with a coeﬃcient of 0.41. Depressive symptoms decreased with
any increase to fruit and vegetable consumption, the strongest decrease in the adjusted analysis
was with 6 servings of fruit and vegetables, with a coeﬃcient of −1.04.

Individual choice inﬂuences fruit and vegetables consumption, but external control
beliefs, as measured by perceived ambiguity of cancer prevention recommendations
and cancer fatalism, and internal control beliefs, as measured by health-related
self-eﬃcacy, may be important inputs to these decisions.

Daily intake of less than ﬁve servings of fruit and vegetables was associated with higher
odds of depression. Nutrition programs aimed at promoting fruit and vegetables
consumption might prove beneﬁcial to reduce the prevalence of depression in south
Asian population.

Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption may help reduce psychological distress in
middle-aged and older adults.

Healthier behavior patterns of fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with
higher happiness and lower depression scores among university students across 28
countries.

The intake of green vegetables was associated with lower odds of having clinically-relevant
levels of depressive symptoms (OR 0.192, p = 0.016).

Green vegetables, total FVI showed protective eﬀects regarding clinically-relevant
levels of depressive symptoms.

For depression subtypes, statistically signiﬁcantly positive associations of vegetable consumption
and adherence to the 5-a-day recommendation with current unspeciﬁed and current melancholic
major depressive disorder were found (OR 2.09; 95% CI: 1.08–4.06 and OR 2.51; 95% CI: 1.21–5.21,
respectively; multivariable adjusted for demographic and other dietary factors)
Mean positive aﬀect increased linearly as a function of number of daily servings of fruits and
vegetables; the pattern of this relationship did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly for males and females. This
association remained statistically signiﬁcant after controlling for demographic variables (age, sex,
and parent education levels); other diet variables (consumption of sugar containing beverages,
coﬀee or tea, and fat); and other health behaviors (exercise, sleep quality and smoking). Life
satisfaction and negative aﬀect were not signiﬁcantly related to fruit and vegetable consumption.
Participants in the lowest tertile of fruits and/or vegetables consumption had greater prevalence
of depressive symptoms (PR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.39–2.55) than those in the highest tertile. This
association was stronger with fruits (PR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.46–2.53) than vegetables (PR = 1.42;
95% CI: 1.05–1.93) alone.
High fruit or high vegetable consumption alone (>5 times/week) was not signiﬁcantly associated
with new depressive symptoms. Combining high fruit (OR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41–0.89), vegetable
(OR 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26–0.93) or fruit and vegetable (OR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.20–0.77) consumption with
high leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) reduced the likelihood of developing subsequent new
depressive symptoms beyond LPTA alone.

Measure of happiness was positively associated with the amount of fruit and vegetable
consumption (p = 0.02, and 0.045 respectively). Students who ate breakfast every day, more than
8 servings of fruit and vegetables daily, and had 3 meals in addition to 1–2 snacks per day had
the highest happiness score.

Increased fruit and vegetable consumption was predictive of increased happiness, life
satisfaction, and well-being. They were up to 0.24 life-satisfaction points (for an increase of 8
portions a day), which is equal in size to the psychological gain of moving from unemployment
to employment. Improvements occurred within 24 months.
In males, anxiety was correlated with lower daily intakes of fruits and vegetables (r = −0.216, p =
0.013).

Fruit and vegetables consumption predicted greater eudaemonic well-being, curiosity, and
creativity at the between- and within-person levels. Young adults who ate more fruit and
vegetables reported higher average eudaemonic well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity,
and greater creativity compared with young adults who ate less fruit and vegetables. On days
when young adults ate more fruit and vegetables, they reported greater eudaemonic well-being,
curiosity, and creativity compared with days when they ate less fruit and vegetables. Fruit and
vegetables consumption also predicted higher positive eﬀects, which mostly did not account for
the associations between fruit and vegetables and the other well-being variables. Lagged data
analyses showed no carry-over eﬀects of fruit and vegetables consumption onto next-day
well-being (or vice versa).

There is no consistent association between adherence to dietary recommendations and
major depressive disorder or subtypes of depression.

There is an association of fruits and vegetable consumption with well-being.

An inverse relationship between consumption of fruits and/or vegetables and
depressive symptoms was concluded. There is a need to implement strategies to
promote better diet patterns with potential impact on mental health.

The simultaneous presence of several good lifestyle habits (high fruit and vegetable
consumption with high leisure-time physical activity) increases the beneﬁcial eﬀect of
reducing the risk of developing depressive symptoms in older adults. Thus, older
adults are encouraged to have as many good lifestyle habits as possible to reduce the
risk of depressive symptoms.

Healthier behavior pattern (including fruit and vegetable consumption) was associated
with higher happiness scores among medical students.

Eating certain foods is a form of investment in future happiness and well-being. The
implications of fruit and vegetable consumption are estimated to be substantial and to
operate within the space of 2 years.

A strict plant-based diet does not appear to negatively impact mood.

Fruit and vegetables consumption may be related to a broader range of well-being
states than signal human ﬂourishing in early adulthood.

Fruit and vegetable consumption at each cycle was inversely associated with next-cycle
depression (β = −0.03, 95% CI: −0.05 to −0.01, p < 0.01) and psychological distress (β = −0.03,
95% CI: −0.05 to −0.02, p < 0.0001). However, once models were adjusted for other health-related
factors, these associations were attenuated (β = −0.01, 95% CI: −0.04 to 0.02, p = 0.55; β = −0.00,
95% CI: −0.03 to 0.02, p = 0.78 for models predicting depression and distress, respectively).

Signiﬁcant associations were found between vegetables intake (green salad) and physical health
days for Hispanics and fruit and vegetables intake (green salad, fruit, and fruit juice) and
self-reported health for Chinese.

Men who experienced mild to moderate levels of stress were less likely to consume vegetables
and fruit (p < 0.05) compared with their unstressed counterparts. The trend analysis results
indicated signiﬁcant dose–response patterns in the relationship between stress level and
consumption of vegetables and fruit (negative trend) (adjusted OR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.48–0.87; p <
0.05). For female students signiﬁcant dose–response trend was found in the relationship between
stress levels and the consumption of vegetables and fruit (both negative trends) (p < 0.01).

Consumers fulﬁlling the 5-a-day recommendation had lower odds of being highly or moderately
distressed than individuals consuming less fruit and vegetables (moderate vs. low distress: OR
0.82; 95% CI: 0.69–0.97; high vs. low distress: OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.41–0.75).
For females fresh fruits (−0.085; p < 0.001), salad/raw vegetables (−0.048; p < 0.001), cooked
vegetables (−0.061; p < 0.001) intake were respectively negatively associated with Perceived
Stress Score. For both sexes, consuming fresh fruits (−0.111; p < 0.001 for females; −0.074; p =
0.047 for males), salads (−0.071; p < 0.001 for females; −0.091; p = 0.014 for males), cooked
vegetables (−0.072; p < 0.001 for females; −0.089; p = 0.017 for males) was signiﬁcantly negatively
associated with perceived stress and depressive symptoms scores.
Analysis showed reduced odds of depressive symptoms OR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79–0.95, p = 0.001)
among women who ate ≥ 2 of fruit/day and OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67–0.93, p = 0.007) among women
who ate ≥ 5 vegetables/day, even after adjustment for several factors including smoking, alcohol,
body mass index, physical activity, marital status, education, energy, ﬁsh intake, and
comorbidities.

Higher Beck Depression Inventory scores correlated with lower fruit and vegetable consumption
(r = −0.20, p = 0.006). Women reporting a history of treatment for depression showed lower
levels of fruit and vegetable consumption (mean daily servings = 2.0 [1.3] vs. 2.5 [1.3],
respectively, p = 0.03). Participants reporting current antidepressant use (versus non-users) did
not diﬀer on dietary habits.

Findings suggest that relations between fruit and vegetable intake, other health-related
behaviors and depression are complex.

There is a need to promote healthy living behaviors among aging NYC racial/ethnic
populations

There is a diﬀerence in food selection patterns between stressed male and female
students, with stress being a more signiﬁcant predictor of unhealthy food selection
among male students.

Daily intake of 5 servings of fruit and vegetable was associated with lower
psychological distress.

The associations between consuming ‘healthy’ foods and lower depressive symptoms
and perceived stress among male and female students in three UK countries suggest
that interventions to reduce depressive symptoms and stress among students could also
result in the consumption of healthier foods and/or vice versa.

Increasing fruit consumption may be one important factor for reducing both the
prevalence and incidence of depressive symptoms in mid-age women.

Fruit and vegetable consumption partially mediated associations between depression
and time to cardiovascular disease events.

Depressive symptoms were not associated with fruit and vegetables intake (p > 0.05).

Future studies should explore the mechanisms linking the identiﬁed associations
between depressive symptoms and dietary intake, such as the role of emotional eating.

After adjustment for potential confounders, the AHEI score was inversely associated with
recurrent depressive symptoms in a dose-response fashion in women (p = 0.001; for 1 SD in
AHEI score; OR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.47–0.75) but not in men, while among its components vegetable
and fruit intake were signiﬁcant.

Poor diet may be a risk factor for future depression in women.

No signiﬁcant associations were found between prevalence of distress and vegetable and/or fruit
intake (p = 0.911 for males; p = 0.908 for females).

Greater fruit and vegetable intake was signiﬁcantly associated with lower odds of depression
(OR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.71–0.75)—for all 5 waves. Perceived poor mental health status and previous
diagnosis of a mood disorder and anxiety disorder also demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant
inverse associations with fruit and vegetable intake (all p < 0.05).
In the ﬁrst wave, greater fruit and vegetable intake was signiﬁcantly associated with lower odds
of depression (OR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78–0.92). A combined estimate of all 5 waves demonstrated
similar results (OR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.71–0.75). Relative to those with the lowest fruit and vegetable
intake, those with the greatest fruit and vegetable intake also had signiﬁcantly lower odds of
suﬀering from distress (OR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78–0.98). These results were consistent across other
waves. Perceived poor mental health status and previous diagnosis of a mood disorder and
anxiety disorder also demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant inverse associations with fruit and
vegetable intake (all p < 0.05).
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p > 0.05) of intake of vegetable products and dishes in
women with depression compared with women without depression. The regression model
indicated among others that increased intakes per kilojoule of vegetables (p = 0.015) are
associated with lower odds of having depression.

After adjustments for potentially confounding factors, the odds ratios of having mild and severe
depressive symptoms by increasing levels of tomatoes/tomato products were 1.00, 0.54, and 0.48
(p <0.01). No relationship was observed between intake of other kinds of vegetables and
depressive symptoms.

Psychological distress is not associated with reduced intake fruit and vegetables.

Findings suggest a potentially important role of a healthy diet in the prevention of
depression and anxiety.

The results conﬁrm a collective eﬀect of diet on mood.

Tomato-rich diet is independently related to lower prevalence of depressive symptoms
and may have a beneﬁcial eﬀect on the prevention of depressive symptoms.

Dietary intake of inter alia fruits and vegetables was signiﬁcantly higher in the low-stress group
than in high-stress group. There was an inverse association between stress level and intake of
fruits and vegetables (OR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76–0.90).

The results showed a signiﬁcant positive association between dietary intake and stress.
There must be a special attention to dietary intake in stress management program of
high-stress individuals, and in dietary recommendations, psychologic aspects should
be considered.

Analyses of same-day within-person associations revealed that on days when young adults
experienced greater positive aﬀect, they reported eating more servings of fruit (p = 0.002) and
vegetables (p < 0.001). Results of lagged analysis showed that fruits and vegetables predicted
improvements in positive aﬀect the next day, suggesting that healthy foods were driving
aﬀective experiences and not vice versa. Meaningful changes in positive aﬀect were observed
with the daily consumption of approximately 7–8 servings of fruit or vegetables.

In cross-sectional data, happiness and mental health rise in an approximately dose–response way
with the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables. Well-being peaks at approximately 7
portions per day. It was documented for seven measures of well-being (life satisfaction,
WEMWBS mental well-being, GHQ mental disorders, self-reported health, happiness,
nervousness, and feeling low). The pattern is robust to adjustment for a large number of other
demographic, social and economic variables.

Eating fruit and vegetables may promote emotional well-being among healthy young
adults.

There is a positive association between eating fruit and vegetables and having high
mental well-being.

Conclusion

Compared to the regional nutrition survey data, a greater proportion of study participants (the
members of Mood Disorders Association of British Columbia) consumed fewer of the
recommended servings of vegetables and fruits (p < 0.05).

The adults with mood disorders could beneﬁt from nutritional interventions to improve
diet quality.

Fruit and vegetable consumption was lower in depressed individuals, than in comparison
individuals, that remained signiﬁcant in multivariable models.

These results may indicate the importance of components of fruits and vegetables,
including antioxidants, rather than dietary supplements.

In a regression model that controlled for demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and
disease/health-related variables but not cognitive status, both fruits (OR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45–0.98, p
= 0.038) and vegetables (OR 0.38; 95% CI: 0.17–0.86, p = 0.021) were protective against depressive
symptoms 4 years later. When the same regression model was also adjusted for cognitive status,
only vegetables (OR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17–0.95, p = 0.039) were protective against depressive
symptoms.

More frequent consumption of vegetables seems to be protective against depressive
symptoms in the elderly.

Patients who ate fruit more frequently tended to have a better quality of life.

There is an association between food pattern and quality of life in this population.

Neither mental nor physical health was associated with fruit and vegetable intake (p < 0.05).

Depressive symptoms were related to a lower consumption of vegetables/fruit.

The consumption of vegetables is more prevalent among people with low or moderate
depression than those with severe depression (p < 0.05).
In men, attempters (n = 92) had a high odds of low consumption of vegetables (OR 2.47, 95% CI:
1.19–5.15). In women, attempters (n = 275) had a high odds of insuﬃcient fruit consumption (OR
2.36, 95% CI: 1.15–4.85).

For male students, none of the food consumption groups were associated with perceived stress
or depressive symptoms. In females, perceived stress and depressive symptoms were associated
with less frequent consumption of fruits/vegetables.

Single mothers had lower intake of fruits and vegetables and lower self-worth compared to the
married and cohabiting mothers, controlling for age, education and BMI.
A high level of dispositional optimism was associated with higher intakes of fruit (p = 0.01), and
vegetables (p = 0.01), independently from age, education, living arrangement, self-rated health,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and body mass index, as well as total energy
intake.

Fruit and vegetable consumption may be too speciﬁc to represent an individual’s
overall diet.
Depressive symptoms may aﬀect unhealthy food choices. The relations between
negative emotions such as depressive symptoms and food consumption are most likely
bidirectional: food consumed aﬀects mood and mood aﬀects food choices.
Unhealthy dietary choices seems to promote depression. Eﬀorts to lower the prevalence
of depression in the elderly should target on the factors such as dietary habits.

The data suggest that fruits and vegetables were signiﬁcantly under-consumed in
adults who had ever attempted suicide.

Consistent associations were observed between unhealthy food consumption and
depressive symptoms and perceived stress among female students from three European
countries, but not among male students. Eﬀorts to reduce depressive symptoms and
stress among female students may also lead to the consumption of healthier foods
and/or vice-versa.

A lower sense of self-worth and lower intake of fruit and vegetables in single mothers
could be seen in the context of the social disadvantages and less social support.

Dispositional optimism in elderly men is associated with healthy lifestyle and dietary
habits.

Stepwise logistic regression models found that frequency of consumption of fresh fruit had
apparently independent eﬀects on perceived stress, whereas the intake level of fresh fruit was
signiﬁcantly associated with depression.

The link between food consumption frequency, perceived stress and depression
suggests that diet intervention may be considered a mediate strategy integrated in
psychology prevention program among normal population of the college.

Findings

Both women and men above the upper quartile for optimism more often ate fresh vegetables and
salads (women 6%/men 57%), berries (23%/9%), fruit (67%/42%), than those below the lower
quartile (56%/31%, 14%/5%, and 52%/26%, respectively) with women in higher proportion than
in men in each case.

Women having poor mental health were less likely than their healthier counterparts to report
consuming fresh vegetables, fresh fruits on a daily basis. Men having poor mental health
reported consuming less frequently fresh fruits. These results remained statistically signiﬁcant in
the fully adjusted model.
The mood of females was signiﬁcantly better when more fruit/vegetables were consumed
(F(2,157) = 12.39, p < 0.001). There was no association between the amount consumed by males
and scores on the GHQ [F(2,163) = 1.09, NS]. In females a lower intake of fruit/vegetables was
associated with higher levels of anxiety (F(2,157) = 8.78, p < 0.002), a relationship not found in
males (F(2,163) = 0.29, NS). Females who consumed greater amounts of fruit/vegetables were less
depressed [F(2,157) = 12.77, p < 0.0001], although there was no such relationship in males
(F(2,163) = 1.23, NS).

Lack of optimism is associated with a cluster of unhealthy dietary and other habits.

The results suggest that poor mental health is associated with unhealthy food habits.

Eating large amounts of fruit and vegetables were less likely to be anxious or depressed;
the relationship existed irrespective of age and social background.

4. Discussion

27 of 34

The systematic review of the observational studies analyzing the association between the intake
of fruit and vegetable and mental health in adults revealed the possible beneﬁcial inﬂuence of the
indicated products. This association was studied for various aspects of mental health, ranging
from general and mental well-being [35,45,49,62,68,77,82,84,94], quality of life [36,39,42,43,47,55,70],
sleep quality [55], life satisfaction [50,66,82], ﬂourishing [50], mood [50,62,68,77,81], self-eﬃcacy [56],
curiosity [68], creativity [68], optimism [91,93], self-esteem [90], stress [40,48,67,71,73,80,89,92],
nervousness [82], or happiness [52,59,65,82], to anxiety [35,48,50,54,67], minor psychiatric disorders [46],
distress [38,46,54,58,69,72,77,82], depressive symptoms [37,41,43,50,51,53,59,60,63,64,73,74,76,79,85–87,
89], depression [35,42,44,48,54,57,61,67,69,75,77,78,83,84,92], or attempted suicide [88].

Moreover, the indicated eﬀect was studied and stated not only for fresh fruits and vegetables [35–95]
but also for fruit and vegetable products, such as juices [37,39,40,48,49,51,52,54,56,60,61,65,70,72,82,83,
88,92,94], dried [37,49,54,66], and canned fruits and vegetables [37,38,49,50,58,65,66], salads [39,40,44,
49,52,54,58,61,62,72–74,89,93,94], soups [39,40,62], or ketchup [39,79], and even for potatoes in some
studies that included it to the total intake of fruits and vegetables [39,74]. This corresponds to the
general conclusions of some studies that not only the intake of fruit and vegetable should be increased,
but also at least 5 portions of fruits or vegetables must be taken daily as recommended to observe
a positive inﬂuence on the general mental health [57,72].

The reason behind promoting the consumption of 5 portions of fruits or vegetables daily is that
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO have recommended
to consume a minimum of 400 g of fruits and vegetables per day, excluding potatoes and other
starchy tubers, with an estimated serving size of 80 g [96]. This recommendation is also supported
by a number of prominent experts, boards, and associations, such as the National Health Service
(NHS) in Great Britain [97], American Heart Association (AHA) [98], Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) [99], and Oﬃce of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) in the United
States of America [100]. Moreover, not only the role of raw fruits and vegetables but also that of the
processed fruits and vegetables, including frozen, canned, or cooked ones [101], as well as juices [102],
is emphasized to meet the recommended intake.

Increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables to the recommended level may result in a noticeable
and measurable eﬀect, as was stated in some included studies. An increase in the consumption of fruits
and vegetables by one portion a day leads to a 0.133-unit improvement in the mental well-being assessed
by GHQ-12 scale [45], while the consumption of 7–8 servings a day leads to meaningful changes in
positive aﬀect [81] and consumption of 8 portions a day leads to a 0.24-unit increase in life satisfaction
(equivalent to the psychological gain of moving from unemployed status to employed) [66]. However
in general, any increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables results in the improvement of
well-being, enhances happiness, and decreases depressive symptoms, with the strongest eﬀect observed
for 6 servings a day [59], 7 servings a day [82], or more than 8 servings a day (combined with breakfast
every day and 3 meals in addition to 1–2 snacks per day) [65], depending on the studied group.

It must be indicated that among the included studies, some highlighted not only the general
eﬀect of fruits and vegetables but also the inﬂuence of speciﬁc types, such as citrus [48], berries [93],
green leafy vegetables [48], green salad [70], and tomatoes [79]. Simultaneously, among the raw fruits
and vegetables, the following were indicated as specially related to better mental health: Bananas,
apples, citrus, berries, grapefruit, kiwifruit, carrots, lettuce, cucumber, and green leafy vegetables,
particularly spinach [50]. Authors of the indicated studies have no deﬁnite explanation why those
fruits or vegetables may be especially valuable, similarly as the general mechanism of the inﬂuence on
mental health is still unknown [18]. However, it may be supposed that the positive inﬂuence should
be attributed to a speciﬁc nutritional value, as a combination of high content of compounds positive
for mental health and, at the same time, low content of those negative for mental health, as indicated
by LaChance and Ramsey [12]. However, such assumption does not take into account the potential
interactions between nutrients in food product and between food products in the diet, so it must

Nutrients 2020, 12, 115

28 of 34

be also emphasized that in fact estimating the independent eﬀect of only one type of food products
(fruits and vegetables), or nutrients may be hard to conduct, due to other food products, or nutrients,
that are interfering.

While presenting the results of the included studies analyzing the association between the intake of
fruit and vegetable and mental health in adults, it must be emphasized that the risk of bias varied from
very high to low (deﬁned based on the commonly assumed criteria [34]) as shown by the total NOS
score. Taking this into account, the highest attention must be paid to those studies interpreted as having
a low risk of bias and the highest quality. Within such studies, it was observed that high total intake
of fruits and vegetables and some of their speciﬁc subgroups, including berries, might be associated
with a high level of optimism [93], while this association is independent of interfering factors [91].
High intake of fruits and vegetables was also associated with a higher level of self-eﬃcacy [56], as well
as a low level of psychological distress [58], ambiguity, and cancer fatalism [56]. In addition, it was
observed that high total intake of fruits and vegetables and some of their speciﬁc subgroups, including
citrus and green leafy vegetables, might be associated with a lower risk of depression [48], but other
health-related factors may also play a role in this association [69,85]. Furthermore, it was highlighted
that increasing physical activity may be necessary to beneﬁt from the positive eﬀect of the consumption
of fruit and vegetable to protect against depressive symptoms [64].

In spite of the fact that the vast majority of the included studies presented compatible conclusions
that mental health beneﬁts can be attained with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables,
some limitations of this systematic review must be indicated. The main issue results from the
fact, that association between fruit or vegetables intake and mental health does not allow to state
unambiguously that the intake inﬂuences mental health, as the reverse causation is also possible,
so only based on experimental study it may be concluded with no doubts, that such inﬂuence exists.
Moreover, it must be emphasized that no uniform deﬁnition of fruit and vegetables was established
in analyzed studies as various fruit and vegetable products were either included or excluded from
this group, that may also have inﬂuenced the observed association. Last but not least, the included
studies were conducted using various methodologies, in diﬀerent populations, and involved diverse
measures of intake of fruits and vegetables. Therefore, further studies should be conducted covering
all the aspects of mental health in various populations and using the similar methodology, to analyze
the association between the consumption of fruits and vegetables and mental health in detail.

5. Conclusions

The vast majority of the included studies indicated that the intake of fruits and/or vegetables and
their speciﬁc subgroups, as well as processed fruits and vegetables, seems to have a positive inﬂuence
on mental health. Therefore, the general recommendation to consume at least 5 portions of fruit and
vegetable a day may be beneﬁcial also for mental health.
