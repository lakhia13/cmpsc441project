Abstract
Rationale  Dopamine antagonists induce dopamine receptor supersensitivity. This may manifest in late-appearing move-
ment disorders (tardive dyskinesia (TD). VMAT-2 inhibitors reduce dopaminergic transmission but have limited activity at 
postsynaptic receptors and so may have antipsychotic activity with lower risk of tardive dyskinesia.
Methods  We conducted a systematic database search from inception to September 2022 for articles describing the use of 
VMAT-2 inhibitors in psychosis. Inclusion criteria were as follows: Population: adults diagnosed with psychosis or schizo-
phrenia; Intervention: treatment with tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine or valbenazine; Comparison: comparison with placebo 
or/and antipsychotic drug; Outcomes: with efficacy outcomes (e.g. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) change or clinician 
assessment) and adverse effects ratings (e.g. rating scale or clinician assessment or dropouts); and Studies: in randomised 
controlled trials and non-randomised studies.
Results  We identified 4892 records relating to VMAT-2 inhibitor use of which 5 (173 participants) met our a priori meta-
analysis inclusion criteria. VMAT-2 inhibitors were more effective than placebo for the outcome ‘slight improvement’ (risk 
ratio (RR) = 1.77 (95% CI 1.03, 3.04)) but not for ‘moderate improvement’ (RR 2.81 (95% CI 0.27, 29.17). VMAT-2 inhibi-
tors were as effective as active comparators on both measures for—‘slight improvement’ (RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.6, 1.81)) and 
‘moderate improvement’ (RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.51, 2.42). Antipsychotic efficacy was also suggested by a narrative review of 
37 studies excluded from the meta-analysis.
Conclusions  VMAT-2 inhibitors may have antipsychotic activity and may offer promise for treatment of psychosis with the 
potential for a reduced risk of TD.

Introduction

It is accepted that the symptoms of schizophrenia are 
at  least  in  part  caused  by  abnormalities  in  neuronal 
dopamine function. The core dysfunction appears to 
be  an  increase  in  presynaptic  synthesis  and  release 
of striatal dopamine (DA) (Howes et al. 2017). Most 
currently  available  antipsychotics  block  postsynap-
tic  dopamine  2  (D2)  receptors  (pimavanserin  is  the 
sole exception (Rissardo et al. 2022)) but do not sig-
nificantly alter dopamine synthesis capacity at con-
temporary therapeutic doses (Jauhar et al. 2019). D2 
antagonism  may  induce  sensitivity  of  postsynaptic 
dopamine  receptors  (Chouinard  et  al. 1978;  Fallon 
et al. 2012), and cessation of D2 antagonists may then 
expose the patient to the effects of both the inherent 
elevated DA synthesis and supersensitive postsynaptic

D2 receptors. This drug-induced sensitivity and the 
absence of effect on the core pathological mechanism 
help explain the very high risks of relapse after stop-
ping antipsychotics (90% at 2 years after a first epi-
sode) (Zipursky et al. 2014).

There are several potential pharmacological methods 
of countering increased synthesis of dopamine. These 
include directly decreasing synthesis, reducing intra-
cellular transport, inhibiting vesicular storage, stimu-
lating pre-synaptic (negative feedback) receptors and 
blocking  post-synaptic  receptors.  Of  these  methods, 
only  post-synaptic  D2  antagonism  is  used  clinically 
(although pre-synaptic blockade may also contribute 
via depolarization block) (Grace et al. 1997). However, 
there  are  licensed  compounds  available  which  affect 
vesicular monoamine uptake. Deutetrabenazine, tetra-
benazine and valbenazine deplete vesicular storage of 
dopamine (as well as serotonin, noradrenaline and his-
tamine)  in  presynaptic  nerve  terminals  by  reversibly 
inhibiting  human  vesicular  monoamine  transporter 
isoform 2 (VMAT-2 inhibitors). This inhibition results 
in  a  reduced  inclusion  of  monoamines  into  synaptic 
vesicles, a corresponding depletion of functional mono-
amine stores and ultimately a reduction in neurotrans-
mitter release. The three available VMAT-2 inhibitors 
have a broadly similar mode of action. Most is known 
about tetrabenazine—a drug that is more than 60 years 
old.  Tetrabenazine  preferentially  depletes  dopamine 
over serotonin and noradrenaline whilst also modestly 
reducing levels of acetylcholine, glutamate and aspar-
tate (Stahl 2018b; Zheng et al. 2006).

VMAT-2 inhibitors do not appear to induce postsynaptic 
DA supersensitivity. Indeed, VMAT-2 inhibitors are used to 
treat tardive dyskinesia (TD)—a condition caused by chronic 
dopamine receptor blockade and a presumed consequent 
upregulation of D2 receptors and altered synaptic plasticity. 
Moreover, by reducing presynaptic dopamine storage and 
thus the amount released into the synaptic cleft, VMAT-2 
inhibitors act more directly against excess stimulation of 
hypersensitive D1 and D2 receptors, the proposed pathologi-
cal basis of TD.

VMAT-2 inhibitors are licensed only for the treatment 
of TD but tetrabenazine was at one time indicated as an 
antipsychotic.  These  drugs  may  offer  the  prospect  of 
improved outcome in long-term treatment of psychosis; 
they may reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms but 
with a more limited effect on postsynaptic DA receptor 
sensitivity. We undertook a systematic review of studies of 
VMAT-2 inhibitors in people with psychosis and similar 
conditions.

Method

Meta‑analysis

Study selection

A priori selection parameters  The criteria for inclusion in 
this review were as described in the following pre-defined 
PICOS tool. Population: adults (minimum of 18 years old, 
including older adults aged more than 65 years old) who 
were diagnosed with psychosis or schizophrenia (or broad 
equivalent in older studies). The diagnostic method was not 
restricted in any way. Intervention: treatment with dopa-
mine synthesis inhibitors: tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine 
or valbenazine. Any route of administration, dose, duration 
and co-intervention treatment was eligible. Comparison: 
placebo or/and antipsychotic drug. Outcomes: efficacy (e.g. 
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) change or clinician 
assessment) and adverse effects (e.g. rating scale or clinician 
assessment or dropouts). Studies: randomised controlled tri-
als and non-randomised studies.

Studies that did not meet the criteria listed above were 

examined for inclusion in a narrative review.

Search methods for identification of studies  The follow-
ing databases were searched: EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, 
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Psychiatry Online, PubMed and 
Web of Science. We also included all the citations from the 
top 10% of references in the Web of Science search.

All the databases (except PubMed) were searched from 
inception until November 2020 using the keyword terms 
below. Search terms were adapted to the thesaurus of each 
database.

These databases including PubMed were also searched 
for a second time using the terms ‘Nitoman’ and ‘R1-9569’ 
from  inception  until  May  2021.  This  entire  search  was 
repeated for the last time in September 2022.

Medical  Subject  Headings  (MeSH)  terms  were  used 
where available; otherwise, free-text searching was used. 
Studies were limited to humans, and there were no restric-
tions in respect to language. Google Translate and native 
speakers  were  used  to  translate  non-English  language 
studies.

The reference sections of all studies retrieved were also 

searched for relevant studies.

Data collection and analysis

Selection  of  studies  Three  authors  (DT,  AC  and  PW) 
screened study abstracts and titles and retrieved potentially 
relevant complete text papers for detailed examination. Disa-
greements about inclusion were resolved by discussion with 
a fourth author (OD).

Data collection and management  Two authors (AC and 
PW)  extracted  study  data  independently,  and  disagree-
ments between the two were resolved by discussion with a 
third author (OD). For studies where relevant data were not 
available, the study authors were contacted via email. The 
following study characteristics were extracted for the meta-
analysis section of this investigation: year of publication, 
country of origin, study design, main diagnosis, duration of 
treatment, number of participants (total, responders, remit-
ters, dropouts for intervention and comparator), age range 
of participants, care setting, sex, intervention, comparator 
and outcome measure (baseline scores (SD) and endpoint 
score (SD) for intervention and comparator). Study-defined 
psychosis rating scale scores were extracted to determine 
response to treatment. Response was categorised as ‘slight 
improvement’ and ‘moderate improvement’, corresponding 
to Clinical Global Impressions Improvement Scale (CGI-
I) scores 3 (minimally improved) and 2 (much improved), 
respectively. For example, ‘definite improvement’, ‘signifi-
cant improvement’ or ‘marked improvement’ were catego-
rised as CGI-I 2 and ‘slight improvement/response’ as CGI-I 
3 (See supplementary Table S2).

Study authors were contacted to obtain missing informa-

tion or to clarify the information available (AC).

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  The Cochrane 
risk of bias tool (version 2) (Sterne et al. 2019) was com-
pleted independently by two authors (AC and PW), with 
disagreements resolved by a third author (OD). The assess-
ment of the risk-of-bias was incorporated into the interpreta-
tion of the results.

Dealing  with  missing  data  and  assessment  of  reporting 
biases  The impact of missing data in individual studies 
was explored by imputing missing values with reported 

reasons for their ‘missingness’ and synthesising these using 
STATA’s METAMISS command (White and Higgins 2007).

Assessment of heterogeneity  The presence and extent of 
heterogeneity were explored by visual inspection of forest 
plots and quantified using the I2 statistic. Funnel plots were 
constructed where possible to assess for missing studies.

Data synthesis, measures of treatment effect and unit of 
analysis issues  We performed a random-effects model using 
Der Simonian and Laird weights to synthesise results. We 
used risk ratios as the effect measure of interest with cor-
responding 95% confidence intervals and displayed results 
using forest plots. Separate analyses were conducted for 
those achieving at least slight or moderate improvement in 
psychotic symptoms. Crossover studies were assessed for 
evidence of carryover effects. If carryover effects were not 
present, then both periods were covered; otherwise, stud-
ies were analysed as parallel studies by using results only 
from the first period. When both periods from a crossover 
study were included, Becker–Balagtas estimates were com-
puted and combined with odds ratios from parallel studies 
(Stedman et al. 2011). Meta-analysis and forest plots were 
conducted on Revman V 5.4 (Collaboration. 2020).

Sensitivity analyses  We performed different sensitivity anal-
yses to assess robustness of the primary methods by varying 
analysis by effect size, model type, crossover study periods 
and missing observation imputation.

Narrative review  Post hoc, we decided to provide a narrative 
review of informative reports which did not meet inclusion 
criteria for the meta-analysis. We included in this review any 
report of the use of any VMAT-2 inhibitor in at least one 
person with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis (or 
any accepted symptom of psychosis) and where any evalua-
tion of psychosis symptom severity was made.

Results

Meta‑analysis

The results of the search and selection process of studies 
are described in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 1). The 
search identified 4892 records of which five met the inclu-
sion criteria of our pre-defined PICOS. The characteristics 
of included studies are shown in Table 1. Included stud-
ies were from Europe and North America and spanned a 
52-year period. Only tetrabenazine studies were included in 
the meta-analysis as these were the only VMAT-2 inhibitor 
studies that fitted our inclusion criteria.

Fig. 1   Study selection (flow of studies)

There was a total of 173 participants (before dropouts) 
allocated to tetrabenazine, active comparator or placebo in 
the included studies. Four of the studies (108 participants) 
used placebo as a comparator and two (76 participants) used 
active comparators (chlorpromazine or reserpine). One of 
these studies (Remington et al. 2012) used tetrabenazine or 
placebo augmentation of clozapine (or other antipsychotics) 
whilst another (Smith 1960) used both an active (reserpine) 
and a placebo comparator. Study responder categorisation 
by CGI-I score is described in the method and in detail in 
Supplementary Table S2. No data were available on numbers 
of patients achieving remission. Dropouts were reported for 
two of the placebo comparison studies and one of the active 
studies; the total number of dropouts was 23.

Study characteristics of included studies

See Table 1.

Synthesis

Clinical outcomes were divided into two categories, slight 
improvement and moderate improvement, as described. 
For VMAT-2 inhibitors versus placebo (see Figs. 2 and 
3), there was a statistically significant advantage for the 

clinical outcome slight improvement (4 studies, 103 par-
ticipants) (risk ratio (RR) 1.77 (95% CI 1.03, 3.04) but no 
advantage for the clinical outcome moderate improvement 
(RR) 5.00 (95% CI 0.27, 95.33). Both syntheses had no sta-
tistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). Sixty-eight participants (31 
VMAT-2 inhibitors, 37 active comparators) were included 
in analysis comparing VMAT-2 inhibitors with an active 
comparator (see Figs. 4 and 5). For VMAT-2 inhibitors 
versus active comparator, see Figs. 4 and 5. There was 
no statistically significant difference for the clinical out-
come ‘slight improvement’ (RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.6, 1.81)) 
or ‘moderate improvement’ (RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.51, 2.42). 
Both syntheses had no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).
Sensitivity analyses were performed by repeating the 
analyses with imputed missing outcome data, OR as effect 
size measure and inclusion of both periods in the crosso-
ver study (Figures S1, S2). Results of all sensitivity analy-
ses were not significantly different to the original analyses 
except for inclusion of both periods of the crossover study 
which resulted in slightly larger effect (OR 3.45; 95% CI 
1.16, 8.47) compared with analysis from the first period only 
(OR 2.45 95% CI 1.03, 5.87). The direction of effects did not 
change in any of the analyses (see figure S2).

We could not assess for publication bias visually using 
funnel plots because of the small number of studies included.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias assessments are summarised in 
Tables 2 and 3. One study was assessed as being at a low risk 
of bias; three had some concerns, and one had a high risk of 
bias (elaboration of these concerns are detailed in Table S3). 
No studies were excluded by risk-of-bias.

Synthesis studies—adverse events

Adverse effects reported in studies included in the system-
atic review are described in Tables 4 and 5.

Narrative review studies excluded 
from the meta‑analysis

We identified 37 studies which did not meet our pre-defined 
criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis but were consid-
ered informative. Our inclusion criteria were as described 
in the ‘Methods’ section. These studies were published over 
a period of 64 years (1958–2022). Tardive dyskinesia was 
co-existent with schizophrenia in seven of the 37 studies 
(Hauser et al. 2017; Josiassen et al. 2017; Kalian et al. 1993; 
Khurram et al. 2021; Lindenmayer et al. 2022; Lindenmayer 
et al. 2017; Lindenmayer et al. 2019); seven studies were 

placebo-controlled (Ashcroft et al. 1961; Hauser et al. 2017; 
Lindenmayer et al. 2017; Lingjaerde 1963; Remington et al. 
2012; Smith 1960; Weckowicz et al. 1960). One study sub-
stituted reserpine (Brauchitsch) as a means of comparison. 
Treatment duration for tetrabenazine ranged from 2 days to 
22 months and daily doses from 10 to 600mg (most were in 
the range 100–200mg/day) and for valbenazine from 3 to 48 
weeks, at 25 to 80mg/day.

For many studies involving tetrabenazine (Table 6), it 
was somewhat unclear what prior or concurrent treatment 
had been or was given. Treatments reported as being pre-
scribed before or alongside tetrabenazine included antip-
sychotics, reserpine, ECT, iproniazid, imipramine, barbi-
turates, promethazine, insulin, lobotomy and ‘special drug 
therapy’. ECT was employed as concurrent co-therapy in at 
least three studies (Lustig 1961; Shimizu et al. 1962; Voe-
lkel and Dressler 1959). Two reports explicitly excluded

the co-prescription of all other treatments (Borenstein et al. 
1961; Heinze 1960).

Observations from these studies of tetrabenazine, most of 
which did not employ a contemporary comparator, suggested 

some antipsychotic action—most patients improved to some 
extent. In patients with schizophrenia or psychosis, tetra-
benazine was moderately or greatly effective in, broadly 
speaking,  three  quarters  of  those  treated.  In  one  report,

tetrabenazine was ineffective (Borenstein et al. 1961), and 
there was uncertain efficacy in a further four studies (Kam-
merer et al. 1962; Singer 1961; Stockhausen 1960c; Voelkel 
1958).

Symptoms  reported  to  have  responded  well  included 
aggression and violence, negativity, restlessness, paranoia, 
delusions  and  hallucinosis.  Conversely,  autism,  apathy, 
insomnia and lack of insight appear to have responded rela-
tively less well. In the study in which some of the tetrabena-
zine-treated patients were switched to placebo (Brauchitsch), 
14 of 23 relapsed after switching.

The most commonly reported adverse effects of tetra-
benazine were parkinsonism (tremor, dystonia, akathisia/
restlessness) and hypotension, both of which were noted 
to be dose-related. Depression was specifically mentioned 
as being observed in two studies and dysphoria (as part of 
‘tetrabenazine malaise’ syndrome) in one. Suicidal ideation 
was not mentioned in any report. Gastrointestinal effects 
such as nausea (with resulting anorexia), vomiting, diarrhoea 
and constipation were commonly reported. Somnolence was 
also usually seen. Other reported adverse effects included 
insomnia and sleep disturbance. One study described the 
(apparently then well-known phenomenon) of ‘tetrabenazine 
malaise’—a syndrome consisting of dysphoria, irritability, 

fatigue  and  lethargy.  More  than  one  study  reported  the 
occurrence of ‘neuroleptic syndrome’ but without further 
clarification or description. Weight gain was reported in 
some studies. Many trials reported the occurrence of either 
dry mouth or hypersalivation, some tachycardia and some 
bradycardia.

The  extent  of  participant  withdrawal  from  treatment 
because of adverse effects was not described in most studies. 
Completion rates were generally very high when reported, 
but, given the age of most of the studies, it is likely pos-
sible  that  participants  had  little  choice  but  to  continue 
even when there was poor tolerability. Indeed, whilst most 
patients received oral medication, some studies administered 
tetrabenazine covertly or parenterally in those patients who 
refused treatment.

The six most recent studies examined the use of val-
benazine in participants with both tardive dyskinesia and 
schizophrenia, but in each of these, the intention was to 
test efficacy in reducing the severity of TD (Table 7). The 
subjects included were chronically, but not acutely unwell 
and schizophrenia symptom severity change was not antici-
pated. Valbenazine was added to on-going antipsychotic 
treatment in five of these studies (Hauser et al. 2017; Josi-
assen et al. 2017; Khurram et al. 2021; Lindenmayer et al.

2017; Lindenmayer et al. 2019). Symptom ratings sug-
gested that participants’ psychiatric illness remained stable 
during valbenazine treatment with negligible, albeit favour-
able, changes in PANSS scores that were not statistically 
different from those with placebo. There was no evidence 
from  these  trials  that  valbenazine  had  any  worthwhile 
antipsychotic activity when added to existing antipsychotic 
treatment. However, this was not the objective of these 
studies; rather, they were safety studies designed in part 
to assess any potential detrimental adverse effects on par-
ticipants’ mental state. Two recent case studies described 
apparent antipsychotic effects of valbenazine in treatment-
resistant schizophrenia with TD: one for a patient not tak-
ing an antipsychotic (Lindenmayer et al. 2022) and the 
other taking clozapine (Khurram et al. 2021).

Valbenazine adverse effects in studies included in this 
review included somnolence, akathisia, dry mouth, urinary 
tract infection and headache, also arthralgia, headache, vom-
iting, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, urinary tract infection and 
weight gain. Data on suicidal ideation differed—one study 
recorded lower rates than with placebo whilst another found 
the converse effect (possibly explained in this latter study by 
a higher baseline level in the valbenazine group).

Studies of the effect of deutetrabenazine in TD (Anderson 
et al. 2017; Fernandez et al. 2017) examined mixed popula-
tions of individuals, only some of whom had psychotic ill-
ness. The effect of deutetrabenazine on psychotic symptoms 
was not formally evaluated. Adverse effect incidence did not 
differ from placebo.

Discussion

This meta-analysis tentatively suggests tetrabenazine has 
some antipsychotic efficacy, although its relative efficacy 
compared with dopamine antagonists could not be deter-
mined. Our narrative review (albeit of studies of dubious 
quality) also suggests that VMAT-2 inhibitors are effective 
as antipsychotics. The major obstacle in clarifying the exact 
utility of VMAT-2 inhibitors in psychosis is the near absence 
of trials which meet today’s methodological standards. The 
number of studies meeting our inclusion criteria was small, 
and the power to reveal differences between treatments was 
correspondingly low. In the narrative review, study qual-
ity was poor with limited or confused description of trial 
design, little or no description of blinding, no or limited 
statistical analysis and widespread use of unvalidated rat-
ing scales and other assessments. Although valbenazine and 
deutetrabenazine have been evaluated in modern, well-con-
ducted studies, these were studies of the treatment of tardive 
dyskinesia in patients with stable schizophrenia, rather than 
of their effect on schizophrenia per se. Changes in diagnostic

criteria over the last 60 or so years also hamper the drawing 
of clear conclusions.

Our synthesis found low rates of study heterogeneity. 
This is likely to be because of the small numbers of studies 
with similar effects sizes included in the meta-analysis. This 
result is a reflection, in some case, of the poor quality and 
reporting of the studies especially as four of the five studies 
included in the meta-analysis synthesis were from over 60 
years ago. Grading of recommendations assessment, devel-
opment and evaluation (GRADE) of the quality of evidence 
and strength of recommendation for the clinical outcome 
of tetrabenazine in schizophrenia and psychosis were infor-
mally assessed. For the assessment of quality of evidence for 
placebo-controlled studies slight or moderate improvement 
outcomes, two of the studies included in the meta-analysis 
were controlled trials although the randomisation was gen-
erally of poor quality and two studies were not randomised, 
risk of bias had some or high concerns, studies were rela-
tively consistent versus placebo, participants were from a 
large range of ages and from a mostly inpatient population 
(apart from the study of Remington et al. (2012) which was 
conducted in outpatients), confidence intervals were wide or 
very wide for the placebo analyses indicating some impreci-
sion, and formal analysis of publication bias was not pos-
sible given the small number of studies. Lastly, the inclusion 
of the study by Remington et al. may well diminish our effect 
size estimate as participants were largely resistant to stand-
ard treatments, including clozapine, and so were perhaps less 
likely to respond to VMAT-2 inhibitors.

The quality of evidence for this intervention, after exam-
ining the body of evidence, is low. The strength of recom-
mendation is weak because the difference between desir-
able and undesirable effects is difficult to determine given 
the lack of formal assessment of adverse effects for most 
studies; the quality of evidence is low; and, at current rates, 
medication costs are higher overall for tetrabenazine than for 
standard treatment with second generation antipsychotics 
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2023).

Adverse effects reported for tetrabenazine in included 
clinical trials as ‘very common’ were sedation, somnolence, 
parkinsonism and depression, whilst ‘common’ side effects 
were akathisia, anxiety and insomnia (Niemann and Janko-
vic 2019). Other adverse effects reported included dyspha-
gia, hyperprolactinaemia and psychotic exacerbation (Solmi 
et al. 2018). Deutetrabenazine is probably better tolerated 
than  tetrabenazine;  adverse  effects  of  deutetrabenazine, 
except for insomnia, are seen at a similar frequency to pla-
cebo (Niemann and Jankovic 2019; Solmi et al. 2018). Val-
benazine appears well tolerated with patient completion rates 
in clinical trials similar to placebo (Solmi et al. 2018). It can 
commonly cause somnolence, headache, fatigue, dry mouth, 
vomiting and akathisia (Niemann and Jankovic 2019). Psy-
chiatric side effects such as depression and suicidality have 
not been observed as being more common than with placebo 
in short- and longer-term clinical trials of patients with a sta-
ble mental state (Solmi et al. 2018). All VMAT-2 inhibitors 
are associated with QTc prolongation (Niemann and Janko-
vic 2019; Solmi et al. 2018). Tetrabenazine, at a dose of 

1 3Psychopharmacology (2024) 241:225–241

239

50mg, prolongs QTc by an average of 8 milliseconds (AOP 
Orphan Ltd. 2020), deutetrabenazine (at 24mg) by 4.5 milli-
seconds (Teva Pharmaceuticals USA 2017) and valbenazine 
(at 80mg) by 2.1 milliseconds (Thai-Cuarto et al. 2018).

There are several limitations to note. The age of many 
of the studies examined means that we cannot be certain of 
outcomes (scales used were outdated, varied and numer-
ous), diagnosis (little detail given; diagnostic criteria have 
long since changed) or even the morality of the studies (few 
details on patient consent provided). Even in our meta-anal-
ysis, we were forced to invent new somewhat subjective cat-
egories of response to account for the varied assessments 
used, and this inevitably affected our ability to interpret out-
comes. In many studies, it is likely that participants were 
treatment-resistant, and this too affected outcome interpreta-
tion. Lastly, the vast majority of studies of psychosis used 
tetrabenazine, and findings from those studies may not gen-
eralise to deutetrabenazine or valbenazine.

Our analysis might have been improved by the inclusion 
of studies of reserpine (another VMAT inhibitor), or at least 
the number of studies available for inclusion might have 
increased. However, we had concluded a priori that reser-
pine lacked the close similarity in mode of action shared by 
the three VMAT inhibitors ultimately included. Reserpine 
is an irreversible inhibitor of VMAT-1 and VMAT-2 both 
centrally and peripherally and so is likely to have a different 
efficacy and tolerability profile.

None of these drugs is currently licensed for psychosis. 
Tetrabenazine is licensed in the EU for the treatment of 
‘movement disorders due to Huntington’s chorea, hemibal-
lismus, senile chorea, and related neurological conditions’ 
(AOP Orphan Ltd. 2020). It is not licensed in the EU for the 
treatment of schizophrenia even though it was initially devel-
oped as an antipsychotic agent (Schreiber et al. 1999) and, 
as this review shows, improves symptoms of psychosis. In 
the USA, deutetrabenazine is approved for chorea associated 
with Huntington’s disease and valbenazine for the treatment 
of TD. It is perhaps relevant to note that VMAT-2 inhibitors 
are not drugs of choice for psychosis in Huntington’s disease 
(Anderson et al. 2018).

The  question  that  remains  concerns  the  potential  for 
VMAT-2  inhibitors  to  treat  psychosis  with  a  lower  the 
risk of tardive dyskinesia and without the risk of inducing 
post-synaptic receptor supersensitivity. VMAT-2 inhibitors 
appear to be effective antipsychotics and, given that they are 
used to treat TD, we might assume that they are unlikely to 
cause this condition (although DA antagonists also ‘treat’ 
(mask) TD if the dose of DA antagonist is increased (Glazer 
and Hafez 1990)). Likewise, we might assume that, hav-
ing little or no interaction with post-synaptic receptors, 
VMAT-2 inhibitors are unlikely to sensitise or upregulate 
these  receptors.  However,  denervation  of  pre-synaptic 

dopamine neurones does induce postsynaptic supersensi-
tivity (Kostrzewa and Brus 2016; Mandel et al. 1993). In 
addition to this, some VMAT-2 inhibitors do in fact have 
weak antagonist activity at post-synaptic dopamine recep-
tors. Animal studies show that tetrabenazine can displace the 
D2 ligand at 3H-spiperone (Login et al. 1982), and severe 
dystonic reactions to high dose tetrabenazine are thought to 
be caused by dopamine receptor antagonism (Burke et al. 
1985). Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine have little or no 
affinity for D2 receptors (Stahl 2018a), although a metabo-
lite of deutetrabenazine ([-]-α-deuterated dihydrotetrabena-
zine) has moderate activity at D2 and D3 receptors (Brar 
et al. 2023). This antagonist activity at dopamine receptors 
may explain the very occasional cases of tardive dyskinesia 
reported in long-term tetrabenazine use (we could find only 
two in the literature) (LeWitt 2013; Palermo et al. 2020). 
The overall risk of TD is probably minimal: a long-term 
study  of  448  people  taking  tetrabenazine  for  a  range  of 
movement disorders reported no cases of TD (Kenney et al. 
2007). Reserpine, too, is only very rarely causatively linked 
to TD (Uhrbrand and Faurbye 1960). Neither valbenazine 
nor deutetrabenazine have been associated with emergent 
TD.

We do not know the optimal dose of any VMAT-2 inhibi-
tor in treating psychosis, and we can therefore not be clear 
about the adverse effect burden of these drugs at that so far 
ill-defined dose. The dose-related nature of adverse effects 
offers the possibility of discovering doses that are both well 
tolerated and effective in psychosis.

We conclude that VMAT-2 inhibition deserves fur-
ther scrutiny as a potential method for achieving antip-
sychotic efficacy with a potential for reduced risk of 
TD or dopamine receptor supersensitivity. Ultimately, 
however, there are insufficient data to unequivocally 
support or refute the efficacy and safety of VMAT-2 
inhibitors to treat psychosis compared with placebo or 
active  comparators,  especially  newer  antipsychotics. 
Rigorous  controlled  trials  which  meet  modern  clini-
cal trials standards are needed to answer this question 
definitively. Whether or not such trials are conducted 
may depend on the clinical utility of emerging non-DA 
antagonist antipsychotics (Tsapakis et al. 2023) and risk 
of TD associated with their long-term use.
