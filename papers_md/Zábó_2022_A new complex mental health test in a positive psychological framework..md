According to the Maintainable Positive Mental Health Theory (MPMHT), the
main pillars of positive mental health are global well-being, efﬁcient coping
that enables an individual to maintain positive conditions and functioning,
savoring capacity, resilience, and dynamic self-regulation. This study presents
the validation of a new ﬁve-scale mental health test (MHT), the MHT that
operationalizes MPMHT. The methodology comprised two online cross-
sectional studies using self-report questionnaires. Participants in Study I
(n = 1,736; 448 males, 1,288 females; mean age 51.3 years; SD = 11.6 years)
ﬁlled in the MHT, the Flow, the Positive emotions, Engagement, Positive
Relationship, Meaning, Accomplishment Questionnaire (PERMA-Proﬁler), and
the Flourishing Scale. Participants in Study II (n = 1,083; 233 males, 847
females; mean age 33.9 years; SD = 12.2 years) ﬁlled in the MHT, the Shortened
Aspiration Index, the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, the WHO
Well-Being Index, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Purpose in Life Test,
and the Schema Questionnaire–Short Form. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
identiﬁed a ﬁve-factor structure with 17 items in Study I that was conﬁrmed
with excellent ﬁt measures in conﬁrmatory factor analysis in Study II. Both
studies indicated a high level of internal consistency (above 0.70). In each
subscale, a minimum part of 44% did not overlap with the set of the other
subscales. The content validity of the subscales was conﬁrmed by 10 tests
of mental health. We found a positive correlation of the self-regulation and
resilience subscales with age, while women showed a higher level of savoring
than men at all age levels. When Study I was replicated after 2 weeks and
again after 11 months, excellent internal consistency and good test–retest
correlation values of the MHT scales were found. The MHT can thus be
considered a reliable and valid measurement tool for mental health.

Introduction

The present study proposes a new theory of mental health,
the Maintainable Positive Mental Health Theory (MPMHT).
First, we present the theoretical framework of our new positive
mental health concept. In the next step, we provide an overview
of the models of well-being and mental health to date, and we
highlight the gaps between these and our proposed concept.
By presenting the ﬁve pillars of MPMHT, we aim to shed
light on how our new model
integrates and complement
the accumulated knowledge of the science of mental health
measures to date.

The conceptualization of maintainable
positive mental health theory

A central topic in positive psychology is the identiﬁcation of
indicators (symptoms) of mental health and the elaboration of
models to serve as a theoretical framework when developing a
diagnostic system in the realm of positive mental health. Such
a diagnostic system could provide a positive alternative to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM),
which has long been used in clinical practice. Given that, in
identifying mental health, the absence of mental disease is not
an adequate deﬁnition, it is necessary ﬁrst to develop a positive
concept of mental health.

We argue that the clariﬁcation of the concept of well-
being, the theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship
between well-being and mental health, and the rehabilitation
of classical interpretations of mental health can lead to an
integrative concept of the positive realm of mental health.
According to our MPMHT, the level of well-being will depend
both on the presence or absence of
the capacities and
psychological resources needed to ensure positive mental health,
and on the ability to use these capacities. Such a concept would
treat all theoretically and empirically identiﬁed components
of well-being as the set of symptoms of mental health that
reﬂect the presence and proper functioning of the psychological
capacities needed to ensure and maintain positive mental health.
This new approach is in line with the mental health
deﬁnition of the WHO (Galderisi et al., 2015). The World Health
Organization (WHO) deﬁnes mental health as “a dynamic
state of internal equilibrium which enables individuals to use
their abilities in harmony with universal values of society.
Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize, express
and modulate one’s own emotions, as well as empathize with
others; ﬂexibility and ability to cope with adverse life events and
function in social roles; and harmonious relationship between
body and mind represent important components of mental
health which contribute, to varying degrees, to the state of
internal equilibrium” (Galderisi et al., 2015). In other words, the
components of well-being are not the only agents that contribute

to positive mental health; resilience, accommodation to changes,
and the development of eﬃcient coping capacities (savoring and
the ability to establish positive states and handle negative states)
are also major contributors.

Maintainable positive mental health theory endorses the
view of what Keyes (2007; Keyes et al., 2020) emphasized,
which is that mental disease and mental health are two separate
dimensions that must be treated as independent continuums.
At one pole of mental disease are intensive and frequent
occurrences of mental disorders, while at the opposite pole are
symptoms of mental disorders that are rarely present or that
take insigniﬁcant forms. In the case of mental health, one pole
represents the rare occurrence and weak appearance of mental
health indicators, while the opposite pole represents the high
frequency of positive mental health indicators.

An overview of the concepts and the
dimensions of previous models of
well-being and mental health

Just as mental disorders comprise a theoretically based
and empirically demonstrable set of symptoms, positive mental
health can also be characterized by a clearly identiﬁable set of
symptoms that can be framed within an appropriate theory and
demonstrated and studied empirically.

Mental health as multidimensional well-being

According to one approach in positive psychology, mental
health can essentially be deﬁned according to the pillars
of multidimensional well-being. Ryﬀ’s
(1995) multifactor
psychological well-being scale integrates the six components
of overall well-functioning but does not cover hedonic well-
being which is also an important component of mental health.
Keyes (2007) 13-dimensions mental health questionnaire does
not comprehensively include all the important capabilities
(e.g., savoring, self-regulation, resilience) and components
(e.g., spiritual well-being) which are essential
in achieving
a high degree of positive mental health. Diener’s and his
colleagues’ ﬂourishing scale (Diener et al., 2009) only measures
psychological well-being, SPANE (Diener et al., 2009) only
assess emotions, and Positive emotions, Engagement, positive
Relationship, Meaning, Accomplishment (PERMA) (Seligman,
2018) describes the factors of well-being, but none of them cover
the competencies and abilities that play an irreplaceable role
in mental health.

Mental health as mirror opposite to the
symptoms of mental disorders

An alternative approach is to argue that mental health
is characterized by symptoms that are the mirror opposite
and So, 2013; Caprara
of mental disorders
et al., 2019; Oláh, 2019). For example, the Positivity Scale

(Caprara et al., 2019; Oláh, 2019) measures a combination of
high self-esteem, life satisfaction, and optimism as suggested
sources of a syndrome of optimal functioning. These models
do not include any ability or capacity to guarantee mental
health, only the resilience appears in Huppert and So’s (2013)
ﬂourishing questionnaire.

this kind, well-being is the consequence, or the result, of mental
health and is due to resilient accommodation, capacities that
establish a physical, psychological, and environmental balance,
and well-functioning health maintenance skills. The PISI (Oláh,
2005) includes skills for self-eﬃcacy and self-regulation, but
does not cover global well-being, savoring, and resilience.

Mental health as ﬂourishing

Balanced models of mental health

Although these approaches diﬀer, 70% of their components,
from which the multidimensional domain of mental health is
constructed, are more or less identical. They share the common
feature of integrating the hedonic and eudemonic approaches
in the metaphoric concept of ﬂourishing, which can be
characterized by the simultaneous presence of positive feelings
and good psychological functioning. Flourishing, as an umbrella
concept for the components of well-being, is the positive pole or
uppermost zone on the mental health continuum.

Mental health as “hedo-eudemonic” well-being
“Flourishing” is also used in the names of measurement
tools that operationalize “hedo-eudemonic” models of well-
being, for example Global Well-being Scale (Oláh, 2019; Oláh
et al., 2020), Positive Mental Health Scale (Lukat et al., 2016)
and Positive Functioning Inventory (Joseph and Maltby, 2014)
capture only the hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of mental
health. Measurement tools (or diagnostic scales) like Diener’s
and his colleagues’ ﬂourishing scale (Diener et al., 2009),
SPANE (Diener et al., 2009) and a version of PERMA extended
with overall well-being, negative emotions,
loneliness, and
physical health components (PERMA Proﬁler, Butler and Kern,
2016) encompass the major components of well-being and the
symptoms of positive mental health in terms of their targets and
measured content. Nevertheless, these hedo-eudemonic models
do not cover all aspects of well-being (e.g., self-acceptance,
spiritual well-being). In a recent review paper that outlined
empirical studies covering 99 well-being measurement tools, 196
diﬀerent components of well-being were identiﬁed (Linton et al.,
2016).

Classical models of mental health

In the so-called classical models of mental health (Jahoda,
1958; Vaillant, 2003; Vaillant G. E., 2012) the focus is on
personality traits that guarantee eﬃcient self-regulation and
ﬂexible accommodation, and on psychological resources that
foster fulﬁllment. For instance, the use of the character strengths
that leads to human ﬂourishing (Mayerson, 2020) are only
predictors of the optimal mental health. The presence of
personality traits resources is also regarded as a primary factor
in positive mental health in salutogenic theory (Antonovsky,
1991), according to which mental health is maintained
by eﬃcient stress management, resilient self-regulation, and
ﬂexible accommodation to the continuously changing world
(Block and Kremen, 1996; Block and Block, 2014). In theories of

According to a recent model, the life balance and harmony
model, the key to well-being is to maintain balance and
harmony in all areas of human functioning (Lomas, 2021).
In the equilibrium theory, a key factor in well-being is the
maintenance of a relative balance between challenges and
available resources, with an emphasis on the capacities needed
to handle situations that are out of balance (Dodge et al., 2012).
Apart from omitting some important elements of well-being,
these models do not imply the abilities and capacities. Balance,
harmony, and equilibrium could be a principle in the dynamic
interaction of the pillars of mental health. Also, according to
the capability theory of Amartya Sen (see, e.g., Walker and
Unterhalter, 2007), capacities can explain the establishment and
maintenance of all possible aspects of well-being. The focus of
the model deviates from the essence of positive mental health
and this approach can be a potential predictor of positive
mental health. Sustainable Mental Health Model (Bohlmeijer
and Westerhof, 2021) integrates dysfunctional and functional
perspectives of mental health.

Mental health as the sum of the components of
well-being

In earlier tools for the measurement of the realm of positive
mental health (Bech et al., 1996; Diener et al., 2009; Lamers
et al., 2011; Huppert and So, 2013; Butler and Kern, 2016;
Lukat et al., 2016; Oláh et al., 2020), the focus has been
primarily on the components of well-being, without taking into
account all the aspects of mental health referred to in the WHO
deﬁnition and in classical theories of mental health. Another
feature of these tools is that they cannot be considered as the
operationalization of a comprehensive mental health model. It
is also important to note that the number of published measures
of well-being and mental health has decreased signiﬁcantly since
2010 (Lomas, 2021).

Extracting the pillars of Maintainable
Positive Mental Health Theory

The holistic concept of positive mental health must integrate
the realm of well-being models, the psychological resources and
capacities needed to ensure and maintain positive mental health,
and the skills that guarantee their eﬃcient functioning.

Our main goal

is to develop a construct of mental
health that diﬀers both theoretically and empirically from

other theoretically deﬁned constructs of multidimensional

equivalent or the top-zone of mental health. We assert
than well-being,
that mental health is a broader concept
justiﬁed by research based on the classical theories of mental
health (Antonovsky, 1991; Vaillant G., 2012) and on our
own studies (Oláh, 2021; Nagy et al., 2021), which is also
consistent with the mental health deﬁnition of the WHO
(Galderisi et al., 2015). However, we do not encounter in
the literature a measurement tool of mental health that could
be considered an operationalizing construct of
the WHO
description of mental health, and we do not know also
a mental health model that would integrate suggestions of
scientiﬁc approaches for the pillars of positive mental health
from classical models up to most recent theories of positive
psychology. Keyes’ concept of mental health, the Flourishing
construct of Diener and Huppert, and the PERMA model of
Seligman all construe positive mental health based on well-
being components. Building on classical and recent ideas of
positive mental health, in the concept of Maintainable Positive
Mental Health we would like to clarify that mental health
is a function of individual capacities (resilience, creative and
executive competencies) by means of which the individual can
work up an equilibrium with the outside world, promoting
his/her development, creating a steady state for within-person
functioning (self-regulation), and an equilibrium of positive
and negative emotions (coping, savoring). The existence and
eﬃcient functioning of these elements may lead to the global
well-being, a multifaceted component of positive mental health.
Summarizing,
in our suggested deﬁnition mental health is
a high level of global well-being which goes-together with
psychological, social, and spiritual well-functioning, resilience,
eﬃcient creative and executive functioning, coping and
savoring capacities, all pillars insuring the maintainability
of mental health.

The ﬁrst pillar

in our new model

is Global Well-
being. MPMHT integrates existing well-being theories and the
identiﬁed dimensions of well-being in the global well-being
pillar. Global Well-being means multi-component subjective
well-being encompassing emotional states and psychological
functioning in the emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual
areas in life (Oláh and Kapitány-Fövény, 2012; Oláh, 2016; Oláh
et al., 2020). Table 1 indicates the pillars of Global-Well-being
which goes hand in hand with savoring capacity, creative and
executive eﬃciency, self-regulation, and resilience.

The second pillar is Savoring which refers to the ability and
capacity which allows individuals to mentally mobilize their
joyful memories and experiences to generate mental well-being,
reliving them in the present and, furthermore, extending them
to future events (Bryant and Veroﬀ, 2007). Savoring is also
a prerequisite for MPMHT because it is an ability that can
guarantee the achievement and maintenance of positive mental
health (Bryan et al., 2022).

the present study aimed to operationalize the MPMHT
by preparing the validation of
the ﬁve-scale MHT on a
Hungarian population.

Overview of the present studies

Two studies were carried out to prepare and validate
the ﬁnal version of the MHT. The aim of Study I was to
ﬁnalize with EFA a set of items for which the ﬁve-dimensional
statistical model of the MHT yields appropriate ﬁt indices.
The main aim of Study II was to conﬁrm the model on a
new, independent sample. After this veriﬁcation of structural
validity, both studies were used to check the substantive
validity of the MHT.

Study I exploratory factor analysis

Method

Participants and procedure

Participants completed a 64-item online questionnaire
posted from mid-January 2020 for 2 months in Facebook groups
that are frequently visited by adults of diﬀerent ages1 and with
diﬀerent occupations and interests. Ethical approval for the
study was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the
local university (permission number: 2019/61). Participation
was voluntary and anonymous. Informed consent was obtained
but no compensation was given. The valid study sample
consisted of 1,736 adult persons (448 males and 1,288 females).
Among them 1,540 persons were residents of Hungary,
and 196 persons were residents of other countries who
ﬁlled in the Hungarian-language online questionnaire2. The
sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are summarized
in Table 2.

Based on the data in Table 2, we can conclude that the
Study I sample was suﬃciently heterogeneous for us to draw
valid conclusions about the MHT from the sample. Although
the majority of participants in the sample were women (74.2%),
the number of men (448) was also suﬃciently large to ensure
representative results.

In terms of age, the majority of the participants (38.9%)
were middle-aged (36–50 years), although the number of people
over 65 (198) was also substantial. There was a strikingly low
proportion of young people aged between 18 and 25 (1.9%, 33
people). The sample was also balanced according to the type of

city where participants lived, since the number of respondents
in all categories was over 300. More than 98% of the participants
had a high-school certiﬁcate. Regarding marital status, 50.1% of
the participants were married, while a small proportion (5.0%)
were widowed. The majority of the participants (57.8%) were
employed, although there was also a signiﬁcant proportion of
retired participants (20.7%) and entrepreneurs (14.5%). The
vast majority of participants in the sample (74.6%) considered
their ﬁnancial situation to be average, although there was also
a non-negligible proportion of wealthy people (17.5%). Only a
small proportion of respondents declared themselves to be poor
(2.0%) or rich (0.6%).

Measures

Nine of the questions in the questionnaire referred to
sociodemographic data (gender, age, place of residence, etc.,
see Table 2). One question (Positive experience%) assessed
the proportion of the respondent’s recent positive experiences
(1 = 10% positive experiences and 90% negative experiences . . .
9 = 90% positive experiences and 10% negative experiences).
Four special questions, scored using a six-point Likert scale,
assessed the physical and mental condition of the respondent:
(1) Physical condition (My physical state is: 1 = very bad,
2 = bad, 3 = acceptable, 4 = good, 5 = very good, 6 = excellent);
(2) General mental state (My general mental state is: 1 = very
bad, 2 = bad, 3 = acceptable, 4 = good, 5 = very good,
6 = excellent); (3) General health condition (I am satisﬁed with
my general health: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = moderately disagree,
3 = slightly disagree, 4 = slightly agree, 5 = moderately agree,
6 = strongly agree); and (4) Physical strength (I feel strong and
physically robust: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = moderately disagree,
3 = slightly disagree, 4 = slightly agree, 5 = moderately agree,
6 = strongly agree).

Mental health test

The basic concept was to develop a mental health test
(MHT) in the form of a short questionnaire comprising no
more than 20 items to obtain a comprehensive picture of mental
health according to MPMHT. The items on the ﬁve scales were
selected based on the following arguments, considering that
the item that most strongly represents the given measuring
instrument should be selected (Oláh et al., 2018):

(1) Well-being. This scale is based on the following three
areas of subjective well-being: (i) the ratio of positive and
negative experiences (Fredrickson, 2009; Appendix, item
1); (ii) the subjective quality of the state of mental health
and well-being (Lyubomirsky, 2010; Appendix, item 14);
and (iii) the global level of happiness (Huppert and So,
2013; Appendix, item 18).

(2) Savoring. For this scale, three items were selected from the
short Hungarian version of the Savoring Beliefs Inventory
(Nagy et al., 2021) based on the criteria that they be

comprehensive, simple, and highly representative of the
total score of the questionnaire. The three items selected for
the MHT according to these principles (Appendix, items 3,
10, and 12) explained the total score of the 10-item short
Hungarian form of the Savoring Beliefs Inventory with a
variance ratio of R2 = 0.81 based on annual data from the
Happiness Map of Hungary between 2015 and 2019, with a
sample size of 8,0353.

are scored according to six-point Likert scales (1 = does not
agree at all, 6 = agrees completely). The Well-being, Savoring,
and Creative and Executive Eﬃciency subscales include positive
items only. The Self-regulation subscale contains negative
items only. The Resilience subscale consists of two positive
and two negative items. The ﬁnal scores are obtained by
averaging the scores obtained for the items in each of
the ﬁve scales.

(3) Creative and Executive Eﬃciency. This scale consists of
four items (Appendix, items 5, 7, 15, and 17) taken from
the 16-item short version of the Psychological Immune
Competence Inventory (PICI; see Oláh, 2005), using the
same names. A ﬁfth item, which was also considered an
important component of creative and executive eﬃciency,
was added from the 80-item version of the PICI (Oláh,
2005) (Appendix, item 9).

(4) Self-regulation. For this scale, three items were selected
from the self-regulation subscale of the 16-item short
version of the PICI (Oláh, 2005).

(5) Resilience. Items for this scale in the ﬁrst version of the
MHT (Oláh et al., 2018) were selected from the Resilience
subscale of the 16-item short version of the PICI (Oláh,
2005). Taking into account the many diﬀerent scales of
resilience (Block and Kremen, 1996; Connor and Davidson,
2003; Smith et al., 2008; Windle et al., 2011), we were
looking for one that is internationally recognized and
that has already been translated into several languages.
Applying linear regression analysis, four items (Appendix,
items 4, 6, 11, and 13) of the six-item Brief Resilience
Scale (Smith et al., 2008) explained the total score of
the six-item test with a variance ratio of R2 = 0.95
on a sub-sample (n = 8,035) of the above-mentioned
Happiness Map of Hungary.

Based on the above considerations, the MHT questionnaire
comprises 18 items (see Appendix) divided into ﬁve scales of
three, three, ﬁve, three, and four items respectively. The items

(immersion in activity, constant interest) was examined based
on Magyaródi et al. (2013, 2014), using the following item: “If
something really interests me, I am able to do it with pleasure
and in depth, even in diﬃcult situations.”

Positive emotions, engagement, positive relationship,
meaning, accomplishment questionnaire
(PERMA-proﬁler)

The PERMA model was developed by Seligman (2018),
building on his further developed earlier concept of authentic
happiness. The components of the ﬁve-pillar model reinforce
one another in creating and maintaining a state of well-being.
The 23-item PERMA-Proﬁler (Butler and Kern, 2016) measures
Seligman’s model using a 10-point Likert scale (0 = never/not
at all/terrible; 10 = always/completely/excellent). In the case
of 15 items, the ﬁve basic pillars are measured using three
questions each; eight items, comprising three questions each, are
used to assess negative emotions (e.g., “How often do you feel
anxious?”) and health (e.g., “How would you rate your health?”).
Among the 23 items one item is used to measure happiness (“All
in all, how happy would you say you are?”) and one item is
used to measure loneliness (“How lonely do you feel in your
daily life?”). In terms of the scales that represent the ﬁve basic
pillars, the Positive Emotion scale focuses on the frequency
of experiencing positive emotions (e.g., “How often do you
feel joyful?”). The Engagement scale refers to the frequency of
experiencing ﬂow and the absorption of cognitive and emotional
resources (e.g., “How often do you become absorbed in what
you are doing?”). The Meaning scale examines the tendency to

set meaningful goals, seek meaning, and serve meaningful goals
that transcend the self (e.g., “In general, to what extent do you
lead a purposeful and meaningful life?”). The Accomplishment
scale provides information about the extent to which one’s own
successful performance and the joy of experiencing competence
contribute to increasing well-being in an individual’s life (e.g.,
“How often do you
achieve the important goals you have set for yourself?”). The
Relationships scale measures the extent to which it is true for
an individual’s life that happiness, love, and good relationships
with others are the sine qua non of well-being (e.g., “To what
extent do you feel loved?”). All the scales in the Hungarian
version of the PERMA-Proﬁler (Oláh, 2016) showed reliable

tests all had excellent
values of above 0.74.

Results

The internal consistency of all the scales in the MHT
was computed with ROPstat (Vargha et al., 2015). Table 3
shows that the Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega values
mostly being above 0.80 (DeVellis, 2016; Barbera et al., 2020)
were adequate for all scales. One possible way to improve
the internal consistency would be to drop one item from the

Resilience subscale (item 6: “Stressful events are diﬃcult to
bear”). Calculating pairwise correlations of the scales, Table 4
shows that most of
the scales have a moderate positive
relationship with Pearson’s r of between 0.35 and 0.62 with
two exceptions. This is consistent with the theory that diﬀerent
components of mental health are positively related to one
another (Ryﬀ and Marshall, 1999).

In the next step we performed a ﬁve-factor EFA using Mplus
(Muthén and Muthén, 1998–2011) to verify that the 18 items
of the MHT form ﬁve factors according to the constructed
subscales. Due to the strongly non-normal distribution of
the scales (see the last two columns of Table 4), a robust
maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) (Maydeu-Olivares, 2017)
was applied with Geomin oblique rotation, allowing correlating
factors (Hattori et al., 2017). The rotated factor loading matrix
is shown in Table 5. In this table, the item indices (i1, i2, etc.)
correspond to the item indices in the Appendix, supplemented
by the abbreviation of their scale (i1W, i2SR, etc.). Based on
Table 5, we can conclude that each item in the Well-being,
Savoring, Creative and Executive Eﬃciency and Self-regulation
scales forms a separate factor with loadings above 0.60, with two
exceptions (i12S: 0.40; i9C: 0.41). In the case of the Resilience
scale, one of the four items loaded to Self-regulation scale (i6R:
0.50) and another item (i13R) loaded to the Self-regulation scale
as well with a 0.38 loading (see Table 3).

Method

Participants and procedure

Participants completed a 179-item online questionnaire.
The questionnaire was published in various groups on
Facebook, as the most commonly used social platform. The
responses were obtained from the widest possible variations of
the groups according to place of residence (e.g., people living
in the 2nd district of Budapest, “What I heard in Debrecen,”
“What I saw in Sopron”); topic (e.g., nature conservationists,
vegetarians); sports (e.g., kayak-canoeists, training plans and
experiences, novice runners); profession (e.g.,
job seekers,
social workers); spirituality (e.g., atheist–Christian discussion
group, daily spiritual quotes, Christian youth); higher education
(e.g.,
law students, teachers); and others (e.g., mathematics
for everyone, motivation for everyday life) in order to reach
participants from as many social strata as possible.

Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Research
Ethics Committee of the local university (permission number:
70/2019/P/ET/2). Participation was voluntary and anonymous.
Informed consent was obtained but no compensation was
given. The sample, selected by random sampling, consisted of
1,083 individuals (233 males, 847 females, and three individuals

who did not disclose their gender) who completed the 179-
item questionnaire online between December 2019 and March
2020. Their sociodemographic characteristics are summarized
in Table 6.

Based on the data presented in Table 6, it can be concluded
that the Study II sample was slightly less heterogeneous and
of slightly diﬀerent composition than the Study I sample.
The majority of the participants in the sample were female
(78.2%). On the other hand, there were signiﬁcantly more
young people below the age of 25 (33.1% vs. 2%), while
the proportion of those over the age of 50 (1.2% vs. 52.7%)
was substantially lower. There were more university students
(22.2%) and fewer retired participants (1.4%, as part of the
“other” category). As in Study I, the vast majority of participants
in Study II (67.1%) also considered their ﬁnancial status to be
average. In terms of religiosity, 68.9% declared themselves to be

religious in their own way and 31.1% declared themselves to be
atheists, while 3.4% said that religiosity was important (or very
important) to them.

Measures

Eight of the questions from among all the items were related
to sociodemographic data (gender, age, etc., see Table 6). Three
questions were speciﬁcally related to the subject’s physical and
mental well-being: (1) Subjective health status (“Overall, how
would you rate your health status?” with response options:
1 = very bad, 2 = bad, 3 = average, 4 = good, 5 = excellent);
(2) Subjective satisfaction with life (“Overall, how satisﬁed are
you with your daily life?” with endpoints for response options:
1 = completely dissatisﬁed and 10 = completely satisﬁed); and
(3) Subjective happiness (“All in all, how happy would you say
you are?” with endpoints for response options: 1 = completely
unhappy and 10 = completely happy).

To summarize, with one exception (the two-item Health
subscale of the Shortened Aspiration Index), the scales used in
the above tests all had excellent reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha
values of above 0.74.

Results

Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed with
several settings with Mplus (Muthén and Muthén, 1998–2011).
The most important results are summarized in Table 7. Row 1
of Table 7 shows the adequacy measures of the EFA model of the
MHT. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)
(Steiger and Lind, 1980) and standardized root mean square
residual (SRMR) (Hu and Bentler, 1999) are absolute ﬁt indices
which indicate acceptable ﬁt if their values are less than 0.06 and
0.05 respectively (Maydeu-Olivares et al., 2019). The model has
an acceptable ﬁt since the values of the two indicators do not
exceed 0.06 (except in one case (RMSEA of Model 1: 0.06), and
this is true for all models in Table 7. In the case of RMSEA,
the theoretical value should optimally not exceed 0.05 (Steiger
and Lind, 1980). A 90% interval estimate is included in the
CI90(RMSEA) column. This is good if the value 0.05 is included
in it (Browne and Cudeck, 1993). The p-value of the test that
the theoretical value is not greater than 0.05 can be found in the
pClose column. This is good if it is greater than 0.05, or, in other
words, if it is not signiﬁcant. Adequacy indicators also include
two relative ﬁt indicators, the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) and
the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). A good ﬁt is indicated when the

***p < 0.001. All analyses refer to tests done without item i6R. In case of Model 3 and Model 4, we allow the residual terms of items i3S and i10S to correlate within the Savoring scale, and
we allow the residual term of item i9C to correlate with latent factor 1 (Well-being).

CFI value reaches 0.95 and the TLI value is not much lower, but
deﬁnitely higher than 0.90 (Hu and Bentler, 1999). The AIC and
BIC are measures of comparative ﬁt and their lower values are
favorable (Kenny, 2015).

In CFA we chose a robust method for model ﬁtting
(maximum likelihood mean variance, MLMV), which, in the
case of CFA, provides a good alternative to the traditional
ML method requiring multidimensional normality (Gao et al.,
2020). The CFA results testing Model 2 indicated a high
modiﬁcation index (79) for the residual correlation between
i3S and i10S, and also a high modiﬁcation index (102) for
the correlation between i9C and latent factor 1 (Well-being).
The latter is in accordance with the corresponding factor
in EFA (see Table 5). In
loading exceeding the 0.40 level
order to improve model ﬁt, we built these correlations in
the subsequent CFA models. The improvement is justiﬁed by
the more favorable ﬁt values in the Model 3 row (RMSEA,
SRMR < 0.05; pClose, CFI, TLI > 0.95), having also decreasing
AIC and BIC values.

A very important result is that testing our ﬁve-factor
model on an independent Study II sample, the values obtained
indicated good ﬁt for all indicators. Furthermore, when we
built in the model a second order factor of the ﬁve scales
(see row 4), we still had good ﬁt values. To summarize,
the ﬁve-factor model of the 17-item MHT with the original
ﬁve scales was conﬁrmed by good ﬁt indices. This result
was achieved by allowing one within factor correlation of
the residuals (between i3S and i10S), and one cross-loading
(between i9C and the latent factor of Well-being) in the
ﬁnal model. In Table 7 all chi-square tests reject the null
hypothesis of exact ﬁt, in large samples, like in ours, this often
occurs even when the postulated model is only trivially false
(Shi et al., 2018).

The internal consistency of all the scales in the MHT was
computed with ROPstat (Vargha et al., 2015). Table 8 indicates
that the Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega values mostly
being above 0.71 (DeVellis, 2016; Barbera et al., 2020) were
adequate for all scales.

In order to check the discriminant validity of the MHT

External and content validity of the
mental health test

The content validity of the MHT and the characteristics
of the ﬁve scales were analyzed with Pearson’s correlations,
using diﬀerent mental health measurement variables from the
two studies. Tables 9, 10 indicate these results. Regarding
the classiﬁcation of the strength of the Pearson’s correlations,
we followed Cohen’s convention (Cohen, 1988, pp. 79–80).
According to this, a correlation is said to be weak if the absolute
value of r does not reach 0.1, and to be medium, strong,
or very strong if the absolute value of r reaches 0.3, 0.5, or
0.7 respectively.

traditional

Based on correlations exceeding 0.70 in Tables 9, 10, we
can conclude that the three-item Well-being scale measures
something very similar as other,
tests of well-
being such as Diener’s Flourishing Scale, the PERMA-Proﬁler,
the WHO Well-Being Index, and the Satisfaction with Life
Scale. The Positive Emotions subscale of the PERMA-Proﬁler
explains the biggest proportion of variance among the subscales.
In accordance with the construct content of the Well-being
scale, strong correlations were found with the meaning in
life variable (Purpose in Life Test) and the Meaning subscale
of the PERMA-Proﬁler, which conﬁrms the signiﬁcant role
of experiencing the meaning of life in terms of well-being.

validity of the MHT’s Well-being scale. Convergent validity is
indicated by negative emotional states (the Negative Emotions
subscale of the PERMA-Proﬁler, and the “nervous” and “tense”
questionnaire items), symptoms of depression (the short form
of the Beck Depression Inventory), and maladaptive schemas
(Young’s Schema Questionnaire). The signiﬁcant explanatory
power of ﬂow and physical well-being, as well as general health,
can also be interpreted as strengthening convergent validity
(Carlson and Herdman, 2012).

Regarding the Savoring scale, convergent validity is
evidenced by correlations above 0.50 with variables from other
MHTs (Diener’s Flourishing Scale, the PERMA-Proﬁler, Flow,
the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Purpose in Life Test).
Convergent validity is further enhanced by moderate, negative
correlations with negative emotional states (Beck Depression
Inventory and the Negative Emotions subscale of the PERMA-
Proﬁler).

The strong correlation results for the Creative and Executive
Eﬃciency scale with other tests and special questionnaire items
of mental health (Diener’s Flourishing Scale, the PERMA-
Proﬁler, the ﬂow items, and the Purpose in Life Test) indicate
the fulﬁllment of convergent validity.

Results with sociodemographic
indicators

An examination of the relationship between the ﬁve scales
of the MHT discussed in our study and the sociodemographic
indicators yields many signiﬁcant results, although these
relationships are typically rather weak. For example, for 92% of
the correlations examined, Spearman’s r is < | 0.20|. A detailed
description of these results is beyond the scope of the present
paper; thus, we refer to the most striking results only.

The eﬀect of gender and age was analyzed in the pooled
sample of the two studies for individuals with valid gender
values (n = 2,817). Gender means diﬀered signiﬁcantly in the
case of the Savoring scale (males: M = 4.33; females: M = 4.66),
with standard deviations around 1. The gender diﬀerence
(females giving higher values) was signiﬁcant in the two-sample
t-test [t(2814) = 6.90; p < 0.001], in the Mann–Whitney U test
(Z = 6.50; p < 0.001), and in the robust Brunner-Munzel rank
test [BM(1128) = 6.58; p < 0.001]. Although the Cohen’s d
(d = 0.30, 95% CI [0.216, 0.391]) and eta-squared (η2 = 0.017)
eﬀect size measures were rather weak, they were already at
an interpretable level. Figure 1 shows that the dominance of
females was manifested in all age categories.

In the same sample, a more signiﬁcant eﬀect of age was
observed for the Self-regulation (see Figure 1) and Resilience.
Using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the main
eﬀect of age was signiﬁcant for both scales: Self-regulation:
F(4; 2806) = 53.24; p < 0.001; Resilience: F(4; 2806) = 32.91;
p < 0.001, with partial eta-squared eﬀect size values of 0.07
for the former and 0.05 for the latter, apparently stronger
than the eﬀect of gender. In the case of self-regulation, the
gender × age interaction eﬀect was also signiﬁcant [F(4;
2806) = 4.38; p = 0.002]. Figure 2 indicates that it was due to
the fact that the level of self-regulation increased linearly with
women’s age, while in the case of men it showed an increasing
trend only in the 26–50 age range. This was also conﬁrmed
by the fact that Spearman’s r between self-regulation and age
was signiﬁcantly lower in case of men (r = 0.27, p < 0.001)
than in case of women (r = 0.38, p < 0.001). The curvilinear
eﬀect of Age on Self-Regulation in the male subsample (n = 681)
was examined also with polynomial regression analysis, where
powers of standardized age were entered consecutively into the
regression model up to power 5. The last power that signiﬁcantly
increased the R-square value was the cubic term [R2 = 0.08;
R2_increase = 0.01; Fincrease(1,677) = 9.13, p = 0.003]. This
cubic curvilinear eﬀect of Age on Self-Regulation in the male
subsample is, however, negligible relative to the substantially
stronger linear relationship that can be seen in the female
subsample (n = 2,135), where no power increased signiﬁcantly
the linear eﬀect of age (R2 = 0.14).

The eﬀects of the other sociodemographic variables were
assessed separately in the two studies. Regarding level of

the strongest positive correlation was with the
education,
Creative and Executive Eﬃciency scale (r = 0.16 in sample I,
r = 0.13 in sample II, p < 0.001). Subjective ﬁnancial status
showed a stronger relationship in both samples. In Sample
I, subjective ﬁnancial status was positively related to Well-
being, with r = 0.21, and to Creative and Executive Eﬃciency,
with r = 0.12 (both signiﬁcant at p < 0.001 level). However,
in Sample II subjective ﬁnancial status also had a signiﬁcant
positive relationship with Well-being (r = 0.23), Resilience
(r = 0.20), and Creative and Executive Eﬃciency (r = 0.17),
all at p < 0.001 level. A slightly stronger but similar pattern
was obtained in this sample for correlations with monthly
income (Well-being: r = 0.17, Resilience: r = 0.27, Creative
and Executive Eﬃciency: r = 0.25). Financial status therefore

is positively related to well-being, resilience, and coping with
diﬃcult situations. Finally, the importance of religion in Sample
II had a weak but signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) positive relationship
with the Well-being (r = 0.14) and Savoring (r = 0.13) scales.

us to compute test–retest correlations to measure the temporal
stability of the MHT scales. In major categories of ﬁnancial
status (below average, average, above average) the diﬀerences
among Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 percentages were never
greater than 2 percentage points. Regarding age the Time 1 mean
of Time 2 retention sample (52.3 years) diﬀered only slightly
from that of Time 1 sample (51.3 years). Those Ss ﬁlling in the
questionnaires both at Time 1 and at Time 3 were slightly older
at Time 1 than those who ﬁlled in the questionnaires only at
Time 1 (54.4 vs. 50.6 years; t(1734) = 5.18, p < 0.001; Cohen’s
d = 0.33, 95% CI [0.203, 0.451]).

At Time 2, we had 648 usable cases and Cronbach’s alpha
values varied between 0.79 and 0.87, whereas at Time 3 we had
304 usable cases and Cronbach’s alpha values varied between
0.79 and 0.90. It can therefore be concluded that the internal
consistency of the MHT scales shows excellent temporal stability
for all scales at Time 2 and Time 3. The test–retest correlations
between the Time 1 and Time 2, and between the Time 1 and
Time3 MHT scale values are summarized in Table 11 and reﬂect
an excellent level of temporal stability for all scales at Time 2, and
a good level of temporal stability at Time 3, almost 1 year after
the initial investigation.

The objective of

to conceptualize
Maintainable Positive Mental Health Theory and to develop
and validate the MHT that operationalizes this model. The
theoretical basis of the MPMHT is a mental health construct in
line with the mental health deﬁnition of the WHO (Galderisi
et al., 2015). MPMHT emphasizes that the measurement of
mental health must go beyond operationalizations that deﬁne
the concept in terms of observable characteristics of well-being
(e.g., Butler and Kern, 2016; Lukat et al., 2016), or characteristics
that are listed as mirror opposites of mental disorders (e.g.,
Huppert and So, 2013; Caprara et al., 2019; Oláh, 2019).

Our results support the conceptual deﬁnition of MPMHT
that refers to a degree of global well-being that goes hand in

hand with good emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual
functioning, resilience, coping, and savoring capacity, as well
as mental health sustainability on an ongoing basis, with
development and ﬂexible adaptation to changing conditions
guaranteed by competencies and personality factors.

Although various psychological tests exist, with diﬀerent
positive psychological constructs (see Sections “Introduction,”
test
“Measures,” and “Measures”),
to have a ﬁve-dimensional complex structure (Well-being,
Savoring, Creative and Executive Eﬃciency, Self-regulation,
and Resilience), with the aim of covering the wide spectrum
of mental health.

the MHT is the ﬁrst

The most important ﬁnding in our online cross-sectional
studies is that the ﬁve-dimensional structural validity of the 17-
item MHT was veriﬁed by EFA using a large sample (Study I,
n = 1,736). In turn, using CFA, the ﬁve-factor MHT model with
the original ﬁve scales was conﬁrmed by excellent ﬁt indices in
another large and independent sample (Study II, n = 1,083).
In addition, the internal consistency and temporal stability of
the scales was proven. By analyzing the discriminant validity
using multivariate linear regression, we were able to conclude
that all ﬁve scales have a signiﬁcant individual part of at least
44% that is not covered by the other four scales. The scale with
the highest unique variance of 82.7% is Self-regulation, although
the unique variances of the Savoring and Creative and Executive
Eﬃciency scales also exceed 55%. The Well-being scale is the
only one for which the unexplained proportion of variance is
less than 50%. This suggests that, among the ﬁve components
of mental health, well-being plays a central role. To expand and
conﬁrm the individual meaning of the scales, several tests and
individual questionnaire items were used in correlation analyses,
and sociodemographic variables in ANOVAs.

The results support that the Well-being scale conﬁdently
measures subjective well-being, which itself comprises several
components (biological, psychological, social, and spiritual).
The Well-being scale correlates at a high level with related
tests such as Diener’s Flourishing Scale, the PERMA-Proﬁler,
the WHO Well-Being Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with
Life Scale, and the Purpose in Life Test,
thus it can be
is
considered as a very similar test. An important result
that the existence of meaningful goals and the absence of
depressive symptoms and maladaptive schemas are an integral
part of the construct measured by the Well-being scale (see
Table 10). Well-being is related to the individual’s subjective
ﬁnancial status, although this relationship is weak. Well-being
has the strongest relationship with the other components
of mental health.

The Savoring scale measures how individuals are able to
mentally mobilize their previous positive,
joyful memories
and experiences to generate mental well-being, reliving them
in the present and, furthermore, extending them to future
events. This ability appears to be more prevalent among
women of all ages than men (see Figure 1). The results of

the validity studies show that the Savoring scale is closely
related to the main indicators of all the MHTs involved:
Diener’s Flourishing Scale,
the
WHO Well-Being Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life
Scale, and the Purpose in Life Test (see Tables 9, 10),
which conﬁrms the validity of its construct. The Creative and
Executive Eﬃciency scale measures how individuals are able to
cope with the diﬃculties they encounter by mobilizing their
various competencies in the diﬃcult, stressful, and challenging
situations of life. Furthermore, it measures how individuals
are able to provide successful individual and social problem-
solving behavior. The Creative and Executive Eﬃciency scale
shows strong correlations with other tests of mental health
(the Flourishing Scale, the PERMA-Proﬁler, the Purpose in Life
Test), which indicates the fulﬁllment of convergent validity
(see Tables 9, 10). It
is also related to the competence
component, in that a person who achieves a high value on
this scale also has a better chance of reaching ﬂow experience
(see Table 9). Further results of the validity studies show
that the Creative and Executive Eﬃciency scale is a negative
predictor of negative emotions, symptoms of depression, and
maladaptive schemas.

The Self-regulation scale provides information about a
person’s ability to regulate and control emotions, temperament,
and negative states. Positive correlations between the Self-
regulation scale and general mental
state, and negative
correlations with negative emotional states were consistently

One of the key ﬁndings of our study is that there are
competencies behind the diﬀerent components of mental health.
This result implies that these competences could be trained,
improved, and strengthened by their nature. This is most
obvious in the case of creative and executive eﬃciency, although,
based on the positive correlation with age, it must also be true
of self-regulation and resilience. Savoring also implies mental
ability that can be improved with cognitive techniques. As a

result, the level of experienced subjective well-being, satisfaction
with life, and, in ordinary terms, happiness can be signiﬁcantly
increased. Although, this positive prognosis can be conﬁrmed
by subsequent research which aim to demonstrate how these
competencies can be developed.

One limitation of our studies is the online recruitment
of participants: despite the large size of the samples, they
cannot be considered representative. The recruitment technique
may greatly inﬂuence several aspects (e.g., age distribution;
see Tables 2, 6). Our analyses are based solely on data from
verbal questionnaires, while the MHT scales are based, among
other things, on speciﬁc behaviors, mental operations, attitudes,
and so on. For this reason, to conﬁrm empirical validity it
would also be very important to verify the validity of the
scales with other types of psychological variables (e.g., rating
scales, direct observations, clinical symptoms, speciﬁc data
measuring physical condition, sociometric ranking, etc.). By way
of example, it would be useful to compare mental health as
measured by the MHT with the variables of 360-degree studies
(Mahar and Strobert, 2010). The meaning of the scales should
also be conﬁrmed by examining various clinical cases with
identiﬁed psychiatric diagnoses.

Conclusion

In sum, we believe our ﬁndings show in its present,
17-item form, designed for adults, the MHT can provide a
comprehensive picture of mental health in terms of MPMHT.
The MHT has a number of advantages over existing measures
of well-being and mental health, making it a preferable
measurement device for use in future research. Applying
the MPMHT approach in consultations, in skill-improvement
sessions, in relationship training, in group sessions, and in
behavioral therapy could help to improve the level of mental
health in psychologically healthy people. Future research should
examine the MHT in the clinical population and apply MPMHT
in positive clinical psychology.
