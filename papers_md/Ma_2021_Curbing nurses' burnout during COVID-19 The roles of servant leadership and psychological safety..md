Aims: This study examines the role of servant leadership through the mechanism of
psychological safety in curbing nurses’ burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown an increased level

of stress and burnout among health care workers, especially nurses. This study

responds to the call for research to explore the mechanisms of servant leadership in
predicting nurses’ burnout by employing the perspective of conservation of

resources theory.

Methods: Through a cross-sectional quantitative research design, data were col-
lected in three waves from 443 nurses working in Pakistan’s five public sector hospi-

tals. Data were analysed by employing the partial least squares path modelling (PLS-

PM) technique.
Results: Servant leadership (β = (cid:1)0.318; 95% CI = 0.225, 0.416) and psychological
safety (β = (cid:1)0.342; CI = 0.143, 0.350) have an inverse relationship with nurses’

burnout and explain 63.1% variance.
Conclusions: Servant leadership significantly reduces nurses’ burnout, and psycho-

logical safety mediates this relationship.

Implications for Nursing Management: Human resource management policies in

health care must emphasize training nursing leaders in servant leadership behaviour.

However, servant leadership has been given less attention in terms of

servant leadership as an approach to leadership that emphasizes

leaders facilitate nurses by creating a safe working environment
where employees’ mistakes are tolerated. A servant leader is charac-

terized by empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, stewardship, and
commitment to subordinates’ growth (Sherman, 2019). Such leaders

focus on encouragement by empowering and lifting those who work
for them (Karatepe et al., 2019): always look after staff’s needs and

work for the self-development of subordinates (Lee et al., 2020). So, a

servant leader naturally safeguards the psychological safety of the

patients. Criteria for selecting hospitals include (i) employing at

least 500 nurses, (ii) one from the four provincial capitals, and one

from the capital city of Pakistan. The authors approached the HR

department of the selected hospitals, explained the purpose of the
study, ensured the participants’ privacy, and sought approval for

nurses. Such leaders follow the open communication approach.

Structural model assessment (SMA) was done by following the latest

In SMA, the third step deals with the assessment of in-sample
