ABSTRACT
The health of refugees and migrants is determined by 
a wide range of factors. Among these, the local political 
climate in the postmigration phase is an important 
determinant which operates at interpersonal and 
institutional levels. We present a conceptual framework 
to advance theory, measurement and empirical evidence 
related to the small- area factors which shape and 
determine the local political climate, as these may translate 
into variations in health outcomes among refugees, 
migrants and other marginalised population groups. Using 
the example of Germany, we present evidence of small- 
area variation in factors defining political climates, and 
present and discuss potential pathways from local political 
climates to health outcomes. We show that anti- immigrant 
and antirefugee violence is a Europe- wide phenomenon 
and elaborate how resilience of individuals, communities, 
and the health system may function as moderator of the 
effects of the local political climate on health outcomes. 
Building on a pragmatic review of international evidence 
on spill- over effects identified in other racialised groups, 
we present a conceptual framework which incorporates 
direct effects as well as ‘spill- over’ effects on mental 
health with the aim to spark further academic discussion 
and guide empirical analysis on the topic. After presenting 
and discussing methodological challenges, we call 
for collective efforts to build coalitions between social 
sciences, conflict and violence studies, political science, 
data science, social psychologists and epidemiology to 
advance theory, measurement, and analysis of health 
effects of local political climates.

The health of refugees and migrants is deter-
mined  by  a  wide  range  of  premigration, 
perimigration  and  postmigration  factors.1–3 
Among these, the local political climate may 
be  an  important  determinant  which  oper-
ates  at  interpersonal  and  institutional  levels. 
Political  climate  can  be  understood  as  the 
aggregate mood or opinions of a population 
regarding current political issues. These opin-
ions  may  translate  into  individual  or  collec-
tive  action  as  well  as  institutional  processes, 
expressed,  for  example,  by  more  restrictive 

SUMMARY BOX
 ⇒ The local political climate is an important determi-
nant  of  migrant  and  refugee  health  in  the  postmi-
gration  phase  as  the  aggregate  mood  or  political 
opinion of a population may translate into individual 
or collective action, and shape institutional process-
es and policies towards integration or exclusion.
 ⇒ Small- area variations in local political climates are 
important  as  exclusionary  ideologies  and  violent 
acts  can  cluster  and  negatively  impact  on  mental 
health  of  those  directly  affected,  while—through 
so- called spill- overs—other population groups who 
identify with the immediate victims may be impaired 
as well.

 ⇒ We present a framework to further advance theory, 
measurement and empirical analyses of local polit-
ical climates and their direct and spill- over effects, 
and call towards this end for enhanced collaboration 
between social sciences, conflict and violence stud-
ies, political science, data science, social psycholo-
gists and social epidemiology.

or  inclusionary  policies.4  5  Different  polit-
ical  climates  can  coexist  in  a  population, 
varying  across  political  topics  and  dimen-
sions.  However,  public  health  research  has 
mostly considered national level policies, for 
example,  through  analyses  of  welfare  gener-
osity4  6  or  through  the  Migrant  Integration 
Policy  Index.7  The  more  complex  relation 
between  small- scale  political  climates,  for 
instance, at county or district level, and health 
outcomes  at  population  or  subgroup  level 
have largely been ignored.

We argue that, in view of the periodic rise 
of  right- wing  nationalism  across  Europe,8 
stronger attention needs to be paid to small- 
area factors, which shape and determine the 
local political climate, as these may translate 
into  variations  in  health  outcomes  among 
refugees,  migrants  and  other  marginalised 
population  groups.  We  describe  the  recent 
rise in right- wing ideology, present evidence of

small- area variation in factors defining political climates 
using the example of Germany and present and discuss 
potential pathways from local political climates to health 
outcomes.  We  present  a  framework  which  incorporates 
both direct effects and indirect (i.e., ‘spill- over’) effects 
on mental health as social psychological phenomena and 
elaborate how resilience of individuals, communities and 
the  health  system  may  function  as  moderators  of  such 
effects.

RIGHT-WING ANTIMIGRANT ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS, SMALL-
AREA VARIATIONS AND PATHWAYS TO HEALTH
Political attitudes associated with radical right- wing polit-
ical orientation can include xenophobia, ethnocentricity, 
bigotry  and  racism  to  varying  degrees.9  Extreme  forms 
of  these  beliefs—combined  with  unconstitutional  and 
antidemocratic  ideology,  including  violence  as  means 
of achieving political goals—are described as right- wing 
extremism.9  Populist  radical  right  parties  have  gained 
political power in several European countries, including 
Germany, United Kingdom, Austria, Italy and France,8 10 
giving  rise  to  right- wing  discourses  targeting  migrants 
and refugees in particular.8 Anti- immigrant political atti-
tudes  affect  immigrants  not  only  through  politics  and 
policy  of  political  representatives.  They  may  also  affect 
actual  behaviour  of  private  persons  and  citizens  and 
thereby  impact  the  everyday  life  of  migrants  and  refu-
gees through experiences of hostility,11 social isolation,12 
discrimination,13 xenophobia14 and violence.15

However, anti- immigrant attitudes and actions are not 
equally  distributed  but  vary  across  districts,  municipali-
ties or even at city and neighbourhood level. In Germany, 
for example, support for radical right- wing opinion clus-
ters not only by geography (East vs West) (figure 1) but 
also  by  socioeconomic  characteristics:  differences  in 
unemployment  rates  and  feelings  of  collective  depriva-
tion  among  the  401  German  districts  explain  between 
20%  and  24%  of  the  variation  in  district- level  extreme 
right- wing  attitudes,  electoral  support  for  radical  right- 
wing parties and right- wing crimes.16

Political  climate  can  affect  mental  health  of  refugees 
and  migrants  in  two  fundamental  ways:  at  (1)  institu-
tional and (2) interpersonal levels. First, anti- immigrant 
attitudes  might  translate  into  limited  access  to  health 
infrastructure at an institutional level. Political actors in 
more  anti- immigrant  regions  may  not  offer  support  for 
the specific health- related needs of refugees, exert power 
through  inaction  to  address  health  needs,  make  access 
to  services  more  difficult  or  even  deny  services  entirely 
by  restricting  healthcare  entitlements.  At  macro- level, 
political climates impact on health through national poli-
cies, such as the ‘hostile environment’ policy in the UK,17 
healthcare restrictions in Germany18 or restrictive border 
policies4 and dehumanising encampment and detention 
at European borders.19 However, empirical links between 
local political climate and healthcare access using small- 
area analyses are yet lacking widely.

Second,  refugees  and  migrants  can  directly  expe-
rience  a  hostile  and  socially  exclusive  environment

violence. A large body of literature points to the strong 
negative  effects  of  social  exclusion,  discrimination  and 
violence  for  the  mental  health  and  well- being  of  racial-
ised  groups.20–23  Data  of  the  nationally  representative 
Socio- Economic Panel (2022) in Germany show that refu-
gees  living  in  regions  with  higher  antirefugee  attitudes 
express considerably higher worries of xenophobia, and 
that there is not only an East- West but also a North- South 
gradient of hostile climates and xenophobia among refu-
gees (see figure 1).

A  hostile  political  climate  also  clusters—in  spatio-
temporal  dimensions—with 
incident  anti- immigrant 
violence  (see  figure  1).  In  the  last  three  decades, 
Germany  has  repeatedly  experienced  large- scale  immi-
gration  by  refugees.  The  challenge  and  responsibility 
of addressing health and humanitarian needs, as well as 
long- term  integration,  was  often  accompanied  by  large- 
scale racist violence against refugees,24 including several 
pogrom- like  incidences  during  the  1990s25  and  violent 
acts targeting refugee centres in the mid- 2010s.26 A total 
of  160  arson  attacks  were  perpetrated  against  refugee 
centres  during  2014  and  2015,  that  is,  about  one  arson 
attack every 5 days,15 but antirefugee mobilisation in this 
period also included widespread antimigrant rallies and 
physical violence.

Although  particularly  prominent  in  Germany,  attacks 
against asylum seekers and their accommodations are a 
Europe- wide issue. For example, 47 attacks against recep-
tion  centres  were  reported  in  Finland  in  2015,  while 
Sweden  recorded  43  such  attacks  in  the  same  period.27 
Greece has a tragic history of systematic police brutality 
towards  asylum  seekers  and  refugees  and  recorded  75 
racist  crimes  against  migrants  or  refugees  in  2015.27  In 
the Netherlands, hate crimes and assaults against asylum 
seekers were reported during protests against new asylum 
accommodations.27  However,  most  European  countries 
do  not  systematically  collect  data  on  attacks  against 
asylum  seekers  and  their  accommodations.27  While 
efforts  of  non- governmental  organisations  closed  this 
data gap in some countries for 2015/2016, these efforts 
have  not  recently  been  systematically  repeated.  Antiref-
ugee  violence  is,  thus,  highly  under- reported,28  and  its 
consequences in terms of population- level health impacts 
go unnoticed.

‘SPILL-OVER’ EFFECTS
Violent acts and hate crimes directly affect the health and 
well- being  of  individual  victims.  However,  their  impact 
may extend well beyond the injured or affected individual 
and negatively impact the mental health and well- being 
of  other  population  groups  through  ‘spill- overs’.29  The 
term  ‘spill- over’  refers  to  any  effect  of  an  exposure,  for 
example,  violence,  beyond  those  directly  exposed  to  it. 
This includes indirect effects on not only refugee groups 
but also migrant or non- migrant groups alike. Not only 
direct  exposure  to  violence  but  also  indirect  exposure, 

BMJ Global Health

for  example,  witnessing,  hearing  or  knowing  about  the 
victimisation  from  media  reports  or  peers,  is  associated 
with negative mental health outcomes.30 Spill- over effects 
have been well studied in the context of police killings of 
Black Americans: the body of evidence strongly suggests 
that  the  negative  effect  of  violence  against  racialised 
groups unfolds beyond the immediate victims, translating 
into poorer mental health,31 32 higher suicide rates33 and 
higher emergency department visits for depressive symp-
toms34  among  Black  Americans.  Such  effects  are  larger 
with  increasing  ‘proximity’—in  terms  of  geography  or 
identity—to  the  victims  of  direct  violence.31–33  With 
decreasing ‘proximity’, research challenges arise as quan-
titative  effect  measurements  may  weaken.  Overall,  data 
and measurement challenges caution researchers to rely 
on oversimplified approaches which may lead to misclas-
sification of exposures.35 36

Studies support the theory of spill- over effects in other 
racialised  groups  as  well.  For  example,  Arabic- named 
women in the USA showed poorer birth outcomes during 
a period of rapidly rising anti- Muslim attitudes following 
the  9/11  terrorist  attacks.37  Natural  experiments  have 
shown  that  immigration  enforcement  and  related  raids 
among  Latin  American  immigrants  in  the  USA  have 
been associated with worse birth outcomes among Latina 
women38  and  higher  stress  and  lower  self- rated  health 
among indirectly affected adults and children.39

MODERATING EFFECTS THROUGH RESILIENCE
The effects of local political climate and racially motivated 
acts of violence on mental health may vary depending on 
resources available at individual, community and health 
system levels.

At  an  individual  level,  the  concept  of  resilience  has 
been used to describe the ability of individuals to resist 
developing  mental  disorders  in  the  face  of  adversity  or 
stressful events.40 It is commonly conceptualised within a 
biopsychosocial model, which encompasses genetic, phys-
iological, psychological and social factors.40 Such psycho-
logical resilience has been explored since the 1970s and is 
considered a key protective factor that helps individuals 
or groups of people to adapt to, cope with and recover 
from both acute and chronic situations of trauma, crisis 
or suffering,41 for example, in light of existential threats, 
interpersonal  or  collective  discrimination,  racism  or 
conflict and violence.

Beyond the individual, community resilience contributes 
to  the  mental  health  and  well- being  of  societies  faced 
with sudden disasters or chronic challenges,42 including 
violence.43  44  Resources  available  at  community  level, 
particularly  relating  to  different  forms  of  social  capital, 
but  also  aspects  of  communication,  community  compe-
tence and economic development, have been identified 
as  being  key  to  an  adequate  response  mitigating  and 
preventing negative health effects.42 As for social capital, 
this includes, for example, civil society actors who prac-
tice  solidarity  with  refugees  in  the  contested  political

space of immigration. During the ‘summer of migration’, 
civil society actors developed a sense of social solidarity, 
prevented  negative  reactions  towards  immigrants  and 
refugees  through  their  activities  supporting  integration 
and by standing up against racism towards a more inclu-
sive  society.45  Beyond  individual  resources  inherent  in 
psychological  resilience,  refugees  may  be  able  to  draw 
on  the  wider  social  and  economic  resources  of  their 
community  to  resist  the  harmful  direct  and  indirect 
effects  of  political  climate  on  mental  health.  This  may 
include aspects of social trust, a sense of belonging in the 
community and opportunities  for community  participa-
tion as well as community infrastructure, economic and 
educational  opportunities.  Social  capital  at  community 
level has been identified key protective factor for mental 
health and well- being of refugees,46 47 and interventions 
fostering social relationships, ties and networks are effec-
tive  but  under- used  tools  to  enhance  community  resil-
ience  and  thereby  protect  mental  health  of  refugees.48 
Strengthening  community  resilience  is  also  paramount 
to combat hate and racism in the digital era.49

Health  systems,  understood  as  socially  constructed 
complex adaptive system,50 can provide further resources 
to  mediate  the  potential  negative  effects  of  political 
climate  and  violence  on  health.  Health  system  resil-
ience  comprises  three  capacities—absorptive,  adap-
tive  and  transformative51—which  can  be  mobilised  to 
uphold  or  restore  a  systems  function.  These  capacities 
may  operate  at  different  levels  (individual,  community 
and system)52 and may be affected by dynamics in other 
societal  sectors  (eg,  economic  sector,  political  sector) 
creating complex interactions between sectors and across 
multiple  levels.53  On  the  one  hand,  health  systems  can 
re- enforce othering54 and exclusion and further amplify 
negative effects of local political climates through health-
care  encounters  and  interactions  at  interpersonal  level 
determined by attitudes of healthcare professionals.55 On 
the other hand, the local political climate may determine 
the  quality  and  scope  of  health  infrastructure  available 
to  refugees,55  while  at  the  structural  level,  exclusionary 
ideologies  may  manifest  themselves  in  form  of  policies 
which  actively  uphold  modifiable  barriers  to  health-
care.56  For  example,  the  resilience  of  the  health  system 

for refugees in Germany during the COVID- 19 pandemic 
was highly dependent on the constellation and interests 
of local political actors.57

Individual,  community  and  health  system  resilience 
can,  hence,  be  understood  as  nested  levels  within  a 
complex  adaptive  system53  whose  relationships  among 
each other and vis á vis the local political climate have so 
far been insufficiently investigated in the health systems 
literature.

ADVANCING THE EVIDENCE: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND 
CALL FOR ACTION
Despite  surging  anti- immigrant  attitudes  and  actions,58 
there is only little research in Europe23 on the potential 
population- level health impact of local political climates 
or  spatial  clusters  of  anti- immigrant  and  antirefugee 
violence. The potential mental health impact may, as we 
have shown, also extend beyond immigrant populations 
and affect other population groups who may be targeted 
due to their ethnic, political, sexual or religious identity.
As  it  is  time  to  reconcile  migration  and  health  in 
Europe,59  we  urge  researchers  to  study  these  effects 
and related causal chains and pathways. To this end, we 
provide  a  simplified  and  preliminary  framework  to  not 
only  initiate  academic  discourse  but  also  spark  further 
conceptual and empirical work (see figure 2).

The  framework  regards  the  local  political  climate  as 
shaped  by  a  combination  of  attitudes  and  actions,  with 
non- linear, reciprocal relationships which may re- enforce 
or  contradict  each  other.  Attitudes  can  be  elicited  (eg, 
verbally expressed) or latent and emerge and relate to the 
cognitive domain, while actions relate to the behavioural 
domain.60 The relationship between attitude and action, 
however, is complex and subjected to several theoretical 
and  methodological  considerations,  of  which  the  most 
important one is that there is no one- way simplistic causal 
relation from one to the other.60

Another  layer  of  complexity  is  added  by  the  fact  that 
the  local  political  climate  is  not  confined  to  a  distinct 
geospatial location. Through intersections with the tech-
nological sphere, it extends well beyond geography and 
includes the digital space—as place ‘without places’—in

hate61  and  online  othering62  as  emerging  phenomena 
affect  and  reproduce  exclusionary  political  attitudes 
against  refugees63  and  may  constitute  virtual  stages  of 
real action. For example, the mobilisation of anti- Muslim 
attitudes  and  large- scale  violence  against  Rohingya  in 
Myanmar  was  evidently  fueled  by  hate  speech  in  social 
media.64 65 While this is an extreme case, the question in 
how far local (violent) actions against refugees and immi-
grants are fueled by digitally produced climates of hate 
requires stronger empirical analysis. Such analysis entails 
several  methodological  challenges66  but  may  have  the 
potential for early warning or surveillance systems to be 
developed for violence prevention.

The  local  political  climate,  understood  as  the  assem-
blage  of  the  cognitive,  behavioural,  spatial  and  techno-
logical  sphere,  may  affect  individuals  directly  through 
experience of elicited attitudes or behaviour and action 
at  interpersonal,  and  also  at  institutional  level  (e.g., 
expressed  through  policies).  At  the  same  time,  the 
framework  considers  potential  ‘spill- over’  effects  of  the 
political climate on mental health of immigrant or other 
population groups with proximity (defined by identity or 
geography). Resilience, at level of individuals, communi-
ties and health systems, may be a moderator on the causal 
pathway for both direct and indirect effects (figure 2).

METHODOLOGICAL AND MEASUREMENT CHALLENGES
Public  health  research  could  play  a  significant  role 
by  defining,  documenting  and  comparing  within 
and  across  countries  the  effects  of  the  local  political 
climate  on  population  health.  A  central  task  is  the 
linkage  of  different  data  types  across  disciplines,  for 
instance,  socioeconomic 
large- scale  (longitudinal) 
survey data, health (survey) data, aggregated local and 
regional  indicators  on  social  structures  and  political 
sentiment, geocoded social media data and geocoded 
data  on  local  violence  and  crime.  Such  innovative 
linkage approaches would also help to improve health 
information systems with respect to refugee and migra-
tion health.67 A mix of methodological approaches will 
be  necessary  to  analyse  the  complex  data  required, 
including big spatial data management procedures to 
store  and  preprocess  data  and  small- area  estimation 
techniques to increase the robustness of estimates for 
lower  level  regions.  Moreover,  innovative  methods 
are  needed  to  facilitate  the  measurement  of  (local) 
political  climate  in  the  digital  sphere,  especially  in 
social  media.  Challenges  relate  to  accessibility  of 
data,68 69 the geoinformation available,70 71 and natural 
language processing methods for extracting meaning 
out  of  unstructured  social  media  and  online  textual 
data.72  73  Another  challenge  refers  to  the  delocalised 
nature of the digital sphere: if everyone is exposed, no 
epidemiological assessment is possible. The challenge 
will hence be to assess regional variation of consumers, 
producers  and/or  victims  of  hate  speech  and  online

othering  in  order  to  re- localise  the  exposures  and 
their potential consequences. Qualitative designs may 
further  help  to  disentangle  mechanisms  and  causal 
chains  of  local  political  climates  to  health  outcomes. 
They are furthermore instrumental in giving voice to 
those affected by right- wing antimigrant attitudes and 
actions,  avoiding  victimisation  and  contextualising 
their agency within discursive fields that are predom-
inantly  shaped  by  power  relations,  for  example,  of 
media, authorities, political and humanitarian organi-
sations and science.74

Last  but  not  least,  efforts  are  required  to  stan-
dardise  definitions  of  anti- immigrant  and  racist 
violence,  including  the  set- up  of  systematic  moni-
toring  approaches  based  on  existing  cross- national 
efforts28  to  measure  the  potential  direct  and  indirect 
population- level health impacts.

Overcoming 

these  measurement 

challenges, 
however,  will  not  suffice  to  generate  robust  evidence 
on  causal  pathways.  At  the  core  of  the  pathways 
outlined  in  the  conceptual  framework  is  an  ecolog-
ical  association,  from  a  small- area  contextual  expo-
sure  (eg,  local  political  climate  or  intensity  of  racial 
violence) to population- level health outcomes among 
refugees,  migrants  or  non- migrant  groups.  While  it 
may  be  argued  that  the  ecological  nature  limits  the 
investigation of causal pathways per se, we believe that 
this  is  the  only  approach  which  allows  for  the  iden-
tification  of  population- level  determinants  of  poor 
(mental)  health.  Following  the  rationale  of  Geoffrey 
Rose’s  seminal  paper  on  aetiology  in  public  health, 
the concern of study here is much more the identifica-
tion of the determinants of incidence of poor (mental) 
health  as  opposed  to  the  identification  of  determi-
nants  of  individual  cases  with  poor  (mental)  health.75 
Studies  analysing  refugee  mental  health  in  contexts 
where  they  are  exposed  to  a  homogenous  level  of 
political climates (or ignoring this factor a priori) will 
fail  to  identify  it  as  relevant  determinant  and  create 
an  individualistic  fallacy  which  attributes  variation  in 
health to individual- level factors alone. Exploiting the 
regional  variation  in  local  political  climates  at  small- 
area  level  can  help  to  identify  its  causal  effects  on 
population- level health outcomes. However, for causal 
inference  to  be  free  of  compositional  bias,  studies 
need  to  rule  out  self- selection  of  individuals  and 
population  groups  into  contexts.  The  use  of  natural 
experiment  designs,  if  available,  or  analytical  strate-
gies  such  as  instrumental  variables,  propensity  score 
matching and/or difference- in- difference analysis will 
be  required  to  ensure  that  contextual  effects  of  local 
political climates are studied while minimising compo-
sitional bias through selective migration.76

A  deeper  knowledge  of  the  relationships  of  polit-
ical climate and population health may help to design 
interventions—at  societal,  community,  health  system 
or  individual  level—to  counter  exclusionary  poli-
