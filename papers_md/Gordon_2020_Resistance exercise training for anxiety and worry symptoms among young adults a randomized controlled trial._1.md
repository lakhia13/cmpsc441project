Resistance exercise training 
for anxiety and worry symptoms 
among young adults: a randomized 
controlled trial

Brett R. Gordon  1,2*, Cillian P. McDowell1,2,3,4, Mark Lyons1 & Matthew P. Herring1,2

This trial quantified the effects of ecologically-valid resistance exercise training (RET) on anxiety and 
worry symptoms among young adults. Young adults not meeting criteria for subclinical, or analogue 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (AGAD) were randomized to an eight-week RET intervention, or eight-
week wait-list. AGAD status was determined using validated cut-scores for both the Psychiatric 
Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire-Generalized Anxiety Disorder subscale (≥ 6) and Penn State Worry 
Questionnaire (≥ 45). The primary outcome was anxiety symptoms measured with the Trait Anxiety 
subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The RET was designed according to World Health 
Organization and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. RM-ANCOVA examined differences 
between RET and wait-list over time. Significant interactions were decomposed with simple effects 
analysis. Hedges’ d effect sizes quantified magnitude of differences in change between RET and 
wait-list. Twenty-eight participants (64% female) fully engaged in the trial (mean age: 26.0 ± 6.2y, 
RET: n = 14; Wait-list: n = 14). A significant group X time interaction was found for anxiety symptoms 
 (F(3,66) = 3.60, p ≤ 0.019; d = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.06 to 1.63). RET significantly reduced anxiety symptoms 
from baseline to post-intervention (mean difference =  − 7.89, p ≤ 0.001). No significant interaction 
was found for worry  (F(3,69) = 0.79, p ≥ 0.50; d =  − 0.22, 95%CI: − 0.96 to 0.53). Ecologically-valid RET 
significantly improves anxiety symptoms among young adults.

Exercise, a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive, for the purpose of enhancing or 
maintaining or more components of  fitness1, has well-established effects on anxiety among otherwise healthy 
 adults2, chronically-ill  adults3, and adults with anxiety  disorders4. Recent meta-analytic evidence indicated that 
RET, though understudied compared to aerobic exercise, significantly reduces anxiety among both healthy 
adults (∆ = 0.50) and those with a physical/mental illness (∆ = 0.19)5. However, there is a lack of rigorously 
designed investigations of ecologically-valid resistance exercise training (RET) that have reported adherence 
and compliance among young adult males and females. Ecologically-valid RET programs generalize to settings 
outside of a laboratory setting, are comprised of RET frequency, composition, intensity, progression, and use 
of standard movements that can be performed at home or at a gym. The only two trials that have randomized 
healthy young adults to  RET6,7 showed positive effects on anxiety of magnitudes ranging from small (d = 0.32)6 to 
large (d = 1.17)7. However, these trials included homogenous samples of males and did not report attendance or 
compliance to RET, a frequent limitation in this  literature5. Few trials have examined response to RET designed 
in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO)8 and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 
 guidelines9. WHO recommends muscle strengthening activities involving major muscle groups two or more 
days a  week8; ACSM recommends progressive RET a minimum of two non-consecutive days each week, with 
1–3 sets of 8–12 repetitions for muscular strength benefits in  novices9.

The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) of RET among people with an anxiety disorder to date reported 
improved clinical  severity10, sleep quality and  quantity11, quality of  life12, and associated  symptoms13 among 
young adult women with GAD. However, the extent to which ecologically-valid RET designed in accordance 
with WHO and ACSM guidelines improves anxiety and worry symptoms among young adults without an anxiety

present with clinically-relevant anxiety symptoms provides proof of principle to examine among samples with 
clinically-relevant anxiety symptoms; based on reductions in symptoms among those without clinically-relevant 
symptom elevations, larger magnitude reductions among those with more severe symptoms would be anticipated. 
Thus, the RCT reported here quantified the effects of RET on anxiety and worry symptoms among young adults 
without AGAD. Based on previous evidence, the authors hypothesized that RET would elicit small magnitude 
reductions in anxiety symptoms and small magnitude reductions in worry symptoms.

Materials and methods
This trial has adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)  Checklist14.

Trial design.  This manuscript presents findings from one of two parallel RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
NCT04116944, 07/10/2019). The full methods of these RCTs were reported  previously15. The research proto-
col was approved by the University of Limerick’s Education and Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee 
(EHSREC No: 2017_03_18_EHS), performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 
Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments, and informed consent was obtained from all individual par-
ticipants included in the study. This trial had rolling recruitment; data collection began January 18th, 2018 and 
concluded June 26th, 2019.

Participants.  Participants were recruited from the surrounding area via posters, emails, and word of mouth. 
Potential participants initially completed an electronic battery of physical activity and mood questionnaires to 
establish eligibility; Fig. 1 presents a flowchart of participant recruitment. At baseline, participants completed a 
battery of online questionnaires, including the 10-item Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire-GAD 
subscale (PDSQ-GAD)16 and the 16-item Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)17, followed by several other 
questionnaires  that  assessed  signs  and  symptoms  of  GAD,  e.g.,  state  anxiety,  feelings  of  energy  and  fatigue, 
irritability,  and  depressive  symptoms.  Participants  were  categorized  as  either  AGAD  (PDSQ-GAD ≥ 6  and 
PSWQ ≥ 45)  or  non-AGAD.  Randomization  was  conducted  utilizing  www.rando mizer .org  to  generate  a  ran-
domized list of codes to indicate assignment to either the RET or wait-list control condition. Participants who 
did not meet or exceed both cut scores were considered non-AGAD. Participants with AGAD were diverted to 
the parallel RCT. Following AGAD categorization, participants were randomized, stratified by sex, to RET or a 
wait-list control condition.

Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 18–40y; (2) not meeting criteria for AGAD; (3) no medical contraindication 
to safe participation in RET; and, (4) no current pregnancy or lactation. Young adults were recruited because the 
median age of onset of GAD is 30 years18. Current RET involvement at baseline was not an exclusion criterion. 
Participants were not excluded if they were in treatment for anxiety or other mental health disorders. Participants’ 
previous self-reported RET involvement was measured in weeks. Participants in both groups were advised to 
maintain their current levels of physical activity throughout the trial. Participants were not compensated. Based 
on previous meta-analytic evidence of the small-to-moderate effect of RET on anxiety (Δ = 0.31)5, a priori power 
analysis with G*Power 3.1 indicated a sample size of 24 (12 in each group) would provide > 80% statistical power 
(two-tailed α = 0.05, four repeated measures) to detect a small-to-moderate effect of RET on anxiety symptoms.

RET intervention.  The RET was designed in accordance with WHO and ACSM  guidelines8,9. The eight-
week, twice-weekly intervention increased resistance progressively, such that the participant could complete two 
sets of between 8 and 12 repetitions of eight exercises before experiencing either fatigue, a deterioration in lifting 
form noted by the investigator, or failure to complete a repetition. The resistance was stipulated by the investiga-
tor in accordance with guidelines rather than self-selected by participants. RET sessions were fully supervised, 
conducted privately on a one-to-one basis in a RET facility, with no other people in the facility besides the inves-
tigator and participant. When necessary, an additional investigator was in the facility for spotting, or investiga-
tor training purposes. The eight exercises were barbell squat, barbell bench press, hexagon bar deadlift, seated 
dumbbell shoulder lateral raise, barbell bent over rows, dumbbell lunges, seated dumbbell curls, and abdominal 
crunches. Participants randomized to the immediate start RET completed a three-week, twice-weekly, famil-
iarization process to ensure safety, correct lifting technique, and that the entirety of the eight-week intervention 
was delivered at the correct resistance starting at week one. Further specifics of the RET intervention have been 
previously  published15.

Control condition.  Participants randomized to the wait-list completed questionnaires electronically once 
a week. Participants that completed the eight-week wait-list condition were subsequently offered the RET inter-
vention, but no data were collected.

Outcomes.  Anxiety  symptoms  were  the  primary  outcome  of  the  trial,  and  were  measured  with  the  trait 
subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y2)19. The 20-item STAI-Y2 is the most widely-used anxiety 
measure in the RET for anxiety  literature5, has strong internal  consistency20, and has shown sensitivity to change 
in response to even short-term  RET13. Anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline, week one, week four, and 
post-intervention.  Cronbach’s  α  assessed  internal  consistency  of  outcome  measures.  Internal  consistency  for 
anxiety symptoms was α = 0.90 (ICC = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.81 to 0.94). Correlations between repeated measures were 
0.83 (p ≤ 0.001) and 0.73 (p ≤ 0.003) for the RET and wait-list groups, respectively.

Worry symptoms were a secondary outcome assessed using the 16-item PSWQ. Total worry, worry engage-
ment, and absence of worry scores were calculated according to  recommendations21. The PSWQ has a test–retest 
reliability of 0.92, strong internal consistency 0.95, and, a score of 45 has shown sensitivity/specificity for GAD 
of 99/98%17,22. Worry was measured at baseline, week one, week four, and post-intervention. Internal consist-
ency for the PSWQ was α = 0.92 (ICC = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.80 to 0.94). Correlations between repeated measures 
were 0.90 (p ≤ 0.001) and 0.89 (p ≤ 0.001) for the RET and wait-list group respectively. Internal consistency 
for worry engagement was α = 0.90 (ICC = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.78 to 0.93). Correlations between repeated measures 
were 0.86 (p ≤ 0.001) and 0.89 (p ≤ 0.001) for the RET and wait-list group respectively. Internal consistency for 
absence of worry was α = 0.84 (ICC = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.54 to 0.88). Correlations between repeated measures were 
0.92 (p ≤ 0.001) and 0.51 (p ≥ 0.06) for the RET and wait-list group respectively.

Covariates.  Baseline  physical  activity  was  assessed  using  an  online,  self-report  version  of  the  seven-day 
Physical Activity  Recall23. Participants reported time engaged in sleep, moderate, hard, and very hard activities 
during the prior week. Estimated energy expenditure was calculated as kilocalories per week.

Intervention fidelity and manipulation check.  Attendance was calculated by dividing the number of 
RET bouts attended by 16 (2 sessions per week × 8 weeks). Compliance was calculated by dividing the number of 
sets in which at least eight repetitions were completed by 256 (2 sets × 8 exercises × 2 sessions per week × 8 weeks), 
which represents the prescribed number of repetitions. To quantify anticipated changes in objective muscular

strength as a manipulation check, and to facilitate setting of load, participants completed a five repetition maxi-
mum (5RM) assessment for the barbell squat, barbell bench press, and hexagon bar deadlift at baseline and post-
intervention. During the six familiarization sessions, participants completed two familiarizations with the 5RM 
process,  and  one  maximal  5RM  assessment.  Rate  of  perceived  exertion  (6–20)24  and  a  muscle  soreness  scale 
(1–10) were measured following the completion of each exercise.

Statistical  analyses.  Data  analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  26.0.  Missing  data  for  STAI-Y2  (n = 5), 
and worry (n = 4) were imputed: gender and time-variant responses for each variable were entered as predictors 
into separate multiple linear regression models for condition, and predicted values were retained. Participants 
(n = 10) were excluded if they were missing primary outcome data at > 1 time point. Independent samples t-tests 
examined baseline differences in age, body mass index, physical activity, anxiety symptoms, and worry symp-
toms between groups and based on sex. The magnitude of baseline differences were quantified using Cohen’s d 
effect  sizes25. Two group (RET/wait-list) x four time (baseline/week one/week four/week eight) RM-ANCOVA 
examined differences between RET and wait-list, controlling for age, sex, and baseline physical activity. Signifi-
cant interactions were decomposed using simple effects analysis. The magnitude of within-condition change was 
quantified using standardized mean difference (SMD). Associations between changes in strength and changes 
in anxiety and worry symptoms were quantified using Pearson correlation coefficients of associations between 
change  scores. The  magnitude  of  difference  in  outcome  change  between  groups  was  quantified  by  Hedges’  d 
effect sizes and associated 95%Cs25. Intention-to-treat analyses, analyses of complete cases only, and analyses 
without controlling for baseline physical activity are reported as sensitivity analyses. Hedges’ d effect sizes were 
calculated by subtracting the mean change in the wait-list from the mean change in the RET condition, and 
dividing this difference by the pooled standard deviation of baseline scores, and adjusted for small sample size 
bias. Effect sizes are calculated such that improved outcomes in each condition and larger improvements among 
RET  compared  to  wait-list  resulted  in  positive  effect  sizes.  Changes  in  strength  were  examined  with  paired-
sample t-tests. The NNT and associated 95%CIs were converted from Hedges’ d and calculated as the inverse of 
the absolute risk reduction for RET compared with the wait-list condition. NNT was rounded up to the near-
est whole  number26. De-identified individual participant data for primary outcomes measures analysed during 
the current study will be made available for five years at six months following publication of primary outcome 
measures summary data.

Ethics  statement.  The  research  protocol  was  approved  by  the  University’s  Research  Ethics  Committee 
(2017_03_18_EHS), and performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declara-
tion of Helsinki and its later amendments.

Results
Table 1 presents baseline participant characteristics and differences between groups. There were no baseline 
differences between groups on any outcomes, supporting successful randomization. There were no baseline 
differences between sexes on any outcomes. Although not an exclusion criterion, all participants included in 
analyses had a training age of zero, meaning they were not engaged in structured resistance exercise training. One 
participant currently receiving treatment for depression withdrew from the wait-list. No participants reported 
receiving treatment for GAD.

Intervention fidelity and manipulation check.  The average attendance to the RET intervention was 
85% (13 out of 16 sessions). The average compliance with RET was 83% (212 out of 256 repetitions). The average 
rate of perceived exertion was 14 ± 1 (in between somewhat hard and hard), and average muscle soreness was

4 ± 2 out of 10. As anticipated, participants in the RET intervention significantly increased their strength (t(13) =  
− 6.75, p ≤ 0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.04, mean increase: 23.4% ± 14.7).

Anxiety and worry severity.  Table 2 presents descriptives, SMD, and Hedges’ d (95%CI) for outcomes. 
Based on the magnitude of worry reduction, there was a NNT of 3 (95%CI: 2–37). There was a significant group 
X time interaction for anxiety symptoms  (F(3,66) = 3.60, p ≤ 0.019; d = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.06–1.63). RET significantly 
reduced anxiety symptoms from baseline to post-intervention (mean difference =  − 7.89, p ≤ 0.001). There was 
no significant interaction for worry  (F(3,69)=0.79, p ≥ 0.51, d =  − 0.22, 95%CI: − 0.96 to 0.53), worry engagement 
 (F(3,69) = 0.37, p ≥ 0.79, d =  − 0.20, 95%CI: − 0.94 to 0.54), or absence of worry  (F(3,69) = 1.81, p ≥ 0.16, d =  − 0.18, 
95%CI: − 0.92 to 0.57). RM-ANCOVA findings did not differ upon removal of baseline physical activity as a 
covariate for all outcomes. There was a significant group X time interaction for anxiety symptoms  (F(3,69) = 3.41, 
p ≤ 0.02), and no significant interaction for worry, worry-engagement, or absence of worry (all p ≥ 0.16). The 
magnitude of outcome change did not materially differ in intention-to-treat or complete case analyses for all 
outcomes (Supplement 1). Although both the RET and wait-list reduced worry, Hedges’ d effect sizes were nega-
tive, as greater reductions in worry occurred in the wait-list. Table 3 presents Hedges’ d (95%CI) for outcomes 
through time-points of the intervention. Changes in strength were not significantly associated with changes in 
anxiety symptoms (r(14) = 0.07, p = 0.83), worry symptoms (r(14) =  − 0.19, p = 0.55), worry engagement (r(14) = 0.16, 
p = 0.63), or absence of worry (r(14) =  − 0.39, p = 0.21).

Discussion
Compared to an eight-week wait-list control condition, ecologically-valid RET, designed according to WHO 
and ACSM guidelines, significantly reduced anxiety symptoms in a non-anxiety disordered young adult sample. 
This RCT specifically addressed recent calls from the United States Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Com-
mittee Scientific Report to conduct RCTs among individuals at different stages or severity of impairment (i.e., 
AGAD) to examine whether physical activity delays or prevents disease onset and  progression27. Disease onset 
and progression is particularly relevant to young adults with AGAD, as those who display elevated subclinical 
symptoms are more likely to develop clinically significant  psychopathology28, and intervening at this point in 
the severity spectrum could alleviate future burden through the preventative capacity of exercise training. The 
large magnitude reductions in anxiety found here (d = 0.85) are larger than previous meta-analytic evidence of 
the effects of RET on anxiety symptoms among healthy adults of all ages (∆ = 0.50)5. The large reductions in anxi-
ety symptoms here are clinically meaningful, based on a frequently used response threshold of a 50% or greater

The magnitude of anxiety reductions is larger than the effect of aerobic-based physical activity interventions in 
healthy adults (∆ = 0.45)2, and larger than the effect of RET among young adult women with GAD (d = 0.52)13. 
Even though participants were deliberately screened for lower levels of worry, both RET and wait-list exhibited 
small magnitude reductions in worry.

Greater magnitude reductions in anxiety symptoms occurred following initial familiarization to week one 
(d = 0.51, 95%CI: − 0.25 to 1.28), and subsequently from week four to post-intervention (d = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.35 
to 1.18), than from week one to week four (d =  − 0.14 95%CI: − 0.90 to 0.61). These stepped reductions indicate 
that participants have immediate improvements in anxiety symptoms upon beginning an RET intervention, 
and even if reductions briefly plateau, the reductions continue with further RET  engagement13. As predicted, 
there were large reductions in anxiety symptoms in the RET group, and relatively little change in the wait-list. 
A non-significant, negative effect for worry (d =  − 0.22, 95%CI − 0.96 to 0.53) was not expected. However, the 
negative Hedges’ d effect size occurred due to worry improvements in both groups, with non-significantly larger 
(albeit both small magnitude) improvements in the wait-list. Ideally, participants assigned to the wait-list con-
trol condition experience no change in anxiety symptoms or worry. However, small, non-significant changes in 
either direction were expected, as meta-analytic evidence has shown that wait-lists may result in  improvement30 
and worsening of  outcomes31 among those with anxiety disorders. In the context of exercise interventions for 
mental health, placebo/sham exercise interventions have positive effects on subjective  outcomes32. Although 
the magnitude of worry reduction was affected by improvements in the wait-list in this trial, moderate-to-large 
magnitude improvements in worry in either group were not expected, as participants were deliberately screened 
for reduced worry.

Adherence of 85% and compliance to RET of 83% supports that the RET intervention was feasible and toler-
able. These attendance and compliance rates indicate that participants missed between 2–3 sessions over the 
intervention, but were compliant when they attended. Furthermore, no adverse events to the RET occurred. 
Physical activity participation at the population level is  low33, and even lower in individuals with mental health 
 issues34. However, participants who completed the trial (n = 28) had significantly greater worry (t(43) = 2.42, 
p ≤ 0.02), and PDSQ-GAD symptoms (t(43) = 2.01 p ≤ 0.0504) at baseline than those who dropped out (n = 16), 
supporting the feasibility of interventions in those with even higher levels of worry.

Although the participants in this trial did not meet criteria for AGAD, quantified by scores at or above cut 
scores for both the PSWQ and PDSQ-GAD subscale, the mean PSWQ for both groups was ≥ 45, indicating some 
elevated worry. Very little information exists regarding the prevalence of elevated worry among young adults. 
Although recruitment for these trials targeted individuals with and without AGAD, and, as much as possible, 
aimed to shield the overall hypothesis and focus of the trial from participants, recruitment for the trial may have 
attracted a larger proportion of worried individuals. Of the 93 participants who completed the baseline screening, 
49 (53 %) met AGAD criteria, indicating a prevalence of worry in the small population of potential participants. 
However, among the non-AGAD participants, the mean PDSQ-GAD scores in both conditions were well below 
established cut scores sensitive and specific to GAD.

Although meta-analytic evidence has not supported that significant improvements in strength are required 
for mental health  benefit5,35, as anticipated, participants showed large significant improvements in strength (all 
d ≥ 1.53). These associated strength changes may have important implications. For example, physical health and 
performance variables explain significant variation in physical activity among older adults with probable GAD 
beyond variation explained by sociodemographics and other health  behaviours36, and increased grip strength 
is associated with lower odds of developing  GAD37. Given that GAD risk typically arises during the teen years 
and progresses relatively  linearly38, RET interventions targeting these age groups, who may otherwise not be 
engaging in any muscle strengthening activity, are particularly important. In the United States, 70% of adults do 
not meet WHO muscle strengthening  guidelines39.

Due to the progressive increase in weight of the RET protocol, participants engaged in the largest dose of 
RET at the end of the intervention, when their improvements in strengths allowed them to engage in more 
intense RET. Meta-analytic evidence supports a dose–response relationship between physical activity and anxi-
ety  epidemiologically40 and  experimentally5; consistent with this previous evidence, effect sizes in this trial were 
largest at the end of the intervention (d = 0.85) when the dose was largest. Previous meta-analytic evidence 
indicated that the anxiolytic effects of RET were not moderated by features of the RET  stimulus5. There currently 
are no RET guidelines for mental health. As such, this investigation focused on pre-existing WHO and ACSM 
guidelines for RET for physical health. To further examine dose, future trials should rigorously report details 
of the RET stimulus, and randomize participants to RET of low, moderate, and vigorous intensity to explore 
intensity and dose–response as moderators of the anxiolytic effect of RET. RET trials of varying intensities and 
frequencies may also identify the minimum effective dose, and maximal tolerated dose of RET for anxiety and 
worry symptoms among healthy individuals and individuals with a physical or mental illness.

Though identifying mechanisms of action was beyond the scope of the present investigation, there are several 
potential social and psychobiological mechanisms that may explain why these large magnitude reductions in 
anxiety occurred in non-anxiety disordered young adults engaging in an RET intervention. Although social 
interaction was rigorously  controlled14, RET participants may have benefited from the increased amount of 
social interaction during the exercise bouts, as every bout was supervised. Other putative mechanisms include 
the expectancy of improved mental health following  exercise41, or feelings of mastery following the progressive 
increases in  strength42. Due to the progressive nature of the RET protocol, participants continuously achieved 
goals set by themselves relative to weight/reps on individual exercises. These achievements could have improved 
self-efficacy, which possibly mediated the relationship between exercise and anxiety reductions through produc-
ing mastery experiences. It is important to note that although progress on lifts was documented to appropriately 
increase resistance, no RET goals were set by investigators, or formalized in any capacity. Psychobiological

More research is needed regarding the specific mechanisms underlying exercise effects on anxiety and worry, 
particularly those that may be unique to RET. Potential RET specific mechanisms include increases in IGF-1)44 
and reductions in inflammation during  RET45. Evidence from animal models for RET effects on anxiety-like 
behaviour are limited, as there are several design issues related to how to most appropriately model RET in 
rodents. Common models, such as tail-weighted ladder climbs, may be anxiogenic, as they often involve shock 
during  training46. Unlike aerobic exercise, in which wheel-running fairly accurately reflects aerobic exercise 
engagement, there are less homologous RET models for rodents. However, new models, such as burrowing, or 
unweighted tower climbing, are  emerging47.

The anxiety and worry reductions found here are generalizable to the larger population. Compared to wait-list, 
the anxiety reductions for RET expressed as a function of absolute risk  reduction26 resulted in a NNT of three, 
such that anxiety reductions would be expected to occur for at least one of every three participants who would 
engage in this ecologically-valid RET. The population of young adults age 18–40 y in Ireland is ~ 1.5  million48. If 
the entirety of the population were compliant with guidelines-based RET, anxiety reductions demonstrated here 
would be expected to occur in approximately 500,000 young adults. Although it would be logistically impossible 
to provide one-on-one RET at such a large scale, there are innumerable ways to engage in ACSM and WHO 
guidelines-based RET at minimal cost and equipment needs.

Although this trial was sufficiently powered to detect small-to-moderate reductions in worry, future trials 
would benefit from larger sample sizes to explore potential sex-related response differences to RET, and plausi-
ble mediators/moderators of response. To ensure safety, compliance, rigorous delivery of the RET intervention, 
and control for social interaction, each session had to be coordinated between the participant, supervisor, and 
facility availability. For all missed sessions, an attempt was made to make-up the sessions at a later time/day in 
the week to ensure maximum compliance. This can be particularly burdensome with a limited staff of investiga-
tors continuously available to adjust to participant schedules. Participants who could not fit a session into their 
schedule that week were not asked to engage in the RET on their own; however, at the expense of controlling for 
social interaction, future trials could incorporate a home-based, guidelines-based resistance-band/body weight 
supplemented exercise protocol to maximize RET compliance when sessions must be missed. Additionally, 
although pain was assessed with a 10-point Likert scale following each exercise as a component of trial fidelity 
and safety, GAD often co-occurs with  pain49, and other dimensions of pain were not assessed. Physical activity 
is associated with pain indirectly via symptoms of panic and somatization  disorder50; failing to measure and 
examine prevalence of persistent pain and pain response to RET is a limitation.

Conclusions
Ecologically-valid, guidelines-based RET significantly improved anxiety symptoms among young adults. Future 
trials should replicate and expand these findings to explore sex-related differences, examine putative biological, 
cognitive, and psychological mechanisms for the anxiolytic effects of RET, and augment other established treat-
ments for anxiety, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy, with RET.
