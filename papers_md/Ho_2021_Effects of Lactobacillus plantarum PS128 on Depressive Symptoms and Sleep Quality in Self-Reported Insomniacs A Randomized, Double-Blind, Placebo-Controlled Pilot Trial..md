Abstract: Recent animal studies have supported that Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) can reduce
the severity of anxiety and depression. However, previous studies did not focus on the sleep quality
and mood of humans. This study determines whether PS128 reduces the severity of anxiety and
depressive symptoms, regulates autonomic nervous system function, and improves sleep quality.
Forty participants between 20 and 40 years of age with self-reported insomnia were randomly
assigned to two groups, a PS128 group and a placebo group, in a double-blind trial. Participants
took two capsules of either PS128 or a placebo after dinner for 30 days. Study measures included
subjective depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep questionnaires, and miniature-polysomnography
recordings at baseline and on the 15th and 30th days of taking capsules. Overall, all outcomes were
comparable between the two groups at baseline and within the 30-day period, yet some differences
were still found. Compared to the control group, the PS128 group showed signiﬁcant decreases in
Beck Depression Inventory-II scores, fatigue levels, brainwave activity, and awakenings during the
deep sleep stage. Their improved depressive symptoms were related to changes in brain waves and
sleep maintenance. These ﬁndings suggest that daily administration of PS128 may lead to a decrease
in depressive symptoms, fatigue level, cortical excitation, and an improvement in sleep quality
during the deep sleep stage. Daily consumption of PS128 as a dietary supplement may improve the
depressive symptoms and sleep quality of insomniacs, although further investigation is warranted.

1. Introduction

The microbiota–gut–brain axis is a bidirectional link involving the central nervous
system, the enteric nervous system, and the gut microbiota. Accumulated evidence has
demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in maintaining gastrointestinal home-
ostasis, boosting immune system, promoting nutrient absorption, etc. [1]. It also has
become a potential therapeutic target for psychiatric disorders, such as depression [2],
Parkinson’s disease [3], and dementia [4]. The effect of microbiota on the brain occurs
through three main pathways of the microbiota–gut–brain axis: hormones and neurotrans-
mitters, the immune system, and the vagus nerve [5]. One possible approach to actively
modulate the gut microbiota to improve health is through probiotics, which are deﬁned
as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health
beneﬁt on the host” [6]. In addition, certain probiotics identiﬁed as “psychobiotics” can

regulate the microbiota–gut–brain axis and bring health beneﬁts to patients with mental
illness, which holds promise for the treatment of insomnia [7].

Insomnia affects daily activities by causing inattention and drowsiness. The prevalence
of insomnia is estimated to be 10−60% of the population [8]. Up to 40% of insomniacs also
suffer from psychiatric disorders, with depression and anxiety being the most common [9].
Depression is more than just sadness, but a lack of energy and markedly diminished
interest [10]. As for anxiety, it is “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried
thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure [11].” Other than that, most
insomnia diagnoses are based on patient-reported symptoms. The diagnostic criteria in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) for insomnia
disorders includes at least one of the following [12]: difﬁculty initiating sleep, difﬁculty in
maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening with inability to return to sleep. Chronic
insomnia is diagnosed when a patient has any of these conditions for at least three nights a
week for three months or longer.

Current treatments for insomnia are either risky or only gradually effective. Often
taken for their rapid effect, sleeping pills are prescribed to millions of patients every
year [12], and none of these sedative-hypnotic drugs are risk free [13]. Common negative
side effects include addiction, fatigue, and long-term alterations in brainwave activity [14].
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is regarded as the non-medical treatment
that best improves sleep quality and is the ﬁrst-line treatment for chronic insomnia, with
an efﬁcacy that is unquestionable [15]. However, patients consider it too time-consuming,
complicated, and not much more effective than medication [16], and the premature dropout
rate of CBT-I is approximately 40% [17]. In addition, untreated insomnia may carry a signif-
icant economic cost, besides complications such as depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular
disease [9]. Therefore, ﬁnding a safe and convenient treatment would provide substan-
tial beneﬁts. Although the exact cause of insomnia is unknown, many studies support
the hyper-arousal theory [18], which states that insomnia results from a dysfunctional
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [19]. The HPA axis plays a central role in
the stress response, and is also involved in digestion, endocrine activity, immunity, and
mood. Evidence shows that during sleep, insomniacs have increased high-frequency elec-
troencephalogram (EEG) activity, adrenocorticotropic hormone (which stimulates cortisol
release) levels, heart rates, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity compared to
healthy people [20,21]. Moreover, neurotransmitters also seem to play a role in insom-
nia. Insomniacs often have an imbalance of neurotransmitters that drive the sleep-wake
cycle [22]. These include those that induce sleep, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), adenosine, and melatonin, and those that promote waking, such as noradrenaline,
serotonin, acetylcholine, orexin, and dopamine.

Sleep is closely related to the gastrointestinal microbiota. Factors such as sleep depri-
vation [23], working night shifts [24], and circadian disorders [25] can change the structure
of gastrointestinal microbiota and circadian gene expression. Some research has shown
that supplemental probiotics can enhance sleep quality or relieve stress [26–29], but most
of these studies only measured sleep quality using subjective questionnaires. In addition to
subjective measures, we used miniature polysomnography (PSG), which provides the most
direct objective assessment of sleep architecture. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128TM)
is a psychobiotic strain developed in Taiwan [30]. Preclinical studies have shown that
PS128 can increase levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain to ameliorate psychiatric
symptoms in rodents [31,32]. Therefore, we hypothesized that PS128 can enhance sleep
quality by ameliorating mood and reducing cortical excitation in self-reported insomniacs.
Therefore, we conducted this study to determine (i) whether there is a relationship between
PS128 and depressive symptoms or anxiety, (ii) whether PS128 could regulate the ANS
by reducing the sympathetic nervous system and increasing the parasympathetic nervous
system during sleep, (iii) whether PS128 could improve sleep quality by increasing sleep
efﬁciency, maintaining sleep duration, and decreasing sleep latency, and (iv) whether the
change in sleep quality is related to mood.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experiment Design

This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled pilot trial. During the
screening period, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), health habits, and
medical history of all participants were recorded. Participants completed a sleep log for
one week to record their daily schedules and sleep habits. They wore an electrocardiogram
(ECG) patch all day to objectively measure their sleep-wake cycle, and an oximeter during
sleep to exclude sleep apnea. After the ﬁrst week, all participants were evaluated by
miniature-PSG for two nights, to objectively assess their sleep quality. Participants came
to the sleep laboratory at night to afﬁx the miniature-PSG before returning home to sleep.
For the ﬁrst night, the miniature-PSG was worn only for adaptation. Baseline data were
collected during the second night. A day was selected in which participants were evaluated
by PSG at midday (three hours) to exclude other potential sleep problems.

After the above evaluations, participants started taking two capsules of either PS128
or placebo after dinner for 30 days. On the 15th and 30th days after they started taking
the capsules, participants were evaluated by miniature-PSG as mid-test and end-test data.
On the day of the miniature-PSG recording, the visual analogue scale (VAS) [33] was
used to assess the relaxation level, fatigue level, and sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI) [34] and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [35] were used to evaluate
subjective sleep quality and insomnia severity. Daytime sleepiness was measured using the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [36], depression was assessed using the Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II) [37], anxiety levels were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory
(BAI) [38] and the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI), and circadian rhythm was assessed
using the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) [39]. The study schedule is
shown in Figure 1.

All participants were instructed to continue maintaining their sleep log and to avoid
all the other probiotic products or antibiotics during the entire study period. They were
also instructed not to consume caffeine on the day of baseline measurement, and days
15 and 30. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Yang
Ming Chiao Tung University, and registered through ClinicalTrials.gov with identiﬁer
NCT04592276. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrolment.

2.2. Participants

Self-reported insomniacs were included if they met the following inclusion criteria:
(i) aged 20–40 years; (ii) 18.5 < BMI < 25; (iii) systolic BP < 140 mmHg and diastolic
BP < 90 mmHg; (iv) PSQI > 5, ISI >13; and (v) met the DSM-5 criteria for chronic primary
insomnia. The ﬁfth recruiting criterion of self-reported insomniacs was based on previous
studies [40–42]. At the ﬁrst screening, we conﬁrmed that the patients’ duration of sleep
problems was not shorter than three months, and that they had not sought any medical
treatments. [39–41]. Potential participants were excluded if they had (i) used other probiotic

Nutrients 2021, 13, 2820

products within the last two weeks; (ii) antibiotic treatment within the last month; (iii)
taken sleep medication within the last two months, or were on long-term use; (iv) reported
tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, or drug addiction; (v) lactic acid bacteria allergy; (vi) cancer,
cardiovascular disease, psychiatric illness, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or other sleep
disorders; (vii) inﬂammatory bowel disease; (viii) hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal tract
surgery; or (ix) worked night shifts.

2.3. Test Capsules

PS128 and placebo capsules were provided by Bened Biomedical Co. Ltd. (Taipei,
Taiwan). Each participant received a jar containing 60 capsules. Each PS128 capsule
contained 3 × 1010 colony-forming units with microcrystalline cellulose. The placebo
capsules contained only microcrystalline cellulose. Each PS128 or placebo capsule weighed
425 ± 25 mg and had the same appearance. Both were distributed and stored at 4 ◦C. The
participants were asked to keep the jar in the refrigerator. Each jar had different numbers,
and the numbers were used to determine each participant’s allocation group once the trial
ended. Compliance was conﬁrmed by the unused capsules returned by the participants.

2.4. Measurement and Analysis of Miniature-PSG

Miniature-PSG (TD1, Taiwan Telemedicine Device Company) [43,44] can detect four-
channel electrophysiological signals (electrooculogram, EOG; electromyogram, EMG; EEG;
ECG). It measures 5.2 × 3.1 × 1.2 cm and weighs 1 g. According to the International
10–20 system, EEG electrodes are placed at the C3-A2. The EOG electrodes were placed
1cm below and lateral to the left outer canthus, and 1 cm above and lateral to the right
outer canthus. A pair of EMG electrodes was placed side by side on the chin. The ECG
electrode was placed on the V5 site of the chest. Respectively, the EEG, EOG, EMG, and
ECG were ampliﬁed to 2000, 1000, 1000, and 250, and ﬁltered at 0.34–53 Hz, 0.034–53 Hz,
16–113 Hz, and 1.6–113 Hz. These signals were synchronously digitized with a resolution
of 12 bit with different sampling rates.

The raw data were converted into the European Data Format, and then analyzed with
RemLogic 2.0 software (Embla System Inc., Broomﬁeld, CO, USA) by a qualiﬁed sleep
technician who was blinded to participant allocation. The sleep timeline was divided into
30 s epochs. The sleep staging guidelines were based on the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine 2017 manual, which scores sleep into four stages: rapid eye movement (REM)
and non-rapid eye movement stages 1 (N1), N2, and N3. Sleep parameters recorded were
total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), sleep
efﬁciency (SE), number of awakenings, and arousal index.

2.5. EEG Power Spectral Analysis

The EEG spectral analysis during sleep was analyzed as previously described [43,44].
The EEG signals were calculated and truncated into continuous 64 s time segments with
50% overlapping. The power density of the spectral components was estimated with a
non-parametric fast Fourier transform. First, the baseline drift of the signal was eliminated
to prevent low-frequency interference. Then, a Hamming window was applied to each
time segment to minimize the leakage effect. After that, we corrected the resulting power
spectrum for attenuation caused by sampling and applying the Hamming window. The
power density spectrum was quantiﬁed by integration, and the power of each frequency
band of EEG power was as follows: delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), and
beta (13–32 Hz). Another EEG index used was the normalized EEG power (e.g., beta%),
which was calculated as the power at a given frequency band divided by the total power
(0.5–32 Hz). For further spectrograms of EEG, please refer to the previous study conducted
by our laboratory [43].

2.6. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

HRV is measured by variations in the R-R interval, between successive peaks of the
QRS complex in the ECG wave. Based on fast Fourier transform, time-domain (R-R interval)
transfer to frequency domain resulting in total power (TP, 0.0−0.4 Hz), low frequency (LF,
0.04−0.15 Hz), high frequency (HF, 0.15−0.4 Hz), and normalized LF (LF%) were obtained.
LF% and HF represent an index of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic activity,
respectively [44,45].

2.7. Statistical Analysis

The primary outcomes of the present study were the differences in sleep EEG before
and after the consumption of probiotics, compared to the placebo group. The secondary
outcomes included BDI-II, BAI, PSQI, ISI, ESS, HRV, VAS, and STAI. All statistical analyses
were conducted using SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Background characteristics
were compared between groups using the t-test. EEG data, HRV data, and questionnaires
were compared between study groups using generalized estimating equations (GEE).
Sleep structure, brainwaves, and HRV data were adjusted for age and sex. Subjective
questionnaires and objective parameters were analyzed by one-way repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) within groups. PSQI data were assessed using the paired
t-test within groups. The differences within groups at days 15 and 30 were compared to
baseline or zero by 95% interval analysis. The correlations between the (cid:52)BDI-II score and
objective parameters were analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation.

3. Results

Participants were recruited from October 2018 to December 2019. Of the 202 partici-
pants who were initially interested in the study, 80 were excluded for not meeting all the
inclusion criteria. In total, 77 stopped replying, and ﬁve dropped out before taking any
capsules. The remaining 40 participants were randomly allocated to either the PS128 or
placebo group; 21 participants in the PS128 group and 19 participants in the placebo group
were included in the ﬁnal analysis. The participant ﬂow diagram is shown in Figure 2. Both
study groups were further divided into subgroups of insomniac (Inso) and misperception
(Mis). This was based on the participants’ SOL or WASO, with 30 min as a cut-off point.
Within the placebo group, 9 were identiﬁed as Inso and 10 as Mis. Within the PS128 group,
12 were identiﬁed as Inso and 9 as Mis. Blinding was conﬁrmed at the end of the study by
asking each participant to guess the treatment received. Additionally, the majority of the
tested capsules had been used; the participants’ compliance rate was more than 98%, and
no harmful events related to test capsule intake were reported.

The background characteristics of the 40 eligible participants are shown in Table 1. The
study participants were predominantly female, and BDI-II and BAI scores showed that they
experienced depression and anxiety at mild to normal levels of severity. The participants’
circadian rhythms were in between morning and evening types, based on the MEQ. None
of the parameters that were assessed differed between the PS128 and placebo groups.
However, in the subgroups, the BMI of Mis participants was signiﬁcantly lower in the
PS128 group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05), and the PSQI scores of Inso participants
were signiﬁcantly higher in the PS128 group than in the control group (p < 0.05).

3.1. Effects of PS128 on Subjective Parameters

The PSQI (both groups: p < 0.01, day 30 versus baseline) and ISI scores (control group:
day 15, p < 0.05, day 30 < 0.01 versus baseline; PS128 group: day 15 and day 30 < 0.01
versus baseline) of both the PS128 and placebo groups decreased signiﬁcantly, but showed
no signiﬁcant difference between groups. The ESS scores of the control group signiﬁcantly
decreased at days 15 and 30 (day 15 < 0.05, day 30 < 0.01) compared to baseline. The PS128
group appeared to be decreased at day 30 (p = 0.064) compared to baseline. The fatigue
level on VAS before sleep in the control group showed a signiﬁcant increase at day 30.

The BDI-II and BAI scores of the PS128 group decreased signiﬁcantly from baseline
after taking capsules for 30 days, and when compared with the control group, the test

group showed a signiﬁcant reduction in BDI-II scores. No difference was observed between
the placebo and PS128 groups regarding PSQI, ISI, ESS, and BAI scores (Figure 3, Table S1).

3.2. Effects of PS128 on Sleep EEG

Comparing day 30 to baseline, both All and Inso PS128 participants awoke signiﬁcantly
fewer times during N3, compared with those taking a placebo (Figure 4). Within the control
group, Inso participants showed signiﬁcantly decreased total time in bed and REM%, and
increased N3% compared to baseline. Between groups, N3% of the control group was
signiﬁcantly higher than that of the PS128 group (Figures 4 and 5, Table S2).

the PS128 and placebo groups and between the Inso and Mis groups. We subsequently
compared brainwaves between the two groups in more detail, by dividing overall sleep
into N1, N2, N3, and REM. During N1, the theta power % of the PS128 group on day
15 was signiﬁcantly decreased (p < 0.05 versus control group), and delta power % was
greatly increased; however, this change did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (p = 0.076
versus control group). Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant difference in N2, N3, and
REM. On day 15 and day 30, the beta power %, alpha power %, and theta power % of the
PS128 group were lower than those of the control group, whereas the delta power % was
higher. In REM, delta power % of the PS128 group on day 15 was a borderline signiﬁcant
increase (Table S3).

At baseline, the TP and LF values of the two groups showed signiﬁcant differences. At
the end of the study, no signiﬁcant differences were found between the control and PS128
groups for TP, HF, LF, and LF% (Table S4).

3.4. Correlation between Changes in Objective Parameters and BDI-II Scores

When determining correlations involving BDI-II scores, we calculated the difference
((cid:52)) in scores as the score on day 0 minus the score on day 30. The BDI-II score was
improved if it was greater than zero ((cid:52)BDI-II > 0). (cid:52)BDI-II in the PS128 group was

Nutrients 2021, 13, 2820

positively correlated with the (cid:52)awakening numbers-REM, (cid:52)arousal numbers-N2, (cid:52)beta
power %, and (cid:52)alpha power %. BDI scores in the PS128 group were negatively correlated
with (cid:52)delta power%. In the control group, (cid:52)BDI-II scores were only negatively correlated
with (cid:52)sleep latency-N3 (Figure 6).

4. Discussion

This pilot study examined whether the use of PS128 could reduce the severity of
anxiety and depression symptoms, adjust ANS function, and improve the sleep quality
of self-reported insomniacs. The results showed that participants in the PS128 group
experienced fewer depressive symptoms and fatigue, less frequent awakening and arousal,
and decreased high-frequency brain wave activity. The objective parameters indicated
more stable sleep in the PS128 group than in the control group. These ﬁndings are similar
to Armitage’s results [46], in which insomniacs reporting poor sleep were more depressed
and had higher alpha wave levels than healthy participants. Those experiencing less stress
also had higher delta wave levels. Moreover, BDI-II and BAI scores in the PS128 group
improved throughout the study period, suggesting prolonged amelioration of depressive
symptoms and anxiety with regular consumption of PS128.

PS128 as a psychobiotic has shown some beneﬁcial effects on mental disorders, such as
the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The probiotic product has been reported to ameliorate
anxiety, hyperactivity, impulse, and opposition/deﬁance behaviors [47], and has more
positive effects in children than adolescents with ASD [48]. Combined with oxytocin

Nutrients 2021, 13, 2820

11 of 15

treatment, PS128 increases ASD patients’ favorable gut microbiome network hubs [49].
Furthermore, it may have a potential beneﬁt for mood disorders, as the main ﬁnding of
this study suggested that PS128 may be able to reduce depressive symptoms in insomniacs.
This is consistent with previous studies on PS128 [31,50]. Although the study did not test
biochemical markers, a previous study on PS128 found that its use can increase dopamine
and serotonin levels in the brain of mice. These two neurotransmitters are affected by
common antidepressant drugs [51], and are classiﬁed as excitatory neurotransmitters in the
ﬁeld of sleep medicine. They may inhibit GABA neurons and activate the cortex, causing
sleep disturbance [52]. However, the speciﬁc role of serotonin on sleep is still unclear.
Other research has found contrasting results and showed that a stimulated serotonergic
system can promote the onset of sleep in zebraﬁsh and mice [53]. In addition, it may
turn into melatonin at night to help shorten sleep latency [54]. Hence, the time of day
at which PS128 is taken may be crucial to its effect on sleep quality. In this study, the
VAS fatigue level before sleep indicated that the control group felt signiﬁcantly more tired
on day 30 than on day 0, and that there was a signiﬁcant difference between the two
groups. Normally, increased levels of dopamine within the brain promote alertness and
sleep disturbances. Alternatively, dopamine deﬁciency results in fatigue and demotivation.
However, a literature review [55] has shown that administering a low dose of a D-2
dopamine receptor agonist will produce a sedative effect, reduce wakefulness, and increase
slow-wave and REM sleep. A large dose, on the other hand, induces the opposite effect. As
mentioned previously, preclinical studies have shown that PS128 adjusts brain dopamine
levels and enhances exercise performance in triathletes [56]. By taking PS128, participants
in the intervention group may have avoided fatigue, as the psychobiotic modulated their
dopamine levels. However, we were not able to measure brain dopamine levels in human
subjects, so we could not determine whether PS128(cid:48)s beneﬁcial effects on mental health
were due to dopamine modulation by the gastrointestinal microbiota.

Compared to the control group, no sleep efﬁcacy of PS128 could be found in the
miniature-PSG report, which included some commonly used indices to determine sleep
quality, such as SOL, SE, or duration of sleep stages, with the exception of the numbers of
wakening in N3. However, PS128 may decrease cortical excitation states. Compared to the
control group, delta power percentage was higher in the PS128 group during each stage of
sleep, while beta, alpha, and theta power percentages were typically lower during all stages
except N1. During N1, especially on day 15, theta wave percentage decreased and delta
wave percentage increased in the PS128 compared to the control group. This suggests that
PS128 may play a role in changing theta waves into delta waves to promote sleep quality
in N1. The same result was seen during REM. The PS128 group had a lower theta wave
percentage and a higher delta wave percentage. Previous studies [57,58] indicated that
one function of REM is emotional memory storage. Memories that have been temporarily
stored in the hippocampus are transferred during REM into the neocortex. This process
creates theta waves and may explain the mood-improving effect seen when taking PS128.
The microbiome is unique to each individual. Speciﬁc probiotics may affect each per-
son differently. A study investigating the effects of Lactobacillus casei Shirota on 132 subjects
showed that probiotics only affect those whose mood was initially poor [59]. Thus, we
analyzed the correlation between changes in objective parameters and BDI-II scores. We
found that when depressive symptoms were alleviated in the PS128 group, beta power
percentage and alpha power percentage were reduced, while delta power percentage was
increased. In other words, those who respond to PS128 may have less cortical excitation
and deep sleep. However, the mechanism by which probiotics affect brainwaves is still
unknown. These changes were not observed in the control group. It seems that an outlier
among an already small group of trial subjects may have skewed the results.

In addition, there was no signiﬁcant change between groups or between baseline and
treatment in HRV analysis. According to the HPA theory, stress and mood can activate the
HPA, release stress hormones, and increase sympathetic activity. During sleep, HF will

Nutrients 2021, 13, 2820

12 of 15

increase and LF% will decrease. The HRV results suggested that PS128 may not affect HPA
and ANS functions.

Both groups had signiﬁcantly decreased PSQI and ISI scores, and the placebo effect
might partially explain this result. Probiotic products are commonly accepted in Taiwan,
and people believe that probiotics can improve their health. A previous study [60] using
magnetic resonance imaging to test the probiotic effect on mood showed that even the
placebo group displayed a noticeable change in the image. As for the measurements, PSQI,
ISI, and ESS are some frequently used outcomes in clinical trials, and have certain degrees
of reliability and validity [61]. Nevertheless, in the present study, the questionnaires used
were all based on self-report, and such measures might not be optimal. The accuracy
of self-report measures has long been criticized by psychologists and psychiatrists. Self-
reports can easily be subject to context, rapport, and memory bias, etc. Most importantly,
the changes in scores cannot be accurately quantiﬁed from one individual to another [62].
Another relevant ﬁnding of the study is that while PSQI and ISI showed signiﬁcant changes
compared to the baseline, the EEG sleep data did not comply with these questionnaires.
This discrepancy was consistent with previous studies [63]. Due to the reasons above, we
used the EEG data as a primary outcome and the questionnaires as a secondary outcome.
This study has several limitations. First, intestinal microbiome analysis was not carried
out, so we could not conﬁrm whether the probiotic formulation effectively colonized
the gut. Internal conditions could cause PS128 to lose probiotic activity. Second, the
insufﬁcient sample size might not be able to provide strong statistical evidence to explain
the results. The present study consisted of a double-blind randomized design, but the
lack of a cross-over design could be a serious limitation when the sample size was so
limited. Consequently, a larger sample size is needed for further studies. Third, the results
may not be generalizable to other populations because of the small sample size, only
recruiting healthy young participants, or the non-response bias resulting from seventy-
seven participants’ not replying to our email to conﬁrm enrolment in the study. Fourth, the
EEG analysis improperly included sigma activity (12–15 Hz), which mostly corresponds
to sleep spindles within the alpha and beta power. Fifth, the diet may be a limitation. We
did not restrict or record the diet of the participants throughout the intervention. We only
advised the subjects not to consume caffeine on the day of the miniature-PSG measurement.
Finally, participants were instructed to take the capsule after dinner, and the timing of this
varied among the participates. So far, we still do not know whether the PS128 needs time
to show its effect on the body. However, this study has its advantages. The study was a
double-blind trial that prevented researchers from making the wrong conclusions, as the
questionnaires showed signiﬁcant changes in both the PS128 and the control group. In
addition, few psychobiotic studies use EEG to measure insomniacs’ brainwaves during
sleep. Moreover, we used EEG twice during the baseline to minimize the ﬁrst-night effect.

5. Conclusions

Generally, the two groups showed similar results, though some differences were
found. Our ﬁndings suggested that daily administration of PS128 may lead to a decrease
in depressive symptoms, cortical excitation, and fatigue level and an improvement in the
quality of deep sleep. PS128 was not found to have a signiﬁcant effect on ANS function.
Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying
the effects of PS128 in alleviating depressive symptoms and cortical excitation, and to
determine whether the timing of PS128 intake affects objective sleep quality.
