Prior differences in previous trauma exposure primarily drive the 
observed racial/ethnic differences in posttrauma depression and 
anxiety following a recent trauma

Abstract

Background:  Racial and ethnic groups in the United States differ in the prevalence of 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent research however has not observed consistent racial/
ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress in the early aftermath of trauma, suggesting that such 
differences in chronic PTSD rates may be related to differences in recovery over time.

Methods:  As part of the multisite, longitudinal AURORA study, we investigated racial/ethnic 
differences in PTSD and related outcomes within three months after trauma. Participants (n=930) 
were recruited from emergency departments across the US and provided periodic (2-weeks, 
8-weeks, and 3-months after trauma) self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, dissociation, 
anxiety, and resilience. Linear models were completed to investigate racial/ethnic differences in 
posttraumatic dysfunction with subsequent follow-up models assessing potential effects of prior 
life stressors.

Results:  Racial/ethnic groups did not differ in symptoms over time, however Black participants 
showed reduced posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms overall compared to Hispanic 
participants and White participants. Racial/ethnic differences were not attenuated after accounting 
for differences in sociodemographic factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in depression 
and anxiety were no longer significant after accounting for greater prior trauma exposure and 
childhood emotional abuse in White participants.

Conclusions:  The present findings suggest prior differences in previous trauma exposure 
partially mediate the observed racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety 
symptoms following a recent trauma. Our findings further demonstrate that racial/ethnic groups 
show similar rates of symptom recovery over time. Future work utilizing longer time-scale data is 
needed to elucidate potential racial/ethnic differences in long-term symptom trajectories.

Introduction

Psychiatric illness prevalence within the United States, particularly trauma and stress-related 
disorders, varies by racial and ethnic groups. While racial and ethnic categories are not 
true biological divisions in humans, individuals are racialized into these groups by virtue of

their societal systems which in turn affects mental health. For example, Black individuals 
typically show lower rates of internalizing disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), anxiety, and depression compared to White individuals (Breslau et al., 2006; 
Kessler et al., 2005). Although the prior work highlights race-related differences in the 
prevalence of posttraumatic dysfunction, limited work to date has investigated racial/ethnic 
differences in symptoms that present in the early aftermath of trauma. Recent research 
demonstrates peritraumatic responses to traumatic events may be indicative of later chronic 
dysfunction or may map onto other discernable trajectories of trauma recovery/deterioration 
(Bonanno & Mancini, 2012; Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013; Shalev et al., 2019). There is a 
paucity of research on potential racial/ethnic variability in peritraumatic responses or the 
trajectories of trauma symptoms in first several months after trauma which may impact the 
generalizability or accuracy of predictive models of susceptibility to posttraumatic disorders. 
The purpose of the present analysis is to characterize potential racial/ethnic differences in 
the trajectories of trauma-related disorder symptoms in the early aftermath of trauma.

Prior epidemiological data suggests that White individuals report greater exposure to any 
traumatic event and childhood physical abuse compared to Black or Hispanic individuals 
(Roberts, Gilman, Breslau, Breslau, & Koenen, 2011). Exposure to prior traumatic events is 
a major predictor of subsequent PTSD development following a later trauma and thus may 
be related to greater rates of PTSD in White individuals (Gould et al., 2021). However, 
global epidemiological data highlights that the type of prior traumatic event (such as 
violence victimization) also influences subsequent PTSD development (Kessler et al., 2018; 
Liu et al., 2017). Importantly, Black and Hispanic individuals generally experience more 
childhood adversities, community violence exposure, and exposure to other environmental 
inequities that impact health (Maguire-Jack, Lanier, & Lombardi, 2019; Sheats et al., 2018; 
Slopen et al., 2016; Williams & Collins, 2001; Williams, Mohammed, Leavell, & Collins, 
2010). Further, Black individuals often have less wealth and lower income compared to 
White individuals and higher income may afford access to systems that can attenuate the 
consequences of traumatic events (e.g., healthcare access) and buffer against the financial 
and social consequences of trauma (Cook, Trinh, Li, Hou, & Progovac, 2017; Herring 
& Henderson, 2016; Yearby, 2018). As discussed, these types of traumatic experiences 
are also associated with high conditional risk of PTSD after experiencing a subsequent 
trauma (Powers, Fani, Cross, Ressler, & Bradley, 2016; Yehuda, Halligan, & Grossman, 
2001). Thus, the on-average greater disadvantage experienced by minority group individuals 
may contribute to greater posttraumatic dysfunction. However, racial/ethnic minority groups 
generally report a lower prevalence of PTSD (Breslau et al., 2006; Kessler et al., 2005), and 
thus non-White individuals may in fact show reduced severity of posttraumatic dysfunction 
in the early aftermath of trauma compared to white individuals. Limited work to date, 
however, has investigated racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic symptoms in the early 
aftermath of trauma.

There is some ambiguity as to whether greater resilience to posttraumatic dysfunction may 
be present in non-White individuals in the aftermath of trauma (Muralidharan, Austern, 
Hack, & Vogt, 2016). Some exposures more often experienced by Black and Latinx 
individuals (e.g., chronic neighborhood disadvantage) are not captured well within the 
DSM-5 conceptualization of trauma and may be related to lower reports of PTSD-related

symptoms. However, a component of commonly reported lower PTSD prevalence rates 
may be due to underreporting of symptoms in epidemiological surveys or lower healthcare 
availability or utilization in minority racial groups that impacts survey participation (Cook 
et al., 2017; Miranda, McGuire, Williams, & Wang, 2008). These may partially explain 
why some prior research has observed higher rates of undiagnosed PTSD in disadvantaged 
Black individuals (Davis, Ressler, Schwartz, Stephens, & Bradley, 2008; Parto, Evans, 
& Zonderman, 2011). In addition, a recent report demonstrated that racial discrimination 
experienced by Black individuals was a risk factor for future PTSD symptom development 
after trauma (Bird et al., 2021). Thus, race-related stressors may also exacerbate racial/ethnic 
differences in early PTSD symptoms.

Early prior research from the AURORA study, a multisite longitudinal study of 
posttraumatic outcomes (McLean et al., 2019), have identified factors associated with the 
expression of PTSD and depression symptoms in the early aftermath of trauma such as 
peritraumatic distress and dissociation, or neurophysiological responses (Harnett et al., 
2021; Joormann et al., 2020; Kessler et al., 2020; Steuber et al., 2021). Interestingly, 
the early AURORA work did not identify robust racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic 
symptoms within the first two to eight weeks after trauma. We note however that the 
prior work did not investigate racial/ethnic variation in posttraumatic stress in further 
time points (e.g., 3-months after trauma exposure) or potential relationships with structural 
inequities and prior trauma exposure. Given the dissociation between racial/ethnic variability 
in posttraumatic stress in the early versus long-term aftermath of trauma, it may be 
that differences in symptom expression over time start to emerge in later time points 
(e.g., 3-months posttrauma); however, potential differences in symptom expression have 
not been examined as of yet. Thus, potential racial/ethnic differences in early trauma 
outcomes remains unclear. Characterizing potential racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic 
syndromes over the first several months after trauma is necessary for the development of 
precision medicine approaches to identify individuals susceptible to long-term posttraumatic 
dysfunction.

Therefore, to investigate racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic symptoms in the first 
three months after a traumatic event, we analyzed data from the AURORA study. We first 
compared 2-week, 8-week, and 3-month indices of posttraumatic dysfunction (i.e., PTSD, 
depression, anxiety, or dissociation symptoms) between White, Black, and Hispanic groups. 
Based on prior literature, we hypothesized that Black and Hispanic individuals would show 
lower symptoms of posttraumatic dysfunction over time compared to the White individuals. 
We then examined if controlling for demographic cofactors (e.g., income and employment) 
contributed to observed racial differences in posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, we completed 
follow-up analyses investigating the effect of childhood trauma and other prior traumatic 
events on observed racial differences in posttraumatic symptoms. The present findings 
provide insight into the impact of race/ethnic-related differences in pretraumatic stressors on 
traumatic stress reactions in the aftermath of trauma.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Data from the present analyses were obtained as part of the Freeze 2 psychometric data 
release of the AURORA Study, a multisite longitudinal study of adverse neuropsychiatric 
sequelae. Details of the larger AURORA project are described elsewhere (McLean et al., 
2019). Briefly, trauma-exposed participants were recruited from Emergency Departments 
(EDs, n = 29) from across the United States. Trauma was defined as a medical accident 
requiring admission to the ED, and participants who experienced events such as a motor 
vehicle collision, high fall (>10 feet), physical assault, sexual assault, or mass casualty 
incidents were automatically included in the study. Other trauma exposures were also 
qualifying if: a) the individual responded to a screener question that they experienced 
the exposure as involving actual or threatened serious injury, sexual violence, or death, 
either by direct exposure, witnessing, or learning about the trauma and b) the research 
assistant agreed that the exposure was a plausible qualifying event. Trauma was a 
necessary inclusion criterion for the present study, and no participants without trauma were 
included. The psychometric data included 1,618 participants recruited between 09/25/2017 
and 06/31/2019, however the present analyses were focused on racial/ethnic differences 
in the posttraumatic outcomes. Thus, we excluded participants who did not have data 
on posttraumatic dysfunction (i.e., PTSD, depression, anxiety, dissociation, or resilience 
symptoms) across all timepoints (n = 645). Participants self-reported their race/ethnicity and 
were coded into four categories of “Hispanic” (“Hispanic”; n = 106),” “non-Hispanic White 
(“White”; n = 314),” “non-Hispanic Black (“Black”; n = 510),” and “non-Hispanic other-
race (“Other”; n = 43).” For the present analyses, we also excluded participants from the 
“other” racial category due to small sample size that may impact statistical analyses. In total, 
930 participants had completed assessments of all measures of posttraumatic dysfunction at 
the three timepoints and were included in the present analyses (Table 1). A breakdown of 
the broad class of trauma-types experienced by each group are presented in Table S1. Note, 
there were no significant differences in the racial/ethnic make-up of the included versus 
excluded sample [χ2 (2) = 2.34, p = 0.31]. All participants gave written informed consent as 
approved by each study site’s Institutional Review Board.

Demographic and psychometric data collection

Participant demographic data were collected after admission to the ED which 
included participant marital status, income, education level, employment, and medication 
administered within the ED (see Table S2 for medication and Table S3 for full demographic 
category breakdowns). After discharge, participants’ posttraumatic symptoms were assessed 
at 2-weeks, 8-weeks, and 3-months after trauma exposure (described below). The 2-week 
assessment queried participant symptoms in the past 14 days while the 8-week and 3-month 
assessments queried participant symptoms in the past 30 days. Participants also completed 
retrospective reports within the ED (past 30 days prior to the trauma) of posttraumatic 
dysfunction symptoms.

Measures of posttraumatic dysfunction

Participants’ posttraumatic dysfunction was assessed in terms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, 
and dissociation symptoms. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist 
for DSM-5 (PCL-5) (Weathers, Litz, et al., 2013), a 20-item self-report questionnaire on 
symptom expression and severity. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression instrument 
from the PROMIS short form 8b (Pilkonis et al., 2011). T-scores were derived from total 
responses to eight items scored on a Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Anxiety 
symptoms were assessed using four items from the PROMIS Anxiety Bank (Pilkonis et 
al., 2011). Participants rated how often they felt anxious, worried about things, had trouble 
relaxing, or felt tense on a scale of 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all or almost all of the time) 
and the responses were summed to create a total anxiety score. Dissociation was assessed 
using a modified version of the Brief Dissociative Experiences Survey (Bernstein Carlson 
& Putnam, 1993). Participants were asked to rate how often they felt that people, objects, 
or the world around them seemed unreal and how often they felt they were looking through 
a fog so that people and things seemed unclear on a scale from 1 (none of the time) to 
5 (all or almost all of the time). The sum of the two questions was used as an index of 
dissociation severity. As a contrast to the measures of posttraumatic symptoms, we also 
assessed participants’ psychological resilience using the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 
(CD-RISC) (Connor & Davidson, 2003).

Prior trauma exposure

Prior trauma was assessed using the Life Events Checklist version 5 (LEC-5) (Weathers, 
Blake, et al., 2013). The checklist assessed prior exposure to traumatic events such as 
natural disasters, accidents, assaults, etc. that: a) happened directly to the participant, b) 
were witnessed by the participant, c) the participant learned happened to someone close to 
them, or d) the participant was exposed to details of it due to their occupation. The LEC-5 
was administered during the 8-week assessment. Responses to all questions were summed 
to derive a prior trauma index. We also indexed childhood trauma via 11 items from the 
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire – Short Form (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 2003). Participants 
were asked to rate how often they experienced maltreatment across five domains (emotional 
abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect) from a scale 
of 0 (never true) to 4 (very often true). The CTQ was administered during the 2-week 
assessment.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were completed using a combination of IBM SPSS Statistics version 
24 (Armonk, NY) and the JASP statistical package (https://jasp-stats.org/). Chi-square and 
univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were completed to assess differences in 
demographic factors between the racial/ethnic groups. Our initial research questions were 
focused on racial/ethnic group differences in different posttraumatic outcomes over time. 
We completed sets of linear mixed-effects models with unstructured covariance matrices 
to investigate race-related differences in posttraumatic dysfunction measures across the 
five domains assessed (i.e., PTSD, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and resilience). In

Model set A, time (3 levels) and racial/ethnic group (3 levels) were included as fixed 
factors to assess main effects of racial/ethnic group and differences over time for each 
measure of posttraumatic dysfunction (five models total). In Model set B, covariates for 
age, employment status, income, education, marital status, and medication usage during 
recruitment from the ED were included to determine if race/ethnic differences were 
observed above and beyond base demographic factors. Demographic data were dummy-
coded for inclusion as covariates in linear mixed-effects models (marital status: married 
vs not; income: <= $35,000 vs > $35,000; education: completed high-school or less, 
completed greater than high-school; employment: employed vs not; ED medication: yes 
vs no). Income was dummy-coded based on the median response. We completed separate 
univariate ANOVAs on assessments completed in the ED to determine if racial/ethnic 
differences in posttraumatic dysfunction were potentially driven by pre-trauma symptoms. 
We then repeated Model set A controlling for pre-trauma symptoms and this analysis is 
reported in the supplement. We next sought to determine if other potential pre-trauma factors 
may be related to the observed race-related differences in posttraumatic depression and 
anxiety severity. We focused on prior lifetime and childhood trauma given prior work has 
demonstrated these factors are major risk factors for subsequent PTSD. The prior trauma 
index derived from LEC-5 was used in an ANOVA with racial group as the between-subjects 
factor. To investigate racial/ethnic differences in childhood trauma, subscale scores for the 
five domains of the CTQ assessing emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional 
neglect, and physical neglect were entered in a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) 
with a between-subjects factor for racial group. Prior trauma types that differed significantly 
between the racial/ethnic groups were included in a final linear model as covariates (Model 
set C). Bonferroni corrections were applied to the linear models based on our a priori 
interest in the time by racial group interactions and main effects of racial group (2 contrasts 
per model, 10 total comparisons) and effects were considered statistically significant at an 
adjusted p = 0.005 (0.05/10) per model set.

Results

Race-related differences in participant characteristics

ANOVA and Chi-squared tests were completed to assess racial/ethnic differences in the 
demographic factors (Table 1). Significant differences in age and proportions of sex at 
birth categories were observed between the racial/ethnic groups. No statistically significant 
difference was observed in employment status for the three groups. Racial/ethnic groups 
differed in income status, education, marriage status, and ED medication use. Black and 
Hispanic groups had a greater proportion of participants who were low income, had less 
than an associate’s degree or equivalent, and were not currently or previously married. 
Medication usage in the ED was generally higher for Hispanic participants.

Race-related differences in posttraumatic outcomes

Linear mixed-effects models were completed to assess racial/ethnic differences in PTSD, 
depression, anxiety, dissociation, and resilience scores with and without inclusion of 
covariates (Table 2). We observed significant main effects of racial/ethnic group on 
depression and anxiety scores that persisted when accounting for differences in demographic

factors. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that Black participants showed lower overall 
posttraumatic depression and anxiety severity compared to Hispanic and White participants 
(Table 3). For completeness, exploratory post-hoc comparisons between groups of each 
measure at each timepoint are presented in the supplement (Table S4). Taken together, these 
findings demonstrate that the general severity of post-trauma depression and anxiety are 
lower in recently trauma-exposed Black individuals, and these differences do not appear to 
be driven by differences in general demographic factors.

We completed follow-up exploratory analyses to investigate if racial/ethnic differences 
in posttraumatic dysfunction existed prior to ED admission via the retrospective reports. 
We observed significant main effects of race/ethnicity on depression, dissociation, and 
anxiety symptoms (Table S5). When the original linear mixed-effects models also included 
retrospective reports of posttraumatic dysfunction in the ED, we observed significant main 
effects of race on anxiety symptoms (Table S6; p = 0.028). These findings suggest some 
aspect of the observed racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic dysfunction were driven by 
pre-trauma factors.

Previous trauma exposure and childhood trauma as potential factors

We next investigated racial/ethnic differences in lifetime and childhood trauma as potential 
pre-trauma factors influencing posttraumatic stress symptoms. We observed a significant 
main effect of racial group on prior trauma such that White participants endorsed a greater 
number of traumatic events compared to Hispanic and Black participants (Table 4). Further, 
we observed a significant omnibus effect of racial group [F(10,1776) = 3.97, p < 0.001, 
Wilk’s λ= 0.96]. Follow-up univariate ANOVAs revealed race-related differences were 
specific to emotional abuse, such that White participants reported more emotional abuse 
compared to Black participants. Of note, prior trauma and childhood emotional abuse were 
significantly, but weakly, correlated (r = 0.20, p < 0.001).

Given these findings, we repeated the original linear mixed effects models to account for 
differences in prior trauma and childhood emotional abuse. When accounting for prior 
trauma and emotional abuse, racial/ethnic group was no longer associated with posttraumatic 
depression severity or posttraumatic anxiety (Table 2). Taken together, these findings 
suggest race-related differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety are partially due 
to differences in prior reported trauma exposure.

Discussion

Despite evidence of racial/ethnic differences in the chronic and long-term effects of trauma, 
there are limited data on racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic outcomes in the early 
aftermath of trauma. Within the present analyses of a large sample of Hispanic, White, 
and Black trauma victims, we observed significantly lower posttraumatic depression and 
anxiety symptoms among Black individuals compared to Hispanic and White individuals. 
Racial/ethnic differences in depression and anxiety were not attenuated when controlling for 
differences in socioeconomic indicators or emergency department medication use. However, 
racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic symptoms were attenuated when considering 
differences in prior trauma exposure and childhood emotional neglect. Together, the present

findings illustrate that previous exposure to traumatic stress mediates, in part, racial/ethnic 
differences in depression and anxiety severity in the early aftermath of trauma exposure.

Contrary to our hypotheses, racial/ethnic groups in the present study did not differ in 
trajectories of recovery from posttraumatic dysfunction over time. Instead, Black individuals 
displayed – on average – lower severity of depression and anxiety symptoms than Hispanic 
and White individuals. Prior epidemiological findings suggest that Black and Hispanic 
individuals have lower occurrence of more chronic disorders such as PTSD and depression 
(Kessler et al., 2005); however, earlier analyses utilizing data from the AURORA study did 
not observe racial/ethnic differences in the immediate (i.e., 2-8 weeks) post-trauma phase 
(Joormann et al., 2020; Kessler et al., 2020). Thus, we initially suspected that racial/ethnic 
groups would show differing trajectories in symptom severity over time that may explain 
the discordance between prior research on peri- and- chronic posttrauma outcomes. The 
lack of a significant time by racial/ethnic group interaction may suggest that differences 
in recovery trajectory occur at a longer timescale than what was captured in the current 
analysis (i.e., beyond 3-months). An alternative hypothesis is that posttraumatic dysfunction 
trajectories are not different between groups, but that differences in the assessment of 
prevalence rates of chronic dysfunction across racial/groups partially reflects structural 
inequities. For example, racial/ethnic minority individuals with high symptoms may not 
be included in these assessments due to confounding factors (e.g., lack of resources) that 
limit participation. Further analyses within the growing longitudinal AURORA dataset 
may be able to disentangle posttraumatic trajectories on larger timescales and assess 
potential attrition related confounds contributing to racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic 
outcomes.

Importantly, racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety were largely 
accounted for by differences in prior trauma and childhood emotional abuse. These findings 
are consistent, in part, with prior work showing that lifetime trauma load is a significant 
predictor of later PTSD development (Breslau, Chilcoat, Kessler, & Davis, 1999; Kolassa et 
al., 2010). Further, childhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences are also associated 
with a range of adult mental health outcomes (McLaughlin et al., 2017; Powers et al., 
2016; Schilling, Aseltine, & Gore, 2007). Thus, our data provide support for the model 
that previous trauma exposures contribute to greater posttraumatic dysfunction after a recent 
trauma. Somewhat counterintuitively, however, the greater rates of previous trauma were 
observed in WA participants compared to Hispanic and Black participants. These differences 
are relatively surprising particularly given the greater amounts of structural adversity (e.g., 
lower income and education levels) endorsed by Black and Hispanic groups in the present 
sample.

The disconnect between the present assessment of previous trauma and posttraumatic 
symptoms and previously observed racial differences in traumatic stress leads to several 
potentially interesting hypotheses. On the one hand, it should be considered that the current 
findings may reflect racial/ethnic differences in how individuals from minority groups 
consider or contextualize events as abuse. Racial/ethnic groups globally and within the US 
differ in the use and perception of behaviors typically regarded as abusive (e.g., corporal 
punishment) (Lansford et al., 2015; Taylor, Hamvas, & Paris, 2011). The normalizing

of such behaviors may contribute to a hesitancy or inability to consider the events as 
abusive. As an example, a prior report found that racial/ethnic minority young adults 
report greater emotional abuse (Brown, Fite, Stone, Richey, & Bortolato, 2018). Further, 
racial/ethnic minority youth were less able to identify internal feelings as were those 
with more reported experiences of emotional neglect. These results may suggest that 
childhood maltreatment contributes to difficulty contextualizing abusive behaviors. Thus, 
one speculative hypothesis is that the relatively older adults in the present sample are not 
endorsing events as abusive. On the other hand, the present findings may reflect unique 
aspects of racialized experiences for White, Black, and Hispanic individuals. Contemporary 
models of threat and deprivation (McLaughlin, Sheridan, & Lambert, 2014) conceptualize 
traumatic stressors and abuse as “threats” that are more directly related to the development 
and expression of posttraumatic symptoms (McLaughlin et al., 2017). Conversely, structural 
inequalities such as poverty may reflect “deprivation” and this may have greater impacts on 
future cognitive functioning (Busso, McLaughlin, & Sheridan, 2017). Although cognitive 
performances were not assessed here, our data may partially support this model in that 
White individuals experienced more “threat” and minority individuals experienced more 
“deprivation” and – accordingly – White individuals showed more posttraumatic depression 
and anxiety symptoms. The relative contributions of such threat-deprivation models to 
posttraumatic symptoms in the early aftermath of trauma are still relatively unknown 
and may be one approach to understanding racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic 
dysfunction. Speculatively, both of the proposed mechanisms may be relevant to the present 
results, however it is not possible to disentangle the contributions in the current analyses. 
Nevertheless, the current findings highlight the need to consider pre-trauma factors that may 
contribute to race-related differences in peri-and-post-traumatic responses.

Socioeconomic factors such as education and income did not modulate racial/ethnic 
differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety. Prior work suggests socioeconomic 
factors such as education and income moderate the severity of depression and anxiety 
symptoms and race-related differences in these factors may contribute to racial/ethnic 
differences in mental health (Chen et al., 2019; Everson, Maty, Lynch, & Kaplan, 2002). 
Though not the main focus of the present report, we note that income, education, and 
employment were uniquely associated with PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms as 
well as resilience after trauma exposure. Together, our findings suggest these factors do play 
a role in posttraumatic responses but do not account for racial/ethnic differences in the early 
aftermath of trauma.

Several limitations should be noted for the present study. Although our sample is among the 
largest of longitudinal studies assessing posttraumatic dysfunction immediately following 
trauma, we were limited in defining racial/ethnic classification to one of three groups. 
Racial/ethnic variation within the United States is considerably high, and each identity likely 
has its own stressors that may add nuance to the present results. Future work will be needed 
to provide more granularity to the present findings. In addition, due to modeling constraints, 
we only included individuals with complete data on all outcome psychometrics through 
3-months after trauma. It is possible that there may be attrition-related interactions with 
race/ethnicity that we are not able to disentangle here that are relevant for characterizing 
racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic outcomes. Another important note is that data were

only available for up to three months after the traumatic event. Although we did not observe 
any differences in changes over time, it is possible that some groups may show significant 
trajectory changes for periods beyond three months after the traumatic event. It will be 
necessary to investigate longitudinal changes, ideally leveraging large-scale databases such 
as the ever-growing AURORA study. However, other datasets from large-scale studies such 
as the All of Us Research Program (“The ‘All of Us’ Research Program,” 2019), Psychiatric 
Genomics Consortia (Cichon et al., 2009; Logue et al., 2015), and the Adolescent Brain and 
Cognitive Development study (Volkow et al., 2018), may also shine important light on the 
impact of racial/ethnic differences in chronic posttraumatic dysfunction and early childhood 
pretraumatic factors.

Further, we note that while our approach indexed prior trauma exposure, it is unclear if 
there were racial/ethnic differences in frequency of specific traumatic events. The LEC-5 
was not designed to assess frequency of specific events and although we included a second 
measure – the CTQ – to improve our index of prior trauma exposure additional research 
on potential differences in event frequency are needed. Further disentanglement of trauma 
frequency or proximity to trauma may improve efforts for clarifying individual vulnerability 
to posttraumatic dysfunction (Weis, Webb, Stevens, Larson, & deRoon-Cassini, 2021). A 
final limitation is that we did not consider other potentially protective factors in race-related 
differences of posttraumatic dysfunction. Prior work has highlighted that group differences 
in behaviors such as religious service attendance may partially explain lower reported 
mental illness prevalence in Black groups (Reese, Thorpe, Bell, Bowie, & La Veist, 2012). 
Future work may thus benefit from a consideration of potentially protective factors for 
race-related differences in posttraumatic dysfunction in the early aftermath of trauma.

In conclusion, the present study demonstrates race-related differences in posttraumatic 
depression and anxiety are partially driven by racial/ethnic differences in pretraumatic 
exposures to different life stressors. In particular, White participants’ greater exposure to 
traumatic events and childhood emotional neglect appeared to potentiate depression and 
anxiety symptoms after a recent trauma. These findings shed important light on pretraumatic 
risk factors for posttraumatic dysfunction and provide better understanding of race/ethnicity-
related differences in the early aftermath of trauma.
