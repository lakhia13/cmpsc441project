ABSTRACT

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a chronic course, contributing to 
significant socio-occupational dysfunction. Forty percent of patients remain treatment refractive despite mainstream 
treatment options such as serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavior therapy. Noninvasive brain stimulation 
approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have 
piqued interest as add-on treatment options in OCD. This review focuses on summarizing the TMS and tDCS studies 
in OCD with respect to their study design and stimulation parameters and key findings. We also briefly discuss the 
limitations and future directions noninvasive brain stimulation in OCD.

Key words: Neuromodulation, noninvasive brain stimulation, obsessive compulsive disorder, repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation

In this scenario, noninvasive brain stimulation approaches 
such  as  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS)  and 
transcranial electric current stimulation (tECS) hold promise 
in alleviating symptoms in OCD and other neuropsychiatric 
disorders.[3,4]  These  noninvasive 
involve 
application  of  either  magnetic  field  or  electric  current 
transcranially  over  the  scalp  to  modulate  specific  brain 
regions  to  alleviate  the  symptoms.  The  noninvasive 
neuromodulation in OCD focuses on specific brain regions 
considered to be functioning abnormally. The rationale for 
choosing the target region is based on their involvement in the 
neurobiological basis of OCD. Converging evidence indicates 
the  involvement  of  cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical  (CSTC) 
circuits  in  the  pathophysiology  of  OCD.[5]  Neuroimaging

studies  have  shown  the  involvement  of  prefrontal-cortical 
regions  in  the  neurobiological  basis  of  OCD.  Indeed, 
structural  and 
functional  changes  corresponding  to 
the  regions  subserving  the  CSTC  circuits  explain  the 
neurobiological  alterations  seen  in  OCD.[6]  In  this  review, 
we describe and discuss various studies that have examined 
the effects of repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
current  stimulation  (tDCS)  in  alleviating  the  symptoms  in 
OCD patients.

REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC 
STIMULATION IN OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE 
DISORDER

rTMS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique used in 
various neuropsychiatric conditions. rTMS uses low-intensity 
magnetic field to stimulate specific brain areas by inducing 
neurophysiologic  changes.  Low-frequency  stimulation, 
i.e.,  <5  Hz,  leads  to  decreased  neuronal  activity  while 
high-frequency stimulation, i.e., >10 Hz, increases neuronal 
activity.[7]  A  recent  modification  to  this  technique  in  the 
form of deep TMS seems to allow stimulation of deeper and 
larger brain structures as compared to conventional rTMS. 
In this section, we review the evidence of rTMS utilization 
in OCD around specific areas of stimulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA

There is evidence that suggests reduced cortico-subcortical 
inhibition  and  cortical  hyperexcitability  result  in  the 
repetitive  behavior  associated  with  OCD.[8]  An  open-label 
study  by  Mantovani  et  al.,  2006[9]  had  shown  initially 
that 
low-frequency  rTMS  over  supplementary  motor 
area  (SMA)  had  led  to  significant  improvement  of  OC 
in  10  patients  with  comorbid  Tourette 
symptoms 
syndrome.  This  improvement  in  clinical  symptoms  had 
correlated  with  improved  resting-state  cortical  motor 
threshold  and  also  sustained  up  to  3  months  follow-up. 
Later,  a  double-blind,  randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT) 
from  the  same  study  group  in  18  patients  with  resistant 
OCD  showed  greater  reduction  of  symptoms  in  active 
stimulation  compared  to  sham  stimulation.[10]  However, 
this was not statistically significant (P = 0.154). In another 
RCT  with  22  patients  with  resistant  OCD,  low-frequency 
active rTMS treatment significantly reduced the symptoms 
score  and  this  improvement  remained  stable  at  12  weeks 
of follow-up compared to sham rTMS.[11] However, an RCT 
from  France,  in  40  patients  with  resistant  OCD,  failed  to 
demonstrate  significant  difference  between  active  and 
sham  low-frequency  stimulation  of  SMA.[12]  An  open-label 
case  series  observation,  from  India,  in  17  patients  with 
resistant OCD, had shown that low-frequency rTMS is less 
likely  to  produce  improvement  in  severely  ill  patients.[13] 
Another open-label study from India had shown significant 
improvement in 12 patients with treatment-refractory OCD 
over  15  sessions  of  low-frequency  rTMS.[14]  However,  an 

RCT from our center involving 36 patients with refractory 
OCD  failed  to  demonstrate  any  significant  difference 
between active and sham low-frequency rTMS over bilateral 
pre-SMA.[15]

A pilot open-label trial had shown significant reduction of 
OCD in two-third of patients treated with rTMS for 3 weeks 
who  had  not  previously  responded  to  antidepressant 
trial.[16]  In  a  recent  open-label  study  from  Korea,  4  weeks 
of  low-frequency  TMS  over  SMA  did  not  produce  any 
significant change in OCD symptoms.[17] A 6-week, multisite 
RCT had shown clinically significant reduction in symptoms 
in patients with refractory OCD.[18] The symptom reduction 
achieved at the end of 6 weeks remained stable for further 
6 weeks. The studies conducted using rTMS over pre-SMA/
SMA is shown in Table 1.

DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX

Dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex  (DLPFC)  exerts  control  over 
multiple  subcortical  structures  that  are  clinically  relevant 
for  attention,  concentration,  and  executive  functions. 
Dysfunction  in  DLPFC  and  related  circuits  had  been 
implicated in various symptom dimensions of OCD.

Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
in 
High-frequency  20  Hz  single-session  stimulation 
12  patients,  with  each  patient  randomized  to  receive 
over  right/left  DLPFC  or  mid-occipital  regions,  had  shown 
that  only  after  right  DLPFC  stimulation,  compulsive  urges 
reduced significantly and the effect lasted about 8 h after 
stimulation.[19]  One  of  the  earliest  sham-controlled  RCT 
reported  that  low-frequency  1  Hz  stimulation  over  right 
DLPFC, three sessions per week for 6 weeks, was ineffective 
in producing any significant change in patients with OCD.[20] 
In an open-label study, adjunctive high-frequency rTMS to the 
right DLPFC did not show any significant change of obstetric 
cholestasis  (OC)  symptoms  in  42  patients.  However,  both 
depression  and  anxiety  scores  reduced  significantly.[21]  In 
30 treatment-resistant OCD patients, high-frequency 10 Hz 
stimulation over right DLPFC consisting of 30 sessions failed 
to show any significant difference between active and sham 
condition.[22] Forty-five patients randomized to three arms 
to receive low-frequency 1 Hz versus high-frequency 10 Hz 
versus  sham  stimulation  over  right  DLPFC  had  concluded 
that  only  1  Hz  stimulation  had  significantly  reduced 
symptoms.[23] A 3-week RCT, comparing active versus sham 
stimulations  of  low-frequency  1  Hz  stimulation  over  right 
DLPFC reported superiority of active simulation over sham 
in relieving OCD symptoms.[24]

Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
A sham-controlled double-blind study suggested that 2 weeks 
of high-frequency rTMS over left DLPFC was ineffective in 
bringing any change in Yale-Brown OC scale (YBOCS) scores. 
However,  when  extended  for  4  weeks,  active  stimulation

reduced OC symptoms significantly but not after controlling 
for change in depression scores.[25] A novel study from Egypt 
had  attempted  application  of  high-frequency  20  Hz  over 
left DLPFC with 15 sessions as monotherapy in 20 drug-free 
patients  with  OCD.  However,  there  was  no  significant 
change between active and sham stimulation. In the same 
study, when high-frequency stimulation was applied as an 
add-on to antidepressant medication over left DLPFC, it led 
to significant reduction in symptoms.[26] Low-frequency 1 Hz 
rTMS applied over left DLPFC as an add-on to medications 
in 30 patients did not show any significant change between 
active and sham stimulation.[27]

Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
Electroencephalography-guided, 
frequency-balanced, 
bilateral  DLPFC  stimulation  over  10  sessions  using  a 
sham-controlled  design  in  46  OCD  patients  had  shown 
significant  reduction  of  obsessions  and  anxiety  symptoms 
in  active  stimulation  compared  to  sham  stimulation.[28]  A 
single-blind  RCT  with  intra-individual  cross-over  design 
using  bilateral  high-frequency  20  Hz  DLPFC  stimulation 
reported  significant  reduction  of  symptoms  with  active 
stimulation. Both responders and partial responders were 
observed  only  in  true  condition  in  this  study.[29]  Another 

intra-individual  sham-controlled  study, 
involving  high 
frequency  over  bilateral  DLPFC  had  reported  significant 
reduction  in  symptoms  as  well  as  cognitive  performance 
after  true  stimulation  condition.[30]  This  same  study 
group  also  replicated  the  finding  on  efficacy  of  bilateral 
DLPFC  high-frequency  20  Hz  stimulation  in  improving 
symptoms but not cognitive function.[31] Further, sequential 
administration  of  low-frequency  1  Hz  stimulation  over 
DLPFC  and  SMA  did  not  produce  any  significant  change 
in  symptoms.[32]  The  key  rTMS  studies  with  DLPFC  as  the 
target region are summarized in Table 2.

A  retrospective  study  from  India  had  suggested  that 
there  is  a  role  of  applying  low-frequency  1  Hz  to  inhibit 
this  hyper-excitable  state  of  left  OFC  and  ameliorating 
symptoms.[33]  A  double-blind  RCT  study  that  involved 
the  administration  of  low-frequency  rTMS  over  right 
OFC  demonstrated  significant  reduction  of  symptoms  in 
addition  to  reduction  of  metabolism  in  bilateral  OFC  in

on  23  medication-resistant  OCD  patients  that  applied 
low-frequency  rTMS  over  left  OFC  for  15  days  reported 
significant  reduction  in  symptoms  in  true  condition  that 
lasted  till  10  weeks  but  not  12  weeks.[35]  The  key  rTMS 
studies  with  OFC  as  the  target  region  are  summarized  in 
Table 3.

Summary
Only  studies  that  administered  inhibitory  rTMS  over  OFC 
had  reported  consistently  positive  effects  on  symptom 
reduction. However, those studies are few in number and 
sample size, also proven negative when compared against 
other  areas  in  a  meta-analysis.[36]  Studies  involving  SMA 
and  DLPFC  areas  had  reported  mixed  results  and  all  the 
findings  from  those  studies  are  limited  by  small  sample

the above studies to overcome this limitation by conducting 
meta-analyses.  All  five  meta-analyses[36-40]  had  uniformly 
suggested that there is definite benefit of add-on true rTMS 
in  patients  with  resistant  OCD.  Zhou  et  al.,  2017[36]  had 
suggested  that  low-frequency/high-frequency  stimulation 
of  SMA  area  and  DLPFC  area  is  beneficial  with  overall 
largest effect size of g = 0.71 (SMA g = 0.56; left DLPFC 
g = 0.47; right DLPFC g = 0.93). Most of the studies had 
been conducted on resistant OCD patients and for a shorter 
duration  of  time  ranging  from  1  to  maximum  12  weeks. 
Large, multicenter trials in both resistant and nonresistant 
OCD  patients  are  the  need  of  the  hour.  Along  with 
application of electroencephalograph/perfusion imaging in 
guiding  specific  target  areas  and  stimulation  parameters 
might  advance  our  understanding  about  variations  in 
efficacy and eventually to overcome the limitations.

TRANSCRANIAL ELECTRIC CURRENT 
STIMULATION

tECS is a technique involving application of small-intensity 
electric current on the scalp using specialized devices. tECS 
is  mainly  of  two  types,  transcranial  alternating  current 
stimulation  (tACS)  and  tDCS.  tACS  involves  application  of 
alternating  current  at  various  frequencies,  whereas  tDCS 
involves application of direct current which is constant over 
time. tDCS has been widely studied and used more often in 
the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT 
STIMULATION IN OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE 
DISORDER

tDCS  is  a  re-emergent  noninvasive  brain  stimulation 
technique that has shown promise in alleviating symptoms 
in  various  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  Most  of  the 
studies  pertaining  to  application  of  tDCS  in  psychiatric 
disorders have been done in patients with depression and 
schizophrenia. Only a handful of studies have been done in 
OCD and related disorders. Volpato et al., 2013[41] probably 
described the first application of tDCS in an OCD patient. 
This  was  a  single  case  study  with  active  and  sham  tDCS 
cross-over.  The  stimulation  montage  involved  cathodal 
stimulation of left DLPFC, with a primary aim of comparing 
the effect of tDCS and rTMS on resting-state brain activity. 
The study reported no change observed in OC symptoms, 
whereas  improvement  in  depression  was  noted  after  true 
tDCS.  Following  this,  there  have  been  11  studies  that  are 
published looking at the beneficial effects of tDCS in OCD 
and one study employing tACS. The current review focuses 
on studies involving transcranial electric current stimulation 
in OCD with a detailed discussion on tDCS.

The  primary  focus  of  all  the  studies  has  been  symptom 
improvement  as  measured  by  changes  in  YBOCS  scores 

and  improvement  in  affective  symptoms  such  as  anxiety 
and  depression.  Only  one  study  has  looked  at  cognitive 
improvement following tDCS.[42] All the studies published so 
far have reported improvement in OC symptoms to a varying 
extent. However, all these studies are either single case study 
or  case  series  or  open-label  study  designs.  There  has  not 
been a single study employing randomized sham-controlled 
double-blind design. Only one study by D’Urso et al., 2016[42] 
employed  a  randomized,  controlled  double-blind  partial 
cross-over  design  but  without  a  sham  arm.  A  randomized

anodal tDCS to preSMA in OCD. Twenty five patients were 
randomly allocated into “verum” and “sham” arms and 2 mA 
of current was applied for 5 days (10 sessions). The response 
rate was significantly greater in the verum tDCS (4 out of 12) 
compared to sham tDCS. Given the limitations in the study 
design and sample size, these results are to be interpreted 
cautiously.  Moreover,  positive  reports  of  a  new  treatment 
approach  could  be  due  to  publication  bias.  The  details  of 
these studies are summarized in Table 4.

study 

Despite  the  limitations  of  these  studies,  there  are  certain 
factors  that  make  tDCS  treatment  unique  and  attractive. 
One  of  the  most  important  factors  among  them  is  the 
magnitude of response. Studies described in Table 4 report 
varying levels of improvement ranging from 15% reduction 
in  YBOCS  scores  to  as  high  as  80%.  The  magnitude  of 
response  is  important  here  mainly  because  most  of  the 
studies reported have applied tDCS in treatment-refractory 
patients.  Next  important  factor  is  the  persistence  of 
treatment  response  after  tDCS  treatment.  Longitudinal 
studies  report  a  minimum  of  1  month  to  a  maximum  of 
7 months sustenance of effects. One of the most interesting 
observations of tDCS treatment in OCD is the rapidity with 
which  tDCS  brings  about  changes  in  OCD.  All  the  studies 
reported  have  applied  tDCS  for  5  days  (10  sessions)  to  a 
maximum of few weeks with a good clinical improvement. 
In  addition,  tDCS  has  demonstrated  a  favorable  adverse 
effect profile and is one of the most common observations 
in  most  tDCS  studies,  irrespective  of  the  disorder.  The 
minimal side effects reported in any study are mild tingling 
and  burning  sensation  which  was  well  tolerated  by  all 
the  participants.  However,  long-term  safety  is  yet  to  be 
established.  Despite  all  the  unique  features  mentioned 
above,  one  has  to  remember  that  these  features  require 
systematic testing and reproducibility in larger samples.

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT 
STIMULATION PROTOCOLS IN OBSESSIVE–
COMPULSIVE DISORDER

Almost  all  the  studies  in  OCD  have  utilized  conventional 
tECS device which delivers current using a pair of conductive 
rubber  electrodes  wrapped  in  sponge  pouches  soaked  in 
saline. tECS involves the application of weak electric current

in the range of 1–2 mA over specified brain regions in an 
attempt  to  modulate  them.[54]  The  stimulus  is  delivered 
using  electrodes  of  various  sizes  placed  over  designated 
areas  of  interest  on  the  scalp,  which  is  one  of  the  crucial 
factors determining the outcomes of tDCS. Depending on 
the  polarity  of  the  stimulus,  the  brain  region  underneath 
the electrode gets stimulated or inhibited (anode stimulates 
and  cathode  inhibits  the  underlying  area).  However,  the 
stimulation/inhibition is not site limited. In addition to site 
of  stimulation,  the  other  important  parameters  that  can 
affect the outcome of tDCS are the current density, duration 
of  stimulation,  and  size  of  the  electrodes  the  details  of 
which are beyond the scope of this review.

Site  of  stimulation  can  be  considered  as  one  of  the  most 
crucial  parameters  determining  the  outcome  of  tDCS. 
This is entirely dependent on the target disorder or target 
symptom.  The  neural  substrates  of  psychiatric  disorders 
are still inconclusive. Various studies aiming at elucidating 
the  same  have  implicated  many  neural  systems  in  the 
pathophysiology of OCD. However, given the complexity of 
the disorder as well as the brain and its circuitry, there is no 
one single neural substrate that can act as a switch for OCD 
symptom  generation.  Several  multimodal  neuroimaging 
studies  have  demonstrated  aberrant  activities  (hypo-  or

including

studies  of  noninvasive  neuromodulation  involving  both 
tDCS  and  TMS  have  mainly  focused  on  modulating  the 
orbitofronto-striato-pallido-thalamic  network,  which  has 
been critically implicated in the neurobiology of OCD.[4]

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF TRANSCRANIAL 
DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION IN 
OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE DISORDER

Given  the  heterogeneity  associated  with  the  networks 
as  well  as  symptoms  in  OCD,  several  rTMS  studies  have 
targeted  mostly  SMA,  OFC,  or  medial  prefrontal  cortex 
for  ameliorating  OC  symptoms,  whereas  few  studies  have 
targeted  DLPFC  with  the  hope  of  alleviating  comorbid 
affective symptoms in OCD.[4] Taking cues from these rTMS 
studies  and  the  evidence  from  the  circuit  dysfunction 
theories  in  OCD,  tDCS  studies  have  mainly  focused  on 

OFC and SMA/pre-SMA and two studies focusing on DLPFC 
modulation [Table 4]. We discuss the mechanism of action 
of tDCS along the lines of site of stimulation.

DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX

Three  studies  in  OCD  have  targeted  DLPFC  with  varying 
electrode  montages.  In  the  first  study  by  Volpato  et  al., 
2013,[41]  the  cathode  was  placed  on  the  left  DLPFC  and 
anode  was  placed  extracephalically  at  the  posterior  part 
of  the  neck  using  35  cm2  sponge  electrodes.  This  study 
reported  no  change  in  OC  symptoms,  while  there  was 
a  significant  decrease  in  anxiety  and  depression  scores 
following  tDCS.  This  was  based  on  the  earlier  evidence 
of  decreased  functional  connectivity  in  the  default-mode 
network,  anterior  cingulate  gyrus  (ACC),  middle  frontal 
gyrus,  and  putamen  in  OCD  patients.[57]  The  authors 
concluded that the cathodal stimulation probably increased 
the  functional  activity  in  the  rostral  part  of  ACC  and  the 
midline OFC with simultaneous reduction in the asymmetry 
of  activation  between  right  and  left  DLPFC.  Palm  et  al., 
2017[51]  targeted  bilateral  DLPFC  with  anode  over  the  left 
DLPFC  and  cathode  over  the  right  DLPFC  using  35  cm2 
sponge electrodes. The authors based their strategy on the 
evidence from studies on the effect of tDCS on cognition in 
healthy controls and patients with depression. DLPFC being 
the major hub of cognitive, behavioral, control might also 
have a significant influence on other connected networks. 
The authors hypothesized that the DLPFC stimulation using 
tDCS might modulate the cognitive control over obsessions 
and  compulsions,  simultaneously  targeting  the  comorbid 
affective  symptoms.  Yet,  another  study  by  Dinn  et  al., 
2016[50]  also  placed  anode  over  left  DLPFC,  while  placing 
cathode  over  right  OFC.  However,  cathodal  OFC  was  the 
active  electrode  and  left  DLPFC  anodal  stimulation  in  this 
study  was  mainly  targeting  the  executive  dysfunction  and 
affective symptoms than the OC symptoms.

ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX

Functional  neuroanatomical  studies  have  assigned  a 
critical role to the OFC in manifestation of OC symptoms. 
Studies have also proposed that specific areas of the OFC 
contribute to reward-guided learning and decision-making. 
Hyperactivity  of  these  areas  within  the  OFC  has  been 
proposed to attribute anticipatory affective value to future 

S72

Shivakumar, et al.: Neuromodulation in OCDevents,  resulting  in  rumination  about  future  aversive 
events.[58,59]  Several  neuroimaging  studies  have  reported 
hyperactivity in OFC during symptom provocation tasks and 
also during resting state.[60,61] In fact, the hyperactivity was 
one of the predictors of treatment response since it showed 
a direct correlation with symptom severity.[62]

Overall  five  studies  have  used  OFC  as  the  target  site  of 
stimulation  in  tDCS  for  OCD.  The  first  study  using  this 
montage was by Mondino et al., 2015,[43] wherein cathodal 
stimulation  of  left  OFC  was  done  using  35  cm2  sponge 
electrode and anodal electrode of 100 cm2 was placed over 
the occipital cortex. This was based on the earlier reports 
of improvement in OC symptoms following low-frequency 
rTMS  applied  over  OFC  with  a  subsequent  observation  of 
decrease in OFC activity.[34,35] In their study, Mondino et al., 
2015 found a 26% reduction in OC symptoms after 1 month 
of tDCS, attributing the effects to decrease in OFC activity 
following  cathodal  stimulation.  Along  the  same  lines, 
Alizadeh  Goradel  et  al.,  2016[48]  in  their  single  case  study 
reported 64% improvement in OC symptoms and near-total 
improvement in anxiety and depression following cathodal 
stimulation of OFC.

Bation  et  al.,  2016[45]  in  an  open-label  pilot  study  design 
of eight patients placed cathode over left OFC and anode 
over  right  cerebellum.  This  was  based  on  the  evidence  of 
hypoactivity of cerebellum and its role in OCD as reported 
by  meta-analysis  of  several  functional  and  structural 
neuroimaging  studies.[63,64]  Further,  neuroimaging  studies 
have also demonstrated aberrant interconnections between 
orbitofronto-striato-pallido-thalamic loop and cerebellum in 
OCD patients, which could be critical in the generation of OC 
symptoms or the cognitive correlates of OCD.[6,65,66] Bation 
et al., 2016 reported a 26% reduction in OC symptoms which 
persisted for nearly 3 months, attributing the improvement 
to  tDCS-induced  modulation  of  a  large  interconnected 
corticosubcortical network involved in the pathophysiology 
of OCD.

Dinn  et  al.,  2016[50]  in  their  study  aimed  at  simultaneous 
modulation  of  OFC  and  DLPFC,  targeting  OC  symptoms 
and  neurocognitive  functions,  such  as  executive  function 
and  working  memory  in  OCD,  respectively.  In  this  study, 
the  cathode  was  placed  on  right  OFC  and  anode  was 
placed on left DLPFC. This 3-week open-label tDCS on five 
patients  reported  a  significant  reduction  in  OC  symptoms 
and affective symptoms, with a considerable improvement 
in executive function. In addition, there was a correlation 
between improvement in OC symptoms and improvement 
in executive function, suggesting a critical role of DLPFC in 
alleviation of OC symptoms.

The  largest  open-label  study  of  tDCS  in  OCD  comprising 
42  patients  by  Najafi  et  al.,  2017[52]  also  used  cathodal 
stimulation of OFC (right) with anode placed over the area 

covering left pareito-temporo-occipital regions. This study 
reported nearly 63% improvement in OC symptoms following 
3 weeks of tDCS treatment, along with the persistence of 
improvement for 3 months.

PRE-SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA/
SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA

Pre-SMA/SMA has been implicated in OCD pathogenesis as 
much as the OFC. As discussed earlier in the TMS section, 
there is evidence that suggests reduced cortico-subcortical 
inhibition  and  cortical  hyperexcitability  resulting  in  the 
repetitive  behavior  associated  with  OCD.  However,  there 
is  contradicting  evidence  of  hypoactivity  at  pre-SMA, 
contributing to lack of inhibition of striatal function resulting 
in hyperactivity of striatum, giving rise to OC symptoms.[67] 
Based  on  this  evidence,  one  of  the  first  studies  to  target 
pre-SMA/SMA was a case report by[44] The authors based their 
hypothesis on the theory of deficient response inhibition in 
OCD, the function attributed to pre-SMA/SMA.[68,69] In view of 
this theory, the authors placed anode over left pre-SMA/SMA 
and  cathode  over  the  right  supraorbital  area.  The  study 
results reported >40% reduction in YBOCS score along with 
improvement  in  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms.  The 
authors hypothesized that the clinical improvement could 
be  due  to  increase  in  the  left  SMA  activity  after  anodal 
tDCS  improving  the  response  inhibition.  Subsequently, 
the  same  group  reported  a  significant  improvement  (80%) 
in  episodic  OCD  following  anodal  tDCS  to  pre-SMA.  This 
study also reported long-term sustenance of improvement 
and significant benefits following booster tDCS, 7 months 
after relapse.[46]

Subsequent  to  these,  there  were  two  studies  targeting 
pre-SMA/SMA  in  OCD.  Both  studies  from  the  same  group 
applied  cathodal  tDCS  to  pre-SMA/SMA  in  a  single  case 
report  study  with  a  significant  improvement  following 
tDCS.[47]  The  second  study  involved  placing  either  the 
anode/cathode  electrode  on  bilateral  pre-SMA  depending 
on the cross-over design in 12 patients. The results of this 
study demonstrated superiority of cathodal stimulation of 
pre-SMA over anode. Another study by Silva et al.[49] followed 
the  same  montage  of  cathodal  stimulation  of  bilateral 
pre-SMA with good improvement in clinical symptoms.

Summary
TMS  studies  that  administered  inhibitory  rTMS  over  OFC 
had  reported  consistently  positive  effects  on  symptom 
reduction. However, those studies are few in number and 
sample  size  was  less  when  compared  against  other  areas 
in  a  meta-analysis.[36]  Studies  involving  SMA  and  DLPFC 
areas  had  reported  mixed  results,  and  all  the  findings 
from  those  studies  are  limited  by  small  sample  sizes. 
Various  researchers  had  attempted  pooling  data  from  the 
above  studies  to  overcome  this  limitation  by  conducting 
meta-analyses.  All  five  meta-analyses[36-40]  had  uniformly

in  patients  with  resistant  OCD.  Recent  studies[36,39]  had 
suggested  that  low-frequency/high-frequency  stimulation 
of  SMA  area  and  DLPFC  area  are  beneficial.  Most  of  the 
studies had been conducted on resistant OCD patients and 
for a shorter duration of time ranging from 1 to maximum 
12 weeks.

In case of tDCS, the studies are very few when compared to 
TMS and the studies published so far are very preliminary. 
Most  of  these  studies  are  case  reports/case  series  and 
open-label  study  designs  with  lesser  evidential  value 
compared to RCTs. In addition, similar to TMS, tDCS studies 
have  also  tried  to  explore  their  way  into  modulating  the 
best neural correlates of OC symptoms. As a result, studies 
have mainly explored the beneficial effects of tDCS-induced 
modulation  of  either  OFC  or  pre-SMA/SMA.  All  these 
studies  have  reported  significant  benefit  suggesting  OFC 
and pre-SMA/SMA as the ideal targets. DLPFC stimulation as 
explored by two studies mainly contributes to improvement 
in comorbid affective symptoms rather than OC symptoms. 
In addition to lack of systematic study design, these studies 
have  employed  varying  stimulation  parameters  such  as 
duration of stimulation, intensity of current, inter-stimulus 
interval,  and  electrode  sizes,  suggesting  prematurity  of 
these findings.

CONCLUSIONS

Pressing need of the hour is to establish further support with 
large trials in both resistant and nonresistant OCD patients, 
more  so  in  case  of  tDCS  where  there  is  a  serious  lack  of 
systematic studies. In addition to evaluating the persistence 
of improvement induced by both rTMS and tDCS, longitudinal 
studies  are  essential  to  establish  long  term  safety  of 
these  techniques.  In  addition,  systematic  study  designs 
coupled with multimodal investigative tools exploring the 
neuroimaging measures and electrophysiological measures 
might  advance  our  understanding  about  variations  in 
treatment response and mechanism of action of noninvasive 
brain stimulation techniques.
