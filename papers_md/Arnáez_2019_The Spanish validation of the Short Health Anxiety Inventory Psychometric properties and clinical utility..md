Abstract
Background/Objective:   The   Short   Health   Anxiety   Inventory   (SHAI)   is   a   widely   used   self-report
instrument   to   evaluate   health   anxiety.   To   assess   the   SHAI’s   factor   structure,   psychometric   prop-
erties,  and   accuracy   in   differentiating   Spanish   non-clinical   individuals   from   patients   with   severe
health  anxiety   or   hypochondriasis.
Method:   A   total   of   342   community   participants   (61.6%   women;   Mage =   34.60,   SD   =   14.91)   and   31
hypochondriacal   patients   (51.6%   women;   Mage =   32.74,   SD   =   9.69)   completed   the   SHAI   and   other
self-reports   assessing   symptoms   of   hypochondriasis,   depression,   anxiety   sensitivity,   worry,   and
obsessive-compulsive.
Results:  The   original   two-factor   structure   was   selected   as   the   best   structure,   based   on   its   par-
simony  and   empirical   support   (Factor   1:   Illness   likelihood;   Factor   2:   Negative   consequences   of
illness).  Moreover,   the   Spanish   version   of   the   SHAI   demonstrated   good   construct   and   concurrent
and  discriminant   validity,   and   internal   consistency.   A   cutoff   of   40.5   (total   score)   accurately   dis-
tinguished  non-clinical   individuals   from   patients   with   severe   health   anxiety   or   hypochondriasis.
Conclusions:   The   SHAI   is   an   adequate   screening   instrument   to   measure   health   anxiety   in
Spanish-speaking   community   adults.

Validación   espa˜nola   del   Inventario   Breve   de   Ansiedad   por   la   Salud:   propiedades
psicométricas   y   utilidad   clínica

Resumen
Introducción/Objetivo:   El   Inventario   Breve   de   Ansiedad   por   la   Salud   (SHAI,   por   sus   iniciales
en  inglés)   es   un   autoinforme   ampliamente   empleado   para   evaluar   ansiedad   por   la   salud.   El
objetivo   es   evaluar   la   estructura   factorial   del   SHAI,   sus   propiedades   psicométricas,   y   exactitud
diferenciando   entre   población   espa˜nola   no   clínica   y   pacientes   con   hipocondría.
Método:   Un   total   de   342   participantes   extraídos   de  
la   población   general   (66%   mujeres,
Medad =   35,   DT   =   14,91)   y   31   pacientes   con   hipocondría   (51,6%   mujeres;   Medad =   32,74,   DT   =   9,69
completaron   el   SHAI   y   otros   autoinformes   de   síntomas   hipocondriacos,   depresión,   sensibilidad
a  la   ansiedad,   preocupaciones   y   obsesivo-compulsivos.
Resultados:   La   estructura   de   dos   factores   propuesta   originalmente   fue   seleccionada   como   la
mejor  estructura   debido   a   su   parsimonia   y   soporte   empírico   (Factor   1:   Probabilidad   de   enfermar;
Factor  2:   Consecuencias   negativas   enfermedad).   La   versión   espa˜nola   del   SHAI   muestra   una
buena  consistencia   interna,   y   validez   de   constructo,   concurrente   y   discriminante.   El   punto   de
corte  de   40,5   (puntuación   total)   permite   distinguir   entre   los   individuos   no   clínicos   y   los   pacientes
con  elevada   ansiedad   por   la   salud   o   hipocondría.
Conclusiones:   El   SHAI   es   un   instrumento   adecuado   para   la   detección   de   ansiedad   por   la   salud
en  población   adulta   hispano   hablante.

Health   anxiety   is   conceptualized   as   a   continuum   that
ranges   from   mild   non-   clinical   health   concerns   to   severe
or   hypochondriacal   concerns   (Bailer   et   al.,   2016;   Bobevski,
Clarke,   &   Meadows,   2016;   Warwick   &   Salkovskis,   1990).   Indi-
viduals   with   health   anxiety   will   vary   in   their   resistance   to
medical   reassurance,   and   in   their   distress   level,   functional
impairment,   and   use   of   health   care   services.   In   addition,
these   individuals   can   experience   intrusive   thoughts   related
to   illness   contents   (Arnáez,   García-Soriano,   &   Belloch,   2017;
Pascual-Vera   &   Belloch,   2018).   The   cognitive-behavioral
approach   proposes   that   individuals   with   health   anxiety   tend
to   catastrophically   misinterpret   ambiguous   illness-related
information,   medical   information,   and   bodily   signs   or   symp-
toms.   Moreover,   this   misinterpretation   could   lead   individuals
with   severe   health   anxiety   to   believe   that   they   are   suf-
fering   from   a   serious   illness   (Warwick   &   Salkovskis,   1990).
In   order   to   measure   the   aforementioned   continuum   from
non-clinical   to   clinical   health   anxiety,   Salkovskis,   Rimes,
Warwick,   and   Clark   (2002)   developed   a   self-rated   question-
naire,   the   Health   Anxiety   Inventory   (HAI),   containing   64
items.   Each   item   consists   of   a   group   of   four   statements,   and
respondents   are   asked   to   indicate   the   single   statement   in
each   group   that   best   applies   to   them   (e.g.,   from   ‘I   do   not
worry   about   my   health’   to   ‘I   spend   most   of   my   time   wor-
rying   about   my   health’).   The   HAI   demonstrated   excellent
internal   consistency   and   satisfactory   test-retest   reliabil-
ity,   was   sensitive   to   treatment   effects,   and   differentiated
between   patients   with   hypochondriasis,   patients   with   anxi-
ety   disorders,   and   community   participants   (Salkovskis   et   al.,
2002).   The   authors   also   developed   a   shortened   version   with
18   items,   the   Short   Health   Anxiety   Inventory   (SHAI),   as   a
screening   instrument   to   assess   health   anxiety   independently
of   the   person’s   physical   health   status,   thus   providing   a   brief

and   quick   instrument   to   differentiate   between   disabling   and
normal   health   anxiety   in   both   medical   and   non-medical   sam-
ples.   The   18   items   were   distributed   in   two   factors:   the   ﬁrst
included   14   items   and   assessed   the   likelihood   of   becoming
ill,   whereas   the   second   factor   (4   items)   evaluated   the   nega-
tive   consequences   or   ‘awfulness’   of   illness   (Salkovskis   et   al.,
2002).

Since   its   development   and   publication,   the   SHAI   has   been
widely   used   to   assess   health   anxiety,   and   several   studies   in
different   countries   have   supported   its   reliability   and   valid-
ity   in   both   clinical   and   non-clinical   samples   (see   Alberts,
Hadjistavropoulos,   Jones,   &   Sharpe,   2013   for   a   review).
For   example,   the   SHAI   internal   consistency   ranged   from
˛=.82   (Morales,   Reis,   Espada,   &   Orgilés,   2016)   to  
˛=.96
(Abramowitz,   Olatunji,   &   Deacon,   2007),   and   test-retest
reliability   ranged   from   r   =   .56   (Zhang,   Liu,   Li,   Mao,   &   Yuan,
2015)   to   r   =   .90   (Salkovskis   et   al.,   2002).   Moreover,   the
questionnaire   showed   high   associations   with   hypochondri-
acal   symptoms,   but   the   associations   were   only   moderate
with   worry,   anxiety   sensitivity,   obsessive-compulsive,   or
depressive   symptoms   (Abramowitz,   Deacon,   &   Valentiner,
2007;   Abramowitz,   Olatunji,   &   Deacon,   2007;   Wheaton,
Berman,   Flanking,   &   Abramowitz,   2010).   However,   the   orig-
inal   two-factor   structure   (Salkovskis   et   al.,   2002)   has   been
questioned.   Abramowitz,   Deacon,   and   Valentiner   (2007)
obtained   a   three-factor   structure   -Illness   likelihood,  
Ill-
ness   severity,   and   Body   vigilance-   in   a   sample   of   medically
healthy   university   students.   The   ﬁrst   and   third   factors
or   subscales   differed   from   those   proposed   by   Salkovskis
et   al.   (2002),   whereas   the   Illness   severity   subscale   over-
lapped   with   the   Negative   consequences   of   illness   subscale
originally   described   by   Salkovskis   et   al.   (2002).   In   addi-
tion,   Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et   al.   (2007)   compared   the

original   two-factor   structure   to   the   three-factor   structure
(Abramowitz,   Deacon   et   al.,   2007)   in   two   clinical   samples
of   patients   with   hypochondriasis   and   patients   with   anxiety
disorders.   The   results   showed   a   similar   ﬁt   for   both   models.
Thus,   following   the   parsimony   principle,   they   selected   the
original   two-factor   model.   Later,   Wheaton   et   al.   (2010)
proposed   a   two-factor   model   similar   to   Salkovskis   et   al.
(2002),   but   removing   item   13   because   it   loaded   in   both
factors.   The   subscales   were   labelled   Illness   likelihood   and
Illness   severity.   Finally,   Alberts,   Sharpe,   Kehler,   and   Had-
jistavropoulos   (2011)   analyzed   the   factor   structure   of   the
original   scale   of   Likelihood   of   becoming   ill   (comprising   items
1   to   14)   in   two   different   samples:   a   not   seriously   ill   sam-
ple   and   a   sample   with   multiple   sclerosis.   They   derived   a
model   with   two   factors   labelled   Thought   intrusion   and   Fear
of   illness.   Item   14   was   not   included   because   it   did   not
load   in   any   factor.   The   authors   did   not   include   the   Nega-
tive   consequences   of   illness   factor   proposed   by   Salkovskis
et   al.   (2002)  
it
did   not   directly   assess   health   anxiety   and   was   not   suit-
able   for   medical   samples   with   a   diagnosed   illness.   Although
the   discrepancies   about   the   SHAI’s   structure   are   evident,
the   original   two-factor   model   has   received   further   support
from   research   (i.e.,   Morales,   Espada,   Carballo,   Piqueras,
&   Órgiles,   2015;   te   Poel,   Hartmann,   Baumgartner,   &   Tanis,
(2017).   The   SHAI   has   been   translated   and   validated   in   a   wide
range   of   countries   and   languages,   such   as   Chinese   (Zhang
et   al.,   2015),   Dutch   (te   Poel   et   al.,   2017),   Polish   (Kocjan,
2016),   Portuguese   (Morales   et   al.,   2016),   or   Spanish   (Morales
et   al.,   2015).   This   latter   study   used   a   sample   of   adoles-
cents   (Mage =   15.72   years,   SD   =   0.72).   Nonetheless,   no   studies
have   analyzed   the   psychometric   properties   and   structure
of   the   SHAI   in   Spanish   non-clinical   adults   (>18   years)   and
compared   their   scores   to   those   of   patients   with   a   clinical
diagnosis   of   hypochondriasis   in   order   to   establish   a   cutoff
score.

in   their   analyses   because   they   thought  

With   all   this   in   mind,   the   current   study   has   three   objec-
tives.   The   ﬁrst   objective   is   to   examine   the   factor   structure
(factor   validity)   that   best   ﬁts   the   SHAI   Spanish   version   in
an   adult   community   sample,   compared   to   the   different   pro-
posals   reported   in   the   literature.   The   second   objective   is
to   investigate   the   psychometric   properties   (internal   consis-
tency   and   associations   among   the   subscales)   and   convergent
and   divergent   validity   of   the   SHAI   Spanish   version   and   its
subscales.   The   third   objective   is   to   compare   the   scores   of
non-clinical   participants   and   patients   with   hypochondriasis
on   the   SHAI   and   determine   its   diagnostic   utility   by   examin-
ing   the   accuracy   of   different   cutoff   scores   in   differentiating
patients   with   a   primary   diagnosis   of   hypochondriasis   from
non-clinical   individuals.

Method

Participants

Two   groups   of   Spanish   participants   were   included   in   the
study.   The   ﬁrst   group   consisted   of   342   community   parti-
cipants,   and   the   second   group   consisted   of   31   individuals
who   met   the   diagnostic   criteria   for   hypochondriasis   accord-
ing   to   the   Diagnostic   Statistical   Manual   of   Mental   Disorders
Fourth   Edition   (DSM-IV)   text   revision   and   the   International

Classiﬁcation   of   Diseases,   11th   (World   Health   Organization
WHO,   2018).   Descriptive   data   for   both   groups   are   included
in   Table   1.

Patients   were   diagnosed   by   experienced   clinicians   using
the   Structured   Diagnostic  
Interview   for   Hypochondriasis
(SDIH)   and   comorbidity   was   assessed   using   the   International
Neuropsychiatric   Interview   (MINI).   At   the   time   of   the   study,
none   of   the   patients   met   the   criteria   for   a   mental   disor-
der   other   than   hypochondriasis,   and   one   of   them   had   a
lifetime   history   of   Generalized   Anxiety   Disorder.   Disorder
severity   was   assessed   with   the   Hypochondriasis-YBOCS-M,
with   scores   ranging   from   15   to   58   (M   =   46.12,   SD   =  9.41).   The
inclusion   criteria   were   as   follows:   a   primary   diagnosis   of
hypochondriasis   (DSM-IV-TR   criteria),   age   range   between   18
and   65   years,   a   duration   of   hypochondriasis   of   at   least   one
year,   absence   of   any   organic   mental   disorder,   mental   retar-
dation,   psychotic   disorder,   Cluster   A   personality   disorder,   or
current   history   of   substance   abuse   disorders,   and   having   an
adequate   level   of   reading   ability.

item   consists   of   a   group   of   four   statements   that   are   scored
from   1   to   4.   Because   this   is   the   target   measure   in   the   cur-
rent   study,   its   psychometric   properties   in   the   two   samples
will   be   described   in   the   results   section.

Whiteley  

Index   (WI;   Pilowsky,   1967.   Spanish   version:
Avia,   2017).   A   14-item   self-report   questionnaire   measures
hypochondriasis   using   a   dichotomous   yes/no   format.   It   has
demonstrated   good   validity   and   reliability.   The   internal   con-
sistency   in   the   non-clinical   sample   of   the   current   study   was
(cid:2)

  =   .70.

Beck   Depression   Inventory   (BDI-II;   Beck,   Steer,   &   Brown,
1996.   Spanish   version:   Sanz,   Perdigón,   &   Vázquez,   2003).
It   is   a   21-item   self-report   measure   of   depressive   symptoms
ranging   from   0   (symptom   not   present)   to   3   (symptom   very
intense).   It   has   demonstrated   stability   over   time   and   across
countries   (Schürmann   &   Margraf,   2018).   The   BDI-II   showed
adequate   internal   consistency   in   this   study   ((cid:2)

  =   .89).

Anxiety   Sensitivity   Index-3   (ASI-3;   Taylor   et   al.,   2007.
Spanish   version:   Sandín,   Valiente,   Chorot,   &   Santed,   2007).
It   is   an   18-item   measure   that   assesses   the   tendency   to   fear
anxiety   symptoms   based   on   the   belief   that   they   could   have
harmful   consequences.   Items   are   rated   from   0   =   very   little
to   4   =   very   much.  The   ASI-3   has   three   subscales   related   to
fears   of   social   concerns,   fears   of   physical   symptoms,   and
fears   of   cognitive   decontrol.   In   the   current   study,   internal
consistency   for   the   total   score   in   the   non-clinical   sample   was
good   ((cid:2)

  =   .80).

18-item   self-report   instrument   to   measure   OCD   symptoms.
Respondents   rate   the   distress   caused   by   OCD   symptoms   in
the   past   month   from   0   (not   at   all)   to   4   (extremely).   The
OCI-R   consists   of   six   subscales,   and   its   total   score,   used   in
the   current   study,   provides   a   general   index   of   OCD   severity.
In   the   current   study,   an

Procedure

Community   participants   were   recruited   by   undergraduate
psychology   students,   under   the   supervision   of   three   of   the
authors.   In   order   to   ensure   the   quality   of   the   data,   students
were   chosen   due   to   their   interest   in   research.   Prior   to   their
participation   in   the   research,   all   the   students   voluntarily
attended   a   seminar   where   the   aim   of   the   study   and   the
administration   of   the   questionnaires   to   future   participants
were   explained,   emphasizing   aspects   such   as   the   relevance
of   privacy,   sincerity   of   participants’   responses,   etc.   Students
received   academic   credits   for   their   collaboration.   Each   stu-
dent   administered   the   questionnaires   individually   to   at   least
three   friends   or   relatives.   Inclusion   criteria   were   age   rang-
ing   from   18   to   65   years,   good   reading   level,   and   not   having
a   recent   history   of   mental   disorders   or   disabling   medical
disease   in   the   preceding   year.   All   the   participants   were

previously   informed   of   the   purpose   of   the   study,   and   they
gave   their   formal   written   consent   to   participate.   Then,
they   were   given   a   booklet   containing   the   questionnaires
described   above,   which   were   presented   in   a   randomized
order   to   avoid   response   biases.

Clinical   participants   were   recruited   from   outpatient
mental   health   clinics   pertaining   to   the   University   and   to   the
Spanish   National   Health   System.   All   potential   participants
were   individually   screened   with   a   full   history   and   exam-
ination   by   one   of   the   authors.   As   mentioned   above,   the
intake   assessment   included   the   SDIH   and   the   MINI   diagnostic
interviews,   a   full   history,   and   the   Hypochondriasis-YBOCS-M.
Then,   patients   were   informed   about   the   purpose   and   assess-
ment   procedure   of   the   study   and   asked   for   their   explicit
consent   to   participate.   After   the   patient   had   given   his   or   her
explicit   consent,   individualized,   face-to-face   administration
of   the   SHAI   was   carried   out.   The   study   was   approved   by
the   ethics   committees   of   the   University   and   the   outpatient
mental   health   clinic.

Data   analyses

This   study   was   carried   out   using   an   instrumental,   transver-
sal   design   (Montero   &   León,   2007).   To   examine   the   factorial
structure   of   the   SHAI   we   conducted   an   exploratory   fac-
tor   analysis   (EFA)   and   a   conﬁrmatory   factor   analyses   (CFA)
using   the   SPSS   statistical   package   (version   22.0)   and   the   EQS
6.1,   respectively.   First,   we   explored   the   factorial   structure
of   the   SHAI   using   EFA   in   community   participants   (n   =   219),
and   second,   through   CFA,   we   studied   whether   the   factorial
structure   obtained   (including   a   single-factor   model)   and   the
structures   proposed   in   the   literature   ﬁt   our   data.   Speciﬁ-
cally,   the   following   six   CFA   models   were   examined:   Model
1   was   a   single-factor   model   representing   the   possibility   of
including   all   the   health   concern   contents   in   a   single   homoge-
nous   dimension   of   health   anxiety.   This   model   is   used   as   a
baseline   (or   default)   model   for   the   data.   Model   2   tested   the
factorial   structured   obtained   in   the   EFA.   Model   3   included
the   original   two-factor   solution   proposed   by   Salkovskis   et   al.
(2002),   that   is,   the   likelihood   of   becoming   ill   (items   1   to
14)   and   negative   consequences   of   illness   (items   15   to   18).
Model   4   tested   the   almost   identical   two-factor   solution   pro-
posed   by   Wheaton   et   al.   (2010)   (subscale   1:   Illness   likelihood
including   items   1   to   12   and   14   [item   13   was   removed],   and
subscale   2:   Illness   severity,   items   15   to   18).   Model   5   con-
sisted   of   the   three-factor   model   proposed   by   Abramowitz,
Deacon   et   al.   (2007):   Illness   likelihood   (items   1,   4-9,   11,
12,   and   14),   Illness   severity   (items   15   to   18),   and   Body   vig-
ilance   (items   2,   3,   and   10).   Finally,   Model   6   included   the
two-factor   solution   proposed   by   Alberts,   Sharpe,   Kehler,   &
Hadjistavropoulos   (2011):   Thought   intrusion   (items   1-4,   6-
7,   10,   and   13)   and   Fear   of   illness   (items   5,   8,   9,   11,   and
12).   To   avoid   distribution   problems   in   the   data   set,   the   Max-
imum   Likelihood   (ML)   method   with   robust   correction   was
applied.   To   assess   the   ﬁt   of   the   factor   structure,   we   used   the
chi-square   ((cid:3)2),   Akaike’s   information   criterion   (AIC),   as   well
as   the   Comparative   Fit   Index   (CFI),   Goodness   of   Fit   Index
(GFI),   Root   Mean   Square   Error   of   Approximation   (RMSEA),
with   a   90%   conﬁdence   interval.   The   following   criteria   indi-

Pearson’s   correlation   coefﬁcients   were   used   to   examine
the   relationships   between   the   SHAI   and   other   measures.
Differences   between   groups   (clinical   vs.   non-clinical)   were
examined   by   using   t   tests.   Cohen   d   values   were   calculated   to
estimate   the   effect   size   of   comparisons.   Receiver   operating
characteristic   (ROC)   analysis   was   conducted   to   examine   the
accuracy   of   the   SHAI-total   score   in   differentiating   patients
with   hypochondriasis   from   non-patients.   The   ROC   analy-
sis   uses   the   association   between   sensitivity   and   speciﬁcity
to   estimate   the   area   under   the   curve   (AUC),   with   a   95%
CI,   in   order   to   indicate   how   well   a   measure   distinguishes
between   positive   (i.e.,   a   diagnosis   of   hypochondriasis)
and   negative   (i.e.,   absence   of   psychopathology)   cases.   To
determine   the   appropriate   cutoff-point   for   severe   health
anxiety,   the   Youden   index   (sensitivity   +   speciﬁcity−
  1)   was
calculated,   and   the   corresponding   cutoff   value   for   the   high-
est   Youden  
index   was   considered   as   the   optimal   cutoff
value.

Factor   structure   of   the   SHAI:   Exploratory   factor
analysis

First,   the   suitability   of   the   data   for   the   factor   analysis
was   tested.   The   Kaiser---Meyer---Olkin   measure   of   sampling
adequacy   was   .89,   above   the   recommended   cut-off   point
of   .60,   and   Bartlett’s   Test   of   Sphericity   was   signiﬁcant
(X2 [153]   =   1673.35,   p   <   .001),   indicating   that   factor   analy-
sis   was   appropriate.   Factor   analysis   was   carried   out   using

principal   axis   factoring   with   promax   (oblique)   rotation
because   it   was   anticipated   that   the   factors   would   be   cor-
related.   The   eigenvalues   greater   than   one   suggested   three
factors   that   explained   36.75%   of   the   variance   after   rotation.
The   ﬁrst   factor   accounted   for   27.58%   of   the   total   variance,
the   second   accounted   for   5.76%,   and   the   third   accounted
for   3.41%.   Signiﬁcant   loadings   were   set   at   .40   or   higher.
Table   2   shows   the   factor   loadings   and   communalities   for   the
three-factor   solution.

Factor   structure   of   the   SHAI:   Conﬁrmatory   factor
analyses

Following   our   previous   exploratory   analysis   of   the   ques-
tionnaire,   as   well   as   the   ﬁndings   reported   in   the   existing
literature,   we   tested   six   CFA   at   the   item   level,   using   the
data   obtained   from   the   community   participants.   Table   3
shows   the   ﬁt   indexes   for   the   six   tested   models.   Following   Hu
and   Bentler’s   (1999)   criteria,   the   models   that   most   closely
matched   the   criteria   were   models   3   (Salkovskis   et   al.,   2002),
4   (Wheaton   et   al.,   2010),   and   5   (Abramowitz,   Deacon   et   al.,
2007)   because   the   index   rates   of   these   models   were   slightly
≥.90   and
closer   to   the   established   criteria,   CFI   and   GFI  
≤06,   and   the   chi-square   and   AIC   values   were   smaller.
RMSEA  
Moreover,   as   proposed   by   Marsh   et   al.   (2004),   GFI   values
were   acceptable,   and   RMSEA   values   were   optimal.   The   ﬁt
indexes   of   the   three   models   were   fairly   equivalent,   but
slightly   higher   for   Model   4.   However,   because   Model   3   and
4   are   fairly   similar   (with   model   4   deleting   one   item   from
the   original   scale),   but   Model   3   parallels   the   original   factor
solution   of   the   Spanish   adolescent   version   (Morales   et   al.,
2015)   and   most   validations   of   the   SHAI   (e.g.,   Kocjan,   2016;
Morales   et   al.,   2015;   te   Poel   et   al.,   2017;   Zhang   et   al.,   2015),

The   descriptive   data   for   the   items   are   presented   in   Table   4.
In   general,   the   items   showed   low   means   (Mmean =   1.65,   range:
1.23-2.31)   and   low   standard   deviations   (MSD =   0.63,   range:

itive   skewness   (MSk =   1.01,   range   [0.05-2.79])   and   kurtosis
(MK =   1.5,   range   [-0.17-8.52]).

The   SHAI   total   score   and   subscales   demonstrated   ade-

Correlations   between   the   SHAI   and   the   study
measures

Table   5   presents   the   relationships   among   the   SHAI,   the   other
self-report   measures,   and   the   demographic   data.   Regarding
the   intercorrelations,   high   and   signiﬁcant   correlations   were
obtained   between   the   SHAI   total   score   and   its   subscales
with   the   other   study   measures,   but   only   moderate   relation-
ships   were   found   between   the   two   SHAI-subscales,   which
indicates   that   they   were   assessing   different   but   related
aspects   of   health   anxiety.   The   SHAI   total   score   and   the   Illness
likelihood   subscale   showed   signiﬁcant   and   high   correlations
with   the   Whiteley   Index,   which   assesses   hypochondriacal
symptoms,   and   medium   associations   with   the   other   psy-
chopathological   measures.   The   Negative   consequences   of

with   the   other   measures,   with   the   exception   of   the   ASI-3,
which   showed   a   small   association.   The   sizes   of   the   correla-
tions   among   the   Illness   likelihood   subscale,   hypochondriacal
symptoms,   and   anxiety   sensitivity   were   signiﬁcantly   higher
than   between   the   WI   and   ASI-3   and   the   Negative   conse-
quences   of   illness   subscale   (WI:   z   =   6.45,   p   <   .001;   ASI-3:
z   =   2.27,   p   =   .01).   Age   was   signiﬁcantly   and   negatively   cor-
related   with   the   SHAI   total   scale   and   the   Illness   likelihood
subscale,   although   the   size   of   the   coefﬁcient   was   small.   No
signiﬁcant   correlations   were   found   between   the   SHAI   scores
and   gender.

Differences   in   the   SHAI   between   community
participants   and   patients   with   hypochondriasis

Community   participants   and   patients   with   hypochondria-
sis   obtained   signiﬁcantly   different   scores   on   the   SHAI,   with
patients   showing   higher   total   scores   (M   =   29.67,   SD   =   6.35   vs.
M   =   54.26,   SD   =   5.51;   t (366) =   20.60,   p   <   .001,   Cohen’   d   =   4.13)

(M   =   6.25,   SD   =   2.03   vs.   M   =   10.81,   SD   =   1.88;   t (366) =   12.12,   p
<   .001,   Cohen’   d   =   2.33).

Diagnostic   accuracy   of   the   SHAI

The   SHAI   total   score   revealed   a   high   AUC,  
indicating
excellent   discriminatory   power   (AUC   =   .99;   95%   conﬁdence
interval   =   .98   to   .99).   As   Table   6   shows,   a   SHAI   total   cut-
off   score   of   40.5   resulted   in   the   highest   Youden   index,
with   values   of   100%   and   95%   for   sensitivity   and   speciﬁcity,
respectively.   This   score   corresponded   to   the   95th percentile
obtained   in   the   non-clinical   sample.

Discussion

its   psychometric   properties  

The   present   study   aimed   to   analyze   the   factor   struc-
ture   of   the   SHAI   and  
in   a
healthy   adult   Spanish   sample   and   calculate   the   optimal
cutoff   point   to   identify   clinically   signiﬁcant   health   anxi-
ety   symptoms.   Conﬁrmatory   factor   analysis   indicated   that
the   two-factor   model   described   in   the   original   version   of
the   scale   (Salkovskis   et   al.,   2002),   the   two-factor   model
proposed   by   Wheaton   et   al.   (2010),   and   the   three-factor
model   suggested   by   Abramowitz,   Deacon   et   al.   (2007)   pro-
vided   an   adequate   data   ﬁt.   In   light   of   the   results   obtained,
we   decided   to   maintain   the   two-factor   model   proposed
originally   by   Salkovskis   et   al.   (2002),   based   on   parsimony
and   the   greater   support   found   in   the   literature   for   this
structure,   as   was

Overall,   our   ﬁndings   suggest   good   internal   consistency   of
the   Spanish   version   of   the   SHAI.   The   internal   consistency
of   the   SHAI   total   scale   was   similar   to   what   was   found   in
other   studies   (Morales   et   al.,   2016),   although   some   studies
have   reported   slightly   higher   internal   consistency   (˛
  range:
.91-.96)   (Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et   al.,   2007;   Kocjan,   2016).
Furthermore,   the   Illness   likelihood   subscale   demonstrated
adequate   internal   consistency,   whereas   the   Negative   conse-
quences   of   illness   subscale   only   showed   acceptable   internal
consistency.   Overall,   these   results   are   congruent   with   those
reported   in   the   original   study   by   Salkovskis   et   al.   (2002)
and   other   studies   (e.g.,   Morales   et   al.,   2015;   te   Poel   et   al.,
2017;   Zhang   et   al.,   2015)   that   have   consistently   reported
that   the   Negative   consequences   of   illness   subscale   shows   a
lower   internal   consistency.   This   result   might   be   due,   at   least
in   part,   to   the   reduced   number   of   items   on   the   subscale.   In
addition,   the   SHAI   subscales   were   relatively   independent,

which   means   that   each   of   them   assesses   a   related   but   dis-
tinct   dimension   of   health   anxiety.

Our   ﬁndings   support   the   convergent   and   divergent   valid-
ity   of   the   SHAI   and   its   subscales.   Speciﬁcally,   the   SHAI
total   score   and   the   Illness   likelihood   subscale   were   strongly
associated   with   a   widely   used   measure   of   hypochondri-
acal   symptoms,   the   Whiteley   Index,   but   they   were   only
moderately   associated   with   other   psychological   constructs
different   from   health   anxiety   (i.e.,   obsessive-compulsive
symptoms,   worry,   anxiety   sensitivity,   and   depression).

Similarly,   Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et   al.   (2007)   found   sig-
niﬁcant   associations   (strong   to   moderate)   between   the
SHAI   subscales   and   theoretically   related   constructs   (e.g.,
body   vigilance,   worry),   and   low   associations   with   other
psychopathology   measures.   The   Negative   consequences
of  
illness   subscale   was   moderately   associated   with   all
the   symptom   measures.   These   results   are   also   congruent
with   other   studies   that   have   shown   moderate   associations
between   the   SHAI   total   score   and   Illness   likelihood   and   Neg-
ative   consequences   of   illness   subscales   and   anxious   and
depressive   symptoms   (Kocjan,   2016;   Zhang   et   al.,   2015).
The   evidence   of   construct   validity   is   more   convincing   for   the
SHAI-total   score   and   the   Illness   likelihood   subscale   because
the   associations   with   hypochondriacal   symptoms   are   clearly
higher   than   with   the   other   measures.   However,   the   Neg-
ative   consequences   of   illness   subscale   maintained   similar
correlations   with   all   the   other   measures,   which   supports   its
discriminant   validity,   but   not   its   convergent   validity.
Regarding   the   demographic   variables,   our   data  

indi-
cate   that   younger   people   scored   higher   on   the   SHAI   total
scale   and   the  
likelihood   subscale,   thus   showing
higher   health   anxiety   symptoms.   Nonetheless,  
it   should
be   noted   that   the   size   of   the   association   was   weak,   as
in   the   Abramowitz,   Deacon   et   al.   (2007)   study.   By   con-
trast,   the   Dutch   study   of   the   SHAI   found   a   negative
association   between   age   and   the   Negative   consequences
of   illness   subscale   (te   Poel   et   al.,   2017),   and   other   stud-
ies   in   adult   samples   (Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et   al.,   2007;
Wheaton   et   al.,   2010)   and   adolescents   (Morales   et   al.,
2015,   2016)   did   not   ﬁnd   differences   between   the   SHAI
scores   and   age.   Overall,   the   results   for   the   relationships
between   age   and   the   SHAI   scores   are   not   consistent   across
studies.   Something   similar   occurs   in   the   case   of   gender,
with   some   studies   reporting   higher   scores   in   women,   but
with   small   effect   sizes   (Abramowitz,   Deacon   et   al.,   2007;
Morales   et   al.,   2015,   2016;   te   Poel   et   al.,   2017),   whereas
other   studies   (Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et   al.,   2007;   Wheaton
et   al.,   2010),   as   in   the   current   one,   did   not   ﬁnd   gender
differences.

Illness  

An   important   aspect   of   the   usefulness   of   a   self-report
that   assesses   clinical   vs   non-clinical   symptoms   is   its   poten-
tial   ability   to   differentiate   patients   from   non-patients.
Our   results   showed   that   hypochondriacal   patients   obtained
higher   scores   on   the   SHAI   and   its   subscales   than   healthy
participants,   which   indicates   that   the   questionnaire   has   sig-
niﬁcant   divergent   and   construct   validity.   Salkovskis   et   al.
(2002)   found   a   similar   result   when   comparing   the   hypochon-
driacal   patients’   scores   in   their   study   to   the   scores   of   a
community   sample.

As   for   the   accuracy   of   the   SHAI-total   score   in   differenti-
ating   patients   with   hypochondriasis   from   non-patients,   we
found   that   a   cutoff   point   of   40.5   differentiates   between
those   who   are   strongly   concerned   about   their   health   status
and   those   with   a   normal   concern   for   their   health.   This   score
was   similar   to   the   reported   in   the   Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et
al.   (2007)   study   to   differentiate   patients   with   hypochondria-
sis   from   patients   with   anxiety   disorders,   but   it   is   lower   than
the   cutoff   scores   reported   in   other   studies.   For   example,
Kocjan   (2016)   suggested   a   total   score   of   45   to   identify   prob-
lematic   health   anxiety.   Other   authors   reported   lower   cutoff
scores,   from   33   to   26   to   identify   people   with   excessive   con-
cerns   about   health   (Zhang   et   al.,   2015).   Nonetheless,   as

different   authors   stated   (Alberts   et   al.,   2013;   Hedman   et   al.,
2015),   although   the   aforementioned   cutoff   scores   are   widely
used,   there   are   not   enough   data   supporting   them.   The
different   studies   used   diverse   samples   (e.g.,   from   under-
graduate   students   to   cardiovascular   patients),   or   they   did
not   even   specify   the   population   in   which   the   cutoff   score
was   obtained   or   the   rationale   applied   to   calculate   it.   In   our
study,   the   cutoff   score   obtained   is   very   similar   to   the   one
obtained   by   Abramowitz,   Olatunji   et   al.   (2007),   which,   as
far   as   we   know,   is   the   only   published   study   that   used   a   sam-
ple   of   hypochondriacal   patients   in   their   analyses,   as   in   the
current   study.

This   study   has   some   limitations.   The   retrospective   and
cross-sectional   design   could   be   inﬂuential   in   introducing
some   respondent   biases   when   faced   with   a   self-report,   thus
preventing   us   from   drawing   causal   inferences   about   the
relationships   between   health   anxiety   and   other   symptoms
apart   from   hypochondriacal   ones.   The   limited   sample   size
of   patients   with   hypochondriasis   is   another   limitation,   which
means   that   caution   should   be   used   in   generalizing   the   ﬁnd-
ings   to   broader   and   more   representative   samples.   Moreover,
the   absence   of   a   control   group   of   patients   with   a   disorder
different   from   hypochondriasis   keeps   us   from   making   sug-
gestions   about   the   speciﬁcity   of   health   anxiety   to   patients
with   hypochondriasis.

Despite   the   aforementioned  

limitations,   the   present
study   provides   support   for   the   two-factor   structure   of   the
SHAI,   as   proposed   by   its   original   authors   (Salkovskis   et   al.,
2002).   Moreover,   the   Spanish   version   of   the   SHAI   has   been
shown   to   be   sensitive   in   assessing   the   range   of   health   con-
cerns   from   normality   to   severity,   and   it   offers   a   cutoff   point
to   reliably   differentiate   between   non-clinical   and   clinically
signiﬁcant   health   anxiety   symptoms.   This   cutoff   score   can
be   used   not   only   in   clinical   practice   for   screening   purposes,
but   also   in   epidemiological   studies.   Taken   together,   our   ﬁnd-
ings   support   the   SHAI’s   adequacy   for   use   in   Spanish   adult
community   samples.
