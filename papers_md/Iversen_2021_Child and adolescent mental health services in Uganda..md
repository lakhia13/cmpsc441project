Abstract 
Introduction:  Worldwide, one in five children and adolescents suffer from mental health disorders, while facing lim-
ited opportunities for treatment and recovery. Growing up, they face multiple challenges that might contribute to the 
development of mental disorders. Uganda is a developing country with a history of prolonged civil and regional wars 
associated with child soldiers, large numbers of refugees and internally displaced people due to natural disasters and 
unrests, and a large infectious disease burden mainly due to acute respiratory tract infections, malaria and HIV/AIDS.

Objective:  This paper aims to examine the current status of child and adolescent mental health services in Uganda.

Methodology:  A scoping review approach was used to select studies on child and adolescent mental health ser-
vices (CAMHS) in Uganda. A search of MEDLINE, Wiley and PubMed databases was conducted using eligibility criteria. 
The papers were summarized in tables and then synthesized using the Frameworks for monitoring health systems 
performance designed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This was done according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Review and M-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines.

Results:  Twelve studies were identified; five of them  used qualitative methods and focused mostly on the current 
limitations and strengths of CAMHS in Uganda, while six quantitative studies investigated the effects of new interven-
tions. One study used a mixed-methods approach. In summary, the papers outlined a need for collaboration with the 
primary health sector and traditional healers to ensure additional human resources, as well as the need to focus on 
groups such as orphans, HIV/AIDS-affected youth, former child soldiers and refugees. 

Conclusion:  Relatively few studies have been conducted on CAMHS in Uganda, and most of those that exist are part 
of larger studies involving multiple countries. CAMHS in Uganda require improvement and needs to focus especially 
on vulnerable groups such as orphans, HIV/AIDS-affected youth and former child soldiers.

Background
Mental health is integral to overall health, as stated by 
the first Director-General of the World Health Organi-
zation  (WHO),  Dr.  Brock  Chisholm,  in  1954:  “without 
mental health, there can be no true physical health” (1). 
While mental health is a key element of WHO’s defini-
tion of health, there is a significant lack of funding and 
availability  of  mental  health  services,  including  Child 
and  adolescent  mental  health  services  (CAMHS)  that

assess  and  treat  young  people  with  emotional,  behav-
ioral  or  mental  health  difficulties  [1].  For  example,  in 
Uganda,  there  are  only  five  child  and  adolescent  psy-
chiatrists for more than 20 million children and adoles-
cents  [2,  3].  Children  and  adolescents  worldwide  may 
also  be  exposed  to  stress,  such  as  pressure  from  peers 
and  at  school  or  difficulties  in  accepting  their  identity 
and  sexuality,  as  well  as  pressure  from  social  media 
on  issues  such  as  body  image,  success  and  popularity 
[4,  5].  The  stress  they  go  through  contributes  to  one 
in  five  children  and  adolescents  worldwide  suffering 
from mental illnesses, and access to treatment is insuf-
ficient  and/or  unevenly  distributed  [5].  Half  of  those 
with mental illness have symptoms before the age of 14, 
and early intervention is crucial to better outcomes [6]. 
Worldwide, there is therefore an urgent need for a scal-
ing  up  of  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  services 
[7].

A  large  proportion  of  the  Ugandan  population  are 
children  and  adolescents  (57%  are  under  15  years), 
grappling  with  many  of  the  issues  outlined  above;  this 
is  compounded  by  prevailing  poverty,  with  20%  of  the 
population living below the poverty line [3]. Uganda also 
has  a  history  of  prolonged  armed  conflicts,  such  as  that 
in  the  north  of  the  country  involving  the  Lord’s  Resist-
ance  Army  which  lasted  about  20  years  and  resulted  in 
1.7 million children living without their parents from the 
various  armed  conflicts  [8].  Orphans  are  more  likely  to 
have greater emotional needs, to be insecure and to live 
in  poverty  with  elderly  widowed  female  caregivers  [8]. 
In addition to facing the regular challenges of childhood 
and  adolescence,  many  young  people  in  Uganda,  there-
fore, have to combat additional challenges that contribute 
to a great burden of suffering [9, 8].

Moreover,  the  conflict  with  the  Lord’s  Resistance 
Army led not only to orphanhood but also to the abduc-
tion of children and adolescents to be used as child sol-
diers [10]. Even though this conflict has now ceased the 
consequences  persist,  as  abducted  children  were  forced 
to  carry  out  raids  and  kill  and  mutilate  others,  and  up 
to  97.7%  of  them  have  later  experienced  Post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  (PTSD) [8]. Among these  children, more 
than  one-third  of  abducted  girls  were  also  sexually 
abused  [8].  Another  issue  is  that  former  child  soldiers 
and  their  families  face  discrimination  and  social  stigma 
due to their association with the Lord’s Resistance Army, 
adding  to  the  risk  of  them  developing  mental  disorders 
[5, 8, 10]. Early intervention could prevent or reduce both 
current and future mental health symptoms [11].

Uganda has made remarkable strides in peaceful devel-
opment  and  reducing  poverty  over  recent  years,  and 
this has translated into greater investment in health care 
overall.  However,  funding  remains  low  by  international 

standards;  for  example  as  of  2019  only  9.8%  of  Gross 
Domestic  Product  (GDP)  was  allocated  to  health  and 
only  1%  of  GDP  was  allocated  for  mental  health  ser-
vices  [12]. The  allocation  to  mental  health  care  includes 
services  for  adults  as  well  as  children  and  adolescents 
[12].  This  picture  highlights  the  very  low  prioritization 
of  mental  health  services  in  dispensing  of  resources  in 
Uganda  despite  the  adoption  of  the  Child  and  Adoles-
cent Mental Health Policy Guidelines in 2017 [13]. These 
guidelines were designed to promote Mental Health and 
prevent mental, neurological and substance use disorders 
among children and adolescents [13]. The specific objec-
tives  of  these  policy  guidelines  are  [13]:  (1)  To  increase 
knowledge,  understanding  and  involvement  of  policy 
makers,  service  providers,  families,  community  lead-
ers  and  other  stakeholders  for  the  promotion  of  Mental 
Health  and  prevention  of  mental,  neurological  and  sub-
stance  use  disorders  in  children  and  adolescents;  (2)  To 
build  capacity,  improve  access  and  availability  of  com-
prehensive  CAMHS  for  care  and  treatment  of  children 
and  adolescents  affected  by  them  including  psychologi-
cal  treatment  and  rehabilitation  of  such  children;  (3)  To 
strengthen  research,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  child 
and  adolescent  mental  health;  (4)  To  inform  the  devel-
opment  and  review  of  policies  and  legislation  relating 
to child and adolescent mental health; (5) To strengthen 
multi-sectoral collaboration and participation in provid-
ing quality CAMHS. The guidelines are intended for use 
by  all  government  sectors  and  civil  society  stakehold-
ers  for  a  period  of  ten  years  following  adoption  in  2017 
[13]. The Ugandan guidelines are not stand alone but are 
supported by global initiatives such as the WHO Mental 
Health  Gap  Action  Programme  (mhGAP)  and  mhGAP 
Intervention  Guide  (mhGAP-IG)  which  have  attempted 
to  address  the  substantial  needs  for  mental  health  ser-
vices. WHO calls for the mhGAP-IG to be implemented 
in  both  pre-service  and  in-service  training,  integrating 
mental health into primary health care in the long term 
[14]. Several studies have examined the current status of 
CAMHS in the country, but there is no general overview 
of  the  situation  that  would  allow  for  recommendations 
for  the  future  to  be  made.  This  paper  aims  to  examine 
the current status of CAMHS in Uganda so as to inform 
implementation  of  the  Ugandan  Child  and  Adolescent 
Mental Health Policy Guidelines of 2017.

Methodology
This study used a scoping review approach and employed 
the following eligibility criteria for papers to be included:

•  Written in English
•  Published between January 2000 and July 2020
•  Countries of origin of study: Uganda

Iversen et al. Int J Ment Health Syst           (2021) 15:66

•  Study  design:  randomized  controlled  trial,  blind 
trial, non-blind trial, adaptive clinical  trial, non-ran-
domized trial, interrupted time series design, cohort 
study, case–control study and cross-sectional study.

Three  databases  (PubMed,  MEDLINE,  Wiley  Online 
Library) were searched between August 2020 and Octo-
ber 2020 using the terms «mental health services», «psy-
chiatry», «child and adolescent», «youth» and «Uganda». 
Titles  and  abstracts  were  examined  using  the  inclusion 
criteria, after which full articles were retrieved. This was 
done  according  to  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Sys-
tematic  Review  and  M-Analyses  Extension  for  Scoping 
Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines [15].

Two of the researchers reviewers (S.A.I., N.S:) extracted 
the  relevant  data  from  the  included  studies  with  a  pre-
defined  data  recording  form,  addressing  the  search  cri-
teria.  Both  researchers  checked  the  completeness  and 
accuracy  of  the  data  extraction  for  all  included  studies. 
To  resolve  discrepancies,  other  co-authors  were  con-
sulted  to  help  with  consensus  development. The  follow-
ing  core  data  were  extracted  from  all  included  studies: 
title, authors, and other publication details; study design 
and aim, setting (place and time of recruitment/data col-
lection),  study  population  characteristics  (age,  gender, 
and  diagnostic  criteria  used,  sample  size  etc.),  interven-
tion characteristics (type of medication used, duration of 
intervention); methods of outcome measurement, (statis-
tical methods and results related to the outcomes).

Results
Study selection

The initial online search produced 185 articles. Following 
the  screening  of  all  titles  41  eligible  papers  were  identi-
fied,  and  then  nine  duplicates  were  removed.  Finally,  32 
full papers were assessed, 20 papers were excluded as not 
meeting inclusion criteria and 12 papers were included in 
the review.

General description

The  majority  of  the  research  papers  were  qualitative 
(n = 5) or quantitative studies (n = 6), while n = 1 used a 
mixed-methodology approach.

Table 1 summarizes the key findings regarding the cur-

rent challenges and limitations of CAMHS  in Uganda.

Lastly,  findings  were  summarized  based  on  the  six 
core  components  of  the  Frameworks  for  monitoring 
health  systems  performance  designed  by  WHO,  which 
is a tool to assess health systems through the key indi-
cators of inputs, processes, outputs and outcome [15].

Health service delivery

This refers to the availability and distribution of health 
care,  including  factors  such  as  comprehensiveness, 
accessibility,  coverage,  continuity,  quality,  person-cen-
tredness, coordination and accountability of the system 
[27].  One  study  cited  limited  service  capacity,  under-
staffing and burden from other diseases as an issue for 
the  continuity  and  coverage  of  CAMHS,  and  reported 
that  available  services  were  not  child-  and  adolescent-
friendly  and  were  absent  at  lower-level  health  centres 
(primary  health  care  centres)  [16].  Another  barrier  to 
the  availability  of  CAMHS  was  that  parents  tend  to 
turn to traditional healers first with their children, and 
such healers might not trust biomedical health systems 
and  then  choose  to  not  refer  children  to  CAMHS  [17] 
(Table 1).

There  is  a  lack  of  collaboration  between  CAMHS  and 
other  sectors  within  and  outside  the  health  system  in 
Uganda,  such  as  traditional  healers  and  the  primary 
health care sector [11]. CAMHS is also not yet integrated 
into  primary  health  care,  which  could  improve  access 
to  these  services.  This  kind  of  collaboration  should  be 
sought after, but the training of primary health care pro-
fessionals  has  yet  to  fully  begin  [18–22]  (Table  1).  This 
could  give  CAMHS  increased  continuity  and  accessibil-
ity, as described in the WHO frameworks [27].

Other  studies  called  for  collaboration  between  mental 
health  treatment  and  HIV  treatment,  due  to  common 
co-occurrence,  which  creates  a  double  burden  of  dis-
ease [18]. HIV-infected youth are often exposed to addi-
tional stressors such as stigma, orphanhood, poverty and 
neglect that make them vulnerable to developing mental 
health  disorders.  In  addition,  the  stress  that  comes  with 
being infected can itself affect their mental health nega-
tively  or  worsen  already  present  symptoms.  However, 
these  issues  are  rarely  addressed  in  the  country’s  health 
systems;  even  though  youth  are  receiving  treatment  for 
HIV,  they  should  also  receive  support  and  counselling 
for  mental  health  [16].  Another  vulnerable  group  was 
found  to  be  children  and  adolescents  struggling  with 
alcohol and substance use disorders, but they were rarely 
approached except for a few outreach activities in schools 
[18].

Health workforce (input)

Findings  pointed  towards  a  shortage  of  CAMHS 
resources,  including  human  resources,  service  facilities 
and  funding,  with  an  insufficient  number  of  CAMHS 
professionals  and  also  students  in  training  [16,  18,  11] 
(Table 1). The services available are affected by issues of 
understaffing  and  low  capacity;  thus,  there  was  a  need 
described for an upgrade of both both human resources 
and  service  facilities  [16].  Currently,  there  are  only  five

child  psychiatrists  in  the  whole  country,  compared  with 
one  traditional  healer  per  500  inhabitants  to  whom 
patients  tend  to  turn  instead  [17,  21]  (Table  1).  Further 
task-sharing and in-service and pre-service training was 
described urgently needed, as this could help to integrate 
CAMHS into primary health care [22, 22].

Health information systems (overall policy and regulation)

This  component  refers  to  the  overall  policy  and  regula-
tion of health systems and can be based on data at indi-
vidual, health facility and population levels, and on public 
health  surveillance.  At  the  national  level  in  Uganda  the 
competency of health management information systems 
was  found  to  be  sufficient,  but  that  was  not  the  case  at 
the  district  level.  However,  a  stand-alone  policy  paper 
was drawn up for CAMHS in 2017, with an approach to 
increase  availability  and  accessibility  of  quality  CAMHS 
that aims to address the problems of underutilization of 
mental,  neurological  and  substance  health  services  by 
children  and  adolescents  due  to  insensitivity  of  country 
health  services,  missed  and  mismanaged  of  early  symp-
toms  by  parents,  limited  knowledge  of  mental  health 
disorders  and  inadequate  availability  of  quality  CAMHS 
and also provides structure for the promotion of mental 
health  of  children  and  adolescent  in  different  settings 
[13].

In  addition,  the  health  management  information  sys-
tem was found to be insufficient for service planning, and 
resources  were  not  distributed  equally.  Another  study 
showed that stigma might contribute to the low priority 
given to mental health, and this in turn adds to the bur-
den for children and adolescents and health care workers 
alike [17] (Table 1).

Access to essential medicines (output—availability 
and distribution of care)

Access to medication was found to be adequate and was 
offered at lower-level health centres as well. The availabil-
ity of medications was regulated according to the Essen-
tial  drug  list  for  Uganda;  however,  this  also  depends  on 
the presence of trained staff members who know how to 
use  the  drugs  [18].  However,  these  services  receive  low 
priority  and  low  levels  of  investment,  contributing  to 
further  stigma  and  patients  not  seeking  medication  and 
treatment [16]. Levels of education of caregivers also play 
a  role  in  stigma  and  attitudes  associated  with  CAMHS: 
no  or  low  levels  of  education  could  add  to  stigma  but 
may also lead to inadequate incomes, limiting their abil-
ity  to  pay  for  drugs  and  treatment  [16].  Parents  or  car-
egivers might also view and handle symptoms and mental 
issues differently from the formal health system and seek 

out other treatments such as those offered by traditional 
healers [17] (Table 1).

Generally,  the  studies  found  issues  of  poor  public 
awareness and low willingness to seek treatment, as well 
as stigma against mental disorders. There could be a lack 
of  motivation  and  knowledge  to  seek  out  treatment  but 
also  pressure  from  families,  and  drug  costs  could  play  a 
role [16]. Other barriers to treatment were family, com-
munity and individual attitudes, contributing to the bur-
den of disease and a lack of help-seeking behaviour [16] 
(Table 1).

Health systems financing (input)

Services  were  underfunded  by  the  government,  and  no 
donor funding was noted [18]. Funding was often geared 
towards mental health care in general and not centred on 
children  and  adolescents.  However,  the  same  was  noted 
for  all  health  services  including  primary  health  care,  so 
in-kind support in the form of collaborations and refur-
bishment  of  infrastructure  could  be  a  way  around  this 
issue [18] (Table 1).

CAMHS is absent at lower-level health centres, hence 
the services are not yet offered in the primary health sec-
tor  [11].  Moreover,  the  services  available  were  found  to 
be underfunded and centred around urban areas, mean-
ing long travel distances and high costs for many in need 
[16]. Transport difficulties, transport time and costs can 
make such services inaccessible for children and adoles-
cents in rural areas, who have few places nearby to seek 
help.  The  services  offered  in  lower-level  health  centres 
were  mostly  centred  on  epilepsy,  and  psychosocial  ser-
vices were noted only in the national referral hospital [18] 
(Table  1).  This  is  all  connected  to  the  lack  of  CAMHS-
related legislation, policies and human resources [26].

Leadership and governance

One of the papers in the study, dating from 2015, found 
existing national mental health policies to be inadequate. 
These  policies  build  on  the  United  Nations  Convention 
on  the  Right  of  the  Child,  the  1995  Constitution  of  the 
Republic  of  Uganda,  the  Mental  Health  Treatment  Act 
1964 and the Children Act 1996, but in 2015 there was no 
standalone policy on CAMHS itself. The laws and guide-
lines  were  acknowledged  at  the  national  level,  but  there 
was found to be little awareness at the district level [18]. 
However, since then, new policy guidelines for CAMHS 
have been designed, and were introduced in 2017 [13].

Several studies found there to be a lack of research and 
support  for  mental  health  needs,  and  this  presents  an 
enormous  burden  for  which  cost‐effective  solutions  are 
urgently needed [16, 11]. There is a lack of strategies and 
policies nationally, and those that exist tend to be focused 
on adult psychiatry and not on children and adolescents

[18]  (Table  1).  This  lack  of  attention  to  the  planning 
of  services  and  legislation  adds  to  the  burden  of  both 
patients and health care workers [26] (Table 1).

Discussion
This paper provides an overview of services available for 
children and adolescents with mental health disorders in 
Uganda, their limitations and potential, and gives recom-
mendations  for  the  future.  Twelve  eligible  studies  were 
identified,  five  of  which  were  qualitative  studies  and  six 
quantitative, while one used a mixed-methods approach. 
CAMHS in Uganda requires improvement and needs to 
focus  especially  on  vulnerable  groups  such  as  orphans, 
HIV/AIDS-affected  youth  and  former  child  soldiers. 
These  services  show  potential  and  there  are  multiple 
ways  to  address  their  limitations,  such  as  collaboration 
with other sectors, integration into primary  health care, 
reduction of stigma and a strengthened health workforce.
All  studies  reviewed  showed  that  there  is  both  an 
insufficient  workforce  and  a  lack  of  collaboration  in  the 
current  CAMHS  in  Uganda.  Multiple  studies  recom-
mended  increased  collaboration  to  solve  the  problem 
of  the  shortage  of  health  professionals.  Also,  due  to  the 
double  burden  of  HIV/AIDS  and  mental  distress,  with 
HIV  being  widespread  in  the  country,  effective  public 
health  interventions  and  collaboration  with  the  HIV/
AIDS health care system are vital [16]. Another solution 
examined  is  for  traditional  healers  and  the  biomedical 
sector to collaborate and potentially share the same refer-
ral systems, filling each other’s gaps. This solution has a 
lot  of  potential  as  some  traditional  healers  are  already 
using a number of biomedical methods, and due to their 
large  numbers  and  presence  in  communities  they  might 
be  seen  as  more  approachable  than  health  profession-
als [17]. However, some traditional healers are  sceptical 
about  the  biomedical  health  care  system  and  vice  versa, 
so  collaboration  might  not  be  so  simple  to  achieve  [11]. 
Other recommendations point to the implementation of 
CAMHS  in  primary  health  care,  such  as  at  lower-level 
health  care  centres.  This  implementation  should  aim  to 
achieve increased access and effective utilization of men-
tal  health  services,  while  also  increasing  awareness  of 
CAMHS [21, 22].

There  is  a  need  for  more  effective  dissemination  of 
national  policies,  including  the  recently  created  stan-
dalone  mental  health  policy  for  children  and  adoles-
cents, but such policies need to be put into practice [13, 
18]. For policies to succeed, the factors discussed above 
must  be  taken  into  account,  and  increased  funding  is 
needed [18].

International  organizations  and  non-government 
organizations  (NGOs)  may  also  play  a  critical  role  in 
the  planning  and  funding  of  mental  health  services. 

As mentioned earlier, only 1% of Uganda’s GDP is cur-
rently  spent  on  mental  health  care,  which  is  not  suf-
ficient  [12]  (even  if  there  are  other  sources  of  funding 
such  as  AIDS  or  NGOs  for  mental  health  services 
which  are  not  captured  by  the  scientific  publications 
included  in  this  study).  It  is  also  important  to  encour-
age collaboration with stakeholders such as NGOs and 
policymakers, involving them in policy processes [18].

For  the  integration  of  services  into  primary  health 
care,  primary  health  care  workers  must  be  trained  in 
child  and  adolescent  mental  health  and  there  is  also 
a  need  to  improve  training  and  introduce  additional 
training for all mental health care professionals includ-
ing  nurses.    This  could  improve  identification  and 
reporting  of  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  cases 
by primary health care clinics. The health workers who 
are  trained  need  to  gain  a  perspective  that  includes 
both medical and public health-related factors, and ser-
vices  and  the  workforce  need  to  be  utilized  to  a  maxi-
mum [22]. 

Lay  workers  and  peers  who  are  already  present  in  the 
health  and  education  systems  need  to  be  utilized  and 
trained  to  provide  mental  health  interventions.  Recom-
mendations  call  for  both  the  training  of  primary  health 
care  professionals  and  the  integration  of  CAMHS  into 
existing  sectors  for  better  accessibility  and  increased 
resources [21, 22].

Access  to  medications  could  be  improved  by  educat-
ing staff at lower-level health centres to clarify when and 
why  to  use  such  medications  to  help  children  and  ado-
lescents  [18].  Due  to  the  stigma  associated  with  mental 
illness  amongst  children  and  adolescents,  the  attitudes 
of  both  society  and  individuals  need  to  be  changed  if 
new  interventions  and  increased  access  to  care  are  to 
succeed.  Young  people  must  be  able  to  recognize  and 
respond appropriately to signs of distress, reduced func-
tioning  and  other  early  signs  of  poor  mental  health  [16, 
19]. Therefore, stigma reduction strategies and awareness 
campaigns  aimed  at  individuals,  families  and  communi-
ties are recommended, such as asset-based interventions, 
i.e.,  child  development  accounts,  which  are  critical  in 
reducing  risks  associated  with  mental  health  challenges 
[19].

Finally, multiple studies suggest and explore new inter-
ventions  to  develop  CAMHS,  such  as  collaborations 
between multiple sectors. One example here is the dou-
ble burden of HIV/AIDS and mental distress, where the 
primary health care sector should aim to increase access 
and effective utilization of services for patients consider-
ing all aspects of physical and mental health.

One  way  to  increase  the  knowledge  of  primary  health 
care  workers  in  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  is 
through  the  provision  of  in-service  training,  based  on 

 Iversen et al. Int J Ment Health Syst           (2021) 15:66 

Page 10 of 12

the  mhGAP-IG.  However,  further  studies  are  called  for 
on  task-sharing  and  integrating  CAMHS  into  a  larger 
sample  of  primary  health  care  clinics,  including  a  com-
munity  mobilization  component  in  the  intervention  to 
improve CAMHS attendance [21, 22]. This kind of train-
ing should be offered as both pre- and in-service training. 
Pre-service training is more cost-effective as staff do not 
have to take time off work, and students who have not yet 
finished their education can get an early introduction to 
the field [28, 29, 30, 31].

A  different  solution  is  further  task-sharing  with  com-
munities,  implementing  different  types  of  treatment. 
In  one  study,  community-implemented  trauma  therapy 
showed  a  reduction  in  PTSD  and  other  mental  health 
disorders,  especially  for  the  group  receiving  narrative 
exposure  therapy  [23].  Therefore,  community-based 
interventions  can  be  effective  for  children  and  adoles-
cents  affected  by  PTSD  and  other  mental  disorders. 
Involving  members  of  the  community  to  address  men-
tal  health  disorders  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  and 
should be used further [23].

Another  intervention  often  examined  is  economic 
empowerment.  In  one  study,  female  participants  receiv-
ing this intervention showed an improvement in mental 
health  function  over  time.  The  intervention  focused  on 
females  affected  by  HIV/AIDS  in  low-income  settings, 
and economic empowerment took the form of peer men-
torship  and/or  economic  strengthening  [19].  A  similar 
intervention  for  children  saw  an  improvement  in  their 
mental  health  functioning,  such  as  reduced  levels  of 
hopelessness  and  depression.  These  results  have  further 
implications  for  public  health  programmes  intended  for 
long-term  care  of  children  living  in  resource-poor  or 
AIDS-affected  communities  [24].  Another  study  agreed 
that  there  was  evidence  for  the  effects  of  economic 
empowerment  interventions  on  children’s  well-being 
including  self-rated  health  and  mental  health  function-
ing. This was also true for children affected by the double 
burden of HIV/AIDS and mental illness, and this calls for 
improved public policy and health programming for this 
group [24, 25].

Using  the  Frameworks  for  monitoring  health  systems 
performance  designed  by  WHO,  we  have  examined  the 
current  state  of  CAMHS  in  Uganda  [27].  Our  findings 
show  potential  for  both  development  and  new  inter-
ventions,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  increasing  acces-
sibility  and  distribution  of  these  services.  As  previously 
described,  children  and  adolescents  are  already  vulner-
able due to the changes they experience as they become 
older, but this is especially so in countries such as Uganda 
due  to  the  high  proportion  of  young  people  in  the  total 
population,  diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  conflicts,  and 
poverty.

The challenges Uganda is facing in the area of child and 
adolescent  mental  health  are  not  unique,  and  there  is  a 
widening  mental  health  treatment  gap  for  children  and 
adolescents in all sub-Saharan Africa [32]. The region has 
few economic or human resources dedicated to the men-
tal health of children and young people [32]. For example, 
a  recent  study  from  Tanzania  aimed  to  identify,  assimi-
late  and  analyze  the  literature  on  child  and  adolescent 
psychiatry highlighted the limited resources for child and 
adolescent mental health and the need for more research 
in the area [33].

Other regions with a high proportion of low- and mid-
dle-income  countries  for  example  the  countries  in  the 
Middle East and Asia face similar challenges [34, 35].

For  CAMHS  in  Uganda  to  improve,  more  research 
is  needed,  and  development  needs  to  build  on  existing 
resources, such as those of the primary health care sector.

Strengths and limitations of the study

To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review to pro-
vide  an  overview  of  child  and  adolescent  mental  health 
services in Uganda. However, Certain limitations of this 
study  should  be  consideredin  interpreting  the  findings. 
for  example,  only  few  studies  had  Uganda  as  their  main 
focus,  with  majority  focusing  on  multiple  countries. 
Many of the studies only focused on specific groups such 
as  those  affected  by  HIV/AIDS  and  not  the  child  and 
adolescent  population  in  general.  The  limited  number 
of  studies  available  shows  the  need  for  further  research 
on  this  topic,  as  mental  health  problems  are  a  grow-
ing  issue,  and  many  children  and  adolescents  are  more 
vulnerable  due  to  HIV/AIDS,  war,  orphanhood,  and 
other challenges. Another limitation of this study is that 
no  correlation  could  be  made  between  the  prevalence 
of  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  problems  in  the 
community  and  the  proportion  receiving  treatment  by 
CAMHS  in  Uganda.    Furthermore,  whilst  there  are  key 
recommendations for further development of CAMHS in 
Uganda, the study could not determine a particular ser-
vice  model  that  clearly  outlines  the  required  manpower 
and  available  treatments  including  specific  biomedical 
treatments,  psychological  therapies  and  psychosocial 
interventions. Whilst the study findings may be general-
isable to other low and middle income countries, similar 
research in other comparable countries would be worth-
while before such conclusions could be reached.

Implications of the study

The findings of this study have implications for new ini-
tiatives  and  policies.  There  is  just  recently  developed 
a  standalone  mental  health  care  plan  or  policy  for  chil-
dren  and  adolescents  alone,  and  the  available  services 
are  scarce  and  centred  in  urban  areas.  Few  of  them  are

child-  and  adolescent-friendly,  and  vulnerable  groups 
such as orphans and HIV/AIDS-affected youth should be 
given  comprehensive  treatment.  There  is  also  a  need  to 
reduce stigma and spread awareness through public cam-
paigns and the integration of mental health into primary 
health  care.  Policymakers  need  to  develop  a  stronger 
mental  health  workforce  that  can  cater  to  the  needs  of 
children  and  adolescents,  especially  in  a  country  like 
Uganda with its history of war, trauma and HIV/AIDS.

Conclusion
As in other low and middle income countries, health sys-
tem  improvements  and  research  driven  changes  need 
to  be  made  in  order  to  enhance  CAMHS  in  Uganda. 
To  address the lack of both human resources  and facili-
ties,  collaboration  with  other  sectors  such  as  traditional 
healers  and  primary  health  care  is  necessary.  One  way 
to  do  this  is  to  train  health  professionals  with  the  help 
of  the  mhGAP-IG  and  using  both  in-service  and  pre-
service  training.  Furthermore,  mental  health  policies 
have already been developed, but they need to be modi-
fied to prioritize children and adolescents as well imple-
menting the recent standalone policy of 2017. Moreover, 
to  increase  help-seeking  behaviour,  interventions  need 
to  focus  on  awareness  and  attitudes  of  society  to  help 
reduce stigma. Other interventions that could be imple-
mented  are  community-based  therapy  and  economic 
empowerment,  targeting  children  and  adolescents  in 
low-resource  settings  and  offering  an  alternative  to  for-
mal  CAMHS  facilities.  The  main  goal  for  CAMHS  in 
Uganda  is  therefore  to  build  on  existing  resources  and 
facilities,  increasing  access,  building  a  skilled  workforce 
and  extending  collaboration,  while  reducing  stigma  and 
barriers to help-seeking.
