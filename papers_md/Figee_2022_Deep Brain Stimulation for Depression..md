Abstract
Deep brain stimulation has been extensively studied as a therapeutic option for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). DBS 
across different targets is associated with on average 60% response rates in previously refractory chronically depressed 
patients. However, response rates vary greatly between patients and between studies and often require extensive trial-and-error 
optimizations of stimulation parameters. Emerging evidence from tractography imaging suggests that targeting combina-
tions of white matter tracts, rather than specific grey matter regions, is necessary for meaningful antidepressant response to 
DBS. In this article, we review efficacy of various DBS targets for TRD, which networks are involved in their therapeutic 
effects, and how we can use this information to improve targeting and programing of DBS for individual patients. We will 
also highlight how to integrate these DBS network findings into developing adaptive stimulation and optimal trial designs.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most severe 
and incapacitating psychiatric disorders related to significant 
occupational, social, and physical impairments. Depression 
is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more 
than 300 million people globally, with lifetime prevalence 
rates of 20.6% in the USA [1, 2]. While there are many treat-
ments currently available for MDD, it is estimated that 10 
to 30% of patients are refractory to standard interventions 
[3, 4]. Novel strategies for treatment refractory depression 
(TRD) have mostly focused on non-serotonergic drug targets 
and various focal brain stimulation techniques. In patients 
who have not responded to any of the available antidepres-
sant treatments including electroconvulsive therapy, deep 
brain stimulation (DBS) is currently offered only in the con-
text of experimental trials.

The initial exploration of DBS as a possible therapy for 
patients with TRD was founded on the success of DBS in

movement disorders and advanced understanding of the 
neural circuitry involved in depression. The symptom vari-
ability inherent in depressive disorder and putative circuit 
abnormalities underlying these symptoms are reflected by 
the variety of targets being considered for DBS in TRD. 
Selected targets are mainly related to circuits underlying the 
two primary diagnostic criteria for MDD: negative affect 
and anhedonia. Targets related to circuits underlying nega-
tive affect include the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) 
and the lateral habenula (LHb). Targets related to anhedo-
nia and reward pathways include the ventral capsule and 
ventral striatum (vALIC and VC/VS), the medial forebrain 
bundle (MFB), and the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP). 
This review aims to summarize the current efficacy of these 
DBS targets in TRD with a special focus on their underlying 
therapeutic networks.

Methods

An  electronic  search  through  June  2022  was  completed 
using the following keywords and associated MeSH terms: 
“deep brain stimulation,” “DBS,” “depression,” “treatment 
resistant depression,” and “TRD.” Studies included clini-
cally applied chronic deep brain stimulation in patients with 
TRD. Due to the limited literature available, case reports, 
open-label  studies,  and  randomized  clinical  trials  were 
included in this review.

For illustration of the anatomical target locations and 
network connections, we generated figures depicting the 
activated  target  region  and  white  matter  tracts  on  MRI 
brain slices. White matter activation profile and DBS tar-
get was displayed in ICBM 2009b Nlin asymmetric space 
(0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5  mm3 resolution). Based on the previously 
reported anatomical location, a 2.5 mm radius ball was gen-
erated in the DBS target location [5–9]. Normative group 
connectome diffusion tractography data from Lead DBS 
software (www. lead- dbs. org) was then used to generate con-
nectivity profiles from each target [10–12].

Results

After the initial search was screened for non-relevant and dupli-
cate papers, 38 studies including a total of 405 patients were 
reviewed. The most common target was the SCC (N = 216), 
followed by the vALIC or VC/VS (N = 85), the MFB (N = 54), 
the LHb (N = 11), and the ITP (N = 1). In cases when multiple 
studies are reported using the same cohort, totals are calculated 
using the study with the largest cohort and longest follow-up. 
A summary of data collected is presented in Table 1. Forover-
view of all reviewed DBS targets see Fig. 1.

The  primary  outcome  measure  in  all  but  one  [13] 
reviewed study was one of the following: HDRS-17, HDRS-
24, HDRS-28, and MADRS [14, 15]. Studies using HDRS 
defined responders as patients achieving a ≥ 50% HDRS 
score reduction as compared to baseline and remitters were 
defined as patients achieving an HDRS score < 8. Studies 
using MADRS defined responders as patients achieving 
a ≥ 40% MADRS score reduction as compared to baseline 
and remitters as patients achieving a MADRS score ≤ 10 
(exceptions to this noted in Table 1).

Adverse effects of DBS are categorized as definitely, pos-
sibly or not related to stimulation or implantation. These 
adverse events are further grouped into surgery-, device-, or 
stimulation-related. A detailed overview of adverse effects 
will be presented per target, while a summary of adverse 
events is presented in Table 2.

Subcallosal Cingulate Cortex

Target Rationale

The subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) was the first target studied 
in the application of DBS for TRD. This region was considered 
a critical node within a putative mood regulatory circuit, based 
on a large body of functional imaging literature. The SCC has 
been linked to the regulation of negative mood states. Activity in 
this region increases with the provocation of sad mood [16] and 
decreases in response to antidepressant interventions [16–20]. 
The SCC is highly interconnected with regions involved in the 

processing of emotions and motivation, with reciprocal path-
ways to the medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, nucleus 
accumbens, anterior thalamus, and other subcortical regions 
[6]. The SCC is also functionally connected to antidepressant 
targets  for  non-invasive  neuromodulation  [21].  Ultimately, 
this target was selected with the goal of interrupting the net- 
work underlying negative mood prevalent in depression [22] 
(Fig.2).

Studies

The first open-label trial of DBS for TRD conducted by 
Mayberg et al. demonstrated its safety and efficacy, with a 
response rate (RS) at 6 months of 66% and remission (RM) 
rate of 33% [5]. This original cohort (N = 6) was expanded 
by Lozano and colleagues (N = 20) who showed similar 
efficacy at 1 year (RS = 55%, RM = 35%) [23], with further 
improvements at 3-year follow-up (RS = 60%, RM = 40%) 
[24]. These initial results have been replicated in many addi-
tional open-label trials with comparable response and remis-
sion rates [22, 25].

In  the  first  randomized,  single-blind  study  of  SCC 
DBS for TRD, Holtzheimer et al. report return of clinical 
symptoms—including increase in depressive symptoms 
and suicidal ideations—within approximately 2 weeks 
after blinded discontinuation of stimulation [26]. Thus, 
blinded discontinuation was halted after the first three 
patients.  Results  from  the  open-label  phase  support 
results from previous studies, demonstrating significant 
response and remission rates at 2 years (RS: 100%, RM: 
92%). In order to further investigate the relapse observed 
after stimulation discontinuation, Puidgemont et al. stud-
ied patients classified as responders to SCC DBS in their 
previous study [25]. Patients identified as responders at 
6 months entered a 6-month double-blinded cross-over 
period.  Results  show  that  3  out  of  5  patients  relapsed 
during cessation of treatment, further indicating a direct 
therapeutic effect of active SCC DBS [27].

The largest DBS for TRD study to date, the Abbott (for-
merly St. Jude Medical) sponsored BROADEN trial, con-
sisted of a 6-month double-blinded sham-controlled trial 
with 230 patients planned but with 90 patients implanted 
and reported [28]. Open-label stimulation continued fol-
lowing the primary endpoint. Results at the 6-month pri-
mary endpoint showed no significant difference between 
active and sham groups with a low response rate in both 
groups (20% vs 17%). However, continued observation of 
the patients showed significant response and remission rates 
from 12 months (RS: 29%, RM: 14%) to 24 months (RS: 
49%, RM: 26%). Nevertheless, the study was halted by the 
sponsor at the halfway mark (90/230 planned patients) due 
to low probability to meet the pre-study established pri-
mary endpoint. A regression analysis demonstrated that the

improvement between 12 and 24 months relative to the first 
12 months was attributable to stimulation changes—changes 
in active contacts and current—which were not permissible 
under study protocol in the first 12 months. Plausible, but 
unproven explanations for the delayed but eventually sus-
tained response rates have invoked illness chronicity. Nota-
bly, the average length of the current depressive episode for 
these patients was 12 years, almost double the average of 

previous published studies, raising the testable hypothesis 
that the time course of clinically significant antidepres-
sant effects requires consideration of the chronicity of the 
presenting illness. More supported by available data [28], 
the precision and consistency of DBS targeting has also 
been postulated. While there was no significant difference 
in gross anatomic location of electrode placement among 
patients, the angle of the lead trajectories was not controlled

tractography, they revealed that clinical response to SCC 
DBS was mediated by a direct impact on a combination of 
four fiber bundles passing through the SCC region. Respond-
ers shared a common map of stimulated fibers including 
bilateral forceps minor, bilateral cingulum bundles, dorsal 
and anterior midcingulate cortices, and medial branch of 
uncinated fasciculus. Given these retrospective results, Riva-
Posse et al. sought to test the utility of using an individu-
alized tractography map based on the group ‘connectome 
blueprint’ of past responders to prospectively identify the 
SCC DBS surgical target in a new cohort (N = 11) [29]. In 
this open-label study, contacts for chronic stimulation were 
selected by matching a preoperative deterministic tractogra-
phy map to a post-operative probabilistic tractography map 
for each subject. When all patients had bilateral contacts 
activated that matched the four-bundle blueprint a signifi-
cant and large response and remission rates was observed 
at 6 months (RS: 72.7%, RM: 54.5%) and 12 months (RS: 
81.9%, RM: 54.5%). These results support the utility of a 
group probabilistic tractography blueprint for individual-
ized, patient-specific, deterministic tractography targeting 
with the potential to greatly improve outcomes. A subse-
quent retrospective analysis of an independent cohort of 19 
TRD patients at 6- and 12-month SCC DBS [30] used a 
similar but not identical, approach. In this group of patients 
with  a  lower  response  rate  than  the  original  study  (RS: 
47.4% vs 81.9%), only activation of one of the four bun-
dles, the cingulum, correlated with response at 6 months, 
while activation of the forceps minor negatively correlated 
to response. Another retrospective study of 17 TRD patients 
(RS: 58.9%, RM: 35.5%) found activation of the forceps

across surgeons which could mean different passing and/or 
connected white matter fibers were impacted by ongoing 
stimulation. Recent studies suggest maximal clinical effi-
cacy of SCC DBS is directly correlated with the specific 
white matter tracts affected rather than anatomic location 
of stimulation as defined by traditional gray-white matter 
landmarks [6].

To define the combination and location of specific white 
matter  tracts  mediating  the  optimal  clinical  response  in 
SCC DBS for TRD, Riva Posse and colleagues performed a 
retrospective analysis on their previously implanted cohort 
[26]. Using individual activation volumes and probabilistic

minor and uncinate fascicle but not cingulate bundle and 
no association between activated bundles and response but 
this study did not apply tractography-based targeting [31].

While  in  general,  studies  of  SCC  DBS  for  TRD  use 
fixed frequency (130 Hz) and pulse-width (90 μs), three 
studies were specifically designed to test effects of differ-
ent stimulation parameters [32–34]. The first study [33] 
tested different frequencies of stimulation (0–185 Hz) and 
different pulse widths (0–450 μs) in 4 patients. No effect 
of frequency was found but stimulation using longer pulse 
widths (270–450 μs) reduced depression and maximized 
happy mood, though side effects of anxiety and insomnia 
were also associated with longer pulse widths. The second 
study [32] evaluated differences between high (130 Hz) ver-
sus low (20 Hz) frequency in a double-blind, randomized 
13-month crossover study. While no significant difference 
between groups was observed at 6 months, depression scores 
improved more in the high than low frequency group at 
12 months. The third study [34] found no difference in ben-
efit between short pulse width (90 μs) and long pulse width 
(210–450 μs) SCC DBS. Unfortunately, none of these stud-
ies modelled the white matter fibers differentially impacted 
by varying parameter settings.

There are indications that the pathophysiology of depres-
sion is asymmetric across hemispheres and left-sided repeti-
tive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be more 
effective  for  depression  than  bilateral  rTMS  [35].  Two 
studies report on the effect of unilateral versus bilateral 
SCC DBS [36, 37]. In one study with 5 patients, 3 of these 
patients had antidepressant effects with only left unilateral 
DBS while right unilateral DBS was not effective [36]. The 
other 2 patients had some benefits with either left or right 
stimulation. Though this study may suggest stronger anti-
depressant effects of left SCC DBS, another study in one 
patient reports remission of depression with right-sided 
stimulation but not with left or bilateral stimulation [37]. 
A DTI-analysis in this patient showed that only the effec-
tive, right-sided target had connections to both right and left 
medial OFC suggesting that effective stimulation may still 
require bilateral circuit engagement.

Adverse Events

A total of 481 adverse events were reported in studies tar-
geting the SCC. The most common SAE associated with 
surgery were transient infection, seizure, and postopera-
tive pain. The most common device-related adverse events 
included pain or discomfort around the internal pulse gen-
erator (IPG) or extension cables, extension/electrode break, 
or dislodgement. Stimulation-related adverse events reported 
most commonly were increased depression or anxiety or 
sleep disturbances. Stimulation-related SAE were mostly 
transient or could be resolved by parameter adjustment. 

Following SCC DBS there have been 12 suicide attempts, 
and 6 suicides. (Table 2).

Lateral Habenula

Target Rationale

The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic structure 
mediating  communication  between  the  forebrain  and  
monoaminergic systems in the midbrain and hindbrain  
[38, 39]. The LHb is implicated in negative mood states 
in  both  animal  and  human  research.  Animal  studies 
examining a learned-helplessness model of depression 
have demonstrated that this was associated with marked 
LHb hypermetabolism [40, 41]. In humans, depletion of 
tryptophan (a serotonin precursor) results in depressive 
mood symptoms and increased blood flow to the LHb, sup-
porting the region’s role in the monoamine hypothesis of 
depression [42]. Furthermore, LHb volume reductions are 
observed selectively in patients with MDD and not in other 
psychopathology [43]. Insights from functional studies in 
animal depression models show the LHb receiving inputs 
from structures including the globus pallidus (GPi), lateral 
hypothalamic area (LHA), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) 
lateral preoptic area (LPO), ventral pallidum (VP), lateral 
septum (LS), NAc, and diagonal band nuclei (DBN) [44].

Studies

A case study targeting the LHb [45] reports remission of 
depression in a TRD patient after 12 months of stimula-
tion and at last follow-up. A second report of an addi-
tional patient, reports response at an unspecified time [46]. 
Placebo effects in both patients are excluded by severe 
relapses with accidental and planned stimulation discon-
tinuation. Relapses after discontinuation in both patients 
were rapid in onset (1 week) and subsequent remission 
was gradual (2–3 months) after stimulation was restored. 
Recently, LHb DBS was investigated in 6 patients with 
bipolar depression and 1 patient with unipolar depression 
[47]. Three patients were responders and 1 patient remitted 
(RS: 42.9%, RM: 14.3%). The clear and well-characterized 
subcortical LHb connections from optogenetic and func-
tional imaging studies [39] are of limited use for precision  
targeting of selective LHb white matter connections in 
human DBS trials which is technically confounded by the 
small size of this nucleus relative to the large volume of 
tissue activated by conventional DBS. Therefore, Fig. 3 
depicting the LHb-target location does not include acti-
vated tracts.

Adverse Effects

Transient adverse effects after LHb DBS such as double or 
blurred vision or dizziness could be reversed by lowering 
or changing stimulation parameters. During LHb DBS in 
patients with bipolar depression, one patient experienced a 
manic episode, one patient developed impulsive behaviors, 
and one patient suicide ideation. To date, this target has 
not been examined in a larger sample size.

Ventral Capsule/Ventral Striatum

Different names are used for this target region, i.e., nucleus 
accumbens (NAc), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), 
or ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule (vALIC). 
However, they all share a trajectory through the anterior 
limb of the internal capsule with the deepest one or two 
contact points in or bordering the NAc and the remaining 
contact points in the vALIC, although the exact location in 
the capsule slightly differs between these targets.

Target Rationale

Ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) DBS was first 
developed for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), given 
positive capsulotomy outcomes for these patients [48]. DBS 
for OCD showed significant benefit for OCD symptoms with 
an associated improvement in mood [49–51]. In addition, 
VC/VS DBS in OCD patients modulates a circuit connect-
ing the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex (vmPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) with 
striatum, thalamus, and brainstem [52–54]. This circuitry 
significantly overlaps with the reward-circuitry assumed to 
be related to the anhedonia symptoms of MDD. The VC/VS 
is a central hub in the reward circuitry with dopaminergic 
inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and serving as  
a relay between prefrontal cortex (OFC, vmPFC, ACC), ven- 
tral striatum and the amygdala and hippocampus [55, 56] 
(Fig. 4).

Studies

1235

In an open-label trial designed to compare two striatal 
targets, Millet et al. implanted 4 patients with a single lead 
that allowed for electrodes to be positioned in the NAc and 
caudate nucleus [60]. No patient responded after the first 
4 months of NAc stimulation or after the second 4 months 
of caudate stimulation. However, after the final 6 months of 
NAc stimulation during which stimulation parameters (volt-
age and contact) were adjusted, response and remission rates 
of 75% and 25% were observed, respectively. Although these 
results suggest a more robust response to the NAc than to 
the caudate, stimulation parameters were not adjusted for 
the caudate in the manner they were for the NAc, calling for 
further investigation into this comparison.

Promising open-label findings led to the first randomized 
double-blind sham-controlled trial of VC/VS DBS for TRD 
[61]. The Medtronic sponsored RECLAIM trial consisted 
of a 4-month double-blind on/off block (primary endpoint), 
followed by an open-label block. Results from the primary 
endpoint did not demonstrate a significant difference between 
active and sham groups, resulting in an early termination of 
the study for futility (N = 30/200). Open-label response and 
remission rates were lower than previous open-label studies 
at 1 year (RS: 20%, RM: 13%) and 2 years (RS: 23.3%, RM: 
20%). The lack of significant differences between active and 
control groups may be attributed to insufficient duration of 
the optimization phase, and an experimental window that was 
too short. Results from a simultaneous randomized controlled 
study of vALIC DBS for TRD by Bergfeld et al. appear to 
confirm the need for a longer optimization phase [9]. Follow-
ing a 52-week open-label optimization phase, patients entered 
a 12-week double-blind crossover phase to test for placebo 
effects. During the crossover phase, response rate was 0% dur-
ing sham-stimulation and 43.8% during active DBS. Of note, 
most patients had to be prematurely crossed over due to sig-
nificantly increased depressive symptoms typically occurring 
within one day of crossover, raising ethical concerns around 
discontinuation-trials in DBS for TRD. Continued efficacy 
2 years after surgery was reported in the responders [62]. 
The necessary and sufficient white matter bundles within the 
vALIC to achieve predictable good outcomes have yet to be 
defined.

Adverse Effects

The first open-label trials for VC/VS stimulation in depres-
sion were reported simultaneously across two investigative 
groups using different patient cohorts. In a multi-center 
study, Malone and colleagues demonstrated antidepressant 
effects in 15 patients at a minimum of 6-month follow-up 
(RS: 53.3%, RM: 40%) [57]. The second, single-site study 
demonstrated comparable benefits in 10 patients at 1-year 
(RS: 50%, RM: 30%) and at 2-year follow-ups (RS: 45.5%, 
RM: 9.1%) [58, 59].

A total of 330 adverse events were reported in patients receiv-
ing VC/VS DBS. The most frequent surgery-related adverse 
events were swollen eye, pain at incision site, and dysphagia. 
Device-related AE included pain or discomfort around the IPG 
and extension/lead breakage or dislodgement. The most com-
mon reversible, stimulation-related AE include increased or 
worsening depression and hypomania. Following VC/VS DBS 
there have been 11 suicide attempts and 3 suicides (Table 2).

the VC/VS [65]. Notably, the VC/VS target is thought to 
modulate the MFB in addition to the anterior thalamic 
radiation (ATR) and other pathways discussed previously. 
The MFB was selected as a target with the hypothesis 
that DBS in closer proximity to the VTA, as compared 
to other reward-circuit targets, would produce significant 
anti-anhedonia effects [8] (Fig. 5).

Studies

The  first  open-label  study  targeting  the  MFB  in  8  TRD 
patients showed high response rates from 6 weeks (RS: 
85.7%),  to  1  year  (RS:  75%,  RM:  50%)  [8,  66].  These 
patients, in addition to another cohort (N = 21), were fol-
lowed for a maximum of 5 years and showed significant 
response  and  remission  rates  at  6  months  (N = 21,  RS: 
42.8%,  RM:  38.1%),  2  years  (N = 17,  RS:  64.7%,  RM: 
47.1%), and 5 years (N = 11, RS: 72.27%, RM: 72.7%) [67]. 
Furthermore, personality dimensions were not found to dif-
fer significantly from baseline at any time point after the 
onset of DBS.

MFB stimulation has been examined in three case-studies. 
In the first, Sani et al. [13], demonstrated a general pattern 
of treatment response in a patient with MFB DBS measured 
with a computerized adaptive test (CAT-DI). In the second 
case-study, MFB stimulation was terminated in a patient fol-
lowing sustained blurred vision that could not be attenuated 
with changes in stimulation parameters. The patient was then 
re-implanted at the VC/VS and maintained remission over 
the period of 1 year [68]. In a third case study, two patients 
with dMRI-guided DBS of the MFB did not reach responder 
status at any point over the study period of 6 months [69].

Fenoy et al. performed a 1-month single blind study, fol-
lowed by an open label study (N = 6) [70, 71]. Results do not 
indicate any significant difference between blinded on/off 
conditions but in the open-label phase promising response 
and remission rates were observed at 1 week of MFB DBS 
(RS: 50%) and at 1 year (RS: 66%, RM: 50%).

In  a  12-month  randomized  clinical  trial,  16  patients 
entered a 2-month double blind control immediately follow-
ing implantation, followed by 12 months of active stimula-
tion [72]. Results do not demonstrate a significant differ-
ence between sham and stimulation groups during the first 
2 months but show significant response and remission rates 
at 1 year (RS: 100%, RM: 50%). Acute antidepressant effects 
following surgery regardless of stimulation condition could 
be attributed to either microlesioning effects or to placebo. 
Again, there has been no delineation so far of the crucial 
white matter MFB branches and their respective cortical and 
subcortical targets necessary to achieve early and sustained 
antidepressant effects and avoid side effects.

Medial Forebrain Bundle

Target Rationale

The  medial  forebrain  bundle  (MFB)  was  selected  as  a 
DBS-target  for  TRD  based  on  its  key  function  within 
the reward circuit [63,  64]. The superolateral branch of 
the MFB connects the VTA to the OFC and vmPFC via

Adverse Effects

Inferior Thalamic Peduncle

In patients receiving MFB DBS, 434 adverse events were 
reported. Common surgery-related adverse events include 
hemorrhage and infection. The only reported device-related 
adverse event is contact malfunction in one patient. Fre-
quent stimulation-related adverse events include vision/eye 
movement disorder and blurred vision—accounting for the 
majority of listed AEs. There has been one attempted and no 
completed suicides reported following MFB DBS.

The inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP) connects the dorso-
medial thalamus with the orbitofrontal cortex, which both 
show hypermetabolism in depressed patients [73]. ITP fibers 
continue rostrally through the ventral limb of the internal 
capsule, with modulatory connections to the DLPFC, OFC, 
ventromedial striatum, and intralaminar thalamus [74]. The 
first case study of ITP-DBS for TRD demonstrated remission 
at 12 months and last follow-up [75]. In a study comparing

VC/VS stimulation to ITP stimulation in 7 TRD patients, 
Raymaekers et al. [76] fail to demonstrate significant differ-
ence between targets. After at least 5 months VC/VS stimu-
lation 6 out of 7 patients were responders, and 5 were in 
remission (RS: 85%, RM: 71%). After at least 3-month ITP 
stimulation, 4 out of 7 patients were responders, and 1 was 
in remission (RS: 57%, RM: 14%). Only 1 out of 7 patients 
preferred ITP stimulation over VCVS stimulation.

Adverse Effects

In the 8 patients receiving ITP stimulation, 47 adverse events 
and  no  suicide  attempts  or  suicides  have  been  reported 
(Table 2) (Fig. 6).

Multiple Targets

Serial and combined targeting of multiple stimulation 
sites has been piloted in several studies.

The VC/VS has been compared to the MFB, ITP, and 
SCC. In a case study, Blomstedt et al. first targeted the 
MFB [68]. Although depressive symptoms improved fol-
lowing stimulation, blurred vision could not be attenuated 
with changes in stimulation parameters and ultimately led 
to the selection of a new target. Re-implantation at the 
VC/VS led to remission which has been sustained over a 
1-year period.

Raymaekers et al. [76] implanted two sets of bilateral 
electrodes in seven patients. Each patient was implanted 
with bilateral electrodes at the VC/VS target and at the 

ITP target. Following implantation and recovery, stimula-
tion parameters were optimized for the VC/VS target for 
5 months. Responders at 5 months entered a 2-week VC/
VS on/off crossover. Following this, patients entered an 
ITP optimization period, followed by a second 6-month 
crossover phase in which patients received either VC/
VS  stimulation,  ITP  stimulation  or  no  stimulation  for 
2 months each. Results do not demonstrate any signifi-
cant difference between targets. However, at last follow 
up, six out of seven patients preferred VC/VS stimula-
tion over ITP stimulation with 66.7% of these respond-
ing to simulation. A case study of combined VC/VS and 
SCC DBS reports remission until 75 weeks follow-up of 
combined stimulation and differential response-profiles. 
SCC stimulation reduced “mental noise” and produced 
calmness and attention and VC/VS stimulation produced 
energy and motivation [77].

Discussion

Available evidence suggests that DBS for TRD is an effec-
tive, safe, and well-tolerated experimental therapeutic option 
for TRD. Open-label studies of DBS at various targets show 
comparable response rates of on average 50% in severely 
treatment resistant patients provided there has been adequate 
time for initial parameter adjustments. Reported response 
rates in the first year of SCC DBS in over 200 patients range 
between 20 and 82%, for VC/VS in 85 patients 23–75%,  
and for MFB DBS in 53 patients 0–100%. High response 
rates are reported in studies applying patient-specific target- 

1 3Deep Brain Stimulation for Depression

ing of white matter maps that were determined in previous 
responders. Though substantial relapses after many years of 
sustained wellness are usually observed during unintended 
discontinuation, results from placebo-controlled studies have 
been mixed. These highly variable open-label and placebo-
controlled response rates require resolution through the work 
of future studies for the field to progress. Here, we present 
the common limitations and possible future directions that 
we hope will allow for this resolution.

Ruling Out Placebo Response

Though  placebo  rates  are  high  in  medication  trials  for 
depression [78], these rates are minimal in the most severely 
depressed patients that also are eligible for DBS trials [79]. 
Notably, in the largest double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 
Broaden, the placebo rate after 6 months was only 17%. 
Nevertheless, sham surgeries often show significant placebo 
effects [80] which might have contributed to comparable 
antidepressant effects of real and sham DBS shortly after 
surgery. However, no antidepressant placebo response was 
found during randomized (dis)continuation after an initial 
1-year period of active DBS with adequate parameter opti-
mization [81]. Naturalistic placebo discontinuation studies 
offer additional compelling evidence of the actual antide-
pressant effects of DBS in various target sites. Notable are 
relapses after accidental stimulation discontinuation due 
to unrecognized device malfunctions (lead fracture, IPG 
dysfunction, or battery depletion), even in the presence of 
sustained response and remission rates over many years of 
ongoing active DBS, which make it seem unlikely that the 
long-term antidepressant effects of DBS can be attributed to 
chronic placebo effects.

When designing a blinded discontinuation trial is also 
important to consider that the effects of stimulation discon-
tinuation may differ depending on the antidepressant target. 
For example, depressive symptoms remained in remission 
3 months after SCC DBS discontinuation in 2/5 patients [27] 
and carryover antidepressant effects of at least 1 week have 
been observed after transient intraoperative stimulation of 
the SCC [81] or MFB [71], but symptom relapse within a 
day was observed after discontinuation of VC/VS DBS [9].
Our review suggests that differences between active and 
sham  groups  might  not  be  observable  until  stimulation 
parameter optimization has been achieved, and that can take 
up to 1 year after surgery in some targets [9]. Discontinua-
tion of stimulation is nonetheless generally associated with 
measurable relapse, raising ethical concerns and the poten-
tial for patients’ non-compliance at this critical stage of a 
clinical trial. When planning a controlled trial, it is therefore 
important to carefully consider potential contingencies and 
alternatives, most notably close follow-up and a robust and 
timely stop and rescue protocol.

Choosing the Outcome for DBS

The HRDS and MADRS are widely used to characterize 
antidepressant  effects  of  different  treatment  modalities. 
However, these scales were designed to globally survey 
all symptoms of depression while DBS is by definition a 
circuit-selective intervention likely acting on circuit-specific 
symptom profiles. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is more 
accepted that DBS selectively improves tremor and rigid-
ity items of the motor Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating 
Scale (MDS-UPDRS) rather than freezing, gait, or apathy. 
However, to date, there is no evidence in DBS for TRD that 
depression symptom dimensions as measured by the HRDS 
or  MADRS  change  selectively  or  at  different  rates,  and 
alternative measures are under study for example scales for 
symptom subdimensions or analysis of movements, speech, 
or facial expression [82–84].

In  addition,  the  HRDS  and  MADRS  are  designed  to 
assess severity of depressive symptoms but cannot be used 
for tracking symptoms once someone is out of episode when 
it is important to discriminate depression relapse from tran-
sient mood instability. For example, in a case study, the 
effect of MFB DBS measured with the HDRS was masked 
by the variability in mood and more marked periods of ben-
efit and decline measured with a computerized adaptive test 
(CAT-DI) that allowed the questions to adapt to the patient’s 
depressive severity and could be administered multiple times 
throughout the follow-up period [13]. Since TRD is char-
acterized by a lack of mood variability, successful treat-
ment should restore this variability in patients. Therefore, 
outcome measures might seek to measure this increase in 
mood variability. Attempts to monitor moment to moment 
emotionality in response to DBS are ongoing, including the 
monitoring of brain signals underlying the slow sustained 
depression illness change versus fast emotional transients 
which may be important but different signals [83, 85].

Safety and Adverse Events

The  reviewed  surgical  risks  of  DBS  for  TRD  are  mini-
mal and do not differ significantly from risks of DBS for 
movement disorders. However, psychiatric adverse events 
associated with stimulation are not yet fully delineated and 
appear variable across targets. Insights from limited placebo-
controlled studies demonstrate a need for consideration of 
safety in the case of accidental device shutdown. It appears 
that symptoms return in the order of weeks when SCC DBS 
is turned off [26], whereas symptoms return on the order of 
days when VC/VS DBS is turned off [9]. As such, specific 
plans should be put into place to care for the patient in the 
case of accidental device malfunction. Innovation result-
ing in extended battery life will prove to limit these safety 
concerns.

1 31240

Given the population studied, suicide and suicide attempts 
are to be expected and should be accounted for in develop-
ing safety procedures for future studies. Generally, 30% of 
patients with TRD attempt suicide at least once in their lives 
[86]. The DBS studies reviewed here demonstrate a suicide 
attempt rate of 6.7%, suggesting that DBS for TRD does not 
increase suicide risk.

Optimizing Target Selection

Historically, most targets discussed here have been identi-
fied pre-surgically in standard stereotactic anatomical space 
based on atlases [11, 87]. Atlas-based target selection does 
not consider the patient-specific variability of white mat-
ter fibers in relation to the predefined standard DBS tar-
get. Notable exceptions include prospective targeting of a 
predefined responder map of specific white matter fibers 
connected to the SCC [29], and the individual tractography 
identification of the medial forebrain bundle [72] (not visible 
in standard atlases). For SCC DBS, consistent tractography-
based targeting of a site in the SCC region structurally con-
nected to the forceps minor, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum 
bundle, and frontostriatal fibers was associated with an 88% 
response rate [88] and bilateral stimulation of all four white 
matter tracts appears required to achieve a full response [6]. 
In one study of SCC DBS only activation of the cingulum 
correlated with response though only half of this trial’s par-
ticipants were responders and it is unclear to what extent the 
forceps minor, uncinate fasciculus or subcortical fibers were 
fully included in the surgical target [30]. Quantitative fiber 
activation models will help further delineate which stimula-
tion pathways are necessary and sufficient to achieve good 
clinical outcomes in individual patients. MFB DBS trials 
have used individual tractography-targeting since their first 
reports. In this target, tractography is necessary for implanta-
tion, and there is no “responder” template. That said, MFB 
case  series  and  trials  have  reported  high  response  rates 
overall. Non-response, however, was reported in a recent 
case study of two patients despite following the same trac-
tography-based targeting method [69]. For VC/VS DBS, a 
complex combination of internal capsule fibers to the vent-
rolateral and medial prefrontal cortex is consistently associ-
ated to response in DBS for OCD [89], though no data are 
available yet using tractography-based targeting to define the 
necessary nor sufficient tracts for depression. One retrospec-
tive group analysis supports improved outcomes with lead 
placements closer to white matter internal capsule bundles 
between the prefrontal cortex, thalamus and brainstem [90] 
but without further specificity.

While tractography-based surgical planning across dif-
ferent DBS targets appears to improve outcomes, it has not  
directly informed understanding of DBS mechanisms. Trac- 
tography has several limitations, including inability to con- 

vey information about the direction of current flow through a 
given bundle, inability to disambiguate cell-specific connec-
tions, inability to identify network nodes beyond first-level 
monosynaptic connections and lack of a uniform methodol-
ogy to identify the tracts. Finally, implementing tractography 
based surgical targeting into routine clinical practice may 
be challenging since it requires high-quality patient-specific 
diffusion-weighted scans rather than normative connectomic 
data [72].

Targeting Symptom‑Specific Connections

All therapeutic DBS targets reviewed here have compara-
ble effectiveness for treating depression though there are 
no head-to-head studies to date. A reason behind this com-
parable effectiveness across targets may be their partially 
overlapping connections. DBS targets in the VC/VS region 
structurally and functionally connect to the MFB and par-
tially to the SCC [91], but the SCC has selective fibers that 
are not directly connected to VC/VS or NAc [92, 93]. It is 
important to note that NAc or VC/VS stimulation does not 
affect the SCC monosynaptically as NAc connections go 
to the thalamus first and then back to frontal cortex via the 
ALIC. Thus, VC/VS stimulation may be very different from 
SCC stimulation that involves monosynaptic white mat-
ter fibers to part of the NAc and thalamus that do not pass 
through the ALIC [93]. Nevertheless, SCC DBS modulates 
activity in the NAc and, conversely, NAc DBS modulates the 
SCC, while other regions that are influenced via both targets 
include the brainstem, hypothalamus, amygdala, and OFC 
[94–96]. VC/VS DBS may thus exert “bottom-up” regula-
tion of a similar limbic-motivational circuit that SCC DBS 
regulates in an opposite “top-down” fashion. These opposite 
modulatory entrances into the same circuit appear to result 
in different but related antidepressant outcomes [97]. For 
instance, the first manifestation of effective SCC DBS is usu-
ally a relief of negative affect and changes in physical aware-
ness [98], in accordance with the primary mood regulatory 
function of the SCC and its connections to structures related 
to interception such as the insula and cingulum. On the other 
hand, patients responding to DBS of the NAc, a region more 
associated with reward and positive affect, report acutely 
improved motivation for pleasurable activities [99]. DBS of 
the vALIC improved mood in patients with primary OCD 
and was associated with enhanced striatal reward-processing 
and dopamine release, which may be important mechanisms 
for the reversal of anhedonia and lack of positive mood in 
major depression [52, 65, 100, 101]. Tractography studies 
in healthy individuals have revealed that the MFB connects 
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with the OFC and medial 
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices via the VC/VS, together 
constituting a circuit involved in the processing of rewards, 
motivation, and emotions [65]. Therefore, it is likely that 

1 3Deep Brain Stimulation for Depression

1241

patients  within  a  specific  subgroup  of  symptoms  will 
respond preferentially to different targets. Similarly, comor-
bid psychiatric disorders may favor the choice of specific 
targets in depression, i.e., comorbid OCD or significant OC 
symptoms may favor a VC/VS target, and depressed patients 
with anorexia may respond to SCC stimulation [102].

Symptom characterization, with concomitant biomarker 
detection, may be helpful in the decision of target selection 
in the future but is only theoretical at this time. A single-case 
report has attempted this [83] and researchers are determin-
ing chronic stimulation location and parameters based on the 
immediately post-operative neurophysiological recordings. 
It remains to be seen if this biomarker-driven stimulation 
selection improves the current approach [77].

Optimizing Stimulation Parameters

Only few of the reviewed studies investigated the effect of 
different stimulation parameters. Low-frequency stimulation 
does not seem to be effective [32], and the sweet spot is in 
the high-frequency range (100–150 Hz) [103], which is also 
supported by animal studies [104, 105]. Nevertheless, future 
studies may want to investigate the effect of low-frequency 
stimulation on specific symptoms of depression in parallel to 
promising findings with this approach in PD [106]. Although 
longer pulse-widths were beneficial in some patients, this 
also  caused  more  side  effects  suggesting  a  less  specific 
stimulation delivery. Fine-tuning of stimulation parameters 
may be best approached in an individual patient once the 
optimal fibers have been identified and selected. However, 
this fine-tuning may require an immediate readout, and for 
now, there are not fast behavioral effects with DBS at these 
targets as there are for tremor in PD.

Closed‑Loop Stimulation

The  identification  of  electrophysiological  signatures  in 
patients receiving DBS has opened the possibility of using 
them to optimize stimulation parameters and with recent 
advances  inform  stimulation  changes  by  clinicians,  and 
eventually facilitate the design of closed-loop systems. This 
is already a possibility in epilepsy and is becoming feasible 
in movement disorders [107]. Closed-loop DBS systems are 
designed to trigger stimulation onset or parameter adjust-
ment  by  sensing  readouts  from  intracranial  recordings. 
Closed-loop  DBS  could  be  either  applied  automatically 
where the system both detects the biomarker and changes 
the stimulation, or a clinician can decide to adjust the stimu-
lation based on biomarker readouts from the leads (assisted 
open-loop).

In psychiatric disorders, there are several groups that are 
utilizing electrophysiology to detect mood signals to select 
stimulation target and parameters. This work has been facili-
tated by the National Institutes of Health BRAIN Initiative, 
seeking for academic and industry collaborations. For closed 
loop stimulation in psychiatric disorders to become a reality, 
reliable and accessible biomarkers of depression in TRD 
patients with DBS first have to be determined. Important 
as well is the determination of which biomarkers correlate 
with clinical symptoms in depression, a highly complex dis-
order that has different clinical manifestations across and 
within the same patient (i.e., suicidality, anhedonia, nega-
tive affect). In psychiatric DBS, there are early reports of 
changes that occur in brain activity when changes in mood 
occur. This has been described in intraoperative shifts in 
mood in direct response to effective stimulation [108]. In 
chronic stimulation (recording from contacts adjacent to the 
stimulating electrode), local field potential changes in 1/f 
slope, a putative correlate of neuronal excitability, recorded 
weekly at the right SCC-lead during the first 6 months of 
SCC-DBS  discriminated  depressed  from  non-depressed 
states in three out of the four patients [85].

Closed-loop DBS was recently piloted in a TRD patient 
[109]. During a 10-day period of intracranial corticolim-
bic circuitry mapping (recording from SCC, amygdala, VC/
VS, OFC, and HPC), amygdala gamma power correlated 
with  high  depressive  symptom  states  measured  several 
times daily. With this putative biomarker as target, bilat-
eral leads and a responsive neurostimulator (Neuropace) 
were implanted in the VC/VS where stimulation was trig-
gered by gamma power increases measured in another set 
of implanted amygdala leads. This strategy resulted in over 
400 daily depressive biomarker detections triggering 6-s 
stimulations, and acute and sustained remission of depres-
sive symptoms. This promising case report that will hope-
fully be replicated. While this case-study may suggest the 
feasibility of closed-loop VC/VS stimulation for TRD based 
on personalized biomarker-informed stimulation, it does not 
yet demonstrate effective superiority compared to classic 
VC/VS DBS or whether stimulation needs to be tailored to 
biomarkers of daily mood fluctuations or more prolonged 
depressive states.

A separate group has taken a different approach [110]. 
DBS-leads were implanted, with the assistance of tractog-
raphy, in both SCC and VC/VS, as well as 10 temporary 
stereoEEG depth electrodes across prefrontal and tempo-
ral regions. Immediately following the implantation sur-
gery, parameters from stimulation in both electrodes were 
explored and recordings from the externalized sEEG were 
gathered for several days in a hospital monitoring unit. Using

Additional Treatment

References

None of the reviewed studies systematically investigated 
antidepressant augmentation strategies for DBS. A case-
report suggests augmenting effects of SCC DBS with mono-
amine oxidase inhibitor but not with other antidepressants 
[111]. Most trials have kept medications stable during the 
DBS as withdrawing TRD patients from treatments prior to 
experimental DBS is an ethical and safety challenge. How-
ever, several patients that were withdrawn from unhelpful 
medication at the time of implant showed similar robust 
response to DBS [9], suggesting that medication may not be 
required to achieve or augment DBS response. Future stud-
ies might work to reduce medications pre-surgically or early 
during DBS optimization. This may be easier once there is 
a target physiological biomarker comparable to for example 
beta power in PD that can be used to titrate levodopa or 
stimulation. ECT was safely augmented to SCC DBS in one 
patient who relapsed after which the depression remained in 
remission with continued DBS [112]. Regardless of target 
selection, outcomes in all patients may be enhanced through 
the addition of rehabilitative and behavioral treatments. This 
patient population has an average disease duration lasting 
many years, with a variety of associated secondary prob-
lems.  Rehabilitation  and  behavioral  therapy  have  been 
shown to have an additive effect for patients receiving DBS 
for OCD [113].

Conclusion

DBS is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated therapeutic 
option for TRD. Progress in the field may depend on the 
development of novel outcome measurements capturing the 
sustained circuit-selective symptom changes observed after 
DBS, and standardization of randomized placebo-controlled 
study designs including initial open-label parameter opti-
mization. White matter activation maps in DBS responders 
across targets will help determining the optimal antidepres-
sant network that can be used for tractography-guided sur-
gery. This precision-stimulation strategy will likely result 
in faster and higher antidepressant responses that can be 
maintained or optimized by adjusting the stimulation over 
time in a closed-loop or assisted-open-loop fashion informed 
by biomarkers of depressive states.
