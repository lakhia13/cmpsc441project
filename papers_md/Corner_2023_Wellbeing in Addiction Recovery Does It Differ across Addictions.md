Abstract: Limited research has been conducted on the experiences of individuals in long-term
recovery from addiction, and addictions are usually studied in isolation. However, no theories
of addiction differentiate between addictions or assume that individuals will experience only one
addiction. This study aimed to compare affect between individuals with addictions to drugs and
alcohol and to explore how QoL changes in long-term recovery from addiction. Individuals in
recovery from addiction (n = 115; 52.2% male) were recruited via snowball sampling on social media
signposted by an addiction rehabilitation charity. Participants completed questionnaires about QoL
(WHOQOL-Bref) and positive and negative affect (PANAS-X). The main primary addictions were
drugs (76.5%) and alcohol (21.7%), with 69.7% reporting multiple addictions including food, sex,
internet, and gambling. Affect and coping strategies did not differ by addiction. QoL appeared to
improve with time in recovery. The high percentage of multiple addictions and greater similarities
than differences between individuals with drug and alcohol addictions suggest that addictions should
not be studied in isolation when studying psychological health during long-term recovery.

1. Introduction

Addiction to substances has been deﬁned by the DSM-5 [1] as a psychiatric disorder
leading to impaired control, physical dependence, social problems, and risky use. It is
associated with depression, anxiety, thrill seeking, risk taking, incentive desensitisation,
and reward deﬁciency [2], with recovery only occurring when the pain of continuing to use
is seen as greater than the perceived pain of changing [3].

Addiction is a signiﬁcant problem in the UK, affecting not only individuals but
also their families and others in society involved with them. Regarding drug use, over
3000 deaths were attributed to drug misuse in 2021 [4] and male mortality from drug addic-
tion has risen sharply since records began in 1993 [5]. Drug misuse issues are said to affect
an average of 1.9 people per 100,000, with some signiﬁcant variations such as Blackpool
with 14.0 per 100,000 [6]. The cost of drug misuse was GBP 15.4 billion in 2014 in the UK,
which included healthcare (8%), law enforcement (10%), deaths (28%), and crime (54%). It
is estimated that 1.5 million people in the UK are affected by someone else’s drug addiction
with the cost of harm to others estimated as GBP 1.8 billion per year. Regarding alcohol
use, there were 7327 alcohol-speciﬁc deaths in the UK in 2016, making a rate of 11.7 deaths
per 100,000 [6] which rose to 7565 in 2019 [7]. However, these numbers do not include any
categories of death partially attributable to alcohol. This is important as alcohol impacts
the innate and acquired immune system, making individuals with alcohol addiction more
susceptible to infections [8]. The cost of this to the National Health Service (NHS) is around
GBP 3.5 billion per annum, and there are estimated to be around 602,391 individuals who
are dependent on alcohol in the UK [9].

Of those with addictions, however, many will recover and continue to live fulﬁlling
lives. Many people live over ﬁve years in recovery (termed long-term or stable recovery).

For example, 50% of the 110,095 people who left the alcohol and drug treatment system in
the UK in 2020 had successfully completed treatment [10].

However, research conducted on individuals in recovery from addictions has mainly
focused on participants who are on detoxiﬁcation programmes, in rehabilitation pro-
grammes, or in aftercare. Limited research has been conducted on people who are no
longer accessing these services but are in stable recovery. A study of 53 individuals in
recovery from alcohol addictions found that those in “stable recovery”, deﬁned as ﬁve
years or more in recovery, reported better social relationships, psychological health, and
environment than those in early recovery [11]. Further, individuals in stable recovery re-
ported better social relationships and environment than population norms, supporting the
idea of recovery as an ongoing gradual process with quality of life continuing to improve
as abstinence duration increases. Similarly, in a nationally representative sample of US
adults [12], although wellbeing increased and distress decreased most rapidly in the ﬁrst
ﬁve years following recovery, wellbeing continued to improve—albeit at a slower pace—for
the remainder of the 40 years after entering recovery.

There are a range of theories around addiction, all of which differ widely regarding
predisposition to and development of addictions. For example, biological theories see
addiction as a disease of the brain. They hold that the increase in neurotransmitters caused
by the intake of drugs/alcohol impairs sensitivity to natural rewards [13]; that motivation,
memory, and executive function inﬂuenced by incorrect neurotransmitter regulation can
reinforce learned associations, enhance the motivational value of the substance, and reduce
inhibitory control [14]; and that prolonged addictive activity can cause changes in the
structure and function of relevant brain regions, reinforcing addiction [15]. Predisposition
theories hold that individuals may have speciﬁc vulnerabilities, whether genetic (e.g., low
numbers of neurotransmitters), personality traits, stressful life experiences, or sociode-
mographic factors, that make them vulnerable to developing addiction [16]. Learning
theories, such as classical and operant conditioning and social learning theory [17], hold
that addiction is a response learned through observing others. Decision-making theories see
addiction as arising from information-processing biases [18] or as a conscious choice made
through cost–beneﬁt analysis, e.g., [19,20]. Motivation theories hold that addiction may
serve motives of obtaining positive rewards [21] or avoiding discomfort [22]. Psychosocial
theories hold that addictions may occur to ﬁt in with social norms [23] or to develop a
social identity [24]. Self-regulation theories hold that addiction arises from deﬁciencies
in self-control [25]. Finally, theories around contextual factors hold that vulnerability to
addiction can be ampliﬁed by socio-environmental factors such as addictive behaviour
among family members and peers [26,27].

Despite their differences, the theories mentioned above are concordant in not assuming
that individuals will experience only one addiction [16]. Similarly, research into levels of
concordant behavioural and substance addictions has identiﬁed high levels of comorbidity
amongst drug users. For example, in a study of 51 participants aged 21 years or over who
were currently in substance misuse treatment, over 50% reported one or more behavioural
addictions concurrent to their substance addiction [28]. However, to date, research has
mainly focused on single addictions with individuals with multiple addictions often being
excluded, with few exceptions [29–31].

To summarise, research into experiences of addiction has several limitations. First,
there is limited research on experiences of individuals in long-term recovery. Second, re-
search tends to explore only one addiction, usually either drugs or alcohol, with individuals
who have experienced multiple addictions being excluded. This study aims to compare the
experiences of individuals in recovery across addictions.

We hypothesize the following:

1.

There will be no signiﬁcant differences between addiction types regarding positive or
negative affect.

2. Quality of life of individuals in recovery will be similar to population norms.

3. Quality of life of individuals in recovery will improve as length of time in recovery in-

creases.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants and Recruitment

Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants to an online survey conducted
on QualtricsTM. The study was advertised on a study-speciﬁc Facebook page, signposted
by a local addiction rehabilitation charity’s Facebook page and distributed via both social
media and emails sent to addiction support service providers. Eligible participants were
required to be aged 18 years or over, in line with ethical requirements [32], and because less
than 1% of those in treatment for addiction are aged 18 years, with almost two-thirds being
aged 40+ [33]. Other requirements included being currently in recovery from one or more
addictions (e.g., drugs and alcohol); having access to the internet (as the questionnaire was
online); and having sufﬁcient English language ability to complete the survey. There were
no other eligibility criteria. The questionnaire was anonymous as sensitive information
was being collected, in line with ethical guidelines [32]. This meant that we had no means
of following up with participants who reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of anxiety or
depression, so we considered it unethical to collect these data.

Overall, 250 participants accessed the questionnaire, of whom 162 started ﬁlling in
the consent form and 154 gave consent and were eligible to participate. Of those 154 par-
ticipants, 115 (74.7%) provided sufﬁcient data for analysis. The remaining 39 stopped the
study after providing demographic information. No signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed
between the 115 participants who completed the questionnaire and the 39 who did not
regarding age, gender, primary addiction, and length of time in recovery. Anonymised
data are stored in Bournemouth University’s Online Research Data Repository (BORDAR).

2.2. Measures

Participants reported their age, gender, length of time in recovery, what they con-
sidered to be their primary addiction, and any other secondary addictions they had
experienced. They then completed self-report questionnaires to assess quality of life
(WHOQOL-Bref) and affect (PANAS-X).

Affect: The PANAS-X [34] consists of 60 words which assesses levels of positive and
negative affect. It assesses the following emotions: general positive emotion, general nega-
tive emotion, fear, hostility, sadness, joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness, shyness, fatigue,
serenity, surprise, basic positive affect (joviality, self-assurance, and attentiveness), and
basic negative affect (fear, hostility, guilt, and sadness). Internal consistency (Cronbach’s
alpha) is high [35]. Cronbach’s alpha in the current study ranged from 0.67 (surprise) to
0.93 (basic negative emotion) and was above 0.70, indicating very good reliability for all
scales except surprise and attentiveness. Both PANAS-X and the shorter PANAS have
assessed affect in individuals with substance use addictions, e.g., [36–38].

Quality of life: The World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-
Bref) [39] consists of 26 questions which utilise a 5-point Likert scale. Individuals rate their
quality of life and satisfaction with their health. The remaining questions assess quality of
life across four domains: physical health, psychological wellbeing, social relationships, and
environment. It has previously been used in studies of individuals in recovery from addic-
tion [11] and enables comparison with general population norms [40]. Reliability (Cronbach’s
alpha) is good [41]. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.19 for the physical health
scale, indicating very poor reliability; 0.55 for the psychological wellbeing scale, indicating
low to acceptable reliability; 0.58 for the social relationships scale, indicating low to acceptable
reliability; and 0.80 for the environment subscale, indicating very good reliability. Further
exploration revealed that the low reliability for the physical health scale was due to responses
to the questions: “To what extent do you feel that physical pain prevents you from doing
what you need to do?” and “How much do you need any medical treatment to function in
your daily life” not correlating with the answers to the other questions. Further exploration

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6375

revealed that removing the question “How often do you have negative feelings such as blue
mood, anxiety, despair, depression?” would increase Cronbach’s alpha for the psychological
wellbeing scale to 0.78, indicating very good reliability.

2.3. Procedure

The study was approved by the Faculty of Science and Technology Research Ethics
Committee, Bournemouth University, on 30 July 2018, ref 21637. Data were collected via an
online survey on Qualtrics between 8 August and 20 September 2018.

2.4. Statistical Analysis

Univariate ANCOVAs were conducted to compare PANAS-X scores by addiction type,
controlling for gender and length of time in recovery. Bonferroni corrections were applied
to reduce the risk of type I error [42]. t-tests were used to compare WHOQOL-Bref scores
to published norms [40]. Mixed ANOVAs and Pearson correlations were conducted to
see how quality of life changed as time in recovery increased. Additionally, Bayes factors
were computed in order to reduce inﬂation in the model. They were calculated using R
(comparisons of WHOQOL-Bref scores to published norms) and SPSS (version 28, IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA; univariate ANCOVAs) using the comparison to a null model
option and with 10,000 posterior samples. Bayes factors are interpreted in terms of the
strength of support for a hypothesis. BF01 < 1 is regarded as strong evidence in support
of the null hypothesis. BF01 = 1 to 3 is regarded as inconclusive evidence, BF01 = 3 to 10
is regarded as moderate evidence, BF01 = 10 to 150 is regarded as strong evidence, and
BF01 > 150 is regarded as very strong evidence.

3. Results
3.1. Descriptives

There were 60 male participants (52.2%) and 55 female participants (47.8%). Ages
ranged from 24 to 70 years (median = 48 and SD = 9.53). Time in recovery ranged from
2 months to 40 years (median = 11 years and SD = 8.34 years). Age of entering recovery
ranged from 18 to 62 years (median = 34 and SD = 7.82). The median age of entering
recovery was 35 years for men (SD = 6.88), 33 years for women (SD = 8.74), 36 years
(SD = 9.40) for individuals with alcohol addictions, and 34 years (SD = 6.92) for individuals
with drug addictions. The primary addictions were drugs (N = 88; 76.5%), alcohol (N = 25;
21.7%), food (N = 1; 0.9%), and sex (N = 1; 0.9%). Among individuals with drug addictions,
there were 47 men (53.4%) and 41 women (46.6%). Among individuals with alcohol
addictions, there were 13 men (52%) and 12 women (48%).

Overall, 79 (69.65%) of participants reported multiple addictions. The number of
addictions per participant by gender are reported in Table 1, the number of addictions
per participant by age group are reported in Table 2, and the frequency of each secondary
addiction are reported in Table 3. Table 1 shows that the number of addictions did not
differ by gender. From Table 3, we can see that the most common secondary addictions
were alcohol and sex for men and alcohol and food for women. Signiﬁcantly more women
than men reported secondary food addiction (χ2 (1) = 8.87, p = 0.003). There were no other
gender differences regarding the number or type of addictions. All other analyses involve
comparisons between individuals with drug and alcohol addictions (n = 113).

3.2. Affect

Univariate ANCOVAs were conducted on each outcome measure with primary addic-
tion as a between-subjects factor and length of time in recovery and gender as covariates.
See Table 4 for mean scores by addiction. No main effects were identiﬁed (all ps NS). The
data were then analysed using Bayesian ANOVAs. Similarly, all Bayes factors provided
strong or very strong evidence favouring the null hypothesis, with BF01 = 53.46–925.03,
indicating that affect experienced in recovery did not differ by addiction.

3.3. Quality of Life

The participant data were compared with normative data to aid the interpretation
of the ﬁndings [40]. See Table 5. First, analyses were conducted using independent
sample t-tests. Compared to the normative data, participants aged 30–39 years scored
signiﬁcantly higher in the environment domain (t (107) = −2.03, p = 0.045), indicating
better ﬁnancial resources, freedom and security, health and social care, home and physical
environments, and opportunities for acquiring new skills and participation in leisure
activities, whereas participants aged 50–59 years scored signiﬁcantly lower in the physical
domain (t (105) = 2.21, p = 0.03), indicating worse physical quality of life. There were no
other signiﬁcant differences between our participants and population norms.

An analysis was then conducted using Bayesian statistics. For participants aged
30–39 years, the Bayes factors indicated weak evidence in support of the null hypothesis
regarding the physical (BF01 = 1.64), psychological (BF01 = 2.36), and social (BF101 = 1.14)
domains. There was weak evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis for the en-
vironment domain (BF10 = 1.42), indicating that our participants tended to report better
quality of life than population norms. For participants aged 40–49 years, Bayes factors
indicated moderate evidence in support of the null hypothesis for the physical (BF01 = 4.86),
psychological (BF01 = 4.87), and environmental (BF01 = 4.84) domains and weak evidence
in support of the null hypothesis for the social domain (BF01 = 2.78). For participants aged
50–59 years, the Bayes factors indicated weak evidence in support of the null hypothesis for
the psychological (BF01 = 2.20) and social (BF01 = 1.85) domains and substantial evidence
in support of the null hypothesis for the environment domain (BF01 = 4.15). There was
inconclusive evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis for the physical domain

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6375

(BF10 = 1.80), indicating that our 50–59-year-old participants tended to experience worse
physical quality of life than the general population.

Participants were then split into four groups based on length of time in recovery. See
Table 6. For all four domains, scores appeared to increase with recovery length up to
11–20 years and decrease during those 21+ years in recovery. This continuing increase in
satisfaction scores tends to suggest that recovery is a long-term process. However, correla-
tions between quality of life and length of recovery as a continuous variable controlling for
gender were not signiﬁcant (all ps NS).

Univariate ANCOVAs were conducted to explore the differences in quality of life
and affect between individuals experiencing one addiction and those experiencing more
than one addiction, controlling for length of time in recovery and gender. There were no
differences in quality of life between individuals reporting one addiction and those report-
ing multiple addictions. Similarly, there were no differences in affect between individuals
reporting one or more addictions. Bayesian ANOVAs were also conducted. For all domains
of quality of life (physical, psychological, social, and environment), Bayes factors provided
very strong evidence in support of the null hypothesis, ranging from BF01 = 199.18 to 612.91.
Similarly, for affect, Bayes factors all provided strong or very strong evidence in support of
the null hypothesis, ranging from BF01 = 28.07 to 968.16.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to determine similarities and differences in relation to thoughts,
feelings, and beliefs among individuals with drug and alcohol addictions. Over two-thirds
of participants reported experiencing two or more addictions and the number of addictions
did not differ by gender; although women were more likely than men to have a secondary
food addiction. Although the most common combination was drugs and alcohol, a range
of substance and non-substance-based addictions were identiﬁed. This suggests that the
traditional idea of studying each addiction in isolation might not be useful [43–45]. In
line with this idea, research has identiﬁed signiﬁcantly more traumatic life events and
higher anxiety levels in the lives of individuals with substance-use disorders than in those
without [44]. Similarly, comorbidity between excessive internet use and problem drinking
has been identiﬁed [46]. Further, male internet addicts and individuals who report alcohol
dependence have similar personality traits, emotion, temperament, and increased anxiety
and depression compared to healthy controls [47]. This research could be extended to assess
whether similar ﬁndings apply to individuals with other addictions or multiple addictions.
As expected, there were no signiﬁcant differences between addictions regarding
affect or quality of life. There were also no differences in affect or quality of life between
individuals with one addiction and those with multiple addictions, even after controlling
for gender. It was also expected that quality of life and health would increase over time in
recovery. Participants reported high overall quality of life in recovery but only a moderate
satisfaction with quality of health. Although quality of life appeared to improve as time

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6375

8 of 11

in recovery increased until 21+ years post-recovery, when it reduced, no relation between
quality of life and length of time in recovery was identiﬁed. However, it is also important
to be aware that clean time increases with age. Younger participants in our study have
fewer years clean, which confounds this issue.

Compared to the general population, participants in recovery tended to report similar
quality of life. There were two exceptions. First, in the domain of environment, indi-
viduals aged 30–39 years tended to score higher than population norms, possibly due to
greater appreciation of life following their “second chance” [48]. Second, participants aged
50–59 years tended to score lower than population norms in the physical domain, in line
with evidence that addiction accelerates the process of biological ageing [49]. However,
given the low reliability of the physical health scale that suggests our participants do not
have a standard physical health proﬁle (a greater threshold for pain and belief in a reduced
need for medical treatment to function relative to the general population), these results
should be treated with caution.

Limitations and Future Work

Sampling is always an issue in addiction studies. It is easier to recruit from treatment
centres, aftercare services, or self-help groups [50] than from individuals who have recov-
ered on their own, as the latter cannot be identiﬁed without self-disclosure. Having the
questionnaire online only also excluded those without internet access or those who did
not see the invitations sent to their treatment providers. Within the self-help community,
links on social media mean that inviting one person to participate in research can lead to
all of their recovery friends also seeing it through snowball sampling. These factors raise
issues around the generalisability of the ﬁndings and the representativeness of the partici-
pants. Individuals who recovered naturally from addiction are likely under-represented.
Although Borkman and colleagues [51] advertised in the national press to recruit individu-
als who had recovered from addiction naturally, 75% of their sample were from self-help
groups. Further, individuals who felt their recovery was not currently successful may not
have wished to participate [52]. Also, as information provided in the questionnaire was
self-reported, it was not possible to exclude people who were not genuinely abstinent.
Further, given the small sample size, the ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution. In
addition, we did not collect data about the duration of addiction prior to entering recov-
ery or treatment history. Quality of life in longer-term recovery may vary depending on
the duration of initial addiction, given the impact of addictive substances on physical
and psychological wellbeing and the evidence suggesting that individuals who receive
longer-term treatment for addiction have a greater chance of sustained abstinence than
those who receive shorter-term treatment [53]. Further research is needed to explore these
issues. Further, we did not collect data about smoking or current alcohol intake, which
is important as evidence suggests that both smoking [54] and harmful drinking [55] are
signiﬁcantly associated with poorer quality of life.

The ﬁnding that almost two-thirds of participants reported experiencing two or more
addictions creates more questions. It is not clear whether the addictions were consecutive
or concurrent. Further research is needed to determine how and why secondary addictions
developed (e.g., to control primary addictions), and whether addictions progress or change
over time. Coming into recovery from one addiction may also cause other addictions
to become apparent. For example, the limited treatment services available for gambling
addictions in the UK means that very few gamblers without concurrent addictions can
access treatment. The lack of differences between individuals in recovery from drug and
alcohol addictions in this study also raises questions around the importance of identifying
psychological differences between groups of people who experience addiction.

5. Conclusions

Individuals with drug and alcohol addictions, including both men and women, report
similar experiences in recovery in relation to emotions experienced and quality of life. Over

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6375

9 of 11

two-thirds of participants considered themselves to be addicted to more than one substance
or behaviour. This would suggest that, ﬁrst, there are no differences between addictions
regarding their impact on psychological wellbeing in the long term; second, apart from
studying the effects of physical dependence, addictions should not be studied in isolation
when studying psychological health during long-term recovery; and ﬁnally, quality of
life appears to improve as time in recovery increases, suggesting that recovery should be
thought of as a continuous process rather than a time-limited process with a clear endpoint.
