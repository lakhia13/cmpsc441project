Aim: To explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic first wave in Quebec,

Canada on practices in early intervention services (EIS) for first-episode psychosis,

including

clinical

and

practices

and

teleconsultation use.

Methods: Adopting a cross-sectional descriptive study design, a 41 questions online

survey was sent to the team leaders of all the 33 Quebec EIS, of which 100%

responded. Data were collected from 18 May to 4 June 2020 and analysed using

descriptive statistics and content analysis. Programmes were categorized as urban/

non-urban and results were compared between these.

Results: All 33 existing Quebec EIS (16 urban and 17 non-urban) completed the sur-

vey. Among them, 85% did not experience redeployment of EIS team staff and 58%

reported stable frequency of patient interactions, either in-person or through tele-

medicine. During the studied period, 64% of programmes reported that all profes-

sionals used teleconsultation at least occasionally. However, 73% of programmes,

mostly in non-urban areas, reported some limitations regarding clinicians' degree of

ease with teleconferencing platforms and half of EIS could not access technical sup-

port to use them. The majority of EIS (94%) expressed interest to participate in a

training program about the use of technologies for teleconsultations. Many smaller

clinics reported interest in offering multiregional/multiclinics group teletherapy,

therefore merging their pool of patients and clinical staff workforce.

Conclusions: Further studies are warranted to improve access to and use of

technology-mediated treatment, which seems to be a promising alternative to pro-

vide high-quality mental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
