Keywords:
Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder
ADHD
Sugar consumption

Background: Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by persistent symptoms of lack of
attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. The association between nutritional exposures and ADHD has been
investigated and some studies have identiﬁed adverse eﬀects from higher intake of sugar. The objective of the
present study was to evaluate the association between change in sugar consumption between 6 and 11 years of
age and incidence of attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Methods: Pelotas 2004 Birth Cohort Study in Brazil. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to estimate
sugar consumption and the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was applied to mothers to assess
the presence of ADHD.
Results: Only children without ADHD at 6 years and with complete information from FFQ and DAWBA at 6 and
11 years were included in the analyses (n = 2924). Odds ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated.
Incidence of ADHD between 6 and 11 years was 4.6% (3.6–5.6%) among boys and 1.8% (1.2–2.5%) among girls.
Adjusted analyses showed no association between always high sucrose consumption between 6 and 11 years and
incidence of ADHD, compared with individuals who always presented low consumption, both among boys
(OR = 0.66; 0.21–2.04) and girls (OR = 2.71; 0.24–30.35).
Limitations: Reﬂect those that are inherent to use of FFQs, such as memory bias and lack of precision in
quantifying the diet.
Conclusions: The results suggest that there is no association between sucrose consumption between 6 and 11
years of age and incidence of ADHD.

1. Introduction

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by
persistent symptoms of lack of attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.
It generally ﬁrst appears during childhood and persists through ado-
lescence and into adulthood, with cumulative losses over the course of
development of the individuals aﬀected (Barkley and Roizman, 2002;
American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ADHD is one of the most
prevalent neurobiological disorders in the world, (Polanczyk et al.,
2007) and presents complex, highly inheritable etiology (Faraone et al.,
2005). The association between nutritional exposures and ADHD has
been investigated. Some studies have identiﬁed protective eﬀects from
higher intake of iron (Konofal et al., 2004, 2008), zinc (Akhondzadeh
et al., 2004; Arnold et al., 2005) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Sinn

and Bryan, 2007; Richardson and Montgomery, 2005; Johnson et al.,
2008); and adverse eﬀects from higher intake of
food colorings
(Bateman et al., 2004; Rowe and Rowe, 1994; Schab and Trinh, 2004),
preservatives (McCann et al., 2007) and sugar (Wolraich et al., 1995;
Azadbakht and Esmaillzadeh, 2012; Lien et al., 2006; Park et al., 2012).
Sucrose, also known as table sugar or reﬁned sugar, is a carbohy-
drate that, when hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes, is converted into
glucose and fructose. Sucrose is rapidly metabolized by the human body
and thus is a rapid energy source (Lehninger, 2002). The main source of
sucrose is sugar cane (Saccharum oﬃcinarum). Through an industrial
process, sugar cane is transformed into a solid crystalline product.
Sugar is a widely commercialized product, frequently used in foods,
including for children (Welsh et al., 2011).

The mechanism through which sugar consumption is a biologically

plausible determinant of ADHD is thought to involve higher release of
extracellular dopamine (a monoaminergic neurotransmitter in the ca-
techolamine family) in the area of the striatum, and is related to the
reward system (Schwartz et al., 2000). Over the long term, sugar con-
sumption would lead to desensitization of dopaminergic receptors,
which would result in the need for increased intake, as a compensatory
mechanism, in order to obtain the same level of satisfaction. This would
consequently lead to a progressive reduction in dopamine response
after sugar consumption. This dopaminergic signaling dysfunction
would promote inhibition of the control mechanisms of the frontal
cortex, which is an area directly related to the neurobiology of ADHD
(Johnson et al., 2011).

Several studies focusing on the association between sugar con-
sumption and attention deﬁcit and/or hyperactivity have been con-
ducted. In 1995, Wolraich et al. (2016) conducted a meta-analysis that
included 16 experimental studies. They concluded that sugar con-
sumption did not pose any threat of attention deﬁcit and/or hyper-
activity among children. More recent studies have presented conﬂicting
results: some suggested that there might be a positive association be-
tween sugar-rich food consumption or feeding patterns and ADHD
(Azadbakht and Esmaillzadeh, 2012; Lien et al., 2006; Park et al., 2012;
Wiles et al., 2009; Howard et al., 2011), while others did not ﬁnd this
association (Peacock et al., 2011; Kim and Chang, 2011).

In the light of the inconsistency among the ﬁndings, the objective of
the present study was to evaluate the eﬀect of sugar consumption and
the prevalence of ADHD among children aged 6 and 11 years, along
with the incidence of ADHD between 6 and 11 years of age, in the 2004
Pelotas Birth Cohort.

2. Methodology

The municipality of Pelotas, located in the southernmost part of
Brazil, has a population of approximately 340,000 inhabitants, pre-
dominantly residing in the urban zone (93%) (Censo, 2010). In 2004, a
birth cohort study was started in this municipality. It included 4231
newborns (99.2% of the births in 2004) who were children of mothers
living in the urban zone of this municipality. These newborns were
identiﬁed through visits to the maternity wards of the ﬁve hospitals in
the municipality. Within the ﬁrst 24 h postpartum, all the mothers were
interviewed and their children were evaluated (perinatal study). In-
formation on their socioeconomic, demographic and reproductive
characteristics, their use of healthcare services and prenatal care and
their pregnancy complications was obtained. Further methodological
details of this study can be found in other published papers (Santos
et al., 2010, 2014; Barros et al., 2006).

So far, the participants of the cohort have been evaluated at three
months of age and at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11 years old, and the follow-up rates
obtained have been 99.2%, 95.7%, 93.5%, 92%, 90.2% and 86.6%,
respectively (Santos et al., 2010, 2014). Up to the children's age of four
years, interviews were conducted at their homes, and data on the mo-
thers’ health and the children's growth, development, type of diet and
morbidities were sampled (Santos et al., 2010). At the children's ages of
6 and 11 years, data gathering took place in a medical clinic that had
been built and equipped especially for conducting the study. At both of
these follow-ups, in addition to interviews, the children underwent
thorough health evaluation examinations, which included psycholo-
gical, anthropometric and body composition evaluations (Santos et al.,
2014).

Data from the perinatal follow-up (N = 4231), from the follow-up at
the age of 6 years (N = 3799) and from the follow-up at the age of 11
years (N = 3566) were used in the present study. The Development and
Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was used to evaluate the outcome of
interest, ADHD. The DAWBA was applied to the mothers in the form of
an interview, by trained interviewers, during the follow-ups at the ages
of 6 and 11 years. The DAWBA is a structured tool consisting of ques-
tions that planned such that they would generate diagnoses based on

the classiﬁcations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM) and the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-
10), among children and teenagers between 5 and 17 years of age
(Fleitlich-Bilyk and Goodman, 2004). The ADHD module consists of 31
questions, and includes classiﬁcations of “any ADHD disorder”, as well
as speciﬁc subtypes (hyperactivity-impulsivity, lack of attention and
combined). The DAWBA has been widely used as a diagnostic tool in
psychiatric epidemiological studies during childhood and adolescence
and was brought to Brazil and validated here by Fleitlich-Bilyk and
Goodman (2004) In order to make the various diagnostic classiﬁcations,
from the results produced by the DAWBA, a clinical rater evaluates and
decides on whether symptoms are present and what losses (impacts)
they have caused to the child's life, based on the diagnostic criteria of
the ICD-10 or DSM. In the present study, the classiﬁcations used were
DSM-IV (at 6 years of age) and DSM-V (at 11 years of age). At 6 years of
age, the clinical judgment was made by a child psychiatrist, and at 11
years, by two psychologists. At both follow-ups, the raters were trained
by the child psychiatrist who had translated and validated the DAWBA
for the Brazilian population (Fleitlich-Bilyk and Goodman, 2004).

At the ages of 6 and 11 years, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
was used to investigate food consumption. The FFQ used at 6 years of
age was quantitative, with 54 food items, and was answered by mothers
or guardians, with a one-year recall. Food consumption was informed as
the number of times (1 to 10) per day, week, month or year. For each
food item, a pre-established medium portion was presented. The in-
terviewee was then asked whether the child had consumed an amount
equal to or smaller or larger than this medium portion. In order to
analyze the nutritional composition, a smaller portion was calculated as
half of the medium portion; a larger portion, as twice the medium
portion; and an extra-large portion, as 2.5 times larger than the medium
portion.

The FFQ used in the follow-up at the age of 11 years was electronic
and quantitative, composed of 88 food items, with a one-year recall
period. In the self-reporting questionnaire, the mothers were asked
whether their children had consumed any of the food items, the fre-
quency of consumption (daily, weekly, monthly or annually) and the
size of the portion consumed. For each food item, a photo of the
medium portion was presented and the interviewee was asked whether
the child had consumed an equal, smaller or larger portion. For nutri-
tional composition analyses, the smaller portion was calculated as half
of the medium portion, and the larger portion, as twice the medium
portion.

Sucrose consumption, at both follow-ups, was evaluated through the
intake of the following food items: sweet cookies, cake, sweets (candy,
bubble gum and lollypops), chocolate, ice cream, chocolate milk, ad-
ditional sugar (used to sweeten coﬀee, tea and juices), jam, sodas, ar-
tiﬁcial-ﬂavored juices and sandwich cookies. Annual, monthly, weekly
consumption frequencies were transformed into daily frequencies. The
table from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
(USDA Agricultural Research Service, 2014) was then used to calculate
the amounts of sucrose present in these foods. These values were then
multiplied by the daily consumption frequencies. The sum of the daily
sucrose consumption from each food item resulted in the total sucrose
consumption per day.

The information regarding sucrose consumption from the follow-ups
at 6 and 11 years of age was combined in order to conduct analyses.
Initially, quantitative variables were categorized in terciles and then
combined in order to generate ﬁve consumption categories: always low
consumption (ﬁrst consumption tercile at 6 and 11 years old); always
medium consumption (second consumption tercile at 6 and 11 years
old); always high consumption (third consumption tercile at 6 and 11
years old); increasing consumption (from the ﬁrst to the second or to
the third tercile; or from the second to the third tercile); and decreasing
consumption (from the second to the ﬁrst tercile; or from the third to
the second or to the ﬁrst tercile).

consumption and ADHD, for which data were gathered during the
perinatal interview, were used in the following adjusted analyses:
National Economic Index (NEI) (Barros and Victora, 2005); maternal
educational level (number of years of schooling); mother's age (in years
and categorized as <20, 20–35 or >35); marital status (mother living
with or without a spouse); maternal smoking during pregnancy (at least
one cigarette/day for at least one trimester of pregnancy); maternal
alcohol consumption during pregnancy (yes or no); prenatal follow-up
(yes or no); number of prenatal consultations; symptoms of maternal
mood during pregnancy (through the question “During pregnancy, did
you have depression or feel anxious?”) (yes, treated; yes, untreated; or
no); pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), categorized into low weight
(<18.5 kg/m2),
overweight
(25–29.9 kg/m2) or obese (≥30 kg/m2); heavy caﬀeine consumption
(≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy (yes or no); child's gestational age at
birth; type of delivery (normal or cesarean section); and low birth
weight (<2500 g) (yes or no).

Variables relating to the children, gathered at 6 years of age, were
also used as potential confounding factors: number of siblings living in
(≥10 or <10)
the
(Matricciani et al., 2013); and BMI for the age (<2 Z-scores, between
−2 and +2 Z-scores or >2 Z-scores). The Wechsler Intelligence Scale
for Children-III (WISC-III) (Wechsler, 2002) was used for calculating
the intelligence quotient (IQ), using the American standardization and
conversion into Z-scores (Z-score <−1 for low IQ). Daily consumption
of coﬀee was also assessed (yes or no). The Edinburgh Postnatal De-
pression Scale was used to evaluate maternal depression and was ca-
tegorized as <13 (negative depression screening), and ≥13 (positive
depression screening) (Santos et al., 2007), and was also investigated as
a potential confounding factor.

Only children from single pregnancies were included in the analyses
(n perinatal = 4147; n of the follow-up at 6 years of age = 3721; n of
the follow-up at 11 years of age = 3497). In order to perform cross-
sectional analyses (sucrose consumption at 6 and 11 years of age and
prevalence of ADHD at 6 and 11 years), 3239 and 3444 children were
included, respectively, considering only the children for whom ex-
posure and outcome data were available. Mean sucrose consumption in
grams per day (g/d) was calculated, with the respective standard de-
viation (SD), at 6 and 11 years of age, according to the food source. The
t test was used to evaluate the diﬀerence in mean consumption between
children with and without ADHD.

The prevalence of ADHD was calculated at 6 and 11 years of age,
with the respective 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI), according to the
sucrose consumption at 6 and 11 years of age, respectively (cross-sec-
tional analysis). The cumulative incidence of ADHD between 6 and 11
years of age was evaluated according to the change in sucrose con-
sumption within the same period (longitudinal analysis). A total of
3005 children presented complete information from the FFQ and
DAWBA at 6 and 11 years old.

There was an interaction between sucrose consumption and sex
(p = 0.029). The crude and adjusted analyses on the eﬀect of sucrose
consumption on ADHD were stratiﬁed according to sex and logistic
regression was applied, with adjustment
for confounding factors
(variables that were associated both with exposure and with the out-
come at the level of p ≤ 0.20) and for daily consumption of calories
from sucrose-free food sources. Only children without ADHD at 6 years
of age and with complete information from the FFQ and DAWBA at 6
and 11 years of age were included in these analyses (n = 2924), and in
the calculations of cumulative ADHD incidence between 6 and 11 years
old (longitudinal analyses). 95% CI values were obtained for cumula-
tive incidences and for odds ratios (OR).

All follow-ups of the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort were approved by
the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the Federal
University of Pelotas.

Description of follow-up losses.

3. Results

Follow-up loss rates at 6 and 11 years of age, according to maternal
characteristics during pregnancy (NEI, educational level, marital status,
smoking, alcohol consumption, number of prenatal consultations, and
mood symptoms) and the child`s sex, are presented in Table 1. At these
two follow-ups, the losses were higher among children who belonged to
families at the extremes of the NEI (1st and 5th quintiles), whose mo-
thers were less educated and without a spouse, had fewer than six
prenatal consultations and had untreated mood problems during
pregnancy. At 11 years of age, there was also a higher proportion of
losses among children of mothers who smoked (Table 1).

The mean sucrose consumption at 6 years old was 130.81 (73.37) g/
day and 108.45 (68.49) g/day, among children with and without
ADHD, respectively (p = 0.003). At 11 years of age, the mean con-
sumption was 186.68 (183.11) g/day and 147.77 (135.02) g/day,
among children with and without ADHD, respectively (p < 0.001).

At 6 years of age, the food items that contributed most to sucrose
consumption among children without ADHD were additional sugar,
artiﬁcially ﬂavored juices, sodas and chocolate milk, representing
21.3%, 20.0%, 16.6% and 11.1% of the total sucrose consumed, re-
spectively. Among children with ADHD, the sucrose sources most
consumed were artiﬁcially ﬂavored juices (22.2%), additional sugar
(18.9%), sodas (17.2%) and sweet cookies (11.2%). Children with
ADHD at 6 years of age consumed more ice cream and artiﬁcially ﬂa-
vored juices than those without ADHD (Table 2).

At 11 years of age, the food items that contributed most to sucrose
consumption among children without ADHD were sodas (26.6%), sweet
cookies (20.2%), artiﬁcially ﬂavored juices (17.0%) and additional
sugar (14.6%); and, among those with ADHD, sweet cookies (22.5%),
sodas (20.5%), artiﬁcial-ﬂavored juices (17.5%) and additional sugar
(14.5%). Children with ADHD presented higher consumption of sweet
cookies, additional sugar, jams and artiﬁcial-ﬂavored juices than those
without ADHD (Table 2).

Tables 3 and 4 show the association between sucrose consumption
at 6 and 11 years of age and the prevalence of ADHD at 6 and 11 years,
along with the association between the change in consumption between
6 and 11 years of age and the cumulative incidence of ADHD between 6
and 11 years of age, separately for boys and girls. At 6 years of age, the
prevalence of ADHD among the boys became higher as the sucrose
consumption increased (Table 3). In the ﬁrst tertile of consumption the
prevalence was 1.8 (0.7–2.9), in the second tertile 2.8 (1.5–4.2) and in
the third 5.8 (3.9–7.8), and the association remained signiﬁcant even
after adjusting for maternal and child characteristics (p = 0.02)
(Table 3). In girls, the association was not present, the prevalence of
ADHD in the ﬁrst tertile of consumption was 1.7 (0.6–2.9), in the
second tertile 1.2 (0.2–2.1) and in the third 2.3 (1.0–3.6), even after
adjustment (p = 0.88).

At 11 years of age, among the boys, the same pattern was observed,
the prevalence of ADHD was 4.7 (3.1–6.6), 6.1 (3.9–7.7) and 6.7
(4.8–8.8), in the ﬁrst, second and third tertiles, respectively (Table 3).
However, the 95% CIs overlapped each other, thus indicating that there
was no association. In addition, no association was observed among the

4. Discussion

In the present study, sucrose consumption was associated with the
prevalence of ADHD among boys at 6 years of age, in a cross-sectional
analysis adjusted for confounding factors. However, subsequent cross-
sectional analyses, at 11 years of age, indicated there was no association
in either crude or adjusted analyses. There was also no association
between sucrose consumption and the incidence of ADHD between 6
and 11 years of age. The eﬀect of changes in sucrose consumption be-
tween 6 and 11 years of age on the incidence of ADHD over the same

period was zero, both in crude and in adjusted analyses, for boys and
girls.

The daily consumption of sugar in the children of this study was
around 120 g, corresponding to about 30% of the total energetic value
of the diet. In Brazil, between 1987–1988 and 2002–2003, consumption
of sugar and soft drinks accounted for 13.4% of household energy
availability. (Monteiro et al., 2010) According to Levy et al. (2009),
household availability of high sugar content was associated with total
home energy availability around 50% above the recommended value.
Another more recent study with adolescents showed that consumption
of fats and sugars contributed 52% of the daily caloric intake. This
evidence points to consumption far above what is recommended by the
WHO, which in 2015 has released a new guide to sugar consumption
recommendations for adults and children (WHO, 2015). The re-
commendation is that the consumption is less than 10% of the calories
consumed daily, and greater beneﬁts can be achieved with a con-
sumption below 5%, which corresponds to the consumption of 25 g of
sugar per day (WHO, 2015).

Conﬂicting data is presented in the literature regarding the eﬀect of
sugar on the occurrence of ADHD (Wolraich et al., 1995; Azadbakht and
Esmaillzadeh, 2012; Lien et al., 2006; Park et al., 2012; Wiles et al.,
2009; Howard et al., 2011; Peacock et al., 2011; Kim and Chang, 2011).
The reasons for these divergences include diﬀerences both in the op-
erational deﬁnition of the exposure and in the design, sample size and
confounding variables considered in the analysis. Among studies found
in the literature, a few investigated the consumption of sucrose or
carbohydrates(Wolraich et al., 1995); others, the consumption of sugar-
rich food (Lien et al., 2006, Kim and Chang, 2011); and yet others,
dietary consumption patterns (Azadbakht and Esmaillzadeh, 2012; Park
et al., 2012; Wiles et al., 2009; Howard et al., 2011; Peacock et al.,
2011). Most of the studies in which sucrose or sucrose-rich food were
evaluated were double-blind experimental studies, with small numbers
of participants (Wolraich et al., 1995).

More recent studies, especially cohort studies (Wiles et al., 2009;
Peacock et al., 2011), evaluated the eﬀect of dietary patterns. However,
dietary pattern evaluation does not allow identiﬁcation of the dietary
component to which the eﬀect should be attributed. In addition, the
process of building dietary patterns is complex and involves arbitrary
decisions, going from creation of food groups to retention of patterns
and their interpretation (Olinto et al., 2007). Furthermore, the dietary
patterns identiﬁed in a given study are speciﬁc to that population, thus
impairing comparability among the ﬁndings.

The majority of cohort or cross-sectional studies, which included
several hundred children and made adjustments at least for sex, age and
socioeconomic conditions, found an association between higher sugar
consumption and ADHD (Azadbakht and Esmaillzadeh, 2012; Lien

However, diﬀerently from the present study, they evaluated the ex-
posure exclusively from soda consumption (Lien et al., 2006) or
through construction of an indicator based only on consumption of
sweet food, without taking into account the amount of sucrose present
in this food. (Park et al., 2012) Longitudinal studies in which the ex-
posure was evaluated through using dietary patterns containing only
sweet food (Azadbakht and Esmaillzadeh, 2012) or sweet and ultra-
processed food (Wiles et al.,2009; Howard et al., 2011) found this as-
sociation.

The majority of the experimental studies in which this association
was
investigated were conducted during the 1980s and 1990s
(Wolraich et al., 1995). The experiments consisted of oﬀering a sucrose-
sweetened drink to one group, while the other group (control) was
oﬀered the same drink sweetened with aspartame or saccharin. Most of
these studies did not ﬁnd any association between sugar consumption
and attention-deﬁcit and/or hyperactivity (Wolraich et al., 1995).

The association between sucrose consumption and ADHD in the
present study was present only in the cross-sectional analysis, and was
exclusively among boys at 6 years of age. Generic and neuroimaging
studies have suggested that the neurobiology of the ADHD involves
dysfunction of the reward system (Blum et al., 2008; Volkow et al.,
2007, 2011; Rosa et al., 2002). Knowing that certain types of food,
especially those rich in sugar, trigger the reward system (Johnson et al.,
2011; Wise, 2006; Lenoir et al., 2007), it is possible that the results from
studies that found an eﬀect from sugar on ADHD reﬂect higher sugar
consumption by individuals who would develop the disorder regardless
of this factor. Hyperactive/impulsive behavior might be associated with
higher sucrose consumption, in which this is a consequence of rather
that a determining factor for ADHD. A recently published cohort study
evaluated dietary behavior in children with ADHD and found a positive
symptoms
association
(Leventakou et al., 2016). Another study revealed that children with
ADHD presented irregular meals, ate more than ﬁve times a day and
consumed many sugary drinks during the day (Ptacek et al., 2014).
These results are consistent with those of other studies that showed a
higher prevalence of binge eating in individuals with ADHD (Cortese
et al., 2007; Docet et al., 2012; Seitz et al., 2013).

This study has limitations and strengths. Among the limitations it is
important to consider the inﬂuence of uncontrolled factors on the re-
sults of this study. For instance, evidence from epidemiological and
animal studies indicates that maternal diet during pregnancy plays an
important
regulates behavior
(Sullivan et al., 2014). The mechanisms by which the maternal diet
inﬂuences the intrauterine environment has not yet been fully eluci-
dated, but some studies have shown that an increase in inﬂammatory
cytokines, nutrients such as glucose and fatty acids, and hormones such
as insulin and leptin in the maternal organism directly aﬀect the fetus
(Sullivan et al., 2014). Therefore, an intrauterine environment exposed
to a maternal diet rich in fats and sugars would result in the develop-
ment of mental and behavioral disorders such as anxiety and depression
(Bilbo and Tsang, 2010), attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(Ray et al., 2009), and autism spectrum disorders (Patterson, 2011).

Another limitation of the present study reﬂects those that are in-
herent to use of FFQs, such as memory bias and lack of precision in
quantifying the diet. Use of FFQs as a tool for evaluating diets in a
clinical environment leads to imprecision, especially when the objective
is to quantify nutrient consumption, due to the complexity of this
measurement (Willett, 1994). However, in epidemiological studies, it is
the instrument most recommended, in relation to those that make spot
evaluations on diets, performed during the same day or within a period
of a few days. When the objective is to evaluate diets as exposure fac-
tors for health outcomes, it does not matter what a person consumes at
one speciﬁc moment, but rather, over the course of time (Willett, 1994).
Among the strengths of the present study is the fact that the diet was
investigated at two moments in time, which enabled evaluation of the

295

change in dietary consumption over the period. This approach is very
important because it allows discrimination of the population according
to the variation in dietary behavior. In addition, because this study used
data from a birth cohort of a city in southern Brazil, the data are gen-
eralizable for a population with similar characteristics.

Other positive aspects of the present study include its investigation
of the association through a longitudinal analysis, among children free
from the baseline outcome (at 6 years of age), using data from a pro-
spective cohort study, which is ideal for investigating the issue because
it preserves the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome.
Another positive aspect of the present study was its investigation of
the outcome (ADHD) using an instrument that had been validated and
(Fleitlich-Bilyk and
adapted for use on Brazilian populations
Goodman, 2004). The DAWBA uses internationally acknowledged di-
agnostic criteria, applied by a properly trained clinical rater, and allows
conﬁrmation of the diagnosis of the disorder based on symptoms, losses
and qualitative information. In addition, the percentage losses at both
follow-ups were low, and adjustment for a large number of potential
confounding factors could be made. Another strength of the present
study was that it used a test evaluating modiﬁcation of the eﬀect of
sucrose on occurrences of ADHD according to the children's sex. No
other study in which the interaction between sucrose consumption and
sex was evaluated was found in the literature.

The present study showed that sucrose consumption was associated
with the prevalence of ADHD only among boys at 6 years of age, and
that persistence of high consumption or an increase in sugar con-
sumption between 6 and 11 years of age was not associated with higher
incidence of ADHD between 6 and 11 years of age. This supports the
hypothesis that the higher sugar consumption by children with ADHD is
possibly a consequence rather than a determinant of the disorder.
