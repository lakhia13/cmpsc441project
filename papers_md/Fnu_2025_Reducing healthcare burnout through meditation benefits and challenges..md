ABSTRACT
Currently, healthcare professionals face challenges such as excessive stress, mental 
distress,  psychiatric  issues,  and  burnout.  Contributors  include  various  personal, 
professional,  and  environmental  stressors  such  as  prolonged  work  hours,  high 
workload, patient care responsibility, information overload, and financial concerns. 
Stress  and  burnout  can  cause  employee  turnover,  staffing  shortages,  medical 
errors,  reduced  job  satisfaction,  and  reduced  interest  in  pursuing  or  continuing 
healthcare  as  a  career.  This  paper  explores  meditation  as  a  possible  solution  for 
tackling  stress-  and  burnout-related  issues  among  healthcare  professionals.  We 
present findings from various studies that have revealed the physiological effects of 
meditation and demonstrated its impact on stress reduction, cardiovascular health, 
immune function, brain structure, pain management, and genetic expression. We 
provide insights into commonly used meditation tools such as mindfulness-based 
stress  reduction  (MSBR)  programs,  challenges,  and  solutions  for  implementing 
meditation-related programs in mainstream healthcare delivery.

and  depletion  of  personal  coping  resources,  leading  to  emotional  exhaus-
tion,  depersonalization,  and  a  reduced  sense  of  personal  accomplishment 
(Thimmapuram  et  al.,  2017).  It  is  a  rampant  issue  among  medical  practi-
tioners,  including  students  in  the  United  States,  residents,  and  practicing 
physicians,  affecting  nearly  half  of  health  practitioners.  A  2014  survey 
revealed  that  54.4%  of  US  physicians  experienced  at  least  one  burnout 
symptom, an increase from 45.5% in 2011 (Patel et al., 2019). Based on the 
medical  specialty  and  age  group  of  the  physician,  researchers  analyzed 
loss of productivity due to lost  hours as well  as expenses related to listing, 
training  and  rehiring  a  physician  and  suggested  an  overall  cost  of 
$4.6  billion  within  the  American  healthcare  system  and  $7,600  per  physi-
cian  (Han  et  al.,  2019).  Additionally,  burnout  increases  the  risk  of  medical 
errors,  as  shown  by  a  survey  of  medical  residents  in  Ireland,  which  found 
that  64%  of  those  experiencing  burnout  symptoms  reported  making 
a  medical  error,  compared  to  only  22%  of  those  without  burnout  symp-
toms  (O’connor  et  al.,  2017).  In  a  survey  of  surgeons,  8.9%  of  the  respon-
dents  reported  making  a  major  medical  error  in  the  past  3 months  with 
about  30%  reported  lapse  in  judgement  due  to  burnout  being  a  major 
cause  (Shanafelt  et  al.,  2010).  Burnout  also  leads  to  decreased  job  satisfac-
tion,  higher  turnover,  absenteeism,  and  strained  relationships  (Siedsma  & 
Emlet,  2015).  Various  factors  have  been  shown  to  contribute  to  burnout  in 
physicians, such as situational stressors (work hours, sleep deprivation, and 
staff  conflicts),  personal  stressors  (conflicts  with  family  or  friends,  financial 
difficulties,  or  relocating  to  a  new  city),  and  professional  stressors  (patient 
responsibilities,  teaching  or  supervisory  responsibilities,  and  information 
overload,  among  others)  affecting  patient  outcomes,  doctors,  and  the 
overall  system  (Busireddy  et  al.,  2017;  Grover  et  al.,  2018)).

Various  strategies  that  have  been  employed  to  address  burnout  include 
retreats,  practicing  self-care,  spending  time  with  family  and  limiting  work 
hours.  In  addition,  research  has  shown  that  meditation  interventions  effec-
tively  minimizes  stress  levels  and  boosts  one’s  health  (Thimmapuram  et  al.,  
2019). Meditation, an ancient practice with roots in various spiritual traditions, 
has emerged as a powerful tool for promoting mental well-being.

Meditation encompasses a variety of practices and approaches designed to 
improve consciousness, cultivate mental clarity, and improve overall psycho-
social and physical health. Despite many meditation practices across various 
cultures,  the  commonly  employed  meditation  techniques  in  healthcare  set-
tings  include  mindfulness  meditation,  Transcendental  meditation  (TM),  lov-
ing-kindness meditation (LKM) and yoga, each offering unique benefits such 
as  stress  reduction,  emotional  regulation,  and  enhanced  concentration.  By 
engaging in meditation regularly, individuals can cultivate a greater sense of 
balance in their lives and achieve a more profound connection to themselves 
and their surroundings.

Mindfulness,  defined  as  paying  attention  in  a  particular  way:  on 
purpose,  in  the  present  moment,  and  nonjudgmentally  (Black,  2011), 
is  one  of  the  commonly  used  interventions  and  includes  Mindfulness- 
based  stress  reduction  (MBSR)  and  mindfulness  cognitive  therapy 
(MBCT).  TM  is  a  meditation  technique  wherein  practitioners  silently 
repeat  a  singular  mantra  (a  sound  devoid  of  meaning)  without  focus 
or  reflection.  LKM  is  a  form  of  meditation  from  ancient  Buddhist  culture 
(Zeng  et  al.,  2015)  in  which  practitioners  focus  on  kindness  to  them-
selves,  loved  ones,  acquaintances,  strangers,  and  all  beings.  In  LKM, 
practitioners  repeat  phrases  such  as  “may  you  be  happy”  or  “may  you 
be  free  from  suffering”  toward  targets.

There  is  an  abundance  of  data  showing  the  impact  of  meditation  on 
healthcare  providers  (Cohen  et  al.,  2023).  Research  has  indicated  that 
there  is  a  diminishing  of  stress,  anxiety,  and  burnout  syndrome  in 
healthcare  practitioners  who  engage  in  daily  meditations  (Krasner  et  al.,  
2009).  Meditation  supports  healthcare  personnel  physically  through 
relaxation  and  psychologically  by  creating  a  protective  shield  against 
outside  stress  and  maintaining  empathy  and  compassion  for  patients. 
In  addition  to  psychological  benefits,  meditation  often  seems  to  lead  to 
a  decrease  in  blood  pressure,  enhancement  of  immunological  response, 
and  an  overall  decrease  in  inflammation  (Black  et  al.,  2015).  Various 
hospitals  and  healthcare  institutions  have  implemented  meditation  in 
their  day-to-day  work,  and  numerous  studies  have  proven  its  efficacy. 
For  instance,  the  Mayo  Clinic  in  Rochester,  Minnesota,  began  providing 
mindfulness  meditation  programs  to  its  workers,  reducing  burnout  and 
increasing  job  satisfaction  among  employees  (Amutio  et  al.,  2018). 
Likewise,  the  Cleveland  Clinic  has  implemented  meditation  programs  to 
help  decrease  stress  among  the  medical  personnel  who  treat  patients 
and  enhance  patients’  well-being  (Shanafelt  et  al.,  2019).  Programs  such 
as  MBSR  and  tailored  meditation  workshops  for  healthcare  professionals 
show  promise  in  overcoming  these  obstacles.  Allowing  meditation  to 
become  a  keystone  for  supporting  corporate  well-being  and  developing 
individuals’  psychological  defenses  can 
lead  to  the  formation  of 
a  healthier,  happier,  and  more  productive  team.

Aim

This  narrative  review  aims  to  bridge  knowledge  gaps  and  update  practi-
tioners  about  prevalence  and  impact  of  burnout  syndrome.  In  addition,  the 
review  will  discuss  physiological  and  clinical  implications  of  commonly 
employed  meditation  interventions  there  by  offering  practical  insights  for 
the organizations.

Methods

This  narrative  review  summarizes  the  findings  of  peer-reviewed  research 
published  in  English  from  1990  to  2025.  We  searched  electronic  databases, 
including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, for pertinent 
information.  The  search  terms  encompassed  combinations  of  keywords 
related  to  the  following:  outcome  measures  (”burnout‘,  ’stress‘,  ’well-being‘, 
’attention‘,  ’empathy‘,  ’patient  care‘),  healthcare  provider  demographics 
(’healthcare  workers‘,  ’physicians‘,  ’nurses‘,  ’  ‘psychologists’  psychiatrist‘), 
and  meditation  methodologies  (’meditation‘,  ’mindfulness‘,  ’Transcendental 
Meditation”).

The  inclusion  criteria  comprised:  (1)  studies  focused  solely  on  healthcare 
professionals;  (2)  meditation-based  interventions;  (3)  assessments  of  mental 
health,  cognitive  function,  professional  performance,  or  physiological  out-
comes; and (4) study designs including observational studies, meta-analyses, 
systematic  reviews,  or  randomized  controlled  trials.  Studies  that  exclusively 
examined non-healthcare populations lacked specific intervention methods, 
did  not  provide  complete  articles,  and  were  produced  in  languages  other 
than English were rejected. We endeavored to identify common patterns of 
effects  and  the  degree  of  evidence  for  various  outcomes  while  acknowled-
ging  the  diversity  of  meditation  therapies  and  outcome  measures  among 
studies.  As  the  present  study  is  a  narrative  review,  does  not  include  human 
participants  directly,  and  utilizes  publically  accessible  sources,  institutional 
review board approval was not necessary.

Results

Burn  out as a syndrome in health care setting

Healthcare  systems  should  be  aware  of  the  elevated  rates  of  occupational 
burnout.  Healthcare  providers  experience  work-related  stress,  which  can 
result in anxiety, depression, burnout, and psychosomatic disorders, resulting 
in  a  decrease  in  quality  of  life  (Firth-Cozens  &  Greenhalgh,  1997).  ICD  11 
defines burnout as a syndrome caused by unmanaged chronic occupational 
stress, which can lead to tiredness, mental remoteness from work, negativity, 
cynicism,  and  decreased  professional  efficacy.  It  arises  from  a  mismatch 
between  employment  intentions  and  reality  and,  over  time,  may  go  unno-
ticed  by  the  affected  individual.  Yang  et  al  noted  increased  risk  of  mood 
disorders (anxiety, depression and physical illness (flu-like symptoms, insom-
nia and neck pain) (Yang & Hayes, 2020).

Self-perpetuating burnout often results from inadequate coping strategies 
with a significant economic impact of such conditions, as shown by data on 
absenteeism  and  turnover  (Jacobson  et  al.,  1996).  Healthcare  workers  face 
factors  such  as  increased  administrative  workload,  patient  suffering,  verbal

and physical abuse, workplace bullying, emotional repression, litigation risk, 
role conflicts, and organizational changes that can lead to distress and burn-
out (Michie & Williams, 2003). The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced addi-
tional  stressors  to  individuals  beyond  their  work  responsibilities,  such  as 
longer work hours, alterations in childcare and eldercare obligations, ethical 
dilemmas  related  to  providing  care  such  as  rationing,  and  a  certain  level  of 
existential  questioning,  potentially  compromising  their  overall  well-being 
due to underlying or new physical, mental, and social limitations.

Between  February  2019  and  December  2021,  almost  20,627  healthcare 
providers  participated  in  a survey of  approximately  120  healthcare  systems. 
The  survey  used  the  Mini  Z  work-life  measure  and  found  burnout  affecting 
over  60%  of  individuals,  with  over  40%  expressing  a  desire  to  quit  by  2021 
(Linzer et al., 2022). In a separate study involving 20,947 healthcare workers 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  respondents  from  42  companies,  38% 
reported  experiencing  anxiety  or  despair,  43%  experienced  job  overload, 
and  49%  indicated  burnout  (Prasad  et  al.,  2021).  A  study  evaluating  460 
mental  health  service  providers  (i.e.,  social  workers,  psychologists,  and  case 
managers with college, associate, or high school degrees presents a troubling 
picture regarding the levels of emotional exhaustion (EE) and other adverse 
work outcomes among American mental health workers (Acker, 2012). More 
than  half of  the  workers  (56%)  reported  moderate-to-high levels  of EE,  73% 
reported  moderate-to-high  levels  of  stress,  and  half  (50%)  considered  quit-
ting their jobs. A recent meta analysis noted the prevalence of EE around 40% 
(O’Connor et al., 2018).

The  WHO  on  Health  Workforce  (WHO,  2020)  indicates  that  an  additional 
18 million health workers are needed to achieve comprehensive and efficient 
delivery of health services that are essential for ensuring the well-being of all 
individuals. It is crucial to prioritize these professionals’ mental well-being to 
maintain  the  quality  of  patient  care,  particularly  considering  the  increasing 
demands of caring for aging populations. Workload management is a crucial 
factor  affecting  healthcare  professionals’  well-being  in  the  health  industry. 
The combination of being subjected to excessive job demands and having no 
control over one’s workload leads to a significantly elevated degree of stress 
and burnout. A strong correlation was observed between the ratio of patients 
to  nurses  and  the  occurrence  of  urinary  tract  infection  (0.86;  p = .02)  and 
surgical  site  infection  (0.93;  p = .04).  In  a  multivariate  model  that  accounted 
for patient severity and nurse and hospital characteristics, only nursing burn-
out was significantly associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections 
(0.82; p = .03) and surgical site infections (1.56; p < .01). Hospitals that experi-
enced a 30% reduction in burnout witnessed a significant decrease of 6,239 
infections, resulting in annual cost savings of up to $68 million (Cimiotti et al.,  
2012). Mitigating burnout among healthcare workers is a viable approach to 
effectively delivering healthcare.

Correlation  of meditation practice with physiological health

Many studies have revealed the physiological effects of meditation, demon-
strating  its  impact  on  stress  reduction,  cardiovascular  health,  immune  func-
tion,  brain  structure,  pain  management,  and  genetic  expression.  A  study 
(Chandran et al., 2021) by researchers at the University of Florida found that 
eight  days  of  intense  meditation  caused  robust  immune  system  activation. 
Inner  Engineering  practices  involving  simple  yoga  and  meditative  practices 
showed  increased  activity  of  220  genes  related  to  the  immune  response, 
including  68  genes  associated  with  interferon  signaling,  a  key  part  of  the 
body’s defense against viruses and cancer. Mindfulness meditation has been 
shown to increase the number of CD4+ T helper cells, which play a crucial role 
in  coordinating  immune  responses.  This  is  particularly  beneficial  for  indivi-
duals who are diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
(Black  &  Slavich,  2016).  Research  by  Richard  (Davidson  et  al.,  2003).  partici-
pants  in  an  eight-week  mindfulness  program  demonstrated  increased  anti-
body  production  after  receiving  a  flu  vaccine,  indicating  an  enhanced 
immune  response.  A  meta-analysis  of  the  effects  of  mindfulness  meditation 
on  immune  function  revealed  that  meditation  is  associated  with  increased 
activity of natural killer cells and a decrease in markers of inflammation, such 
as C-reactive protein (CRP). These findings indicate that meditation positively 
affects the maintenance of the body’s immune defense mechanisms, poten-
tially  through  stress  reduction  and  improved  overall  well-being  (de  Punder 
et al., 2019). Multiple studies have found that mindfulness meditation reduces 
the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway NF-kB activity and lowers circulating 
C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  levels,  an  inflammatory  marker.  These  reductions 
hold significant value because chronic inflammation is a precursor to various 
diseases (Black & Slavich, 2016). Mindfulness meditation has been associated 
with increased telomerase activity, which helps in protecting against cellular 
aging.  This  increase  in  telomerase  activity  is  important  for  reversing  the 
adverse  effects  of  immune  system  aging  (immunosenescence)  (Davidson 
et al., 2003; de Punder et al., 2019). Meditation is believed to enhance vagal 
tone  through  the  cholinergic  anti-inflammatory  pathway,  thereby  suppres-
sing the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreasing overall inflam-
mation in the body. Meditation has also been shown to reduce stress-induced 
production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. This reduction 
is particularly beneficial for individuals with chronic stress and depression, as 
elevated IL-6 levels are common in these conditions (Pavlov & Tracey, 2012).
Meditation  has  been  associated  with  improvements  in  cardiovascular 
health  as  well.  Regular  practice  of  static  meditation  has  been  linked  to 
decreased  levels  of  triglycerides  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  total  cholesterol 
levels.  This  study  suggested  meditation  as  a  noninvasive  supplement  to 
conventional  therapies,  offering  a  potentially  effective  way  to  improve 

COGENT MENTAL HEALTH

cardiovascular  health  (Antonelli  et  al.,  2024).  Another  study  (Loucks  et  al.,  
2015)  examined  the  effects  of  meditation  on  cardiovascular  risk  factors 
among middle-aged adults. Participants who engaged in a 12-week medita-
tion  program  showed  significant  reductions  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood 
pressures and improvements in heart rate variability, a marker of autonomic 
nervous system balance. These findings support the idea that meditation can 
induce  relaxation  and  counteract  sympathetic  nervous  system  overactivity. 
Meditation  is  widely  recognized  for  its  effectiveness  in  reducing  stress  and 
anxiety.

Researchers  have  observed  a  dramatic  decrease  in  stress  markers  such  as 
cortisol  and  inflammatory  cytokines,  suggesting  that  meditation  can  alter  the 
stress  response  system  (Hoge  et  al.,  2018).  Similar  findings  were  reported  by 
a  different  study  indicating  that  mindfulness  meditation  effectively  lowers  per-
ceived stress and improves emotional regulation (Khoury et al., 2015). Research 
has indicated that meditation can correct hormonal imbalances. Turakitwanakan 
et al. (2013) explored the effects of mindfulness meditation on hormone levels in 
healthy  adults.  The  findings  revealed  that  meditation  significantly  reduced  the 
levels  of  cortisol,  the  primary  stress  hormone,  and  increased  melatonin  levels, 
which regulate the sleep-wake cycle. These hormone adaptations likely improve 
meditation’s  comprehensive  stress-reducing  and  health-enhancing  effects. 
Meditation  boosts  neuroplasticity  and  the  brain’s  potential  for  remodeling  by 
generating new neural connections. MRI scans were used in a study that revealed 
that  individuals  who  practice  long-term  meditation  had  increased  gray  matter 
density  in  brain  regions  associated  with  learning,  memory,  and  emotional  reg-
ulation, such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.

These  structural  changes  suggest  that  meditation  can  enhance  cognitive 
functions,  including  attention,  memory,  and  executive  function  (Lazar  et  al.,  
2005). Meditation also plays a significant role in pain management. Zeidan et al. 
(2012)  demonstrated  that  mindfulness  meditation  reduced  pain  perception 
and  pain-related  brain  activity.  Mindfulness  meditation  participants  reported 
lower pain intensity and unpleasantness, correlating with decreased activity in 
the  primary  somatosensory  cortex  and  increased  activation  in  brain  regions 
associated with cognitive control and emotion regulation. Various studies have 
shown  that  meditation  also  impacts  the  gut-brain  axis  and  microbiome. 
Meditation  was  associated  with  increased  microbial  diversity  and  abundance 
of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These changes 
in the gut microbiome correlated with improvements in mood and reductions 
in anxiety symptoms, suggesting a potential mechanism for the mental health 
benefits of meditation (Jia et al., 2020).

Meditation has been shown to improve sleep quality. Ong et al. conducted 
a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of mindfulness medita-
tion  on  sleep  disturbance.  Participants  who  practiced  meditation  reported 
significant  improvements  in  sleep  quality,  including  reduced  sleep  latency 

8

V. FNU ET AL.

and  increased  total  sleep  duration.  This  study  also  found  reductions  in 
markers of physiological arousal, such as heart rate and sympathetic nervous 
system  activity,  which  are  often elevated  in  individuals  with  sleep  disorders 
(Ong  et  al.,  2014).  In  summary,  the  physiological  effects  of  meditation  are 
diverse  and  profound,  impacting  various  aspects  of  health  and  well-being. 
(Figure  1)  Meditation  offers  a  holistic  approach  to  enhancing  physical  and 
mental  health  through  stress  reduction,  improved  cardiovascular  health, 
enhanced  immune  function,  neuroplasticity,  pain  management,  epigenetic 
modifications,  gut-brain  axis  modulation,  improved  sleep  quality,  and  hor-
monal balance.

Meditation interventions in healthcare

MSBR is a psychoeducational approach designed by Kabat-Zinn in 1979. The 
program has a duration of eight weeks and consists of weekly lessons that are 
2.5 hours  long.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  specifically  assigned  “day  of  silence”

that  occurs  between  the  sixth  and  seventh  weeks.  Participants  were  taught 
several  meditation  techniques  that  they  practiced  in  class  and  in  daily  life. 
Studies using this program in healthcare professionals have reported reduced 
stress and emotional fatigue, improved life satisfaction and self-compassion, 
and  enhanced mood  (Galantino et  al.,  2005; Shapiro  et  al.,  2005).  In a  study 
examining the impact of a 12-week program called ‘Heartfulness Meditation, 
individuals who practiced meditation showed considerable  improvement in 
all aspects of burnout and almost all characteristics of emotional well-being. 
One  hundred forty-eight medical, surgical,  and primary care residents parti-
cipated  in  an  eight-week  MBSR  program.  The  therapy  involved  attending 
2.5-hour weekly sessions and one full day of silent meditation lasting 6 hours. 
There  was  no  discernible  disparity  in  emotional  fatigue  between  the  two 
groups.  However,  the  group  that  received  the  intervention  reported  signifi-
cantly more significant increases in personal accomplishments, worry, mind-
fulness abilities, self-compassion, and perspective-taking (empathy) (Verweij 
et al., 2018).

Bosch  et  al  2024  investigating  mindfulness  meditation  over  four 
weeks  among  nursing  participants  revealed  that  the 
intervention 
group  felt  more  competent  in  addressing  challenges  and  adopted 
a  more  balanced  perspective  on  life  situations  compared  to  the  control 
group.  A  separate  study  involving  nurses,  allied  healthcare  profes-
sionals,  and  physicians  indicated  that  a  6-week  trainer-guided  virtual 
Heartfulness  meditation  program  resulted  in  a  notable  enhancement  in 
workplace  burnout  and  vigor,  alongside  a  trend  towards  increased 
compassion  satisfaction  when  compared  to  gratitude  practices.  The 
stress  levels  dramatically  diminished  after  one  week  of  five-minute 
mindfulness  meditation  exercises  among  61  busy  mental  healthcare 
providers.  Participants  engaged  in  seven  days  of  five-minute  mindful-
ness  meditation  exercises  online,  intended  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  brief 
mindfulness  practices  in  diminishing  perceived  stress  levels  and  enhan-
cing  mindfulness,  characterized  by  heightened  attentiveness  to  the 
present  moment  in  a  purposeful  and  non-judgmental  manner  (Lam 
et  al.,  2015).

Recent meta analyses provide evidence that mindfulness-based interven-
tions  can  improve  the  well-being  of  healthcare  professionals  sooner  (Ong 
et  al.,  2024),  associated  with  meaningful  reductions  in  burnout,  resulting  in 
lower  scores  for  emotional  exhaustion  and  depersonalization  and  higher 
scores  for  personal  accomplishment  (Fendel  et  al.,  2021;  Suleiman-Martos 
et al., 2020).

Transcendental  Meditation  among  healthcare  professionals  resulted  in 
substantial  decreases  in  chronic  stress  in  a  study  conducted  at  Duke 
University (Joshi et al., 2022), and in a small cohort of emergency department 
physicians  exhibited  notable reductions  in burnout, as  well  as  symptoms  of 

10

depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances (Azizoddin et al., 2021). TM 
technique  seemingly  expedites  and  significantly  alleviates  symptoms  of 
healthcare professional burnout, insomnia, and psychological distress, while 
concurrently  enhancing  overall  well-being.  Notably,  these  substantial 
impacts  were  shown  as  early  as  two  weeks  post-test  for  all  outcome  mea-
sures, except for depersonalization and professional success. At three months 
post-baseline,  the  TM  group  exhibited  significant  reductions  (Nestor  et  al.,  
2023).

In  another  study  (Loiselle  et  al.,  2023),  TM  group  at  4 months  showed 
significant  improvements  in  total  burnout  (p = .020)  as  compared  to 
controls,  including  the  Maslach  Burnout  Inventory  dimensions  of  des-
pair  (p = .016),  personal  accomplishment  (p = .018),  and  emotional 
exhaustion  (p = .042).  In  baseline  interviews,  doctors  reported  the  typi-
cal  symptoms  of  despair  and  burnout.  People  who  used  the  TM  tech-
nique  on  a  regular  basis  reported  feeling  less  of  those  symptoms. 
Similar  alterations  were  not  reported  by  the  control  group.  More  stu-
dies  found  that  the  average  reduction  in  symptoms  was  62%  for 
anxiety,  58%  for  somatization,  50%  for  depression,  44%  for  insomnia, 
40%  for  emotional  exhaustion,  42%  for  depersonalization,  and  18%  for 
well-being  (all  p < 0.004)  at  3 months  (Nestor  et  al.,  2023).

Chen et al. showed LKM improved physicians’ empathy and communication 
(Chen 2021). A 10-minute LKM practice increases feelings of social connection 
and decreases self focus and thus could be a tool that could be applied with 
minimal time requirements (Seppala et al., 2014). Despite the small sample size, 
a  recent  study  on  Tele-yoga  showed  the  burnout  index,  PSQI,  anxiety,  and 
stress scores, and IL-6 and serum cortisol levels were significantly lower among 
the  tele-yoga  group  compared  to  the  control  group  participants  (p < 0.05) 
(Naveen et al., 2024).

Challenges & barriers

Some  of  the  potential  barriers  (Table  1)  for  implementation  include  time 
constraints,  organizational  culture  and  access  to  resources.  One  meta- 
analysis  found  that  the  dropout  rate  from  Mindfulness-Based  Interventions

(MBIs)  among  individuals  diagnosed  with  anxiety  or  depressive  disorders 
ranged  from  8%  to  37%,  with  a  median  dropout  rate  of  15.5%  (Strauss 
et al., 2014). Many individuals find it challenging to allocate time to engaging 
in daily mindfulness practice. The problems associated with propagating MBIs 
include a shortage of qualified mindfulness teachers, the financial burden on 
organizations that are hesitant to participate in group interventions, and the 
practical  difficulties  of  scheduling  courses  to  accommodate  work  needs 
(Wyatt  et  al.,  2014).  Some  hindrances  were  long  duration,  becoming  self- 
critical, and emerging negative thoughts. In contrast, prior knowledge, posi-
tive  predisposition,  motivation  to  reduce  stress,  increased  self-compassion, 
and belief in rationale were noted to be facilitators of interventions (Banerjee 
et al., 2017).

Educating initiatives, technology-based solutions, leadership support, brief 
mediation format can help facilitate implementation despite the challenges. 
A study employed Synctuition, an innovative audio mindful meditation soft-
ware,  to  take  participants  on  a  20-  to  30-minute  3D  audio  trip  to  relaxation 
over  30 days  using  binaural  beats  technology  and  relaxing  sounds  and  fre-
quencies. Using Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1994) (ranging 
from  0–40),  participants  in  general  reported  improvement  in  stress  (Prado 
et  al.,  2023).  As  part  of  their  Hello  Human  Compassion  campaign,  Dignity 
Health  introduced  “The  Reflective  Pause”  initiative,  encouraging  employees 
to  take  time  each  day  for  quiet  contemplation  to  benefit  themselves  and 
build  meaningful  relationships  with  peers  and  patients.  Dignity  Health 
recommends  taking  two  minutes  daily  to  “check  in”  with  yourself,  whether 
in the morning, during a work break, during a difficult time or in the evening. 
People are encouraged to ponder their relationships, employment, and daily 
life. Participants can share their daily mindfulness practice using #Take2Mins 
on social media (Minda, 2018).

Discussion

The  evidence  as  highlighted  above  suggests  that  meditation  offers 
substantial  benefits  for  healthcare  providers  across  multiple  domains. 
The  strongest  evidence  supports  meditation’s  effects  on  stress  reduc-
tion,  burnout  prevention,  emotional  regulation,  attention  enhancement, 
and  sleep  improvement.  Emerging  evidence  indicates  potential  benefits 
for  empathy,  immune  function,  cardiovascular  health,  and  possibly  error 
reduction,  though  these  areas  require  further  investigation.  MSBR  tech-
niques  have  been  employed  with  success  across  multiple  setups  and 
duration  have  been  modified  to  facilitate  ease  of  implementation.  TM 
has  demonstrated  particular  efficacy  for  burnout  reduction,  as  evi-
denced  by  the  2022  Duke  University  randomized  controlled  trial.  This 
finding  holds  special  relevance  given  the  high  prevalence  of  burnout

among  healthcare  providers  and  its  consequences  for  both  provider 
well-being  and  patient  care.  The  relatively  straightforward  nature  of 
TM  practice—20 minutes  twice  daily  of  silent  mantra  meditation—offers 
practical  advantages  for  implementation  in  healthcare  settings.

With  time,  more  web-based,  tele,  and  mobile  applications  are  being 
explored  to  improve  ease  of  use,  practicality,  and  compliance.  A  web- 
based  training  program  that  encompassed  15-minute  exercises  per  day, 
6 days  a  week,  for  6 weeks  improved  burnout  symptoms  in  practicing 
psychologists.  Mobile  meditation  applications  can  be  a  promising 
approach  to  expanding  access,  as  demonstrated  by  the  2023  study 
using  the  Synctuition  application.

Despite  growing  evidence  supporting  meditation’s  benefits  for 
healthcare  providers,  several  limitations  in  the  current  research  warrant 
consideration.  Because  of  the  variability  of  the  nature  of  the  meditation 
techniques,  methodological  heterogeneity  such  as  intervention  duration 
and  outcome  measures  varied  between  various  studies.  Selection  bias 
with  healthcare  providers  being  represented  within  certain  demo-
graphics  and  institutions  can  represent  overrepresentation  and  reduce 
generalizability.  Studies  lacked  long-term  follow-up,  so  sustained  out-
comes  could  not  be  assessed.  Certain  studies  might  have  been  over-
looked  because  of  the  narrative  nature  of  the  review.  The  studies  were 
included  without  assessing  their  methodological  rigor,  and  there  is  no 
statistical  summary  between  the  studies.

Future  research  should explore  assessing  studies with  practical and cost- 
effective  interventions,  objective  biomarkers,  healthcare  staff  outcome  stu-
dies,  and  more  technological  tools,  including  artificial  intelligence  applica-
tions. Healthcare providers and organizations should continue to implement 
evidence-based  approaches  to  incorporate  mediation  practices  to  improve 
stress management. Organization leaders and policymakers should prioritize 
mental health well-being to address burnout. Policy makers can aid in other 
aspects  such  as  value-based  payment  models  to  help  alleviate  the  stress  of 
seeing as many patients as quickly as possible, leveraging social workers and 
case  managers  to  screen  and  address  social  barriers  for  health  care  and 
reducing  the  burden  of  clerical  works  on  health  care  workers  (Khullar,  
2023).  More  programs  could  be  included  in  medical  education,  as  well  as 
continued  certification  requirements  to 
increase  awareness  among 
practitioners.

Conclusion

Modern  medicine  often  brings  challenges  to  healthcare  workers,  leading  to 
excessive  stress,  mental  distress,  psychiatric  issues,  and  burnout.  Mitigating 
burnout  among  healthcare  workers  is  a  viable  approach  to  effectively

delivering healthcare. Research has indicated that there is a decrease in stress, 
anxiety,  and  burnout  syndrome  in  healthcare  practitioners  who  engage  in 
daily meditation. Meditation physically and psychologically supports health-
care  personnel  through  relaxation  by  creating  a  protective  shield  against 
outside  stress  and  maintaining  empathy  and  compassion  for  patients.  In 
addition  to  psychological  benefits,  meditation  often  leads  to  a  decrease  in 
blood  pressure,  enhancement  of  immunological  responses,  and  an  overall 
decrease in inflammation. Various hospitals and healthcare institutions have 
implemented  meditation  daily,  and  numerous  studies  have  proven  its 
efficacy.

However, implementing meditation in care delivery settings is not without 
its  challenges,  especially  selection  bias  and  time  requirement  amidst  busy 
schedules. Enhanced organizational focus is needed to integrate meditation 
into  mainstream  healthcare  delivery  and  achieve  desired  psychological 
outcomes.
