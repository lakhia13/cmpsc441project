Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in amyloid-positive (Aβ+) indi-

viduals was proposed as a clinical indicator of Stage 2 in the Alzheimer’s disease

(AD) continuum, but this requires further validation across cultures, measures, and

recruitment strategies.

METHODS: Eight hundred twenty-one participants from SILCODE and DELCODE

cohorts, including normal controls (NC) and individuals with SCD recruited from the

community or from memory clinics, underwent neuropsychological assessments over

up to 6 years. Amyloid positivity was derived from positron emission tomography or

plasma biomarkers. Global cognitive change was analyzed using linear mixed-effects

models.

RESULTS: In the combined and stratified cohorts, Aβ+ participants with SCD showed
steeper cognitive decline or diminished practice effects compared with NC or Aβ− par-

ticipants with SCD. These findings were confirmed using different operationalizations

of SCD and amyloid positivity, and across different SCD recruitment settings.
DISCUSSION: Aβ+ individuals with SCD in German and Chinese populations showed

greater global cognitive decline and could be targeted for interventional trials.

Highlights
∙ SCD in amyloid-positive (Aβ+) participants predicts a steeper cognitive decline.
∙ This finding does not rely on specific SCD or amyloid operationalization.
∙ This finding is not specific to SCD patients recruited from memory clinics.
∙ This finding is valid in both German and Chinese populations.
∙ Aβ+ older adults with SCD could be a target population for interventional trials.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to the perception of a decline

METHODS

2.1

Study design

The Cross-Cultural Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline

(CLoCODE) project is a collaborative study that aims to establish

cross-cultural prediction models of SCD (see previously published
study design41). CLoCODE includes data from two multicenter

cohorts: the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE)
from China42 and the DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and
Dementia Study (DELCODE) from Germany.43

2.2

Participants

This study comprised 821 participants, including 341 SILCODE par-

ticipants and 480 DELCODE participants. All participants had normal

cognition at baseline, as measured by comprehensive clinical neu-

ropsychological test batteries consisting of standardized measures of

memory, language, and executive function. In SILCODE, normal cog-
nition was defined according to the Jak/Bondi criteria:44 participants

were excluded if (1) they had demographically adjusted impairments
(> 1 standard deviation [SD]) on two measures within at least one cog-

nitive domain (ie, memory, language, and executive function), if (2) they

had one impaired score in each of these cognitive domains, or if (3) they

had functional impairment as defined by a score of at least 9 on the

Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) (see Supplementary Mate-

rial). DELCODE participants were excluded when test scores in the

extended Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
(CERAD) neuropsychological test battery45 were less than −1.5 SD rel-

ative to age-, sex-, and education-adjusted normal performance on at

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review: We reviewed the literature and

cite publications exploring the association between sub-

jective cognitive decline (SCD), amyloid, and cognitive

decline throughout the manuscript. Cross-cultural stud-

ies are lacking, and the heterogeneity in SCD and amyloid

operationalizations needs to be explored.

2.

Interpretation: Our findings show that SCD combined

with amyloid positivity is associated with steeper cog-

nitive decline or fewer practice effects. Findings are (1)

globally found across two different cohorts, (2) con-

firmed using dimensional SCD (Everyday Cognition [Ecog]

scores), (3) replicated using amyloid status derived from
plasma Aβ42/40 ratio or amyloid-PET, and (4) not spe-

cific to SCD recruited from memory clinics but also found

in SCD from the community. SCD in amyloid-positive
(Aβ+) individuals may help to identify individuals at risk

for cognitive decline in German and Chinese populations,

regardless of the method used to detect them.

3. Future directions: Interventional clinical trials could use

scans or blood biomarkers (see Amyloid biomarkers section). Of these,

unimpaired (CU) participants were then classified into two distinct

groups based on the presence or absence of concerns associated with
a self-reported cognitive decline at baseline. Briefly, 272 NC (N = 124
in SILCODE and N = 148 in DELCODE) were recruited through stan-

dardized public advertisements for the absence of concerns/worries
as determined by telephone screening43 and/or response to the SCD
interview.46 A total of 549 SCD participants (presence of cognitive

complaints and concerns/worries) were recruited in both cohorts

Complementary to the categorical definition of the SCD population

(described earlier in the Participants section; ie, presence/absence of

cognitive complaints with associated concerns/worries), both cohorts

assessed SCD levels (ie, dimensional SCD) using the 12-item short form

of the Ecog. This questionnaire required participants to rate their abil-

ity to perform everyday tasks now compared to 10 years ago on a
4-point scale (from “no change” [1] to “consistently much worse” [4]).47

through referrals from general practitioners or memory clinics (both
memory clinic settings [SCDclin patients], N = 332 in DELCODE and
N = 78 in SILCODE), with a subset of 139 SILCODE SCD participants

Each question could also be answered with “I do not know,” which is

treated as a missing value in this questionnaire. The total Ecog score

was therefore calculated as the sum of all available items divided by

2.4

Amyloid biomarkers

Amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition was assessed for all participants in our
study using either amyloid-PET or the plasma Aβ42/40 ratio at base-

line, depending on data availability (described in what follows). In

the presence of amyloid-PET scans, these data were preferred over

plasma levels to determine amyloid positivity in the case of conflicting

results. This was done to reliably assess amyloid pathology in the most

comprehensive set of participants available.

All participants were divided into the following four groups: NC
amyloid-negative or positive (NC_Aβ− and NC_Aβ+) and SCD amyloid-
negative or positive (SCD_Aβ− and SCD_Aβ+). Briefly, there were 179
(21.8%) NC_Aβ−, 334 (40.68%) SCD_Aβ−, 93 (11.32%) NC_Aβ+, and
215 (26.18%) SCD_Aβ+ in the two combined cohorts (Table 1, with

cohort details in Table S1).

2.4.2

Plasma Aβ measurements

Procedures for plasma acquisition, processing, and analysis in
SILCODE42 and DELCODE43 were described previously and followed

standardized assessment protocols. Briefly, Meso Scale Diagnostics
(MSD) kits (V-PLEX Aβ Peptide Panel 1 [4G8] Kit, K15199E, Mesoscale

Diagnostics, Rockville, Maryland, USA) and Single-Molecule Array

(SIMOA, Neurology 4-PLEX E, Quanterix, USA) technology were used
in SILCODE to quantify plasma Aβ concentrations and stratify the
population according to the Aβ42/40 ratio threshold for amyloid
positivity (≤0.0145 for MSD63 and ≤0.0663 for SIMOA). Only MSD
(V-Plex Aβ Panel 1 [6E10] multiplex assay kit) was used in DELCODE
with a cutoff of ≤0.106.64 Thresholds for each assay were defined

with receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis using
amyloid-PET (SILCODE) or CSF Aβ42/40 (DELCODE) pathology as

the reference standard. In both studies, the area under the ROC curve
(AUC) for all plasma assays was >0.8 (SILCODE unpublished data) and,
thus, similar to the accuracy of plasma Aβ reported in other studies.31

In our study, 163 SILCODE participants (73 NC, 90 SCD) and 474

DELCODE participants (148 NC, 326 SCD) used the MSD method,

whereas 174 SILCODE participants used the SIMOA method (50 NC,

In our study, 82 (24.05%, NC and SCD) SILCODE participants under-

(TOF) scanner (Signa, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) at
XuanWu Hospital,42 and 84 (24.63%, NC and SCD) participants under-
went an 18F-D3FSP-PET scan (a deuterated 18F-florbetapir PET) on

a 3.0 T TOF scanner (GE Discovery 710, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA)

at Hainan General Hospital. For the amyloid-PET imaging, participants
were injected intravenously with either FBP42 or D3-FSP60 at 370
MBq (10 mCi ± 10%), rested for 45 min, and prepared for the scanning.

2.5

Statistical analysis

The main statistical analyses were executed in the combined CLoCODE

sample regrouping SILCODE and DELCODE participants according to

the combination of categorical SCD with amyloid positivity (ie, four
groups: NC_Aβ−, SCD_Aβ−, NC_Aβ+, SCD_Aβ+). Statistical analyses
were performed with statistical significance set at p < 0.05, using R

Overall, all groups showed increasing cognitive performance over time
except the SCD_Aβ+ group, which showed a slight decline (Est = −0.03,

of the demographic and clinical data are shown in Table 2. The mean
follow-up time was 3.23 ± 1.55 years. There were no baseline differ-

ences regarding age, sex, years of education, MMSE, and follow-up
time; there was only a trend for APOE ε4 carriers (p = 0.06, where
both SCDclin groups tend to have more APOE ε4 carriers than NC

groups).

No significant differences in baseline cognition were found between
the groups (p = 0.28; Model 5); however, a significant interaction
between time and groups was observed (p = 0.01; Figure 3). The
SCDclin_Aβ+ group showed a steeper cognitive decline than the other
groups (NC_Aβ−, p = 0.003; NC_Aβ+, p = 0.03; SCDcom_Aβ−, p = 0.02;
SCDclin_Aβ−, p = 0.003), except the SCDcom_Aβ+ group (p = 0.68).
The SCDcom_Aβ+ group only showed, or tended to show, a steeper
cognitive decline than the three Aβ− groups (NC_Aβ−, p = 0.03;
SCDcom_Aβ−, p = 0.08; SCDclin_Aβ−, p = 0.05), but not than the

CLoCODE analyses, and in each of the two cohorts separately, we
found that the SCD_Aβ+ group was the only one to consistently

show a steeper objective cognitive decline or fewer practice effects

over a follow-up period of up to 6 years, compared to the other
three groups (including the NC_Aβ+ group, which remained stable or

improved slightly). Findings were globally confirmed in analyses (1)

using the baseline Ecog score to assess dimensional SCD, (2) using
the baseline plasma Aβ42/40 ratio or amyloid-PET separately to

determine amyloid status, and (3) using different SCD recruitment

settings.

Our study first showed that the SCD_Aβ+ group, using amyloid-
PET or plasma Aβ42/40 ratio combined, presented minor cognitive
deficits at baseline compared to the other three groups (ie, SCD_Aβ−,
NC_Aβ+, NC_Aβ−). This replicated results from a past DELCODE study

analyses showed that the SCD_Aβ+ group was the only group showing

a steeper global cognitive decline over time (or fewer practice effects

in stratified analyses) compared to the other three groups. Conversely,
the NC_Aβ+ and SCD_Aβ− groups were not significantly different from
the NC_Aβ− reference group, with all three showing slight cognitive

improvements. It is noteworthy that diminished practice effects were
described previously in Aβ+ participants70–72 and may be another cog-

nitive feature of Stage 2 of the AD continuum, together with subtle
impairments measurable at a single time point.73 Thus, these practice

effects are increasingly viewed as an interesting measure of learning

in longitudinal studies. Our study suggests that amyloid does not sig-
nificantly reduce the practice effects in Stage 1 (as NC_Aβ+ did not
differ from NC_Aβ− in any analysis) but only in Stage 2, as indicated
by the SCD_Aβ+ group. This implies that learning and practice effects

In the first subanalysis, we replicated the main findings using dimen-

sional SCD (Ecog score) for all CU older adults, rather than stratifying

them according to the presence or absence of concerns/worries (ie,
categorical SCD). We showed that Aβ+ participants with higher base-

line Ecog scores experienced a steeper cognitive decline (or fewer

practice effects) over time. Therefore, our results suggest that using

baseline cognition between the six groups but showed that Aβ+ partic-
ipants with SCD (both SCDclin_Aβ+ and SCDcom_Aβ+) had a steeper

more marked in SCDclin patients (the only significant one when com-

particularly important in a context where the possibility of assessing

The main strengths of our study are as follows: (1) the large sam-

applies to Chinese populations as well. Our results contrast with the

reduced prevalence of amyloid positivity observed in the SILCODE

not allow us to test for differences between Stage 1 (ie, NC_Aβ+) and

Third, the impact of recruitment settings could only be tested in a sub-

sample of the SILCODE study, as DELCODE only included patients

and differences in SCD recruited in different settings require further

investigation and validation in larger sample sizes.
