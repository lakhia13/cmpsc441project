The teaching and learning 
of communication skills for social work students: 
a realist synthesis protocol
Emma Reith‑Hall* 

Abstract 
Background:  Good interpersonal communication is the cornerstone of social work practice, enhancing the out‑
comes of people in receipt of its services. Social workers’ communication skills are often identified as an area of con‑
cern. Communication skills can be developed and refined through training or education. The teaching and learning 
of communication skills is firmly embedded in many social work qualifying courses; however, considerable heteroge‑
neity exists regarding such complex interventions and the theoretical underpinnings of which have not been made 
explicit. Realist synthesis can help explain how, why, for whom and in what circumstances an intervention might 
work, which is an important first step for helping educators to tailor courses to meet the needs of different learner 
groups and, where applicable, the employing agencies and government departments who fund them.

Methods:  Realist synthesis is an interpretive, theory‑driven and explanatory approach that aims to explain the inter‑
play between the context, mechanisms and outcomes of interventions. This realist synthesis seeks to understand and 
explain to what extent, how, why, for whom and in what circumstances complex educational interventions aimed 
at teaching communication skills to social work students produces its effects. A five‑step process will be followed 
iteratively. In step 1, the initial programme theory will be developed. Step 2 will involve searching for evidence. In step 
3, selection and appraisal will take place. Step 4 requires data to be extracted and organised, and in step 5, data will be 
analysed and synthesised.

Discussion:  The teaching and learning of communication skills in social work education is under theorised. The 
findings from this realist synthesis aim to help policymakers and educators make informed decisions about the 
design and delivery of complex educational interventions aimed at improving the communication skills of social 
work students. The realist synthesis will be conducted and reported in accordance with the RAMESES guidelines and 
standards.

Background
There  is  considerable  consensus  within  the  literature 
that  good  interpersonal  communication  is  the  cor-
nerstone  of  social  work  practice  [1,  2],  enhancing  the 
outcomes  of  people  in  receipt  of  its  services  [3].  Seri-
ous case reviews and commissioned reports commonly 
identify  social  workers’  communication  as  an  area

of  concern.  Since  interpersonal  communication  is  a 
goal-driven  and  goal-directed  process  ‘undergirded  by 
perceptual, cognitive, affective, and behavioural opera-
tions’  [4],  communication  skills  can  be  developed  and 
refined through training or education. Communication 
skills  are  firmly  embedded  within  the  curriculum  of 
social work qualifying courses in a number of different 
countries including Australia, the UK and the USA [5–
7].  In  the  UK,  teaching  communication  skills  became 
mandatory  following  the  introduction  of  the  degree 
programme  20  years  ago  [8].  The  content,  sequencing 
and  pedagogy  underpinning  the  educational  interven-
tions  were  not  prescribed;  hence,  considerable  varia-
tion exists both within the UK and further afield.

Knowledge  and  practice  reviews  have  identified  that 
the outcomes evidence underpinning these interventions 
is  limited,  and  that  the  theoretical  underpinnings  of  the 
teaching  and  learning  of  communication  skills  have  not 
been  made  explicit  [9–11].  Some  time  has  passed  since 
these  reviews  were  undertaken,  during  which  consider-
able research activity has taken place and new routes into 
the profession have proliferated. In the UK, for example, 
Think  Ahead  and  Frontline  seek  to  recruit  high-achiev-
ing  graduates,  whilst  Step  Up  and  the  new  social  work 
apprenticeship degrees recruit experienced support staff 
into  undergraduate  programmes.  The  time  is  ripe  to 
revisit the literature on the teaching and learning of com-
munication skills in social work education to update our 
knowledge  so  that  policy  and  practice  decisions  can  be 
better informed.

To  address  the  first  gap  within  the  literature  —  the 
outcomes  evidence  —  a  systematic  review  aimed  at 
investigating  whether  or  not  the  teaching  and  learning 
of  communication  skills  is  effective  has  recently  been 
undertaken  [12,  13].  Notwithstanding  significant  meth-
odological  challenges,  there  was  overall  consistency  in 
the  direction  of  mean  change  for  the  development  of 
communication  skills  of  social  work  students  follow-
ing  training  [13].  To  address  the  second  gap  within  the 
literature  —  the  need  to  theorise  the  intervention  —  a 
broader  range  of  study  designs  is  required  which  can 
explain how and why interventions might work [14, 15]. 
Realist  synthesis  is  particularly  suited  to  this  purpose 
since programme theories help explain how the interven-
tion is supposed to work. Preliminary searching indicates 
that the body of evidence has grown in the last two dec-
ades, suggesting that fresh insights into the mechanisms 
underpinning  communication  skills  courses  in  social 
work  education  should  be  reinvestigated.  The  explana-
tion  a  realist  synthesis  can  provide  about  how,  why  and 
for  whom  an  intervention  might  work  is  an  important 
first step for helping educators tailor courses to meet the 
needs  of  different  learner  groups  and,  where  applicable, 

the  employing  agencies  and  government  departments 
who fund them.

Methodology
Realist synthesis

is  an 

interpretive, 

theory-driven 
Realist  synthesis 
approach  [16]  which  reviews  different  types  of  informa-
tion, evidence and literature about complex social inter-
ventions.  Methodological  inclusivity  and  pluralism  are 
encouraged. Realist synthesis applies a realist philosophy 
of  science,  that  is  an  external  (real  world)  reality  exists, 
but  this  can  only  be  understood  through  human  inter-
pretation (senses, language and culture) ‘to the synthesis 
of findings from primary studies’ ([15], p.93) that aims to 
explain  causation  within  interventions  through  context-
mechanism-outcome configurations.

The  realist  approach  recognises  that  no  theory  can 
always  explain  or  predict  the  outcomes  of  a  complex 
social intervention in every context. Whilst programmes 
provide  opportunities  and  resources,  the  outcomes  are 
ultimately  determined  by  the  choices  and  decisions  of 
its  participants.  Yet,  the  realist  approach  assumes  that 
because  only  a  limited  number  of  options  are  available 
in any given context, individuals are likely to, though will 
not always, make similar choices about the resources they 
use.  In  realist  terms,  these  semi-predictable  reoccurring 
patterns  of  behaviour  are  known  as  ‘demi-regularities’ 
[16].  Realist  synthesis  seeks  to  ‘uncover  the  underlying 
theories that explain these demi-regularities by critically 
scrutinising the interaction between context, mechanism 
and outcome in a sample of primary studies’ [17], which 
are  commonly  expressed  as  ‘context–mechanism–out-
come  configurations’  (‘CMOCs’).  Mechanisms,  defined 
as  ‘underlying  entities,  processes,  or  structures  which 
operate  in  particular  contexts  to  generate  outcomes  of 
interest’  [18],  are  a  defining  feature  of  realist  research. 
They  help  us  understand  that  it  is  not  the  intervention 
itself  which  produces  outcomes  but  people’s  reactions, 
reasoning and responses to it that are important.

In  realist  research,  the  relationship  between  context, 
mechanism  and  outcome  is  explored  through  a  varia-
tion  of  the  question,  ‘What  works,  for  whom,  in  what 
circumstances,  in  what  respects  and  why?’  From  this, 
‘the  reviewer  constructs  one  or  more  middle-range  the-
ories  to  account  for  the  findings’  ([15],  p.  94).  Through 
an  iterative  process,  realist  synthesis  seeks  ‘to  gradu-
ally  develop  and  refine  the  programme  theory  so  that 
it  is  more  detailed,  realist  in  nature  and  the  inferences 
within  it  are  supported  by  data’  [19].  In  later  stages  of 
the  inquiry,  following  a  series  of  different  iterations,  a 
number  of  C-M–O  configurations  are  developed  and 

Reith‑Hall  Systematic Reviews          (2022) 11:266

then  tested,  using  the  data  gathered  in  the  review.  The 
configurations  seek  to  explain  in  which  context(s)  and 
which  mechanism(s)  are  ‘triggered’  to  produce  which 
outcomes(s).  The  refined  realist  programme  theory 
should be in the ‘middle range’, that is it should be specific 
enough  to  permit  empirical  testing  but  abstract  enough 
to provide useful explanations transferable to other situa-
tions where the same mechanisms may be operating.

The  realist  approach  is  particularly  suited  to  educa-
tion  research,  where  multicomponent  interventions  are 
complex  and  outcomes  are  highly  context  dependent 
and  influenced  by  the  reactions,  responses  and  reason-
ing of both educators and learners. In relation to medical 
education, Wong et al. (2012, p. 90) [15] explain that ‘the 
impact of the “same” intervention will vary considerably 
depending on who delivers it, to which learners, in which 
circumstances and with which tools and techniques’. The 
same  point  can  be  made  about  social  work  education 
generally  and  the  teaching  and  learning  of  communica-
tion  skills  more  specifically.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  a 
realist  approach  was  deemed  appropriate  for  investigat-
ing this topic.

Objectives

The  intended  objectives  of  this  realist  synthesis  are  as 
follows:

1.  To  understand  and  explain  to  what  extent,  how, 
why,  for  whom  and  in  what  circumstances  the 
teaching  and  learning  of  communication  skills  for 
social  work  students  produces  its  effects.  Theory 
adjudication  (determining  which  theories  best 
explain  the  intervention)  and  cross-case  compari-
son (comparing how the intervention works for dif-
ferent groups or in different settings) will be inves-
tigated, provided sufficient detail is included within 
the primary studies.

2.  To  provide  recommendations,  based  on  the  above 
explanation,  and  to  help  educators  make  informed 
decisions  about  the  design  and  delivery  of  pedagogic 
practices.

Review questions

1.  To  what  extent  does  the  teaching  and  learning  of 
communication  skills  for  social  work  students  pro-
duce its intended outcomes?

2.  What formal substantive theories are used to inform 
the teaching and learning of communication skills for 
social work students?

3.  What are the mechanisms by which the teaching and 
learning  of  communication  skills  for  social  work  stu-
dents are believed to result in their intended outcomes?

4.  What  are  the  important  contexts  which  determine 
whether  the  different  mechanisms  produce  their 
intended outcomes?

5.  In  what  circumstances  are  such  interventions  likely 

to be effective?

These  questions,  deemed  important  by  key  stakehold-
ers,  will  be  iteratively  refined  once  the  exultant  litera-
ture  is  better  understood.  Whilst  question  1  has  been 
addressed  by  the  aforementioned  systematic  review  [12, 
13],  the  author  wonders  whether  additional  outcomes, 
and  a  greater  understanding  of  the  complexity  of  the 
intervention,  might  be  demonstrated  through  a  broader 
range  of  study  designs.  Questions  4  and  5  may  not  be 
answerable through existing studies and may need to be 
addressed subsequently, through realist evaluation.

Ethical considerations

Ethical  approval  was  not  required  for  this  synthesis 
because the literature is in the public domain.

Synthesis structure and features

The synthesis is informed by Pawson’s (2006) five stages 
(identifying  the  review  question,  searching  for  primary 
studies,  quality  appraisal,  extracting  the  data,  synthe-
sising  the  data  and  disseminating  the  findings)  [16].  An 
initial explanatory theory will be developed, after which 
the ‘programme theory’ will be tested and refined against 
data  from  empirical  studies.  A  visual  representation, 
informed  by  Duddy  and  Wong’s  (2018)  depiction  [20], 
which  outlines  the  approach  underpinning  this  realist 
synthesis, is provided in Fig. 1 below.

Planning and preparation

Background reading  As a researcher, who is also an aca-
demic in the field, I regularly read and review the litera-
ture for teaching, research and other scholarly purposes 
to  ensure  that  my  content  knowledge  and  expertise  are 
current  and  relevant.  Through  sustained  immersion, 
familiarisation with the literature was already well estab-
lished before this particular research project began.

Identifying  and  involving  stakeholders  Citing  Ryan  and 
Hood  (2004)  [21]  and  Schwandt  (2005)  [22],  Suri  and 
Clarke (2009) [14] suggest that ‘the knowledge construc-
tion  of  educational  practices  can  be  considered  incom-
plete  and  oppressive  if  it  undermines  the  rich  knowl-
edge  of  different  stakeholders,  especially  teachers  and 
students,  whose  practices  and  experiences  are  the  sites 
for  educational  research’  (p.  412).  In  realist  research, 
identifying  and  involving  stakeholders  is  encouraged 
from  the  outset.  In  addition  to  policymakers,  the  key

stakeholders  involved  in  social  work  education  are  stu-
dents,  academics,  practitioners,  and  people  with  lived 
experience  (sometimes  referred  to  as  service  users  and 
carers). My commitment to, and experience of, collabora-
tion and partnership working [23–25] supports my abil-
ity to work with different stakeholder groups, using their 
‘lived  experience’  and/or  content  expertise  to  focus  the 
review  and  inform  the  development  and  refinement  of 
the programme theory. Deviating slightly from the more 
established  practice  of  bringing  different  stakeholder 
groups together, I have met different stakeholder groups 
separately.  This  was  partly  to  ensure  that  the  voices  of 
more  powerful  groups  do  not  become  privileged  above 
less powerful groups and also for more practical reasons 
—  getting  everyone  together  in  one  place  has  not  been 
feasible when there is no funding available to reimburse 
expenses  and  was  not  deemed  responsible  in  light  of  a 
global  pandemic  given  the  existing  health  conditions  of 
some  collaborators.  Using  a  reflexive  approach,  I,  as  the 
researcher,  will  consider  whether  this  strategy  needs  to 
be adapted as the research project progresses. Stakehold-
ers  will  be  involved  throughout  the  research  process,  as 
shown in Fig. 1.

Step 1 — Develop the initial programme theory

Realist  inquiry  begins  (and  ends)  with  a  programme 
theory  [20].  The  initial  programme  theory  tends  to 
operationalise  a  set  of  assumptions  of  the  programme 

designers about how the programme is expected to work. 
Preliminary  literature  searches  and  stakeholder  con-
sultations  allow  the  programme  theory  to  be  iteratively 
developed and help determine the priorities of the realist 
synthesis. Discussions with stakeholders have influenced 
the nature and form of this realist synthesis. For example, 
the  lack  of  a  coherent  theoretical  framework  to  inform 
the  teaching  and  learning  of  communication  skills  [9]  is 
an issue of particular interest for social work academics, 
which  influenced  the  decision  to  place  more  emphasis 
on  identifying  candidate  substantive  theories  within  the 
literature.  Formal  substantive  theories  ‘provide  a  bridge 
to  a  wealth  of  existing  research  and  knowledge  about  a 
topic’  and  operate  at  a  higher  level  of  abstraction  than 
programme theories [26].

Preliminary searches

A series of preliminary scoping searches aimed at retriev-
ing  substantive  theories  from  the  literature  have  been 
undertaken. The first of the preliminary searches entailed 
searching  the  Social  Care  Institute  of  Excellence  (SCIE) 
website for any grey literature sources by selecting ‘com-
munication  skills’  from  the  subject  topic  menu  of  the 
resources  and  services  section.  Two  more  structured 
searches  were  also  undertaken:  a  database  search  of  the 
Web of Science and a discipline-specific journal search of 
Social Work Education, the British Journal of Social Work 
and  the  Journal  of  Social  Work  Education.  The  searches 

Reith‑Hall  Systematic Reviews          (2022) 11:266 

Page 5 of 12

were  guided  by  the  BeHEMoTh  (behaviour  of  interest, 
health context, exclusions, model, theory) approach [27], 
using  various  terms  to  describe  the  behaviour  of  inter-
est  (communication/interpersonal),  adapting  the  health 
context  (social  work  education)  alongside  the  suggested 
terms  for  theory  or  model  (theor*/model*/framework*, 
concept*).  No  exclusions  were  applied,  and  the  theory 
concepts  were  not  restricted  to  title  and  abstract  as  it 
was anticipated that information about theories might be 
located in the main text and reference lists.

The combined searches produced a total of 39 records. 
Ten  grey  literature  resources  were  retrieved  from  the 
SCIE  website,  including  the  aforementioned  knowledge 
reviews.  Six  records  were  retrieved  through  the  web  of 
science  search  and  twenty-three  through  the  discipline-
specific  journal  search  (4  from  Social  Work  Education, 
6  from  the  British  Journal  of  Social  Work  and  13  from 
the  Journal  of  Social  Work  Education).  Each  record  was 
added to an EndNote group folder. Fifteen records were 
excluded  for  the  following  reasons:  duplication  (N = 1), 
the record was a book review (N = 4), the topic was not 
about the teaching and learning of communication skills 
(N = 6) and the population did not comprise social work 
students (N = 4). The remaining 24 records were read in 
full. A PRISMA flow diagram of the preliminary searches 
is depicted in Fig. 2.

Reference and citation tracking

undertaken  manually  and  using  Google  Scholar,  which 
led to the identification of two additional records.

Discussions with stakeholders

Following  the  preliminary  searches,  discussions  with 
stakeholders  took  place  regarding  substantive  theories. 
Contact  was  made  with  social  work  academics  involved 
in  the  teaching  and/or  researching  of  communication 
skills.  Their  content  expertise  confirmed  that  relevant 
candidate theories had been identified.

Substantive theories

The  key  substantive  theories  underpinning  the  teaching 
and learning of communication skills which were explic-
itly referred to in the literature found through the theory 
search outlined above are included below:

•  Experiential learning theory
•  Reflective practice
•  Adult learning theory
•  Theory of living human systems
•  Relational/cultural theory
•  The postmodern and post-structural approach
•  Task-centred and behavioural approaches
•  Humanistic/person-centred  counselling  approaches, 

including microskills training

•  Psychosocial theory

Recognising  that  theory  might  be  contained  within 
a  sibling  paper,  reference  and  citation  tracking  were 

Experiential  learning  theory  and  humanistic  person-
centred  approaches  were  most  frequently  mentioned  in

the  studies  identified  through  the  theory  search,  a  find-
ing  supported  by  a  recent  systematic  review  [13].  Expe-
riential  learning  theory  synthesises  the  contribution 
of  scholars,  including  educational  psychologists  and 
philosophers,  who  positioned  experience  as  playing  a 
fundamental  role  in  learning,  training  and  educational 
development  of  adult  learners  who  bring  their  personal 
and  professional  experiences  with  them.  Experiential 
learning  involves  learning  by  experience,  in  which  the 
learner takes on an active role, followed by reflection and 
analysis of that experience, which further develops their 
learning.

Kolb’s  (1984)  experiential  learning  cycle  [28]  was  the 
most  frequently  cited  reference  to  theory  in  the  records 
identified through the preliminary searches, followed by 
Donald  Schön’s  (1983)  [29]  work  on  reflective  practice 
and  Knowles’  (1978)  [30]  adult  learning  theory.  These 
theories are associated with a constructivist view of edu-
cation, ideas that can be traced back to John Dewey.

Ivey  and  Authier’s  (1971,  1978)  [31,  32]  microskills 
approach  provides  a  systematic  method  for  teach-
ing  beginning  communication  skills  to  counsellors  and 
therapists.  It  shares  similarities  with  the  above  theo-
ries,  although  its  roots  lie  in  psychotherapy,  particularly 
in  humanistic  person-centred  counselling  approaches, 
developed  by  Carl  Rogers  (1951,  1961)  [33,  34].  The 
other  theories  were  mentioned  in  just  one  study.  These 
included  Agazarian’s  (1997)  system-centred  therapy  for 
groups [35], Miller and Stiver’s (1997) ‘relational/cultural 
theory’ [36] and Jessup and Rogerson’s (1999) postmod-
ern  and  post-structural  approach  [37].  A  brief  overview 
of the substantive theories identified through the prelimi-
nary searches are provided in Table 1.

The  theories  are  not  mutually  exclusive,  and  there 
is  significant  overlap  between  them.  The  role  of  the 
substantive  theories  will  be  considered  in  the  realist 
synthesis.

Development of programme theory

From  the  combined  preliminary  searches  and  discus-
sions with stakeholders, an initial programme theory was 
developed.

A  wide  range  of  teaching  and  learning  activities  were 
identified,  which  involved  combining  formal  input  (on 
theory  or  background)  from  an  instructor  with  experi-
ential  or  practice-based  activities  such  as  group  exer-
cises,  group  discussions,  role-plays,  simulations  and 
skills  laboratories,  video  work,  observation,  feedback 
and  reflection.  Service  user  and  carer  involvement  and 
shadowing  experienced  social  workers  in  practice  were 
also identified within the literature identified through the 
preliminary  searches.  The  different  activities  and  com-
ponents  that  communication  skills  courses  comprise 

contributed to a ‘theory of action’. Some of the resources 
also  described  how  the  intervention  is  thought  to  work. 
Pedagogic  methods  that  encouraged  learning  by  doing 
and reflection were common, explaining why assessment, 
evaluation,  feedback  and  reinforcement  were  frequently 
commented on in the literature.

In  terms  of  the  intended  programme  outcomes,  the 
studies  referred  to  confidence  [43,  44]  and  interpersonal 
communication skills [45]. Knowledge and attitudes were 
also  mentioned  within  the  domains  of  ‘knowing’  and 
‘being’ [46]. Discussions with different stakeholder groups 
consulted  during  the  development  of  the  systematic 
review  protocol  suggested  that  self-efficacy,  knowledge, 
attitudes and skills were the outcomes of importance [12, 
13]  and  are  captured  within  Carpenter’s  (2005)  frame-
work for social work educational outcomes [47].

Pawson (2006, p. 74) [16] suggests that the initial rough 
theory should contain some key features of realist expla-
nation, comprising ‘conjectures on the generative mecha-
nisms  that  change  behaviour,  ideas  on  the  contexts  that 
influence  its  operation,  and  hunches  about  the  differ-
ent  outcome  patterns  that  ensue’.  Successful  outcomes 
appeared  to  be  dependent  upon  students  engaging  in 
‘learning  by  doing’  and  ‘learning  through  reflection’,  ten-
ets  which  are  supported  by  two  of  the  substantive  theo-
ries (experiential learning theory and reflective practice). 
A safe learning environment was deemed to be an impor-
tant context for the learning by doing component to take 
place. Figure 3 shows the initial rough programme theory.
From  the  studies  identified  through  the  preliminary 
search and discussions with stakeholders (students, peo-
ple  with  lived  experience  and  social  work  academics),  it 
was  also  possible  to  identify  some  tentative  and  provi-
sional  context-mechanism-outcome  configurations,  as 
stated  below,  where  C = context,  M = mechanism  and 
O = outcome.

1.  In  a  safe  learning  environment  [C],  students  will 
experience  a  sense  of  trust  [M]  and  manage  perfor-
mance-related anxiety, fear and embarrassment [M], 
enabling  them  to  engage  [M]  in  practice  opportuni-
ties to improve their communication skills [O].

2.  Students  are  more  likely  to  demonstrate  effective 
communication  skills  [O]  when  practice  scenar-
ios  are  authentic  [C]  because  they  perceive  it  to  be 
believable  [M]  and/or  useful  [M],  which  motivates 
them [M] to perform well.

Table 1  Overview of substantive theories

Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning theory

Rooted in the intellectual traditions of social psychology, philosophy and cognitive psychology, Kolb saw learning as the process, whereby knowledge 
is created through the transformation of experience. Kolb’s theory of experiential learning proposes that people learn best when they are engaged in 
first‑hand experiences which can then be reflected on to inform future practice. Reflection, a key instrument in experiential learning, was identified 
by Kolb as one of the mechanisms through which experience could be transformed into knowledge, skills and attitudes. Experiential learning theory 
encourages educators to create learning experiences which are sequential, progressively developmental and provide learners with opportunities to 
reflect on their experiences

Schön’s (1983) reflective practitioner

Schön (1983) viewed self‑reflection as a vehicle for learning and improvement. He distinguished between reflection in action and reflection on action. 
He observed that professionals reflect in action by applying their knowledge within any given situation and then adjusting their practice accordingly. 
Practitioners use hindsight to reflect on action, thinking through how they could improve future practice. These processes enable practitioners to 
master increasingly complex, uncertain and challenging situations

Knowles’ (1978) adult learning theory

Knowles’ (1978) adult learning theory takes account of the vast amount of practical experience which adult learners possess. Self‑concept, the role of 
experience, readiness to learn, orientation for learning, internal motivation and understanding why knowledge is required are important concepts in 
adult education. Developing the idea of andragogy — the art and science of helping adults to learn — adult learning theory highlights the importance 
of creating a learning environment which enables adults to feel accepted, respected and supported. A spirit of mutuality and trust between students 
and facilitators as joint enquirers is deemed helpful for adult learners

Humanistic/person-centred counselling approaches, including microskills training

Person‑centred counselling and interviewing draw on ideas from humanistic psychology which proposes that human beings have the potential to 
overcome distress and work towards self‑actualisation within the context of a facilitative helping relationship. Carl Rogers (1951, 1961) introduced core 
conditions of helping relationships which included the demonstration of congruence, empathy and positive regard
Specific models which derive from person‑centred approaches include the following:
• The microskills approach (Ivey and Authier, 1978) [31, 32]
• The human relations training model Carkhuff and Truax (1965) [38] and Carkhuff (1969) [39]
• The skilled helper model (Egan, 2021) [40]

Communication theory

Communication theory, influenced by systems thinking, looks at how information is exchanged, including how messages are conveyed, received and 
acted upon

Task-centred and behavioural approaches

Task‑centred and behavioural approaches to skills acquisition provide systematic opportunities for the development of basic skills including students 
interviewing each other or service‑user educators within workshops and skills labs [41]

Psychosocial approaches

Influenced by Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, psychosocial approaches consider how concepts such as internal mental processes (the ‘psyche’), group 
dynamics and ‘use of self’ impact on communication

Agazarian’s (1997) system-centred therapy for groups

According to Koprowska (2003, 296) [42], system‑centred therapy ‘deliberately structures group norms in order to reduce restraining forces and increase 
driving forces’. The part played by ‘predictable defences’ needs to be ‘undone’ so that new information can be integrated in ways that enable students to 
‘move away from personal preoccupations toward a process of professional discovery’ (Koprowska, 2003, 306) [42]

Miller and Stiver’s (1997) ‘relational/cultural theory’

Based on the work of Jean Baker Miller and Janet Stiver, ‘relational/cultural theory’ suggests that ‘how students are taught will influence what they learn, 
and that this in turn will influence how they use this knowledge and understanding in practice’ [9]. In the context of social work education, the ideas 
of mutual engagement, mutual empathy and mutual empowerment are just as important in the student–teacher relationship as they are in the client‑
worker relationship

Jessup and Rogerson’s (1999) postmodern and post-structural approach

Described as a discourse and practice, the postmodern and post‑structural approach argues that interpersonal communication in social work must 
integrate personal and socio‑structural domains. The teaching and practising of interpersonal communication skills are located within a political 
context

4.  In a ‘containing’ and attuned reflective space [C], stu-
dents will make sense of their own internal worlds and 
those  of  others  [M],  developing  self-awareness  [O], 
use of self [O] and emotional capacity [O] to commu-
nicate effectively within the helping process [O].

Elements  of  the  first  three  CMOCs  featured  repeat-
edly in the studies. A microskills approach underpinned 

by  humanistic/person-centred  counselling,  behavioural 
psychology  and  experiential  learning  theory  appears  to 
underpin  various  different  participative  teaching  and 
learning  activities,  whereby  skills  are  practised,  evalu-
ated  and  reflected  on  and  then  reinforced  through  fur-
ther  practice.  The  fourth  CMOC,  underpinned  by  a 
psychosocial  approach,  appeared  to  operate  at  a  deeper 
level  and  considered  how  understanding  and  using  ‘the 

 Reith‑Hall  Systematic Reviews          (2022) 11:266

self ’ develops in relationships with others. Although this 
CMOC  was  most  evident  in  the  literature  about  com-
municating with children and young people and referred 
to  some  very  specific  activities  including  tutor  model-
ling,  child  observation  and  reflective  groupwork,  it  was 
possible to glean from the more generic studies that this 
CMOC  would  also  operate  in  learning  how  to  commu-
nicate  with  adults.  This  idea  will  be  tested  in  the  realist 
synthesis.

Themes relating to power and control also emerged in 
the studies reviewed for the preliminary search. The role 
of service user and carer involvement in social work edu-
cation  was  highlighted  in  some  of  the  studies,  whereas 
others  considered  the  importance  of  students  feeling  in 
control of their learning. Although it was not possible to 
develop a relevant  CMOC, this may become  possible in 
the review of the wider body of literature located through 
the main search.

The purpose of realist research is to ‘gradually develop 
and  refine  the  programme  theory  so  that  it  is  more 
detailed, realist in nature and the inferences within it are 
supported  by  data’  (Wong,  2015,  p.  2)  [19].  To  support 
this endeavour, the initial programme theory will be fur-
ther developed and refined through the subsequent steps 
in  the  approach  underpinning  this  realist  synthesis,  as 
shown in Fig. 1.

Step 2 — Searching for evidence

The  main  systematic  search  of  the  literature  aimed  at 
identifying  relevant  documents  and  articles  from  which 
the programme theory will be developed and tested takes 
place in step 2. Academics, service users and carers, stu-
dents  and  practitioners  have  been  asked  for  suggestions 
for key words for the intervention, programme recipients 
and  intended  outcomes.  An  information  specialist  has 

helped the researcher formulate the search string for this 
particular search (based on population and intervention 
concepts  only)  using  a  combination  of  subject  headings 
and free text, adapted for each database. The basic search 
string is as follows:

(“social work student*” OR “student social worker*”)
AND
(communicat* OR interpersonal OR interview*)
AND
(train*  OR  educat*  OR  teach*  OR  learn*  OR  curri-
cul*)

Study  design  and  features  will  not  form  part  of  the 
search  criteria  of  the  realist  synthesis  since  ‘nuggets’ 
of  information  [48]  can  be  gleaned  from  quantitative, 
qualitative  and  mixed  methods  research  as  well  as  pol-
icy documents, opinion pieces and other grey literature. 
Social  science  and  education  databases  are  less  well 
indexed than those used in medicine and health sciences, 
so  a  comprehensive  and  inclusive  search  has  been  con-
structed.  The  databases  and  platforms  comprising  the 
formal search are as follows:

a)  Education Abstracts (EBSCO)
b)  ERIC (EBSCO)
c)  MEDLINE (OVID)
d)  PsycINFO (OVID)
e)  Web  of  Science  Database  Social  Science  Citation 

Index

f )  Social Services Abstracts (ProQuest)
g)  ASSIA  Applied  Social  Sciences  Index  and  Abstracts 

(ProQuest)

h)  ClinicalTrials.gov
i)  Database of abstracts of reviews of effectiveness

k)  Cochrane Collaboration Library
l)  Evidence for Policy Practice Information and Coordi-

nating Centre (EPPI‐Centre)

m) Google  Scholar  —  using  a  series  of  searches  and 
screening the first 5 pages of results for each search

n)  ProQuest Dissertations and Theses

Study selection will not be restricted by language, pub-

lication date or publication status.

To  supplement  the  systematic  search,  more  emergent 
techniques of reference and citation tracking will be used, 
alongside  contacting  content  experts  (leading  authors 
and researchers in the field) who will be asked to recom-
mend additional empirical studies or other relevant grey 
literature.

Documents will be screened by title and abstract (and 
full  text  if  required)  by  the  researcher  and  co-reviewer. 
Discrepancies will be discussed, and a consensus reached, 
involving other stakeholders if required.

Background  searching  has  revealed  that  studies  tend 
to  focus  on  one  small  aspect  of  the  anticipated  initial 
programme  theory;  therefore,  inclusion  criteria  will 
be  broad,  typically  containing  information  about  the 
following:

•  Theories (substantive or informal) relevant to learn-

ing and teaching communication skills

•  Intervention components, e.g. videoing and feedback
•  Outcomes (including proximal outcomes) — knowl-
edge, attitudes and values, self-efficacy and skills
•  Different student groups, e.g. undergraduate or post-

graduate students

•  Information  about  the  learning  environment  and/or 
relationships including the role of tutors and peers

Exclusion criteria include the following:

•  Records that do not relate to an empirical study about 
a relevant intervention for the teaching and learning 
of communication skills

•  Studies  that  are  not  about  students  on  social  work 

qualifying courses

•  Studies  that  focus  on  learning  in  placements/practi-

cums only

It  is  expected  that  a  series  of  additional  searches  will 
take place during the later stages of the review, particu-
larly  as  gaps  in  the  literature  ascertained  through  the 
main systematic literature search are identified. Different 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will  apply,  and  these  will  be 
devised iteratively with support from an information spe-
cialist.  Literature  from  counselling  training  and  medical 

education  is  not  currently  the  focus  of  this  review  but 
may  be  drawn  upon  later,  to  elucidate  further  informa-
tion about how particular intervention components work 
or to explore where similar mechanisms are in operation. 
Refinements  to  the  programme  theory  will  inform  the 
nature  of  these  additional  searches  and  will  be  reported 
in full in the project write-up. The results of each search 
will be presented using PRISMA style flow diagrams.

Step 3 — Selection and appraisal

The  researcher  will  review  all  of  the  documents  that 
meet inclusion criteria during screening, assessing them 
against the two criteria of the following:

•  Relevance (i.e. whether there is any information con-
tained  within  the  documents  which  can  be  used  to 
support, refute or refine the programme theory)
•  Rigour (i.e. whether the data is trustworthy — or not)

Rigour  can  be  difficult  to  apply  in  realist  research 
because it is the ‘nugget’ of information [48] which needs 
to  be  assessed  rather  than  the  methodological  qual-
ity  of  the  whole  study.  For  example,  a  methodologically 
weak study is less problematic if the relevant section for 
the  review  is  simply  a  description  of  the  programme’s 
components  compared  to  using  the  findings  of  a  study 
where  the  internal  validity  is  questionable.  Recognising 
that  ‘different  types  of  data  will  be  subject  to  different 
judgements  of  methodological  coherence  and  plausibil-
ity’,  Duddy  and  Wong  (2018)  recommend  recording  the 
assessment of each piece of information [20]. This is the 
approach that will be adopted here to provide a clear and 
transparent audit trail. Identifying more than one source 
of data relevant to a programme theory is another strat-
egy suggested by Wong (2018) [49] which will be adhered 
to  at  this  stage,  to  enhance  trustworthiness.  The  focus 
will be on finding sufficient data that is relevant, coherent 
and  supports  the  aim  of  developing  programme  theory. 
It is intended that student social workers undertaking an 
evidence-based  practice  module  will  be  involved  in  the 
selection  and  quality  appraisal  process,  which  will  also 
be overseen and supported by the PhD supervisory team.

Step 4 — Extracting and organising data

All of the documents from every search will be uploaded 
into  the  EndNote  reference  manager  software.  Docu-
ments  which  meet  the  inclusion  criteria  will  be  cop-
ied  into  a  separate  group  folder,  into  which  the  full-text 
PDF  files  will  be  uploaded.  The  researcher  will  extract 
the  main  characteristics  from  each  document  in  the 
included  study  group,  using  a  data  extraction  template. 
Data  from  each  document  will  be  coded  according  to 
the  contribution  it  makes  to  the  developing  programme 

 Reith‑Hall  Systematic Reviews          (2022) 11:266 

Page 10 of 12

theory. Initially, data will be organised into broad ‘bucket 
codes’, based on the initial programme theory. The realist 
logic  of  analysis  developed  by  Pawson  and  Tilley  (1997) 
[50] will then be applied. As the data extraction process 
continues,  and  the  programme  theory  is  gradually  and 
iteratively refined, the data will be recoded and organised 
into potential C-M–O configurations. The use of data to 
refine  programme  theory  will  be  recorded  and  reported 
in the project write up. A 10% random subsample of doc-
uments will be checked by a second reviewer. Again, dis-
crepancies will be discussed and brought to the attention 
of an academic acting as an independent adjudicator.

Step 5 — Analyse and synthesise data

Realist  analysis  and  synthesis  entail  ‘juxtaposing,  adju-
dicating,  reconciling,  consolidating  and  situating  the 
evidence’  [16],  with  a  view  to  refining  the  programme 
theory.  In  realist  synthesis,  the  analysis  and  synthesis  of 
the selected data in step 5 occur concurrently with data 
selection and appraisal in step 3 and data extraction and 
organisation  in  step  4.  Through  inductive  and  deduc-
tive  reasoning,  the  researcher  will  move  back  and  forth 
between  the  steps,  using  the  data  to  build  and  test  the 
CMOCs,  iteratively  refining  the  programme  theory,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  1.  Additional  searches  will  be  conducted 
as  gaps  in  the  literature  materialise  or  where  other  dis-
ciplines can inform our understanding of how particular 
mechanisms  might  operate.  Stakeholders  will  be  con-
sulted  about  the  development  and  refinement  of  pro-
gramme theory, hopefully adding their own insights and 
amendments  as  they  see  fit.  Retroductive  reasoning  will 
be  used  in  the  later  stages,  allowing  the  refinements  to 
programme theory to be ‘made on the basis of what can 
plausibly  be  inferred  by  all  the  data  available’  [20].  The 
final  synthesis  will  provide  an  overview  of  some  of  the 
underlying causal mechanisms which are fired in specific 
contexts to produce particular patterns of outcomes.

Dissemination

The dissemination strategy will be developed with stake-
holder involvement. Findings will be translated into evi-
dence-based  recommendations  that  can  be  shared  with 
and  applied  by  policymakers  and  educators.  Findings 
will  also  be  made  available  to  students  and  experts  by 
experience.

Discussion
The  teaching  and  learning  of  communication  skills  in 
social  work  education  is  under  theorised.  This  real-
ist  synthesis  will  provide  theory-based  explanations  to 
determine  to  what  extent  the  teaching  and  learning  of 

communication skills in social work education work and 
for  whom,  how,  why  and  in  what  circumstances.  The 
findings from this realist synthesis will help policymakers 
and educators make informed decisions about the design 
and delivery of complex educational interventions aimed 
at  improving  the  communication  skills  of  social  work 
students.

One  limitation  of  this  realist  synthesis  is  that  it  is 
being undertaken by a PhD student with no recourse to 
funding  stakeholder  involvement  activities.  Although 
undergradute  students  may  readily  take  up  the  screen-
ing  opportunities,  resource  constraints  will  inevitably 
have  an  impact  on  the  extent  to  which  stakeholder  col-
laboration  evolves.  The  PhD  student’s  supervisory  team 
has content and methodological expertise, including con-
ducting  systematic  reviews  and  realist  syntheses.  Their 
involvement will add further rigour to the conduct of this 
research.

Another  limitation  concerns  the  state  of  the  extant 
literature.  Although  there  is  a  reasonable  body  of  litera-
ture  about  the  teaching  and  learning  of  communication 
skills  in  social  work  education,  it  is  possible  that  there 
are  gaps,  particularly  in  terms  of  outcomes  and  contex-
tual factors, which means some of the research questions 
might be unanswerable. A comprehensive search will be 
undertaken  with  citation  and  reference  harvesting  seek-
ing to locate sibling and kinship papers. Authors will be 
contacted for further information, although now several 
appear  to  have  research  interests  in  other  areas.  Stake-
holders  will  be  asked  to  consider  any  identifiable  gaps, 
which  will  add  to  the  development  and  refinement  of 
the programme theory, with the caveat that programme 
theory can only ever be partial and is of course open to 
further  testing.  Despite  these  limitations,  stakeholder 
interest indicates that a realist synthesis still has much to 
offer.

Immersion,  meticulous  data  collection,  systematic 
analysis  and  reflexive  thinking  are  fundamental  to  the 
realist  approach  [15].  Transparency  of  methods  and 
decision-making is an essential part of realist synthesis 
to  ensure  rigour  and  credibility  [20,  51].  To  assist  this 
endeavour, the relevant quality and reporting standards 
and  publication  standards  for  realist  synthesis  will  be 
followed  [51–53].  The  PRISMA-P  statement  (included 
as  Additional  file  1)  has  been  used  to  develop  this 
protocol.
