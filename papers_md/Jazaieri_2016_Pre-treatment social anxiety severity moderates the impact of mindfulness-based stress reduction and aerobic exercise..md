Abstract

We examined whether social anxiety severity at pre-treatment would moderate the impact of 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Aerobic Exercise (AE) for generalized social 
anxiety disorder. MBSR and AE produced equivalent reductions in weekly social anxiety 
symptoms. Improvements were moderated by pre-treatment social anxiety severity.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent and debilitating disorder (Kessler et al., 2005) 
characterized by a fear of social and performance situations (Cox, Fleet, & Stein, 2004). 
Although gold-standard interventions for SAD exist (Powers, Sigmarsson, & Emmelkamp, 
2008), many people are not helped by these interventions, prompting a search for alternative 
treatments. For example, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1990) 
has recently been embraced as a popular integrative medicine intervention (Hofmann, 
Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010), while aerobic exercise (AE) has been gaining momentum as an 
alternative to traditional treatments for a variety of anxiety disorders (see review by 
Asmundson et al., 2013).

One key question is whether pre-treatment characteristics moderate the impact of non-
traditional treatments (Kraemer, Frank, & Kupfer, 2006). In a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) for SAD, we (1) tested whether MBSR would outperform AE, and (2) explored 
whether higher pre-treatment social anxiety severity would moderate the reduction in 
symptoms during MBSR and AE.

Methods

Procedure and Patient Characteristics

Page 2

Patients met criteria for a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD based on a structured 
interview (Di Nardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994) with a clinical psychologist. Upon enrollment 
and completion of pre-treatment assessments (described below), patients were randomized 
to 8 weeks of either MBSR or AE using Efron’s (1971) biased coin randomization 
procedure, which entails higher probability of allocation to the under-represented treatment 
group throughout the duration of the clinical trial. Patients completing less than 50% of the 
weekly ratings (described below) over the 8-weeks were excluded from the present analyses 
(n=9). This sample includes 47 patients (MBSR (n=27), AE (n=20)), 53% females, 23-53 
years of age (M=33.3, SD=8.5), and predominantly Caucasian (45%) and Asian (45%).

Interventions

Standard MBSR (Kabat-Zinn, 1990) was administered. Patients attended public courses for 
adults throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Instructors were unaware of participants’ 
clinical status. Patients randomized to AE received two-month gym memberships. To match 
the individual and group components of MSBR, AE participants completed at least two 
individual AE sessions and one group AE class (other than yoga) each week. (For a detailed 
discussion of these interventions see Jazaieri et al., 2012).

Measures

Moderator: Pre-treatment Severity—The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Report 
(LSAS-SR; Liebowitz, 1987) is a 24-item measure of social anxiety severity. The LSAS-SR 
is reliable with good convergent and discriminant validity (Fresco et al., 2001; Rytwinski et 
al., 2009) and high internal consistency (MBSR and AE α's=0.90).

Outcome: Social Anxiety—We obtained weekly measurements of SAD-related clinical 
symptoms related to: anticipatory anxiety, anxiety during social situations, post-event social 
anxiety, social anxiety intensity, distress due to social anxiety, and interference due to social 
anxiety (Aldao, Jazaieri, Goldin, & Gross, 2014; Goldin et al., 2014). Items were averaged 
to create a social anxiety composite variable. Items were internally consistent 
(α's=0.84-0.95).

Data Analysis

Utilizing multilevel modeling in SAS, we examined group differences in week-to-week 
changes in social anxiety symptoms. We implemented the following model with week of 
assessment, dummy-coded MBSR (vs. AE), and the week × MBSR cross-level interaction as 
predictors:

The fixed effect γ11, reflects group differences in week-to-week change in social anxiety 
symptoms. The intercept and week slope were specified as random (i.e., varying across 
individuals; u0j, u1j).

To examine whether pre-treatment symptom severity (LSAS-SR) moderates the intervention 
effect on weekly levels of social anxiety symptoms (H2), we implemented Model 2 with 
week of assessment, dummy-coded MBSR (vs. AE), pre-treatment LSAS-SR, and the 
MBSR×pre-treatment LSAS-SR interaction as predictors:

Model 2

MBSR and pre-treatment LSAS-SR were added as person-level predictors of the intercept 
only1. The fixed effect γ03, reflects the group×pre-treatment symptom severity interaction. 
Fixed effects γ01 and γ02 are the main effects of MBSR (vs. AE) and pre-treatment LSAS-
SR, respectively.

Results

Group Differences in Weekly Trajectories of Social Anxiety Symptoms

Weekly trajectories did not differ by group (γ11=0.59, SE=0.70, p=0.40). For both MBSR 
and AE patients, social anxiety levels decreased from pre-treatment (MBSR: M=61.05, 
SD=13.59; AE: M=70.37, SD=17.52) through session 8 (MBSR: M=41.43, SD=16.34; AE: 
M=39.17, SD=21.58) (Figure 1). Both MBSR and AE produced significant reductions in 
weekly social anxiety symptoms (MBSR: γ10 = −2.84, SE=0.38, p < 0.001; AE: γ10 = −3.49, 
SE=0.62, p < 0.001) indicating large effects (MBSR: PRV2 = 0.39; Exercise: PRV = 0.32), 
though these effects did not vary across patients (ps > 0.24)3.

Moderation of Weekly Levels of Social Anxiety Symptoms

We observed a group×pre-treatment social anxiety severity (LSAS-SR) interaction on the 
weekly levels of social anxiety (γ03 = 0.59, SE=0.20, p < 0.004; PRV4 = 0.37), indicating 
that MBSR (vs. AE) effects on social anxiety symptoms during treatment were conditional 
on pre-treatment social anxiety severity (LSAS-SR). MBSR patients with low pre-treatment 
social anxiety severity (LSAS-SR < −1 SD) had significantly lower levels of social anxiety 
symptoms throughout MBSR than those in AE (∆Anx = −13.21, t=2.45, p=0.015). In 

1Social anxiety trajectories did not differ by group. We did not hypothesize a week × MBSR × pre-treatment LSAS-SR interaction, so 
MBSR and pre-treatment LSAS-SR were specified as predictors of the intercept, but not the week slope.
2PRV represents the proportional reduction in level-1 residual variance associated with adding week as a predictor to a null model.
3Given no week × MBSR interaction, we estimated MBSR and AE trajectories separately in an abbreviated Model 1 (with only week 
as a predictor).
4Here, PRV represents the proportional reduction in level-2 intercept variance associated with adding the interaction term to a main-
effects model.

contrast, patients with high pre-treatment severity (LSAS-SR > +1 SD) had marginally 
higher symptom levels during MBSR versus AE (∆Anx = 9.16, t=1.76, p=0.079) (Figure 2).

Summary and Discussion

MBSR and AE produced significant and equivalent reductions in weekly trajectories of 
social anxiety symptoms. Although there were no differences between the two interventions 
(replicating prior findings suggesting that MBSR and AE have an equivalent impact on pre-
to-post social anxiety severity; Jazaieri et al., 2012), exploratory analyses revealed that 
patients with lower pre-treatment social anxiety severity had significantly less weekly levels 
of social anxiety symptoms throughout MBSR when compared to AE. In contrast, MBSR 
patients with higher pre-treatment social anxiety severity had marginally higher weekly 
levels of social anxiety symptoms when compared to AE.

Given the small sample for moderator analyses, future studies with larger sample sizes are 
needed to replicate and extend these findings. Future studies should also examine MBSR 
and AE within other anxiety disorders to understand whether these patterns are 
generalizable. It will also be useful to compare MBSR and/or AE directly to gold-standard 
treatments.

These limitations notwithstanding, this study highlights that for SAD, measuring pre-
treatment social anxiety severity may be a useful approach to informing treatment 
recommendations. Currently there is little empirical evidence in the area of treatment 
matching for anxiety disorders (Arch & Ayers, 2013), meaning that clinicians who make 
decisions about matching patients to treatments on a daily basis have little empirical 
guidance. Further, although both MBSR and AE were equally effective in reducing social 
anxiety symptoms, this study suggests that these interventions may have differential effects 
on patients, depending on pre-treatment social anxiety severity. These findings could inform 
future research examining a sequence of interventions based on the patients’ social anxiety 
level; for example, patients arriving with high social anxiety severity may begin treatment 
with an aerobic exercise intervention and once the patient's social anxiety severity decreases, 
the patient could then take part in a standard 8-week MBSR intervention. While the results 
from this study are encouraging, large sample replication efforts and continued examination 
of session-by-session changes are needed.
