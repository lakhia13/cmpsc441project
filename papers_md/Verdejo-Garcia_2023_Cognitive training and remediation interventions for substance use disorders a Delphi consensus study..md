Cognitive training and remediation interventions for substance 
use disorders: A Delphi consensus study

A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.

Abstract

Background and Aims:  Substance use disorders (SUD) are associated with cognitive deficits 
that are not always addressed in current treatments, and this hampers recovery. Cognitive training 
and remediation interventions are well suited to fill the gap for managing cognitive deficits in 
SUD. We aimed to reach consensus on recommendations for developing and applying these 
interventions.

Design:  Delphi approach with two sequential phases: survey development and iterative surveying 
of experts.

Setting:  Online study.

Participants:  During survey development, we engaged a group of 15 experts from a working 
group of the International Society of Addiction Medicine (Steering Committee). During the 
surveying process, we engaged a larger pool of experts (n=53) identified via recommendations 
from the Steering Committee and a systematic review.

Measurements:  Survey with 67 items covering four key areas of intervention development, i.e., 
targets, intervention approaches, active ingredients, and modes of delivery.

Findings:  Across two iterative rounds (98% retention rate), the experts reached a consensus 
on 50 items including: (i) implicit biases, positive affect, arousal, executive functions, and 
social processing as key targets of interventions; (ii) cognitive bias modification, contingency 
management, emotion regulation training, and cognitive remediation as preferred approaches; 
(iii) practice, feedback, difficulty-titration, bias-modification, goal setting, strategy learning, and 
meta-awareness as active ingredients; and (iv) both addiction treatment workforce and specialized 
neuropsychologists facilitating delivery, together with novel digital-based delivery modalities.

Conclusions:  Expert recommendations on cognitive training and remediation for SUD highlight 
the relevance of targeting implicit biases, reward, emotion regulation, and higher-order cognitive 
skills via well-validated intervention approaches qualified with mechanistic techniques and 
flexible delivery options.

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUD) are associated with cognitive deficits that manifest 
during both active substance use and remission [1–3]. These deficits in executive 
functions, attention, memory, social processing, and decision-making skills hinder everyday 
functioning in people with SUD [4–6]. Furthermore, cognitive deficits are associated with 
difficulties adhering to and benefitting from different SUD treatment programs and settings

[7, 8]. Current gold standard treatments for SUD focus on substance use related outcomes, 
such as drug use reduction or abstinence, often without consideration of cognitive deficits 
or with the assumption that cognition will recover following successful remission from 
substance use. However, cognitive deficits can persist even after long-term abstinence and 
contribute to relapse, reduced quality of life and difficulties reintegrating in society [9, 10]. 
Furthermore, cognitive deficits are potential obstacles for medication adherence [11] and 
successful implementation of cognitive behaviour therapies for those with mood, anxiety, 
and trauma-related comorbidities [12].

Cognitive training and remediation interventions are a logical option to fill the current gap in 
managing cognitive deficits in SUD [13–15]. These interventions are purpose-built to restore 
or compensate for cognitive deficits, which may alleviate their impact on daily functioning 
and improve ability to benefit from SUD treatments, as suggested by demonstrated benefits 
in other mental health disorders [16]. Moreover, since some cognitive deficits, such as 
those impacting executive functions and decision-making are not just correlates of SUD but 
also possibly a core psychopathological mechanism driving compulsive substance use [17, 
18], cognitive training and remediation have the potential to become treatments for SUD 
in and of themselves. Given this premise, it is surprising that this group of interventions 
have not yet permeated standard care for SUD. This probably relates to the heterogeneity 
across interventions, and mixed quality of the existing literature [19]. There are numerous 
small pilot or proof-of-concept trials and comparatively fewer well-powered randomized 
trials, and there is a wide variety of intervention approaches, with few studies distilling 
the active ingredients that are purposely driving cognitive and behaviour change [20, 21]. 
Moreover, most cognitive training and remediation interventions applied in SUD were 
initially designed for people with other neurological and mental disorders, such as brain 
injury or schizophrenia, while there are few specific adaptations for people with SUD and 
addiction treatment programs [22]. Altogether, there are currently very few high-quality, 
adequately powered and well-structured interventions for improving cognitive functions in 
SUD. At the same time, cognitive training and remediation for SUD is a growing research 
area, and both emerging studies and meta-analytic evidence suggests promising benefits for 
specific approaches [19, 23, 24].

Given the strong rationale for applying cognitive training and remediation interventions in 
SUD, while acknowledging the heterogeneity and lack of specificity of current approaches, 
we aimed to reach an expert consensus on recommendations for developing these 
interventions in the context of SUD. Specifically, we aimed to identify the best strategies 
for strengthening cognitive functions in people with SUD by surveying experts about the 
cognitive targets, therapeutic approaches, specific techniques and active mechanisms, and 
modes of delivery of cognitive training, as well as remediation interventions likely to 
improve outcomes in the context of SUD treatment. To achieve this, we used a Delphi 
approach [25, 26] to survey a pool of international experts in the field and reach a broad 
consensus via iterative consultation.

Methods

Pre-registration

The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework platform (https://
osf.io/xwpes/) on 25/08/2021, prior to commencement of data collection.

Participants

We engaged two groups of experts during the study: (i) a steering committee (SC), namely, 
a small and collaborative group of researchers with well-established experience in the field 
of cognitive training and remediation in SUD who launched the project and interactively 
developed the initial survey; and (ii) a larger expert panel (EP) who represent the wider 
community of experts in the field and participated in the surveying. This approach is 
practical for the procedure of the Delphi study and ensures the quality of the consensus 
process [27, 28]. Both participants in the SC and EP are co-authors on this paper.

Steering Committee (SC)—Following a series of in-person and online meetings within 
the Neuroscience Interest Group of the International Society of Addiction Medicine 
(ISAM-NIG) regarding cognitive training and remediation interventions, we established a 
working group of 15 experts on the topic, which included (in alphabetical order): Jamie 
Berry, Alfonso Caracuel, Marc L. Copersino, Hamed Ekhtiari, Matt Field, Eric Garland, 
Valentina Lorenzetti, Leandro Malloy-Diniz, Victoria Manning, Ely M. Marceau, David L. 
Pennington, Tara Rezapour, Justin Strickland, Antonio Verdejo-García, and Reinout Wiers 
(henceforth, the SC).

SC members outlined the scope and research questions of the Delphi study, which 
included four areas pertaining to cognitive training and remediation interventions for SUD: 
targets (i.e., cognitive processes that needed to be addressed), approaches (i.e., types of 
interventions), techniques / mechanisms (i.e., active ingredients of the interventions) and 
modes of delivery. Next, the SC designed the original Delphi survey via an interactive 
process of item development, followed by an iterative process until consensus was reached 
within the SC on the final set of items. All the comments and revisions during the survey 
design process were handled by two senior members (AVG and HE). SC members also 
monitored and discussed the progress of the overall Delphi process during the subsequent 
rounds of the survey rating phase. Two assistants (AKZ and EG) facilitated the process and 
managed all contacts and communications.

Expert Panel (EP)—Identification of the EP members was based on a systematic 
literature review. The review search was conducted on 31 July 2021 using PubMed and 
combining search terms and MeSH terms capturing cognitive processes (e.g. inhibitory 
control) AND cognitive training and remediation interventions (e.g. computerised cognitive 
training) AND substance use (e.g. substance use / abuse / misuse, specific substances such 
as alcohol, cocaine etc). Eligibility criteria included: published in English; participants with 
substance use related problems or disorders; testing the effects of a cognitive training and / 
or remediation intervention; including any type of comparator. This search yielded 108 
cognitive training and remediation studies in SUD. The SC assistants screened the studies

Measures

Procedure

to identify key authors in the field to be invited to form the EP. The inclusion criteria 
regarding entering the EP were as follows: a) appearing among the authors of at least 
two original publications in the systematic review database; and b) keeping the authorship 
position of first, last, or corresponding of at least one of the papers. In addition, each of the 
SC members had the opportunity to nominate a maximum of two other candidates for the 
EP, based on their own knowledge and networks. The members of the SC were also part of 
the EP. Following identification of experts, we sent invitation emails to each person, with 
two reminders sent within two-week intervals in the case of not responding.

The original Delphi survey included 67 items. The survey items were those identified by 
the SC as crucial to interrogate the best-suited set of targets (27 items), approaches (11 
items), techniques (10 items), and modes of delivery (19 items) for interventions aimed 
at strengthening cognitive functions in the context of SUD treatment. The main structure 
of the questions was as follows: “How important do you think [survey item here] is for 
strengthening cognitive function with the aim of improving the outcomes of addiction 
treatment?” The items concerning intervention approaches included follow-up multiple 
choice sub-questions for each intervention, in which we inquired about the best timing 
(“detoxification” [first 2 weeks after cessation/reduction of substance use], “early remission” 
[first 3 months after cessation/reduction of substance use] or “chronic phase” [more than 
3 months after cessation/reduction of substance use]), frequency (“several times per day”, 
“several times per week”, “once per week” or “monthly”) and duration (“within one month”, 
“1 to 3 months” or “4 to 12 months”). There was no obligation for the participants to answer 
all the questions.

The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study (Reference: 
MUHREC #27242) and all participants provided informed consent. The study involved two 
sequential phases: (i) survey development and revision (conducted by the SC via email), 
and (ii) survey rating (conducted by the EP via an online survey using Qualtrics software) 
(Figure 1). EP’s responses to the Delphi survey were anonymous, and participants had the 
option of providing demographic and professional data via an independent survey that was 
not linked with their Delphi survey responses.

Survey development/revision phase—SC members proposed items to survey the best-
suited approaches for improving cognition among people with SUD in the context of SUD 
treatment, relying on their own experience and knowledge of the evidence base. Upon 
preparation of the initial draft, all the SC members were asked to add their comments on 
the survey as a whole and endorse the final version across two rounds of revisions [29]. 
The final survey was also pilot tested by two senior members of the SC (HE and AVG) to 
reassure the clarity and coherency of the questions.

A glossary of terms, which contained definitions on every item within the survey, was 
gathered based on comprehensive literature searches as well as consulting-controlled

vocabulary systems of bibliographic databases such as MeSH. This glossary received 
revisions and final approval by the SC.

Survey rating phase—During this phase, the EP rated the finalized version of the survey 
using their expertise and knowledge [30]. Participants used a five-point Likert scale with 
the following options: “not important”, “slightly important”, “moderately important”, “very 
important”, and “essential”. We also provided an “unsure” option. The EP were also invited 
to suggest new items to be included in the survey using a textbox located at the end of 
each section (i.e., targets, approaches, techniques, and modes of delivery); this feedback 
was optional. We also provided a study role-account email, which the experts could use to 
request clarifications or technical support, and to provide unsolicited qualitative feedback.

The consensus threshold was 70%, determined via summation of responses with a score 
of “moderately important” and above [27, 28]. The procedure was iterative, with experts 
subsequently surveyed until the greatest possible agreement was reached in a maximum of 
three rounds, notwithstanding that the same item could not be rated more than two times [25, 
26]. The first round included the full set of survey items as agreed by the SC. The second 
round included: (i) items that reached >50% but less than 70% agreement, and (ii) new 
items suggested by the experts in the first round. The survey used in the second round also 
included, for each item, the proportion of agreement achieved during the first round; this 
information enabled experts to reflect on their own responses in the context of those of the 
broader EP. We have included the two surveys (first and second rounds) as Supplementary 
Materials.

To gauge the degree of diversity in the EP (including the SC), an independent survey, linked 
via de-identified alphanumeric codes to ensure anonymity, collected socio-demographic and 
professional information from respondents. Specifically, we collected information regarding 
age, sex, highest academic degree, country of residence, primary affiliation, primary field 
of research (psychiatry, psychology, pharmacology, neuroscience, cognitive science, etc.), 
primary place of work (hospital, university, business, independent research institute, etc.), 
length of time spent in addiction medicine/science (years), and length of time spent in the 
field of cognitive rehabilitation in addiction treatment research (years).

Data Analysis

We computed response percentages for each Delphi survey item and the degree of agreement 
from participants across the two iterations using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 25. 
In addition, for those items that were carried forward from the first to the second round, we 
calculated reliability statistics (Cronbach’s alpha) to evaluate the temporal stability of ratings 
for each item.

Results

Participants’ characteristics

The EP identification process resulted in 86 potential candidates (45 based on the review 
[note that 5 potential participants identified by the review were already in the SC and 1 
was uncontactable], 26 nominated by the SC, and 15 were already members of the SC).

Out of 86 original invitations, 59 (68.6%) people responded and 54 (62.7%) completed 
the first iteration of the survey; the remaining five participants declined because of 
having moved away from the field (n=3), conflict of interest (n=1), or overcommitment 
(n=1). Fifty-three (98%) participants completed the second and final iteration of the 
survey and formed the final expert panel. The expert panel comprised 45% female and 
55% male respondents, from geographical locations spanning Africa, the Americas, Asia, 
Australia, Europe, and the Middle East. They had a median of 12.5 years of experience in 
addiction neuroscience and a median of 10 years of experience in cognitive training and 
remediation in the context of SUD. They worked across university (80%) and clinical and 
hospital settings (20%) (Table 1). The EP included representatives from all the different 
scientific approaches surveyed including cue-based therapies, computerised cognitive 
training, cognitive remediation, contingency management, emotion-related trainings (e.g., 
mindfulness, emotion regulation) and psychoeducation. Based on a descriptive analysis of 
public profiles (institutional websites, Google Scholar, ResearchGate), invitees who did 
not respond did not systematically differ from EP contributors regarding sex, location, or 
scientific approaches.

Delphi survey results

Figure 2 displays the overall flow of the Delphi process, with the number of items from each 
category endorsed, discarded, or carried forward during subsequent iterations. The experts 
reached consensus after the second round (i.e., 50 items endorsed by >70% of experts), so 
a third round was not necessary. We achieved consensus once all the items had reached 
pre-established levels of agreement (endorsed) or disagreement (discarded), or had been 
rated by all experts at least twice without sufficient endorsement; these decisions were based 
on established processes used in previous Delphi studies [25, 26]. Item reliability across 
rounds showed adequate consistency (alpha range 0.51–0.75). Figure 3 shows the pooled 
experts‘ responses (level of agreement) for each item across the two iterations.

Fifty items were endorsed by >70% of the expert panel. Table 2 enumerates and provides 
definitions for each of the selected items, organised by category. Definitions were primarily 
sourced from the American Psychological Association’s Dictionary of Psychology [31] and 
the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Constructs 
Matrix [32], as well as from specialised literature on cognitive processes (i.e. targets) 
[33–38], intervention approaches [39–42], techniques / mechanisms [43–45] and modes 
of delivery [46–48]. In the following subsections, we summarise the results in terms of 
endorsed and discarded items organised by category.

Targets of intervention—The experts reached consensus on endorsing 21 cognitive 
processes that should be targeted by cognitive training and remediation interventions (Table 
2). The selected processes fell into six higher-order systems, namely, cognitive biases, 
positive affect, arousal and regulatory systems, attention, executive functions, and social 
processing. The experts discarded eight cognitive processes, including those categorised 
under perceptual, psychomotor and memory systems, as well as ‘mentalising’ which is part 
of social systems.

Intervention approaches—The experts reached consensus on endorsing four 
intervention approaches, namely, cognitive bias modification, contingency management, 
emotion regulation training, and cognitive remediation (Table 2). The experts discarded 
six other approaches, including cue-exposure and aversive therapies, mindfulness 
and interoceptive trainings, computerised cognitive training, and neuroscience-informed 
psychoeducation.

For the four interventions endorsed, the majority of experts recommended applying them 
during early remission (i.e., following detoxification and during the first three months after 
treatment or self-initiated behaviour change). In terms of frequency, the majority of experts 
suggested that cognitive bias modification and cognitive remediation should be administered 
several times per week, whereas for contingency management and emotion regulation 
training results were more mixed, with preference towards once per week. In terms of 
duration, the majority of experts suggested that cognitive bias modification and emotion 
regulation training should be administered over three months, whereas experts suggested 
longer durations for cognitive remediation and results for contingency management were 
inconclusive (Figure 4).

Mechanisms / techniques—The experts reached consensus on endorsing 10 different 
techniques that can be used to initiate and consolidate cognitive training and remediation 
approaches (Table 2). The selected techniques involved different forms of practice (guided 
and repeated), feedback (information and incentives), titration (progressive difficulty, 
cognitive challenge), bias modification, goal setting, strategy learning and meta-awareness. 
Social comparison was the only discarded item.

Modes of delivery—The experts reached consensus on endorsing 15 different aspects 
of intervention delivery (Table 2). The experts agreed on considering cognitive training 
and remediation as an adjunct to best-practice interventions. Furthermore, we agreed that 
cognitive training and remediation could be applied as part of both abstinence-oriented and 
harm reduction treatment programs. Regarding intervention context, the experts endorsed 
that cognitive training and remediation interventions should be individually delivered, 
leverage family support and include boosters to be administered after the active intervention 
phase. Regarding providers, the experts endorsed involvement of both specialised therapists 
(e.g., clinical neuropsychologists) and the addiction treatment workforce, as well as 
combinations of therapists and artificial intelligence. Finally, the experts endorsed several 
different interfaces for cognitive training / remediation, such as face-to-face, telehealth, web 
portal, digital / computerised and fully automated, as well as blended approaches. The 
experts discarded five items, including consideration of cognitive training and remediation 
as a standalone intervention for addiction treatment, administration in group settings or 
using immersive technology, and a primary involvement of coaches or artificial intelligence 
as providers.

Discussion

This study successfully engaged a pool of 53 experts to provide a consensus on 
recommended targets, approaches, mechanisms, and delivery of cognitive training and

remediation interventions for SUD. The experts agreed on endorsing 50 items across 
the four different categories (21 targets of intervention, 4 intervention approaches, 10 
active ingredients of interventions and 15 aspects of delivery of interventions), and 
discarded 20 items (8 targets, 6 interventions, 1 mechanism, 5 aspects of delivery). In the 
following paragraphs, we discuss the logic and implications of each of these four areas of 
recommendations. Our interpretations are mostly based on contextualisation of the experts’ 
survey ratings and subsequent consensus (or lack of thereof) into the broader scientific 
literature on the topic. However, in some instances we also use insights gathered during 
the discussions of the SC and unsolicited qualitative feedback provided by the experts; 
for example, the level and quality of empirical evidence accrued for particular items was 
consistently mentioned as an important factor informing experts responses.

The experts’ selection of targets highlights the key role of cue-related biases, reward, 
emotion regulation, attention / executive functions, and social processing in the core 
psychopathology and potential treatment of SUD [20, 49]. This set of processes partly 
overlaps with those proposed in the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) model 
(i.e., positive affect, negative affect, executive function) and with the results of a previous 
Delphi study into neuropsychological assessment for addiction [17, 18]. Our findings go 
beyond these existing frameworks by highlighting the importance of emotional awareness 
and regulation, implicit biases, and social processing. Emotional awareness and regulation, 
which are higher-order (top-down) systems, were emphasized over the basic experience of 
negative affect, which was discarded for not being well suited for cognitive training and 
remediation interventions.

Implicit biases and social processes are now included in a hierarchical cognitive model 
of SUD that strongly aligns with the experts’ view [50]. The selected set of targets also 
expands and qualifies the scope of previous work by pinpointing, for instance, different 
types of biases (i.e., approach, attention, memory) and both specific (i.e., working memory, 
inhibition) and complex (i.e., planning, problem solving) aspects of executive functions. 
Discarded items (i.e., perceptual, motor and memory processes) are part of the cognitive 
deficits typically observed in people with SUD. In particular, they include perceptual 
and motor deficits in people with alcohol use problems and memory problems in those 
with stimulant use disorders [9]. However, discarded items have a relatively more tenuous 
relationship with clinical outcomes [7].

The experts endorsed only four (out of the initial ten) intervention approaches. Importantly, 
there is almost perfect alignment between the endorsed interventions and the selected 
targets. Cognitive bias modification reduces cue-related biases, contingency management 
modifies reward processing, emotion regulation training targets emotional awareness and 
top-down regulation of emotions, and cognitive remediation is the treatment of choice to 
address attention and executive function deficits in neurological populations [51]. There is 
no obvious match among selected interventions for social processing targets (i.e., emotion 
recognition, affiliation) which should be an area of future research, although emotion 
regulation training partly taps into these processes [52]. The selected interventions have 
also demonstrated efficacy in the clinical trials literature. There is recent evidence from 
well-powered randomised controlled trials on the benefits of cognitive bias modification

for alcohol abstinence and emotion regulation training for opioid use/misuse reduction 
[53, 54]. It should be noted, however, that [54] integrated mindfulness with emotion 
regulation training (i.e., reappraisal and savoring techniques); thus, the robust decrease in 
opioid misuse observed in this trial may be a function of synergistic interactions between 
mindfulness and emotion regulation training, as previously proposed [55]. Regarding 
contingency management, there is a solid evidence base supporting its efficacy for stimulant 
and opioid use disorders [56, 57]. Although most contingency management trials stemmed 
from a behavioural economic perspective, rather than being neuroscience-informed, the 
mechanisms of change of the intervention implicate modifications in neurocognitive 
processes [58]. It is important to note that despite overall positive evidence, there are 
specificities in the effects of these interventions. Whilst being one of the most heavily 
replicated and scalable interventions, cognitive bias modification currently has a greater 
level of support for the treatment of alcohol use related problems among people in 
residential treatment settings, and relative to other substances [59], and contingency 
management works better in people with greater severity of substance use and comorbidities 
[60]. In the case of cognitive remediation, there is promising evidence on its ability to 
improve executive functions from small pilot studies [61], but still limited evidence from 
well-powered trials, especially about its effects on substance use related outcomes such 
as craving, use reduction or abstinence [19]. There may also be unknown or unidentified 
indirect relationships between interventions and targets due to, for example, engagement of 
parallel or subordinate processes, but those were outside the scope of the study.

With regard to non-endorsed interventions, the experts were likely sensitive to the 
controversies associated with computerised cognitive training [62], which has shown 
limitations in terms of generalisability of benefits beyond trained tasks [63]. Mindfulness 
in the absence of explicit emotion regulation training was not supported by the experts 
despite its appeal among consumers, its efficacy for reducing substance misuse [64, 65], and 
being an active component of evidence-based interventions for SUD [54]. It is possible that 
the high degree of heterogeneity in mindfulness interventions, a dearth of studies examining 
their neurocognitive mechanisms in the context of addiction [66], and the mixed quality 
of available trials [65] deterred experts from endorsing. The heterogeneity of mindfulness 
interventions can be quantified and better understood via careful reporting and examination 
of intervention mechanisms and key parameters of delivery [64]. Such components could 
then be mapped onto the cognitive-affective processes implicated in SUD; for example, 
using the targets identified by this consensus. Active engagement with cues (as per cognitive 
bias modification) and cognitive strategies (cognitive remediation) seems to be preferred 
over the more passive cue-exposure therapies. For other discarded interventions, such as 
interoceptive training and neuroscience-informed psychoeducation, the lack of research in a 
still emerging area may have prevented greater support from the experts.

The experts endorsed most of the initially surveyed techniques (ten out of eleven). This 
suite of techniques can be applied to design specific interventions and intervention regimens, 
and to monitor consumers’ engagement with active ingredients and its relationship with 
therapeutic outcomes. In this regard, our selection forms a toolbox that can importantly 
contribute to the standardisation and systematic evaluation of cognitive training and 
remediation approaches in the context of SUD. Some of the techniques (e.g., repeated

practice) seem better aligned with cognitive training approaches, which seek to restore or 
reset specific cognitive skills, whereas others such as strategy learning or meta-awareness 
are usually applied in the context of cognitive remediation [51]. However, an advantage of 
most of the techniques identified (e.g., guided practice, progressive difficulty and challenge, 
feedback, bias modification, goal setting) is that they have potential to be transversally 
applied within several intervention approaches or combinations of approaches. Examples of 
suitable avenues include the combination of bias modification and feedback techniques in 
e.g., gamified versions of cognitive bias modification [67], bias modification and strategy 
learning techniques (e.g., cue-related episodic future thinking) [68] or feedback and strategy 
learning in combinations of contingency management and goal management [69].

Regarding delivery, the experts supported the role of cognitive training and remediation 
as an adjunct (rather than a standalone) treatment, which could be integrated in both 
abstinence-oriented and harm reduction programs. The latter is particularly relevant given 
increased appraisal of the value of substance use reduction as a therapeutic goal [70]. This 
amenability to different treatment philosophies, together with endorsement of the existing 
addiction treatment workforce along with specialized therapists as providers, speaks to 
the ecological validity and scalability of cognitive training and remediation in the context 
of standard addiction treatment. Experts also emphasized the need for individual-based 
delivery. Interestingly, this seemed to be at the cost of discarding group interventions, 
which include some well-validated approaches that are well accepted by providers and 
consumers. Through qualitative feedback coming from the experts, we understood that this 
prioritization of individual-based delivery is due to the perceived need for individualization 
of the cognitive training and remediation plan, as well as personalization of progress 
across the intervention. In terms of external support and preferred interfaces, experts 
embraced multiple sources of support (treatment staff, specialists, family, AI) and multiple / 
blended interfaces, which can be deemed appropriate depending on particular populations, 
settings and study designs. The accelerating effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic on 
remote intervention options likely played a role in leaning experts towards endorsement of 
telehealth, digital and fully automated approaches. That said, additional large-scale remote 
intervention trials for telehealth cognitive training and remediation approaches are still 
needed to ascertain the efficacy of this delivery format. Altogether, the consensus reflects 
eagerness to embrace the potential of digital health interventions, although caution is needed 
around the risk for these formats for overpromising and underdelivering [71].

Overall, we leveraged a well-established consensus-reaching method and engaged a diverse 
group of experts to obtain a comprehensive set of recommendations for the development 
and implementation of cognitive training and remediation interventions in the context of 
SUD. We used a two-tiered iterative approach involving both a steering committee and a 
larger pool of experts, which yielded extremely high retention rates, hence supporting the 
validity of our findings. The reliability of the experts’ ratings across the two survey rounds 
was moderate to substantial, which is satisfactory in the context of consensus-formation 
whereby participants are provided with overall panel agreement rates after the first round 
and asked to reflect on their own responses in the context of this interim agreement during 
the second round. The scope of the consensus is unprecedented and our work may pave the 
way for a new generation of interventions in the SUD treatment arena. One limitation to

address in future work is that of involvement of a broader forum of stakeholders, particularly 
those with lived experiences and first line addiction clinicians. The current consensus may 
provide a roadmap for future participatory research involving researchers, clinicians, and 
members of the community with lived experiences of substance use disorders, as well as 
their carers [72, 73]. The selected items could guide and facilitate co-production efforts 
that integrate the experts-based knowledge with consumers and families’ goals, needs and 
preferences, and thus contribute to development of more meaningful, tailored and feasible 
cognitive training and remediation interventions [74, 75]. Although cognitive training and 
remediation paradigms can sometimes be lengthy and repetitive, co-design approaches, 
together with gamification and adaptive difficulty settings for software-based tools, relating 
training / remediation approaches to therapeutic goals, and employing trained therapists 
and a peer support workforce who are skilled in building rapport and engagement, may 
overcome feasibility challenges [76]. There are also other limitations to note, such as 
the modest response rates to our initial invitations (62.7%), which is to some degree 
expected given our unbiased approach (i.e., based on an independent systematic review) 
to identify a subsample of the experts. There was also substantial uncertainty (i.e., “unsure” 
responses) regarding specific survey items, particularly those inquiring about the timing, 
frequency and duration of interventions, which highlights the need for more empirical 
research in this area. There was greater representation of invitees from certain geographical 
locations (e.g., Europe and North America over South America, Africa or Asia) and work 
settings (i.e., University-based versus clinic / hospital based researchers). Although we 
achieved representation of the diversity of the research community in the field (regarding 
e.g. different career stages, locations and settings) within the Steering Committee (SC) 
and via the SC nominations, some aspects of our systematic review strategy such as the 
non-inclusion of studies published in languages other than English or grey literature, or 
our selection of authors with at least two first / senior author publications in the field 
may have disadvantaged representatives from developing countries and early career stages. 
The uneven representation of certain geographical locations such as Asia, Africa and the 
Middle East as well as more broadly from developing countries remains a limitations that 
should be addressed in future studies when further developing and applying this consensus. 
Nonetheless, we engaged similar number of male and female participants (45% female) and 
at least one representative from five continents and 13 countries, career stages and expertise 
(i.e., both cognitive training and rehabilitation experts included) and settings (both basic and 
clinical researchers and health practitioners were part of our sample), which overall support 
the diversity of our sample.

Figure 1. 
Schema of the study procedure. We had two groups of participants: the Steering Committee 
(in black) who designed the initial survey draft and participated in all phases of the 
study, and the Expert Panel (in blue) which includes the Steering Committee along with 
a broader group of experts in the field derived from a systematic review (in grey) and 
recommendations by the Steering Committee. The study comprised three main phases 
including survey development/revision phase (in yellow), survey rating phase (in red), each 
happening in two discrete rounds based on reaching consensus and analysis and reporting 
phase (in green). The number of contributors from each source (i.e. Steering Committee 
[members or nominees] or Systematic Review) is displayed by ‘n=’.

Figure 2. 
Diagram displaying the flow of the Delphi surveying process. It shows the number of items 
initially proposed by the Steering Committee for each of the four areas of interest (i.e. 
targets, approaches, mechanisms or active ingredients and delivery), and how they were 
subsequently endorsed or discarded by the Expert Panel across two consecutive rounds. 
(Left) The Steering Committee initially proposed 67 items; during the 1st iteration, the 
Expert Panel endorsed 36 items (continuous left-to-right flux) and discarded 12 items (black 
boxes). (Middle) The remaining 19 items (which had reached over 50% but less than 70% 
agreement in the 1st iteration) plus 3 newly proposed items (fading magenta) were carried 
forward to the second survey (n=22 items). (Right) During the 2nd iteration, the Expert Panel 
endorsed 14 items and discarded 8 items, and thus reached consensus for 50 final items.

DEFINITIONS

TARGETS

Biases

Positive affect

Attention

Executive 
Functions

Attentional

Elevated attention to stimuli with enhanced relevance for certain individuals.

Approach

Memory

Valuation

Expectancy

Learning

Habit

Automatic tendency to approach drug-related cues faster rather than avoiding them.

Implicit associations held between substance-related cues and positive affective attributions.

Processes by which the probability and benefits of a prospective outcome are computed by 
reference to external information, social context, and/or prior experience. This computation is 
influenced by pre-existing biases, learning, memory, stimulus characteristics, and deprivation 
states. Reward valuation may involve the assignment of incentive salience to stimuli.

A state triggered by exposure to internal or external stimuli, experiences or contexts that predict 
the possibility of reward. Reward expectation can alter the experience of an outcome and can 
influence the use of cognitive resources.

A process by which organisms acquire information about stimuli, actions, and contexts that 
predict positive outcomes, and by which behaviour is modified when a novel reward occurs, or 
outcomes are better than expected. Reward learning is a type of reinforcement learning.

A well-learned behavior or automatic sequence of behaviors that is relatively situation specific 
and over time has become motorically reflexive and independent of motivational or cognitive 
influence—that is, it is performed with little or no conscious intent. For example, the act of hair 
twirling may eventually occur without the individual’s conscious awareness.

Discounting

The tendency to excessively discount the value of rewards when they are not immediately 
available.

Selective

Disengaging

Concentrating on certain stimuli in the environment and not on others, enabling important stimuli 
to be distinguished from peripheral or incidental ones. 

Shifting the focus of attention from one stimulus to another. Deficits in this process may involve 
difficulties to shift attention away from disorder-related cues.

Sustained

Focusing on a task for an extended length of time.

Working memory

The short-term maintenance and manipulation of information necessary for performing complex 
cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension.

Inhibition

Flexibility

Planning

The process of controlling one’s impulses or prepotent responses to prevent inappropriate 
behaviours.

The combination of various cognitive processes to adjust the course of thoughts or actions in 
response to changing situational demands. These changes occur without explicit instructions.

The ability to organize cognitive behaviour in time and space. It is necessary in situations where 
a goal must be achieved through a series of intermediate steps, whereby each step does not 
necessarily lead directly towards that goal.

Problem solving

The process by which individuals attempt to overcome difficulties, achieve plans that move them 
from a starting situation to a desired goal, or reach conclusions through the use of higher mental 
functions, such as reasoning and creative thinking.

Decision making

The cognitive process of choosing between two or more alternatives, ranging from the relatively 
clear cut (e.g., ordering a meal at a restaurant) to the complex (e.g., selecting a mate).

Self & Others

Metacognition

Recognition

Processes used to monitor and assess one’s understanding and performance, and recognising 
one’s own successful cognitive processing.

Identifying other humans’ emotional states, mainly for basic emotions such as joy, sadness, 
surprise, anger, fear, and disgust.

TARGETS

Arousal / Affect

APPROACHES

DEFINITIONS

Affiliation

Engagement in positive social interactions with other individuals.  Affiliation is a behavioural 
consequence of social motivation and can manifest itself in social approach behaviours.

Awareness / 
regulation

Cognitive bias 
modification

Contingency 
management

Cognitive 
remediation / 
rehabilitation

The ability to accurately monitor and change emotional states as a function of context.

A group of interventions that aim to retrain implicit biases towards drug-related cues. CBM 
approaches include retraining of drug-related attentional, approach and/or memory biases, as well 
as drug cue-related inhibitory control training.

A set of interventions wherein immediate tangible incentives (e.g., a voucher, exchangeable for 
retail goods and services) are provided contingent on objective evidence of behaviour change 
(e.g., negative urine drug test). In the context of cognitive training, Contingency management has 
also been used to reinforce training gains (i.e., provide rewards contingent on objective evidence 
of training progress).

A therapeutic process targeting cognitive deficits to improve an individual’s functioning in 
everyday life. This includes methods to train and restore cognitive functions and strategy learning 
techniques. Examples of specific cognitive remediation techniques are goal management training, 
episodic future thinking / implementation of intentions, spaced retrieval / memory reconsolidation 
and errorless learning.

Training patients to use adaptive emotion strategies and regulate maladaptive emotion strategies.

Emotional 
regulation training

TECHNIQUES

Repeated practice

A learning strategy that involves “doing something again and again in order to become better at 
it”.

Guided practice

A transition practice that allows therapists to pull back and the clients to step forward through 
smooth movement from therapist- to client-centered learning.

Feedback

Feedback is information provided by an agent (e.g., therapist, peer, book, parent, self, experience) 
regarding aspects of one’s performance or understanding.

Reward / incentive

Objects, events, situations or activities that attain positive motivational properties from internal 
brain processes.

Progressive 
difficulty / 
scaffolding

Providing interventional material just beyond the difficulty level at which the recipient could 
benefit gradually in a stepwise way over time.

Bias modification

Practicing tasks that require trainees to interact with substance-related cues and alternative 
reinforcers, in a way that diminishes the salience of cues and enhances the salience of alternatives.

Goal setting

The development of an action plan designed to motivate and guide a person or group toward a 
goal.

Metacognitive 
awareness / 
strategies

A range of mental strategies that involve the monitoring of one’s cognition including planning and 
implementation of intentions, monitoring or awareness of comprehension and task performance, 
and evaluation of the efficacy of monitoring processes and strategies to improve self-regulation.

Meta-awareness / 
engagement with 
self-relevant stimuli

Promoting a state of deliberate attention toward the contents of conscious thought, serving as an 
appraisal of experiential consciousness.

DELIVERY

Therapeutic 
function

Intended 
Outcomes

Adjunct

Interventions provided as an add-on to existing treatment practice.

Abstinence oriented When the main goal of treatment is total cessation of substance use.

Drug reduction

When the main goal of treatment is to minimise the negative consequences associated with 
substance use.
