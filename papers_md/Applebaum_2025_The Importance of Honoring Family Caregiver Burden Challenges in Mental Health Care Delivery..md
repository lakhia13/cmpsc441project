Abstract

There is growing recognition of the profound mental health challenges faced by the 53 million 
American family caregivers, and the need for increased access to psychosocial care for this 
vulnerable population. Outside of the context of care delivered in the community, family 
caregivers are increasingly seeking support from hospital-based counseling centers. This trend – 
combined with a public policy landscape that promotes the delivery of caregiver-specific supports 
and services – highlights challenges faced by mental health professionals who bill for services 
to provide and bill for psychosocial care to family caregivers. In this paper, we discuss three 
interrelated challenges that psychosocial providers face in providing care to family caregivers and 
which our field needs to confront as healthcare transfers more responsibilities onto the shoulders 
of family caregivers: (1) caregiver burden is not recognized as a formal diagnosis; (2) current 
documentation for caregivers must be linked to patient encounters; and (3) support for family 
caregivers occurs within larger systematic barriers to mental health integration. By accurately 
describing and documenting caregiver burden and advocating for increased parity in mental health 
coverage, we hope that the field can bridge the gap between emerging research, momentum in 
policy, and available psychosocial services for this vulnerable population.

The 53 million family caregivers in the United States (U.S.) today serve as the invisible 
backbone of our healthcare system. The responsibilities of caregivers are profound and 
rapidly increasing: family caregivers shoulder tasks the are physically, emotionally, socially, 
and financially demanding (AARP National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020). Over the 
past decade there has been a dramatic shift to home-based care, a shift amplified by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Oncology care leads the way (Corrie et al., 2013; Handley, Bekelman, 
& Binder, 2020), and family caregivers of patients with cancer are increasingly relied upon

to manage complex medical care at home (Applebaum et al., 2023). These models of care 
have profound benefits for patients and healthcare systems but depend on the availability 
and willingness of caregivers to take on patient care responsibilities, including medical and 
nursing tasks once assumed by trained healthcare professionals. Such responsibilities come 
at a high psychosocial cost and put caregivers at risk for their own medical and mental 
health problems. In fact, cancer caregivers may be at greater risk than the patients for whom 
they provide care for anxiety, depression, insomnia (Askari, Madgaonkar, & Rowell, 2012; 
Braun, Mikulincer, Rydall, Walsh, & Rodin, 2007; Covinsky, 1994), and even posttraumatic 
stress disorder (Acquati, Miyawaki, & Lu, 2020; De Padova et al., 2021; Hudson, Thomas, 
Trauer, Remedios, & Clarke, 2011; Moschopoulou, Hutchison, Bhui, & Korszun, 2018; van 
Warmerdam et al., 2019). Strikingly, caregiver distress often surpasses that experienced by 
patients and when left untreated, increases exponentially across the caregiving trajectory, 
and can contribute to mental health challenges in bereavement. Such emotional distress also 
has a direct bearing on the quality of the care caregivers provide to patients.

Recently, there has been national recognition of the distress experienced by caregivers, and 
the importance of providing education and support so that the potential negative impact of 
caregiving can be mitigated. For example, the RAISE Family Caregiving Advisory Council 
made recommendations to Congress in 2021 and a 2022 national strategy that included the 
development of services and supports for family caregivers (Administration for Community 
Living, 2022). In 2022, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine 
held a workshop on Family Caregiving for People with Cancer and Other Serious Illnesses 
(2022) that highlighted exemplar caregiver support services that could serve as models 
to be disseminated. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) increased home-
based services and supports available to caregivers, though implementation is state specific 
(National Academy for State Health Policy, 2021). Moreover, over the past decade, the state 
of the science of psychosocial intervention research focused on addressing the needs of 
cancer caregivers has accelerated, and nearly 75 interventions have now been developed and 
tested to support cancer caregivers (Ferrell & Wittenberg, 2017; Northouse, Katapodi, Song, 
Zhang, & Mood, 2010).

There remains, however, a significant disconnect between national recommendations, the 
state of the science of intervention research, and current clinical practice. Outside of the 
context of research trials–the primary mechanism through which those 75 interventions were 
tested–the ability for family caregivers of patients with various illnesses and disabilities to 
access targeted psychosocial care remains limited. To date, few healthcare systems have 
established clinical services for caregivers (Odom et al., 2023), which is due, in part, to a 
lack of infrastructure available to support such clinical services. Moreover, unless clinical 
services are supported entirely by institutional funds or philanthropy, a mechanism needs to 
be established for caregivers to be billed for psychosocial care. For this to occur, caregivers 
must have their own medical record in which their diagnosis and services rendered can 
be documented (Applebaum, Kent, & Lichtenthal, 2021). Even once medical records 
are established, however, there remain fundamental challenges to accurately documenting 
caregivers’ psychosocial functioning and billing for services received.

The messaging and national recommendations are clear and consistent: caregivers need 
support, now. In a synthesis of emerging policies and analysis of the care gap for 
caregivers, the following conclusion is stated: “For healthcare and service providers, the 
main recommendation was to integrate caregivers into regular practice” (Gaugler, 2021). 
Similarly, The National Alliance for Caregiving recently highlighted several barriers to 
integrating caregivers into medical care (Bilbrey, 2021). Their white paper advocates for 
the creation of standards for caregiver engagement, including caregiver assessment as 
part of clinical workflow, and, importantly, access to CMS codes to facilitate caregiver 
engagement. They poignantly conclude their article after reviewing the barriers to providers’ 
understanding billing requirements or pathways for caregiver engagement that, “…providers 
are on their own to figure out reimbursement codes.”

Indeed, we as psychosocial providers and caregiving scientists have been on our own to 
determine the most appropriate reimbursement codes to use, and in the process, have come 
across various challenges that require creative solutions that honor the unique burden of 
caregiving and increase access to available services for this vulnerable population. This 
editorial is one incremental step in response to the challenges highlighted by the National 
Alliance for Caregiving report, among others, to bridge the gap of care as we strive to 
increase the support services available for caregivers. Here, we highlight three interrelated 
challenges that psychosocial providers face in providing care to family caregivers and which 
our field needs to confront as healthcare transfers more responsibilities onto the shoulders of 
family caregivers: (1) caregiver burden is not recognized as a formal diagnosis; (2) current 
documentation for caregivers must be linked to patient encounters; and (3) support for 
family caregivers occurs within larger systematic barriers to mental health integration.

Challenge One: Caregiver burden is not recognized as a formal medical or 

mental health diagnosis

Diagnostic codes are defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD; now on 
version 10 maintained by the World Health Organization), the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; now on version 5 maintained by the American 
Psychiatric Association) and, more recently, the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 
coding manual (maintained by the American Medical Association). ICD codes are much 
broader than the DSM (70,000 codes versus 300) but must be applied for insurance 
reimbursement. The current DSM-5 has over 300 mental disorders, defined as a significant 
disturbance in a person’s cognition, emotion, and behavior resulting in such impacts as 
distress, poor emotional regulation, impairment, dysfunction, and disability (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013) and, currently, one of these diagnoses is needed to bill 
insurance for services rendered by a mental health professional. In addition to insurance 
reimbursement, diagnostic codes allow health care providers to effectively communicate and 
plan treatment.

While ICD codes and psychiatric diagnoses listed in the DSM-5 are meant to coincide, 
there remain significant gaps (First et al., 2021) which directly impede the integration 
of mental health providers into medical care more generally. For instance, the ICD-11

(approved in 2019) now lists several Z codes that are specific to caregivers, such as: 
Z63.79: Other stressful life events affecting family and household; Z71.89: Other specified 
counseling- Provision of support for self-management to caregiver; and Z73.3: Stress, not 
elsewhere classified: caregiver role strain. While these additions to the latest ICD may 
provide pathways for caregivers to receive additional services, mental health providers 
require corresponding DSM codes to bill insurance. Thus, in this regard, the DSM has not 
caught up to the broader medical communities’ acknowledgement of caregivers. Further, 
to our knowledge, none of the ICD codes explicitly define caregiver burden as its own 
diagnostic entity. This is striking, given discussions of a diagnostic category for caregiver 
burden long predate this editorial. In seminal early work (Northouse, Williams, Given, & 
McCorkle, 2012) the following is stated:

“Caregivers need to be assessed for caregiver burden, and its effects need to be 
documented. Ideally, an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for 
caregiver burden should be established… The ICD is used worldwide for morbidity 
and mortality statistics and for insurance payment. Use of a formal ICD code that 
diagnoses caregiver burden would allow reimbursement for primary care providers 
who evaluate and treat the caregiver. The code could also be used to help people 
secure a tax credit for their work as caregivers.”

These pioneers in caregiver research recognized the importance of diagnosing and 
documenting caregiver burden, both for increased reimbursement and to draw attention to 
caregiver burden on a public health level so that additional resources could be appropriately 
allocated.

Undoubtedly, the distress experienced by family caregivers is often profound, and frequently 
higher than that experienced by care recipients (Clavarino, Lowe, Carmont, & Balanda, 
2002). Many family caregivers, including those without any history of mental health 
concerns, experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even posttraumatic stress 
that meet DSM-5 criteria for a major mood or anxiety disorder. For example, early 
work assessing psychiatric symptoms in family caregivers of patients with advanced 
cancer indicated that panic disorder was the most common identified psychiatric issue 
(Vanderwerker, Laff, Kadan-Lottick, McColl, & Prigerson, 2005). More recently, studies 
have shown that among cancer caregivers, 40-50% experience anxiety (del-Pino-Casado, 
Priego-Cubero, López-Martínez, & Orgeta, 2021; Götze et al., 2018; van Warmerdam et 
al., 2019) and 16-42% experience depression (Bedaso, Dejenu, & Duko, 2022; Cleveland 
Clinic, 2023; Family Caregiver Alliance, 2016; Geng et al., 2018; Goren, Gilloteau, Lees, 
& DaCosta Dibonaventura, 2014; Hudson et al., 2011; Nielsen, Neergaard, Jensen, Bro, & 
Guldin, 2016), and an increasing number experience posttraumatic stress symptomatology 
(Carmassi et al., 2020; Concierge Care Advisors, 2023; LaBuzetta, Rosand, & Vranceanu, 
2019; Teixeira & Pereira, 2016; van Warmerdam et al., 2019).

Many caregivers, however, experience distress that is significant and even impairing but does 
not meet criteria for a major mood or anxiety disorder. Such distress is often labeled as 
caregiver burden, a multidimensional construct that refers to the ways in which the caregiver 
role and caregiving responsibilities can negatively impact the caregiver. Burden encompasses 
both objective and subjective factors (Given et al., 1992), including physical, psychological,

social, emotional, and financial components, such as the responsibilities caregivers shoulder 
in assisting with ADLs and IADLs (Ge & Mordiffi, 2017). To our knowledge, however, 
there is no ICD or DSM-5 code for caregiver burden. This is particularly striking given that 
there are 21 ICD codes that document the performance of various caregiving-related tasks 
(World Health Organization, 2023), the performance of which are associated with caregiver 
burden (Ge & Mordiffi, 2017).

Importantly, while the drivers of burden may differ for caregivers based on their care 
partner’s illness, the experience of burden appears to be almost universal among family 
caregivers. For example, in dementia, neurocognitive, behavioral, and psychological 
challenges in patients are associated with greater caregiver burden (Chiao, Wu, & Hsiao, 
2015). In other neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, profound 
physical impairments remain the largest contributor to caregiver burden (de Wit et al., 2018). 
In cancer, greater need for help with activities of daily living for patients with solid tumors 
has been associated with greater burden (Ge & Mordiffi, 2017). Across diseases, when left 
untreated, burden increases significantly over time, is higher when more hours of care are 
provided (AARP National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020; Adelman, Tmanova, Delgado, 
Dion, & Lachs, 2014), and is higher for older caregivers (Unsar, Erol, & Ozdemir, 2021). 
Not surprisingly, higher burden is associated with increased symptoms of anxiety (del-Pino-
Casado et al., 2021) and depression (del-Pino-Casado, Rodríguez Cardosa, López-Martínez, 
& Orgeta, 2019) across all disease types. This is one of the reasons early interventions for 
caregivers experiencing burden is so critical. Without a diagnostic code for caregiver burden, 
however, we are challenged to accurately describe and diagnose the experience of so many 
of the family caregivers seeking psychosocial support.

In this context, family caregivers are frequently given a diagnosis of an adjustment disorder 
in clinical practice. According to the DSM-5, an adjustment disorder includes the presence 
of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring 
within three months of the onset of the stressor(s) that do not persist for more than 
an additional six months after the stressor is no longer present (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). Additionally, the DSM-5-TR states that the distress is out of proportion 
with the expected reaction to the stressor and/or the symptoms must be clinically significant. 
That is, they cause marked distress and impairment in functioning. Moreover, the DSM-5 
states that, once the stressor is removed or the person has begun to adjust, the symptoms 
must subside within six months.

Despite adjustment disorders being commonly used in current clinical practice with 
caregivers, we question the helpfulness and appropriateness of this diagnosis, especially 
among the many caregivers whose symptoms persist for months and even years but do 
not increase in intensity to meet DSM-5 criteria for a major mood disorder. First, it is 
rare for caregivers to seek and ultimately receive psychosocial support within the first 
three months after their care partner’s diagnosis. Moreover, rarely is the stressor removed 
during the course of care; instead, the stressor–family caregiving–remains constant and often 
intensifies over time. For so many caregivers, the stressor is present for years and even 
decades, and the stress endures and remains impairing as the challenges of illness and 
caregiving ebb and flow (Corey & McCurry, 2018; Kim & Schulz, 2008; Oshio, 2015).

During this time, many caregivers continue to experience distress that is no longer accurately 
described by the label of adjustment disorder, but too, does not meet criteria for a major 
mood disorder. Perhaps not surprisingly then, the diagnosis of adjustment disorder has 
been criticized for inaccurately describing more chronic conditions lasting longer than the 6-
month timeframe (Bachem & Casey, 2018; O’Donnell et al., 2016); Additionally, compared 
to other psychiatric diagnoses, mental health care usage is particularly low for patients 
diagnosed with adjustment disorders (Maercker et al., 2008), raising further questions about 
its clinical utility.

What, then, is the appropriate diagnosis for the large number of family caregivers whose 
distress endures for years, for whom the stressor of caregiving is never removed during 
a course of psychosocial care, and whose symptoms do not warrant a diagnosis of 
major depression or generalized anxiety but nonetheless are distressing and periodically 
impairing? Would the potential benefits of the creation of a diagnostic and billing code 
for caregiver burden warrant further exploration? Defining caregiver burden as a billable, 
clinical condition would allow for more meaningful communication among healthcare 
professionals accessing caregivers’ medical records, and likely mitigate the stigma that so 
many caregivers feel when receiving a diagnosis of a mood disorder, a further barrier to care 
(Dockery et al., 2015; Mosher, Given, & Ostroff, 2015). Moreover, a diagnostic category 
and billing code for caregiver burden would allow for improved healthcare communication, 
and more precise characterization of the psychosocial experience of caregivers nationally. 
From a public health standpoint, we remain severely limited in tracking the epidemiology 
of caregiver burden and in the absence of specified diagnostic and billing codes that would 
allow us to fully define the scope of the problem, we remain challenged to track caregiver 
burden as a public health issue and effectively advocate for services for caregivers. Reliance 
on adjustment disorders to describe their lived experience does a disservice to caregivers 
and conveys limited meaningful data to other healthcare providers involved in their care. 
While some new Z codes in the latest ICD-11 have begun to recognize caregiver strain 
more generally, these alone do not provide a pathway to increase mental health care access. 
Without a mechanism to consistently document and bill for caregiver burden, providers 
are disincentivized to turn their attention to caregivers during clinical encounters. When 
caregiver burden is better characterized and subsequently documented, however, healthcare 
providers can more effectively communicate and intervene on the profound needs of this 
vulnerable population.

Challenge Two: Current documentation for caregivers must be linked to 

patient encounters.

It is our hope that all family caregivers will be able to access support that is targeted to 
their own unique needs and in which they, as caregivers, become the identified patient 
with their own medical record (Applebaum et al., 2021). This would, in turn, allow access 
to mental health services offered through their insurance carriers. To date, however, it 
remains common for caregiver support to be superimposed upon psychosocial care delivered 
to patients. In the original white paper that inspired this editorial (National Alliance for 
Caregiving, 2021), the authors presented a comprehensive list of 44 categories of “Patient-

Targeted Caregiver Services,” “Caregiver Targeted Services,” and “Category II” codes. 
While these represent creative approaches to acknowledging caregivers’ contributions to 
patient care, this expansion of billing codes that include caregivers puts the ownness on the 
provider to dissect and appropriately apply countless codes. This further complicates billing 
and adds to the fragmentation of physical and mental health care (Bachrach, Anthony, Detty, 
Manatt, & Phillips, 2014; Lombardi, Greeno, & de Saxe Zerden, 2023; Mauch, Kautz, & 
Smith, 2008). The utility of these codes is also limited since the majority require a physician 
to issue the bill and exclude behavioral health clinicians. Finally, because these codes are 
limited to describing how caregivers interface (or interfere) with patient care, they have 
the potential to be highly pejorative. Imagine an overly burdened caregiver receiving an 
additional charge to their insurance because their stress interfered with the care they were 
trying to deliver to their family member or loved one. To our knowledge, the only code 
listed in this NAC Appendix that provides direct, reimbursable support to caregivers is 
the traditional psychotherapy code (90832-90837), which requires a psychiatric diagnosis, 
returning us to the barriers highlighted in Challenge One.

Challenge Three: Support for family caregivers occurs within larger 

systematic barriers to mental health integration.

Advocating for increased access to mental health care for this vulnerable population 
must take the larger healthcare system into context. More than one fifth of the U.S. 
population had a mental illness in 2020 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2021), a 30% increase from 2008 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, 2020). While the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the 
Affordable Care Act of 2010 sought to create equal reimbursement for physical and 
mental health care, mental health care coverage still lags behind the rest of medicine in 
both reimbursement rates and access to providers for the general population (O’Donnell, 
Williams, & Kilbourne, 2013). The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the mental 
health crisis in the U.S. (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, & Rauh, 2022) and while it 
expanded the use of mental health telehealth services (Mulvaney-Day, Dean, Miller, & 
Camacho-Cook, 2022), data suggests that these services are limited by the same low 
reimbursement rates highlighted above (Wilson, Rampa, Trout, & Stimpson, 2017). Stigma 
also remains a significant barrier to expanding mental health care services (Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2013), and caregivers are no different, 
expressing negative perceptions of mental health professionals and the desire to manage 
emotional concerns on their own (Mosher et al., 2015). As a result of these and other factors, 
nearly one third of patients with psychiatric diagnoses do not receive treatment (Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2015).

Despite these barriers, with the momentum to increase available support to caregivers, there 
are several emerging, alternative billing pathways that deserve attention. First, Health and 
Behavior Codes that are added onto existing medical codes (O’Reilly, 2019) allow mental 
health providers to bill for behavioral health services without a corresponding psychiatric 
diagnosis. Theoretically, these codes create a pathway to bill caregivers’ insurance for 
their own care while skirting the need to document a diagnostic code for caregiver

burden. Unfortunately, while there was significant enthusiasm when these codes were 
originally approved (Drotar, 2012), their low reimbursement rates, need for additional 
preauthorization, and higher rates of insurance denial (Duke, Guion, Freeman, Wilson, & 
Harris, 2012; Patel, Apple, & Campbell, 2021) are significant barriers to their integration. 
Second, direct payment for caregivers’ management of home-based care may represent 
an alternative pathway to reimburse caregivers for the care they provide for patients and 
possibly may be applied toward their own mental health care. For instance, out of the 
28 states who have presented their initial plan in response to The American Rescue Plan 
Act (National Academy for State Health Policy, 2021), three directly cite mental health 
care access as priorities and plans to apply these federal funds to improve caregiver 
mental health. More recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CNS) 
recently released GUIDE (Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience) Model represents 
one exemplar program that will provide mechanisms for caregivers to receive education, 
training, and support for families covered by Medicare Part B. The extension of this model 
to support caregivers of patients with a wide variety of illnesses and conditions will be an 
important future direction. However, these benefits appear to be directly linked to patient’s 
care and, therefore, medical record, further emphasizing the barriers described in Challenge 
Two above. Finally, the National Strategy put forth by the Administration for Community 
Living and the RAISE Family Caregiving Advisory Council in 2022 outlined five goals to 
improve the quality of life of family caregivers. The future realization of Goal 3 of the 
National Strategy – strengthen services and supports for family caregivers – will mean that 
caregivers nationally will have access to psychosocial support that will not contribute to 
further financial burden. Together, while these programs represent positive momentum to 
deliver support to caregivers, and we are in a pivotal moment in addressing caregiver burden, 
as of today, none provide a clear and direct pathway for mental health providers to deliver 
such services to caregivers in need.

Conclusions

Caregivers provide an incredible amount of unpaid – and often underrecognized – assistance 
in the delivery of cancer care. These efforts, however, come at profoundly high cost and put 
them at risk for significant mental health challenges. Without support, such challenges can 
become severe and impair caregivers’ capacities to provide high quality care to patients. 
Indeed, addressing caregiver burden will take creative solutions. We have argued that 
establishing caregiver burden as a diagnostic category has the potential to increase access 
to appropriate, equitable mental health care for caregivers of patients facing serious illness 
and that current models of healthcare delivery remain exclusively patient focused and exist 
in the context of existing challenges with mental health care integration more broadly. As 
we have argued, circuitous pathways to billing for caregiver burden that remain tied to 
patients’ records, and thereby their insurance, do not provide pathways for direct support for 
caregivers. We have proposed that considering caregiver burden as a distinct clinical group 
of symptoms would address these issues. If codified, the diagnosis would allow for more 
accurate documentation and billing of caregiver burden and, hopefully, will allow for the 
most impactful realization of the National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers.
