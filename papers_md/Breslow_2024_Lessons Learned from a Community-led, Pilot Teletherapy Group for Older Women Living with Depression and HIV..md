Abstract
Older women with HIV face challenges to their quality of life, including neurocognitive decline, early-onset menopause, 
and  chronic  health  issues.  Chief  among  these  concerns  is  depression,  the  most  common  psychiatric  comorbidity  among 
people  living  with  HIV,  with  rates  twice  as  high  among  women  as  men.  However,  tailored  interventions  among  older 
women living with HIV and depression are lacking. Following the ADAPT-ITT framework to adapt existing interventions 
for  cultural  relevance  among  groups  of  people  living  with  HIV,  the  study  team  revised  an  evidence-based  intervention, 
the  ‘Stress  Management  and  Relaxation  Training/Expressive  Supportive  Therapy  Women’s  Project  (SMART/EST),’  for 
online implementation. Working with two community stakeholders, the study team conducted focus groups, theater test-
ing, and manual adaptation. This resulted in the development of e-SMART/EST, an online teletherapy group co-facilitated 
by a Licensed Psychologist and a credentialed Peer Counselor. The adapted, eight-session weekly intervention was tested 
with an exploratory pilot sample of eight older women (55 years and older) with HIV and depression. Participants rated 
the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the intervention, as well as symptoms of depression and HIV-related 
quality of life before and after the group. The e-SMART/EST Women’s Project demonstrated high acceptability, feasibility, 
and appropriateness. Engagement was high, as women attended an average of 6.8 sessions. In qualitative interviews, par-
ticipants reported peer co-facilitation, culturally relevant themes (e.g., HIV-related minority stress, critical consciousness, 
grief, and sex and pleasure), mindfulness techniques, and cohesion with other women as main favorable elements of the 
intervention. Barriers to online implementation included technological issues, distractions due to remote participation, and 
hindered emotional attunement compared with in-person group therapy. Findings support further research to test similar 
interventions in full-scale trials with older women living with depression and HIV.

Women Living with HIV

Women living with HIV (WLWH) have been significantly 
underrepresented in HIV-related research, often overlooked 
in the development of pharmacological treatments and clini-
cal services, and marginalized in community-building efforts 
[1–3]. Initially excluded from AIDS case surveillance in the 
United Sates, it was not until 1992 that the Centers for Dis-
ease  Control  (CDC)  adopted  a  gender-inclusive  definition 
of AIDS  [4].  Subsequently,  the  number  of  women  identi-
fied as living with HIV surged by 151% from 1992 to 1993, 
marking a pivotal shift in access to treatment and ancillary 
services  for  WLWH  [5].  More  than  four  decades  into  the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic, women now constitute approximately 
23.1% of cases in the United States, facing ongoing dispari-
ties influenced by racism, sexism, geographical differences 
in services and resources, and ongoing HIV-related stigma 
[6,  7].  Despite  advancements  in  antiretroviral  treatment, 
older WLWH continue to encounter chronic stressors such 
as early-onset menopause and high rates of disability, com-
pounded crises of mental health [8–11]. Older WLWH must 
content  with  physiological  and  sociopolitical  stressors  [9, 
11, 12], which include poverty and low wages, social isola-
tion, gender-based violence, and limited community-based 
resources dedicated to their needs [13].

The ’Greying’ of HIV among Women

Globally, over half of people living with HIV (PLWH) are 
aged  50  and  older,  a  demographic  expected  to  increase  to 
70% by 2030 [14]. This shift underscores the urgent need 
to address age-related illnesses, HIV-associated non-AIDS 
conditions,  excess  morbidity  and  mortality,  and,  notably, 
mental  health  concerns  [9,  14–16].  The  most  prevalent 
psychiatric comorbidity among PLWH is depression, with 
rates  at  least  double  those  of  the  general  population  [17–
19]. Depression is even more common among WLWH than 
among men [20], and women report both a higher number of 
symptoms and well as greater symptom severity [21]. These 
disparities  are  likely  exacerbated  by  low  rates  of  health-
care  engagement  and  retention  among  older WLWH  [11]. 
It is critical, therefore, to prioritize older WLWH in mental 
health research and intervention development.

Need for Targeted Interventions

Historically,  interventions  have  inadequately  addressed 
the  unique  needs  of  older  WLWH,  who  are  particularly 
impacted  by  internalized  societal  stigma.  There  is  a  need 
for  targeted  interventions  that  center  the  psychological 

associations  of  intersecting  stigma  related  to  HIV  status, 
gender,  aging,  and  racial  minority  status  [10,  21].  Myriad 
studies indicate that older WLWH often internalize negative 
societal attitudes through processes unique to their experi-
ences  as  women  living  with  HIV  [10,  21,  22].  This  inter-
nalized stigma is strongly associated with elevated rates of 
depression  and  lower  retention  in  mental  health  services, 
particularly among multiply marginalized WLWH, such as 
those who are queer and transgender [3, 23], Black and of 
color [7, 10, 24], and older [9]. To effectively target depres-
sion in this growing demographic, interventions must focus 
on intersecting stigmas as a critical mechanism exacerbat-
ing  adverse  mental  health  outcomes.  Few  studies,  such  as 
the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) [25–27] and 
the Stress Management and Relaxation Training/Expressive 
Supportive Therapy (SMART/EST) Women’s Project [28], 
have  made  significant  strides  in  measuring  and  mitigating 
drivers of health disparities for older WLWH. However, few 
of these interventions have been made scalable or culturally 
relevant.

Developing a Culturally Relevant, Accessible 
Intervention

In response to these ongoing challenges, this study aimed to 
adapt the SMART/EST Women’s Project [28] – a previously 
validated  clinical  intervention  –  for  an  online  platform, 
targeting  stigma  as  a  key  mechanism  of  depression.  This 
adaptation process was guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, 
an eight-phase approach that involves partnering with com-
munity experts to ensure cultural and clinical relevance of 
an adapted intervention [29]. This approach has been suc-
cessfully applied to tailor interventions for women and for 
online implementation [30–33]. See Fig. 1 for a visualiza-
tion of the eight phases and the driving question for each.

In  the  initial  phases  of  the  ADAPT-ITT  process,  the 
SMART/EST  Women’s  Project  was  selected  due  to  its 
demonstrated  efficacy  across  diverse  groups  of  women, 
multiple languages, and various implementation sites over 
15  years  [28,  34–36].  In  its  original  format,  SMART/EST 
was  held  in  person.  Co-facilitators  utilized  two  therapeu-
tic  interventions,  cognitive  behavioral  stress  management 
(CBSM+)  and  expressive-supportive  communication,  to 
bolster  self-efficacy  and  shared  adaptive  coping.  The  first 
iteration, SMART/EST I, was implemented in 10 commu-
nity  health  centers  and  yielded  significant  reductions  in 
depression  among WLWH  one  year  post-intervention [36, 
37]. SMART/EST II, conducted across 11 health centers in 
Florida,  New  York,  and  New  Jersey,  consisted  of  16  ses-
sions  and  showed  improvements  in  HIV-related  and  psy-
chiatric outcomes [34, 38, 39]. Most recently, SMART/EST

questions of the ADAPT-ITT

III was implemented in four HRSA-funded Health Centers, 
with similarly promising results [40, 41].

To meet evolving needs of older WLWH, the study team 
aimed to focus on teletherapy to accommodate the increased 
isolation  and  service  access  issues  exacerbated  by  the 
COVID-19 crisis [42]. Studies from 2020 to 2024 suggest 
pandemic-related  lockdowns  may  have  increased  feelings 
of isolation, fear of coinfection, and heightened depression 
among  older  WLWH  [42–44].  During  this  period,  there 
was a significant increase in the utilization of teletherapy—
remote audio and video-based mental health services [45]. 
Teletherapy  has  proven  effective  in  reducing  psychiatric 
symptoms among diverse groups of PLWH, including older 
adults [46–48] and those with multiple mental health con-
cerns [43, 49]. Despite drawbacks, such as feelings of emo-
tional distance from providers and technological issues [45], 
teletherapy  offers  the  potential  to  integrate  mental  health 
services  into  the  ‘daily  environment’  and  reduce  stigma 

activation  common  in  in-person  services  [44].  For  older 
WLHW, teletherapy may reduce barriers to service utiliza-
tion, such as mobility issues, social isolation, and associated 
costs [50].

The Present Study

Toward  this  end,  this  study  aimed  to  address  depression 
using a therapeutic approach targeting gender-specific pro-
cesses  and  internalized  stigma  among  a  small  pilot  group 
of older WLWH. The present study involved adapting and 
pilot  testing  a  community-led  teletherapy  group  interven-
tion  that  centered  the  expertise  of  older WLWH. Working 
with  community  partners,  the  study  team  developed  and 
tested  e-SMART/EST,  an  online  version  of  the  SMART/
EST Women’s Project. The study team retained aspects of 
SMART/EST  and  worked  with  stakeholders  to  integrate

novel, culturally relevant themes and intervention modali-
ties  for  the  e-SMART/EST  teletherapy  intervention.  The 
adaptation process harnessed the rapid uptake of teletherapy 
during  the  COVID-19  lockdowns,  addressing  pandemic-
related barriers to in-person services. This pilot intervention 
was  co-facilitated  via  Zoom  by  a  Licensed  Psychologist 
and a Peer Counselor and targeted themes such as minority 
stress, anger, grief, social support, menopause, sex and plea-
sure, and harm reduction. The goal was to bolster culturally 
relevant  coping  skills  such  as  self-efficacy,  mindfulness, 
social support, and critical consciousness in the context of 
HIV  stigma  and  intersecting  minority  stressors  [51,  52]. 
This paper describes two sequential objectives of the study:

1.  To utilize the ADAPT-ITT model to adapt the SMART/
implementation  as 

intervention 

for  online 

EST 
e-SMART/EST.

2.  To  conduct  a  small  pilot  test  of  the  e-SMART/EST 
intervention  and  measure  its  preliminary  feasibility, 
acceptability, and appropriateness for older women con-
tending with the dual impact of HIV and depression.

Methods and Results of Objective 1: 
Adaptation

Adaptation Approach

The first objective of the study was to adapt SMART/EST 
into e-SMART/EST. To do so, the study team followed the 
ADAPT-ITT model, partnering with community stakehold-
ers (i.e., older women with HIV and depression) in each of 
the  eight  phases.  See  Fig.  2  for  a  summary  of  the  driving 
question, method, and lessons learned from each phase.

Adaptation Process and Results

Phase 1: Assessment

Who will be the target population, and why are they at risk 
for comorbid depression?

In  Phase  1,  the  study  team  aimed  to  identify  a  target 
population  in  need  of  more  nuanced  intervention  to  sup-
port  comorbid  HIV  and  mental  health  concerns.  In  2021, 
researchers  within  the  Einstein-Rockefeller-City  Univer-
sity of New York Center for AIDS Research (ERC-CFAR) 
launched  the  HIV  and  Mental  Health  Scientific  Working 
Group. This group, composed of basic and translational sci-
entists,  clinicians,  and  prominent  community  experts  (i.e., 
older adults living with HIV who are involved in research),

invested  in  bolstering  mental  health  for  PWLH.  During 
these  meetings,  two  community  experts  identified  older 
WLWH as a population with marked mental health dispari-
ties, namely high rates of depression. Indeed, this popula-
tion faces unique personal-level stressors (e.g., early-onset 
menopause,  social  isolation)  and  structural-level  stressors 
(e.g., discrimination, stigma, etc.), yet has been the target of 
limited intervention development and implementation. The 
study team enlisted the collaboration of members from the 
Bronx site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/Women’s 
Interagency HIV Study Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) 
to  ensure  the  project  was  engaged  in  ethical  practices  of 
women-centered HIV care [53].

Phase 2: Decision

Which  evidence-based  intervention  will  be  selected,  and 
will it be adapted or adopted?

In  phase  2,  the  study  team  selected  the  SMART/EST 
Women’s  Project  as  the  ideal  intervention  for  adaptation. 
There are limited interventions with empirical support that 
target  mental  health  comorbidities  among  WLWH.  The 
SMART/EST intervention, however, has demonstrated effi-
cacy in reducing depressive symptoms, enhancing quality of 
life, and improving myriad health-related outcomes. While 
SMART/EST  has  demonstrated  efficacy,  it  is  unclear  how 
feasible the intervention may be via teletherapy. Therefore, 
the  study  team  decided  to  adapt,  not  adopt,  SMART/EST 
and  develop  the  e-SMART/EST  teletherapy  iteration.  The 
adaptation  goals  included  reducing  sessions  from  16  to  8, 
focusing primarily on depression, trialing a teletherapy ver-
sion,  and  integrating  themes  related  to  minority  stressors 
and intersecting stigma.

Phase 3: Administration

What novel methods can be used to adapt the intervention?
In  Phase  3,  we  engaged  in  a  pre-testing  methodol-
ogy  known  as  ‘theater  testing’  to  adapt  SMART/EST  into 
e-SMART/EST. The study team met with two focus groups 
composed of four older WLWH, held online via Zoom. The 
primary goal of these theater tests was to collect critiques of 
the existing intervention and identify suggestions for adap-
tation.  Participants  were  identified  through  their  personal 
or professional experience working with other WLWH; for 
example, one participant was a seasoned peer educator for 
older WLHW. During the theater testing phase, participants 
were given a description of the intervention, including the 
goals, session format, and session content/themes. The study 
team then elicited reactions to study content and materials to 
assess their reactions and identify recommendations for the 
additional  adaptation,  including  strengths  and  drawbacks, 

4083

topics that were relevant or irrelevant, and overall feasibil-
ity, appropriateness, and acceptability. Given the purpose of 
the  trial,  the  study  team  inquired  about  new  and  existing 
challenges faced by older WLWH and how the intervention 
may address such difficulties. Theater testing sessions were 
recorded  and  transcribed,  and  participants  were  compen-
sated for their time.

Following the focus groups, the research team analyzed 
the  qualitative  data  to  identify  themes  and  recommenda-
tions. The results of semi-structured interviews prompted the 
addition or emphasis of important themes to integrate such 
as grief and loss, the impacts of race and racism on qual-
ity  of  life,  sex  and  sexuality,  anger  and  assertiveness,  and 
isolation in the age of COVID. The groups emphasized the 
importance of providing participants with information about 
HIV-related resources to ameliorate the impact of isolation, 
and recommended utilizing multiple therapeutic modalities 
such as mindfulness in addition to psychoeducation.

Phase 4: Production

What should the first draft of the intervention manual con-
sist of?

In  Phase  4,  the  study  team  created  a  first  draft  of  the 
adapted e-SMART/EST manual. To adapt rather than adopt, 
the  study  team  retained  the  framework  and  core  content 
of  the  SMART/EST  Women’s  Project,  with  some  content 
and timeline amendments made to better address concerns 
specific to older WLWH. In line with feedback from focus 
group members provided during theater testing in Phase 3, 
we condensed the intervention from 16 to 8 sessions based 
on  concerns  that  longer  trials  were  burdensome  for  older 
adults. In the Production phase, we created an initial draft 
of  the  e-SMART/EST  manual  with  eight  sessions,  includ-
ing some that incorporated new themes suggested by focus 
group  members:  aging,  anger,  and  assertiveness  for  older 
women of color (Session 3); grief, loss, and coping (Session 
4); and dating, sex, and love (Session 7). Practical recom-
mendations  from  the  focus  groups,  such  as  holding  ses-
sions after 5pm and making reminder calls, were integrated 
to  enhance  accessibility.  Further,  we  incorporated  on-call 
technological  support  and  Zoom  training  given  some  par-
ticipants  may  not  be  familiar  with  using  videoconference 
software.

Phase 5: Topical Experts

Who can assist with the adaptation?

In Phase 5, we enlisted the topical expertise of a Licensed 
Psychologist who conducted SMART/EST III to inform fur-
ther  adaptation  and  co-facilitate  the  pilot  group  alongside 
our second topical expert, a Peer Counselor with decades of 

AIDS and Behavior (2024) 28:4079–40931 34084

experience supporting older WLWH. The Psychologist rec-
ommended  incorporating  mindfulness-based  stress  reduc-
tion  (MBSR)  techniques  and  recommended  incorporating 
these techniques to complement SMART/EST’s utilization 
of CBSM + and expressive-supportive communication. Spe-
cifically, this expert adapted the manual to include somatic 
stress-reduction practices with demonstrated efficacy among 
WLWH [54, 55]. The addition of MBSR was ideal for the 
adapted intervention, given its utility in reducing proximal 
minority stressors and improving self-efficacy, for example, 
among  sexual  minority  people  [56]  and  young  sexual  and 
gender minority people of color [57]. We thus incorporated 
breathing exercises, body awareness meditations, the emo-
tional  freedom  technique  (colloquially  referred  to  as  ‘tap-
ping’), and guided meditations.

Phase 6: Integration

Which elements will be integrated into the intervention?

During  the  Integration  phase,  we  integrated  feedback 
from  our  theater  testing  focus  groups  and  meetings  with 
topical experts to produce a second draft. This consisted of 
determining which elements of SMART/EST to retain and 
which  to  adapt. This  penultimate  manual  outlined  clinical 
practices for eight weekly 90-minute sessions, with content 
focused on themes with clinical and sociopolitical relevance 
for older WLWH. Sessions, outlined in Table 1, centered on 
the following themes: Session 1, Introduction to the impact 
of stress on physical and mental health; Session 2, Linking 
thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the context of minority 
stress;  Session  3, Aging,  anger  and  assertiveness;  Session 
4,  Grief,  loss,  and  coping;  Session  5,  Guilt,  self-care,  and 
social support; Session 6, Self-esteem, menopause, and lov-
ing your body; Session 7, The joy of sex and pleasure; and 
Session  8,  Review,  harm  reduction,  and  looking  forward. 
Each session followed a similar format, with four sequential 
components: (1) introduction and check in; (2) psychoedu-
cation and process; (3) putting it into practice; and (4) invi-
tation for the week ahead.

Phase 7: Training

Who needs to be trained in each role?

In  Phase  7,  the  study  team  met  with  co-facilitators  to 
plan for e-SMART/EST implementation. We met for mul-
tiple  training  sessions,  during  which  the  co-facilitators 
participated  in  supervision  and  mock  sessions,  providing 
bidirectional feedback. These training sessions provided an 
overview of the updated manual and allowed co-facilitators 
the time and opportunity to internalize the structure of the 
manual and make changes to session content. Following the 
initial training, the study team identified an ongoing training 

schedule in which the primary investigator and co-facilita-
tors  met  for  weekly  advisory  sessions.  This  group  super-
vision  involved  a  pre-group  training  refresher  (in  which 
co-facilitators discussed the content and then self-delegated 
tasks  for  the  upcoming  session),  and  a  post-group  debrief 
(in  which  the  primary  investigator  elicited  feedback  and 
provided clinical support to co-facilitators).

Phase 8: Testing

How implementable is the intervention?

After completing phases 1–7, the study team established 
a  protocol  for  online  implementation  via  Zoom,  and  pro-
vided a pre-group ‘Zoom training’ for participants. We then 
recruited eight women and administered a pre-group survey, 
followed by eight sessions of the adapted intervention and 
a  post-group  survey.  Sessions  were  recorded,  transcribed, 
and  de-identified  for  supervision,  additional  training,  and 
further  iterations  of  manual  adaptation.  The  testing  phase 
allowed  us  to  evaluate  the  acceptability,  feasibility,  and 
appropriateness  of  e-SMART/EST.  In  the  post-group  sur-
vey,  participants  completed  repeat  measures  as  well  as  a 
mixed-methods survey to elicit feedback about the interven-
tion’s content, methods, co-facilitation, and online delivery.

Methods and Results of Objective 2: Pilot 
Testing

Participant Eligibility and Recruitment

At  the  end  of  the  ADAPT-ITT  process,  we  pilot  tested 
e-SMART/EST,  a  teletherapy  trial  with  eight  women  55 
years and older living with HIV and experiencing past-year 
depressive symptoms. Recruitment was led by a Research 
Coordinator, who partnered with the Bronx site of MWCCS 
[16]  to  identify,  contact,  and  screen  women  living  with 
comorbid  HIV  and  past-year  depression.  Seventy-one 
women were identified based on past-year positive screens 
on  the  Center  for  Epidemiological  Studies-Depression 
screener (CES-D score ≥ 16) [58]. We contacted a random 
selection of 17 women initially, of whom 10 were eligible 
and consent to participate. Five of the 17 were screened out 
because  they  were  not  interested,  and  two  were  screened 
out due to having moderate to severe cognitive impairment 
(detected via a score ≥ 12 on the Telephone version of the 
Montreal  Cognitive Assessment,  or T-MoCA)  [59]. While 
10 women were screened and determined eligible, two addi-
tional participants dropped out before the group, resulting in 
a final sample of eight women.

Study  procedures  consisted  of  10  remote  visits.  The 
first  was  a  pre-group  survey,  administered  live  via  Zoom,

capturing  sociodemographic  characteristics,  depression 
symptomatology,  and  HIV-related  quality  of  life.  Partici-
pants then completed eight weekly group sessions held via 
Zoom. Following the eighth session, they completed a post-
group survey held via Zoom, completing repeated measures 
and providing reactions and recommendations to the group. 
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Protocol No. 
2021–13,391.

Measures

Sociodemographic Characteristics

During the pre-group survey, participants self-reported race 
and ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, education 
level,  annual  income,  sources  of  social  support,  age;  and 
health-related  characteristics  including  menstrual  status, 
lifetime history of AIDS  diagnosis, viral load at last visit, 
and years since diagnosed with HIV.

Engagement

Levels  of  engagement  were  measured  by  averaging  the 
number  of  sessions  participants  attended  on  average,  of 
eight, as well as the number of attendees per session.

Fidelity

To  capture  fidelity,  the  PI  coded  each  session  in  terms  of 
how closely co-facilitators adhered to the tenets and thera-
peutic approach of the e-SMART/EST manual. We created 
an adapted fidelity checklist based on a validated checklist 
from  Project  AFFIRM,  a  minority  stress  intervention  for 
sexual  and  gender  minority  adults  [60].  Each  session  was 
coded using eight indicators of fidelity, detailed in Table 3. 
Each indicator was scored from 0 to 3, for a total session 
score  of  24,  with  higher  scores  indicating  higher  fidelity. 
To improve fidelity, the PI scored each session after it was 
completed, then met with co-facilitators for clinical supervi-
sion. During these meetings, the study team make manual 
adjustments for the upcoming session and processed group 
dynamics, co-facilitation dynamics, and emergent themes.

Feasibility, Acceptability, and Appropriateness

To  measure  how  implementable  e-SMART/EST  was,  we 
used validated scales to capture three outcomes: feasibility, 
or how accessible and easy it was to engage in the group; 
acceptability,  or  how  satisfying  and  enjoyable  e-SMART/
EST was to participate in; and appropriateness, or how cul-
turally and clinically relevant e-SMART/EST was for older 
WLWH. These were captured during the post-group survey 
via three Likert-type scales: the Feasibility of Intervention 
Measure  (FIM);  Acceptability  of  Intervention  Measure 
(AIM);  and  Intervention  Appropriateness  Measure  (IAM) 
[61]. Each scale had four items with response options rang-
ing from 1, completely disagree, to 5, completely agree. The 
measure uses am established score of ‘3’ to indicate neutral 
responses  from  participants,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
positive feelings; thus, we used an average score higher than 
‘3’ to indicate successful implementation. We also captured 
participants’  perceptions  of  feasibility,  acceptability,  and 
appropriateness  via  brief,  semi-structured  interview  con-
ducted via Zoom during the post-group survey. See Table 4 
for  a  joint  display,  as  well  as  the  interview  questions  and 
demonstrative quotes for each implementation outcome.

Depression and HIV-related Quality of life

To  capture  preliminary  efficacy,  we  collected  repeat-mea-
sures data about the pilot group’s levels of depression symp-
toms  and  HIV-related  quality  of  life.  During  the  pre-  and 
post-group  surveys,  participants  completed  the  21-item 
Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI)  [62]  and  the  12-item, 
condensed  version  of  the  Medical  Outcomes  Study-HIV 
Health Survey (MOS-HIV SF-12) [63]. The BDI is one of 
the  most  utilized  scales  to  measure  depression  symptom-
atology, with scores between 0 and 13 indicating minimal 
depression, 14–19 mild, 20–28 moderate, and 29–63 severe. 
The MOS-HIV SF-12 is a commonly used scale to capture 
HIV-related  quality  of  life,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
better outcomes.

Statistical Analysis

To assess implementation outcomes, the study team calcu-
lated mean scores for feasibility (FIM), acceptability (AIM), 
and appropriateness (IAM), along with session fidelity and 
overall fidelity across eight sessions. Scores of 3 or higher 
were  considered  reflective  of  successful  implementation. 
Engagement  was  determined  by  averaging  participants’ 
attendance scores.

For qualitative data, thematic analysis was conducted by 
the study team. We applied implementation construct codes 
(i.e.,  acceptability,  feasibility,  appropriateness)  to  match 
qualitative data with quantitative outcomes. We conducted 
individual, semi-structured interviews with each participant 
who  completed  the  group.  See  Table  4  for  the  questions 
asked  during  individual  interviews.  Qualitative  data  were 
analyzed using an inductive thematic approach with three a 
priori themes: acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness. 
The coding process was led by two members of the study 
team, who applied these a priori themes to qualitative data. 
They  first  applied  themes  separately,  then  met  to  resolve 
discrepancies.

To integrate quantitative with qualitative data, we used a 
program evaluation method and a joint display (Table 4) to 
report  integrated  results.  In  exploratory  analyses,  prelimi-
nary  efficacy  was  evaluated  with  paired  dependent  t-tests 
to compare changes in depression (via the BDI) and HIV-
related  quality  of  life  (MOS-HIV  SF-12).  We  calculated 
mean differences, t-statistics, and significance (α < 0.05) for 
these outcomes, with analyses performed using SPSS.

Results of the e-SMART/EST Pilot Test

Sample Characteristics

During the testing phase, we conducted an exploratory trial 
of e-SMART/EST with a pilot sample of eight women. All 
women  identified  as  women  of  color,  with  majority  being 
African/African  American/Black  (n = 5,  62.5%),  followed 
by Hispanic/Latina/o American (n = 3, 37.5%), then Ameri-
can  Indian/Native  American  (n = 1,  12.5%).  Though  the 
group  was  open  to  cisgender  and  transgender  women,  all 
participants identified as cisgender. Six of the eight women 
(75%)  were  heterosexual/straight,  one  was  bisexual,  and 
one was lesbian. Education level ranged from ‘did not fin-
ish  high  school/GED’  (n = 2,  25%)  to  ‘finished  graduate 
school’  (n = 2,  25%),  though  most  participants  completed 
at least some trade school or college. The majority (n = 7, 
85.5%) earned between $0-$60,000 whereas one participant 
(who was employed full-time with an HIV service organi-
zation) made between $60,000-$80,000. In terms of social 

support, five women (625.5%) reported ‘other women liv-
ing with HIV’ as a primary source of support; other sources 
included family (n = 4, 50%), clinical team (n = 1, 12.5%), 
and  other  (n = 4,  50%).  When  screened,  three  women 
(37.5%)  had  no  cognitive  impairment,  while  five  (62.5%) 
were  shown  to  have  mild  cognitive  impairment.  Seven  of 
eight women were post-menopausal, while one woman had 
never  menstruated.  The  mean  age  was  59.5  years  old.  In 
terms of HIV-related characteristics, half reported they had 
been diagnosed with AIDS during their lifetime; the major-
ity (n = 7, 87.5%) had an undetectable viral load at their last 
visit; and the pilot group had been living with HIV for an 
average of 29.1 years. See Table 2.

Implementation Outcomes

Participant  feedback  about  the  group  was  highly  favor-
able  overall.  All  participants  recommended  expanding 
the  intervention  to  include  larger  groups  of  older  women 
with  comorbid  HIV  and  depression,  indicating  successful 
implementation.

Engagement. Average  weekly  attendance  was  83%  on 
average, with participants attending 6.38 of eight sessions 
on average. In qualitative interviews, participants generally 
indicated a desire for more, opposed to fewer, sessions. One 
participant (pseudonym ‘Lori,’ 59) said, “What was it, eight 
weeks? It wasn’t really enough. I would have [shared] more 
if we would’ve had more time.” Participants reported issues 
to  engagement  such  as  technical  difficulties,  scheduling 
conflicts, and health issues (e.g., feeling too tired to log on, 
or a doctor’s appointment running over time).

Fidelity (Table 3). Co-facilitators were highly adherent 
to the e-SMART/EST manual, with an average of 90% fidel-
ity across sessions. Fidelity ranged from 75% in Session 8 to 
100% in Sessions 2 and 3.

Feasibility (Table 4). Participants found the e-SMART/
EST intervention highly feasible, suggesting it was acces-
sible and easy to engage in (FIM mean = 4.22). ‘Didi’ (58) 
expressed: “I looked forward to it. I didn’t miss a group.” 
When asked about the number of sessions and time commit-
ment, participants denied concerns about treatment burden. 
‘Marlene’ (58) shared: “I make sure that my schedule was 
clear.”  ‘Desiree’  (61)  commented:  “It  needed  to  be  every 
week  […]  it  allows  you  to  build  relationship  consistency 
across the board with the other women.” Those who were 
employed reported the online modality increased their abil-
ity to attend. Some women, however, faced feasibility chal-
lenges  due  to  the  online  format.  ‘Lori’  (59),  for  example, 
lost  track  of  the  calendar  invitation  and  was  unsure  how 
to log onto Zoom: “I couldn’t get in, and I had nothing to 
do,  so  I  was  very  discouraged.”  Overall,  women  reported 
the content was easy to engage in, largely due to the slides

exercises (e.g., “[I enjoyed] the meditative part of the group, 
doing the meditation, letting go,” ‘Dawn,’ 63).

Acceptability  (Table  4).  Participants  also  found  the 
intervention  to  be  highly  acceptable  (AIM  mean = 4.06), 
suggesting it was satisfying, enjoyable, and easy to engage 
in.  Highlights  identified  in  qualitative  interviews  included 
the sense of community, peer co-facilitation, and the MBSR 
techniques.  ‘Dawn’  (63)  noted  the  sense  of  comradery  in 
the group: “I enjoyed the group immensely. Interacting with 
the ladies, being able to be personal with [the facilitators]. 
We’re  all  on  an  even  keel.”  Many  women  were  struck  by 
the  invitation  for  open  dialogue  about  HIV  and  intersec-
tional issues. As ‘Paula’ (67) said: “I love the group. It gives 
me a chance to open up about things that I’ve been going 
through  that  I  don’t  have  a  chance  to  speak  [about]  with 
other people.” ‘Desiree’ noted: “I like attending group more 
than going to the doctor […] that’s why I go to group. To 
learn,  interact,  build  community.”  Key  aspects  enhancing 
acceptability included: peer co-facilitation (e.g., “It needs to 
be a peer facilitator there,” ‘Desiree,’ 61) and mindfulness 

Another  highlight  was  the  chance  for  expressive  emo-
tional communication as a counterbalance to shame related 
to  HIV,  aging,  and  menopause.  ‘Paula’  (67)  described:  “I 
really enjoyed it because it gave me a chance to speak my 
feelings where I don’t have to feel ashamed.” ‘Marlene’ (58) 
agreed: “With COVID and depression […] we do need an 
outlet. We need someone, some place to talk, to hear other 
people’s  stories  and  ways  to  cope.”  As  ‘Didi’  (58)  said, 
“[The group] helped me connect with others who have the 
virus  living  through  different  circumstances.  […]  People 
do  need  people  to  talk  to.  They  need  somebody  to  reach 
out to […] We all got same issues.” Expressive emotional 
communication was especially helpful for contending with 
minority stressors,. ‘Lori’ (59) said: “It helped me to think 
about some of the things us females go through […] if you 
listen, you’ll learn from others […] and it’ll probably take 
you a little further.”

Appropriateness  (Table  4).  Last,  the  intervention  was 
highly  appropriate  (IAM  mean = 4.25),  suggesting  it  was 

AIDS and Behavior (2024) 28:4079–40931 34090

culturally  and  clinically  relevant  for  older  WLWH.  Par-
ticipants found the session themes, peer-based model, and 
group dialogue especially relevant. ‘Desiree’ (61) noted: “I 
thought the topics were really relevant to women of color. 
There’s additional stressors […] African Americans endure 
just because we’re Black people living in this country […] 
so  I  think  that  was  real  relevant.”  The  co-facilitation  for-
mat was seen as crucial to ensuring older WLWH found the 
group to be relevant. ‘Marlene’ (58) said: “They work hand-
in-hand with each other, and I like that, and I really enjoyed 
that. They had a good bond, and I noticed the chemistry was 
very  good.”  Having  an  out  and  proud  peer  co-facilitating 
the  group  balanced  perceived  mistrust  or  hesitancy  and 
ensured participants felt the group was made ‘for us, by us.’ 
As ‘Didi’ (58) said:

If [the peer facilitator] wasn’t there, then how would 
[the Psychologist] be able to understand that it could 
be a stigma? A lot of women […] expressed what they 
was going through. She was facilitating the group and 
yeah, she was doing a very good job.

Key  session  topics  such  as  menopause,  anger,  and  grief 
increased perceived appropriateness of the group. Multiple 
participants recommended additional themes such as moth-
erhood  and  family  building  to  increase  the  relevance  for 
other older women.

Preliminary  efficacy.  Though  results  of  the  pre-
post-group  t-tests  were  nonsignificant,  mean  depression 
scores  decreased  nominally  from  16.0  (SD = 7.7)  to  13.88 
(SD = 8.9). HIV-related quality of life (MOS-HIV SF-12v2) 
showed  nominal  increase  from  79.9  (SD = 15.5)  to  80.5 
(SD = 14.2).

Discussion

Preliminary  results  from  the  e-SMART/EST  pilot  under-
score  the  need  for  accessible,  culturally  relevant  group 
interventions  for  older  women  with  HIV  and  comorbid 
depression. Given high ratings of acceptability, results sug-
gest participants valued e-SMART/EST as a vital resource 
to address issues including complex grief, stigma, and social 
isolation  associated  with  aging  with  HIV. While  we  faced 
challenges  related  to  technological  literacy,  privacy  con-
cerns, and emotional distancing due to the online format, the 
group  positively  received  the  content,  peer  co-facilitation, 
and  the  emphasis  on  resilience  and  mindfulness.  We  thus 
offer key lessons learned for future interventions promoting 
holistic health for older WLWH.

First, much of the success of the pilot intervention was due 
to  its  women-centered,  community-participatory  approach 

to HIV research and care [2, 53], [64]. From conceptualiza-
tion to adaptation to pilot testing, we centered the needs and 
expertise  of  older  WLWH.  In  early  meetings,  our  theater 
testing group identified the objectives of the study, encour-
aging a meaningful intervention to target depression among 
older WLWH. Rather than extract their expertise, we hired 
experts into paid leadership roles through which they led the 
adaptation process using the ADAPT-ITT model [29]. This 
process was clinically and socio-politically meaningful for 
all involved. Most critically, the inclusion of a trained peer 
co-facilitator as a co-facilitator was a key ingredient for the 
group and was critical to building trust, rapport, and genuine 
engagement.

Second,  we  recommend  future  interventions  with  older 
WLWH  incorporate  culturally  adapted  mindfulness-based 
techniques.  Each  session  of  e-SMART/EST  concluded 
with  a  guided  meditation  or  related  mindfulness  interven-
tion,  which  participants  described  favorably  as  a  key  tool 
to  target  the  cognitive,  emotional,  and  somatic  sequala  of 
living with HIV and depression. Based on recommendations 
from  studies  with  Black  and  other  women  of  color  living 
with HIV [54, 55], co-facilitators chose meditations led by 
older women of color that explicitly addressed the impact 
of sexism, racism, and aging on women’s bodies and holis-
tic health. The acceptability of MBSR interventions suggest 
further  evidence  for  their  utility  to  improve  self-efficacy 
among PLWH [65].

Third, e-SMART/EST addressed the processes by which 
older  WLWH  internalize  intersectional  stigmas  related 
to  HIV,  racism,  sexism,  and  ageism.  Co-facilitators,  for 
example, provided psychoeducation on structural determi-
nants of mental health and led interventions to foster criti-
cal  consciousness  and  empowerment.  This  focus  enabled 
participants  to  locate  the  source  of  distress  within  a  soci-
etal context, rather than focusing myopically on individual 
or  intrapsychic  drivers. We  recommend  a  similar  focus  in 
future interventions, particularly given the proliferation of 
stigma  and  disempowerment  among  older  WLWH  [51], 
[66].

Finally, while the use of teletherapy may increase access 
for  older  populations,  it  also  presents  specific  challenges 
for older WLWH. The varying technological support needs 
of  participants,  ranging  from  none  to  weekly  assistance, 
imposed  demands  and  raised  equity  concerns  [31].  Fur-
ther, participants appreciated how easy it was to attend the 
group from home, yet also reported yearning for in-person 
connection after the pilot ended. While teletherapy should 
continue to be a focus for the initial engagement of diverse

Conclusions

Limitations

This pilot study had notable limitations. First, it was con-
ducted  with  a  small  sample  and  a  single  test,  lacking  the 
statistical  power  necessary  for  broader  conclusions  and 
highlighting  the  need  for  larger-scale,  randomized-con-
trolled trials to evaluate the intervention’s efficacy more rig-
orously. Despite this small sample, this study contributed to 
the literature by providing a more culturally-relevant adap-
tation  of  the  ‘SMART/EST  Women’s  Project,’  including 
information  and  feedback  from  key  stakeholders.  Results 
also suggest that this psychotherapy group was feasible for 
this small sample of older WLWH; thus, future research my 
choose  to  replicate  this  project  with  a  larger  sample  size. 
Indeed,  our  pilot  sample  of  eight  women  was  very  small. 
The study team does not intend to draw broader conclusions 
about the generalizability of the current study nor the men-
tal health of older WLWH in general from this very small 
pilot  sample.  Second,  the  absence  of  a  control  or  waitlist 
condition  in  this  pilot  indicates  the  importance  of  such 
designs  in  future  research. Additionally,  participants  were 
recruited from the MWCCS study, which may have intro-
duced sampling bias as these women were already engaged 
in HIV-related research. Findings from the study thus may 
not be generalizable to less research-engaged older WLWH. 
Third, data collection occurred shortly after the pilot with-
out a long-term follow-up, and thus there may have been a 
‘halo effect’ whereby participants rated the intervention as 
successful due to its recent implementation. Future full-trial 
iterations would ideally include longitudinal follow-up and 
extended assessments periods to more fully measure imple-
mentation outcomes and preliminary efficacy. Fourth, while 
qualitative interviews queried about acceptability, feasibil-
ity, and appropriateness, the study team did not elicit further 
phenomenological detail about our participants’ HIV-related 
quality  of  life.  Such  questions  would  have  deepened  our 
understanding of the impact of aging with HIV among this 
pilot group and, as such, should be central to future itera-
tions  of  this  line  of  research.  Finally,  technological  chal-
lenges, including connectivity issues and the distractions of 
remote  participation,  were  encountered.  These  limited  the 
ease  of  feasibility,  yet  also  provided  valuable  lessons  for 
refining the e-SMART/EST and similar teletherapy groups 
with older WLWH.

Despite its limitations, this study underscores the potential 
of teletherapy for older WLWH: a highly resilient group fac-
ing intersecting social determinants of mental health. Future 
research  should  involve  larger,  more  diverse  samples  to 
comprehensively  evaluate  the  intervention’s  effectiveness 
on  mental  and  physical  health  outcomes.  Demonstrating 
efficacy in larger studies, particularly regarding depression 
and quality of life, could position this group as a key modal-
ity for accessible mental health services with this growing 
demographic.

Acknowledgements  First, we acknowledge the leadership and incred-
ible resilience of the growing cohort of older women living with HIV. In 
particular, we acknowledge the support of multiple community experts 
who contributed to the design and implementation of the e-SMART/
EST Women’s Project. Second, we acknowledge the expert guidance 
of Dr. Jonathan Tobin, whose leadership in health equity and commu-
nity-academic team science was instrumental to the adaptation of the 
SMART/EST Women’s Project for implementation online with older 
women living with HIV and depression. Data in this manuscript were 
collected  by  the  MACS/WIHS  Combined  Cohort  Study  (MWCCS).
