Abstract

Page 2

Purpose: The number of cancer survivors worldwide is growing, with over 15.5 million cancer 
survivors in the United States alone – a figure expected to double in the coming decades. 
Cancer survivors face unique health challenges as a result of their cancer diagnosis and the 
impact of treatments on their physical and mental well-being. For example, cancer survivors 
often experience declines in physical functioning and quality of life, while facing an increased 
risk of cancer recurrence and all-cause mortality compared to persons without cancer. The 2010 
American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable was among the first reports to conclude that 
cancer survivors could safely engage in enough exercise training to improve physical fitness and 
restore physical functioning, enhance quality of life, and mitigate cancer-related fatigue.

Methods: A second Roundtable was convened in 2018 to advance exercise recommendations 
beyond public health guidelines and toward prescriptive programs specific to cancer type, 
treatments and/or outcomes.

Results: Overall findings retained the conclusions that exercise training and testing was 
generally safe for cancer survivors and that every survivor should “avoid inactivity”. Enough 
evidence was available to conclude that specific doses of aerobic, combined aerobic plus 
resistance training, and/or resistance training could improve common cancer-related health 
outcomes, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, physical functioning, and health­
related quality of life. Implications for other outcomes, such as peripheral neuropathy and 
cognitive functioning, remain uncertain.

Conclusions: The proposed recommendations should serve as a guide for the fitness and health 
care professional working with cancer survivors. More research is needed to fill remaining gaps in 
knowledge in order to better serve cancer survivors, as well as fitness and healthcare professionals, 
to improve clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, the United States has seen a 27% decline in cancer deaths due to early 
detection and improved treatments for cancer. In turn, the number of cancer survivors is 
growing, with over 15.5 million cancer survivors in the United States - a figure that is 
expected to double by 2040(1). Improved prognosis has created a growing need to address 
the unique health issues facing cancer survivors that result from the disease, its treatment, 
and related comorbid conditions. For example, the symptom of fatigue can persist in 25% 
of cancer survivors many years after their treatment has ended and contributes to difficulty 
returning to work, independent living and poor quality of life(2). Furthermore, risk of 
developing of heart disease may be elevated by some cancer treatments and cardiovascular 
mortality is emerging as a major competing cause of death in cancer survivors along with 
cancer recurrence(3, 4). Cancer is also a disease strongly linked with aging, and almost 
half of survivors are older than 70 years(5). The adverse synergistic effects of age, cancer 
treatment, and related sequelae increase the total burden of cancer. Historically, clinicians

advised cancer patients to rest and to avoid physical activity, but early exercise research in 
the 1990’s and 2000’s challenged this advice.

In 2010 the American College of Sports Medicine convened a Roundtable meeting 
composed of a team of clinical and research experts in the field of cancer and exercise 
to develop the first set of exercise guidelines for cancer survivors(6). Drawing on studies 
mainly in breast and prostate cancer survivors, the key findings from this review were that 
exercise training was generally safe and well tolerated during and after cancer treatment 
and could elicit improvements in some health outcomes. There was sufficient evidence 
to conclude that exercise could improve physical fitness, physical functioning, quality of 
life, and cancer-related fatigue. However, given the limited number of rigorously designed 
studies at that time, there was insufficient evidence to inform specific exercise prescriptions 
for any of these outcomes nor by cancer site or treatment type. Thus, the 2010 Roundtable 
recommendations largely followed the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for adults with 
chronic conditions to aim for at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic activity, two or 
more days a week of resistance training, and stretch major muscles groups daily when 
possible, with specific exercise testing and program modifications based on health status and 
cancer and treatment-related side effects(7). At a minimum, survivors were urged to “avoid 
inactivity” and be as physically active as possible(6).

The 2010 ACSM recommendations came with the expectation that they would be updated 
as the evidence grew and indeed, since that landmark publication the number of randomized 
controlled exercise trials in cancer survivors has increased by 281% (PubMed Search 
completed March 2018) to over 2500 published randomized controlled trials. Moreover, an 
increasing number of calls for the integration of exercise into clinical cancer care have since 
been issued (8–11). Thus, in 2018 the ACSM International, Multidisciplinary Roundtable 
on Physical Activity and Cancer Prevention and Control was convened to bring together an 
international group of exercise and rehabilitation professionals and organizations with the 
goal to update recommendations based on current evidence. The Roundtable meeting took 
place on March 12–13, 2018 in San Francisco, California, USA, with 40 representatives 
from twenty organizations across the world who came together to sponsor and attend this 
meeting (Table 1). Roundtable members were invited to participate based on their clinical 
and scientific expertise and were asked to contribute in one or more of the following areas: 
1) Role of exercise in cancer prevention and control; 2) Efficacy of exercise to improve 
cancer-related health outcomes (acute, late and long-term effects); and, 3) Translation of 
evidence into the clinical and community settings. The outcome of the work in each of these 
areas would be three separate, but related publications. The manuscripts were circulated to 
professional organizations for review and to obtain their official endorsement.

This paper will update evidence-based guidelines for exercise testing, prescription 
and delivery in cancer survivors. As it was acknowledged that the general exercise 
recommendations put forward in 2010 may be unachievable for cancer survivors with 
physical limitations and that benefits may come from less exercise, a particular goal of 
the 2018 Roundtable was to develop more granular exercise prescriptions for distinct cancer­
related health outcomes to better guide fitness and other healthcare professionals who train 
or care for cancer survivors. In the following sections we: 1) describe the evidence review

process and decisions for generating exercise prescriptions for specific cancer-related health 
outcomes; 2) provide evidence-based FITT (frequency, intensity, time, type) prescriptions 
for outcomes with sufficient evidence (as outlined below); and 3) provide updates to 
the 2010 guidelines around exercise testing and training, including special considerations 
and safety precautions, specific to cancer survivors. We conclude by acknowledging the 
limitations of this latest Roundtable and suggest directions for future updates.

2.  UPDATE TO EVIDENCE-INFORMED EXERCISE PRESCRIPTIONS

2.1  Overview

Two a priori decisions were made by consensus at the Roundtable Meeting. The first was to 
develop a list of cancer-related health outcomes with a high degree of clinical relevance for 
which exercise may have therapeutic benefit (BOX 1). The second was to focus the review 
of evidence primarily on traditional modalities of exercise including aerobic, resistance or 
combined aerobic plus resistance training on relevant health outcomes. A brief discussion on 
other modalities of exercise (e.g., yoga) is provided at the end of the paper. Three additional 
decisions were made by the writing team early on in the writing process where it was agreed 
upon by consensus that: 1) components of physical fitness (e.g., aerobic capacity, muscular 
strength/endurance) would not be categorized as cancer-health related outcomes, but would 
be used to evaluate the adaptability and responsiveness of cancer survivors to specific modes 
of exercise training; 2) exercise prescriptions would only be generated for outcomes where 
there was sufficient evidence on the efficacy of exercise to improve a given outcome; 3) 
beyond each outcome, the exercise prescriptions could not be further specified by tumor 
type, phase of treatment or type of treatment due to the lack of sufficient evidence to do so in 
a robust manner. The implications of these limitations are discussed later in the paper.

2.2  Methodology for Evidence Review

To efficiently evaluate and provide a rich synthesis of the evidence, a review of published 
randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses for cancer-related health 
outcomes (Box 1) using Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, CINAHL, the Physical Therapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and the 
Cochrane Collaboration. A search was conducted from June-August 2018, for papers 
published as of June 1, 2018, using standardized search terms for cancer and exercise, 
in combination with search terms for the list of key cancer-related health outcomes 
(Supplemental Materials). For each outcome, two writing team members reviewed the 
resulting systematic reviews and meta-analyses to identify the most recent, relevant, and 
high quality publications that could facilitate evaluation of the state of science around 
efficacy of exercise for a particular outcome. If no systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
were identified, the available RCTs were reviewed.

A decision framework adapted from the Dutch Physical Activity Guidelines(12) was applied 
to first determine whether or not there was sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that 
exercise improved specific outcomes and in turn, warrant generation of an evidence-based 
FITT prescription (Figure 1). Evidence for a given outcome was judged to be strong 
when there were a substantial number of RCTs (≥5), the aggregate sample size was large

(n>150), and the beneficial effect of exercise was observed consistently across studies. For 
outcomes with a smaller number of RCTs (<5) or where the overall effect of exercise was 
inconsistently observed or null, the level of evidence for an exercise benefit was judged as 
insufficient. For such cases, a FITT prescription was not generated and only a summary of 
current evidence and research recommendations were provided.

During the review process, authors felt that an intermediate category should be considered 
for outcomes with >5 RCTs and an aggregate sample >150, yet heterogeneity for evidence 
of an effect in cancer survivors. In these cases, if there were a consistent number of high 
quality RCTs (designed and powered on the outcome of interest as the primary endpoint) 
and that reported findings that were congruent with established evidence on the same 
outcome in non-cancer populations, the evidence of exercise benefit for these outcomes was 
judged as moderate and a FITT prescription was generated. However, more research would 
be needed to confirm the exercise recommendation for these outcomes in cancer survivors.

The next step was to define exercise prescriptions that conformed to the FITT formula and 
outlined the type and dose of exercise expected to improve a given outcome. To streamline 
the process, the evidence used to inform each exercise prescription was derived from high 
quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses which also often provided separate analyses 
on efficacy by FITT components to identify the most optimal exercise type, time, intensity 
or frequency to improve a given outcome. However, if the quality of systematic reviews 
was deemed low (AMSTAR rating <7), individual high-quality RCTs were used to derive 
the prescription. FITT prescriptions and accompanying summary of the literature, which 
informed them, were presented to the full writing team during a series of conference calls 
for discussion and expert consensus (September – October 2018).

2.3  Strong Evidence

For the following cancer-related health outcomes, there was consensus that benefit has been 
consistently demonstrated and a FITT prescription was developed. Details of each FITT 
prescription, including any unique considerations, by outcome are provided in Table 2. 
When interpreting and applying a prescription, the exercise professional should be mindful 
that the evidence is often disproportionately from trials in a single cancer type (i.e., breast), 
but the prescription is assumed to generalize across cancer types unless otherwise specified. 
In addition, studies often did not specifically target enrollment of individuals with the 
poorest initial values of an outcome (e.g, high fatigue, low bone density) thus the efficacy of 
a FITT prescription may or may not generalize to cancer survivors in greatest need.

2.3.1  Anxiety—A dose of moderate intensity aerobic training three times per week for 
12 weeks or twice weekly combined aerobic plus resistance training for 6–12 weeks can 
significantly reduce anxiety in cancer survivors during and after treatment(13–17). Based on 
sufficient evidence, it does not appear that resistance training alone reduces anxiety. There 
is not sufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a dose response relationship 
between exercise intensity and changes in anxiety. Improvements in anxiety appear to be 
greater in supervised training programs or those having a larger supervised component than 
those that are predominantly unsupervised or home-based.

2.3.2  Depressive Symptoms.—Moderate intensity aerobic training performed three 
times per week and for at least 12 weeks or twice weekly combined aerobic plus 
resistance training lasting 6–12 weeks can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in 
cancer survivors during and after treatment(18, 19). Based on sufficient evidence, resistance 
training alone does not seem to be effective for this outcome. Based on results from 
high quality trials of aerobic training, there may be a dose-response effect where higher 
volumes of aerobic exercise (90 min vs. up to 180 min/week) leads to better symptom 
reduction. Improvements in depressive symptoms appear to be greater in supervised training 
programs or those having a larger supervised component than those that are predominantly 
unsupervised or home-based.

2.3.3  Fatigue—For training programs that last at least 12 weeks, engaging in moderate 
intensity aerobic training three times per week can significantly reduce cancer-related 
fatigue both during and after treatment(20–23). Moderate intensity combined aerobic plus 
resistance training sessions performed 2–3 times per week or twice weekly moderate 
intensity resistance training may also be effective(21, 24–26), and the latter particularly in 
prostate cancer(27). The effect of exercise was strongest for moderate to vigorous intensity 
exercise whereas the effect for low intensity training was weak and this level of exercise 
is unlikely to reduce fatigue(22, 24, 26, 28). Whether or not more exercise translates to 
less cancer-related fatigue remains unclear, though there is suggestive evidence that the 
reductions in fatigue are greater with exercise sessions longer than 30 minutes and programs 
longer than 12 weeks compared to less exercise(29). There is insufficient evidence for a 
linear dose response since going beyond 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise does 
not appear to result in the greatest reductions in fatigue. The efficacy of exercise for this 
outcome appears to be independent of the level of supervision and/or setting for training(21, 
27, 30).

2.3.4  Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL)—Combined moderate intensity 
aerobic and resistance exercise performed 2–3 times per week for at least 12 weeks results 
in improvements in HRQoL both during and after treatment(17, 31, 32). The benefit of 
combined aerobic plus resistance training programs appears more potent than programs 
consisting of only aerobic or resistance training(32). Though enough evidence favored the 
efficacy of exercise to improve HRQoL, it should be noted that this particular outcome is 
a construct that encompasses many factors and may have a more variable response than by 
individual domains. For example, improvements seems to be more robust if the physical 
functioning domain of HRQoL is the primary outcome and this will be covered separately. 
Improvements in HRQoL appear to be greater in supervised training programs or those 
having a larger supervised component than those that are predominantly unsupervised or 
home-based.

2.3.5  Lymphedema—There is a history of clinical recommendations to refrain from 
aerobic or resistance training in order to avoid onset or exacerbation of lymphedema(33, 34). 
For this particular outcome, an evidence-based exercise prescription is designed for safety 
or no harm, versus the benefit of exercise to prevent lymphedema or improve lymphedema 
symptoms, and limited to addressing upper extremity breast cancer-related lymphedema(35–

37). For resistance training, a general progressive program focused on large muscle groups 
performed 2–3 times per week, with the principle of “start low, progress slow” is safe 
when supervised by a fitness professional(38–42). Insufficient evidence exists to conclude 
whether or not starting a resistance training program without supervised instruction is safe 
for women with or at risk for lymphedema after breast cancer. To date, there is insufficient 
evidence to draw conclusions for aerobic exercise. In general, aerobic exercise seems to be 
safe, with no significant increase in number of lymphedema-related adverse events reported 
in studies investigating aerobic exercise(17). Based on preliminary evidence(43), the effects 
seen in breast cancer may not translate for lymphedema following head and neck, bladder, 
melanoma, gynecologic, or other cancer sites.

2.3.6  Physical Function—Moderate intensity aerobic training, resistance training or 
combined aerobic plus resistance training performed three times weekly for 8–12 weeks 
can significantly improve self-reported physical function(31, 32, 44). Broadly, supervised 
exercise appears to be more effective than unsupervised or home-based interventions(32), 
although unsupervised programs may be effective in older cancer survivors(44). Further, 
there is some evidence to suggest that if the intervention is unsupervised, physical function 
could improve with higher weekly energy expenditure (MET-hr/week) but not weekly 
exercise duration (min/week)(32). It should be noted that these results are based on 
self-reported physical function, not objective measures where the evidence base on these 
outcomes remains immature and more challenging to aggregate due to the variation and 
limitations of assessment techniques.

2.4  Moderate Evidence

2.4.1  Bone Health—Two recent systematic reviews in cancer survivors concluded that 
across all trials the evidence for exercise to improve bone health is inconsistent(45, 46), 
though RCTs that were designed with bone health as the primary outcome were largely 
consistent with the exercise recommendations in the ACSM Position Stand for exercise 
and bone health(47). In cancer, the majority of evidence is derived from trials in breast 
and prostate cancer patients in the post-adjuvant treatment setting, which indicates that a 
one-year supervised program of combined moderate-vigorous intensity resistance plus high 
impact training (i.e., exercise that generates ground reaction forces above 3–4 times body 
weight) performed 2–3 days per week is the most consistently efficacious modality of 
exercise to improve bone health (e.g., slow loss or slightly improve bone mineral density at 
the lumbar spine and hip). In contrast, aerobic training, particularly walking, does not appear 
to provide a sufficient stimulus to improve bone outcomes, results that are consistent with 
RCTs in persons without cancer. There is insufficient evidence to determine if resistance 
training alone improves bone outcomes.

In non-cancer populations, whether or not resistance plus impact training programs are 
safe for individuals with osteoporosis remains controversial(48), thus at this time this 
exercise prescription may not be safe for cancer survivors with bone fragility associated 
with osteoporosis or bony metastases in the hip or spine (see section 5). Furthermore, it may 
not be appropriate for individuals with joint/orthopedic issues and/or stability problems who

may be better served by an exercise program aimed at reducing fall risk. Further research is 
needed to confirm that this recommendation is effective and safe for cancer survivors.

2.4.2  Sleep—Two recent systematic reviews in cancer survivors(49, 50) provided mixed 
evidence for overall sleep quality, indicating either a positive effect of walking(49), or no 
effect of exercise(50). Four recent RCTs not included in either systematic review have 
shown consistent evidence of small to moderate effect sizes on overall sleep quality for 
aerobic training(51), in addition to walking specifically(52, 53) and one study reported 
evidence of benefit for resistance training(31). In non-cancer populations, there is strong 
evidence that moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic training is associated with better overall 
sleep quality in the general population(54) and there was some evidence showing benefit 
for specific characteristics of sleep, such as total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and sleep 
efficiency. Overall, moderate intensity aerobic training, particularly walking, 3–4 times per 
week, for 30–40 minutes per session over 12 weeks is recommended.

2.5 

Insufficient Evidence

Insufficient evidence for a specific outcome does not mean that cancer survivors facing these 
cancer-related health outcomes will not benefit in other ways from engaging in physical 
activity or should remain sedentary. Rather there is insufficient evidence showing that 
exercise is beneficial for these specific outcomes based on current evidence and this creates 
an obvious gap in knowledge the research community must fill.

2.5.1  Cardiotoxicity—The effect of exercise to prevent or ameliorate cardiotoxicity is an 
emerging field of research and promising results for a protective effect of exercise in animal 
models and some novel evidence in humans for cardiac function(55), including measures of 
left ventricular function(55), and vascular endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated 
dilation(56). More research is needed to understand the impact of various types of cancer, 
cancer treatments and exercise prescriptions on both cardiac and vascular function.

2.5.2  Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy—To date, there are too few 
high quality trials to interpret the potential of the benefits of exercise for preventing and/or 
managing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and related side effects, such as 
balance impairment and falls(57). In general, exercise appeared safe in the few published 
studies, however, the degree of improvement varied for this outcome, and other related 
outcomes, such as mobility and balance. Future research should include well controlled 
exercise interventions with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy as a primary 
outcome, using both patient-reported outcomes and objective assessment of neuropathy, 
balance and mobility, and also rigorously evaluate the safety of training in this group due to 
the known risk of falls.

2.5.3  Cognitive function—While promising results from animal studies are emerging 
for a protective effect of aerobic training on cancer treatment related changes in cognitive 
function, to date, the evidence in humans is limited(58). The majority of human studies, 
so far, have been conducted in breast cancer survivors, using self-reported measures of 
cognitive function, and report inconsistent results. While there is compelling evidence

of a positive effect of exercise on cognitive function in older adults and other clinical 
populations(59), specific to cancer, more research is needed in cancer survivors where 
cognitive function is the primary outcome, and this outcome is assessed by both self­
reported and standardized objective measures of cognitive function.

2.5.4  Falls—There are no randomized controlled trials to date in cancer survivors with 
falls as a primary endpoint. There are several challenges to this type of research, including 
the relatively rare occurrence of falls and the large sample and time needed to observe a 
change in falls from an intervention. Similarly, the causes of falls associated with cancer 
treatment have not been fully characterized and may be due to more than an acceleration 
of the risks associated with age-related falls (i.e., muscle weakness and poor balance), 
but may also be due to treatment-related toxicities such as hearing loss, ataxia, peripheral 
neuropathies and fatigue, creating a challenge to develop new exercise-based approaches 
to fall prevention. In the absence of any evidence-based fall prevention studies in cancer 
survivors, it seems reasonable to consider standard fall prevention exercise approaches that 
reduce the risk of age-related falls for cancer survivors with a fall history to at least reduce 
the risk of falls that may be associated with advanced age(60, 61).

2.5.5  Nausea—While a commonly reported benefit of exercise during chemotherapy, 
there is limited data from high quality trials with nausea as a primary endpoint to support 
this finding outside of an early study demonstrating a reduction by Winningham et al.(62). 
Future research could examine the effect of well controlled exercise interventions on nausea 
in highly emetogenic regimens to determine if there is an effect. These studies should 
account for antiemetic use, duration and intensity of nausea, and function.

2.5.6  Pain—To date most published controlled trials in cancer survivors have examined 
non-specific pain, and included pain as a secondary outcome, which limits the interpretation 
of the research. There is early evidence from two high-quality controlled trials where pain 
was the primary outcome that a combined home-based aerobic plus supervised resistance 
training intervention in women with breast cancer significantly reduced arthralgia associated 
with aromatase inhibiter therapy(63) and a supervised resistance training intervention 
focused on the upper extremity significantly reduced in shoulder pain in individuals with 
head and neck cancer(64). However, more research is needed specifically focused on cancer­
related pain. Survivors may be able to exercise with pain that is tolerable and not worsened 
by exercise; however, modification or omission of individual exercises that exacerbate pain 
may be necessary.

2.5.7  Sexual Function—The majority of research to date has been in men with prostate 
cancer(65, 66) and there is insufficient evidence from controlled trials investigating the 
effect of exercise on sexual function during or after cancer therapy. Early promising 
results for a positive effect of exercise on sexual function among prostate cancer patients 
treated with androgen deprivation therapy has been reported in some trials(67, 68) but not 
others(69). While there is compelling evidence of a positive effect of exercise on sexual 
function in the general population, for both women(70) and men(71), the significant effects 
of cancer therapies on hormonal and anatomical/functional changes (i.e., nerve sparing

versus non-nerve sparing surgeries in prostate cancer) preclude the ability to extrapolate 
those findings to the cancer population.

2.5.8  Treatment Tolerance—Treatment tolerance (i.e., completion of or adherence to 
planned therapy) is a complex outcome that likely varies by cancer type, treatment modality 
(i.e., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy), and even specific 
drug(s) and protocols. Consequently, determining the effects of exercise on “treatment 
tolerance” is a challenging goal and may make it difficult to achieve a high degree of 
generalizability. A recent systematic review of exercise and chemotherapy completion rate 
concluded that, while promising, the evidence for an exercise benefit to chemotherapy 
tolerance is insufficient(72). The effects of exercise on treatment tolerance for radiation 
therapy, hormonal therapy (i.e., aromatase inhibitors or androgen deprivation therapy), 
targeted therapies or immunotherapy is currently unknown. To understand the effect of 
exercise on treatment tolerance, studies would need to be conducted for each combination of 
cancer type and treatment regimen.

2.6  Limitations

The FITT prescriptions provided for several outcomes aim to serve as guidelines for fitness 
and healthcare professionals working with cancer survivors. However, the development 
of these guidelines had some key limitations that should be kept in mind when working 
with individual clients. The majority of available literature is still in the most common 
cancers, namely early stage breast cancer and prostate cancers, which limits the ability 
to extrapolate to other cancer types or advanced cancers. Though, it could be reasonably 
assumed that in the absence of any unique safety concerns for survivors of other types of 
cancer that the efficacy of exercise on various outcomes would be similar for survivors 
with early stage cancers other than breast and prostate cancer. However, differences among 
cancer survivors by cancer type are known to exist (i.e., demographics, prognosis, treatments 
received and associated side effects) and further, there is very little information regarding 
the feasibility, safety or benefits of exercise in individuals living with advanced cancer. More 
research is needed to advance the level of specificity available in the exercise oncology 
literature to serve a broader range of cancer types and stages(73). In addition, there has 
historically been incomplete reporting of compliance to a prescribed FITT program in 
published studies, likely because tracking and quantifying compliance can be burdensome 
(74–76). Thus, it remains possible that some proportion of cancer survivors may not be 
able to tolerate the evidence-based FITT, as explicit reporting of adjustments to the exercise 
prescription (i.e., dose modification) based on tolerance of individuals has been limited. 
Thus, the fitness or healthcare professional should monitor for early signs of poor tolerance 
to training and adjust the dose of exercise accordingly even if this means dropping below 
recommended training volumes. Furthermore, understanding the specific efficacy of exercise 
for a particular outcome is hampered by the fact that the majority of research to date does 
not consider the training principle of initial values by limiting enrollment to individuals 
experiencing the specific outcome of interest (i.e., those with sleep issues or high level 
of fatigue), rarely examines potential moderators of the exercise response (i.e., baseline 
functional capacity), and often draws conclusions about outcomes that are secondary to the 
intended design of the study. Finally, a further understanding of dose response is limited

by a paucity of trials that directly compare two or more levels of exercise training (e.g., 
high versus low intensity exercise) on cancer-related outcomes(77) or compare settings (e.g., 
supervised versus home-based)75. Clearly, more research to address these knowledge gaps is 
warranted so that recommendations can continue to improve in scope and specificity.

2.7  Other exercise modes

There is also increasing interest in the safety and efficacy of types of exercise that fall 
outside of traditional modes of aerobic and resistance training. In a recent systematic 
review of the role of yoga in symptoms management for cancer survivors, yoga both 
during and after cancer treatment was reported to improve quality of life and fatigue, while 
further research is needed to confirm the observed potential to improve sleep, depressive 
symptoms, anxiety/distress, and cancer-related cognitive change(78). However, the literature 
is reflective of practices for many different types of yoga, including those that incorporate 
non-exercise features such as breathing or meditation and which use a wide variety of 
prescriptions (e.g., frequency, duration, with/without home practice), making it difficult to 
generate a definitive prescription. While there is also insufficient evidence at this time for 
a definitive prescription around safety and efficacy for other types of exercise for cancer 
survivors, such as dragon boating(79, 80), recreational sports(81), wall/rock climbing(82), 
triathalon(83), or high intensity interval training(84), research is on-going.

3  EFFECTS OF CANCER TREATMENT AND ADVERSE EFFECTS 

RELEVANT TO EXERCISE

To best evaluate a cancer survivor’s exercise tolerance and prescribe a safe and effective 
exercise program, it is necessary for fitness professionals to know about the type and extent 
(i.e. stage) of cancer a person has. Fitness professionals must also be familiar with the 
common treatment approaches to cancer, the side effects and symptoms these treatments can 
cause, and the subsequent impact on exercise tolerance (Table 3). The treatment approach 
used will differ by type of cancer, stage of disease, cancer subtype, patient health and 
many other considerations. Treatment modalities may include a combination of surgery, 
radiation, and systemic therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, newer targeted agents 
including immune checkpoint inhibitors, and hormonal therapy. When individuals are on 
active cancer treatment, working closely with the oncology treatment team is recommended, 
as treatment approaches change frequently and understanding the side effects of newer 
treatments continues to evolve.

The impact of cancer treatment on exercise tolerance may further depend upon the pre­
diagnosis health and functional capacity of the individual. Furthermore, fitness professionals 
should be aware of and respectful of the fact that individuals diagnosed with cancer 
commonly have many concerns, such as life expectancy, employment issues, and family 
matters, that may limit prioritization of exercise in their lives.

4  MEDICAL CLEARANCE & EXERCISE TESTING

Both the diagnosis of cancer and curative cancer treatments may affect the underlying 
safety of exercise training. Guidance for the indications of medical clearance prior to 
exercise testing and/or training, as well as how exercise testing should be adapted for cancer 
survivors, can be useful for creating a safe and effective exercise prescription. Where this 
information is available elsewhere and to avoid redundancy, the reader will be referred to 
specific publications.

4.1  Medical Clearance Prior to Exercise

Given the diversity of tumor types and side effect of different cancer treatments, including 
the potential acceleration of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the question of whether or not 
cancer survivors require medical clearance (i.e., approval from a medical professional to 
engage in exercise) prior to starting an exercise program is always relevant. Recently, the 
ACSM updated its pre-participation exercise guidelines for all persons in an attempt to 
reduce barriers to exercise by removing a requirement for medical clearance for individuals 
whose risk of an adverse cardiac event during exercise are low, including exercise naïve 
persons(85). Pre-participation guidelines for evaluating the need for medical clearance for 
non-cancer comorbidities should be applied in cancer survivors to minimize risks of adverse 
exercise-related events. The ACSM pre-participation guidelines do not explicitly address 
risks for adverse events and/or injury during exercise that are specific to the adverse effects 
of cancer treatment. Therefore, we have referred to the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) Survivorship Guidelines(8) to frame recommendations for when medical 
clearance and/or further medical evaluation by a medical professional is indicated, as well as 
the level of supervision during exercise training for cancer survivors to ensure safety based 
on the disease and treatment related side effects (Table 4).

4.2  Exercise testing

Ideally, cancer survivors should receive a comprehensive assessment of all components of 
health-related physical fitness (i.e., cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and endurance, 
body composition and flexibility), with some specific cancer-specific considerations (BOX 
2), in order to individualize an exercise prescription. However, requiring a comprehensive 
physical fitness assessment prior to starting exercise may create an unnecessary barrier 
to starting activity. For this reason, no assessments are required to start low intensity 
aerobic training (i.e., walking or cycling), resistance training with gradual progression, or a 
flexibility program in most survivors. Medical clearance may still be indicated as previously 
described depending on exercise and health history and presence of cardiovascular, renal or 
metabolic symptoms(85).

5  EXERCISE SAFETY & TRAINING TOLERANCE

5.1  Safety of exercise training

The overall conclusion from the 2010 Roundtable was that exercise is generally safe for 
cancer survivors(6) and this has not changed based on the majority of studies conducted 
since that time. It should be recognized that the majority of available evidence on the safety

and efficacy of exercise during and following cancer treatment is derived from RCTs of 
supervised and/or home-based prescribed exercise, and trials in breast cancer survivors(17, 
31, 32). Hence the individuals enrolled in studies commonly meet pre-specified eligibility 
criteria for age, comorbidities, physical ability, largely based out of academic and/or medical 
centers, and were willing to participate in research. This often results in a sample that 
is healthier or with higher physical function and exercise motivation that may not fully 
generalize to the broader population of cancer survivors. Depending on the nature and 
extent of a survivor’s presenting problems they may not be able to adequately and/or safely 
engage in the levels of exercise outlined in this recommendation. In these cases, we again 
refer to the NCCN guidelines (Table 4). Physical therapy or medical evaluation might be 
a bridge to inform appropriate modifications to an individual’s exercise program and/or 
correct toxicities, impairments and limitations that prevent a survivor from working toward 
recommended levels of exercise.

5.2  Exercise Tolerance

Exercise has well established health benefits in persons without cancer, thus a key 
consideration in exercise trials has been whether or not cancer survivors can tolerate the 
doses of exercise known or hypothesized to effectively improve physical fitness and in 
turn, associated cancer-related outcomes. Research to date supports the potential of cancer 
survivors to respond positively to an exercise training stimulus by improving individual 
components of physical fitness, including cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., VO2peak)(86), 
muscular strength and endurance(87, 88), body composition(89). However, an individual’s 
response to a given exercise stimulus may vary due to the direct effects of cancer treatments 
on physiological systems (i.e., anemia), side effects of cancer treatment (i.e., cancer-related 
fatigue may lower exercise tolerance), or demographics factors (i.e., age)(90). Furthermore, 
during active treatment an individual’s ability to tolerate exercise may fluctuate from day 
to day or week to week. Understanding of these interactions is a topic of ongoing research, 
especially with the emergence of novel therapies.

Specific to cardiorespiratory fitness, during chemotherapy treatment there is a well­
documented decline in cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by VO2peak or 6-minute walk 
test(4). Randomized trials of aerobic exercise during adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate 
a preservation of, or an improvement in, cardiorespiratory fitness, especially in those with 
low initial values(86), while others report better improvement in those with higher initial 
values(91). Aerobic exercise during adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to stimulate 
greater production of red blood cells(92), so improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness 
are contingent on other central (i.e., cardiac function, plasma volume) and peripheral 
adaptations (i.e., improved vascularization and mitochondrial enzyme function)(93).

Specific to muscular strength, loss of muscle strength and endurance is common due to 
deconditioning or as a side effect of cancer treatment. For example, androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT), which is commonly used as treatment for prostate cancer, results in 
an abrupt loss of lean body mass accompanied by a reduction in muscle strength and 
endurance(94, 95). In the absence of the anabolic drive from testosterone, men on ADT 
may not be able to build lean mass in response to resistance training; however, several

trials that have employed resistance training, or combined with aerobic training, have 
reported small, but statistically significant improvements in lean body mass after 12–36 
weeks of training(96) While sarcopenia is related to muscle weakness and contributes 
to poor functioning in older adults, neuromuscular contributions explain up to 50% of 
variation in muscle strength in older adults, thus resistance training in the setting of ADT 
or deconditioning may still effectively improve muscle strength in the absence of gains in 
muscle mass(97).

Specific to body composition, maintenance of body weight can be difficult during treatment 
for some cancers, where loss of weight and lean body mass is a common concern, 
such as advanced colon, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer(98); whereas weight gain can 
be a common side effect of chemotherapy and anti-estrogen therapy for breast cancer 
or anti-androgen therapy for prostate cancer(99). Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for 
multiple cancers, including postmenopausal breast, renal cell and endometrial cancer, thus 
these survivors are more likely to be overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis(100). 
In cases where weight and lean body mass loss may be a side effect of treatment, the 
fitness professional needs to ensure that exercise training is not creating an excess energy 
deficit (i.e., energy expenditure exceeds adequate dietary energy and nutrient intake) that 
contributes to weight loss and can aggravate fatigue(101, 102). Working with a trained 
oncology dietician who can advise on dietary modifications that would support adequate 
fuel availability and replacement during and post exercise, respectively, may be prudent. For 
cases where survivors may be prone to weight gain and/or obesity, the exercise professional 
should be aware of the safety considerations related to exercise, including orthopedic 
limitations and cardiovascular disease risk(85, 103). If weight loss is implicated in the health 
goals for these individuals, it may be prudent for the exercise professional and/or survivor to 
partner with a registered dietician to provide dietary recommendations that can complement 
an exercise program.

Specific to musculoskeletal flexibility, surgery can result in temporary or more permanent 
reductions in joint range of motion, and extensibility of muscle, tendon, fascia and skin. 
Exercise professionals should be aware of surgical sites and if abnormal movement patterns 
are observed, adapt the proposed movements to avoid placing abnormal strain on other body 
structures and consider referral to physical therapy in efforts to address restrictions.

IMPLEMENTING FITT PRESCRIPTIONS IN PRACTICE

Based on the current literature, an effective exercise prescription that most consistently 
addresses health-related outcomes experienced due to a cancer diagnosis and cancer 
treatment includes moderate intensity aerobic training at least 3 times per week, for at least 
30 minutes, for at least 8–12 weeks. The addition of resistance training to aerobic training, at 
least 2 times per week, using at least 2 sets of 8–15 repetitions at least 60% of one repetition 
maximum, appears to results in similar benefits (BOX 3). Exercise programs that only 
prescribe resistance training are also efficacious at improving most health-related outcomes, 
though for some specific outcomes the evidence is either insufficient or suggestive that 
resistance training alone may not be enough (e.g., depressive symptoms). Exercise programs 
that were supervised appear to be more effective than strictly unsupervised or home­

based programs, though it is unclear whether or not this is because a higher dose of 
exercise may be better achieved with supervised training or from other attributes of this 
setting (i.e., more attention, motivation, reinforcement, selection bias). While a variety of 
professionals delivered supervised interventions in the research literature (e.g., exercise 
physiologists, certified exercise instructors, nurses, physical therapists) determining the type 
of professional that could maximize outcomes was beyond the scope of this paper and the 
available evidence.

However, the fitness professional should be prepared to an create exercise program 
that meet their clients’ needs. A customized program may not yet resemble or reach 
the exercise programs recommended in these guidelines, such that a goal may be 
to strive toward preparing the client to engage in recommended types and levels of 
exercise over their lifetime as outlined in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for 
Americans(54). There is consistent observational evidence that engaging in physical activity 
following a cancer diagnosis reduces the risk of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality for 
individuals diagnosed with early stage breast, colorectal and prostate cancer(104). Special 
considerations and modifications to exercise programs have been adapted from the NCCN 
guidelines (Table 5). Finally, as part of the ACSM Roundtable efforts, oncologists are 
being asked to “Assess, Advise, and Refer”, in order to connect cancer survivors to the 
most appropriate available exercise programming. A registry of programming is available at 
www.exerciseismedicine.org/movethruca (105).

7  SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The 2018 ACSM Roundtable recommendations were made possible due to the increase in 
the availability of high quality randomized controlled trials of exercise in cancer survivors 
published after the 2010 recommendations were issued. This allowed for the development 
of more specific evidence-based exercise prescription to improve common side effects 
of a cancer diagnosis and treatment, namely anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, health­
related quality of life, and physical function, along with safety of exercise training in 
persons with or at risk of breast-cancer related lymphedema. Future research is needed to 
determine the efficacy of exercise to improve other outcomes, including those identified here 
under the emerging or insufficient evidence categories. In addition, the literature remains 
insufficient for further detailing prescriptions according to cancer type, timing of treatment, 
and/or types of treatment, while exercise prescriptions were rarely based on studies that 
directly compared varying FITT components, such as a head-to-head trial of low versus 
high intensity training. Thus, as the evidence base continues to grow in other cancer sites 
and keeps pace with the evolution of cancer treatment, as well as trial designs broaden to 
include multiple treatment arms, the next generation of exercise prescriptions could have the 
specificity to move exercise oncology toward the same goal as precision oncology where 
treatment is matched to the specific characteristics of a person’s cancer.

BOX 2.

Exercise testing recommendations:

• Standard exercise testing methods are generally appropriate for patients with cancer who do not require 
medical clearance or who have been medically cleared for exercise with the following considerations:

• Be aware of a survivor’s health history, comorbid chronic diseases and health conditions, and any general 
exercise contraindications before commencing health-related fitness assessments or designing the exercise 
prescription(85).

• Be familiar with the most common toxicities associated with cancer treatments including increased risk for 
fractures and cardiovascular events, along with neuropathies or musculoskeletal morbidities related to specific 
types of treatment

• Health-related fitness assessments may be valuable for evaluating the degree to which components of 
fitness have been affected by cancer-related fatigue or other commonly experienced symptoms that impact 
function(106)

• In principle, there is no evidence that the level of medical supervision required for symptom-limited 
or maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing need to be different for patients with cancer than for other 
populations(85).

• The evidence-based literature indicates 1-RM testing is safe among survivors of breast and prostate cancer 
without bony metastases(6)

• Among patients with bony metastases or known or suspected osteoporosis routine assessments of muscle 
strength and/or endurance involving musculature that attaches to and/or acts on a skeletal site that contains 
bone lesions should be avoided(107). For example, 1-RM testing for leg strength (e.g, leg press) should be 
avoided in patients who have bony metastases in the proximal femur (i.e., hip) or vertebrae. Other sites where 
lesions are absent could be tested. In this example, if the patient had no lesions in the upper body, 1-RM for 
a chest press or 1-RM for a seated row might be feasible, given no other contraindications. Medical clearance 
from a physician (i.e., orthopedic or radio-oncology) may be mandatory depending on scope of practice or 
protocols at a specific site/facility.

• Older survivors and/or survivors treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy (typical for breast, colon, lung, ovarian 
cancers) may especially benefit from a standard assessment of balance and mobility to assess fall risk(108)

• CVD has become a competing cause of morbidity and mortality for survivors of cancer with a favorable 
prognosis(109). Given the potential for underlying CVD, cancer survivors should be screened for evident 
or underlying CVD using the ACSM pre-participation guidelines (see below) and if implicated have a 
cardiopulmonary exercise test prior to beginning an exercise program(110).

Exercise programming considerations for specific cancer survivors

Table 5.

Consideration

Recommendations.

Bone loss / bone 
metastases:

Lymphedema

Older adults

• Avoid contraindicated movements that place an excessively high load on fragile skeletal sites. These include the 
following: high-impact loads, hyperflexion or hyperextension of the trunk, flexion or extension of the trunk with added 
resistance, and dynamic twisting motion
• Specific guidance on how to modify exercise programs based on the site of bony lesions is provided elsewhere(107, 111)
• Preventing falls must also be a goal of therapy, since falls play an important role in fracture etiology (112).
• Be aware of signs and symptoms of bone metastases in survivors, as well as common locations where these occur 
(i.e., spinal vertebrae, ribs, humerus, femur, pelvis). Bone pain can be an initial sign of skeletal metastases thus, exercise 
trainers should refer survivors who report pain back to the medical team for clinical evaluation prior to continuing exercise

• To date, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute this clinical advice to wear a compression garment during 
exercise to prevent or reduce symptoms of breast cancer-related upper body lymphedema. Therefore, it is recommended 
that exercise professionals provide this information as part of client education and defer to an individual client’s 
preference regarding use of a compression sleeve.
• Being overweight or deconditioned have been associated with a higher risk of developing cancer-related lymphedema in 
observational studies, at this time there is insufficient evidence that weight loss or improving aerobic fitness can lower the 
risk of developing cancer-related lymphedema(113).
•

• Physical problems reported by cancer survivors, such as cognitive difficulty, neuropathy, sarcopenia, muscle 
weakness, slowing, and fatigue, may be similar to those of older people without cancer, but cancer treatment can 
accelerate these declines(114–116)
• Exercise professionals will need to combine ACSM guidelines on exercise programming for older adults(117) with the 
recommendations in this publication.
• Integrate fitness and functional assessments prior to beginning an exercise program to more accurately determine 
baseline functional abilities.

Ostomy

• Empty ostomy bag before starting exercise

• Weight lifting/resistance exercises should start with low resistance and progress slowly under the guidance of trained 
exercise professionals. People with an ostomy may be at an increased risk of parastomal hernia. To regulate intra­
abdominal pressure, correct lifting technique and good form is required. Avoid use of a Valsalva maneuver(118, 119).
• Modify any core exercises which cause excessive intra-abdominal pressure, namely a feeling of pressure or observed 
bulging of the abdomen.
• Those with an ileostomy are at increased risk of dehydration. Get medical advice on ways to maintain optimum 
hydration prior, during and after exercise.
• Those doing contact sports or where there is a risk of a blow to the ostomy may wish to wear an ostomy protector/shield.

• Stability, balance, and gait should be assessed before engaging in exercise; consider balance training as indicated

• Consider alternative aerobic exercise (stationary biking, water exercise) rather than walking if neuropathy affects 
stability or use treadmill with safety handrails
• Resistance training recommendations:
  ○ Monitor discomfort in hands when using hand-held weights
  ○ Consider using dumbbells with soft/rubber coating, and/or wear padded gloves
  ○ Consider resistance machines over free weights(120)

• Home-based exercise encouraged

• A full recovery of the immune system recommended before return to gym facilities with the general public
• Start with light intensity, short durations but high frequency and progress slowly
• Exercise volume (intensity and duration) should be adapted on a daily basis based on the individual’s presentation

• Symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment rarely appear in isolation; rather, symptom clusters are the norm (i.e., 

fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance), especially during cancer treatment and in those with advanced disease(121).
• Exercise professionals must be aware of this complexity and be prepared to refer clients/patients back to the medical 
team (i.e., rehabilitation or oncology physician, general practitioner, or nurse) for review and management of symptoms 
when safety concerns develop or when target symptom (e.g., fatigue) is not responding as expected.

• In addition to melanoma survivors(122), survivors of cancer at other primary sites may be at increased risk for 

secondary skin cancers(123)
• Exercise professionals should recommend that cancer survivors engage in sun protective practices when exercising 
outdoors(124).
