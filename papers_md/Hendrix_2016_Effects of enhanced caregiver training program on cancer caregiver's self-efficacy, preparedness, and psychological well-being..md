Purpose—We examined the effects of an enhanced informal caregiver training (Enhanced-CT) 
protocol in cancer symptom and caregiver stress management to caregivers of hospitalized cancer 
patients.

Methods—We recruited adult patients in oncology units and their informal caregivers. We 
utilized a two-armed, randomized controlled trial design with data collected at baseline, post-
training, and at 2 and 4 weeks after hospital discharge. Primary outcomes were self-efficacy for 
managing patients' cancer symptoms and caregiver stress, and preparedness for caregiving. 
Secondary outcomes were caregiver depression, anxiety, and burden. The education comparison 
(EDUC) group received information about community resources. We used general linear models 
to test for differences in the Enhanced-CT relative to the EDUC group.

Results—We consented and randomized 138 dyads: Enhanced-CT = 68 and EDUC = 70. The 
Enhanced-CT group had a greater increase in caregiver self-efficacy for cancer symptom 
management and stress management, and preparation for caregiving at the post-training 
assessment compared to the EDUC group but not at 2 and 4-week post-discharge assessments. 
There were no intervention group differences in depression, anxiety, and burden.

Conclusion—An Enhanced-CT protocol resulted in short-term improvements in self-efficacy for 
managing patients' cancer symptoms and caregiver stress, and preparedness for caregiving but not 
in caregivers' psychological well-being. The lack of sustained effects may be related to the single-
dose nature of our intervention and the changing needs of informal caregivers after hospital 
discharge.

Background

Living with cancer generates distress for patients and their caregivers [1]. Patients suffer 
from the disease burden, and their caregivers struggle to ease that suffering while enduring 
the stress of a having a loved one with a life-threatening illness. By 2030, 2.3 million 
Americans will receive a new diagnosis of cancer every year [2] and the majority of them 
will live more than 5 years after their diagnosis [3]. Many will rely on their family and 
friends (hereafter, “caregivers”) for assistance in their care.

Cancer caregivers report physical and emotional strain in caring for their loved ones [4]. 
Additionally, many caregivers feel ill prepared in managing cancer symptoms [5,6]. Lack of 
confidence and preparedness to provide the necessary complex care may intensify caregiver 
distress [7,8]. When caregivers' psychological well-being is impaired, patients' well-being 
also worsens [9].

Among the most stressful times for caregivers are the days and weeks following a hospital 
discharge [10,11]. Patients tend to be discharged quickly with caregiver teaching mostly ad 
hoc, provider-determined, and conducted on the day of discharge [12,13]. Further, 
caregivers are expected to assume clinical tasks traditionally performed by healthcare 
professionals [14]. Despite these enormous challenges, no consensus exists on how to best

Method

prepare and support caregivers for home discharge [12,13]. Patients are hospitalized for 
administration of cancer treatment and management of acute symptoms making the time of 
discharge a teachable moment.

In a previous study, we established the feasibility of providing a theoretically-derived, 
individualized, experiential caregiver training in symptom management during a cancer 
patient's hospitalization [15]. Additionally, the training led to improved cancer caregivers' 
self-efficacy in symptom management [16,17]. Self-efficacy is an important concept in 
caregiving because it is a prerequisite for the actual delivery of action [18]. However, the 
training did not affect levels of depression, anxiety, or quality of life among caregivers. This 
previous training neither addressed stress management needs nor taught strategies to 
promote self-care.

This study examined the effects of an enhanced caregiver training (Enhanced-CT) protocol 
that taught caregivers knowledge and skills for managing patient symptoms and strategies 
for managing their own psychological distress. This study was one of three projects in the 
Center for Self-Management in Life-Limiting Illness, a P01 Center funded by the National 
Institute of Nursing Research [19]. We compared the effects of the Enhanced-CT protocol to 
an education condition (EDUC) on caregiver self-efficacy in cancer symptom management 
and stress management, and preparedness as primary outcomes, and psychological well-
being (depression, anxiety, and burden) as secondary outcomes. We also explored the 30-
day emergency department (ED) visit and readmission rates of participating patients.

We designed a two-armed, randomized controlled trial with data collection at baseline, 
immediately after training, and at 2 and 4 weeks after hospital discharge. After obtaining 
approval from the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board, we 
conducted the study on oncology units at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North 
Carolina. Eligible patients were: admitted to oncology unit for treatment or cancer-related 
complications; 18 years or older; oriented to place, person, and time; and being discharged 
home with care needs. Patients under hospice care were ineligible. We also recruited 
patients' caregivers. Eligible caregivers were at least 18 years old and expected to care for 
patients after discharge; able to hear, read, and write in English; and willing to spend at least 
2 hours in the hospital for the training. Patients without available or interested caregivers 
were ineligible to participate.

Study staff reviewed weekly patient rosters in participating oncology units. Using Duke 
University's secure server, study staff emailed a list of eligible patients to attending 
physicians for signoff. Study staff verified with unit nurses the plans to discharge patients to 
home before approaching patients for recruitment. If caregivers were not present during 
recruitment rounds, patients were asked about the presence of home caregivers after their 
hospital discharge. If patients responded affirmatively, study staff inquired on when their 
caregivers may visit and recruitment rounds were planned on that day. If multiple caregivers 
were identified by patients, they were asked to identify the caregiver who would be most 
involved in providing their home caregiving needs.

Intervention

Study staff obtained written consent and completed baseline assessments from dyads. After 
completing baseline assessments, the study staff scheduled one-on-one sessions with the 
caregivers for training. Scheduling was only done when discharge appeared imminent based 
on progress notes or information provided by caregivers. After training schedules were 
established, dyads were randomized by the study nurse interventionist to either the 
Enhanced-CT or EDUC group using an a priori blocked randomization sequence stratified 
by study oncology units. The nurse interventionist was trained to deliver both arms of the 
intervention. Randomization tables and assignments were housed in a database that was 
separate from study tracking information. Study staff who collected data after hospital 
discharge were blinded to dyad intervention assignment. The random allocation sequence 
was generated by the study statisticians. A block size of four was used in the randomization 
sequence, and all study staff other than the statisticians were blinded to the block size 
number.

Immediately after the training, caregivers completed questionnaires on self-efficacy for 
managing patients' cancer symptoms and self-efficacy for stress management as well as 
preparedness for caregiving. Research staff members, who were blinded to group 
assignment, collected follow-up data by phone at 2 and 4 weeks after hospital discharge. 
After study completion, each caregiver received a U.S. $20 check by mail.

Enhanced caregiver training (Enhanced-CT)—A registered nurse interventionist 
delivered the training that had two components: management of patient symptoms and 
caregiver stress management (Table 1). Symptom areas included prevention of infection, 
management of fatigue, pain control, and maintenance of nutrition and proper elimination. 
In the first component, the nurse provided training in symptom management strategies. For 
example, for shortness of breath, discussions focused on positioning and pursed-lip 
breathing for symptom alleviation. If the patient had no active symptoms, the discussion 
focused on symptom prevention. The nurse also provided technical care skills if warranted 
(e.g., care of a central catheter). The nurse encouraged caregivers to identify and discuss 
areas of home care that worried them and included education and training to those specific 
areas.

For caregiver stress management, the skills training focused on deep breathing, progressive 
muscle relaxation, and pleasant imagery, which are strategies previously used by the 
research team. These strategies have demonstrated efficacy in helping cancer patients and 
caregivers manage stress and reduce negative emotions [20]. For this training, a three-step 
behavioral rehearsal procedure was used: a) the nurse modeled how one could apply the skill 
to a particular problem (e.g., using relaxation to manage anxiety), b) the caregiver practiced 
the skill and was given positive and corrective feedback on performance, and c) the 
caregiver practiced the sill until mastery was obtained.

Prior to the training, the nurse reviewed the patient's problem list and clinical progress notes 
to tailor the training to ongoing concerns and to ensure that discharge is anticipated within at 
least 5 days or sooner. The manualized training followed a structured topical outline with 
standard activities for each teaching area. Each teaching area began with needs assessment

Measures

so that discussions were individualized to caregivers. Caregivers also received a one-page 
handout on each symptom containing information that would be discussed. This was to 
minimize note-taking distractions among caregivers. Discussions were interactive; 
caregivers were given ample opportunity to ask questions. Training usually was conducted 
at the patient's bedside and patient participation was encouraged to simulate the dyadic 
nature of home caregiving. Training lasted one to two hours and, if desired, caregivers could 
spread this out over two sessions.

Comparison education (EDUC)—Caregivers received standardized, manualized 
training about local community resources, home health, respite care, hospice, palliative care, 
living will, and medical power of attorney. Similar to the Enhanced-CT group, the training 
was interactive and conducted at the patient's bedside. A social worker or a nurse delivered 
the training, which lasted for approximately one hour.

Intervention fidelity—The study interventionists were provided with a manual outlining 
the treatment protocol and trained in delivering the intervention through modeling, role-play, 
and feedback. We recorded the first five training sessions and the study Principal 
Investigator (PI) listened to the recordings to monitor for fidelity to the study protocol. The 
PI and interventionists had monthly debriefing in the first six months of the study. 
Thereafter, training sessions were recorded quarterly, and the PI and interventionists met 
quarterly as well.

Patients completed baseline demographics, functional status, and well-being questionnaires. 
Caregivers completed measures on self-efficacy for managing patients' cancer symptoms 
and caregiver stress; preparedness for caregiving, anxiety, depression, and burden at 
baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks of discharge. Measures of self-efficacy and preparedness were 
also completed immediately after the training. Additionally, caregivers completed 
demographics and health literacy questionnaires at baseline.

Caregiver measures: Primary outcomes—Caregiver self-efficacy for managing 
cancer symptoms and stress was measured using a modified version of a Self-efficacy Scale 
for Cancer Caregivers [21]. Thirteen items assessed confidence in caregivers' abilities to 
manage cancer symptoms (12 items) and their stress (1 item). Item ratings ranged from 10 
(very uncertain) to 100 (very certain). Self-efficacy for symptom management was the mean 
of the 12 items, and the one item assessing self-efficacy for stress management was treated 
as a stand-alone item.

Preparedness for caregiving was measured using The Preparedness for Caregiving scale, a 
subscale of the Family Caregiving Inventory [22]. This 8-item scale measured physical, 
emotional, social, and general preparation for caregiving. Caregivers rated their 
preparedness from “Not at all prepared” (0 points) to “Very well prepared” (4 points). This 
scale is widely used in informal caregiving research [23,24].

Caregiver measures: Secondary outcomes—Anxiety was measured using the 5-item 
Profile of Mood States (POMS) anxiety sub-scale. The items are rated based on the strength

of emotion, where 0 = “not at all,” and 4 = “extremely.” It has demonstrated adequate 
psychometric properties [25,26].

Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiology Studies - Depression Scale 
(CES-D), a 10-item measure with excellent validity and reliability [27,28].

Caregiver burden was measured using the 24-item Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA). 
The CRA measures reactions to caregiving for family members with a variety of chronic 
illnesses. It includes items on caregiver esteem, family support, impact on finances, impact 
on schedule, and impact on health [29].

Another measure included The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM-R) 
[30]. The REALM-R uses recognition and pronunciation of 8 health-related words. A score 
≤ 6 indicates poor health literacy.

Patient measures: Patient Functional status was assessed using the 7-item instrumental 
(IADL) and the 6-item Physical (PADL) subscales of the OARS Multidimensional 
Functional Assessment Questionnaire (OMFAQ) [31]. Scores were scaled as 1 (need no 
help), 2 (need some help), or 3 (unable to do).

Well-being was measured using the Quality of Life in Chronic Illness: FACT-G, a 27-item 
questionnaire with four domains: physical, functional, social/family, and emotional well-
being [32-34].

Dyads completed a standardized demographics questionnaire. Caregivers were also asked 
two additional questions: years of caregiving and relationship to the patient. Duke's medical 
record for each patient within 30 days of index hospital discharge was also reviewed to 
determine ED visits and hospital readmissions.

Data Analysis

We estimated sample size based on the primary hypothesis that caregivers in the Enhanced-
CT group would have increased self-efficacy for symptom management, as measured by the 
self-efficacy scale, at post-training compared with the EDUC group using methods in Borm, 
Fransen, and Lemmens [35]. Based on our previous pilot study, the estimated baseline to 
post-training correlation was 0.52 [16]. To detect a difference of 0.5 standard deviations at 
post-training with 85% power, and a type I error rate of 5%, 110 caregivers were needed; 
however, to account for dropout, we enrolled 138 caregivers.

For all outcomes, general linear models (PROC MIXED in SAS, version 9.2, SAS Institute, 
Inc., Cary, North Carolina) were used to test for differences in the Enhanced-CT group 
relative to the EDUC group. Final models included a common intercept, oncology unit (the 
stratification variable), dummy coded time (baseline, post-training for primary outcomes 
only, 2, and 4 weeks post-discharge), and intervention arm interactions with each follow-up 
time point. An unstructured covariance matrix was fit to account for the correlation of 
caregivers' repeated measures over time. Mean differences between the Enhanced-CT and 
EDUC at post-training (primary outcomes only), 2, and 4 weeks post-discharge were

calculated, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using SAS 
ESTIMATE statements.

Measurements from all randomized caregivers, including those who subsequently 
discontinued the study, were used for the longitudinal analyses (n = 138 caregivers). 
Caregivers who discontinued the study differed on baseline characteristics, as compared 
with those who completed the study, so a multiple imputation procedure [36] to estimate 
missing values was employed. The imputation model included baseline variables that were 
predictors of dropout in addition to treatment group, the oncology unit used for stratification 
in the randomization process, and the caregiver outcomes at baseline, post-training, 2, and 4 
week post-discharge. The macro IVEware in SAS (version 0.2) was used to generate 10 
imputed datasets via a sequential regression method. General linear models for each 
outcome were fit to each of these data sets, and the 10-sets of parameter estimates and 
standard errors were combined using the Rubin rules for multiple imputation (using PROC 
MIANALYZE in SAS). More information on this general analytic approach can be found 
elsewhere [37,38].

To account for censoring due to death, 30-day rates of ED visits and readmissions were 
compared between the Enhanced-CT and EDUC groups using Kaplan-Meier estimators and 
log-rank test statistic. Primary and secondary outcomes were identified a priori and no 
adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. A p-value < 0.05 was statistically 
significant.

We screened 3,088 electronic records for eligibility (Figure 1). Of the 665 we approached 
for recruitment, we consented 172 dyads. Of these 172 dyads, we randomized 138 (68 dyads 
were assigned to the Enhanced-CT group and 70 to the EDUC group). Sixty-six caregivers 
(97%) in the Enhanced-CT group and 64 caregivers (91%) in the EDUC group completed 
training and the post-training assessment. Thirty-eight caregivers in the Enhanced-CT group 
(57% of those assigned) and 38 in the EDUC group (59%) completed the 4-week post-
discharge follow-up. Caregivers who completed the study were older, had been a caregiver 
for less time, were less likely to be working, had lower anxiety (POMS) and depressive 
(CES-D) symptoms (CES-D), and had higher baseline confidence to manage stress than 
caregivers who did not complete the study. Patients of caregivers who completed the study 
were older, more likely to be female, more likely to have a hematological malignancy, 
needed less help (ADL/IADL) and had lower functional well-being (FACT-G) than patients 
of caregivers who did not complete the study. We included all of these baseline 
characteristics in the multiple imputation model.

Characteristics of dyads are described in Tables 2 and 3. The mean age of caregivers was 55 
and majority were female, White, married, had at least some college years, and spouses of 
care recipients. Of those caregivers who completed the REALM (n = 122), only four (3%) 
had a high risk for poor literacy. On average, caregiving duration was approximately 19 
months. The baseline mean self-efficacy among participating caregivers was high at 70.4 
(72.0 for Enhanced-CT vs. 69.0 for EDUC). Caregivers in the Enhanced-CT group spent

longer time on training compared to those in the EDUC group (mean of 110.7 minutes vs. 
56.5 minutes) and were more likely to have their loved ones with cancer participate in the 
training (66.7% vs. 48.4%). Patients who participated were afforded opportunities to 
actively engage in the training by asking questions or clarifying information received. Only 
one caregiver in the Enhanced-CT group received a booster to the training. Patient 
participants had a mean age of 57. They shared the same demographic characteristics as 
caregivers except that the majority were male.

Primary Outcomes

After the intervention, caregivers randomized to Enhanced-CT group had a significantly 
higher level of self-efficacy for managing patients' cancer symptoms (6.1, 95% CI: 3.0-9.3, 
p<0.001), and their stress (4.8, 95% CI: 0.5-9.1, p=0.03) than those in the EDUC Group (see 
Table 4). Similarly, after the training, caregivers randomized to the Enhanced-CT group 
reported significantly higher levels of preparedness for caregiving than those in the EDUC 
group (0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.4, p=0.01). However, these differences were not sustained at 2-
week and 4-week post-discharge assessments (see Table 4).

Secondary Outcomes

In general, caregivers' depressive symptoms and anxiety improved from the baseline to two-
week follow-up. However, there was no evidence of intervention group differences in these 
improvements (all p > 0.05; Table 4). There was little change over time in caregiver burden 
for Enhanced-CT and EDUC groups. There was little change over time in caregiver burden 
for Enhanced-CT and EDUC groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 30-day ED treat-and-
release, direct hospitalization, and ED visits leading to hospitalization rates were 7%, 42% 
and 22% for Enhanced-CT patients, respectively, and 10%, 46% and 26% for EDUC 
patients (all p > 0.05).

Discussion

Compared to the EDUC group, caregivers in the Enhanced-CT group had significant 
increases in self-efficacy for managing patients' cancer symptoms and stress, and 
preparedness for caregiving immediately after training. Many caregivers stated the 
importance of having a dedicated time with a nurse to discuss their needs and practice 
caregiving skills. A caveat for implementation, however, is the additional time required for 
this training that consequently will require re-examination of nurse workload.

We did not observe sustained intervention effects on self-efficacy and preparedness 
following hospital discharge. These results are similar to our previous trial of older 
hospitalized cancer patients [17]. Our training's single-dose approach may have undermined 
the changing nature of post-discharge caregiver needs [39]. Additional, pre-discharge 
training is anticipatory at best and may not adequately capture the complex nature of home 
caregiving [7].

The Enhanced-CT protocol did not improve caregivers' depressive symptoms, anxiety, or 
burden. Although our strategies of deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and 
pleasant imagery are associated with stress reduction, [20] their effects may have been

curtailed by high, continuous, post-discharge demands on informal caregivers [10,11]. In 
addition to concerns about the care of their loved ones, caregivers experience substantial 
increases in time demands, physical exhaustion, financial costs, and personal heath risks 
[40]. Future caregiving trials should consider supplemental ways of support after hospital 
discharge such as phone calls or using interactive technologies. Beginning in October 2012, 
the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services began reducing payments to hospitals for 
patients with selected diagnoses and who are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of 
discharge [41]. This new mandate should stimulate hospitals to invest in resources for home 
transitions. One important resource is a caregiver support program that transcends the 
physical boundaries of hospitals.

Our study has several limitations. We conducted our study at one of the nation's leading 
centers for cancer services [42] that caters to medically complex patients with complicated 
treatment regimens. Thus, our participants have many caregiving needs that are outside the 
purview of the study's caregiver training protocol. The high medical acuity of our patients 
also contributed to the attrition rate of our enrolled participants. We only collected data on 
formal services utilized by dyads. The collection of additional caregiving support, including 
from family and friends, could have helped in understanding our study outcomes. Second, 
interventionist fidelity was not assessed by someone not directly involved in the study, 
raising the possibility of bias in assessments. Data on therapist adherence to protocol would 
have addressed this fidelity concern. Thus, a more intensive fidelity assessment and ongoing 
monitoring and supervision might have enhanced treatment effects. The characteristics 
caregivers and/or patients who dropped out in the study should be accounted for to 
determine if there are common dyadic features contributing to this attrition. Lastly, caregiver 
utilization of coping strategies taught during the intervention was not assessed in the home 
setting. Thus, it is unclear whether the coping strategies were insufficient or if their use was 
inadequate.

In summary, we found that our Enhanced-CT protocol resulted in short-term improvements 
in self-efficacy for managing cancer symptoms and stress, and preparedness among 
caregivers but not in their psychological well-being. The lack of sustained intervention 
effects may be related to the single-dose nature of our intervention and the changing needs 
of caregivers after hospital discharge.

Teaching Areas for the Enhanced Caregiver Training Program

Table 1

Prevention of Infection: signs and symptoms of infection; skills for patient care as applicable (examples are central line care, dressing change, 
Foley catheter care, wound care, etc.)

Management of Fatigue: activity-rest cycle, (example is napping in mid-morning and mid-afternoon, with each nap no longer than 15-20 
minutes). Pleasant activity scheduling (examples are timing busiest activities or enjoyable activities in the morning when energy is at a high 
level).

Pain Control: assessment; pain medication management; nonpharmacologic interventions

Maintenance of Nutrition and Proper Elimination: maintaining or increasing caloric intake; management for constipation or diarrhea

Home Care Issues: assessment of issues that caregiver perceives to be stressful and in need of assistance; discussion of medication regimen for 
patient

Strategies for Managing Psychological Distress: deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation; pleasant imagery
