Within environmental psychology, the restorative environment is receiving
increasing attention due to its favorable impact on people’s mental recovery,
stress reduction, and psychophysiological well-being. Flow theory, as one of
the foundations of positive psychology, is a popular theoretical framework for
understanding human ﬂourishing and well-being. The restorative environment
is suggested to facilitate ﬂow experience and city identity from the perspective
of positive environmental psychology. Nonetheless, systematic research
investigating them all
through a
preliminary review of 169 relevant studies retrieved from the data source, this
work proposes a novel theoretical model in which people’s interactions within
the restorative environment facilitate their experience of ﬂow and perceived
city identity. Additionally, this research provides conceptual guidance for
city workers to engage in nature-based intervention and leisure therapy
for improved well-being. Overall, this review endeavors to contribute to
developing urban workers’ restoration, happiness, and well-being from both
practical and theoretical perspectives.

of urban green space during times of stress, such as the COVID-
19 pandemic, has the ability to mitigate some of the stressor’s
detrimental consequences (5). People in the city of Shanghai in
China are starting to realize and indicate their willingness to
pay for green oﬃces (6). Nonetheless, empirical studies are still
needed in this ﬁeld.

The “happy-productive worker” thesis states that a happy
worker would perform better than an unhappy one (7). The
hedonic perspective of well-being refers to a view of pleasure
and the experience of positive emotions [e.g., (8)]. In contrast,
the eudaimonic philosophy of well-being refers to a view of
“worthwhileness” (reward) and commitment (engagement for
meaning and life purpose) that is associated with the activities
carried out at work (9, 10). Flow involves remaining “focused”
and “engaged” in the task at hand (11). It is deﬁned as when
engaging in an activity (i.e., work), people will enter into an
aﬀective and cognitive state characterized as total absorption,
full concentration, time distortion, and optimal enjoyment (12,
13). Deﬁned as an environment that helps one recover from
mental fatigue (the fatigue of directed attention), a restorative
environment (14, 15) is commonly believed to be a predictor
of the ﬂow experience, a state of profound enjoyment and
satisfaction elicited from daily activities (11, 14, 16, 17). Scholars
have also suggested the mutually reinforcing relationships
between the restorative environment and the place identity of
people residing in the city (18).

Standing on the social identity approach, the self-awareness
of one’s membership in a place-related community, including
the emotional and value-laden implications of this membership,
is known as place identity (19). Place identity within
environmental psychology is deﬁned as “memories, conceptions,
ideas, and related feelings toward speciﬁc
interpretations,
physical environments as well as types of settings” [(20), p. 60],
and the “physical world socialization of the self ” [(20) p. 57].
It is a facet of self-identity comparable to other identities but
pertaining to people’s identiﬁcation with a speciﬁc geographic
place (21), such as a city where people live in. Each city has
its own identity, formed by images and recollections, both
good and bad. As a result of much implicit evidence on ﬂow-
identity associations (21–26), it can be argued that there is an
interaction between restorative environment, ﬂow experience,
and city identity. For instance, scholars have considered
residential neighborhoods familiar, restorative, memorable, and
beautiful environments that can signiﬁcantly facilitate the
ﬂow experience (27). However, there are still no systematic
studies simultaneously on these three constructs, to the best of
our knowledge.

Nowadays, for those city workers and city dwellers whose
a great deal of time is spent on long oﬃce hours during
work, staring at the screen and immersing in diverse online
virtual platforms after work (28), creating an environmentally
friendly workplace and leisure space in the city that brings about
restoration (29), is critical to promote more positive aﬀective

and cognitive psychological experience such as ﬂow experience
and city identity. The present work, guided by three speciﬁc
goals, reviews the research on ﬂow, city identity, and restorative
environment and interprets this research within the framework
of positive psychology (the ﬂow theory—the foundations of
positive psychology) and environmental psychology (attention
restorative theory, ART). The ﬁrst goal is to review empirical
research to construct a new conceptual model relating to notions
of restorative environment, psychological ﬂow, and city identity.
The second goal is to build a preliminary conceptual model
based on the theoretical view of the restorative environment
(14). The third goal is to identify nature-based interventions
for city workers to promote their everyday ﬂow experience and
build and enhance city identity experience via a therapeutic
process. The organization of this review maps these goals. It ends
with a discussion of ﬁndings with corresponding implications
for research and practice to make urban places more appealing
to city workers in terms of restoration and physical activities.

Literature review

A brief literature review involved the following search
terms by relevance ﬁlter within the web-based search engine
Google Scholar in April 2022: ﬂow (“ﬂow” OR “ﬂow state” OR
“ﬂow experience” OR “experience of ﬂow” OR “psychological
ﬂow” OR “ﬂow proneness” OR “optimal experience”), city
identity (“city identity” OR “place identity” OR “identity of
residents” OR “urban identity”), AND restorative environment
(“restorative environment” OR “restorative experience” OR
“restorativeness”). Since the number of recorded literature
simultaneously on these three constructs was small and limited,
we did not restrict the type of related publications (empirical
studies, articles, editorials, commentaries, opinion papers, and
textbooks) to mitigate the risk of missing something signiﬁcant
from a study that was not appropriately cataloged within a
keyword catalog such as “city identity”. However, we analyzed
only the ﬁrst 300 items sorted out by relevance with the following
principles: (a) Articles were excluded if the abstract showed that
the article did not even partially address the three variables
as described above or if the construct under research was
labeled as such yet addressed a diﬀerent topic. If there was
any doubt, the complete article was screened before deciding
whether to include or exclude it; (b) They did not contribute
in part to addressing the research question, or; (c) They were
not available electronically or via other acceptable methods.
The authors conducted this retrieval process twice to ensure
its accuracy. We, therefore, found 165 articles (ﬂow and city
identity: 10; ﬂow and restorative environment: 59; restorative
environment and city identity: 96) among these 300 sourced
items. Due to limited article space, we deleted articles with
basically the replicated ﬁndings or comparably low citations
after reading the abstract. There were no studies on the three

intervention for the youngsters. Indeed, when interacting
with the whole world and blurring the line between self and
environment, a holistic feeling of ﬂow matters since there is
neither stress nor boredom in such an environment (26, 36).

Flow experience has three prerequisites (clear goals, detailed
feedback, and challenge-skills balance), three characteristics
(action-awareness merging, concentration on the task at hand,
sense of control), and three consequences [loss of self-
consciousness, the transformation of time, autotelic experience,
(37)]. Take forest experience as an example of nature experience.
First, such an immersion nature experience needs prerequisites.
As for “clear goals,” forest users’ primary reasons seem to be
a desire to escape from everyday hassle and alleviate stress
(38, 39). According to the ﬂow model, a forest experience can be
classiﬁed as a challenge; to enjoy and be sensitive to a forest, one
needs “skill” (i.e., training in hiking skills, knowledge about the
destination landscape, and awareness of the potential dangers).
Furthermore, according to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (40),
the totality of a forest experience is stunning in that there is a
complete concentration of attention on the forest. A person in a
forest setting may be exposed to “forest stimuli” or impressed by
the forest’s magniﬁcence and mystery. As for the consequences,
when a person enters into a “ﬂow” state, they may forget about
the outside world (41) and, via communicating with nature in
the forest, may achieve a condition of inner peace and tranquility
similar to that experienced during a religious experience.

Additionally, some research has examined the ﬂow concept
regarding causal links with natural environments, experience
levels, and related aﬀective states (42). For instance, Tsaur
et al. (43) have discovered that the transcendent aspect of
high-altitude mountain climbing was a signiﬁcant predictor
of ﬂow and that experiencing ﬂow made climbers “happier”.
This association is conﬁrmed in surﬁng activities (44). The
visitors report varied emotional assessments (i.e., awe-inspiring,
peaceful, upsetting, and uninteresting) and transcendence
(diminutive and deep ﬂow) experiences in two diverse natural
habitats [wild cliﬀs and groomed gardens, (45)]. A critical
requirement for experiencing ﬂow for these various recreational
experts was the ideality and restorativeness of the natural
terrestrial or aquatic. Indeed,
environment,
these qualities of the ﬂow state are not only applied to a
person experiencing hiking in a mountain or forest that is
not often available in daily life (46); ﬂow can also occur
in parks and the urban greenspace, which plays a role in
people’s everyday lives in urban areas. Maurer et al. (47)
ﬁnd that
trees are the most signiﬁcant aspect of nature,
contributing to the subjective well-being and connectedness
to nature of the majority of participants. Also, it has been
proved that increasing employees’ interaction with vegetation
can enhance employee well-being and performance (48).
In a word, ﬂow can be experienced through interaction
with nature, which has implications for city workers’ well-
being.

exploring the relationship between ﬂow and city identity. With
other supporting evidence on the interventions included, a total
of 169 works (e.g., 15 books, 2 conference proceedings, and 152
journal articles) were retained for review in the present work.

pathways connecting greenspace to health are presented in
three domains, which emphasize three general functions of
greenspace: reducing harm (e.g., being less exposed to air
pollution, noise, and heat), restoring capacities (e.g., attention
restoration and physiological stress recovery), and building
capacities (e.g., promoting physical activity and enhancing
social cohesion). Interrelations among the three domains also
deserve further investigation (31, 32). Scholars have indicated
three signiﬁcant ﬁndings in terms of ﬂow experience and the
natural environment: (1) Youth indicating a preference for
nature might be more active and involved in daily tasks at hand;
(2) Adults value nature’s restorative qualities; youngsters prefer
competitive and demanding experiences and; (3) Programs
should encourage, educate, train, and provide the opportunity
for youth to participate in healthy nature-based activities
(33–35), laying a foundation for our research on nature-based

Flow experience and restorative
environment

The ﬁeld of restorative environment research is thriving due
to two major theories: Attention Restoration Theory (ART),
(14) and Stress Reduction Theory (SRT) (49–51), as well as
a substantial body of empirical studies. According to ART,
continuous use of directed attention—actively and deliberately
focusing on a task—contributes to mental fatigue, and that
involuntary attention—attention that needs little to no eﬀort—
is required to alleviate directed attention fatigue. Individuals
beneﬁt from the opportunity to (1) “be away” from daily
hassles and stresses, (2) encounter vast spaces and contexts
(“extent”), (3) participate in activities that are “compatible”
with our intrinsic motivations, and (4) critically experience
stimuli that are “softly fascinating” (15). This combination of
elements promotes “involuntary” or “indirect” attention while
also allowing our “voluntary” or “directed” attention capabilities
to repair and restore (15, 52). SRT indicates that psychological
restoration may beneﬁt aﬀect, cognition, behaviors, and the
physiological system. On the contrary, positive psychology says
that people might achieve well-being and stress alleviation
through what is known as ﬂow experience, which entails
people’s deliberately participating in an engaging activity (11,
53), people’s attention and concentration are distracted away
from everyday duties and undesired ideas when they are engaged
in an exciting activity (e.g., sports, yoga, writing, or socializing).
After aﬃrming the interactive eﬀects of attentional state
with activity-setting and with social context (54), Staats (52)
further describes ART and SRT theories’ content, similarities,
and diﬀerences. He then discusses research conducted in a

the home,

As anticipated by ART, some research demonstrates people’s
preference for natural outdoor spaces over built-up outdoor and
interior spaces such as urban settlement areas, loading docks,
parking lots, and roadways (55–58). The restorative beneﬁts
of well-known cultural contexts (such as museums, industrial
heritage sites, and historic city centers) that serve as tourist
attractions (59) may diﬀer from those of ordinary residential
surroundings. Based on SRT and ART, evidence has shown
that environmental preference has a phylogenetic basis and
is intimately related to the claimed restorative beneﬁts (60).
Indeed, ﬂow theory and SRT are expected to be connected by
a signiﬁcant decrease since stress and ﬂow are embedded in an
inverted U-shaped relationship (61).

Researchers have established a variety of conceptual
frameworks for considering the human transformations that
including “extraordinary experience” (62),
occur in nature,
“transcendent experience” (63), and “peak experience” (64).

Extraordinary experiences include action and consciousness,
attention or focus, personal integration, personal control, power
awareness, joy and value, and a spontaneous letting go of process
(65). Transcendent experiences are deﬁned as those that exist
beyond human observation and comprehension. They include
“communion with nature that both escape from duties and the
emotional relationship established by immersion in regions of
unusual natural beauty” [(43) p.361]. According to Williams
and Harvey (16), optimal experiences foster mental attention,
immersion in the present moment, and personal growth.

(66). Grant et al. (67) also add an expanded ﬂow theory to an
ethnographic study of hobby ﬂy ﬁshing to demonstrate how
customers’ bodies, the environment, and ﬁshing equipment
contribute to restorative experiences. The experience of a VR-
based restorative environment has a favorable healing impact
on patients with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression,
as shown by its eﬀects on positive and negative emotions,
self-eﬃcacy, and cognitive function (68).
In a nutshell,
restorative environment and ﬂow experience are related to
the individual well-being paradigm. The related intervention
may be eﬃcacious in improving attention and mood among
city workers.

understanding—beyond what
Nonetheless,
Csikszentmihalyi discovered in 1975—has been minimal. To
rectify this, the idea of ﬂow must be introduced to explore how
factors external to the personal inﬂuence the present-moment
experience. Relational places are composed of a complex of
social, material, and ecological processes operating at several
scales (69), with which a person interacts and is molded (70).
Human beings are exposed to various everyday activities via
their physical and environmental surroundings. The importance
of activities in deﬁning human-environment interaction has
been extensively studied in the discipline of environmental
psychology (21). While attention to place-related identity is
growing in environmental psychology (71), less focus has been
made on developing a deeper understanding of place identity at
the local level and the social nature of urban identity (26).

The discovery model of identity development postulates
that adolescents’ subjective identity-related experiences, such
as personal expressiveness, ﬂow, and goal-directed behavior,
partially reﬂect these development processes (72). Bonaiuto
et al. (73) demonstrate that speciﬁc indicators measuring the
quality and quantity of activities associated with a particular

neighborhood community can be related to neighborhood
attachment. Kyle and colleagues discover that hiking activity
predicts one’s place identity (74),
implying a cognitive
relationship between the self-concept and the location of the
activities (46). Bonaiuto and colleagues (36, 75, 76) have
consistently found that distinct sets of activities performed
by residents in diﬀerent geographic locations (i.e.,
their
neighborhood community, city center, and suburb) are related to
how residents assess the environmental quality of these locations
and how they ascribe belongingness to these locations (such as
their neighborhood attachment and community identity).

Leisure activities contribute signiﬁcantly to individual
identity creation in urban industrial societies. For example,
substantial studies have reviewed research on the association
between teenage (positive) identity construction and leisure
situations [ﬂow, (77)]. Locations such as homes inﬂuence
people’s ﬂow experience (78). Cohen (79) revisits the dialectics
of escapism (ﬂow experience), authenticity, and identity in
leisure and tourist activities. Lee and Shen (80) discovered
that participation in leisure activities (such as walking their
dogs in urban parks) is associated with place loyalty. “An
analysis of the reported experiences of people involved in
various play-forms (i.e., rock-climbing, chess, dance, basketball,
music composition) suggests that the qualities which make
these activities enjoyable are the following: (a) a person can
concentrate on a limited stimulus ﬁeld, (b) in which he or she
can use his or her skills to meet clear environmental demands,
(c) thereby forgetting his or her own problems, and (d) his
or her own separate identity, (e) at the same time obtaining a
feeling of control over the environment, (f) which may result
in a transcendence of ego boundaries and consequent psychic
integration with personal meta systems” [(81), p 113]. Sports
activities also aid career advancement by facilitating severe
leisure and forming social identiﬁcation (82).

Similarly, Orta et al. (83) reveal a strong link between ﬂow
experience and athletic identity. Based on the eudaimonistic
identity theory (EIT), which emphasizes self-deﬁning activities
as critical
their goals,
for an individual’s identiﬁcation of
values, beliefs, and interests related to the development or
enhancement of one’s own identity, and based on ﬂow theory,
which holds that certain salient features of an activity experience
are associated with happiness and well-being, it has been shown
that promoting a person’s ﬂow experience inside psychologically
meaningful settings may help sustain or enhance one’s place
identity. Therefore, the people–place interactions support the
ﬂow-place identity link (21).

Emplaced ﬂow considers the socio-spatial dynamics that
impact a person when they strive to get engrossed in a
geographically located activity and the eﬀect of
location
on instantaneous sensations (84), which is a direction for
future related research. Therefore, ﬂow and city identity
can be closely related, and this demands more empirical

identity building

City identity and restorative environment

For the most part,

theory and practical ﬁndings on
place identity and restorative environment have received
accumulating attention in recent years,
though they have
developed separately. For instance, Korpela (85) proposes that
place identity is a product of environmental self-regulation.
Korpela and Hartig (18) examine how people value their favorite
environmental locations using restorative environment theory-
based criteria because a “sense of community” includes not just
social relationships but also the bonds that individuals build
with their natural surroundings (86). By correlating location
preferences to place meaning, Kyle et al. (87) also investigate
the link between place motivation and attachment. Devine-
Wright and Howes (88) reveal that for people with solid place
attachments, the conﬂict between project and place (restorative
environment for inhabitants) is seen as a challenge to identity,
resulting in negative attitudes and oppositional behavior.
Scholars have also highlighted the importance of the relationship
between landscape, place identity, and restorativeness (89).
Those with an urban place-related identity (i.e., city dwellers)
have viewed urban and natural settings as equivalent in terms
of their ability to aid recovery from directed attention fatigue;
and, on average, urban geographical locations are judged to
be “rather” likely to result in restoration instead of the non-
restorative outcome predicted by ART (90). Urban green
space has the potential to match the eﬀect of nature on
some restoration outcomes, and environmental preferences are
indicative of place identity (91). Built environments that are
“attractive” are just as restorative and emotionally uplifting as
natural spaces in the urban environment (92). A particular
sense of place [(93), coined the term “seasides”] shows itself via
positive and uplifting perceptions of the multisensory seaside
environment; participants report a belief in the seaside as a
“tonic”. The expansive views, fresh air, sea scent, and sound
of crashing waves are constantly alluded to and characterized
in restorative terms. Morton et al. (94) hypothesize that the
restorative capacity of surroundings is governed, at least in part,
by social and psychological processes associated with identity.

Besides, Bornioli et al. (95) reveal that particular interactions
with place linked to personal relationships, place identity, and
positive feelings of the community that resulted in improved
psychological well-being. Liu et al. (96) ﬁnd that landscape
elements enhance individuals’ attachment to new environments.
Restorative impressions are favorably associated with local
landscape traits, place reliance, and place identity (97). In a word,
though there are quite limited studies exploring the associations
between restorative environment and city identity, place identity
plays a crucial role in mediating the naturalness-wellbeing link

Frontiers in Public Health

(98). Based on this, a more nuanced understanding of the
potential relationship between city identity and a restorative
environment is necessary, since a diversity of (natural and
urban) locations may be restorative and related to city workers’
identity (29).

Flow, city identity, and restorative
environment

Research records on the relationships among ﬂow, city
identity, and restorative environment cannot be traced for
the time being, but much implicit sparking evidence can
be traced in extant works, such as the following: Tsaur
et al. (99) identify 6 factors to quantify the ﬁt between
recreationists and their environment based on Attention
Restoration Theory and Aﬀordance Theory: natural resources,
interpersonal opportunities, environmental functions, facilities,
activity knowledge/skills, and operation/management. It is via
ﬂow experiences that we strengthen our place attachment,
choose our favorite places, and generate intrinsic motivation
to enter certain places but not others (100). A growing
body of research shows that adventurous nature sports can
promote diverse hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being,
including: (a) facilitating feelings of connection to nature; (b)
fostering physical and mental beneﬁts associated with physical
activity, (c) providing opportunities to overcome challenges and
have optimal experiences; (d) increasing positive psychological
outcomes such as positive aﬀect, self-eﬃcacy, and resilience;
(e) restoring cognitive resources; (f) providing opportunities
to experience self-determination (e.g., via psychological need
fulﬁllment and intrinsic value orientations); and (g) promoting
social connectedness (101).

Williams and Harvey (16) divide forest experiences into
six distinct categories, one of which—deep ﬂow—can be
characterized as
transcendent experience. The deep ﬂow
experience is distinct. It includes a high degree of compatibility
and a moderate degree of novelty and is thus likely to be reported
as relaxing or eliciting a sense of belonging.

Rosenbaum and Massiah (102) demonstrate how consumer
reactions to social, symbolic, and natural stimuli often serve
as the catalyst for solid person-place attachments and how a
servicescape’s inherently restorative feature may alleviate mental
fatigue and enhance customer health and well-being.

Bell et al. (103) examine how symbolic, achievement-
oriented,
immersive, and social experiences contribute to
participants’ sense of well-being in their local coastal regions,
using a unique adaption of the therapeutic landscape concept.

argue that
the environment’s restorative capacity is partly
inﬂuenced by social and psychological processes associated with
identity, and a more nuanced understanding of the potential
psychological beneﬁts of exposure to nature is necessary and
that a diversity of environments (natural and urban) may
be restorative.

Lee et al. (104) investigate the mechanisms behind the
the urban forest on middle-aged
therapeutic beneﬁts of
women through their participation in an urban forest therapy
program. Following these women’s acquisition of information
about the forest and emotional connection with one another,
their mental attitudes shift, allowing them to identify with
nature and think about their own lives. They are then able
to cultivate coping mechanisms that eventually result
in
self-healing. This work demonstrates how participants self-

group members.

Giusti

and Samuelsson (105) propose
that when
environmental attitudes (including identiﬁcation with nature)
and natural environments interact statistically, almost all
restorative experiences (including feeling immersed in the
place—one core element of ﬂow) are predicted more accurately
than when these factors are independent predictors, that is, there
is synergistic compatibility between environmental attitudes
and healthy ecosystems that triggers restorative processes.

From the above discussion, we propose that the three
variables are implicated in reciprocal feedback loops, as shown
in Figure 2.

Practical intervention for city
workers

In recent years, it has become more apparent that urban
planning and environmental design inﬂuence mental health
and well-being. According to the “happy-productive worker
hypothesis”, people who are more content with their jobs
are also more productive and engaged. Promoting workplace
well-being and reducing work-related stress may have far-
reaching repercussions, not just for knowledge-sector employees
but also for the productivity of organizations, and employers
have increasingly recognized this. Building on a long tradition
of urban greenspace provision as a public good supporting
population health [e.g., by the urban parks and garden
cities movements, (106)], much recent research examining the
relationship between the physical environment and health has
focused on the role of green space (26, 36). By examining the

compensatory strategy for the lack of access to the outdoors
provided by windows (e.g., restoration for those in need of
it). Additionally, Boubekri et al. (113) establish that workplace
windows (114, 115) and daylight exposure are predictors of job
satisfaction and overall health for oﬃce employees. Wang et al.
(116) ﬁnd that all the seven diﬀerent types of forest resting
environments in a virtual reality video can produce stress relief
eﬀects to some extent.

Both open space utilization and views of speciﬁc vegetation
types, such as trees,
lawns, shrubs, and blooming plants,
are positively and independently linked with employees’ self-
reported well-being levels (117). For example, Zurawik (118)
indicates that indoor plants are connected with a decrease
in oﬃce employees’ sick absence frequency and increased
productivity, owing to the assistance oﬀered by plants for
healing over time. Inadequate indoor air quality adds to
employee health and well-being degradation, further reducing
productivity; the design solution should, therefore, incorporate
aspects that promote cooperation and teamwork among workers
and adaptable and ergonomic furniture to boost productivity.
Environmentally friendly materials and furnishings should also
be chosen to safeguard staﬀ health, well-being, and global
ecosystems (119). White et al. (120) report that spending at least
120 min a week in nature is associated with good health and well-
being, so stakeholders should pay attention to such a “threshold”
and actively develop possible weekly nature exposure guidelines
for their employees.

Gritzka et al. (121) conducted a systematic review of
the scientiﬁc evidence on the usefulness of nature-based
interventions in promoting mental health and well-being among
workers in real work contexts.

There is considerable consensus about the beneﬁcial impacts
of exposure to nature. For instance, natural elements decorated
with green in the oﬃce help with stress reduction, with red,
yellow, and orange stimulating positive emotions (122). Adding
one to three green plants to the oﬃce table facilitates employees’
productivity, focused attention, and stress reduction, hence
promoting well-being (123). Designing oﬃces with outdoor
natural window views promotes work productivity (124), and
equipping green areas in the community promotes dwellers’
sense of belonging and attachment (76). As a result, nature-
based interventions in the workplace have been advocated as
a cost-eﬀective strategy for promoting employee health (121).
Research on the eﬀect of green space on employee mental
health and well-being is worthy to assist in the design of
workplaces. Thus, we suggest that all stakeholders engage in
creating a restorative environment by, for instance, developing
a workplace equipped with a small green space (indoors: e.g.,
indoor garden, or outdoors near the workplace, 108), designing
an employee break room decorated with nature elements
(125), and exploiting virtual reality nature simulations [such as
playing a video with natural sceneries, (126)], and so on and
so forth.

links between restorative environment, ﬂow experience, and
city identity, this paper demonstrates how workplaces may
be structured to accommodate these aspects. These results
have implications for the planning and design of urban
business sites and the development of interventions to increase
employee well-being.

Creating restorative environment

Although numerous studies have indicated that the scenic
view of nature is restorative, many city workers may not
have ready access to natural settings in modern society.
Fieldhouse (107) ﬁnds that some characteristics of the plant-
human connection facilitate people’s engagement with their
environment, promoting their health, functional
level, and
subjective well-being. Due to the allotment’s embeddedness
within communities, it has enormous promise as a medium
for occupational therapy and a method for social integration.
The evidence for environmental restoration support is divided
into four categories: residential contexts, work and school
settings, care settings, and other settings. We concentrate only
on workplace interventions for young city workers. With the
importance of nature in the workplace (48), there is a wealth
of studies demonstrating a clear correlation between workers’
well-being and greenspace (108–110) as well as landscapes (111).
For instance, Bringslimark et al. (112) discovered that employees
in windowless oﬃces were more likely to bring plants to work
or decorate their oﬃce space with a photograph of nature
than those with a window view, which can be viewed as a

Flow interventions for city workers

Although several ﬂow-based interventions have been
developed and evaluated (127), most have targeted general
workers, not those who may not have ready access to natural
settings. According to Wöran and Arnberger (17),
leisure
specialization and restorative surroundings are linked to ﬂow
experience. It is widely proven that employees’ leisure activities
are related to recovery experiences,
job performance, and
subjective well-being (128–130). According to Caldwell (131),
leisure activities (e.g.,
learning how to generate a ﬂow-like
experience) may contribute to physical, social, emotional,
and cognitive health through prevention, coping (adjustment,
remediation, diversion), and transcendence. Flow is essential for
adherence to regular workplace physical activity, such as football
and Zumba (132). Also, the importance of mindfulness training
in the workplace cannot be overstated (133, 134).

Various factors can contribute to frontline employees’ job
ﬂow experience, such as personal factors, job characteristics,
and leadership (135, 136). Even in a dynamic workplace
environment, the rhythms of attentional states remain context
and time-dependent (137). Focus is most signiﬁcant in the
mid-afternoon, while boredom is at its peak in the early
afternoon. People are happiest while performing routine tasks
and most agitated when performing focused tasks. Mondays
are the most boring day of the week, but they are also the
most concentrated (138). While ﬂow-like experience is not
exclusive to leisure episodes, the more robust ﬂow experience
is more likely to occur during freely selected activities that
produce intrinsic interest for the receiver (139). Plester and
Hutchison (140) examined the relationship between fun and
workplace engagement using three distinct types of workplace
fun: managed, organic, and task fun. They discovered that
particular workplace fun provides individual employees with
a refreshing break, resulting in positive aﬀect and increased
workplace engagement and task engagement.

Martens (141) emphasized the value of setting aside time
and space for relaxation or taking a stroll after intense work to
relieve some of the stress associated with sitting and working
(e.g., writing, designing, etc.,) in one location, and justiﬁed the
inclusion of gaming rooms, relaxation lounges, and greenspace
in or near workplaces. Concentrated work is much easier when
surrounded by nature and without distractions. Suh et al.
(142) highlight the central role of the aesthetic experience on
gamiﬁcation in the workplace.

City identity interventions for city
workers

To our best knowledge, there are so far no city-identity-
based interventions focused on supporting city workers to
cope with work stress. We try to propose some potential
strategies inspired by place identity intervention. Research on
community attachment reveals that integration into the local
region signiﬁcantly predicts connection to place. Local social
interactions—particularly with friends, relatives, organizational
aﬃliations, and local shopping—are the most persistent and
substantial sources of emotional attachment to local locales
(145). Place identity is highly correlated with neighborhood
satisfaction (146). Second,
long-term residency leads to the
development of place identity; the length of stay strengthens
It also oﬀers a chronological
local
background for imbuing a place with personal signiﬁcance. The
Hukou system continues to be a barrier to Chinese migrant
workers; despite their economic, social/cultural, and identity
absorption into urban life over time, human capital plays a
critical role in migrants’ economic and identity integration
(148). Workers’
location
is connected to their sense of place identity and fairness

intention to leave their current

social bonds

(147).

The place identity is built via people’s cognitive identiﬁcation
and satisfaction with the place, as well as their aﬀective
enjoyment and sense of security when interacting with the
place. Place identity is a dynamic and dialectic process, and
the memory of a residential place has a positive relationship
with place identity and place attachment (150). Unsuitable
interventions will erode both the physical environment and
the sensation of attachment rooted in people’s attachment
(151). Thus, planners must incorporate visions of place identity
not only from politicians and economic interests but also
from residents and other members of civil society because
the identities ascribed to a place by various stakeholders are
contested and may play a role in social conﬂicts (152).

City identity may develop through individual, group,
or cultural processes. More recently, our
research team
has found that a better-perceived quality of the residential
place (i.e., neighborhood community)
is associated with
a higher
level of community identity (26). Community
involvement, including social bonds, community participation,

Therefore, governments, companies, and other stakeholders

High technology should also be introduced, such as a portable

green spaces aﬀect employee perceptions of job satisfaction
(164), so qualiﬁed leaders should be selected for young city
workers to collaborate with the faculty of forestry, the institute
of mental health, and the botanical garden in the local place

Study limitations

We identify the following points as deﬁning psychological
terms and
research on “city identity”: heterogeneity of
their spatial extension, divergent theoretical foundations and
fragmented formulations, a lack of appropriate measuring
instruments, and a scarcity of empirical work. This, combined
with the small number of studies simultaneously on the three
constructs, makes it challenging to identify a pattern and should
be considered when interpreting the results. The fundamental
aﬀective and cognitive ﬂow is likewise perceived diﬀerently by
various instruments. Thus, the continued development and use
of empirically validated measures is a critical next step for
research on the dynamic relationship between ﬂow, city identity,
and restorative environment. Another issue is that although
there were signiﬁcant overlaps between adopting ﬂow and
healthy environments, many studies only look at the restorative
environment (141). In a word, we try to put forward a conceptual
model within which the three constructs studied separately are
simultaneously discussed here.

This review represents the ﬁrst creative synthesis of the
speciﬁc mechanisms of the restorative environment through
which people’s ﬂow experience is associated with their city
theoretically coherent patterns.
identity, evidencing several
It should be noted, of course, that studies on a particular
pathway or process were sometimes too few to draw deﬁnitive
conclusions. This review should be considered preliminary, and
more work is needed to understand further and verify these clear
pathways. Nevertheless, this review can help orient researchers
to the paths by which a restorative environment can contribute
to city workers’ reduced stress, increased ﬂow, and stronger
city identity.

One limitation of the present review is that the literature
search is done from Google Scholar, only taking highly relevant
articles (the ﬁrst 300 items) into account. For this reason, more
complex and potential relationships may be discovered, and
comprehensive results may be obtained by examining as many
databases as possible in future work. Another limitation of
the present review is that there are various populations in the
modern city, such as teachers vs. students, elderly residents vs.
the young, and so on and so forth. However, in this study,
we only included and explored some feasible interventions
for city workers, therefore, further studies to qualitatively and
quantitatively explore other population groups might advance
our understanding of the inﬂuential factors for the development
of sustainable cities, park cities, and happy cities.

Implications

The current review advances related theories by identifying
pathways that explain how people’s ﬂow experience and city
identity are associated with the restorative environment and

(i.e.,

suggesting that a restorative environment could facilitate city
workers’ daily ﬂow experience and city identity. We have
explored the possibility of combining the three constructs of
ﬂow, city identity, and restorative environment to propose
interventions in today’s stressful workplace. The conceptual
model guiding this review posits that exposure to natural
environments predicts positive change in people’s positive
aﬀective and cognitive experiences such as ﬂow, which impacts
their attitudes, belongingness, perceived values and norms,
inﬂuencing their working city identities and behaviors. We
believe that ﬂow, city identity, and restorative environment are
among the most signiﬁcant topics in Positive Environmental

examining the interventions that may contribute to city workers’
subjective well-being. This review makes a timely, theoretical
contribution to the study of
the restorative environment.
Most scholarly attention is given to direct relations between
a restorative environment and people’s better health, and so
little is known regarding the explanatory processes that account
for these associations. The present review addresses this need
by sensitizing researchers to the social-cognitive mechanisms
through which a restorative environment might
inﬂuence
people’s optimal enjoyment and identity and make it more
or less eﬀective over these social-cognitive mechanisms. The
practical implications are that urban planners and company
managers who act in turbulent environments may include new
relationships between relevant and current variables in their
city/workplace design, such as those associated with the city
identity and restorative environment. These new approaches
may help business executives use interventions that approach
more of the business reality, making their workplace more
harmonious and enjoyable.

Conclusion

Through the lens of environmental psychology and positive
psychology via restorative environment and positive aﬀective
and cognitive experience of ﬂow, the present work attempts
to develop a novel conceptual model by emphasizing that
engaging in the natural restorative environment is inducive to
the universal human experience of enjoyable ﬂow and enhanced
city identity, as well as their stress recovery and well-being.
To date, no systematic research has contemporarily addressed
the underlying mechanisms among these three constructs.
Therefore, this review represents a starting point and hopes
to encourage further empirical research on how to assist city
workers’ well-being and develop sustainable cities through brief
and practical nature-based interventions for facilitating ﬂow and
city identity. We hope there could be further cues for a positive
environmental psychology agenda to promote city workers’
