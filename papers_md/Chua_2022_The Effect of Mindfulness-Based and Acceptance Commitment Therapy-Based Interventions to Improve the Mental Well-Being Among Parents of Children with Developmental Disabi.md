Abstract
Parents of children with developmental disabilities are susceptible to mental health problems. Mindfulness-based and accept-
ance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based interventions can improve their mental well-being. This review examined the 
effectiveness of mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions in improving mental well-being and mindfulness among 
parents of children with developmental disabilities. Six electronic databases were searched, resulting in the inclusion of ten 
studies published between 2014 and 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effect model. The results suggest 
that mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions were effective in decreasing parental stress, anxiety and depression, 
however, the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing parental mindfulness was inconclusive. Based on these find-
ings, we discussed considerations for implementing interventions and identified areas which warrant further research.

Introduction

Background

Developmental disabilities are a group of conditions that 
impairs one’s physical, learning, language or behavior areas 
(Rubin and Crocker 1989). They include autism spectrum 
disorder  (ASD),  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder 
(ADHD), developmental delay, intellectual or cognitive dis-
abilities, cerebral palsy, hearing losses, vision impairments, 
and learning disabilities (CDC 2019). They usually manifest 
during childhood and affect one’s daily functioning ability 
for a lifetime (Rubin and Crocker 1989). A recent study con-
ducted in the United States showed that the proportion of

children diagnosed with a developmental disability increased 
from 16.2% in 2011 to 17.8% in 2017 (Zablotsky et al., 
2019). Globally, the number of people diagnosed with ASD, 
ADHD and intellectual disabilities increased from 1990s to 
2017 (Ritchie 2020). The significant challenges associated 
with raising a child with a developmental disability cause 
parents of this group of children to experience higher stress 
levels and place them at higher risks of developing mental 
health problems (Carroll 2013; Estes et al. 2012). A previous 
study found that high levels of depressive symptoms were 
found in a third of mothers with developmentally disabled 
children (Singer 2006). Another study conducted on par-
ents of children with complex needs reported that parents 
struggled significantly more to manage their child’s psy-
chosocial needs instead of their physical limitations, result-
ing in them becoming mentally drained; an estimated 40% 
of them show signs of psychiatric distress (Thurston et al. 
2011). Due to their poor mental well-being, these parents 
were also more susceptible to a plethora of physical health 
problems such as headaches, insomnia, muscle pains, high 
blood pressure, arthritis and stomach ulcers (Gallagher and 
Whiteley 2012; Lovell et al. 2012). Poor parental mental 
and physical health deserve attention because they directly

affect children’s health outcomes (Karazsia and Wildman 
2009). For instance, children of depressed parents are prone 
to developing depression themselves and the estimated rates 
of depression among children of depressed parents range 
from 20 to 40% (Goodman 2007). Therefore, there is a need 
to develop and implement interventions that promote mental 
well-being among parents of children with developmental 
disabilities.

The first step to improving one’s mental well-being is 
decreasing one’s stress level (Baum and Posluszny 1999). 
Stress can be defined as the experience of negative emo-
tions brought about by various physiological, biochemical, 
cognitive and behavioral changes faced in life (Baum 1990). 
Chronic stress has shown to result in psychiatric distress, in 
the forms of anxiety disorders and major depressive disor-
ders (Khan and Khan 2017). Therefore, addressing stress 
early is of paramount importance, especially for parents of 
children with developmental disabilities, who are prone to 
high stress levels. Psychoeducation and cognitive behavio-
ral therapy (CBT) interventions have a longstanding his-
tory in stress management. They aim to teach one how to 
identify his or her source of stress and reduce it. However, 
evidence has suggested that these methods are not appropri-
ate for reducing the stress of those caring for people with 
developmental disabilities and can increase their stress levels 
instead (Devereux et al. 2009; Noone and Hastings 2010). 
For instance, some parents of children with developmental 
disabilities who underwent CBT, reported that their daily 
concerns were dismissed and termed as ‘invalid’, hence 
adding to their frustrations (Singer et al. 2007). In recent 
years, researchers have explored the use of mindfulness-
based interventions to manage the stress of these parents by 
educating them to accept their stress instead of removing or 
controlling their stressors (Lindahl 2015).

Mindfulness can be defined as the state of consciousness 
that one achieves by purposefully paying attention in each 
present moment in a non-judgmental manner (Kabat‐Zinn 
2003). Practicing mindfulness can improve one’s attention 
and tolerance for unpleasant thoughts and emotions, hence 
allowing one to cope with life stressors better (Baer 2003). 
Mindfulness-based interventions include Mindfulness-Based 
Stress Reduction (MBSR) (Kabat-Zinn 1990), Mindfulness-
Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (Teasdale et al. 1995) and 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (Hayes et al. 
1999). MBSR focuses on helping participants to enhance 
their  awareness  of  the  present  moment  as  they  undergo 
guided mindfulness practices that cover many aspects of 
daily life such as breathing, bodily sensations, movement 
and eating (Semple and Hatt 2012). It aims to increase one’s 
general well-being by relieving one’s stress and anxiety 
that accompanies daily life and chronic illness (Praissman 
2008). MBCT combines the mindfulness practices of MBSR 
with the principles of CBT (Segal and Williams 2001). In 

addition to helping participants develop a heightened aware-
ness of themselves, MBCT teaches participants to view their 
personal negative ruminative thoughts and feelings as tran-
sient events of their mind rather than unchangeable truths. It 
also teaches participants to identity their negative thoughts 
early and disengage from them to prevent themselves from 
entering a depressive cycle. MBCT was primarily developed 
to treat clinically depressed patients (Semple and Hatt 2012). 
On the other hand, ACT combines mindfulness principles 
with acceptance and behavioral therapies (Hayes and Stro-
sahl 2004). It utilizes the principle of mindfulness to get 
participants to attain the awareness of their thoughts in the 
present moment and emotions before teaching them ways to 
accept and detach from them (Noone and Hastings 2010). 
ACT also focuses on helping participants to develop psycho-
logical flexibility, identify personal values and commitment 
to make changes (Hayes et al. 1999).

Both mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions 
have shown promising results in reducing stress, depression 
and anxiety across different populations such as pregnant 
mothers, students and parents of children with special needs 
(Fung et al. 2018; Petcharat and Liehr 2017; Zhang et al. 
2015). This demonstrates their ability to help improve the 
wellbeing of parents with children who have development 
disability. Duncan and colleagues theorized that when par-
ents become more mindful, their mental well-being as well 
as their parenting skills will improve (Duncan et al. 2009). 
Being more mindful will allow them to have greater emo-
tional awareness and self-regulation, hence improving their 
mental health. Moreover, learning to view themselves and 
others in a compassionate and non-judgmental manner will 
greatly improve their interactions with their children (Dun-
can et al. 2009). Therefore, mindfulness-based and ACT-
based interventions for parents with children with develop-
mental disabilities warrant more scrutiny.

Current Literature

There is limited literature that examined the effectiveness of 
mindfulness and ACT-based interventions on parental mental 
well-being. In addition, there are methodological flaws in the 
available literature. To date, five systematic reviews examined 
the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (Burgdorf 
et al. 2019; Hartley et al. 2019; Rayan and Ahmad 2018; Soh-
maran and Shorey 2019; Townshend et al. 2016), one system-
atic review examined the effectiveness of ACT-based interven-
tions (Byrne et al. 2020) and one systematic review examined 
the effectiveness of both mindfulness-based and ACT-based 
interventions (Osborn et al. 2020) on the mental well-being of 
parents. The focus of these reviews were either very narrow, 
that is, only involving parents of children with ASD (Hartley 
et al. 2019), or too broad when parents of children from the 
general population who do not have any clinical conditions 

1 32772

as well as children with clinical diagnoses such as depres-
sion and developmental disabilities were engaged (Burgdorf 
et al. 2019; Byrne et al. 2020; Townshend et al. 2016). Three 
reviews focused on parents of children with developmental 
disabilities (Osborn et al. 2020; Rayan and Ahmad 2018; Soh-
maran and Shorey 2019), while two other reviews conducted 
secondary analyses on the well-being of parents with devel-
opmentally disabled children (Burgdorf et al. 2019; Byrne 
et al. 2020). Three reviews analyzed the outcomes of parental 
mental well-being and mindfulness but failed to conduct meta-
analyses (Byrne et al. 2020; Osborn et al. 2020; Rayan and 
Ahmad, 2018), hence compromising the strength of their find-
ings (Impellizzeri and Bizzini, 2012). Burgdorf et al. (2019) 
conducted meta-analyses for the parental stress outcome but 
included data from studies without control groups and hence 
did not isolate the impact of the independent variable such 
as mindfulness-based interventions on parental stress (Hunter 
et al. 2016). On the other hand, Sohmaran and Shorey (2019) 
conducted subgroup analysis to analyze the effect of type of 
psychological intervention on parental stress. As there was 
only one study in the mindfulness subgroup, the effectiveness 
of mindfulness-based interventions on parental stress could not 
be determined. Therefore, further rigorous reviews are needed 
to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based and ACT-
based interventions on improving mental well-being among 
parents of children with developmental disabilities.

Aim

This review aimed to consolidate evidence on mindfulness-
based and ACT-based interventions with respect to stress 
(primary outcome), anxiety, depression, and mindfulness 
(secondary  outcomes)  among  parents  of  children  with 
developmental disabilities. It was hypothesized that mind-
fulness-based and ACT-based interventions were effective at 
decreasing parental stress, anxiety and depression, in addi-
tion to increasing parental mindfulness at immediate post-
intervention and follow-up time points.

Methods

This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines (Moher et al. 2009). A protocol can be found on 
PROSPERO (CRD42020191783).

Eligibility Criteria

Population

or caregivers who cared for the child in a parental capacity. 
A child is anyone up to 19 years of age as defined by the 
World Health Organization (WHO 2013). Developmental 
disabilities include ASD, ADHD, developmental delays, 
intellectual or cognitive disabilities, cerebral palsy, hearing 
losses, vision impairments and learning disabilities (CDC 
2019).

Intervention

Studies that conducted either mindfulness-based or ACT-
based  interventions  or  a  combination  of  both  that  were 
delivered to parents of children with developmental disabil-
ities with an aim to improve their mental well-being were 
included. Interventions that were delivered to either both 
parents and children or parents only were included. Studies 
that conducted mindfulness-based and/or ACT-based inter-
ventions on children only were excluded. Non-mindfulness-
based and non-ACT-based interventions were also excluded.

Comparator

Studies with control groups that underwent no intervention, 
placebo interventions, standard care, or wait-list control 
were included.

Outcomes

The included studies had to measure self-reported parental 
stress pre- and post-intervention. Immediate post-interven-
tion levels of parental stress were regarded as the review’s 
primary  outcome.  The  secondary  outcomes  were  self-
reported parental anxiety, depression and mindfulness, and 
need not be measured by all included studies. Any follow-up 
measurements for all outcome measures were regarded as 
secondary outcomes.

Study Design

Only clinical controlled trials (CCTs), randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs), and cluster RCTs were included.

Language and Publication status

English-only peer-reviewed journal articles or unpublished 
dissertations were included. Other forms of grey literature, 
such  as  conference  proceedings,  posters,  book  reviews, 
abstracts, and brief summaries, were excluded.

Study Selection

Parents of children with developmental disabilities were 
included in this review. In this review, the term ‘parent’ 
applies to the child’s biological or foster parents, guardians, 

The PRISMA flow diagram guided the study selection pro-
cess (Moher et al. 2009). Relevant studies were searched 

1 3

from six electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, 
PsycINFO,  Web  of  Science,  and  ProQuest)  from  their 
respective inception dates to May 2020. The key search 
terms used were variations of (“child” OR “adolescent” 
OR “teen” OR “youth”) AND (“parent” OR “father” OR 
“mother” OR “caregiver” OR “guardian”) AND (“mindful-
ness” OR “acceptance commitment therapy”) AND (“devel-
opmental disorder” OR “autism” OR “asd” OR “adhd” OR 
“cerebral palsy” OR “intellectual disability” OR “hearing 
disability” OR “visual disorder” OR “learning disorder”). 
Variations of (“random” OR “control” OR “assign” OR 
“allocate” OR “trial” OR “group” OR “volunteer”) were 
added to the search strategy to select for RCTs and CCTs. 
The reference lists of relevant reviews and included articles 
were also examined, and backward searching was conducted 
to find additional relevant studies. When the full texts of 
potential studies were not available, their authors were con-
tacted to obtain the papers. All search results were exported 
to Endnote Version X8 (Clarivate Analytics 2019), where 
they were categorized according to their databases and had 
their duplicates removed. All studies had their titles and 
abstracts screened against the eligibility criteria. Then, the 
full texts of selected studies were further analyzed to decide 
their inclusion statuses. This study selection process was 
conducted independently by two reviewers, and discussions 
were held to resolve any discrepancies that arose.

Data Extraction

A data extraction form was used to extract pertinent char-
acteristics related to the study’s sample, design, data man-
agement, outcomes measured, intervention duration, format 
and delivery method. The mean and standard deviation val-
ues of the review’s primary and secondary outcomes were 
extracted. When these specific values were not provided, 
existing data were transformed using relevant formulas to 
obtain the values (Higgins and Green 2011). This process 
was performed independently by two reviewers and disa-
greements were resolved via discussions.

Quality Appraisal

The Cochrane’s risk of bias tool was used to evaluate risk of 
bias at the study level. Five types of biases in seven domains 
were  examined:  random  sequence  generation  (selection 
bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of 
participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of 
outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome 
data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), 
and other sources of bias (Higgins and Green 2011). Each 
domain was graded a ‘low’ or ‘high’ risk depending on 
each study’s details and an ‘unclear’ risk was given when 
inadequate details were available. Overall bias rating was 

determined by the worst score that each study received for 
any domain (Kempler et al. 2016). As a minimum of ten 
studies in a forest plot was recommended to produce a mean-
ingful funnel plot to analyze publication bias, publication 
bias was not assessed in this review because there was no 
forest plot with at least ten studies (Sterne et al. 2011).

The quality of the overall body of evidence at the out-
come level was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low 
according  to  the  GRADE  approach.  All  outcomes  were 
initially rated as high quality, but this rating was dropped 
when any of the five following factors were compromised: 
risk of bias of individual studies, inconsistency, directness 
of evidence, precision of effect estimates, and publication 
bias (Higgins and Green 2011). All outcomes were rated 
separately using the online GRADEpro software (GRADE-
pro 2015). Both reviewers conducted the quality appraisal 
process independently and disagreements were resolved via 
discussions.

Data Synthesis

The characteristics of the included studies and the interven-
tions were summarized narratively. Meta-analyses were con-
ducted to pool data with the same outcomes using Review 
Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, 
The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) under 
the random-effect model. As the included studies used dif-
ferent scales to measure each outcome, standardized mean 
differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
used as the effect measure under the inverse-variance method 
(Higgins and Green 2011). Effect sizes were defined as very 
small, small, medium, large, very large, and huge according 
to their values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, and 2.0, respectively 
(Sawilowsky 2009). However, as two distinct outcomes of 
mindfulness were reported in the included studies (inter-
personal mindfulness in parenting and parental mindfulness 
awareness), separate meta-analyses were conducted for each.
The heterogeneity of the results was assessed using the  I2 
statistics and Cochran Q chi-squared test. As per Cochrane 
hand book (Higgins and Green 2011), the  I2 values were 
interpreted as low importance (≤ 40%), moderate (30–60%), 
substantial (50–90%), and considerable (75–100%). For the 
chi-squared test, statistically significant heterogeneity was 
identified when its corresponding p-value was less than 0.10 
(Higgins and Green 2011). Subgroup analyses were con-
ducted to reduce heterogeneity levels and analyze the effect 
of certain variables on the outcomes investigated (Higgins 
and Green 2011; Sedgwick 2014). The variables analyzed 
were type of intervention, geographical distribution of study, 
and intervention duration. One study that only used the dis-
tress subscale of the Parenting Stress Index–Short Form to 
measure parental stress levels, unlike the other included 
studies that measured total parental stress, was narratively 

1 32774

synthesized (Neece 2014). Hilkey (2019) was also narra-
tively synthesized and it was an unreviewed master’s disser-
tation with exceptionally low number of participants (three 
in intervention group; two in control group).

Results

Search Outcomes

A total of 1,753 articles were found from the six listed elec-
tronic databases and relevant reference lists. After removing 
561 duplicates and excluding 1,101 articles based on their 
titles and abstracts, 91 articles were left for full-text screen-
ing. The full-text screening excluded another 81 articles, 
leaving ten relevant articles to be included in this review. 
Seven were peer-reviewed primary studies (Behbahani et al. 
2018; Corti et al. 2018; Lo et al. 2017, 2020; Neece 2014; 
Rayan and Ahmad 2017; Whittingham et al. 2016), while 
three were unpublished dissertations (Hilkey 2019; Petch-
arat 2018; Zody 2018). Figure 1 details the PRISMA flow 
diagram.

Characteristics of the Included Studies

The ten included studies were conducted in seven differ-
ent  countries—Iran  (n = 1),  Jordan  (n = 1),  Hong  Kong 
(n = 2),  Thailand  (n = 1),  Italy  (n = 1),  Australia  (n = 1), 
and the United States of America (n = 3)—that collectively 
analyzed 614 parents of children with developmental dis-
abilities. Seven studies focused on parents of children with 
specific conditions—ADHD (n = 2), autism or ASD (n = 4), 
and cerebral palsy (n = 1)—while three studies recruited par-
ents of children with a mixture of ASD, ADHD, and other 
developmental disabilities such as developmental delays 
and intellectual disabilities (Lo et al. 2017; Neece 2014; 
Petcharat 2018). There were seven RCTs and three CCTs. 
Four studies conducted ACT-based interventions, while the 
rest conducted mindfulness-based interventions (Corti et al. 
2018; Hilkey 2019; Whittingham et al. 2016; Zody 2018). 
No study conducted a combination of mindfulness-based 
and ACT-based interventions. Nine studies conducted face-
to-face group-based interventions that utilized interactive 
teaching methods (group discussions, mindfulness exer-
cises, and activity worksheets), with two studies adopting 
mixed methods such as phone call consultations in addition 
to the face-to-face group sessions to deliver the intervention 
(Rayan and Ahmad 2017; Whittingham et al. 2016). One 
study designed an interactive online course for its partici-
pants to complete the course independently (Hilkey 2019). 
The summary of included studies is presented in Table 1.

Quality Appraisal (Study Level)

The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risks 
of bias for all included trials. The overall bias was rated as 
unclear for two studies and high for the remaining studies 
(Hilkey 2019; Lo et al. 2017). Inter-rater agreement among 
both reviewers was approximately 97%, and the Cohen’s 
kappa value was 0.95. The risk of bias summary is shown 
in Online Resource 1, Fig. S1.

Parental Stress Scores at Immediate 
Post‑Intervention

A meta-analysis was conducted for the eight studies that 
assessed  parental  stress  immediately  post-intervention 
(Behbahani et al. 2018; Corti et al. 2018; Lo et al. 2017, 
2020; Petcharat 2018; Rayan and Ahmad 2017; Whittingham 
et al. 2016; Zody 2018). It showed a statistically significant 
medium effect among 563 participants, favoring the inter-
vention group (SMD = − 0.50, 95% CI: − 0.88 to − 0.11, 
Z = 2.51, p = 0.01), with significant substantial statistical 
heterogeneity  (I2 = 77%, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a).

Parental stress was not affected by intervention type and 
intervention duration as the subgroup analyses for these fac-
tors revealed statistically non-significant subgroup differ-
ences (p ≥ 0.05) (Online Resource 1, Fig. S2.1 and S2.3).

A subgroup analysis according to geographical distribu-
tion showed statistically significant subgroup differences 
 (I2 = 91.1%, p < 0.0001) and reduced heterogeneity to low 
levels for the Middle Eastern countries subgroup  (I2 = 12%, 
p = 0.29),  the  Western  countries  subgroup   (I2 = 22%, 
p = 0.28),  and  the  Asian  countries  subgroup   (I2 = 0%, 
p = 0.48). The Middle Eastern countries subgroup had a 
statistically significant very large effect, while the Western 
countries subgroup had a statistically significant small effect 
and the Asian countries subgroup had a statistically non-
significant very small effect (Online Resource 1, Fig. S2.2).

Parental Anxiety Scores at Immediate 
Post‑Intervention

A meta-analysis was conducted for the four studies that 
assessed parental anxiety immediately post-intervention 
(Petcharat 2018; Rayan and Ahmad 2017; Whittingham 
et al. 2016; Zody 2018). It showed a statistically signifi-
cant medium effect among 185 participants, favoring the 
intervention group (SMD = − 0.63, 95% CI: − 0.93 to − 0.34, 
Z = 4.17,  p < 0.0001),  with  low  statistical  heterogeneity 
 (I2 = 0%, p = 0.52) (Fig. 2b).

Parental anxiety was not affected by intervention type, 
geographical distribution and intervention duration as the

Parental Depression Scores at Immediate 
Post‑Intervention

A  meta-analysis  was  conducted  for  the  five  studies  that 
assessed parental depression immediately post-intervention 
(Lo et al. 2017; Neece 2014; Rayan and Ahmad 2017; Whit-
tingham et al. 2016; Zody 2018). It showed a statistically 
significant medium effect among 389 participants, favoring 

the intervention group (SMD = − 0.72, 95% CI: − 1.34 to 
− 0.10, Z = 2.26, p = 0.02), with significant substantial to 
considerable statistical heterogeneity  (I2 = 86%, p < 0.0001) 
(Fig. 2c).

Parental depression was not affected by intervention type 
and intervention duration as the subgroup analyses for these 
factors revealed statistically non-significant subgroup differ-
ences (p ≥ 0.05) (Online Resource 1, Fig. S4.1 and S4.3).

Parental Mindfulness

There are two aspects of parental mindfulness covered by the 
studies in this review: interpersonal mindfulness in parenting 
and parental mindfulness awareness. Interpersonal mindful-
ness in parenting measures the degree of mindfulness par-
ents show when interacting with their children (de Bruin 
et al. 2014). Conversely, mindfulness awareness measures 
one’s overall ability to be aware of each present moment, 
which is non-specific to parenting (Brown and Ryan 2003).

Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scores 
at Immediate Post‑Intervention

A meta-analysis was conducted for the two studies that 
assessed interpersonal mindfulness in parenting immedi-
ately post-intervention (Lo et al. 2017, 2020). It showed 
a statistically non-significant negligible effect among 280 
participants, favoring the intervention group (SMD = 0.01, 

95% CI: − 0.23 to 0.24, Z = 0.06, p = 0.96), with low sta-
tistical heterogeneity  (I2 = 0%, p = 0.91) (Online Resource 
1, Fig. S5.1). No subgroup analyses were conducted for 
this outcome.

Parental Mindfulness Awareness Scores at Immediate 
Post‑Intervention

A meta-analysis was conducted for the two studies that 
assessed parental mindfulness awareness post-intervention 
(Corti et al. 2018; Petcharat 2018). It showed a statistically 
non-significant small effect among 64 participants, favor-
ing the control group (SMD = − 0.33, 95% CI: − 1.67 to 
1.00, Z = 0.49, p = 0.62), with statistically significant sub-
stantial to considerable statistical heterogeneity  (I2 = 84%, 
p = 0.01) (Online Resource 1, Fig. S5.2). No subgroup 
analyses were conducted for this outcome.

Quality Appraisal (Outcome Level)

The GRADE approach was used to conduct quality appraisal 
at the outcome level. The following outcomes were rated as 
very low quality: (1) parental stress, (2) parental anxiety, (3) 
parental depression, and (4) parental mindfulness awareness. 
The outcome of interpersonal mindfulness in parenting was 
rated high quality. The GRADE summary of evidence is 
presented in Online Resource 2, Table S1.

Narrative Synthesis

Only one study used the parental distress subscale of the Par-
enting Stress Index–Short Form to measure parental stress 
levels, unlike the other included studies that measured total 
parental stress, and was hence excluded from the meta-anal-
yses (Neece 2014). At post-intervention, the intervention 
group reported statistically significantly lower stress levels 
compared to those of the control group. A medium effect 
size of 0.70 was reported. Hilkey (2019) was also excluded 
from meta-analyses as it was an unreviewed master’s disser-
tation and had an exceptionally low number of participants. 
The study reported a statistically non-significant very small 
effect of 0.17, favoring the control group at post-intervention 
(Hilkey 2019).

Only four studies conducted follow-up measurements at 
various timepoints (Behbahani et al. 2018; Petcharat 2018; 
Whittingham  et  al.  2016;  Zody  2018).  However,  three 
out of four did not provide follow-up data for the control 
group, hence meta-analyses could not be conducted (Petch-
arat 2018; Whittingham et al. 2016; Zody 2018). Petcharat 
(2018) reported that the intervention group did not show any 
statistically significant increase in stress and anxiety scores, 
or decrease in mindfulness awareness scores at the two-week 
follow-up compared to post-intervention. Both Whittingham 
et al. (2016) and Zody (2018) reported that their respective 
intervention groups did not show any statistically signifi-
cant increase in stress, anxiety, and depression scores at the 
six-month and the three-month follow-up respectively, com-
pared to post-intervention. As for Behbehani et al. (2018), 
the parental stress scores of the intervention group at the 
eight-week follow-up were statistically significantly lower 
than those of the control group.

Discussion

This review examined the effect of mindfulness-based and 
ACT-based  interventions  on  improving  stress,  anxiety, 
depression and mindfulness among parents of children with 
developmental disabilities. The results from the meta-anal-
yses showed that both mindfulness-based and ACT-based 
interventions were effective in decreasing stress, anxiety and 

depression among parents of children with developmental 
disabilities. This shows that promoting mindfulness among 
parents of children with developmental disabilities can help 
to improve their mental well-being. Similar results have 
been reported by previous reviews that analyzed the effect 
of mindfulness-based interventions on stress among parents 
of children with developmental disabilities (Burgdorf et al. 
2019; Rayan and Ahmad 2018). However, the current review 
did not show significant improvement for both outcomes of 
parental mindfulness (interpersonal mindfulness in parent-
ing and parental mindfulness awareness) post-intervention. 
The findings from this study differed from those reported 
by Rayan and Ahmad (2018) which reported improvements 
in parental mindfulness at post-intervention for five out of 
six trials. As Rayan and Ahmad (2018) did not conduct 
meta-analysis and analyzed data from trials without con-
trol groups, direct comparisons could not be drawn. This 
review’s lack of improvement in mindfulness scores could 
have been contributed by the participants’ initial self-report-
ing of higher mindfulness scores due to social desirability 
bias; they could have realized their own limitations at post-
intervention and were more likely to rate themselves hon-
estly (Coatsworth et al. 2015). Moreover, their inadequate 
understanding of mindfulness pre-intervention could have 
resulted in them scoring themselves higher. After under-
going the intervention, they would have acquired a better 
understanding of mindfulness and hence scored themselves 
more accurately (Coatsworth et al. 2015). Both factors could 
account for the lower scores of mindfulness reported by the 
intervention groups post-intervention.

Another previous study suggested that the lower post-
intervention mindfulness scores demonstrated an increase in 
psychological awareness brought about by the intervention, 
and indicated the possibility of improvements in the future 
(Corti et al. 2018). This is further substantiated by other 
studies which reported marked improvement in mindful-
ness scores at follow-up timepoints only (Gould et al. 2018; 
Kohtala et al. 2017). As only four included studies meas-
ured parental mindfulness, conclusive findings could not be 
provided in this review. Hence, future trials should make 
it a point to assess mindfulness scores at immediate post-
intervention and follow-up timepoints to better examine the 
effectiveness of mindfulness-based and ACT-based interven-
tions in improving parental mindfulness. However, there is a 
possibility that mindfulness-based and ACT-based interven-
tions might not increase parental mindfulness among parents 
of children with development disabilities. Since almost all 
the studies conducted group-based interventions, the parents 
might have reported improvement in mental well-being post-
intervention due to the social support that they received by 
being in contact with other parents who were facing simi-
lar parenting challenges (Zody 2018). Future studies could 
conduct  comparison  trials  between  group-based  versus 

1 3

2779

individual-based mindfulness-based and ACT-based inter-
ventions to further examine the influence of social support 
on parents’ mental well-being and mindfulness.

The results showed no significant difference in paren-
tal stress, anxiety, and depression between the scores of 
mindfulness-based and ACT-based subgroups, indicating 
that both types of interventions might be similarly effective 
in promoting mental well-being among parents of children 
with developmental disabilities. This could be due to the 
same mindfulness principle used in both types of inter-
ventions. These interventions also encouraged their par-
ticipants to adopt the coping approach to deal with stress, 
which has been advised as suitable for prolonged stressors 
such as caring for a developmentally disabled child for an 
extended period of time (Mullen and Suls 1982). However, 
this review’s analysis was limited to only the immediate 
post-intervention timepoint due to a lack of follow-up data 
for most studies. Hence, further research, especially those 
related to follow-up assessments, should be conducted to 
explore the differences between the effectiveness of mind-
fulness-based interventions and ACT-based interventions on 
short-term and long-term parental mental well-being.

Evidence suggests that the studies conducted in the Mid-
dle Eastern countries were more effective in reducing paren-
tal stress, anxiety and depression compared to studies con-
ducted in Western and Asian countries. Although subgroup 
analyses according to geographical location for parental anx-
iety showed non-significant subgroup differences, the Mid-
dle Eastern countries subgroup reported a statistically sig-
nificant large effect while the Western countries and Asian 
countries subgroups reported statistically non-significant 
results. Studies conducted in the Middle Eastern countries 
could have reported greater improvements in parental mental 
well-being because the Muslim participants were able to 
integrate mindfulness practices into their daily lives more 
easily. A previous mindfulness-based program conducted on 
Muslim women discovered that the participants were able to 
spontaneously make connections between mindfulness prac-
tices and their own religious practices such as daily prayers 
(Thomas et al. 2016). As an estimated 99% of Iranians and 
92% of Jordanians are Muslims (The Embassy of the Hash-
emite Kingdom of Jordan 2020; World Population Review 
2020), the participants of the studies conducted in the Mid-
dle Eastern countries may have been more receptive to adopt 
mindfulness practices as part of their daily routine because 
these practices strongly resemble those of their own reli-
gious practices. The participants of the included study in this 
review (Rayan and Ahmad 2017) could have found it even 
easier as their mindfulness program included elements from 
Islamic teachings. In an another study, a depressed Christian 
client who underwent mindfulness-based therapy said that 
the non-judgmental and self-compassionate principles of 
mindfulness reflected God’s nature and that this connection 

helped her to recover from depression better (Hathaway and 
Tan 2009). Mindfulness and ACT also share similar links of 
self-compassion and acceptance with the principles of Bud-
dhism (Santiago and Gall 2016; Semple and Hatt, 2012). A 
previous study that integrated Buddhist teachings in an ACT 
program for patients with chronic major mood and anxiety 
disorders reported positive changes in patients’ conditions, 
and one patient even remitted shortly after the program 
(Fung 2015). Therefore, mindfulness practices can become 
more meaningful when participants link them to their own 
religious and spiritual beliefs.

A subgroup analysis on intervention duration (one day, up 
to one month, between one to three months, and longer than 
three months) showed no significant differences (based on 
the duration) between the effectiveness of mindfulness-based 
and ACT-based interventions on parental stress, anxiety, and 
depression. However, significant improvements in parental 
stress, anxiety and depression were reported for the ‘up to 
one month’ category, while the other intervention duration 
categories reported non-significant results. This is in con-
trast with a previous review that reported no relationship 
between the duration of the mindfulness-based intervention 
and parenting stress (Burgdorf et al. 2019). However, as the 
review analyzed parents of children with and without clinical 
diagnoses such as depression and developmental disabili-
ties, direct comparisons could not be drawn (Burgdorf et al. 
2019). Recent studies have reported that for mindfulness 
practices to bring about optimum mental health benefits, 
they need to be conducted regularly (Chiam et al. 2020; Sea-
brook et al. 2020). However, longer interventions have also 
been found to be ineffective due to problems such as poor 
attendance rates. An increase in attrition rate from around 
9% at immediate post-intervention timepoint to over 50% 
at the six-month follow-up for the intervention group was 
observed in one of the included studies which conducted 
the longest follow-up time period (Whittingham et al. 2016). 
This can be especially problematic for this group of parents 
as childcare arrangements for children with developmental 
disabilities may be harder to make due to their children’s 
challenging behavioral problems (Beer et al. 2013; Lloyd 
and  Hastings 2009).  Hence,  parents  may  not  be  able  to 
attend multiple intervention sessions due to the lack of avail-
able childcare. Specialized schools catering to children with 
developmental disabilities can help with the childcare issue 
by engaging experienced mindfulness and ACT trainers to 
conduct such programs for parents of special needs children 
at their schools while their children are attending lessons. 
Therefore, future intervention programs can consider mul-
tiple sessions up to one month long to instill the notion of 
regular mindfulness practice as well as organize interven-
tion programs when children are engaged at school to avoid 
attendance issues due to difficult childcare arrangements.

Limitations

This review has limitations. Only trials and dissertations 
published in English were included, which may pose poten-
tial  publication  bias.  All  studies  utilized  the  self-report 
method to assess the outcomes of parental mental well-being 
and mindfulness, and this can result in risks of social desir-
ability bias. Seven out of the ten included studies had small 
sample sizes, and this may have compromised the results’ 
reliability and validity. Due to the limited number of overall 
included studies (only 10 included studies and eight included 
in meta-analysis), and the fact that not all studies assessed 
outcomes of parental stress, anxiety and depression, some 
subgroup analysis ended up having only one or two studies 
in each subgroup. This could potentially affect the results’ 
reliability and validity. Only four studies conducted follow-
up assessments, and only one out of the four conducted 
follow-up assessments on both the intervention and control 
groups, limiting the review’s ability to examine the durabil-
ity of the intervention effects. Although a subgroup analysis 
according to geographical distribution was conducted, sub-
group analyses based on ethnicity and religion could not be 
conducted as each trial was conducted on a mixture of ethnic 
groups and religions. Hence, the variables of ethnicity and 
religion were not explored. Future research should consider 
examining these variables. Baseline disparities between the 
intervention and control groups were not considered in this 
review as only endpoint data were extracted for meta-anal-
yses instead of mean differences. Four out of five outcomes 
were rated as very low quality via the GRADE approach, 
indicating that the true effect size is likely to be significantly 
different from this review’s effect size estimates. Lastly, this 
review could not examine the effect of children’s age or type 
of developmental disability on parental mental well-being 
and mindfulness due to the wide age range of the children 
included in the studies and their different developmental dis-
abilities. As evidence suggests that parents’ stress levels are 
affected by their child’s age and type of developmental dis-
ability, future research should seek to explore these variables 
(DePape and Lindsay 2015). All these limitations may limit 
the accuracy of this review’s findings.

Implications for Future Practice and Research

Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who conduct regular 
medical reviews for children with development disabilities 
can adopt family-focused approaches and offer mindfulness-
based and ACT-based therapies to improve these parents’ 
mental well-being. The use of technology can be explored 
as an additional mode of intervention delivery to maximize 
attendance rates. Various types of technology, such as web-
based and virtual reality, have been proven to be effective in 
delivering mindfulness-based interventions (Seabrook et al. 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2022) 52:2770–2783

2020; Sevilla-Llewellyn-Jones et al. 2018), and future trials 
can consider using technology to support parents. In light of 
the current COVID-19 pandemic situation where anxiety is 
heightened and daily schedules are disrupted, technology-
based interventions should be developed and implemented for 
parents of children with developmental disabilities to access 
at home. An example would be a web-based pandemic mental 
health intervention offering different modules for participants 
to select those applicable to their current situation (Arnold 
et al. 2020). A similar mindfulness-based and ACT-based 
intervention could also be developed to help parents during 
this difficult pandemic period.

Specialized schools that cater to children with developmen-
tal disabilities can also engage experienced mindfulness and 
ACT trainers to organize such programs for these children’s 
parents. Conducting such programs for parents while their 
children attend school activities could encourage more par-
ents to participate in these programs. Moreover, healthcare 
providers, community workers and researchers can collaborate 
with religious leaders to modify current mindfulness-based 
and ACT-based programs to incorporate various religious 
teachings within these interventions. Future trials can develop 
interventions in which participants are grouped according to 
their religions for some segments and the respective religious 
leaders can be invited to deliver certain aspects of the interven-
tions. For instance, a monk was engaged by a psychiatrist to 
conduct Buddhist teachings as part of a hybrid ACT program, 
and the participants both enjoyed and benefitted from his 
teachings (Fung 2015). This may help to make mindfulness-
based practices more meaningful and relatable for parents of 
children with developmental disabilities, and allow them to 
integrate these practices in their daily lives more seamlessly, 
hence bringing about greater improvements to their mental 
well-being.

Furthermore, future trials should aim to recruit larger sam-
ple sizes and across more regions such as in Africa and South 
America to understand the mental well-being of parents with 
children who have development disability in other cultures. 
They should also aim to conduct follow-up assessments of at 
least six months to assess the long-term effects of these inter-
ventions as a previous study only reported marked improve-
ments in mindfulness at the six months’ time point (Gould 
et al. 2018). Due to the very low quality of almost all of the 
review outcomes, future research should examine outcomes of 
parental stress, anxiety, depression and mindfulness (interper-
sonal mindfulness in parenting and mindfulness awareness) to 
validate this review’s findings.

Conclusion

In this review, mindfulness-based and ACT-based interven-
tions were found to be effective in improving mental well-
being  in  terms  of  stress,  anxiety  and  depression  among 
parents of children with developmental disabilities at post-
intervention. However, these interventions were not effective 
in improving parental mindfulness post-intervention. The 
effectiveness of these interventions at their follow-up time-
points cannot be adequately determined due to insufficient 
data. The findings of this review suggest that mindfulness-
based and ACT-based interventions can be considered by 
healthcare professionals, community workers and authori-
ties from specialized schools for children with development 
disability to support parents of children with special needs. 
Future  trials  can  also  leverage  on  technology  to  deliver 
mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions to boost 
attendance rates and offer support to parents during the cur-
rent stressful pandemic situation. Moreover, religious lead-
ers can be engaged to incorporate various religious teachings 
into existing mindfulness-based and ACT-based interven-
tions to offer more meaningful mindfulness practices for 
participants. Considering the very low quality of evidence, 
as rated using the GRADE approach for almost all outcomes, 
future reviews are needed to corroborate current findings.
