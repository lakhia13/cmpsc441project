Abstract
Psychological models of bipolar disorder (BD), such as the self‐regulation model (SRM;

Leventhal, Nerenz, & Steele, 1984), highlight the crucial role of beliefs about mood in

relapse vulnerability. To date, no studies have directly compared these beliefs between

people with and without BD. Based on the SRM, the current research examined beliefs

about mood in people with and without BD and explored the impact of current affect

on these beliefs. Fifty euthymic people with a diagnosis of BD and 50 controls were

recruited through an online screening study, clinical services, and support organiza-

tions. Experience sampling methodology (ESM) was used to assess beliefs (according

to the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire; Broadbent, Petrie, Main, & Weinman,

2006) across a typical week of everyday life. Data were analysed using multilevel
modelling. Forty‐two people with a diagnosis of BD and 50 controls were included

in the analyses. Results indicated that the BD group reported less control over mood,

a shorter duration of mood, and less understanding of mood and were more likely to

report the cause of depressive symptoms as something internal, compared with con-

trols. When controlling for current affect, the BD group also reported more positive

consequences, made more internal attributions for hypomanic symptoms, and

reported less concern about mood, compared with controls. Findings suggest impor-

tant differences in beliefs about mood between people with and without BD that

are not the result of current affect. These beliefs may be particularly important in

understanding underlying vulnerability to future relapse into depression and/or mania.

internal/related to the self rather than external factors. For example,
“If I felt in high spirits and full of energy, I would probably think it
was because I am a talented person with lots to offer” (self‐disposi-

ably think it was because I am a bad person” (self‐dispositional

BD score significantly higher on the HIQ and IDQ compared with con-

BD (Jones & Day, 2008; Jones, Hare, & Evershed, 2005).

This study was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. The

study was approved by a UK local National Health Service (NHS)

ethics committee (REC ref: 10/H1015/76), and additionally indepen-

dently peer reviewed and adopted by the Mental Health Research

Network in England (MHRN ref: 59258). All participants provided

written informed consent.

2.1 | Sample

A convenience sample of 50 people with a diagnosis of BD and 50

controls were recruited through an online screening study advertised

using online adverts on internet forums and media sites, and poster

and newsletters circulated around universities across the North West

of England (Banks et al., 2016). Additional participants were recruited

directly through local clinical services and support organizations. BD I
or II was confirmed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV

(SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1997). Control participants

were required to score < 0.5 standard deviations above the sample

mean on the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS; Eckblad & Chapman,

in the context in which they occur (increasing ecological validity).
ESM is a well‐established approach for investigating processes in men-
tal health research. ESM has been employed to investigate cross‐
sectional (Myin‐Germeys, Delespaul, & van Os, 2003) and temporal

(Pavlickova et al., 2013) associations between variables in BD, as well

as biological markers (Havermans, Nicolson, Berkhof, & deVries, 2011)

and as a technique for intervention (Depp et al., 2010). However, ESM

has not yet been used to examine the types of beliefs measured by the
BIPQ, which has generally relied on cross sectional self‐report and

therefore does not address the dynamic nature of BD and neglects

contextually and temporally sensitive information such as changes in

current affect. By using multiple, frequent assessments of momentary
phenomena, ESM can provide an ecologically valid, real‐time method

for examining the inherently dynamic nature of BD that traditional

assessments fail to capture. As with the majority of ESM studies using

BD samples (e.g., Fulford, Johnson, Llabre, & Carver, 2010; Havermans

et al., 2011; Havermans, Nicolson, Berkhof, & deVries, 2010;

Havermans, Nicolson, & Devries, 2007; Knowles et al., 2007;
Myin‐Germeys et al., 2003; Pavlickova et al., 2013), we used momen-

tary paper diary assessments in real time triggered by a watch/mobile

phone signal. To ensure accurate completion of diaries, participants

recorded the time at which they completed each diary entry and were

instructed to complete the diary as soon as possible following an alert

(within no more than 10 min). Where a response was missed, partici-

pants were asked to provide a reason and to wait until the next alert

to respond. The number of diary items selected was consistent with
good practice in ESM research (Palmier‐Claus et al., 2011). See Section

Screening measures (see Figure 1)

The HPS (Eckblad & Chapman, 1986) was used to screen controls

(participants who scored < 0.5 standard deviations above the sample

mean on the HPS).

The SCID (First et al., 1997) was used to confirm that the clinical

sample met research diagnostic criteria for BD I or II to verify any
additional DSM‐IV Axis I psychological disorders and to screen control

participants. SCID interviews were administered over the telephone

by a trained researcher to allow participants across the North of

with good practice for ESM, participants were contacted by phone

during the study week to provide support, increase motivation, and
arrange a final appointment (Palmier‐Claus et al., 2011). During this

appointment, the researcher collected the study equipment, debriefed
the participant, and gave a £10 “thank you” for their involvement.
