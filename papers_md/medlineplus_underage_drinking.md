Alcohol is the most widely misused substance among America's youth. Drinking by young people has big health and safety risks. It is dangerous because it:

- Causes many deaths and injuries

- Can lead to poor decisions about engaging in risky behavior, such as drinking and driving or unprotected sex

- Increases the risk of physical and sexual assault

- Can lead to other problems, such as trouble in school

- May interfere with brain development

- Increases the risk of alcohol problems later in life

Kids often begin drinking to look "cool" or fit in with their peers. Parents can help their kids avoid alcohol problems. Open communication and conversations about drinking are important. So is being involved in your child's life. Get help for your child if you suspect a drinking problem.
