The transition of a pregnant woman’s role often causes emotional changes that have an
impact on marital satisfaction. We develop MIESRA mHealth and evaluate its impact on sat-
isfaction of husband-wife relationship during pregnancy. A quasi-experimental study was
conducted on 82 couples of pregnant women and divided into control, single, and paired
group. We implemented MIESRA mHealth for four weeks. In the couple group, the wife did
mindfulness based on the information in the MIESRA mHealth together with her husband. In
a single group, the wife sees the video as an initial guide to doing mindfulness. In the control
group, respondents received programme interventions from hospitals which included edu-
cation and consultation with obstetricians. Husband-wife relationship is evaluated using
Compatibility of Husband-and-Wife Relationships / Kesesuaian Hubungan Suami Istri
(KHSI) questionnaire and the generalised estimating equations (GEE) was used to analyse
the data. The women’s KHSI scores in the couple and single intervention groups (β = -7.46,
p = 0.002; β = -9.11, p = 0.001) were better than the control group. The husbands’ KHSI
scores in the paired and individual intervention groups (β = -7.04, p<0.001; β = -3.74, p =
0.024) were better than the control group. Nursing interventions to build emotional bonds
between parents and foetuses based on mHealth can be a promising intervention for marital
harmony during the perinatal period. MIESRA m-Health is a promising intervention on mari-
tal satisfaction during pregnancy and can be implemented as a part of the antenatal care
programme to increase marital satisfaction.

Introduction

Pregnancy is a transition period in which women strive with biochemical, physiological and
anatomical alterations [1]. Transition to motherhood is influenced by various factors across
different levels, including individual factors (partner support, career aspirations),

Marital satisfaction during pregnancy

organizational factors (family-friendly work practices, role models), and societal factors (social
norms, attitudes towards the maternal body) [2]. Some pregnant women adjust well to these
changes by maintaining optimal physical condition, positive interpersonal relationships, and
gaining support from their family and health workers [3–5]. However, the transition is some-
times beyond control and makes pregnant women vulnerable to physical, mental, and social
illnesses [6, 7]. Pregnant women mostly face psychological issues such as anxiety and depres-
sion during transition to motherhood [8, 9]. This condition can have an impact on miscar-
riage, or the baby is born with stunting and both mental and physical disabilities [10, 11].
Other conditions are such as abortion, premature delivery, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption,
and lack of concern for the foetus [12–15]. Not only does it have an impact on the growth and
development of the foetus, but also this condition has an impact on the condition of marital
satisfaction, which leads to miscommunication and disharmony [16, 17]. The previous study
mentioned a relationship between the foetus and the transition to parenthood during preg-
nancy [18, 19]. The exceptional relationships between pregnant women, their husbands, and
foetuses are placed at the core of the living environment that needs to be strengthened to main-
tain their wellness [20, 21].

The couple’s orientation to everyday life, as well as changes to daily life, joyfulness experi-

enced, and their subsequent adaptation to those changes, is reflected in their marital satis-
faction [22]. Couples who can talk and work out their differences on key marital issues to
the satisfaction of both partners have a harmonious marriage [23, 24]. During pregnancy,
marital satisfaction plays an important role in maternal psychology, foetal development,
and also the coverage of vaccination for baby well-being [25–28]. To reach this, husbands
should understand the emotional condition of pregnant women caused by hormonal fluctu-
ations [29]. Becoming a mother theory from Mercer [30] states that, at the stages of commit-
ment, attachment and preparation, it can increase the bond between mother and children as
well as environmental factors that also have an impact on husband- wife marital
satisfaction.

To increase the closeness of the relationship between parents and foetus as well as to

increase marital harmony, mindfulness interventions can be used as a reference. These inter-
ventions can reduce psychological distress and improve emotion regulation and empathy [31].
Previous study mentioned high correlation between mindfulness and marital satisfaction [32].
Other studies about mindfulness that that specific on childbirth and parenting have a positive
improvement in mother’s wellbeing and parents’ relationship [33, 34]. Mindful technique
helps both husband and wife to acknowledge any perceptions, problems, and recognise any
disadvantages and advantages in their marital life. This technique also helps to identify the pos-
itive perception and satisfying marital relationship by creating open-minded discussion to
solve any problems, including pregnancy condition [35, 36].

To date, research indicates that the utilisation of mobile health (m-health) in providing
nursing interventions for pregnant women is possible [37]. Technically, mindfulness inter-
vention that emphasises on maternal relationship is implemented manually and online [38–
40]. Thus, we developed mHealth-based mindfulness namely “Fostering the Emotional Bond
of Parents and Foetus/Menjalin Ikatan Emosional Orangtua dan Janin (MIESRA)” to facili-
tate pregnant women and husbands that can be implemented everywhere and anytime to
maintain the marital life during pregnancy for mothers’ and foetus wellbeing. MIESRA
mHealth provides many interventions to help the mother maintain the pregnancy and foetal
condition and marital satisfaction for both husband and wife. This mHealth can be used by
both husband and wife. Thus, we conducted this study with aim to assess the effect of
MIESRA as a mobile health-based nursing intervention to increase the satisfaction in a hus-
band-wife relationship.

Materials and methods
Study design

We utilised a quasi-experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of MIESRA mHealth to
the outcome variable [41, 42]. This study design is appropriate since the author did not per-
form randomisation. We faced limitation on study settings and subjects’ recruitment during
the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.

Setting and sample

The study is conducted in the government and private hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. These
hospitals were elected as a referral mother and children hospital in Indonesia. For homogene-
ity reasons, the data collection for all groups was implemented in both hospitals (Fig 1). We
performed the study from baseline to three months (May to July 2021).

A total of 93 couples (husband and wife) participated in this study. A purposive sampling
technique was used to recruit the participants. A total sample was estimated of 10% dropping
out from this study. We used G*Power (software used to calculate statistical power) version
3.1.9.6 with the assumption of p < 0.05, 0.9 of power estimation, and 0.8 of effect size [43, 44].
Furthermore, we divided into three groups, namely couple groups, single groups, and control
groups. Each group consisted of 31 couples. The inclusion criteria consisted of 1) pregnant
women with primigravida or multipara; 2) a minimum of secondary education level; 3)

gestational age between 20 and 34 weeks; 4) pregnant women aged 20–45 years; 5) husband
willing to participate; 6) couple has smartphone with Android-based system; 7) never diag-
nosed with or under medication for mental health problems. In addition, couples who drop
out during the study process will be excluded. At the end, 11 couples e dropped out (two cou-
ples resigned during the study process and nine mothers were delivered before the post-test
data were collected). Finally, a total of 82 couples was included (Fig 1).

Instruments

We used Compatibility of Husband-and-Wife Relationships / Kesesuaian Hubungan Suami
Istri (KHSI) questionnaire to observe marital satisfaction [45]. This questionnaire was used by
the author as a consideration with participants’ characteristics in Indonesia. This instrument
consists of 29 items that cover six components 1) closeness; 2) conformity; 3) understanding;
4) a reflection of affection; 5) satisfaction; and 6) a husband-wife togetherness. In favourable
statements, the score starts from 0 to 3 (items no. 1–14, 16,19, 20, 23–29). In the negative state-
ments, the score starts from 3 to 0 (items no. 15, 17, 18, 21, 22). A lower score indicated satis-
fied and high score indicated not satisfied. A mean cut-off point was used to interpret the
score of KHSI. The value of validity and the internal confidence consistency had a Cronbach’s
alpha of 0.86. A reliability test of KHSI was conducted on 116 pregnant women in urban areas
with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.89 [46].

MIESRA mHealth. MIESRA mHealth is an interactive learning media for pregnant

women and their husbands that can guide how to build emotional bonds between parents and
foetuses. This application is built using Android Studio version 4.1.2 which can be installed on
devices such as mobile phones with Android Operating System 4.0 or the latest. This applica-
tion consists of two types, namely applications for wives and applications for husbands and
can be downloaded from https://miesra-app.nfcworld.web.id/. Detailed information can be
seen in Table 1 & S1 Data. MIESRA mHealth has been tested through several steps. 1) At the
beginning, MIESRA was tested to five users to evaluate the menus and function in detail. 2)
The second steps, a limited test to five couples (pregnant women and husband), was used to
evaluate the applicability and effectivity of application to reach the purpose. 3) The next step is
the evaluation on efficacy, efficiency, and usability using Heuristic Evaluation (HE) approach
[47]. HE was performed by an expert in nursing informatics and working as an analyst in the
Digital Transformation Office at the Ministry of Health of Republic of Indonesia. Based on the
HE assessment, MIESRA mHealth received 0.6 value (1 is the highest value) which means that
MIESRA needed a minor revision and can be approved after revision. 5) In the last steps, a

trial test used System Usability Scale (SUS) [48] to 15 couples in the government hospitals.
Based on SUS test, MIESRA mHealth received 80.1 score, which means MIESRA is acceptable
and can be used with the excellence category. We obtained Intellectual Property Rights
approval from the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights (No. 000291880).

Study procedures

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed the study in two referral hospital in Jakarta,
Indonesia. We set the study procedure with the condition of COVID-19 by following the Indo-
nesia Government and hospital rules. We conducted the assessment from baseline to three
months. At the beginning, we explained all the information about the study purpose and pro-
cedure to the respective respondents and asked them manually to sign the informed consent.
Then, all the respondents in the couple and single groups were asked to download the MIESRA
mHealth to their own mobile phone. All participants in the three groups received the same
intervention in the form of prenatal care, education, and consultation from an obstetrician
(See Fig 2). Respondents were allowed to consult with researchers via telephone or chat.

The pre-test was conducted to find out initial information regarding marital satisfaction
through the MIESRA mHealth, except for the control group who used a special website pro-
vided by the researcher. Researchers could monitor all developments and information on the
MIESRA mHealth through a special account.

In the couple group, the wife did mindfulness based on the information in the MIESRA
mHealth together with her husband. This intervention was carried out based on the mindful-
ness guide available in the wife-MISRA mHealth. Husband and wife simultaneously viewed
the video as an initial guide to mindfulness. Then, they were asked to listen to mindfulness-
related audio from the wife-MIESRA mHealth and carry out the instructions with their hus-
bands. This intervention was two times a week for four weeks with 15 minutes of each session.
In addition, there is a Diary feature in the wife-MIESRA mHealth that helps the wife to write,
submit complaints, and progress during the pregnancy process. This feature can be viewed

and accessed by husbands (using the husband-MIESRA mHealth) with the aim to increase the
husband’s knowledge regarding their wife’s condition during the pregnancy. Researchers
monitor the activities carried out by couples through the application media and will remind
them through the media in the app or by telephone if they do not intervene. Then, post-test
was performed after four weeks of intervention.

In a single group, the wife sees the video as an initial guide to doing mindfulness. Then they

listen to mindfulness-related audio and do it according to the instructions. In this group, the
husband did not participate in mindfulness and only monitored his wife. This intervention
was two times a week for four weeks with 15 minutes of each session. Then, the wife filled out
a diary on the MIESRA mHealth feature to convey what she feels during pregnancy. In this
group, husbands received education through the husband-MIESRA mHealth and could
directly monitor the contents of the wife’s diary using the husband-MIESRA mHealth. Then
post-test was done after four weeks of intervention.

In the control group, respondents received programme interventions from hospitals which

included education and consultation with obstetricians. What makes this group different is
that they didn’t get the MIESRA mHealth facility. Couples were allowed to ask researchers
related to the research process via telephone or chat. Next, the post-test was conducted after
four weeks and respondents received the MIESRA mHealth facility and an explanation of how
to use it from the researcher.

Data analysis

IBM SPSS version 24 was used to conduct statistical analysis. The descriptive characteristics of
the respondents in all groups were represented using descriptive statistics such as numbers,
percentages, and homogeneity test. Thus, one-way ANOVA test was utilised to determine the
likelihood of homogeneity in all groups (homogeneity p = >0.05). Furthermore, we performed
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) of multivariate analysis to evaluate the effectiveness
of MIESRA mHealth. GEE is a development of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) which is
used to measure data that contain autocorrelation. The dependent variable can be in the form
of numeric or categorical data and can control covariate variables that are dynamic or chang-
ing, whereas the GLM can only measure the numerical dependent variable and the data are
static [49, 50]. In this study, the covariate contained a dynamic dependent variable because the
pre-test value was different from the characteristic value, which was static. During the statisti-
cal analysis, we performed and consulted to the statistical expert in Universitas Indonesia.

Ethical consideration

This research was ethically approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Nursing
Faculty, Universitas Indonesia (No. SK-243/UN2.F12.D1.2.1/ETIK. FIK. 2019) and the hospi-
tals’ ethical committee. All respondents were over 18 years old, their privacy protected, and
voluntarily authorised the written informed consent. The individual in this study has given
written informed consent to publish this case detail. The individuals pictured in S1 Data have
provided written informed consent (as outlined in the PLOS consent form) to publish their
images alongside the manuscript, and the animated images presented in the S1 Data were
drawn by the author.

Results

From the total 82 couples included in this study, we present the demographic data in women
and husband separately. We found that women are predominantly in the low risk aged from
20 to 35 years. Most of the women in the three groups completed college or university and

have planned pregnancies. An almost similar number of women works outside home as with
the homemaker ones. More women in the intervention groups live with their partners and
children only rather than with extended family, but these are different with the control group.
Overall, the characteristics among women in the groups shows homogeneity (p-value >.05),
unless for the parity. In the husband category, the majority are young adults (age 26 to 35
years), had university education level, work as a private employee, and earn above the Jakarta’s
regional minimum wage of IDR 4,200,000). Statistically, there are no differences in the charac-
teristics of the father among the groups (p-value >0.05). Thus, the three groups in this study
are homogenic (Table 2).

The homogeneity test of harmonious relationship score of the female and male groups
before the intervention reported that the three groups (single, paired, and control) showed
similar KHSI scores pre-intervention (p-value = 0.707 for women and p = 0.394 for men).
Therefore, the differences that occurred post-intervention were influenced by the adoption of
mindfulness exercises through MIESRA mHealth (Table 3).

It can be seen in Table 4 that there were two variables included in the women’s KHSI multi-
variate test (intervention variables and husband’s KHSI). Three variables were included in the
husband’s multivariate test (intervention variables, husband’s age, and women’s KHSI).

MIESRA mHealth towards women’s satisfaction score

Both the complete model and the final model of the variables that affect the women’s KHSI
score after the intervention were the provision of the intervention, time, and the husband’s
KHSI with a significance value lower than 0.001. The final model showed the women’s KHSI
score was 3.68 points better than before the intervention. The husband’s KHSI also affects the
mother’s KHSI condition. After the intervention, the mother’s KHSI score in the paired inter-
vention group was 7.46 points better than the control group. In the individual intervention
group, the mother’s KHSI condition was 9.11 points better than the control group after the
intervention (Table 5).

MIESRA mHealth towards husband’s satisfaction score

Both the complete model and the final model of the variables affecting the KHSI score after the
intervention are the provision of the intervention, time and the women’s KHSI with a value of
significantly less than 0.001. The final model showed that the husband’s KHSI score was 2.29
points better than before the intervention. The mother’s KHSI also affects the husband’s KHSI
condition. After the intervention, the husband’s KHSI score in the paired intervention group
was 7.04 points better than the control group. In the individual group, after the intervention,
the husband’s KHSI condition was 3.74 points better than the control group (Table 6).

Discussion

Marital satisfaction during pregnancy is needed as a husband’s support system. This has an
impact on the psychology of the mother and the development of the foetus. For this reason,
the MIESRA mHealth was created to help increase marital satisfaction among couples during
pregnancy by using a mindfulness approach. Pregnant women used the MIESRA mHealth to
establish emotional bonds between parents and foetuses with partners or individually.

In our study, we found that respondents in the paired and single group showed a better
result in KHSI score compared to control group. It means that the MIESRA mHealth has a
positive effect on marital satisfaction. As we mentioned that the MIESRA mHealth was devel-
oped based on mindfulness approach, the finding is supported by previous study using Mind-
fulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) programme that also increases the marital

partners as experienced during childbirth. Husband was fully present in helping from prepara-
tion for delivery to completion of labour by reminding and guiding the wife in practising
mindfulness activities. This is similar to previous study which mentioned that mindfulness
practice during pregnancy increased the interpersonal relationship and physical effect, such as
relaxation and comfort with the husband [51].

The success of mindfulness practice in increasing the marital relationship does not have to
be performed manually in the class. It can be assisted by mHealth as described in this current
study. A previous study mentioned online mindfulness as new methods to be more applicable
in an easy way [40]. Moreover, mindfulness practice resulted in quality marital satisfaction
and psychological wellbeing [38, 39, 52]. Mindfulness exercises carried out in the early stages
have shown significant results in improving the quality of husband-and-wife relationships
[53]. Mindfulness can effect to marital satisfaction through psychoeducation, daily registration
and assessment of daily negative experiences, and a short mindfulness practice (5–15 minutes
per day) [35, 38]. Those steps are important in mindfulness to increase the understanding
from both couple and lead to happy marital satisfaction and wellbeing in general.

The improvement in the father’s KHSI score in the paired intervention group is better than

in the single group. Our finding shows that mindfulness practice interventions carried out
jointly by married couples produce a better result than individual interventions. Therefore, we
suggested that pregnant women prioritise mindfulness exercises with their husbands to
achieve a maximum harmonious relationship. Previous studies mention that mindfulness per-
formed with couples leads to effective communication, understanding, and support of each
other [54, 55]. Another study also mentioned that it can increase attention, affection, and well-
being and improve quality of life [56]. Likewise, mindfulness exercises given to pregnant
women with their husbands significantly affect their ability to act consciously (acting with
awareness) and increase satisfaction and quality of relationships with partners [55]. During the
study, husbands were more intense in participating in the training as they directly obtained
information from health providers. Transparent information from these professionals makes
fathers understand the right way and feel a deeper relationship with their wives and children
and a closer relationship with the foetus [57].

Mindfulness for marital harmony has a very positive effect for mother, foetus, and husband.

The mother showed behavioural changes, which are more patient and calmer in interacting
and communicating with partners. The husband described that they were more concerned
and alert to providing support, assistance, and involvement in the process of pregnancy and
childbirth for their wives [51]. Meanwhile, the foetus also received a positive impact on growth
and development [58]. In the maternity nursing area, mindfulness exercises for men improv-
ing interactions between father, mother, and foetus can further enhance harmonious

relationships. Interactions are conducted by being alert to every moment of activity [57]. The
father’s ability to feel the presence of the foetus can significantly increase the closeness of the
emotional relationship between the father and the foetus [59], raise the man’s involvement in
carrying out his role as a father [60], and increase the harmonious relationship of the father
with a partner [61].

In a mindful state, the mind, emotions, and body sensations look at others with open and
non-judgemental thought [61]. The quality benefits increase relationship attention, making the
relationship healthier, reducing negative interaction, and increasing positive environment for
the pregnancy [62]. Mindfulness nursing interventions that are performed individually affect
partners to be more responsive because the principle of being fully present and non-judgemental
causes a good perception of partner behaviour [40, 63]. This condition was also experienced by
the husbands of the individual group in this current study. Even though these men did not get
mindfulness training like the husbands of the paired group, they still had an impact on improv-
ing the value of the harmony of the husband-and-wife relationship that the father obtained.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this study include (1) the intervention utilizing mHealth media, which allows
respondents to access it without limitations of time and place (2) MIESRA mHealth, an appli-
cation that provides crucial information during pregnancy, pre-test and posttest assessments
for knowledge, and daily activities comprising instructional videos on mindfulness, audio
materials, and diary notes, (3) MIESRA mHealth is easy to install, use, and comprehend, (4)
detailed research methods were employed, and (5) statistical tests conducted by experts to
ensure robust results. Additionally, the availability of this application can support the limited
number and time constraints of health workers in providing antenatal health services. It
enables monitoring of the psychological health of pregnant women and their partners, thereby
enhancing the emotional bond between the mother and the foetus.

However, this study had several limitations, including (1) the participants were limited to a

specific area. Therefore, conducting research in broader locations while considering beliefs
and culture becomes essential; (2) MIESRA mHealth still had certain limitations. Researchers
were unable to examine it in real-time to determine when participants engaged in mindfulness
interventions and learning activities such as reading educational materials or watching educa-
tional videos. This aspect needs improvement in future work; (3) The interventions in this
study were a single package; therefore, specific interventions were not conducted each week;
(4) The generalization of research results is limited to pregnant women and partners without
mental health disruptions. Further research is recommended for groups of patients diagnosed
with mental illnesses. Overall, these limitations highlight the areas for improvement and sug-
gest potential directions for future study.

Conclusion

Nursing interventions to build emotional bonds between parents and foetuses based on
mHealth can be a promising intervention for marital harmony during the perinatal period.
The husband’s active involvement in the mindfulness exercise programme with his wife and
interacting with the foetus yields psychological comfort and increases emotional bonds with
his wife and foetus. Hence, the MIESRA mHealth can be one of solutions and suggestions to
the Indonesia Government especially to increase the contribution of husbands in prenatal,
antenatal, and postnatal care. We recommend the MIESRA mHealth as a nursing intervention
that can implemented during pregnancy is integrated into the antenatal care programme to
increase the marital satisfaction, foetal growth, and wellbeing in general.
