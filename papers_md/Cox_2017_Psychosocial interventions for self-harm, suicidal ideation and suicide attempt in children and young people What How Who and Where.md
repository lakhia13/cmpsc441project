ABSTRACT
We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of indicated individual psychosocial interventions for the treatment of self-harm, suicidal ideation and
suicide attempts in children and young people, with a particular emphasis on the emerging use of electronic methods to deliver psychological
interventions. In total, 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identiﬁed, none of which included children under the age of 12 years.
Cognitive–behavioural therapy is the most commonly implemented approach in RCTs until now, although problem-solving therapy, interpersonal
psychotherapy, social support and distal support methods by provision of a green card and regular receipt of postcards have also been investigated.
Young people have been recruited into RCTs within schools, outpatient clinics, emergency departments and inpatient facilities. Face-to-face delivery
of therapy has dominated the intervention trials thus far; however, the use of the internet, social media and mobile devices to deliver interventions
to young people and other family members allows for a more novel approach to suicide prevention in youth going forward.

INTRODUCTION
Suicidal
ideation (SI), self-harm (SH), suicide attempt (SA) and suicide
are signiﬁcant public health concerns in young people.1 Suicide rates in
this population have been rising,2 and suicide is now one of the leading
causes of death in 15–29-year olds globally.3 In the age group 15–19
years, the suicide rate is estimated to be 7.4 per 100 000 people, with
rates in men being higher than in women (10.4 vs 4.1 per 100 000,
respectively)4. There are limited data on the incidence of suicide in
those under the age of 15 years;5 6 however, one study has estimated
the mean rate of suicide in those up to 14 years to be ∼0.6 per
100 000 people worldwide.7
SI, SH and SA are more common in young people than suicide.8 SI can
comprise thoughts of death or wishing to die and/or engaging in an
for SA and death by suicide.9 10
SA, and is a known risk factor
Epidemiological data from community samples in the USA indicate that,
in the past 12 months, 24% of young people between the ages of 12
and 17 years have experienced SI, and between 10 and 17% have
engaged in an SA.8 However,
in clinical
samples, with up to 85% of young people experiencing depressive
symptoms also reporting SI.11 Furthermore, 32% of clinically referred
children and young people will make an SA and by adulthood, between
2.5 and 7% will die as a result of suicide.11 12
There are a variety of different terms used when referring to SH,
with the terms ‘deliberate or intentional self-harm’ used widely in
Europe and Australia.13 14 However, the preﬁx deliberate is being
used less and less, as it can be seen as judgemental, and implies
that a person is aware and in control of their actions, which may
not always be the case.15 These terms are often used when deter-
mining if the presence or absence of suicidal
intent is problematic.
The term SA can also sometimes be used interchangeably when
describing acts of SH.16 Generally, such behaviour includes cutting,
scratching, hitting, burning the tissue on one’s own body and self-
poisoning. For the purpose of this article, SH refers to behaviour
where there is known SI, mixed motivations or SI cannot be deter-
mined. Community prevalence rates of SH in adolescents are esti-
mated to be between 5 and 10% over a 12-month period, and rise
to 16 to 22.8% over a lifetime.13 17 18 SH is a known risk factor for
SI and SA and death by suicide19 as well as being associated with
a number of other negative outcomes such as mental health issues,
poor educational and vocational outcomes and premature mortality
due to other causes.20 21 For the purpose of this review, SI, SH and
SA will collectively be referred to as suicide-related behaviours
(SRBs).

Interventions to prevent suicide can be classiﬁed using the Mrazek and
Haggerty categories of universal, selective and indicated interventions.22
Universal
interventions are delivered to the general public or to whole
populations, not selected on the basis of increased risk (in this case, of
suicide). Selective interventions are delivered to individuals or subgroups
of the population whose risk of suicide might be higher than in the
general population, but who do not yet show signs or symptoms (eg,
young people with depressive symptoms or substance abuse problems).
An indicated intervention is one that is targeted at people who have
signs and symptoms, in this case, a history of SRBs.

When might individual therapy be the best option?
Individual, group-based and family oriented interventions are all treat-
ment options for SRBs in young people.23 24 The family can be involved
as a target of intervention by educating them about the signs of suicide
in young people, involving them in planning for crises (eg, by reducing
access to means) and assisting them to access services and attend
appointments with their child.25 However, there are times when it is
not possible to engage the family in therapy. Factors such as ﬁnding a
time for therapy around work and school commitments, parents feeling
overwhelmed by their child’s symptoms, parents feeling blamed, judged
or not listened to by therapists are some of the barriers encountered
when engaging family in the therapeutic process.26
From a youth developmental perspective, young people often voice that
they want privacy and conﬁdentiality in therapy at a time when they are
developing their independence.27–32 Often, individual therapy is what is
sought by a young person and is what is appropriate given their age
and stage. Family involvement can still be part of what clinicians aim to
do in collaboration with the young person (eg, at the very least letting
the family know what is going on and ensuring that they are engaged
as a support). Nevertheless,
individual therapy may be the preferred
option for young people and it is important to know which therapeutic
approaches are effective for addressing SRBs as well as considering
how and where such services are delivered.
Our aim in this review is to identify evidence for the effectiveness of
individual psychosocial
interventions on SRBs in children and young
people up to the age of 25 years, with a particular focus on the type
and setting of the intervention, as well as the method of delivery.

Method
PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library were
searched from inception to January 2017 to locate English language
systematic reviews (SRs) or meta-analyses (MAs) conducted within the

35Evid Based Mental Health May 2017 Vol 20 No 2Clinical review Clinical reviewcontext of an SR. SRs containing published or ongoing randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) of individual psychosocial
interventions delivered to
children and/or young people up to the age of 25 years who had experi-
enced SH, SI or an SA were included. SRs had to include trials where
the primary or secondary outcome was an SRB or incidence of suicide.
For the purpose of this review, trials could be included regardless of
whether data were reported.
SRs that focused on the prevention of suicide in groups that had not
reported any episodes of SRBs (eg, universal and indicated interven-
tions) or
focused exclusively on non-suicidal self-injury were not
included. Similarly, SRs that included trials where participants were
recruited on the basis of a mental health diagnosis (eg, depression, bor-
derline personality disorder) where an SRB was not a criterion for inclu-
sion even if they measured an SRB were not included.
Trials where the primary therapeutic approach was family based,
focused speciﬁcally on targeting family dynamics, but contained some
individual sessions (eg, attachment-based family therapy) were not
included. Trials where the therapeutic approach contained more than
two family or group sessions were also excluded, as were trials where
the intervention was a single therapeutic session which focused on the
family. In the case of multiple publications on the same topic, the most
recent or comprehensive publications were included.
The search terms applied were: suicid* AND self-harm* AND (child*
OR young* OR adolescen* OR teen), along with meta* or review* in
trial type in applicable search engines.
The following characteristics of trials were extracted: location of recruit-
ment and location of intervention delivery, method of intervention deliv-
ery (eg, face-to-face, online), who delivered the intervention, type of
therapeutic approach and comparison condition (eg, treatment as usual
this information was extracted from the
(TAU)). Where possible,
included SRs; however, in cases where this information was not avail-
able, we extracted it directly from the original trial publication.

RESULTS
Four SRs met the criteria for this review.23 24 33 34 In many cases,
these SRs included the same trials, however, owing to differences in
the inclusion criteria, methods of analysis and the databases searched,
it was decided that all four SRs were worthy of inclusion and explor-
inter-
ation within this review. One of these SRs included psychosocial
ventions for youth suicide across a number of settings and included
RCTs targeting universal, selective and indicated populations;33 only
those delivered in indicated populations are discussed in this review.
Two SRs focused on young people who had presented to clinical ser-
vices as a result of SH17 or SRBs including passive SI,23 and another
SR focused on web-based and mobile psychosocial suicide interven-
tions for young people. Three of the reviews included trials with young
people aged between 12 and 25 years23 33 34 and one included trials
with participants up to the age of 18 years.24 See table 1 for the
characteristics of trials included in this review.
Sixteen individual trials from these four SRs are described within this
review. One trial by Shand et al (2013), which was included as an
unpublished trial
in the SR by Perry et al (2016), appeared relevant
during preparation of this review. However, this has now been pub-
lished35 and the mean age of participants is 26.25 with a range of
ages that extended up to 61, and is therefore excluded.

What?
The most common intervention approach tested in trials until now is
cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), which has been tested in four
trials36–39 and is currently being tested in a further trial.40 Various proto-
cols of CBT have been tested across these trials. Alavi et al (2013)
used a waitlist comparison and tested a protocol of CBT that was
designed to speciﬁcally address SRBs, based on the Stanley model.41

The main components of this include chain analysis (examines the cir-
cumstances, cognitions, emotions and behaviour leading up to and at
the SA), safety planning, psychoeducation, developing
the time of
reasons for
living and hope, as well as the more commonly used
approaches of behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring, mood
monitoring, emotion regulation and distress tolerance techniques,
problem solving, goal setting, mobilising social support and assertive-
ness skills. Parents were allowed to participate in the ﬁrst session and
‘standard psychiatric care’ with medication was used if needed, which
was provided to both groups. Slee et al 2008 also implemented a
protocol of CBT that speciﬁcally addressed SH, but they developed the
protocol themselves. It included chain analysis, cognitive restructuring,
emotion regulation and distress tolerance techniques and problem
solving in order
to address the mechanisms that maintained SH.
Parents were encouraged to be involved as supports. CBT was delivered
in the context of treatment as usual that included any of: psychother-
apy, pharmacotherapy, alcohol/drug treatment, partial hospitalisation and
community service and the comparison group received TAU alone. The
ongoing trial by Robinson et al (2014) implements CBT which contains
components speciﬁcally focused on SI.
While the explicit focus on SH was less clearly articulated in the publi-
cation of the LifeSPAN therapy conducted by Power et al (2003), it is
described as including a collaborative risk assessment and formulation
with a focus on a functional analysis of the suicidality.
It included
problem-solving training, psychoeducation for psychosis, emotional pain
tolerance, stress management, self-esteem, help seeking and social
skills training. Parents were not explicitly mentioned in the description
of the intervention. Young people were also receiving TAU at a specialist
early intervention clinic for ﬁrst episode psychosis; and the comparison
group in this trial received TAU alone.
The CBT protocol tested in the trial by Donaldson was called ‘skills-
based treatment’, which they describe as cognitive restructuring and
behavioural strategies such as relaxation for affect management. It also
included elements of problem-solving therapy (PST). Parents had brief
information and there was
contact with therapists to provide collateral
one adjunct family session. This CBT protocol was compared with a
supportive therapy.
Two trials have investigated a PST approach.42 43 Both trials followed
the standard approach of D’Zurilla and Goldfried (1971) and D’Zurilla
and Nezu (1999) which includes highly structured stages of problem
solving.44 45 Speciﬁc skills are taught including: problem identiﬁcation,
goal setting, generating alternative solutions, decision-making (choosing
a solution), solution implementation, assessment and veriﬁcation (did
the solution achieve goals?). However, it is worth noting that Fitzpatrick
et al (2005) delivered the PST in one session via a 35-min video and
the comparison group received a video about healthy lifestyles. In the
trial by Eskin et al 2008, the PST was compared with a waitlist control
condition. One further trial described their intervention as interpersonal
PST (IPST).46 The IPST incorporated the stages of problem solving as
described by D’Zurilla and Goldfried (1971) and it was compared with a
brief problem-oriented approach. There was no family involvement in
any of the PST approaches tested in these three trials.
Two trials have assessed the effectiveness of social support with TAU
(which could include any of: psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, alcohol/
drug treatment and partial hospitalisation) compared with TAU
alone.47 48 As well as receiving TAU, the intervention group had weekly
supportive contact
(discussing daily activities and concerns, encour-
aging activities in support of treatment goals) with someone they nomi-
nated as a support person. This nominated support person received
1.5 hours of psychoeducation about the young person’s psychiatric dis-
orders and treatment plan,
risk factors for suicidal behaviour and
warning signs for imminent risk, as well as strategies for communicat-
in 2009, there were slight

adaptations to this intervention whereby only adults could be nominated
as support people, and the interventions were for 6 months rather than
3 months. It should be noted that in the 2006 trial, in 61.5% of cases,
the nominated support person was a parent. In the remainder of cases,
the support person was a non-parent adult relative, a non-adult relative,
unrelated peer, family friend or neighbour, teacher, school counsellor or
administrator.

One trial53 assessed the effectiveness of a distal support method,
whereby adolescents who had been admitted to hospital
for an
episode of SH were given a token (hereafter called a green card),
which they could use to be readmitted into hospital. The aim of the
green card was to provide young people with ‘an alternative way to
escape from their environment and get help’ ( pg. 570). There was no
family involvement. The intervention and the comparison group
received TAU that consisted of the standard follow-up after discharge
from hospital and treatment
from their clinic or child psychiatry
department.
Another trial54 used postcards, which were sent to participants on a
monthly basis, and contained individual sources of help (identiﬁed in an
initial ‘sources of help interview’ where young people were asked what
they found useful
in times of crisis, eg, listening to music, talking to a
friend, etc), as well as evidence-based self-help strategies. The post-
cards also asked about the young person’s well-being. There was no
family involvement. The comparison group received the sources of help
interview, and both groups received whatever support they were receiv-
ing in the community.

Two trials have used green cards53 or postcards54 to deliver their inter-

In terms of the recruitment for trials, and ongoing location of the inter-

who had been admitted to the emergency department
inpatient mental health facility,36 47 48 53 both,37 and outpatient mental
health clinics.38 39 54 Universities that contain research-based outpatient
clinics have also been the location of recruitment.42 43
Of those recruited within an inpatient or ED facility, two of the interven-
tions were delivered in the community following discharge47 48 and
another focused on improving access to services in the future.53 In the
trials by Alavi and McLeavey, the treatment setting is not explicitly
stated; however, they appear to be delivered in an outpatient setting.
Trials that recruited within an outpatient setting (hospital based or uni-
versity based) delivered treatment on an outpatient basis.
A limited number of trials have recruited within a school setting, and
subsequently delivered interventions at school.40 49–52

Who?
Interventions varied in terms of whom they were delivered by, often as
a function of the setting. In school settings, nurses, school counsellors
and social workers were all cited as delivering interventions to young
people,49–51 as well as lay support people.47 48 In the ongoing study by

What has been effective?
Trials that used a CBT that speciﬁcally targeted SH have shown promis-
ing results.
in 2008, there were
reductions in the number of SH episodes at 9-months follow-up and a
signiﬁcant reduction in the severity of SI at all time points compared
with the TAU group. In the trial conducted by Alavi et al in 2013, there
were signiﬁcant differences in SI between participants receiving CBT
focused on suicidality and those in the waitlist group. In the trials con-
ducted by Power et al (2003) and Donaldson et al (2005), there were
no differences in outcomes.
There were three trials of PST. In two of these,42 43 there were signiﬁ-
cant impacts of the intervention in the non-clinical samples experien-
cing SI, though not across all outcomes. In the trial conducted by Eskin
et al (2008), there were differences in SI post intervention compared
with a waitlist control group. Likewise,
in the trial conducted by

styles. In the trial conducted by McLeavey, there were no differences in

In the trials conducted by King et al (2006, 2009), there were no sig-
niﬁcant differences in SI or in the percentage of participants who made
an SA in the follow-up period between the group that received support
and TAU and the group that received TAU alone. In the earlier trial, the
authors did note some positive effects in girls, and in the later trial
they commented that there was a more rapid reduction in SI for those
with a history of multiple SAs.
Of the three trials of school-based C-Care trials, there was only one sig-
niﬁcant ﬁnding with differences shown between groups in SI.51 There

reported signiﬁcant reductions in SI compared with those who received

The provision of an emergency green card53 did not result in signiﬁcant
differences in repetition of SA, and similarly, the receipt of postcards54

DISCUSSION
This clinical review identiﬁed 16 RCTs from four SRs that have investi-
gated the effectiveness of
interventions for
SRBs.23 24 33 34 Generally, the sample sizes of the trials were small
and thus lacked power. There were a variety of differences in where
young people were recruited from, what intervention was delivered and
by whom across the studies. The outcome measures that were used
differed across the trials, as well as the follow-up assessment points,
making it challenging to draw conclusions across trials. This echoes the
conclusions of the SRs included in this review. Despite the incidence of
suicide in children under the age of 12,6 no trials located targeted chil-
dren in the younger age range. As has been noted in the wider litera-
ture on suicide prevention, generating evidence in this area has been
including
hampered by a number of ethical and practical concerns,
small sample sizes, underpowered trials due to the overall
low rate of
suicide, as well as the varying deﬁnitions of SRBs used in studies to
select participants.55 56

What?
The 16 trials described within this review have implemented CBT, PST,
IPT, social support and distal support methods by provision of a green
card and regular receipt of postcards. At present, the most commonly
therapeutic approach identiﬁed in the RCTs
investigated individual
was CBT. This mirrors other areas of mental health such as in
depression.57 58
The SR by Robinson et al (2011) concluded that CBT appears to have
promise in reducing SRBs in young people who present speciﬁcally to
clinical services. However, the SR by Hawton et al (2015) found no evi-
dence of effect of CBT on repetition of SH. The conclusions in both
these SRs were based on single trials. A further trial adds some weight
to the potential efﬁcacy of CBT in clinical populations, particularly CBT
that speciﬁcally targets SRBs. This is consistent with a recent review
that showed that interventions that speciﬁcally target these behaviours,
rather than the symptoms associated with this behaviour like depres-
sion, hopelessness and quality of life, were more effective at reducing
these behaviours.59 Further, given the effectiveness of CBT in the treat-
ment of disorders that are associated with SRBs, such as depres-
sion,60 61 it may be prudent to continue to explore this avenue. Also of
note is that Hawton et al suggested that dialectical behaviour therapy
(DBT) and mentalisation-based treatment (MBT) were worthy of further
investigation. Within this review, there were no trials that implemented
these therapeutic approaches in a purely individual format (both have
been trialled in a group format, or had a degree of family involvement).
There is also evidence suggesting that DBT and MBT are effective in
reducing SI in adults.62 As such, there may be scope to modify these
interventions for individual delivery with suicidal youth.

38 Evid Based Mental Health May 2017 Vol 20 No 2Clinical reviewAlthough the SR conducted by Calear et al did not report on the type
of psychotherapy that was most effective, they did analyse interven-
tions delivered to individuals, versus those delivered to families and
groups. They concluded that interventions delivered to individuals alone
were effective in reducing SI, whereas group and family programmes
had effects on SAs only. They also report that interventions that include
an individual and family component appear to affect SI and SA. Our
review sought to include trials delivered to individuals alone, without a
family focus or more than two sessions involving a family member.
Some CBT trials and the one IPT trial
included minimal family involve-
ment and, where this was the case, it tended to be a single session at
information
the beginning of the intervention, in order to gain collateral
and/or to provide psychoeducation and engage parents as supports.47 48
Of note was the social support intervention where young people often
chose their parent as the nominated support person, which, while not
effective in terms of
including
parents as a support may often be acceptable to young people.
Clinicians need to balance the autonomy of the young person and their
family involvement, with the potential beneﬁts and
preference for
ethical issues inherent in managing suicide risk when delivering individ-
ual therapy.
The comparison conditions implemented in trials generally included
TAU, or another active intervention, given the ethical concerns in with-
holding treatment from those at risk of suicide.56 TAU was often a high
level of quality clinical care, for example,
in the trial by Power et al,
where the intervention was given in the context of high-quality standard
clinical care of young people with psychosis by experienced clinicians.
Such comparison groups, although ethically important, may limit the
degree to which differences can be found between groups.

reductions in SRBs, highlights that

How, who and where?
Young people have been recruited into trials within schools, outpatient
clinics, EDs and inpatient facilities. Generally, the intervention was deliv-
ered in the same place as where young people were recruited (with
the exception of EDs). Further, the overwhelming majority of the trials
used face-to-face methods to deliver interventions. These were deliv-
ered by a variety of professionals,
from clinicians experienced in
working with those engaging with SH in clinical settings, to school
counsellors and laypeople in school and community settings. None of
the SRs located within this review explored whether these aspects of
where people are recruited from, how the intervention is delivered, and
who by moderated treatment outcome, most likely due to the lack of
RCTs in this area.
Of note are the relatively few examples of the use of technology to
interventions targeting suicidal young people,40 despite the
deliver
sharp rise in the use of technology to deliver mental health services
across the lifespan.63 As Perry et al (2016) noted in their SR, other
areas of suicide prevention, such as screening young people for risk of
suicide, are beginning to use web-based platforms to deliver services.64
The use of ‘real time’ monitoring and intervention provided via handheld
devices to support young people ‘in the moment’ has been ﬂagged as
important for overcoming difﬁculties mental health services have with
responding to ﬂuctuating SI and episodes of SH and SA.65 Despite
the trial by Tighe and colleagues not being eligible for inclusion in
this review, the Ibobbly intervention is worthy of further exploration in
an adolescent and youth population (under 25 years) given its
accessibility.35
The use of social media has also been highlighted as having the poten-
tial to support young people with SRBs.66 A recent publication by Rice
et al (2016) describes the implementation of a handful of online and
social media interventions for young people at risk of suicide, as well
as how such interventions may act to ‘bolster social connectedness’.67
interventions, or contact
Accessing support, whether in the form of

inbetween sessions may be beneﬁcial for young people
with others,
experiencing SRBs.
It would be interesting to explore which of the
most effective interventions or elements of interventions for reducing
SI, SA and SH could be implemented as interventions delivered via
handheld devices like smartphones. For example, DBT commonly
involves teaching distress tolerance, an element of
intervention that
may be incorporated into a mobile app. A particular feature of the work
done in this area is a focus on participatory design, including engage-
ment of young people as codesigners, in order to ensure that the views
and preferences of these end users are taken into account in the
design. This is crucial to ensure the acceptability of the intervention,
which in turn is likely to enhance uptake and engagement.68
Online platforms may also provide an opportunity for family intervention,
without having to compromise a young person’s preference for individ-
ual therapy. For example, a web-based support component for parents
could be delivered alongside individual therapy for the young person, to
provide them with basic psychoeducation around suicide in youth,
including strategies to enable them to better support their child. In the
area of psychosis, online family support interventions are beginning to
be developed.69
There have been obvious concerns about use of technology-based inter-
ventions in terms of who and how to deal with risk. Any intervention
delivered to young people experiencing SRBs in the online environment
must be able to respond to risk. This can be done, provided there is
appropriate moderation of the site, through thorough safety protocols.67

CONCLUSIONS
Many of the trials identiﬁed within this review failed to ﬁnd signiﬁcant
differences in SI, SA and SH outcomes between groups, and as we
have not sought to conduct an MA, it makes it challenging to recom-
mend any speciﬁc therapeutic approach over another. Research is
urgently needed in this area, and given the potential effectiveness of
CBT, DBT and MBT in treating SI and SH in other population groups,
these are avenues worthy of further exploration. Although face-to-face
delivery of therapy has dominated the intervention trials thus far, the
use of the internet, social media and mobile devices in young people
allows for
innovative and novel approaches to suicide prevention in
youth. Designing interventions with young people, which can be deliv-
ered in real time to young people, may be useful, as well as using elec-
tronic devices to support parents as an adjunct to individual therapy
with young people.
