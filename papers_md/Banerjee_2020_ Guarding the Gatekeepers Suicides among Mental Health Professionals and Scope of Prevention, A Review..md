Suicide  is  a  social  evil  that  is  considered  to  be  a  global  epidemic.  Mental  healthcare  professionals  (MHP) 
(psychiatrists,  clinical  psychologists,  psychiatric  social  work,  etc.)  are  often  involved  as  ‘gatekeepers’  in  the 
management of  suicidality and suicide prevention.  Even though the risk of suicide in medical  profession has 
received attention in research, there has been scarcity of literature related to the same in MHPs. They are not 
immune to the perils of psychological distress and its cascading consequences including suicide, contrary to the 
popular societal myths. The intrinsic and extrinsic pressures of the profession, persistent discourse in managing 
the psychological distress of others, professional burnout, self-stigma, societal apathy and easy access to psy-
chotropics are certain factors making the MHPs more vulnerable. This disengagement and stress can contribute 
to depression, anxiety and complex trauma in the MHPs. The situation is furthermore compounded in developing 
countries  with  resource  constraints,  low  MHP:  patient  ratio  and  inflexibility  of  work  schedules.  This  makes 
tailored  interventions,  peer  counselling,  periodic  mental  health  screenings  and  administrative  understanding 
and accountability necessary at all levels. Keeping this in background, the review glances at the risk factors of 
suicide related to MHPs, highlights the problem statement and discusses the possible interventions.   

1.  Introduction: The Problem Statement 

The  new  Indian  Mental  Health  Care  Act  (MHCA)  of  2017 
(Vadlamani and Gowda, 2019) has decriminalized suicide but the rip-
ples  of  a  suicidal  death  or  attempt  continue  to  disrupt  the  life  of  the 
individual  in  particular  and  a  mental  health  professional  (MHP)  at 
large. The recent suspected suicide of a celebrity (Sushant Singh Rajput) 
(“Sushant Singh Rajput dies by suicide at 34 in Mumbai,” 2020) and of 
three medical professionals at one of the premier institutes of India, (All 
India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi) including one MHP in a 
span of two months (“Another AIIMS doctor commits suicide — third in 
the past month | Cities News,The Indian Express,” n.d.), may have more 
in  common  than  meets  the  eye  at  first  glance.  Both  come  from  a 
background of adequate awareness, accessibility, affordability and ac-
ceptability with demanding and constantly scrutinized professions that 
may  conjure  a  toxic  amalgam  of  self-harm  that  remains  bereft  of  an 
antidote (Ventriglio et al., 2020). This underground pandemic of MHP's 
suicide  is  an  interplay  of  the  epidemiological  triad  of  host  vulner-
abilities  and  environmental  stressors  catalysed  by  the  agent  of  mala-
daptive  coping.  The  old  saying,  “Physician,  heal  thyself.”  may  find  an 
equally  redundant  corollary  in  “Psychiatrist,  mind  thy  psyche.”  which 
may  provide  poetic  injustice  to  the  profession  and  the  mental  well- 

being of the MHPs (Rosen, 1973). The suicide rate among the medical 
fraternity is said to be between 5-7 times the general population with 
psychiatrists on the unfavourable end of the spectrum across specialities 
(Dutheil  et  al.,  2019a). The  higher  prevalence of  depression,  anxiety, 
substance  use  and  self-medication  in  doctors  including  MHPs  further 
fractures  the  mental  health  system  and  thus,  necessitates  a  special 
discussion  about  their  suicidal  risk  and  prevention  (Bhugra  et  al., 
2019). Keeping this in the background, this review highlights the vul-
nerabilities of MHPs for suicide and possible preventive strategies. 

2.  Suicide in medical professionals: Factors and risks involved 

It  is  a  known  fact,  that  under  years  of  pressure  a  piece  of  coal 
transforms  into  a  sparkling  diamond.  However,  as  the  stress-perfor-
mance curve's bell shape tells us that undue stress negatively impacts 
performance which  manifests  exponentially in high  precision and  de-
manding  profession  such  that  of  medical  personnel.  The  ubiquitous 
need  for  perfection  impales  the  scope  of  mistake  and  this  adrenergic 
overdrive  may  just  be  one  of  the  etiological  factors  predisposing  an 
individual to mental illnesses. As has been noted, the rates of depression 
and anxiety in doctors are not only higher than the general population 
but also more than other professionals (Gerada, 2018).

Even though their resilience maybe reinforced by the financial se-
curity,  social  status  and  gratification,  both  immediate  and  delayed,  a 
medical professional is, at the end of the day, not immune to medical 
ailments  which  include  mental  health  issues.  Intrinsic  vulnerabilities 
which may from a distant perspective appear helpful as a professional 
can invariably turn counterproductive. The nurture-nature debate holds 
its ground in the conceptualization of Knudson's two-hit hypothesis in 
the current context (Knudson and Jr., 1971). The first hit in terms of 
genetic predisposition, adverse childhood experiences and experiences 
of loss are similar to anyone else (Gerada, 2018). The second hit is made 
more liable due to the nurturing of nature of an individual with traits 
like  perfectionism,  obsessiveness,  driven,  competitive,  individualistic, 
ambitious and elements of martyrdom which are a Pandora's box, that 
when contained and regulated do no harm unless stress unveils a ple-
thora of problems (Ventriglio et al., 2020). 

After  induction  into  the  profession,  the  biosphere  is  comprised  of 
personal, structural and endemic factors (Ventriglio et al., 2020). Per-
sonal factors entail pre-existing psychiatric illnesses, the disparity be-
tween demand and capacity with inadequate support that may predis-
pose  an  individual  to  trauma,  stress  and  eventual  decompensation 
(Gerada,  2018).  The  perceived  lack  of  control  may  steer  one  into  a 
psychological Bermuda's triangle of guilt, low self -esteem and sense of 
failure.  The  structural  factors  or  the  milieu  in  which  medical  profes-
sionals are supposed to function is a dynamic one. The constant flux of 
managerial  issues  and  extensive  documentation  further  increases  the 
woes arising from the disparity between demand and supply resulting 
in hurried patient consultations. There is a dearth of space and time for 
unwinding  and  reinvigorating  oneself  resulting  in  exhaustion  and 
burnout. 

an 

the  psychological  homeostasis  of 

The  paradox  of  maintaining  professional  boundaries  at  the  same 
time  being  an  empathetic  professional,  especially  at  the  time  of  loss, 
grief  and  bereavement  are  crucial  endemic  factors  that  repeatedly 
challenge 
individual 
(Murphy  et  al.,  2019).  A  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  con-
ducted by Dutheil et al. (2019) included 61 studies related to suicides, 
suicidal  ideations  and  suicidal  attempts  among  medical-related  pro-
fessionals. The overall standardised mortality rate (SMR) was reported 
to be 1.44 with the U.S. physicians being at a higher risk than rest of the 
world.  This  can  also  be  due  to  the  fact  that  suicides,  especially  in 
physicians, is grossly under-reported from the developing countries and 
thus limited in existing literature (Bhugra et al., 2019). Suicidal idea-
tion was strongly linked to attempts and help seeking prior to the act. 
The relative risk of suicide in females was noted to be higher than their 
male counterparts across age groups. The hypothesis being that females 
juggle  multiple  responsibilities  of  their  household  and  workplace 
especially in conventional societies. Also, interestingly the risk of sui-
cide shows attenuation as one graduate to senior posts leaving the ju-
nior trainees the most vulnerable (Dutheil et al., 2019). The academic 
pressure,  balancing  work  and  life  may  be  overwhelming  for  freshly 
recruited, many are able to adapt and adjust but some may be unable to 
cope.  Certain  specialities  like  anaesthesiologist,  psychiatrist,  general 
physician and general surgeon (Ventriglio et al., 2020) have been ob-
served to be at a higher risk due to easier access to lethal drugs, long 
working  hours,  lack  of  autonomy  and/or  dealing  with  stressful  trau-
matic experiences (client suicide, intra-operative death, etc.). 

and lack of awareness thereof. The perception of mental illnesses being 
a  sign  of  weakness  in  character  and  somehow  avoidable  limits  help- 
seeking (Mortali and Moutier, 2018). Self-stigmatization only increases 
the perceived stigma and results in the internalization of negative views 
of others by self. In addition to this, the absence of a formal streamlined 
redressal  channel  the  issues  of  confidentiality  and  disclosure  become 
important as much of a doctor's practice maybe based on his reputation 
and  fortitude  (Ventriglio  et  al.,  2020).  The  gruelling  scrutiny  by  reg-
ulatory bodies and judgments regarding the doctor's capacity to prac-
tice in the presence of mental illness only dissipates the desire to discuss 
the same. This may lead to the “second victim” syndrome arising from 
blame and consequent isolation may inflict emotional trauma and dis-
ruption of the circadian rhythm (Ventriglio et al., 2020). 

“Tell me, do you bleed?” – Batman vs Superman, 2016. 
Sometimes the answer to the seemingly insinuating rhetoric maybe 
an  affirming  yes  lest  the  doctor  proves  his  immortality  and  freedom 
from suffering. The final phenotype of psychological suffering may lie 
on a spectrum of varying severity. Ranging from few symptoms to di-
agnosable psychiatric illnesses and suicide, at the opposite end. If dis-
traught the doctor may do a “disappearing act” wherein he may take 
French leave and not answer calls, be late to work, when present may 
tardy or take frequent leaves on account of “physical” sickness. A pic-
ture  of  depersonalization  and  “presenteeism”  wherein  physical  pre-
sence may be devoid of mental alertness is also observed. A more active 
manifestation  may  be  “Clinical  rage”  with  rage,  low  threshold  for 
frustration and distress tolerance (Ventriglio et al., 2020). 

With increasing rates of burnout, disengagement and exhaustion in 
physicians, the  incidence  of  depression,  anxiety,  post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) are on the rise. A recent survey showed suicide was the 
second most common cause of death in residents training over 14 years 
(Yaghmour  et  al.,  2017).  In  an  Australian  survey,  approximately  a 
quarter of doctors reported having had thoughts of suicide before the 
past 12 months (24.8%), and 10.4% reported having had thoughts of 
suicide in the previous 12 months. An important predictor of suicidality 
is suicidal ideations (Shanafelt et al., 2009). In 2008, a survey done in 
surgeons showed levels of suicidal thoughts were between 1.5 and 3.0 
times  more  common  among  surgeons  than  the  general  population 
(Shanafelt et al., 2009). Importantly, only 26.0% of the surgeons with 
suicidal  thoughts  had  sought  help,  whereas  60.1%  were  reluctant  to 
seek help because of concern that it could affect their medical license. 
Thus,  not  only  is  there  a  need  to  discuss  about  suicide  in  medical 
professionals  but  also  paramedical  staff  (like  nurses,  etc.)  which  may 
facilitate  a  systemic  change  in  our  approach  and  treatment  of  this 
vulnerable population as it suffers in silence (Davidson et al., 2020). 

3.  Suicidal risk in Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) 

Mental  health  professionals  include  psychiatrists,  psychiatric 
nurses,  clinical  psychologists  and  psychiatric  social  workers.  To  the 
surprise of a few, practicing in mental health does not provide passive 
immunity to mental afflictions. The most common methods of suicide 
have  been  noted  to  be  self-poisoning  and  hanging  which  is  alarming 
due  to  easy  access  to  regulated  and  lethal  drugs  (Ventriglio  et  al., 
2020). 

The longitudinal observation of important checkpoints may provide 

“Don't do unto others what you don't want others to do unto you.” 

a holistic perspective. 

– Confucius 

Medical  professionals  refrain  from  discussing  their  mental  health. 
Even  though a  recent online survey  shows  80% respondents  were re-
porting  burnout,  with  the  majority  having  a  diagnosable  psychiatric 
illness cross-sectionally or in the past 1 year, mainly depressive disorder 
and substance use disorder; around 20% were against seeking any sort 
of assistance or help (Bhugra et al., 2019). The major barriers in help- 
seeking  arise  from  the  stigma  against  mental  illness,  “  The  Scarlett 
Letter” (Hawthorne, n.d.) of being infidel towards one's profession on 
account of a “minor mood disturbance” is deeply ingrained in ignorance 

As  has  been  mentioned  before,  psychiatry  is  one  of  the  branches 
which has persistently shown higher rates of suicide compared to other 
specialities. What factors result in this notorious distinction?  

• The intriguing question is if working in mental health predisposes an 
individual  to  risk-factors  for  suicide  or  does  mental  health-related 
professions attract more psychologically ‘vulnerable’ physicians?  
• There  is  no  definite  answer  to  this  question.  However,  one  of  the 
propositions might be that some physicians who choose the realm of 
mental health  might  do  so due  to  their own  unconscious conflicts 

2

which  may  need  resolution  if  albeit  capriciously  (Rosen,  1973;  
Gerada, 2018). This of course is a not a generic statement but just 
might be one of the possibilities. 

• The  intrinsic  nature  of  the  psychiatric  illness  may  deprive  profes-
sionals of immediate gratification. The chronic nature of many ill-
nesses  may  not  have  a  favourable  prognosis  and  a  sense  of  in-
capacity and helplessness may loom over the treating MHP. Unlike a 
benign  neoplasm  or  refractory  error  which  may  be  remedied  by 
quick interventions with immediate results.  

• The  subjective  nature  of  interpretation  of  symptoms  may  lead  to 
varied explanations for the same in the absence of concrete objective 
assessment which may give a sense of ineptitude and lack of clinical 
acumen  thereof,  especially  in  young  trainees.  Assessment  of  ‘self- 
perceived’  distress,  anxiety  and  stress  are  often  assessed  by  MHPs 
based  on  the  yardstick  of  ‘diagnostic  categorization’  which  delays 
help-seeking.  Impaired  mental  wellbeing  and  quality  of  life  are 
mistakenly  equated  with  ‘psychiatric  disorders’  and  the  perceived 
distress is intellectualized rather than a healthy assumption of the 
‘sick  role’  that  can  promote  access  to  care  and  peer  support 
(Murphy et al., 2019).  

• The steep learning curve which includes honing not just knowledge 
but  fostering  good  communication  skills,  empathy,  discretion  and 
maintains boundaries maybe a tedious and convoluted path.  
• The self-medication hypothesis holds its ground firmly in the case of 
MHPs. In a survey of psychiatrists (Balon, 2007) it was found that 
around  43%  responders  would  consider  self-medication  if  de-
pressed. This is an outcome of a constellation of factors –  
a  The symptoms of psychiatric illness (depression, etc.) like shame, 
guilt, negative perceptions about self, etc. may result in fatigue – 
physical  and  cognitive  and  limit  the  ability  to  ask  for  help 
(“Depressed Psychiatrists and Self-Prescribing | Psychiatry & Be-
havioral Health Learning Network,” n.d.).  

b  The  simplification  of  symptoms  and  use  of  medical  jargon  may 
lead  to  self-diagnosis  which  hinders  one  to  seek  further  help 
(“Depressed Psychiatrists and Self-Prescribing | Psychiatry & Be-
havioral Health Learning Network,” n.d.).  

c  The  easy  accessibility  to  psychotropics,  including  psychoactive 
substances  by  means  of  a  medical  representative  or  self-pre-
scription is another slippery slope.  

d  Substances of abuse like alcohol, etc. as a quick remedy to one's 
distress  is  common  nevertheless  act  as  gateways  to  further  re-
calcitrant deterioration.  

• The  profile  of  patients  and  their  illnesses  predisposes  MHPs  to 
highly  litigious  vulnerability  thus  requiring  extensive  documenta-
tion and medico-legal issues (Murphy et al., 2019).  

• Stigma exists at three levels – self, societal and professional level. 
An  MHP  may  be  subjected  to  stigma  based  on  the  branch  of  spe-
cialization due to prevailing misconceptions and lack of communal 
awareness,  which  may  be  perpetuated  by  internalization  of  these 
negative  stereotypes.  The  lack  of  knowledge  may  lead  to  dis-
crimination  by  a  fellow  medical  professional  and  lack  of  societal 
reinforcements which can lead to the development of shame, guilt 
and self-doubt (Dutheil et al., 2019). Social attribution theories and 
cognitive psychology explain how ‘internalizing social stereotypes’ 
can  inherently  affect  the  beliefs,  self-perceptions,  self-esteem  and 
practice in any profession that eventually reflect on the self-care and 
help seeking (Corrigan, 2000). The same can be applied to MHPs as 
well  considering  the  widely  prevalent  ‘stereotypes’  about  mental 
health  and  mental  healthcare  providers.  ‘The  Health  Stigma  Dis-
crimination (HSD) model’ by Stangl et al. (2019) posits that inter-
nalized  stigma  might  lead  to  ‘self-othering’  and  social  segregation 
which  further  perpetuates  discrimination  among  those  affected. 
Such self-stigma can affect MHPs especially when they witness the 
widely  prevalent  myths  and  misconceptions  about  mental  health, 
thus  ‘mirroring’  the  social  stigma  in  the  process.  Lack  of  self- 
awareness, fear of social reactions and prejudice can act as ‘drivers’ 

whereas  occupational  inequality,  increased  workload  and  social 
apathy  can act as  ‘facilitators’ for “stigma marking” (Stangl  et  al., 
2019). This can enable a wide range of discriminatory behaviours, 
which worsens social relationships, creates social exclusion and re-
duces social acceptance (Parker and Aggleton, 2003). Like any other 
vulnerable group, MHP may also suffer from perceived stigma, as-
sociated  stigma  and  internalized  stigma,  which  may  be  connected 
with  the  general  ‘othering’  associated  with  ‘mental  health’  and 
‘psychiatric practice’ in many nations. Such traditional stigma even 
though  dealt  with  by  the  MHPs  in  their  daily  practice,  can  also 
victimize them quite often (Murphy et al., 2019; Stangl et al., 2019)  
• The  arduous  process  of  therapeutic  interventions  including  long 
term  therapy  especially  with  clients  of  personality  disorders,  sub-
stance  use  or  chronic  relapsing  severe  mental  illness  may  be  a 
stressor. This can result in burnout, exhaustion and lack of time to 
relax.  This  can  trigger  personal  conflicts  in  the  therapist's  life, 
especially problems with attachment, behavioural control and self- 
concept.  

• Complex trauma may be an important and recurrent component in 
lives of many MHPs. It arises from chronic stress and repeated ex-
posure  to  patient's  trauma  which  can  be  self-reflected  in  inter-
personal  context.  Briere  and  Scott  (2015)  has  defined  ‘traumatic 
event’  as  an  event  that  arouses  a  person's  past  stressors  causing 
impaired  coping  and  resilience.  Sartor  (2016)  mentioned  the  con-
cept of ‘vicarious trauma’ that can occur with continued work and 
efforts with traumatized clients. Such trauma was shown to reduce 
self-efficacy and social connectedness. Vicarious trauma has been a 
well-researched  concept  in  the  field  of  mental  health  especially 
among  combat  veteran  therapists,  military  psychology  and  child 
psychologists (Jordan et al., 2010). Peer supervision, mental health 
consultations,  social support,  self-care  and  leisure  are proposed  to 
act as resilience factors and stress buffers to mitigate this personal 
and  professional  trauma.  Working  in  certain  sensitive  areas  like 
gender-based violence and childhood sexual abuse can trigger self- 
traumatization,  similar  experiences  of  the  past  and  childhood  at-
tachment  patterns,  which  can  further  lead  to  maladaptive  coping, 
stress, sleep disturbances and depression: all of which can be the risk 
factors for suicides (Coleman et al., 2018). 

Vicarious  trauma  is  an  important  risk  factor  for  MHPs,  that  can 
drive  and  facilitate  chronic  stress  leading  to  impaired  psychological 
wellbeing and quality of life, which along with self-stigma and reduced 
help-seeking can possibly increase the risk of suicides (Figure 1).  

• Clinical  psychologists  are  especially  vulnerable  as  they  engage  in 
emotionally draining and often distressing prolonged psychotherapy 
sessions (Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, etc.). The laying down of 
one's emotional guard for better acceptance and acknowledgment of 
the clients distress makes them at risk of being adversely affected by 
such  content.  The  transient  failure  of  the  therapeutic  intervention 
may devoid the therapist of the larger picture on the road to client 
recovery  and  a  novice  therapist  may  integrate  this  momentary 
mistake  into  an  adverse  cognitive  schema  about  self  which  may 
snowball  into  larger  negative  perceptions.  In  the  lack  of  proper 
training, lack of expert supervision and paucity of peer group sup-
port  clinical  psychologists  are  left  in  the  dark.  The  legal  implica-
tions, as history provides an insight (Tarasoff I and Tarasoff II), can 
be  extremely  daunting  and  tricky  adding  on  to  the  woes  of  the 
therapist.  

• The psychiatric social workers often do the most tedious tasks in the 
absence  of  immediate  gratification  and  reinforcement.  The  com-
munity work may expose them to many perils of being mentally ill 
and bring them in contact with authorities that may be distant and 
aloof.  

• The important interjection of suicide in clients and the consequent 
effect  on  mental  health  professionals  needs  detailed  discussion.

MHP: Mental Healthcare Professional. 

Approximately  40%  of  individuals  who  die  by  suicide  have  had 
some  previous  contact  with  mental  health  services  with  70%  of 
these individuals having contact with mental health services in the 
12  months  before  their  death  (Kielty  et  al.,  2015;  Sherba  et  al., 
2019). The suicide of a client can lead to personal and professional 

distress, resulting in changes in professional practice (Murphy et al., 
2019). 

• Personal  distress  –  Feelings  of  guilt,  sadness,  shock,  anger  and  ir-
ritability  are  not  uncommon  especially  if  the  client  is  young  or 
mother of young children. Greater levels of distress are felt if a close

relationship  is  established  and  the  MHP  has  been  involved  in  the 
therapy process for long.  

• Professional distress – Sometimes client suicide may be unexpected 
and may come as a shock leading to adverse professional sequelae 
like reduced self-confidence, self-doubt and reluctance to work with 
clients expressing suicidal ideations subsequently.  

• Changes  in  professional  practice  –  Positive  changes  in  practicing 
include  heightened  alertness  with  more  frequent  formal  and  in-
formal  risk  assessments  with  greater  supporting  skills.  Better  doc-
umentation in view of “blame culture’ and “fear of litigation” may 
promulgate vicarious resilience. 

medical fraternity. Studies from India has shown that people prefer to 
visit a general physician, faith healer or someone close to them, rather 
than  visiting  a  MHP  when  they  feel  sad  or  anxious  (Kishore  et  al., 
2011).  Venkatesh  et  al.  (2015)  reported  high  perceived  stigma  in 
Southern  India  both  towards  people  with  mental  illness  as  well  as 
MHPs.  All  these  factors  can impair  work  satisfaction,  social inclusion 
and resilience in the MHP community, adding to the pre-existing vul-
nerabilities of some. The lack of proper review boards, grievance and 
redressal  committees  and  fear  of  loss  of  professional  opportunities 
further worsen the shadow pandemic of the acute and chronic mental 
health gap. This elucidates the dire need for more studies and policy- 
level changes for vouchsafing the interests of the MHPs in India. 

MHPs  may  thus,  along  with  family  members  and  loved  ones  be 
“suicide  survivors”  and  must  cope  with  grief  and  disbelief  that  can 
predilect to mental illnesses. 

5.  The Possible Strategies 

4.  Developing countries: an Indian perspective 

The  fabric  of  India  is  embellished  with  religion,  culture  and  its 
socio-ethnic  diversity.  These  result  in  manifestations  of  psychological 
distress  in  varied  ways  and  often  as  proxy  measures  to  seek  help  for 
mental health issues. The collectivistic society and lack of a psycholo-
gical  model of  illness  predispose  individuals, including  mental health 
professionals,  to  adapt  more  physical  models  of  illnesses.  “Culture 
idioms  of  distress”  are  a  common  entity  used  as  a  substitute  for  psy-
chological  stress  by  masquerading  it  as  physical  symptoms  like  ab-
dominal  discomfort,  multiple  bodily  pain  symptoms  which  are  vague 
and non-specific, etc. Thus, somatoform symptoms are oft-seen under 
various other specialities before being shunted to psychiatric assistance. 
The larger societal acceptance and acknowledgment of physical symp-
toms,  lack  of  linguistic  competency  and  stigma  may  defer  required 
treatment and divert from the actual cause of distress, predisposing to 
adverse outcomes like suicide. 

In the dearth of literature on suicide in mental health professionals 
the  recent NMHS  survey  provides important  insights (Murthy,  2017). 
With  an  estimated  prevalence  of any  mental  morbidity of  13.7%  and 
current  mental  morbidity  of  10.6%  (Gautham  et  al.,  2020)  approxi-
mately  130  million  people  require  mental  health  services.  At-risk 
MHPs, form the neglected fraction of dual service providers and con-
sumers or ‘prosumers’. The treatment gap as reported by the National 
Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-16 is around 70-92% for various 
mental illnesses. According to the mhGAP, WHO the treatment gap for 
mental  disorders  is  estimated  to  be  more  than  75%  (“WHO  | 
WHO  Mental  Health  Gap  Action  Programme  (mhGAP),”  2020).  This 
highlights  the  absolute  and  alarming  need  for  MHPs  to  take  care  of 
mental health needs. However, the abysmal manpower of the median 
number of psychiatrists in India of 0.2 per 100,000, psychiatric social 
workers in India of 0.03 per 100,000, clinical psychologists in India of 
0.03  per  100,000  and  nurses  in  mental  health  in  India  of  0.05  per 
100,000  is  far  below  the  global  median  (“WHO  |Mental  Health  Atlas 
2005,” 2014) . This not only is an indicator of a lack of MHPs but an 
indirect indicator of the work burden and need to work overtime to take 
care  of  the  mentally  ailing  due  to  acute  staff  shortage.  MHPs  end  up 
working more than their capacity resulting in exhaustion, burnout and 
neglect  of  self-care  predisposing  to  mental  illnesses  and  suicide  in-
variably. 

Especially in India, ‘psychiatry’ or any other related mental health 
profession has been traditionally stigmatized. Referred to as “paagolon 
ka doctor” in Hindi (doctor of the lunatics), visiting or even personally 
connecting  with  a  psychiatrist  is  not  considered  in  ‘good  light’. 
Widespread misinformation, biased portrayal by the popular media and 
rumour-mongering  further  worsen  the  ‘images’  of  MHP  in  the  com-
munity (Kishore et al., 2011). Added to the fact, psychiatry has tradi-
tionally  wrestled  to  prove  its  ‘biological’  foothold  in  the  scientific 
community,  which  has  been  misinterpreted  by  many  as  a  ‘pseu-
doscience’.  This  often  leads  to  ‘ambiguous’  position  of  MHPs  in  the

To  prevent a  completed  suicide  may  be like  finding a  needle  in  a 
haystack, if not impossible extremely difficult. As per a recent study, the 
majority of patients who may be deemed to be at high risk of suicide 
may not attempt it, while half of all suicides occur in people seemed to 
be at low risk (Large et al., 2017). The generalizing of MHPs being at a 
higher risk of suicide based on preliminary data may be a reductionist 
approach.  As  statistically,  we  know  correlation  does  not  amount  to 
causation. To get a better understanding instead of extrapolating data, 
one  needs  to  back  trace  the  commonalities  amongst  the  MHPs  who 
attempt or complete suicide (Rosen, 1973). The fact that suicide esti-
mates  are  grossly  under-reported,  with  many  suicides  being  mas-
queraded as accidental deaths.  The undoing  of the same would be to 
perform a psychological autopsy on suspected suicide cases of MHPs to 
elucidate  the  predisposing  and  precipitating  factors  resulting  in  the 
unfortunate outcome (Rosen, 1973). 
“Depression: Let's Talk”, WHO 
The above statement holds the beacon of change at the gates of the 
gatekeepers.  Primordial  and  primary  prevention  is  better  than  cure. 
This  includes  changes  at  the  systemic  level  which  facilitate  early  de-
tection and interventions. A conducive work environment that nurtures 
learning  as  well  as  self-reflection,  personal  growth,  self-care  and  au-
tonomy opens vistas to positive mental health (Ventriglio et al., 2020). 
Assisting  junior  doctors  to  manage  workload  demands  and  patient 
contact  will  have  beneficial  effects  on  their  work  enthusiasm  and 
mental  health.  The  establishment  of  a  redressal  committee  or  a  grie-
vance/welfare committee that is approachable and functional may act 
as a buffer to emotional turmoil (Mortali and Moutier, 2018). Talking to 
colleagues  and  superiors  allows  ventilation  and  introspection,  the 
therapeutic  effect  of  knowing  people  understand  and  validate  your 
emotions is the premise on which many therapy schools are based on. 
Health Education England in a recent report (2019) suggested a number 
of measures which include the appointment of wellbeing guardians in 
each  hospital,  better  occupational  health  access  with  a  focus  on  the 
spiritual  and  psychological  wellbeing  of  medical  staff  (NHS  Staff  and 
Learners’ Mental Wellbeing Commission, 2019). This can be reinforced by 
individual counselling and wellness workshops which create awareness 
at the same time ease the trepidations in communication on such vo-
latile topics. Earlier recognition can be ingrained in MHPs by making it 
an integral part of their training and education, to be kind to your own 
and  recognize  early  signs  of  distress  in  an  MHPs which  may  have  an 
altered manifestation due to their profession. Peer support may bolster 
individual  psychological  resilience  which  manifests  as  multistage  en-
hanced functioning – clinical, educational and managerial. 

Gatekeeper  training  is  already  a  popular  model  in  suicide  pre-
vention. The term “gatekeeper” refers to “individuals in a community  
who  have  face-to-face  contact  with  large  numbers  of  community 
members as part of their usual routine.” They can be trained to “identify 
persons  at  risk  of  suicide  and  refer  them  to  treatment  or  supporting 
services  as  appropriate”  (U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services Office of the Surgeon General and National Action Alliance for 
Suicide  Prevention,  2012).  It  has  been  consistently  stressed  in  the 

D. Banerjee, et al.   

Psychiatry Research 294 (2020) 113501

literature that any individual irrespective of the socio-economic class, 
background or professional expertise can act as a “gatekeeper” against 
suicide if he/she is able to identify the ‘warning signs’. This approach 
has  been  evidence-based  in  schools,  medical  settings,  primary  care, 
emergency staff and communities (Wyman et al., 2008). Details of the 
‘gatekeeper  model’ 
covered  by  
Burnette  et al.  (2015),  and  is beyond the  scope  of this review.  MHPs 
being  well-versed  in  this  ‘train  the  trainers’  approach  can  also  act  as 
“gatekeepers” for their peers within the communities with appropriate 
awareness and empathy. 

suicide  prevention

is 

The  fear  of  disclosure  resulting  in  the  withdrawal  of  license  and 
professional loss is not unfounded. The authorities need to be sensitive 
to  this  information,  avoid  naming,  blaming  and  shaming  whilst  pro-
viding a safe space to discuss and guide. 
Thus, changes need to occur at an -  

• Individual level – recognition of exhaustion, burnout and stress in 
self  and  others,  reducing  in  the  self-stigma  of  suffering  from  a 
mental  illness,  communicating  suicidal  wishes  with  someone  and 
acknowledging  the  severity  of  such  fleeting  thoughts,  taking  time 
for  self-rejuvenation,  not  equating  academic  proficiency  to  happi-
ness and respecting one's limitations.  

• Organizational level – Public policy reforms, with the regulation of 
working  hours,  adequate  redressal  committees,  fostering  a  caring 
and empathetic work environment, recognizing the science behind 
suicide.  

• Societal level – Improvement in knowledge, attitude and practice 
with  regards  to  the  work  of  MHPs  which  might  help  in  social  in-
clusion and reduction of stigma. Media has a significant role to play 
usual.  The  portrayal  of  MHPs,  understanding  of  their  work,  re-
porting  mental health  issues  and  suicides, as  well  as  sharing  their 
lived  experiences  will  encourage  societal  support,  empathy  and 
collectivism. Media reporting of suicide can have significant impact 
on  public  reaction  and  attitudes,  and  MHPs  cannot  be  considered 
immune to the same (Cheng et al., 2007). WHO has laid down clear 
guidelines for media reporting of suicides that can be adhered to for 
sensitive depiction of events, reduce stigma and negativism, as well 
as  foster  awareness  related  to  mental  health  (World  Health 
Organization,  2017).  In  most  cases  however,  there  is  failure  to 
comply  with  these  guidelines  in  terms  of  failure  to  mention  the 
supporting  sources,  excessive  detailing  of  the  ‘act’  rather  than the 
background and prevention and unnecessary speculation related to 
the trigger (Utterson et al., 2017). The relationship between media 
sources and MHPs can get strained over discussion related to ‘high 
profile’  suicides  and  repeated  such  discourses  and  interviews  will 
affect their mental wellbeing. Healthy and collaborative discussions 
with  media over suicides improves  information-education-commu-
nication (IEC) gap and reduces stress on MHPs.  

• Administrative  level:  Facilitating  research  into  the  suicide  risk  of 
MHPs,  legislations  and  relevant  policy-making;  encouraging  help- 
seeking  and  reduction  of  medico-legal  complications  in  case  of  a 
suicidal attempt. 

Considering  the  ongoing  Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19) 
pandemic, it will be unfair not to mention the increased psychological 
burden  on  the  healthcare  workers,  which 
include  the  MHPs 
(Spoorthy et al., 2020). Further, considering the psychosocial toll of the 
outbreak,  the  workload  and  burnout  in  MHPs  may  also  increase. 
Though,  reports  of  increased  suicide  in  the  general  population  have 
been reported recently, systematic research especially in suicidal risk of 
healthcare  professionals  is  lacking  (Gunnell  et  al.,  2020).  Rapid  dis-
semination  of  data  and  adequate  surveillance  of  national  mortality, 
surveys and scientific literature will help researchers and policy makers 
estimate the impact of the pandemic on the mental health professionals. 
The International COVID-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration 
(ICSPRC)  is  working  with  the  International  Association  for  Suicide 

Prevention  (IASP)  and  WHO  to  formulate  a  strategic  and  evidence- 
based protocol for suicide prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020). It is imperative that the “voices” of 
MHPs are also included in the decisions and strategy making processes. 

6.  Conclusion 

Prevention of  suicide  and  management  of  suicidality  are  common 
attributes  for  mental  health  professionals.  Like  any  other  profession, 
mental healthcare workers too are not immune to the mental distress 
themselves. This review highlights the risk factors for MHPs related to 
suicide and proposes certain strategies to mitigate them. While many of 
these  might  be  similar  to  the  existing  suicide-prevention  methods, 
certain  areas  like  societal  and  self-stigma,  improving  self-awareness 
among  MHPs,  peer  support,  healthy  involvement  with  media  and  fi-
nally  ‘vicarious  trauma’  are  tailored  towards  the  need  of  those  who 
work in the field of mental healthcare. This includes both medical and 
non-medical professionals. The authors would like to stress on the fact 
that though many of these measures are propositions that are not yet 
evidence-based, they are grounded in clinical experience  and can po-
tentially  serve  as  framework  for  further  empirical  research.  Work-re-
lated factors, distress modelling, burnout and occupational frustration, 
as well as therapeutic nihilism with regard to chronic psychiatric dis-
orders, are the most-studied factors increasing the suicide risk of MHPs 
(Sherba  et  al.,  2019).  Though  the  risk  of  suicides  in  medical  profes-
sionals is well researched in literature, MHPs occupy a very limited part 
in  this  discourse.  This  applies  more  to  the  low  and  middle-income 
countries,  where  infrastructural  deficits,  resource  limitations  and  ad-
ministrative fallacies further compound the picture. The persistent in-
volvement and dealings with the ‘psychological problems of others’ can 
lead to chronic stress and complex trauma that reflect on self-identity, 
self-esteem and occupational performance. Regular peer debriefing and 
mental health screenings have been proposed for physicians serving at 
high-risk situations (Ventriglio et al., 2020). The same model needs to 
be  applied  for  MHPs  with  identification  of  the  vulnerable  groups, 
especially at the student-level. Like any form of suicide prevention, this 
too is a collective responsibility which needs systematic research into 
the suicidal risk and prevalence among MHPs, regular data audit in case 
of physician suicides, both of which can shape policy and legislation. 
Lived experiences of those MHPs who have faced suicidal ideations or 
have  undergone  significant  stress  might  help  understand  the  psycho-
logical  crisis  and  resilience  factors.  MHPs  are  often  involved  in  com-
munity  awareness  programs  and  gatekeeper  training,  however,  per-
sonal  implementation  of  ‘learnt  strategies’  often  stays  as  a  challenge. 
Understanding  of  this  risk  at  all  hierarchical  levels,  targeted  mental- 
health interventions for those at-risk, encouraging peer discussion and 
psychotherapeutic help among MHPs and decreasing self-stigma related 
to  mental  health  are  the  ways  forward  for  gating  the  lives  of  the 
‘gatekeepers’.
