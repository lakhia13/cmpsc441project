Abstract 

Introduction

Psychosocial interventions can be effective in improving health outcomes and quality 

of life of persons with infertility problems. This systematic review aims to document 

available psychosocial interventions for infertility-related problems in Low- and 

 Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and to assess their effectiveness for marital inti-

macy, sexual satisfaction, and quality of life (QoL) in people with infertility problems.

Methods

Studies will be considered eligible if they are randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 

quasi-experimental studies, and Observational studies (cohort, case-control, 

cross-sectional studies) involving women and couples with infertility problems and 

living in a LMIC who received a psychosocial intervention to improve marital inti-

macy, sexual satisfaction, and QoL. We will search PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, 
LILACS, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO (EBSCO) from inception to 31st March 2025, 
without language restriction, using all the relevant search terms and their synonyms, 

singular and plural forms and British and American spellings, together with the indi-

vidual countries according to the Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research

(ScHARR) 2022 classification of LMICs. We will also search conference proceed-

ings, preprint repositories, dissertation databases, the World Health Organisation, 

and government databases for additional studies. We will contact trial registries and 

experts for unpublished trials and hand-search reference lists of retrieved papers for 

studies missed by our searches. The retrieved studies will be exported to Rayyan for 

de-duplication and study selection using a pre-tested study selection flowchart devel-

oped from the study eligibility criteria. At least two reviewers will independently select 

studies, extract data with pretested data extraction sheet, and assess the quality of 

the included studies using validated tools. Dichotomous data will be assessed and 

reported as odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR), and for continuous outcomes, mean 

difference (MD) will be used; all will be reported with their 95% confidence interval 

(CI). Heterogeneity will be assessed graphically by inspecting overlapping CIs and 
quantitatively using the I2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to test the 
robustness of the pooled estimates if the data permit, and the overall quality of the 

evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach.

Expected outcomes

This systematic review and meta-analysis will identify effective psychological inter-

ventions and elaborate on the specific components to optimize and improve the 

psychosocial well-being of persons with infertility experiencing problems with sex-

ual satisfaction and intimate relationships. The review will also uncover previously 

misclassified effective interventions due to limited data and small sample sizes from 

underpowered primary studies. Highlighting the existing evidence on available psy-

chosocial interventions will inform clinical application, public education, and counsel-

ling services to optimize QoL of infertile couples and, importantly, inform the design of 

further studies to interrogate the region-specific application of these interventions.

Dissemination and protocol registration

The findings of this study will be disseminated through stakeholder forums, confer-
ences, and peer-reviewed publications. The review protocol has been registered in 
the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)- CRD 

CRD42023480729.

Introduction

Infertility remains a public health challenge due to its negative impact on reproductive 
─ sexual satisfaction [1,2] and marital intimacy [3,4]; cognitive ─ anxiety [4,5], depres-
sion [6,7], and psychological distress [8]; social functioning, i.e., social relationships 
[9–11], and overall QoL [12,13]. Half of the women with infertility in LMICs experi-
ence lifetime abuse that culminates in anxiety and depressive episodes [6,14,15]. 
Psychosocial interventions may offer positive coping mechanisms and resilience to

ameliorate the prevailing psychological distress among infertile couples [16–18]. Psychosocial interventions are mainly 
accessible to women seeking Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) [16,19–21] and not all individuals with infertility 
problems [22]. Globally, over 50 million cases are indicated for ART. Yet, only a small fraction in LMICs receive this treat-
ment, particularly in SSA, due to limited access and high treatment costs [23–25]. Given the paucity of data, it is unclear, 
and therefore largely unknown, which factors are the main drivers of ART uptake.

As a social construct, the discussion of infertility is of paramount importance in LMIC communities, as it is closely 
linked to procreation and lineage [22,26]. Hence, the inability to fulfill expectations of procreation as couples infringe on 
their social and psychological well-being. Worryingly, a number of infertile women and couples are not accorded the due 
respect and recognition in society [22,26]. They are denied many privileges in the family and are seen as worthless and 
useless [27,28]. These prevailing stressors reduce their psychological resilience, which in turn affects their social relation-
ships [9], marital intimacy [3], and sexual functions [29].

Infertility treatment is disproportionately underutilized in LMICs [30,31] due to the high cost of treatment and the limited 

financial resources of those affected. The lack of access indirectly causes significant emotional distress [32,33]. System-
atic reviews have shown that individuals with infertility problems in LMICs are less likely to have access to any form of 
ART [31,34], even routine medical care, including psychosocial interventions [35]. While psychosocial interventions are 
conceptualized in high-income countries and incorporated in the health systems, LMICs are yet to incorporate them in the 
management of infertility [31].

How psychosocial interventions might work?

Psychosocial interventions do not address the underlying biological cause of infertility, but can improve healthy emotions, 
attitudes, and habits that ultimately enhance the QoL of couples and/or partners with infertility problems [10]. The mech-
anisms through which psychosocial interventions operate is not well understood but they target the cognitive, emotional, 
and relational processes, leading to desired changes in individuals’ mental health and functional outcomes [36]. The 
interventions grouped according to mode of delivery and inherent psychometric properties, such as counselling, psycho-
dynamic therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), humanistic therapy 
education, behavioural change techniques, yoga, and others, are widely recognized as effective for various psychosocial 
problems [37–40].

For example, counselling allows couples to process feelings of depression, anxiety and grief whilst being provided with 
access to emotional support from health professionals and experienced peers. Together, this creates a safe environment 
that allows individuals to express their concerns about problems they are going through, in this case infertility-related 
psychosocial problems [39]. In psychodynamic therapy, the focus is on uncovering unconscious thoughts and feelings, 
facilitating insight into emotional struggles through techniques like free association and dream analysis [40]. This process 
is complemented by the exploration of transference, where clients project past relational dynamics onto the therapist, 
allowing them to better understand their emotional responses [41]. Cognitive-behavioural therapy emphasizes cognitive 
restructuring, which involves identifying irrational thoughts and negative ideations and instead allows substitution with 
positive reinforcement coping strategies to meet conceived expectations [42]. It also incoporates behavioural activation, 
which encourages engagement in positive activities and thoughts that enhance emotional regulation and coping skills [43]. 
Adopting mechanisms such as cognitive restructuring in CBT that focuses on challenging cognitive distortions and foster-
ing more adaptive thought patterns have been proved to be very effective [43]. Mindfulness-based stress reduction incor-
porates mindfulness meditation and yoga that helps individuals to manage daily stress and emotional pain, and builds 
resilence [44]. By fostering greater awareness and acceptance of one’s emotional state, MBSR can enhance coping skills 
for individuals facing infertility challenges [45].

Humanistic therapy education, however, prioritizes the therapeutic alliance by building a trusting relationship that fos-
ters self-exploration, empowerment, and personal growth [46], whereas behavioural change techniques, such as exposure

therapy and skill acquisition, help clients confront their fears and develop coping strategies [47]. Other interventions such 
as yoga aims to encourage the individual to focus on the present condition, and by so doing, it helps to alleviate anxi-
ety [48]. This may help modulate infertile couples expectations following treatment and consequently alleviate the self- 
generated ideation of hopelessness [49]. Couples therapy focuses on addressing relationship issues, helping partners to 
navigate the emotional challenges of infertility together [50] and in assessing therapy sessions together tends to enhance 
couples ability to effectively communicate, resolve conflicts, and importantly develop shared coping strategies to improve 
emotional resilience and interpersonal relationships [50].

Central to the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions is the therapeutic alliance, characterized by trust, empathy, 
and open communication, which significantly enhance clients’ engagement and motivation [51]. Emotional processing fur-
ther plays a crucial role, enabling clients to identify, express, and understand their emotions, ultimately promoting healing 
[52]. Additionally, self-awareness and insight gained through reflective exploration allow clients to integrate new-found 
understandings into their daily lives, facilitating lasting personal growth and improved mental health outcomes [53]. Under-
standing these mechanisms equips therapists to tailor their approaches to the needs of the client to enhance the effective-
ness of the psychosocial intervention. Given the mechanisms through which psychosocial interventions work—such as 
improving communication, building trust, fostering amicable resolution of indifferences, and enhancing emotional bonds, 
these can improve marital intimacy, sexual satisfaction, and QoL of couples or individuals with infertility.

Rationale for this systematic review

Couples or persons with infertility problems are predisposed to societal stigma that negatively affects their psychological 
wellbeing. The decline in psychological resilience from infertility-related stress and events affects the social relationships, 
marital and sexual functions of individuals living with infertility [29]. Accumulated evidence, though fragmented, suggests 
an urgent need to manage infertility beyond medical care [54]. Adoption of psychosocial interventions may remediate psy-
chological stress associated with the diagnosis, and management, of infertility [16,55–61].

Addressing infertility is an integral part of sexual and reproductive health and rights [62]. However, in many countries, 
policies and services on infertility are inadequate. Tackling infertility and its negative psychosocial impact is essential for 
the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 [63], which aims to ensure healthy lives and well-being for 
everyone at all ages, and SDG 5, which seeks to attain gender equality and empower all women and girls. Furthermore, 
providing psychosocial interventions for infertility is fundamental for realizing the human rights related to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health and the ability to make decisions [64]. This is likely to enhance their 
self-esteem, and, likely to improve their participation in leadership roles, and potentially improve their decision-making 
about infertility [65]. Some primary studies have investigated the role of psychosocial interventions on marital intimacy 
and sexual satisfaction, but the results are fragmented and inconclusive [66,67]. Therefore, there is a need for a system-
atic review to collate existing studies and obtain a pooled estimate of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for 
persons with infertility problems.

To ensure this systematic review is not duplicating existing reviews, searches were conducted in relevant databases, 
and three existing systematic reviews that investigated psychosocial interventions among infertile couples were retrieved 
[66–68]. One of these systematic reviews investigated anxiety and depression [68], another, somewhat outdated review, 
investigated only sexual satisfaction [67], and the last review focused on the Middle East context [66]. None of the ear-
lier systematic reviews was as comprehensive as the current systematic review. This review aims to assess the effect 
of psychosocial interventions in improving sexual satisfaction, marital satisfaction, marital intimacy, sleep quality and 
 infertility-related QoL. It also seeks to explore (psychometric) characteristics of available psychosocial interventions 
including feasibility in resource-limited settings, adaptability to other LMICs settings, cost of the intervention. Additionally, 
the review examines the level of expertise required to deliver the intervention, whether the intervention can be delivered in 
peripheral health facilities by non-specialist healthcare providers and acceptability by patients.

A comprehensive synthesis of studies on psychosocial interventions for infertility within LMICs will help to objectively 

and rationally uncover the strengths and limitations in existing psychosocial interventions. The characteristics of exist-
ing interventions and the contexts in which they were administered need to be explored for adaptability and feasibility in 
sub-Saharan African countries. This is expected to help conceptualize care and improve marital intimacy, sexual satisfac-
tion, and QoL of individuals with infertility in LMICs settings as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
[69]. The main objective of this systematic review is to systematically synthesize existing data captured from the litera-
ture and other sources and provide robust evidence on the availability and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to 
improve the well-being of people with infertility problems in LMICs. Specifically, the study aims to: 1) assess the effective-
ness of documented psychosocial interventions for improving QoL, marital intimacy, and sexual satisfaction among indi-
viduals living in LMICs going through infertility problems, 2) assess the quality of life of individuals living in LMICs going 
through infertility, 3) assess (psychometric) characteristics of the documented psychosocial interventions in LMICs, and 4) 
assess psychological concerns of people going through infertility problems in LMICs.

Methods

This protocol will follow the standard guidelines specified in the Cochrane Handbook [70], and will be reported according 
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines for transpar-
ency and rigor [71,72] (S1 Table). The full review will be reported using the PRISMA guidelines [72]. The review will use 
comprehensive search methods that will attempt to retrieve all possible studies that meet pre-specified eligibility criteria 
and will use explicit, transparent, and methodical processes to select and appraise studies, extract, and analyse data, and 
use the PRISMA flow diagram [71] (S1 Fig) to delineate the methodological flow of studies from retrieval to analysis.

Patient and public involvement

The review questions and outcome measures have been developed in collaboration with the relevant patient and con-
sumer involvement and are informed by their priorities, experiences, and preferences in line with the GRIPP2 report-
ing checklists [73]. The results of the review will be shared with the relevant wider client communities who will also be 
involved in the dissemination of the results.

Criteria for considering studies for review

Types of studies

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and Observational studies (cohort, case-control cross-sectional studies) 
reporting on any psychosocial intervention used to improve QoL, marital intimacy, and sexual satisfaction in people with 
infertility problems living in LMICs as defined by ScHARR [77], will be eligible for inclusion. Reviews will not be considered 
for inclusion; however, we will snowball review papers for any potentially primary eligible studies missed in our primary 
searches and consider them for inclusion. Where the study reports a country or regional estimate without a well-defined 
sample (a representative sample or sub-sample of the source population) or data from secondary analyses, it will not be 
eligible for inclusion. Expert opinions, commentaries, newsletters, case series, and case studies will be excluded. Studies 
that assessed psychosocial problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem but did not investigate sexual satis-
faction, marital intimacy and, fertility-related QoL will be excluded.

Participants

Individuals (women or couples) with infertility problems living in a LMIC who received psychosocial intervention aimed to 
improve their QoL, marital intimacy, marital satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction. Infertility is defined by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) as a disorder of the male or female reproductive system that leads to failure to achieve a pregnancy 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335068  October 30, 2025

5 / 18

after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse [74]. This systematic review will include women and 
couples diagnosed with primary infertility where a couple has never been able to conceive a pregnancy after a minimum 
of 12 months of attempting to do so through unprotected intercourse. It will also include those with secondary infertility, 
characterized as the inability to conceive or carry a baby to term after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, in a woman 
who has previously had a baby without fertility treatments. Participants must have received any form of psychosocial inter-
vention that sought to improve their marital intimacy, marital and sexual satisfaction, and overall fertility-related QoL.

Studies focusing exclusively on men with infertility issues will not be eligible for inclusion.

Intervention

Psychosocial interventions, may include support programs, counseling, CBT, educational interventions, acceptance and 
commitment therapy (ACT), and relaxation techniques. Interventions may be women, couples, group, or Internet-based. 
Interventions will be stratified by format, frequency, duration, delivery mode, setting, provider qualifications and theoretical 
underpinnings. Pharmacological interventions will be excluded. Intervention characteristics to be examined include avail-
ability, effectiveness, ease of delivery/application, preference, patient understanding, contextual relevance, type of health 
professional able to apply it, appropriateness, feasibility and adaptability for use in the sub-Saharan African setting. These 
characteristics are usually influenced by culture, participant factors, or the context in which the intervention was originally 
developed. Adaptability of the intervention refers to the ease of modifying aspects of the intervention to make it relevant to 
the target population, thereby ensuring that the purpose of the intervention is achieved. Any other information or charac-
teristics that further describe the psychosocial interventions will be considered.

Control

•  Placebo

•  Pharmacological intervention.

•  Routine/standard fertility.

Outcomes

Primary outcome.  Effectiveness of psychosocial intervention assessed in terms of:

•  Sexual satisfaction, defined as the degree to which an individual is satisfied or happy with the sexual aspect of his or her 

relationship [75].

•  Marital satisfaction, defined as an individual’s emotional and attitudinal state toward their own marriage relationship [76]

•  Marital intimacy, defined as personal romantic or emotional communication that requires knowledge and understanding 

of another person to express thoughts and feelings [77].

•  Infertility-related quality of Life of persons with infertility problems.

Secondary outcomes. 

•  Quality of life (QoL), defined by WHO as an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture 

and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns [78].

•  Common mental health problems experienced by persons having infertility problems, such as depression and anxiety, 
just to mention a few. We will only consider mental health problems if it was investigated together with any of the afore-
mentioned primary outcomes, such as sexual satisfaction, marital satisfaction, and marital intimacy. Studies assessing 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335068  October 30, 2025

6 / 18

psychosocial problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, etc., but did not investigate sexual satisfaction, 
marital intimacy or QoL will be excluded.

•  Sleep quality, defined as “an individual’s self-satisfaction with all aspects of the sleep experience” [79].

•  Psychometric characteristics or properties of the intervention assessed in terms of:

◦  Feasibility in resource-limited settings, such as a country in LMICs context

◦  Adaptability to other LMICs settings

◦  Cost of the intervention

◦  Expertise required to deliver the intervention, including whether the intervention can be delivered by non-specialists 

in primary care settings

◦  Ease of delivery of intervention in resource-limited settings, including whether the intervention can be delivered in 

peripheral health facilities by non-specialist healthcare providers

◦  Preference by the patients

◦  Preference of intervention by healthcare providers

Adverse events.  We will collect information on all adverse events and categorize them into non-serious and serious 
events. Adverse advents in each category will be stratified by type, frequency, duration, and timing of occurrence of the 
adverse event.

•  Non‐serious adverse events─ to be categorized as mild, moderate or severe, including:

◦  Emotional distress in response to an unpleasant experience that arises from the effect of the psychosocial interven-

tions or memory of a particular unpleasant experience during, or after, the psychosocial intervention [80].

◦  Resistance─ where participants of a therapy exhibit unconscious defense mechanisms that hinder them from 

acknowledging and dealing with certain feelings, thoughts, or behaviours [81].

◦  Denial─ exhibiting a defense mechanism to the psychological process of refusing to accept or acknowledge a painful 

reality elicited by or during the delivery of the intervention [82].

◦  Dependence─ when a participant becomes mentally and/or emotionally reliant on the therapist [83].

•  Serious adverse events─ will include any untoward occurrence or effect that at any dose: results in death; life‐threat-
ening outcome; requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; results in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity.

Searches for the identification of studies

The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, LILACS, Cochrane CEN-
TRAL and PsycINFO (EBSCO), and Google Scholar from 2000 to 31st March 2025, without any language restriction, using 
all the relevant search terms and their synonyms, singular and plural forms, and spelling variations, together with the 
individual countries adapted from the ScHARR 2022 classification of LMICs. We structured the search around three key 
concepts: infertility, psychosocial interventions, and name of each LMIC, included a combination of both index terms (e.g., 
MeSH terms in PubMed) and free-text terms to capture relevant variations in terminology. We have incorporated Medical 
Subject Headings (MeSH) and other controlled vocabulary where applicable, alongside text words to enhance sensitivity 
and carefully combined terms using Boolean operators (AND, OR) to ensure both breadth and precision. The revised

strategy has been calibrated by running test searches to ensure it will retrieve all relevant studies”. The search strategy for 
PubMed has been reported in Table 1 and it will be adapted for use in the other databases. We will also search HINARI, 
African Journals Online, Conference Proceedings, Preprints and Thesis Repositories. Reference lists of relevant studies 
including relevant systematic reviews will be searched to retrieve studies missed by our searches. Experts in the field will 
be contacted for completed but unpublished studies.

Managing the search results and selecting studies

All studies retrieved from the various sources will be documented in a table and exported to Rayyan for de- 
duplication and study selection. A pre-tested study selection flow chart developed from the inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria (Fig 1) will be used for study selection. At least two reviewers will screen titles and abstracts against the study 
selection flowchart to select all potentially relevant studies. Full documents or texts will be sought for these studies 
for final assessment and selection against our pre-specified eligibility criteria. Studies that meet all the pre-specified 
inclusion criteria will be included in the systematic review. Any disagreements between reviewers will be resolved 
through discussion.

Data extraction and management

Data will be extracted using pretested data extraction form (S2 Table). The following information will be extracted: 
characteristics of the study including Study ID, country the study was conducted, year the study was conducted, 
sample size and setting (urban/rural); population variables such as age of participants, sex; type of psychosocial 
intervention (Supportive Program, Counselling, CBT, Educational Intervention, ACT and Relaxation Technique) all 
intervention characteristics such as format, intensity, frequency, number of sessions, duration of session, delivery 
mode, setting, provider qualifications, theoretical underpinnings and follow-up time; outcomes data (number achiev-
ing the desired effect of marital intimacy, sexual satisfaction, marital satisfaction, sleep quality as well as informa-
tion on psychometric characteristics of the intervention such as cost, adaptability, feasibility, expertise required to 
deliver and intervention preference); and information on adverse events including type, frequency, duration, and 
timing of the occurrence of the adverse event. All data conversions will be made as part of the data extraction 
process before the data analysis. Any discrepancies between the data extractors will be discussed and resolved by 
consensus.

Assessment of quality of the included studies for risk of bias

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) (S3 Table) will be used to assess risk of bias of included 
RCTs in five main domains: 1) risk of bias arising from the randomization process, 2) risk of bias due to deviations 
from the intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention) and risk of bias due to deviations from the 
intended interventions (effect of adhering to intervention), 3) missing outcome data, 4) risk of bias in measurement 
of the outcome, and 5) risk of bias in selection of the reported result. Each of the domains has a number of signalling 
questions with responses to each signalling questions being ‘Yes (N)’, ‘Probably Yes (PY)’, ‘Probably No (PN)’, ‘No 
(N)’, and ‘No Information (NI)’. The risk of bias in each trial will be judged as ‘Low’, ‘High’ or ‘Some concerns’. The 
results from the risk of bias assessment will be presented in a table with supporting statements from the primary stud-
ies. The risk of bias in non-randomised studies – of interventions will be assessed using ROBINS-Iv2 tool from seven 
domains: 1) risk of bias due to confounding, 2) risk of bias in classification of interventions, 3) risk of bias in selection 
of participants into the study (or into the analysis), 4) risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions,  
5) risk of bias due to missing data, 6) risk of bias arising from measurement of the outcome and 7) risk of bias in 
selection of the reported result. Each bias domain in ROBINS-I is addressed using a series of signalling questions

to gather important information about the study and the analysis being assessed. Most signalling questions have 
response options ‘Yes’, ‘Probably yes’, ‘Probably no’, ‘No’ and ‘No information’, with ‘Yes’ and ‘Probably yes’ hav-
ing the same implications for risk of bias and similarly for ‘No’ and ‘Probably no’. Some questions have additional 
response options (a ‘weak’ and a ‘strong’ version of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’) to help discriminate between higher and lower risk 
of bias. The risk of bias in each trial is judged as Low risk of bias (there is little or no concern about bias with regard 
to this domain), Moderate risk of bias (there is some concern about bias with regard to this domain, although it is 
not clear that there is an important risk of bias, Serious risk of bias (the study has some important problems in this 
domain: characteristics of the study give rise to a serious risk of bias) or Critical risk of bias (the study is very prob-
lematic in this domain: characteristics of the study give rise to a critical risk of bias, such that and the result should 
generally be excluded from evidence syntheses). The quality of observational studies will be assessed using Hoy’s 
quality assessment tool (S4 Table) in four risk of bias domains: selection, non-response, measurement, and data

analysis. For each domain, two independent reviewers will evaluate and classify it as having a ‘low risk of bias’, ‘high 
risk of bias’, or ‘unclear risk of bias’. The overall quality of evidence will be classified as low, high, or unclear risk of 
bias based on each study. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion between the reviewers.

Data analysis

The included studies will be summarized by their PICOS elements, including participant characteristics, study type, psy-
chosocial interventions, and outcomes of interest. Review Manager v5.4 (and where necessary Stata version 18.0) will be 
used to analyze quantitative data. Measures of effect; Odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) will be utilized to present dichot-
omous data, while mean difference (MD) will be used to express continuous outcome data. Continuous outcomes data 
measured using different scales or instruments will be reported as standardized mean difference (SMD). All measures will 
be accompanied by their corresponding confidence intervals (CIs). The study-specific estimates will be used to determine 
standard deviations, where applicable, based on point estimates and the appropriate denominators, assuming a binomial 
distribution to assess heterogeneity between studies. Then the magnitude of heterogeneity between included studies will 
be assessed quantitatively using the index of heterogeneity (I2 statistics). The range of I2 values that will be considered for 
categorizing heterogeneity are: 25% for low, 50% for moderate, and ≥75% for significant heterogeneity. If the data from 
multi-country studies cannot be disaggregated because the results were initially pooled, these studies will be excluded 
from the meta-analysis.

Adverse advents will be categorized as non-serious or serious events. Given the lack of uniformity, and the fact that 

adverse events are usually poorly reported, we anticipate synthesizing adverse events outcome data narratively and 
reporting the results in tables, stratified by type of intervention, and providing clear description of patterns, context, fre-
quency, duration, and timing of occurrence of the events. However, if data permit and the studies are sufficiently similar, 
we will compare event rates between intervention and control groups in meta-analysis and expressed as RR, OR, or risk 
difference (RD) using random-effects model. If the adverse events are rare, we will employ Peto odds ratio to estimate 
pooled event rates between the intervention and control. All estimates of adverse events will be reported with their 95% 
CIs.

Heterogeneity and subgroup analysis

We will determine the significance of heterogeneity using the p-value of the I2 statistic, and a p-value <0.05 will be consid-
ered evidence of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis will be performed where heterogeneity detected is significantly high 
and the possible sources will be explored. Heterogeneity will be assessed around variables such as sex, age of partici-
pants, study setting (hospital or community-based), geographical location (regions and subregions) and type of infertility. 
Sub-group analysis for RCTs will be done carefully in order not to break the randomization code of the trials.

Sensitivity analysis

This is a process of testing the robustness of the results. Data will be re-analysed to determine if the results are sensitive 
to specific review elements [84]. The domains to be considered are the quality of the included studies, sample size and 
meta-analysis technique applied.

Handling missing and incomplete data

An attempt will be made to extract sufficient data from all included studies. Where data on some pertinent variables are 
missing, the original authors of the primary studies will be contacted to see if they can provide the missing data. Where 
original authors are unable to provide the requested information or cannot be reached, we will not compute. Instead, the 
potential impact of missing data on the findings of the review will be addressed in the discussion section.

Grading level of evidence

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach will be used to 
assess the overall quality of evidence generated from the review for each outcome. The pooled data of each study will be 
evaluated against the five GRADE considered; risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias, 
and will be graded as high, high, moderate, low, and very low levels of evidence accordingly [85,86]. High-quality evidence 
is interpreted as further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect, while grading of very 
low quality implies an estimate of effect is very doubtful.

Ethics and dissemination

This study includes data from existing studies and does not require ethical approval. The findings of this systematic review 
will be made available to stakeholders, practitioners, patients and policy makers through presentation at scientific confer-
ences and symposia. The review will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journal.

Discussion

The impact of psychosocial stressors on the functional outcomes and overall QoL of infertile couples makes it an issue 
of public health concern, thus necessitating the inclusion of psychosocial intervention as a complementary management 
option of infertility [10]. This review aims to summarise the evidence of psychosocial interventions for improving marital 
intimacy, marital satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and overall fertility-related QoL in LMICs and to provide the psychomet-
ric characteristics of the interventions within the regions and countries to ascertain their effectiveness and adaptability. 
The findings from the review will inform the choice and implementation that is context relevant and culturally friendly for 
infertility care. The use of a predefined review process and rigorously assessing risk of bias in the included studies will 
minimize bias and improve internal validity whereas the use of PICOS to define the population, intervention/exposure, 
control/comparator, outcomes and study type will ensure the internally valid reviews findings are also generalisable to 
the wider source population. Furthermore, given that the review questions and outcome measures have been developed 
in collaboration with the relevant patient, consumer and stakeholder involvement, the findings will inform their priorities, 
experiences.

This systematic review protocol has been developed with consideration of infertility as an integral component of sexual 

and reproductive health and rights, and which attempts to target the negative psychosocial impact in an effort towards 
achieving the SDG 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and well-being for everyone at all ages, and SDG 5, which seeks 
to attain gender equality and empower all women and girls. In this context, the review will presents a comprehensive 
report to highlight the available psychosocial interventions and offer patient-led recommendations.

Strengths and limitations

The study will report the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis in LMICs to identify available psycho-
social interventions and determine their impact on infertile couples, with particular emphasis on marital intimacy, sexual 
satisfaction and quality of life. In order to minimize bias in the review process, we will employ a very comprehensive 
search strategy to retrieve studies from all relevant database and non-database sources, and select studies, extract data 
and assess quality in the included studies independently using validated tools. The review plans to assess certainty of the 
overall (pooled) evidence using GRADE. A potential limitation is the anticipated diversity of psychosocial interventions that 
will make direct comparisons difficult. However, we will classify the types of interventions used in primary studies carefully 
and perform subgroup analyses, where necessary possible, to explore the source of the heterogeneity and the subgroup 
that will benefit most from the interventions. We acknowledge that some of the primary studies will be of low quality, we 
will perform sensitivity analysis on the quality of studies domain to test the robustness of our pooled evidence.

Implications of the anticipated study findings

The findings from the proposed systematic review are expected to document psychosocial interventions in LMICs that 
improve marital intimacy and sexual satisfaction, ultimately impacting on the quality of life of people with infertility, particu-
larly women. The findings will also identify knowledge gaps to inform future research and provide evidence-based solu-
tions to improve psychosocial health care for people with infertility in LMICs.
