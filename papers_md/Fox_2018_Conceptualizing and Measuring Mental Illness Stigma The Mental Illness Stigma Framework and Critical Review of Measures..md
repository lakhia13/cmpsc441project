Abstract

Although the last decade has seen a proliferation of research on mental illness stigma, lack of 
consistency and clarity in both the conceptualization and measurement of mental illness stigma 
has limited the accumulation of scientific knowledge about mental illness stigma and its 
consequences. In the present article, we bring together the different foci of mental illness stigma 
research with the Mental Illness Stigma Framework (MISF). The MISF provides a common 
framework and set of terminology for understanding mechanisms of mental illness stigma that are 
relevant to the study of both the stigmatized and the stigmatizer. We then apply this framework to 
systematically review and classify stigma measures used in the past decade according to their 
corresponding stigma mechanisms. We identified more than 400 measures of mental illness 
stigma, two thirds of which had not undergone any systematic psychometric evaluation. 
Stereotypes and discrimination received the most research attention, while mechanisms that focus 
on the perspective of individuals with mental illness (e.g., experienced, anticipated, or internalized 
stigma) have been the least studied. Finally, we use the MISF to discuss the strengths and 
weaknesses of mental illness stigma measurement, identify gaps in the literature, and provide 
recommendations for future research.

“The terminology we use…should be clear, precisely defined, and used consistently 
to aid unambiguous clinical and scientific communication and promote clearer 
appraisal of, and generalizations from, empirical findings”

(Kelly, 2004 pg. 80)

Mental illness stigma is as a major obstacle to well-being among people with mental illness 
(PWMI). According to findings from the most recent nationally representative study of 
public attitudes toward mental illness in the U.S., only 42% of Americans aged 18–24 
believe PWMI can be successful at work, 26% believe that others have a caring attitude 
toward PWMI, and 25% believe that PWMI can recover from their illness (NAMI-GC, 
2013; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2008). A 
robust body of evidence demonstrates that PWMI experience discrimination in nearly every 
domain of their lives, including employment (Farina & Felner, 1973; Link, 1987; Stuart, 
2006), housing (Corrigan et al., 2003; Farina, Thaw, Lovern, & Mangone, 1974), and 
medical care (Thornicroft, Rose, & Kassam, 2007). Experiences of stigma are associated 
with increased symptom severity (e.g., Boyd, Adler, Otilingham, & Peters, 2014), decreased 
treatment seeking (e.g., Corrigan, 2004) and treatment non-adherence (e.g., Sirey et al., 
2001).

Given the prevalence of mental illness and the deleterious effects of stigma, mental illness 
stigma has been a widely studied research topic in a variety of disciplines, including 
psychology, sociology, public health, and medicine. Beginning with Erving Goffman’s 
(1963) seminal essay Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity, research on 
stigma has continued to grow each year, with the majority of stigma research occurring in 
the last decade (Bos, Pryor, Reeder & Stutterheim, 2013). Across disciplines, but especially 
within the field of psychology, researchers have been primarily concerned with examining 
mental illness stigma at the individual level (Link & Phelan, 2001). As Figure 1 
demonstrates, the number of published, peer-reviewed mental illness stigma articles 
appearing in searches of PubMed, PsycInfo/EBSCO, and Web of Science has steadily 
increased each year for the past ten years. As the psychological research on mental illness 
stigma has progressed, the stigma construct has been parsed into a number of different 
constructs, or mechanisms. Borrowing from the work of Link (2001), we use the term 
“stigma mechanism” throughout the present article to emphasize that these different 
constructs represent ways in which individuals respond to having, or not having, a mental 
illness (Earnshaw & Chaudoir, 2009; Link, 2001).

The proliferation of research on mental illness stigma mechanisms in the psychological 
literature has been accompanied by a sharp increase in stigma measures. In 2004, Link and 
colleagues published a review of mental illness stigma measures, with guidelines and 
suggestions for researchers interested in studying and measuring mental illness stigma. In 
addition to describing the already substantial number of stigma measures that existed at that 
time, they identified a number of gaps in stigma measurement, including the need for 
measures related to the experiences of PWMI (e.g., internalized stigma). As Figure 2 
demonstrates, more than 400 new measures of mental illness stigma have been developed

since 2004. The overabundance of measures may be attributed, in part, to the lack of 
consistency in how stigma mechanisms are defined, which may make it difficult for 
researchers to identify existing measures that meet their needs. Such inconsistencies in 
terminology and measurement make it difficult to evaluate the state of the field, and in turn, 
may hinder efforts to develop interventions to reduce or eliminate mental illness stigma.

Aims of the Review

In the present article, we first review existing limitations and challenges currently facing the 
mental illness stigma literature with a primary focus on the psychological literature. Next, 
we bring together the different foci of mental illness stigma research in an overarching 
conceptual framework for understanding how individuals experience stigma, the Mental 
Illness Stigma Framework (Figure 3). After overviewing key aspects of this framework—
and their associated benefits for organizing mental illness stigma research, we demonstrate 
the usefulness of this framework by applying it— to systematically review and classify 
mental illness stigma measures that have appeared in the literature since Link and 
colleagues’ (2004) previous measure review. We then identify gaps in the literature and 
limitations with the measurement of mental illness stigma, and provide recommendations for 
future research.

Because stigma is a social process that manifests at multiple levels, researchers in fields such 
as sociology and anthropology have also developed theoretical perspectives on mental illness 
stigma. Many of these theories consider the processes whereby mental illness stigma is 
socially constructed and reinforced. Consequently, researchers from other fields have studied 
other forms of stigma including structural stigma (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 
2013) as well as cultural manifestations of stigma (e.g., Abdullah & Brown, 2011; Yang et 
al., 2007). In the present review, we focus our attention on individual-level experiences of 
stigma, and draw from a substantial body of primarily psychological literature to further 
understanding of how individuals experience, and are impacted by, mental illness stigma. In 
the discussion section, we briefly consider how other forms of stigma may contribute to our 
larger understanding of how mental illness stigma operates.

Limitations and Challenges of the Mental Illness Stigma Literature

Clear and consistent terminology is important to all fields of inquiries. A number of 
researchers have pointed out the confusion, complexity, and/or lack of clarity in the mental 
illness stigma literature (e,g., Angermeyer & Dietrich, 2006; Brohan et al., 2010; Livingston 
& Boyd, 2010; Thornicroft, 2008). This lack of conceptual clarity is not unique to mental 
illness stigma research. In reference to the HIV/AIDS stigma literature, Deacon (2006) 
noted that “the concept of stigma has suffered from ‘conceptual inflation’ and a consequent 
lack of analytical clarity” (pg. 419). For example, the term “stigma” is often used to refer to 
“both the stigmatizing beliefs themselves and the effects of these stigmatization processes” 
(p. 419). The same can be said for the mental illness stigma literature, and even the broader 
stigma construct itself, which has been criticized for its complexity and variability in 
definitions both within and across disciplines (Link & Phelan, 2001; Pescosolido & Martin, 
2015; Phelan, Link, & Dovidio, 2008).

A prominent issue within the mental illness stigma literature is that researchers frequently 
use different terms to describe the same stigma concepts and the same terms to refer to 
different constructs. For example, the term perceived stigma is sometimes used to refer to 
what others term experienced stigma or internalized stigma. The concept of anticipated 
stigma, as we define it in this article, is sometimes referred to as stigma concerns, stigma 
apprehension, or stigma consciousness. And the terms internalized stigma and self-stigma 
are often used interchangeably. This proliferation of terminologies and definitions of mental 
illness stigma represent a critical barrier to the advancement of mental illness stigma 
research. A search for articles on experienced stigma may not reveal important research on 
perceived stigma; a search for anticipated stigma may not reveal articles on stigma concerns, 
and a search for studies of perceived stigma could produce studies of not only perceived 
stigma, but also studies of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination, as well as experienced 
or internalized stigma.

Another challenge to the field has been the siloing of research based on the particular type of 
mental disorder under study. Mental illness encompasses a broad and diverse set of disorders 
and it is possible that mental illness stigma may manifest slightly differently depending on 
the type of disorder with which an individual has been labeled. For example, an individual 
diagnosed with Schizophrenia may be viewed as more dangerous than someone diagnosed 
with an anxiety or depressive disorder (Feldman & Crandall, 2007). Likewise, because the 
cause of posttraumatic stress disorder is typically believed to be external rather than internal 
(i.e., trauma exposure), an individual diagnosed with this disorder is likely to be considered 
less responsible for their mental illness than an individual diagnosed with a personality 
disorder.

While a disorder–specific approach to the study of mental illness stigma has a number of 
benefits, in the present review we have taken a broader approach for several reasons. First, a 
broad approach can bring together the common threads of the experiences of mental illness 
stigma. Second, such an approach is consistent with macro-level theories of stigma that 
cross-cut stigmatized identities (Link & Phelan, 2001; Phelan, Link & Dovidio, 2008; 
Pescosolido & Martin, 2015), as well as meta-analyses demonstrating that the effects of 
stigma are similar across a variety of stigmatized conditions (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 
2009) and different mental health disorders (Mak, Poo, Pun, & Cheung, 2007). Third, the 
feasibility of a broad approach is evidenced by the finding that stigmatization of PWMI is 
driven by three core stereotypes—dangerousness, rarity, and responsibility—and disorders 
can be ranked in terms of their level of social rejection (Feldman & Crandall, 2007; Silton, 
Flannelly, Milstein, & Vaaler, 2011). Finally, van Brakel (2006) argues that the impact of 
stigma is similar across a variety of health conditions, suggesting that generic stigma 
measures can provide an accurate assessment of how people experience stigma. This work 
suggests that a macro-level framework of mental illness stigma could provide much needed 
clarity to the field of mental illness stigma research.

Another limitation of mental illness stigma literature is that most of the existing stigma 
models and frameworks do not incorporate stigma concepts that are relevant to both research 
on the stigmatizer and the stigmatized. Yet, such an approach has important benefits, as the 
inclusion of the perspective of both individuals who have and do not have mental illness

recognizes that experiences and outcomes of stigma are fundamentally shaped by whether 
the individual possesses the socially devalued characteristic. Classic theories of stigma (Link 
& Phelan, 2001), as well as theories of intergroup relations (Allport, 1954; Brewer, 2007) 
emphasize that “separation” is an important component of stigma. The distinction between 
“us” and “them” is what allows stigma to unfold (Link & Phelan, 2001).

To address some of the limitations of the mental illness stigma literature and guide our 
review of mental illness stigma measures, we developed the Mental Illness Stigma 
Framework (MISF; Figure 3). The development of the MISF was informed by a number of 
prominent mental illness stigma theories, conceptualizations and definitions, including 
modified labeling theory (Link, Cullen, Struening, Shrout, & Dohrenwend, 1989), Link and 
Phelan’s (2001) definition of stigma, social cognitive theory of public and self-stigma 
(Corrigan & Watson, 2002; Corrigan, Watson, & Barr, 2006; Corrigan, Kerr, & Knudson, 
2005), Pryor and Reeder’s (2011) four manifestations of stigma, the constructs of 
anticipated and experienced discrimination (Brohan et al., 2013; Thornicroft et al., 2007), 
and the construct of internalized stigma (Boyd Ritsher, Otilingam, & Grajales, 2003). Our 
proposed framework is meant to complement, not replace, existing frameworks, models, or 
theories. A key benefit of the framework is that by integrating existing definitions and 
conceptualizations of mental illness stigma through common terminology, we tie together 
the immense and varied body of mental illness stigma research and delineated the types of 
stigma that are most important to outcomes for people with and without mental illness, 
regardless of the specific condition under study.

The Mental Illness Stigma Framework

The top box of the MISF represents the identification of mental illness as a culturally-
situated and socially devalued identity. How do individuals understand, respond to, and 
experience mental illness stigma? The answer to this question depends on whether an 
individual has experienced a mental illness. Existing research on mental illness stigma at the 
individual level can be broken down into two major categories: Research focused on the 
perspective of those doing the stigmatizing, typically the general public, and research 
focused on those who are on the receiving end of stigmatization, individuals with mental 
illness (or a history of mental illness). Thus, the MISF separates stigma mechanisms 
accordingly. Separating stigma mechanisms based on perspective is consistent with existing 
theories and definitions of stigma, (Bos, et al., 2013; Clement et al., 2015; Corrigan & 
Watson, 2002; Corrigan, Rafacz, & Rusch, 2011; Link & Phelan, 2001; Martin, Pescosolido, 
Olafsdottir, & McLeod, 2007; Pescosolido & Martin, 2015; Pryor & Reeder, 2011; van 
Brakel, 2006).

Perspective of the Stigmatizer

Drawing from the social psychological (Allport,1954; Brewer, 2007; Dovidio, Glick, & 
Rudman, 2005; Nelson, 2009), mental illness (Corrigan et al., 2005; Corrigan & Watson, 
2002; Thornicroft, Rose, Kassam, & Sartorius, 2007), and broader stigma literature (Bos, 
Pryor, & Reeder, 2013; Pryor & Reeder, 2011), the three mechanisms that are most relevant 
to individuals who do not have (or have never had) a mental illness are stereotypes,

prejudice, and discrimination. These three mechanisms represent the cognitive, affective, 
and behavioral responses people may have to someone who possesses a devalued identity. 
Stereotypes are beliefs, or “cognitive schemas” about the characteristics and behaviors of 
groups of individuals (Corrigan, 2005; Dovidio, Hewstone, Glick, & Esses, 2010; Stangor, 
2009) and represent the cognitive response to someone with mental illness stigma. The core 
stereotypes associated with mental illness include dangerousness, rarity, responsibility, 
incompetence, weakness of character, and dependence (Feldman & Crandall, 2007; Taylor 
& Dear, 1981).

The affective component of mental illness stigma is reflected in prejudice, defined as the 
emotional reaction or feelings that people have toward a group or member of a group 
(Stangor, 2009). Most often, these feelings are negative, although they do not necessarily 
need to be. The most common forms of prejudice toward PWMI are fear, pity, and anger 
(Corrigan, 2005; Corrigan, Watson, Warpinksi, & Garcia, 2004). Prejudice is strongly 
connected to stereotypes. As examples, the stereotype of dangerousness may lead to feelings 
of fear and the stereotype of incompetence may lead to feelings of pity. Prejudice toward 
PWMI may also be expressed or experienced as anxiety, leading to awkward interactions 
(Hebl, Tickle, & Heatherton, 2000) and/or serve as a precursor to the behavioral aspect of 
stigma, discrimination. Discrimination is defined as the unfair or unjust behaviors directed at 
PWMI (Allport, 1954; Brewer, 2007). Discriminatory behaviors exist along a continuum 
from subtle to overt, but which result in the “differential and disadvantaged treatment of the 
stigmatized” (Pescosolido & Martin, 2015). There are four common types of discrimination 
directed towards PWMI described in the literature: withholding help, avoidance, segregation, 
and coercion (Corrigan & Rüsch, 2002; Corrigan & Watson, 2002).

Stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination lead to a range of outcomes that affect both 
people living with and without mental illness. Individuals who endorse stigmatizing attitudes 
toward PWMI are less likely to support insurance parity (i.e., covering mental illness at the 
same level as other medical conditions) and increased government funding for mental health 
treatment (Barry & McGinty, 2014). In the workplace, discrimination can limit the economic 
opportunities of PWMI. Additionally, these mechanisms prevent people without diagnoses 
of mental illness from seeking mental health support to avoid gaining the label of mental 
illness (Corrigan, 2004).

Perspective of the Stigmatized

Three stigma mechanisms are most relevant to PWMI (or people with a history of mental 
illness): experienced stigma, anticipated stigma, and internalized stigma. Experienced 
stigma is defined as experiences of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination from others in 
the past or present (Cechnicki, Angermeyer & Bielańska, 2011; Quinn & Earnshaw, 2011; 
Wahl, 1999) and is sometimes referred to as enacted stigma (Bos et al., 2013). Experienced 
stigma includes both chronic, day-to-day experiences of unjust or unfair treatment (e.g., 
interpersonal slights) as well as acute, major experiences (e.g., fired from one’s job), both of 
which are related to a range of deleterious outcomes among people with stigmatized 
identities (Williams, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2003). Anticipated stigma, sometimes referred 
to as felt stigma (Bos et al., 2013), is defined as the extent to which a person with mental

illness expects to be the target of stereotypes, prejudice, or discrimination in the future 
(Quinn & Chaudoir, 2009; Quinn & Earnshaw, 2011). Because PWMI are likely aware of 
the negative stereotypes associated with mental illness and negative ways in which PWMI 
are treated, they may worry about people viewing them as weak or dangerous, being afraid 
or avoiding them, or being denied work. PWMI may therefore anticipate stigma even if they 
have never personally experienced stigma. Finally, we define internalized stigma as the 
extent to which people endorse the negative beliefs and feelings associated with the 
stigmatized identity for the self (Bos et al., 2013; Boyd Ritsher et al., 2003; Corrigan, 
Watson, & Barr, 2006; Link, 1987; Quinn & Earnshaw, 2011). In other words, internalized 
stigma represents the application of negative stereotypes and prejudice to the self. For 
PWMI, this may involve perceiving that they are dangerous, to be blamed for their illness, 
are incompetent, or childlike (Taylor & Dear, 1981). Internalized stigma is sometimes 
referred to as self-stigma, a term which reflects the application of mental illness stigma to 
the self (Corrigan, Rafacz, & Rüsch, 2011; Corrigan & Rao, 2012). When an individual 
applies negative stereotypes of mental illness to the self, they may believe they are devalued 
(Quinn & Earnshaw, 2013), which in turn may lead to increased psychological distress 
(Ritsher & Phelan, 2004) or decreased self-esteem (Corrigan, et al., 2011; Corrigan & Rao, 
2012).

Experienced, anticipated, and internalized stigma are associated with negative outcomes for 
PWMI. Perceived and anticipated stigma undermine mental illness treatment adherence and 
initiation (Corrigan, 2004; Sirey et al., 2001). Anticipated and experienced stigma are 
stressors (Link & Phelan, 2006), which may elicit psychological and physiological stress 
responses that impact mental and physical health. Internalized stigma is associated with 
depression, decreased self-esteem, and increased symptom severity (Boyd et al., 2014).

Perceived Stigma

Perceived stigma is the one stigma mechanism in the framework that is shared by both 
people with and without mental illness. We define perceived stigma as perceptions of 
societal beliefs (stereotypes), feelings (prejudice), and behaviors (discrimination) toward 
PWMI (Bos et al., 2013; Griffiths, Christensen, Jorm, Evans, & Groves, 2004; Link, 1987). 
Perceived stigma is distinct from an individual’s own beliefs, feelings, and behaviors about 
PWMI, which Griffiths and colleagues refer to as personal stigma (and which is captured by 
the mechanisms of stereotypes and discrimination in the MISF). Research has established 
the importance of treating personal and perceived stigma as distinct constructs. Griffiths et 
al. (2008) found that whereas people’s own stigma-related beliefs were associated with 
greater psychological distress, less previous contact with people with depression, and lower 
depression literacy, perceived stigma was only associated with psychological distress. 
Additionally, demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, education, experience with someone 
with depression, country of birth) explained 22% of the variance in individual’s own stigma-
related beliefs, while only explaining 1.6% for perceived stigma.

The extent to which people perceive the stigma of mental illness is shaped by whether they 
have experienced mental illness. For example, studies have shown a positive relationship 
between mental illness symptom severity and perceived stigma (Freidl, Piralic, Spitzl, &

Aigner 2008; Golberstein, Eisenberg, & Gollust, 2008; Griffiths et al., 2008). Further, 
perceived stigma is associated with negative outcomes for PWMI. In Link’s (1987) seminal 
paper examining the negative labeling effects of mental illness, he showed that for PWMI 
who have been labeled as mentally ill, perceived discrimination and devaluation were 
associated with a number of negative outcomes associated with employment, earnings, and 
demoralization (Link, 1987; Link et al., 2004), but this was not the case for PWMI who had 
never received the label.

Intersectionality

Finally, the MISF recognizes that there is intersectionality in experiences of stigma, a 
perspective that emphasizes that individuals also live with other characteristics representing 
privilege and marginalization, and that it is important to take these other characteristics into 
account in order to understand their lived experiences and outcomes (Cole, 2009; Crenshaw, 
1991; hooks, 1990). This perspective therefore allows for commonality in experiences of 
stigma across all PWMI, while simultaneously emphasizing that individual experiences of 
mental illness stigma may vary depending on one’s specific mental illness diagnosis, 
treatment engagement, socio-economic status, gender, race, culture, and/or other

Application of the Mental Illness Stigma Framework to Measurement

The proliferation of research on mental illness stigma has been accompanied by a stark 
increase in stigma measures. While the availability of multiple measures is not inherently 
problematic, the development of new measures may be inefficient when validated measures 
of the same construct already exist. The availability and use of so many measures can also 
present difficulties for researchers trying to draw broad conclusions from the literature. In 
their meta- analysis of stigma change programs, Corrigan and colleagues (2012) noted that 
there were 22 different outcome measures in their analysis, assessing a range of attitudes, 
affects, and behavior intentions. As the choice of measures is tied to how researchers define 
constructs, the use of so many measures can make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about 
mental illness research.

Additionally, to the extent that the mental illness stigma measures in use today do not 
differentiate between stigma mechanisms, researchers may miss opportunities to examine 
the implications of different stigma mechanisms and may inadvertently dilute or amplify the 
effects of one particular mechanism by failing to acknowledge that their measure reflects 
multiple mechanisms. For example, Livingston and Boyd (2010) found a robust negative 
relationship between internalized stigma, hope, self-esteem and treatment adherence, and a 
positive association between internalized stigma and symptom severity in their meta-
analysis. However, their broad definition of internalized stigma incorporated measures of 
experienced stigma, anticipated stigma, stereotypes, and perceived stigma. While their 
findings present a broad picture of the relationship between mental illness stigma and 
various outcomes, they cannot inform conclusions about the role of internalized stigma as 
defined by other researchers (Corrigan et al., 2006; Quinn & Earnshaw, 2011).

Understanding which stigma mechanisms are being assessed in any given measure is vitally 
important. Each stigma mechanism may impact people uniquely. For example, a recent 
meta-analysis of stigma and help-seeking found that internalized stigma predicted help-
seeking, whereas perceived, experienced, and anticipated stigma did not (Clement et al., 
2015). To move the study of mental illness stigma forward, we need to identify measures 
that can be used to reliably and validly measure different mechanisms of mental illness 
stigma (Corrigan & Shapiro, 2010). In the next section, we use MISF to guide a systematic 
review and evaluation of mental illness stigma measures. We focused our review on the ten 
year period following Link et al.’s (2004) review of mental illness stigma measures. Unlike 
previous reviews (e.g., Brohan et al., 2010; Corrigan & Shapiro, 2010; Link et al., 2004), we 
provide a broad review of measures of mental illness stigma, whether validated or 
unvalidated, in order to present a comprehensive overview of the state of mental illness 
stigma measurement.

We conducted a literature search on articles published between 2004 and 2014 using 
PubMed, EBSCO databases (PsycInfo, Academic Search Premier, Education Full Text, 
General Science Full Text, PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, 
Social Sciences Full Text, Women’s Studies International), and Web of Science. The search 
was limited to peer-reviewed, quantitative or empirical manuscripts published in English. 
Using titles, abstracts, and keywords, we searched for articles containing the keyword stigma 
and any of the following: mental health, mental illness, schizo*, depress*, anxiety, PTSD, 
posttraumatic, eating disorder*, anorexia, bulimia, or personality* disorder. We excluded the 
following keywords: epilepsy, HIV, AIDS, dementia. Next, we checked the reference 
sections of reviews and meta-analyses articles published in the past ten years (Brohan et al., 
2010; Clement et al., 2015, Livingston & Boyd, 2010; Mak, Poon, Pun, & Cheung, 2007; 
Schomerus & Angermeyer, 2008) and our personal libraries for additional articles.

Method

Screening of Studies

An initial screening of the titles and abstracts of 3901 articles resulted in the identification of 
1282 articles that were potentially relevant to our review. The first author reviewed all 3901 
articles and a second coder reviewed 1086 articles (35%) to ensure reliability. Coders agreed 
95% of the time and all disagreements (n =51) were included in the full-text review. The 
full-text of each of the 1282 articles was then reviewed to determine if the study contained a 
mental illness stigma measure. After the full-text review, an additional 326 articles were 
excluded. In total, 957 articles contained at least one stigma measure. Supplemental Figure 
S1 contains the PRISMA diagram with the literature search details (Moher, Liberati, 
Tetzlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA Group, 2009).

Organizing Measures

For each of the 957 articles, we identified the stigma measure(s) that was used and classified 
it into one of two categories. The first category represents measures that have been cited in 
at least one study (not including the study in which the measure was originally published)

and/or measures that have documented psychometrics. Measures in this category can be 
found in Table 1 (n = 140).

The second category consisted of measures described as being specifically created for the 
study, measures where no citation information was provided, measures that were created by 
pulling items from multiple measures, and newly developed measures of stigma that had not 
yet been cited or psychometrically validated in other studies. We refer to this set of measures 
as “study-created measures” and although they are not included in Table 1, we classified the 
stigma mechanisms assessed in each measure and summarize the findings. In total, we 
identified 304 study-created measures (reference list of articles containing study-created 
measures is available from the first author).

Not included in either category of measures are national or international “indicator” 
measures of stigma (n = 8). These measures were typically one or two items and were 
designed to be easily administered in population-level studies to gauge overall levels of 
stigma in a particular country or context (e.g., General Social Survey, National Survey 
Study-Children, National Comorbidity Study). A list and description of these measures is 
available from the first author.

Classifying Measures

We attempted to obtain a copy of each measure included in Table 1. We were not able to 
obtain original copies of two measures that were not published in English (Sibitz et al., 
2013; Zeng et al., 2009). If the article in which the original measure was cited provided the 
items or enough detail to classify the type of stigma measured, we kept it in Table 1. Our 
final list included 140 measures of stigma, comprising 330 scales or subscales. For each 
measure, we recorded the psychometric properties described in the paper and the number of 
times it was cited in our search. We examined the items included in the measure and 
classified the stigma mechanism(s) the measure captured at the factor or subscale level. For 
some measures, there were multiple versions or adaptations available (e.g., validated in a 
different language or for a different population than the original measure). If an alternative 
version of a measure had a published psychometric paper available, we counted it as a 
separate measure when determining the total number of measures we identified and when 
examining the psychometric characteristics available for the measures. However, in order to 
avoid over-inflating the totals for the stigma mechanisms contained in the measures, we 
grouped multiple versions of measures together and only classified the stigma mechanisms 
once for all versions of the measure (assuming they shared the same items and factor 
structure). Operational definitions and example items for each stigma mechanism are 
included in Supplemental File 2.

Psychometric Evaluation of Measures

Information regarding the availability of psychometric properties of each measure is 
included in Table 1 and a more detailed evaluation of the quality of the evidence for these 
measurement properties is included in Supplemental File 3. In Table 1, measures were given 
an “R” if details about at least one form of reliability (e.g., internal consistency, test-retest) 
were available and a “V” if details about at least one form of validity (e.g., construct,

convergent, predictive, concurrent) were available. Measures were given a “D” if the 
underlying dimensionality (i.e., factor structure) of the measure was reported. We gave a 
rating of “P” if there was a published paper specifically describing the development of the 
measure. A measure was considered well-established in the literature and given a rating of 
“WE” if it had been cited at least 10 times. For measures that were developed before 2004, 
we checked PsycInfo to see if it had been cited more than 10 times.

In Supplemental File 3, we evaluated measures using the quality criteria developed by 
Terwee et al. (2007). As part of the COSMIN initiative (Consensus-based Standards for the 
selection of health Measurement Instruments), Terwee, Mokkink, and colleagues developed 
a set of standard measurement quality criteria in order to facilitate comparisons of health 
outcomes questionnaires (Mokkink et al., 2010a, 2010b; Terwee et al., 2007). Terwee et al. 
provide guidelines for assessing the quality of evidence for content validity, internal 
consistency, criterion validity, construct validity, reproducibility, responsiveness, floor and 
ceiling effects, and interpretability. For each measurement property, measures are given a 
“+”, “−,” “indeterminate,” or “no information available” rating. A full description of each 
rating is provided in Supplemental File 3. Within the stigma literature, the COSMIN criteria 
have been used to evaluate measures of internalized stigma (Stevelink, Wu, Voorend, & van 
Brekel, 2012) and measures of experiences of mental illness stigma (Brohan et al., 2010). In 
the present study, we followed the same procedures as Brohan et al. (2010) and evaluated 
measures based on a subset of the COSMIN criteria most relevant to measures of stigma: 
content validity, internal consistency, construct validity, test-retest reliability, and floor-
ceiling effects.

Results

Overview of mental illness stigma measures

Figure 2 presents the number of stigma measures that have been developed in the past 
decade, broken down by whether the measure has been psychometrically validated for its 
intended use. The findings are striking. On average, 36 measures of stigma have been 
developed per year since 2004. On average since 2004, measures without established 
psychometrics have appeared in the literature about six times as often as new validated 
measures. Measures have been developed to assess every stigma mechanism, and for a wide 
range of mental illnesses, including depression (e.g., Griffiths et al., 2004; Griffiths et al., 
2008), alcohol and substance use disorders (e.g., Brown, 2011; Glass, Kristjansson, & 
Bucholz, 2013; Luoma, O’Hair, Kohlenberg, Hayes, & Fletcher, 2010; Luoma et al., 2007; 
Luoma et al., 2013), schizophrenia (e.g., Ucok et al., 2006), suicide (e.g., Batterham, Calear, 
& Christensen, 2013), suicide attempts (e.g., Scocco, Castriotta, Toffol, & Preti, 2012), 
generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., Griffiths, Batterham, Barney, & Parsons, 2011), and 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (e.g., Fuermaier et al., 2012).

Overall Psychometric Summary of Mental Illness Measures

The fifth column of Table 1 contains a description of the psychometric characteristics of 
each measure. In total, 55.0% (n = 77) of measures had a published psychometric paper 
available (i.e., a paper describing the development of the measure and its psychometric

characteristics) and 17.1% (n = 24) had been cited at least ten times. Information regarding 
the dimensionality of the measure was described for 58.6% (n = 82), and 48.6% (n = 68) had 
information about at least one form of validity. The majority of scales (n = 115, 82.1%) had 
information regarding the reliability of the measure. Fourteen measures did not report any 
psychometric properties and three measures were found to have no psychometric support.

Of the measures with a psychometric paper available, 61.0% (n = 47) included an 
examination of at least one form each of reliability, validity, and dimensionality. A total of 
eight of those measures have been cited at least 10 times in the past decade (although we 
acknowledge that the 14 measures published since 2012 that have all three psychometric 
characteristics available may not have been in the literature long enough to be cited 10 
times). While there were at least two psychometric characteristics available for most 
measures in Table 1 (n = 91, 65.0%), 34 measures (24.3%) had only one type of 
psychometric data available.

Mental Illness Stigma Mechanisms

Before examining the measures associated with each of the stigma mechanisms in the MISF, 
we began by looking at the number of measures that were associated with the perspective of 
the stigmatizer versus those associated with the perspective of the stigmatized. Of all the 
measures we identified, 39 (28%) addressed the perspective of the stigmatized and 100 
(72%) were developed from the perspective of the stigmatizer. In the broader literature 
search, 327 articles (34.2%) were focused on the perspective of the stigmatized (i.e., 
PWMI).

Stereotypes—Stereotypes were the most widely measured stigma mechanism in our 
review, with 418 of the 957 articles (43.5%) containing a measure of the extent to which 
people endorse stereotypical beliefs about mental illness. Among the measures we 
identified, stereotypes were captured in 128 different scales or subscales. Of those 128 
different scales or subscales, 63.3% (n = 81) solely measured stereotypes. The remaining 
scales or subscales (n = 47) included items assessing at least one other stigma mechanism, 
with discrimination being the most common mechanism to co-occur within the scale (n = 
35).

In terms of their psychometric properties, 28 measures reported information on reliability, 
validity and dimensionality, and another 29 measures reported only two of those three 
characteristics. Fifteen measures only reported information on one psychometric 
characteristic, and eight measures did not provide any psychometric information. In total, 45 
measures had a psychometric paper available, and 9 measures were classified as well-
established.

The most widely used measure containing stereotypes was the ISMI scale (Boyd Ritsher et 
al., 2003; n = 89), followed by the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS; Griffiths et al., 2004; 
2008; n = 56), the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ; Corrigan, Green, Lundin, Kubiak, & 
Penn, 2001; n = 48), and the Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally Ill Scale (CAMI; 
Taylor & Dear, 1981; n = 43). Both the ISMI and CAMI are well-validated measures, with 
psychometric information available regarding their reliability, validity and dimensionality

(although only the ISMI has a published psychometric paper). Reliability and dimensionality 
have been examined with the AQ and DSS.

The most common stereotypes addressed in the stereotype measures were that PWMI are 
weak, dangerous, unpredictable, violent, and that they are responsible for their condition. 
Some measures focus on the stereotypes associated with specific disorders. For example, the 
“personal stigma” subscale of the DSS asks people the extent to which they think that people 
with depression can snap out of it. Although the ADHD stigma scale (Kellison, Bussing, 
Bell & Garvan, 2010) focuses on ADHD, the items were adapted from an HIV stigma scale 
and could be adapted for other mental illnesses. The “personal stigma” subscale of the 
Generalised Anxiety Stigma Scale (Griffiths et al., 2011) also addresses stereotypes that 
could be applied to other mental disorders. Thus, although numerous measures have focused 
on a specific disorder, for the most part, the stereotypes included could apply to any disorder.

Prejudice—Prejudice was the least measured stigma mechanism, measured in 141 articles 
(14.7%), and captured in 42 scales or subscales. Twenty measures or subscales also included 
items assessing other stigma mechanisms, with stereotypes being the most common co-
occurring mechanism. The most cited measures of prejudice were the AQ and the CAMI. A 
total of ten measures had information related to all three psychometric characteristics, 13 
measures presented two psychometric characteristics, and nine measures reported just one. 
Two measures did not provide any psychometric information. Three measures were well-
established, and 16 had a psychometric paper.

Fear and anger appear to be the most common forms of prejudice captured in the measures. 
The AQ contains a fear subscale, and the CAMI includes items that address fear (e.g., It is 
frightening to think of people with mental problems living in residential neighborhoods) and 
lack of sympathy (e.g., The mentally ill do not deserve our sympathy).

Discrimination—Discrimination was the second most widely measured stigma 
mechanism in our review, with 43.1% (n = 412) of articles containing a measure of 
discrimination. Among the measures we identified, discrimination was captured in 69 
different scales or subscales, and was the sole stigma mechanism measured in 29 (42.0%) of 
the scales or subscales. Stereotypes were the most common co-occurring stigma mechanism.

In terms of psychometric characteristics of the measures, eight measures were rated as well-
established and 15 measures had information available regarding reliability, validity and 
dimensionality. A total of 19 measures reported two psychometric characteristics, 13 
measures reported only one, and four measures did not provide any psychometric 
information.

The most cited measure of discrimination was also the most cited overall—social distance. 
Social distance was measured in 213 of 957 articles (22.3%). The original social distance 
scale (SDS) was a type of Guttman scale developed by Bogardus (1933) and contains seven 
equidistant items related to people’s willingness to engage in social contact with people 
from other social groups. Participants are asked to read each statement and indicate whether 
they would be willing to engage in that type of social relationship (yes/no). However, many

researchers use modified versions of the SDS or created their own. For example, Link et al. 
(1987) modified the Bogardus SDS so that the seven items were no longer necessarily 
equidistant, and participants respond to each of seven items using a 0 to 3 Likert scale. 
Others tie the social distance scale to a vignette describing someone with mental illness 
(e.g., Boyd, Katz. Link & Phelan, 2010; Yap, Reavley, & Jorm, 2013). Given the variability 
in how social distance is measured, it is challenging to assess the psychometric 
characteristics of the measure. However, reliability information is available for both the 
Bogardus and Link versions of the scales.

Other concepts that were captured in the discrimination measures include avoidance, social 
restrictiveness, and willingness to help. For example, the AQ contains subscales that assess 
willingness to help someone with mental illness as well as the extent to which people agree 
that PWMI should be segregated from the general population (i.e., put in mental hospitals).

Experienced Stigma—Experienced stigma was captured in 17.2% (n =165) of the 
articles and we identified 27 scales or subscales measuring experienced stigma. The majority 
of measures exclusively focused on experienced stigma (63.0%). However, ten subscales 
also captured other mechanisms, with anticipated or internalized stigma co-occurring most 
often. In terms of psychometrics, nine measures reported all three psychometric 
characteristics, four measures reported two forms, six reported only one form, and one did 
not present any. Six measures were well-established, and 12 measures had psychometric 
papers available.

The most cited measure of experienced stigma was the ISMI, which includes an experienced 
stigma subscale that assesses day-to-day discrimination experienced by PWMI. The next 
most cited measures of experienced stigma were the CESQ, Link et al.’s (1997) Rejection 
Experiences Scale, and Fife & Wright’s (2000) Social Impact Scale (SIS), all of which 
include items assessing both day-to-day discrimination (e.g., being avoided), as well as more 
acute forms of discrimination (e.g., being denied a job).

Anticipated Stigma—In total, 10.0% (n = 96) of articles cite measures that assesses 
anticipated stigma, and we identified 37 anticipated stigma scales or subscales. Fifteen 
measures provided information regarding reliability, validity, and dimensionality, and twelve 
of those also included a published psychometric paper. Six measures presented two forms of 
psychometrics, eight presented only one form, and two did not present any psychometric 
information.

Interestingly, 19 of the 37 scales or subscales (51.4%) that assessed anticipated stigma also 
include items that address at least one other stigma mechanism, with internalized stigma and 
experienced stigma co-occurring most often. Additionally, the most cited measures of 
anticipated stigma are primarily measures of experienced stigma that include items that also 
assess anticipated stigma: the SIS (n = 10) and CESQ (n = 16). One recently developed 
measure, the Questionnaire on Anticipated Discrimination (QUAD; Gabbidon et al., 2013), 
is entirely focused on anticipated stigma and appears to be a psychometrically valid and 
promising measure.

In our framework, anticipated stigma is one of the mechanisms specific to PWMI. 
Therefore, one needs to have a mental illness in order to anticipate stigma related to mental 
illness. However, 27.0% (n = 10) scales or subscales identified as assessing anticipated 
stigma were designed to be completed by people who may or may not have mental illness. 
In some of these measures, individuals are asked to report how they think they would feel 
(e.g., If I had a mental illness, I would feel bad about myself) if they were to have a mental 
illness. For PWMI, these items may be capturing aspects of anticipated or internalized 
stigma (or both). For people who do not have mental illness, it is unclear what mechanism is 
being tapped.

Some of these measures assess how they think others would react to them if they had a 
mental illness (e.g., “If I had a mental illness, friends and family would think I am weak”). 
For PWMI, these measures are likely tapping anticipated stigma because they are asking to 
what extent people expect to be the target of stereotyping and discrimination. For people 
who do not have mental illness, these measures are likely tapping perceived stigma—how do 
people think others will react to PWMI.

Internalized Stigma—Of articles in the broader search, 150 (15.7%) include a measure of 
internalized stigma. A total of 29 scales or subscales assess internalized stigma. More than 
one-third (34.5%) of internalized stigma measures also included items that address other 
stigma mechanisms (n = 10), with anticipated stigma co-occurring the most often.

In terms of the psychometric characteristics, eight measures provided information on 
reliability, validity, and dimensionality, and all of them were accompanied by a published 
psychometric evaluation. However, only three measures were categorized as well-
established, and only one of those three had a published psychometric paper (ISMI). Four 
measures provided two psychometric characteristics, five provided only one, and two 
measures did not have any psychometric information provided.

The most cited measure of internalized stigma was the ISMI (90 citations in the broader 
search). The ISMI is a well-cited, validated measure with five subscales: alienation, 
stereotype endorsement, discrimination experiences, social withdrawal, and stigma 
resistance. Scores on the five scales can be summed for a total ISMI score, or the scales can 
be treated individually. However, by generating a total ISMI score, the effect of internalized 
stigma is conflated with other stigma constructs. Importantly, only two of the subscales—
alienation and social withdrawal, assess internalized stigma as conceptualized in the current 
article. For example, while the stereotype endorsement scale addresses internalized stigma, it 
also includes items that reflect endorsement of personal stereotypes. The discrimination 
experiences subscale measures experienced stigma. The stigma resistance scale was intended 
to reflect how much an individual feels they resist internalizing the stigma of mental illness 
(e.g., I can have a good, fulfilling life, despite my mental illness). However, psychometric 
support for the reliability of the scale is quite low, with some researchers finding internal 
consistency reliability estimates as low as 0.15 (Werner, Stein-Shvachman, & Heinik, 2009). 
Others have found support for stigma resistance as a separate construct (Sibitz, Unger, 
Woppmann, Zidek, & Amering 2011). Nevertheless, more than half (n = 50, 55.6%) of the 
articles citing the ISMI include stigma resistance in their analyses.

Recently, the authors of the ISMI reviewed international applications of the ISMI since its 
development (Boyd et al., 2014). There are more than 50 versions of the ISMI in existence. 
It has been translated to multiple languages, and modified for use with specific mental (e.g., 
depression, schizophrenia, eating disorders) and physical health conditions (e.g., epilepsy, 
inflammatory bowel disorder). Reliability and validity for the overall scale and subscales are 
consistently high (with the exception of the stigma resistance subscale). Chang and 
colleagues (2014) recently conducted additional psychometric analyses on the ISMI, 
demonstrating that ISMI shows good internal consistency, test-retest, and concurrent 
validity, as well as measurement invariance across time (again with the exception of the 
stigma resistance subscale).

Perceived Stigma—Perceived stereotypes and discrimination were measured in 200 and 
203 articles (20.9 and 21.2%, respectively) in the broader search, respectively. Of the scales 
and subscales we identified, 19 measured perceived stereotypes, and 22 measured perceived 
discrimination. None of the measures were classified as assessing perceived prejudice. Only 
two of the perceived stigma measures were classified as well-established, and neither of 
those had a published psychometric paper available. Nine measures presented information 
regarding reliability, validity, and dimensionality; seven measures presented two 
psychometric characteristics, five presented one, and three did not present any psychometric 
information.

Link’s (1987) Perceived-Devaluation Discrimination (PDD) measure was the most cited 
measure of both perceived stereotypes and discrimination, and was the second most used 
stigma measure overall (n = 123, 12.9%). The PDD is a well-established measure, having 
been cited over 100 times in the past decade with good internal consistency. However, the 
original PDD has never undergone a full psychometric evaluation.

As a perceived stigma measure, the PDD asks what people think other people feel and act 
towards PWMI. Because the measure is designed to be completed by people both with and 
without mental illness, the items are written more generally, and ask the extent to which 
people agree or disagree about what “most people” believe about PWMI. An important 
benefit of asking people about others’ beliefs is the avoidance of socially desirable 
responding, as participants may feel more comfortable reporting that others view PWMI 
negatively, rather than endorsing those views themselves. Nevertheless, it is important to 
keep in mind that although personal beliefs may be correlated with perceived beliefs, they 
are distinct constructs that differentially impact outcomes for PWMI.

Although we classified the PDD as a measure of perceived stigma, there was variability in 
how the PDD was used. Some authors refer to the PDD as a measure of self- or internalized 
stigma (e.g., Jung and Kim, 2012; Kondrat, 2012; Livingston & Boyd, 2010; Vauth, Kliem, 
Wirtz, & Corrigan, 2007).

The DSS was also a common measure of both of perceived stereotypes and discrimination 
and includes two subscales: personal stigma and perceived stigma. The DSS has been 
adapted for other mental health conditions, including addiction, alcohol use, and generalized 
anxiety. The perceived stigma subscale also asks participants the extent to which they

feel most people discriminate against people with depression.

Study-Created Measures

Study-created measures were used in 239 of the 957 articles (25.0%) for a total of 304 
measures. Measures assessing stereotypes were the most common (n =156, 51.3%), 
followed by personal discrimination (n = 83, 27.3%), personal prejudice (n = 50, 16.5%), 
anticipated stigma (n = 29, n =9.5%), perceived discrimination (n = 26, 8.6%), experienced 
stigma (n = 21, 6.9%), perceived stereotypes (n = 15, 4.9%), internalized stigma (n =14, 
4.6%), and finally, perceived prejudice (n = 6, 2.0%).

General Discussion

In the present article, we present a comprehensive framework for organizing research on the 
mechanisms through which individuals experience mental illness stigma, and apply it to 
evaluate the current state of measurement with respect to those mechanisms. This framework 
– the Mental Illness Stigma Framework – is not meant to replace existing conceptual models 
of stigma mechanisms. Instead, it was designed to capture the most common ways that 
individuals experience stigma, address key aspects of mental illness stigma that are relevant 
to a broad range of mental illnesses, and differentiate between mechanisms that are most 
relevant for people who do not have mental illness—stereotypes, prejudice, and 
discrimination—versus those that are most important for those who do have mental illness—
experienced, anticipated, and internalized stigma. Most importantly, it ties together a 
substantial body of mental illness stigma research through common language and 
terminology, which can guide communication about relevant research findings, inform future 
research efforts, and aid researchers in selecting measures that correspond to the mental 
illness stigma mechanisms in which they are interested.

Current State of Mental Illness Stigma Measurement

The application of the MISF to systematically review mental illness stigma measures 
revealed that a striking number of measures—more than 400—have been used since 2004. 
Notably, more than two thirds of these measures were created for a particular study and had 
not undergone systematic psychometric validation. And yet, this review revealed that there is 
at least one well-validated measure of mental illness stigma for each of the mechanisms in 
the MISF. This begs the question of why researchers continue to create their own measures 
rather than use existing measures. There are several potential explanations. First, the 
complexity and multidimensionality of mental illness stigma likely plays a role. The 
interdisciplinary nature of mental illness stigma research is also likely an important factor, 
with researchers in different disciplines varying in their use of terminology and 
measurement. However, probably one of the biggest reasons for the large number of stigma 
measures is the lack of a unified conceptual framework that provides common terminology 
and definitions for mental illness stigma researchers. The MISF was designed to address this 
limitation by integrating the core mental illness stigma mechanisms that have been examined 
in this literature.

Through the application of the MISF, we were able to determine which stigma mechanisms 
have received the most, and the least, attention in the literature. By far, the most widely 
studied stigma mechanisms were stereotypes and discrimination, which were measured in 
43.5% and 43.1% of the articles we identified, respectively. The research emphasis on 
stereotypes and discrimination parallels international efforts to reduce stigmatizing attitudes 
in the general public. The widespread prevalence of stereotypes and discrimination 
contributes to a cultural context in which individuals with mental illness may come to 
anticipate and experience stigma (Link & Phelan, 2001). Ideally, efforts to reduce and 
eliminate stereotypes and prejudice can create a cultural shift that would ultimately improve 
the lives of PWMI.

Less research exists on anticipated stigma (10% of the 957 articles). Compared to other 
mechanisms in the MISF, there appears to be less consistency in how researchers define and 
assess anticipated stigma. Several anticipated stigma measures we identified required 
participants to take the perspective of someone who has mental illness when (i.e., “If I had a 
mental illness…”). However, it is difficult to determine which stigma construct is being 
assessed when items are written this way. They may be picking up on anticipated, 
internalized, or perceived stigma, or a combination of all of these mechanisms. Because 
anticipated stigma is inherently tied to having a mental illness, it is often appropriate to limit 
the assessment of anticipated stigma to PWMI. However, there may be some research 
questions that benefit from asking individuals who do not have a confirmed mental illness 
these types of questions. For example, there may be assessment contexts in which 
individuals are reluctant to acknowledge mental health problems and therefore limiting the 
sample to those with a priori mental illness may not be feasible. There may also be 
assessment contexts in which it is not possible to limit the sample to PWMI before data 
collection. In such instances, care should be taken in carefully defining the stigma 
mechanisms under study.

Another issue we identified in our review is that many stigma measures assess multiple 
constructs within a single scale or subscale. This was particularly true for anticipated stigma 
and discrimination, where it occurred in more than half of their respective scales. 
Anticipated stigma was often included as a subscale (or part of a subscale) of measures 
addressing internalized or experienced stigma. In fact, we identified only four measures in 
which anticipated stigma was the sole stigma mechanism assessed (QUAD, Pinel’s (1999) 
Stigma Consciousness Scale, Link et al.’s (1991) secrecy scale, and Quinn & Chaudoir's 
(2009) anticipated stigma measure). Similarly, discrimination was the sole mechanism 
measured in in about half of the discrimination scales, with stereotypes most commonly co-
occurring.

Including items that assess multiple constructs within a scale or subscale is not inherently 
problematic if one is interested in capturing a broader conceptualization of stigma. However, 
it is important not to conflate stigma mechanisms by including items that measure multiple 
stigma mechanisms within the same scale or subscale because they may be related to 
important outcomes in different ways. For example, the ISMI scale includes five subscales. 
Although researchers can generate a total ISMI score by summing across all items, some of 
the ISMI scales do not measure internalized stigma (e.g., the stereotype endorsement

subscale addresses stereotypes, and the discrimination experiences subscale measures 
experienced stigma). By generating a total ISMI score, it appears that the effect of 
internalized stigma is conflated with other stigma constructs. We recommend that 
researchers who use the ISMI, or any other measure assessing multiple stigma mechanisms, 
consider the value of using the subscales independently.

The sheer volume of mental illness stigma measures we identified, and in particular, the use 
of unvalidated measures, suggests that we may be close to a saturation point when it comes 
to the development of mental illness stigma measures. Instead of continuing to use 
unvalidated measures in new studies, we suggest that researchers carefully consider the 
stigma mechanism they are interested in examining, and whenever possible, identify a 
preexisting measure that meets their needs. Additionally, research should focus on validating 
some of the more promising measures of mental illness stigma with population(s) for which 
the measure was intended—i.e., those measures that are well-cited but have not yet 
undergone a psychometric evaluation. In cases where researchers would like to focus their 
attention on a specific disorder, there are a number of options. They can use existing 
measures that were designed for broad application to mental illness. The benefit of such an 
approach is that it facilitates future comparisons across disorders using the same measure. 
Another option is to use one of the many well-validated measures developed or adapted for a 
specific disorder. Finally, if needed, researchers can adapt an existing well-validated measure 
to fit their needs, being sure to provide information regarding reliability, validity, and 
dimensionality of their adapted measure.

Directions for Future Research

Our application of the MISF to review stigma measures provides valuable information 
regarding gaps in the mental illness stigma literature. In general, stigma mechanisms that are 
most relevant to the experiences of PWMI—experienced, anticipated, and internalized 
stigma—have been the least studied, and were measured in less than 20% of the studies in 
our review. There is a still a great deal of work to be done to explore these mechanisms and 
their corresponding outcomes for PWMI. For example, research is needed to understand 
relationships between stigma mechanisms, as research on other stigmatized identities (e.g., 
chronic physical illnesses) suggests that experienced and internalized stigma may lead to 
anticipated stigma, which in turn negatively impact healthcare access and overall quality of 
life (Earnshaw & Quinn, 2012). Understanding how PWMI experience stigma through 
mechanisms such as anticipated, internalized, or experienced stigma can also pave the way 
for the development of strategies to resist or reduce stigma. How people who possess a 
socially devalued identity experience these identities can vary greatly (Crocker & Major, 
1989). PWMI may respond to stigmatization with righteous anger (Corrigan & Watson, 
2002), feelings of empowerment (Rusch, Lieb, Bohus, & Corrigan, 2006), or by resisting 
stigma (Sibitz et al., 2011). These responses may impact the wellbeing of PWMI. Although 
research in this area is somewhat limited, the existing evidence suggests that empowerment 
is associated with decreased internalized stigma (Brohan et al., 2010; Sibitz et al., 2011).

Importantly, this review underscores the need for additional longitudinal research to better 
understand how mental illness stigma impacts individuals. The majority of studies we

reviewed were cross-sectional, which necessarily limits their generalizability. The call for 
more longitudinal stigma research is not new. Ten years ago in his review of mental illness 
stigma measures, Link et al. (2004) also encouraged researchers to take prospective view of 
mental illness stigma. Yet, we have not seen a marked increase in longitudinal work in this 
area. Of course, longitudinal research presents its own sets of challenges, namely cost and 
time. But if we want to advance our understanding of mental illness stigma, longitudinal 
studies are essential.

We hope the MISF can be a starting point for other researchers by delineating the most 
common ways in which people experience stigma and providing common terminology that 
can guide measurement selection. We also hope that researchers will be able to build upon 
the MISF to advance our understanding of mental illness stigma. How stigma mechanisms 
influence one another and how individuals respond to stigmatization (i.e., stigma resistance 
or coping) are two important ways in which the MISF could be elaborated upon.

Understanding the multidimensionality of stigma is key to advancing both theory and 
research (Pescosolido & Martin, 2015). An essential future direction for the MISF will be to 
examine the dimensionality of the stigma mechanisms themselves. For example, Quinn, 
Williams, & Weisz (2015) recently argued for a distinction between acute experiences of 
discrimination such as getting fired for having a mental illness, versus “day-to-day” 
discrimination such as being disrespected or avoided due to one’s mental illness. Both of 
these types of behaviors are captured in the discrimination mechanism of the MISF; 
however, different forms of discrimination may differentially impact PWMI. The same may 
be true with respect to other mechanisms in the MISF.

It is also important to acknowledge that our framework is just one way of conceptualizing 
mental illness stigma and there may be other informative conceptualizations. The MISF may 
be used in tandem with other conceptualizations of stigma to move the field forward. For 
example, Pescosolido and Martin (2015) propose a systems-level conceptualization of 
stigma, the stigma complex. Their conceptualization of stigma is based on the Framework 
Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma (FINIS; Pescosolido, Martin, Lang, & 
Olafsdottir, 2008). The FINIS is a broad theoretical model positing that stigma is the result 
of the dynamic interplay of both individual and community level factors. However, unlike 
the MISF, the FINIS does not identify the specific stigma mechanisms that capture the 
different ways in which people experience mental illness stigma. Future stigma researchers 
might examine ways in which these two theoretical frameworks work together to better 
understand how the different components of stigma (at both the individual and community 
level) interact.

Most of the theoretical and empirical work on mental illness stigma has focused on the 
individual level, which is also the emphasis of the MISF. However, future research can build 
upon and expand the MISF to include other important manifestations of stigma, including 
courtesy stigma, structural stigma, and cultural stigma. Courtesy stigma is the stigma 
experienced by people associated with those who possess a devalued identity, and is 
sometimes referred to as stigma-by-association (Goffman, 1963), family stigma (Corrigan 
&Miller 2004; Larson & Corrigan, 2008) or affiliate stigma (Mak & Cheung, 2008). Family

members, friends, caregivers, and service providers may all be the target of stigma (i.e., 
stereotyping, prejudice, or discrimination), or they may experience, anticipate, or internalize 
stigma (Mak & Cheung, 2008) because of their relationship to the stigmatized person. 
Structural stigma occurs when laws, policies, procedures, and cultural norms intentionally or 
unintentionally restrict the opportunities of those individuals who possess a stigmatized 
identity (Corrigan, et al., 2005; Link & Phelan, 2001; Hatzenbuehler & Link, 2014; Pugh, 
Hatzenbuehler, & Link, 2015). Structural stigma focuses on macro-level social forces that 
negatively impact the lives and well-being of PWMI (or any other stigmatized identity). 
Although research on structural stigma as it relates to mental illness is limited, two 
comprehensive reviews describe the state of current research on structural stigma and 
provide suggestions for future research (Livingston, 2013; Pugh et al., 2015). An important 
limitation of existing research on structural stigma is that it tends to be descriptive in nature, 
and consequently, there is a need for research examining the causal relationship between 
structural stigma and outcomes for PWMI (Pugh et al., 2015).

The integration of intersectionality theory may also help to further focus and unite the 
mental illness stigma literature. Intersectionality theory suggests that experiences and 
outcomes of mental illness stigma may be shaped by other characteristics of the stigmatized 
or stigmatizer, including the type of mental illness, treatment engagement, socio-economic 
status, gender, race, and others. For example, at the intersection of gender and mental illness, 
some Latina women living with mental illness define themselves as “good girls” and 
“church ladies” in opposition to stigmatizing labels (e.g., “loca”) (Collins, von Unger, & 
Armbrister, 2008). Identifying with cultural identities that are well-respected is a way of 
resisting the stigma associated with mental illness (Collins et al., 2008). Additionally, some 
work at the intersection of race/ethnicity, culture, and mental illness suggests that there is 
variability in the extent to which different racial and ethnic groups endorse stigmatizing 
beliefs about mental illness, and these differences may be attributed to different socialization 
and cultural values related to mental illness (Abdullah & Brown, 2011; Rao, Fienglass, & 
Corrigan, 2007; Whaley, 1997). Understanding how race and ethnicity impact people’s 
conceptualizations and experiences of mental illness stigma has important implications for 
individuals’ overall health and well-being, especially because racial and ethnic minorities 
are more likely to have unmet mental healthcare needs (Wang et al., 2007).

Finally, it is important to recognize culture as a lens through which we can better understand 
how stigma impacts individuals (Yang et al., 2007). The extent to which culture has been 
incorporated into measurements of stigma was recently examined in a measure review by 
Yang and colleagues (2014). The majority of cultural measures they identified involved 
adapting an existing measure to a specific culture, with very few measures being developed 
specifically for a particular culture. Yang et al. (2014) call for the development of culture-
specific stigma measures, as they may have stronger predictive value over generic measures. 
Importantly, such measures should consider the cultural values that matter the most and 
therefore threaten people’s ability to successfully function in their social worlds (Yang et al., 
2007).

Mental Illness Treatment Stigma

One area of mental illness stigma measurement that we excluded from our review was 
treatment stigma. There is a substantial body of literature examining the stigma associated 
with seeking treatment or help for mental health problems, and a number of treatment stigma 
scales have also been developed (e.g., Elhai, Schweinle, & Anderson, 2008; Skopp et al., 
2012; Vogel, Wade, & Haake, 2006; Vogt et al., 2014). Some researchers treat mental illness 
stigma and treatment stigma as synonymously, including treatment and help-seeking items 
among other items assessing mental illness stigma. Others view treatment-seeking as a 
behavioral cue that identifies someone as mentally ill. Because mental illness can be 
concealed, seeking treatment may signal to others that the individual has a mental illness, 
and these individuals may become the target of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.

A study conducted by Tucker and colleagues (2013) demonstrated that the internalized 
stigma of seeking treatment and the internalized stigma of mental illness are distinct 
constructs (they refer to these constructs as self-stigma of treatment and mental illness, 
respectively). Further, they each uniquely predicted outcomes such as shame, self-blame, 
social inadequacy, and help-seeking. Understanding the differences between the two 
constructs may have important implications for designing stigma interventions. For example, 
interventions targeting mental illness stigma mechanisms might focus on changing 
stereotypes of PWMI, or reducing internalized stigma (Lucksted et al., 2011). Interventions 
targeting treatment stigma might focus on negative beliefs about the efficacy of therapies 
and medications (Schomerus & Angermeyer, 2008), or challenging the belief that seeking 
treatment makes one weak.

Given the evidence supporting the distinction between treatment stigma and mental illness 
stigma, researchers should avoid conflating the two constructs in their conceptualization and 
measurement of mental illness stigma. Additional research is needed to fully understand the 
similarities and differences between these constructs, and how they work together to impact 
individuals with mental illness. For example, it is possible that treatment stigma may serve 
as a mediator between mental illness stigma and treatment-related outcomes. As previously 
mentioned, seeking treatment may also serve as a moderator of mental illness stigma 
mechanisms, affecting how PWMI experience mental illness stigma.

Conclusions

In their 2004 review of stigma measures, Link et al. proposed six questions that researchers 
should consider when selecting measures of stigma: (1) What is the research question, and 
what are the variables one must measure to answer the question posed? (2) Is there an 
existing measure available, (3) Is it suitable for the population under examination (or can it 
be modified to make it appropriate)? (4) Is the measure appropriate to the study 
methodology in use? (5) Is the measure reliable and valid, and could social desirability 
influence responses to the measure? (6) Is the administration of the measure feasible for 
participants? Despite the inherent wisdom of this guidance, there has been a proliferation in 
use of both validated and unvalidated mental illness stigma measures over the past 10 years, 
with little signs of slowing down. The field of mental illness stigma research has reached a 
point where there needs to be convergence across researchers with respect to both

terminology and measurement to move forward. We believe the MISF can help researchers 
articulate their constructs of interest with shared terminology, and that our review of mental 
illness stigma measures can help researchers identify validated scales that can be used to 
study those constructs.

One of the most important implications of the MISF and our review of the field’s 
measurement of mental illness stigma is its potential to inform stigma reduction 
interventions. As Bos et al. (2013) note, many stigma interventions lack a theoretical 
foundation and sound methodology. They recommend that stigma reduction interventions 
identify and target specific stigma mechanisms and use measures that correspond to those 
mechanisms. The MISF and our review of measures can help researchers do exactly that. We 
hope that the next decade of mental illness stigma research is characterized by a greater 
synthesis of existing and newly discovered knowledge, and that researchers leverage that 
knowledge to reduce stigma and ultimately, improve the lives of those who experience 
mental illness.
