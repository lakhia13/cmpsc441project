Abstract: Coping Power (CP) is an evidence-based preventive intervention for youth with disruptive
behavior problems. This study examined whether Mindful Coping Power (MCP), a novel adaptation
which integrates mindfulness into CP, enhances program effects on children’s reactive aggression
and self-regulation. A pilot randomized design was utilized to estimate the effect sizes for MCP
versus CP in a sample of 102 child participants (ﬁfth grade students, predominantly low-middle
income, 87% Black). MCP produced signiﬁcantly greater improvement in children’s self-reported
dysregulation (emotional, behavioral, cognitive) than CP, including children’s perceived anger
modulation. Small to moderate effects favoring MCP were also observed for improvements in
child-reported inhibitory control and breath awareness and parent-reported child attentional capacity
and social skills. MCP did not yield a differential effect on teacher-rated reactive aggression. CP
produced a stronger effect than MCP on parent-reported externalizing behavior problems. Although
MCP did not enhance program effects on children’s reactive aggression as expected, it did have
enhancing effects on children’s internal, embodied experiences (self-regulation, anger modulation,
breath awareness). Future studies are needed to compare MCP and CP in a large scale, controlled
efﬁcacy trial and to examine whether MCP-produced improvements in children’s internal experiences
lead to improvements in their observable behavior over time.

1. Introduction

Coping Power (CP) is an evidence-based preventive intervention for preadolescent
children with disruptive behavior problems [1]. Thirteen randomized controlled trials have
shown that CP has beneﬁcial effects for children exhibiting elevated levels of aggressive
behavior, producing lower rates of children’s substance use, aggression, and delinquency
in later adolescence compared to children in control groups, and in improving children’s
social competence and academic functioning (for review, see [1]). Based on a contextual
social-cognitive model of risk for aggression and substance use, CP targets mediating child
(social cognition, anger coping) and family (parenting) processes [2]. CP’s preventive effects
on delinquent behavior and substance use are evident four years after intervention [3].

1.1. Reactive Aggression

Despite its strong evidence base, CP’s effects have been more mixed on reactive ag-
gression than on proactive aggression. Coping Power had effects on reactive aggression at
a three-year follow-up [4], but only had effects on reactive aggression at immediate post-
intervention in one of two studies [5,6]. In contrast, Coping Power had signiﬁcant effects
on proactive aggression at both follow-up and immediate post-intervention in these three
studies. Reactive aggression is one of two key pathways linking aggression and substance
use [7]. Proactive aggression is instrumental, cold-blooded, and unprovoked, whereas reac-
tive aggression is emotionally-driven, impulsive, and hot-blooded [8]. Although children
can manifest both forms, factor analytic work consistently ﬁnds proactive and reactive
aggression to be independent dimensions [9], with unique genetic [10], physiological [11],
and social-cognitive processes [12,13]. Proactive and reactive aggression are both important
predictors of children’s later substance use and delinquency [14]. The current study was
undertaken to maximize CP’s effects on reactive aggression.

Key characteristics that link reactive aggression and substance use include impulsivity
and negative emotionality [15,16]. Youths with high levels of reactive aggression may cope
with negative emotionality by self-medicating, consistent with research linking tempera-
mental anger to alcohol use initiation [17]. Reactive aggression is also impulsive in nature,
and impulsivity has been associated with substance use [15,16]. The current study sought
to enhance the effects of CP by targeting the active mechanisms of reactive aggression.

1.2. Active Mechanisms of Reactive Aggression

Anger arousal and emotional dysregulation. A central mechanism in reactive ag-
gression is emotional dysregulation [18]. Children with reactive aggression experience
high levels of anger [19,20], intense emotional arousal [13,21], and negative emotional-
ity [19,22]. Children high on reactive aggression (but not proactive aggression) evidence
greater electrodermal reactivity in response to an experimental anger induction task [11].
Impulsivity and behavioral dysregulation. Children high on reactive aggression
exhibit deﬁcits in behavioral regulation, particularly poor impulse control (e.g., [19]).
When they perceive the slightest threat, they lack behavioral inhibition and respond with
angry outbursts and aggression [13,23]. Impulsivity is a symptom of attention-deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reactive aggression is more strongly associated with
ADHD than proactive aggression [24].

Rumination, perceived threat, and cognitive dysregulation. In ambiguous situa-
tions, reactively aggressive children perceive that others have hostile intentions, which
leads to angry responses to perceived provocations or threats [9,25]. Anger rumination has
been found to be positively associated with reactive aggression in college students [26].
Reactively aggressive children may ruminate about perceived threats and anger-arousing
events, which compromises their ability to override tendencies toward aggressive behavior.
In an overview of research with adults, this ruminative cognitive style was found to exac-
erbate anger arousal and create a state of readiness for reactive aggression [27]. Reactive
aggression is also linked with deﬁcits in executive function [28].

Attentional capacity. Children high on reactive aggression often exhibit attention
difﬁculties, as reﬂected by the higher rates of ADHD in children exhibiting reactive aggres-
sion [24]. They also have difﬁculty accurately encoding social cues and recall fewer details
of a social situation [29]. Consequently, reactively aggressive children may miss critical
information that informs their responses to others. In addition, their attention is selective
and biased, and focuses on negative interactions such as rejection, ridicule, and failure [30].

1.3. Rationale for Mindful Coping Power

Improving these active mechanisms is expected to reduce children’s reactive aggres-
sion and improve their prosocial behavior. In turn, these improvements are expected to
disrupt the pathway from reactive aggression to peer rejection, peer delinquency, and
substance use. The Mindful Coping Power program (MCP) was developed to maximize

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

3 of 20

program effects on children’s reactive aggression and its active mechanisms, with the
overarching aim of altering this developmental cascade. Mindfulness is the practice of
bringing non-judgmental awareness to the present moment [31]. Mindfulness training
was selected to enhance the existing CP program due to the demonstrated beneﬁts of
mindfulness on the active mechanisms of reactive aggression, as described below.

Effects of mindfulness on anger arousal and emotion regulation. Mindfulness is
associated with improved emotion regulation and decreased aggressive anger expression in
adults [32], college students [33], and children [34]. Brain imaging research with adults and
college students indicates that mindfulness training yields improvements in brain regions
associated with emotion regulation [35,36]. In studies with youths, mindfulness training
has been found to decrease emotional arousal and increase self-efﬁcacy in emotional
regulation [34,37].

Effects of mindfulness on impulse control and behavioral regulation. Mindfulness
training has been found to improve both impulsivity and aggressive behavior in youths
with classroom behavior difﬁculties [38]. A mindfulness-based school program led to im-
provements in children’s prosocial behavior, aggression, and peer acceptance [39]. Children
with ADHD [40,41], children with co-existing ADHD and oppositional deﬁant disorder [42],
and adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders [43] exhibit behavioral improvements
following mindfulness training, including reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity.

Effects of mindfulness on rumination and cognitive regulation. Mindfulness train-
ing has demonstrated beneﬁts for several aspects of cognitive regulation. It decreases
rumination in adolescents [43,44]. In an electroencephalogram study, mindfulness was
inversely associated with rumination [45]. The non-judgment component of mindfulness
training appears to be relevant for the negative relation between mindfulness and rumina-
tion in research with adult participants [46]. Mindfulness training also improves cognitive
ﬂexibility with adults [35,47], and with children when implemented in school settings [39].
Effects of mindfulness on attention regulation. Prior adult studies have shown
beneﬁts of mindfulness training on attention (e.g., [48]), including intensive [49] and
shorter-term [33] meditation training. Mindfulness improves electrophysiological markers
of attentional control [50] and functional connectivity in brain regions important to atten-
tion [51] for adults. Important to the current study, Schonert-Reichl and colleagues [39]
found that a mindfulness-based school program had positive effects on several behavioral
measures of children’s attention and executive function. Further, in two studies of children
with ADHD, mindfulness training improved children’s attention [41,42].

School-based mindfulness intervention. Although schools can represent an optimal
setting for providing mindfulness intervention to a broad range of children, concerns have
been raised that the implementation of mindfulness-based interventions is proceeding
faster than the current evidence base for school-based implementation documents [52–54].
Reviews of the rapidly growing research literature on school-based mindfulness interven-
tions indicate promising effects on attention control, coping with stressors, and, in some
cases, on anxiety, but there have been noted concerns about study quality and implementa-
tion acceptability (e.g., [55,56]). A systematic review of school-based mindfulness studies
concluded that there was insufﬁcient attention to intervention integrity and to feasibility
of mindfulness of interventions in school settings [53]. In sum, there is a research base
indicating that mindfulness training can lead to improvements in the active mechanisms
for reactive aggression in children. The present study was the ﬁrst to test a school-based
mindfulness enhancement of an existing, evidence-based preventive intervention with
children with high levels of reactive aggression, with special attention to intervention in-
tegrity and to the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention according to intervention
providers, children, and parents.

1.4. Current Study

The current study examined whether optimizing CP by infusing it with mindfulness
enhances program effects over and above standard CP on children’s reactive aggression

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

and its active mechanisms. A randomized comparative effectiveness trial design [57] was
employed to test a previously established “best practice” (CP) against a novel intervention
(MCP). The primary study aim was to estimate effect sizes comparing MCP and CP, in
preparation for a large-scale efﬁcacy trial. The study had the following a priori hypotheses:
(1) MCP will yield greater decreases in children’s reactive aggression than CP; (2) MCP
will yield stronger effects than CP on the active mechanisms of reactive aggression, in-
cluding: decreased child anger arousal and emotional reactivity, increased impulse control
and behavioral regulation, decreased anger rumination and cognitive dysregulation, and
increased child attentional capacity; (3) MCP will yield greater improvements in children’s
social skills than CP, including increased prosocial behavior and decreased externalizing
behavior problems.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

Participating schools. Five elementary schools from a public-school system in urban
and suburban areas in Alabama were recruited to participate in this study. All schools
agreed to participate. The ﬁve participating schools varied on sociodemographic measures,
including percent of children from economically disadvantaged households (which ranged
from 76% to 32%) and child race (Black or African American was most prevalent and
ranged from 92% to 32%). Random assignment to condition occurred within school to
control for sociodemographic variation.

Child and parent participants. This study included a sample of 102 children with
elevated levels of reactive aggression, and their parents and teachers. This sample size was
selected because it was the maximal number of participants who could be assessed and
treated within the project’s grant budget as a pilot and feasibility trial. Power to detect
statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two active interventions was limited. A
priori power estimates ranged from 0.21 to 0.62 for small (0.2) to moderate (0.4) effects.
This sample size was adequate for the primary aim of estimating the comparative effects of
MCP and CP in preparation for a large-scale prevention trial.

Child participants were identiﬁed at the end of fourth grade and participated in
the intervention during ﬁfth grade. CP was designed to provide skills-training prior to
the middle school transition, when risk for substance use initiation increases (e.g., [58]).
To identify children with elevated levels of reactive aggression, fourth grade teachers
completed the 3-item reactive aggression scale from the Teacher Report of Reactive and
Proactive Aggression [8] on all students in their classroom. Detailed information about this
measure is provided below. Screening occurred at the end of fourth grade when teachers
were very familiar with children’s behavior. This also allowed families to be recruited and
assessed near the start of ﬁfth grade.

Ratings were compiled across the participating schools to identify an empirical cut-off
score reﬂecting the top quartile of fourth grade students on reactive aggression. A cut-off
score of 8 was used. This is consistent with prior studies of CP, in which children with
teacher-rated reactive aggression above 8.5 had parent-rated externalizing problems in the
at-risk or clinical range on the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children [59]. Thus, teacher
screener scores at or above this level are indicative of a child’s risk status from both teacher
and parent perspectives [60,61]. Parent participants were the primary caregiver(s) of each
child enrolled in the study.

A total of 638 fourth grade students were screened for study participation. Of those,
428 scored below the empirical cut-off for teacher-rated reactive aggression. One child
with an eligible screener score was excluded due to a language barrier that could not be
addressed with local resources. The remaining families were contacted in random order
until the total number of intervention slots at each school had been ﬁlled. Six families
declined study participation (the most common reasons were that the child already received
services elsewhere, or lack of perceived need). These children did not signiﬁcantly differ on
baseline characteristics from those enrolled. One hundred and eight children were initially

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

5 of 20

enrolled in the study. Five of these children moved to different schools prior to starting
ﬁfth grade. The remaining 103 participants were randomly assigned to MCP or CP in
yoked pairs, as described below. One child withdrew from the study after participating in
one session (due to perceived lack of need and social concerns), which resulted in a total
sample of 102 child participants, as well as their parents and teachers. Participants were
recruited in two annual cohorts (n = 44 in Cohort 1 and n = 58 in Cohort 2).

Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the study sample. Sixty-one
percent of the recruited children were male (n = 62) and 39% (n = 40) were female. Child
age ranged from 9 to 11 (M = 9.97, SD = 0.48). The parent-reported racial composition
of the sample was 87.3% Black or African American (n = 89), 5.9% White or Caucasian
(n = 6), 3.9% more than one race (n = 4), and 2.9% Unknown or not reported (n = 3). At
one of the ﬁve schools, the percent of Black or African American children enrolled in the
study (70%) was signiﬁcantly higher than the percent in ﬁfth grade at that school (32%).
For family income, 33.4% of parents reported an annual household income of less than
USD 15,000, 29.4% reported USD 15,000 to USD 29,999, 21.5% reported USD 30,000 to USD
49,999, 13.8% reported annual family income of more than USD 50,000, and 1.9% did not
provide information about annual family income.

Teachers. Children’s fourth grade teachers provided initial child behavioral screening
data. Children’s ﬁfth grade teachers completed pre- and post-intervention assessments
regarding children’s academic and behavioral functioning. The pre-intervention assessment
occurred at least four to six weeks after the beginning of ﬁfth grade, to allow time for
teachers to get to know the children well. The post-intervention assessment occurred at the

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

6 of 20

end of ﬁfth grade, after the intervention was complete. Teachers were blind to intervention
condition (CP or MCP). They only knew that speciﬁc children were participating in one of
two Coping Power groups being offered at their school (e.g., the Wednesday group or the
Friday group). The only other overt difference was that yoga mats were used in MCP but
not CP. The yoga mats were stored in a separate meeting room throughout the year, then
given to children to keep after all intervention and assessments had been completed. It is
possible that children in MCP discussed some of the unique program elements (e.g., yoga
stretches, mindfulness practices) with their teachers, but this was not directly evaluated.
Coping Power leaders. There were ﬁve primary group leaders. Each implemented
both versions of the intervention (MCP and CP). These leaders were doctoral (n = 2) or
master’s (n = 3) level clinicians with considerable experience implementing Coping Power
(three of the ﬁve were licensed clinicians, each with more than twelve years of experience
running CP groups; two were advanced doctoral students with prior experience leading
or co-leading CP groups). Four of the leaders were female and one male. Four of the
leaders were Caucasian and one identiﬁed as more than one race. All of the primary
leaders completed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training prior to the start of the
study. They also committed to maintaining a regular mindfulness practice of at least
ten minutes a day throughout the study and participated in weekly group supervision
meetings that included group mindfulness practice and discussion. Master’s and advanced
undergraduate students served as group co-leaders, to provide additional group oversight
and behavior support. These co-leaders participated in CP and mindfulness training
workshops prior to program implementation and committed to maintaining a regular
personal mindfulness practice.

2.2. Procedure

The University of Alabama Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures

and conducted continuing review throughout study administration.

Random assignment to condition. Children with scores of 8 or higher on the teacher-
rated reactive aggression screener items were considered eligible for participation. The
participating schools varied in the number of children who fell within the eligible range.
A random calling order was created for eligible children from each school and families
were contacted according to their placement on this list until twelve children were enrolled
at each school. Once recruited into the study, children were randomly assigned to one
of the two active conditions: CP (n = 50) or MCP (n = 52). Random assignment occurred
within each school. Yoked pairs of students with similar reactive aggression scores and
demographic characteristics (i.e., gender and race) were randomly assigned to either the CP
or MCP group at that school. The CP and MCP groups were equivalent on teacher-reported
reactive aggression at the end of fourth grade (as shown in Table 1).

Pre-intervention data (Time 1) were gathered from parents and children near the
start of ﬁfth grade and from teachers four to six weeks into the school year. This allowed
time to enroll participants while ﬁfth grade teachers were becoming familiar with the
children’s behavior (beyond any honeymoon period). The intervention began after all Time
1 assessments were completed. Post-intervention data (Time 2) were collected from teachers
in late spring of ﬁfth grade and from parents and children in late spring-early summer after
ﬁfth grade. Research staff members who administered the parent and child assessments
were blind to condition. Teachers received USD 10 for each child assessed. Parents received
USD 50 and child participants received USD 10 at each assessment time point.

Intervention. Two active preventive interventions were compared in this study. CP
and MCP both included the same number of sessions (25 child group sessions, 10 parent
group sessions) and utilized curriculum manuals with speciﬁc objectives for each session.
Child group sessions were conducted in a private meeting space during the regular school
day and lasted approximately 45 min each. Parent group sessions were held in the morn-
ing or evening (both options were offered in each condition) in a location central to the
participating schools. Parent group sessions lasted 1–1 1
2 hours each. Sessions were spaced

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

7 of 20

to provide the content in one school year (about 7–8 months). Child groups met weekly
and parent groups met 1–2 times per month.

Coping Power. CP is an evidence-based preventive intervention for youths with
or at risk for disruptive behavior disorders [1]. CP draws upon a cognitive-behavioral
framework to teach children social and emotional coping skills and to teach parents positive
parenting and self-care skills. Topics covered in the child program include: personal goal
setting, identiﬁcation of feelings, coping with anger, perspective-taking, problem-solving,
afﬁliating with prosocial peers, and resisting peer pressure. Topics covered in the parent
program include: supporting children’s academic learning, strengthening the parent–child
relationship and family cohesion, managing the stress of parenting, setting household rules
and expectations, praise, ignoring, effective discipline techniques, family problem-solving,
and planning for the future.

Mindful Coping Power. MCP is a novel adaptation of CP in which mindfulness
practices were integrated with the existing cognitive-behavioral elements. All of the core
content from the CP child and parent components was retained in MCP. Mindfulness
practices were integrated into CP in three ways: (a) mindfulness-only sessions (several
sessions were added to the MCP child and parent programs to introduce mindfulness
theory and practice); (b) mindfulness in every session (each MCP child and parent session
began and ended with a series of mindfulness practices, including the ringing of a chime,
a breath awareness practice, yoga poses, and a compassion practice); (c) integration of
mindfulness into existing Coping Power activities (e.g., an existing component on iden-
tifying early physiological cues of anger was enhanced through regular body awareness
practices; compassion practices informed activities designed to help children and parents
see situations from others’ perspectives; thought awareness practices helped children and
parents allow angry thoughts to ‘pass on by’ rather than clinging to them as facts). For
further detail about the integration of mindfulness into CP, including the comprehensive
theoretical model for MCP and sample sessions highlighting the differences between MCP
and CP, see Miller and colleagues [62].

Every child and parent intervention session (CP and MCP) was video recorded. Group
leaders received monthly individualized feedback as well as weekly group supervision
from the principal investigators. To ensure high ﬁdelity to the new program elements,
leaders received feedback on every mindfulness-only session held. Leaders were trained
to ensure that they did not incorporate mindfulness-speciﬁc language or practices into
CP sessions. CP did not have any intervention content that was not also in MCP. Effort
was made to keep the length of sessions consistent across the two conditions. Due to
the added mindfulness practices in MCP, leaders were able to spend more time on some
program elements during CP sessions than MCP sessions (e.g., reviewing progress toward
weekly personal goals and setting new goals; personal sharing related to intervention
topics; opportunities to practice new skills in session; summarizing key points at the end of
sessions). There were a total of 18 unique child groups (9 MCP, 9 CP) and 8 unique parent
groups (4 MCP, 4 CP). Four schools participated in Cohort 1 and a ﬁfth school was added
for Cohort 2. The same leader ran both the MCP and CP groups at each school each year.

2.3. Measures

Teacher Report of Reactive and Proactive Aggression (TRRPA) [8]. To identify stu-
dents with moderate to high levels of reactive aggression, fourth grade teachers completed
the 6-item TRRPA for all of the children in their class. This instrument consisted of three
items assessing reactive aggression (“overreacts angrily to accidents,” “strikes back when
teased,” and “blames others in ﬁghts”) and three items assessing proactive aggression
(“gets others to gang up on a peer,” “uses physical force to dominate,” and “threatens and
bullies others”). Each item was rated on a 5-point scale (1 = Never to 5 = Almost Always).
Children’s scores on the 3-item teacher-reported reactive aggression scale were used to de-
termine study eligibility (scores can range from 3 to 15, with higher scores reﬂecting greater
reactive aggression). Teachers also completed this measure pre- and post-intervention

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

8 of 20

to assess for change. In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha for teacher-rated reactive
aggression was 0.91.

Abbreviated Dysregulation Inventory (ADI) [63]. The 31-item ADI includes three
subscales: affective dysregulation (arousability, weak emotional control, and irritability);
behavioral dysregulation (impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity); cognitive dysregula-
tion (poor problem-solving and planning, inability to learn from experience, and cognitive
inﬂexibility). Students rated how true each statement was in the past month on a Likert-
type scale from 1 (never true) to 4 (always true). Total dysregulation was calculated by
averaging the scores for all three subscales, with higher scores reﬂecting greater overall
dysregulation. Five of the affective dysregulation items comprise the Anger Scale (e.g., “I
have trouble controlling my temper,” “when I am angry I lose control over my actions,”
“I get so frustrated that I often feel like a bomb ready to explode), with higher scores
indicating greater difﬁculty regulating anger. This well-established instrument has been
used with children and adults and is used to assess risk for substance use disorders. In
the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.81 for total dysregulation and 0.74 for the
anger scale.

Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire (EATQ) [64]. The EATQ is a self-
report measure that assesses various aspects of adolescent temperament [64]. The inhibitory
control subscale of the EATQ was administered as a child self-report measure of behavioral
self-regulation. This subscale consists of ﬁve items (e.g., “when someone tells me to stop
doing something, it is easy for me to stop”). Higher mean scores reﬂect a greater capacity
to plan and suppress inappropriate responses. Cronbach’s alpha for the EATQ inhibitory
control subscale was 0.63 in the current sample. The attention subscale of the EATQ-
Revised Parent Report (EATQ-R) [65] was administered as a parent-report measure of
children’s attentional capacity. This subscale consists of six items (e.g., “my child ﬁnds it
really easy to concentrate on a problem,” “my child is good at keeping track of several
different things that are happening around him/her”). Higher mean scores reﬂect better
child attentional capacity. Cronbach’s alpha for the EATQ-R attention subscale was 0.73 in
the current sample.

Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) [59]. Child externalizing behavior
problems and social skills were assessed using the Parent Rating Scale (PRS) and Teacher
Rating Scale (TRS) of the BASC. Items of the PRS and TRS were rated on a 4-point scale
(e.g., “Mean to others,” “Sudden changes in mood or feelings”; 0 = Never to 3 = Almost
Always). The child version (appropriate for ages 6–11) was used for both the TRS and PRS.
Teachers and parents completed the BASC at pre- and post-intervention time points.

Program effects on children’s aggressive and disruptive behavior were measured
using the externalizing problems composite, which consists of subscales measuring aggres-
sion, conduct problems, and hyperactivity. Higher composite scores reﬂect worse child
externalizing problems. Cronbach’s alpha for the externalizing problems scale was 0.89
for the PRS and 0.96 for the TRS in the current sample. The social skills subscale was also
included as a measure of program effects on children’s prosocial behavior. Sample items
include “offers to help others,” “shows interest in others’ ideas,” and “tries to bring out
the best in others.” Higher scores reﬂect better child social skills. Cronbach’s alpha for the
social skills subscale was 0.89 for the PRS and 0.92 for the TRS. Parent and teacher reports
of children’s externalizing behavior problems (r = 0.34) and social skills (r = 0.20) were
signiﬁcantly correlated but represent unique perspectives, thus were considered separately
in analyses.

Scale of Body Connection (SBC) [66]. Breath awareness was examined as a measure
of mindfulness. Four items assessing children’s breath awareness were adapted based
on the SBC [61], which includes a range of items measuring body awareness and bodily
dissociation. Items were rated on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (all of the time) Likert scale. Sample
items included “I can feel my breath travel through my body” and “I notice how my breath
changes when I am tense or nervous.” Higher mean scores reﬂect greater child awareness

of their breath. Cronbach’s alpha for the breath awareness scale in the current sample
was 0.65.

Program Implementation. Child and parent group leaders documented program im-
plementation in several ways. For each CP and MCP session, they documented participant
attendance, level of engagement, and completion of in- and out-of-session activities. They
also documented the duration of each session and completion of the planned objectives.
Supervisors also rated leaders’ implementation ﬁdelity and quality using program-speciﬁc
measures (assessing completion of planned program objectives and constructs such as: abil-
ity to engage participants in the intervention, effective instructional style, and consistency
with guiding theoretical principles).

Program Feasibility, Acceptability, and Impact. Participants provided feedback on
MCP and CP acceptability and impact after every 5 child group sessions and every 2 par-
ent group sessions, and provided overall feedback at post-intervention. Group leaders
provided feedback on the feasibility and impact of each MCP and CP session and overall
feedback at post-intervention.

2.4. Data Analyses

Latent Change Score (LCS) analyses were conducted to compare CP and MCP in-
tervention effects on the primary child outcome measures. LCS is a structural equation
model (SEM) that can be used to ﬁt the paired t-test model in a way that is more ﬂexi-
ble than the usual paired t-test [67]. For the current data, this allowed multiple group
t-tests to be ﬁt and to examine whether there were pre–post outcome changes within the
standard and mindful Coping Power groups, and whether the amount of change differed
between the CP and MCP groups (this can be seen as an SEM implementation of the
difference-in-differences estimator).

The multiple group latent change scores were ﬁt using the lavaan [68] R package [69].
Models were ﬁt such that pre-test values predicted the latent change score, which allows for
the likely possibility of imperfect test-retest reliability [67]. The LCS approach also has better
missing data handling than the paired t-test since it assumes data are missing at random
(MAR) conditional on other variables in the model instead of the missing completely at
random (MCAR) assumption made by the t-test, which excludes all participants with
any missing data. For a review of these missing data concepts, see Enders [70]. Full
information maximum likelihood estimation was used to address missing data so that all
participants were retained in the analyses. All participants with an observation for at least
one time point are retained. At pre-intervention, 1 of 52 MCP participants and 1 of 50 CP
participants were missing data on variable(s) of interest. At post-intervention, 3 MCP
and 8 CP participants were missing data on variable(s) of interest. Before conducting LCS
analyses, t-tests were run to compare MCP and CP for baseline equivalence on each of the
primary child outcome measures. The distribution of scores on each measure was also
examined for skewness and kurtosis.

The focus of the analyses was on estimating effect sizes in MCP and CP to inform
power analyses for a future, large-scale efﬁcacy trial. It was expected that preliminary
support for MCP would be evidenced by at least small to moderate effect sizes relative to
CP on the primary outcomes (d = 0.2 or larger), which would warrant further evaluation of
MCP in a large-scale efﬁcacy trial.

3. Results

LCS analyses compared the effects of the new MCP preventive intervention to the
effects of the existing, evidence-based CP program on reactive aggression and its active
mechanisms. Table 2 summarizes the ﬁndings observed. Results are presented by informant
group, with a focus on the effect size estimates observed.

3.1. Child Self-Report Outcomes

Children in MCP exhibited a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in total dysregulation
on the ADI compared to children in CP, yielding a moderate–large effect size (Cohen’s
d = −0.76, 95% CI [−1.40, −0.10], p = 0.001). Figure 1 depicts this ﬁnding.

Figure 1. Comparative effects of Coping Power and Mindful Coping Power on children’s total
dysregulation (affective, behavioral, cognitive) on the Abbreviated Dysregulation Inventory.

Moderate effect sizes favoring MCP were observed on the affective dysregulation
(Cohen’s d = −0.42, 95% CI [−0.53, −0.003], p = 0.048) and behavioral dysregulation
(Cohen’s d = −0.41, 95% CI [−0.52, 0.001], p = 0.051) subscales of the ADI. A smaller effect
size was observed on the cognitive dysregulation subscale (Cohen’s d = −0.33, 95% CI
[−0.47, 0.04], p = 0.102), also favoring MCP. Only the effect on affective dysregulation was
statistically signiﬁcant in this feasibility sample. Children in MCP exhibited a signiﬁcantly
greater reduction on the ADI Anger Scale than children in CP, yielding a moderate effect
size (Cohen’s d = −0.45, 95% CI [−0.70, −0.03], p = 0.033).

A small to moderate effect size favoring MCP was observed for child-reported in-
hibitory control on the EATQ (Cohen’s d = 0.37, 95% CI [−0.03, 0.58], p = 0.081). This
ﬁnding is depicted in Figure 2. Breath awareness, a measure of child mindfulness, also
yielded a small to moderate effect size favoring MCP (Cohen’s d = 0.31, 95% CI [−0.07, 0.99],
p = 0.090). These effects were not statistically signiﬁcant in this feasibility sample.

3.2. Parent-Report Outcomes

Small to moderate effect sizes favoring MCP were observed for parent-reported im-
provements in child attention on the EATQ (Cohen’s d = 0.32, 95% CI [−0.07, 0.58], p = 0.121)
and children’s social skills on the BASC (Cohen’s d = 0.30, 95% CI [−0.96, 5.79], p = 0.161).
In contrast, there was a small to moderate effect favoring CP for reduction in parent-
reported BASC externalizing problems (Cohen’s d = 0.36, 95% CI [−0.42, 8.25], p = 0.077).
No parent-reported outcome effects were statistically signiﬁcant in this feasibility sample.

3.3. Teacher-Report Outcomes

On teacher-rated child reactive aggression, a key outcome of interest, the difference
between MCP and CP was small and non-signiﬁcant (Cohen’s d = 0.13, 95% CI [−1.17, 1.51],
p = 0.802). Negligible differences between MCP and CP were also observed on the two other
teacher-reported outcomes, child externalizing problems on the BASC (Cohen’s d = −0.04,
95% CI [−5.61, 1.62], p = 0.279) and child social skills on the BASC (Cohen’s d = −0.02,
95% CI [−3.55, 2.04], p = 0.598).

3.4. Implementation Fidelity and Quality

Supervisors who observed video-recorded sessions provided overall ratings of leaders’
implementation ﬁdelity and quality, with scores ranging from 1 (low) to 10 (high). Mean
supervisor-rated effective completion of session objectives was 8.33 (SD = 0.89) for CP and
8.44 (SD = 0.99) for MCP. Mean supervisor-rated effective engagement of participants was
8.67 (SD = 0.89) for CP and 9.00 (SD = 1.78) for MCP. Supervisors also rated MCP leaders’
ability to articulate mindfulness theory clearly and accurately, yielding a mean score of
8.78 (SD = 1.23) and ability to implement mindfulness practices effectively, yielding a mean
score of 8.44 (SD = 1.75).

3.5. School and Leader Effects

Exploratory analyses assessed for school-level effects. No signiﬁcant effects were ob-
served at the school level. Leader effects were on the same level, since random assignment
to condition occurred within schools (i.e., the same leader implemented both the CP and
MCP groups at each school). No signiﬁcant effects at this level were observed.

3.6. Feasibility and Participant Satisfaction

Leaders provided feedback on the comparative feasibility of MCP and CP at post-
intervention. On a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much), the mean score for
how feasible the MCP child program was to implement was 7.29 (SD = 0.76) and the mean
score for how well the leader was able to cover the core skills from standard CP during
MCP child sessions was 7.71 (SD = 1.28). When asked to rate which program was easier to
implement, the mean score was 4.57 (SD = 2.30), on a scale ranging from 0 (CP) to 5 (equal)
to 10 (MCP). The following quote summarizes the most prevalent themes in the leader
feedback regarding the comparative feasibility of MCP versus CP: “CP had fewer topics to
cover in each session, so it was easier to implement in that way. However, as the program
went on, the MCP group became calmer and easier to manage. So, even though there was
more to cover in any given session, it became somewhat easier to implement overall.”

On post-intervention feedback surveys, children rated how helpful the MCP or CP
program was to their life. Children’s mean rating for MCP was 3.5 (SD = 0.7) compared to
3.3 (SD = 1.2) for CP on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much).
Children rated how well they liked being in the program on the same scale, which yielded
a mean score of 3.6 (SD = 0.5) for MCP compared to 3.3 (SD = 1.1) for CP. Some of the
children’s comments about what they liked best about MCP were: “everything,” “it helps
you work on your friendships and stuff,” “MCP helps you with your heart,” “we learn
things that help us take care of our problems,” “the mindful stuff,” “being normal and
calm,” “it helps me handle my feelings,” “PTP and Take 2,” “it teaches you to respond
not react,” and “I liked doing Feel and Spread the Good Vibes.” Some of the children’s
suggested changes to improve MCP were “nothing,” “that we have more time,” “do it
every day,” “to add more people to the group,” “stay longer,” “do more fun stuff,” “the
timing [of group meetings at school],” and “get more points and prizes.”

Without the same time constraints for the parent group meetings, leaders found the
MCP parent group to be equally feasible to implement as CP, with a mean score of 5.00
(SD = 0) on a scale ranging from 0 (CP) to 5 (equal) to 10 (MCP). Leaders reported that it
was very feasible to implement the MCP parent group, with a mean rating of 9.5 out of 10
(SD = 0.58). They also reported that they were readily able to cover the standard CP topics
in the parent MCP group, with a mean of 10.0 (SD = 0).

Parents who participated in MCP parent meetings were very receptive to the program.
The following quotes represent common feedback from parents about the MCP parent
program: “parents and children should participate to learn how to handle situations by
thinking before they react and pay attention to how they cope with different situations;”
“I really enjoyed each session because every session was growth and knowledge about
solving problems effectively, communicating more calmly, and becoming aware of how to
deal with certain situations.” Recommended improvements focused on maintaining the
supportive community, e.g., “we should have a dinner or picnic,” and “we should stay in
touch and keep supporting each other” as well as practical scheduling matters.

4. Discussion

This comparative effectiveness study examined whether MCP leads to greater im-
provements in child reactive aggression and its active mechanisms than CP, with the
primary goal of estimating effect sizes in advance of a large-scale efﬁcacy trial. CP is an
evidence-based preventive intervention for children with disruptive behavior problems.
Thus, the effect-size estimates observed provide valuable information regarding potential

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

14 of 20

enhancing effects of MCP for children with disruptive behavior problems. Findings varied
by informant group, as discussed below.

4.1. Child Self-Report Findings

MCP yielded stronger effects than CP on children’s self-reported total dysregulation
on the ADI, as well as on each of the ADI’s subscales (emotional, behavioral and cognitive
dysregulation). This is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it provides support for the
hypothesis that integrating mindfulness into CP would strengthen program effects on the
active mechanisms of reactive aggression, including anger arousal and emotion regulation,
impulsivity and behavior regulation, and anger rumination and cognitive regulation. This
is also important because past studies have shown that children’s scores on the ADI during
preadolescence account for a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in substance use at
later ages [71]. Given the important role of anger arousal in reactive aggression, scores
on the ADI anger scale were examined separately. Despite limited statistical power in
this feasibility trial, MCP produced signiﬁcantly greater improvements in children’s anger
modulation on the ADI than CP. Improved anger modulation is also expected to contribute
to longer-term beneﬁcial effects across the developmental cascade.

Other child self-report outcomes provided further support for the study hypotheses.
Small to moderate effect sizes favoring MCP were also observed on children’s self-reported
inhibitory control and breath awareness. EATQ inhibitory control was included as a
separate measure of behavioral self-regulation, which is often deﬁcient in children who
exhibit high levels of reactive aggression. Thus, MCP was found to strengthen CP’s effects
across two different child-report measures of inhibitory control, the ADI and EATQ.

Breath awareness was included as a measure of children’s present moment and
embodied mindful awareness. In MCP, there was especially good uptake of a speciﬁc
breath awareness practice called “Press the Pause and Take Two Breaths” (PTP and Take 2).
Once this brief breath awareness practice was introduced, children in MCP were readily
able to recall and practice it on their own. They shared real life situations in which they
noticed a need for a calming, centering activity and opted on their own to practice PTP and
Take 2. Breath-centered meditation practices have many health beneﬁts, which Melnychuk
and colleagues [72] attribute to the coupling of respiration and attention. Speciﬁcally,
focusing on and regulating breathing can optimize attention, and likewise, focusing one’s
attention leads breathing to become more synchronized.

4.2. Parent-Report Findings

Parent-report outcomes yielded mixed results. Small to moderate effect sizes favoring
MCP were observed on two parent-reported outcomes. The ﬁrst was child attention, as
measured on the EATQ. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis that adding mindfulness
to CP would enhance program effects on the active mechanisms of reactive aggression,
including children’s attentional capacity. As described above, reactive aggression is more
strongly associated with attentional difﬁculties than proactive aggression, including the
diagnosis of ADHD [24]. The current ﬁndings indicate that incorporating mindfulness
into CP has a small to moderate enhancing effect on attentional capacity in children with
reactive aggression (based on parent observations). Better present moment awareness and
attentional control may help children encode social cues more accurately and relate better
with others.

A small to moderate effect size favoring MCP was also observed for children’s social
skills, as measured by parent-report on the BASC. Children with reactive aggression
often have both attentional and social difﬁculties, which are interrelated. Children with
reactive aggression have difﬁculty accurately encoding social cues and recall fewer details
of a social situation [29]. Consequently, reactively aggressive children may miss critical
information that informs their responses to others. In addition, their attention is selective
and biased, and focuses on negative interactions such as rejection, ridicule, and failure [30]
and perceived threats. The current ﬁndings indicate that MCP enhances CP’s effects on

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

15 of 20

children’s social skills (based on parent observation). Future research can explore the extent
to which social skill improvements are related to interpersonal skills taught in the program
versus improved attention.

One of the mindfulness enhancements in MCP was the practice of extending compas-
sion to self and others. This practice, Feel and Spread the Good Vibes, was repeated at the
end of every MCP session (and was not included in CP). The addition of repeated com-
passion practices may have contributed to MCP’s enhanced effects on children’s prosocial
behavior. Reactive aggression is linked to substance use through a complex mediational
chain, in which reactive aggression leads to peer rejection, peer rejection leads to peer delin-
quency, and peer delinquency leads to substance use [7]. Improving children’s social skills
may disrupt this trajectory by reducing peer rejection and delinquency. Thus, it is impor-
tant to maximize program effects on children’s social skills and peer acceptance. Long-term
follow-up is needed to assess the impact of MCP across this developmental cascade.

An unexpected ﬁnding was a small to moderate effect size favoring CP for parent-
reported child externalizing problems on the BASC. Although the opposite effect was
hypothesized, there are some possible explanations for this ﬁnding. In an effort to balance
the amount of home practice in MCP and CP, daily home behavior goals were added to CP
(the original CP program only includes school behavior goals). Children in CP set a personal
home behavior goal every week (e.g., complete my chores with a positive attitude, get along
better with my sister, follow directions the ﬁrst time) and earned points for completing these
goals. Many children in CP put considerable effort into accomplishing these home behavior
goals. This may have been a more “active ingredient” than anticipated, contributing to
more observable behavioral improvement at home in CP at post-intervention, relative to
the corresponding home mindfulness practices completed by children in MCP.

The MCP and CP conditions may have also differed (unintentionally) in the amount
of time spent on discussion and practice of cognitive-behavioral skills. MCP was designed
to include all of the same cognitive-behavioral topics as CP, plus additional opening and
closing mindfulness practices. Child session content was planned for 50–60 min; however,
many schools asked for the child groups to be held over lunch, which allowed for sessions
lasting closer to 35–45 min (for both CP and MCP). In MCP, it was important for the
mindfulness practices at the beginning and end of each session to be led in an unhurried
way. This left less time in the middle of some MCP sessions for discussion and practice
of new cognitive-behavioral skills. Leaders reported that they were able to cover all of
the core intervention content in MCP, but had more limited opportunities to discuss and
practice new cognitive-behavioral skills than in CP. It is possible that this diminished MCP
effects on observable child behavioral outcomes. This can be addressed in the future by
holding sessions that last the full 50–60 min (as planned), or by modifying the content to
be offered in a larger number of sessions that meet for 35–45 min each, which may work
better in school settings.

4.3. Teacher-Report Findings

Teacher-report data yielded no effect sizes in the small (d = 0.20) or larger range that
differentiated the outcomes observed in MCP and CP. This included teacher-rated reactive
aggression, which was a primary outcome variable of interest (and the measure upon
which children were screened for the intervention). This also included teacher-rated child
externalizing problems and social skills on the BASC. Thus, the hypothesis that MCP
would enhance the effects of CP on reactive aggression and other teacher-reported child
behavioral outcomes was not supported. Teachers are valuable informants given their
experience interacting with a wide range of children and the frequent opportunities they
have to observe children’s behavior and social interactions throughout the school day.

Of note, children’s teacher-reported BASC externalizing problems worsened from
pre- to post-intervention in both MCP and CP. This may relate to the timing of the pre-
and post-intervention assessments, which were collected near the beginning and end of
the school year, in contrast to the typical format of prior Coping Power studies where

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

16 of 20

the pre-intervention assessment has been collected one spring and post-intervention the
following spring. Teachers may have less information about children’s problems in a
fall assessment. A prior CP adaptation study with the same fall-to-spring assessment
schedule also found that children in both the intervention and control groups had increases
in teacher-rated behavior problems from fall-to-spring. However, the children in CP had
signiﬁcantly less increase in conduct problems than control children [73]. This pattern can
be better examined in study designs with a no-treatment comparison condition, which
the current study did not include. Designs with no-treatment control conditions also help
measure whether preventive interventions attenuate increases in behavioral and academic
problems across the transition to adolescence in at-risk youths, even if they do not lead to
overall net improvements. Although prior research found that CP yielded teacher-rated
behavioral improvement for children in comparison to an untreated randomized control
group, CP did not inﬂuence more trait-like dysregulation scores on the ADI [5]. Thus,
MCP has the potential advantage of producing broader generalized changes in children’s
ability to self-regulate their behavior and affect relative to CP and no treatment. These are
important opportunities for future research.

4.4. Implementation Findings

This study addresses the need for school-based mindfulness studies with rigorous
attention to intervention integrity and to assessing the feasibility of mindfulness inter-
ventions in school settings [53]. A rigorous approach was taken in this study to maintain
intervention integrity and to assess comparative feasibility from multiple stakeholders’
perspectives. The study provides strong support for the feasibility and uptake of the MCP
child and parent programs overall. As described above, modiﬁcations can be made to
the reduce the amount of content in each MCP child session, to better match the school
schedule and improve program feasibility.

4.5. Limitations and Future Research

The current study’s comparative effectiveness design was rigorous in that it compared
two active interventions in a randomized design. CP is a well-established preventive
intervention that has exhibited positive effects in 13 randomized trials, including long-term
follow-up. Thus, improving upon CP’s effects in targeted areas is noteworthy. Given the
feasibility nature of this study, statistical power was only sufﬁcient to detect effects in the
medium to large range. Overall, the current study met its aim of generating effect size
estimates to inform a future large-scale efﬁcacy study comparing MCP and CP.

Participants in the current sample were predominantly Black and low-to-middle
income, reﬂecting the region in which the study was conducted. This is both a strength, in
that this study adds to our understanding of the effects of mindfulness-based interventions
in racially and economically disadvantaged samples, and a limitation, because future
studies are needed to understand the generalizability of this study’s ﬁndings in more
diverse samples. A speciﬁc concern in this study is that there may have been bias in the
teacher behavior ratings used to identify at-risk students, particularly at one school in
which Black/African American students were overrepresented relative to the overall school
population. Screening procedures should account for possible teacher bias, such as by
including a second parent-gate screening.

Future studies would also beneﬁt from collecting long-term follow-up data to exam-
ine whether program beneﬁts are sustained beyond post-intervention and impact later
outcomes in the developmental cascade, including peer delinquency and substance use.
Despite the beneﬁts of MCP on several child-reported outcomes, neither parent- nor
teacher-report outcomes yielded the hypothesized enhancing effects of MCP on child
aggression or externalizing behavior. One explanation for this pattern of results is that it
may take time for the improvements in MCP children’s internal experiences of emotional,
behavioral, and cognitive self-regulation to manifest into improvements in aggression and
externalizing behavior that are clearly discernable to parents and teachers. In the future,

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 1119

17 of 20

it would be beneﬁcial to conduct longer-term follow-up assessments to assess for this. It
would also be valuable to include direct child behavioral assessments to complement child
self-report data.

Since parents were also direct participants in MCP and CP, it will be important to
examine program effects on parent-speciﬁc outcomes. Innovative study designs could
also unpack the relative contributions of various skill-training components included in the
comprehensive MCP and CP interventions for children and parents (i.e., attention training,
compassion training, goal setting, emotional awareness, thought awareness, problem-
solving, assertive communication, mindful parenting, and mindful communication). A
precision medicine approach could be applied to identify speciﬁc subgroups who would
beneﬁt most from speciﬁc skill-training components.

Other important questions in the mindfulness literature are how much practice (fre-
quency, quantity) is needed to yield meaningful beneﬁts, and whether secularized forms of
mindfulness practice (such as those that can be taught within public-school settings) have
as much beneﬁt as traditions in which these practices are couched within a broader lifestyle
and ethic. The overarching principles taught in CP are that everyone experiences difﬁcult
emotions and difﬁcult situations, and it is important to be aware of these experiences and to
practice ways of coping with them that are compassionate toward oneself and others. While
this was consistent across both MCP and CP, the MCP program offered more ﬁrst-person,
in-depth learning opportunities. Future studies can examine whether dosage of practice
(both in and out of sessions) and leader embodiment of mindfulness impact short- and
long-term program effects.

5. Conclusions

This study provides a valuable contribution to the literature by estimating the compar-
ative effects of MCP, a mindfulness-enhanced adaptation of the Coping Power preventive
intervention, to standard CP in a rigorous randomized trial. MCP had the strongest com-
parative effects on child-reported self-regulation and anger modulation, varied effects on
parent-reported outcomes, and minimal effects on teacher-reported outcomes (including
child reactive aggression).
