Abstract

Background—Evidence continues to build for the impact of the marital relationship on health as
well as the negative impact of illness on the partner. Targeting both patient and partner may
enhance the efficacy of psychosocial or behavioral interventions for chronic illness.

Purpose—The purpose of this report is to present a cross-disease review of the characteristics
and findings of studies evaluating couple-oriented interventions for chronic physical illness.

Methods—We conducted a qualitative review of 33 studies and meta-analyses for a subset of 25
studies.

Results—Identified studies focused on cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain,
HIV, and Type 2 diabetes. Couple interventions had significant effects on patient depressive
symptoms (d=0.18, p<0.01, k=20), marital functioning (d=0.17, p<0.01, k=18), and pain (d=0.19,
p<0.01, k=14) and were more efficacious than either patient psychosocial intervention or usual
care.

Conclusions—Couple-oriented interventions have small effects that may be strengthened by
targeting partners’ influence on patient health behaviors and focusing on couples with high illness-
related conflict, low partner support, or low overall marital quality. Directions for future research

In their 2001 literature review, Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton [1] described the empirical
evidence that negative aspects of marital functioning have indirect influences on health
through depression and health habits and direct influences on physiological mechanisms
such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune function. In the past 10 years evidence has
continued to build for the impact of marriage on health and the subsequent implications for
individuals living with chronic illness. For example, marital cohesion or quality has been
linked with outcomes such as better ambulatory blood pressure in hypertension [2] and
better rate of survival over 8 years in congestive heart failure [3], whereas marital strain has
been shown to place women with heart disease at greater risk for recurrent coronary events
over 5 years [4]. Marital confiding predicted decreased mortality over 8 years in women
with Stage II or III breast cancer [5], whereas marital strain was associated with a 46%
increase in risk for mortality over 3 years in end-stage renal disease [6]. Other couple
characteristics with consistent effects on management of chronic illness include marital
conflict, spouse criticism, and lack of congruence between patient and spouse in disease
beliefs and expectations [7].

The negative impact of chronic illness on the well spouse also is now well documented in
the research literature. Spouses often experience poorer psychological well-being, decreased
satisfaction in their relationship with the patient, and burden associated with providing
physical assistance [8]. Spouses’ own physical health and self-care may become
compromised over time [9–12]. Another unfortunate consequence of an ongoing illness is
that spouses’ ability to be supportive may erode over time and their critical or controlling
behaviors may increase [13–15]. These findings have been observed across the most
common chronic conditions affecting adults including heart disease, chronic pain, rheumatic
disease, cancer, and diabetes [16–18].

Awareness of these reciprocal health effects in the marital relationship has led researchers to
develop psychosocial or behavioral interventions that include the spouse. Although patient-
oriented interventions have been shown to improve psychological well-being and symptom
severity for various chronic conditions, the size of observed effects has generally been small
[19–22]. Targeting both the patient and spouse may enhance the efficacy of these
interventions. In comparison to patient-oriented approaches, couple interventions may have
an advantage in long-term maintenance of behavioral changes, and addressing spouses’
concerns may protect against erosion of their support to the patient [23].

The goal of this paper is to review the findings of randomized trials evaluating couple-
oriented interventions for chronic illness. In contrast to previous reviews [24], we take a
cross-disease perspective because the chronic conditions that are leading causes of morbidity
and mortality share the common features of being behaviorally driven, influenced by the
social environment, and negatively impacting the marital relationship. Therefore, couple-

oriented interventions for different conditions share many common features and goals, and
this provides the opportunity to evaluate their efficacy as a group. In order to provide a
detailed overview of work in this area, we describe characteristics of these studies and
summarize statistically significant differences between couple intervention and comparison
groups of either patient intervention or usual care. Because it is important to determine the
impact of the couple-oriented approach regardless of the statistical significance of between-
group differences, we conducted a meta-analysis of three outcomes for which there were an
adequate number of effect sizes for aggregation (i.e., patient depressive symptoms, marital
functioning, and pain).

Method

Identification of Studies

We searched the literature for published evaluations of interventions that focus on chronic
physical illness; are psychologically, socially, or behaviorally oriented; and that involve the
active participation of both the patient and spouse/intimate partner (hereafter referred to as
“partner”). Studies of populations that were at risk but not yet diagnosed with illness, such
as obese individuals and smokers, were excluded. In addition, we excluded studies focused
on conditions affecting cognitive functioning (e.g., dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s disease, traumatic brain injury) because family-oriented psychosocial
interventions for these populations usually target only the individual identified as caregiver.
In order to focus on research that was likely to be methodologically rigorous, we required
that studies used a randomized, controlled design in which participants had an equal chance
of being assigned to couples intervention or comparison group(s). We conducted computer
searches in two databases on the OVID platform: Medline (1950–August 2008) and Psy-
cINFO (1967–August 2008). AutoAlerts for searches run in each database through
December of 2009 updated the authors on any new publications through that date. The
search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles, adults (age 19 and older) and English
language.

Our strategy was to search for a combination of three main concepts: physical diseases,
therapeutics, and dyads. The dyad concept proved to be the most complicated because terms
used for this construct vary widely. Ultimately, the search was broadened to include varied
terms representing the concept (e.g., couples, significant others, couples therapy) and broad
family-related terms (e.g., family, family members, family therapy). The search in
PsycINFO closely followed the search strategy used in Medline; however, allowances were
made for the database idiosyncrasies such as use of Classification Codes which narrows the
search results down to a specific content area in the database (e.g., physical disorders). We
also used the ancestry method of examining references in journals and selected articles to
identify additional studies not retrieved through database searching.

All couple-oriented RCTs were required to meet four criteria to be included. First, studies
had to include the comparison condition of patient-oriented psychosocial intervention,
patient usual medical care, or both. Studies with an attention control condition were
included. Studies comparing only two or more couple-oriented interventions were excluded
because they were not central to the thrust of this paper. Second, we required participation of

a partner for every patient as part of the eligibility criteria (i.e., complete dyads). We
included this criterion because studies enrolling a subgroup of partners may involve
unknown selection effects as a result of not requiring participation from the partner of each
patient. Third, because some studies enrolled a mixture of couples and other dyads, we
required that at least 75% of the sample consisted of patients and their partner. Fourth,
studies had to report psychological, health, or relationship outcomes.

Meta-analytic Procedure

We calculated effect sizes from individual studies using statistics published in the original
reports. We computed Cohen’s d values by subtracting the control group mean from the
intervention group mean and dividing this value by the pooled sample standard deviation. In
cases in which descriptive statistics were not available, we computed d values from
inferential statistics using standard formulas. When a study failed to report relevant statistics
but indicated that groups did not differ with respect to an outcome, we assumed that there
was no difference between the groups (d=0). Because seldom is there no difference at all
between two groups, this process represents a very conservative strategy. We computed
effect sizes from the first available follow-up because there were not enough studies with a
second follow-up to examine the durability of treatment effects. For studies comparing more
than one couple intervention with a comparison group, one effect size was calculated by
averaging across the effect sizes for each comparison.

The Comprehensive Meta-analysis software program [25] was used to aggregate effect size
estimates from individual studies. This program weights each d statistic before aggregation
by multiplying its value by the inverse of its variance; this procedure enables larger studies
to contribute to effect size estimates to a greater extent than smaller ones. We conducted
both fixed effect and random effects meta-analyses. There was little evidence of
heterogeneity across studies for the three patient outcomes that we examined, and the
findings for the fixed effect and mixed effect analyses were very similar. Therefore, we
present findings from the fixed effect models.

We determined whether each aggregate effect size was statistically significant. To examine
whether the studies contributing to each aggregate effect size shared a common population
value, we computed the heterogeneity statistic H [26]. The H is an easily interpretable
measure of heterogeneity within a group of studies and has greater statistical power than the
Q test when the number of studies to be included is small. The indirect treatment meta-
analysis method was used to evaluate the significance of differences in effect sizes based on
the group that was compared to couple intervention (i.e., patient psychosocial intervention or
usual care). Based upon a common group across comparisons (i.e., couple-oriented
psychosocial/behavioral intervention), this method allows for differences in effect sizes to
be evaluated [27].

Results

Characteristics of the Studies

Page 5

A total of 50 RCTs were identified and 33 of these studies met all criteria for inclusion.
These 33 studies were reported in 40 articles. Of the 17 studies that were excluded from our
review, three included only a second couple intervention comparison group; six did not
require partner participation for every patient; seven did not include a sample of at least 75%
partners; and one study reported only satisfaction with the intervention as an outcome.

Table 1 provides a summary of study characteristics. The illness most commonly targeted in
this group of studies is cancer (k=13; 39%). Overall, 96.7% of the dyads in these samples
were couples. Patients and partners in these studies were in their mid-50s on average.
Approximately half of these studies (46%) compared couple-oriented intervention to patient
usual medical care only. Consistent with the broader intervention literature, most of the
couple interventions were multi-component in nature and often included education of patient
and partner regarding chronic illness and its management, enhancement of communication
or support within couples, and cognitive-behavioral training. Borrowing from Baucom and
colleagues’ [28] system for characterizing family-oriented interventions, most of the couple
interventions can be classified as disorder-specific in that they targeted illness-specific
issues of both patient and partner, either together or with patient and partner separately in
several cases [29–31]. In many cases, these interventions addressed the role of relationship
functioning in illness management. In contrast, only three studies used a partner-assisted
type of approach as described by Baucom and colleagues, where the partner’s role was to
help the patient meet cognitive or behavioral objectives of the intervention (i.e., pain
management, problem-solving, or relaxation) [32–34].

The number of sessions that were included in couple interventions ranged from 3 to 20.
Reflecting a recent trend in intervention research, eight couple interventions were
implemented either partially or entirely over the telephone [29–31, 35–40]. A total of 14
studies tested a couple-oriented intervention in a group format (i.e., two or more couples
received the intervention together).

Assessment of patient outcomes focused primarily on psychological functioning (e.g.,
depressive symptoms, coping, self-efficacy for managing illness); health indicators such as
illness-specific symptoms, sexual function, pain, and general physical functioning; and
marital functioning (e.g., satisfaction, partner support).) Physiological outcomes were
examined in four studies and included viral load and CD4 cell count in HIV [41],
glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting blood sugar in Type 2 diabetes [42], erythrocyte
sedimentation rate in rheumatoid arthritis [43], and blood pressure in hypertension [34].
Health behaviors were examined in four studies and included adherence to antiretroviral
medication [41] as well as diet or exercise [42, 44, 45].

For partners, pre-post data were collected in 19 out of 33 studies (58%). Assessment of
partner outcomes focused primarily on psychological functioning (e.g., depressive
symptoms, self-efficacy for helping patient, caregiving stress) and marital functioning (e.g.,
satisfaction, quality of communication). Partners’ physical health was examined in four

studies and included perceived health, weight, and fasting blood sugar. Health behaviors
were examined in only one study, which assessed change in partner diet and exercise [42].

Study Findings

Table 2 describes each study according to sample, study groups, timing of follow-up, and
significant between-group differences for patient and partner.

Effects on Patients

A total of 32 studies examined between-group differences whereas one did not [46]. Of
these studies, 18 (56%) found consistent differences favoring couple intervention over usual
care or patient psychosocial intervention [31, 33–35, 39–41, 44, 47–57]. All types of patient
outcomes and chronic illnesses were represented in this group, with the exception of the
Type 2 diabetes study which showed mixed effects according to gender (described below).
A total of 7 studies (22%) found no differences between groups [29, 30, 32, 38, 43, 58, 59].

Of the remaining seven studies, six showed mixed effects according to outcome variable,
patient gender, and type of couple intervention. Cardiac surgery patients in a couple
intervention had greater increased efficacy but less tolerance for emotional distress than
those receiving a patient-oriented intervention [36, 37]. Osteoarthritis patients in a couple
intervention reported more improvement in spouse supportiveness but less improvement in
pain and disability than those receiving a patient-oriented intervention [60, 61]. Wing and
colleagues found that women with Type 2 diabetes showed greater weight loss from a
couple intervention whereas men with Type 2 diabetes showed greater weight loss from
patient intervention [42].

Couple-oriented cognitive-behavioral interventions for arthritis patients were more
beneficial than cognitive-behavioral patient interventions, but couple-oriented education
interventions did not show this advantage [62–64]. Not surprisingly, patient-oriented
exercise was more beneficial than a couple-oriented cognitive-behavioral intervention for
outcomes that were fitness related [65]. Finally, Riemsma and colleagues reported negative
effects of a couple-oriented education intervention on patient fatigue and self-efficacy [45],

Effects on Partners—Between-group differences were examined in 17 of the 33 studies.
Of these studies, six (35%) consistently found differences favoring couple intervention over
usual care or patient psychosocial intervention [32, 39, 40, 50, 60, 66] (see Table 2).
Specifically, couple interventions enhanced partners’ psychological functioning (i.e., self-
efficacy stress, mastery, anxiety) and perceptions of marital quality and coping as a couple.
Cancer, hypertension, and osteoarthritis were represented in this group of studies. A total of
ten studies (59%) found no differences between groups [30, 35–38, 43, 53, 57–59, 62, 63,
67]. The remaining study on obese spouses of adults with Type 2 diabetes found an
advantage of couple intervention over patient psychosocial intervention in terms of weight
loss and eating behaviors but an advantage of patient psychosocial intervention for enhanced
partner support [42],

Many of these studies suffered from methodological problems that could be corrected in
future research. First, studies rarely reported findings from both intent-to-treat and

completers analyses. That is, it was often unclear if analyses focused on all participants who
were randomly assigned to couple intervention regardless of whether they received it, or
focused only on participants who received the couple intervention. Findings from
completers analyses are valuable but may obscure selection effects and make it difficult to
interpret findings from an RCT. Second, little information was provided regarding number
of sessions attended by patients and partners. Incomplete implementation is a particular
concern in psychosocial and behavioral interventions and less than full participation by
partners may underestimate the effects of an intervention designed for couples.

Another methodological limitation is that many of the studies that did not find between-
group differences for patient or partner were statistically underpowered to do so (i.e., less
than approximately 50 participants per group for the detection of medium-sized effects).
However, five of these studies did find significant time effects of couple intervention
indicating improvement over time for patients [43], partners [35], or both [38, 58, 59].
Because meta-analysis summarizes the average impact of an intervention regardless of the
statistical significance of between-group differences, we conducted this type of analysis in
addition to our qualitative review.

Meta-analytic Findings

Our meta-analysis focused on outcomes for which there were an adequate number of effect
sizes for aggregation. We set this number at k≥10 for either type of comparison (i.e., couple
intervention versus patient psychosocial intervention or usual care) because there is limited
statistical power for meta-analysis and bias in the H heterogeneity statistic with fewer than
eight to ten studies [26, 68]. Applying this criterion, the following three patient outcomes
qualified for meta-analysis: depressive symptoms, marital functioning, and pain. Of the 33
studies identified for our review, a total of 25 were subjected to meta-analysis. The number
of studies included in the analyses for depressive symptoms, marital functioning, and pain
were 20, 18, and 14, respectively.

We conducted separate analyses according to whether the study compared couple
intervention to patient psychosocial intervention or usual care. The study by Nezu and
colleagues [33] was not included in the analysis of patient depressive symptoms for the
comparison of couple intervention and usual care because the effect size was an extreme
outlier (d=4.36). Results were then pooled to determine the overall effect size for studies
with either type of comparison group. Because some studies included both comparison
groups, there was overlap in these analyses (k= 4 for marital functioning and k=5 for
depressive symptoms and pain). For those studies that included both comparison groups, one
averaged effect size was submitted in the overall analyses for each outcome.

Depressive symptoms were most often assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies
—Depression scale [69] or the Brief Symptom Inventory [70]. Marital functioning was
assessed with global measures of relationship quality such as the Dyadic Adjustment Scale
[71] or specific measures of partner emotional or instrumental support [72, 73]. Current or
usual pain was assessed with visual analogue scales or other established measures such as
the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales [74]. For studies involving more than one measure

of an outcome, one effect size was calculated by averaging across the effect sizes for each
measure.

As shown in Table 3, a statistically significant effect of couple intervention was present in
the overall analyses for all three patient outcomes. That is, couple interventions were
successful in reducing patients’ depressive symptoms, enhancing marital functioning, and
reducing pain. All effect sizes were small in magnitude. An H value of 1 indicates
homogeneity of intervention effects; therefore, the values in Table 3 show that that there was
little heterogeneity in the effect sizes of this group of studies. The indirect meta-analysis
estimate compares the magnitude of effect sizes across the two comparison groups. In all
cases the 95% confidence interval overlapped 0 and this indicates that there were no
differences in effect sizes as a function of comparison group.

Discussion

In this review, we found that couple-oriented interventions targeted the most common and
deadly illnesses in adulthood (e.g., cancer and heart disease) as well as the most disabling
(e.g., arthritis) [75]. These illnesses require substantial behavioral changes, self-
management, and treatment decision making, all of which are likely to be strongly
influenced by the attitudes and behaviors of the spouse. Only one of the studies identified
for our review targeted Type 2 diabetes despite its prevalence and the rising incidence of
obesity. Clearly more research is warranted with this population.

Findings from our meta-analysis suggest that couple-oriented interventions for chronic
illness hold promise. There were small improvements in patient depressive symptoms,
marital functioning, and pain. The lack of heterogeneity within studies indicates that the
interventions included in our review had similar effects despite varying illness populations
and intervention content and suggests that it is useful to take a cross-disease perspective on
dyadic interventions. Along these lines, it may be valuable to develop standard couple-
oriented intervention content that can be applied to multiple chronic conditions, similar to
the approach taken in the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program that was developed
for heart disease, lung disease, stroke, and arthritis [76]. It would also be highly useful for
researchers to develop a battery of common outcome measures to be used across illness
populations in order to better synthesize this literature going forward [77].

The aggregate effects that we found in our meta-analyses were small in magnitude, raising
the question of how the impact of couple-oriented interventions could be strengthened. One
possible strategy for enhancing their impact is to place greater emphasis on targeting spouse
communications and actions that influence patient health behaviors. There is a high rate of
concordance between partners’ health-enhancing and health-compromising behaviors (e.g.,
smoking, drinking, dietary habits, body mass index, and level of physical activity) [78–80].
These findings, as well as recent work linking autonomy support and health-related social
control with disease management, could inform future couple interventions. Autonomy
support includes understanding for an individual’s situation and provision of choices for
making health behavior changes [81]. Social control involves attempts to regulate or
influence the behaviors of another person through actions, affective responses, and

corrective feedback [82]. Based on recent findings in these areas of research, future couple-
oriented interventions may be useful in teaching spouses how to support patients’ need to
make their own choices, as well as positive tactics for encouraging healthy behaviors such as
persuasion, modeling, and reinforcement.

Relatedly, the literature on couple-oriented interventions for at-risk groups (e.g., obese
individuals, smokers) that received much attention in the 1970s and 1980s is worth
revisiting. Behavioral weight-loss interventions that involve a support partner have been
successful and could be applied to ill populations [83, 84]. And although couple-oriented
interventions for smoking cessation have had disappointing effects, this has been attributed
in part to their failure in achieving substantial change in partner support [85, 86].

A second strategy for strengthening couple interventions is to directly target partners’ well-
being and worries about the future. Findings from the family caregiving intervention
literature suggest that addressing such issues is necessary for reducing emotional contagion
in couples and garnering partners’ ongoing support [8]. Specifically, it is important to
provide spouses with information about the illness and possible treatment options; validate
their experiences as a provider of support; teach them various stress management skills; and
help them to plan for the future. The value of such content seems especially important in
consideration of the fact that the partner often suffers from the same chronic condition as the
patient due to shared lifestyles and exposure to environmental stressors, as was reported in
studies included in our review [47, 60].

Couple-oriented interventions may also have a greater impact on couples with a high level
of conflict related to the illness or a low level of partner support for symptom management
and behavioral change. Manne and colleagues [52] found that the positive effects of a
couple-oriented intervention on breast cancer patients’ depressive symptoms were stronger
for patients with husbands who were unsupportive (e.g., critical of how the patient handled
cancer and uncomfortable talking about the cancer with her). None of the studies that we
reviewed included eligibility criteria related to spouse support or distress, possibly reducing
the size of intervention effects.

Overall marital quality may also be an important moderator of treatment effects. It has been
argued that marital quality may serve as an interpretive backdrop that alters patients’
appraisal of spousal behaviors and therefore the impact of those behaviors on health [1]. For
example, well-intentioned but unhelpful behaviors of the spouse may be perceived
positively by patients in happy marriages and negatively by those with dissatisfying
marriages. By extension, individuals with low overall marital quality may experience greater
benefits from a couple-oriented intervention than those with high marital quality. In future
research it will be important to address the extent to which marital problems that existed
prior to a chronic illness can be addressed within a couple-oriented intervention.

Approximately half of the studies that we reviewed reported that patients receiving a couple-
oriented intervention showed greater improvements than those receiving usual care or
patient psychosocial intervention. Of the studies that examined benefits for the partner,
approximately one third found that couple-oriented interventions led to improvements in

their psychological and marital functioning. Although it is difficult to draw strong
conclusions from this relatively small group of studies with different types of intervention
content, cognitive-behavioral strategies such as coping skills training for couples seemed to
be the most consistently successful.

Baucom and colleagues [28] noted that dyadic family interventions differ in the extent to
which they focus on interpersonal issues. Some interventions address communication or
relationship issues between patient and family member that might contribute to the
maintenance or exacerbation of an illness, whereas other interventions take the approach of
enlisting the family member’s help in changing the patient’s behaviors. Most of the couple
interventions that we reviewed targeted illness-specific issues of both patient and partner
whereas few took the approach of enlisting the partner as a coach in the patient’s
psychosocial or behavioral treatment. Although less intensive from a dyadic perspective, the
partner-assisted approach might make more sense for couples who are managing the illness
well. For these couples, relationship distress would not be a target of intervention. However,
information about the illness and tactics for making lifestyle changes may serve to enhance
the sense that each partner is working together to manage the illness, and may help to
maintain spouse support over the long term. Taking a less intensively dyadic approach with
some couples may enhance retention of participants, engagement in the intervention, and
generalizability of study findings to a broader population of couples.

A potential trade-off that was salient in this group of studies is that of a group format
intervention versus treating individual couples. Treating couples together in a group rather
than separately is more economical but limits the ability to discuss relationship issues in
depth if necessary or to address the varying needs of couples. As noted by other researchers
[87], the most successful interventions may be those that are tailored or adapted to the needs
of individual couples.

Improvements in methodological quality and attention to published guidelines for reporting
clinical trials [88–90] are much needed in this area of research. The most important and
feasible issues to address are use of intention-to-treat analyses, reporting of patient
adherence to treatment (e.g., number of sessions attended), and power analyses. Many
studies had inadequate statistical power to detect the small intervention effects that are
common in psychosocial intervention research, including the additional power that is often
needed to detect differences between two active interventions [91].

Limitations of our Review

It is important to acknowledge several limitations of this review. First, our meta-analysis did
not include unpublished studies. Our focus was on published, peer-reviewed studies because
we thought that they would be most methodologically rigorous and thus yield the strongest
conclusions in regard to efficacy. Second, our analyses did not take into account that
population effect sizes may be overestimated owing to a tendency for null findings to not
appear in the published literature. We did not make statistical corrections for publication
bias, because these corrections are often overly conservative when a small number of studies
are aggregated, as was true for our outcomes. Because of these decisions, our meta-analytic
findings should be considered preliminary and in need of corroboration.

Directions for Future Research

We would like to highlight four design and measurement issues for researchers to consider
in future research testing couple-oriented interventions. Our first recommendation is that
investigators explicitly reference the models and observational research that led them to use
a couple-oriented approach and the specific aspects of the marital relationship that were
targeted. We found that the majority of studies failed to describe how theory was used in the
development of intervention materials. Other researchers also have noted that couple
interventions are rarely conceptually driven nor do they often identify specific targets for
change [7]. Although specific theoretical or conceptual models are rarely tested in couple-
oriented intervention research, researchers sometimes cite the biopsychosocial model of
health and illness, marital and family systems frameworks, or stress and coping models that
are modified for the caregiving or care-receiving context.

Second, evaluation of change in marital or spouse factors is critical for establishing that
effects of the intervention on primary outcomes occurred through these mechanisms.
Although many studies addressed relationship issues, only half (55%) examined change in
any indicators of marital functioning. We return to these issues of theory and mechanisms in
our description of an additive model for couple-oriented interventions.

A third recommendation is to assess outcomes for the partner as well as for the patient.
Failure to assess effects on both patient and partner provides an incomplete picture regarding
efficacy. Lack of improvement for the patient may be explained by negative (but
unexamined) effects on the partner. For example, a couple-oriented intervention that fails to
address the partner’s needs or concerns may lead to more negative marital interactions or
lack of support for the patient’s behavioral changes. This phenomenon reflects the cyclical
nature of marital interactions in daily life, in that a partner’s affective and behavioral
reactions to the patient serve to influence that patient’s health and well-being, which in turn
drives future reactions. Assessing the partner’s perspective on change in marital interactions
is especially important because individuals do not always recognize having received support
even when they benefitted from it [92]. Other research teams have also argued for
examining the appraisal and coping strategies of both patient and partner in relation to each
other [14, 93–95].

Assessment of both patient and partner paves the way for dyadic analysis as an alternative to
focusing separately on patient and partner changes, as exemplified in two of the studies that
we reviewed [40, 50], and may include dyadic growth curve modeling [96] or dual change
score modeling [97]. In addition, studies that collect daily diary data from both patient and
partner (an increasingly common approach) and use multilevel analyses for time-series data
can indicate the stronger directional influence in associations between patient and partner
functioning. Finally, a dyadic approach to assessment will allow for better cost-benefit
analyses as this field progresses. That is, it will be important to weigh the benefits of couple-
oriented intervention for both patient and partner against the costs associated with targeting
both individuals.

A fourth recommendation for future research is to compare couple- and patient-oriented
approaches to intervention. This design feature is especially useful to the field of behavioral

medicine due to great interest in the most efficacious psychosocial or behavioral treatments
for chronic illness, yet it was included in only half of the studies that we reviewed. This is
also a superior study design for examining the unique effects of marriage on health, as
depicted in Fig. 1. This model depicts the influence of factors within three broad and
interrelated domains (psychological, behavioral, and marital/partner) on patient health.
Consistent with other conceptual frameworks [1, 98, 99], this model specifies that marital
functioning affects patient health directly through physiological parameters and indirectly
through changes in patient psychological functioning and health behaviors. To the marital
domain, we add partners’ own psychological functioning and health behaviors because of
their linkages with patient functioning in these same areas [80, 100].

As depicted in the figure, couple-oriented interventions are likely to have benefits beyond a
traditional patient-oriented approach due to their effects on marital/partner functioning
(indicated by the largest arrow) in addition to their effects on patients’ psychological
functioning or health behaviors. This research question could be tested using an additive/
constructive treatment design where a couple component is added to a standard patient
intervention [101]. Interventions that successfully modify marital or partner functioning and
then measure change in patient outcomes would enhance our understanding of the role of
marriage in health. Moreover, these interventions could provide critical information
regarding the unique and shared pathways leading to recovery from different health
conditions. In contrast to the comparison of couple intervention to usual care, the type of
design depicted in Fig. 1 can help to confirm that greater improvements in patient health
resulting from couple intervention are due at least in part to change in marital/partner
functioning and not only due to change in patient psychological functioning or health
behaviors.

Conclusions

The vast majority of adults living with a chronic illness are partnered, and this close
relationship plays a critical role in illness management. In turn, chronic illness takes a toll on
the well partner. Targeting both patient and partner in a psychosocial or behavioral
intervention is an approach that merits evaluation. Few randomized trials have been
designed to compare couple- and patient-oriented approaches, making it difficult to evaluate
the “relative” efficacy of a couples approach. Our review indicates that couple-oriented
interventions are promising but efforts are needed to strengthen future studies both
conceptually and methodologically. The added health care costs of targeting the partner may
be small when considering the potential benefits to both members of the dyad and
subsequent gains for the larger family unit.

additional domain of functioning (i.e., marital/partner). Examples of specific constructs are
