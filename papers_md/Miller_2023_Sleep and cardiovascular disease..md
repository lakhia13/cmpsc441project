This review centres around the recent evidence in examining the intersection of sleep
and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Sleep in this review will be further subdivided to con-
sider both sleep quantity and quality along and will also consider some of the more
common sleep disorders, such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea, in the context
of CVD. Sleep disorders have been further explored in several speciﬁc populations which
are both at risk of sleep disorders and CVD. Secondly, the review will present some of
the risk factors for CVD that are affected by sleep and sleep disorders which include
hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. It will also examine the potential underlying mechan-
isms including inﬂammation, appetite control, endocrine, and genetic processes that are
affected by sleep and sleep disorders leading to increased risk of CVD development. In
addition, we will consider the observed bi-directional relationships between sleep and
cardiovascular risk factors. For example, obesity, a risk factor for CVD can be affected by
sleep, but in turn can increase the risk of certain sleep disorder development which dis-
leading to further risk of obesity development and increased CVD risk.
rupts sleep,
Finally, the review will explore emerging evidence around lifestyle interventions that have
included a sleep component and how it impacts the management of CVD risk factor. The
need for increased awareness of the health effects of poor sleep and sleep disorders will
be discussed alongside the need for policy intervention to improve sleep to facilitate
better health and well-being.

Background
Quantity and quality of sleep are affected by many different parameters including both personal and
environmental factors. A reduction in the average hours of sleep across westernised populations has
been reported, which may in part reﬂect changes in societal working hours and increasing shift work,
with increasing reports of fatigue, tiredness, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). In the U.S.A., the
percentage of adults sleeping 6 h or less a night increased by 31% sleep duration has reduced amongst
US adults in the period from 1985 to 2012 [1]. Short sleep is associated with an increased risk of mul-
tiple adverse health outcomes including total mortality [2] and this review will examine evidence that
suggests that both poor sleep (quantity and quality) and sleep disorders are independently associated
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Sleep
Poor or unhealthy sleep might reﬂect either a difﬁcult in initiating sleep, difﬁculty maintaining sleep
(DMS), or waking up tired. It may arise because of an individual’s inability to obtain sufﬁcient sleep
or sleep of sufﬁcient quality. This may result from an individual’s lifestyle choices, work demands,
environmental factors, or be due to underlying medical conditions that cause sleep disturbances.
Ideally, it is suggested that an adult should obtain 7–9 h of sleep per night [3] that is maintained at a
regular time each day, during normal nighttime hours and, should be uninterrupted.

Sleep disorders
There are over 70 known sleep disorders many of which are associated with poor sleep including
insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).

Insomnia is characterised by a feeling of difﬁculty initiating sleep (DIS), DMS, waking up early or waking up
feeling tired (non-restorative sleep (NRS)), and daytime sleepiness. OSA is a chronic, sleep-related breathing
disorder, which is associated with sleep fragmentation. Insomnia and OSA are two of the most common sleep
disorders which can cause EDS, that is an increased propensity to fall asleep during the day, even in inappro-
priate circumstances.

PLMD is a condition in which people experience repetitive periodic limb movements (PLMS) such as

jerking, cramping, or twitching in their lower limbs during sleep, and which can cause sleep disturbances.

Sleep and cardiovascular disease
CVD can be subdivided into different types including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, peripheral artery
disease, and aortic disease. Signiﬁcant relationships have been demonstrated between short sleep and both
CHD and stroke [4]. Chandola et al. [5] demonstrated that that cardiovascular mortality was mainly greater in
short sleepers who also experience poor sleep quality.

Poor sleep may have many biological effects on metabolic, endocrine, and immune systems [6] and adversely
affect risk factors associated with cardiovascular risk (see Figure 1). The relationship, however, appears to be
complex with both short and long sleep associated with many adverse health outcomes [7,8]. A recent
meta-analysis suggested that both long sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with arterial stiff-
ness (AS), a key risk factor for hypertension and CVD [9]. In this review, we will outline some of the plausible
mechanisms by which short sleep may lead to an increase in CVD, including inﬂammatory, appetite, endo-
crine, and genetic mechanisms. To date, however, there are no studies that have demonstrated a possible
mechanisms for the association between long sleep and CVD. This suggests that different underlying mechan-
isms/causal pathways may be important for the associations seen for long and short sleep. Indeed, it has been
suggested that the association between long sleep and CVD may be explained by residual confounding and
co-morbidities. Factors that might be important include depressive symptoms, socio-economic and employ-
ment status, and the presence of yet undiagnosed health conditions.

Sleep disorders and CVD risk
Insomnia and CVD risk
In women compared with men, the prevalence of insomnia may be higher, with an overall prevalence in the
general population of 22.0% [10]. Wu et al. [11] demonstrated that insomnia was associated with an increased
summary relative risk (SRR) of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) (SRR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.26–1.35), cardiovascular diseases
(1.45, 1.29–1.64), CHD (1.28, 1.10–1.50), myocardial infarction (MI) (1.42, 1.17–1.72), and stroke (1.55, 1.39–
1.72). Insomnia and sleep duration of less than 5 h per night has also been shown to be highly associated with
an increased incidence of MI, with a difﬁculty in initiating or maintaining sleep but not with NRS of daytime
dysfunction [12].

Obstructive sleep apnoea and CVD risk
OSA is characterised by repetitive partial or complete blockages of the airway during sleep, leading to interrup-
tions in breathing, blood oxygen desaturation, and arousal from sleep which may cause chronic sleep depriv-
ation. It is associated with an increased CVD risk, acting through inﬂammation, neurohormonal dysregulation,
and endothelial dysfunction [13]. Estimates suggest that in western countries at least 10% of females and 20%
of males are affected by asymptomatic OSA [14]. In some patients OSA is associated with EDS, these patients
are classiﬁed as having obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) [15]. The British Lung Foundation suggests
that many with OSA/OSAS remain undiagnosed [16]. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates from 2007
suggested that 100 million people around the world were affected by OSA. Much higher prevalences were
reported in a more recent study by Benjaﬁeld et al. [17]; estimating the global prevalence of OSA in individuals
30–69 years old that may have mild-to-serve OSA at 936 million individuals, of these 425 million may have
moderate-to-severe OSA. If untreated, it leads to poor health outcomes [18–20] and has been shown to be a
risk factor for Arrhythmias, Conduction Disorders, and Cardiac Arrest [21]. A recent meta-analysis demon-
strated that OSA was associated with a 74% relative increased risk of all-cause cardiac death and 94% increased
risk of cardiovascular mortality [22].

OSA is a known risk factor for hypertension in adults and a recently signiﬁcantly higher mean systolic BP
(SBP) was observed in children with mild or moderate-to-severe OSA compared with healthy controls.
Furthermore, in the prospective studies, moderate-to-severe childhood OSA was associated with a risk of ele-
vated SBP in adulthood. Early detection and treatment of OSA may promote cardiovascular health in children
and possibly in future adulthood [23].

Obesity is a risk factor for the development of OSA, with increased tongue size and fatty deposits in the
neck which occlude the airway. This in turn can lead to fragmented sleep which may lead to metabolic and
hormonal changes that
increase appetite and lead to further weight gain thus potentiating a vicious
bi-directional pathway of increased risk of obesity and increased severity of OSA and CVD [24,25].

The intermittent drops in oxygen saturation (hypoxia), abrupt drops in intrathoracic pressure, sympathetic
activation, and inﬂammatory disturbances associated with OSA can cause acute and long-term adverse implica-
tion for heart and blood vessels. A recent study indicates that right-ventricular free-wall and global longitudinal
strain are impaired in patients with OSA. Moreover, the deterioration of these indices was evident in the early
stages of the disease and was related to disease severity [26]. Individuals with OSA suffer from oxidative stress
because of the hypoxemic episodes associated with this condition. These in turn can induce a type of arrhyth-
mia known as AF. A recent meta-analysis of sixteen observation studies showed that the risk of AF increased
with increasing OSA severity as determined by measuring the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) in a dose-
dependent manner [27].

OSA has also been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cerebral vessel disease, a major contribu-
tor to adverse health outcomes, including stroke; moderate-severe OSA was associated with a higher risk of
lacunar infarcts, but no association with cerebral microbleeds [28]. In acute coronary syndrome patients OSA is
associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the risk of cardiovascular events [29].

OSA in other population groups
In certain rare diseases, the prevalence of OSA is markedly higher than that among the average population,
such as in Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder [30] and Marfan syndrome in which the
upper airway is excessively collapsible [31,32]. Both conditions demonstrate excess CVD risk [33].

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) disease is a prevalent disorder affecting 8–13% of reproductive-age
women [34]. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, PCOS participants had a 6.22-fold risk (OR) of
sleep disturbance, which included sleep-disturbed breathing and OSA, compared with non-PCOS participants
[35,36].

It has also been reported to be higher in other speciﬁc populations including sportsmen such as American
football players; despite being athletes, some evidence suggests the size of the players, particularly lineman, is
associated with a high prevalence of obesity which might have contributed to their increased susceptibility to
develop OSA [37,38]. Sleep disorders are also prevalent in professional rugby players [39,40] and athletes
undertaking contact sports have higher prevalence of OSA which may be the result of a head injuries [41].

Shift work is associated with an increased risk of CVD with the risk of any CVD event being 17% higher
among shift workers than day workers [42]. The risk of CHD morbidity was 26% higher. Furthermore, after

the ﬁrst 5 years of shift work, there was a 7.1% increase in the risk of CVD events for every additional 5 years
of exposure.

In a recent meta-analysis, the prevalence of sleep disorders in ﬁrst responders was found to be, 31% for shift
work disorder (SWD), 30% for OSA, 28% for insomnia, 28% for EDS, 2% for restless leg syndrome, and 1%
for narcolepsy. First responders with OSA were also more likely to be at risk of developing CVD alongside
anxiety, depression, diabetes, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder compared with
those without [43].

COMISA (Co-Morbid Insomnia and Sleep Apnoea)
In some individuals, co-morbid insomnia and OSA co-occur as COMISA. These individuals have higher rates
of hypertension and CVD at baseline, and an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with no insomnia/
OSA [44].

Somnipathy, diabetes, and CVD risk
Both abnormal or disordered sleep ‘somnipathy’ and diabetes have been shown to be associated with an
increased risk of CVD. A study evaluated the risk of the coexistence of somnipathy (which includes insomnia
and sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep–wake dis-
orders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and other sleep disorders) and diabetes. It showed that
the presence of both was associated with higher risks of CVD, CHD, stroke, and mortality than when an indi-
vidual had either somnipathy or diabetes alone [45].

Risk factors for CVD and association with sleep and sleep
disorders
The suggested link between poor sleep and risk factors for CVD and the potential underlying mechanisms is
shown in Figure 1. Each of these risk factors and potential mechanism will be brieﬂy considered below.

Hypertension
A lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [46,47]. PLMS is also associated with an
increased risk of hypertension in cross-sectional studies, but further prospective studies would be required to
demonstrate causality [48].

Diabetes
Early meta-analyses of prospective studies support an epidemiological link between quantity (short and long
duration) and quality of sleep (difﬁculties in initiating or in maintaining sleep) and the subsequent develop-
ment of type-2 diabetes (T2DM) [49]. In a recent meta-analyses, a potential dose–response relationship was
observed between the severity of the (OSA) and the risk of T2DM [50]. In a separate study, OSA was associated
with a higher risk of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired glucose regulation, and dia-
betes mellitus in both cohort and cross-sectional studies; moreover, the severity of diabetes increased with the
severity of OSA [51].

Obesity
An elevated body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, T2DM, and other chronic
diseases including OSA. Overweight individuals are deﬁned as having a BMI of 25–30 kg/m2, and obese indivi-
duals having a BMI > 30 kg/m2. Increasing evidence from cross-sectional [52] and more recent prospective
studies, in which short sleep proceeds the subsequent weight gain in infants and children [53–55], support a
link between short sleep and the development of obesity. This suggests that the relationship is causally related
and may contribute to obesity development, but it is possible that there may be many different underlying
mechanisms.

Mechanisms
Inﬂammation
Sleep deprivation is associated with markers of inﬂammation including interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein
(CRP) [6,56–58], which are associated with increased risk of CVD. Usually during sleep, blood pressure

decreases, and blood vessels relax; however, it has been proposed that if sleep is restricted and blood pressure
remains elevated there may be an effect on the blood vessel that leads to an increase in inﬂammation. Several
inﬂammatory mechanisms, associated with the pathophysiology and progression of OSA, have also been asso-
ciated with COVID-19 disease. This may increase the risk of poor COVID-related outcomes in individuals with
OSA [59]. A lack of sleep has also been associated with higher circulating lipids [60] and the development of
obesity which might also lead to the activation of inﬂammatory pathways [61].

Appetite
A lack of sleep may inﬂuence various hormonal responses affecting both hunger, satiety, and appetite control
[62] which would increase appetite. Spiegel et al. [63], in a randomised cross-over trial, demonstrated that
acute sleep deprivation was associated with a decrease in the satiety hormone leptin and an increase in the
hunger hormone ghrelin and, despite a glucose infusion to maintain caloric intake, an increase in hunger.
Likewise in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study individuals who slept less than 8 h had an increased in BMI and
lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels [62]. Serum leptin levels have also been shown to be elevated in children
with OSA and correlated with BMI [64].

Endocrine
Sleep restriction is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity, and circadian misalignment and slow-wave sleep
suppression negatively affect insulin sensitivity [65]. This in turn may lead to high glucose levels and diabetes
risk which over time leads to damage to the arteries and subsequent build-up of fatty material within them
leading to the development of atherosclerosis and CVD. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is
important for regulating salt and water homeostasis and blood pressure control as well as cardiovascular
remodelling. It was recently found that patients with OSA have higher levels of RAAS hormones, blood pres-
sure, and heart rate compared with those without OSA [66].

Genetic
Many biological processes within the body run on an approximately 24-h cycle that is controlled by the action
of light on the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the brain. This in turn regulates clocks in
other body tissues and is inﬂuenced by the action of many genes including the ‘clock’ genes Per, tim, and Cry.
These genes govern the timing of many physiological processes such as the 24 h variation in glucose levels
[67]. Studies in mice suggest that genetic mutations of these genes can affect metabolism and lipid and glucose
metabolism [68]. These processes, however, can be disrupted when individuals sleep outside the normal light–
dark cycle for example in shift work and this can lead to alternations in metabolism and increased CVD
risk [69].

In a recent Mendelian randomisation study, it was demonstrated that there is evidence to suggest casual evi-

dence for both unidirectional and bi-directional relationships between sleep and adiposity [70].

Genes also determine an individual’s chronotype, which determines whether they are more likely to have a
natural inclination to wake up early and go to bed early (lark) or to get up later and go to bed later (owl). A
longer allele on the PER3 circadian clock gene is associated with being a lark [71]. Evening chronotype indivi-
duals may have a higher risk of obesity and a worse metabolic proﬁle [72]. A recent study conducted in teen-
agers, suggested that this may be due to differences in food preferences [73]. They found that teenagers who
reported later sleep timing were more likely to consume sugary/caffeinated beverages and high-energy-dense,
nutrient-poor foods.

Eating patterns are affected by a lack of sleep. In one study short sleeping individuals had an increased

intake of snacks and fatty and sweet foods but decreased intake of fruit and vegetables [74].

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of sleep apnoea uncovered multiple genetic
loci associated with the sleep apnoea. These included ﬁve independent signiﬁcant loci associated signals that
spanned chromosomes 5, 11, 12, and 16 near genes ANKRD31, STK33, BDNF, KDM2B, and PRIM1. Whilst
adjustment for BMI as a covariate led to a signiﬁcant reduction in the strength of these associations it also
identiﬁed a new signiﬁcant locus on chromosome 15 near HDGFL3 and one on chromosome 13 near DLEU1
and DLEU7. This study observed genetic correlations with several complex traits, including multisite chronic
pain, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and BMI-associated conditions.
Findings from their study also suggested that the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) would be pre-
dicted to reduce the risk of OSA [75].

A separate study, which utilised samples from the UK biobank, concluded that there was evidence for
pathway-speciﬁc genetic risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) that differ between individuals with and
without OSA in a qualitatively pathway-dependent manner [76].

Social factors
In pre-school-aged children, it has been shown that regularly eating the evening meal as a family, obtaining
adequate nighttime sleep, and having limited screen-viewing time were associated with lower prevalence of
obesity compared with those children who did not have these routines [77]. An earlier bedtime in pre-school
children has also been shown to be associated with a lower BMI scores and lower intake of added sugars [78].

Lifestyle intervention programmes and treatments
Sleep and weight loss
Results from a randomised cross-over trial in healthy adults suggest that insufﬁcient sleep may determine what
proportion of fat to muscle is loss on a calorie-controlled diet [79]. The investigators found that when indivi-
duals who were either overweight or obese were assigned to the 8.5 h sleep period, they lost most of their
weight as fat mass but when they were assigned to the 5 h sleep period they loss more of the weight as muscle
mass. These individuals also reported an increase in appetite when they slept only 5.5 h, which might affect an
individual’s ability to lose metabolically active fat mass on a calorie-controlled diet.

Sleep extension studies in children
In a systematic review and meta-analysis of ﬁve intervention studies that aimed to improve sleep in pre-school
children, it was found that there was a beneﬁcial effect on BMI [80]. There was, however, a signiﬁcant degree of
heterogeneity between the different interventions used and further studies are required to investigate this further.

Sleep extension studies in adults
Sleep extension may have beneﬁcial metabolic effects and may be a useful adjunct therapy for weight manage-
ment [81]. Al Khatib et al. [82] assessed the feasibility of a personalised sleep extension protocol in adults aged
18–64 years who were habitually short sleepers (5 to <7 h). Individuals who received targeted sleep hygiene sig-
niﬁcantly increased their time in bed and sleep duration. Furthermore, the sleep extension group reduced their
intake of fat, carbohydrates, and free sugars as compared with the control group.

Napping
There has been some debate as to whether napping is of beneﬁt to health and whilst various studies have
found that short daytime naps (10–30 min) can increase performance and make you more productive at work
it is possible that longer naps might be the result of a ‘need to sleep’ due to an underlying pathology i.e. EDS
or OSA. A recent study suggested napping was associated with an increase in brain size, which might have a
beneﬁcial effect of preserving memory and cognitive function in older adults [83]. But, in a British cohort
study of over 16 000 men and women, it was shown that daytime napping was associated with and increased
risk of all-cause mortality [84]. A recent genetic mendelian randomisation study also demonstrated that more
frequent daytime napping was signiﬁcantly associated with higher odds of coronary atherosclerosis, MI, and
heart failure. Regular napping during the daytime was also associated with increased of CVD primarily through
the development of atherosclerosis [85]. Furthermore, in a dose–response meta-analyses it was shown that
daytime napping <30 min/d was not signiﬁcantly associated with higher odds of most CVD risk factors and
CVD among young and middle-aged adults but in older adults aged >60 years, a signiﬁcant dose–response
association of any daytime napping with higher odds of diabetes, dyslipidemia, MetS, and mortality was
observed [86].

Treatment for OSA and CVD risk
OSA is associated with the CVD, which frequently requires continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to
keep the airway open at night. Marin et al. [87] have shown a beneﬁcial effect of CPAP on CVD risk in indivi-
duals with severe OSA. Although a recent randomised control trial failed to demonstrate a statistically signiﬁ-
cant reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with OSA treated with CPAP. [88]. The
reasons for these differences are unclear, but the authors do cite several limitations to their study and suggest

that the study may have been inadequately powered in relation to the sample size. CPAP treatment does,
however, have a beneﬁcial effect on hypertension [89] and cardiovascular autonomic function [90].

Inﬂammatory markers including CRP are increased in OSA [91] and inﬂammatory (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α)
and cardiometabolic proﬁles (total cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride) as well as leptin are improved following soft-
tissue surgery for OSA [92]. Likewise, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a measure of subclinical sys-
temic inﬂammation, is signiﬁcantly reduced in patients using CPAP [93].

Policy intervention
Sleep is affected by several factors including an individual’s physical and mental health but also by environmen-
tal (such as light and noise pollution) and social factors (such as shift work). Short-term disruptions can affect
performance and lead to a risk of accidents, but long-term disturbances can lead to poor health and increased
CVD risk. Public health strategies are needed to increase the awareness of the importance of healthy sleep
habits and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders [94].

Summary
(cid:129) Chronic sleep loss and poor-quality sleep are risk factors for CVD development.

(cid:129) Sleep disorders are often undetected, yet the prevalence may be very high in speciﬁc popula-

tions, including athletes, and warrants further investigation.

(cid:129) Detection and treatment of poor sleep and sleep disorders are important for CVD prevention

in both adults and children.

(cid:129) Improving sleep may aid weight regulation and management in children and adults and

reduce CVD risk.

(cid:129) There is a need for policy intervention to improve sleep to facilitate better health and

well-being.
