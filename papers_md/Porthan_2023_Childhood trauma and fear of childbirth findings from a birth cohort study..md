Abstract
The aim of this study is to investigate if experiencing childhood trauma (emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, 
physical neglect, or sexual abuse) or a greater total burden of childhood trauma increase the risk of fear of childbirth (FOC). 
This study included 2556 women living in Southwest Finland. Women were recruited during routine ultrasound visits at 
gestational week (gwk) 12. Experiencing childhood trauma was assessed in retrospect with the Trauma and Distress Scale 
(TADS) questionnaire completed at gwk 14. Information on the diagnosis of FOC (ICD-10 diagnosis O99.80) was obtained 
from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Associations between childhood trauma (domains and total TADS score) and FOC 
were analyzed with logistic regression in unadjusted and adjusted models. Emotional abuse (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10–1.42), 
emotional neglect (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.46), and a greater total burden of trauma (TADS total score) (aOR 1.06, 95% 
CI 1.02–1.10) increased the risk for FOC. We found no evidence for physical abuse (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00–1.32), physical 
neglect (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92–1.22), and sexual abuse (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99–1.56) associating with FOC. Childhood 
emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and a greater total burden of childhood trauma increase the risk for FOC. However, the 
childhood traumatic events were inquired in retrospect, which could distort the events.

Introduction

Fear of childbirth (FOC) is estimated to affect 5–11% of 
women (Nilsson et al. 2018; O’Connell et al. 2019). Women 
with FOC are more likely to prefer cesarean section (CS) as 
their mode of delivery (Størksen et al. 2015), and up to 45% 
give birth by CS (Räisänen et al. 2014). Pregnancy is often 
a stressful time for women with FOC, and FOC can deterio-
rate family well-being overall (Saisto et al. 2001; Areskog, 
Uddenberg, and Kjessler 1984).

Several themes have been identified behind fear regard-
ing childbirth, such as lack of trust in healthcare personnel, 
fear of pain, loss of control, own incompetence, or death or 
harm to the infant or to oneself (Sjögren 1997; Slade et al. 
2019). Nulliparous women may fear the unknown as a result 
of the lack of experience, whereas in multiparas, fear is more 
likely to stem from previous negative childbirth experiences 
(Slade et al. 2019).

Besides negative experiences regarding childbirth, other 
traumatic events may predispose women to FOC. Child-
hood trauma is known to associate with a susceptibility to

psychiatric disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders 
(Carr et al. 2013). Adults who have experienced childhood 
trauma are less resilient to stress, possibly because of early-
life alterations in neurobiological stress regulation systems 
(Nemeroff 2004). Further, women with a history of child-
hood trauma and women suffering from FOC have similar 
personality traits, such as proneness to anxiety (Spice et al. 
2009;  Mancini,  van  Ameringen,  and  MacMillan  1995). 
This leads us to expect that experience of childhood trauma 
increases the risk of FOC, although very few previous stud-
ies have empirically analyzed the association (Lukasse et al. 
2010, 2011; Heimstad et al. 2006).

Childhood  trauma  can  be  divided  into  five  domains: 
emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and emotional and 
physical neglect (Burgermeister 2007). To date, research 
has focused on the effects of abuse and two studies have 
reported that childhood emotional and physical abuse or 
experiencing any childhood abuse increases the risk for FOC 
(Lukasse et al. 2010, 2011), whereas the results regarding 
sexual abuse have been conflicting (Lukasse et al. 2010, 
2011; Heimstad et al. 2006). To our knowledge, a possible 
influence of childhood neglect has not been studied, even 
though it is more common than abuse. Both emotional and/
or physical neglect may impact later psychopathology, as 
neglect is often long-lasting and usually can be attributed to 
one’s own family or an otherwise close person.

FOC  can  lead  to  decreased  family  well-being  and 
increased rates of CS. It is important to better understand the 
reasons behind FOC to find more efficient strategies to pre-
vent and to treat it. Effective treatment of FOC could reduce 
stress and concerns during pregnancy and lead to more sat-
isfying birth experiences (Uçar and Golbasi 2019). The aim 
of the current study was to examine if childhood trauma and 
its different dimensions are associated with FOC. Clarifying 
the background of FOC helps to focus and develop targeted 
interventions for FOC.

Methods

Study population and data sources

This study included 2556 women from the FinnBrain Birth 
Cohort Study (www. finnb rain. fi). The purpose of the cohort 
study was to identify biomarkers related to prenatal stress, 
early  life  stress  exposures,  and  trajectories  for  common 
psychiatric and somatic illnesses. The exclusion process is 
presented in Fig. 1. A total of 3808 women living in South-
west Finland and the Åland island were recruited between 
December 2011 and April 2015 during their ultrasound 
screening visit at gestational week (gwk) 12. The ultrasound 
screening is offered to all women by public healthcare and is 
attended with high coverage. The families were approached 

by the nurses if they had a normal screening result and had 
sufficient knowledge of Finnish or Swedish. Written consent 
was received from the participants.

Participants completed the Trauma and Distress Scale 
(TADS) questionnaire at gwk 14. Questionnaire data was 
supplemented  with  data  from  Statistics  Finland  and  the 
Finnish Medical Birth Register (FMBR). The study design 
has been described in detail by Karlsson et al. (2018).

The diagnosis of FOC (ICD-10 diagnosis O99.80) was 
obtained from the FMBR. All women with the diagnosis 
were referred for treatment of FOC to the antenatal clinic 
of a tertiary hospital (Turku University Hospital) mostly by 
nurses and midwives at maternity clinics in primary care. 
All women are asked about their fear as a part of routine care 
on a scale of 0 to 10. This unvalidated screening method is 
used nationally in maternity clinics in Finland. If the mother 
is considered as possibly suffering from FOC, she is referred 
to the tertiary antenatal clinic after gwk 30. They were then 
assessed in the tertiary antenatal clinic by obstetrician, assis-
tant physician, or midwife and were diagnosed with FOC 
in the third trimester after a clinical evaluation. After the 
first visit, the women were offered further appointments to 
discuss their fear if felt it was needed. Participation in the 
study did not affect screening or diagnostics.

The domains of childhood trauma (emotional abuse, emo-
tional neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, and sexual 
abuse) were assessed with the TADS questionnaire. TADS 
is a self-reported questionnaire and has been validated in 
a  Finnish  sample  (Salokangas  et  al. 2016).  Each  of  the 
domains consists of 4 to 5 questions (Table S1, Supplemen-
tary material). Each question is rated for their frequency in 
three age categories (0–6, 7–12, and 13–18 years) in a Likert 
format from 0 to 4 (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 
= often, and 4 = almost always). The highest rate answered 
in any of the questions (in any of the age categories) was the 
rate of the domain. Reversed questions were reverse scored 
before rating. The TADS total score, representing the total 
burden of childhood trauma, was calculated as the total score 
of all five domains.

Information on age, parity, previous miscarriages, and 
pregnancy terminations was received from the FMBR, and 
maternal education and childhood socioeconomic status 
from Statistics Finland. Information on cohabiting status 
came from the questionnaire. The mothers’ own educational 
level was assessed in three categories: secondary or lower 
level education, vocational (lower) tertiary level education 
(polytechnics and universities of applied sciences), and uni-
versity education. Childhood socioeconomic status (child-
hood household’s reference person’s socioeconomic group, 
i.e., occupation) was divided into four categories: upper 
level employees, lower level employees, manual workers, 
and others. Other factors such as intimate partner violence 
or other traumatic events in adulthood might also have an

impact on mental health. We did not have information on 
these factors. Furthermore, because childhood trauma can 
affect these adulthood experiences but the opposite influence 
is not possible, these factors cannot confound the relation-
ship between childhood trauma and FOC.

Statistical analysis

Correlations between the TADS domains were calculated 
with  Spearman’s  rank-order  method.  The  associations 
between childhood trauma and FOC were explored with 
logistic regression with separate models, where FOC was the 
outcome variable and childhood trauma the independent var-
iable. In adjusted models, the chosen covariates were mater-
nal age (as a continuous variable), square of maternal age, 
parity, and childhood socioeconomic status. The included 
covariates were factors that precede the diagnosis of FOC 
or could explain the exposure to childhood traumas. As we 
did not have information on previous mode of birth or birth 
experiences, they were not included in the analyses. Age was 
considered to control for the time after the occurrence of 

trauma in childhood, as the effect of trauma on later psycho-
pathology could decrease over time (Green et al. 2010). As 
both younger and older mothers can be at increased risk for 
FOC (Dencker et al. 2019), the analyses were adjusted also 
for the square of the age to take into account the possible 
U-shape of the effect. Childhood socioeconomic status can 
affect the probability of childhood trauma, as maltreatment 
is more common in families of low socioeconomic status 
(Walsh et al. 2019). As earlier birth experiences affect FOC 
(Størksen et al. 2013), parity was also included in the covari-
ates. Because of the importance of previous birth experi-
ences as a predictor of FOC, analyses were also performed 
separately to nulli- and multiparous women. Significance 
levels were set at the 5% level.

The  groups  of  FOC  and  non-FOC  women  were  also 
described in terms of other possible covariates (maternal 
education, cohabiting status, previous miscarriages, and 
pregnancy terminations). To avoid overcontrolling the analy-
ses, they were used only for characterizing the differences 
between women with and without FOC and not as covariates 
in the main analyses.

Results

The mean age of the subjects was 30.9 years, 52.6% were 
nulliparous, and 93.5% were cohabiting. Only 2.5% (n = 
64) of the mothers did not have a post compulsory educa-
tion degree (included in the category of secondary level 
education). In total, 165 women (6.5%) had FOC. The pro-
portion of multiparous women in women with and without 
FOC were 61.2% and 46.5%, consecutively. Characteristics 
of the women are presented in Table 1. The frequency of 
each rate in each domain of childhood trauma is presented 
in Figure S1 (Supplementary material). The correlations 
between sexual abuse and other domains of trauma were 
weak, whereas the correlations between emotional abuse, 
emotional neglect, physical abuse, and physical neglect were 
stronger (Table S2, Supplementary material).

The effects of the covariates are presented in Table 2. 
Only multiparity had a statistically significant association 
with FOC, whereas maternal age or childhood socioeco-
nomic status had no association with FOC. The associa-
tions between childhood trauma and FOC are presented in

Table 3. Maternal age or childhood socioeconomic status 
was not associated with FOC, while multiparity increased 
the risk (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.22–2.41, p = 0.002). Of the dif-
ferent domains of childhood trauma, emotional abuse (aOR 
1.25, 95% CI 1.10–1.42, p < 0.001), emotional neglect (aOR 
1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.46, p = 0.003), and total TADS sum 
score (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.10, p = 0.003) increased 
the risk for FOC both in unadjusted and adjusted models. 
Physical abuse, physical neglect, or sexual abuse was not 
associated with FOC at the 5% level of significance.

Emotional abuse was associated with FOC in both nulli- 
and multiparous women whereas emotional neglect and 
a greater total burden of trauma (total TADS score) were 
associated with FOC only in nulliparous women. Physical 
abuse, physical neglect, or sexual abuse was not associated 
with FOC (Table S3, supplementary material).

Discussion

Main findings

Experiencing emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and a 
greater total burden of trauma in childhood were associated 
with an increased risk of FOC. Interestingly, we found no 
association between sexual abuse, physical abuse, or physi-
cal neglect and FOC.

In subpopulation analyses (nulli- and multiparous women 
separately), emotional abuse increased the risk for FOC 
both in nulli- and multiparous women, whereas emotional 
neglect and greater total burden of trauma only in nullipa-
rous women.

Interpretation

Our results regarding emotional abuse were in line with 
some  previous  reports  (Lukasse  et  al.  2010,  2011), 
whereas the results on physical and sexual abuse are in 
conflict with some previous ones (Lukasse et al. 2010, 
2011; Heimstad et al. 2006). However, there were multiple 
differences in the study designs such as clinical evaluation

for FOC in our study whereas questionnaires were used in 
previous ones. Therefore, our study is not entirely com-
parable to previous ones. To date, this is the first study to 
investigate if emotional or physical neglect affects FOC. 
The prevalence of FOC in this sample (6.5%) was simi-
lar to previous findings of 5–11% (Nilsson et al. 2018; 
O’Connell et al. 2019).

Physical abuse did not increase the risk for FOC. Previous 
studies have reported an increase in FOC in association with 
childhood physical abuse, both in unadjusted and adjusted 
models (Lukasse et al. 2010, 2011). Differences in the ques-
tionnaires used may partially account for the discrepant 
results. The TADS may depict a somewhat more serious 
degree of physical abuse than the Norvold Abuse Question-
naire used in previous studies (Lukasse et al. 2010, 2011). 
In addition, the association between FOC and physical abuse 
fell only slightly short of the 5% level of significance.

Childhood sexual abuse was not associated with FOC. 
Previously, childhood sexual abuse was associated with 
FOC in nulliparous but not in multiparous women (Lukasse 
et al. 2010). Another study conducted in multiparous women 
showed an increased risk for FOC only in an unadjusted 
model, but not when adjusted for age, education, marital 
status, adult abuse, and mental distress (Lukasse et al. 2011). 
As sexual abuse was reported much less frequently than 
other domains of childhood trauma, our sample size might 
have been too small to observe the association.

Experiencing childhood trauma has been associated with 
decreased resilience later in life (Beutel et al. 2017). Trauma 
during the programming of the central nervous system may 
change stress regulation neurobiology, and these early-life 
alterations could result in decreased resilience in adulthood 
(Nemeroff 2004). In turn, decreased resilience might play a 
part in FOC. Personality traits often associated with a history 
of childhood trauma might also contribute to FOC. Indeed, 
women with FOC as well as women who have experienced 
childhood trauma often have similar personality traits, such 
as an anxiety-prone personality (Spice et al. 2009; Man-
cini, van Ameringen, and MacMillan 1995). Women with 
low resilience and a more anxiety-prone personality might 
find it more difficult to cope with unpredictability and pain

associated with childbirth and, thus, feel incapable to give 
birth, leading to increased levels of FOC.

as, e.g., interviews would be not only laborious to carry out, 
but also expected to suffer from the same biases.

Emotional  abuse  increased  the  risk  for  FOC  both  in 
nulli- and multiparous women, whereas emotional neglect 
and a greater total burden of childhood trauma increased 
the risk only in nulliparous women. In a previous study, the 
effects of emotional abuse and experiencing any abuse on 
FOC were smaller in multiparous women, although the risk 
was increased in both parity groups (Lukasse et al. 2010). 
This different effect of childhood trauma on nulli- and mul-
tiparous women might reflect that women with proneness 
to anxiety might feel fear before their first labor due to lack 
of experience, but feel more confidence during the subse-
quent pregnancies as they already have experience of the 
childbirth. Moreover, in multiparous women, the previous 
birth experiences can affect the expectations and fear regard-
ing childbirth (Saisto, Ylikorkala, and Halmesmäki 1999). 
Accordingly, a previous study found an association between 
anxiety-prone  personality  and  FOC  only  in  nulliparous 
women (Jokić-Begić, Žigić, and Radoš 2014).

Our results show that childhood trauma is related to FOC. 
Previous research on the subject is scarce and our study 
considers, besides abuse, also neglect. On the basis of the 
present results, history of childhood trauma should be rec-
ognized in maternity health care. The effect of childhood 
trauma was stronger in nulliparous women, and therefore 
they could especially benefit from screening of childhood 
traumas when treated for FOC. Adults who have been trau-
matized in their childhood are prone to have a more inse-
cure attachment style (Fuchshuber et al. 2019), may find it 
difficult to depend on others, and consequently, have more 
difficulties in creating and preserving trust in health care 
personnel. Women with FOC often have challenges trust-
ing, besides their own coping during birth, also health care 
personnel managing their prenatal care and delivery (Slade 
et al. 2019; Sjögren 1997). Of the covariates, multiparity 
appeared to be an important factor suggesting previous birth 
experiences should be paid attention to.

Strengths and limitations

Previous negative birth experiences and adverse pregnancy 
outcomes can increase FOC. Therefore, it would have been 
interesting to know how these might have affected the results. 
Unfortunately, no information on previous birth experiences, 
outcomes, or previous FOC diagnoses were available. In addi-
tion, we did not have information on other potentially trau-
matic adulthood events, such as intimate partner violence, 
or all mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress 
disorder that may affect FOC. However, because these factors 
can be affected by childhood trauma, rather than the opposite, 
they cannot be considered as confounders.

As nulli- and multiparous women have different reasons 
behind their FOC, we performed the analyses, besides to the 
whole population, also separately to nulli- and multiparous 
women. However, as the number of primiparous women with 
FOC was small, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Conclusions

Emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and a greater total burden 
of childhood trauma increased the risk for FOC after taking 
into account maternal age, childhood socioeconomic status, 
and parity. Recognizing the special characteristics of women 
with a history of trauma could help to develop more individ-
ualized and effective interventions. Further, information on 
women’s history of childhood trauma could help encounter 
and understand them better. Prevention of childhood neglect 
and abuse could decrease FOC as well as other psychical bur-
den throughout the life. Information on childhood traumatic 
events was inquired in retrospect and therefore the events could 
be recalled falsely. This should be taken into account when 
interpreting our results.

Declarations 

One of the strengths of our study was that the women who 
were diagnosed with FOC suffered from clinically severe 
FOC. We were able to link information from two national 
registers to our data, and therefore, to use information from 
multiple  sources.  However,  some  limitations  should  be 
acknowledged. As childhood traumatic events were inquired 
in retrospect, they could be recalled falsely. Current FOC could 
distort the recalled experiences to be more negative. This is 
a well-acknowledged limitation in studies using retrospective 
self-reports. On the other hand, this approach is the only fea-
sible means of assessing childhood adversity retrospectively,
