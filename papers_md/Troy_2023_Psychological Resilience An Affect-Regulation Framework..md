Abstract

Exposure to adversity (e.g., poverty, bereavement) is a robust predictor of disruptions in 
psychological functioning. However, people vary greatly in their responses to adversity; 
some experience severe long-term disruptions, others experience minimal disruptions or even 
improvements. We refer to the latter outcomes—faring better than expected given adversity—as 
psychological resilience. Understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical 
and practical implications. Yet, psychology’s understanding of resilience is incomplete, for 
two reasons: (a) We lack conceptual clarity, and (b) two major approaches to resilience—the 
stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach—have limitations 
and are relatively isolated from one another. To address these two obstacles, we first discuss 
conceptual questions about resilience. Next, we offer an integrative affect-regulation framework 
that capitalizes on complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework advances our 
understanding of resilience by integrating existing findings, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and 
guiding future research.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

Exposure to adversity—circumstances such as poverty or life events such as job loss, serious 
injury, or bereavement—is a robust predictor of disruptions in psychological functioning. 
Importantly, however, people vary greatly in the extent to which exposure to adversity leads 
to such disruptions (Bonanno et al. 2015, Masten 2018, Rutter 2006): While some people 
experience severe long-term disruptions, others show few or no long-term disruptions, or 
even improvement. Take, for example, two people who lose a loved one. After initial shock 
and grief, one person might continue to feel strong distress, hopelessness, and depression 
lasting several years. In contrast, a second person might experience the same initial shock 
and grief in the weeks following the loss; yet, they might soon begin to recover and, within 
some months, experience sadness but no lasting depression, and even feel an increased sense 
of meaning and life satisfaction. We refer to the latter outcomes—faring better than would 
be expected in a given cultural context—as psychological resilience.

What psychological processes explain resilience? Answers to this question are of significant 
theoretical importance in that they advance our basic understanding of the vast range of 
responses that people exhibit to adversity. In addition, given that adversity is an unavoidable 
fact of human life that places staggering burdens on individuals and societies, answers to 
this question have enormous practical importance inasmuch as they point to targets for 
increasing resilience. In the past few decades, psychological research on the processes that 
explain resilience has come from two major sources: the stress and coping approach and 
the emotion and emotion-regulation approach (Compas et al. 2017, Gross 2015, Lazarus 
2000), henceforth referred to as the coping approach and the emotion-regulation approach, 
respectively. Each approach has yielded important insights. However, our understanding of 
resilience has been limited by two key obstacles. First, research on resilience has been 
slowed by lack of conceptual clarity. Second, the coping and emotion-regulation approaches 
each have limitations, and there has been a relative lack of cross-talk between the two. We 
address each of these obstacles in turn.

First, to contribute to conceptual clarity, we review six core questions encountered in 
research on resilience and provide an overview of the conceptual space by considering 
various ways these questions could be answered. We then locate our own approach 
within this conceptual space. Second, to integrate and build on the coping and the emotion-
regulation approaches, we adopt an affect-regulation framework. This framework capitalizes 
on the complementary strengths of the coping and emotion-regulation approaches, organizes 
past findings, identifies gaps in existing knowledge, and helps guide future research.

CONCEPTUAL CONSIDERATIONS IN RESILIENCE

As noted by others, “the theoretical and research literature on resilience reflects 
little consensus about definitions, with substantial variations in operationalization and 
measurement of key constructs” (Luthar et al. 2000, p. 544; see also Bonanno et al. 2015, 
Hiebel et al. 2021, Kalisch et al. 2015). Increasing conceptual clarity helps to resolve 
disagreements, summarize and synthesize research findings, identify the best methods 
and measures for particular research questions, identify crucial gaps in understanding and

important next steps for research, and develop theories to programmatically articulate and 
test new hypotheses. To further these goals, we begin by laying out the conceptual space of 
resilience.

The Conceptual Space of Resilience

In Table 1, we delineate six key questions that researchers encounter when thinking about 
resilience, possible answers to these questions, and how we have answered these questions.

The first question focuses on the level of analysis for resilience: As indicated in the first row 
of Table 1, the level of analysis can be individuals, groups (e.g., a family), and communities 
(e.g., a neighborhood, city, or country). While psychological research on resilience has often 
focused on individuals, there is increasing attention to groups and communities (Bonanno 
et al. 2015, Hall & Zautra 2010, Masten & Motti-Stefanidi 2020). Although these levels 
interact with and influence one another (Masten & Motti-Stefanidi 2020), resilience at one 
level does not imply resilience at another level (cf. Bonanno et al. 2015). Thus, an increasing 
number of researchers have adopted a systems approach, which involves conceptualizing 
resilience as the dynamic interplay among individual, family, and community levels (Hall & 
Zautra 2010, Masten & Motti-Stefanidi 2020).

The second question concerns the role of adversity in resilience. As shown in the second 
row of Table 1, this question can be answered in a number of ways. In some cases, 
resilience is conceptualized as a relatively stable trait that is present and measurable even 
in the absence of adversity (Block & Kremen 1996). In other cases, resilience is thought to 
occur only in response to adversity; that is, some type of adversity must be experienced to 
observe resilience (Bonanno et al. 2015, Compas et al. 2017, Kalisch et al. 2015). When 
adversity is considered, it needs to be defined. This is all the more necessary given that there 
are deep differences in how this can be done. One of the most consequential distinctions 
is between defining adversity in objective terms (e.g., events such as poverty, disaster, 
bereavement; Holman & Silver 1998, Masten & Motti-Stefanidi 2020) versus subjective 
terms (e.g., individuals’ appraisals that an event was adverse; Epel et al. 2018, Lazarus et al. 
1985). Additionally, adversity can vary along dimensions such as intensity, timing, duration, 
controllability, globality, threat, and deprivation (Epel et al. 2018, McLaughlin & Sheridan 
2016, Troy et al. 2013) and across types of events (e.g., bereavement, trauma; Lucas 2007), 
and we have to be clear about these distinctions and whether they matter. In sum, what 
constitutes or predicts resilience in one context may not do the same in another.

As shown in the third row of Table 1, the third question focuses on the nature of resilience 
(see Hiebel et al. 2021). Three main conceptualizations have been offered. First, resilience 
can be considered as a factor, or a relatively stable trait, that exists both in the presence 
and in the absence of adversity. For example, trait resilience has been conceptualized 
as the stable predisposition to adapt to change (Block & Kremen 1996, Waugh et al. 
2008). Second, resilience can be considered as a process or a set of processes, such as 
capacities or resources that are deployed in response to adversity and allow individuals to 
withstand ongoing demands and maintain functioning. As described by Schetter & Dolbier 
(2011), resilience processes can include social (e.g., social support) and psychological 
(e.g., cognitive and behavioral strategies, including coping and emotion regulation) aspects.

Third, resilience can be considered as an outcome, such as maintained or high functioning 
following adversity (Kalisch et al. 2015, Masten 2018). In turn, functioning can be indicated 
in a variety of ways. At the level of the individual, indices of resilience include well-
being; psychological health; levels of psychopathology; number of symptoms; presence of 
diagnoses; academic, occupational, or social achievements; or accomplishing developmental 
milestones. At the level of groups and communities, indices of resilience include social and 
economic infrastructure and resources relating to education and human development (Hall 
& Zautra 2010). Resilience established by one indicator (e.g., academic achievement) does 
not necessarily imply resilience established by another indicator (e.g., psychological health) 
(Infurna 2020, Luthar et al. 2000), and it is thus important to be clear about the indicator of 
functioning that is used.

Questions four through six (rows 4–6 of Table 1) concern the criteria by which resilience is 
established—that is, how we determine that an individual, group, or community is resilient. 
These three criteria-related questions can be understood in terms of a graph with a y-axis 
depicting functioning and an x-axis depicting time. We illustrate these questions in Figure 
1 with regard to resilience outcomes, but they could be articulated for resilience factors or 
processes as well.

Question four (Table 1, row 4) asks what criterion for functioning is applied to determine 
resilience. In other words, at what point on the y-axis is an individual, group, or community 
considered resilient? A range of criteria could be used. First, one could set the criterion 
as meeting an absolute point such as scoring above or below a particular threshold (e.g., 
falling below the diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder; Bonanno 2004, Waugh 
et al. 2008). Alternatively, resilience could be conceptualized in relative terms, that is, as 
high functioning relative to others who experienced similar adversity (Korol et al. 2002), 
relative to others who did not experience adversity (Jaffee et al. 2007), relative to oneself 
(e.g., returning to one’s pre-adversity levels of functioning; Infurna 2020, Lucas 2007), or 
relative to expectations given a particular cultural context and particular adversity (Luthar et 
al. 2000). In each case, one can conceptualize resilience as categorical (e.g., resilient versus 
not resilient) or continuous (for discussions, see Bonanno et al. 2015, Hiebel et al. 2021).

Questions five and six regard the x-axis, or, timing. As addressed in the fifth row of Table 
1, first we need to ask what criterion for trajectory is applied to determine resilience. In 
other words, at what time point relative to adversity onset does resilience emerge? In some 
cases, such as in factor conceptualizations, resilience is thought to be observable at any 
point in time (Tugade & Fredrickson 2004, Waugh et al. 2008). If resilience is thought of as 
varying in time, one could decide that resilience must emerge during or immediately after 
encountering adversity (Bonanno et al. 2015, Kimhi et al. 2021). For example, to be resilient 
someone might have to exhibit greater functioning immediately after encountering adversity. 
At the other end of the continuum, one could presume that to be resilient, an individual, 
group, or community simply needs to show higher functioning at any point in their lives, 
which could be years or decades after experiencing adversity (Infurna 2020, Korol et al. 
2002, Rutter 2006). For example, to be resilient someone might have to exhibit greater 
functioning 2 years after encountering adversity. As addressed in the sixth row of Table 1, 
we also need to ask what criterion for duration is applied to resilience. In other words, how

long must indicators of resilience be present for someone to be considered resilient? There 
is a similarly wide range of possibilities here, ranging from a brief moment (Waugh et al. 
2008) to years or even decades (Jaffee et al. 2007).

As Table 1 indicates, the key conceptual questions investigators encounter when thinking 
about resilience have been answered in a wide variety of ways (Kalisch et al. 2015). In our 
view, there is no single right answer; rather, one’s answers will depend on one’s research 
question and aims. However, it is crucial that researchers clearly state their position on each 
question (Luthar et al. 2000). We summarize our own position in the third column of Table 
1.

Our Conceptual Approach to Resilience

With regard to the first question (Table 1, row 1), we are interested in understanding 
how individuals adapt to adversity. Thus, our unit of analysis is the individual. However, 
we emphasize that all individuals are embedded within groups, communities, and cultural 
contexts that influence individual experiences and resilience, thus underscoring the 
importance of the interplay between different levels of analysis.

Next (Table 1, row 2), we conceptualize resilience as occurring in response to adversity. In 
turn, we define adversity as circumstances or events that many people in a given cultural 
context would expect to tax or exceed their resources and that have the potential to disrupt 
functioning. We focus on circumstances and events that are expected to disrupt functioning 
at least to a moderate extent and at least for a moderate amount of time (i.e., lasting a 
minimum of hours, days, or weeks). This definition of adversity (a) excludes events and 
circumstances that are very unlikely to affect functioning (e.g., a one-time, transient, mild 
event); (b) includes a wide range of circumstances and events (e.g., poverty, job loss, 
divorce, terrorist attacks, or global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic), including those 
that might not be considered adverse for all people and in all cultural contexts (e.g., a 
wedding, a move); (c) avoids concerns about circularity (i.e., adversity is what adversely 
affects a person) by using a consensus criterion rather than an individual-based subjective 
criterion; and (d) avoids the difficulty of establishing an entirely objective criterion by using 
people’s appraisals instead (i.e., what most people expect to potentially disrupt functioning). 
Thus, our definition of adversity is broad and allows for the examination of resilience across 
a wide range of adverse contexts. Lastly, we believe that particular features of adversity 
(e.g., intensity, timing, duration, controllability, and globality) shape resilience and thus need 
to be considered.

Third (Table 1, row 3), we focus on resilience as an outcome and are interested in which 
factors and processes predict resilience outcomes. In terms of which outcomes we consider, 
we focus on psychological health outcomes, which we characterize comprehensively along 
the dimensions of ill-being (e.g., depression) and well-being (e.g., life satisfaction). Thus, 
resilience can encompass lack of ill-being and/or presence of well-being.

In terms of applying a criterion for functioning (Table 1, row 4)—that is, where on the y-axis 
of Figure 1 one is considered to be resilient—we define resilience in relative terms, whereby 
a person exhibiting relatively little disruption in functioning is resilient. As depicted in

the green shading of Figure 1, someone could exhibit high levels of psychological health, 
moderate levels of psychological health, or even some disruptions in psychological health 
and still be considered resilient because they exhibit less disruption than would be expected 
within a given cultural context for a particular adversity. This approach is based on the 
notion that cultural contexts differ in their understanding of what constitutes adversity and 
functioning (Hiebel et al. 2021). At the same time, this perspective is maximally inclusive of 
what is considered resilience, thus allowing us to speak to the maximum range of predictors 
of resilience. As indicated by the graded green and red backgrounds in Figure 1, we 
assume people to fall along a continuum of more versus less resilient outcomes rather than 
into discrete types. This expectation is driven by the observation that psychological health 
indicators (e.g., depression, satisfaction with life) are generally best described as continua 
(Kalisch et al. 2015).

Last, we consider when resilience outcomes must first appear relative to adversity onset 
(Table 1, row 5) and for how long they must be present (Table 1, row 6). Here we adopt 
a broad view, which allows us to be inclusive in our consideration of resilience. More 
specifically, in our view, resilience can first emerge during, immediately after, or any time 
after the onset of adversity. Most (but not all) people experience an initial, and at times 
prolonged, decrease in psychological health after experiencing adversity, and this initial 
decrease in health does not preclude the possibility of resilience according to our criteria. 
In terms of duration, we define resilience as a relatively lasting outcome (e.g., absence 
of lasting depression) rather than a short-term one (e.g., absence of transient depressed 
mood). While there is no discrete boundary defining what constitutes a lasting outcome (as 
indicated by the graded shading in Figure 1), an outcome should last at least 1 week to be 
distinguished from, for instance, a transient mood.

PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO EXPLAINING RESILIENCE

Now that we have reviewed the conceptual space of resilience and made explicit our location 
in it, we turn to the primary question that motivates this article: What psychological 
processes explain resilience? Two major research approaches have provided important 
insights into this question: the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-
regulation approach. We next describe each approach, highlighting their unique features, 
contributions, and limitations. We then present an affect-regulation framework that integrates 
the two approaches.

The Stress and Coping Approach

Research on coping with stress was guided by the pioneering work of Lazarus, Folkman, 
and others, who emphasized the transactions between the person and the environment 
(Folkman 1984, Lazarus 1993). Lazarus & Folkman (1984, p. 19) defined stress as the 
“relationship between the person and the environment that is appraised by the person as 
taxing or exceeding [their] resources and endangering [their] well-being.” This highlights 
the idea that aspects of an individual (i.e., appraisal) interact with aspects of the environment 
(i.e., a stressor), and together they give rise to stress responses (changes in subjective 
experience, cognition, behavior, and physiology; Epel et al. 2018). When encountering

stressors, people often engage in coping, “a person’s ongoing efforts in thought and action” 
to manage stressors and stress responses (Lazarus 1993, p. 8). From this perspective, to 
explain resilience we must understand what constitutes adaptive coping.

Four key features, summarized in Table 2, characterize research following the coping 
approach. The first feature is grounded in a stress framework, from which stems a 
naturalistic perspective that aims to capture the richness of people’s stressors and their 
responses to them. While early research involved experiments in animals in order to 
delineate the biological underpinnings of the stress response (for a review, see Szabo 
et al. 2012), contemporary research has examined a wide range of real-world stressors 
such as chronic illness and caregiving (e.g., Moskowitz et al. 1996), bereavement (e.g., 
Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 1994), and natural disasters (e.g., Holman & Silver 1998) outside 
the laboratory. Within this stress framework, individuals’ stress responses are typically 
conceived of as negative in valence and encompassing multiple response domains including 
experience, behavior, cognition, and physiology (Delongis et al. 1988, Lazarus & Folkman 
1984, Moskowitz et al. 1996). In addition, the coping approach has often examined both 
psychological (e.g., affective experience) as well as biological (e.g., immune function, 
hormones) mechanisms of resilience outcomes (Epel et al. 1998). This approach has also 
examined the relationships between coping and a wide range of resilience outcomes, 
including psychological health (e.g., depression, well-being) and physical health (e.g., 
symptoms of illness; Epel et al. 1998).

The second key feature of the coping approach is its interest in comprehensively studying 
a wide range of real-world coping strategies. For example, one of the most commonly 
used measures, the Brief COPE, measures 13 different strategies (Carver 1997). In their 
review, Skinner and colleagues (2003) delineated 400 coping strategies that had been 
measured in research. Given how difficult it is to study and understand such a large number 
of strategies, researchers have sought to derive broader dimensions of coping (Carver 
& Connor-Smith 2010, Compas et al. 2017). Although there is no final consensus on 
broader coping dimensions, three of the most commonly used classification systems include 
problem-focused versus emotion-focused coping (i.e., targeting a situation versus one’s 
emotions; Folkman & Lazarus 1980), approach versus avoidance coping (engaging actively 
with versus avoiding an adverse event; Carver & Connor-Smith 2010), and cognitive versus 
behavioral coping (changing thoughts versus changing behaviors; Skinner et al. 2003). Of 
these three, the distinction between problem-focused and emotion-focused coping is the 
most utilized (Lazarus 1993, Skinner et al. 2003); however, research in this area often 
emphasizes the idea that problem- and emotion-focused coping are not mutually exclusive 
(Carver & Connor-Smith 2010, Folkman & Lazarus 1980, Lazarus 1999).

A third key feature of the coping approach stems from its transactional view, whereby the 
context within which coping occurs is explicitly considered. This emphasis leads to the 
idea that no particular coping strategy is inherently adaptive or maladaptive. Instead, the 
adaptiveness of coping strategies is shaped by the context in which they are used (Folkman 
& Lazarus 1980), and resilience is more likely to occur when there is greater fit between 
specific features of the stressors and the type of coping deployed (Cheng et al. 2014, Park 
et al. 2004). For example, people who use problem-focused coping in response to relatively

uncontrollable adversity report higher levels of psychological symptoms compared to those 
who use problem-focused coping in response to relatively controllable adversity (Forsythe 
& Compas 1987, Park et al. 2001). In these ways, the coping approach has emphasized 
the importance of context and has sought to characterize and empirically study its role in 
shaping resilience.

Fourth, methodologically, with some early exceptions (e.g., Lazarus & Opton 1966), the 
methods used in coping research have typically followed its naturalistic emphasis on real-
life stressors and responses to them, and they have often utilized field studies and self-report 
surveys to assess the naturalistic use of coping in response to stressors (Austenfeld & 
Stanton 2004, Lazarus 2000, Moskowitz et al. 1996). Finally, the coping approach has relied 
on longitudinal studies that allow for the examination of long-term relationships between 
coping and resilience (Austenfeld & Stanton 2004, Lazarus 2000). Taken as a whole, this 
naturalistic approach has produced findings with high ecological validity that provide a rich 
view of how coping is linked with resilience across a wide variety of adverse events, coping 
strategies, mechanisms, and indicators of resilience.

At the same time, the coping approach has limitations. First, within the context of the stress 
framework, some have noted that defining stressors via individuals’ subjective appraisals 
can lead to tautology of stressor and stress response (Epel et al. 2018, Lazarus et al. 
1985). In addition, the stress framework typically considers stressors and stress responses 
as being broadly negative in valence, while neglecting discrete emotional states (Lazarus 
1993, Lerner et al. 2015). Second, while the broad categories of coping described above are 
comprehensive, they also contain heterogeneous coping strategies that may exert different 
short-term effects and, in turn, differentially predict resilience (Carver et al. 1989). In other 
words, the categories of, for example, problem- and emotion-focused coping might be too 
broad. At the same time, the potential differential effects of strategies within these broader 
categories have not been systematically and comprehensively examined, in part because 
different researchers have identified different strategies as important (see Skinner et al. 
2003) and have used different measures with different items and definitions, making them 
difficult to organize and synthesize (Austenfeld & Stanton 2004, Compas et al. 2017). Thus, 
comprehensiveness and breadth result in trade-offs in terms of focus and specificity. Third, 
although the coping approach has yielded findings high in ecological validity, the use of 
correlational, self-report methods to assess coping can limit the internal validity of key 
findings and lacks precision regarding how processes unfold in time.

The Emotion and Emotion-Regulation Approach

The emotion-regulation approach emerged in the 1990s, in part as an outgrowth of the 
coping approach (Gross 1999, 2015). Although debates about the definition of emotion 
remain (Barrett 2006), a consensus has emerged that defines emotion as a response to 
any stimulus involving a valuation (e.g., good for me or bad for me) that involves loosely 
coupled changes in subjective experience, cognition, behavior, and peripheral physiology 
that unfold over a relatively short period of time (Epel et al. 2018, Gross 2015). Emotion 
regulation has been defined as attempts to influence which emotions people have, when 
they have them, and how they experience or express them (Gross 1998, 2015). While the

emotion-regulation approach is broad in terms of considering emotions across different 
situations and stimuli, this approach is relevant to resilience in that people regulate the 
emotions they experience in response to adversity, which, in turn, is heavily implicated in 
their functioning (Aldao et al. 2010, Compas et al. 2017, Troy & Mauss 2011). From this 
perspective, to explain resilience we must understand what constitutes adaptive emotion 
regulation (e.g., Troy & Mauss 2011).

Four key features of the emotion-regulation approach are summarized in Table 2. First, its 
roots in an emotion framework lead this approach to consider both positively and negatively 
valenced emotional states (Russell & Barrett 1999, Tellegen et al. 1999); distinguish among 
discrete emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anxiety (Levenson 2011); and consider 
changes in multiple response domains that include experience, behavior, cognition, and 
physiology (Mauss et al. 2005). In addition, this approach has typically considered the 
psychological mechanisms of resilience outcomes (e.g., affective experience; Troy & Mauss 
2011), and has often examined resilience outcomes in terms of psychological health (e.g., 
depression, anxiety; Aldao et al. 2010). The second key feature of the emotion-regulation 
approach is that it typically involves conceptually grounded distinctions among a relatively 
small number of well-defined families of emotion-regulation strategies. For example, the 
process model of emotion regulation distinguishes among families of emotion regulation 
based on which aspect of the emotion-generation process is targeted (Gross 1998, 2015). 
According to the process model, emotional responses arise as the result of the particular 
features of a situation one encounters, of how one directs one’s attention toward or away 
from particular stimuli, and of how one appraises stimuli. From this perspective, each of 
the elements involved in generating an emotional response—situation, attention, appraisals
—and the emotional response itself can become targets for emotion regulation (Gross 1998, 
2015). Situation change involves choosing or avoiding situations (referred to as situation 
selection) as well as altering situations (referred to as situation modification) (Livingstone 
& Isaacowitz 2015). Attentional deployment involves directing one’s attention toward or 
away from particular features of a situation (Sheppes et al. 2014). Cognitive change involves 
changing one’s interpretations or appraisals of a situation (Gross 1998, Troy & Mauss 2011). 
Finally, response modification involves changing one’s emotional response (including its 
behavioral, experiential, and physiological components) once the emotional response has 
begun to unfold (Gross 1998). Importantly, the process model of emotion regulation allows 
one to categorize emotion-regulation families and to make predictions about their short-term 
consequences (Gross 1998) and longer-term correlates with functioning (Aldao et al. 2010). 
Thus, the emotion-regulation approach has generated knowledge high in specificity and 
focuses on a small number of conceptually derived strategies.

A third key feature of the emotion-regulation approach emerges in contrast to the coping 
approach and its emphasis on transactions with the context. Instead, this approach has 
typically focused on understanding the main effects of particular emotion-regulation 
strategies on key outcomes without explicitly considering the context. In particular, this 
approach has studied the effects of emotion regulation with regard to a wide range of 
outcomes such as subjective experience, behavior, physiology, well-being, health, and 
relationship outcomes (Aldao et al. 2010, DeSteno et al. 2013, John & Gross 2004, Troy 
& Mauss 2011, Webb et al. 2012). This focus has led to an emphasis on understanding main

effects of particular regulatory strategies at the individual level, such as when benefits of 
reappraisal in general are contrasted to the disadvantages of suppression in general, without 
explicitly considering context (Gross & John 2003, Richards & Gross 2000).

Fourth, with some exceptions (e.g., John & Gross 2004, Srivastava et al. 2009), emotion-
regulation researchers emphasize experimental designs and laboratory approaches to 
examine the causal effects of particular emotion-regulation strategies (Webb et al. 2012). 
These investigations have included measures of self-reported experience of emotions as well 
as autonomic-physiological, neural, behavioral, social, and peer-rated responses, and they 
often examine temporally fine-grained dynamic processes (Butler et al. 2003, Gross 1998, 
Kalokerinos et al. 2017, Mendes et al. 2003, Sheppes et al. 2014, Troy et al. 2018). Taken 
together, these studies constitute a corpus of findings high in internal validity and temporal 
precision, which allow researchers to draw causal conclusions about the short-term effects of 
particular regulatory strategies on a wide range of outcomes.

The emotion-regulation approach also has limitations. First, there has been much less 
consideration of real-life adversity, limiting ecological validity. In addition, while many 
studies have examined psychological health as a key outcome, there has been much less 
consideration of physical health outcomes in comparison with the coping approach (cf. 
DeSteno et al. 2013). Second, although the process model can in theory accommodate a 
large number of emotion-regulation strategies, there has been a narrower empirical emphasis 
on reappraisal and suppression, often to the exclusion of other emotion-regulation strategies 
such as situation change, which limits comprehensiveness and breadth (Webb et al. 2012). 
Similarly, relatively fewer studies have examined spontaneously deployed (rather than 
instructed) emotion-regulation strategies outside of the laboratory (for recent exceptions, 
see Blanke et al. 2020, Grommisch et al. 2020). Third, there has historically been less 
emphasis on understanding transactions between emotion regulation and context, with little 
research explicitly considering adversity and interactions with features of adversity (cf. 
Aldao 2013, Bonanno & Burton 2013, Doré et al. 2016). Although recently there has been 
a growing emphasis on the importance of context, this recognition has appeared primarily 
in theorizing, with empirical work lagging behind (Aldao 2013, Sheppes 2020). Fourth, 
because the emotion-regulation approach has emphasized the immediate consequences of 
specific regulatory strategies, there have been relatively fewer investigations of the longer-
term implications of emotion regulation (Gross 2015, Sheppes 2020).

An Integrative Affect-Regulation Framework for Resilience

Although the coping and emotion-regulation approaches have been critical in generating 
insights into resilience, each approach has its limitations. Compounding these limitations, 
there has been little cross-talk between the two approaches (Compas et al. 2017, John & 
Eng 2014). Indeed, over two decades ago, Lazarus (1999, p. 35) wrote: “Scholars and 
scientists concerned with stress and coping research and theory tend not to know or cite 
emotion research and theory, and vice versa. This separation of fields is an absurdity.” The 
persistence of this problem has led to siloing that has slowed the generation, consolidation, 
and application of knowledge about resilience.

One path forward is to integrate these approaches and unite the two research communities 
by building on their shared theoretical foundations. Critically, both approaches are grounded 
in the idea that affect is a crucial aspect of people’s responses to adversity and a key part 
of what makes adversity potentially harmful. Affect has been defined as any response to an 
internal or external stimulus that involves valuation (e.g., “Is this good for me or bad for 
me?”). Affect is thus a superordinate concept that includes stress responses and emotions, 
as well as other phenomena such as impulses and mood (Compas et al. 2017, Epel et 
al. 2018, Gross 2015, Marroquin et al. 2017). Furthermore, both approaches rest on the 
notion that, although affective responses to adversity can intuitively appear overwhelming 
and unalterable, they rarely—if ever —simply happen to people. In fact, according to 
both approaches, people engage in efforts to change the adversity they encounter and their 
affective responses to it: They regulate their affect (Compas et al. 2017). In turn, affect 
regulation (a superordinate term that includes both coping and emotion regulation, among 
others) provides a key to explaining resilience: Affect regulation allows people to agentically 
change how they respond to adversity and the trajectory they are on, either away from or 
toward resilience (see Figure 1).

The view that (a) both coping and emotion regulation are types of affect regulation and 
(b) affect regulation is a key to explaining resilience allows us to integrate the coping and 
the emotion-regulation approaches. By adopting an integrative affect-regulation framework, 
we can draw upon the unique strengths of both approaches. For example, we can adopt 
the coping approach’s strong naturalistic emphasis on understanding real-world adversity 
and transactions with context, while also leveraging the important contributions of the 
process model of emotion regulation and its emphasis on conceptually derived families 
of regulation. This framework organizes and consolidates existing empirical insights and 
guides future research that capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches, leading to 
increased collaboration across approaches and more comprehensive knowledge. Below, we 
describe three key features of an integrative affect-regulation framework, including that it 
(a) distinguishes among conceptually motivated affect-regulation strategies, (b) delineates 
profiles of short-term consequences of these strategies in multiple domains, and (c) predicts 
the longer-term implications of each strategy for resilience based on its profile of short-term 
consequences as well as the context in which it is used (see Figure 2).

First, drawing on the emotion-regulation approach, we distinguish among families of 
affect-regulation strategies based on which aspect of the affect-generation process they 
target (Gross 2015). Thus, we distinguish four families of affect-regulation strategies: 
situation change, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. These 
distinctions make it possible to capture important differences in short-term consequences as 
well as in implications for resilience without being so nuanced as to be unmanageable.

Second, as indicated in Figure 2, drawing on both approaches, we characterize affect-
regulation strategies in terms of their short-term consequences for multiple domains 
that, accumulating over time, have critical implications for resilience. These include the 
domains of affective experience (including both negative and positive affective experiences; 
Moskowitz et al. 1996, Rankin & Sweeny 2022, Wang et al. 2021), affective behavior 
(Bonanno et al. 2004, Gross 1998), autonomic physiology (McRae et al. 2010, Mendes et

al. 2003), social processes (including social responsiveness, closeness, connection, liking, 
social support, and satisfaction with interactions; Butler et al. 2003, Lazarus & Folkman 
1984, Marroquin et al. 2017), cognitive effort (the amount of effort needed to implement 
an affect-regulation strategy; Troy et al. 2018), and engagement (awareness of, behavioral 
engagement with, and learning from adversity; Nes et al. 2005). To explain resilience, we 
must consider more than a single type of short-term consequence. To date, much of the 
research on short-term consequences has focused on affective experience (Webb et al. 2012). 
This limits what we know about other types of short-term consequences (e.g., behavior, 
engagement) as well as about how profiles of multiple short-term consequences jointly 
shape resilience. For example, if a situation-change strategy decreases the experience of 
negative affect but at the same time impairs social processes, this strategy could, on the 
whole, decrease resilience. Thus, a critical point of the integrative framework is that it is the 
profile of multiple short-term consequences, rather than a single type alone, that determines 
resilience, with different types of short-term consequences interacting with or counteracting 
one another.

Another critical point is that the framework distinguishes between short-term consequences 
and resilience. The distinction between short-term consequences and resilience outcomes 
can appear somewhat blurry, as is the case when a cognitive-change strategy produces 
repeated episodes of positive affective experience. However, short-term consequences and 
resilience differ in two important ways. First, they differ in timescale. Short-term means that 
the consequences play out on the level of minutes to hours, as a direct consequence of an 
instance of affect regulation. This is distinct from resilience outcomes, which can begin to 
emerge at any time after the onset of adversity but must last 1 week or longer to allow us 
to speak of an outcome rather than a transient state (i.e., a period of stable and relatively 
high satisfaction with life rather than a momentary positive affect). Second, the two differ 
conceptually such that, as indicated next, a particular short-term consequence might lead to 
resilience in one context but not in another.

A third key feature of the integrative framework draws on the naturalistic perspective of the 
coping approach and its emphasis on the transaction between the person and the situation 
(see Figure 2). Based on this idea, the use of affect-regulation strategies, their short-term 
consequences, and the relationships between affect regulation and resilience all depend 
on the context. As depicted in Figure 2, context can be considered in two ways. First, 
more narrowly, we can consider features of adversity (as shown in the darker gray box of 
Figure 2). These include intensity (e.g., from low-intensity events to life-threatening trauma; 
Bonanno et al. 2015), timing and duration (i.e., early versus later in life, acute versus 
chronic; Epel et al. 2018), controllability (how much one can influence whether and how an 
event unfolds; Haines et al. 2016, Troy et al. 2013), globality of life domains affected by 
the adversity (e.g., work, family, health, finances; Epel et al. 2018), and dimensions of threat 
and deprivation (McLaughlin & Sheridan 2016). As depicted in Figure 2, these features of 
adversity can influence affect regulation, the short-term consequences of affect regulation, 
and the relationships between affect regulation and resilience.

Beyond features of adversity, features of the context more broadly also play a foundational 
role (Aldao 2013, Masten & Motti-Stefanidi 2020). The broader context can be understood

as a person’s culture, society, community, social group (e.g., based on race, gender, age, or 
socioeconomic status), and family as well as the affordances, practices, values, and beliefs 
they engender (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci 1994, Markus & Kitayama 1991, Masten & Motti-
Stefanidi 2020, Mesquita 2001). The broader context is relevant to resilience in that, as 
depicted in Figure 2 by the larger box that encompasses all other aspects of our framework, 
it powerfully shapes the adverse events people experience as well as affect regulation, 
the short-term consequences of affect regulation, and its implications for resilience, and it 
also determines what constitutes adversity and resilience in the first place. These effects 
are generated by influences of the context on affordances (e.g., are people compelled to 
suppress their affect?), practices (e.g., which affect-regulation strategies do people use?), 
values (e.g., do people value affect expression?), and beliefs (e.g., do people believe they can 
change their affect?) relating to affect regulation. Thus, in addition to features of adversity, 
the broader context is another important layer that can powerfully influence all aspects of 
affect regulation and its links with resilience, leading to three-way interactions in which the 
broader context can interact with both adversity and affect regulation to shape resilience.

In sum, the integrative affect-regulation framework considers a comprehensive range 
of conceptually derived affect-regulation strategies. In the integrative affect-regulation 
framework, the effects of affect-regulation strategies on resilience cannot be understood 
solely through their short-term consequences in a single domain, and they are not inherently 
good or bad for resilience. Instead, whether a strategy increases or decreases resilience is 
determined by the profile of its short-term consequences in conjunction with features of 
adversity and the broader context. Next, we review recent empirical findings that illustrate 
this framework.

AN AFFECT-REGULATION FRAMEWORK FOR RESILIENCE: EMPIRICAL 

FINDINGS

In this selective review, we survey recent findings that speak to the affect-regulation 
framework and illustrate how the framework can be useful in organizing existing findings. 
We consider both correlational and experimental research from both the coping and the 
emotion-regulation approaches. For each family of affect-regulation strategies, we highlight 
one strategy that has received ample empirical attention. Although affect-regulation 
strategies can be used with the goal of increasing or decreasing either negative or positive 
affect (Gross 2015, Tamir 2016), to date, the vast majority of research has focused 
on decreasing negative or increasing positive affect (Webb et al. 2012). This is thus 
our primary focus in our review. For each strategy, we review short-term consequences 
for affective experiences and social processes. We focus on these two domains (rather 
than behavior, autonomic physiology, cognitive effort, or engagement) because they 
have received particular attention. After reviewing short-term consequences, we review 
implications for resilience. At times, when little or no evidence is available that explicitly 
examines the affect-regulation strategy in the context of adversity, we rely on research 
that examines implications for psychological health in general, making the assumption 
that greater psychological health implies greater resilience. We conclude each section by

illustrating how features of adversity and the broader context moderate the relationship 
between affect regulation and resilience, selecting one example in each case.

Situation Change

Situation change acts on the affect-eliciting situation to change its impact (Gross 2015). 
For example, one can attend a close friend’s birthday party (situation selection) to increase 
experience of positive affect or can avoid talking to one’s ex-romantic partner at the party 
(situation modification) to reduce experience of negative affect. The expression “situation 
change” maps largely onto what is referred to as problem-focused or active coping—types 
of coping that involve modifying the source of adversity (Carver et al. 1989, Folkman & 
Lazarus 1980).

Short-term consequences of situation change.—Past investigations and a meta-
analysis have shown that situation change can be used effectively to decrease the experience 
of negative affect (Livingstone & Isaacowitz 2015, Thuillard & Dan-Glauser 2017, Van 
Bockstaele et al. 2020) and increase the experience of positive affect (Livingstone & 
Isaacowitz 2015, Webb et al. 2012). In terms of social processes, situation change does not 
appear to have consistent effects. On the one hand, situation-change strategies can enhance 
processes such as social support, social connectedness, and closeness (e.g., bringing a friend 
to a stressful work event; Chow & Glaman 2013); on the other hand, they could harm social 
processes (e.g., choosing not to attend a stressful work event and thus socially isolating). 
Thus, while in principle situation change can be very beneficial to social processes, this is 
not necessarily so.

Situation change and resilience.—Many individual studies have found that engaging 
in situation change is critically tied to psychological health, including after adversity (e.g., 
Chen et al. 2018, Heckhausen et al. 2010). However, meta-analyses have demonstrated 
mixed results. One meta-analysis of 42 studies found a positive association between problem 
solving, a key form of situation change, and psychological health (Aldao et al. 2010). 
However, a separate meta-analysis of a different set of 34 studies found that the association 
depends on the specific type of situation change, with general efforts to change the situation 
being associated with better psychological health and hostile or aggressive efforts to change 
the situation being associated with worse psychological health (Penley et al. 2002). Even 
within studies that used the same operationalization of situation change, meta-analytic 
associations were small, with some studies reporting positive associations, some finding 
no associations, and some finding negative associations between situation change and 
psychological health.

These inconsistent findings suggest that the relationship between situation change and 
resilience is moderated by features of the context. The controllability of one’s adverse 
situation has been theorized to be particularly important in this regard (Folkman 1984). 
After all, attempts to alter an uncontrollable situation are by definition unlikely to succeed 
and might lead to frustration and hopelessness. Consistent with this idea, situation change 
has been associated with increased resilience in relatively controllable adversity (Forsythe 
& Compas 1987, Vitaliano et al. 1990). In contrast, in relatively uncontrollable adversity,

situation change either is not significantly associated with resilience (Park et al. 2004, 
Vitaliano et al. 1990) or is associated with decreased resilience (Forsythe & Compas 1987, 
Watanabe et al. 2002). A recent systematic review found support for controllability as a 
moderator of the association between situation change and resilience in 9 out of 14 studies 
(Finkelstein-Fox & Park 2019).

Attentional Deployment

Attentional deployment is defined as changing the way one directs one’s attention in order 
to change one’s affect (Gross 2015). One particular form of attentional deployment that has 
received a great deal of empirical attention is distraction, which involves shifting attention 
away from one aspect of a situation (or thought) toward another (Gross 1998, Troy & Mauss 
2011). For example, one could browse the Internet for funny videos rather than thinking 
about an unsettling event that just happened. The coping literature has examined distraction 
as part of the broader category of disengagement (versus engagement) coping (Carver & 
Connor-Smith 2010).

Short-term consequences of attentional deployment.—Laboratory studies 
examining the short-term effects of distraction support the idea that this strategy consistently 
decreases negative affective experiences and increases positive affective experiences in both 
clinical and nonclinical samples (Brans et al. 2013, Joormann & Stanton 2016, Webb et al. 
2012). While the link between distraction and social processes has received relatively little 
empirical attention, work showing a negative association between experiential avoidance and 
social engagement suggests that distraction may also impede social processes, given that 
distraction can be considered a form of experiential avoidance (Gerhart et al. 2014, Kelly 
et al. 2019). However, there is some evidence that particular forms of distraction, such as 
spending time with friends, can maintain or even improve social processes (Shing et al. 
2016).

Attentional deployment and resilience.—While distraction allows people to decrease 
negative and increase positive affective experiences and may (in some specific cases) 
maintain social processes in the short term, on average, distraction appears to be negatively 
associated with resilience. Repeated use of avoidance strategies such as distraction is linked 
to impaired psychological health, including depression (Joormann & D’Avanzato 2010, 
Mellick et al. 2019), perhaps because these strategies do not involve resolution of the 
underlying cause of adversity. Experimental studies have shown that, although distraction 
decreases negative affective experiences in the short term, these benefits disappear or even 
reverse over time (Kross & Ayduk 2008, Paul et al. 2016, Thiruchselvam et al. 2011). 
This suggests that distraction may provide emotional relief in the short term but decrease 
resilience in the longer term (Campbell-Sills & Barlow 2007, Schäfer et al. 2017).

The finding that distraction might have short-term but not longer-term benefits dovetails 
with findings that using distraction flexibly (rather than chronically and consistently) 
is associated with increased resilience (Godara et al. 2021, Wen & Yoon 2019). Both 
findings point to the idea that temporal aspects of adversity may shape the effects of 
distraction on resilience. Specifically, acute or single instances of adversity may be more

suitable for distraction compared to more chronic or recurring instances of adversity. For 
example, when using distraction in response to one instance of a distressing stimulus, people 
show lower-intensity negative affective responses. However, when re-exposed to stimuli 
previously encountered while using distraction, people’s negative affective experiences 
increase (Paul et al. 2016, Thiruchselvam et al. 2011). When examining resilience outcomes 
more specifically, research indicates that briefly distracting and garnering positivity in the 
immediate aftermath of adversity may increase resilience, perhaps by allowing people to 
take a break from a temporally bound, intense affective response (Shing et al. 2016). On the 
other hand, the use of distraction in response to chronic or recurring events may decrease 
resilience, perhaps because it reduces vigilance and impedes problem solving (Shing et al. 
2016). These ideas remain largely theoretical and require further empirical investigation.

Cognitive Change

The most commonly studied cognitive-change strategy is reappraisal (also referred to as 
cognitive reappraisal, positive reappraisal, or benefit finding), which involves reframing 
or reconstruing an emotional situation in order to change one’s affect (Doré et al. 2016, 
Folkman & Moskowitz 2000, Gross 2015, Rankin & Sweeny 2022). Take, for example, 
one’s partner asking for a divorce, which an individual might initially appraise as an 
overpowering event that will devastate their own and their children’s lives. Alternatively, 
one might see it as painful but as something that can bring new opportunities to forge a new 
and healthier relationship.

Short-term consequences of cognitive change.—In their influential work, Lazarus 
and Folkman argued that it is not primarily a stressful event itself but rather one’s 
interpretation, or appraisal, of an event that leads to a stress response (Lazarus & Folkman 
1984). From this perspective, reappraisal should allow people to successfully change or 
even completely transform their affective experiences. These hypotheses about reappraisal’s 
effects on affective experience have received substantial empirical support from both 
experimental and correlational studies, and meta-analyses on this topic confirm that the 
use of reappraisal is associated with decreased experience of negative affect and increased 
experience of positive affect (Augustine & Hemenover 2009, Doré et al. 2016, Rankin & 
Sweeny 2022, Wang et al. 2021, Webb et al. 2012).

A growing body of evidence also reveals that reappraisal has beneficial impacts on social 
processes. When instructed to use reappraisal during a negative affect induction in the lab, 
people are able to maintain social responsiveness with a conversation partner (Butler et al. 
2003) and show increased forgiveness in response to a relational offense (vanOyen Witvliet 
et al. 2010). Furthermore, those who habitually use reappraisal more (versus less) are rated 
as more likeable and have closer friendships (John & Gross 2004), and the instructed use 
of reappraisal was associated with fewer disagreements and less relationship aggression in 
romantic couples during the COVID-19 pandemic (Rodriguez et al. 2021).

Cognitive change and resilience.—Given the pattern of short-term consequences 
described above, it may not be surprising that reappraisal is associated with increased 
resilience. For example, correlational studies have shown that reappraisal is associated with

maintained or even increased psychological health following a variety of adverse events 
(Cavanagh et al. 2014, Moskowitz et al. 1996, Troy et al. 2010). More recent studies 
conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic additionally show that the use of reappraisal is 
associated with increased resilience, including lower levels of ill-being and higher levels of 
well-being (Kuhlman et al. 2021, Low et al. 2021, Smith et al. 2021).

Importantly, however, context appears to moderate the link between reappraisal and 
resilience. In particular, the controllability of the adversity one encounters has received 
attention. Multiple investigations have documented that reappraisal is associated with 
increased resilience in relatively uncontrollable adversity but shows no or even negative 
associations with resilience in response to relatively controllable adversity (Haines et al. 
2016, Moskowitz et al. 1996, Troy et al. 2013). These patterns may occur because people 
who reappraise a controllable situation are able to decrease their experience of negative 
affect, which may decrease one’s motivation to take direct action to change a controllable 
situation (Ford & Troy 2019). Indeed, recent studies confirm that reappraisal could disrupt 
taking political action during an election (Ford et al. 2019) and health-related behaviors 
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Smith et al. 2021).

Response Modulation

Response-modulation strategies target one’s affective responses, including affective behavior 
(e.g., facial, body, or vocal behavior), subjective affective experience, and physiology (Gross 
2015, Webb et al. 2012). Research on response modulation has focused primarily on 
suppression of behavior—for example, adopting a neutral facial expression to prevent one’s 
boss from seeing that one is angry. Thus, we focus on this form of response modulation in 
our review, using the term “expressive suppression” (Gross 2015).

Short-term consequences of response modulation.—A meta-analysis of 
experimental studies reveals a large effect size of expressive suppression on expressive 
behavior but no consistent effect on the experience of negative affect (Webb et al. 2012). 
Additional correlational and experience-sampling studies with higher ecological validity 
indicate that expressive suppression not only is ineffective for decreasing experience of 
negative affect but also may reduce the experience of positive affect (Heiy & Cheavens 
2014, O’Toole et al. 2014, Srivastava et al. 2009).

In terms of social processes, expressive suppression has been shown to exert negative 
effects on important social outcomes, perhaps because it prevents people from accurately 
communicating affective states or because it may be at odds with cultural values pertaining 
to open emotional expression. Experimental and longitudinal studies have documented a 
wide range of disrupted social processes resulting from expressive suppression, including 
decreased social responsiveness and rapport (Butler et al. 2003), lower levels of perceived 
authenticity (English & John 2013), and lower social support and social satisfaction 
(Srivastava et al. 2009).

Response modulation and resilience.—Given the profile of short-term consequences, 
one would expect the use of expressive suppression to be associated, on average, with 
decreased resilience, and empirical data support this prediction. For example, a meta-

analysis reveals that the habitual use of expressive suppression is associated with symptoms 
of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders (Aldao et al. 2010). 
Fewer studies to date have examined expressive suppression specifically following adversity. 
However, a handful of studies have reported positive relationships between expressive 
suppression and symptoms of depression and anxiety following adversity, including 
discrimination and trauma (Cano et al. 2020, Juang et al. 2016, Moore et al. 2008).

While it is clear that expressive suppression has negative effects on resilience in many 
situations, these negative effects may be attenuated, absent, or even reversed in some 
contexts. In particular, there is accumulating evidence that one’s culture and specific 
cultural values moderate the relationship between expressive suppression and resilience. 
For example, a meta-analysis supports that expressive suppression may have a detrimental 
effect on resilience in individuals with Western cultural values but no effect on resilience in 
individuals with Eastern cultural values (Hu et al. 2014). Similarly, a prospective study in 
a sample of Mexican-origin adolescents found the suppression of negative emotion (but not 
positive emotion) predicted decreases in anhedonia symptoms of depression (Young et al. 
2022). One explanation for these findings is that collectivistic-oriented cultures (e.g., Asian 
and Mexican), compared with more individualistic-oriented cultures (e.g., European), place 
a higher value on expressive suppression, especially of negative emotion, perhaps to support 
interpersonal harmony and social goals (Markus & Kitayama 1991, Mesquita 2001, Wilms 
et al. 2020).

DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON RESILIENCE

In closing, we discuss key directions for future research on resilience indicated by the 
integrative affect-regulation framework (see Figure 2). We organize these directions by 
discussing each of the elements of the framework, namely: affect regulation processes, their 
short-term consequences, the moderating role of context, and implications for resilience.

Affect-Regulation Processes

It is important to deepen as well as broaden our understanding of affect regulation. 
Within families of affect regulation, emerging research and theorizing suggest potential 
additional distinctions that could have crucial implications for resilience. For example, 
several distinctions within the category of reappraisal have been proposed, including (a) 
reconstrual (changing how a situation is interpreted) versus repurposing (changing the 
goals to which one compares the situation) (Uusberg et al. 2019), (b) reappraisal aimed 
at increasing positive affect versus reappraisal aimed at decreasing negative affect (Folkman 
& Moskowitz 2000, McRae & Mauss 2016), and (c) reappraisal of the situation versus 
reappraisal of one’s emotional response to it (Jamieson et al. 2018).

It is also important to make distinctions among the processes involved in affect regulation, 
including identifying the need for affect regulation, selecting an affect-regulation strategy, 
implementing it, and monitoring its implementation (Gross 2015). Each of these processes
—identification, selection, implementation success, and monitoring—likely has unique 
implications for resilience, and empirical work is just beginning to examine and delineate 
these processes (Ford et al. 2017, Sheppes et al. 2014).

There is also a need to broaden the scope of analysis. For instance, more research is needed 
that focuses on strategies beyond reappraisal and suppression to capture the full range of 
affect-regulation strategies. In addition, we need to study more complex affect-regulation 
strategies that do not fit neatly into one affect-regulation family. For example, emotional 
acceptance, which has been linked to resilience (Ford et al. 2018a), includes features 
of attentional deployment (e.g., a focus on the present moment), cognitive change (e.g., 
reframing one’s affective states in a non-judgmental way), and response modulation (e.g., 
fully experiencing one’s affective states without attempting to change them) (Ford et al. 
2018a, Troy et al. 2018).

Finally, it will be critical to better understand the antecedents of affect regulation, including 
antecedents that are biological (e.g., genes; Southwick & Charney 2012), situational (e.g., 
environmental affordances; Suri et al. 2018, Uusberg et al. 2019), and psychological 
(e.g., beliefs about emotions, personality, self-efficacy, or goals; Bonanno et al. 2015, 
Carver & Connor-Smith 2010, John & Eng 2014). The beliefs people hold about their 
emotions might be especially impactful in that they simultaneously affect multiple aspects 
of affect regulation (Ford & Gross 2019, Zerwas et al. 2022). For example, the belief that 
one can control one’s emotions may shape affect regulation identification, selection, and 
implementation success (Ford et al. 2018b, Gutentag et al. 2017). In turn, such antecedents 
might be promising targets for intervention.

Short-Term Consequences of Affect Regulation

At the level of short-term consequences, more work is needed to comprehensively document 
the full range of short-term consequences listed in Figure 2 and their implications for 
resilience. The largest body of research to date has examined the consequences of affect 
regulation on the experience of affect, often focusing exclusively on negative affect. 
Yet, examining consequences for positive affect such as joy or hope—independently of 
negative affect—might be an especially fruitful path to understanding resilience (Duker 
et al. 2022, Folkman & Moskowitz 2000, Monroy et al. 2021, Tugade & Fredrickson 
2004). Beyond negative and positive affect, it will be useful to examine the consequences 
of affect regulation for discrete emotions. For instance, anger and sadness (Barlow et 
al. 2019, Shu et al. 2021) or excitement and contentment (Chim et al. 2018, Hamm et 
al. 2021) may have distinct implications for resilience. Furthermore, consequences other 
than affective experience are important in explaining resilience; yet there are still critical 
gaps in knowledge when it comes to behavior (especially beyond facial expressions), 
physiology, social processes (e.g., social support, social connectedness), cognitive effort, and 
engagement (e.g., awareness of, behavioral engagement with, and learning from adversity). 
Lastly, research is needed that concurrently examines multiple short-term consequences 
(e.g., affective experience, social processes, and engagement) in order to clarify how profiles 
of short-term consequences shape resilience.

A second aspect of a deeper understanding of the short-term consequences of affect 
regulation involves investigating their time course and dynamics. To date, research has 
heavily focused on mean-level consequences of affect regulation (e.g., how does someone 
feel after using reappraisal relative to after using suppression?). Yet more complex dynamics

The Context

of these consequences might play a role in shaping resilience, including variability over 
time, trajectories over time, and relationships among multiple response systems (Willroth 
et al. 2020; see Dejonckheere et al. 2019 for discussion). For example, regardless of how 
someone feels when they first encounter adversity, the rate at which their feelings recover 
and how they feel over the longer term might play an important role in resilience (Leger et 
al. 2018).

In our empirical review, we highlighted some of the growing number of studies that have 
examined the role that context plays in affect regulation and resilience. Yet, much remains to 
be learned. First, it will be important to more systematically and comprehensively examine 
features of adversity, including intensity, timing, duration, controllability, globality, and type 
of adversity, among others. Emerging research on reappraisal highlights the utility of this 
approach.

For example, some forms of reappraisal in response to discrimination have been shown to 
be associated with null effects on short-term affective experiences (Duker et al. 2022) and 
decreased psychological health (Perez & Soto 2011), perhaps because they invalidate one’s 
experiences or undermine one’s values (Ford & Troy 2019). To gain a more comprehensive 
understanding of the role of adversity and its particular features, we need more studies that 
consider and compare presence versus absence of adversity, levels of severity of adversity, 
and other features of adversity (e.g., Seery et al. 2010). In addition, we need to more deeply 
and comprehensively consider features of the broader context, including of people’s culture, 
society, community, social group membership, and family. Existing evidence illustrates that 
the broader context—through the affordances, practices, values, and beliefs it engenders—
can powerfully shape affect regulation and its links with resilience. There are also likely 
to be important interactions between the broader context, adversity, and affect regulation in 
shaping resilience. Yet, empirical research in this area is in its infancy.

Considering context will shift how we conceptualize affect regulation’s role in resilience, 
moving it away from thinking of affect-regulation strategies as either inherently conducive 
to or harmful for resilience. Rather, we need to think of affect-regulation strategies as 
conducive to resilience depending on how flexibly and context-appropriately they are 
deployed (Bonanno & Burton 2013, Cheng et al. 2014, Ford & Troy 2019). Several 
recent developments have begun to capture these aspects of affect regulation, including 
by considering affect-regulation repertoires (Grommisch et al. 2020), affect-regulation 
flexibility (Birk & Bonanno 2016, Sheppes et al. 2014), within-person variability in affect-
regulation use (Aldao et al. 2015, Blanke et al. 2020), and fit between affect regulation 
and context (e.g., Cheng et al. 2014). Considering context also highlights the critical idea 
that interventions can target both affect regulation and the context as ways to increase 
resilience. Within the affect-regulation framework, it is especially promising to build on 
these developments.

Resilience Outcomes

Page 21

At the level of resilience, it will be important to better understand the degree to which 
affect regulation has general versus specific effects on facets of resilience. One key question 
is illustrated by Figure 1. We can ask whether the same processes that help people avoid 
doing worse than expected (e.g., avoid worse ill-being; see red line in Figure 1) also help 
people do better than expected (e.g., gain well-being and growth; see green line in Figure 
1) (Ryff & Singer 1998, Seligman 2008). Further distinctions that are important to explore 
involve different domains of psychological health; for example, we need to examine whether 
anxiety versus depression or hedonic versus eudaimonic well-being are predicted in similar 
or distinct ways. Lastly, resilience does not just concern psychological functioning but also 
physical functioning, and a major direction for research is to apply the present framework to 
physical health (DeSteno et al. 2013, McEwen & Wingfield 2003). Initial research indicates 
that likely there is at least some specificity, such that affect regulation that is helpful in one 
domain might not be helpful, or may even be harmful, in other domains (Miller et al. 2015).

Concluding Comment

Human life comes with unavoidable adversity. How we deal with this adversity depends 
crucially on affect regulation. We offer an integrative affect-regulation framework for 
resilience, which builds on and integrates the coping and emotion-regulation approaches. 
This integrative framework broadens and deepens how we understand affect regulation, its 
consequences, and its embeddedness in context. Ultimately, the affect-regulation framework 
has the promise to guide the development and improvement of prevention and intervention 
efforts by suggesting precisely which aspects of affect regulation might be of use and in 
what contexts. This consideration of context also means that, in addition to helping with 
individual affect regulation, interventions should target how people relate to their context as 
well as provide educational, occupational, financial, and structural resources to ultimately 
enhance resilience at the individual, family, and community levels. Our hope is that the 
affect-regulation framework provides a research agenda for researchers to gain a better 
understanding of resilience and how we can enhance it.

SUMMARY POINTS

Research on the processes that explain psychological resilience has come 
from two major sources: the stress and coping approach and the emotion and 
emotion-regulation approach. Each approach has yielded important insights 
but is limited by (a) a lack of conceptual clarity and (b) a lack of integration 
of the two approaches.

To contribute to conceptual clarity, we review six questions encountered in 
research on resilience and provide an overview of the conceptual space in 
which these questions can be answered. We then locate our own approach 
within this conceptual space.

To contribute to integration, we propose an affect-regulation framework that 
joins insights from the two approaches.

We use this integrative framework to structure our empirical review of 
findings on coping, emotion regulation, and resilience. This review (a) 
focuses on four theoretically derived families of affect-regulation strategies, 
(b) reviews the short-term consequences of these strategies for affective 
experience and social processes, (c) reviews the relationships between affect-
regulation strategies and resilience, and (d) highlights how links between 
affect regulation and resilience are powerfully shaped by aspects of adversity 
and of the broader context.

A key insight from the integrative affect-regulation framework is that the 
effects of affect-regulation strategies on resilience cannot be understood 
solely through their short-term consequences in a single domain, and they 
are not inherently good or bad for resilience. Instead, whether a strategy 
increases or decreases resilience is determined by the profile of its short-
term consequences in conjunction with features of adversity (e.g., intensity, 
controllability of an adverse event) and of the broader context (e.g., one’s 
culture, social group, family).

The integrative affect-regulation framework capitalizes on the complementary 
strengths and unique contributions of the coping and emotion-regulation 
approaches, organizes existing empirical insights, and guides future research 
on resilience by providing an agenda for researchers to gain a better 
understanding of resilience and how we can enhance it.

FUTURE ISSUES

More work is needed that examines resilience at the group and community 
levels, in addition to the individual level we focused on here.

Researchers should examine a wider range of affect-regulation strategies 
(e.g., situation selection, acceptance), a wider range of processes (e.g., 
affect-regulation identification, selection, implementation, and monitoring 
processes), and antecedents of affect regulation (e.g., beliefs).

More work is needed that documents the full range of short-term 
consequences of affect regulation that are relevant for resilience (e.g., 
behavior, social processes, engagement) and that explores more complex 
dynamics within these consequences (e.g., variability and trajectories over 
time).

We need to conduct comprehensive investigations of the role of context, 
including features of adversity and of the broader context, and how it shapes 
affect regulation, its short-term consequences, and its links with resilience.

Future research should examine multiple resilience outcomes (e.g., well-
being, mental health, physical health) and how they relate to one another.

A key priority moving forward is to build a comprehensive, causal, 
and mechanistic understanding of affect regulation and resilience by 
employing longitudinal or intervention studies that measure or manipulate 
affect regulation, examine the mechanistic role of short-term consequences, 
carefully consider theoretically motivated aspects of the context, and 
document longer-term effects on resilience.

Existing and emerging findings produced within the affect-regulation 
framework can be used to increase resilience by developing and improving 
prevention and intervention programs that target affect regulation and its 
context.

Figure 1. 
Our conceptual approach to psychological resilience. The two lines depict two prototypical 
trajectories: the green one leading to better-than-expected psychological health (resilience) 
and the red one leading to worse-than-expected psychological health (absence of resilience). 
The x-axis depicts time relative to adversity onset, indicating pre- and post-adversity. The 
y-axis depicts psychological health (i.e., resilience). The graded green and red backgrounds 
indicate that people fall along a continuum of resilience rather than into discrete types. The 
graded gray background indicates the gradual offset of adversity exposure.

Figure 2. 
An affect-regulation framework of psychological resilience. Families of affect-regulation 
strategies predict short-term consequences, which predict resilience. Features of adversity 
influence affect regulation, its short-term consequences, and its links with resilience, as 
indicated by the darker-gray box. The broader context, indicated by the larger lighter-gray 
box, encompasses all other aspects of the framework as it influences features of adversity as 
well as affect regulation, its short-term consequences, its links with resilience, and even what 
constitutes resilience in the first place. The broader context can also give rise to three-way 
interactions with adversity and any other aspects of the framework depicted here. Affective 
experience and social processes are bolded because they are the focus of the empirical 
review.

Adversity is not explicitly considered (e.g., trait measures of 
resilience that are used in the presence or absence of adversity).

Adversity is explicitly considered: Some type of adversity must be 
experienced to observe resilience.

–

–

Adversity can be defined objectively (e.g., checklist 
measures) or subjectively (e.g., individual appraisal of 
stress).

Particular features of adversity are considered.

♦

♦

♦

♦

Intensity, ranging from low (e.g., daily hassles 
or transient events) to high (e.g., a natural 
disaster or major illness)

Timing (e.g., occurring early versus later in 
life) and duration (e.g., acute events lasting 
minutes to days versus chronic events lasting 
months to years)

Controllability (e.g., how much one can 
influence whether and how an event occurs 
and unfolds over time)

Additional important features: globality of life 
domains concerned, threat, deprivation

–

Specific types of adverse circumstances or events are 
considered (e.g., job loss, divorce, natural disaster).

Factors (e.g., relatively stable ability to adapt to adversity)

Processes (e.g., deploying resources to adapt to adversity)

Outcomes

–

–

Individual level (e.g., greater well-being; greater 
psychological health; lower levels of psychopathology; 
fewer symptoms; absence of diagnosis; greater 
academic, occupational, or social achievements; reaching 
developmental milestones)

Group/community level (e.g., greater social and 
economic infrastructure, greater educational and human 
development resources)

Absolute point (e.g., meets a threshold such as absence of clinical 
depression)

Relative to

–

–

–

other people experiencing similar adversity (e.g., less 
depression relative to other bereaved spouses)

other people who did not experience adversity (e.g., 
similar functioning between an individual experiencing 
bereavement and an individual not experiencing 
bereavement)

oneself (e.g., returns to or exceeds one’s pre-bereavement 
levels of depression)

Our position

We focus on the 
individual level.

We consider 
resilience in the 
context of adversity.

We consider features 
of adversity.

We distinguish 
factors, processes, 
and outcomes. Here, 
we define resilience 
as an outcome.

We focus on 
psychological health 
as a resilience 
outcome.

We consider 
resilience in relation 
to expectations in 
a particular cultural 
context and given 
particular adversity.

We consider 
resilience on a 
continuum (more 
versus less) rather 
than as discrete 
types.

Possible answers

Our position

–

expectation in a particular cultural context and given 
particular adversity (e.g., less depression than one’s 
culture would expect given bereavement)

Discrete types (someone is or is not resilient) or on a continuum 
(someone is more or less resilient)

At any point in time (e.g., relatively high psychological health 
throughout life)

Beginning during adversity (e.g., relatively high psychological health 
during a major illness)

Beginning seconds or minutes after adversity (e.g., relatively high 
psychological health immediately after learning about a major 
illness)

Beginning weeks or months after adversity (e.g., relatively high 
psychological health 2 months after sudden job loss)

Beginning years after adversity (e.g., relatively high psychological 
health in adulthood after abuse in childhood)

Duration not considered

At least seconds to minutes (e.g., positive mood lasting for several 
minutes)

At least days to months (e.g., 2 months of relatively high 
psychological health)

At least years to decades (e.g., several years of relatively high 
psychological health)

affective experience) mechanisms

Consideration of psychological and physical health 
outcomes

•

•

•

•

Consideration of emotion-eliciting events, broadly 
(positive or negative)

Consideration of discrete negative and positive emotions 
(e.g., sadness, anger, anxiety, joy, calm)

Consideration of multiple domains of emotional 
responding (e.g., subjective experience, behavior, 
cognition, physiology) and of psychological (e.g., 
affective experience) mechanisms

emphasis on physical health outcomes

2. Emphasis on a wide range of real-world coping strategies (e.g., 
13 strategies of the Brief COPE) or broad categories of coping 
strategies (e.g., emotion-focused versus problem-focused)

grounded emotion-regulation strategies (e.g., 4 families of strategies 
derived from the process model)

•

•

More comprehensiveness and breadth

Less focus, homogeneity, and specificity

of stressors)

•

Emphasis on main effects of emotion regulation, less 
consideration of context

4. Naturalistic emphasis

4. Emphasis on controlled laboratory contexts

•

•

•

Greater reliance on surveys and correlational methods 
to assess coping

Greater emphasis on longer-term relationships 
between coping and resilience

Greater ecological and lower internal validity

manipulations of emotion regulation

Greater emphasis on shorter-term causal effects of 
emotion regulation and examinations of temporally fine-
grained dynamic processes
