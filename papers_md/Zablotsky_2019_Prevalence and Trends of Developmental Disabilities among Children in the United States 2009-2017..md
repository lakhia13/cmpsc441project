Abstract

Objective—To study the national prevalence of ten developmental disabilities in US children 
aged 3–17 years and explore changes over time by associated demographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics using the 2009–2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

Methods—Data come from the NHIS, a nationally-representative survey of the civilian 
noninstitutionalized population. Parents reported physician or other health care professional 
diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 
blindness; cerebral palsy; moderate to profound hearing loss; learning disability (LD); intellectual 
disability (ID); seizures; stuttering or stammering; and other developmental delays. Weighted 
percentages for each of the selected developmental disabilities and any developmental disability 
were calculated between 2009–2017 and stratified by selected demographic/socioeconomic 
characteristics.

Results—From 2009–2011 to 2015–2017, there were overall significant increases in the 
prevalence of any developmental disability (16.2% to 17.8%, p<.001), ADHD (8.5% to 9.5%, 
p<.01), ASD (1.1% to 2.5%, p<.001), and ID (0.9% to 1.2%, p<.05), but a significant decrease for 
any other developmental delay (4.7% to 4.1%, p<.05). The prevalence of any developmental 
disability increased among boys, children ages 12–17, non-Hispanic white and Hispanic children,

children with private insurance only, and children with birthweights ≥2,500 grams. An increase in 
prevalence of any developmental disability was also seen for children living in urban areas and 
with less educated mothers.

Conclusions—The prevalence of developmental disability among US children aged 3–17 years 
increased between 2009–2017. Changes by demographic and socioeconomic subgroups may be 
related to improvements in awareness and access to health care.

Table of Contents Summary

From the 2009–2017 NHIS, there was a 9.5% increase in the prevalence of developmental 
disabilities among children aged 3–17.

Developmental disabilities are a group of lifelong conditions due to an impairment in 
physical, learning, language, or behavior areas. Children diagnosed with developmental 
disabilities typically require services to address behavioral and developmental challenges.1 
Measuring the prevalence of developmental disabilities in the population helps gauge the 
adequacy of available services and interventions.

Timely data are essential to capturing changes to the prevalence of developmental 
disabilities and provide an opportunity to address challenges in estimating prevalence, 
including changing definitions and labeling practices. Up-to-date estimates can also shed 
light on the role that increased awareness, improved diagnosis, changes in diagnostic 
criteria, and increased availability of services may play in the measured prevalence of 
identified developmental disabilities.2 They can also provide insight into potential 
demographic groups who may be underdiagnosed, and socioeconomic characteristics that 
may serve as barriers to receiving a diagnosis, such as living in a rural area without access to 
specialized health services.3,4

Large national surveys such as the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were designed 
to provide up-to-date population-based estimates of health in the United States. Since 1997 
the NHIS has included questions (with minimal changes in question text year-to-year) on a 
comprehensive group of ten developmental disabilities. However, few papers have been 
published detailing the prevalence for the full set of conditions, instead focusing on one or a 
small group of these conditions.5–10 The most recent NHIS-based estimate on all ten 
conditions covered 1997–2008,11 examining changes in prevalence over the time period. The 
prevalence was found to be 13.9% among children ages 3–17 for 1997–2008.

This paper updates this estimate of developmental disabilities, using data from the 2009–
2017 NHIS, with the goal of better understanding the major demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics that are related to prevalence, along with an investigation to 
changes in the prevalence of developmental disabilities during this time period.

Methods

Data are from the 2009–2017 NHIS, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS). NHIS is a nationally representative survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized 
population.a Households are sampled and selected to be interviewed in person by trained

Census Bureau interviewers. Within each household, families are identified and complete a 
brief questionnaire on selected demographic and broad health measures. Next, one adult and 
one child are randomly selected to be the subject of a more detailed health questionnaire. 
The child interview is conducted with a parent or guardian. Between 2009–2017, the family 
completion rate ranged from 65.7%−81.6%; among households with children, the 
completion rate for the child questionnaire ranged from 89.8%−92.3%, yielding an overall 
response rate of 60.6–74.6%.b

Children aged 3–17 years were included in the analytic sample (total 2009–2017 unweighted 
sample size n=88,530). The developmental disabilities questions included in the NHIS child 
questionnaire are provided in Box 1. Parents were asked whether or not their child had ten 
specific developmental disabilities including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), blindness, cerebral palsy (CP), moderate to 
profound hearing loss, learning disability (LD), intellectual disability (ID), seizures in the 
past 12 months, stuttering or stammering in the past 12 months, or any other developmental 
delay. Children whose parents answered in the affirmative to any of these conditions were 
classified as having the global “any developmental disability” outcome no matter how many 
conditions they endorsed their child having. Question wording and format for most 
developmental disabilities were consistent over the study period; exceptions include ASD, 
ID, and other developmental delay. The definition of autism was expanded to include 
“autism spectrum disorder” in 2011, and again in 2014 to include “autism, Asperger’s 
disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, or autism spectrum disorder”. In 2014, the 
question on autism also became a specific standalone question, rather than being included in 
a checklist of conditions to select, and the position of the question was moved within the 
survey (now coming before the question on any other developmental delay). Up until 2011, 
ID was ascertained using the phrase “mental retardation”; in 2011, the item phrasing was 
changed to “intellectual disability, also known as mental retardation”. This condition has 
been described as intellectual disability throughout, regardless of year.

Selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics included age, sex, urbanicity of 
residence (dichotomized as urban/ruralc), race and ethnicity, current insurance status 
(categorized as private only, any public coverage [Medicaid, other public, State Children’s 
Health Insurance Program, Medicare, Military coverage or other government] or no 
coverage), maternal education level (categorized as less than high school, high school or 
some college, and college degree or greater), family federal poverty ratio (categorized as 
income <200% federal poverty level (FPL) or ≥200% FPL; imputed when missing), and low 
birthweight (defined as less than 2,500 grams).

Weighted percentages of children who had each of the selected developmental disabilities 
and any developmental disability were calculated for the overall time period 2009–2017 and 
stratified by the selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Differences

between percentages of developmental disabilities by selected demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics were first evaluated using chi-squares at the p<0.05 level. 
Significant differences within groups were then evaluated using pairwise comparisons. 
Three-year pooled estimates of each of the selected developmental disabilities and any 
developmental disability were calculated for 2009–2011, 2012–2014 and 2015–2017 overall 
and by selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Linear and quadratic trends 
over time were tested using linear regression. The significance of the percentage change over 
time was assessed via t-test. All analyses incorporated complex sample design variables and 
weights to allow for the calculation of nationally representative estimates using SUDAAN 
version 11.0. Joinpoint was used to test for inflection points in the prevalence of any 
developmental disability over the time period 1997–2017, which includes estimates 
published previously on the same composite indicator of any developmental disability.11

Results

Prevalence

During 2009–2017, the overall prevalence of any developmental disability among children 
aged 3–17 years in the United States was 16.93%, ranging from 0.16% for blindness to 
9.04% for ADHD (Table 1a, Table 1b, Table 1c).

Child-level characteristics—Overall, children in the oldest age group (ages 12–17 
years) were the most likely to be diagnosed with any developmental disability, and 
specifically with ADHD, LD, and ID; however, they were least likely to be diagnosed with 
stuttering/stammering or any other developmental delay, and less likely to be diagnosed with 
seizures than children 3–5 years. Boys were more likely than girls to be diagnosed with any 
developmental disability, specifically with ADHD, ASD, CP, LD, ID, stuttering/stammering, 
and any other developmental delay.

Non-Hispanic white children were most likely to be diagnosed with ADHD and more likely 
to be diagnosed with ASD than non-Hispanic black or Hispanic children. Non-Hispanic 
black children were most likely to be diagnosed with LD or stuttering/stammering. Hispanic 
children were least likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Overall, non-Hispanic white and 
non-Hispanic black children were more likely to be diagnosed with any DD when compared 
to either non-Hispanic other children or Hispanic children.

Children receiving any form of public health insurance were more likely to be diagnosed 
with any and each of the individual developmental disabilities when compared to children 
receiving only private health insurance and uninsured children, with the exception of 
blindness in the latter group. Children with only private health insurance were more likely to 
be diagnosed with ADHD, ASD, and any other developmental delay when compared to 
uninsured children, but were less likely to be diagnosed with LD. Children with low 
birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) were more likely to be diagnosed with any and each of 
the specific developmental disabilities when compared to children of normal birthweight.

Family-level characteristics—Children with mothers who had a college or greater 
education level were least likely to be diagnosed with any developmental disability, and

specifically least likely to be diagnosed with LD, ID, seizures, and stuttering/stammering. 
Children with mothers with less than a high school education were more likely to be 
diagnosed with blindness, LD, ID, or stuttering/stammering, but were less likely to be 
diagnosed with ADHD or any other developmental delay when compared to children with 
mothers who had only completed high school or some college.

Children in families living at less than 200% of the FPL were more likely to have been 
diagnosed with each developmental disability, except ASD. Children with a rural residence 
compared to an urban residence were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with any 
developmental disability, and several conditions, including ADHD, hearing loss, and LD.

The prevalence of any developmental disability increased significantly (16.22% to 17.76%; 
an increase of 9.5%), comparing the years 2009–2011 to 2015–2017. During this time 
period, significant increases were also observed for ADHD (8.47% to 9.54%; an increase of 
12.6%), ASD (1.12% to 2.49%; an increase of 122.3%), and ID (0.93% to 1.17%; an 
increase of 25.8%), but a significant decrease was seen for the category of “other 
developmental delay” (4.65% to 4.06%; a decrease of 12.7%) (See Table 2).

Figure 1 shows prevalence trends of any developmental disability for an expanded time 
period. From 1997–2017, the prevalence of any developmental disability significantly 
increased (38.3%) from 12.84% to 17.76%. While the trend appeared more pronounced 
from 1997–2008 than 2009–2017, there were no inflection points detected between 1997–
2017, indicating that the rates of increase between 1997–2008 and 2009–2017 were not 
significantly different.

Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics

Between 2009–2017, there was a significant increase seen in the prevalence of any 
developmental disabilities for the oldest children (ages 12–17 years), boys, non-Hispanic 
white and Hispanic children, children with private insurance only and normal birthweights. 
An increase in prevalence was also observed for children living with mothers who had a high 
school or some college level of education, children living in families in both FPL groups, 
and children living in urban areas (See Table 3). The observed prevalence increases were of 
similar magnitude for children with low birthweights, children living with mothers who have 
less than a high school education, and children living in rural areas were not statistically 
significant, perhaps due to smaller sample sizes for these subgroups.

Discussion

Overall, approximately 1 in 6 children (~17%) between the ages of 3–17 in the United States 
were reported to have a developmental disability diagnosis between 2009–2017. During this 
time period, there was a significant increase in the overall rate of developmental disabilities, 
due in large part to increases in the prevalence of ADHD, ASD, and ID, but with a 
concomitant decrease in the prevalence of “any other developmental delay.”

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

The increase in prevalence of diagnosed ADHD among US children and adolescents since 
the late 1990s has been well-documented,12–14 though there is evidence that the prevalence 
of ADHD symptoms and impairment has remained steady over time.15,16 Taken together, 
this suggests that the increases in diagnosed prevalence could be driven by better 
identification of children who meet criteria for ADHD, as current estimates of diagnosed 
prevalence are in line with community-based studies that measure symptoms and 
impairment against DSM diagnostic criteria.17 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 
published updated guidelines in 2011 for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, which may 
have influenced diagnostic practices over the study time period.18 Availability of treatment 
may also be related to increases in the diagnosis of ADHD, as there are many effective 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that have been and continue to be 
developed to address ADHD symptoms and associated negative functioning.19

Autism Spectrum Disorder

The reported prevalence of ASD in the United States and other industrialized countries has 
shown marked increases in recent decades.2,20 However, understanding changes to ASD 
prevalence remains particularly challenging given that the diagnosis of ASD is based on a 
symptom profile, and healthcare provider and school practices for ASD screening, diagnosis, 
and classification continue to evolve. Nonetheless, a sizable portion of the ASD prevalence 
increase is likely explained by improved identification of children with ASD related to 
increasing parental awareness and changing provider practices,21,22 including universal 
screening by 18–24 months and ongoing monitoring of a child’s development as 
recommended by the AAP in 2007.23

Although not directly tested in the current study, changes in diagnostic criteria and reporting 
practices24 have been associated with increases in the number of “catch-up” diagnoses 
observed in older children. In fact, results from the National Survey of Children’s Health 
documented that much of the observed prevalence increase reported in each successive 
survey were largely explained by diagnoses in older children within given birth cohorts.25,26 
The composition of children with ASD has also changed over the years, with the co-
occurrence of ID decreasing in recent years, likely a result of broadening diagnostic criteria.
2,27

Finally, changes in the prevalence of ASD as measured by the NHIS may also be tied to 
survey measurement. An increase of approximately 80% was seen in the 2014 NHIS 
following changes to the wording and ordering of the question capturing ASD.28 Future 
wording changes may be required to align the ASD question with DSM-5 criteria.29

Intellectual Disability

In the NHIS, the increase in the prevalence of ID also appears to coincide with changes to 
the wording or ordering of survey questions. ID prevalence was relatively stable between 
1997–200811 when the survey asked about “mental retardation”, but was 72% higher in 
2011–2013 when the question asked about “intellectual disability, also known as mental 
retardation.”7 It has been hypothesized that wording changes may have decreased social

desirability pressures (e.g. parents may be more comfortable endorsing ID rather than 
mental retardation) while increasing the ability to recognize and correctly endorse the 
condition by including both terms.30

Other Developmental Delay

“Other developmental delay” was the only condition to show a statistically significant 
decrease over time. It is possible that parents have become less likely to select this category 
because their children have increasingly been diagnosed with another specified condition on 
the survey. Evidence supporting this type of “diagnostic substitution” has been shown 
previously in special education administrative datasets.31

Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics

Patterns related to diagnosed developmental disabilities by child-level and family-level 
characteristics were largely similar to those found in previous studies,4,11,14,32–34 with a 
higher prevalence of any developmental disabilities and specific disorders for boys, older 
children, children whose birthweight was lower than 2,500 grams, non-Hispanic white 
children, children with public insurance, children with mothers with less than a college 
education, and children living in a household below 200% of the federal poverty line.

The higher prevalence of identified disorders among children living in rural areas may be 
related to differences in demographic patterns and risk factors in rural areas, including 
greater financial difficulties and less access to amenities and treatment resources.4,35,36 The 
overall difference between urban and rural prevalence can primarily be attributed to 
discrepancies seen for behavioral conditions, such as ADHD and LD. Previous research has 
identified notable rural behavioral health barriers,37,38 such as lack of access to 
transportation and availability of specialized providers, who prevent and treat symptoms of 
these conditions. Meanwhile, ADHD, ID, and LD were also more prevalent among older 
children than younger children, which may reflect that these diagnoses might not be 
formally recognized until a child is in school.23

Overall, the general consistency of demographic patterns with previous studies, particularly 
Boyle and colleagues,11 suggest that underlying, contributing factors, such as service 
availability, continue to be associated with the prevalence of developmental disabilities. 
These same demographic subgroups that had higher prevalence of any developmental 
disabilities were also the groups that exhibited significant increases from 2009–2011 to 
2015–2017.

Strengths and Limitations

The NHIS has several notable strengths in both its large sample size and high response rate 
for a national survey, allowing for analysis among subgroups of children with less common 
developmental disabilities. The NHIS provides timely and in-depth information on the 
health conditions, service utilization, and family sociodemographic characteristics of 
children with developmental disabilities. Estimates produced from the NHIS can be 
interpreted as nationally representative when weights and the complex survey design 
variables are implemented in an analysis, providing powerful evidence of the proportion and

number of non-institutionalized children affected by developmental disabilities in United 
States.

Despite these strengths, some caution is warranted because of survey-related limitations. 
First, in some instances statistical trend tests may have been underpowered due to smaller 
sample sizes (e.g. rural residents). Second, the reliance on parent report could result in 
misreporting of child’s diagnoses as these reports may also be subject to recall biases, 
particularly among parents of older children. Thirdly, there was no mechanism in place to 
validate parent-reported diagnoses either through clinical evaluation or educational records. 
However, there is notable consistency between results of the NHIS and other nationally 
representative surveys, including the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH). Recent, 
population-based ASD estimates have been found to be virtually identical when comparing 
ASD prevalence in the 2016 NSCH and the 2016 NHIS.39 A broader comparison of a select 
set of developmental disabilities (including ASD), with comparable question wordings 
between multiple iterations of the NSCH and the NHIS, produced comparable findings 
[available as an online supplement], suggesting further evidence of convergent validity.

Caution should typically be exercised when comparing published prevalence estimates 
derived from different surveillance systems and surveys with varying rigor of case 
ascertainment. However, it is worth noting that survey-based estimates from both the NHIS 
and the NSCH have fallen within the range of estimates provided by the CDC’s Autism and 
Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network,2,40–41 particularly when aligned with a 
comparable age group, suggesting a degree of consistency.27

Finally, as parents are reporting on a lifetime diagnosis, it is likely that some children 
included in the current analysis no longer have a diagnosable developmental disability. It is 
known that the persistence of developmental disabilities is highly variable by condition, with 
some children losing a diagnosis as a result of maturation or the ability to effectively manage 
their condition.42

Conclusions

The percentage of children diagnosed with a developmental disability increased significantly 
between 2009–2017, resulting in a growing population of children (approximately 1 out of 
every 6) with one or more developmental disabilities. Given this growth, additional research 
may help to better understand the characteristics of children with developmental disabilities, 
the complex risk factors associated with developmental disabilities,43 and the accessibility of 
services and interventions44 which have been shown to improve long-term outcomes for 
those diagnosed with a developmental disability.45

What’s Known on this Subject

Previous work found health disparities in diagnosed developmental disabilities by 
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics among US children. Changes in 
awareness, knowledge, healthcare services access, and improved measurement make it 
important to continue to monitor prevalence changes in the population.

Figure 1. Prevalence of any developmental disability among children ages 3–17 years in the 
United States, 1997–2017
In 2000, the NHIS shifted from asking about only ADD to asking about ADD and ADHD.
In 2008, the categorization for moderate to profound hearing loss was expanded to include 
“moderate trouble” hearing in addition to “a lot of trouble” hearing and deafness.
In 2011, “mental retardation” was replaced with “intellectual disability, also known as 
mental retardation”. In addition, the autism categorization was expanded to include “autism 
spectrum disorder”.
In 2014, the question on autism spectrum disorder became a standalone question with an 
expanded list of eligible conditions, including Asperger’s disorder and pervasive 
developmental disorder.
