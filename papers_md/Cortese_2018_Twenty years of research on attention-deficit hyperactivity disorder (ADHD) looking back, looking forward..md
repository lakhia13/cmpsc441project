AbstrACt
In this clinical review we summarise what in our view have been some the most important advances in the past two decades, in terms of diagnostic 
definition, epidemiology, genetics and environmental causes, neuroimaging/cognition and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
including: (1) the most recent changes to the diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International 
Classification of Diseases; (2) meta-analytic evidence showing that, after accounting for diagnostic methods, the rates of ADHD are fairly consistent 
across Western countries; (3) the recent finding of the first genome-wide significant risk loci for ADHD; (4) the paradigm shift in the pathophysiological 
conceptualisation of ADHD from alterations in individual brain regions to a complex dysfunction in brain networks; (5) evidence supporting the short-
term efficacy of ADHD pharmacological treatments, with a different profile of efficacy and tolerability in children/adolescents versus adults; (6) a series 
of meta-analyses showing that, while non-pharmacological treatment may not be effective to target ADHD core symptoms, some of them effectively 
address ADHD-related impairments (such as oppositional behaviours for parent training and working memory deficits for cognitive training). We also 
discuss key priorities for future research in each of these areas of investigation. Overall, while many research questions have been answered, many 
others need to be addressed. Strengthening multidisciplinary collaborations, relying on large data sets in the spirit of Open Science and supporting 
research in less advantaged countries will be key to face the challenges ahead.

IntroduCtIon
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  the  most  common 
neurodevelopmental  disorder  in  children,  with  an  estimated  worldwide 
prevalence around 5%.1 Although it has for a long time been considered a 
childhood disorder, it is now established that impairing ADHD symptoms 
persist in adulthood in a sizeable portion of cases (around 65%),2 although 
there is variability in the estimate due to methodological heterogeneity 
across studies.3

As  for  other  mental  health  conditions  there  has,  over  the  past  two 
decades, been an increasing body of research on ADHD. Reasons for this 
increase include: increased recognition of the impact of ADHD on func-
tioning; advances in research methodology and technology; and interest 
from pharmaceutical companies.

Here, we provide an overview of what we deem have been some the 
most important advances, in the past two decades, in ADHD research. 
We also discuss key areas for future research.

Methods
Given the large body of literature and space constraints, this review is 
selective rather than systematic and comprehensive. We relied mostly 
on meta-analyses, retrieved with a search in PubMed using the following 
syntax/terms (update: 8 August 2018): (ADHD OR Attention Deficit OR 
Hyperkinetic Disorder) AND (meta-analy* OR metaanaly).

PresentAtIon

diagnostic definition
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
(DSM-5),4  published  in  2013,  introduced  several  significant  changes  in 
relation  to  the  DSM  Fourth  Edition  Text  Revision  (DSM-IV-TR)5  criteria. 
First, the threshold in the number of symptoms (criterion A) necessary for 
the diagnosis in older adolescents and adults was reduced from 6 to 5. 
This change is in keeping with the notion that, despite a reduction in the 
number of symptoms over development, adults with ADHD in childhood 

can  still  present  with  impairment.2  The  required  age  of  onset  was 
increased from ‘prior to 7’ to ‘prior to 12’. The purpose of these changes 
was  well  intended  and  designed  to  facilitate  the  diagnostic  process  in 
adults, who often have trouble pinpointing the exact age of onset, espe-
cially  if  early  in  the  development.  Unfortunately,  neither  change  was 
based on empirical evidence, and methods used for diagnostic ascertain-
ment in adults are still under debate.3 Another pivotal change in DSM-5 
is the removal of the veto around the dual diagnosis of ADHD and autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD) that was present in previous editions of the 
DSM. Unlike the age of onset and symptom number changes this change 
is supported by a significant body of research (see ref 6). Finally, the (sub)
types of ADHD defined in the DSM-IV-(TR) were replaced by the notion 
of different presentations. This acknowledges the instability in the pheno-
typic  manifestation  of  inattention  or  hyperactive/impulsive  symptoms 
over time,7 in contrast to the more static notion of a subtype.

With  regard  to  the  International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD), 
it  appears  that  the  veto  to  diagnose  ASD  in  the  presence  of  ADHD 
will  be  retained  in  the  upcoming  ICD  11th  Revision  (https:// icd. who. 
int/ browse11/ l- m/ en#/ http% 3a% 2f% 2fid. who. int% 2ficd% 2fentity%  
2f821852937).

Overall,  while  these  changes  to  a  degree  reflect  recent  empirical 
evidence and/or practical needs in the diagnostic process, there are still 
issues that need to be addressed. First, current criteria still focus on the 
number of symptoms rather than on a more precise definition of functional 
impairment. This should be a priority for the field and efforts, such as the 
development of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability 
and Health: Child and Youth version, are already ongoing.8 Second, while 
currently  each  of  the  symptoms  listed  in  the  DSM  criterion  A  carries 
the  same  weight,  it  has  been  argued  that  inattention  should  be  more 
heavily  weighted  than  hyperactivity/impulsivity.9  Supporting  evidence, 
which  comes  from  clinical  samples,  needs  to  be  replicated  in  popula-
tion-based studies. Third, from a practical standpoint, it is unclear on how 
to  best  integrate  different  information  sources  (eg,  parents,  teachers, 
etc). Addressing this challenge is pivotal. Fourth, although proposed as a

separate type of ADHD or even a separate diagnostic entity, the extent 
to which the construct of sluggish cognitive tempo (impairment of atten-
tion in hypoactive-appearing individuals) overlaps with ADHD inattentive 
presentation  remains  still  unclear.10  11  Finally,  one  of  the  most  contro-
versial  topics  in  the  entire  field  of  ADHD  research  is  currently  around 
the possibility that ADHD can emerge de novo in adulthood, in contrast 
to  its  conceptualisation  as  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Despite  an 
increasing number of important studies, the controversy is far from being 
solved12 and we expect it will be a major focus of research in the field in 
coming years.

We also expect that proposed radical, although controversial, changes 
in  the  nosographic  approach  to  mental  health  conditions,  such  as  the 
Research  Domain  Criteria  will  significantly  influence  future  research  on 
ADHD.13

epidemiology
One of the most controversial questions in relation to the epidemiology 
of ADHD has been around possible differences in the prevalence of the 
disorder in different countries. In particular, the differential rates of clinical 
diagnosis in North America and Europe are cited by detractors of ADHD, 
as supporting the notion that ADHD is not a ‘real’ disorder but rather a 
social  construct.14  However,  a  meta-analysis  published  in  20071  found 
that diagnostic criteria, source of information, requirement of impairment 
for diagnosis and geographic origin of the studies significantly impacted 
on the estimated pooled rate of ADHD (5.29%). A significant difference 
in prevalence emerged only between North America and both Africa and 
the  Middle  East,  although  evidence  from  non-Western  countries  was 
limited. However, as there were only a limited number of studies avail-
able for Africa and Middle East, these findings should be considered with 
caution. By contrast, no significant differences emerged between Europe 
and  North  America,  suggesting  that  when  using  the  same  diagnostic 
approach the rates of the disorder are fairly consistent in Western coun-
tries, with variability in the prevalence accounted for primarily by methods 
used to diagnose ADHD. Another more recent meta-analysis15 found no 
evidence  to  support  an  increase  in  the  epidemiological  prevalence  of 
ADHD over the past three decades when standardised diagnostic proce-
dures are followed. This implies that the trend for increased rates of diag-
nosis16 are not accounted for by actual increases in prevalence. Rather, 
the mismatch between administrative and epidemiological rates of the 
disorder, which varies between the USA and Europe, is likely accounted 
for by cultural and social factors.16

As the bulk of the available epidemiological studies focus on school-age 
children from North America and Europe, further population-based studies 
from  other  continents  as  well  as  in  preschoolers  and  adults  should  be 
encouraged.  Additionally,  longitudinal  epidemiological  studies  aimed  at 
better  understanding  the  developmental  trajectories  and  predictors  of 
remission/persistence of ADHD in adulthood will be instrumental, along-
side other clinical, neuropsychological, genetic and neuroimaging studies, 
to inform prevention programmes. Development of a standardised defi-
nition of caseness and remission will be pivotal for this body of research 
to be fruitful.

Genetics and environmental causes of Adhd
Studies of twins and adopted children indicate a high heritability for ADHD 
(60%–90%).17 Efforts to find the genes underpinning this heritability have 
been  more  challenging  than  initially  anticipated.  As  for  other  mental 
health conditions, it became clear that ADHD aetiology is accounted for 
by a complex interaction of many genes each with a relatively small effect 
and by gene × environment interactions.18

The  first  approach  to  finding  the  genes  involved  in  ADHD  was  the 
‘candidate gene’ approach. This approach focuses on identifying the vari-
ants in genes coding for proteins hypothesised, a priori, to be involved 
in the pathophysiology of ADHD. These studies identified only about 10 

174

genes as having significant support,19 which together accounted for only 
a small fraction of the total ADHD heritability. The next major approach, 
‘genome-wide  association  studies’  (GWAS),  which  allows  the  analysis 
of a large number of common (ie, present at greater than 5% frequency 
in  the  population)  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  across  the  entire 
genome, was initially unsuccessful in ADHD, as the available sample was 
too small to show a meaningful effect. However, in a major breakthrough, 
the  first  12  independent  loci  have  been  recently  identified  through 
GWAS.20 Associations were enriched in loss-of-function intolerant genes 
and brain-expressed regulatory marks, paving the way for a number of 
novel lines of investigation on the neurobiology of ADHD.

A further recently developed approach focuses on rare (ie, a frequency 
in the general population below 1%) ‘copy number variants’ (CNV). These 
are defined as replications or deletions of the DNA with a length of at 
least 1 kb. CNVs over-represented in ADHD have been detected, but their 
contribution can so far only explain 0.2% of ADHD heritability.21

As  for  environmental  aetiological  factors,  there  have  been,  over  the 
past  years,  considerable  data  suggesting  that  prenatal  and  postnatal 
factors,  such  as  maternal  smoking  and  alcohol  use,  low  birth  weight, 
premature birth and exposure to environmental toxins, such as organo-
phosphate  pesticides,  polychlorinated  biphenyls  and  zinc,  are  asso-
ciated  with  increased  risk  for  ADHD.17  22  However,  except  for  preterm 
birth, genetics studies have implicated unmeasured familial confounding 
factors, which are not in line with a causal role of environmental factors.23
Severe maternal deprivation has also been related to the development 

of ADHD-like symptoms.24

The study of the causes of ADHD still has many unanswered questions. 
We need a better understanding of how genes interact with each other, 
and of the interplay between environmental factors and genes. Genetics 
has the potential to offer many other exciting future avenues of research 
in ADHD. We will only mention briefly here: (1) the use of induced plurip-
otent stem cell derived from peripheral tissue of patients with ADHD and 
used  to  generate  brain  cells  with  the  aim  to  model  brain  circuits  and 
responses to medications or other stressors; (2) the use of zebrafish and 
fruit fly models to augment currently available animal models of ADHD.

neuroimaging and neurocognition
Initial pathophysiological models of ADHD published 20 years ago25 were 
based  on  dysfunctions  in  a  limited  number  of  brain  areas,  namely  the 
frontal  cortex  and  the  basal  ganglia.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  and 
similar  to  other  mental  health  conditions,  a  major  paradigm  shift  from 
alterations in individual brain regions to dysfunction in brain networks has 
begun  to  reshape  our  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology  of  ADHD. 
Structurally,  meta-analyses  and  mega-analyses  of  the  structural  MRI 
studies  conducted  over  the  past  two  decades  pointed  to  consistently 
replicated  alterations  in  the  basal  ganglia,26  and  in  a  number  of  other 
subcortical areas.27 Functionally, a comprehensive meta-analysis28 found 
that the majority of the ADHD-related hypoactivated areas were related 
to the ventral attention and the frontoparietal networks. By contrast, the 
majority  of  ADHD-related  hyperactivated  areas  fell  within  the  default 
mode  network  and  other  hyperactivated  areas  were  within  the  visual 
network. This is in line with the hypothesis that the attentional lapses that 
characterise ADHD result from an inappropriate intrusion of the default 
network in the activity of task-positive networks frontoparietal, ventral or 
dorsal attention networks,28 according to the default network hypothesis 
of ADHD,29 which has been arguably one of the most inspiring proposals 
in the neuroscience of ADHD over the past two decades.

While we have gained insight into the brain networks that are dysfunc-
tional in ADHD and in the delay in cortical maturation,30 we look forward 
to the next generation of neuroimaging studies which we hope will start 
to  translate  these  findings  into  the  clinical  practice.  The  introduction 
of  machine  learning  approaches,  such  as  support  vector  machine,  has 
been welcomed in the field of clinical neuroscience as a way to translate

neuroscientific  findings  at  the  individual  patient  level,  thus  overcoming 
the main limitation of current studies that can only provide results valid at 
the group, rather than individual, level.31 An increasing number of studies 
have used machine learning based on MRI data to validate the diagnosis 
of ADHD with varying degrees of success.32 33

Neurocognitive  studies  have  made  a  considerable  contribution  to 
our understanding of ADHD. In recent years, the field has moved away 
from linear single-cause models of ADHD towards multipathway models 
that emphasise the heterogeneity inherent to ADHD and provide a link 
between  individual  differences  at  the  brain  level  and  clinical  presenta-
tion.34 35

We believe that an interesting line of research for the future will be 
to combine genetics, clinical, neurocognitive and neuroimaging data to 
define,  via  machine  learning  approaches,  response  to  treatment,  toler-
ability  profiles  and  functional  trajectory  of  the  disorder  over  time.  This 
will be a crucial step towards personalised and precision approaches to 
treatment.

treatment
Over the past two decades, there has been a marked increase in the 
number  of  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCT)  aimed  at  testing  the 
short-term efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological treatments for 
ADHD  (both  stimulant  and  non-stimulant  medications).  Most  have 
been  sponsored  by  Big  Pharma  and  were  designed  to  support  the 
licence of the medication. In parallel, due to concerns around possible 
side effects of medications and lack of clarity around their long-term 
effects,  several  lines  of  research  on  non-pharmacological  interven-
tions have been developed. Recent important methodologically sound 
meta-analyses allow us to summarise and critically discuss this large 
body of evidence.

For  the  pharmacological  interventions,  a  comprehensive  network 
meta-analysis36 of 133 double-blind RCTs demonstrated high to moderate 
effect  sizes  (in  terms  of  efficacy)  for  the  different  medications  versus 
placebo.  Standardised  mean  differences  (SMD)  ranged  from  −1.02 
(95% CI −1.19 to −0.85) for amphetamines to −0.56 (95% CI −0.66 
to −0.45) for atomoxetine (methylphenidate: −0.78, 95% CI −0.93 to 
−0.62). In children/adolescents, methylphenidate was the only drug with 
better  acceptability  than  placebo;  in  adults  this  was  the  case  only  for 
amphetamines  (with  no  difference  between  placebo  and  other  active 
drugs). Taking into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this 
meta-analysis supported methylphenidate as preferred first-choice medi-
cation for the short-term treatment of ADHD in children/adolescents and 
amphetamines for adults.

As  for  non-pharmacological  options,  a  comprehensive  synthesis  on 
non-pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents with ADHD 
has been provided in a series of meta-analyses by the European ADHD 
Guidelines  Group  (EAGG).  In  2013,  they  published  a  first  systematic 
review/meta-analysis37 addressing the efficacy of behavioural interven-
tions, diet interventions (restricted elimination diets, artificial food colour 
exclusions  and  free  fatty  acid  supplementation),  cognitive  training  and 
neurofeedback  on  ADHD  core  symptoms  (ie,  inattention,  hyperactivity 
and impulsivity). The systematic review included only RCTs and consid-
ered two contrasting outcomes: those rated by individuals not blinded to 
the treatment condition (active vs control) and those rated by individuals 
who were probably blinded to treatment (eg, teachers in trials assessing 
a behavioural intervention implemented with parents). The results were 
strikingly  different  depending  on  the  type  rater.  When  considering  not 
blinded  ratings,  all  interventions  resulted  significantly  more  efficacious 
than the control condition in terms of reduction of ADHD core symptoms. 
However, when considering the more rigorous probably blinded ratings, 
only free fatty acid supplementation and artificial food colour exclusion 
remained significantly more efficacious than the control conditions, with 
small effect sizes (SMD=0.16 and 0.42, respectively), indicating that the 

clinical impact of these treatments on ADHD core symptoms is, at the 
group level, modest.

Subsequent  EAGG  meta-analyses  focused  on  ADHD  core  symptoms 
and on ADHD-related problems. A meta-analysis38 specifically focusing 
on behavioural interventions showed that, even when considering prob-
ably  blinded  ratings,  the  behavioural  interventions  were  efficacious  at 
improving important aspects  related to ADHD,  namely parenting  (SMD 
for  positive  parenting  0.63;  SMD  for  negative  parenting  0.43)  and 
conduct  problems  (SMD  0.31).  Another  updated  meta-analysis39  on 
cognitive training, which was found efficacious in improving verbal and 
visual working memory, which are impaired in a sizeable portion of chil-
dren with ADHD and have been demonstrated to dissociate from ADHD 
symptoms.40  These  meta-analyses  also  suggest  that  training  which 
targets several neuropsychological aspects may be more efficacious at 
improving  ADHD  symptoms,  than  training  targeting  only  one  aspect  of 
cognitive functioning. The most recent meta-analysis41 by the EAGG on 
neurofeedback did not provide support for the efficacy of neurofeedback 
on any of the neuropsychological and academic outcomes. Overall, this 
body  of  research  does  not  provide  solid  evidence  to  routinely  recom-
mend non-pharmacological interventions as highly effective treatments 
for ADHD core symptoms, although some of them (eg, behavioural inter-
ventions or cognitive training) may be effective for important associated 
impairments  (oppositional  behaviours  and  working  memory  deficits, 
respectively).  The  role  of  fatty  acid  supplementation  and  artificial  food 
colours exclusion as possible treatment strategies should be considered 
cautiously given the small effect size, with CIs close to non-significance.
Probably, the most crucial area of future treatment research in ADHD 
will be to gain insight into the long-term positive and negative effects of 
treatments, using randomised trials with withdrawn designs, as well as 
additional  population-based  studies  with  self-controlled  methodologies 
and longitudinal follow-up studies. These should clarify the conclusions 
from the various follow-up waves of the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD 
(MTA)  study,  showing  that  neither  the  type  and  intensity  of  treatment 
received during the initial 15-month randomised phase of the study (treat-
ment as usual medication (MED), behavioural therapy (BEH), medication 
plus behavioural therapy (COMB)) nor exposure to medication over the 
subsequent  observational  periods  predicted  the  functional  outcome  at 
follow-up which has now extended to 16 years. Of note, in the MTA, the 
treatments received in the three experimental arms (MED, BEH, COMB) 
during  initial  15-month  randomised  phase  were  carefully  crafted  in  an 
attempt to achieve optimal outcomes. After this initial phase all partici-
pants were free to choose the type of treatment they received from their 
regular provider. As it is likely that these treatments were not as carefully 
optimised  and  monitored  as  the  three  experimental  groups  during  the 
randomised  phase, these  longer term findings of the MTA are not easily 
interpretable and might be, to some extent, misleading.

ConClusIons
Many questions have been successfully answered in the field of ADHD. 
Many others remain to be addressed. Additional multidisciplinary collab-
orations, use of large data sets in the spirit of Open Science and support 
of research activities in less advantaged countries are key to address the 
challenge.
