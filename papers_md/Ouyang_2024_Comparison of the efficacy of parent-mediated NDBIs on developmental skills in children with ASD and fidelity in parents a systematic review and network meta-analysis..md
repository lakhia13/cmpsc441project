Abstract 
Background  Recently, studies on behavioral interventions for autism have gained popularity. Naturalistic Devel-
opmental Behavior Interventions (NDBIs) are among the most effective, evidence-based, and widely used behavior 
interventions for autism. However, no research has been conducted on which of the several NDBI methods is most 
effective for parents and children with autism spectrum disorders. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis 
to compare the specific effects of each type of parental-mediated NDBI on children’s developmental skills and parent 
fidelity.

Methods  PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure 
(CNKI), CINAHL, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 30, 2023. A total of 32 randomized 
controlled trial studies that examined the efficacy of different NDBIs were included.

Results  Parents of children with ASD who received Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) reported significant improve-
ments in their children’s social skills (SUCRA, 74.1%), language skills (SUCRA, 88.3%), and parenting fidelity (SUCRA, 
99.5%). Moreover, parents who received Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) reported significant improvements 
in their children’s language (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.79) and motor skills (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.79). In terms 
of the efficacy of improving parent fidelity, the results showed that the Improving Parents as Communication 
Teachers (ImPACT) intervention significantly improved parent fidelity when compared with the treatment-as-usual 
group (TAU) (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.42) and the parental education intervention (PEI) (SMD = 1.10, 95% CI:0.28, 
1.91).There was a difference in parent fidelity among parents who received PRT(SMD = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.26, 4.79) 
or ESDM(SMD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.09) training compared with PEI.

Conclusion  In conclusion, this study revealed that parents can achieve high fidelity with the ImPACT intervention, 
and it can serve as an early first step for children newly diagnosed with ASD. It also showed that parent-mediated 
ESDM is effective in improving language and motor skills for children with ASD and can be used as part of the second 
stage of parent training. Parent-mediated PRT can also be used as a third stage of parent training with sufficient train-
ing intensity to further improve language, social, and motor skills.

Background
Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  a  neurodevelop-
mental  disorder  characterized  by  social  communica-
tion  impairments  and  restricted,  repetitive  behaviors 
[1].  Early  intervention  is  often  strongly  recommended 
for  young  children  with  autism  to  facilitate  develop-
mental skills in key areas to promote positive long-term 
outcomes  [2].  There  are  many  types  of  early  childhood 
interventions  recommended  for  this  population  and 
NDBIs(naturalistic  developmental  behavioral  interven-
tion)are  among  the  most  effective,  evidence-based,  and 
widely used early childhood interventions for autism [3].

NDBIs  are  behavioral  interventions  that  combine 
developmental  psychology  principles  with  those  of 
applied  behavior  analysis  (ABA).  This  method  involves 
sharing control between the child and the therapist, uti-
lizing natural contingencies, and utilizing various behav-
ioral  strategies  to  teach  skills  that  are  developmentally 
appropriate and prerequisite [3]. There are several types 
of  NDBIs  [4–7]  including  PRT  (Pivotal  Response  Treat-
ment),  ESDM  (Early  Start  Denver  Model),  ImPACT 
(Improving  Parents  as  Communication  Teachers),  JAS-
PER  (Joint  Attention,  Symbolic  Play,  Engagement,  and 
Regulation),  ESI  (Early  Social  Interaction),  RIT  (Recip-
rocal  Imitation  Training),  Social  ABCs,  CPMT  (Coop-
erative Parent-Mediated Therapy), which not only follow 
NDBI  principles,  but  have  their  own  characteristics  in 
different functional domains as well.

Grounded  in  Bronfenbrenner’s  [8]  ecological  systems 
theory,  parents  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  early  interven-
tions provided to young children with disabilities, helping 
foster  the  child’s  growth  and  development  [9].  Empow-
ering  families  by  coaching  parents  can  allow  families  to 
play a greater role in promoting children’s skill develop-
ment [10]. Through the parent-mediated NDBI approach, 
parents have more opportunities to intervene with their 
children,  which  increases  the  intensity  of  intervention 
and  can  help  children  maintain  skills  [11].  At  the  same 
time,  parents  can  help  their  children  generalize  skills 
in  more  new  scenarios  [12].  Most  NDBIs  include  a  par-
ent intervention component. In JASPER, PRT, EMT and 
ImPACT,  parents  are  the  main  agents  of  intervention, 
and in ESDM, family intervention is to enhance the inter-
vention  effect  of  the  therapist  [13].  Therefore,  parent-
mediated NDBI is a very promising intervention model.

Many  studies  have  demonstrated  that  parent-medi-
ated NDBI is effective [5, 14], however, parent-mediated 
NDBIs do not have significant effects in all developmen-
tal  skills  [15–17].  Several  reasons  may  explain  this.  (1) 
Autistic  children  have  different  developmental  charac-
teristics.  Since  the  developmental  level,  family  environ-
ment, and severity of symptoms of each autistic child are 
different, there is also extreme heterogeneity in different 

developmental  skills  among  children  with  ASD  [18].  (2) 
Various  NDBI  have  different  focuses.  PRT  emphasizes 
that  interventionists  master  intervention  skills  in  “piv-
otal”  areas  which  are  designed  to  target  motivation  and 
maintain  strong  treatment  fidelity;  ESDM  is  typically 
used  in  children  with  ASD  around  the  ages  of  2  to  5 
years  old,  and  is  a  comprehensive  intervention  that  tar-
gets developmental milestones [11, 19]; JASPER is a low 
intensity intervention for very young children with ASD 
and  older  prelinguistic  individuals  with  ASD,  focusing 
particularly on the foundations of social-communication, 
especially  joint  attention  and  play  [20];  ImPACT  is  a 
short-term parent education program focused on teach-
ing social communication to children with ASD or devel-
opmental language delay [21]; ESI is a comprehensive and 
family-centered  model  for  toddlers  with  ASD  and  their 
families  [22,  23];  RIT  emphasizes  the  social  role  of  imi-
tation  [24];  Social  ABCs  is  an  on-site  parental  interven-
tion training model, the core content includes functional 
language  and  positive  emotion  sharing  [25];  CPMT  is  a 
parent-mediated  intervention  method  that  emphasizes 
cooperative interaction [7]. Many studies have discussed 
the commonalities of NDBIs [4, 26], but no studies have 
examined  the  differences  of  NDBIs  using  quantitative 
method. (3) Parents receive training of varying intensity. 
Studies have shown that the intensity of direct interven-
tion given to autistic children by therapists is not related 
to the child’s later outcomes [27, 28]. However, no studies 
have examined whether increasing the intensity of parent 
training will indirectly affect the efficacy of interventions 
for children.

Since parents have the opportunity to intervene in nat-
ural settings with their autistic children, family interven-
tion needs to be recognized as an important component 
of early intervention. Therefore, it is imperative that cli-
nicians  determine  which  NDBI  is  most  appropriate  for 
the families of children with ASD. However, no research 
has been conducted on which of the several NDBI meth-
ods  are  most  effective  for  parents  and  children  with 
ASD,  thus  significantly  limiting  the  effectiveness  of  the 
NDBI. We, therefore conducted a systematic review and 
network  meta-analysis  of  randomized  controlled  trials 
(RCTs)  to  compare  the  effects  of  different  types  of  par-
ent-mediated NDBI on different developmental domains 
(language, social and motor skills) of children as well as 
parenting  fidelity.  We  hoped  this  meta-analysis  would 
help  clinicians  determine  which  NDBIs  is  the  most 
appropriate for families of children with ASD.

levels,  like  “low  risk”,  “high  risk”  or  “some  concerns”. 
The  evaluation  was  conducted  independently  by  two 
researchers.

All  disagreements  were  solved  by  consensus,  and 
where  consensus  was  not  achieved,  assistance  was 
sought  from  the  statistical  consultation  clinic  of  the 
First Hospital of Jilin University.

Selection criteria

Statistical analyses

The  selection  criteria  were  based  on  PICOS  principle, 
specific  criteria  were  given  in  Table  1.  In  our  study,  the 
control  group  was  divided  into  2  groups,  the  treat  as 
usual  (TAU)  group,  and  the  parent  education  interven-
tion  (PEI)  group.  The  PEI  group  and  the  experimental 
group  used  the  same  intervention  method,  but  the  time 
therapist  guided  for  parents  did  not  exceed  50%  of  the 
experimental  group  [29].  NDBI  methods  with  a  total 
number of studies more than 2 in this meta-analysis are 
classified as Common NDBI, and NDBI methods with a 
total  number  of  studies  less  than  or  equal  to  2  are  clas-
sified  as  Uncommon  NDBI.  Referring  to  previous  simi-
lar studies, the outcome of any measure of ASD children 
and parents was incorporated, including the skills of lan-
guage, social, motor and parent fidelity.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Relevant  data  were  extracted  independently  by  two 
researchers  by  using  standardized  extraction  forms. 
Across all rated items for included studies, agreement on 
calculations was 90%. Disagreements were attributable to 
(1) miscalculations, (2) unidentified outcome.

Risk of bias was rated using the Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 
2.0),  which  were  divided  into  five  domains,  including 
randomization  process,  deviations  from  the  intended 
interventions,  missing  outcome  data,  measurement 
of  the  outcome,  and  selection  of  the  reported  results. 
Each  domain  could  be  ranked  as  three  levels  of  risk 

We carried out network meta-analysis using Stata statis-
tical software 17.0 with Stata packages network, mvmeta, 
metareg,  metan,  metafunnel  and  metaninf.  Publication 
bias was examined using funnel plot analysis [30]. Effect 
size heterogeneity was examined using  I2 as a measure of 
the  proportion  of  true  heterogeneity  to  total  effect  size 
variance. We used the random-effects model rather than 
the fixed-effects model to calculate mean difference effect 
size of parent training on the outcome of child and parent 
because  random-effects  models  are  more  conservative 
[31].  Sensitivity  analysis  was  used  to  assess  the  stability 
of  the  meta-analysis  results  on  the  P  value  of  the  forest 
plot and the ranking of the SUCRA plot. During sensitiv-
ity analysis we excluded studies with a sample size of less 
than  20  and  Uncommon  NDBIs  whose  total  number  of 
studies is less than 3.

Results
Study identification and selection

The  initial  search  yielded  7744  records.  No  additional 
records were identified from other sources of the 7744 
identified  studies,  1604  references  were  duplicates. 
After  screening  the  title/abstracts  and  full-text  infor-
mation,  4672  and  1429  studies  were  excluded,  respec-
tively. Finally, 32 studies that met the inclusion criteria 
were included. The study selection flow chart is shown 
in Fig. 1.

Characteristics of the included studies

These  studies  were  published  between  2006  and  2023. 
They  had  a  combined  sample  size  of  1743  participants, 
ranging  in  age  from  6  months  to  60  months  old  with  a 
median age of 39.06 months (SD = 14.08). Of the 32 stud-
ies included, 21 were conducted in the USA, 6 in China, 
1  in  Ireland,  1  in  Canada,  1  in  India,  and  2  in  Italy. The 
major characteristics of the included studies is presented 
in Table 2.

The NDBI subgroups included in this study were PRT 
(n = 5),  ImPACT  (n = 5),  RIT  (n = 1),  JASPER  (n = 6), 

ESDM  (n = 9),  ESI  (n = 2),  Social  ABCs  (n = 1)  and 
CPMT  (n = 2)  and  other  NDBI(n = 1).  Different  parent 
training  methods  included  individual  courses  (n = 23), 
group(n = 4),  Individual  courses  plus  group(n = 5).  The 
mean  (SD)  duration  of  intervention  was  21.34 ± 23.00 
weeks.  Children’s  outcomes  were  mainly  assessed  using 
developmental scales (Mullen, GDS, VB-MAPP、VABS); 
and  scales  assessing  autistic  traits  (ADOS-II,  CARS, 
SRS, SCQ). The parents’ fidelity scales were based on the 
EMDS,  ImPACT,  RIT,  or  self-made  scales.  The  majority 
of  the  selected  assessment  tools  were  administered  by

“researchers” in this study. Assessment tools that include 
parental reports were used in only five studies. The over-
all network map of different NDBIs is shown in Fig. 2.

Risk of bias in the included studies

During  the  randomization  process,  three  studies  were 
deemed  high-risk  due  to  the  absence  of  randomization 
[32,  37,  36].  In  terms  of  outcome  measurement,  three 
studies  were  considered  high-risk:  one  due  to  parental 

completion  of  assessments  [35],  and  the  other  for  the 
use of self-made scale [34] and reliance on a single scale 
throughout the research [23]. The remaining studies were 
categorized as low risk or presented some concerns. The 
overall risk of bias assessment for the included studies is 
depicted in Fig. 3. Specific results of risk of bias and pub-
lication bias can be seen in Appendix S2 and S3.

Parent fidelity

This  meta-analysis  revealed  that  most  interventions 
exhibited  a  significant  difference  in  parent  fidelity

-0.01  to  1.95).  For  instance,  the  ImPACT  interven-
tion  significantly  improved  parent  fidelity  compared 
to  TAU  (SMD = 0.90,  95%  CI:  0.39  to  1.42)  and  PEI 
(SMD = 1.10,  95%  CI:  0.28  to  1.91).  Similarly,  the  RIT 
intervention showed positive outcomes in parent fidel-
ity  (SMD  =  -3.32,  95%  CI:  1.60  to  5.03).  Additionally, 
the  Social  ABCs  group  exhibited  significantly  higher 
parent  fidelity  than  the  TAU  group  (SMD = 4.02,  95% 

CI:  3.14  to  4.91).  Conversely,  no  significant  difference 
in parental fidelity was observed with the ESDM inter-
ventions  (SMD = 0.91,  95%  CI:  -0.03  to  1.85);  however, 
the  level  of  fidelity  varied  significantly  with  the  train-
ing’s intensity high or low (SMD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.76 to 
2.09).  In  the  PRT  intervention,  a  notable  difference  in 
parent fidelity was observed between lower and higher 
intensity PEI (SMD = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.26 to 4.79). How-
ever, In the case of the JASPER intervention, increasing 
training intensity did not improve parent fidelity (SMD 
= -0.26, 95% CI: -0.76 to 0.25). A detailed description of 
parent fidelity is provided in Table 3.

Language skills of children with ASD

Overall, there is a difference in the development of chil-
dren’s language skills between parents who receive train-
ing  and  those  who  do  not  (SMD = 0.40,  95%  CI:  0.15, 
0.65).  However,  the  intensity  of  the  training—whether 
more or less intensive—does not affect the development 
of  these  skills  (SMD  =-0.02,  95%  CI:  -0.33,  0.29).  Nota-
bly,  a  significant  difference  is  observed  only  when  the 
ESDM  is  employed,  distinguishing  between  trained  and 
untrained parents (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.79).

Social skills of children with ASD

Regarding  children’s  social  skills,  we  found  a  statically 
significance difference on whether parents have received 
training (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.80) and the level of 
training intensity, whether high or low (SMD = 0.41, 95% 
CI: 0.07, 0.74). However, in the context of common NDBI, 
no  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed. 
Conversely,  within  the  realm  of  uncommon  NDBIs,  ESI 
(SMD = 0.70,  95%  CI:  0.01,  1.38)  and  RIT  (SMD = 0.49, 
95% CI: 0.18, 0.80) have demonstrated notable efficacy.

Motor skills of children with ASD

In  terms  of  motor  skills  development,  there  is  a  nota-
ble  overall  difference  between  children  of  parents  who 
received  training  and  those  who  did  not  (SMD = 0.48, 
95% CI: 0.21, 0.74). In this study, a significant difference 
in children’s motor skills was observed in the context of 

the  ESDM  training  (SMD = 0.44,  95%  CI:  0.09  to  0.79). 
However, when PRT (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: -0.09 to 1.01) 
or  ESI  (SMD = 0.63,  95%  CI:  -0.05  to  1.31)  were  imple-
mented, the differences in motor skills development were 
not statistically significant.

Ranking the parent‑mediated NDBIs in different 
developmental domains

PRT  emerged  as  the  top-ranked  intervention  across  sev-
eral domains: it achieved the highest scores in social skills 
(SUCRA,  74.1%),  language  skills  (SUCRA,  88.3%),  and 
parent  fidelity  (SUCRA,  99.5%).  ESDM  ranked  second  in 
these  domains,  with  scores  of  (SUCRA,  67.3%)  in  social 
skills,  (SUCRA,  67.5%)  in  language  skills,  and  (SUCRA, 
63.8%)  in  parent  fidelity.  ImPACT  and  JASPER  were 
closely matched as the third highest-ranking interventions, 
with  scores  in  social  skills  (SUCRA,  60.7%;  54.0%,  ),  lan-
guage skills (SUCRA, 35.4% and 36.5%), and parent fidelity 
(SUCRA, 43.5% and 48.4%).

Subsequent  to  a  sensitivity  analysis,  the  overall  forest 
maps remained relatively stable, though there were some 
shifts in the rankings across domains. Due to the limited 
number  of  studies  in  some  Naturalistic  Developmental 
Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) subgroups, and because 
not all outcomes covered every domain, we excluded the 
SUCRA  values  of  less  common  NDBIs  from  the  main 
domains  in  our  post-analysis  refinement.  This  step  was 
taken to minimize potential errors in the study. Detailed

Discussion
The  purpose  of  the  current  study  was  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  of  various  NDBIs  across  multiple  domains: 
children’s  language,  social  and  motor  skills,  and  paren-
tal  fidelity.  Initially,  the  effectiveness  of  different  NDBIs 
was  compared  against  the  TAU  group  to  ascertain  their 
relative  impact  across  these  domains.  Subsequently, 
a  comparison  with  the  PEI  group  was  conducted  to 
assess  variations  in  intervention  intensity  for  parents. 
Finally, the study aimed to rank the different intervention 
methods  based  on  their  effectiveness  in  each  respective 
domain.

The  analysis  revealed  that  ImPACT  is  more  readily 
operationalized by parents in terms of achieving fidelity. 
In contrast, PRT and the ESDM necessitate a heightened 
intensity  of  parent  training  to  attain  comparable  levels 
of  fidelity.  Specifically,  parent-mediated  ESDM  demon-
strates  notable  improvements  in  language  and  motor 
skills  among  children  with  ASD.  Furthermore,  when 
administered  with  sufficient  training  intensity,  parent-
mediated  PRT  shows  promising  potential  in  enhanc-
ing  children’s  language  abilities,  social  interactions,  and 
motor skills.

Recent  research  suggests  that  high-fidelity  parent 
implementation of intervention combined with frequent 
opportunities  for  results  in  the  greatest  child  gains  [26, 
38].  A  study  of  parent  fidelity  in  P-ESDM  showed  that 
only  about  half  of  the  studies  met  the  criteria  for  fidel-
ity  [39],  in  this  study,  there  was  no  significant  differ-
ence  between  parents  who  received  ESDM  training  and 
the  TAU  group. This  may  be  because  the  ESDM  system 

emphasizes  that  parents  only  assist  in  enhancing  the 
effects of the therapist’s intervention [13], so the intensity 
of  parent  training  may  not  be  enough,  however,  signifi-
cant differences can be seen in ESDM training for parents 
under  large  or  small  intervention  intensity,  which  once 
again  proves  that  the  original  parent  training  intensity 
of  ESDM  is  not  enough.  In  ImPACT,  good  parent  fidel-
ity  is  shown,  which  may  be  related  to  its  flexible  online 
course  model  and  complete  teaching  manual  [21].  After 
indirect  comparison,  this  study  concluded  that  PRT  is  a 
more  effective  method  to  improve  parent  fidelity  than 
ImPACT. The pace and difficulty level of teaching of PRT 
are constantly individualized based on a child’s skills and 
motivation, and the instructional cues and materials are 
varied to help children broaden their attention and gen-
eralize  learning  from  the  outset  [40],  so  PRT  is  difficult 
to understand immediately. Our research shows that par-
ents who receive higher-intensity PRT training show bet-
ter fidelity, which is contrary to the study of Svetlana [41]. 
In their study, PRT was used to train parents in specific 
language  skills,  which  cannot  fully  convince  researchers 
that  PRT’s  short-term  parent  training  can  achieve  good 
fidelity  among  parents  in  all  domains  of  children.  We 
believe  that  more  intensive  PRT  training  is  needed  for 
parents  to  achieve  fidelity  standards.  According  to  cur-
rent research, JASPER is not the best choice for improv-
ing parent fidelity. RIT and Social ABCs have shown the 
potential to improve parent fidelity. This may be because 
RIT  only  emphasizes  imitation  [24],  which  is  easy  for 
parents  to  understand,  while  Social  ABCs  emphasizes 
step-by-step real-time teaching [25], making it easier for 
parents to combine theory and practice.

With  growing  globalization,  interconnectedness,  and 
complexity  of  our  societies,  social  skills  have  become 
increasingly  important  which  not  only  promotes  good 
cooperation,  but  also  helps  us  achieve  good  mental 
health [42]. However, social impairment is the core defect 
of ASD, and it is difficult to fundamentally improve it [1]. 
In this study, overall parent-mediated NDBI can enhance 
the social skills of children with ASD, which is consistent 
with the meta-analysis results of Micheal Sandbank [27]. 
In  the  meta-analysis  of  each  NDBI  methods,  significant 
effects cannot be directly seen, which may still be related 
to the risk of bias in studies. Through indirect compari-
son, the best way to improve the social skills of children 
with ASD through parent training is PRT.

The World Health Organization has identified language 
as 1 of the domains of development that is associated with 
not  only  early  learning  and  academic  success  but  also 
economic  participation  and  health  across  the  lifespan 
[29].  Among  children  with  ASD,  many,  except  Asperger 
children, have language delays [43]. In terms of children’s 
language  skills,  this  study  shows  that  parent-mediated 

 Ouyang et al. BMC Pediatrics          (2024) 24:270 

Page 10 of 12

ESDM  has  a  good  effect.  This  result  is  consistent  with 
Elizabeth’s  review  study  [15].  A  meta-analysis  showed 
that  PRT  can  significantly  improve  the  language  skill  of 
children with ASD [17], in our research, when compared 
with  various  NDBIs,  parent-mediated  PRT  was  the  best 
method  to  improve  language  function  in  children  with 
ASD, while in direct comparison of control group, it can-
not directly reflect its superiority in improving language 
in  children  with  ASD,  which  may  have  something  to  do 
with  parents’  accumulation  of  professional  knowledge, 
and further research is needed.

Motor  coordination  deficits  are  commonly  found  in 
people with ASD [44]. The most critical one is the inte-
gration  disorder  of  motor  and  social  information  [45]. 
ESDM  has  detailed  gross  and  fine  motor  development 
milestone  targets,  and  emphasizes  the  coordination  of 
eyes and movements [46]. In our research, ESDM showed 
good  efficacy  in  improving  the  motor  skills  of  children 
with autism. In indirect comparison, PRT showed better 
efficacy than ESDM, and further direct demonstration is 
needed in follow-up studies.

In  general,  the  quality  of  most  of  the  included  studies 
was  relatively  high,  while  heterogeneity  was  low.  Read-
ers  should,  however,  be  aware  of  the  following  limita-
tions  when  interpreting  the  results  of  this  study:  There 
are few studies on uncommon NDBIs, and a large num-
ber of studies are needed to demonstrate their effects in 
various  domains;  Another  issue  that  requires  attention 
is  the  diversity  of  the  measures  used  to  evaluate  inter-
vention  outcomes.  For  autistic  children,  proximity  and 
boundedness  of  outcome  cannot  be  ignored.  Outcomes 
that  were  coded  as  proximal  to  the  intervention  tends 
to  have  significantly  larger  effects  than  those  that  were 
coded  as  distal.  Compared  to  context-bound  outcomes, 
the effect sizes were usually smaller for outcomes coded 
as  generalized  or  potentially  context-bound  [5].  Moreo-
ver, the evaluation results reported by some parents may 
lack objectivity due to parents’ insufficient understanding 
for children’s normal development and behavior [4]. For 
parents, a unified standard is needed to put into practice 
for the evaluation of the parent fidelity of NDBI, so as to 
compare  the  efficacy  between  different  parent-mediated 
NDBI [6].

Conclusions
In  conclusion,  this  study  demonstrated  that  parent-
mediated ImPACT interventions are effective in achiev-
ing  high  fidelity  among  parents,  positioning  them  as 
a  suitable  initial  intervention  for  children  recently 
diagnosed  with  ASD.  In  the  subsequent  phase  of  par-
ent  training,  parent-mediated  ESDM  has  been  shown 
to  enhance  language  and  motor  skills  in  children  with 

ASD.  Finally,  with  adequate  training  intensity,  parent-
mediated  PRT  shows  potential  for  further  enhance-
ments  in  language,  social,  and  motor  skills.  This 
positions  it  as  an  integral  third  stage  in  a  structured 
and  comprehensive  parent  training  program  for  chil-
dren with ASD.
