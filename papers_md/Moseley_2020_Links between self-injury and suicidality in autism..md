Abstract

Background: Autistic individuals without intellectual disability are at heightened risk of self-injury, and appear to
engage in it for similar reasons as non-autistic people. A wide divergence of autistic perspectives on self-injury,
including those who frame it as a helpful coping mechanism, motivate investigating the link between self-injury,
suicide ideation, and attempts which has been reported in typically developing individuals.
Method: One hundred three autistic participants completed the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool (NSSI-AT),
the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-R), and the Interpersonal Social Evaluation List (ISEL-12) across two online
studies. Logistic regression was conducted to predict self-harming status via responses to questions on suicidality,
and to predict whether certain self-injurious behaviors, including cutting, were especially associated with suicide
ideation and attempts. Non-parametric correlation analysis examined relationships between suicide ideation/
attempts and other variables that might characterize self-harmers especially at risk of suicidality. These included
perceived access to social support, purposes or reasons for self-injury, the number of different self-injurious
behaviors engaged in, the duration and lifetime incidence of self-injury, and the individual’s feelings about their
self-injury.
Results: While self-injuring status was significantly predicted by responses to a question on suicide ideation and
attempts, there was no relationship between suicide ideation/attempts and a participant’s personal feelings about
their self-injury. The method of cutting was also predicted by suicide ideation and attempts, though other methods
common in autistic people were at borderline significance. Use of self-injury for the regulation of low-energy
emotional states like depression, for self-punishment or deterrence from suicide, and for sensory stimulation, was
associated with suicide ideation and attempts, as was the number of self-injurious behaviors engaged in. There was
no significant relationship between suicide ideation/attempts and the duration and lifetime incidence of self-injury
or social support.
Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that while individuals might frame their self-injury as a positive or
neutral thing, there remains a concerning relationship between self-injury and suicidality which exists regardless of
individual feelings on self-injury. This is consistent with the theoretical perspective that self-injury can be a
“gateway” through which individuals acquire capability for lethal suicidal behaviors. The data highlight that
particular methods (cutting) and reasons for self-injury may be of significant concern, but this information, which
might be of extreme value for clinicians, requires further investigation and validation.

effective method of

Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI; otherwise known as self-
mutilation or self-harm) describes the causing of deliber-
ate physical injury to the body without suicidal intent
[1]. Self-injurious behaviors are diverse, with such exam-
ples as cutting, scratching, burning, or hitting oneself.
From the outside, these behaviors are counterintuitive,
bizarre, and frightening to the onlooker, but self-injury
is believed to fulfill particular functions, or meet certain
needs, which an individual may only partially understand
[1]. From this approach, self-injury is a negatively or
positively reinforced behaviour which functions1 “as an
regulating one’s
immediately
affective/cognitive experience and/or influencing one’s
social environment” (Nock 2010, p.10). Accordingly,
NSSI may serve at an interpersonal level to influence the
behavior of others (for instance, to stop a parent’s de-
mands) or to communicate or express one’s own distress
(e.g., to gain affection). Intrapersonally, it may be posi-
tively or negatively reinforced as a private means of sen-
sory stimulation or emotion regulation,
for instance
through the satisfaction an individual gains from self-
punishment. NSSI may have different functional roles
(i.e., be performed for different reasons) depending on
the occasion [1–5], and may sit alongside other mal-
adaptive behaviors (such as substance abuse and disor-
dered eating) which function in the same way and meet
the same needs. Conversely, while some individuals report
engaging in self-injury as a means of avoiding more dan-
gerous, suicidal behaviors, NSSI is closely related to sui-
cidal thoughts and behavior [6–15]. It appears to be a
“time-invariant” or longitudinal predictor of suicide at-
tempts [12], with authors suggesting that the capacity for
self-injury is a “gateway” to suicidal behaviors [16], per-
haps through increased tolerance to pain, reduced fear of
death, and increased desire for death, habituation to the
effects of self-injury, or other mechanisms [17–19]. In-
deed, the current leading model of suicidality [20, 21] sug-
gests that acquired capability for suicide is required to
transform suicidal intent into suicide readiness and at-
tempts. Though provocative and painful incidents (such
as violent incidents and abuse) are one means of acquiring
capability for suicide through increasing tolerance for pain
and fearlessness of death, NSSI is one of the most direct
mechanisms by which people move from suicidal intent to
being capable of lethal attempts [22, 23].

1By using functional behavioral language to describe the “reasons” and
motivations behind self-injury, we attempt to capture the fact that an
individual may not make conscious or reasoned decisions to self-
injure, and, indeed, that they may not fully understand why self-injury
appears to help them. As used by Nock (2010), this terminology coa-
ches self-injury in behavioral terms where antecedents and consequent
events, through which behaviors are reinforced and maintained, are
highly relevant. This approach, the author argues, lends itself to devel-
oping interventions.

One population at especial risk of suicidality is people
with autism spectrum conditions (ASC; hereafter “aut-
ism”) [24–32]. ASC are neurodevelopmental conditions
characterized by difficulties with social communication
and relationships, and by repetitive and restricted pat-
terns of behaviour and interests [33]. Tragically, by the
age of ten, autistic children are already at significantly
greater risk of suicide ideation and attempts [25], and
from this age the risk only increases. In the USA, the
prevalence of autism was recently estimated at 1 in 68
children [34], illustrating a great need for support and
intervention to address this elevated risk. Given the
established link between NSSI and suicide in the general
public, the fact that autistic people appear to have higher
rates of suicide and of self-injury [35–37] may not be
coincidental.

Investigations of NSSI in autism are still very limited;
the majority of these pertain to the high-frequency be-
haviors such as head-banging and biting that are often
seen in minimally verbal individuals with intellectual dis-
abilities, and which tend to be classified as an aspect of
the stereotyped repetitive and restricted behaviors inher-
ent to the diagnosis [36–38]. These behaviors have been
differentiated from the type of self-injury (NSSI) de-
scribed above in the typically developing population.
Only recently has self-injury been examined in autistic
people without intellectual disability, the subset of the
spectrum at greater risk of suicidality [29, 30, 32, 39]
and whom appear to engage in self-injury in very similar
ways to non-autistic people in so far as age of onset,
methods used, and the functional purpose that self-
injury serves [35]. The only apparent differences in this
analysis were that autistic individuals were more likely
to use self-injury as a means of shocking or hurting
others, imitating peers, or avoiding more severe suicidal
behaviors.

Our own group conducted a more in-depth analysis of
self-injury in 103 autistic adults without intellectual im-
pairment [40]. As in the previously described study [35],
we corroborated an average onset age in adolescence;
the most common methods of self-injury (scratching/
pinching and cutting) and most common bodily loca-
tions (arms and hands); and most common initial moti-
vations (anger at the self and upset, though a large
proportion of our participants claimed to have stumbled
on self-injury “accidentally” and found it served a func-
tional purpose, i.e., in fulfilling some need). We found
that the most common functional purpose of self-injury
was to regulate low-energy affective states such as de-
pression or numbness; the second most common was to
regulate high-energy affective states such as anger or agi-
tation. This was followed by use of self-injury for self-
punishment and/or deterrence from suicide, for sensory
for social communication and
stimulation, and lastly,

expression. Our qualitative analysis greatly expanded on
the needs that NSSI fulfills in autistic people. Partici-
pants spoke of low confidence, low self-esteem, and in-
deed self-hatred in relation to self-injury. They also
spoke of emotions such as anger, frustration, anxiety,
and stress (or unnamed “emotional pain,” “pressure,” or
“hurting inside”) as triggers for self-injury, and that be-
ing able to identify and verbalize their emotions was
helpful in controlling self-injury. This interestingly cor-
roborated our quantitative analysis, where alexithymia
(an often comorbid difficulty identifying one’s own emo-
tions) was a predictor of self-injury. Sensory issues were
also identified as triggers, and were again corroborated
as a predictor of self-injury in our quantitative analysis.
That both alexithymia and sensory disturbances are pre-
dictive of self-injury in autistic people is consistent with
the prevalence of these features in other self-harming
populations, and with the relationship that both alex-
ithymia and sensory differences show with internalizing
ill-health in autism [41–46].
symptoms and/or mental
Alexithymia is higher than average in adolescent self-
harmers and is a well-known correlate of self-injury in
clinical populations [47–49]. Sensory disturbances have
been a topic of interest as pertains to self-injury in autis-
tic children and teenagers with and without intellectual
disability. In these groups [36, 50], much as in our adult
sample, atypical sensory experiences have been seen to
predict self-injurious behavior. Self-injurious behavior
was also seen to be associated with alterations to som-
atosensory cortices [51], though these differences might
reflect brain plasticity in response to repetitive self-
injury rather than pre-existing and potentially causal dif-
ferences. While NSSI often serves multiple functions
simultaneously, self-injury to obtain sensory stimulation
is often referred to as “automatically reinforcing” be-
cause regardless of changes the behavior might produce
in the environment, the sensory experience it produces
is reinforcing by itself [52]—for instance, by regulating
hypo- or hyper-arousal [50].

Our previous study drew short of studying the link be-
tween self-injury and suicidality in autism. This relation-
ship is currently underexplored, though there is some
early evidence from Cassidy and colleagues that lifetime
incidence of self-injury confers a heightened risk of
suicidality much as it does in the non-autistic literature
[53]. These authors, however, used a dichotomous
categorization of participants as self-harmers or non-
self-harmers, without consideration of whether NSSI
was historic or current. Moreover, they did not consider
additional nuances, such as whether the functional pur-
poses which motivate self-injury affect the relationship
between NSSI and suicidality. Following on from our
previous work, we query whether the conscious perspec-
tives or meanings ascribed to NSSI are also important

determinants of the suicide risk faced by individuals who
self-harm. Our qualitative findings [40] suggested a strik-
ing dichotomy between participants who expressed dis-
tress and/or a lack of conscious control over NSSI, and
those who framed it as a conscious choice, a neutral or
even positive option to deal with “overwhelming feelings,”
“stressful situations,” or even “to achieve homeostasis”.
This diversity was also manifest in the quantitative data,
where 17% of self-harming participants did not perceive
their self-injury as problematic in their lives, 14% were
neutral about it, 24% saw perceived it as quite problem-
atic, and 9% found it strongly problematic. Furthermore,
asked what they wanted others to know about helping a
loved one with self-injury, our participants highlighted the
need to recognize individuality within the self-harming
autistic population; to avoid common assumptions about
self-injury; and to recognize where self-injury might be
serving a functional, even positive, goal, and where auto-
matically assuming it to be a bad thing might even be
unhelpful.

As it stands, the association between NSSI and suicide
attempts, robust in the neurotypical literature and emer-
ging in the field of autism research [53], justifies concern
and action on the part of clinicians, educators, and loved
ones. The perplexing diversity of perspectives and rea-
sons for self-injury in our sample, however, imply that to
identify those individuals most at risk, a more nuanced
examination of autistic self-harmers may be beneficial.
In autistic people, does engaging in self-injury result in
increased risk of suicidality regardless of the functional
purpose that NSSI serves, and/or regardless of the mean-
ing an individual attributes to their self-injury? Alterna-
is the risk of suicidality associated with the
tively,
functional role that NSSI plays, and/or how people feel
about it? There is some precedent, from non-autistic sam-
ples, that the functional purpose or reason why people en-
gage in NSSI may indeed confer additional suicide risk.
Those who engage in NSSI for emotion regulation or self-
punishment have been found to be particularly at risk of
suicide ideation and attempts [54, 55], as are those who
engage in NSSI exclusively whilst alone—the lack of an
audience for social communication or influence was inter-
preted by the authors as reflecting use of NSSI for emo-
tion regulation or self-punishment [56].

There may be other variables that distinguish some
self-harming individuals as being particularly at risk for
suicidality. Individuals who self-injure seem to be at par-
ticular risk of suicide attempts the longer their history of
NSSI, the frequency of self-injury, the greater the num-
ber of methods they use, and the less physical pain they
experience [9, 14]. A weaker predictor is the method of
cutting in particular [14]: cutting is believed to reflect
greater exposure to physical pain and damage and thus
increased capacity for suicide attempts, and is suggested

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14 

Page 4 of 15

to be more closely related to mental illness than other
forms of self-injury such as head-banging [57]. Depres-
sion and hopelessness seem to present an additional risk,
as does low self-esteem [58]; in contrast, psychological
factors such as attribution style, self-forgiveness, and
feelings of agency may confer resilience [59–61]. Social
support, or indeed perceived social support, also de-
creases the risk of self-injury turning to suicide attempts
[62]. Parental support especially reduces the likelihood
of suicide attempts in young self-harmers [16, 58], and
appears to be further helpful in moderating the likeli-
hood that bullied individuals will self-injure [63]. Of
course, given the prevalence of NSSI in adolescents,
these investigations of that sample may not hold true for
an autistic adult group, many of whom may not have
parental support.

The present study attempted to extend the previous
in-depth investigation of self-injury by exploring its
relationship with suicide ideation and attempts.
In
particular, we focused on whether the presence of
self-injury predicted suicide ideation or attempts;
whether there was an association between how indi-
viduals felt about self-harming and suicide ideation
statements
and attempts; whether endorsement of
(or
functions
about different
needs it fulfills) were associated with suicide ideation
and attempts. We also looked at relationships be-
tween suicidality and duration of NSSI, whether range
of self-injurious behaviors predict suicidality as they
do in non-autistic populations, and whether partici-
pants who cut were at particular risk. As our partici-
pants were adults and unlikely to have the same level
of parental support as the studies reflecting this as a
moderator in teenagers, we looked instead at whether
perceived social support was associated with lower
suicide ideation and attempts.

Methods
Participants
This study was advertised to participants as an investiga-
tion of stress and physical and mental health. We invited
back autistic participants from the previous investigation
into self-injury [40], who had been recruited from sup-
port groups local to the primary researcher (Dorset),
from social media, and from the Cambridge Autism Re-
search Database (CARD) at the Autism Research Centre,
Cambridge, UK. There was a high rate of return with 82
participants responding (80% of the original sample).
We additionally advertised the study on Facebook sup-
port groups run by and for autistic people. Of those who
responded to this call, 20 were willing to complete the
Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool (NSSI-AT) as
an optional extra, such that we possessed data from the
three measures needed in the current analysis.

In total, therefore, 102 autistic participants were in-
cluded in the analysis. The group consisted of 29 males
and 73 females, with an overall average age of 42.6 years
(SD 14, range 54). The average age at diagnosis was
34 years (though there was a large SD of 17.2 years). The
majority of participants, 66, were British (65%), after
which the biggest minority was American (11 participants,
11%); the remaining participants hailed from Australia,
New Zealand, Canada, Germany,
the Netherlands,
Finland, Ireland, Hungary, Venezuela, and the Czech
Republic. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the study,
diagnoses could not be independently verified by the re-
search group, but participants reported the date, location,
and precise diagnosis given, along with any additional
diagnoses.

IQ measures were not obtained, but it is highly likely
that all participants were in the range of normal to high
IQ: all but two participants (2%) were qualified to at
least GCSE-level, and 62 (61%) had a degree. The late
average age of diagnosis further corroborates the prob-
ability that participants had cognitive skills (and, poten-
tially, camouflage skills) at the level that allowed them to
elude diagnosis as children, members of the “lost gener-
ation” described by Lai and Baron-Cohen (2015). Fifty-
one (50%) of the participants were employed at the time
of the study, and 12 (12%) were involved in a voluntary
job. The vast majority, 79 participants (77%), reported
additional psychiatric diagnoses, among which the most
common were depression (61 participants, 60%) and
anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety, social
anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobias,
and post-traumatic stress disorder
(54 participants,
53%): scores on the Beck Depression Inventory [64] and
the Beck Anxiety Inventory [65] corroborated high aver-
age scores for depression and anxiety in the group (an
average of 22.4 and 22.8, respectively, scores which indi-
cate moderate to severe depression and moderate anxiety).
Other diagnoses included psychosis, eating disorders, bi-
polar disorder, and personality disorders. Thirteen partici-
pants reported an additional diagnosis of ADHD/ADD
(13%); dyslexia, dyspraxia, or specific learning disability
were reported by 13 participants (13%). Fifty participants
(49%) were taking psychotropic medication at the time of
the study.

Materials
The data being collected across the course of two online
studies, participants completed a number of question-
naires and tasks which will be presented elsewhere in
forthcoming publications. As such, we describe in detail
only those questionnaires which pertain to the present
analysis: the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool
(NSSI-AT), the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised
(SBQ-R), and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14 

Page 5 of 15

12. These were hosted on an online platform (Qualtrics)
for participants to complete in their own time, with sup-
port provided over email if needed.

The Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool
As stated previously, the majority of participants [2] (82)
completed this measure as part of a previous study [40]
and then completed the SBQ-R and the Interpersonal
Social Evaluation List (ISEL-12) in the context of the
new study. The small remainder (22) completed the
SBQ-R and the ISEL-12 first in the context of the new
study, and were then willing to complete the NSSI-AT
as an optional extra. This comprehensive clinical assess-
ment of self-injury documents the nature and bodily lo-
cation of any self-injurious behaviors; their functional
i.e., an individual’s awareness of what NSSI
purpose,
does for them, the need that it fulfills; the recency and
frequency of self-injury, and the likelihood that it will re-
occur in future; the age of onset of self-injury; the sever-
ity of injuries (based on whether these did or should
have received medical attention); the social and habitual
routines or context around self-injurious behaviors (if,
for example,
individuals always make sure they are
alone); the degree to which participants are habituated
to the occurrence of self-injurious behavior; and whether
individuals have sought therapy, their experiences in
therapy, and their experiences of telling others about
their self-injury. In our previous study, we categorized
participants as non-self-harmers, historic self-harmers
(those who had last self-harmed more than 2 years ago
and judged themselves unlikely to do it again), and
current self-harmers. As the literature suggests that
NSSI is a time-invariant, longitudinal risk factor for sui-
cidality, this step was deemed unjustified for the present
study, and we simply categorized participants as self-
harmers or non-self-harmers based on the current or
historic presence of self-injurious behaviors.

social

communication and expression,

The NSSI-AT includes a number of statements en-
dorsing functional roles or purposes of self-injury. These
include statements about NSSI for the purpose of regu-
lating low-energy emotions, regulating high-energy emo-
self-
tions,
punishment and deterrence from suicide, and for sen-
sory stimulation. As in previous investigations [2, 35],
we collapsed responses of “strongly” and “somewhat
agree” to indicate affirmation of that functional role (and
thus a score of 1), and collapsed responses of “strongly”
or “somewhat disagree” to indicate denial of that role
(thus a score of zero). For each participant, we scored
the number of statements endorsed for each functional
role or purpose of NSSI.

The NSSI-AT also yields the onset of self-injury, such
that we could calculate the duration of NSSI by subtract-
ing this from a participant’s age. Of interest was also the

“range” of NSSI, which we quantified by giving a score
of 1 for each type of NSSI engaged in, such that higher
scores indicated that participants engaged in a greater
number of diverse self-injurious behaviors than individ-
uals who consistently used one or two methods, irre-
spective of
frequency (for instance, a person could
engage in several different self-injurious behaviors, but
may engage in them less frequently than a person who
only engages in one select self-injurious behaviour). Fi-
nally, to quantify how participants felt about self-injury,
we coded responses to the statement “The fact that I
intentionally hurt myself is a problem in my life”: re-
sponses of “strongly disagree” received 0, “slightly dis-
agree” received 1, “neither agree nor disagree” received
2, “slightly agree” received 3, and “strongly agree” re-
ceived 4.

The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised
The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire Revised (SBQ-R)
[66] allows clinicians to assess current and lifetime sui-
cide ideation and attempts extremely quickly and con-
cisely. The four items assess the occurrence of lifetime
suicide ideation and/or attempts; the occurrence of sui-
cide ideation in the last year; whether the person has
ever confided suicidal intentions to somebody; and the
estimated likelihood that they will attempt suicide 1 day.
While it affords a sum suicidality score, we focused on
the single item assessing lifetime suicide ideation or at-
tempts. To the question “Have you ever thought about
or attempted to kill yourself?”, “Never” received a score
of 1, and “It was just a brief passing thought” a score of
2. Scores of 3 were given to participants who endorsed
one of two statements describing suicide ideation (“I
have had a plan at least once to kill myself but did not
try to do it” or “I have had a plan at least once to kill
myself and really wanted to die”). Scores of 4 were given
to those who, in choosing one of two statements (“I have
attempted to kill myself, but did not want to die” or “I
have attempted to kill myself and really hoped to die”),
indicated that they had made suicide attempts.

Interpersonal Support Evaluation List 12
The Interpersonal Social Evaluation List (ISEL-12) [67]
yields a total score for perceived social support, which
crucially affects physical and mental health and buffers
the effect of stressors [68, 69]. It is comprised of individ-
ual subscales measuring availability of guidance/advice
(appraisal), feelings of acceptance (belonging), and avail-
ability of concrete material or financial aid (tangible).
Here, we used simply the summary score reflecting over-
all perceived social support.

The NSSI-AT was completed as part of the first study,
and the ISEL-12 and SBQ-R as part of the second. There

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14

was, at most 6 months, between participants completing
both parts.

Analysis
A number of the variables in this investigation were
nominal, including the dichotomous presence or absence
of self-injury, and whether or not an individual engaged
in cutting. Ordinal variables were also involved, such as
the scores yielded by the SBQ-R item assessing suicide
ideation or attempts (“Never” a score or 1, “passing
thoughts of suicide” a score of 2, suicide ideation a score
of 3, and suicide attempts a score of 4) and scores to the
item in the NSSI-AT reflecting feelings about self-injury
(“The fact that I intentionally hurt myself is a problem
in my life”, with responses ranging on a 0–4 Likert scale
from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”). Others,
such as number of items affirmed for each of the func-
tional roles (purposes) of NSSI and the range of self-
injurious behaviors, were continuous but with a very
small range; only the duration of NSSI (that is the length
of time between the first and last time a person had en-
gaged in NSSI) and scores in the ISEL-12 had consider-
able range as continuous variables. As such, the varying
nature of these variables necessitated several analytical
approaches.

Binary logistic regression was used to determine
whether the presence or absence of self-injury (dependent
variable, scored 1 or 0) was predicted by responses (1–4)
to the suicidality item. To assess whether the presence of
cutting conferred especial risk of suicidality, the presence
of cutting (1 or 0) was the dependent variable of another
logistic regression. In order to partly examine the specifi-
city of this behavior to suicidality, three more logistic re-
gressions focused on the presence (1 or 0) of severe
scratching and/or pinching, hitting the self, and hitting ob-
jects, which we previously found were the most common
forms of self-injury engaged in by autistic people (Moseley
et al., under review). Where significant predictive relation-
ships were seen, we conducted chi-squared tests to exam-
ine the distribution of responses between participants in
these dichotomous categories.

The relationship between responses to the suicide item
and a number of variables were of interest in this study.
In order to examine a hypothesized relationship between
the suicidality item (responses 1–4) and whether NSSI
was perceived by participants to be a problem in their
life (a 0–4 Likert scale, with 0 indicating no problem at
all), we performed non-parametric Spearman’s rho cor-
relation. The same method was used to explore relation-
ships between suicidality and the number of different
types of self-injurious behaviors engaged in, and between
suicidality and the number of responses to the five func-
tional roles, or needs that NSSI fulfills, which are defined
in the NSSI-AT. With wider range, we used parametric

correlation analysis to examine relationships between
suicidality and duration of NSSI, and between suicidality
and scores in the ISEL-12, reflecting perceived social
support.

Results
Descriptive statistics
Participants were categorized as self-harmers (N = 77) and
non-self-harmers (N = 25) as described above; descriptive
statistics for the two groups are displayed in Table 1. Chi-
squared tests (χ2) were used to compare the distribution
of males and females, employed and unemployed partici-
pants, participants with degrees, participants with psychi-
atric diagnoses, and participants
taking medication
between groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared
group averages in age, age at diagnosis, symptoms of de-
pression (BDI scores) and anxiety (BAI scores), and aut-
ism symptomatology as measured by the AQ.

Self-harming and non-self-harming participants did not
differ in age, age at diagnosis, depressive symptoms, aut-
ism symptomatology, percentage employed, or percentage
qualified to degree level. Males and females were equally
distributed between the two groups. The self-harming
group were significantly more anxious than the non-self-
harming group at the time of the study (p = .008), and
were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities. They
tended to be more likely to be taking medication, though
this likelihood was only on the border of significance.

Logistic regression: predicting suicidality via the presence
of self-injury, and specific types of self-injury
Logistic regression revealed that responses to the question
on suicide ideation or attempts were significantly different
between self-harmers and non-self-harmers (χ2 [1] = 9.390,
p = .002). The model, which only included responses to
this question, explained 13% of the variance (Nagelkerke
R2), but predicted 78% of cases correctly. The odds ratio
suggested that for every 1 point increase in scores to the
suicide item, the participant was 2.2 times more likely to
be a self-harmer (CI 1.297, .3.848). Participants from the
two groups responded as can be seen in Fig. 1a: as shown
in the regression, the distribution of answers across self-
harmers and non-self-harmers was significantly different
(x2 [3] = 12.161, p = .002).

In the self-harming group (n = 77), 38 participants re-
ported that they cut themselves. Responses to the suicid-
ality question significantly predicted the presence or
absence of cutting (χ2 [1] = 15.595, p < .001), though the
model only predicted 24% of the variance (Nagelkerke
R2). Further, 67.5% of participants were correctly catego-
rized as cutters or non-cutters based on their responses
to the suicidality question, and the odds ratio suggested
that for every 1 point increase in scores to the suicide
item, participants were 3.3 times more likely to report

cutting (CI 1.713, 6.442). The different distribution of
cutters to each response of the suicide question was con-
firmed by a chi-squared test (x2 [3] = 14.546, p = .002),
which showed that cutters tended to be distributed to-
ward the more severe responses indicating suicide idea-
tion or attempts (Fig. 1b). Of the other most common
forms of self-injury in autism, behaviors of hitting the
self (engaged in by 32 participants), punching objects
(engaged in by 33 participants), or severely scratching or
pinching (engaged in by 56 participants) were not sig-
nificantly predicted by suicide ideation or attempts.

Among individuals who self-harmed, there was no signifi-
cant relationship between the distress participants felt at
self-harming and their responses to the suicidality question
(p = .152). There were, however, significant correlations
where higher scores to the suicidality question (where 1
reflects “never,” 2 reflects “suicide as a passing thought,” 3
reflects suicide ideation and 4 reflects an attempt) were as-
sociated with greater use of NSSI for regulating low-energy
states (rs = .371, p = .001), or for punishing oneself or deter-
rence from suicide (rs = .379, p = .001), or for the purpose
of sensory stimulation (rs = .319, p = .005).

Relationships between suicidality and other risk variables
in self-harmers
Of the other variables which were hypothesized to cor-
relate with higher scores for the suicidality question,
only the range of self-injurious behaviors was associated
with higher scores on the suicidality question (r s = .419,
p < .001). Participants who had engaged in NSSI for a
longer time tended to have higher scores on the suicidal-
ity question (p = .075), and those who had a greater life-
time incidence of NSSI were more likely to score highly
on the suicidality question but not significantly so
(p = .151). There was a negative trend where participants
with greater perceived social support tended to score
lower on the suicidality question, but this was marginally
non-significant (p = .078).

Discussion
Self-injury, with its close associations to suicidality in
the general population [6–15], is much neglected in aut-
ism research, as is its relationship to suicidality. Our data
corroborates and expands on a key finding from one ex-
istent report in autistic people [53]: that suicide ideation
and attempts were significantly associated with self-
injury, and more prevalent in those who self-injure.

Further exploration of this relationship was motivated
by questions raised in our previous study of NSSI in aut-
ism [40]. We were intrigued by the dichotomy between
individuals greatly troubled about their self-injury and
those who seemed to accept it matter-of-factly. With the
ultimate goal of identifying red flags that might distin-
guish self-harmers at greatest risk of suicide ideation

and attempts, we queried whether, as implied in our pre-
vious qualitative and quantitative data, some cases of
self-injury might be relatively benign. Though the
present data is preliminary, it negates any complacency
that onlookers might feel about self-injury. Here, efforts
to uncover the relationship between self-injury and sui-
cidality found no relationship between how positively
participants viewed their self-injury and their likeli-
hood of suicide ideation or attempts. In other words:
how participants felt about their self-injury appeared
to be of
little importance in decreasing the risk of
suicidality posed by NSSI. This is consistent with the
theoretical viewpoint that regardless of feelings about
it or its functional purpose, NSSI increases pain toler-
ance and decreases fear of pain and death, thus creat-
ing the capability for lethal behaviors in those with
pre-existent suicide ideation [16, 17, 20–23]. This
could explain why the duration of NSSI, in our ana-
lysis, was not significantly associated with the risk of
suicidality, though there was a trend in this direction.
Just having partook in self-injury, current or historic,
was predictive of suicide ideation or attempts.

Though the data suggested that an individual’s feelings
about self-injury may not accurately reflect its serious-
ness, it also indicated that the relationship between NSSI
and suicide ideation/attempts may be influenced by (a)
the features of self-injurious behavior, and (b) the func-
tional purposes which drive NSSI. With respect to the
former, our analysis suggested that certain self-injurious
behaviors may be of heightened concern to clinicians. In
particular, suicide ideation and attempts were seen sig-
nificantly more frequently in cutting than non-cutting
participants. This observation has also been made in
non-autistic self-harmers [14], and theorists posit that
the more painful and physically damaging self-injurious
behavior is, the more it decreases inhibitions and in-
creases capability for suicidality [16, 17]. This is consist-
ent with our findings around the three other most
common forms of self-injury in our autistic sample (hit-
ting oneself, hitting objects, and scratching/pinching),
which unlike cutting were unrelated to the likelihood
that participants had engaged in suicide ideation or at-
tempts. In the same vein, a more diverse range of self-
injurious behaviors, which in non-autistic people tends
to imply more extreme behaviors [16, 17], was related to
greater likelihood of suicide ideation and attempts in
our sample.

As concerns the effect of the purposes of NSSI on sui-
cide risk, significant correlations were seen between sui-
cide ideation/attempts and use of NSSI for regulating
low-energy states and for self-punishment or deterrence
from suicide. These relationships mirror the close rela-
tionships seen in the general population between self-
injury, suicide, and depression [6–8, 54–56], which is

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14 

Page 9 of 15

indeed a low-energy state especially characterized by
self-punishment and self-criticism. The use of NSSI for
communication and expression, and for regulation of
high-energy states like agitation, anger, and anxiety, was
not related to suicidality. We did, however, also observe
a relationship between suicidality and NSSI for the pur-
pose of sensory stimulation. Theoretically, one might
link this to habituation and tolerance of pain which is
one pathway through which self-injury might increase
the risk of suicidality [14].

If the functional purposes that drive self-injury do
it
serve as some indication of particular suicide risk,
might be also relevant to look at the particular intraper-
sonal
factors which predict use of NSSI for different
functional purposes—the goal of our previous study [40].
There, alexithymia emerged as a variable of particular
interest in self-injury [40], perhaps unsurprisingly given
its links to self-injury and suicidality in the general
population [70, 71]. Alexithymia was particularly associ-
ated with the use of NSSI by autistic people to regulate
such as agitation, anxiety, and
high-energy states
anger—but notably, the present analysis showed that en-
gagement in NSSI for this purpose was not associated
with increased suicidality. This could suggest that autis-
tic people with comorbid alexithymia might be more
likely to self-harm to regulate high-intensity states, but
this use of self-injury does not incur especial risk of sui-
cidality, besides any acquired capability generally ac-
crued through self-injury [20, 21, 23]. It might be further
extrapolated that alexithymia may be a useful predictor
of self-harm but not suicide in autistic people, perhaps
due its general ubiquity within this population [72]), but
as the present study did not collect data on alexithymia
alongside suicidality, this interpretation is highly specu-
lative at present and requires further scrutiny. Another
intrapersonal feature predictive of self-injury in our pre-
vious study was sensory sensitivity [40], which is consist-
ent with the finding that autistic children use NSSI to
regulate hypo- and/or hyper-arousal [50]. This seems
somewhat discordant with the finding,
in the present
study, of a relationship between the use of NSSI for sen-
sory stimulation and suicide ideation or attempts. A re-
lationship between autistic sensory sensitivity and the
use of NSSI for sensory stimulation would bridge this
apparent contradiction, but this relationship was not sig-
nificant when scrutinized in our previous paper [40]. Al-
though this may relate to limitations of the methodology
and power in the previous study, it may be that as with
alexithymia, autistic sensory differences might be too
ubiquitous to serve as significant predictors of suicidal-
ity. Additionally,
it may be that individuals who use
NSSI for sensory stimulation are driven more by the cor-
relates or comorbidities of sensory differences rather
than the sensory differences per se. Such correlates, in

autism, include sociocommunicative abilities, insistence
on sameness, cognitive problems and inattention, adap-
tive behavior, and as previously mentioned, anxiety and
other forms of affective difficulties [41–45]. Notably, im-
pulsivity is an intrapersonal
factor associated with
sensation-seeking through NSSI [73] and with acquired
capability for suicide [74], and has indeed been linked to
self-injurious behavior [75] and to suicidal acts [25] in
autistic children. These speculations invite multiple fur-
ther lines of enquiry, but we are also reminded of the
complexity of self-injury and suicidality as intercon-
nected but distinct phenomena. It seems likely that some
individuals are more or less vulnerable to suicidality over
and above being self-harmers, but the additional vari-
ables which predict suicide risk may not be entirely
identical to those which predict engagement in self-
injury.

Finally, we also examined one interpersonal feature
that might affect the suicide risk of self-harmers: social
support as measured by the ISEL-12. The data revealed
that, worryingly, those self-harmers with greater social
support were not significantly less likely to engage in
suicide ideation or attempts, despite a trend in this dir-
ection. This may link, again, to the time-invariant risk
posed by NSSI in decreasing inhibitions to suicide. It
may be that the social support at hand is inadequate to
ameliorate the challenges faced by this population, but
one might also query the adequacy of our measurement
tool—whether specific types of social support not cap-
tured by the ISEL-12, such as the sense of community
with other autistic people [76, 77], might have been
moderators of suicide ideation and attempts in our par-
ticipants. This is indeed indicated by other reports where
loneliness and the lack of social and practical support,
possibly via the mediator of depression [78], are import-
ant features in the suicide risk of autistic people [53, 79].
Autistic adults themselves have testified to the life-
changing and life-saving power of appropriate support in
helping them move away from self-injury and suicide
[80]. The alarming lack of confidence that agency
workers, clinicians, and community mental health staff
feels around providing this support [81] further high-
lights the crucial need for development in this area.

Limitations and directions for future study
The current report raises important questions around
NSSI and its
relationship with suicidality, namely
whether how people feel about self-injury reflects the
risk that their self-injury might pose for future suicidal-
ity, and whether certain forms of self-injury should war-
rant more urgent attention. We provide a first attempt
to address these questions, but there is a critical need
for future research in this area, given the limitations of
the current report. These include statistical limitations

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14 

Page 10 of 15

in the operationalization of variables, which often neces-
sitated non-parametric tests. Non-parametric tests have
a valid use in research; they allow for comparison of
ordinal and nominal data, do not assume normal distri-
butions, and are less swayed by outliers. However, they
neglect certain characteristics of the data, such as aver-
ages and standard deviations, they lack power when a
sample size is especially small, and in such cases, they
are less likely to reject a false null hypothesis (type II
error). Our sample was of a reasonable size, our findings
in the main showed very low p values and tended in the
direction one would expect based on previous investiga-
tions. However, especially when it comes to our opera-
tionalization of how individuals felt about their self-
injury, our analysis may have lacked the power and
detail to pick out those among the self-harming group
who might be more or less vulnerable to suicidality. This
extremely complex goal was motivated by observations
from a rich qualitative analysis of individual responses,
whereas the present approach utilized only quantitative
data in a non-parametric approach.

In the present study, we did not examine distinctly
whether self-harming individuals were more prone to
suicide ideation, suicide attempts, or both. It may be im-
portant for future methods and analyses to distinguish
more clearly between suicide ideation and attempts. The
interpersonal model of suicide suggests this is a crucial
distinction [20], particularly in identifying the factors
that facilitate an individual’s transition from suicide idea-
tion to suicide readiness and attempts—and this, in aut-
ism, is absolutely imperative.

One limitation of our report is its focus exclusively
on autistic individuals without intellectual disability.
These are in fact the individuals most at risk of sui-
cidality [26, 30], but nevertheless it means that our
data on the relationship between self-injury and sui-
cidality cannot be generalized to autistic individuals
with intellectual
impairment. The data does suggest
that certain forms of self-injury, such as cutting, are
particularly associated with suicidality, as opposed to
hitting the self, punching objects, or scratching or
intellectual dis-
pinching. If autistic people without
ability are more likely to engage in these kinds of ac-
tivities than people with intellectual disability,
this
may be a factor in explaining their increased risk of
suicidality; however, relationships between self-injury
and suicidality in intellectually disabled autistic people
or those with more severe learning disabilities are yet
to be explored.

The generalizability of the present study is further lim-
ited by biases that may have been introduced by our
sampling method: sending out email invitations, adver-
tising our study in person at local support groups (this
accrued the smallest return), and advertising it on social

media. A number of studies have documented that
women are generally more likely than men to engage
with online surveys [82–84], and our disproportionate
ratio of females to males would seem consistent with
this observation, despite its incongruence with the ele-
vated ratio of males to females diagnosed with autism
[85, 86]. Notably, studies concerning mental health in
non-autistic people have linked the lower up-take by men
to the greater stigma that men experience around discuss-
ing and seeking help for mental ill-health [87–92]. It may
be that autistic men may experience the same difficulties
discussing mental health as their non-autistic same-sex
peer group, which could have deleterious effects on their
wellbeing.

Though our limited male sample prevented us examin-
ing the self-injury/suicidality relationship in men and
women separately, sex is likely to be another variable of
interest, given the modification of autistic presentation
by sex [93], and the differences seen in presentation and
diagnosis of mental health issues in autistic men and
women. Our previous research suggests that autistic
men and women are equally at risk of self-injury, though
others suggested greater prevalence of self-injury in aut-
istic women [35]. At present, it is still uncertain whether
autistic men or women are at greater risk of suicide, and
whether sex differences in suicide rates could further dif-
fer depending on the presence or absence of intellectual
disability. Attempts to address this may be somewhat
confounded by the lower recognition rates of autistic
women without intellectual disability [94]. In the general
population, death by suicide is generally higher in neuro-
typical men than women [95]. Closer examination, how-
ever, shows that neurotypical women are equally or even
more prone than men to suicide ideation and attempts
[95], which appears to be the case in ASC, too [53]. In
autism, there may also be sex differences in the likeli-
hood that male or female self-harmers might proceed to
act on suicide ideation. Possible sex differences in the
ideation-to-action transition might pertain in part to dif-
fering uses and features of NSSI in autistic men and
women, which have not been addressed by previous
studies of NSSI in autistic adults without intellectual dis-
ability [35, 40]. In non-autistic samples, there are some
differences in the features of NSSI (for instance, wall-
punching being a more common and often under-
recognized form of self-injury in men [96], and cutting
being more common in women [97]), and in the func-
tional purpose of self-injury (with men less likely to use
NSSI to influence others or avoid interacting with people
[98], though others contradict this [4]). Sex differences
in autistic NSSI, suicide, and the ideation-action transition
are certainly a worthy line of enquiry. Future research
should also differentiate between sex and gender, given
the prevalence of gender dysphoria in autism [99, 100]

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14 

Page 11 of 15

and the high incidence of NSSI in non-autistic people with
gender dysphoria [101, 102], who commonly experience
high degrees of mental distress [103].

In attempting to identify autistic people at greatest
risk of suicidality, our report focuses on self-injury as
a particular risk factor, but a full and comprehensive
assessment of
the suicide risk faced by any self-
harming autistic individual would need to recognize a
number of other intrapersonal and extrapersonal risk
factors related to suicide ideation and attempts in
autism [24–28, 31, 32, 53, 104]. These include behav-
ioral problems (in children); bullying and victimization at
different life stages; increased likelihood of physical and
sexual abuse; unemployment and financial insecurity; and,
as previously mentioned, social isolation and failure in re-
lationships. Features of autism including poor interper-
sonal skills, impulsivity, concrete and restricted thinking,
reduced ability to make and change plans, and to cope
with environmental changes, have also been associated
with suicide risk—as has the strain of camouflaging these
difficulties. As pertains to experiences like being bullied,
victimized and abused, it is possible that self-injury medi-
ates the effect of these experiences on future suicide risk,
given that they also increase the risk of self-injury [105].
These experiences may also be relevant to the high
rates of psychiatric illness in autism, such that it is
not always possible to attribute the heightened suicide
[26]—depression and post-
risk to autism alone
traumatic stress in autism have themselves been iden-
tified as serious risk factors [24, 28].

It is important to note that the present study did not
control for the psychiatric comorbidities that were seen
to differ between self-harming and non-self-harming
groups. The differences (and indeed lack of differences)
that we observed between our two groups may reflect
sample disparities in our unequal numbers of self-
harming and non-self-harming participants, and so
should be taken with a note of caution until replicated
in larger samples. However, participants with anxiety
and other comorbidities were significantly more likely to
be found in the self-harming group, though the groups
were matched for depressive symptomatology. This may
be indicative that psychiatric conditions in autism may
be especially important for understanding and differenti-
ating between NSSI and NSSI accompanied by suicide
ideation and/or attempts. There are certain conditions
that are elevated in the autistic community, such as eat-
ing disorders [106, 107], which might be especially
significant in the context of assessing risk for self-injury
and suicidality [108, 109]. For researchers, distilling par-
ticular elements shared between autism and other condi-
tions associated with NSSI would be valuable. Poor
interoceptive awareness, for instance, is shared by people
with eating disorders [110], autistic people [111], and

self-harmers and people who report suicide ideation or
attempts [112]. In this study, suicide-attempters were
less likely to ignore or distract themselves from painful
sensations and were less able to regulate distress by pay-
ing attention to bodily sensations [112]. Interoceptive
“disconnect” with the experience of pain would, theoret-
ically, make self-harmers capable of severely hurting the
body much as an object; that they exhibit both higher
tolerance for pain and decreased fear of pain is consist-
ent with the central role that both play in acquired cap-
ability for suicide [113]. Interoception is closely related
to (or indeed an aspect of) alexithymia [114, 115], a fea-
ture of both eating disorders and autism. Interoceptive
awareness of one’s “visceral afferent information” [111]
is also, of course, closely related to differences in the
processing and integration of externally-generated or
exteroceptive sensory experiences [116]. As such, the ex-
teroceptive processing differences (and indeed alexithy-
mia) observed in our self-harming sample [40] might
have been accompanied by interoceptive differences
which could contribute to self-injurious behaviors.

This brings our focus, full circle, back to highlighting
and teasing apart the contribution of these variables
[40], among others, that might link NSSI as a transdiag-
nostic phenomenon, and might have relevance to self-
harmers who attempt suicide. While researchers under-
take this task, some have suggested that autistic children
and teenagers should be routinely screened for suicide
ideation, suicide attempts, and underlying psychopath-
ology [26, 31]. The high prevalence of suicidal ideation
and attempts in those diagnosed in adults suggests that
these individuals, too, might benefit from screening at
the point of diagnosis [24]. Clinicians are in crucial need
of appropriate tools for this purpose, especially given
their anxiety about treating mental ill-health in autistic
people [81]. The development of brief autism-specific
screening tests for suicidality is fortunately underway
[117], and we laud this important effort.

As a final note, the relationship between NSSI and sui-
cidality suggests that one route to reducing suicide risk
might be to target initial engagement in NSSI. One re-
cent model [5] acknowledges the “benefits” (i.e., func-
tional purposes) of NSSI which, the model suggests,
would be accessible to any individual
if they were to
overcome the “barriers” that prevent most individuals
from ever trying NSSI [5]: lack of awareness of or expos-
ure to NSSI, having a positive view of oneself (and thus
reduced likelihood of self-criticism), aversion to physical
pain and to stimuli associated with NSSI (such as blood),
and sensitivity to social norms and negative reactions to
NSSI. According to this approach, common antecedents
to NSSI (such as negative self-image, the desire or need
to communicate something via NSSI and the desire to
affiliate with a group) reduce the aversive power of these

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2020) 11:14 

Page 12 of 15

barriers. Once a person has first tried NSSI, approxi-
mately 50% of individuals continue to engage in it regu-
larly or with high frequency, having evoked an “affective
engine” which simultaneously amplifies its benefits and
reduces the barriers for further self-injury (for instance,
the relief from pain may reduce aversion to the sight of
blood). With consideration of an individual’s first experi-
ences of self-injury, this model invites query regarding
the factors that distinguish those who become regular
users of NSSI from the large proportion who do not.
With relation to autism, one might question whether or
to what extent autistic individuals experience the same
benefits and barriers to NSSI. Differences in the percep-
tion of pain [118–122] may suggest that physical pain is
not aversive in the same way; similarly, one might query
whether autistic individuals also possess a natural aver-
sion to stimuli associated with NSSI, as studies of
physiological response to “emotional stimuli” have found
varied results [123]. In understanding autistic self-injury,
it may be beneficial
to adopt a similar transitional
approach such as has been formulated in “ideation to ac-
tion” [22] models of suicidality—a holistic overview from
the risks and barriers that increase and decrease the like-
lihood of NSSI ever occurring, to the motivation for a
first incident, and, from there, the sparking and main-
tenance of
the engine which could build suicide
capability.

Conclusion
Despite previous reports of individual differences in ex-
periences and perceptions of self-injury in autism, this
study confirmed a clear relationship whereby suicide
ideation and attempts predict the presence of self-injury,
regardless of how participants perceive their self-injury.
There is some indication that particular methods, such
as cutting, and particular functional purposes of NSSI
may pose a specific concern, as does increased diversity
of self-injurious behaviour. Future research is imperative,
however,
in validating these preliminary findings and
identifying variables which, in autism, increase the risk
of NSSI and of NSSI which escalates to suicide attempts.
