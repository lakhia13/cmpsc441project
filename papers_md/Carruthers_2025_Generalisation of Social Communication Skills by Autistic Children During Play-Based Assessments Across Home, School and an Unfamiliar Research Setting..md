Abstract
We investigated autistic children’s generalisation of social communication over time across three settings during a play-based 
assessment with different adults and explore the potential moderating effects on generalisation of age, nonverbal IQ and level 
of restricted and repetitive behaviours. The social communication abilities of 248 autistic children (2–11 years, 21% female, 
22% single parent, 60% white) from three UK sites were assessed from 1984 video interactions in three contexts with three 
different interaction partners (parent/home, teaching assistant/school, researcher/clinic) at baseline, midpoint (+ 7m) and 
endpoint (+ 12m) within the Paediatric Autism Communication Trial-Generalised (PACT-G), a parent-mediated social com-
munication intervention. Children’s midpoint social communication at home generalised to school at midpoint and to clinic at 
endpoint. Generalisation was stronger from home to school and clinic than school to home and clinic. Generalisation was not 
moderated by age, nonverbal IQ or restricted and repetitive behaviour. Broader child development did not explain the pattern 
of results. The current study is the largest study to date to explore generalisation with autistic children and provides novel 
insight into their generalisation of social communication skills. Further research is needed to gain a more comprehensive 
understanding of facilitators of generalisation across settings and interaction partners in order to develop targeted strategies 
for interventions to enhance outcomes for young autistic children.

Generalisation in Early Autism Intervention 
Studies

Mediators and Moderators of Generalised 
Outcomes

Demonstrating the transmission of targeted proximal interven-
tion effects into broader, generalisable functional change in 
everyday contexts is a key current challenge for early autism 
intervention research (Carruthers et al., 2020; Crank et al., 
2021; Fuller & Kaiser, 2020; Sandbank et al., 2021). In the 
past decade multiple studies have demonstrated that interven-
tion effects sizes for naturalistic developmental behavioural 
interventions are smaller for distal vs. proximal and for con-
text-bound vs. more generalisable outcomes (Crank et al., 
2021; Hong et al., 2018; Sandbank et al., 2021, 2023; Yoder 
et al., 2013). The capacity to generalise acquired skills flex-
ibly across different situations, people and contexts—a central 
feature of skill acquisition in neurotypical development—has 
often been suggested to be a core difficulty for autistic chil-
dren. However, the robustness of the evidence for this view and 
our understanding of the underlying processes that lead to lim-
ited generalisation remain uncertain (Carruthers et al., 2020; 
Stokes & Osnes, 2016; Swan et al., 2016). A systematic review 
of randomised controlled trials of early social communication 
interventions for autistic children showed that eight out of nine 
trials reviewed found some successful generalisation of skills 
across people and/or setting (Carruthers et al., 2020).

Factors associated with intervention strategies, such as over-
prompting and artificial learning contexts dissociated from 
real-world social-pragmatic contexts, may create barriers to 
generalisation of child skills. One plausible approach to over-
come some of these difficulties is to embed interventions into 
real-world social environments through parent- and teacher-
mediated learning, which may optimise the interpersonal cues 
and continuity of learning across contexts (Schreibman et al., 
2015). This increases opportunities for incidental or naturalis-
tic teaching by weaving functional social and communication 
learning into the child’s daily experiences where these skills 
are required. Although most psychosocial interventions target 
specific behaviours and skills, the underlying models work on 
the assumption that there will be a generalised developmental 
shift consequent on initial changes in the targeted domains. 
Developmentally-informed interventions build on theories of 
neurotypical development of the social mind (Carpendale & 
Lewis, 2004; Johnson, 2011) in which there are progressive 
cascades of impacts across a broadening range of behavioural 
domains and settings (Green, 2022; Green & Garg, 2018).

Few  parent-mediated  autism  intervention  trials  have 
specifically examined the downstream effect of change 
in parenting behaviours (i.e. the focus of the interven-
tion strategy) on generalised child social communication 
skills. One study demonstrated that change in parenting 
behaviour mediated the effect on the initial intervention 
target (child initiations within parent–child communica-
tion) and that child initiations, in turn, mediated the effect 
in the generalised social communication context with an 
unfamiliar interaction partner during the Autism Diagnos-
tic Observation Schedule (ADOS; Pickles et al., 2015). 
Follow-up of the same cohort six years later demonstrated 
that a sustained increase in this child initiation with their 
parent continued to mediate the treatment effect on ADOS 
scores six years after the intervention period (Carruthers 
et al., 2023). An educator-mediated social communication 
intervention trial also demonstrated a downstream gen-
eralisation cascade in which child-initiated joint engage-
ment was related to joint attention initiations, which in 
turn led to improvements in language outcome (Shih et al., 
2021). Few other intervention trials have explored possi-
ble moderators of generalisation effects of any skill type 
among autistic children. However, in relation to interven-
tion outcomes in general, age and IQ have been proposed 
as moderators of intervention effect, although the evidence 
for  this  is  mixed  (Klinger  et  al., 2021).  More  broadly, 
for autistic individuals, the flexibility required to adapt 
behaviour to different social exchanges may be lower for 
individuals with higher levels of restricted and repetitive 
behaviour (D’Cruz et al., 2013).

A Framework for Testing Generalisation 
Across Time, Context and People

Whilst interventions are one example of a learning envi-
ronment, most children’s learning comes from the family 
and school environments within which they spend most 
time. However, research exploring the relative contribu-
tion and dynamics of these two core learning environ-
ments for autistic children is rare. If we understood better 
how different learning environments interact, we could 
tailor interventions more precisely to support naturally 
occurring  learning  dynamics  across  home  and  school 
contexts. In order to advance our understanding of gen-
eralisation of social communication across different set-
tings and partners we need observational capture of social 
exchanges across contexts that offer similar expectations

and opportunities rated by a consistent coding framework. 
Until recently, the autism field did not have an instrument 
that was sufficiently flexible to be used as an observational 
measure of social communication across different settings 
and people. The Brief Observation of Social Communi-
cation Change (Grzadzinski et al., 2016) is a relatively 
new, play-based assessment, designed to measure changes 
in social communication skills over the course of inter-
ventions. Frost and colleagues (Frost et al., 2019) tested 
whether the BOSCC could be used to assess similarities 
and  differences  in  social  communication  when  a  child 
was interacting with their parent during a play context 
and a snack context. The Social Communication subscale 
exhibited strong psychometric properties and indicated 
that similar information was captured across the different 
contexts. In contrast, the second subscale, the Restricted 
and Repetitive Behaviour (RRB) subscale was less consist-
ent in performance, with weaker psychometric properties 
and a significantly different profile of scores across the two 
settings. Other studies have also reported weaker psycho-
metric properties for the RRB subscale (Carruthers et al., 
2021; Kim et al., 2019).

The Current Study: Testing Generalisation 
in the Context of the PACT‑G Trial

The fact that the BOSCC can be used with different adult 
interaction partners across different settings was central to 
its use as a secondary outcome measure in the Paediatric 
Autism Communication Trial-Generalised (PACT-G; Green 
et al., 2022). Autistic children (aged 2–11) were assessed 
with BOSCC on their social communication skills with a 
parent at home, teaching assistant at school and a researcher 
in a university environment at multiple time points over the 
12-month trial duration. The PACT-G trial did not demon-
strate a greater effect than treatment-as-usual on measures 
of autism symptoms (including the BOSCC), language or 
social adaptation. However, it did result in greater improve-
ment in children’s dyadic social communicative initiations 
during interactions with the parent and teaching assistant. 
Mediation analysis showed that the increase in children’s 
communicative initiations in both home and education set-
tings was a consequence of the adjusted communication 
styles of parents and teaching staff, respectively (Green 
et al., 2022).

Whilst no overall intervention effect was demonstrated on 
the BOSCC, the longitudinal design of the trial offered an 
opportunity to investigate, across the whole trial cohort, a 
novel analysis of the comparison of acquired skills in autism 
development across time, context and person. The current 
study, therefore, is an investigation of overall developmen-
tal processes in the PACT-G cohort, not an investigation of 

treatment effects or their mediation. We aimed to investigate 
children’s generalisation of social communication over time 
during a play-based assessment with three different adults in 
three different settings, and to explore the potential moderat-
ing effects on generalisation of age, nonverbal IQ and level 
of restricted and repetitive behaviours.

Methods

Participants

Two hundred and forty-eight (197 males, 51 female) chil-
dren, aged between 2 and 11 years, participated in PACT-G 
(Green et al., 2022). PACT-G was a three-site, two-group, 
randomised controlled trial of the PACT-G social communi-
cation intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared 
to TAU alone (ISRCTN Registration: 25378536). Children 
included in the trial had clinical diagnoses of autism, con-
firmed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-
2nd Edition (Lord et al., 2012) and Social Communication 
Questionnaire (Rutter et al., 2003) at trial baseline. Children 
were recruited from local clinical and educational services. 
All children had nonverbal age equivalent scores of more 
than 12 months as measured by the Mullen Scales of Early 
Learning and those aged 5 years and older were between 
P3 (beginning to use ‘intentional communication) and P8 
(a language age equivalent of up to 4 years) on an English 
National Curriculum assessment. Parents were required to 
have sufficient English to participate in the PACT-G assess-
ments and intervention and needed to report speaking to 
their child at home in English at least some of the time. 
Neither children nor parents had any known severe hearing 
or visual impairments; parents had no significant psychi-
atric conditions or learning disabilities. Exclusion criteria 
included a sibling already in the trial, participation in the 
pilot phase of the trial, a child having a non-verbal age-
equivalent level of ≤ 12 months, epilepsy not controlled by 
medication, any safeguarding concerns or family situation 
that would affect participation in the trial, or any child with 
an identified genetic disorder that would impact on ability to 
participate or affect validity of the data. For a family to par-
ticipate, the child’s school also had to sign up to the study. 
Child and family characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Ethical Considerations

All procedures involving human participants were in accord-
ance with the ethical standards of the North West-Greater 
Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee (REF: 15/
NW/0912).  Parents  provided  informed,  written  consent 
before participating in PACT-G. In addition, a delegated 
representative from each school signed a Memorandum of

PACT‑G Trial

The PACT-G trial ran in London, Greater Manchester and 
the North-East of England. Randomisation allocation was 
stratified by intervention site, age strata (< 5 years, 5 years 
and older), and gender. Assessments took place at baseline, 
midpoint (+ 7 months) and endpoint (+ 12 months).

PACT-G therapy was an adaptation of the original clinic-
based PACT therapy (Green et al., 2010) into a multicom-
ponent intervention delivered simultaneously in home and 
school. The rationale of PACT is that synchronous, sensi-
tive and responsive communication from the adult increases 
dyadic communication and social interaction skills in the 
child, which then may generalise into functioning in other 
contexts. This logic model is supported by mediation analy-
sis from two clinic-based PACT trials (Aldred et al., 2012; 
Pickles et al., 2015), which demonstrated that improved par-
ent synchrony was associated with increased child dyadic 
initiation, which in turn was associated with better generali-
sation of social communication in a research evaluation con-
text. PACT-G aimed to build on this evidence by implement-
ing features designed to further support the generalisation of 
the child’s learning across contexts. For instance, the therapy 
took place within the naturalistic settings of both home and 
school with the child present, integrated the parental tech-
niques into daily routines and play, and included teaching 
assistants as direct recipients of the therapy in parallel to 
parents. Parents and teaching assistants were supported, 
using video feedback, to interact with the child using evi-
dence-based strategies that facilitate social communication 
development in the child. Further details of the clinic-based 
PACT intervention can be found the supplementary materi-
als of Green et al. (2010). Description of the modifications 
for PACT-G are reported in (Green et al., 2022).

Measures

Brief Observation of Social Communication Change 
(BOSCC)

The BOSCC (Grzadzinski et al., 2016) is an outcome tool 
designed to measure changes in children’s social com-
munication skills that can be used across different people 
and settings. Behaviours are scored from a naturalistic 
adult–child play-based exchange across items with a six-
point scale. In PACT-G, the BOSCC assessed each child’s 
social communication during play with a parent at home, 
a  teaching  assistant  at  school,  and  a  researcher  in  the 
research setting. Home and school BOSCC assessments 
took  place  at  baseline,  midpoint  and  endpoint,  whilst 

 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2203–2216 

2207

research BOSCCs occurred only at baseline and endpoint. 
For PACT-G, Module 1 (75.4% of participants; Version 
July 27, 2017) and Module 2 (24.6% of participants; 2019 
version) were used, consisting of 15 or 20 items, respec-
tively. The core items make up two subscales: social com-
munication and restricted and repetitive behaviour. In the 
current analysis, only the social communication items are 
used, comprising 8 items in Module 1 (maximum score 
40) and 12 items in Module 2 (maximum score 60). Across 
Module 1 and 2, BOSCC coding was conducted on two 
video-recorded play segments, each made up of 4 min of 
free play and 1 min of bubble play. Further details on the 
administration, including the social communication behav-
iours rated for Module 1 and Module 2, can be found in 
Supplementary Materials. As part of the trial design the 
BOSCC Module was kept consistent across timepoints so 
that children did not change from BOSCC Module 1 to 
Module 2 across the study.

For each child, there were eight BOSCC assessments: 
three at school, three at home (each baseline, midpoint and 
endpoint) and two with the researcher (baseline and end-
point), totalling 1,984 assessments. The Module 1 BOSCCs 
were coded by 14 individuals based in the UK and the US, 
whilst all Module 2 BOSCCs were coded by 6 US-based 
individuals  from  the  team  developing  the  measure.  All 
coders were blind to group and timepoint. A random sub-
sample of BOSCCs, stratified by rater, were multiple coded 
for formal reliability analyses (63 Module 1 and 48 Mod-
ule 2 tapes). Intra-class correlations were calculated to be 
0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81, 0.91) for module 
1, 0.86 (CI 0.76, 0.92) for module 2, and overall 0.86 (CI 
0.76, 0.92).

Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)

The baseline visual reception age equivalent of the MSEL 
(Mullen, 1995) was used to explore the moderating effect 
of non-verbal IQ. Given the overall low DQ of the sample 
(see Table 1) a median split was used to transform the scores 
into a binary variable dividing the sample into two near-
equal size groups (age equivalent 13 to 24 months vs. 25 to 
69 months).

Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire (RBQ)

The RBQ (Honey et al., 2012) is a parent-report measure 
of  repetitive  and  restricted  behaviours,  administered  at 
baseline. The two subdomains of Insistence on Sameness 
and Sensory Motor Behaviours were used independently 

to explore the moderating effect of restricted and repetitive 
behaviour levels.

Data Analysis

The analyses presented were preregistered: https:// aspre 
dicted. org/ blind. php?x= dw43ak .  Minor  alterations 
between the preregistration and final analyses are outlined 
in Supplementary Materials. While the current study set 
out to explore generalisation using both subscales of the 
BOSCC, the length and play-based setting was considered 
to elicit too few RRBs to analyse these reliably as a dis-
tinct construct. The analysis reported therefore focuses on 
only the social communication subscale.

Pearson correlations were calculated between context 
and timepoint. Correlations are interpreted using r of ≥0.1 
representing a small effect size (ES), ≥ 0.3 a medium ES 
and ≥ 0.5 a large ES (Cohen, 1988).

Generalisation was examined by fitting models using 
Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 2017) of the form shown in 
Fig. 1. The model was stratified by BOSCC module as 
a  two-group  KNOWNCLASS  model  and  estimated  by 
maximum likelihood. All available measurements were 
included in the analysis under an assumption of a missing 
at random missing data mechanism. Goodness of fit was 
evaluated with RMSEA and CFI, where satisfactory fit is 
indicated by values below 0.08 and above 0.90, respec-
tively (Kline, 2015). The results of Wald tests used to 
confirm constraints are reported in Table S1 (See Supple-
mentary Material). Before the three-context model, models 
were run for two contexts in order to explore results indi-
vidually for the (i) home and research and (ii) school and 
research settings. Unless otherwise specified, parameters 
were unconstrained across module.

Measurement Model

The  three  repeated  measurements  of  home  and  school 
BOSCC  assessments  permitted  measurement  error  to 
be accounted for through the use of latent variables, as 
has been done with previous studies (Carruthers et al., 
2023; Pickles et al., 2015). Loadings of each latent vari-
able onto the respective observed variable were fixed to 
1 and, within setting, residual variances were constrained 
to be equal across timepoints and BOSCC module. As the 
researcher-BOSCC only had two assessment timepoints 
(and therefore insufficient to account for the measurement 
error using a simplex model), these remained as observed 
variables in the model. As the BOSCC ratings were made 
blind  from  entirely  independently  recorded  video,  the 
model did not include correlated errors, either within-
contexts over time or across-contexts.

els, a further model was developed including all three con-
texts. These models included reciprocal home-school paths 
between midpoint factors which were explored as part of the 
analysis. Following previous experience (Goldsmith et al., 
2018) that contemporaneous effects tend to be stronger than 
lagged  ones,  the  home-school/school-home  paths  between 
midpoint and endpoint were left unexplored.

To  explore  generalisation  across  contexts,  key  paths 
were added between contexts, namely (1) home midpoint 
to school midpoint, (2) home midpoint to researcher end-
point, and (3) school midpoint to researcher endpoint. To 
maximize power, these unstandardised generalisation path 
coefficients were constrained equal across Module, though 
standardised coefficients would not be expected equal.

Model Including Broader Development

To explore the potentially confounding role of unmeasured 
development, a second model shown in Fig. 1B was tested 
that included a latent factor representing unmeasured child 
development over the duration of the trial.

Moderating Factors

We had pre-specified baseline age, nonverbal IQ and level of 
restrictive and repetitive behaviours and interests as poten-
tial moderators. We chose nonverbal IQ (Visual Reception 
score on the Mullen) as a moderator in our analysis for both 
pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Pragmatically, we admin-
istered only the nonverbal subscales of the Mullen at base-
line (as per Green et al., 2022) and considered the Visual 
Reception subscale the best measure of nonverbal ‘cogni-
tive potential’ for the current sample of children. Theoreti-
cally, language abilities are most strongly associated with 
BOSCC social communication scores (Grzadzinski et al., 
2016). Correlations among other key behavioural indicators 
(Table S2—See Supplementary Material) suggested no addi-
tional candidates. We tested whether each of the three factors

moderated the three generalisation paths using the XWITH 
command and each moderating variable standardised across 
groups (Klein & Moosbrugger, 2000; Maslowsky et al., 
2015). The main and interaction effects of the moderating 
variable were constrained equal across Modules. The models 
were estimated via maximum likelihood, with standard error 
approximation using the first-order derivative (MLF).

Results

Missing BOSCC data points across all available time points 
were 5.2% for the researcher setting, 8.7% for the home set-
ting and 8.1% for the school setting. Mean scores, change 
scores and standard deviations are reported in Table 2. Cor-
relations between each timepoint and context are reported in 
Table 3. All correlations were large, ranging between 0.44 
and  0.65.  Our  modelling  examines  how  these  measures 
might be influencing each other over time across the whole 
cohort, and thus though we adjust for possible intervention 
effects, we are not concerned here with actual treatment 
effects, mediated or otherwise.

Cross Lagged Analysis: Social Communication 
Subscale

Initial Two‑Context Models

First, we ran the model using only BOSCC social communi-
cation data from parent and researcher assessments. Model 
fit was good with RMSEA = 0.059 and CFI = 0.964. The 
path from home midpoint to researcher endpoint BOSCC 
score, constrained equal across Module, was significant 
(p < 0.001) with a standardised coefficient of 0.72 (95% CI 
0.55, 0.88) for Module 1 and 0.68 (0.51, 0.85) for Module 2.

Second,  we  ran  a  similar  two-context  model  for  the 
teaching  assistant  (TA)  and  researcher  assessments, 
where the model fit was also good with RMSEA = 0.031 
and CFI = 0.985. The path from TA midpoint to endpoint 
researcher was significant (p < 0.001) with standardised 
coefficients of 0.41 (0.26, 0.56) for Module 1 and 0.42 
(0.26, 0.58) for Module 2. Eighty-five (34.3%) children 
experienced a change in TA between baseline and mid-
point, and 94 (37.9%) children between midpoint and end-
point. Twenty-two children (8.9%) experienced changes at 
both timepoints. Therefore, 157 (63.3%) children experi-
enced at least one TA change. However, changing TA did 

not significantly alter the expected level of BOSCC-coded 
autistic behaviour.

Three Context Model

For the model spanning all three contexts, the model fit 
was good with RMSEA = 0.023 and CFI = 0.992. Direct 
paths from home midpoint to researcher endpoint, home 
midpoint  to  school  midpoint,  and  school  midpoint  to 
researcher endpoint are given in Table 4. In addition to 
the direct path between home midpoint and researcher 
endpoint, there is an indirect path between the two via

school midpoint. The total path from home midpoint to 
researcher endpoint is also provided in Table 4, which 
incorporates the direct and indirect path.

We  conducted  sensitivity  tests  on  the  direction  of 
the midpoint paths. First, we reversed the path between 
midpoint home and midpoint school which resulted in 
a marked worsening of the goodness-of-fit (χ2 = 11.20). 
Secondly,  we  estimated  the  two  paths  simultaneously 
(with  the  removal  of  the  covariance  between  the  end-
points),  which  gave  standardised  estimates  of  1.00 
(p = 0.006) from parent to TA, and − 0.05 (p = 0.919) for 
TA to parent. Therefore, we fixed the path from school 
midpoint to home midpoint at zero.

Model Incorporating Broader Development

General development during the course of the trial could 
have been a source of unobserved confounding that would 
have  biased  our  estimates  of  generalisation  paths.  To 
assess this risk, we fitted the model of Fig. 1B which 
included a development factor with factor loadings all 
equal at 7 months (fixed at 1 for identification) and all 
equal at 12 months. The model likelihood improved as 
the variance of the development factor was reduced to 
zero, implying no evidence for such a factor operating for 
the BOSCC outcome and leaving our generalisation path 
estimates unchanged (Table 4).

Moderating Factors

As general development was not found to be a significant 
factor in the model, moderation of generalisation was tested 
using the initial model. Reported in Table 5, moderation 
effect estimates for age, non-verbal IQ, insistence on same-
ness and sensory motor behaviours were all small and none 
even nominally significant. In each case, the models contin-
ued to fit satisfactorily. This was the case for all three paths 
of generalisation: (i) home midpoint to school midpoint, 
(ii) home midpoint to researcher endpoint, and (iii) school 
midpoint to researcher endpoint. The log likelihood ratio 
tests show there was no significant improvement in model 
fit when interaction terms were included.

Discussion

Our results build on existing evidence that autistic children 
do, in fact, generalise social communication skills during 
naturalistic  development  (Carruthers  et  al., 2020;  Hong 
et  al.,  2018).  Whilst  intervention  studies  have  provided 
evidence of generalisation by demonstrating gains in target 
skills within the original intervention environment, as well 
as a novel (generalisation) setting, the path from gains in one 
setting to the other is most often assumed rather than tested 
(see Carruthers et al., 2023; Pickles et al., 2015; Shih et al., 
2021, for exceptions). The current study explicitly tests this 

2212

implied path across three contexts (i.e., from the familiar 
settings of home and school to an unfamiliar setting), whilst 
controlling for the previous skill level in each context. Initial 
models that considered only two contexts at a time showed 
that children’s social communication gains with a parent 
between baseline and midpoint generalised to improved 
social communication with a researcher at endpoint. Simi-
larly, children’s social communication gains with a teaching 
assistant between baseline and midpoint also generalised to 
improved social communication with a researcher at end-
point. In the final three-context model, the children’s gener-
alisation of social communication from parent to researcher 
remained, both directly and overall, including the indirect 
effect via the assessment with teaching assistant at midpoint. 
In contrast, the generalisation effect from teaching assistant 
to researcher was no longer significant, and with negative 
point estimates. Generalisation was also shown to be sig-
nificant from home midpoint to school midpoint, but not the 
reverse. The key generalisation paths from home and school 
midpoint to research endpoint did not show moderation by 
age, non-verbal IQ,1 or restricted and repetitive behaviours. 
In other words, these factors did not determine the extent of 
generalisation of social communication skills across home, 
school and unfamiliar contexts for the children in this sam-
ple. Our results also suggest that overall development of 
child behaviour across all contexts was not responsible for 
the pattern of results we report. We thus infer here a gen-
eralisation of a specific domain of ability (i.e., social com-
munication skills) across context and time.

These  results  add  new  insight  to  the  field’s  growing 
understanding  of  generalisation  as  it  applies  to  autistic 
children. Lack of a normative control group means that 
we cannot say with certainty that autistic children do not 
have difficulties with skill generalisation compared to their 
neurotypical peers. However, these results establish that 
autistic children can generalise, and should lead to recon-
sideration of widely reported beliefs to the contrary (Car-
ruthers et al., 2020). Using the temporal sequences afforded 
by the longitudinal design, the current study also provides 
a novel insight into the dynamics of influence during an 
autistic child’s development of social communication. Gen-
eralisation of skills into the researcher BOSCC assessment 
was stronger from the parent BOSCC at home than from 
the teaching assistant BOSCC at school. When we tested 
the bidirectional relationship between social communication 
change that had occurred at home and school by midpoint, 
the stronger direction was from home to school. Behaviour 
learning accounts of generalisation hold that learning will 
be more readily transferred to new contexts if there is greater

some caution is warranted with regard to IQ.

similarity in contingencies between the original learning 
context and the new one (see Swan et al., 2016 for review). 
More contemporary accounts are based, instead, on theories 
about the internalisation of procedural knowledge arising 
from early dyadic interaction, which can then be applied 
flexibly into different contexts (Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; 
Tomasello, 2008). Our finding that the parent-home con-
text shows greater salience for generalisation into school 
and research settings supports the latter model. Home is the 
first occurring and enduring context in which children spend 
more time than other settings and involves a relationship 
intimacy that increases the likelihood of internalisation. 
There is no a priori reason why the contextual contingences 
of the home would be more similar to the research setting 
than those of the school, indeed school and research settings 
might be more similar.

Another factor that potentially affected generalisation 
from school to research settings in PACT-G may be that 
63% of the children in the cohort experienced at least one 
change in teaching assistant at school during the study. This 
rate was higher than originally expected and resulted from 
staff turnover, staff reassignment, children changing schools, 
and the therapy spanning a change in school year. Whilst 
social communication skills do not start from scratch with 
each new interaction partner, for the children in the current 
sample who were in the midst of developing early stages of 
social communication, consistency (which offers routine and 
predictability) is likely be important (Lindsay et al., 2014).
The  current  study  is  the  first  to  report  the  interplay 
between home and school learning environments for autis-
tic children, though others have emphasised the importance 
of alignment across settings (Azad et al., 2021). For autistic 
children with limited verbal communication, our study sug-
gests that while both parents and educators play a significant 
role in supporting learning and generalisation of skills, gains 
within the home environment more strongly generalise to 
novel environments than those from school. There are many 
other aspects of the educational environment, including peer 
relationships, group play and interaction, and the challenge 
of novelty and difference, that are undoubtedly essential for 
child social development beyond the immediate family. Fur-
ther research into the dynamics between home and school 
learning, and their combined influence on autistic children’s 
social communication development, could lead to better tar-
geted interventions.

Evidence that autistic children can and do generalise 
social communication skills may dictate a shift of focus, 
to ask what are the necessary support(s) for interventions 
to facilitate maximum learning and generalisation (Chang 
et al., 2016; Green et al., 2010). Research involving non-
autistic control groups will allow further insight into the 
ways in which autistic generalisation may differ from ‘neu-
rotypical’ learning patterns. For example, understanding the 

 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2203–2216 

2213

ways in which cognitive conceptual processes (e.g., those 
that underlie perceptual discrimination skills) and social-
context processes (e.g., incorporating a child’s interests to 
facilitate peer engagement and inclusion) both interact and 
independently influence learning for autistic children may 
provide better insight into intervention strategies that pro-
mote skill generalisation.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths  of  the  study  include  rigorous  data  collection, 
monitoring of reliability, low attrition and sample size—our 
analysis of 2000 separate video assessments on 248 children 
is substantially larger than any other study of cross-context 
generalisation of any skill type among autistic individuals to 
date. The ratings of social communication were made blind 
from independently recorded video, with high reliability, 
thus removing potential sources of confounding.

In addition to these strengths, a number of limitations are 
noteworthy. The primary analysis measured generalisation 
at the level of social communication subscale score, which 
is comprised of eight behaviours in Module 1 and twelve in 
Module 2. The resulting lack of granularity of the measure 
limits our understanding of the detail of generalisation. A 
more bounded test would have been to test generalisation of 
single behaviours over the three contexts. A similar distinc-
tion may be usefully drawn between downstream develop-
ment and generalisation of skills (Sandbank et al., 2021). 
The current measurement makes it impossible to differenti-
ate between what may have been single behaviour generali-
sation and a more general ‘domain’ generalisation of related 
skills. For instance, some children may be learning particu-
lar social communication skills (e.g., eye contact, gesture) 
at home and then expanding these skills into more advanced 
social communication skills at school (e.g., integrated social 
overtures); this could be more accurately described as down-
stream developmental effects than generalisation of specific 
behaviours. These factors need to be carefully considered as 
further tests of generalisation are designed.

The children in the PACT-G trial had high levels of 
autism symptoms, and largely limited language ability 
and low non-verbal IQ (see Table 1). These factors may 
limit the extent to which our findings can be generalised 
to the whole spectrum of autism. We administered only 
the nonverbal subscales of the Mullen, so were not able to 
control for global IQ, but the correlations between nonver-
bal IQ scores and language measures indicated they were 
strongly associated (Table S2). Furthermore, awareness 
of the research trial participation may have led children’s 
parents and teaching assistants to think more about how 
to develop their child’s communication, which may have 
influenced the learning environments of the study children 
in ways that may differ from children not participating in a 

research trial. Finally, given the null results of the PACT-
G trial on the BOSCC, the current analyses were not able 
to benefit from the more robust causal inference possible 
from a successful experimental perturbation.

The BOSSC is a naturalistic, play-based measure of 
children’s social communication skills that can be used 
across time, communication partner and setting. It has 
strong psychometric properties and good predictive valid-
ity in relation to developmental outcomes in early inter-
vention studies (Carruthers et al., 2021; Grzadzinski et al., 
2016, 2023). Symptom-based social communication meas-
ures, such as the BOSCC, have been criticised for embody-
ing a ‘deficit-based’ formulation of autism and prioritis-
ing neurotypical vs. autistic preferences for socialising 
(Timimi et al., 2019). For young children with significant 
developmental delay and limited communication skills, 
and in the context of a parent-and teacher-mediated social 
communication intervention trial, the BOSCC provided 
us with a suitable measure to test generalisation of social 
communication skills, despite these limitations. A recent 
model attempts to align traditional and neurodivergent 
positions within a transactional approach. This proposes 
that is autism an emergent entity formed through devel-
opmental processes over time between the neurodivergent 
brain, mind and body interacting with the social and physi-
cal environment (Green, 2022). Collaboration is needed 
between autistic people, their caregivers and researchers to 
develop approaches to early intervention and support that 
address the heterogeneous experiences and preferences of 
people on the spectrum and their families, including in 
the development of suitable outcome measures (Bal et al., 
2018; Manzini et al., 2021).

Conclusions

The current study builds on previous literature to add further 
evidence that autistic children can and do generalise social 
communication skills across contexts in the course of devel-
opment. Using robust methods, we add novel insight into 
the relative contributions of different learning environments, 
showing that generalisation of social communication behav-
iours was stronger from the home setting than the school 
into an unfamiliar research environment when measured 
by an observation of naturalistic free play. Generalisation 
of social communication was also stronger from home to 
school than the reverse. We did not find any moderation of 
these generalisation effects by age, non-verbal IQ or level 
of restricted and repetitive behaviours. Future research is 
needed  to  gain  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of 
facilitators of generalisation in order to develop targeted 
strategies for interventions.
