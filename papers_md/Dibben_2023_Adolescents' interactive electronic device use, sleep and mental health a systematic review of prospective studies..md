Optimal sleep, both in terms of duration and quality, is important for adolescent

health. However, young people's sleeping habits have worsened over recent

years. Access to and use of interactive electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tab-

lets, portable gaming devices) and social media have become deep-rooted ele-
ments of adolescents’ lives and are associated with poor sleep. Additionally,

there is evidence of increases in poor mental health and well-being disorders in

adolescents; further linked to poor sleep. This review aimed to summarise the

longitudinal and experimental evidence of the impact of device use on adoles-
cents’ sleep and subsequent mental health. Nine electronic bibliographical data-

bases were searched for this narrative systematic review in October 2022. Of

5779 identified unique records, 28 studies were selected for inclusion. A total of

26 studies examined the direct link between device use and sleep outcomes, and

four reported the indirect link between device use and mental health, with sleep

as a mediator. The methodological quality of the studies was generally poor.

Results demonstrated that adverse implications of device use (i.e., overuse, prob-

lematic use, telepressure, and cyber-victimisation)

impacted sleep quality and

duration; however, relationships with other types of device use were unclear. A

small but consistent body of evidence showed sleep mediates the relationship

between device use and mental health and well-being in adolescents. Increasing

our understanding of the complexities of device use, sleep, and mental health in

adolescents are important contributions to the development of future interven-

tions and guidelines to prevent or increase resilience to cyber-bullying and ensure

adequate sleep.

Sleep problems in adolescents

Some evidence points to a bi-directional relationship between

sleep and mental health (Cortese et al., 2013), whereby mental health

disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are also predictors of inade-

quate sleep amongst young people (Shochat et al., 2014). However,

Adequate sleep quantity and quality is imperative to the health and

are common in adolescence (Inchley et al., 2020), and the biological

and physiological changes occurring at this age can have an impact on

sleep (Galván, 2020). The recommended sleep duration for adoles-
cents, aged 13–18 years, is 8–10 h/day (Paruthi et al., 2016). How-

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Criteria

Population

Inclusion

Exclusion

Young people with a mean age of 10–19 years.
Studies including children aged <10 years or adults aged

>19 years alongside young people were only included when
results were reported for young people separately.

Clinical populations, i.e., samples based on having a

specific condition/disorder/disease, e.g., insomnia,
diabetes.

Exposures

Engagement with mobile (i.e., portable) interactive electronic

devices (IED; e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops) and software
accessible through mobile IEDs (e.g., social media, games,
websites, messaging applications), including studies that
assessed the effectiveness of mobile applications (apps) or
websites designed to improve sleep or mental health outcomes.

Interventions with parents as agents of change with reports of

adolescents’ mobile IED use were also included.

Studies which referred to screen time in general without
specifying the device and/or specific use (e.g., an app).
This was to ensure that we captured evidence on
contemporary screen technology rather than older
screen technology such as televisions.

Outcomes

1. Sleep – objectively assessed or subjectively reported indicators

Studies where mental health outcomes were reported

of sleep health and diagnosed sleep disordersa.

2. Mental health and well-being – indicators of absence or

presence of emotional, psychological, and social well-being
assessed using validated psychometric questionnaires, and/or
diagnosed mental disorder.

Controlled interventions designs with or without randomisationb.
Single-group pre–post interventions, longitudinal studies, and
repeated cross-sectional studies.

Systematic reviews including the aforementioned study designs

were included and reviewed for eligible primary studies.

without reference to sleep outcomes.

Cross-sectional studies and systematic reviews of cross-

sectional studies.

Study setting

Only high-income countries defined by the World Bank (https://

data.worldbank.org/income-level/high-income) (Supplementary
Table S2 in Appendix S1)

Low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) were excluded
due to the assumption that access to mobile IEDs is
more limited in LMICs

Publication type

Peer-reviewed journal articles of result reports.

Study protocols, conference abstracts, theses,

dissertations, book chapters and any other form of
non-peer reviewed publications.

aDue to the unclear reporting around the term ‘sleep quality’, this review used the term sleep quality in its broadest sense, whilst highlighting where
possible differences in reported studies (e.g., sleep duration versus uninterrupted sleep).
bEligible intervention studies are included under the assumption that intervening in IED use to influence sleep outcomes indicates an association.

Literature search results

searches yielded 5779 unique records, of which a total of 28 studies

met inclusion criteria. A total of 26 of these studies reported sleep

outcomes and four examined the role of sleep as a mediator between

IED use and mental health and well-being outcomes (two studies
reported findings relevant to both). References (numbered 1–28) for

11 of 18

high risk of selection bias in eight (31%) studies, with convenience

samples, poorly described recruitment strategies, small sample sizes,

and limited generalisability across adolescents (references 1, 2, 6, 7,

11, 14, 23, 26). Eight (31%) studies had a high risk of performance

bias, where studies either provided limited information regarding

exposure measurement or used invalidated and/or adapted assess-

ment tools, or blinding was poorly reported within interventional stud-
ies (references 8–10, 12, 15, 18, 23, 26). There was a high risk of

detection bias for 14 (54%) studies, providing little to no information

regarding measurement methods and psychometric properties of

assessment tools for the self-reported measurement of sleep out-
comes (references 1, 7–15, 19, 20, 24, 26). Six (23%) studies had a

high level of attrition and provided limited information on how this

was handled in analyses (references 10, 13, 16, 19, 23, 26). Finally,

selective reporting bias was judged to be unclear in 11 (42%) studies
with no published protocols (references 8, 10–12, 15–17, 23, 24, 26)

and high in only one (4%) study (reference 7).

Figure 3 summarises the risk-of-bias assessments across studies

exploring RQ2. Three of the four (75%) studies had at least one high

risk-of-bias domain (Supplementary Table S6 in Appendix S1). There

was a high risk of selection bias in one study (25%) due to use of a

convenience sample with limited generalisability (reference 28). A high

risk of performance bias was detected in two (50%) studies (refer-

ences 8, 27), with two (50%) studies judged as unclear due to lack of

exposure measurement information or psychometric properties (refer-

ences 12, 28). Detection bias was low in three (75%) studies that used

validated questionnaires or scales to measure mental health and well-

being outcomes (references 8, 12, 27), and unclear in one (25%) study

where a previously validated questionnaire was adapted by the

authors (reference 28). There was a high risk of attrition bias in one

(25%) study (reference 27), with high levels of drop out or exclusion

from analysis. Selective reporting was generally adequate across stud-

ies with two (50%) low risk of bias (references 27, 28) and two (50%)

unclear risk of bias studies (references 8, 12).

summary of relevant study findings across the 26 included studies

presented in supplementary Table S3 in Appendix S1.

Interactive electronic device use

The relationship between sleep outcomes and general IED use was
assessed in six studies (n = 2006 participants) with inconsistent find-
ings (references 1–6). Out of 63 individually reported outcomes

across trials, only nine (14%) showed a significantly negative relation-

ship, whereas the majority (53/63, 84%) demonstrated no association

between IED use and sleep outcomes. In one study (reference 2) gen-

der was identified as a moderator of the relationship between media
