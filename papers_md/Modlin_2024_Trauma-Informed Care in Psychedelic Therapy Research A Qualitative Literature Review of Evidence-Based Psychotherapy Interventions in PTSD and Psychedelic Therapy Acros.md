Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with significant patient burden. While pharmacotherapies and evidence- 
based  psychotherapy  interventions  (EBPI)  are  effective,  studies  consistently  highlight  inadequate  outcomes  and  high  treatment  dropout. 
Psychedelic therapy (PT) has shown preliminary promise across difficult-to-treat conditions, including MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, 
however trials of classical psychedelics in PTSD are lacking. Understanding patients’ experiences of EBPI could help promote safety in PT.
Aim: To  systematically  review  qualitative  research  on  patients’ subjective  experience  of  EBPI  for  PTSD,  and  of  PT,  and  examine 
areas of overlap and divergence between them.
Methods: Systematic literature searches for studies published between 2010 and 2023 were conducted on OVID, PubMed, Web of 
Science,  and  PsycInfo.  Included  were  original  studies  in  English  that  presented  qualitative  data  of  patient  experiences  of  EBPI  in 
PTSD,  or  PT  for  any  indication.  Extracted  data  from  included  studies  were  analysed  using  thematic  synthesis.  Syntheses  were 
completed separately for EBPI and PT, before similarities and differences between the therapies were identified.
Results: 40 research articles were included for review: 26 studies on EBPI for PTSD, and 14 studies on PT. EBPI studied were CBT, EMDR, 
CPT and PE. Psychedelic compounds studied were psilocybin, ibogaine, LSD, MDMA and ketamine, for treatment of substance use disorders, 
anxiety  relating  to  physical  illness,  depression,  and  PTSD.  Core  themes  from  patient  experiences  of  EBPI:  1)  patient  burden  in  PTSD 
treatment; 2) readiness; 3) key mechanisms of change; 4) psychological safety and trust. Themes identified in the review of PT: 1) indirect 
trauma processing; 2) reorganisation of self-narratives via processes of relatedness and identification; 3) key treatment characteristics.
Conclusion: This study suggests overlap between patients’ experience of EBPI and PT in terms of key mechanisms of change, the 
importance of psychological safety and readiness to engage in treatment. Trauma-informed care paradigms and practices may improve 
safety and acceptability of PT research.

Introduction
Trauma exposure is associated with an increased risk for psychopathology1–3 including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
major depressive disorder (MDD) and dissociative disorders. PTSD, characterised by debilitating comorbid symptomatology and 
psychosocial dysfunction, is associated with significant individual and societal burden.4,5 Pharmacotherapies (eg, paroxetine and 
sertraline)  and  evidence-based  psychotherapy  interventions  (EBPI)  for  PTSD,  such  as  prolonged  exposure  (PE)  or  trauma- 
focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), are considered effective.6–8 Despite EBPIs effectiveness, studies consistently 
highlight difficulties, including inadequate treatment outcomes9,10 and poor patient retention.11 Psychological treatment of PTSD

may be challenging and complex,12 potentially due to the significant symptomatic and psychosocial burden patients endure (eg, 
perceived  negative  experiences  related  to  the  treatment  across  different  domains,  including  emotional,  relational,  physical, 
systemic, and practical aspects).13 Further, patients who find treatment ineffective and seek additional care are also at increased 
risk of re-traumatisation due to the need to repeatedly recount their traumatic experiences to providers.14

In  response  to  the  unmet  clinical  need  in  PTSD15,  and  difficult-to-treat  mental-health  conditions16,  studies  investigating 
psychedelic forms of therapy have shown promise in so-called “treatment-resistant” patients.17–21  Psychedelic therapy (PT) is an 
umbrella term for interventions administering serotonergic hallucinogens such as 4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (psi-
locybin) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or entactogens such as 3,4-Methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) alongside 
manualised psychological interventions.22–25  Despite PT’s favourable safety profile in research settings and advances in under-
standing of its neurobiological, psychological, and behavioural effects,26–29 significant gaps of knowledge remain. Clinically, it is not 
well understood how PT supports positive outcomes across conditions and compounds.30 Positive results are often associated with 
patient  reports  of  increased  insightfulness,31  emotional  breakthrough32  and  mystical-type  experiences,33  however,  experimental 
studies are needed to establish causality. Importantly, qualitative research has highlighted the significance of the intervention’s non- 
pharmacological factors,34,35 including interpersonal rapport and music listening to positive outcomes.36,37

In PTSD, MDMA-assisted therapy appears highly efficacious in clinical trials, reducing symptoms and improving quality- 
of-life in patients with chronic PTSD.20,38  However, completed trials of classical psychedelics in PTSD are lacking, with 
several early phase studies recruiting as of October 2023. Correspondingly, there is an absence of trauma-focused clinical 
practice guidelines in PT. Despite considerable advances in treatments for PTSD in recent years,9  there remain significant 
challenges associated with standard PTSD treatment, including disruptions to the patient’s linguistic capacities and biological 
stress dysregulation.39  Therefore, considering patients’ experience of EBPI may help personalise care and promote safety 
outcomes for traumatised participants in PT trials. Further, as the number of psychedelic trials grow40  and with Australia 
approving the therapeutic use of MDMA and psilocybin in mental-health,41,42 it is vital that regulators, healthcare systems and 
clinicians have access to a repository of in-depth knowledge of patient experiences to inform operational, clinical, and training 
protocols that support patient safety. As most PT trial participants must be unsuccessfully treated by first-line interventions, 
understanding the positive and negative experiences of EBPI patients could help optimise PT protocols.

Qualitative research is well-placed to provide an in-depth understanding of patients’ subjective experience of trauma 
and treatment.43–45 Therefore, this research aims to review qualitative studies in EBPI for PTSD and PT, examining areas 
of  intersectionality  and  divergence  to  promote  a  multidisciplinary  dialogue.  A  synthesis  of  the  themes  in  the  selected 
studies will be conducted to provide a broad understanding of patients’ experience of the treatments. Based on the data, 
areas of clinical interest will be discussed to promote patient outcomes and safety in PT.

Methods
Search Strategy
A systematic literature search was conducted to identify papers studying patients’ qualitative experiences of either EBPI in PTSD, 
or PT. Given the paucity of existing qualitative literature on PT for PTSD, an expanded second search was conducted to include 
studies on PT for any clinical indication, including but not limited to depression, substance use disorders, and anxiety associated 
with  life-threatening  illness.  The  search  was  conducted  between  January  and  March  2023.  Search  terms  related  to  PTSD, 
psychotherapy, psychedelics, qualitative methods, and patient experience were defined (Table S1) and entered in major research 
databases (OVID,  PubMed,  Web  of  Science,  and  PsycInfo).  Reference  lists  of  included  studies  on  PT and  specific  relevant 
journals specialising in psychedelic science and traumatology were manually searched to ensure suitable articles were not missed. 
Transparent Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed.46 The systematic review 
was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).

Eligibility Criteria
Papers deemed eligible for inclusion were original, peer-reviewed studies presenting qualitative data with an identifiable 
qualitative  research  methodology  (eg,  grounded  theory,  interpretative  phenomenological  analysis,  etc.),  focused  on 
patient  experiences  of  either  EBPI  in  PTSD,  or  PT  for  any  indication.  Papers  must  have  been  published  between

January 2010 and March 2023. This date range was chosen as modern psychedelic research began to emerge after 2010, 
and such a date range would allow comparison with contemporaneous EBPI literature.

Papers were excluded if they did not present new research (eg, systematic reviews), were not peer-reviewed, not published in 
English, studied others’ experiences (eg, clinicians, family members) or indications other than PTSD (unless studying psyche-
delics, where any clinical indication was included as previously outlined). Studies were also excluded if they were not specifically 
studying the experience of EBPI, or if they were studying internet- or phone-based therapy only. Mixed-methods studies were 
included  if  qualitative  data  of  patient  experiences  was  clearly  presented.  PRISMA  diagrams  for  both  literature  searches  are 
presented in Figures 1 and 2.

Data Extraction
Data  from  the  included  studies  were  extracted  and  included:  author/year;  study  design;  qualitative  methodology; 
psychological  intervention;  setting;  sample  size;  demographics;  key  themes  identified;  and  data  relating  to  patients’ 
reported experiences. Authors NLM and MC systematically reviewed papers and extracted the data, cross-checking data 
for concordance.

Data Analysis
Extracted data from the studies was analysed using thematic synthesis.79  Author NLM read and re-read the data before 
assigning open-coded descriptive themes to the results. Once all themes were assigned, these were then distilled into core 
themes, with sub-themes to supplement and expand on the core themes. These themes were then reviewed by VW and 
MC and agreed upon by all authors.

A  thematic  synthesis  was  completed  separately  for  the  studies  of  EBPI  and  studies  of  PT.  After  completing  these 
thematic  syntheses,  similarities  and  differences  between  the  therapies  were  identified.  Our  findings  from  the  EBPI 
synthesis  are  presented  first,  followed  by  the  key  themes  found  across  PT studies.  Excerpts  from  included  studies  are 
presented to illustrate key findings with additional excerpts in Table S2.

Results
EBPI in PTSD
The  initial  search returned  1286  papers. After  screening  and  assessing  papers for  eligibility,  the final  number  included 
was 26 (see Figure 1 for screening details).

Of the included studies, the majority were conducted in the USA (n=12) and the UK (n=6), with one study each in 
Denmark, the Netherlands, South Africa, Norway, and Sweden. Psychotherapies studied were TF-CBT (n=6), PE (n=5), 
eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR, n=3), cognitive processing therapy (CPT, n=2), with a number 
of studies (n=9) on various or combined therapies. Study designs varied between standalone qualitative studies (n=11), 
qualitative  analyses  within  clinical  trials  (n=7),  treatment  acceptability  studies  (n=4),  and  mixed  methods  (n=3).  See 
Table 1 for further details.

Psychedelic Therapy
128 papers were initially found on PT. After screening and eligibility assessment, 14 papers were included in the review 
(see Figure 2 for screening details).

Studies  were  primarily conducted  in  the USA  (n=8),  with  others  in  the UK  (n=2),  Brazil  (n=2),  Mexico  (n=1) and 
Switzerland  (n=1).  Psilocybin  (n=8)  was  the  substance  most  studied,  with  other  studies  investigating  ibogaine  (n=3), 
LSD, MDMA and ketamine (all n=1). Indications for treatment included substance use disorders (n=7), anxiety relating 
to physical illness (n=5), depression and PTSD (both n=1). See Table 2 for further details.

EBPI in PTSD
Patient Burden in PTSD Treatment
All  EBPI  studies  (n=26)  highlighted  patient-reported  burdens  associated  with  PTSD  treatment.  For  some  patients, 
tolerating  these  challenges  appeared  to  increase  feelings  of  agency.  However,  in  many  cases,  this  experience  caused 
distress and destabilisation, at times, impacting patient retention.

This synthesis found 4 prominent sub-themes associated with patient-reported burden:

1. Real-World Barriers
2. Tolerating Treatment Emergent Adverse Events
3. Misaligned Treatment Rationale and Expectancy
4. Interpersonal difficulties with staff and peers

Real-World Barriers 
Related  to  engaging  in  treatment,  patients  across  studies  reported  practical  concerns  regarding  scheduling  and  travel 
difficulties and competing practical, financial and/or relational demands.88,91 This was compounded by the psychological 
burden  associated  with  the  treatment  (eg,  symptom  exacerbation)  and  pre-existing  psychosocial  stressors.  Patients 
expressed  concerns  about  the  potential  adverse  impact  of  the  treatment  on  their  psychosocial  functioning  during  and 
after treatment.52,80,81,92  Patients discussed feeling conflicted about complying with the treatment as this often competed 
with their on-going “real-world” responsibilities.

I felt very overwhelmed, and I felt very lost and very frantic in what I had to do [for therapy]. Especially having the homework 
to do, but then knowing I could not do it. Because I knew my reaction was going to upset my daughters. So, then trying to find 
time later at night, but then writing about all of that would disturb my sleep - what little I get. And the disturbed sleep would 
mean I was up all night. so it just kind of snowballed.80 

Some patients reported concerns about the insufficient time allocated for treatment.81–83  These patients expressed their 
perception that the structure of weekly psychotherapy did not support the full achievement of therapeutic gains.

With weekly sessions, you never truly get over the trauma.81 

For some patients, concerns regarding premature endings were also reported.83  This may be due to the short-term nature 
of the  outpatient treatment, the treatment failing to  address  integral aspects  of patients’  difficulties, and/or attachment- 
related anxieties known to contribute to PTSD psychopathology.49

The  therapy  has  really  helped,  but  I  need  more  because  I  am  just  open,  you  know  when  you  get  that  blast  and  you  see  that 
mushroom cloud, I am like the mushroom cloud it has not dissipated yet.83 

This was contrasted  with findings from  residential or  intensive  treatment programs which  seemed  to mitigate patients’ 
avoidance of challenging feelings/symptoms, with some patients reporting that this type of care allowed them to get more 
out of the treatment.

Tolerating Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
All studies reported patients’ experience of intense and difficult to tolerate responses to treatment. Frequently reported 
internal states associated with exposure to traumatic material included fears about the pain associated with reliving due to 
the need to openly talk about and/or vividly imagine certain aspects of patients’ index-trauma. Correspondingly, trauma- 
related “maladaptive defenses”,84  such as experiential avoidance, were reported across most studies.

When you come, you have to really like talk about it and how you’re feeling and that brings it like to the surface and it’s really 
raw and that’s really hard and sometimes, you know, you don’t feel like doing that ‘cause it’s painful.85 

Misaligned Treatment Rationale and Expectancy 
Several  studies50,80,86,87  highlighted  the  importance  of  providing  psychoeducation  regarding  PTSD  symptoms,  the 
treatment’s rationale, and its expected effects to positive outcomes.

I really do not understand CPT. Like what it’s supposed to do? I would not really know.80 

Studies  also  reported  the  significance  of  managing  patient’s  pre-treatment  expectations  and  considering  the  degree  of 
alignment between the treatment’s rationale, procedures, and patient’s needs.80,82,88–90

They [the clinicians] just want to go into the past, but we need or what I need is how to cope with what I have right now, and 
then everyday civilian life, instead of just regressing and getting to the roots.88 

Interpersonal Difficulties with Staff and Peers

peers, as factors influencing engagement in treatment and outcomes.70,82,91–93 At times these gave rise to patient feelings 
of disconnection and invalidation.80

I was pissed off that people were trying to desensitize me to something horrible that happened because it almost seems like, ‘Oh 
you’re overreacting just think about, just be around it enough and you won’t feel that way anymore.91 

In group settings, studies reported the impact of negative perceptions of other group members on patient retention and 
outcomes.

I was overwhelmed with knowing that I would soon have to tell my story. The fear of exposure was almost too much.93 

Demonstrating the clinical relevance of strong social support systems outside of the clinic on recovery, patients appeared 
to use relationships to adhere to the treatment protocol.

Studies70,88,91,92  also discussed how psychosocial stressors such as isolation adversely impacted participants’ experi-

ence of the treatment.

I  did  not  really  have  anyone  in-person  to  talk  to.  I  did  not  really  have  a  lot  of  support  in  terms  of  like  family  or  friends,  or 
relationships around me that were good.70 

Readiness
Studies  highlighted  the  contribution  of  intrapersonal  factors  (eg,  patient  traits,  beliefs,  and  internal  resources)  to  the 
overall experience of treatment.50–52,81,82,84,85,89–95  Most studies referred to the significant psychological burden PTSD 
treatment entails (eg, fear of re-traumatisation, worsening of symptoms and functional destabilization). Correspondingly, 
in  this  synthesis,  we  found  that  intrapersonal  factors  reportedly  influenced  patients’  perception  of  their  experience  of 
treatment,  and  conversely,  their  willingness  to  engage  in  often-challenging  therapeutic  processes.  The  umbrella  term 
“readiness” was chosen by authors to reflect various sub-themes identified.96

Patients  described  processes  of  coming  to  terms  with  the  severity  of  their  PTSD  symptoms  and  psychosocial 
difficulties.  This  form  of  tentative  acceptance  seemed  important  in  overcoming  ambivalence  about  seeking  treatment 
and then, tolerating challenging aspects of the therapeutic process.

Some patients referred to deeply held personal desires and values that encouraged engagement in treatment.

I’m really scared to go into [dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) prolonged exposure (PE). But. you get your DBT skills first 
[and] I think that’s what’s going to help me the most. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I deserve to be happy.91 

Once  in  treatment,  some  patients  reported  intentional  behaviors  aimed  at  making  the  most  out  of  their  treatment, 
cultivating a willingness to face fears associated with reliving their index-trauma.50–52,81,82,84,85,89–95  In contrast, in the 
context  of  possessing  a willingness  to confront  pain,  some participants  reported  feeling  incapable  of  engaging  fully  in 
imaginal  exposure  to  traumatic  events.  This  may  be  due  to  use  of  defenses,  such  as  avoidance,  and  hesitancy  about 
engaging in treatment due to psychosocial instability.53,97

Because I avoided talking about things, I probably didn’t get the full help I could have gotten.82 

Key Mechanisms of Change
Reviewed studies suggested a variety of key mechanisms of change associated with positive outcomes. EBPI in PTSD 
usually  entails  revisiting  traumatic  memories  to  gradually  reduce  hyper-  and  hypo-arousal  states,  characterised  by 
nervous system dysregulation, depersonalisation or dissociation.98 Aspects related to the previous theme (eg, “readiness”) 
appeared to support patients make use of the treatment process. Mechanisms of change identified in this synthesis include 
attainment  of  insight, behavioral activation,  corrective emotional experiences,  and changes  in trauma  narratives during 
and after treatment.

Patients  who  responded  to  treatment  described  attaining  insight  into  their  persistent  responses  to  internal  states 
associated  with  their  index-trauma.50–52,81,87–90,95,99–101  Conversely,  this  may  have  also  supported  patients  to  feel

validated  and  achieve  a  sense  of  mastery  over  their  symptoms.  Studies  discussed  the  importance  of  cultivating  self- 
awareness and possessing the capacity to notice “signals”94  surrounding the need for self-regulation.

If I was being triggered. usually it would come out in anger or fear. Before I did not really know why I was doing that and then 
throughout my therapy I realized it was the fear of their vulnerability.100 

In addition to consolidating learning pertaining to individual responses to traumatic stimuli, some treatment responders 
discussed achieving greater recall of the event, which appeared to play a significant part in the therapeutic process.95

That went a little deeper with every session. And with every trauma, actually. At some point, I could recall things that I had 
never. That I had never thought about again, that never crossed my mind.95 

Beyond attaining insight into emotional and behavioral responses to trauma, some patients described how greater insight 
facilitated  corrective  emotional  experiences  and  shifts  in  their  trauma  narratives,  accompanied  by  greater  compassion 
towards  self.51,87,93,101  Further,  referring  to  the  support  and  encouragement  of  the  therapist,  patients  detailed  how 
behavioral activation was facilitated by empowering therapists who promoted patients’ sense of agency and autonomy.

[The  clinician]  left  a  lot  of  decisions  up  to  me.  I  felt  like  he  was  taking  my  experience  into  consideration  and  not  just  his 
diagnosis [of me]. I felt like he allowed me to take part in what I felt was going to work for me.92 

In group-based interventions, fears of exposure and difficult relational dynamics could make it hard to engage in group- 
based  interventions.  However,  for  patients  who  responded  well  to  the  group  setting,  insights  and  corrective  emotional 
experiences  were  facilitated  by  processes  of  identification  with  others,  leading  to  feelings  of  validation  and 
belonging.51,54

Psychological Safety and Trust
All  studies  highlighted  the  importance  of  psychological  safety  and  trust  in  patient  experience  and  PTSD  treatment 
outcomes. This core theme distinguishes between psychological safety (PS) and trust. PS in healthcare settings refers to 
a myriad of systemic and interpersonal attributes leading to a shared belief that the treatment setting is safe to engage in 
interpersonal risk-taking.102  In the context of mental-health care, PS enhances patient security and feelings of empower-
ment through promoting an organisational culture imbued with openness and mutual respect.103  Conversely, trust refers 
to  the  interpersonal  dynamic  established  between  the  provider  and  patient.104  Trust  is  considered  a  fundamental 
component  in  trauma-informed  models  of  care  due  to  high  rates  of  betrayal  and  harmful  relational  power  dynamics 
reported in trauma survivors.105,106

This  synthesis  identified  3  sub-themes,  which  taken  together,  were  found  to  contribute  towards  and  determine  the 

quality of PS and trust perceived by the patient.

These include:
4a. Experience of Therapist
4b. Experience of Group and Wider Psychosocial Setting
4c. Experience of Self

Experience of Therapist 
Across  all  studies,  patients  reported  positive  and  negative  reactions  to  their  therapists  which  impacted  their 
engagement in treatment. Possessing trust in the therapists’ attunement and competency was associated with patient 
feelings  of  safety  and  validation.  This  appeared  to  enhance  patients’  ability  to  engage  in  the  often-challenging 
treatment  processes  by  supporting  openness  and  affective  regulation.  On  the  other  hand,  some  studies70,80,82,92 
reported  patients  felt  misunderstood  or  interpersonally  hurt  following  interactions  with  their  therapists.  These 
occurrences  appeared  to  hinder  treatment  engagement,  highlighting  the  centrality  of  interpersonal  trust  in  trauma- 
focused psychotherapy.

The trust in her [the clinician] and the fact that she understands me and can keep up with me and actually get to know me. This 
is very, very important.94

Experience of Group and Wider Psychosocial Setting 
Patients  reported  both  positive  and  negative  reactions  to  the  impact  and  clinical  utility  of  group-based  interventions. 
Positive perceptions of the group were characterised by increased feelings of belonging, confidence, and openness. Some 
patients reported increased anxiety about exposure in a group setting. Hearing the traumatic narratives and experiences of 
their peers appeared to be challenging in itself.93,99  Others discussed the presence and impact of difficult interpersonal 
dynamics that emerged in the group.93,99

I  found  some  parts  a  bit  triggering  when  people  recounted  their  personal  experiences.  I  felt  quite  frozen  and  couldn’t  speak. 
I found it harder to concentrate and felt myself go into a darker place when discussing suicide.99 

Experience of Self 
Patients  described  a  range  of  positive  and  negative  responses  to  PTSD  treatment  that  affected  their  sense  of  trust  and 
confidence in self.70,85,89,90,95,101 In turn, this seemed, at times, to impact their belief in their ability to endure and benefit 
from  the  treatment.  Patients  described  a  gradual  process  characterised  by  noticing  moderate  positive  changes  or 
differences in their self-narratives, beliefs, and emotional responses.

I noticed changes, I noticed differences. I thought, it is helping. So, let me just come back.89 

Correspondingly, patients also described how adverse responses to treatment negatively impacted their perception of self 
and capacity to utilise the treatment.

I  became  depressed,  withdrawn,  I  started  to  have  some  nightmares  again,  and  I  tried  it  for  about  a  week,  and  it  kept  getting 
worse  and  worse  and  I  said  this  is  not  worth  it.  I  did  not  feel  physically  and  mentally  able  to  continue  because  of  those 
reasons.70 

Psychedelic Therapy
Although  the  studies  varied  in their  methodology,  patient  populations, and  psychedelic  compounds,  there  were  themes 
relating  to  the  patient  experience  of  PT in  clinical  trials  that  were  consistently  reported.  We  present  a  snapshot  of  our 
findings relating to trauma-informed PT below.

Themes identified in this review:

1. Indirect Trauma Processing
2. Reorganisation of self-narratives via processes of relatedness and identification
3. Key Treatment Characteristics

Indirect Trauma Processing
Studies  referred  to  traumatic  stress  as  being  a  main  contributing  factor  to  psychopathology.55,107–117  In  most  studies, 
processing  traumatic  incidents  appeared  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the  narrative  surrounding  patients’  experience  of  the 
therapeutic process. Researchers reported patients confronting adverse childhood events and present-day stressors such as 
life-threatening diagnoses. Although not the explicit focus of the PT intervention, trauma-related material appeared in the 
form  of  visualisations,  disturbing  conscious  and  previously  repressed  memories,  somatic  trauma  responses,  and  emo-
tional states such as grief and fear. Some patients reported how the treatment supported integrating traumatic incidents 
into their lives or unburdening themselves from its weight as part of the change process.

Mostly from my childhood, related to my parents quarrelling. I saw a lot of bad things. I saw my father bribing my mother with 
jewelry,  flattering  her  with  leisure  activities,  with  superfluous  things.  I  saw  him  drinking,  falling  down  where  he  stored  his 
drinks.115

Reorganisation of Self-Narratives via Processes of Relatedness and Identification
All studies reported themes concerning patients’ perceived changes in self-narratives after PT. Reported changes in self- 
narratives  may  be  catalysed  or  accompanied  by  the  previously  highlighted  mechanisms  of  change  in  PT.56,71,118,119 
Further, increases in caring emotional responses towards self,57  connectedness towards others,55  experience of positive 
affect120  and health behavior change121  have been reported.

This  synthesis  found  patients  reported  changes  in  self-narratives  after  describing  meaningful  PT experiences  char-

acterised by processes of relatedness and identification across the following domains:

1a. With psychedelic compound
1b. With condition
1c. With the known biographical self, including body
1d. With significant others
1e. With spiritual or transcendental states
1f. With clinical team

Psychedelic Compound 
Patients reported perceiving the compound itself as possessing intentions and wisdom, attributing personifying meaning 
to the elicited subjective effects, and experiencing a helpful intrapersonal form of communication between self and the 
compound.  Patients  discussed  how  the  compound  seemingly  “gave”  or  “showed”  them  something  of  importance, 
highlighting  areas  that  required  their  attention  and  encouraging  engagement  with  previously  avoided  challenging 
experiences.38,55,110,111  Infused  with  this  knowledge  or  newfound  sense  of  direction,  patients  reportedly  felt  reassured 
and  had  a  perceived  sense  of  empowerment.  It  is  possible  that  these  occurrences  may  have  in  turn  supported  better 
treatment engagement.

During the session the thoughts were … “Do I travel the right path”? That was my question. Not dealing with death during the 
session but if I am on the right path. LSD gave me the feeling intensively that I am on the right path. That was nice.111 

Condition 
Patients reported the presence of a helping relationship between the compound and their condition. Potentially promoting 
cognitive  flexibility,122  patients  appeared  to  have  gained  a  sense  of  internal  space  or  distance  between  self  and  the 
condition  via  the  interaction  between  the  compound  and  the  condition.55,110,112,116,117,123  Correspondingly,  these  pro-
cesses  were  often  accompanied  by  positive  cognitive  reconstructions  related  to  the  nature  of  the  condition,  increased 
positive affect and reduction in adverse psychological symptoms.

I would say [I have] less anxiety about my body and my sickness coming back, my cancer coming back…I saw this body for 
what it’s worth, I picked it, it’s mine… I think that acceptance has been liberating.112 

Known Biographical Self, Including Body 
Patients described how PT appeared to facilitate a reexamination of past as well as present and at times, imagined future 
oriented, life experiences.38,55,107,112–116 Patients reported perceiving important life experiences during their treatment via 
imagery,  cognitions,  emotions,  physical  sensations,  and  memories.  These  biographical  remembrances,  directly  linked 
with patients’ self-narratives, were reportedly imbued with meaning and affect, which in turn promoted a more open and 
reflective stance towards their challenging experience and self-representation.

I don’t know if I really learned – it was more like letting back in stuff that I had blocked out?… I don’t think I changed my 
values, just remembered more of them. Or just remembered to honor them more, or…allow them more.114 

Significant Others 
Patients  described  exploring  past  and  present  relationships  with  loved  ones  and  friends.55,107,109,111,113,117,123  Patients

described  perceiving  with  more  clarity  and  appropriate  affect  relational  ruptures  and  experiencing  resolution.  Some 
patients reported feeling supported by their loved ones during the psychedelic treatment session, enhancing feelings of 
connectedness and the significance of others in their own self-narratives.117,123  Notably, some patients reported perceiv-
ing  the  presence  of  an  internal  “guide”  or  a  “being”  which  appeared  to  have  their  best  interests  at  heart;  at  times 
appearing as a loved one.109,112

I was thinking about relationships I had with other people and thinking I could see them clearly almost as if for the first time. I had 
fresh insight into things. It was almost as if suddenly the scales dropped from my eyes, I could see things as they really are.55 

Transcendental / Spiritual States 
Across  the  included  studies,  patients  reported  various  transcendental  or  spiritual  states.55,107–117  Patients  reported 
feelings  of unity, ego  dissolution, profound  connection  to others,  the  natural world  and the  universe.  These  states, 
potentially  leading  to  perspective  change  and  feelings  of  greater  contentedness,  were  often  accompanied  by 
a  range  of  intense  affects  and  a  visceral  sense  of  knowing.  Within  these  states,  some  patients  reported  grappling 
with  existential  themes  concerning  birth  and  dying.  Overall,  patients  reported  dramatically  changed  perspectives 
concerning  everyday  reality,  at  times  accompanied  by  a  greater  appreciation  towards  self,  others,  and  life  itself. 
These  experiences  were  also  characterised  by  an  overarching  sense  of  persuasiveness  and  purposefulness.

I see myself as part of something bigger. I felt myself connected into what had to be the collective mind yesterday, realizing it’s 
like “Oh, this exists, and we’re all just facets of this. It’s me connected to a wider sense of life or consciousness. And it’s, like, 
I know that rationally, but it was a time to feel it in a very real sense and experience it as real”.107 

Clinical Team 
Patients described the significance of therapists’ presence across most studies to positive outcomes. The degree of rapport 
and interpersonal safety with therapists was associated with feelings of trust towards the often challenging and unfamiliar 
treatment  process.  Some,  but  not  all,  patients  discussed  their  therapists  as  an  integral  component  of  the  treatment, 
supporting engagement by conveying a sense of confidence in the patient’s capacity to leverage their experience towards 
improvement.38,55,107–109,113,114 Notably, only one study55 highlighted instances of negative perceptions of therapists and 
its potential adverse influence on outcomes. These incidents included a brief discussion of a “problematic transference”, 
in which the patient linked their negative responses towards a therapist with previous experiences of care.

It’s not just the psilocybin sessions [but] it’s that human connection, and the support that comes with that human connection, 
that ultimately leads to success at the end of the day.114 

Key Treatment Characteristics
Ineffability and Awe 
Some  patients  found  it  difficult  to  describe  or  find  the  “right  words”  to  convey  their  experience  of  the  psychedelic 
session.55,107,109–111,113,114,117,123  The richness of the reported experiences and its corresponding therapeutic impact can 
be  inferred  by  observing  treatment  responders’  language,  often  laden  with  metaphors,  symbols,  affect  and  a  sense  of 
meaningfulness. When describing their experience, patients appeared to be struck by the multifaceted nature and novelty 
of  PT.  Acknowledging  the  limits  of  intellectual  understanding,  most  patients  in  the  reviewed  studies  appeared  to  be 
curious about their experience, or positively affected by this sense of awe173 as opposed to being disturbed by it. Of note, 
the MDMA-AT study112 did not report similar themes. This may be due to the mechanism of action and subjective effects 
of MDMA, an entactogen, as opposed to classical psychedelics.

It was a feeling beyond an intellectual feeling—it was a feeling to the bottom of my core. that’s one reason that it’s hard to talk 
about. it’s beyond words.117

Immersive Experiential Immediacy and Intensity 
Patients across most studies reported vivid descriptions of intense experiential processes characterised by immersive 
and  dramatic  physiological  and  psychological  responses  to  the  compound’s  subjective  effects  and  treatment 
process.38,55,109–116,123  The  immediacy  effect  of  the  treatment  was  reported  in  the  context  of  having  direct  and 
unavoidable encounters with the unfolding phenomena observed during their psychedelic treatment session. Of note, 
the  immersive  and  intense  nature  of  the  treatment  appeared  to  empower  patients  to  confront  rather  than  avoid  both 
negative  and  positive  cognitions,  emotions,  and  somatic  reactions  to  the  treatment.

I  feel  like  what  happened  was  that  in  a  very  short  period  of  intense  time  I  dealt  with  some  really  powerful  things  and  put  it 
behind me.109 

Arc of Struggle and Distress Towards Resolution 
Patients  reported  being  compelled  to  engage  with  challenging  experiences  in  the  service  of  promoting  healing  and 
change.38,55,107–111,114–117,123  Patients  reported  a  sense  of  working  through  burdensome  aspects  of  their  experience 
catalysed  by  the  compound  (eg,  intense  emotional  states,  somatic  reactions,  ego-dissolution,  and  complex  imagery)  to 
eventually  perceive  a  sense  of  resolution.  These  experiences  were  characterised  by  a  sense  of  movement  between 
previously  avoided  internal  states,  and  a  sense  of  momentum,  which  appeared  to  support  patients  to  engage  with  the 
unfolding experience. Terms such as “rollercoaster”111 or “turbulence”114 were identified. Acceptance of the struggle and 
possessing a willingness to engage in experiential excursions into challenging states,  appeared supportive in achieving 
a meaningful perception of resolution.

It was an intense, intense struggle, and that’s where it became medicinal because it allowed that struggle to happen. It didn’t 
coat it, it wasn’t an antidepressant. it brought it all out.117 

Change Beyond Symptom Reduction 
Across  all  studies  patients  reported  responses  to  treatment  that  appeared  beyond  the  scope  of  symptomatic  reduction. 
Patients’ post-treatment made references to possessing a changed perspective regarding self, others, and the world. These 
shifts  were  accompanied  by  a  sense  of  clarity  about  what  matters  most  (eg,  values)  and  a  determination  to  make 
meaningful changes  aligned with these values.  At times philosophical,  these changes appeared to be a  consequence of 
and  catalyst  for  increased  positive  affect  post-treatment.  Frequently  reported  values  pertained  to  the  importance  of 
meaningful relationships, possessing a more curious stance towards self and others, and a sense of connection to spiritual 
aspects in everyday life, including the natural world. Of note, patients often reported changes in behavior that appeared to 
support these shifts, including initiating meditation practices, engaging in new hobbies, and repairing relationships.

I’ve been involved with the local literacy council all the time now … And then the other thing is I’ve become very involved 
with  this  environmental  group  as  well  …  instead  of  sitting  around  and  just  watching  television  and  smoking  and  doing 
nothing.114 

Difference from Other Treatments 
Some studies described patients’ reports of how PT differed from standard treatment.55,110,111,115,117 These accounts were 
in support of PT over first-line treatments. This is unsurprising given that PT trials are for patients who have not been 
helped by standard treatments. PT appeared to accelerate therapeutic processes (eg, promoting insights, enhancing access 
to  a  wider  range  of  affects,  and  facilitating  a  more  immediate  connection  to  self  during  and  after  treatment).  Patients 
reported  confronting,  as  opposed  to  avoiding,  challenging  and  yet  necessary  therapeutic  processes.  In  the  context  of 
addressing  psychophysical  ailments  including  addiction  and  cancer-related  distress,  patients  referred  to  the  need  for 
a holistic and integrated approach to care.

In  usual  psychotherapy  it  is  mainly  about  talking,  about  words.  In  LSD-assisted  psychotherapy  it  is  mainly  about  inner 
processes, inner change, inner experience, it gets enriched by it.111

Importance of Non-Pharmacological Factors 
Studies  highlighted  patients’  accounts  concerning  the  central  importance  of  the  treatment’s  non-pharmacological 
factors.38,55,107,109,111,112,114,116,121,123 Factors often referred to include the impact of therapist presence and interventions, 
the  significance  of  music  and  the  focus  of  the  non-psychedelic  sessions  (eg,  preparation  /  integration).  Patients  made 
references to the therapeutic utility of the actual physical environment of the psychedelic session, including the lights and 
sonic  ambience  inside  the  treatment  room.  In  a  group-based  intervention,  patients  made  references  to  other  patients 
undergoing the treatment. Positive reactions to these factors appeared to enhance feelings of safety and in turn encourage 
greater immersion in the psychedelic state.

Discussion
This  synthesis  explores salient  themes in  patient  experience  of  EBPI in  PTSD and PT  for  mental-health  indications  in 
authorised, medically supervised, clinical trials. This study identified a total of 7 key themes from the thematic analysis 
of  the  included  papers.  In  EBPI:  Patient  Burden,  Psychological  Safety  and  Trust,  Readiness  and  Key  Mechanisms  of 
Change.  In  PT:  Reorganisation  of  Self-Narratives  via  Processes  of  Relatedness  and  Identification,  Indirect  Trauma 
Processing and Key Treatment Characteristics (Figure 3).

Overall,  the  included  studies  demonstrated  that  EBPI  in  PTSD  and  PT  across  indications  compel  the  patient  to 
contend with a range of arduous processes in the service of recovery. In both treatment paradigms, patients highlighted 
the  intense  biopsychosocial  nature  and  heavy  demands  of  treatment.  Applying  insights  from  this  review,  below  we 
expand on 5 areas relevant to positive safety outcomes in future PT research and practice.

Traumatic Stress in PT
An  integral  finding  of  this  study  pertains  to  the  overarching  presence  of  trauma-related  psychopathology  across 
indications  in  PT  research.  This  may  be  due  to  higher  prevalence  of  trauma  exposure  in  treatment-resistant  patient 
populations.124,125  Correspondingly,  researchers  have  discussed  the  potential  utility  of  PT  to  treat  PTSD,72  citing 
psychedelics’ mechanisms of action58,126  and its hypothesised transdiagnostic utility.59,127

Given  the  prevalence  of  trauma-related  psychopathology  across  mental-health  conditions,  the  results  of  this  study 
indicate it is crucial that PT research protocols consider the impact of trauma exposure on patients and the potential value

of trauma-informed care (TIC)14,128,129 in mitigating adverse events. Adding to DSM-based conceptualisations of mental 
ill health,130 TIC considers the unique predispositions patients who have been exposed to traumatic events present with;73 
treating  the  person,  rather  than  the  condition,  within  the  context  of  their  psychosocial  and  cultural  lived-experience. 
Further,  comparative  research  studies  investigating  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  adjunct  psychotherapeutic  interven-
tions in PT are absent. In this context, some have advocated for CBT to be considered the “default” model in PT,131 while 
others have highlighted the utility of the common factors theory of psychotherapy,74  psychoanalytic psychology132  and 
non-specific psychological support.22 It is important that data is gathered to support or refute these hypotheses. However, 
until an evidence base is developed, implementing trauma-informed approaches, that carefully consider the biopsycho-
social effects of psychedelics, may promote positive safety outcomes in PT research by personalising care.

As traumatic experiences may have elements of interpersonal or institutional betrayal, secrecy, or persecution,133,134 
TIC  highlights  interpersonal  and  intrapersonal  dimensions  that  require  careful  clinical  consideration.135,136  Here  we 
discuss factors relating to psychological safety and trust, which may help inform clinical practice in PT research.

Interpersonal Factors
Adverse interpersonal dynamics, also influenced by patients’ and therapists’ attachment styles contribute to the quality of 
the  therapeutic  alliance  (TA).137–139  Higher  TA  scores  are  associated  with  greater  symptom  reduction  in  PTSD 
psychotherapy.60  In  PT,  one  study  found  a  correlation  between  TA  and  positive  outcomes140  while  another,  larger  and 
multi-centre study, did not find TA to moderate outcomes.141 Nevertheless, given the importance of non-pharmacological 
factors in PT and healthcare,142  the quality of interpersonal care is considered important to positive outcomes.143

This  synthesis  suggests  that  traumatised  patients  may  be  acutely  sensitive  to  adverse  relational  and  attachment 
dynamics that  may emerge during  and in response to treatment. These may  include  instances of  empathic failures  and 
therapist  mis-attunement  and  power  imbalances  and  ruptures.61,144,145  For  example,  in  this  synthesis  EBPI  patients 
highlighted  the  adverse  impact  of  therapists  prioritising  rigid  adherence  to  the  treatment  protocol  over  meaningful 
interpersonal contact.80,92

Further,  excessive  shame,  past  experiences  of  betrayal,  and  moral  injury  might  make  it  difficult  for  traumatised 
patients to request support during intense PT sessions, potentially leading to feelings of isolation and withdrawal.75,133 
Slipping  into  traumatic  awareness,76  some  patients  may  experience  these  occurrences  as  traumatic  reenactments, 
reminiscent of past experiences of neglect and abandonment.146 Taken together, clinicians should be mindful of patients’ 
experiences  of  interpersonal  trauma,  associated  impact  on  personality147  and  subsequent  capacity  to  engage  in  PT,  an 
intervention that may elicit profound regressive states.148

Intrapersonal Factors
Traumatised patients may be burdened by demoralising  self-narratives often accompanied by persistent  negative affect 
and  negatively  biased  cognitions.9,149  Failing  to  achieve  progress  in  treatment  may  reinforce  these  self-narratives, 
potentially  leading  to  increased  psychiatric  destabilisation  and  psychosocial  dysfunction.  Correspondingly,  PT  trial 
participants may be more susceptible to these intrapersonal dispositions, perceiving themselves as having failed standard 
treatments as opposed to have been failed by treatments. Coupled with the high expectations some patients hold towards 
PT,150  failing  to  achieve  progress  may  further  corroborate  these  harmful  self-narratives,  increasing  feelings  of  hope-
lessness and potentially leading to increased risk. Therefore, viewing these self-narratives as maladaptive but necessary 
psychological defenses in response to traumatic events may help mitigate patients’ pathologising styles of relating to self, 
increase  curiosity  and  enhance  safety  outcomes.  Taken  together,  to  promote  psychological  safety  and  trust,  this  theme 
demonstrates  the  need  to  establish  clinical  and  organisational  cultures  that  promote  consent,  collaboration,  agency, 
transparency, trustworthiness, and cultural humility in EBPI and PT.

Key Mechanisms of Change
This review highlighted a potential thematic overlap between EBPI and PT in the context of psychological mechanisms 
of change. Broadly, patients discussed how the treatments encouraged behavioral activation, and catalysed novel insights 
and corrective emotional experiences related to their symptoms and beliefs about self and others. While EBPI patients’

narratives were often focused on the impact of treatment on PTSD symptoms, PT patients reported therapeutic processes 
that  were  also  linked  to  obtaining  a  greater  sense  of  connection  to  their  values,  increased  meaningfulness,  and 
appreciation of the importance of spirituality. When delivering care in PT trials, it is important that clinicians working 
primarily  in  evidence-based  approaches  possess  an  appreciation  of  the  clinical  utility  of  value-based,151  meaning 
reconstructing,152  and  psychospiritual  processes153,154  on  positive  outcomes.  Further,  it  has  been  suggested  that  PT 
may modulate psychological defenses,77,155 potentially leading to the immersive, experiential immediacy and intensity of 
the treatment. Correspondingly, this theme suggests that clinicians should be prepared to support patients through intense 
therapeutic processes, initiated and completed in a relatively short period of time. Modelling confidence and purposeful-
ness without negating patient safety, clinicians should approach instances of struggle during PT as a potentially valuable 
component  of  the  treatment  process;  sensitively  conveying  trust  in  the  patients’  resources  to  utilise  challenging 
occurrences during PT. Importantly, clinicians should be prepared to support patients who did not perceive an immediate 
sense  of  resolution  and  treatment  non-responders,  who  may  perceive  challenging  PT  experiences  as  destabilising, 
potentially reinforcing harmful core beliefs and intensifying negative affect associated with unresolved conflicts.

Re-Organisation of Self-Narratives via Processes of Relatedness and Identification
Along  with  symptoms  such  as  avoidance  and  hyperarousal,  negative  self-narratives  may  be  a  consequence  of,  and 
a maintaining factor, in trauma-related psychopathology.156,157  Broadly, self-narratives construct identities by organising 
life experiences into seemingly coherent stories that define the person’s subjective experience of self.158 Correspondingly, 
harmful self-narratives may include

Negative convictions about the self, low expectations about one’s efficacy and value, and an exaggerated preoccupation with the 
projected negative judgment of others.65 

This study highlighted the potential transformative interaction between patient’s self-narratives and experiences elicited 
by the psychedelic compound and therapeutic context. Patients reported processes of relatedness and identification with 
the compound, significant others, and transcendental states. These intrapersonal processes, supported by the treatment’s 
non-pharmacological  factors  and  potentially  facilitated  by  the  patients  enhanced  neural  and  cognitive  plasticity,66 
appeared  to  help  participants  re-organise  damaging  self-narratives.  Shifting  from  “what  is  wrong  with  you?”,  a  self- 
narrative  indicative  of  cognitive  rigidity  and  blame,  to  “what  happened  to  you?”;  an  exploratory  and  accepting  stance 
towards self.159  This in turn appeared to support therapeutic gains by promoting curiosity towards entrenched negative 
autobiographies  and  increase  openness  to  change.  However,  PT  sessions  are  inherently  unpredictable,67  potentially 
catalysing  anxious  ego-dissolution  and  intense  negative  affect160,161  that  may  reinforce  patient’s  harmful  self- 
narratives.  Further,  positive  and  negative  experiences  in  PT  may  increase  patients’  suggestibility  and  vulnerability,68 
potentially  enhancing  patients  need  and  capacity  for  relatedness  and  identification.  Correspondingly,  this  may  enhance 
the  potential  for  adverse  idealising  transferences162  and  perceived  instances  of  neglect,  requiring  thoughtful  clinical 
management.  Taken  together,  on-going  therapist  training,  supervision,  and  ethical  oversight  is  crucial  to  mitigate 
potential risks associated with PT.

Readiness
This research suggested that factors pertaining to patients’ perceived sense of readiness to engage in treatment contribute 
to positive outcomes. Readiness in this study refers to the patients’ capacity to tolerate intense negative affect, overcome 
defenses,  possess  an  intentional  desire  to change  and  admit  that  one  needs  support.78,163  Despite  the  lack  of  empirical 
data, patients’ lack of readiness for treatment may be associated with poorer outcomes, including adverse reactions such 
as symptomatic deterioration and suicidality.164 Correspondingly, there is a lack of standardised best practices across PT 
studies,  including  screening  measures  evaluating  patient’s  suitability,  rather  than  medical  eligibility,  for  PT.69,165 
Considering  the  novelty  and  multifaceted  nature  of  PT,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  provide  healthcare  systems  with 
validated  assessment  tools,  personalising  PT  protocols  to  the  patient’s  presentation  to  promote  positive  and  durable 
outcomes.

Further,  this  research  demonstrated  the  significance  of  careful  treatment  staging  and  expectancy  in  outcomes. 
Treatment staging seeks to optimise outcomes by personalising the type and timing of the intervention to the patients’ 
current needs, resources, and risk of illness progression.166  As patients may perceive a discrepancy between their needs 
and abilities or lack a clear understanding concerning the treatment’s rationale, this review highlights the importance of 
accessible psychoeducation regarding PTs rationale and procedures prior, during and after treatment.

Real-World Barriers
This  review  demonstrates  how  patient  burden  can  conflate  both  logistical  factors  and  the  often-demanding  treatment 
procedures.  PTSD  treatment-specific  challenges  (eg,  exacerbation  of  existing  symptoms)  may  enhance  patients’ sensi-
tivity to so-called “real world” barriers (eg, travel, employment, relationships).167 Correspondingly, real-world difficulties 
may  make  it  more  challenging  for  patients  to  utilise  interventions  that  in  and  of  themselves  may  produce  significant 
distress. Therefore, it  is  important clinicians  pay  attention to the  patient’s  everyday psychosocial circumstances during 
treatment; failing to situate the patient in the “real-world” or considering the impact of treatment emergent adverse events 
on psychosocial functioning may lead to poor outcomes. Of note, this finding was prominent in the EBPI group. This is 
likely  due  to  EBPI  being  well-established  and  delivered  across  healthcare  settings  and  the  longer-term  structure  of 
treatment, mostly delivered on a weekly basis over the course of weeks/months. Given the immediate and intense effects 
of  PT,  if  approved  and  delivered  within  public  healthcare  systems,  significant  consideration  to  the  patient’s  real-world 
responsibilities and realities will be required to promote durable safety and efficacy outcomes.

Implications
Reviewing the results presented in this paper, it is important to consider the implications of these findings. Firstly, our 
sample contains multiple and different interventions, indications, and cultures. However, we identified several thematic 
consistencies across the studies. Few of the studies presented conflicting ideas, thus it would be fair to conclude that the 
identified themes provide a fitting representation of patients’ experiences of EBPI and PT. Correspondingly, the results 
may support the design of future, trauma-informed, PT research studies exploring the potential safety and effectiveness of 
first-line  psychological  therapies  as  an  adjunct  to  PT.  Further,  should  psychedelic  forms  of  therapy  receive  regulatory 
approval,  providers  will  require  specialist  training  to  ensure  patient  safety.  The  findings  of  this  study  may  support  the 
development of patient-centred training and supervision programmes by demonstrating a clinical overlap between EBPI 
and PT and highlighting the similarities and differences of patients’ experience of the treatments.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. Firstly, we were unable to include papers not written in English. As a result, 37 EBPI 
in  PTSD  and  2  PT  papers  were  excluded,  which  may  have  provided  insight  into  patients’  experiences.  An  additional 
limitation is that PT studies generally appeared positively biased, often reporting the experience of treatment responders, 
and rarely discussing adverse events/responses. As psilocybin and MDMA edge nearer towards regulatory approval and 
rapid-onset,  short-acting  psychedelics  with  limited  safety  data  are  developed,168–170  it  is  vital  that  future  qualitative 
studies target treatment emergent adverse events in PT to ensure patient safety and inform ethical practice guidelines.

Conclusions
Overall, this synthesis provides important insights into patients’ experience of EBPI in PTSD and PT across conditions. 
The synthesis provides clinicians unfamiliar with PT with an introductory understanding of the treatment’s opportunities, 
challenges,  and  procedures  via  the  analysis  of  patients’  experiences.  Correspondingly,  this  work  provides  PT research 
teams  with  a  broader  understanding  of  PTSD  patients’  experience  of  first-line  interventions,  including  barriers  to 
treatment  and  the  critical  impact  of  traumatic-stress  psychopathology  on  outcomes.  Given  the  potential  prevalence  of 
trauma  exposure  in  PT  trial  participants,171  incorporating  transdiagnostic,  trauma-informed  paradigms  of  care  in  PT 
research protocols may improve safety and acceptability outcomes. Further, this study highlights the need for additional 
qualitative  research  in  PT,  with  a  particular  focus  on  treatment  non-responders.  Critical  qualitative  methods  and  long- 
term follow up studies may provide valuable insights into potential interpersonal, intrapersonal, and psychosocial factors

impacting outcomes. Lastly, as the field of PT matures, studies investigating the significance of the intervention’s non- 
pharmacological  factors,  therapist  effects  and  the  suitability  of  adjunct  psychotherapeutic  modalities  on  outcomes  are 
needed.  Focusing  on  patients’  experience,  these  studies  may  support  a  broader,  multidisciplinary  understanding  of  PT, 
identify potential psychological predictors of response, optimise clinical care, and improve treatment outcomes.
