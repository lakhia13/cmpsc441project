ABSTRACT

Depersonalization/derealization

disorder is characterized by
depersonalization often co-occurring
with derealization in the absence of
significant psychosis, memory, or
identity disturbance.
Depersonalization/derealization is
categorized as one of the dissociative
disorders, which also includes
dissociative amnesia, dissociative
fugue, dissociative identity disorder,
and forms of dissociative disorder not
otherwise specified. Although these
disorders may be under-diagnosed or
misdiagnosed, many persons with
psychiatric illness who have
experienced trauma report symptoms
consistent with dissociative disorders.
There are limited scientific data on
prevalence of depersonalization/
derealization disorder specifically. This
paper reviews clinical,
phenomenological and epidemiological
information regarding diagnosis and
treatment of dissociative disorders in
general, and illustrates common
presenting histories of persons with
derealization/depersonalization
disorder utilizing composite cases. The

clinical vignettes focus on
recommended psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy interventions as part
of a comprehensive multidisciplinary
treatment plan for these individuals.

INTRODUCTION

Dissociative disorders were
described prior to 19001,2 but many
years passed with little interest in this
spectrum of psychiatric symptoms.
More recent research indicates the
symptoms of these conditions are
severe and disabling, resulting in high
utilization of community resources
including psychiatric services.
Dissociative disorders, along with
other complex posttraumatic disorders
with which they are often grouped, are
very costly to individuals as well as the
mental health delivery system.1
Complicating factors include
misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis,
which may occur due to clinicians’
unfamiliarity with this spectrum of
disorders, disbelief that they exist,1,3 or
lack of knowledge and appreciation of
the epidemiology of these disorders,
particularly trauma history. 

Dissociation often begins in

childhood and can occur in adult life as
a normal adaptive measure when
danger or trauma is encountered; the
dissociated state presumably enables
the individual to tolerate the
circumstances.4 Dissociation becomes
pathological when the individual is
unable to control when and where it
occurs or when the adaptive measure
becomes generalized to other
situations and circumstances, or when
it persists beyond the presence of
danger. It is important for the
psychiatrist to accurately diagnose
depersonalization/derealization
disorder, but also take the symptoms
into account within the context of the
trauma history when formulating a
treatment plan. Patients who receive
treatment interventions that address
their trauma-based dissociative
symptoms are more likely to
experience improved functioning and
fewer residual symptoms.1

DEPERSONALIZATION/
DEREALIZATION DISORDER

Depersonalization/derealization
disorder is classified as a dissociative
disorder. Dissociation can be viewed as
an attempt by the individual to
“prevent overwhelming flooding of
consciousness at the time of trauma.”4
Dissociative symptoms are sometimes
defined as “a loss of needed
information or as discontinuity of
experience.”3–5 The Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has
incorporated derealization in name and
symptom structure of what was
previously called depersonalization
disorder and is now called
depersonalization/derealization
disorder (DDD).6

DDD previously was described by
Allen and Smith in 1993 as a “distorted
experience of self, associated with a
sense of unreality or strangeness and
profound detachment, i.e. feeling like
an outside observer, an automaton, as
if in a dream.”4 Patients with DDD are
usually highly distressed by their
symptoms, which may cause
significant impairment. Careful
questioning about suicidal thoughts
and attempts is important, as the

patient may feel there is no escaping
the symptoms. Coons2 reported that
depersonalization and/or derealization
are quite common psychiatric
symptoms and psychiatrists should
screen for these regularly. These
symptoms are infrequently asked
about during the psychiatric intake,
however. DDD typically is thought to
present during adolescence or early
adulthood but incidence and
prevalence data are not well
established. 

SOME ASSESSMENT AND
SCREENING INSTRUMENTS FOR
DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS
There have been important
developments in the assessment of
dissociative disorders within the past
several years.1 The Multiscale
Dissociation Inventory7 was normed
and standardized using the responses
of traumatized individuals and
validated in clinical, community, and
university samples.1 The
Multidimensional Inventory of
Dissociation8 yields an all-inclusive
dissociative profile and is the only
measure of self-report dissociation
with validity scales. It is available on
the International Society for the Study
of Trauma and Dissociation’s (ISSTD)
website (http://www.isst-d.org/).1, 9  The
Dissociative Experiences Scale-
Revised10 is a new version of the
Dissociative Experiences Scale11 that
uses a Likert response scale (ranging
from never to at least once per week).1

CLINICAL VIGNETTE

Ms. M was a 49-year-old divorced
woman with history of alleged sexual
abuse by her brother who was three
years her senior; the abuse reportedly
occurred from ages 11 to 16. During
her adolescent and adult life, Ms. M
had a series of unsuccessful and
abusive relationships, beginning with a
teenage pregnancy during high school
which precipitated her dropping out of
school prior to graduation and
becoming a single mother with no
social support. She was since twice
divorced, and was currently in a
relationship with a man who was 10
years her senior. The patient

presented for an intake at the
psychiatrist’s office and, although
nervous, was able to answer questions
about her living environment and
children. She had good eye contact
and responded appropriately to
questions during the first part of the
interview. When the psychiatrist
broached the subject of developmental
years and family of origin, the patient
hesitated and paused prior to
answering; she also appeared
tremulous and exhibited shallow and
more rapid respirations. 

Psychiatrist: You seem distracted.
Tell me what is happening right
now.

Patient: (pauses) I know I am sitting
across from you in a chair, but I am
not in my body. I am floating in the
air. I am watching both of us from
above your office plant. 

Psychiatrist: What caused that to

happen?

Patient: I thought you were going to

make me talk about what
happened.

Psychiatrist: When we meet, you can
decide what we talk about. If I ask
you a question and you would
prefer not to answer, just let me
know. This is your appointment.
What can I do to help you right
now?

Patient: I don’t want to talk.
Psychiatrist: You are safe here in this

room.

PRACTICE POINT: MAKING AN
ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS

The first priority is to collect data to
accurately diagnose the patient and to
focus on acute symptoms and her
sense of safety. The room and the
relationship with the therapist must be
established as a safe place for her to
share her story.

“Hearing voices:”

Differentiating dissociation from
psychotic symptoms. Approximately
one third to one half of patients with
dissociative disorders will experience
“hearing voices.”2 The psychiatrist
must differentiate between the
auditory hallucinations experienced in
psychosis and the “voices” that can be

38

heard during dissociative episodes. In a
psychotic patient who also has been
traumatized, this can be extremely
difficult, as they can experience both
symptoms. The individual with
dissociative symptoms may describe
these as ‘inner voices’ and are to be
distinguished from auditory
hallucinations which occur in
schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders and usually seem to be
coming from an external source. The
“voices” associated with dissociative
disorders can vary significantly; they
may be social, directive, negative,
critical, or derogatory.2 In some
patients, the voice is that of the
perpetrator. This auditory experience
can be processed in the room with the
therapist.

In general, patients with dissociative
disorders do not explain hallucinations
or dissociative experiences with the
delusional thought processes that
some psychotic patients utilize to
make sense of their perceptual
experiences. Rather, patients with
dissociative disorders tend to
experience these symptoms as
“inexplicable and frightening” as well
as indicators that they are “crazy.”3 In
fact, it is typical for patients with
dissociative symptoms to conceal
and/or rationalize the dissociative
experiences and may avoid admission
due to apprehension or
embarrassment.3

CLINICAL VIGNETTE, CONTINUED
After a period of significant

improvement, Ms. M. presented for her
weekly psychotherapy appointment
very distressed, crying and visibly
anxious. 

Patient: (crying) I can’t do this. I have
forgotten everything and can’t go
out anymore. I thought I was better!

Psychiatrist: What has happened
since we last met last week?
Patient: You told me I had made

progress and I was getting better.
You were wrong! I am worse off
now than when I started coming
here. I am completely embarrassed!

Psychiatrist: It is clear you are

me what has happened since we
last met?

Patient: I thought I was getting better
so I went to the grocery. I have
never tried that before by myself. I
needed a couple things and so I
waited until I thought everyone was
at work or school and walked up
the store. I was at the cashier
paying for the groceries and that’s
when it happened! (crying)
Psychiatrist: I understand you are
upset right now; if you are able I
want you to help me understand.
Can you tell me what happened
when you were paying for your
groceries?

Patient: It happened right there at the
grocery! I was floating up in the
corner looking down at myself
standing at the cash register. I have
never been so embarrassed. 
Psychiatrist: Do you think others in

the store knew what was happening
to you?

Patient: I don’t know, but you said I
was getting better and obviously
that is not the case. This happens at
home but it has never happened in
other places.

Psychiatrist: Tell me what it was like.
Patient: I forgot what I was supposed
to say and I got scared that I would
not know how to answer the
questions, or have enough money,
or remember my list. I started to
panic and the cashier asked me a
question. I don’t remember what it
was, but I wasn’t sure how to
answer it. Then I started floating up
in the corner, and other people
were there and probably know how
crazy I am now. I could not move or
speak! It used to be just my family
but now everyone knows. (crying)

Psychiatrist: It all sounds very

upsetting. I’m sorry you had to go
through that. I am wondering—is it
possible that this is the first time it
happened outside your home
because you have made progress,
and you are out in the community
more now than you ever have been
before?

Patient: I don’t know what you mean.
Psychiatrist: It only happened at

struggling right now. Can you tell

home because you spend nearly all

of your time there. It has been a
safe place, just like coming here for
therapy. As you get better, you start
thinking about going out in the
community so you can get on with
your life. If you spend more time
outside, this may happen in other
places for the first time. 

Patient: I was embarrassed. I’m not

sure you understand that.

Psychiatrist: I want to understand
what happened to you. I want to
help so you can continue to move
forward.

Patient: I was floating up in the corner

of the store. 

Psychiatrist: What happened next?
Patient: I think I finally remembered

what to say, to answer the question
and get my money ready, so I paid
for my groceries. 

Psychiatrist: Were others aware of

this?

Patient: No one said anything. The

cashier took my money and I left. I
think it must have lasted a minute
or two, but at the time it seemed
like a long time. 

Psychiatrist: It sounds like an

important step forward for you to
have gone out in the community by
yourself. Have you thought of it in
that way?

Patient: It does sound like a big step

when you put it like that. Maybe no
one noticed as much as I thought. I
do worry each time one of these
episodes happens that I will never
return to my body.

PRACTICE POINT: EXPLORING THE
EPISODES AND REFINING
TREATMENT

Following this revealing

appointment, the work should focus on
reframing the episodes when they
occur and exploring the different ways
to interpret them. Also, details should
be discussed to assure the “floating”
experiences are not actually psychotic
symptoms or part of an previously
unappreciated psychotic disorder.
Stress, trauma, and the

neurobiology of dissociation. Acute
trauma responses to motor vehicle
accidents, various forms of abuse, and
imprisonment include

[ V O L U M E   1 1 ,   N U M B E R   7 – 8 ,   J U L Y – A U G U S T   2 0 1 4 ]   Innovations in CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE

depersonalization and derealization.3
These responses, in themselves, are
not necessarily unusual or “abnormal”
in certain acute situations. Several
researchers have proposed that
depersonalization is an inhibitory
response that is “hard-wired” to
diminish anxiety and foster
hyperarousal states.3, 12 Under these
conditions, the person transforms into
a survival mode where physical
resources are conserved and adaptive
behavior takes control during the
threatening or dangerous situation.
The individual’s response becomes
pathological when the response either
generalizes to other situations or
persists beyond the immediate threat. 

Spiegel et al3 outlines the

consistently documented threefold
neurobiological patterns found in DDD:
1) activation in posterior cortical
sensory association areas (especially
inferior parietal lobule); 2) prefrontal
activation, and 3) limbic inhibition.
These alterations are consistent with
simulated “out of body” experiences
involving the inferior parietal lobule.3
Patients with DDD also have a distinct
pattern of dysregulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.3
Specifically, in DDD, the following are
seen: 1) baseline hyperactivity, 2)
diminished negative feedback
inhibition, and 3) blunted reactivity to
psychosocial stress. Other
neurobiological changes specific to
DDD reported by Simeon et al14
include marked decline of basal
norepinephrine in response to anxiety
co-occurring with increase in
noradrenergic tone. Overall, there is
evidence for the hypothesis that
autonomic blunting occurs in DDD.3, 14
Developments in treatment. A

recent review by Brand et al1 of the
dissociative disorder treatment
literature concluded that when
treatment is specifically adapted to
address the complex traumas and high
level of dissociation among these
patients, even severely dissociative
individuals improve.1, 15 A course of
psychotherapy for patients with
dissociative disorders may be
complicated and sometimes require an
eclectic approach or periods of change

between supportive versus
psychodynamic approaches.16, 17 During
periods of acute stressors, frequent
dissociation, and/or severe depression
and anxiety, supportive interventions
(crisis interventions and shoring up
existing coping skills and strategies)
are a better fit; during periods of
relatively mild symptoms a
psychodynamic approach may be
utilized (focusing on self-reflection and
self-examination). Psychodynamic
psychotherapy uses self-reflection and
self-evaluation achieved through the
therapeutic alliance and
interrelationship with the
psychiatrist.16 The expectation is that
the patient will explore effective
coping strategies and relationship
patterns. The psychiatrist attempts to
reveal the unconscious components of
the patient’s maladaptive functioning
and attends to resistance as it reveals
itself.16, 17 Facilitation of change is
accomplished over time when a
trusting alliance is established,
resistance is managed, and deeper
understanding has developed. 

There is no known

pharmacotherapy for the treatment of
DDD.13 The literature includes trials of
clomipramine, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, and lamotrigine.12, 13
Research using selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors in patients with
DDD has shown that serotonin
agonists such as meta-
chlorphenylpiperazine can induce
symptoms of depersonalization and/or
derealization1. Sierra12 suggested
possible agents may include opioid
agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) agonists, and serotonin 2C
agonists. No efficacy for any of these
medications or classes was proven.
More research is needed as the
evidence is inconclusive. 

Atypical (or second generation)
antipsychotic drugs that block both
dopamine (D2) and serotonin (5HT2A)
receptors may be of use in treating
complex trauma cases with “psychotic
features” although the psychiatrist
should carefully evaluate symptoms
that appear to be abnormal
perceptions taking into account the
dissociative symptoms reported by the

patient. Opioid antagonists have also
shown some promise in the treatment
of dissociative symptoms;1 the mu and
kappa systems in particular have been
implicated in symptoms of
depersonalization and analgesia.
Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has
exhibited some effect in reducing
symptoms of DDD.1,13,14

Most medications prescribed to

patients with DDD fall into the
categories of antidepressant and
anxiolytic and are initiated to alleviate
comorbid anxiety and mood symptoms
(especially panic and obsessions), but
do not treat the dissociative
psychopathology.12,13 Stabilization of
mood may contribute to a more
tolerable affective state. Currently, no
pharmacological treatment has been
found to reduce dissociation, per se.19
The psychiatrist must be cautious in
using benzodiazepines to reduce
anxiety as they can also exacerbate
dissociation.19,20 There are no controlled
or randomized outcome studies and
few trials examining pharmacologic
treatments for dissociative disorders,
nor any specifically for DDD. 

CONCLUSION

A wide variety of dissociative
disorders, including DDD, occurs in
the psychiatric population and may be
misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed for a
variety of reasons. Some psychiatrists
may believe that dissociative disorders
are extremely rare and some may
believe that they do not exist. More
research is needed, but these disorders
may be more common than previously
thought. Psychotherapy is the
cornerstone of a multidisciplinary
treatment plan for DDD and other
trauma-related disorders, and it must
be the core interventional strategy; the
mode of psychotherapy should be
based on the individual’s needs and
may include some combination of
various approaches based on the
quality and acuity of the patient’s
symptoms.  

Future research should examine
dissociative processes to determine
how these responses change, such as
environmental precipitants, effects of
treatment interventions, and course of

illness. Additional research priorities
include the identification of
dissociative phenotypes that may help
guide treatment and the investigation
of biological processes underlying
dissociation before and after
treatment. In particular, it will be
important to study neurobiological
changes associated with treatment.
