Treatment- resistant schizophrenia characterised by 
dopamine supersensitivity psychosis and efficacy 
of asenapine

Nagara Takao, Toshiya Murai, Hironobu Fujiwara 

SUMMARY
Dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP) frequently 
arises with long- term antipsychotic treatment and 
accounts for a significant proportion of treatment- 
resistant schizophrenia. The mechanism underlying DSP 
is thought to be a compensatory increase in dopamine 
receptor density in the striatum caused by long- term 
antipsychotic treatment. Previous animal studies 
have reported that antipsychotics increase serotonin 
5- HT2A receptor density in the striatum and that 5- 
HT2A receptor blockers suppress dopamine- sensitive 
psychomotor activity, which may be linked to the 
pathophysiology of DSP. In this paper, we describe a 
patient who was hospitalised with treatment- resistant 
schizophrenia. Following treatment with high- dose 
antipsychotic polypharmacy for 10 weeks, the patient 
experienced worsening of psychotic and extrapyramidal 
symptoms. The patient was then started on second- 
generation antipsychotic asenapine while other 
antipsychotics were tapered off, resulting in improvement 
of these symptoms. Retrospectively, we presumed that 
the high- dose antipsychotic polypharmacy caused DSP, 
which was effectively treated by the potent 5- HT2A 
receptor antagonism of asenapine.

BACKGROUND
Antipsychotics play a crucial role in the treatment 
of  psychotic  disorders,  such  as  schizophrenia. 
However, 
their  administration  requires  close 
monitoring  because  of  their  potential  to  induce  a 
variety of adverse events, which include exacerba-
tion  of  psychotic  symptoms  and  side  effects,  such 
as  drug- induced  parkinsonism.  Of  note,  dopa-
mine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP) is thought to 
explain  the  phenomenon  in  which  patients  often 
relapse following slight dose reductions, discontin-
uation  or  switching  of  antipsychotics.  Chouinard 
et  al  estimated  that  50%  of  treatment- resistant 
schizophrenia cases are related to DSP.1 A possible 
mechanism  is  that  long- term  antipsychotic  treat-
ment causes a compensatory increase in dopamine 
receptor  density  in  the  striatum,  which  leads  to  a 
dopamine supersensitive state.2–5 Moreover, recent 
studies have shown that the prevalence rate of DSP 
in  patients  with  treatment- resistant  schizophrenia 
in Japan is as high as 70%.6 The differences in the 
proportions of patients with DSP may be explained 
by  the  common  use  of  high- dose  antipsychotic 
polypharmacy in Japan.5 7 From the perspective of 
treatment  strategies  for  DSP,  one  possible  molec-
ular  mechanism  involves  the  interaction  between 

dopaminergic  and  serotonergic  neurotransmis-
sion.  Previous  animal  studies  have  reported  that 
antipsychotics  increase  receptor  density  of  sero-
tonin  5- HT2A,  a  serotonergic  receptor  subtype, 
in  the  striatum  and  that  5- HT2A  receptor  antag-
onists  suppress  dopamine- sensitive  psychomotor 
activity,  which  may  be  linked  to  the  pathophysi-
ology  of  DSP.8  We  report  a  case  of  a  male  patient 
with schizophrenia, who developed DSP following 
high- dose  antipsychotic  polypharmacy.  Symptoms 
improved  following  treatment  with  asenapine,  an 
atypical antipsychotic that has high 5- HT2A antag-
onist binding potential.

CASE PRESENTATION
Mr  A,  a  single  man  aged  44  years,  suddenly  ran 
outdoors  13  years  earlier  with  the  belief  that  he 
was contacting his old friend telepathically. He was 
referred to our hospital that year and we observed 
symptoms  of  delusions,  hallucinations  and  castro-
phrenia.  His  previous  medical  history  included 
purulent  meningitis  in  infancy,  hyperlipidaemia, 
hyperuricaemia, hypertension and obesity.

TREATMENT
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-10 code 
F20.0) and started receiving antipsychotic therapy 
at our hospital. He was prescribed maximum doses 
of  risperidone,  olanzapine,  quetiapine  and  aripip-
razole at each previous hospitalisation because of a 
worsening of psychotic symptoms. These maximum 
doses were taken over to an outpatient setting and 
gradually  reduced  to  2 mg/day  of  risperidone  in 
the  last  year.  He  two  times  experienced  rebound 
psychosis  during  switching  of  antipsychotics,  13 
and 6 years earlier. The first episode occurred after 
switching 8 mg/day of risperidone to 20 mg/day of 
olanzapine and the second after switching 600 mg/
day  of  quetiapine  to  20 mg/day  of  olanzapine, 
during  which  oromandibular  dyskinetic  move-
ment  was  observed.  These  symptoms,  alongside 
a  history  of  high- dose  antipsychotic  medication, 
suggest DSP at an earlier period. His latest hospital 
admission was voluntary and was because of a slight 
irritation  (day  0).  Because  his  symptoms  were  not 
causing  significant  distress,  he  was  followed  up 
without any changes in prescription. However, on 
day  7,  he  developed  prominent  thought  disorder, 
delusions  of  being  injured  by  broken  glass  and  a 
variety of visual and auditory hallucinations. There-
fore, risperidone was increased to 8 mg/day for the 
following 2 weeks, and quetiapine was initiated at

Figure 1  Reinforcement and replacement of antipsychotic medication worsened psychotic symptoms. Starting asenapine and tapering off other 
antipsychotics resulted in improvement of psychotic and extrapyramidal symptoms. ASP,asenapine; BRX, brexpiprazole; OLZ, olanzapine; QTP, 
quetiapine; RIS,risperidone.

200 mg/day  (day  17)  and  slowly  increased  to  600 mg/day  over 
the  next  2  weeks,  with  an  expectation  of  anxiolytic  and  seda-
tive  drug  effects.  However,  the  patients  showed  inadequate 
response  to  these  medications.  From  day  28,  risperidone  was 
gradually  replaced  with  olanzapine,  and  at  day  50,  olanzapine 
was  increased  to  30 mg/day.  Despite  temporary  symptomatic 
improvement,  we  observed  further  aggravation  of  psychotic 
symptoms  when  chlorpromazine  equivalence  reached  1850 mg 
(day  59).  During  the  course  of  the  abovementioned  antipsy-
chotic  medication  reinforcement  and  replacement  (figure  1), 
he developed extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) of akathisia and 
stuttering;  the  latter  was  suspected  to  be  a  tardive  dyskinetic 
movement of the tongue. Given the risk of metabolic side effects 
and the inadequate sedative effect, quetiapine was tapered and 
discontinued,  while  brexpiprazole  was  gradually  increased 
to  4 mg;  however,  the  patient  experienced  no  symptomatic 
improvement.  We  considered  using  clozapine  because  the 
patient met the definition of treatment- resistant schizophrenia, 
and  evidence  has  suggested  that  clozapine  is  the  treatment  of 
choice  for  treatment- resistant  schizophrenia.9–11  However,  the 
patient’s mother did not agree to the administration of clozapine 
because of fear of side effects, such as agranulocytosis. Finally, 
he was treated with asenapine, which was initiated at 10 mg/day 
(day 84) and increased to 20 mg/day (day 93). Olanzapine and 
brexpiprazole were tapered and discontinued.

OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
Four  weeks  of  treatment  of  20 mg/day  of  asenapine  resulted 
in  gradual  improvement  of  psychotic  symptoms  and  EPS.  He 
subsequently  willingly  participated  in  an  occupational  therapy 
programme and was discharged on day 229.

DISCUSSION
In  our  patient,  increasing  antipsychotics  worsened  psychotic 
symptoms, which was against our expectations. He fulfilled the 
clinical  characteristics  of  DSP,  as  reported  by  Chouinard  et  al, 
which are (1) improvement in acute psychotic symptoms, at least 
initially, by increasing antipsychotic dose, (2) at least 3 months of 
cumulative exposure to antipsychotics, (3) tolerance to antipsy-
chotic effects, (4) rapid relapse following drug discontinuation, 
dose reduction or switching of antipsychotics, (5) worsening of 
psychotic symptoms with life stressors, such as minor life events 
or daily hassles, (6) appearance of new or more severe psychotic 
symptoms, (7) treatment resistance and (8) movement disorders, 
such as tardive dyskinesia.5 12 These symptoms were all observed 
during  the  most  recent  hospitalisation.  However,  his  previous 

experiences of rebound psychosis and oromandibular dyskinetic 
movement  during  switching  of  antipsychotics  suggest  that  he 
had developed DSP during an earlier period.

We question whether a period of 4 weeks for improvement of 
the established DSP state with asenapine was too short. A ther-
apeutic course of several months is usually suggested for clinical 
cases of treatment- resistant schizophrenia with DSP.13 However, 
an  animal  study  demonstrated  rapid  (within  minutes  to  an 
hour)  suppression  of  DSP- like  activity  using  a  5- HT2A  antag-
onist,8  which  corresponds  to  several  hours  in  humans.14  This 
may  explain  the  rapid  therapeutic  effect  induced  by  the  agent 
in  our  patient.  In  light  of  this,  it  is  possible  that  improvement 
of an established DSP state can be achieved within several days 
or weeks.

Several human studies have demonstrated that the underlying 
mechanism of DSP is a compensatory increase in dopamine D2 
receptor  density  in  the  striatum  caused  by  long- term  adminis-
tration of antipsychotics.4 5 Both lower and higher antipsychotic 
doses have been shown to induce dopamine supersensitive states 
in animal studies, but only the higher dose increased the number 
of striatal D2 receptors.3 15 Moreover, the relationship between 
DSP and 5- HT2A receptor function has also been demonstrated 
in  an  animal  study  that  showed  that  chronic  exposure  to  anti-
psychotic  medications  increases  amphetamine- induced  loco-
motion  relative  to  antipsychotic- naïve  rats,  which  is  indicative 
of  a  dopamine  supersensitive  state.  In  contrast,  ritanserin  and 
MDL100,907,  both  5- HT2A  receptor  antagonists,  suppress 
locomotion  in  antipsychotic- treated  rats.  Additionally,  halo-
peridol  was  shown  to  decrease  5- HT2A  receptor  density  in 
the prelimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens core and increase 
5- HT2A  receptor  density  in  the  caudate–putamen.8  It  should 
also  be  noted  that  asenapine  exhibits  the  highest  affinity  for 
5- HT2A  receptors  within  second- generation  antipsychotics.16 
Given these findings, it is possible that, in our patient, DSP was 
induced  by  high- dose  antipsychotic  polypharmacy,  and  dopa-
mine sensitivity was reduced by 5- HT2A receptor blockade by 
asenapine. To date, there has only been one report that suggested 
a  positive  effect  of  asenapine  on  DSP,  which  was  in  a  patient 
with delusional disorder whose DSP was thought to have been 
induced by ziprasidone.17

Other than the action on the 5- HT2A system, there are other 
antipsychotics  profiles  of  note  that  are  closely  related  to  DSP: 
half- life  period,  affinity  to  dopamine  D2  receptors  and  dopa-
mine partial agonists. First, the instability of drug blood levels 
accounts  for  the  instability  of  psychiatric  symptoms.5  Long 
half- life  period,  sustained  release  or  long- acting  injectable

antipsychotics are considered to be effective for preventing DSP 
because of the stability of blood drug levels.18 Half- life periods 
of representative antipsychotics are 20 hours for risperidone,19 
7 hours  for  quetiapine,20  33  hours  for  olanzapine,21  91  hours 
for brexpiprazole22 and 24 hours for asenapine.23 Asenapine has 
the  advantage  of  a  longer  half- life  period  than  that  of  risper-
idone  or  quetiapine.  Second,  antipsychotics  that  have  higher 
affinity to dopamine D2 receptors are presumed to be effective 
in the treatment of DSP.24 Asenapine has higher affinity to dopa-
mine D2 receptors than that of risperidone, quetiapine or olan-
zapine.11 25–27 Finally, according to animal studies, a dopamine 
partial  agonist  is  likely  to  be  effective  for  DSP.28  29  However, 
they  may  exacerbate  psychotic  symptoms  in  cases  where  DSP 
has already developed.30 This would explain why brexpiprazole, 
which is a dopamine partial agonist, was ineffective in our case.
In conclusion, this case presents an important clinical implica-
tion for use of antipsychotic agents. Both long- term use as well 
as high- dose polypharmacy of antipsychotics should be avoided 
as much as possible because of their potential to cause DSP due 
to  increases  in  D2  receptor  density  and  changes  in  5- HT2A 
receptor  density  across  various  brain  regions.  Antipsychotics 
with strong 5- HT2A antagonism may be effective for the treat-
ment of DSP.

Learning points

 ► This case presents an important clinical implication for the 

use of antipsychotic agents.

 ► Both long- term use and high- dose polypharmacy of 

antipsychotics should be avoided as much as possible 
because they may cause dopamine supersensitivity psychosis 
(DSP).

 ► Antipsychotics with potent 5- HT2A antagonism may be 

effective for DSP.
