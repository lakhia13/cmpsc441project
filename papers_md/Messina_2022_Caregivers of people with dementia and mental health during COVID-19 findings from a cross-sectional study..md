Abstract 
Background:  There is sparse evidence on the impact on vulnerable populations of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
aim of our study was to explore burden and mental wellbeing (including depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) 
in caregivers of people with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy and southern Switzerland, two 
bordering regions severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods:  We conducted an online cross-sectional survey with family carers of people with dementia between May 
and June 2020. We registered socio-demographic characteristics, and information about the relationship with the 
care recipient, dementia subtype, care inputs from others, and the need of care of the person with dementia. We 
measured caregiver burden with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), psychological distress with the Depression, Anxiety 
and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and perceived isolation with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLALS3).

Results:  Caregivers (N

Conclusions:  We found that caregivers’ burden, anxiety symptoms, depression and perceived loneliness were 
marked during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in two severely hit bordering countries. Regional differences 
in the impact of the epidemic on caregivers could be due to contextual, societal, and cultural circumstances. As the 
pandemic endures, support to caregivers of people with dementia should be proportionate and tailored to needs 
and adapted to contextual factors.

Introduction
Dementia influences those who are affected and the fam-
ily  members  who  very  often  care  for  their  relatives  at 
home  [1].  Friends  and  relatives  who  provide  non-  pro-
fessional and un-paid care to help a person, usually with 
long-term  needs  are  defined  as  “informal  carers”  [2].

In  2019,  according  to  the  World  Health  Organization 
(WHO), informal caregivers worldwide spent over 89 bil-
lion  hours  assisting  a  family  member  with  dementia  in 
basic personal activities of daily living, with women con-
tributing to 70% of global hours of care [3]. Informal care 
provision  generally  reflects  more  factors,  from  the  scar-
city or lack of resources and formal support services for 
people with dementia, to social and cultural expectations 
that  family  members,  especially  women,  have  the  obli-
gation to take care of a relative in need [4]. Even if there

is evidence that caring duties can also lead to a sense of 
personal  accomplishment  and  gratification  [5],  many 
informal  caregivers  deal  with  social,  financial,  and  psy-
chological strain that increases the likelihood of develop-
ing mental and physical distress [6].

Indeed,  literature  shows  that  caring  for  someone  with 
dementia is associated with feelings of burden perceived 
stress,  depression,  loneliness,  poorer  immune  function, 
and  cognitive  decline  [7–10].  The  COVID-19  pandemic 
brought  new  challenges  to  caregivers.  Worldwide,  gov-
ernments  enforced  restrictions  measures  such  as  physi-
cal distancing, stay at home orders and travel restrictions 
that often limited the access to health-care facilities and 
caregivers support interventions such as respite services 
[3].  The  disruption  or  abrupt  suspension  of  social  and 
medical  support  forced  informal  caregivers  to  take  over 
multiple and additional responsibilities to meet the needs 
of the person with dementia [11]. In addition, since older 
age and premorbid conditions represent a risk factor for 
COVID 19 mortality [12], caregivers felt additional pres-
sure  to  protect  themselves  from  infection  to  prevent 
transmission  to  the  person  they  cared  for  [13].  Taken 
together, all the changes imposed by the pandemic have 
likely  exacerbated  already  taxing  caring  conditions  and 
may have contributed to increase and worsen psychologi-
cal distress of caregivers, potentially in the long term.

Longitudinal studies [14, 15] suggest that the impact on 
mental  health  on  the  general  population  varies  through 
the  waves  and  various  phases  of  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic,  from  outbreaks  to  relapses  of  mitigation  public 
health  measures,  with  marked  geographic  variations. 
However, there is scant evidence about caregivers’ mental 
health during the pandemic, particularly during the first 
wave  of  the  outbreak  and  lockdown  periods.  Moreover, 
evidence on cross-country comparisons in psychological 
distress  of  caregivers  is  extremely  thin  [16],  and  inexist-
ent  from  northern  Italy  and  southern  Switzerland,  two 
regions  that  were  very  severely  hit  during  the  first  pan-
demic  outbreak.  In  addition,  most  of  the  few  available 
studies  on  dementia  caregivers  during  the  pandemic, 
focused  only  on  some  psychological  outcomes,  mainly 
stress  or  caregiver  burden  [17–20]  and  varied  in  meth-
ods;  psychological  distress  was  often  not  measured 
using  previously  validated  scales  [21–23].  It  is  indispen-
sable  to  expand  and  advance  the  current  knowledge  on 
the impact of the pandemic on caregivers of people with 
dementia  to  inform  the  design  and  provision  of  appro-
priate  measures  and  interventions  aimed  at  supporting 
this vulnerable population for the current and in view of 
future pandemic crises.

We  conducted  a  cross-sectional  survey  in  Italian 
and  Swiss  informal  caregivers  of  people  with  demen-
tia  during  the  first  wave  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic 

(May- June 2020). We aimed to explore levels of burden, 
depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, and perception of 
loneliness in caregivers of people with dementia during 
the first peak of the pandemic, in two hardly hit border-
ing countries, where preventive public health measures, 
including  personal  limitations  and  home  confinement 
were  strictly  enforced.  Public  health  preventive  meas-
ures  varied  in  the  two  countries,  but  according  to  the 
Oxford University’s stringency index were almost iden-
tical at the time of data collection of the present study 
[24].

Methods
Study participants and procedures

We  conducted  an  online  cross-sectional  survey  in  fam-
ily caregivers of people with dementia in two bordering, 
Italian-speaking  regions:  Italy  and  southern  Switzer-
land.  We  used  snowball  technique  to  recruit  a  conveni-
ent sample of both Italian and Swiss informal caregivers 
by  advertising  our  research  via  three  different  channels. 
An  invitation  message  was  prepared  and  circulated 
in  32  social  media  pages  on  Facebook  and  Instagram 
related to ageing and/or dementia and Facebook private 
groups  of  informal  caregivers,  and  through  53  day-care 
centres  for  people  with  dementia  in  the  two  regions. 
Inclusion criteria were being 18 years of age or older, Ital-
ian-speaker, and informal (i.e. non professional) caregiver 
of a non-institutionalized family member with previously 
diagnosed dementia. Participants were excluded from the 
study if they did not match all inclusion criteria.

The  online  survey,  implemented  in  RedCap  (Research 
Electronic  Data  Capture),  was  active  between  May   25th, 
2020 and June  25th, 2020. The estimated compilation time 
was  15  minutes.  All  participants  received  an  informed 
consent  to  participate  prior  to  filling  out  the  survey, 
online. All methods were performed in accordance with 
the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Measures
Sociodemographic variables

We  collected  socio-demographic  data  of  caregivers, 
including age, gender, place of residence, level of educa-
tion,  and  work.  We  also  asked  carers  about  their  rela-
tionship  with  the  person  with  dementia,  and  inquired 
whether  care  provision  was  their  only  occupation,  and 
if  they  received  any  care  inputs  from  other  formal  or 
informal  caregiver.  Information  about  the  care  recipient 
elicited from the carers included the clinically diagnosed 
dementia  subtype  and  level  of  autonomy  in  activities  of 
daily living. All questions were asked and data collected 
in Italian.

Psychological measures

All psychological measures were already available in Ital-
ian, were previously validated, and have been extensively 
used in Italian.

We  used  three  main  standardized  questionnaires.  The 
Italian  version  of  the  Zarit  Burden  Interview  (ZBI)  [25] 
to  assess  the  level  of  caregiver  burden.  For  each  of  the 
22  items,  respondents  reported  their  perceived  strain 
associated to the provision of care on a Likert scale rang-
ing  between  zero  (never)  and  four  (nearly  always).  We 
computed  total  scores  and  applied  standard  cut-offs  of 
low (<21), mild to moderate (21 ≤ x ≤ 40), moderate to 
severe (41 ≤ x ≤ 60), and severe burden (>60) [26]. The 
Italian  short  version  of  the  Depression,  Anxiety  and 
Stress Scale (I-DASS-21) [27], to assess the mental health 
of caregivers. DASS-21 is commonly used to assess nega-
tive emotions in community samples, including in infor-
mal  caregivers  [28].  We  changed  and  extended,  from 
the  original  questionnaire  delivery,  the  time  reference 
of the items from “the past week” to “the past months of 
COVID-19  outbreak”.  Respondents  reported  frequency 
of  symptoms  on  a  four-point  Likert  scale  (never;  some-
times;  often;  and  almost  always),  and  we  calculated  the 
separate  scores  of  depressive,  anxiety  and  stress-related 
symptoms  (mild;  moderate;  severe;  extremely  severe) 
according  to  standard  cut-offs  [29].  Finally,  we  explored 
the frequency (hardly never; some of the time; often) of 
feelings  of  loneliness  during  the  COVID-19  outbreak  in 
the region, with the three items (lack of companionship, 
exclusion,  and  isolation)  Italian  version  of  the  UCLA 
Loneliness scale (UCLALS3) [30, 31]. This scale has been 
previously  used  in  population-based  studies  to  measure 
social  isolation,  including  in  caregivers  of  people  with 
dementia [32], and during the COVID-19 pandemic [33] 
. We asked participants to answer the items referring to 
the  past  months  of  COVID-19  outbreak.  We  computed 
an  overall  loneliness  score,  which  ranged  from  three  to 
nine,  with  higher  scores  indicating  higher  perception  of 
loneliness.

Statistical analyses

We computed means and proportions for descriptive sta-
tistics  of  the  sociodemographic  variables,  Chi  squared 
tests  for  all  socio-demographic  variables,  and  the  main 
scales. We tested assumptions of normality and linearity, 
and  we  calculated  correlations  between  the  psychologi-
cal distress measures, education, and years of caregiving 
experience  using  Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  and 
univariate  and  multivariate  ANOVA  regressions,  setting 
statistical  significance  at  0.05.  We  assessed  differences 
in  ZBI,  DASS-21,  and  UCLALS3  scores  by  country  and 
independent 
sociodemographic  characteristics  using 

samples  t-test.  Finally,  in  a  set  of  sensitivity  analysis  we 
ran  linear  regressions  to  model  the  effect  of  study  site 
(i.e.  Switzerland/  Italy)  separately  on  each  of  the  psy-
chological  distress  scores  adjusting  for  relevant  socio-
demographic  and  care  characteristics.  We  used  SPSS 
25.0  statistical  software  for  Windows  for  all  statistical 
analyses.

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics

Of  the  646  caregivers  contacted,  571  completed  the 
survey  and  formed  the  analytic  sample  (response  rate 
87%).  Table  1  shows  the  sociodemographic  characteris-
tics  of  the  overall  study  sample,  and  by  country.  Of  the 
571 caregivers, 425 were Italian (74.4%) and 146 (25.6%) 
were  Swiss,  with  a  mean  age  of  53  years  (SD=11.99) 
and a range of 24 to 89. The majority of caregivers were 
female  (81.6%),  and  the  mean  number  of  years  spent  in 
caregiving was 6 (SD=3.95). Most participants cared for 
a family member affected by Alzheimer’s Disease (55.3%), 
followed  by  Vascular  (16.6%),  Parkinson’s  (12.6%),  Fron-
totemporal dementia (7.7%), Lewy-Body dementia (3.3%), 
and other or unspecified types of dementia (4.5%). Most 
caregivers  were  children  (71.8%),  or  spouse  of  the  per-
son with dementia (20.7%) and referred to care for a per-
son not autonomous in most daily life activities (79.9%). 
Almost  two  thirds  of  participants  admitted  getting  help 
from others in caring (58.7%), especially from other fam-
ily members (32.2%) or professional carers (22.8%). More 
than  half  of  participants  had  at  least  higher  secondary 
education (56.4%), and almost half of the caregivers were 
employed with a full time or part-time job (49.6%).

Psychological measures

Overall,  caregivers  had  a  mean  Zarit  burden  score 
of  54.3  (SD=18.3),  which  corresponds  to  “moderate 
to  severe”.  Mean  scores  from  DASS-21  showed  mild 
depression  (mean=11.79;  SD=6.12),  moderate  anxiety 
(mean=10.04;  SD=6.93),  and  mild  stress  (mean=12.95; 
SD=5.53), according to standard cut-offs [29]. However, 
the severity of reported symptoms was more pronounced 
for anxiety, intermediate for depression, and less marked 
for  stress  (Fig.  1).  According  to  past  categorizations  of 
the UCLALS3 scale [34], 72.3% of caregivers fell into the 
‘lonely’ category, 99.3% among Swiss and 63.1% in Italian 
caregivers.

All psychological variables were positively correlated 
to  each  other   (r2  values  ranging  from  0.59  to  0.85,  all 
p  values  <0.001)  (Table  2).  Correlations  did  not  vary 
between countries and are presented for the full sample. 
More  specifically,  multiple  linear  regressions  showed 
that  stress  were  significantly  associated  with  depres-
sion  levels  (β=0.52;  p<0.001)  and  burden  (β=0.43;

Independent t-test showed that all psychological symp-
toms were more pervasive in Swiss caregivers with higher 
scores for burden depression, stress, anxiety, and loneli-
ness  than  the  Italian  counterparts  (all  p  values  <  0.001) 
(Table 3).

The  linear  regression  models  of  the  effect  of  coun-
try  of  residence  on  the  psychological  distress  measures 
confirmed  that  anxiety,  depression,  stress,  and  burden 
were,  respectively,  55%  (β=0.547),  44%  (β=0.438),  42% 
(β=0.418),  and  52%  (β=0.517)  higher  in  Switzerland 
compared to Italy (all p values < 0.001). All associations 
remained  significant  also  after  we  adjusted  for  relevant 
covariates (all p values < 0.001).

We  also  found  significant  differences  for  social  sup-
port,  with  caregivers  who  got  help  from  others  show-
ing  lower  levels  of  burden  (mean=49.27;  SD=16.41), 

loneliness 
SD=6.02), 
(mean=10.66; 
depression 
(mean=6.34;  SD=2.08)  and  anxiety 
(mean=8.65;

alone  (mean=13.40;  SD=5.89);  (mean=7.39;  SD=1.85); 
(mean=12.02; SD=6.84) (all p values < 0.001). Similarly, 
spouses’ caregivers reported significantly higher scores in 
all psychological outcomes than children caregivers (all p 
values < 0.001).

Discussion
Our  study  aimed  to  explore  psychological  distress  in

other,  and  were  more  pervasive  in  Swiss  compared  to 
Italian  caregivers,  and  in  spouse  compared  to  children 
caregivers.  Education,  employment  status  and  social 
support  were  inversely  associated  with  psychological 
distress.

Previous  evidence  suggested  that  providing  care  for 
a  person  with  dementia  can  cause  strain  and  can  affect 
both  the  psychological  and  physical  health  of  the  carer 
[8]. Caregivers generally report higher levels of perceived 
stress,  depression,  loneliness,  burden  and  lower  levels 
of  self-efficacy  and  well-being  compared  to  the  general 
population  [7].  Our  results  on  the  inverse  association 
between  educational  level,  social  support,  employment 
status,  and  psychological  distress  are  consistent  with 
those of pre-pandemic studies [35]. Nevertheless, disrup-
tion  of  healthcare  facilities  and  social  restriction  meas-
ures imposed by the pandemic altered care routines and 
practices,  with  plausible  detrimental  consequences  on 
caregivers’ physical and mental health [11]. Direct com-
parisons  with  literature  are  not  straightforward  because 
few  studies  have  been  conducted  on  caregivers  of  peo-
ple  with  dementia  since  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic, 
and  in  particular  during  the  lockdown,  in  spring  2020 
[36]. However, previous studies [37–39] found that high 
variations in social support services were associated with 
increased  levels  of  anxiety,  burden,  and  depression  in 
samples of caregivers from Italy and the UK respectively.
We found some variations in the reported psychologi-
cal  symptoms.  While  severe  levels  of  reported  burden 
and anxiety were common, more than half of the caregiv-
ers  in  our  sample  reported  only  mild  to  moderate  lev-
els  of  stress  and  depressive  symptoms.  The  COVID-19 

pandemic may affect caregivers’ mental health on multi-
ple levels. The disruption of health care services may led 
to  a  sudden  and  unexpected  increase  in  responsibility. 
Caregivers had to provide more types of care inputs and 
for longer hours, with a consequent lower sense of com-
petence and mastery [40], which in turn are associated to 
a greater experience of burden [41]. Suspension of respite 
care  and  breaks  may  have  altered  coping  mechanisms 
and pre-pandemic recover opportunities, contributing to 
“chronic stressor felt by caregiver with respect to physical 
and  emotional  well-being,  family  relations  and  financial 
status”  [42],  rather  than  the  more  transitory  experience 
of stress to which caregivers can adapt over time. In addi-
tion, fear of infecting a loved one can trigger worry and 
anxiety [43]. Moreover, the uncertainties about infection 
risks  and  the  very  limited  knowledge  about  COVID-19, 
especially  during  the  first  wave  of  the  pandemic,  were 
likely  responsible  of  increases  in  cognitive  alertness, 
which  may  shadow  or  counterbalance  depressive  symp-
toms or their perception. Indeed, depression rates in the 
general  population  increased  during  the  second  wave 
of  the  pandemic  compared  to  the  first  wave,  probably 
because of the prolonged psychological distress and long-
term social dislocations [44].

In  our  study,  we  also  focused  on  perceived  loneliness. 
We  found  that  most  caregivers  reported  to  feel  lonely. 
This  may  be  explained  by  the  almost  complete  lack  of 
social  interactions  imposed  by  restriction  measures, 
which was abrupt and unprecedented. The reported feel-
ing of being alone and trapped at home with few external 
support was probably consequent to an actual condition 
of  forced  confinement  [45].  These  findings  suggest  that

caregivers  of  people  with  dementia  are  likely  vulnerable 
to  lockdown  and  social  restriction  measures,  and  could 
suffer  remarkable  loneliness,  which  may  compromise 
their  ability  to  provide  care  [46].  Next,  psychological 
measures  correlated  to  each  other,  correlations  between 
depression  and  anxiety  were  particularly  strong,  and 
with higher scores in reported anxiety, predicting higher 
scores in depression and vice versa. Since a third of our 
sample  reported  from  severe  to  extremely  severe  levels 
of anxiety, there is a concrete risk of increasing levels of 
depression in caregivers as the pandemic endures.

We investigated mental health in caregivers during the 
pandemic in two different countries and Swiss caregivers 
reported significantly higher distress in all mental health 
outcomes  than  their  Italian  counterparts  did.  During 
the  first  wave,  the  Italian  Government  adopted  slightly 
stricter public health measures to contain the pandemic 
compared  to  the  Swiss  Confederation  [24].  The  extent 
to  which  and  potential  causal  role  of  preventive  meas-
ures  on  caregivers’  mental  health  are  not  easy  to  disen-
tangle. However, the variation in the timing and severity 
of the restriction measures adopted in the two countries 
may have contributed, at least to some extent, to explain 
the  differences  we  found  between  Swiss  and  Italian  car-
egivers. The presence of prompt preventive measures to 
reduce the risk of infection, especially for the elderly and 
vulnerable  populations,  may  have  contributed  to  lessen 
the anxiety and fear of contagion in Italian caregivers of 
people  with  dementia.  On  the  other  hand,  the  latency 
and  minor  severity  of  restrictions  adopted  by  the  Swiss 
Federal  Council  may  have  triggered  a  sense  of  personal 
unsafety  for  both  the  caregiver  and  the  care-recipient. 
Nonetheless,  other  socio-cultural  and  contextual  factors 
may  contribute  to  explain  the  fact  that  Swiss  caregivers 
reported significantly higher distress in all mental health 
outcomes than Italian carers did. Evidence suggests that 
social support is a protective factor towards burden and 
psychological  distress  in  dementia  caregivers  [47,  48]. 
Since  in  our  study  Italian  caregivers  reported  to  receive 
more  help  in  caring  duties  compared  to  Swiss  caregiv-
ers  (Table  1),  the  differences  in  use  and  availability  of 
emotional  and  practical  forms  of  support  during  the 
pandemic  may  lead  the  burden  due  to  the  disruption  of 
services  and  the  additional  care  responsibilities.  A  fur-
ther  investigation  on  specific  restrictive  measures  and 
services  available  during  the  lockdown  for  caregivers  of 
people  with  dementia  in  the  two  different  countries  is 
needed to clarify the differences.

The  present  study  is  not  free  from  limitations.  The 
lack  of  longitudinal  or  pre-pandemic  data  on  the  bur-
den,  mental  health,  and  loneliness  of  caregivers  limits 
causal inference. However, we found exceptionally high 
levels  of  burden  and  psychological  distress  according 

to  commonly  used  and  standardized  scales.  Further, 
although  the  sample  of  our  study  was  large  it  was  not 
representative  of  the  target  population.  We  cannot 
exclude selection bias also because only caregivers who 
had access to the internet and to our recruitment chan-
nels  could  participate  in  the  survey.  Nevertheless,  the 
study  population  had  a  broad  sociodemographic  spec-
trum, which provides support at least to some extent to 
the  external  validity  of  our  results.  We  measured  psy-
chological  distress  using  robust  and  valid  measures, 
and  participants  self-reported  a  wide  range  of  their 
socio-demographic  and  care  characteristics.  However, 
people  with  dementia  were  less  thoroughly  charac-
terised.  We  did  not  measure  behavioural  and  psycho-
logical  symptoms  of  dementia  (BPSD),  and  we  used  a 
binary question to measure autonomy and not a stand-
ard  measure  of  activities  of  daily  living  (ADL).  BPSD 
and  ADL  impairments  are  associated  with  strain  and 
psychological  distress  in  caregivers  [49,  50],  and  may 
have  worsened  because  of  self-sheltering,  quarantine, 
and other personal and social restrictive measures [51].
Our  results  confirmed  that  people  with  dementia 
and their caregivers have faced serious challenges dur-
ing  the  pandemic.  Local  authorities  must  consider, 
locally adapt, and apply the recommendations of issued 
by  the  Tecnhical  Advisory  Board  on  Mental  Health  in 
the  WHO  European  region  to  reduce  the  impact  of 
COVID-19 crisis on mental health in vulnerable popu-
lations [52].

Conclusions
The present study showed that family caregivers of peo-
ple  with  dementia  have  experienced  psychological  dis-
tress during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Since 
we  found  severe  feelings  of  burden  and  anxiety,  rapid 
and  targeted  measures  are  required  to  enable  carers  to 
continue  provide  care  and  cope  with  uncertainty,  while 
maintaining  their  own  well-being.  Further  interventions 
should address feelings of loneliness accounting for con-
textual and cultural circumstances.
