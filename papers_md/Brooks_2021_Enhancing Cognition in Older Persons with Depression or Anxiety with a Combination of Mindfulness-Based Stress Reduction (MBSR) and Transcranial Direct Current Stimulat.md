Abstract
Objectives  Individuals with subjective memory complaints and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety are at high risk for 
further cognitive decline, and possible progression to dementia. Low-burden interventions to help slow or prevent cognitive 
decline in this high-risk group are needed. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of combining Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to increase putative benefits of MBSR 
for cognitive function and everyday mindfulness in depressed or anxious older adults with subjective cognitive decline.
Methods  We conducted a two-site pilot double-blind randomized sham-controlled trial, combining active MBSR with 
either active or sham tDCS. The intervention included weekly in-class group sessions at the local university hospital and 
daily at-home practice. Anodal tDCS was applied for 30 min during MBSR meditative practice, both in-class and at-home.
Results  Twenty-six individuals with subjective cognitive complaints and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety were ran-
domized to active (n = 12) or sham tDCS (n = 14). The combination of MBSR and tDCS was safe and well tolerated, though 
at-home adherence and in-class attendance were variable. While they were not statistically significant, the largest effect sizes 
for active vs. sham tDCS were for everyday mindfulness (d = 0.6) and social functioning (d = 0.9) (F(1,21) = 3.68, p = 0.07 
and F(1,21) = 3.9, p = 0.06, respectively).
Conclusions  Our findings suggest that it is feasible and safe to combine tDCS with MBSR in older depressed and anxious 
adults, including during remote, at-home use. Furthermore, tDCS may enhance MBSR via transferring its meditative learn-
ing and practice into increases in everyday mindfulness. Future studies need to improve adherence to MBSR with tDCS.

2011; Slavin et al., 2010). Older adults with subjective cog-
nitive complaints are at an increased risk of progression 
to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (Mitch-
ell et al., 2014; Vilalta‐Franch et al., 2013). There is also a 
robust association of depression and anxiety with cognitive 
decline (Bierman et al., 2005; Donovan et al., 2017; John-
son et al., 2015). Older adults with symptoms of depression 
have poorer objective global cognition (Seo et al., 2017). 
Conversely,  subjective  memory  complaints  can  lead  to 
depressive symptoms (Bhang et al., 2020). Taken together, 
these  data  demonstrate  that  older  adults  with  cognitive 
complaints and mood or anxiety symptoms are at higher

risk for cognitive decline, disability, and poor quality of life 
(Johnson et al., 2013; Roehr et al., 2017). As the older adult 
population continues to rapidly grow, a number of them may 
develop both memory difficulties and mood-related prob-
lems, which could cause a burden on their caregivers and 
the healthcare system. Older adults with memory complaints 
and mood symptoms comprise an important high-risk group 
for significant cognitive decline.

There are no evidence-based interventions for older 
adults that target cognitive difficulties in the context of 
depression or anxiety, although some recent clinical trials 
have shown promise for antidepressants combined with 
pro-cognitive interventions (Lavretsky et al., 2020; Lenze 
et al., 2020; Reynolds et al., 2011). Such interventions are 
urgently needed, as they could improve cognitive func-
tion, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life, 
and prevent further cognitive decline (Lenze et al., 2018). 
An ideal intervention would be associated with minimal 
burden to the individual, their family, and the healthcare 
system (Shalev et al., 2020).

Mindfulness  is  defined  as  a  process  in  which  one 
deliberately pays attention to the present moment, non-
judgmentally, and merely accepting it with an open and 
inquisitive nature (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). It differs from typi-
cal attention or awareness in that it involves attending to 
the present moment and learning to accept one’s thoughts 
and feelings as “existing,” noting that they can or can-
not be true, instead of accepting these thoughts and feel-
ings as “facts” (Baer, 2003; Faucher et al., 2016). This 
allows for attention to be directed towards finding solu-
tions and methods of coping in situations perceived as 
stressful (Faucher et al., 2016). Mindfulness-Based Stress 
Reduction (MBSR (Kabat-Zinn, 1990)) is one of the most 
extensively researched and evaluated mindfulness-based 
interventions. MBSR is a group-based program focused 
on  the  systematic  teaching  of  the  conceptual  elements 
and practice of mindfulness to enhance psychological and 
emotional resilience. Key concepts of mindfulness are 
taught and practiced in weekly groups led by a trained 
mindfulness instructor over a 2-month period. The other 
aspect  of  MBSR  is  home  practice  of  mindfulness  via 
meditation, ideally daily. MBSR has received considerable 
attention in mental health because it can reduce depressive 
and anxiety symptoms (Gallegos et al., 2013; Lenze et al., 
2014; Moynihan et al., 2013; Wetherell et al., 2017) and 
improve cognitive function in older adults (Lenze et al., 
2014; Moynihan et al., 2013). Additionally, MBSR may 
improve the regulation of attention and affect and in some 
areas of executive functioning (Chambers et al., 2008; Jha 
et al., 2007). Thus, MBSR is a promising intervention for 
older adults with cognitive difficulties co-occurring with 
depression and anxiety, provided participants adhere to the 
in-class attendance and at-home practice.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has also been 
shown to improve cognition in older adults (Antonenko et al., 
2019; Fertonani et al., 2014; Meinzer et al., 2013, 2015). tDCS 
is a safe, non-invasive form of neurostimulation which delivers 
low levels of direct electrical current to targeted brain areas to 
modulate neuronal excitability and neuroplasticity (Fertonani 
et al., 2014). Typically, anodal stimulation depolarizes mem-
branes and increases cortical excitability (Nitsche & Paulus, 
2000). tDCS administered over the dorsolateral prefrontal cor-
tex (DLPFC) has been shown to improve working memory 
(Jones et al., 2015; Ruf et al., 2017) and word retrieval (Ferto-
nani et al., 2014) in older adults. Furthermore, the combina-
tion of working memory training and tDCS improved work-
ing memory performance beyond working memory training 
alone (Teo et al., 2011). Thus, by increasing neuronal plastic-
ity, tDCS may optimize cognitive enhancement from other 
behavioral interventions administered simultaneously (Hanley 
et al., 2020).

A substantial benefit of MBSR and tDCS is that they can be 
delivered remotely, which improves their reach and scalability. 
Fully remote capabilities of interventions have been brought to the 
forefront by the current COVID-19 pandemic (Nicol et al., 2020). 
MBSR classes are typically conducted in-person but in the wake 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, practitioners and research studies 
have moved MBSR to remote videoconference classes. Similarly, 
tDCS is the only neurostimulation treatment that requires no in-
person contact with practitioners. MBSR involves guided practice 
and meditation that can be done at home. With adequate train-
ing on the use of the device and electrode placement, adults can 
self-administer tDCS safely and successfully (Gough et al., 2020; 
Kasschau et al., 2016). Both MBSR and tDCS trigger positive 
effects with regard to mood symptoms and cognition, and can 
easily be delivered remotely. However, the feasibility of combin-
ing these two interventions in older adults has not been exam-
ined. Thus, we conducted a study to assess the feasibility, safety, 
and tolerability of combining MBSR and tDCS in older adults 
with subjective cognitive complaints. We also explored whether 
this combination preliminarily improves cognition, mindfulness, 
symptoms of depression and anxiety, and social participation. As 
both interventions are non-invasive and low-burden to partici-
pants, the findings of this study may support the use of MBSR and 
tDCS to prevent cognitive decline in community-dwelling older 
adults with little burden to the healthcare system.

Methods

We  conducted  a  randomized,  double-blind,  sham-con-
trolled trial of tDCS combined with MBSR in adults aged 
60 years or older with symptoms of depression or anxi-
ety plus subjective cognitive complaints in two academic

centers (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, 
ON, Canada; and Washington University in St. Louis, MO, 
USA). The study was approved by both institutional review 
boards, in which experiments were done in accordance 
with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. All participants 
provided written informed consent.

Participants were recruited between 27 June 2018 and 
6 March 2019. They completed an initial phone screen 
followed  by  an  in-person  screening  assessment,  which 
included a review of medical history and medications to 
determine eligibility. To be eligible, participants had to 
report cognitive complaints but have intact cognitive func-
tion as ascertained by a Short Blessed Test (Katzman et al., 
1983) score ≤ 10 and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA; (Nasreddine et al., 2005) score ≥ 25. Participants 
were included if their baseline PROMIS 8-item depression 
score was ≥ 16 or their baseline PROMIS 7-item anxiety 
score was ≥ 14, indicating moderate to severe symptoms.
Exclusion criteria included unstable medical illness 
(e.g.,  uncontrolled  diabetes  mellitus  or  hypertension), 
metal implants, significant neurological conditions (e.g. 
stroke, seizure disorders), use of cognitive enhancers (e.g., 
donepezil) within the past 6 weeks, use of anticonvul-
sants or antipsychotics (other than low-dose aripiprazole 
(≤ 2 mg) or low-dose gabapentin (≤ 100 mg) if prescribed 
for pain), concurrent cognitive training with brain training 
software, participation in psychotherapy, regular participa-
tion in mindfulness practice or yoga, IQ < 70 as estimated 
by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR (Wechsler, 
2001)), lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophre-
nia, schizoaffective disorder, or untreated post-traumatic 

stress disorder, or substance abuse within 6 months, as 
diagnosed  by  the  Mini-International  Neuropsychiatric 
Interview  (MINI  (Sheehan  et  al., 1998)).  Participants 
meeting all eligibility criteria completed baseline assess-
ments, which included self-report and neuropsychological 
assessments of outcomes, listed below.

Twenty-six participants were enrolled in the study: 14 
were randomized to sham tDCS (mean age = 69.2, SD = 4.6; 
nine  females,  five  males)  and  12  to  active  tDCS  (mean 
age = 68.2, SD = 5.9; nine females, three males). Demo-
graphic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics are presented 
in Table 1. There was a difference in gender between the 
two groups, such that the sham group included more males.

Procedure

All  participants  received  MBSR;  they  were  randomly 
assigned (1:1) to active or sham tDCS, using a permuted 
block approach to ensure treatment balance within each 
study site. Participants, MBSR instructors, and outcome 
raters were blinded to the tDCS condition (i.e., active vs. 
sham). Following the protocol of a large trial assessing the 
efficacy of combing tDCS with cognitive remediation in pre-
venting dementia among older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment or remitted depression (Rajji et al., 2020), active 
tDCS administration involved applying excitatory bilateral 
stimulation to the left and right DLPFC using Magstim/Neu-
ronika HDC-Kit devices. To achieve this bilateral stimula-
tion, the anode was placed at Fz and the cathode at Iz as 
per the 10–20 international electrode placement system (see 
Rajji et al., 2020 for electrode montage).

Rubber electrodes (5 × 5 cm) were inserted into saline-
soaked sponges (5 × 7 cm) and fixed in place using a mesh 
cap. The machine ramps up over the course of 30 s at the 
beginning of stimulation, and ramps down over 30 s at the 
end of stimulation in both active and sham groups. The tDCS 
was applied using a direct current of 2 mA (current density 
of 0.57 A/m2) for 30 min per day (Rajji et al., 2020) dur-
ing meditative practices of MBSR. The same parameters 
were used for sham stimulation, except the device shuts off 
after 3% of the active stimulation time, resulting in 54 s of 
active stimulation. This brief period of active stimulation is 
not known to produce active neurological effects, but does 
ensure blinding because it is associated with common side 
effects of active tDCS, such as tingling and itching under the 
electrodes (Dinn et al., 2017; Gandiga et al., 2006; Valiengo 
et al., 2020). For a full description of the tDCS parameters, 
please see Rajji et al. (2020).

Prior to the initiation of the intervention, all participants 
completed tDCS training provided at the local academic 
hospital using a group format. During five 1-h group ses-
sions provided over five consecutive days, participants were 
given an overview of the tDCS device and detailed instruc-
tions for administration, programming, resetting, electrode 
placement, and safety procedures (such as aborting sessions 
safely). They were also trained on how to troubleshoot tDCS 
problems, such as managing side effects, e.g., tingling and 
itching, and self-recording necessary data. At the end of 
training, participants were required to demonstrate their 
competency self-administering tDCS by passing an assess-
ment administered by the study coordinators. Throughout 
the tDCS training sessions and the intervention trial, partici-
pants had access to a training video detailing the procedures 
to guide them through tDCS setup and administration, as 
needed. A manual and coordinator contact information were 
also provided to each participant, and the study coordinator 
was available to troubleshoot over the phone during at-home 
tDCS sessions.

The MBSR training was based on the program developed 
by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Center for Mindfulness Univer-
sity of Massachusetts Medical School (Lenze et al., 2014; 
Wetherell et al., 2017). The in-class MBSR training was 
led by qualified MBSR instructors, and was conducted at 
the academic hospital using a group format over approxi-
mately 10 weeks; group sessions included an orientation 
session, 8 weekly 2.5-h classes, with a one half-day silent 
retreat between classes 6 and 7. This day involves a series 
of guided meditations and seamless mindfulness practice, 
and tDCS was applied for 30 min of the silent retreat. All 
participants were required to attend the MBSR in-person 
classes  and  instructed  to  refrain  from  discussing  tDCS 
treatment among themselves to protect blinding. Content 
included instruction in mindfulness meditation, mindful 
movements including hatha yoga and walking meditation, 

body scans, and discussion of home practices to enhance 
mindfulness in everyday life. Additionally, in-class specific 
exercises such as identifying pleasant, unpleasant, or neu-
tral thoughts, emotions, and body sensations are included. 
Poetry and teaching stories are sometimes used during class 
to connect participants emotionally. The qualified MBSR 
instructor aims to embody a mindfulness stance by the way 
by inquiring into participants’ experiences and conducting 
whole or small group discussions throughout the sessions 
(Dobkin et al., 2014).

At the end of each in-class session, the qualified MBSR 
instructor would give the group a structured 30 min MBSR 
activity (e.g., formal practice) and associated audio files to 
complete at home for the week. Participants were asked to 
complete daily tDCS at the same time as the formal practice. 
In addition, participants were given small informal mindful-
ness practices to try incorporating into their everyday lives 
whenever they could, such as mindful walking or mindful 
eating. The study used A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduc-
tion Workbook as a companion guide (Stahl et al., 2014). 
In summary, participants attended weekly in-class group 
MBSR plus tDCS sessions at the hospital, and then were 
asked to complete at least 30 min of guided MBSR and 
tDCS at home the other 6 days of the week.

Measures

Trained  research  staff  blinded  to  participants’  tDCS 
assignment performed pre- and post-intervention assess-
ments.  Post-intervention  assessments  were  performed 
within 2 weeks of completing the intervention. Feasibility 
was assessed by examining participants’ in-class attend-
ance  (i.e.,  number  of  in-person  MBSR  group  sessions 
attended) and adherence to at-home mindfulness prac-
tice while using tDCS. Participants completed self-report 
logs daily, detailing their at-home use of tDCS and the 
frequency  and  duration  of  MBSR  practice;  these  self-
report logs were reviewed by study staff weekly during 
the in-person group sessions, and were used to determine 
the at-home adherence rates. For an at-home session to 
be considered “complete,” participants must have com-
pleted 80% of either tDCS or MBSR, or both on a given 
day (e.g., at least 24 min of formal practice). This cutoff 
was determined based on MBSR guidelines which indi-
cate optimal adherence is attendance at least 8/10 classes; 
in addition, 80% is a traditional benchmark for adequate 
adherence  in  clinical  trials.  To  determine  the  at-home 
adherence rate, we first determined how many at-home 
sessions each participant completed by looking through 
their logs. We then calculated the total expected number 
of sessions that should have been completed at home over 
the period of the intervention. Lastly, we divided the total 
number of sessions each participant completed by the total 

1 3Mindfulness (2021) 12:3047–3059

3051

number of expected sessions to get a percentage of at-
home adherence.

Participants also documented daily any failures of the 
tDCS device during stimulation and any adverse events 
(AEs). Participants were told during the in-class training 
phase of tDCS, things that might constitute an AE, and 
were instructed to record any potential AEs in their at-home 
logs and inform a member of the study team. A member of 
the study team went through the recorded AEs during the 
weekly in-class MBSR sessions and determined their relat-
edness, severity, and duration, clarifying with participants 
as needed. AEs that required the discontinuation of tDCS 
or MBSR were identified, as were serious adverse events 
(SAEs)  defined  as  AEs  that  resulted  in  life-threatening 
health issues, hospitalization, or death.

The  main  cognitive  outcome  measure  was  the  Fluid 
Cognition Composite from the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery (Weintraub et al., 2013), 
a computer-based instrument measuring fluid cognition. In 
addition, immediate memory and delayed recall were meas-
ured using a standard 16-word list validated at the Washing-
ton University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center that is 
sensitive to change and does not have ceiling effects in pre-
liminary studies (Lenze et al., 2014; Wetherell et al., 2017). 
After the word list is read to the participant, the participant is 
asked to repeat as many words as they can remember, in any 
order. Following the initial recall trial, the list is repeated 
three more times (a total of four times), and after each repeti-
tion, the participant is asked to recall as many words as they 
can remember. After a 20-min delay, the participant is asked 
to recall as many words from the list as they can remember.
The Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale – Revised 
(CAMS-R (Feldman et al., 2005)) was used to measure the 
four  domains  of  mindfulness—attention,  present-focus, 
awareness, and acceptance. CAMS-R is a self-report meas-
ure of everyday mindfulness that is not specific to any one 
type of meditation. CAMS-R asks questions about translat-
ing and integrating the domains of mindfulness into eve-
ryday life, for example, being able to focus on the present 
moment, and keeping track of one’s thoughts and feelings. 
CAMS-R was administered pre- and post-intervention to 
determine how well participants integrated the teachings 
from  MBSR  into  their  everyday  lives.  The  Cronbach’s 
alpha for the CAMS-R at baseline was 0.72, which indicates 
acceptable internal consistency of the scale.

The  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Infor-
mation System (PROMIS) measures were used to assess 
depression and anxiety over the past 7 days (Cella et al., 
2010) including self-reported negative mood, views of self, 
social cognition, decreased positive affect, engagement, self-
reported fear, anxious misery, hyperarousal, and somatic 
symptoms related to arousal (Pilkonis et al., 2011). In addi-
tion to the PROMIS measures of depression and anxiety, 

the two following PROMIS measures were used to assess 
satisfaction with, and ability to perform usual social roles 
and activities: the 8-item short form v2.9 PROMIS Scale for 
Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities (Hahn et al., 
2010) and the 8-item short form v2.0 PROMIS Ability to 
Participate in Social Roles and Activities (Hahn et al., 2010).

Data Analyses

All data were analyzed using the Statistical Program for 
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 (SPSS, 2018). Extreme 
outliers (± 3 standard deviations) were removed for each 
time point. Data were visually inspected for normal distri-
bution and were checked statistically with the Shapiro–Wilk 
test. Chi-square and independent-samples t-tests were used 
to evaluate differences between the active and sham tDCS 
groups on baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive 
measures.

Measures of feasibility, tolerability, and safety were ana-
lyzed descriptively. While the primary goal of this pilot 
study was to assess feasibility, tolerability, and safety, pre-
liminary evaluations of changes in efficacy measures were 
performed using repeated-measures analyses of variance 
(RM-ANOVAs), with randomization as the between-subjects 
variable, and time point (pre- or post-intervention) as the 
within-subjects variable. For cognition, the three dependent 
variables were as follows: NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery 
Fluid Cognition Composite, total recall score of the word 
list, and the delayed recall score of the word list. The pre-
liminary effects of the intervention on subjective changes 
were explored with the following five dependent variables: 
CAMS-R, PROMIS depression scores, PROMIS anxiety 
scores, PROMIS satisfaction with social roles and activities, 
and PROMIS ability to participate in social roles and activi-
ties. For this pilot trial, a p < 0.05 was considered significant 
and no corrections were made for multiple comparisons.

Results

Evaluation of Feasibility: Adherence, Safety, 
and Tolerability

Two participants dropped out during the intervention, one 
each in the sham and active tDCS group, due to the time 
commitment of the study. One additional participant in the 
active group declined a follow-up assessment (Fig. 1). The 
mean at-home adherence rate of tDCS use during MBSR 
practice was 54% for both the active and sham tDCS groups. 
Of the 10 MBSR group sessions, participants in the sham 
group attended a mean (SD) = 6.9 (2.3) sessions; those in the 
active groups attended 7.2 (2.9) (Table 2).

There  were  no  SAEs  in  either  group.  Seven  of  the 
twelve participants in the active group reported an AE: 
six reported AEs possibly related to tDCS (i.e., redness, 
itching, tingling, or headaches associated with electrode 
placement and the first 30 s of active stimulation) and 
three reported AEs possibly related to tDCS or MBSR, 
including falling asleep during MBSR practice, worsening 

of depression, or dizziness (Table 2). Eight of the four-
teen participants in the sham group reported an AE: seven 
were possibly related to tDCS, and three reported AEs 
possibly  related  to  tDCS  or  MBSR,  including  falling

for the first few minutes of stimulation and, if needed, 
more  saline  (~ 1–2  mL,  as  needed)  was  added  to  the 
sponges to alleviate these sensations. The reported head-
aches typically lasted for the duration of stimulation, and 
in rare cases, for a few hours post-stimulation. In these 
cases, participants were advised to take pain medication 
(ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc.). The falling asleep and 
fogginess tended to last throughout the MBSR practice, 
and  participants  were  instructed  to  practice  sitting  up 
versus lying down. One participant in the active group 
reported worsening of depression requiring antidepres-
sant medication adjustment during the intervention phase.

Exploratory Assessment of the Efficacy 
of the Intervention

Results of the exploratory efficacy analyses are presented 
in Table 3. At the end of the intervention, the effect size 
between active and sham groups for the Fluid Cognition 
Composite  was  small  (Cohen’s d = 0.2),  favoring  active 
tDCS. However, the time × group effects did not reach sta-
tistical significance for either the Fluid Cognition Composite 

(F(1,20) = 1.8,  p = 0.19)  or  the  immediate  (F(1,20) = 1.1, 
p = 0.3) and delayed recall measures (F(1,20) = 3.4, p = 0.08; 
see supplemental Fig. 1).

The effect size for the CAMS-R (i.e., everyday mindful-
ness) was medium (Cohen’s d = 0.6) favoring active tDCS. 
However, the time × group effect for the CAMS-R failed 
to reach statistical significance (F(1,21) = 3.7, p = 0.07). In 
addition, there was a main effect of time on mindfulness 
(F(1,21) = 12.1, p = 0.002) indicating that everyday mindful-
ness increased overall in the sample (see Fig. 2).

The  effect  size  for  the  PROMIS  anxiety  scores  was 
medium (Cohen’s d = 0.6), favoring active tDCS, and the 
effect size for the PROMIS depression scores was small 
(Cohen’s  d = 0.1),  favoring  active  tDCS.  However,  the 
time × group effects were not statistically significant for the 
measures of anxiety (F(1,21) = 0.04, p = 0.84) or depression 
(F(1,21) = 2.2, p = 0.15; see supplemental figure).

Finally, the effect size for the PROMIS measure of ability 
to participate in social roles and activities was large (Cohen’s 
d = 0.9), favoring active tDCS (see Fig. 2), and the effect 
size for the PROMIS measure of satisfaction with social 
roles was also large (Cohen’s d = 0.8), favoring active tDCS

(see supplemental figure). However, the time × group effect 
failed to reach statistical significance for either PROMIS 
social measures (ability: F(1,21) = 3.9, p = 0.06; satisfaction: 
F(1,21) = 0.4, p = 0.5).

Discussion

We examined the feasibility, tolerability/safety, and prelimi-
nary efficacy of combining tDCS with MBSR in older adults 
with depression or anxiety, and subjective cognitive com-
plaints. The three main findings indicate that (1) older adults 
could self-administer tDCS and practice MBSR at home; 
(2) this combination was safe and well-tolerated; (3) and 
adherence was quite variable among participants and possi-
bly too low for achieving full benefits from the intervention. 
Exploratory analyses showed that the combined interven-
tion was associated with medium to large effect sizes for 
reduction in anxiety, increase in everyday mindfulness, and 
improvement in social functioning, with smaller effect sizes 
for reduction in depression and improvement in cognitive 
performance. However, none of these differences reached 
statistical significance.

Overall, this feasibility study has promising findings that 
justify further research into tDCS-facilitated MBSR. How-
ever, it also identifies challenges that need to be addressed 
before such a trial should be conducted. The adherence with 
both at-home practice and in-class attendance at the hospital 
was largely variable among participants. In four previous 
studies using home-based tDCS, adherence rates have been 
reported to be at or above 80% (Gough et al., 2020; Kass-
chau et al., 2016; Martens et al., 2018; Riggs et al., 2018). 
However, these studies had a shorter duration of at-home 
tDCS self-administration (e.g., 10 days), included younger 
individuals, or involved remote supervision (Gough et al., 
2020). We believe that adherence could be improved in older 
patients by improving the user interface and including more 
individualized tDCS training. Many participants shared that 
they found the tDCS setup burdensome and complex, which 
ultimately hindered their at-home practice and adherence. 
Using a headband with pre-placed electrodes may decrease 
setup time, allow for more accurate electrode placement, 
and decrease participant burden. Sending daily reminders 
via text message or email to prompt tDCS administration 
may also increase adherence. A smartphone app or objec-
tive reporting provided by the tDCS machine itself detailing 
tDCS use, rather than a self-report log, could also be used to 
improve the recording of tDCS parameters, such as number 
of minutes of stimulation, number of failures, and imped-
ance levels.

Most of the adverse events reported in this study were 
mild and transient. They included tingling, itching, pain 
and redness on the scalp, and headaches, almost exclusively 

during the course of stimulation. Three participants reported 
worsening of their depressive symptoms; however, this did 
not lead them to discontinue the study. There were no safety 
issues associated with tDCS. Adherence with tDCS adminis-
tration and in-class attendance were comparable in the sham 
and active groups, suggesting that active tDCS did not cause 
adverse effects or discomfort associated with non-adherence.
At the completion of the study, compared to baseline, par-
ticipants in both the sham and active tDCS groups reported 
an increase in everyday mindfulness. Those in the active 
tDCS group showed numerically (but not statistically) higher 
benefits from mindfulness, i.e., higher mindfulness scores, 
lower anxiety scores, and higher social participation scores. 
This is consistent with a previous pilot study in which active 
tDCS  enhanced  meditation,  calmness,  and  mindfulness 
during mindfulness meditation sessions compared to sham 
tDCS (Badran et al., 2017). This suggests that active tDCS 
has a positive and synergistic effect on learning mindful-
ness, such that those randomized to active tDCS were better 
able to learn and apply the principles taught in the MBSR 
sessions to their everyday lives. An increase in mindfulness 
could in turn lead to a reduction in depression and/or anxi-
ety symptoms. Mindfulness meditation emphasizes paying 
attention to the present moment, rather than ruminating on 
the past or worrying about the future. Past research indicates 
that MBSR reduces both worrying and ruminating (Deyo 
et al., 2009; Jain et al., 2007; Shapiro et al., 2008). Focusing 
on the present moment may help individuals reduce their 
anxiety and worrying behavior. An increase in mindful-
ness could also lead to an increase in coping mechanisms, 
allowing individuals with anxiety or depression to feel more 
equipped to deal with everyday stressors (Irving et al., 2009). 
Studies have shown that higher levels of mindfulness after 
MBSR were related to lower levels of mood symptoms and 
stress, and that increased mindfulness predicted stress reduc-
tion (Carlson & Brown, 2005; Matousek & Dobkin, 2010).
Similarly, our finding of an improvement in social func-
tioning in both groups with a numerically (but not statisti-
cally) higher improvement with MBSR combined with tDCS 
is consistent with previous studies in which both tDCS and 
MBSR separately improved social functioning (de Vibe 
et  al.,  2017;  Sellaro  et  al., 2016).  Social  functioning  is 
known to be impaired in individuals with psychiatric condi-
tions, and when psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression and 
anxiety) improve, social functioning and quality of life tend 
to improve as well (Furukawa et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2013; 
Renner et al., 2014). These findings must be interpreted 
cautiously, given the small sample size, lack of statistical 
significance, and feasibility (not efficacy) focus of the trial.
Changes in our three cognitive measures  (NIH Tool-
box Cognition Battery Fluid Cognition Composite, total or 
delayed word recall) did not differ significantly between the 
two groups. Ceiling effects were observed on some of the 

1 33056

measures on the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, such as the 
Flanker Inhibitory Control Test and the Dimensional Change 
Card Sort Test. The skills taught in MBSR are complex cog-
nitive processes, such as directed attention and executive 
control. It is possible that the teaching and practice of MBSR 
tasks benefitted from active tDCS, allowing transfer of skills 
learned and practiced to everyday mindfulness as indexed by 
higher CAMS-R scores. This everyday mindfulness, which 
involves higher-order cognition, such as complex attention 
and executive function, is more cognitively demanding than 
the NIH Toolbox cognitive tasks, which may have allowed 
the detection of the added value of tDCS stimulation. To 
be better able to detect cognitive changes over time, future 
studies should include cognitive tests with a wider range of 
difficulty. These studies should also include cognitive tests 
that assess more complex cognitive processes to more accu-
rately align with the complex cognitive processes involved 
in learning mindfulness, such as executive functioning and 
cognitive control. Again, these findings must be interpreted 
cautiously in this small feasibility study.

Limitations and Future Research

This pilot study is not without limitations. As already men-
tioned, the in-class attendance and at-home compliance of 
MBSR and tDCS had large variability among participants. 
However, we believe there are ways to improve and enhance 
both in-class attendance and at-home compliance, which 
were described above. It is possible that the adherence was 
too low in the study to achieve the full benefits of the inter-
vention, and that with increased compliance we could see 
additional benefits. Although combined MBSR and tDCS 
is a relatively low-burden intervention compared to other 
interventions which can require daily trips to the hospital, 
for some, weekly in-person sessions and daily at-home prac-
tice might be considered burdensome and/or time-intensive. 
We recognize that the time commitment for the combined 
interventions might be a limitation for some. The self-report 
aspect of tDCS and MBSR compliance is also a limitation; 
it is possible that participants over- or under-reported their 
at-home tDCS and MBSR practice. Future studies should 
focus on having more objective measures of compliance, 
in addition to self-report measures, such as the session logs 
from the tDCS devices.

The sample size for this pilot study is also a major limi-
tation, and thus the preliminary efficacy results should be 
interpreted with caution. The preliminary results, however, 
do indicate there could be added benefit of active tDCS as 
compared to sham tDCS in enhancing the effects of the 
MBSR intervention. Future research should continue to 
explore the efficacy of combined active tDCS and MBSR 
with larger samples, to determine if there are in fact syn-
ergistic effects of combining active tDCS and MBSR. We 

also did not explicitly exclude individuals with a history of 
ADHD, and/or physical problems that might impact cog-
nition (e.g., vitamin deficiencies). Future research should 
consider excluding individuals with these conditions, as it 
is likely that combined MBSR and tDCS would not impact 
cognition in these cases. We also did not formally assess 
participants’ expectations of mindfulness-based therapy 
prior to study enrollment. It is possible that expectation or 
beliefs about mindfulness could influence the efficacy of the 
intervention. Although a recent study demonstrated that nei-
ther patient expectancy nor perceived credibility of MBSR 
affected the efficacy of the intervention on improving cogni-
tion (Haddad et al., 2020), this might be another factor to 
consider in future research. Lastly, as indicated above, our 
choice of cognitive outcome measures may have obscured 
the potential effect of combined active tDCS and MBSR 
on cognition due to the ceiling performance on some of the 
tasks. Future research should aim to use more complex cog-
nitive outcome measures, which may be more affected by 
the combination of MBSR and tDCS.
