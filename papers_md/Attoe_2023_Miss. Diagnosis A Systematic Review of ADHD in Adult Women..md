Abstract
Objective: The aim of this review was to explore the impact of living with undiagnosed ADHD and adult diagnosis on 
women. 
Method: A systematic literature search was completed using three databases. Eight articles were considered relevant 
based on strict inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the results of the articles. 
Results: Four key themes emerged: Impacts on social-emotional wellbeing, Difficult relationships, Lack of control, and 
Self-acceptance after diagnosis. 
Conclusion: This knowledge can be used to advance the understanding of ADHD in adult women and the implications 
for late diagnosis in women. (J. of Att. Dis. 2023; 27(7) 645-657)

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was once 
thought to be a male only disorder, leaving women and girls 
to  suffer  in  silence  (Nussbaum,  2012).  In  childhood,  the 
ratio of boys to girls with ADHD is about 3:1 whereas in 
adulthood  it  is  closer  to  1:1,  suggesting  that  women  and 
girls  are  underdiagnosed  in  childhood  (Da  Silva  et  al., 
2020). ADHD is one of the most common psychiatric disor-
ders in childhood and can result in cognitive difficulties and 
functional impairments (American Psychiatric Association 
[APA],  2013).  Without  a  diagnosis,  women  with  ADHD 
often  report  spending  their  lives  feeling  “different,”  “stu-
pid,”  or  “lazy”  and  blaming  themselves  for  their  under-
achievement  (Lynn,  2019).  Consequently,  receiving  a 
diagnosis of ADHD can be instrumental for a woman’s self-
esteem  and  identity  (Waite,  2010).  Many  women  experi-
ence  diagnosis  as  a  lightbulb  moment,  giving  an  external 
explanation for their struggles and allowing them to accept 
themselves more fully (Stenner et al., 2019).

ADHD  is  a  manageable  condition;  early  detection  and 
treatment  can  dramatically  change  the  outcomes  for  chil-
dren with ADHD as they continue into adulthood (Quinn, 
2004). Early intervention can reduce academic and profes-
sional underachievement, relationship difficulties, and psy-
(Sassi,  2010).  Research  has 
chiatric  comorbidities 
consistently  shown  that  females  are  underdiagnosed  in 
childhood  (Mowlem  et  al.,  2018;  Quinn,  2004;  Waite, 

2010); however, there is little research looking at the impact 
of this underdiagnosis. The current review examines adult 
ADHD diagnosis in women and the impacts of living undi-
agnosed until adulthood.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder

ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by devel-
opmentally inappropriate and impairing symptoms of inat-
tention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (APA, 2013). There 
are three main presentations of ADHD, dividing symptoms 
into classifications of inattention, hyperactive-impulsive, or 
a combination of the two (APA, 2013). Presentations will 
manifest differently for each individual and will look differ-
ent from person to person. ADHD is a disorder prevalent in 
5% to 10% of school aged children (APA, 2013). It persists 
into adulthood and affects both men and women (Da Silva 
et al., 2020), impacting 2% to 6% of the global population 
(Song et al., 2021).

Gender & ADHD

Societal norms and values play an important role in how peo-
ple with ADHD perceive themselves and how they are per-
ceived by others, with society’s prevailing norms influencing 
what  is  considered  appropriate  behavior  (Holthe,  2013). 
These norms differ based on gender (i.e., the social meaning 
attached to biological sex); women and girls are encouraged 
to display “feminine” behaviors and traits such as empathy, 
good relationships with others, organization, and obedience 
(Holthe, 2013). When girls display behaviors consistent with 
ADHD symptoms (e.g., impulsivity, hyperactivity, and disor-
ganization), they are at a higher risk for social judgment for 
violations of feminine norms (Holthe, 2013). To avoid social 
sanctions, many girls with ADHD exert considerable effort to 
mask symptoms of ADHD (Waite, 2010).

ADHD  symptoms  present  differently  in  girls  and  boys 
(Mowlem  et  al.,  2018;  Nussbaum,  2012;  Quinn,  2004). 
Girls  are  more  often  diagnosed  with  ADHD-Inattentive 
(ADHD-I), exhibiting symptoms such as distraction, disor-
ganization,  and  forgetfulness  (Nussbaum,  2012).  Boys 
frequently  present  with  ADHD-Hyperactivity/
more 
Impulsivity (ADHD-HI), exhibiting greater levels of hyper-
activity,  impulsivity,  and  aggression  (Waite,  2010). These 
symptoms are often more disruptive in the classroom set-
ting,  leading  to  higher  rates  of  referral  for  assessment  in 
boys than girls (Waite, 2010). Mowlem et al. (2018) found 
that  a  clinical  diagnosis  of ADHD  was  more  common  in 
boys than girls; of the children in their study, 72% of those 
who had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD were boys. An addi-
tional 12.9% met the symptom criteria for ADHD but did 
not  have  a  formal  diagnosis.  Of  these  additional  undiag-
nosed participants, 64% were boys and 36% were girls, sug-
gesting gender differences in rates of diagnosis as well as 
diagnostic  criteria.  Externalizing  behaviors  are  a  stronger 
predictor of diagnosis in girls than boys. Girls who display 
significant  externalizing  behaviors  are  more  likely  to 
receive  a  diagnosis  than  those  who  display  internalizing 
symptoms, suggesting that girls may be more likely to be 
missed  in  the  diagnostic  process  unless  they  have  signifi-
cant  externalizing  behaviors  (Mowlem  et  al.,  2018). 
Findings suggest that the current diagnostic criteria and/or 
clinical practice is biased toward the male presentation of 
ADHD (Mowlem et al., 2018).

Not  surprisingly,  males  are  diagnosed  with  ADHD  at 
higher  rates  than  females  (Mowlem  et  al.,  2018).  One 
potential reason for this differential rate of diagnosis is that 
physicians  may  lack  knowledge  of  gender  differences  in 
ADHD,  leading  to  overlooked  or  missed  diagnoses  for 
women  and  girls  (Quinn,  2008).  Many  women  seeking 
treatment  for  mood  and  emotional  problems  may  have 
unrecognized  ADHD  (Quinn,  2008).  Higher  rates  of 
comorbidities  such  as  depression  and  eating  disorders  in 
females  with ADHD  may  make  diagnosis  more  difficult. 
As  well,  physicians  may  have  more  difficulty  separating 

Journal of Attention Disorders 27(7) 

ADHD from its comorbidities, potentially clouding ADHD 
symptoms  and  leading  to  delayed  diagnosis  in  females 
(Quinn, 2008).

Additionally, the reason for referral for ADHD services 
differs  among  males  and  females.  Males  are  more  often 
referred  due  to  behavioral  symptomology  (e.g., ADHD), 
whereas females are more often referred due to emotional 
issues, such as anxiety or depression (Klefsjö et al., 2021). 
Klefsjö et al. (2021) found that girls had more visits to a 
psychiatric  care  facility  prior  to  ADHD  diagnosis,  were 
prescribed non-ADHD medications (e.g., anti-depressants) 
before and after diagnosis at a higher rate, and were older 
than boys at time of referral and at age of diagnosis. They 
suggest that this difference may be due to the higher bur-
den of emotional problems required for girls to be referred 
for treatment. Girls are often less noticed by teachers and 
parents  until  symptoms  are  causing  significantly  more 
impairment than required for recognition in boys (Klefsjö 
et al., 2021).

Mowlem et al. (2018) found that females referred for and 
diagnosed with ADHD exhibited symptoms that were a sig-
nificant deviation from their typical behaviors, suggesting 
that females may have a slightly higher threshold for symp-
tom severity for referral and diagnosis. Females with more 
externalizing symptoms were also referred more often, sug-
gesting that because externalizing disorders are not in line 
with  what  is  considered  normative  for  females,  they  are 
more  easily  recognized  and  referred  for  assessment  than 
those with internalizing symptoms on their own.

Gender bias not only occurs in clinical settings but also 
in  the  perceptions  of  parents  and  teachers,  which  may 
impact the rate in which males and females are referred for 
treatment.  Ohan  and  Visser  (2009)  asked  parent  and 
teacher  participants  to  read  a  vignette  describing  a  child 
displaying symptoms of ADHD. Vignettes did not differ, 
other than half of participants read a vignette describing a 
child with a male name and the other half read a vignette 
describing a child with a female name. Participants were 
then  asked  to  rate  their  likeliness  to  recommend  or  seek 
services for the child described. Both teachers and parents 
were  less  likely  to  seek  or  recommend  services  for  girls 
than boys in these vignettes.

There is also gender bias in the research informing diag-
nostic criteria. Hartung and Widiger (1998) examined 243 
empirical  studies  published  in  the  Journal  of  Abnormal 
Child Psychology over the 6-year period between publica-
tion  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders (DSM) DSM-III-R (1987) and the publication of 
the  DSM-IV  (1994).  Seventy  of  those  studies  concerned 
ADHD, with 81% of participants being male and only 19% 
female.  Other  studies  looked  at  in  this  review  also  found 
gender bias in participants; of 243 studies that stated partici-
pant gender, 71% included both boys and girls and 29% (70 
studies)  were  confined  to  one  sex.  Of  these  70  single-sex 
studies, 99.6% were studies of male children.

Diagnosis

ADHD is not the only disorder where women are underdi-
agnosed. Research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has 
found that women are commonly undiagnosed or misdiag-
nosed. This inaccurate diagnosis may be due to diagnostic 
criteria being developed primarily on the behavioral presen-
tation of males (Green et al., 2019). Gender influences diag-
nostic processes in both mental and physical health settings; 
for example, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
death for women worldwide yet due to differences in symp-
tom  presentation  and  underrepresentation  of  females  in 
clinical trials, women are more likely to experience delays 
in  diagnosis,  be  treated  less  aggressively,  and  have  worse 
outcomes than men (DeMarvao et  al., 2021). Receiving a 
diagnosis can be a central part of an individual’s identity. 
Individuals  suffering  from  mental  illness  not  only  experi-
ence symptoms, but also interpret their experience of hav-
ing a diagnosed condition. Assigning meaning to diagnosis 
can affect hope and self-esteem (Yanos et al., 2010), while 
receiving a diagnosis provides an individual with a model in 
which  to  compare  themselves  and  can  help  them  to  form 
their identity. Diagnosis can help an individual make sense 
of their past and relieve uncertainty (Schmitz et al., 2003).

Women With ADHD

There are several key characteristics specific to the expres-
sion of ADHD in women as compared to men. These char-
acteristics  include  differences  in  symptom  presentation, 
decreased self-esteem, more difficulty in peer relationships, 
increased  likelihood  of  anxiety  and  other  affective  disor-
ders, the development of coping strategies that mask symp-
toms  of  ADHD,  and  gender  based  societal  expectations 
(Quinn & Madhoo, 2014). Women are more likely to pres-
ent with inattentive symptoms than hyperactive symptoms, 
which may be less easily noticed and less likely to trigger a 
referral  for  diagnosis  (Williamson  &  Johnston,  2015). As 
well,  women  are  often  diagnosed  with,  and  treated  for,  a 
comorbid  condition  before  being  recognized  as  having 
ADHD. Quinn (2005) found that 14% of girls with ADHD 
were  prescribed  antidepressants  before  being  treated  for 
ADHD compared to only 5% of boys. Robison et al. (2008) 
looked at gender differences in ADHD symptoms, psycho-
logical  functioning,  physical  symptoms,  and  treatment 
response.  They  found  that  women  were  rated  as  more 
impaired  on  every  measure  of ADHD  symptoms. Women 
were also found to score higher on rating scales for anxiety 
and  depression  as  well  as  experienced  greater  emotional 
dysregulation compared to men.

Women with ADHD are also at a higher risk of engaging 
in risky sexual behavior, unplanned pregnancy, and are more 
likely  to  be  coerced  into  having  sex  than  women  without 
ADHD (Young et al., 2020). Social stigma around risky sex-
ual  behavior,  particularly  for  females,  may  increase  social 

647

problems and limit occupational opportunities (Young et al., 
2020).  Low  self-esteem  is  common  among  women  with 
ADHD  and,  in  combination  with  social  stigma  and  risky 
sexual behaviors, may leave women with ADHD more vul-
nerable  to  sexual  harassment,  exploitation,  and  abusive  or 
inappropriate relationships (Young et al., 2020). Additionally, 
societal  and  cultural  expectations  often  put  the  bulk  of 
household and parental duties on women and the demands 
placed  on  mothers  often  differ  from  demands  placed  on 
fathers (Young et al., 2020). Increased expectations placed 
on women and mothers may result in increased impairment 
and  anxiety  in  women  with  ADHD.  Low  self-esteem  in 
combination with these demands may result in dysfunctional 
beliefs such as perceived failure, guilt, and feelings of inad-
equacy (Young et al., 2020).

For many women, the process of receiving a diagnosis 
and  treatment  for  ADHD  is  not  straightforward.  Many 
women begin the process of getting a diagnosis after their 
child  has  been  diagnosed  with ADHD,  while  others  may 
begin this process by seeking treatment for other comorbid 
conditions  (Stenner  et  al.,  2019).  Many  women  also  self-
diagnose as having ADHD; this self-identification is another 
important way in which women come to identify as having 
ADHD. For many women, ADHD falls under the category 
of “illnesses you have to fight to get” (Stenner et al., 2019, 
p. 181). Women often feel they need to prove symptoms for 
a physician to take them seriously and consider a diagnosis 
of ADHD (Stenner et al., 2019).

Comorbidities

ADHD in both men and women is often  accompanied by 
one or more comorbid conditions such as depression, anxi-
ety, and substance use (Quinn, 2004). These comorbidities 
can  often  complicate  the  assessment  of ADHD,  as  physi-
cians tend to treat comorbid conditions first and sometimes 
overlook the diagnosis of ADHD completely (Quinn, 2004). 
Comorbidities are often different for females with ADHD 
compared to males (Quinn, 2008). Rucklidge and Tannock 
(2001) found that when comparing females with ADHD to 
males  with  ADHD,  females  were  more  psychosocially 
impaired  than  males.  Females  reported  more  overall  dis-
tress, anxiety, and depression, as well as a greater external 
locus of control. They found that the combination of having 
ADHD and being a female may put an individual at higher 
risk for psychological distress. When Fuller-Thomson et al. 
(2016) compared women aged 20 to 39 years with ADHD to 
women  without ADHD,  they  found  that  the  women  with 
ADHD  had  twice  the  prevalence  of  substance  abuse,  cur-
rent  smoking,  depressive  disorders,  severe  poverty,  and 
childhood physical abuse as well as triple the prevalence of 
insomnia, chronic pain, suicidal ideation, childhood sexual 
abuse, and generalized anxiety disorder compared to women 
without  ADHD.  Biederman  et  al.  (2006)  compared  girls 
with ADHD to girls without ADHD over a 5-year period.

Journal of Attention Disorders 27(7) 

ADHD  was  associated  with  a  significantly  increased  life-
time  risk  of  major  depression,  multiple  anxiety  disorders, 
bipolar disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct dis-
order, Tourette’s/tic disorders, enuresis, language disorder, 
nicotine  dependence  and  drug  dependence.  Results  from 
this  study  show  that  at  a  mean  age  of  16 years,  girls  with 
ADHD are at a very high risk for antisocial, mood, anxiety, 
and addictive disorders. Biederman et al. (2006) stress the 
importance of early intervention and prevention strategies 
for girls with ADHD considering the high morbidity associ-
ated with ADHD in females found in their study.

Current Study

The  present  study  intends  to  consolidate  the  literature  on 
adult  ADHD  diagnosis  in  women.  A  systematic  review 
identifying,  appraising,  and  synthesizing  the  literature  on 
this topic is needed to produce a complete interpretation of 
the findings. A deeper understanding of the experience of 
adult  diagnosis  and  its  implications  in  women  is  needed. 
Uncovering and identifying broad themes within the litera-
ture  may  provide  a  narrative  of  the  experiences  of  adult 
diagnosis and their associated outcomes for women.

Methods

Literature Search

Using  a  university  digital  library,  three  databases  were 
searched for relevant abstracts: Google Scholar, PsycINFO, 
and PubMed. Studies were identified using the following 
search  terms  across  all  databases:  ADHD  (ADHD  OR 
Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder)  AND  women 
(OR females) AND diagnosis (OR late diagnosis OR adult 
diagnosis) AND  health  outcomes  (OR  psychosocial  out-
comes)  AND  adult  (in  title  and  abstract)  AND  mental 
health,  as  well  as  adult  ADHD  diagnosis  (in  title  and 
abstract), ADHD diagnosis in girls, adult ADHD diagno-
sis in women, women with ADHD, specific issues women 
with  ADHD,  implications  of  adult  ADHD  diagnosis  in 
women, psychosocial outcomes of women diagnosed with 
ADHD  as  adults.  Literature  searches  were  conducted 
across the three separate databases and reference lists of 
included articles were reviewed for additional papers fit-
ting inclusion criteria.

Eligibility Criteria

individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, and (3) 
focused on medication treatment for ADHD. Case studies 
were excluded as they were not considered to be general-
izable  to  the  experience  of  women  with  adult  ADHD. 
Studies  with  participants  diagnosed  in  childhood  were 
excluded as the focus of the review was to understand the 
impacts  of  an  ADHD  diagnosis  made  in  adulthood. 
Additionally, ADHD  treatment  was  not  the  focus  of  the 
present review.

Study Selection

A  flow  chart  created  by  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for 
Systematic  Reviews  (PRISMA;  Moher  et  al.,  2009)  was 
used to visually track the number of articles at each step in 
the  review  process  (see  Figure  1).  The  initial  search  of 
Google  Scholar  resulted  in  108  results,  the  search  of 
PsycINFO resulted in 118 results, and the search of PubMed 
resulted  in  251  results.  Seven  additional  articles  were 
included from reference searches through relevant articles. 
A combined total of 484 articles were found. These records 
were screened, and 27 duplicates were removed leaving 457 
articles.  Titles  and  abstracts  were  screened  for  relevance 
leaving 25 articles. Four articles were inaccessible, 21 arti-
cles  were  retrieved  for  full  text  screening. After  full  text 
screening, 13 articles were excluded for a final total of eight 
articles (see Appendix A).

Data Analysis

Using  the  techniques  of  thematic  analysis  (Braun  & 
Clarke, 2006) each study was closely examined to iden-
tify  significant  statements  and  results,  including  identi-
fying common significant statements and potential codes. 
Key  words  and  phrases  were  identified  in  the  texts  as 
significant if they were repeated by multiple participants 
and clearly described the experience of receiving a diag-
nosis  of  ADHD  as  an  adult  woman.  Significant  state-
ments were compared across studies to compile a list of 
initial codes (See Appendix B). Studies were then exam-
ined  with  the  list  of  preliminary  codes  to  identify  any 
statements or findings that fit within the codes. Once all 
articles  had  been  coded  with  the  preliminary  coding 
scheme, codes were grouped by similarities and follow-
ing,  potential  themes  were  identified.  The  list  of  codes 
themes was then reviewed and refined by other members 
of the research team.

Studies  were  included  if  they  (1)  were  published  after 
1997,  (2)  were  written  in  the  English  language,  (3) 
focused  on  women  over  the  age  of  18  who  received  a 
diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood, (4) were peer reviewed, 
and (5) had available full text. Conversely, studies were 
excluded  if  they  (1)  were  case  studies,  (2)  included 

Positionality Statement

In qualitative research, it is important to consider the posi-
tion  of  the  researcher  and  any  potential  bias  that  may  be 
introduced.  There  is  potential  for  bias  in  the  process  of 
selecting studies for the final review. To mitigate potential

biases in study selection the researcher used the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA; Moher et al., 2009) flow diagram (See Figure 1) 
to ensure a systematic method of study selection. The first 
author of this paper identifies as a woman with ADHD; as 
such,  the  researcher  may  have  had  a  priori  assumptions 
about the experiences of women with ADHD diagnosed in 
adulthood. These assumptions may introduce the potential 
for bias in the interpretation of results. To reduce the poten-
tial for researcher biases to influence interpretation of data, 
codes  and  themes,  the  researcher  utilized  an  inductive 
approach to coding deriving codes and themes directly from 
the  studies  as  opposed  to  using  a  coding  scheme.  The 
researcher also used an iterative coding process reviewing 
codes and themes multiple times, reviewing these with the 
project supervisor and revising as needed.

Results & Discussion

This  review  consolidated  the  literature  to  summarize  the 
current understanding of adult ADHD diagnosis in women. 

Using  techniques  of  thematic  analysis  (Braun  &  Clarke, 
2006),  eight  articles  were  reviewed.  The  results  of  each 
article  were  broken  down  into  smaller  units  of  meaning 
(codes), which were then grouped into categories forming 
themes. Four major themes emerged, focused on the impacts 
on  social  emotional  wellbeing,  difficulty  in  relationships, 
feeling out of control, and self-acceptance after diagnosis.

Theme 1: Impacts on Social-Emotional 
Wellbeing

Negative  impacts  on  social-emotional  wellbeing  were  a 
main  finding  of  all  eight  papers  in  this  review.  Social-
emotional wellbeing affects several aspects of an individu-
al’s  life,  such  as  the  ability  to  form  close,  secure,  and 
meaningful relationships, experience, regulate and express 
emotions, and explore the environment and learn new skills 
(Cohen et al., 2005).

These results suggest women with adult ADHD may 
experience  significant  difficulties  in  various  aspects  of 
social  emotional  functioning,  such  as  self-esteem,  peer 

650 

Journal of Attention Disorders 27(7) 

relations,  and  emotional  control  (Bartlett  et  al.,  2005; 
Burgess,  2000;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013; 
Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019). 
Rucklidge (1997) noted that women with ADHD reported 
having  more  depressive  episodes,  were  treated  more 
times  by  a  mental  health  professional,  had  lower  self-
esteem,  higher  stress,  and  higher  anxiety  than  women 
without ADHD.

Low  Self  Esteem.  Women  with  undiagnosed  ADHD  may 
have  notably  low  self-esteem  and  self-efficacy  (Bartlett 
et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 
2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). 
Undiagnosed ADHD  can  have  profound  impacts  on  self-
esteem and feelings of self-worth; for example, when refer-
ring to her childhood one woman reported “what I felt was 
I was actually a bad person. . . I was not an adequate human 
being.”  (Stenner  et  al.,  2019,  p.  191).  Lacking  a  better 
explanation,  perceived  personal  flaws  could  become  the 
reason for academic, social, and emotional struggles, result-
ing in self-blame and a negative self-image (Bartlett et al., 
2005; Burgess, 2000; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 
1997; Stenner et al., 2019).

Results suggest women with undiagnosed ADHD often 
endure  childhoods  filled  with  misunderstanding,  self-
blame, and rejection (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; 
Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019; 
Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). For these women, 
low self-esteem might be the result of difficulties endured 
growing  up  with  an  undiagnosed  disorder  that  neither 
they  nor  those  around  them  understood  (Bartlett  et  al., 
2005;  Burgess,  2000;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019; 
Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). They can struggle 
with  negative  automatic  thoughts,  feelings  of  shame, 
guilt, and self-blame (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; 
Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019; 
Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). They often report 
negative automatic thoughts such as, “what’s wrong with 
you,” “you’re a failure,” and “I hate myself and I want to 
die” (Lynn, 2019, p. 39). They may experience shame and 
frustration when comparing themselves to their peers and 
could feel that they are not living up to the expectations 
they  set  for  themselves  or  the  expectations  of  society 
(Burgess,  2000;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019).  Findings 
indicate that these negative feelings can result in low self-
esteem,  increased  anxiety,  and  self-loathing.  With  no 
external  cause  to  attribute  functional  impairments  to, 
women  in  these  studies  often  felt  there  was  something 
personally wrong with them (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 
2000;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997; 
Stenner et al., 2019).

Social Relations and Emotional Control.  The studies indicate 
that women with ADHD had significant difficulties in social 

relations, emotional control, and identity formation (Bartlett 
et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 
2013; Lynn, 2019; Stenner et al., 2019). Studies suggested 
that women with ADHD lacked value for themselves, had 
little to no self-worth, experienced feelings of inadequacy 
and  weakness,  and  felt  that  their  lives  were  filled  with 
missed opportunities (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; 
Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 
2019).

Many women in these studies felt “different” and alien-
ated in childhood and expressed difficulties relating to their 
peers (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & Jones, 
2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019). 
Holthe (2013) found that women with ADHD had problems 
picking  up  on  social  cues,  felt  awkward  and  out  of  place 
socially,  and  struggled  with  unintentionally  saying  things 
that were considered hurtful or inappropriate. These women 
experienced peer rejection, bullying and difficulty making 
friends; for example, one participant stated, “I cried all the 
time, very lonely, very sad, being on my own and almost the 
voice inside my head was my only friend” (Stenner et al., 
2019, p. 190).

Anger issues, poor emotion regulation and a fear of los-
ing  self-control  were  also  main  findings  (Bartlett  et  al., 
2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 2013; 
Lynn,  2019;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019);  one  participant  stated 
“there’s  a  lot  to ADHD,  like  anger.  I  have  a  lot  of  anger 
issues,  and  problems  controlling  emotions.  It’s  not  only 
problems  with  concentration  and  organizational  skills” 
(Holthe,  2013,  p.  43).  Social  difficulties  persisted  into 
adulthood  for  many  of  these  women.  Social  anxiety  and 
feeling unable to relate to other women were common expe-
riences suggesting that difficulty in social relationships in 
adulthood  may  be  a  result  of  peer  rejection  in  childhood 
(Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 2011; Lynn, 2019).

Maladaptive  Coping  Strategies.  Results  may  indicate  the 
development of maladaptive behaviors to cope with undiag-
nosed ADHD (Bartlett et al., 2005; Pinkhardt et al., 2009; 
Stenner et al., 2019). Rucklidge (1997) found that women 
with  ADHD  engaged  in  less  task-oriented  coping  and  in 
more  emotion-oriented  coping.  Women  in  these  studies 
often turned to recreational drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and sex 
to  self-medicate  for  symptoms  of  undiagnosed  ADHD 
(Bartlett  et  al.,  2005;  Pinkhardt  et  al.,  2009;  Rucklidge, 
1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019).  For  example,  one  woman 
reported that she started drinking, smoking, and being sexu-
ally active by age 10 (Stenner et al., 2019).

Desire for Earlier Diagnosis.  Many women expressed regret 
at the fact that they were not diagnosed and treated earlier 
in their lives (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & 
Jones, 2011; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; 
Stenner et al., 2019). Rucklidge (1997) found that 38% of 

Attoe and Climie 

651

women wished they had been able to change the symptoms 
of  ADHD  and  those  who  recalled  symptoms  as  a  child 
viewed symptoms as their fault and largely uncontrollable. 
These  women  expressed  feeling  that  an  earlier  diagnosis 
would  have  benefited  them  growing  up  (Bartlett  et  al., 
2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 2013; 
Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019).  One 
participant stated, “I think that if I had known a little bit 
earlier, maybe that would have helped me to make sense of 
why  things  seemed  harder,  at  an  earlier  age.”  (Holthe, 
2013, p. 47).

Results  from  these  eight  articles  suggest  that  women 
who  live  undiagnosed  until  adulthood  experience  signifi-
cant negative outcomes in the areas of self-esteem, social 
interaction, and psychosocial wellbeing beginning in child-
hood and continuing into adulthood. Earlier diagnosis and 
treatment may help to mediate these negative outcomes.

Theme 2: Difficult Relationships

Difficulty  in  family  and  romantic  relationships  was  sup-
ported  by  seven  of  the  eight  papers  in  this  review. 
Relationships with others are an important part of life; high 
quality close relationships and feeling socially connected to 
those in one’s life have been associated with decreased mor-
tality  and  disease  morbidity  (Holt-Lunstad  et  al.,  2017). 
Women  with  undiagnosed  ADHD  may  have  difficulty  in 
relationships with the people in their lives (Burgess, 2000; 
Henry & Jones, 2011; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner 
et al., 2019). Women in these studies reported worse rela-
tionships  with  teachers,  peers  and  siblings,  more  abusive 
homes, more drug and alcohol abuse by their parents, and 
perceived relationships more negatively than women with-
out ADHD (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & 
Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997; 
Stenner et al., 2019).

Romantic  Relationships.  Difficulties  getting  into  and 
maintaining healthy romantic relationships can be a com-
mon  experience  for  these  women  (Bartlett  et  al.,  2005; 
Burgess,  2000;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013; 
Lynn, 2019). Findings may indicate women with ADHD 
can  have  problematic  relationships  involving  abuse, 
divorce, and unsatisfactory sexual relationships (Bartlett 
et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Henry & Jones, 2011; Hol-
the, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Stenner et al., 2019). Women in 
these studies had difficulty with emotionally close rela-
tionships,  intimacy,  and  the  ability  to  share  emotions 
with others without losing their own identity. They were 
also  found  to  be  more  emotionally  distant  in  relation-
ships  and  have  difficulty  expressing  and  or  verbalizing 
their  individual  needs  (Bartlett  et  al.,  2005;  Burgess, 
2000; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019).

Family Relations.  Women with ADHD in these studies often 
described  very  difficult  childhoods  marked  by  a  sense  of 
self-hatred  and  self-destruction  arising  from  difficulty  in 
familial relationships (Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 
2011; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner 
et al., 2019). For example, one participant described a long 
history  of  feeling  resented  by  family  members  for  her 
“loudness” (Stenner et al., 2019). These women did not feel 
unconditionally  accepted  by  their  families  and  often  felt 
very out of place (Bartlett et al., 2005; Stenner et al., 2019). 
One participant stated, “as a child I actually felt I was living 
in the wrong family” (Stenner et al., 2019, p. 191).

Findings suggest difficulties in relationships of all kinds 
were frequent among women with ADHD. Women in these 
studies often expressed problematic romantic relationships, 
difficulty expressing themselves to others, and unsupport-
ive  family  environments  (Bartlett  et  al.,  2005;  Burgess, 
2000;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019; 
Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). Findings from these 
articles  suggest  that  undiagnosed  ADHD  may  have  an 
impact  on  women’s  ability  to  form  and  sustain  close  and 
meaningful relationships.

Theme 3: Lack of Control

Feeling a sense of control is integral for wellbeing and life 
satisfaction and has been found to be a protective factor for 
mental  health  outcomes  (Keeton  et  al.,  2008).  A  higher 
sense of control has been found to predict lower levels of 
psychological  distress,  depression,  and  anxiety  (Keeton 
et al., 2008). Many women with ADHD may lack this sense 
of control, which may leave them more vulnerable to psy-
chological distress and lower life satisfaction (Bartlett et al., 
2005;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019; 
Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019).

Women with ADHD in these studies often felt little to no 
control  academically,  and  in  relationships  with  teachers, 
peers, parents, and siblings (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 
2000; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner 
et al., 2019). Results suggest these women viewed negative 
events as uncontrollable, stable, and global (Bartlett et al., 
2005; Burgess, 2000; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner 
et al., 2019).

Locus of Control.  Women with ADHD in these studies had a 
more  external  locus  of  control  and  felt  that  chance  and 
powerful  others  were  more  controlling  over  their  lives 
(Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 
2019;  Rucklidge,  1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019). They  often 
attributed successes to external causes (i.e., luck, powerful 
others etc.) and failures to internal flaws (i.e., lack of intel-
ligence, laziness etc.; Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; 
Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 

652 

Journal of Attention Disorders 27(7) 

2019).  For  example,  one  woman  stated,  “  I  remember  in 
graduate school, when I got an A or A+, I’d immediately 
feel  like  “oh,  that  was  because  it  was  an  easy  class”, 
whereas if I did poorly, I’d think “this I’m supposed to be 
able to do, but still I can’t do it.”” (Holthe, 2013, p. 55). 
These women felt they had little control over their minds 
and that they were incapable of making decisions for them-
selves (Bartlett et al., 2005; Burgess, 2000; Holthe, 2013; 
Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019), leaving 
them feeling powerless and with little confidence in their 
ability to cope with everyday life (Bartlett et al., 2005; Bur-
gess,  2000;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997; 
Stenner et al., 2019). Together, these findings suggest that 
women  with  undiagnosed  ADHD  may  feel  little  control 
over their lives resulting in increased risk for negative psy-
chological outcomes.

Theme 4: Self-Acceptance After Diagnosis

Feelings of relief and self-acceptance after receiving a diag-
nosis of ADHD as an adult were reported by six of the eight 
papers in this review. The experience of receiving a diagno-
sis can be an important moment in the lives of adult women 
with ADHD. Diagnosis can provide an explanation, relieve 
feelings  of  shame  and  guilt,  and  allow  for  increased  self-
acceptance.  These  feelings  were  shared  by  many  women 
across several articles (Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 
2011; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner 
et al., 2019).

Relief.  Many women in these studies experienced a sense of 
relief after diagnosis and felt that a professional diagnosis 
served as an external validation of their struggles (Bartlett 
et  al.,  2005;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn, 
2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). This relief is 
exemplified in how one woman described diagnosis as, “a 
huge sense of relief, this isn’t all my fault. . . the fact that 
you could see a reason for it and deal with it was tremen-
dously  helpful”  (Rucklidge,  1997,  p.  131).  These  women 
often blamed themselves for difficulties they faced growing 
up and a diagnosis validated their struggles, reduced feel-
ings of self-blame, and provided them with access to vari-
ous treatment interventions (Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & 
Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997; 
Stenner et al., 2019).

Gaining Control.  Many women reported that it was only after 
diagnosis that they were able to feel more in control of their 
symptoms.  Knowing  that  they  had  ADHD  may  have 
allowed  them  to  view  difficult  situations  from  a  different 
perspective; results suggested they now felt they had more 
control and viewed situations as more changeable (Bartlett 

et  al.,  2005;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn, 
2019;  Rucklidge,  1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019).  Statements 
made by participants reflect this change such as, “I am not 
lazy  –  up  to  that  point  I  was  lazy. . .  my  control  really 
improved, I recognized that what were weaknesses in char-
acter  were  now  changeable”  (Rucklidge,  1997,  p.  130). 
Women also described a change in their behavior upon dis-
covering  they  had ADHD,  reflected  in  their  relationships 
with their children, romantic partners, and with themselves 
(Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 2013; 
Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019).  For 
example, one woman stated, “ADD has made me feel better 
– knowledge has helped, I’m more realistic now with my 
expectation  of  myself,  I  can  now  learn  new  strategies” 
(Rucklidge, 1997, p. 130). For many women, diagnosis can 
provide  an  external  explanation  for  difficulties  previously 
attributed to personal flaws giving them a greater sense of 
control over their lives (Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 
2011; Holthe, 2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner 
et al., 2019).

Self-Acceptance.  Results  suggested  receiving  a  diagnosis 
positively  impacted  self-esteem  and  enabled  women  to 
begin  to  view  themselves  less  critically  (Bartlett  et  al., 
2005;  Henry  &  Jones,  2011;  Holthe,  2013;  Lynn,  2019; 
Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019), with women stat-
ing,  “I  feel  good  about  myself  now”  and  “I  am  more 
understanding,  kinder  to  myself”  (Rucklidge,  1997,  
p.  131).  Findings  indicate  that  prior  to  diagnosis  many 
women  felt  that  they  were  bad  people;  consequently,  a 
diagnosis made it possible for women to reconceptualize 
some  of  the  feelings  of  guilt  and  shame  as  an  external 
cause (Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 
2013; Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019). 
Diagnosis  can  be  a  form  of  validation  from  an  external 
source,  enabling  women  to  have  more  self-compassion 
(Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 2013; 
Lynn,  2019;  Rucklidge,  1997;  Stenner  et  al.,  2019).  For 
example, one woman stated “It’s answered a lot of ques-
tions  .  .  .  I  let  myself  off  the  hook.  .  .  .  I’m  healing  that 
little girl inside of me” (Stenner et al., 2019, p. 191).

Results  may  indicate  that  overall  diagnosis  and  treat-
ment  helped  these  women  develop  a  sense  of  self-accep-
tance and self-awareness. They finally had an explanation 
for the difficulties they encountered throughout their lives. 
All participants explained that with diagnosis and treatment 
for ADHD, they were able to make more sense of their lives 
and  more  fully  accept  themselves.  Their  shame,  anxiety, 
and depression lessened and was replaced with feelings of 
pride  as  they  began  to  view  their  “disorder”  as  strength 
(Bartlett et al., 2005; Henry & Jones, 2011; Holthe, 2013; 
Lynn, 2019; Rucklidge, 1997; Stenner et al., 2019).

Limitations

Some  limitations  have  been  identified  for  the  present 
review. Many of the studies included in this review relied 
on subjective measures such as self-report and interviews, 
which introduces the potential for bias, possibly influencing 
results. As well, studies relied on self-reports of childhood, 
which may not accurately reflect childhood experiences due 
to memory bias. Studies included in this review had rela-
tively  small  sample  sizes;  consequently,  generalizability 
may be limited.

While this review may provide summative insight into 
the experiences of women diagnosed with ADHD as adults, 
it must be noted that research on this topic is limited and it 
is not possible to draw definitive conclusions. For example, 
this  review  relied  on  the  identification  of  individuals  by 
individual  researchers  for  each  study  and  was  unable  to 
determine  the  impact  of  biological  sex  differences  versus 
the impact of socially constructed gender differences. More 
research is needed to determine the impact of biological sex 
versus  gender  on  the  experience  of  being  a  woman  with 
ADHD.

Implications

The present review has several implications for research 
and  clinical  practice  in  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of 
women and girls with ADHD. This review may highlight 
a disparity in early diagnosis and treatment for boys ver-
sus girls. There is a general lack of knowledge of ADHD 
in  females  both  in  research  and  clinical  practice. 
Healthcare professionals, teachers and parents often have 
limited knowledge of the specifics of ADHD in women 
and girls (i.e., symptoms, behaviors, and outcomes more 
commonly found in females), resulting in differences in 
diagnosis and treatment. Quinn and Wigal (2004) found 
that 40% of teachers report having more difficulty iden-
tifying ADHD symptoms in girls and that 85% of teach-
ers  and  57%  of  parents  think  girls  are  more  likely  to 
remain  undiagnosed.  Lynch  and  Davison  (2022)  found 
that  teachers  and  clinicians  struggled  to  identify  symp-
toms of potential ADHD in young women. Despite these 
young  women  displaying  symptoms  of  inattention  and 
executive  dysfunction  both  teachers  and  clinicians  did 
not identify these as being problematic for these young 
women.  They  did  not  view  these  symptoms  as  needing 
further assessment. As such, delayed diagnosis may pre-
vent women from accessing treatment options that could 
mitigate  risk  factors  associated  with  ADHD  (Da  Silva 
et al., 2020).

Physicians also have difficulty in diagnosing ADHD in 
adult  populations.  Research  has  shown  that  adults  with 
ADHD often get misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. For 

653

example, Faraone et al. (2004) conducted a medical review 
of adults with ADHD and reported that only 25% of adult 
ADHD cases were diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. 
They also noted that if ADHD was not diagnosed in child-
hood or adolescence, primary care physicians did not con-
sider making an ADHD diagnosis in adults. These findings 
may indicate a gap in knowledge of ADHD in adults and 
females for healthcare providers and teachers which may 
impede  access  to  appropriate  diagnoses  and  treatment 
options.

Women  and  girls  continue  to  be  under  recognized  and 
misdiagnosed when it comes to ADHD. Findings from this 
review may indicate that increased education and training is 
needed to better support women and girls with ADHD and 
reduce negative outcomes in adulthood. Targeted interven-
tion aimed at educating health professionals, teachers and 
parents could contribute to closing the gap in diagnosis for 
girls providing them with increased treatment options at an 
earlier age.

Future Directions

Literature regarding the impacts of undiagnosed ADHD in 
women is scarce. As such, further research is needed to gain 
a more complete picture of the impact of later diagnoses for 
women. This research should be extended further to com-
pare  the  impacts  of  undiagnosed ADHD  in  both  men  and 
women to identify potential gender differences in outcomes 
as well as explore underlying biases or beliefs that hinder 
early identification in either gender. Further research includ-
ing  a  greater  sample  and  mixed  methodologies  may  have 
greater explanatory power and contribute to a greater under-
standing of adult ADHD in women.

Conclusion

Findings from the current review may indicate a need for 
further research into the topic of adult ADHD diagnosis in 
women. Living undiagnosed until adulthood can have last-
ing impacts on social emotional wellbeing, the ability to 
form and maintain relationships, and feelings of control. 
Based  on  these  findings,  it  is  apparent  that  undiagnosed 
ADHD  in  childhood  can  have  lasting  negative  conse-
quences  into  adulthood.  Missed  or  late  diagnosis  can  be 
damaging for a woman’s self-esteem, mental health, and 
overall wellbeing, while accurate and timely diagnosis can 
profoundly  change  the  lives  of  women  and  girls  with 
ADHD,  allowing  them  to  stop  blaming  themselves  and 
begin to lead more fulfilling and satisfying lives. Women 
and girls are too often suffering in silence, being left out of 
the ADHD narrative; it is imperative that these women are 
not forgotten.

“Common for most of the women in this 
study, are their descriptions of how 
procrastination, motivational difficulties, 
and problems with planning and structuring 
work have presented them with academic 
as well as psychological challenges. In the 
absence of a better alternative, perceived 
personal flaws became the explanation for 
academic struggles, resulting in self-blame, 
and over time, to a negative self-image, 
which has followed several of the women 
into adulthood” (Holthe, 2013, p. 37).

“This participant had experienced 

considerable rejection from her family and 
peers as she was growing up, and had been 
unable to achieve the academic benchmark 
set by her family because of her AD/HD” 
(Bartlett et al., 2005, p. 56).

“The participants in this study expressed 
they often felt out of control when it 
came to managing the internal impact 
of functional impairments. This lack of 
control caused the participants to feel 
discouraged, angry, sad and overwhelmed” 
(Lynn, 2019, pp. 60–61).

“All participants explained that with 

diagnosis and treatment for ADHD, they 
were able to make more sense of their 
lives and more fully accept themselves. 
Their shame, anxiety, and depression 
appeared to lessen, replaced with feelings 
of pride as they viewed their “disorder” as 
strength” (Henry & Jones, 2011, p. 258).
