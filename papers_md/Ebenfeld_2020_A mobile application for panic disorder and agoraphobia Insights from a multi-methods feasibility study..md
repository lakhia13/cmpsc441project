Background: Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD) is a common psychological disorder. Internet-
based interventions have the potential to oﬀer highly scalable low-threshold evidence-based care to people
suﬀering from PD. GET.ON Panic is a newly developed internet-based intervention addressing symptoms of PD.
In order to transfer the training into the daily life of the individuals, we integrated mobile components in the
training and created a so-called hybrid online training. The development and beta-testing of such a training
requires a novel interdisciplinary approach between IT specialists and psychologists. From this point of view, we
would like to share our experiences in this exploratory paper.
Methods: This initial feasibility study (N = 10) oﬀers, on the one hand, a brief overview of the interdisciplinary
development phase of the mobile application and on the other hand, provides ﬁrst insights into the usage,
usability and acceptance of this mobile application using qualitative interview data as well quantitative mea-
sures of 8 completing participants. For these reasons, we used a pre-posttest design without a control group.
Furthermore, we present initial clinical outcomes of the intervention on e.g. panic symptom severity, depressive
symptoms as well additional anxiety measures. Finally, we end with implications for further research in the
relatively new ﬁeld of mobile mental health.
Results: Overall, usability, user satisfaction, motivational value and technology acceptance of the app were
perceived as high. The usage of app components was diverse: The use of interoceptive exposure exercises and
daily summaries on anxiety and mood was highest while using in-vivo exposure exercises and monitoring panic
symptoms was perceived as diﬃcult. Furthermore, participants showed after the training less clinical symptoms
as at baseline-assessment.
Discussion: The current feasibility study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the potential of mobile
technology in e-mental health. Overall, the GET.ON Panic app appears to be an acceptable and motivational part
of a CBT-based hybrid online training for PD that has the potential to promote training success. After some
suggested adjustments have been made, the eﬃcacy should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.

1. Introduction

Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD) is with a life-
time prevalence of 1.1%−3.7% a common anxiety disorder (Jonge
et al., 2016; Kessler et al., 2006) that causes serious impairments for the
individual (Wittchen et al., 2011) as well high economic costs from a
societal perspective (Batelaan et al., 2007; Ophuis et al., 2018). Cog-
nitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a widely used eﬀective treatment for

PD (Pompoli et al., 2016; Sánchez-Meca et al., 2010), which – in the last
decade – has found increasing use in internet-based interventions
(iCBT) and has proven to be acceptable and eﬀective for the treatment
of PD (Andrews et al., 2018; Andrews et al., 2010; Olthuis et al., 2015)
as well other mental disorders such as depression or anxiety disorders in
general (Andersson et al., 2014; Carlbring et al., 2006; Lewis et al.,
2018; Richards and Richardson, 2012).

Considering an annual increase of 20% of new mobile-broadband

subscriptions to a worldwide number of 4 billion people using mobile
internet, compared to a 9% growth rate for ﬁxed-broadband subscrip-
tions per year ([ITU]International Technology Union, 2017), smart-
phones are promising to facilitate access to evidence-based health care
for a large number of people. Recently, researchers have started to
explore the potential of smartphones in the ﬁeld of e-mental health
(Boschen and Casey, 2008; Ehrenreich et al., 2011; Eonta et al., 2011;
Heron and Smyth, 2010; Proudfoot et al., 2013). Compared to inter-
ventions that are exclusively delivered via a device that connects to
stationary internet (such as PC or laptop computer), an assimilation
into the everyday life can be fostered with the use of mobile technology
such as smartphones (Enock and McNally, 2014; Harrison et al., 2011;
Price et al., 2014). Particularly in the case of PD, the use of mobile tools
in treatment is promising, as the treatment intervenes where panic at-
tacks take place, namely in the everyday lives of those aﬀected
(Christoforou et al., 2017; Ivanova et al., 2016; Proudfoot et al., 2013).
Mobile-based interventions show advantages such as a high accessi-
bility to the internet, independence of time and location regarding
treatment delivery, provision of context-sensitive feedback, real-time
data collection as well as the use of sensor technology for data collec-
tion (Heron and Smyth, 2010; Proudfoot, 2013).

However, the emerging ﬁeld of m-mental health can still be de-
scribed as being in its infancy as many available apps lack scientiﬁc
evidence (Donker et al., 2013; Sucala et al., 2017) or show poor content
quality (Singer et al., 2015). For these reasons, in addition to studies
evaluating treatment eﬃcacy, initial exploratory studies are needed for
building foundations to assess usability and feasibility of innovative
tools in treatment of mental problems as well as gaining and sharing
further knowledge in this ﬁeld. Examples of such in-depth feasibility
studies in the ﬁeld of m-mental health include the work of Morrison
et al. (2014) providing data (N = 13) on quantitative app usage as well
qualitative interviews regarding the desktop- and app-based weight
management POWeR Tracker. As one of the main results the afore-
mentioned authors highlight the beneﬁt of a multicomponent, hybrid
intervention format. Supplementing a web-based program with a mo-
bile application leads to higher awareness of achievement of eating and
physical activity goals, which was also conﬁrmed by qualitative evi-
dence. Another exploratory investigation on an intervention based on
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) that integrated mobile-
and desktop-based technology suggested that participants (N = 11)
suggested an increase in ACT-relevant outcomes as psychological ﬂex-
ibility and valued action; scores on depression, anxiety, stress and
global satisfaction did not change over time (Ly et al., 2012). Further,
participants' experience of the intervention was investigated with the
help of qualitative questionnaires indicating that the mobile application
has the potential to transfer the training into the daily life of the client,
while the psycho-educational part delivered via a desktop-based tool
was perceived as too text-based. For further research the authors sug-
gest an integration of mobile technology in order to increase adherence
to online health trainings. Further, Morris et al. (2010) presented ﬁve
case studies on an app for emotional self-awareness in order to un-
derstand participants' use of the newly developed mobile application.
More examples of feasibility studies include mobile interventions for
depression (Burns et al., 2011), bipolar disorder (Bardram et al., 2013;
Bardram et al., 2012), schizophrenia (Depp et al., 2010) and promoting
health behaviors as self-monitoring of caloric balance (Tsai et al., 2007)
or understanding medication labels (Grindrod et al., 2014).

Due to tremendous potential of m-health interventions and the lack
of studies in the ﬁeld of PD, the aim of the present feasibility study is to
the newly developed
explore usage, usability and acceptance of
GET.ON Panic app as part of a hybrid online training GET.ON Panic.
Furthermore, we present initial clinical outcomes of the training on
panic symptom severity, depressive symptoms as well additional an-
xiety measures and to draw conclusions for future development of
mobile interventions for research and practice.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

The 10 participants were recruited from the waiting list of inter-
ested individuals for participation in online trainings for PD. They
learned about the possibility to take part in the GET.ON online training
via newspaper or radio reports. The average age of the participants was
41,5 years (SD = 14,4 years, N = 10) with an equal representation in
gender (ﬁve female, ﬁve male participants). With regard to the parti-
cipants' ethnical background, seven are Caucasian, one is Asian and two
did not make a speciﬁcation. Seven of ten participants have a college
degree or higher, two have ﬁnished a vocational training and one has
ﬁnished secondary school. Experience with psychotherapy was men-
tioned by nine of the ten participants. Eight of them had received
psychotherapy for PD prior to the study. Seven of the participants used
an iPhone with an iOS operating system and three of them participated
with an Android smartphone. For further information see Table 1. For
better readability, we have decided to nickname the study participants.
These names are unrelated to their real name.

2.2. Intervention

The GET.ON Panic app that is described and evaluated in this paper
was part of the hybrid online training GET.ON Panic combining a
desktop and a mobile component based on cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) for PD. The hybrid online training consists of 6 modules with a
recommendation of working on one module per week. After every
module, participants received feedback on their training progress by a
trained psychologist. The ﬁrst module is mainly an introduction of the
training and the mobile application. Furthermore, psycho-education
concerning panic, agoraphobia and avoidance are oﬀered. In the second
module, participants start with interoceptive exposure exercises in
order to provoke similar bodily symptoms as in a panic attack with the
intention of getting used to those symptoms. In-vivo exposure exercises
are part of the third module. Participants confront themselves with
their anxiety provoking situations in real life. The fourth and ﬁfth
modules focus on cognitive restructuring exercises with an emphasis on
the role of irrational beliefs with regard to panic-associated topics. The
sixth and last module is about relapse prevention and ﬁnally deals with
an evaluation of the training in terms of attaining individual goals.
Overall, the desktop components are primarily used to provide text- and
video-based psycho-education as well as exercises that require ex-
tensive writing. The mobile application GET.ON Panic app consists of
two main components: a mobile diary and a mobile exposure guide.

The mobile diary is used to document panic attacks and to record

2

Internet Interventions 19 (2020) 100296

daily summaries. When the mobile application is started, users are
presented with the main screen (see Fig. 1a) from which the desired
component and function can be activated quickly. For further descrip-
tion of the hybrid online training see the study protocol for the RCT
(Ebenfeld et al., 2014). To document a panic attack with the GET.ON
Panic app, users are asked to answer four questions on a Likert-like
scale from 1 to 10 (see Fig. 1b). For this purpose, we created a novel
input component based on the single-dimension mood-scale presented
by Morris et al. (2010). The number moves with the ﬁnger and the
intensity of the background color changes in order to provide an ad-
ditional visual feedback (high values have a high intensity and vice-
versa). In addition, we wanted users to be able to give individual
meaning to a panic event in a non-prescribed way. We anticipated that
some users are more visually oriented while others tend to prefer text.
Therefore, two additional options have been included in the doc-
umentation of panic events. First, we encourage users to take a photo of
either the situation where the event occurred or something that is re-
lated to the situation. Second, they may enter written notes in order to
remember feelings or speciﬁc aspects of the situation. For daily sum-
maries, a ﬁxed-schedule diary was implemented (Bolger et al., 2003).
Participants were asked to choose a ﬁxed time each day, preferably in
the evening, where they reﬂect on the past day and ﬁll in a daily
summary. In order to visualize a client's development and progress, the
application plots the daily summaries over time (see Fig. 1d). Fur-
thermore, the plot illustrates how using the training exercises can re-
duce panic symptoms by depicting, for each day, how many exposure
exercises have been performed.

The exposure guide oﬀers support for performing interoceptive and
in-vivo exposures. It is constructed as a wizard, which leads the user
through a sequence of steps while at the same time oﬀering instructions
and orientation (see Fig. 1c). In addition, at certain points, the user is
asked to answer questions in order to measure if the exposure has been
performed correctly (for example the level of anxiety, the degree of
avoidance and the severity of body-symptoms). After an in-vivo ex-
posure, users are oﬀered feedback to see if the exercise worked and to
reﬂect on the situation (see Fig. 1e). Furthermore, they have the pos-
sibility to take of photo of the mastered situation. Users can review
these photos in a photo gallery together with the feedback and a de-
scription of the situation.

2.3. Development of the app

High credibility is crucial to facilitate behavioral change (Fogg,
2003), whereas credibility is deﬁned as the combination of perceived
trustworthiness and perceived expertise and highlights the importance
of a product's visual appearance for the perceived ﬁrst-hand and long-
term experience (Fogg, 2003; Fogg et al., 2009). For these reasons, the
GET.ON Panic app was developed in an iterative process in a multi-
disciplinary team of IT scientists, visual and interaction designers and
psychologists from science as well clinical practice. We started each
iteration by creating a paper mockup for a speciﬁc feature that the app
should fulﬁll. The mockup was reﬁned until the functionality was
presented to our satisfaction. Following this, we have created a func-
tional prototype that can be run on a smartphone. In the next step, this
prototype was extensively tested and gradually improved in several
feedback loops in the multidisciplinary development team. Instead, we
decided to use psychotherapists and researchers with experience in the
treatment of PD. In addition, we conducted regular but informal tests
with team members who were not directly involved in the app devel-
opment. For further presentation of the app, see also Kleine Stegemann
et al. (2013).

2.4. Measures

2.4.1. Screening

according to in- and exclusion criteria identical to those described in
the study protocol of the planned RCT (Ebenfeld et al., 2014). This
screening consisted of demographic data (e.g. age, gender, education,
smartphone model), the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) (Bandelow,
1995, 1997) and Item 9 of the BDI-II that screens for suicidality (Beck
et al., 1996; Hautzinger et al., 2006). Furthermore, the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR axis-I disorders (SCID-I) (Wittchen
et al., 1997) was used to get a detailed sample description (e.g. presence
or absence of PD, agoraphobia, other anxiety disorders and a current
depressive episode). The interview was conducted by a trained inter-
viewer via telephone (Irvine et al., 2012; Rohde et al., 1997).

2.4.2. Clinical outcomes

Panic symptoms were measured with the PAS (Bandelow, 1995,
1997; Bandelow et al., 2000). The PAS is a 13-item questionnaire which
is divided into ﬁve subscales addressing panic attacks, agoraphobic
avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, limitations in daily life, and health
concerns (e.g., fear of physical harm or fear of an organic cause). These
subscales can be evaluated separately or as a total score, ranging from 0
to 52. Higher scores indicate a higher level of panic symptoms. The
psychometric properties of the scale are good, with Cronbach's alpha of
0.86 (Bandelow, 1995). A score of 0–8 indicated no clinical relevant
symptoms, a score of 9–28 a moderate level of symptoms, and a score of
29 or higher indicated severe symptomatology (Bandelow, 1995).
Agoraphobic cognitions were assessed with the Agoraphobic Cognitions
Questionnaire (ACQ) (Chambless et al., 1984; Ehlers and Margraf,
2001). The 14-item questionnaire has a total score range between 14
and 70. Internal reliability is reported as α = 0.80 (Craske et al., 1986).
Bodily sensations were measured with the Body Sensation Ques-
tionnaire (BSQ) (Chambless et al., 1984; Ehlers and Margraf, 2001), a
17-item self-report questionnaire. The total score of the BSQ ranges
from 17 to 85 and has proven a good internal reliability of α = 0.87
(Chambless et al., 1984). Agoraphobic avoidance was measured with
the Mobility Inventory (MI) (Chambless et al., 1984; Ehlers and
Margraf, 2001). The 27 items of the MI cover the most important
agoraphobic situations. Each situation is rated for both when person is
alone and when they are accompanied by someone else. The two total
scores range from 27 to 135, respectively. The internal consistency is
reported to be α = 0.94 (alone) and α = 0.91 (accompanied)
(Chambless et al., 1984). Furthermore, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating
Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959; Weyer, 2005), a 14-item observer-
rating was conducted. For these reasons an adaption of the structured
interview guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) (Shear
et al., 2001). The total score of the HAM-A and SIGH-A ranges between
0 and 30. The interview has shown good inter-rater and test-retest re-
liability of ICC = 0.99, α = 0.86 (Shear et al., 2001). Depressive
symptoms were assessed with the well-established German version1 of
the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)
(Hautzinger and Bailer, 1993; Radloﬀ, 1977). The 20 items were an-
swered on a 4-point Likert scale regarding the previous week. The total
score ranges from 0 to 60. Internal consistency is reported as Cronbach's
α = 0.89 (Hautzinger and Bailer, 1993).

2.4.3. Usability

Usability of GET.ON Panic app was examined using the System
Usability Scale (SUS). The ten-item scale ranging from 0 to 100 gives a
an overview of subjective assessments of the usability (Brooke, 1996). A
reliability analysis conducted by Bangor et al. (2008) found the internal
consistency of the SUS to be Cronbach's α = 0.91. The survey was
administered only at post-trial. At the time of the study, there was no
standard German translation of the questionnaire. As a consequence,
we involved experts from the ﬁeld to create our own German version of
the SUS using back and forward translation to ensure the correct

2.4.4. Technology acceptance

2.4.5. Compliance to app

Research on technology acceptance is an established part of in-
formation systems science, which strives to explain factors that aﬀect
acceptance of software systems. The technology acceptance model
(TAM) and its successor TAM2 are commonly used models that are
based on theory of reasoned action (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh and Davis,
2000). While the conducted pilot-study is not powered suﬃciently for a
full-size TAM analysis, we used the subscales to assess acceptance of our
app. Speciﬁcally, these include the dimensions “Perceived Usefulness”
and “Perceived Usability”. Furthermore, researchers have noted that
acceptance is not only motivated by extrinsic aspects but also by in-
trinsic factors (Davis, 1989; Heijden, 2004). For this reason, we in-
cluded a third scale for the dimension “Perceived Enjoyment”. We de-
veloped items for the three diﬀerent scales based on the questionnaires
published by Venkatesh and Davis (2000) as well as the items on per-
ceived enjoyment as proposed by Heijden (2004). In this process, we
incorporated researchers from the ﬁeld of clinical psychology as well as

To assess compliance with GET.ON Panic app, the number of in-
teractions with the app was recorded. In this context, we deﬁned an
interaction as the activation of a function of the app by its user. Due to
technical limitations, low-level interactions, such as single gestures or
page transitions, have not been stored. Furthermore, it has to be noted
that we did not include “view-only” interactions, such as reading the
diary or looking at photos. From the recorded data, several measures
were derived. First, the number of interactions per module and over the
course of the intervention was used to evaluate app usage at a global
level. Next, the average number of interactions per day has been cal-
culated in order to account for varying intervention durations amongst
participants. Finally, we determined the total and average number of
interactions per participant to evaluate individual diﬀerences.

2.4.6. User satisfaction

User satisfaction of the training was measured with a self-designed

4

L. Ebenfeld, et al.

Internet Interventions 19 (2020) 100296

questionnaire based on the German version of the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire (Attkisson and Zwick, 1982; Schmidt et al., 1989). The
adapted version of the questionnaire consists of 8 items and the total
score ranges from 0 to 32. Internal consistency of the original German
version questionnaire has been reported as good (Schmidt et al., 1989).

2.4.7. Feasibility interviews

A semi-structured interview with the participants was conducted at
post-trial via telephone. The interview consisted of 59 open questions
covering the training in general, the speciﬁc functions of GET.ON Panic
app, integration of app and online training as well as enjoyment.

2.5. Data analysis

All data contained answers from 8 participants and were analyzed
on completer-only principals due to drop out of 2 participants. The
quantitative analyses were done using R (package = “lsr”) (Navarro,
2014; R Core Team, 2013). We calculated the changes in pre and post
scores by performing t-tests. Furthermore, we calculated Cohen's d ef-
fect sizes for the clinical outcome measures. The qualitative data was
analyzed based on thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke
(2006). For these reasons, the recorded interviews were transcribed and
coded. Subsequently, all important aspects related to the research
questions were identiﬁed and clustered to identify relevant topics and
general patterns.

3.3. Usability

Results from the System Usability Scale are summarized in Table 3.
The mean score of 84.06 indicates that there have been no serious us-
ability issues. According to Bangor et al. (2008), GET.ON Panic app
shows a good usability that is well within the acceptable range. The
mean scores for all items were above midpoint of the scale for positive
and below midpoint for negative items (Table 4). Of note is that par-
ticipants found the app generally easy to learn and easy to use. On the

3.4. Technology acceptance

The results from the assessment of technology acceptance for
GET.ON Panic app are illustrated in Table 6. In general, participants
scored high on all items of the TAM survey. They did not only ﬁnd the
mobile application to be useful for the training (subscale “Perceived
Usefulness”, M = 6.13, SD = 0.75, Likert scale 1–7), but also indicated
that they enjoyed using the app (subscale “Perceived Enjoyment”,
M = 5.89, SD = 0.91, semantic diﬀerential 1–7). Furthermore, the
score for perceived usability (M = 6.09, SD = 1.24, Likert scale 1–7) is
congruent with the results from the system usability scale.

3.5. Compliance to app

The eight participants spent a mean of 51.88 days in the training
(SD = 12.11). During this time, they used GET.ON Panic app on
average 1.56 (SD = 0.96) times per day. The use of individual app
functions varies amongst participants with daily summaries and inter-
oceptive exposures being the most popular parts. On the other hand, the
function for in-vivo exposures was not well received and the number of
documented panic events seems to be rather low (see Table 7). Fig. 2
shows that, on average, app use was highest in the second module (2.34
times per day) and remained – at a slightly lower level – fairly constant

for modules three to six. During the last module, however, the app was
used signiﬁcantly less by all participants. Examination of app use and
clinical outcomes shows no signiﬁcant relation between average use per
day and clinical outcomes (Fig. 3). This is illustrated, for example, by
Sid, who used the app 2.62 times per day but improved less than Liz,
who used the app only 0.91 times per day. The PAS score of Ken, who
performed the most interoceptive exposure amongst all participants
(125 times) and also used the app most often even increased by 5
points.

3.6. User satisfaction

All participants scored high on the user satisfaction questionnaire
with a mean of 30.13 (SD = 1.64). Given that the maximum achievable
score is 32, we can assume a high level of satisfaction of the participants
with the training in general.

3.7. Interviews

Based on thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) ﬁve key
themes were identiﬁed. Visual feedback and photo function were
themes that directly address the functions of the app. Everyday suit-
ability, usability (design) and interaction of app and online training
were also functional but from a more general perspective. In addition,
motivation and self-eﬃcacy were clustered as intrapersonal themes.

3.7.1. Feasibility

The training without the mobile component was described as dif-
ﬁcult to complete “because you just do not have the computer with
you” as Joy stated. The exposure exercises on the app were perceived as
“feasible” (Guy), “easy” (Amy) and “comprehensible” (Joe). One of the
perceived advantages by Liz was that “the anxiety provocation exercises
[interoceptive exposure exercises] could be done in real time by means
of the app”. Joy was not able to integrate the exercises in her daily life
due to technical problems (as discussed in the usability section). Six of
the eight participants would have preferred a reminder for the exercises
and daily summary. Most of the participants were able to ﬁll in the
daily summary most of the time (see compliance to app). In the fol-
lowing, reasons for non-compliance to the diary will be speciﬁed. Joy
reported that she forgot to ﬁll in the diary “if there wasn't an anxiety
event on this day or because I was distracted by other things”. Ken also
mentioned time-related problems that lead to forgetting the daily
summary. Regarding the registration of anxiety events the participants
reported problems with performing this task. Reasons for this were “I

7

haven't had any panic attacks at all during the course of the training”
(Joe) or “during the moment of panic, I didn't have a clear head and the
time for this” (Joy). Regarding the in-vivo exposures a typical problem
was that participants forgot to ﬁnish the exercise by pushing the ‘ﬁnish’
button with the consequence that the data was not recorded. Others
reported that the app functions as tutorial and motivation, but the ac-
tual in-vivo was performed in a non-structured way without the app.
With regard to the interoceptive exposure participants reported less
problems with performing this task according to the app. Only Dan
stated that “it became annoying to answer all the questions twice a
day”.

3.7.2. Motivation

In the interview all participants indicated that motivation was an
important factor of the mobile application. Dan described that “tech-
nical gadgets are per deﬁnition very motivational”. Guy stated: “Using
the app was fun because I am an app-oriented person”. Especially in
terms of conducting the interoceptive exposure exercises the mobile
application was perceived as valuable. All of them stated that they
would not have done the exercises that often without the app. One
perceived the app as “mental support” during the exercises and “The
fact that you can see what you have done is very motivating.”.
Regarding motivational elements in the app the participants expressed
contrary opinions. Three participants said that they would appreciate to
have more motivational elements. “More motivational elements would
be a good loosening up for the training.” Two of the eight participants
experienced the motivational elements (such as the photo function) as
“way too much” and “not desirable”.

3.7.3. Usefulness

One objective of the self-help training was to provide people who
are suﬀering from panic with a better understanding of their anxiety.
Nearly all participants reported that especially the interoceptive ex-
posure exercises lead to a better understanding of how the body reacts
during a panic attack. “You can make the diﬀerence with interoceptive
exposure exercises. Also, the daily summary facilitates the own esti-
mate”, as one participant states.

3.7.4. Visual feedback

Five interviewees reported that they liked the visual representation
of the daily summaries and that it helped them to become more aware
of their course of panic attacks. One said “that the perception of an
anxiety attack is quite diﬀerent at the moment while it happens and
afterwards” and another one stated “retrospectively, I realized that
nothing frightening would really happen”. Dan experienced the visua-
lization of daily summaries as “reasonable but without added value”
due to the fact that he knew “how the course of anxiety will look like”.
Only Guy said that “the visual feedback was not that helpful. A sim-
pliﬁed visualization with bar charts would be preferable”. The gra-
phical representation of the exposure exercises was also perceived as
useful by nearly all of the users. “The graphical feedback of the ex-
posure exercise was helpful to understand ‘the thing as a whole’”. One
remark of Dan was that he would have preferred all questions on a
single page.

3.7.5. Photo function

The photo function as part of the documentation of the anxiety
events as well during the in-vivo exposure lead to controversial state-
ments. Most of the participants stated that they understood the meaning
of the photo function but they did not use it. In the interviews we found
explanations like “taking a picture wouldn't have a beneﬁt” or “a nice
gadget, but I wasn't able to take a picture of the anxiety provoking
stimulus” or “anxiety events weren't catchable enough to capture in a
photo” or “taking pictures wasn't important for me, the graphical
feedback was more important to me”. Another one said “I just took a
picture, it was a symbolization of the moment - how I felt there”. All

 
 
 
L. Ebenfeld, et al.

Internet Interventions 19 (2020) 100296

participants who found it diﬃcult to take a picture of an anxiety pro-
voking stimulus agreed that they would have preferred to take a picture
of a positive association which was not related to an anxiety-trigger.

3.7.6. Interaction of app und online training

One part of the interview focused on the integration of the app and
the browser-based training part into a hybrid online training format. All
participants said that the combination of both was overall coherent and
very motivational. As a suggestion for improvement “it would be great
if you would open the app and automatically see the exercises con-
cerning module 3” (Joe).

4. Discussion

Previous research has highlighted the potential of smartphones to
treat mental health problems (Boschen and Casey, 2008; Ehrenreich
et al., 2011; Eonta et al., 2011; Heron and Smyth, 2010; Proudfoot
et al., 2013). In this paper, we presented the mobile application
GET.ON Panic app and examined its development, feasibility, usability,
technology acceptance and ﬁrst
indices on clinical eﬀectiveness
amongst 8 participants suﬀering from PD symptoms.

4.1. Principal ﬁndings

Below we discuss the most important ﬁndings that can be drawn

from this study.

4.1.1. App development

We developed the mobile application with an interdisciplinary team
of researchers and clinicians from the ﬁelds of psychology, computer
science and visual design in an iterative process. We have perceived this
as a very eﬃcient way of working. Clear areas of responsibility, dif-
ferent perspectives and frequent exchanges led to a common under-
standing of the objectives and little “frictional losses”.

4.1.2. Feasibility and usability

Most participants viewed the GET.ON Panic app as a feasible means
of training. The usage was relatively high with daily summaries and
interoceptive exposures exercises as the mostly used and most valued
parts of the app. All participants stated they would not have done these
exercises that often without the app. The app thus seems to enhance
adherence to the training and to fulﬁll a motivational function. High
scores on user satisfaction, usability and technology acceptance support
these ﬁndings.

However, some parts of the app oﬀer room for improvement.
Overall, two components of the app were perceived as diﬃcult. First,
the participants reported problems with performing the real-time re-
gistration of anxiety events. Reasons for this could be that they cur-
rently do not suﬀer from panic attacks at all. For this case, they received
the instruction instead to register the avoidance behavior whenever it
occurs. However, this instruction seems diﬃcult to follow per se, since
avoidance is usually not conscious behavior and therefore diﬃcult to
notice and register. As further explanation it can be stated that re-
gistering a panic attack while actually having a panic attack is per-
ceived as diﬃcult. Participants reported they were too excited to enter
data immediately and registering in this case was not perceived as
supportive. Second, performing in-vivo exposures guided by the app led
to diﬃculties. This exercise was introduced in one of the modules of the
browser-based training. Here, the participants have to build their an-
xiety hierarchy by ordering their anxiety-provoking moments from
weak to strong. Further, they have to enter this hierarchy in the app
again. This was perceived as ineﬀective. A synchronization of data
between app and training was desired in order to enhance the usability.
In addition, it seems that the instruction of the app was diﬃcult to
follow. After successful exposure task, the participants were asked to
stop the exercise on their smartphone display. However, it is suggested

that many participants forgot this step due to excitement while and
after exposure.

Using the app seems to facilitate daily routines during the training
such as performing interoceptive exposure exercises or monitoring
symptoms as overall anxiety or mood. In contrast, measuring data that
is less predictable and more event-related (e.g. as in-vivo exposures or
monitoring panic attacks) was perceived as more diﬃcult. These per-
ceptions were in line with the ﬁndings of Morrison et al. (2014). They
stated that their POWeR tracker app was associated with greater usage
for speciﬁc, repetitive behavior.

4.1.3. Integration in daily life

All participants said to perceive the combination of both, a mobile
tool and a browser-based training as coherent and very motivational. In
particular, elements of the app, such as (interoceptive) exposure ex-
ercises and receiving graphical feedback after performing this task
helped them to get an understanding of their bodily sensations during
anxiety moments. As an idea for improvement some participants only
wished one reminder for the daily recurring exercises in order to ensure
a better integration of these exercises in their daily routines. Other
elements led to more controversial statements. For example, the usage
of the photo function as part of the documentation of the anxiety events
or during the in-vivo exposure has not added any therapeutic value to
the participants. Most of them did not use it or consider it as a fun
gadget. In contrast to our initial assumptions, it seems that a photo
function is not an eﬀective means to enhance the transfer of the training
into the daily-lives of the participants.

4.1.4. Eﬀects of app on clinical outcomes

In view of the study design, we can neither make reliable statements
about the clinical eﬀectiveness of the app nor of the hybrid online
training and its mechanisms of change. However, due to the fact that
most participants improved on the clinical outcomes like panic, anxiety
and depressive symptoms, albeit, non-signiﬁcant overall, we assume the
hybrid training has the potential to reduce panic symptoms as well as
further clinical outcomes such as depression. Since we did not ﬁnd any
correlation between clinical improvement and app usage, we cannot
further specify the added value of the app compared to browser-based
training alone in terms of clinical eﬃcacy. Moreover, in the recent
meta-analysis of Andrews et al. (2018), including only browser-based
trainings for PD (e.g. Carlbring et al., 2006; Ballegooijen et al., 2013;
Wims et al., 2010), a large mean eﬀect size of hedge g = 1.31 was
found, which also indicates that the beneﬁt of the app in terms of
clinical eﬃcacy needs further investigation.

4.2. Strengths and limitations

One strength of this study is the mixed method design with taking
qualitative and quantitative data into consideration. This allows us to
draw conclusions about how aﬀected people rated, used and interacted
with an app for PD. As a limitation, this exploratory study design is not
able to meet the demand for generalizability of the results to a larger
population. Furthermore, conclusions about the clinical eﬀectiveness
are also not possible due to a missing control group and insuﬃcient
power of the study. As a ﬁnal remark, it should be noted that two of the
ten participants dropped out of the study without giving any reasons.
We were not able consider their opinions on feasibility. This could bias
the present interpretation of the results.

4.3. Future work

As a short-term implication we would like to implement minor
improvements such as layout issues or integration of a prompts for
entering the daily summaries. Looking further ahead, the input of data
should be facilitated in the long term, especially at times when parti-
cipants are in high states of arousal, as it is common during panic

8

Internet Interventions 19 (2020) 100296

attacks or in vivo exposures. In these moments it may be inconvenient
to enter data via the touchpad keyboard. To improve usability, data
entry could be done using the integrated voice recorder that transmits
voice-to-text. Furthermore, the current app has not yet explored the
potential of integrated context sensors. For further long-term app de-
velopment, it would be worthwhile to use GPS data to provide in-
telligent context-sensitive exposure tasks. People would become in-
formed via an app notiﬁcation when there is a previously deﬁned
anxiety-provoking location close to them, as, for example, a shopping
mall or a high tower. They would be invited to perform an exposure
task in real-time and real-place environment. This gamiﬁed component
might foster the motivation of clients. As a ﬁnal note on the develop-
ment procedure of a hybrid online training, we favour an automatic
synchronization of the entered data between the mobile app and the
browser-based training to avoid the need for duplicate input on both
devices and instead allow a continuous training process with an im-
proved usability. As closing general remark when planning to develop a
hybrid online training, we recommend an automatic synchronization of
entered data between the mobile app and the browser-based training to
avoid taking double entrees and instead oﬀer a consecutive training
process. Finally, with regard to future research an RCT is necessary to
assess the clinical eﬃcacy of the GET.ON Panic app as part of a hybrid
online training.

4.4. Conclusion

The combination of quantitative and qualitative data leads to fur-
ther insights into how participants use a health care app. Findings from
this study suggest that supplementing an iCBT training for PD with a
mobile application has the potential to improve adherence, usability,
usage as well clinical outcome of the training. From a patient's per-
spective, using the app seems fun, is engaging and facilitates daily
routines during the training such as performing interoceptive exposure
exercises or monitoring anxiety or depressive symptoms on a daily
basis. In contrast, measuring data that is less predictable and more
event-related (e.g. in-vivo exposures or monitoring panic attacks) was
perceived as more diﬃcult. With regard to further app development,
this leads to the idea that the input of data during excitement, for ex-
ample during panic attacks or in-vivo exposure exercises should be less
eﬀort for the individual. This can be achieved, for example, by entering
data via voice and not via typing on the smartphone's touchscreen.
Furthermore, the integration of intelligent context-sensitive tools, such
as prompting real-time content in relevant moments could lead to fur-
ther improved usage of the app. Finally, a following RCT is necessary to
address this research question.
