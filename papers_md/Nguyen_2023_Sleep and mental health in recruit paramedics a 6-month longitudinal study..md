Abstract 

Study Objectives:  To explore potential relationships and longitudinal changes in sleep and mental health in recruit paramedics over 
the first 6 months of work, and whether sleep disturbances pre-emergency work predict future mental health outcomes.
Methods:  Participants (N = 101, 52% female, Mage = 26 years) completed questionnaires prior to (baseline), and after 6 months of emer-
gency work to assess for symptoms of insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, 
and trauma exposure. At each timepoint, participants also completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph for 14 days to assess sleep 
patterns. Correlations between baseline sleep and mental health were conducted and changes in these variables across timepoints 
were examined using linear mixed models. Hierarchical regressions assessed whether sleep at baseline predicted mental health at 
follow-up.

Results:  Insomnia and depression symptoms, and total sleep time increased while sleep onset latency decreased across the first 6 
months of emergency work. Participants experienced an average of 1 potentially traumatic event during the 6-month period. Baseline 
insomnia predicted increased depression symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, while baseline wake after sleep onset predicted fol-
low-up PTSD symptoms.

Conclusion:    Results  highlight  an  increase  in  insomnia  and  depression  across  the  initial  months  of  emergency  work,  while  sleep 
disturbances before emergency work were identified as potential risk factors for the development of depression and PTSD among 
paramedics in their early career. Screening and early interventions targeting poor sleep at the beginning of emergency employment 
may assist in reducing the risk of future mental health outcomes in this high-risk occupation.

Statement of Significance

The transition into full-time shift work and emergency work is a challenging period for new recruits. In paramedics, limited re-
search has examined how this initial period of work impacts sleep and mental health, and no studies have investigated whether 
poor sleep pre-exposure to paramedic work increases the risk of future mental health outcomes. Over the first 6 months of emer-
gency work, we found insomnia and depression symptoms increased in recruit paramedics. Higher insomnia symptoms pre-work 
also predicted increased depression symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, while baseline wake after sleep onset predicted follow-up 
post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. These findings highlight the need to examine early interventions targeting poor sleep 
prior to emergency work to reduce the risk of mental health problems.

Introduction

The  demanding  nature  of  emergency  work  routinely  exposes 
personnel to potentially traumatic events, placing these work-
ers  at  high  risk  of  mental  health  issues  [1,  2].  Compared  to 
other  emergency  services  such  as  firefighters  and  police,  par-
amedics  have  increased  rates  of  post-traumatic  stress  disor-
der  (PTSD;  20%)  [3],  and  experience  high  levels  of  depression 
(10%) and anxiety (22%) [1]. Poor sleep is also common among 
emergency workers due to workplace stress and irregular work 
schedules,  including  extended  working  hours,  rotating  shifts 
and  long  work  weeks  [2,  4].  For  instance,  53.8%  of  Australian 
paramedics engaging in shift work reported difficulty sleeping 
[5] while research in the United States found paramedics work-
ing more than 40-hour weeks were more likely to have insom-
nia [6]. Furthermore, data indicate the prevalence of insomnia, 
along with other sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea; 
OSA) and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety 
and PTSD, are higher among Australian paramedics when com-
pared to the general population [7, 8]. Together, these sleep and 
mental  health  disturbances  generate  significant  health  and 
economic costs [9, 10] and contribute to high turnover among 
emergency service personnel [11, 12].

Cross-sectional  research  in  paramedics  in  North  America 
[13,  14]  and  Asia  [15]  have  found  poor  sleep  quality  and  sleep 
disorders are closely associated with PTSD, depression, and gen-
eralized  anxiety  disorder  (GAD).  These  findings  are  consistent 
with  a  recent  study  in  Australia  which  found  paramedics  who 
screened high risk for OSA had higher depressive symptoms, and 
those screening at risk for insomnia had greater risk of depres-
sion and anxiety [7]. This prior cross-sectional research, however, 
has  largely  focused  on  more  experienced  personnel  who  may 
have  different  health  profiles  to  their  less  experienced  coun-
terparts [8]. Thus, our understanding of how sleep disturbances 
relate to mental health outcomes among paramedics earlier in 
their  career,  such  as  when  they  are  first  recruited,  is  less  well 
understood.

The transition into full-time shift work for the first time is a 
challenging  period  shown  to  increase  sleep  and  mental  health 
disturbances  in  recruit  police  officers  [16]  and  healthcare  shift 
workers, such as doctors and nurses [17, 18]. Recruit paramedics, 
however,  may  have  different  demographic  characteristics  and 
workplace  demands  when  compared  to  new  workers  in  these 
other occupations. For instance, recruit paramedics [19,  20] are 
slightly  younger  than  new  police  [16]  and  healthcare  workers 

[21–23], and compared to law enforcement, ambulance services 
are less male dominated [8]. Given these characteristics and the 
unique  combination  of  occupational  demands  faced  by  para-
medics (e.g., exposure to potentially traumatic events, rotational 
shift work, sleep disturbances) [2, 5–8, 19], it is likely paramed-
ics’ transition to work and the potential impact this has on their 
health will be different to new workers in other occupations, and 
this  therefore  warrants  the  need  for  further  research  which  is 
specific to this industry. In recruit paramedics, however, limited 
studies have explored longitudinal changes in sleep as they pro-
gress  through  their  early  career  [24,  25],  and  only  1  study  has 
explored temporal changes in mental health in recruit paramed-
ics [26]. In this study, Wild and colleagues found 8.3% of partic-
ipants  developed  PTSD  and  10.6%  developed  depression  during 
the  2-year  follow-up  period  [26].  Further  research  in  paramed-
ics is needed to confirm these longitudinal changes in PTSD and 
depression, as well as extend this area to determine how other 
mental health outcomes (e.g., anxiety, substance use) and sleep 
patterns in recruit paramedic personnel potentially change after 
exposure  to  emergency  work.  Given  the  high  rate  of  sleep  and 
mental health problems reported in paramedics [1, 3, 5, 6], such 
information  is  critical  in  identifying  when  adverse  sleep  and 
mental  health  problems  first  appear  in  new  workers  and  the 
subsequent tailoring of industry specific interventions based on 
this data.

Although  sleep  disturbances  have  been  traditionally  viewed 
as  a  symptom  of  mental  health  problems,  emerging  research 
in military personnel indicates sleep may be a risk factor in the 
development  of  depression,  GAD  and  PTSD  [27,  28].  While  the 
Wild  and  colleagues  study  described  earlier  showed  an  episode 
of PTSD or depression during the first 2 years of work predicted 
higher  insomnia  symptoms  at  the  24-month  follow-up  [26],  no 
studies have examined sleep as a predictor of subsequent men-
tal health problems in new paramedics. Moreover, Wild and col-
leagues reported insomnia symptoms after 12 and 24 months of 
the  paramedics’  careers  [26],  thus  the  longitudinal  relationship 
between sleep and mental health at the very start of a paramed-
ic’s career remains unknown. Furthermore, longitudinal relation-
ships between mental health outcomes and other common sleep 
problems among paramedics, such as OSA, short sleep duration 
and poor sleep quality have not been examined, and most prior 
research  in  paramedics  and  other  emergency  services  has  been 
cross-sectional [4, 7, 29, 30]. Consequently, whether causal rela-
tionships  exist  between  sleep  and  mental  health  outcomes  in 
paramedics  is  largely  unknown.  It  is  vital  further  longitudinal 
research determines how sleep, a common yet modifiable factor, 
could be related to the development of mental health symptoms 
in paramedics.

As  previous  studies  have  suggested,  the  first  6  months  is  a 
critical  period  for  new  shift  workers  that  is  shown  to  adversely 
impact  various  aspects  of  health  [17,  18].  It  is  therefore  crucial 
to  examine  the  relationships  between  sleep  and  mental  health 
outcomes  in  recruit  paramedics,  and  whether  these  relation-
ships  change  following  the  beginning  of  emergency  work. Thus, 
the aims of the present study were to: (1) examine potential rela-
tionships between sleep and mental health symptoms in recruit 
paramedics before exposure to emergency work; (2) prospectively 
investigate whether sleep and mental health symptoms in para-
medics change during the first 6 months of their career; and (3) 
assess  whether  sleep  disturbances  in  recruit  paramedics  prior 
to beginning emergency work predict poorer mental health out-
comes after 6 months of work.

Methods

The  current  study  is  part  of  the  ongoing  Sleep  and  Health  in 
Ambulance Paramedic Employees and Students (SHAPES) Project, 
which  is  a  longitudinal  project  tracking  paramedics  through-
out  their  early  career.  In  the  present  study,  we  report  on  sleep 
characteristics and mental health symptoms in newly recruited 
Graduate  Ambulance  Paramedics  assessed  prior  to  beginning 
emergency work (baseline) and after approximately 6 months of 
active-duty work as a paramedic (6-month follow-up).

Participants
Recruit  Graduate  Ambulance  Paramedics  from  Ambulance 
Victoria  (Victoria,  Australia)  volunteered  to  participate  in  the 
study.  Potential  participants  were  provided  a  brief  overview  of 
the  research  project  via  an  information  session  on  the  first  day 
of their induction. This induction is a compulsory, largely class-
room-based  3-week  training  period  that  does  not  involve  over-
night  shift  work.  Participants  expressing  interest  in  the  study 
were  screened  for  eligibility  via  a  phone  interview.  Participants 
who had previously been employed as a paramedic or in another 
emergency  service  and/or  the  defence  force  were  excluded. 
Participants with a history of working full-time shift work involv-
ing ≥ 2 overnight shifts (i.e., ≥ 6 hours on duty between 10 PM and 
8 AM) per week in the last 3 months were also excluded.

Figure 1 outlines the recruitment process. A total of 101 partici-
pants were recruited across separate induction groups conducted 
between  August  2018  and  December  2020.  In  total,  461  eligible 
personnel attended these induction groups, providing a response 
rate of 22%. All 101 participants completed the baseline assess-
ment; however, 8 participants dropped out resulting in 93 partic-
ipants who completed the 6-month follow-up. Participants were 
told prior to consent and at each assessment that all data would 
remain confidential by the researchers. The study was approved 
by  the  Monash  University  Human  Research  Ethics  Committee 
and  the  Ambulance  Victoria  Research  Governance  Committee. 
All participants provided informed consent prior to commencing 
data collection.

Measurements
At  each  timepoint,  all  participants  completed  an  online  sleep 
and mental health survey via REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture) [31] hosted at Monash University. The survey used val-
idated,  self-report  screening  tools  to  examine  sleep  and  mental 
health  symptoms.  In  addition,  participants  wore  an  actigraphy 
device (Actiwatch Spectrum or Actiwatch Spectrum PRO, Philips 
Respironics, OR, USA) and completed a self-report sleep diary at 
each timepoint.

Sleep assessments
The Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) [32] was used to screen for risk of 
OSA, with participants classified as either low or high risk of hav-
ing OSA. Cronbach’s alpha for the BQ in the current sample was 
0.62. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [33] was used to measure 
perceived insomnia severity in the last 2 weeks. Higher scores on 
the ISI are indicative of more severe insomnia symptoms, and a 
total score ≥ 10 is considered the optimal cut-off score for indi-
cating increased insomnia risk in the community [33]. Cronbach’s 
alpha for the ISI in the current sample was 0.78.

Participants completed a paper-and-pen sleep diary to record 
self-reported time in bed, sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after 
sleep onset (WASO) for each major sleep (i.e., ≥ 3 hours) during a

14-day  period  at  each  timepoint.  In  addition,  participants  wore 
a  wrist-worn  actigraphy  device  continuously  during  the  14-day 
period to provide an objective measure of rest and sleep intervals. 
The actigraphy device was configured to collect data in 60 second 
epochs. Actiware software (V.6) [34] was used to analyze actigra-
phy data. This involved scoring data in the high sensitivity setting 
which scored sleep onset after more than 10 immobile minutes 
and the wake threshold value was set to 20 (i.e., wake was scored 
at  more  than  20  activity  counts  per  epoch).  Validation  studies 
have shown that actigraphy data scored using this high sensitiv-
ity setting produced results more comparable to the gold stand-
ard for sleep measurement, polysomnography (PSG), as opposed 
to  the  default  medium  sensitivity  setting  in  Actiware  [35,  36]. 
The  scorer  manually  adjusted  each  major  sleep  period  accord-
ing to sleep-diary reported bedtime and wake time. The Actiware 
(V.6) [34] algorithm generated automatic sleep and wake periods 

which calculate the objective sleep parameters. The +60 method 
of  adjustment  [37]  was  used  to  account  for  obvious  sleep  out-
side self-reported time in bed, which involved manually extend-
ing  rest  intervals  up  to  60  minutes  on  either  side. This  method 
has  been  used  in  prior  research  in  nurses  [38],  military  person-
nel and patients with insomnia [39–42]. For instances where the 
sleep  diary  was  missing,  rest  intervals  were  scored  according 
to  the  automatically  generated  times  by  Actiware.  A  minimum 
of  5  days  of  actigraphy  data  (which  included  only  days/24-hour 
periods  that  had  1  or  more  sleep  of ≥  3  hours)  was  required  for 
analysis as this duration of data has been shown to provide a reli-
able measure of sleep patterns [43]. Actigraphy data were scored 
by  2  independent  scorers  who  had  completed  actigraphy  train-
ing. There  was  adequate  inter-rater  reliability  (i.e.,  70%)  [44,  45] 
between the scorers based on a subset of actigraphy files (i.e., 20 
files from each timepoint), and all discrepancies between scorers 

were  resolved  via  discussion  prior  to  data  analysis.  Therefore, 
only actigraphy data that reached 100% agreement between both 
scorers were included in the data analysis.

Variables  obtained  from  actigraphy  and  used  for  analyses 
included:  total  sleep  time  (TST;  i.e.,  total  amount  of  time  spent 
asleep), WASO  (i.e.,  periods  of  wakefulness  after  sleep  has  been 
initiated and before final awakening), SOL (i.e., time taken to tran-
sition  from  wakefulness  to  sleep),  and  sleep  efficiency  (SE;  i.e., 
percentage  of  time  spent  asleep  while  in  bed).  Sleep  diary  data 
were not analyzed and only used to assist with actigraphy scor-
ing. All  sleep  parameter  variables  (i.e., TST, WASO,  SOL,  and  SE) 
were  derived  from  actigraphy  data. Actigraphy  has  been  shown 
to correlate at approximately 90% agreement with PSG data [46]. 
Due to faulty actigraphy devices, 4 participants were rescheduled 
to  complete  the  6-month  follow-up  data  collection,  on  average, 
22 days after the original assessment period. These 4 participants 
who  had  their  sleep  monitoring  period  delayed  did  not  signifi-
cantly differ in age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or any of the 
sleep  parameters  collected  at  the  6-month  follow-up  (i.e.,  TST, 
WASO,  SOL,  and  SE)  when  compared  to  the  wider  sample  (see 
Supplementary Material Table S1).

Mental health assessments
The  Life  Events  Checklist-5  (LEC-5)  [47]  was  used  to  screen  for 
potentially traumatic events in a participant’s lifetime. It assesses 
16  events  that  may  be  stressful  and  includes  1  additional  item 
assessing  any  other  stressful  event  not  captured.  Exposure  to  a 
traumatic  event  was  defined  as  the  participant  indicating  the 
event “happened to me” and/or they “witnessed it". The number of 
participants exposed to at least 1 potentially traumatic event prior 
to (baseline) and after 6 months of emergency work (6-month fol-
low-up) were reported. The most common type of potentially trau-
matic event was also reported. The PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) [48] 
was used to measure PTSD symptom severity. Higher scores on the 
PCL-5 are indicative of greater PTSD severity, with scores ≥ 33 indic-
ative of probable PTSD [49]. The Cronbach’s alpha for the PCL-5 in 
the current sample was 0.91. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9) [50] was used to measure depressive symptoms in the past 
2 weeks, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of depression. 
A total score on the PHQ-9 ≥ 10 indicates increased risk of major 
depression [50] and the Cronbach’s alpha for this measure in the 
current sample was 0.76. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-
7) [51] questionnaire was used to assess anxiety symptoms in the 
past 2 weeks, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of GAD. 
A total score of ≥ 10 on the GAD-7 indicates increased risk of GAD 
and the Cronbach’s alpha for the GAD-7 in the current sample was 
0.85. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption 
(AUDIT-C) [52] derived from the full-form AUDIT, was used to iden-
tify participants at possible risk (defined as an AUDIT-C score of ≥ 4 
for men and ≥ 3 for women) of being hazardous drinkers or having 
active alcohol use disorders. The Cronbach’s alpha for the AUDIT-C 
in  the  current  sample  was  0.63.  Finally,  a  drug  use  frequency 
checklist  was  used  to  measure  frequency  of  non-medical  use  of 
the following drugs in the past 6 months: amphetamine, cocaine, 
marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, hallucinogens and/or dis-
sociative drugs, and opiates. The number of participants engaged 
in the use of these substances at each timepoint was reported.

Statistical analysis
Statistical  analysis  was  conducted  using  IBM  SPSS  Statistics 
(V.27)  and  RStudio  (V.1).  An  alpha  value  of  .05,  two-tailed  was 
used  as  significance  for  all  tests.  One  participant  had  incom-
plete data for the main outcome variables at each timepoint and

was excluded from analyses. The participants who dropped out 
before the 6-month follow-up  did not significantly differ in age, 
gender  or  baseline  sleep  and  mental  health  symptoms  to  the 
remaining  sample.  Only  participants  who  completed  the  LEC-5 
and  endorsed  experiencing  a  potentially  traumatic  event  sub-
sequently completed the PCL-5. This is consistent with how the 
PCL-5  is  normally  administered  [48].  Consequently,  20  partici-
pants  at  baseline  and  30  participants  at  the  6-month  follow-up 
did  not  complete  the  PCL-5. The  participants  who  did  not  com-
plete the PCL-5 did not significantly differ in age, gender, BMI or 
sleep variables (i.e., ISI, OSA, SOL, WASO, TST, and SE) compared 
to those who completed the PCL-5 (see Supplementary Material 
Table  S2).  Participants  with < 5  nights  of  actigraphy  data  were 
excluded,  which  led  to  4  participants  at  baseline  and  2  partici-
pants at the 6-month follow-up being excluded. Data collection 
occurred  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  for  4  participants  at 
baseline and 26 participants at the 6-month follow-up. The par-
ticipants  who  participated  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  did 
not significantly differ in demographic characteristics (age, gen-
der, and BMI), mental health or sleep variables to the wider sam-
ple (see Supplementary Material Table S3).

Spearman’s  correlation  analyses  were  conducted  to  examine 
potential cross-sectional relationships between continuous sleep 
variables  (ISI,  SOL,  WASO,  TST,  and  SE)  and  continuous  mental 
health  symptoms  (PHQ-9,  GAD-7,  and  PCL-5)  at  baseline  before 
exposure  to  emergency  work.  Correlations  between  insomnia 
(ISI)  and  mental  health  symptoms  included  101  participants, 
while correlations between actigraphy sleep variables and men-
tal  health  symptoms  included  86  participants.  The  correlation 
between insomnia (ISI) and PTSD (PCL-5) scores was also re-run 
excluding  item  20  on  the  PCL-5  (i.e.,  trouble  falling  or  staying 
asleep)  given  this  item  measures  insomnia  symptoms  which 
may  overlap  with  the  insomnia  measure  (i.e.,  ISI).  In  addition, 
point-biserial correlation analyses were used to assess cross-sec-
tional  relationships  between  OSA  (BQ)  risk  (dichotomous  vari-
able)  and  continuous  mental  health  symptoms  (PHQ-9,  GAD-7, 
and  PCL-5)  at  baseline.  The  correlation  between  OSA  risk  (BQ) 
and  PTSD  (PCL-5)  included  81  participants,  while  correlations 
between OSA risk and GAD (GAD-7), and OSA risk and depression 
(PHQ-9) included 101 participants.

For  the  prospective  analysis,  linear  mixed  models  (LMM) 
assessed whether participants experienced changes in sleep (ISI, 
SOL, WASO, TST,  and  SE)  and  mental  health  symptoms  (PHQ-9, 
GAD-7, and PCL-5) after 6 months of emergency work compared 
to baseline. The assumptions of homogeneity of variance and nor-
mality of random effects were met. LMM assessing insomnia (ISI), 
depression (PHQ-9) and GAD (GAD-7) included 101 participants, 
while  the  models  examining  actigraphy  sleep  variables  (SOL, 
WASO,  TST,  and  SE)  and  PTSD  (PCL-5)  included  95  participants 
and  91  participants,  respectively. The  McNemar’s  test  was  used 
to  assess  whether  the  proportion  of  participants  at  risk  of  OSA 
changed from baseline to follow-up, and this included a sample 
size of 93 participants. Based on the LEC-5, the most commonly 
experienced and average number of potentially traumatic events 
at the 6-month follow-up were also reported.

Hierarchical  multiple  regressions  were  conducted  to  exam-
ine  whether  poor  sleep  at  baseline  predicted  mental  health 
outcomes at the 6-month follow-up. A total of 19 separate regres-
sions  were  conducted  to  assess  the  relationship  between  each 
baseline  sleep  variable  (ISI,  OSA,  SOL, WASO,  TST,  and  SE)  and 
each 6-month follow-up mental health variable (PHQ-9, GAD-7, 
and PCL-5). The Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) False Discovery Rate 
(FDR) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons by 

6

setting  the  FDR  at  0.25.  Given  the  exploratory  nature  of  this 
study, the FDR was controlled at this rate to ensure potentially 
important associations are not missed and thus can be followed 
up in future research [53, 54]. Analyses were grouped into 3 fam-
ilies based on the outcome variable (i.e., PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PCL-
5) which included 6 tests each for the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 families, 
and  7  tests  for  the  PCL-5  family.  Several  variables  were  trans-
formed  prior  to  analysis.  The  variables  LEC-5  and  WASO  were 
square root transformed while age, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 were log-
arithmic transformed. The PCL-5 variable was square root trans-
formed or logarithmic transformed depending on the regression 
model  (see  Supplementary  Material  Tables  S5–S20).  These  two 
types  of  transformations  were  conducted  to  improve  the  nor-
mality  of  continuous  variables  and  the  homoscedasticity  of 
residuals. The assumptions of multicollinearity, independence of 
residuals, linearity, homoscedasticity and absence of influential 
outliers were met. Regression analyses were adjusted for covar-
iates of age, gender, and baseline mental health symptoms. Age 
and gender were included as covariates based on prior research 
demonstrating  close  associations  between  these  factors  and 
depressive, anxiety and PTSD symptoms [19, 55]. The LEC-5 score 
at  baseline  was  included  as  a  covariate  in  the  analysis  assess-
ing PTSD, given the strong association between trauma exposure 
and  PTSD  symptoms  [56].  Additionally,  analyses  controlled  for 
baseline mental health symptoms, given baseline mental health 
levels may be associated with poor sleep and are likely to persist 
or worsen by the 6-month timepoint [57]. Three-step hierarchical 
regressions were conducted with 6-month mental health symp-
toms  (PHQ-9,  GAD-7,  and  PCL-5)  as  outcome  variables.  Gender 
and age were entered in the first step; baseline mental health var-
iables (including LEC-5 for the PTSD model) were entered in the 
second  step;  and  baseline  sleep  variables  (ISI,  OSA, TST, WASO, 
SOL, and SE) were entered in the third step. Given the potential 
for  overlap  between  the  insomnia  measure  and  the  sleep  item 
(i.e., item 20) on the PTSD measure (i.e., PCL-5), the hierarchical 
regression examining baseline insomnia and follow-up PTSD was 
also  re-run  excluding  this  item  from  the  6-month  PTSD  score. 
Hierarchical  multiple  regressions  examining  insomnia  (ISI)  and 
OSA risk (BQ) at baseline and follow-up mental health symptoms 
included  93  participants,  while  regressions  examining  baseline 
actigraphy  sleep  variables  and  follow-up  mental  health  symp-
toms included 80 participants.

other  significant  correlations  between  sleep  and  mental  health 
outcomes  at  baseline  (p > .05)  and  re-running  the  correlation 
between ISI and PCL-5 with the sleep item removed did not lead 
to any additional findings (see Supplementary Material Table S4).

Prospective analysis
Changes in sleep, mental health and trauma from baseline 
to 6-month follow-up

Participants’  insomnia  (b = 1.56  [0.86,  2.26],  p < .001),  objective 
TST  (b = 11.25  [1.99,  20.51],  p < .05)  and  depressive  symptoms 
(b = 0.49  [0.26,  0.71],  p < .001)  significantly  increased  within  the 
first  6  months  of  their  career  (Figure  2).  Conversely,  objective 
SOL (b = −0.20 [−0.34, −0.06], p < .01) significantly decreased from 
baseline  to  6-month  follow-up  (Figure  2). There  were  no  signifi-
cant  changes  for  OSA  risk  (p = 1.00),  GAD  (b = 0.12  [−0.10,  0.35], 
p = .27), PTSD (b = 2.01 [−0.30, 4.34], p = .09), SE (b = 40.04 [−81.87, 
162.26], p = .52) or WASO (b = 0.11 [−0.07, 0.30], p = .23) from base-
line to 6-month follow-up. At follow-up, participants experienced 
an average of 1.03 potentially traumatic events during the first 6 
months  of  emergency  work. The  most  common  types  of  poten-
tially traumatic events experienced during the follow-up period 
were physical assaults and life-threatening illness/injury, which 
were each experienced by 16% of participants.

Associations of baseline sleep with 6-month follow-up 
mental health symptoms

Baseline insomnia (ISI) significantly predicted follow-up depres-
sion  symptoms,  after  controlling  for  age,  gender,  and  baseline 
depression  symptoms  (F(4,88) = 5.54,  p < .001,  R2 = .20;  Table  2). 
Together,  ISI  and  covariates  explained  20%  of  the  variance  in 
follow-up  depression  symptoms.  Baseline  objective  WASO  sig-
nificantly predicted follow-up PTSD symptoms, after controlling 
for  baseline  age,  gender,  baseline  PTSD  symptoms  and  LEC-5 
(F(5,74) = 6.87,  p < .001,  R2 = .32;  Table  3).  Objective  WASO  and 
covariates  explained  31.7%  of  the  variance  in  follow-up  PTSD 
symptoms.  These  results  remained  significant  after  correction 
for  multiple  comparisons.  No  other  mental  health  symptoms 
were predicted by any other sleep measures (see Supplementary 
Material  Tables  S5-S20),  and  our  analysis  examining  insomnia 
and the PTSD measure (i.e., PCL-5) with the sleep item removed 
from  the  PCL-5  did  not  result  in  a  significant  relationship  (see 
Supplementary Material Table S21).

Results

DISCUSSION

Table  1  displays  descriptive  statistics  for  baseline  and  6-month 
follow-up demographic, sleep, and mental health characteristics. 
At  baseline,  16%  of  participants  met  criteria  for  insomnia  and 
8%  reported  high  risk  for  OSA.  Most  participants  scored  within 
the normal range on each mental health measure. However, over 
half the participants (56%) reported hazardous drinking behavior 
and 5% reported using marijuana, which was the most frequently 
used drug.

Cross-sectional analysis
Spearman’s  rho  correlations  demonstrated  significant  positive 
correlations  between  ISI  and  PHQ-9  (rs = 0.46,  p < .001),  ISI  and 
GAD-7 (rs = 0.23, p = .02), WASO and PHQ-9 (rs = 0.30, p < .01), and 
WASO  and  GAD-7  (rs = 0.25,  p < .05)  at  baseline.  These  relation-
ships indicate that, prior to emergency work, more severe levels 
of  insomnia  and  increased  objective WASO  are  associated  with 
more  severe  depression  and  GAD  symptoms.  There  were  no 

This  study  examined  potential  relationships  between  sleep  and 
mental  health  outcomes  in  recruit  paramedics  and  assessed 
whether  these  outcomes  changed  following  exposure  to  emer-
gency work. In addition, the study investigated whether poor sleep 
at  baseline  (prior  to  emergency  work)  was  predictive  of  mental 
health outcomes after 6 months of emergency work. At baseline, 
objective WASO was above, and both objective sleep duration and 
sleep  efficiency  were  below,  what  is  recommended  for  healthy 
adults (Figure 2) [58]. On the other hand, the prevalence of self-re-
ported  sleep  disorder  and  mental  health  symptoms  at  baseline 
were  low.  Nonetheless,  significant  positive  correlations  were 
observed  between  symptoms  of  insomnia  and  both  depression 
and GAD, as well as between objective WASO and both depression 
and GAD. After only 6 months of emergency work, objective TST, 
insomnia  and  depressive  symptoms  increased  while  objective 
SOL decreased compared to baseline. We found greater baseline 
insomnia  symptoms  and  objective WASO  predicted  an  increase

in depression and PTSD symptoms, respectively, at the 6-month 
follow-up.

The  low  prevalence  of  sleep  disorder  and  mental  health 
symptoms  in  recruit  paramedics  at  baseline  suggests  the  sam-
ple  was  relatively  healthy  prior  to  beginning  emergency  work. 
Additionally,  based  on  the  validated  cut-off  scores  [49,  50],  the 
percentage of paramedics at risk of PTSD (PCL-5 score ≥ 33 = 1%) 
and  depression  (PHQ-9  score ≥ 10 = 2%)  at  baseline  were  lower 
in  the  current  sample  than  in  previous  research  in  paramedic 
trainees  in  South Africa  [19].  Conversely,  research  in Australian 
paramedic personnel in their early career (i.e., less than 2 years) 
has reported probable PTSD rates (2%) [8] which are more com-
parable  to  those  observed  in  the  current  study. At  baseline,  3% 
of recruit paramedics were at risk of  GAD  based on the clinical 

cut-off  (GAD-7  score ≥ 10),  which  is  similar  to  levels  reported  in 
UK  paramedics  at  the  start  of  training  [26].  Furthermore,  our 
findings show depression and insomnia increase over the first 6 
months  of  emergency  work  in  paramedics.  Similar  to  baseline, 
however,  cut-off  scores  indicate  the  prevalence  of  insomnia  (ISI 
score ≥ 10 = 25%)  and  depression  (PHQ-9  score ≥ 10 = 9%)  in  par-
amedics at follow-up were slightly lower in comparison to prior 
research  tracking  sleep  and  mental  health  problems  in  emer-
gency  personnel  [26,  59],  early  career  nurses  [60],  and  medical 
interns [21] in the initial months to years of their career. In many 
of  these  prior  longitudinal  studies  assessing  high-risk  occupa-
tions, workers were typically tracked for more than 6-months and 
those with a history of emergency, military or recent shift work 
experience were not excluded [21, 26, 59, 60]. Furthermore, many

of  the  prior  pre-to-post  military  deployment  studies  include  a 
combination  of  new  and  experienced  personnel  who  may  have 
been  exposed  to  potentially  traumatic  events  and/or  shift  work 
throughout  their  employment  prior  to  participation  [28,  61,  62]. 
These aspects of the prior research may explain the higher rates 
of certain sleep and mental health disorders in employees from 
the  military  [28,  61]  and  other  demanding  occupations  [21,  26, 
59]  when  compared  to  recruit  paramedics  in  the  current  study 
who  were  only  tracked  for  the  first  6-months  of  work  and  had 
limited  exposure  to  shift  work  and  emergency  work  prior  to 
participating.  Indeed,  the  current  study  specifically  excluded 
paramedics  with  recent  full-time  shift  work  experience  and/or 
previous  employment  in  another  emergency  or  defence  service. 
Prior research that followed new nurses with no prior shift work 
or emergency service experience and over shorter periods of time 
(e.g., 6–9 months) have reported baseline levels [63] and longitudi-
nal changes in sleep disturbances [64] which align more closely to 
our findings. Recruit paramedics may initially present as a resil-
ient group, who are then vulnerable to sleep and mental health 
problems  as  they  progress  through  the  first  6  months  of  their 
career, though future research should extend beyond this period 
to understand potential changes in sleep and mental health over 
longer time frames.

Despite the relatively low prevalence of self-reported sleep dis-
order symptoms in paramedics, objective sleep parameters indi-
cated  sub-optimal  sleep  quality  at  baseline.  For  instance,  based 
on  the  National  Sleep  Foundation  guidelines,  objective  WASO 
in paramedics at baseline exceeded the healthy range (i.e., < 41 
minutes) for adults at 1.3 hours [58]. Additionally, objective TST 
was 6.2 hours at baseline, which is less than the recommended 
duration  (i.e.,  >  7  hours)  needed  for  optimal  health  [65].  Over 
the  first  6  months  of  emergency  work,  objective  TST  increased 
(6.4 hours) but remained below the recommended duration [65]. 
To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  one  of  the  first  studies  to 
describe  these  objective  sleep  parameters  in  recruit  paramed-
ics  and  track  them  over  the  first  6  months  of  emergency  work. 
Compared to studies tracking shift workers over shorter periods; 
however,  the  increase  in  objective  TST  in  recruit  paramedics  is 
inconsistent  with  research  which  has  reported  reduced  sleep 
duration during the first 5 months of work in recruit paramedics 
[24],  the  first  4  months  of  police  duty  in  new  recruits  [16]  and 
during  an  initial  deployment  to  the  fireground  in  seasonal  fire-
fighters [66]. It should be noted that while a small increase of 12 
minutes in objective TST was observed in paramedics, this find-
ing  is  not  clinically  significant  [67].  Shift  workers  in  healthcare 
compensate  for  sleep  loss  by  extending  their  sleep  duration  on 
rest days [68–70], and this behavior could have impacted the TST 
observed  among  new  shift-working  paramedics  at  the  6-month 
timepoint. Moreover, this potential work-related variability in the 
duration  of  sleep,  and  also  its  timing,  could  change  across  new 
shift  workers’  careers  and  impact  their  mental  health  [23],  but 
this was beyond the scope of the current study in paramedics and 
thus it requires further investigation in future research. The pres-
ent study provides an important insight into changes in objective 
sleep  among  recruit  paramedics  transitioning  into  emergency 
work for the first time. Further research in larger samples which 
continues  beyond  the  first  6  months  of  emergency  work  and 
incorporates  additional  sleep  parameters  (e.g.,  sleep  variability) 
and objective sleep measures, such as at-home PSG, are needed 
to confirm and extend the current findings.

Prior to emergency work, insomnia and objective WASO were 
both  positively  associated  with  depressive  and  GAD  symptoms 
among recruit paramedics. In an important step forward for this 

area,  we  also  found  baseline  insomnia  predicted  an  increase  in 
follow-up  depression,  showing  that  higher  symptoms  of  insom-
nia, even in a relatively healthy cohort with low levels of insomnia 
at baseline, increased the risk for depression. While this finding is 
novel for paramedics, and thus should be replicated with larger 
sample  sizes  and  in  other  emergency  services  to  understand 
the  generalizability  of  our  results,  the  relationship  we  observed 
between  insomnia  and  depression  is  consistent  with  previous 
studies  in  the  military  which  found  pre-deployment  insomnia 
symptoms and sleep complaints predicted increased depression 
post-deployment  [27,  61].  There  is  strong  evidence  suggesting 
that treating insomnia reduces mental health symptoms, includ-
ing  depression  and  anxiety,  in  adults  with  comorbid  sleep  and 
mental  health  problems  [71–73].  Thus,  our  findings  provide  an 
evidence-base from which to conduct further studies with larger 
sample  sizes  to  confirm  these  results  and  determine  their  gen-
eralizability  to  other  emergency  services,  as  well  as  providing 
support for future research which investigates the effectiveness 
of early interventions targeting insomnia to reduce depression in 
high-risk occupations.

Increased  objective WASO  at  baseline  predicted  higher  PTSD 
symptoms  at  the  6-month  follow-up.  Baseline  insomnia  symp-
toms, however, were not related to follow-up PTSD. This is contrary 
to prior research in the military which has shown pre-deployment 
insomnia  symptoms  and  sleep  disturbance  to  be  strong  predic-
tors  of  PTSD  symptoms  post-deployment  [27,  28,  74].  It  should 
be  noted,  of  course,  high  levels  of  WASO  are  one  of  the  major 
symptoms of insomnia [75]. In addition, WASO has been shown to 
be a marker of fragmented sleep, in particular REM sleep, and has 
been proposed as a potential mechanism underpinning the devel-
opment of PTSD [76–79]. It is therefore possible our findings high-
light WASO as a more specific marker of why insomnia conveys 
risk for PTSD. However, due to the small sample size for the PTSD 
outcome (because only participants who endorsed a potentially 
traumatic event on the LEC-5 subsequently completed the PCL-
5), further research confirming our findings is needed before they 
can be generalized to other high-risk populations. Another expla-
nation for why insomnia did not predict PTSD could be due to the 
limited range of ISI scores at baseline with very few participants 
above the community cut-off of 10, thus we had few recruits with 
clinically  relevant  insomnia  to  serve  as  a  PTSD  predictor  in  the 
current study.

No significant associations were found between baseline OSA 
risk  or  objective  sleep  duration  and  follow-up  mental  health 
symptoms  in  recruit  paramedics.  Longitudinal  research  in  the 
military  and  other  populations  also  reported  sleep  duration 
[27]  and  OSA  [80,  81]  to  be  less  consistent  predictors  of  future 
mental  health  disorders.  Compared  to  our  prior  research  that 
has  observed  a  large  percentage  of  firefighters  (29.0%)  [82]  and 
police  (33.6%)  [83]  to  be  at  risk  of  OSA,  a  much  lower  percent-
age of recruit paramedics in the current study screened at risk 
of  this  sleep  disorder. This  difference  is  presumably  due  to  the 
sample having an, on average, young age, normal BMI, and a high 
proportion of females, which are factors that have been associ-
ated  with  lower  OSA  risk  [84].  It  should  be  noted,  however,  the 
measure used to assess OSA risk (i.e., the BQ) in paramedics had 
a  Cronbach’s  alpha  (α = 0.62)  in  our  sample  which  was  lower 
than what has been observed in other emergency service-based 
research [85], indicating our results for OSA risk may have lim-
ited  reliability.  Although  the  BQ  is  a  widely  used  instrument 
that has been validated [32], specific support for the use of the 
BQ  in  shift  workers  is  limited.  For  instance,  compared  to  PSG, 
Geiger-Brown and colleagues [86] found the BQ produced a high 

proportion  of  false  negatives  in  nurses  working  full-time  shift 
work.  This  raises  some  level  of  doubt  regarding  the  use  of  the 
BQ  in  similar  healthcare  occupations,  such  as  paramedics,  and 
whether  the  low  prevalence  of  OSA  risk  in  our  study  is  accu-
rate. In addition, the limited variability in OSA risk observed in 
paramedics  at  baseline  could  have  also  impacted  our  ability 
to  detect  a  relationship  between  baseline  OSA  risk  and  mental 
health at follow-up. Furthermore, in populations at high risk of 
mental  health  issues,  it  may  be  important  to  consider  how  the 
presence of OSA in combination with other common sleep disor-
ders (e.g., insomnia) may raise the risk of depression and anxiety 
symptoms, beyond either of these disturbances in isolation [87, 
88]. Likewise, short sleep in combination with poor sleep quality 
has been shown to longitudinally predict depression in new shift 
workers [22]. The combination of short sleep and insomnia has 
also been linked to depression in the general population [89] and 
anxiety in military personnel post-deployment [27]. Although the 
combined impact of various sleep parameters on mental health 
was not investigated in the current study, it represents an impor-
tant area for further research in occupations at high risk of sleep 
problems.

There are several limitations in this study. First, the single fol-
low-up timepoint after 6 months into paramedics’ careers may 
have been too short to detect significant changes in certain men-
tal  health  outcomes,  such  as  GAD  and  PTSD,  which  remained 
low at both baseline and follow-up in recruit paramedics. Indeed, 
compared  to  their  more  experienced  counterparts,  paramedics 
in their early career are reported to have low rates of PTSD [8], 
which  could  be  explained  by  lower  cumulative  trauma  expo-
sure [56, 90], as was also observed in our study (i.e., recruits aver-
aged 1 potentially traumatic event during the 6-month period). 
These low rates of PTSD may also indicate limited variability in 
PTSD symptoms, thus our ability to detect relationships between 
timepoints  could  have  been  impacted,  as  previously  suggested 
by  Inslicht  and  colleagues  [91],  who  also  observed  low  rates  of 
PTSD in police recruits akin to those observed in our sample of 
paramedics. Furthermore, Wild and colleagues [26] report men-
tal health symptoms can have a high rate of spontaneous recov-
ery;  thus,  it  is  possible  changes  in  these  outcomes  may  have 
been  missed  in  the  current  study  due  to  the  single  follow-up 
timepoint. The use of subjective sleep and mental health meas-
ures was also a limitation of  the current study. Although these 
self-report measures are well-validated, they are not diagnostic 
tools and only assess risk for the sleep and mental health out-
comes investigated. Consequently, results may be susceptible to 
self-report bias [92] which may have further contributed to the 
low levels of mental health symptoms in the current sample of 
paramedics.  Another  limitation  related  to  the  study  measures 
was the poor internal consistency levels observed for the BQ and 
AUDIT-C, thus our findings related to OSA risk and alcohol use 
may lack reliability and should be interpreted with caution. The 
low internal consistency for these measures may indicate poor 
inter-relatedness  between  questionnaire  items  in  the  current 
sample,  and  for  the  AUDIT-C,  this  low  reliability  could  also  be 
due to the small number of items (i.e., 3) included in this meas-
ure [93]. Furthermore, although this sample of paramedics were 
similar in age and sex to other groups of recruit paramedics in 
Australia [8, 20, 25, 94], we were unable to compare these char-
acteristics  to  those  who  did  not  express  interest  in  the  study, 
thus  we  cannot  completely  rule  out  the  possibility  of  selection 
bias  in  our  sample.  Additionally,  although  data  confidentiality 
arrangements  were  thoroughly  explained  to  participants,  it  is 
possible  some  paramedics  may  have  had  concerns  about  how

the  data  might  impact  their  employment,  and  therefore  down-
played their symptoms. Considering the above limitations, future 
research  examining  sleep  and  mental  health  in  paramedics 
should adopt clinician-based assessments, particularly for PTSD 
(e.g.,  Clinician-Administered  PTSD  Scale  for  DSM-5)  [95]  which 
are  widely  considered  to  be  the  gold  standard. Another  limita-
tion in the current study was the potential impact of COVID-19 
on  data  collection.  Longitudinal  research  has  reported  a  wors-
ening  in  sleep  and  mental  health  among  healthcare  workers 
during COVID-19 [96], thus the pandemic may have introduced 
a confounding factor in the current study. However, participants 
completing data collection during COVID-19 did not have signif-
icantly  different  demographic  characteristics,  sleep  or  mental 
health symptoms to those who completed data collection before 
the  pandemic  (see  Supplementary  Material  Table  S3),  thus  the 
pandemic may not have had a major influence on our findings. 
On the other hand, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our in-person 
recruitment approach was modified to online, which negatively 
impacted the response rate and limited the study’s sample size. 
Given  the  limited  sample  size,  which  varied  between  analyses 
(i.e., n = 80–101), our results should be interpreted with caution 
and  their  generalizability  to  other  populations  of  paramedic 
and emergency service personnel requires further investigation. 
Future research incorporating larger samples, more frequent and 
longer duration follow-up timepoints, and clinician-based men-
tal  health  assessments  is  important  to  further  understand  the 
development of sleep and mental health outcomes in paramed-
ics transitioning through their early career.

Conclusion

The  present  study  provides  longitudinal  evidence  of  the  sleep 
and mental health challenges experienced by paramedics in the 
initial  months  of  their  career.  Moreover,  the  findings  highlight 
sleep  disturbances  as  potential  risk  factors  in  the  development 
of  depression  and  PTSD  among  recruit  paramedics.  Given  sleep 
is a potentially modifiable factor, these findings support the need 
for occupational health programs that identify and provide early 
interventions to vulnerable paramedics who may be at increased 
risk  of  developing  mental  health  issues  in  the  future.  Further 
research incorporating larger sample sizes is needed to replicate 
and extend the findings in this study beyond the first 6 months 
of emergency work.
