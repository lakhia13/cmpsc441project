Abstract 

Objective: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious public health problem. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) 
is  a  program  that  has  provided  encouraging  results  for  its  treatment.  However,  scientific evidence  about  its  efficacy  is 
scarce.  Therefore,  we  aimed  to  describe  the  scientific  production  on  the  components  of  the  DBT  program  and  its 
therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of people with BPD. 
Method:  A  systematic  review  with  relevant  keywords  was  conducted  based  on  studies  available  in  Scopus,  Web  of 
Science, and PubMed until June 2023, including studies in English, research on therapeutic intervention, studies with a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that included people with the diagnosis of BPD. 
Results: We found 18 RCTs, most of which supported the effectiveness of DBT for BPD. There  were a total of 1,755 
participants in these studies, most of whom were women. These studies looked for treating self-injurious behaviors, suicidal 
thoughts or ideations, number of visits to emergency services, and frequency of hospital admissions. Most studies revealed 
that both short-term DBT and standard DBT improved suicidality in BPD patients with small or moderate effect sizes, lasting 
up to 24 months after the treatment period. Furthermore, these studies showed that DBT can significantly improve general 
psychopathology and depressive symptoms in patients with BPD. Improvement of compliance, impulsivity, mood instability, 
as well as reduction in hospitalization rate are other findings observed in the trials following DBT. 
Conclusion:  Although  DBT  shows  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  BPD,  heterogeneity  in  the  methodologies  employed  is 
highlighted. Therefore, it is necessary to design studies from a homogeneous theoretical and methodological framework.

Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  constitutes  a 

serious health problem due to the severity of symptoms, 
the  presence  of  comorbidities,  and  the  recurrence  of 
treatment  dropouts,  which  have  a  significant  impact  on 
the  overall  functioning  of  the  person,  complicating  the 
work of multidisciplinary teams and the management of 
health  services  (1,  2).  Statistical  indicators  confirm  the 
severity of this health problem, with the global prevalence 
estimated  at  2%  in  the  general  population,  3%  in 
adolescents,  and  1.5%  in  adults  (3,  4).  The  range  of 
prevalence  is  also  established  at  15%  to  28%  among 
hospitalized  patients  and  users  of  outpatient  psychiatric 
care (5). BPD exhibits a variety of symptoms, including 
emotional  instability,  altered  self-image,  feelings  of 
worthlessness, impulsivity, micropsychotic episodes, fear 
of abandonment, self-injurious behaviors, and attempts to 
diminish  the  self  (6,  7).  Previous  neuroimaging  studies 
have  suggested that dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex 
may  contribute  to  impulsivity  and  unstable  emotional 
symptoms  in  patients  with  BPD  (8,  9).  The  literature 
shows that about 70% of individuals diagnosed with BPD 
engage in self-harming behaviors, and the suicide rate in 
these patients is about 50 times higher than in the general 
population (3, 10). Therefore, this disorder is associated 
with a high disease burden for the individual, family and 
society,  which  doubles  the  need  for  effective  treatment 
(11).  In  this  regard,  the  role  of  psychotherapy  as  a 
fundamental tool for the treatment of BPD is valued (12). 
While the paradigms of classical and operant conditioning 
in  the  1950s  and  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  in  the 
1970s were established as the first and second generation 
therapies,  respectively,  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy 
(DBT) belongs to the third-generation therapies; this third 
generation  also  includes  acceptance  and  commitment 
models,  behavioral  activation,  and  mindfulness-based 
stress reduction (13). 
DBT  is  one  of  the  programs  that  provides  promising 
results in the treatment of BPD because it integrates the 
tools of individual format, development of interpersonal 
skills,  telephone  calls  in  crisis  and  periodic  monitoring 
sessions;  in  addition,  DBT  incorporates  elements  from 
cognitive  and  behavioral  approaches,  while  also 
employing  dialectical  philosophical  approaches  for  the 
acceptance  of  suffering  (14).  DBT  follows  a  biosocial 
model that conceives BPD as a disorder of the emotion 
regulation  system  that  activates  a  behavioral  pattern  of 
instability  as  a  coping  mechanism  and  proposes  four 
guiding skills as its fundamental learning goal: awareness, 
interpersonal  effectiveness,  emotion  regulation,  and 
discomfort  tolerance  (15).  The  therapeutic  benefits  of 
DBT  are  supported  by  empirical  evidence  and  research 
which support its effectiveness in reducing self-injurious 
behaviors, self-harm attempts, suicidal thoughts, as well 
as  behaviors  associated  with  depression  or  bulimia 
nervosa  (16,  17).  However,  the  broad  clinical  spectrum 
and  the  variables  involved  in  the  treatment  process  for 
BPD  (e.g.,  the  quality  of  the  therapeutic  relationship, 

pharmacological  adherence,  comorbidities,  dropout  or 
dropout  rates,  among  others),  necessitate  a  thorough 
analysis of the DBT program to identify the value of its 
components  and  its  therapeutic  contribution  in  the 
recovery  of  people  who  present  such  diagnosis. 
Previously,  some  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses 
have been published on this topic, two of which date back 
to 2010 and 2014 (18, 19). Considering the publication of 
several original articles after 2014, it seems necessary to 
review  the  latest  scientific  evidence  to  investigate  the 
effects  of  DBT  on  BPD.  Oud  et  al.  systematically 
reviewed all psychotherapies for adults with BPD, and the 
lack of focus on DBT made this study a non-exhaustive 
review of the effects of various aspects of DBT on BPD 
(20).  On  the  other  hand,  another  meta-analysis  study 
evaluated  only  some  limited  outcomes  of  this  type  of 
treatment  on  BPD  (21). Therefore,  at  present,  scientific 
production  on  the  subject  is  both  scarce  and  dispersed; 
thus, in the current context of momentum, as well as the 
it  is 
development  of  new  therapeutic  approaches, 
important to systematize the clinical evidence of DBT for 
its potential contribution  in  the clinical  improvement of 
people with BPD. 

Materials and Methods 
This is a systematic review based on PRISMA guideline 
that  compiles  the  scientific  evidence  on  the  efficacy  of 
DBT in people with BPD. In order to meet the objective, 
a search of the  existing literature  was carried out in the 
main  databases  including  Scopus,  Web  of  Science,  and 
PubMed.  English  descriptors  were  used  for  borderline 
personality disorder (BPD), dialectical behavior therapy 
(DBT), and experimental design (RCT), with adjustments 
made for searching in the title, abstract and keywords for 
Scopus  and  Web  of  Science.  For  PubMed,  the  search 
included  the  title,  abstract  and  mesh  words.  The  search 
strategies were endorsed by a specialized consultant. The 
inclusion criteria were articles published between January 
2000  and  June  2023  in  English  that  applied  an 
experimental design  with a control group and a  random 
assignment.  In  addition,  the  original  articles  had  to 
include people with the diagnosis of BPD, aged 18 years 
or older. 
Of  the  articles  found  after  applying  the  exclusion  and 
inclusion criteria and after eliminating duplicate articles, 
quasi-experimental,  non-randomized,  empirical  studies 
and  those  that  were  outside  the  time  range,  the  final 
sample consisted of 18 papers for analysis. This process 
was  done  by  screening  the  title  and  abstract  of  the 
citations and evaluating the full text independently by two 
experts.  To  help  limit  bias  in  this  review  and  in  the 
interpretation  of  findings,  two  experts  evaluated  the 
quality of eligible studies through Consolidated Standards 
of  Reporting  Trials  (CONSORT)  checklist  (22).  This 
checklist has 25 items related to methodology, findings, 
and  discussion  (23-25).  Each  item  in  CONSORT  has  1 
score,  and  therefore,  each  study  received  a  total  quality 
score  based  on  this  checklist,  and  any  original  study

whose quality score was less than 12 was excluded from 
our study. Data extraction from eligible studies was then 
performed  by  creating  a  data  sheet  in  Excel  containing 

columns for authors, publication date, country, number of 
participants,  mean  age,  sex,  DBT  protocol,  outcome 
measures, assessment times, and main findings.

Results 
The process of searching online scientific databases made 
it possible to find 673 articles in Scopus, 586 in Web of 
Science, and 370 in PubMed (N =  1629 in total). From 
these  articles,  pseudo-experimental,  non-randomized, 
experimental  and  those  conducted  outside  the  search 
period  (N  =  1611)  were  excluded,  leaving  the  sample 
comprising  several  RCTs  (n  =  18)  (26-43)  that  met  the 
criteria set forth in the present research (Figure 1). Some 
studies  contained  repeated  trials  with  the  same  study 
population and were therefore excluded from the current 
study. Since all studies received a minimum score of 12 
in the quality assessment, all 18 studies were included in 
our  review.  Most  studies  described  the  reasons  for 

dropout  and  conducted  intentional  analysis,  leading  to 
appropriate data integrity. As shown in Figure 2, most of 
the eligible studies (7/18) were conducted in the United 
States. A total of 1,755 individuals participated in these 
studies, most of whom were women. Table 1 summarizes 
the details of the selected research on the efficacy of DBT 
in people with BPD. In all the studies, the participants had 
a  diagnosis  of  BPD,  except  for  one  study  in  which  the 
participants were BPD patients with post-traumatic stress 
disorder  (36).  Only  in  the  study  (26),  the  participants 
included BPD inpatients, while other studies treated BPD 
outpatients. The activities have been mainly developed in 
clinical or healthcare contexts, with the exception of the 
few  studies  conducted  with  students  on  campus.  In  the

intervention  groups,  eight  studies  utilized  a  short-term 
DBT  protocol  (28,  33,  34,  39-43)  and  the  rest  utilized 
standard DBT. In the control groups, six studies utilized 
usual care (28, 31, 33, 37, 40, 43), and 10 studies utilized 
non-DBT,  such  as  cognitive  processing  therapy  or 
community treatment. Linehan et al. compared a standard 
DBT group with DBT skills training and DBT individual 
therapy  groups  (32),  and  MaMain  et  al.  compared  a 
standard DBT group with a short-term DBT group (34). 
Regarding  the  outcome  measures,  the  units  of  analysis 
mainly  focused  on  self-injurious  behaviors,  suicidal 
thoughts or ideations, the number of visits to emergency 
services,  as  well  as  the  frequency  of  hospitalizations. 
However, a variety of questionnaires and scales were used 
to assess the effects of various aspects of DBT on BPD. 
Among the  RCTs reviewed, six studies  (26, 28, 30, 37, 
38, 43) had no follow-up to assess post-DBT effects on 
patients, and the remaining 12 studies had a follow-up of 
3  to  24  months.  Most  trials  reported  small  to  moderate 
effect  sizes  of  DBT  on  BPD.  McMinn  et  al.  reported 

individual 

moderate to large effect sizes for DBT on BPD symptoms 
(30). However, two studies failed to observe a significant 
improvement in BPD symptoms after DBT treatment (40, 
41). The most effective area of DBT was on self-harm and 
suicidal behavior of BPD patients. Indeed,  most studies 
found  that  both  short-term  DBT  and  standard  DBT 
improved  suicidality  in  BPD  patients  with  small  or 
moderate  effect  sizes,  lasting  up  to  24  months  after  the 
treatment  period.  Linehan  et  al.  even  demonstrated  that 
DBT 
improve 
suicidal  behaviors  in  these  patients  (32).  Furthermore, 
these  studies  indicated  that  DBT  can  significantly 
improve  general  psychopathology  and  depressive 
symptoms in patients with BPD. However, some studies 
reported  that  DBT  was  not  superior  to  other  active 
psychological  interventions  such  as  general  psychiatric 
management 
compliance, 
impulsivity, and mood instability, as well as reduction of 
hospitalization  rate  are  other  findings  observed  in  the 
trials applying DBT.

Discussion 
In  this  review,  we  systematically  searched  for  evidence 
on the efficacy of DBT for BPD. A total of 18 RCTs were 
reviewed  in  this  study.  In  general,  the  findings  of  these 
studies support the effectiveness of DBT for patients with 
BPD.  Our  systematic  review  found  that  DBT  alleviates 
suicidality and self-injurious behaviors in BPD patients, 
which is consistent with previous reviews (18-21). Self-
injurious  behaviors  in  BPD  constitute  an  important 
concern.  Different  mechanisms  of  change  have  been 
mentioned by these studies to elucidate the DBT effects 
on  BPD  symptoms.  Some  studies  have  suggested  that 
improvements 
in  behavioral  control  and  emotion 
regulation are associated with better outcomes in patients 

with BPD (34, 43). BPD may be considered an emotion 
regulation  disorder,  and  these  RCTs  studying  it,  either 
indirectly or in combination with other factors, are a good 
indication  that  improvements  in  emotion  regulation  are 
part of the answer to how DBT reduces BPD symptoms. 
However, it should be noted that improvement in emotion 
regulation is more of an outcome rather than a therapeutic 
approach  or  tool.  In  addition,  the  use  of  therapeutic 
modality skills and skills training  may play an essential 
role  in  the  BPD  treatment  outcomes  through  DBT. 
Linehan et al. showed that DBT skills training was more 
effective in improving self-injurious behaviors compared 
to  DBT  individual  therapy  without  skills  training  (32). 
Latest evidence has supported the mediating role of DBT

skills training in the relationship between baseline  level 
of predictors such as emotion regulation difficulties and 
outcomes such as self-harm and BPD symptoms (44, 45). 
Overall, improvements in mindfulness skills, particularly 
nonjudgmental  acceptance,  appear  to  have  a  substantial 
effect  on  various  treatment  outcomes  in  BPD  patients 
receiving DBT. This effect may result from the fact that 
nonjudgmental  acceptance  helps  people  cope  with 
feelings of shame and diminishes the inclination to judge 
and then act to avoid symptomatic manifestations such as 
self-harm (46).  
On the other hand, mindfulness skills, as one of the main 
four  skills  training  modalities  in  DBT,  help  people 
develop  positive  physical  and  emotional  responses  to 
stressful  situations  that  improve  their  depressed  mood 
(47). This  is  consistent  with  our  findings  that  DBT  can 
improve  depressive  symptoms  in  patients  with  BPD.  In 
addition,  the  therapeutic  alliance  as  an  interpersonal 
factor  may  be  another  mechanism  of  change  in  BPD 
symptoms  in  patients  receiving  DBT.  Linehan  et  al. 
indicated  that  treatment  approaches  that  foster  a  more 
favorable  therapeutic  relationship  are  associated  with 
better suicidality outcomes (29). However, some studies 
do not agree that the therapeutic alliance is a mechanism 
of change in DBT (44). From a public health perspective, 
DBT helps improve the person’s quality of life with BPD 
and  strengthens  the  management  of  mental  health 
professional  teams.  Two  forms  of  DBT  (i.e.,  individual 
the  development  of 
and  group 
psychosocial  and  motivational  skills  that  help  promote 
adaptive  and  functional  behaviors  (32).  Meanwhile,  the 
neural  correlates  of  BPD  and  its  changes  during  the 
course of DBT cannot be ignored. Indeed, it is reasonable 
to expect that changes in the neural networks of the brain 
involved in emotion regulation will finally be necessary 
for  treatment  change  in  DBT.  In  this  regard,  several 
studies have reported neurophysiological changes such as 
reduced  activity  of  the  amygdala  and  other  brain  areas 
involved in emotion regulation in BPD patients after DBT 
treatment  (48,  49).  However,  these  studies  provide 
preliminary  evidence  that  needs  to  be  replicated  and 
confirmed in future studies. 
A point to be noted here is the existence of heterogeneity 
between the reviewed studies. In relation to the selection 
of 
the  sociodemographic  and  clinical 
characteristics  of  the  participants  were  heterogeneous 
among  the  studies.  Although  the  activities  were  mainly 
developed in clinical or healthcare contexts, some trials 
were conducted on students in university campuses. One 
study  recruited  participants  from  inpatients,  while  the 
other  studies  recruited  participants  from  outpatients. 
Furthermore,  the  gender  composition  varied  widely 
among  studies,  from  trials  with  only  female  patients  to 
trials with 38% female participants. The selection of the 
sample  size,  the  characteristics  of  the  interventions 
applied to the control group, the difficulty in establishing 
equivalent  comparison  criteria  between  the  different 

therapy)  promote 

the  sample, 

subcomponents  of  the  therapeutic  programs  are  also 
questionable. 

Future Directions 
Generally,  the  methodological  quality  of  the  eligible 
RCTs  was  moderate.  Therefore,  high-quality  RCTs  are 
required on this topic for future research. All trials so far 
have  been  conducted  on  adult  patients,  and  the  vast 
majority of subjects are women. Therefore, further studies 
are  needed  to  elucidate  the  effects  of  age  and  gender 
variables on the mechanisms of DBT change. In addition 
to designing protocols to compare the therapeutic efficacy 
of DBT on the basis of a homogeneous  methodological 
framework  that  evaluates  the  contribution  of  each 
subprogram  in  the  clinical  improvement  of  BPD,  the 
major challenge for further research will be the possibility 
of efficiently implementing this therapeutic approach to 
local care contexts. 

Limitation 
Lack  of  access  to  other  scientific  databases  (such  as 
PsycInfo and ProQuest) limited our search to retrieve all 
related  articles.  In  addition,  the  heterogeneity  of  scales 
and  instruments  measuring  outcomes  in  original  studies 
made the meta-analysis very difficult. Therefore, the lack 
of meta-analysis is one of the important limitations of this 
study. On the other hand, the strength of our study is to 
include  only  experimental  studies  with  an  RCT  design, 
which contributes to the scientific quality of the present 
research. 

Conclusion 
DBT  promotes  the  formation  of  psychosocial  and 
motivational  skills.  It  employs  evaluation  protocols, 
individual  and  group  therapy,  telephone  contact,  and 
follow-up, with strategies based on a proposal for change 
within the context of the dialectical acceptance of reality. 
DBT  provides  an  optimal  therapeutic  response  in  the 
reduction  of  self-injurious  behaviors,  suicidal  thoughts 
and  attempts,  the  frequency  of  emergency  care  and 
hospitalizations  in  BPD,  which  constitutes  a  valuable 
contribution  from  a  public  health  perspective.  The 
challenge for further research will be to design protocols 
that  compare  the  efficacy  of  DBT  on  the  basis  of  a 
homogeneous  methodological  framework  that  evaluates 
the  contribution  of  each  subprogram  in  the  clinical 
improvement  of  BPD  and  to  efficiently  implement  its 
application to local care contexts.
