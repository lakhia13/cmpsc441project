Objective: This study explores researches of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) 
in mental health to provide an overview of current knowledge landscape and 
predict future development trends of DBT.

Method:  The  bibliometric  approach  was  used  in  the  study.  Articles  on  DBT-
related  research  were  retrieved  from  the  Web  of  Science  Core  Collection 
(WoSCC)  database  up  to  December  31,  2024,  and  analyzed  using  VOSviewer 
and CiteSpace.

Results:  A  total  of  2,723  articles  were  analyzed.  DBT  research  has  grown 
significantly  since  the  1990s,  with  the  United  States  leading  in  publication 
volume,  citation  impact,  and  academic  collaboration.  Research  is  primarily 
conducted in developed countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and Germany, with limited contributions from emerging economies. Cognitive 
and Behavioral Practice is the most prolific journal in DBT research. Key topics 
include borderline personality disorder (BPD), suicide, adolescent interventions, 
forensic  psychiatry,  and  family  therapy.  Recently,  keywords  such  as  “emotion 
dysregulation” and “mobile phone” have become research hotspots.

Conclusion: DBT research has evolved from early focus areas like BPD and suicide 
to studies on emotion dysregulation mechanisms and digital interventions. While 
the United States dominates the field, expanding participation from emerging 
countries and strengthening global collaboration could advance DBT research 
and  improve  mental  health  accessibility.  This  bibliometric  analysis  provides  a 
global perspective and long-term trend insights, highlighting future directions 
in neurobiological mechanisms, methodological innovation, and technological 
integration.

Introduction

Dialectical  behavior  therapy  (DBT)  is  one  of  the  leading  approaches  for  treating 
individuals bearing borderline personality disorder (BPD) and self-harm or suicidal behaviors, 
which  is  originally  developed  by  Linehan  (Bloom  et  al.,  2012;  Lammers  et  al.,  2022; 
MacPherson  et  al.,  2013).  DBT  blends  cognitive-behavioral  approaches  with  practices 
embodied by the dialectical thinking of Zen, in which the dialectical balance of acceptance 
and changes and relationship between normal and abnormal psychology and behavior is

emphasized (Liang et al., 2021; Lynch et al., 2006). The standard DBT 
has  multicomponent  including  weekly  individual  therapy,  weekly 
group skills training, as-needed between-session telephone coaching 
and  weekly  therapist  consultation  team  meetings  (Linehan  et  al., 
2015).  Individual  therapy  targets  the  aforementioned  hierarchy  of 
behaviors occurring either in session or reported on the clients record 
daily card (Rizvi et al., 2013). Groups are devoted to homework review 
and teaching new skills, i.e., mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion 
regulation and interpersonal effectiveness (MacPherson et al., 2013). 
Telephone coaching calls are encouraged if clients are experiencing 
suicide or self-injurious urges, they need help utilizing skills or there 
is a rupture in the therapeutic relationship. Therapist consultation 
team meetings hold therapists within the therapeutic frame, balance 
therapists’ interactions with clients, address problems that arise in 
treatment,  increase  adherence  to  DBT  principles,  and  increase 
therapists’ motivation and capabilities in delivering DBT (MacPherson 
et  al.,  2013).  These  modes  can  reduce  individuals’  dysfunctional 
behaviors  when  they  are  encountering  the  dysregulated  emotion 
(MacPherson et al., 2013).

Based on the DBT theory, the underlying problem is pervasive 
emotion regulation (i.e., sensitivity to emotional stimuli, intensity of 
emotional  reactions,  and  inability  to  regulate  negative  affective 
responses),  which  leads  to  impulsive  and  maladaptive  behaviors 
(Asarnow et al., 2021; DeCou et al., 2019). DBT targets the common 
underlying dysfunctional emotion regulation among the psychiatric 
disorders and problem behaviors, such as BPD, depression, anxiety 
disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disorders (ED), 
suicidal behaviors, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) (Bohus et al., 
2020; Lammers et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2021; Snoek et al., 2020). Studies 
of DBT for BPD found a low overall dropout rate (27.3%) and moderate 
before-and-after effect sizes for global outcomes as well as suicidal and 
self-injurious behaviors (Kliem et al., 2010). DBT is the only treatment 
with sufficient replication to be considered evidence based for BPD 
(Binks et al., 2006). DBT prioritizes suicidal behavior and other self-
directed violence as the primary treatment targets, indicating its clinical 
implications on suicidal behavior over suicidal thoughts (DeCou et al., 
2019). DBT is effective in reducing binge ED behaviors, however, less 
efficacy assertions can be made about DBT with those diagnosed with 
bulimia nervosa or anorexia-nervosa (Bankoff et al., 2012; Ben-Porath 
et al., 2020). In addition, one of DBT components-skills training group-
reduced BPD symptoms and emergency department presentations of 
people with BPD (Heerebrand et al., 2021). DBT is effective for reducing 
suicide attempts and NSSI episodes, meanwhile, DBT skills training are 
more  effective  than  DBT  individual  therapy,  and  standard  DBT  is 
superior  in  some  areas  (Linehan  et  al.,  2015).  DBT  for  adolescent 
(DBT-A) has been adapted with various psychiatric disorders (i.e., BPD, 
mood  disorders,  externalizing  disorders,  ED,  trichotillomania)  and 
problem behaviors (i.e., suicide ideation and behavior, NSSI) across 
several settings (i.e., outpatient, day program, inpatient, residential, 
correctional facility) (Kothgassner et al., 2021; MacPherson et al., 2013).
Although multiple reviews and meta-analyses have summarized the 
application and effectiveness of DBT in clinical settings, as well as its 
improvements and innovations, mechanism research, adaptation and 
dissemination,  and  factors  related  to  skills  training  and  therapist 
performance (Asarnow et al., 2021; Heerebrand et al., 2021; Linehan 
et al., 2015; McCauley et al., 2018), as far as we know, studies of DBT have 
not emerged by means of bibliometrics after many years of advancements 
to provide an overview of temporal trends in this field. Bibliometrics is a 

quantitative method to statistically analyze studies to evaluate the impact 
of institutions, countries and authors, which is widely used to map and 
describe performance in particular fields, and predict the development 
of specific fields (Ninkov et al., 2022). To fill this knowledge gap, this 
study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis of DBT publications to 
reveal major contributors, current research status, the research trends 
and future development prospects from a general perspective.

Methods

Data search and retrieval strategy

In this study, the relevant literature was searched and exported in 
the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database from inception 
to December 31, 2024. We selected Thematic Suffix (TS) for retrieval. 
Specific search strategy was conducted as follows: (1) TS = (dialectical 
behavior therapy OR Behavior Therapy, Dialectical OR Dialectical 
Behavior Therapies). (2) Only articles and reviews were included, while 
other document types such as meeting abstracts, letters, book reviews, 
and corrections were excluded. (3) All contents, including title, author, 
abstract, keywords, and cited literature, were recorded. (4) The search 
was limited to publications in English language and those on the topic.
Two authors independently verified the data collection and entry. 
Disagreements were resolved by the third author to reach a consensus. 
After excluding 239 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 
631 journals, 2,723 papers, and 77,221cited references from 2,846 
institutions across 67 countries were eligible for analysis.

Data analysis and visualization

VOSviewer  (Leiden  University,  Leiden,  The  Netherlands, 
VOSviewer  version  1.6.19)  and  CiteSpace  (Drexel  University, 
United States, CiteSpace 6.2.R4) were used to analyze and visualize all 
the bibliographic data of the selected publications including authors, 
institutions, journals, countries, references, and keywords. In this study, 
VOSviewer  was  used  to  perform  (1)  a  co-authorship  network  that 
explored the authors’, their institutions’ and their countries’ collaboration 
networks and (2) co-occurrence network that reflected the associations 
between  authors’  keyworks.  CiteSpace  can  obtain  quantitative 
information and discover relevant developments and trends in specific 
scientific research fields with loaded burst and cluster analyses mode. In 
this study, it was used to analyze and visualize the keyword co-citation 
clusters, timeline view of clusters, and the citation bursts. Co-occurrence 
analysis  is  a  method  used  to  discover  patterns  and  associations  of 
co-occurrence between terms or keywords. By analyzing the frequency 
and patterns of co-occurrence of terms or keywords in documents, it 
can reveal the relevance and patterns of association between these terms 
or keywords. The graphs were created by the abovementioned software.

research articles on DBT has increased rapidly in the past two decades, 
from 1 publication in 1998 to 249 publications in 2021 (accounting for 
11.32%  of  the  total  publications).  Figure  1  shows  the  number  of 
annual publications. There was an explosive growth from 2015 (138 
publications) to 2021 (249 publications). The other obvious increase 
was seen from 2007 (53 publications) to 2014 (103 publications). The 
number of citations showed a rapid growth trend after 2007, reaching 
the high point in 2021 (11,094 citations). There was a slight drop in 
the number of citations in 2022 (10,196 citations). From 2022 to 2024, 
the number of publications and citations tended to level off.

Analysis of countries

The total number of publications related to DBT originated from 
67  identified  countries  (the  minimum  number  of  studies  from  a 
country was over five). Figure 2A shows the number of publications, 
average  citation  and  H-index  in  the  top  five  countries.  The 
United States had the highest number with 1,320 articles, accounting 
for  48.49%.  Germany  (307,  11.28%),  the  United  Kingdom  (276, 
10.14%),  and  Canada  (248,  9.11%)  ranked  second  to  fourth.  The 
United  Kingdom  had  the  highest  average  citation  of  each  article 
(68,704 citations). The highest ratio of citation and publication was 
seen in Sweden (61.88%), the United Kingdom and the United States 
ranked the second (59.78%) and third (52.05%) respectively. The other 
top five countries had relatively low ratio of citation and publication, 
specifically, 47.26% for Netherlands, 40.52% for Germany and 38.41% 
for Italy (Supplementary Table 1). Figure 2B shows the cooperation 
network  among  different  countries.  United  States  had  close 
co-operations with Canada, Germany and United Kingdom, and close 
relationship was seen among United Kingdom and Germany as well. 
The top five countries with the greatest total link strengths were as 
follows: United States (370), Germany (208), United Kingdom (200), 
Canada  (143)  and  Switzerland  (120).  Countries  in  Europe,  and 

United States and countries in Europe communicated most, the North 
America  and  Europe  cooperated  more  as  well,  while  countries  in 
Africa and South America had no communication with others.

Analysis of institutions

The publications in 2,846 identified institutions (the minimum 
number  of  publications  from  an  institution  was  over  five)  were 
analyzed  by  VOSviewer.  Figure  3A  shows  the  time  trend  of 
cooperative relationships among different institutions. University of 
Washington, Stanford University, Columbia University, University of 
Pittsburgh and University of Amsterdam focused on DBT earlier, 
while  King’s  College  London,  University  of  Melbourne  and 
Heidelberg University began focusing on DBT recently. As Figure 3B 
shows  that  University  of  Washington  had  the  highest  number  of 
publications (172), followed by the University of Washington Seattle 
(169) and Harvard University (154), with 12,826 citations, 12,768 
citations and 4,698 citations, respectively. The top five institutions 
with the greatest total link strengths were as follows: University of 
Washington  (17,391),  Duke  University  (4,949),  the  University  of 
Toronto  (4,457),  Heidelberg  University  (4,083),  and  Stanford 
University (3,702). The ratio of citation and publication for University 
of  Washington  Seattle  was  the  highest  (76.00%),  the  second  for 
University  of  Washington  (75.45%),  which  was  relatively  low  for 
Harvard University (32.63%) (Supplementary Table 2).

Analysis of researchers

8,915 authors were identified (the minimum number of publications 
from an author was over five), and their publications were analyzed by 
VOSviewer. Figure 4 shows the author network of close co-operations, 
and  there  were  more  than  10  cooperative  clusters  among  different

Bohus, Martin. The top five authors with the greatest total link strengths 
are:  Bohus,  Martin  (235  times),  Schmahl,  Christian  (201  times), 
Linehan, Marsha M. (188 times), Soler, Joaquim (174 times), and Steil, 
Regina  (171  times).  Linehan,  Marsha  M  has  published  the  highest 
number of articles in the DBT field (66 articles), followed by Bohus, 

Martin (46 articles) and Rizvi, Shireen L. (41 articles) (Table 1). Two 
partnership clusters with the core authors of Linehan, Marsha M and 
Bohus, Martin started studies on DBT nearly between 1990 and 2000, 
and new co-authors are cooperating with authors in these two clusters. 
New authors network emerged in recent years (about 2020), Marco JH 
and  Garcia-palacios  A,  Jorgensen  MS,  Simonsen  E  and  Stoffer-

Analysis of journals

Analysis of keywords

The journal was included if the minimum number of citations 
from a source was over 20 times. There were 631 journals that met 
the criteria. Cognitive and Behavioral Practice published the most 
articles on DBT with 93 publications (Supplementary Table 3). 
Journal  of  consulting  and  clinical  psychology  had  the  highest 
average  citations  per  article  (124.46).  Behavior  research  and 
therapy published the most articles on DBT and had the largest 
number of total citations with 3,818 (Supplementary Table 4).

Analysis of co-cited references

A total of 675 references (the minimum number of citations 
of  a  reference  was  over  20  times)  were  analyzed  by  using 
VOSviewer. Figure 5 showed the visualization network of clusters 
with the colors representing clusters, and there were six clusters 
of co-cited references. Supplementary Table 5 shows the top 10 of 
2,723 tabulated references which the number of co-cites was more 
than 1,000. Among the top 10 most frequently co-cited articles, 
four of these ten articles listed were published in journals with 
impact  factors  (IF)  more  than  10.  Five  of  these  articles  are 
randomized trials. Two of these articles focused on adolescents’ 
self-harm  behaviors,  while  others  mostly 
suicide  and 
focused on BPD.

Analysis of keywords is to determine research areas and hot 
issues, an important indicator to track scientific development. 
The  keywords  (the  minimum  number  of  occurrences  of  a 
keyword was over five) were analyzed by CiteSpace. A total of 
3,602  identified  keywords  were  analyzed,  and  there  were 
including  BPD,  ED,  PTSD,  Emotion 
seventeen  clusters 
Regulation, NSSI, ADHD, Emotion Dysregulation, Acceptance 
and  Commitment  Therapy,  Mood  Disorders,  Group 
Psychotherapy, Randomized Controlled Trial, Family Therapy, 
Substance Use Disorders, Evidence-based Treatment, Forensic 
Psychiatry,  Case  Formulation,  Clinical  Training  (Figure  6A). 
Figure  6B  further  shown  the  timespan  of  documents  in  each 
cluster.  The  research  on  efficacy  of  medications  were  studied 
earliest, mainly in the 1990s. Later, BPD and suicide/self-harm in 
adolescents were the research hotspots. In recent years, authors 
mainly focused on mechanisms of DBT and disorders (such as 
emotion regulation), and intervention strategies. The keywords 
with  the  top  three  occurrences  were  “suicide,”  “emotion 
regulation” and “psychotherapy,” as shown in Figure 6C. Twenty-
five  keywords  with  strong  citation  bursts  in  the  DBT  were 
identified by CiteSpace and indicated research trends. Citation 
bursts for keywords appeared as early as 1987. The bursts strength 
of these 25 keywords ranged from 2.25 to 6.25, and endurance 
strength was from 2 to 14 years.

Discussion

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  using 
bibliometrics  to  summarize  and  describe  the  current  knowledge 
landscape and predict future development trends of DBT field from 

1987 to 2024. Articles on DBT showed a growing trend over the past 
decades, particularly since 2007 and 2015, respectively. One of the 
potential reasons for the expansion of the research might be due to the 
increase on the recognition and occurrence of personality disorders, 
depression,  ED,  PTSD,  suicide,  self-harm  behaviors,  and  high-risk

behaviors among adolescents (Bohus et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; 
Kothgassner et al., 2021; Lammers et al., 2022; Leichsenring et al., 2023; 
Liang et al., 2021; Park and Kim, 2022; Stoffers-Winterling et al., 2022). 
Another  reason  might  be  the  recognition  that  DBT  and  these 
psychiatric  disorders  shared  common  mechanism  of  emotion 
dysfunctions  (Asarnow  et  al.,  2021;  Ben-Porath  et  al.,  2020).  The 
number of DBT-related publications continued to increase in 2020 and 
2021, possibly due to the peak in extensive exploration of this therapy 
across various diseases and fields. However, the decrease in 2022 and 
2023 reflects a transition in DBT research from a phase of rapid growth 
to a relatively stable stage, as its intervention methods have gradually 
matured, and its scope of application and research domains have been 
largely established. This may have led to a gradual reduction in new 
research topics.

Regional disparities and cross-cultural 
adaptation

The regional disparity in DBT research is significant, with a strong 
concentration in developed countries, particularly the United States. 
In  this  bibliometric  analysis,  most  articles  were  authored  by 
corresponding  authors  from  the  United  States,  United  Kingdom, 

Germany, Canada, and Australia. Similar patterns have been observed 
in  bibliometric  studies  in  other  fields,  such  as  schizophrenia  and 
depression  (Sun  et  al.,  2022;  Wang  et  al.,  2021).  This  might 
be  influenced  by  economic  status,  academic  resources,  cultural 
compatibility, and emphasizing on mental health. The United States, 
supported by its economic capacity and its status as the birthplace of 
DBT,  has  become  the  central  hub  of  this  field,  forming  strong 
academic  collaborations  with  countries  like  the  United  Kingdom, 
Germany, and Canada. In contrast, developing and underdeveloped 
regions face constraints due to limited resources and lower societal 
attention to mental health issues, restricting the scale and impact of 
DBT research. Additionally, the multidisciplinary nature and high 
specialization required for DBT further exacerbate the imbalance in 
research distribution (Kiraz, 2020).

In cross-cultural research on DBT, a systematic review found that 
half of studies focused on cultural adaptations for people of color and 
communities in the United States, with most adaptations involving 
modifications to language, metaphors, methods, and context (Haft 
et al., 2022). Different countries demonstrated unique localization 
characteristics during the adaptation process. For example, China 
adjusted the interpersonal effectiveness module to align with indirect 
communication styles and collectivist culture (Lammers et al., 2022). 
India  integrated  mindfulness  skills  with  traditional  yoga  and

Buddhist practices (Grover et al., 2018). Brazil focused on developing 
community-based group therapy approaches (Moritz et al., 2021). 
Enhancing global collaboration, promoting localized adaptations of 
DBT,  and  increasing  funding  and  technical  support  in  resource-
limited regions are essential to narrow this gap and achieve more 
balanced global development of DBT research.

Leading institutions, journal platforms and 
collaborative opportunities

The University of Washington and Harvard University hold a 
leading position in this field. This is partly attributed to the fact that 
DBT  originated  in  the  United  States  (Linehan  et  al.,  2015). 
Additionally, these institutions maintain close collaborations with 
European institutions, forming central academic networks. However, 
emerging  countries  like  China  still  have  limited  participation  in 
global  DBT  research,  partly  due  to  language  barriers  and  the 
dominance of English-language high-impact articles in databases like 
Web of Science. Analyzing the characteristics of international peer-
reviewed  journals  is  helpful  for  understanding  current  research 
trends (Wu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020).

Cognitive  and  Behavioral  Practice  has  become  an  important 
platform  for  DBT  research,  closely  aligning  with  its  focus  on 
innovative applications and clinical practices of cognitive-behavioral 
therapy. DBT emerged in the early 1990s, and Cognitive and Behavioral 

Practice was founded in 1994, with their timelines nearly coinciding.1 
The treatment model and practical nature of DBT complement the 
journal’s orientation, leading to the publication of numerous DBT 
research articles in this journal. The co-authorship between authors is 
instrumental  in  exploring  existing  collaborations  and  identifying 
potential  collaborators  (Sun  et  al.,  2022).  Core  authors,  such  as 
Linehan, Marsha M and Bohus, Martin, exhibit significant centrality 
within their clusters, indicating their leadership roles in DBT research. 
Collaborative  networks  between  core  authors,  such  as  Schmahl, 
Christian, demonstrate close connections, reflecting active academic 
exchanges and synergies among researchers. In recent years, emerging 
authors  have  gradually 
joined  these  collaborative  networks, 
showcasing the ongoing vitality and growing appeal of the DBT field.

Trends and future directions

The co-occurrence analysis of keywords could show the closeness 
and  prevalence  of  research  topics  in  scientific  areas  (Deng  et  al., 
2020),  while  burst  detection  analysis  serves  as  a  vital  tool  for 
exploring the evolution of research hotspots. From 1987 to 2024,

DBT  research  focus  has  undergone  significant  transformations. 
Research primarily centered on the treatment effectiveness of DBT in 
various disorders, such as from 1987 to 2024, DBT research focus has 
undergone significant transformations. Research primarily centered 
on the treatment effectiveness of DBT in various disorders, such as 
BPD,  and  suicidal  and  self-injurious  behaviors  in  the  early  stage 
(1987–2010)  (Binks  et  al.,  2006;  Kliem  et  al.,  2010).  During  the 
mid-stage (2010–2020), Research also began to emphasize DBT’s 
application to specific populations, such as tailored interventions for 
adolescents, Studies expanded to include substance abuse, ED, and 
therapeutic relationships (Carter et al., 2020; McCauley et al., 2018; 
Steuwe  et  al.,  2023;  Warner  and  Murphy,  2022).  This  period 
highlighted the optimization of DBT techniques in several ways: (1) 
changes in treatment duration were explored, focusing on optimizing 
treatment cycles to enhance intervention efficacy (Tomlinson, 2018); 
(2) adjustments to DBT components were made, with group skills 
training  emerging  as  an  independent  therapeutic  approach 
(Hunnicutt Hollenbaugh and Lenz, 2018); (3) improvements to the 
emotion 
including 
enhancements in emotion recognition, labeling, and coping strategies.
In recent stage (2020–2024), research has focused on three major 
emerging  fields,  which  also  represent  future  directions.  (1) 
Neurobiological Mechanisms: Studies have investigated the neural 
foundations of emotion dysregulation. Findings indicate that DBT 
reduces activity in the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex 
while enhancing connectivity between these regions and the prefrontal 
cortex, medial prefrontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus, thereby 
improving  emotional  regulation  abilities  (Schmitt  et  al.,  2016). 
Additionally, increased gray matter volume in regions such as the 

regulation  module  were 

introduced, 

subgenual  anterior  cingulate  cortex  and  superior  temporal  gyrus 
underscores DBT’s neurobiological support for emotional regulation 
and  higher-order  cognitive  functions  like  mentalization  (Mancke 
et al., 2018). (2) Research Methods: Approaches like thematic analysis 
and systematic reviews have advanced the systematic summarization 
and in-depth exploration of DBT research (Beanlands et al., 2021). (3) 
Technological Applications: The use of mobile devices has significantly 
enhanced the accessibility and efficiency of interventions by providing 
instant support, data tracking, and personalized feedback (Rizvi et al., 
2011).  These  evolving  hotspots  reflect  DBT’s  multidimensional 
development 
integration,  methodological 
diversification, and mechanism exploration, paving the way for future 
theoretical and practical advancements.

Visualization network of keywords occurring in DBT publications. A was cluster diagram of keywords and a color represented a cluster automatically 
calculated by CiteSpace. Each numbered cluster represents a distinct research focus within the field of DBT. Larger cluster numbers represent smaller 
or more niche topics. Each point within a cluster corresponds to a specific publication contributing to that topic. The density and size of points indicate 
the volume and interconnectivity of research within the cluster. Lines connecting points represent co-citation relationships, with denser connections 
indicating stronger thematic coherence within a cluster. The color scale (red to blue) indicates the temporal distribution of publications within each 
cluster. B was timeline graph of keyword cluster analysis corresponding to A. The color represented the annual time period of the publication, in which 
the color from white to blue represented the annual occurrence time from 1987 to 2024. The size of a point indicates the frequency of the keyword’s 
occurrence. Larger points represent keywords that appear more frequently in the literature. Lines between points signify co-occurrence relationships 
between keywords. Thicker and denser lines indicate stronger associations or higher co-occurrence frequencies. Lighter blue indicates keywords 
appearing in earlier studies (1990s). Darker blue to green indicates keywords associated with more recent research (after 2020). Groups of 
interconnected nodes form clusters, representing thematic areas or research topics within DBT studies. C showed the top 25 with the strongest 
citation bursts in DBT research. Red bars represent the duration of strong citation bursts for each keyword. Longer red bars indicate sustained 
academic interest during that period. Blue lines represent the full timeline (1991–2024) of the keyword’s occurrence. Keywords: listing the keywords

stronger academic attention. Begin-End: the start and end years of the citation burst for each keyword.

for  DBT  theoretical  innovation  and  practical  optimization. 
However, the following limitations must be mentioned. Database 
variation  is  a  limitation  of  bibliometric  analysis.  It  is  widely 
known that publications from major databases such as Web of 
Science,  PubMed,  Embase  and  the  Cochrane  Library  differ. 
Therefore, we may omit some publications due to database bias. 
Although WoSCC is a very authoritative database, some relevant 
articles,  such  as  articles  published  in  Chinese,  might  still  have 
been missed when WoSCC was used as the only database. There 
is  a  need  to  pay  attention  to  the  latest  publications  and  other 
non-English  publications 
in  daily  research.  There  might 
be citation bias as well. High citation frequency does not always 
indicate high research quality. Some studies might be highly cited 
due to other factors like citation chains, leading to inaccuracies in 
the

assessments.  Additionally, 

the  perspective  of 

methodological rigor of bibliometric analysis, the quality of the 
article content was not assessed.

Conclusion

This  study  utilizes  bibliometric  analysis  to  systematically 
review the evolution of DBT research, highlighting its progression 
from  early  core  areas  such  as  BPD  and  suicide/self-injury  to 
studies  on  emotion  dysregulation  mechanisms  and  digital 
interventions. The United States dominates this field; however, 
increasing participation from emerging countries and enhancing 
the 
international  academic  collaboration  could  promote 
globalization of DBT research and improve accessibility to mental 
health.  This  study  provides  a  broader  global  perspective  and
