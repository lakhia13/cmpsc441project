To diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder, your healthcare professional likely will do a:

- Physical examto check for medical problems that may be causing your symptoms.

- Mental health evaluationthat includes talking about your symptoms and the trauma that led up to them. You also may fill out questionnaires asking about your experiences and symptoms.

A diagnosis ofPTSDmeans a person has gone through an event that involved an actual or possible threat of death, violence or serious injury. That can happen in one or more of these ways:

- You directly experienced a traumatic event.

- You witnessed, in person, a traumatic event happening to others.

- You learned that someone close to you had a traumatic event.

- You're exposed to graphic details of traumatic events over and over again, as is the case for first responders.

You may havePTSDif the problems you have after this exposure last for more than a month and greatly affect your ability to function in social and work settings and how you get along with others.

Don't try to handle the burden ofPTSDon your own. Get help from an expert who's experienced in treatingPTSD.

Post-traumatic stress disorder treatment can help you regain a sense of control over your life. The main treatment is talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy. But treatment also can include medicine.

Combining these treatments can make your symptoms better by:

- Teaching you skills to manage your symptoms.

- Helping you think better about yourself, others and the world.

- Learning ways to cope if any symptoms arise again.

- Treating other problems often related to traumatic experiences, such as depression, anxiety, or misuse of alcohol or drugs.

Several types of talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, may be used to treat children and adults withPTSD. Some types of psychotherapy used inPTSDtreatment include:

- Exposure therapy.This behavioral therapy helps you safely face situations and memories that you find frightening so that you can learn to cope with them. This is done in a gradual, predictable and controllable manner. Exposure therapy can be particularly helpful for flashbacks and nightmares. One approach uses virtual reality programs that allow you to reenter the setting in which you experienced trauma.

- Cognitive therapy.This type of talk therapy helps you see the ways of thinking, also known as cognitive patterns, that are keeping you stuck. Examples include negative beliefs about yourself and the risk of traumatic things happening again. ForPTSD, cognitive therapy often is used along with exposure therapy.

Your therapist can help you build stress management skills to help you better handle stressful situations and cope with stress in your life. Skills such as relaxation, sleep and exercise can be helpful.

All these approaches can help you gain control of lasting fear after a traumatic event. You and your mental health professional can talk about what type of therapy or combination of therapies may best meet your needs.

You may try individual therapy, group therapy or both. Group therapy can offer a way to connect with others going through similar experiences.

Several types of medicines can help make symptoms ofPTSDbetter:

- Antidepressants.These medicines can ease symptoms of depression and anxiety. They also can help make sleep problems and concentration better. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medicines sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treatPTSD. Venlafaxine (Effexor XR) also may be prescribed. Talk with your healthcare team about possible side effects.

- Anti-anxiety medicines.These medicines can ease severe anxiety and related problems. Some anti-anxiety medicines could be misused. Generally, they are used only for a short time.

Research studies on medicines forPTSDinclude:

- Stellate ganglion block.This procedure involves injecting medicine into a collection of nerves on the side of the neck. While theFDAhas not approved this procedure to treatPTSD, studies have shown promising results.

- Prazosin.Prazosin (Minipress) is usually used to manage high blood pressure. Several studies indicate that it may reduce or suppress nightmares in some people withPTSD. But other studies show no benefit. Ask a healthcare professional for more information.

You and your healthcare professional can work together to figure out the best medicine, with the fewest side effects, for you. Your mood and other symptoms may get better within a few weeks.

Tell your healthcare professional about any side effects or problems with medicines. You may need to try more than one medicine, or your healthcare professional may need to adjust your dose or medicine schedule, before finding the right fit for you.

## Coping and support

If a traumatic event causes stress and other problems that affect your life, see your healthcare professional or mental health professional. You also can take these actions as you continue with treatment forPTSD:

- Follow your treatment plan.Although it may take a while to feel the benefits of therapy or medicines, treatment can be effective. Most people recover. Remind yourself that it takes time. Following your treatment plan and routinely reaching out to your mental health professional will help move you forward.

- Learn aboutPTSD.This knowledge can help you understand what you're feeling, and then you can build coping strategies to respond effectively.

- Take care of yourself.Get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, exercise and take time to relax. Try to reduce or not use caffeine and nicotine, which can worsen anxiety.

- Don't self-medicate.Turning to alcohol or drugs to numb your feelings isn't healthy, even though it may be a tempting way to cope. It can lead to more problems, hinder effective treatments and prevent real healing.

- Break the cycle.When you feel anxious, take a brisk walk or work on a hobby to refocus.

- Stay connected.Spend time with supportive and caring people — family, friends, faith leaders or others. You don't have to talk about what happened. Just sharing time with loved ones can offer healing and comfort.

- Consider a support group.Ask your mental health professional for help finding a support group, or contact veterans' organizations or your community's social services system. Or look for local support groups in an online directory.

### When someone you love has PTSD

The person you love may seem like a different person than you knew before the trauma — angry and irritable or withdrawn and depressed, for example.PTSDcan greatly strain the emotional and mental health of loved ones and friends.

Hearing about a trauma that led to your loved one'sPTSDmay be painful for you and even cause you to relive hard events. You may find yourself avoiding your loved one's attempts to talk about the trauma or feeling hopeless that your loved one will get better. At the same time, you may feel guilty that you can't fix your loved one or speed up the healing process.

Remember that you can't change someone. But you can:

- Learn aboutPTSD.This can help you know what your loved one is going through.

- Be aware thatPTSDincludes avoiding and withdrawing from others.If your loved one doesn't want your help, allow space and let your loved one know that you're available when the time is right.

- Offer to go to healthcare appointments.If your loved one is willing, going to appointments can help you learn more about and help with treatment.

- Be willing to listen.Let your loved one know you're willing to listen, but you understand if this isn't the right time to talk. Try not to force your loved one to talk about a trauma until your loved one is ready.

- Urge get-togethers.Plan opportunities for activities with family and friends, but respect the person's decision if the time isn't right to participate. Celebrate events.

- Make your health a priority.Take care of yourself by eating healthy, being physically active and getting enough rest and sleep. Take time alone or with friends. And take part in activities that help you recharge.

- Seek help if you need it.If you have a hard time coping, talk with your healthcare professional. You may need to see a therapist who can help you work through your stress.

- Stay safe.Plan a safe place for yourself and your children if your loved one becomes violent or abusive.

## Preparing for your appointment

If you think you may have post-traumatic stress disorder, make an appointment with your healthcare professional or mental health professional. Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment and know what to expect.

- Are there any printed materials onPTSDthat I can have? What websites do you recommend?

Don't hesitate to ask any other questions during your appointment.
