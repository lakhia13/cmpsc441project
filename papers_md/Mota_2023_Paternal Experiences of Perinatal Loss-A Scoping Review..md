Abstract: Background: Perinatal grief is one of the most complex and devastating types of mourning
for both mothers and fathers; however, there is still little research on the psychological impact on
men who experience it. Therefore, the objective of this study was to summarize and synthetize the
existing literature on the way men’s grief is experienced. Methods: A search was carried out to
examine three databases for articles published in the last four years; 56 articles were obtained, and
12 were retained for analysis. Results: Four common themes were found: the men’s experience of
grief, their role as fathers, the impact of the death, and their needs regarding grief and how to face it.
Conclusions: There is also a need for discussion of the importance of validating perinatal grief in men
and studies that examine it without social gender stigmas in order to provide them with effective
emotional support.

Keywords: perinatal grief; male grief; psychological impact; scope review

1. Introduction

Over the years of research in the ﬁeld of grief caused by the death of a child during the
perinatal period, it has been observed that this type of grief is one of the most complex and
devastating that a person can experience. It is considered as a traumatic event [1], in which
the future parents experience intense grief, and it is not always recognized and accepted by
society [2,3]. However, most studies have focused on the impacts that gestational death
can have on women, including the measurement of its intensity and the risk factors that
can cause them to develop a complicated grief process, while there is still little research on
the experience of gestational death, its psychological impact, and the development of grief
in men.

In many regions of the world, most of the matters related to pregnancy, childbirth, and
parenting were assigned to women until recent times, whereas men are far more involved
today [4]. Nevertheless, both maternity and paternity are complex processes that, in many
ways, are still inﬂuenced by parents’ respective cultures [5]. Various studies have shown
that, like mothers, fathers also develop affective bonds with the fetus during the course of
a pregnancy [6,7]. These bonds are cultivated by the idea of the unborn child already being
part of the family and known by both parents [6]. However, in most contexts, the attention
during the gestational period is focused on the maternal role, while the father is rendered
invisible by both his social environment and health professionals [8].

This situation comes to forefront when parents face perinatal loss. Men generally
feel marginalized and misinformed, while their partners receive medical care in health
institutions [5]. Regarding the process of perinatal grief, there are studies that indicate that
most men experience their grief in a masked way because they feel that they must play a
role of strength, understanding, and support for their partners, which prevents them from
expressing their own feelings of pain or receiving the necessary psychosocial support [9,10].
Some studies have also noted feelings of anger, guilt [11], and depressive and anxious
symptoms [12], as the main emotional manifestations of the perinatal grieving process
in men. It is evident that perinatal death has a psychological impact on fathers and can

have important consequences on the individual, family, and social spheres; however, when
compared to the research carried out on how women experience the grieving process when
facing this type of loss, there is still little known about the psychological impact that this
type of death has on men.

The purpose of this study was to summarize and synthesize the existing literature
on the way grief is experienced by men who experience the death of a child during the
perinatal stage.

2. Materials and Methods

A scoping review was carried out to explore experiences of grief in men who have lost
a child during the perinatal stage. The PRISMA methodology and extension guidelines for
scoping reviews [13] were followed (see Supplementary Materials (File SI)). The research
question used for the scoping review was: How is perinatal grief experienced by men
whose children have died during pregnancy or the ﬁrst month of life, and what is its
psychological impact?

2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Initially, the selection criteria included every available English research article related
to perinatal grief in parents and published between January 2019 and May 2022 (this time
period was determined in order to obtain the most current investigations). This search
produced 56 papers. The criteria were reﬁned as our familiarity with the available literature
increased, and we selected 24 articles that met the following inclusion criteria: articles
that referred to the psychological impact and experience of perinatal grief in men; were
written in English; were carried out with a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methodology;
and were published during the designated period. Simple and systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, conference abstracts, books or book chapters, texts from informative journals, and
degree theses were excluded. In a second review of the same 24 articles, 12 were deleted, as
follows: 5 articles due to repetition, 4 that were trials, 2 whose texts were not fully available,
1 whose sample comprised health care providers, and 1 in which there was only one man
in the sample. A total of 12 articles remained for full-text analysis (see Figure 1).

2.2. Search Strategy

We conducted a systematic search for original articles in three databases (Scopus,
Pubmed, and PsychINFO). In the initial search, “perinatal loss” AND “fathers” were the
two terms used as titles or keywords. To focus on studies about the experience of grief and
its psychological impact, the terms “perinatal grief” OR “psychological impact” were used
and, in turn, combined with AND to reduce the search scope.

2.3. Data Extraction and Charting Process

Once the search was ﬁnished, the data collection for each article was carried out by
the ﬁrst author and independently reviewed by the other three co-authors. The obtained
data were organized in a form that accounted for the main characteristics of each article:
title, year of publication, country of study, characteristics and sample size, type and time of
loss, and type of study.

Subsequently, a thorough reading of each article was performed, followed by a quali-
tative analysis in which the objective and main results of each study were identiﬁed and
extracted. Once the information was organized, three common themes were identiﬁed: the
experience of perinatal grief from the paternal perspective, the psychological impact of
perinatal death on men, and the care needs that this population requires.

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the Studies

As shown in Table 1, the studies examined different samples, with a total of 659 par-
ticipants, of whom 67.83% (447) were men and the remaining 32.1% (188) were women.
In terms of age, all study participants were older than 18 years, and only ﬁve studies
mentioned the average age. Regarding the type of loss, most of the studies (8) were on
fetal deaths, two examined neonatal death, and two included both types. Similarly, the
vast majority of the studies (8) took into account the time elapsed since the loss, reporting
a very wide range that spanned from 2 months to 20 years. Four articles did not include
any data about the time elapsed. Nine studies used qualitative methodologies by means
of in-depth semi-structured interviews, all of which were recorded and transcribed, as
their data collection technique. Two studies were quantitative, and one used a mixed
methodology. Both the quantitative and the mixed studies applied sociodemographic
questionnaires related to perinatal loss. The measurement of perinatal grief was obtained
using PGS-33 [14]. In addition, the authors used other scales according to the objective of
each study.

Relevant Topics

The qualitative analysis of the articles allowed for the identiﬁcation of the following
common themes (see Table 2). Their descriptions can be found in Supplementary File S2.

Experience and reactions to loss. One of the main themes found in most of the articles was
the impact on and response of men when they learned of the death of their baby, regardless
of whether it occurred during the pregnancy or the neonatal period [5,9,11,15,17–20,22,23].
Some frequently reported reactions included shock caused by the unexpected news; pain
caused by the loss; feelings of sadness, helplessness, and hopelessness; and a feeling of
emptiness [5,19,23]. Most fathers agreed that they felt compelled to repress and control
these feelings in order to meet the social expectations of them as men.

Role of the fathers during the grieving process. Regarding men’s attitude during the
grieving process, all of the studies found that the fathers assumed the duty of supporting
their partners during it [5,23]. They also perceived a difference in the way men express their
pain when compared to women, as well as a difference in its intensity, with men stating
that their grief was less intense than that of women [16–18]. They also reported silencing
their own grieving process and, rather, experiencing it as unauthorized grief.

Impact of perinatal death. These ﬁndings show that men perceive that the death of their
children has impacts on different areas of their lives. One of these areas is family dynamics,
as engaging in a struggle between maintaining the protective role that has been socially
assigned to men and succumbing to the pain caused by the loss affects the attention and
care they provide to other children and family members. Another affected area reported by
fathers was work, since their altered emotional state lowered their job performance. Some
of the studies noted that the men’s relationships with their partners were also affected by
gender differences found in the expression and type of perinatal grief [9,16,18,21].

Similarly, men’s social environments were also affected, as they tended to isolate
themselves from their surroundings in order to avoid unfortunate comments made by
family and friends and caused by the non-acknowledgement of grief and the minimization
of the men’s loss. The quantitative studies showed that the men who received greater social
and medical support had lower scores regarding the intensity of their grief, whereas those
who showed marital dissatisfaction and lesser attachment to the baby during the pregnancy
obtained higher-intensity scores [16] (see Table 2).

Needs of the fathers during the grieving process. Table 2 illustrates that another important
theme related to the experience of perinatal grief in men is the acknowledgement of their
needs when facing the deaths of their children. One of these is the need to be acknowledged
as fathers, even if the death of the baby prevents them from carrying out the functions
socially assigned to the paternal role. Another need is related to the care men receive
from the health professionals who look after their partners. Most of the studies found
that fathers felt dissatisﬁed with their health providers because they sensed that all the
attention was focused on their wives, thus minimizing their own pain. Moreover, it is
noted that the fathers needed to spend time with their deceased babies in order to be able
to say goodbye and strengthen their affective bond, and they also needed to receive more
information about what happened, the cause of the death, and grief in order to better
process the experience [19,20,22].

Coping with grief. Regarding this subject, it was found that among the strategies men
use to cope with perinatal loss, the ones most used are related to becoming more involved in
spiritual and religious activities, as well as out-of-home and work-related activities. In two
of the reviewed studies, it was noted that men tended to use instrumental grief—which is
based on problem solving—as a coping strategy, while very few used intuitive or emotional
grief [11,17,21,23].

4. Discussion

Despite the fact that only three databases were consulted for this study (it was not
possible to consult other equally important ones), the results of this review, in accordance
with other similar works [24–26], primarily highlight the shortage of studies referring to
the impact and characteristics of perinatal loss in fathers when compared to the amount
of research conducted about grief in mothers; over a four-year period, only 12 studies
on the subject were found. In addition, there is an even greater shortage of quantitative

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 4886

7 of 9

research including predictive analyses or risk factors for the development of grief, which
would allow for the generalization of the results. To some extent, It seems that fathers who
have experienced perinatal loss have also been rendered invisible in this ﬁeld of research.
Another aspect of interest is the fact that most studies were carried out in European
populations and, thus, perinatal loss experienced by men is a rarely explored phenomenon
in America and, in particular, in Latin American populations, where forming a family
and becoming parents are highly valued aspects of society for both women and men. The
present review only found one study carried out in Colombia.

The second important ﬁnding of this review is that there is a lack of acknowledgement
from both society and health professionals of perinatal death and grief as traumatic and
highly complicated experiences for men. This is heightened by the need to recognize the
deceased baby as an irreplaceable individual who is a member of the family, since according
to Cassidy [2], failing to do turns the experience into marginalized grief, thus hindering the
validity of the loss, which is an important element for the normal development of grief.

On the other hand, in accordance with what has been noted in other research [27,28],
it cannot be denied that the loss of a child during the perinatal stage provokes emotional
alterations in men similar to those experienced by women, and these affect almost every
area of their lives. Nevertheless, the analyses of articles carried out in this review highlight
that the panorama of emotional impacts created by perinatal death is nuanced by gender
stigmas that complicate the objective understanding of this phenomenon and have an
impact on the multidisciplinary care provided to the parents. This situation contributes to
the belief that fathers whose babies die in the perinatal stage experience less complicated
grief than their wives and, therefore, do not require further support. In this sense, it must be
highlighted that men need equal treatment and that the differentiated treatment of women
must be changed, not only in terms of medical and hospital attention but also when it
comes to the attitudes of different social groups.

Additionally, it was observed that the fathers in the samples included in the 12 re-
viewed articles consistently rated the attention and care they received from health profes-
sionals at their respective hospitals as unsatisfactory, since some of their needs were not
adequately met. These needs included being allowed to spend more time with their de-
ceased babies, receiving clear and precise information on the causes of death and the clinical
procedures to which their partners were subjected, and receiving the proper psychological
and emotional support that they required in those moments, which would have allowed
them to recognize their right to express their grief. It is very important that health profes-
sionals provide both women and men with adequate care and attention to cope with grief;
nevertheless, as pointed out by Fernández-Basanta [27], most of the time, the attention is
only directed towards the medical aspects of the situation, leaving the psychological sphere
unaddressed. In this regard, the lack of research related to psychological interventions
for fathers experiencing perinatal loss must also be highlighted, as up until now, most
studies have only aimed to explore emotional reactions and their impacts. Furthermore,
the results of this review assist us in identifying future lines of research, such as perinatal
grief in Latin American fathers, since the studies in this region are scarce, as well as the
impact of perinatal loss on couples’ dynamics and relationships, and the inﬂuences of other
variables (such as marital satisfaction, communication styles, problem-solving strategies,
types of coping, and attitudes toward fatherhood, amongst others) in the development
of perinatal grief. An additional line of research that is truly worth exploring would be
how perinatal grief is experienced by homoparental families, as this population has been
studied even less.

5. Conclusions and Limitations

Amidst the common experiences found in the articles included in this review, the fol-
lowing stand out: the importance of acknowledging the fetus or neonate as an irreplaceable
and unique individual who has a place in the family; the acknowledgement of the validity
of men’s loss and perinatal grief by their social circles, family, and health professionals; the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 4886

opportunity for fathers to spend more time with their deceased babies, which may allow
them to strengthen their affective bond and create memories that help them assimilate the
experience; and, ﬁnally, the availability of emotional care and support for grieving fathers,
as well as the ability to receive full and timely information about the death of a child and
its emotional impact.

It is important to underline that a limitation of this study is the fact that we only
obtained access to three databases; therefore, the results may reﬂect only some of the
important aspects of the impacts of perinatal death and paternal grief.
