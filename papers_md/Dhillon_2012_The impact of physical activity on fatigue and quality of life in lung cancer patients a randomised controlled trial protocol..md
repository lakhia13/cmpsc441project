Abstract

Background: People with lung cancer have substantial symptom burden and more unmet needs than the general
cancer population. Physical activity (PA) has been shown to positively influence quality of life (QOL), fatigue and
daily functioning in the curative treatment of people with breast and colorectal cancers and lung diseases, as well
as in palliative settings. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed to determine if lung cancer patients benefit
from structured PA intervention. The Physical Activity in Lung Cancer (PAL) trial is designed to evaluate the impact
of a 2-month PA intervention on fatigue and QOL in patients with non-resectable lung cancer. Biological
mechanisms will also be studied.

Methods/design: A multi-centre RCT with patients randomised to usual care or a 2-month PA programme,
involving supervised PA sessions including a behavioural change component and home-based PA. QOL
questionnaires, disease and functional status and body composition will be assessed at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months
follow-up. The primary endpoint is comparative levels of fatigue between the 2 arms. Secondary endpoints include:
QOL, functional abilities and physical function. Exploratory endpoints include: anxiety, depression, distress,
dyspnoea, PA behaviour, fitness, hospitalisations, survival, cytokines and insulin-like growth factor levels.

Discussion: This study will provide high-level evidence of the effect of PA programmes on cancer-related fatigue
and QOL in patients with advanced lung cancer. If positive, the study has the potential to change care for people
with cancer using a simple, inexpensive intervention to improve their QOL and help them maintain independent
function for as long as possible.

Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide. In the United States alone it was estimated
there would be 226,160 new lung cancer cases and
160,340 lung cancer deaths in 2012 [1]. The majority
(60%) of lung cancer patients present with advanced,
incurable disease resulting in a median survival of only
9–12 months [2]. In this context, the aim of anti-cancer

Fatigue is one of the most common and distressing
patient-reported symptoms associated with cancer and its
treatment [3-5]. People with lung cancer report a higher
prevalence and longer duration of cancer-related fatigue,
leading to more functional impairment when compared to
other cancer patients [6]. There is growing evidence that
physical activity can improve fatigue in people with cancer,
[7-9] and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) [10]. However, no study has evaluated the
benefits of a lifestyle physical activity programme for
people with non-resectable lung cancer. This study will

determine if physical activity improves fatigue, in people
with non-resectable lung cancer.

In the past five years several large observational stud-
ies have reported that physical activity reduces the risk
of cancer recurrence, death from cancer, and death from
all causes for breast and colon cancer patients [11-16].
These studies have shown consistently that more than 9
metabolic equivalent task (MET) hours/week of physical
activity (e.g. walking at a moderate pace for 2.5 hours/
week) is associated with improved health outcomes. This
is similar to the health guidelines of 150 minutes of
moderate intensity physical activity per week or 60 min-
utes of vigorous physical activity per week [17].

A burgeoning literature has examined the effects of
physical activity on supportive care outcomes in people
with cancer including physical fitness, physical function,
fatigue and QOL [8,18-21]. Observed benefits of physical
activity include improved cardiovascular and pulmonary
function, musculoskeletal strength, maintenance of mo-
bility and independence, and improved psychological
well-being and QOL [9,22,23]. Systematic reviews and
meta-analyses have concluded that physical activity
interventions during and after cancer therapies often re-
sult in meaningful and reliable improvements in several
supportive care outcomes [8,9,19,20,22-25]. These bene-
fits include observed changes in physiologic measures,
objective performance indicators, self-reported function-
ing and symptoms, psychological well-being and overall
QOL. However, these studies did not include people
with advanced lung cancer.

A large body of evidence documents the benefits of
physical activity as a component of pulmonary and car-
diac rehabilitation in similar clinical populations, which
demonstrate improved QOL,
status, and
functional
symptom control
including dyspnoea in patients with
COPD. A Cochrane review of 31 randomised controlled
trials in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients
found those receiving pulmonary rehabilitation had sta-
tistically and clinically significant improvements in QOL,
including dyspnoea, fatigue and patient control over dis-
ease [10].

Despite the benefits of physical activity, only 20-32%
of all cancer survivors report meeting physical activity
guidelines [18,26-28]. A recent study in lung cancer sur-
vivors found that 73% did not meet the United States
physical activity guidelines, and 51% did not participate
in any moderate or vigorous physical activity at all [29].
Lung cancer survivors who met the physical activity
guidelines
reported significantly better QOL across
multiple domains compared to those who did not meet
the guidelines [30]. This suggests that there are consid-
erable opportunities for improving the physical activity
behaviour of lung cancer patients and possibly improv-
ing their QOL.

Most physical activity studies have been performed in
cancer populations with potentially curative disease, par-
ticularly breast and colorectal cancer survivors. By com-
parison, people with advanced incurable lung cancer are
older (median age of 70 years) and more likely to have
co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and cardiovascular disease. However, physical ac-
tivity has been found to be beneficial in older cancer
patients, [3] and in a palliative population [21]. Cardio-
pulmonary exercise testing in people with advanced can-
cer, including lung cancer, has been shown to be safe
and feasible, which suggests that most people would be
able to follow a programme emphasising moderate in-
tensity physical activity [31].

The biological mechanisms by which physical activity
may modify cancer risk or disease progression, or im-
prove symptom control, include changes in insulin-like
growth factor (IGF) levels, immune regulation, sex and
metabolic hormone levels, prostaglandin ratio and obes-
ity [16,32-35]. More specific to lung cancer, physical
activity improves pulmonary function and perfusion,
[36] and it is hypothesised that physical activity may up-
regulate antioxidants and free scavengers to help coun-
teract the effects of cigarette smoke [37]. Physical activ-
ity may also decrease the risk of pneumonia and
venothrombotic events, thereby improving overall sur-
vival and QOL in patients with non-resectable lung
cancer.

Our aim is to evaluate a physical activity programme
in people with non-resectable lung cancer to determine
if it improves fatigue and quality of life. Our hypotheses
are that people who undergo the physical activity inter-
vention compared to those who do not, will: 1) report
less fatigue; 2) have better health-related quality of life;
3) have improved overall survival; and, 4) have less de-
cline in their level of physical function over time.

Methods/design
This multi-site, randomised controlled trial is being led
by the Survivorship Research Group (SuRG) at the Uni-
versity of Sydney, Australia. Funding was obtained from
a Young Investigator Award from the Lance Armstrong
Foundation. The study was prospectively registered with
the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry,
registration number ACTRN12609000971235. Ethics ap-
proval has been obtained from Concord Repatriation
General Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee for
each participating institution under the New South
Wales Health multi-site ethics approval scheme (HREC
reference number: 08/CRGH/242).

Participants are recruited from lung cancer clinics at 4
Sydney hospitals, commencing May 2009 until achieve-
ment of planned sample size.

Intervention
Theoretical framework
The physical activity programme is based on the Theory
of Planned Behaviour, [39] and modelled after the suc-
cessful behaviour change programme developed by the
Diabetes Prevention Programme [40].

Participants randomised to the physical activity inter-
vention arm will participate in a 2-month individualised
physical activity and behavioural support programme
with a Physical Activity Consultant (PAC).

The goal of the intervention will be to increase the
participant’s physical activity over the 2-month interven-
tion by a minimum of 3 MET hours per week compared
to baseline. While this may be less than the recom-
mended physical activity guidelines for some partici-
pants,
increasing their MET hours
further will be encouraged to do so.

those capable of

The physical activity program will consist of supervised
physical activity (30 to 45 minutes duration) and behav-
iour support sessions (15 to 30 minutes) once a week for 8
weeks, as well as unsupervised home physical activity ses-
sions. The physical activity program (including supervised
and unsupervised sessions) will be tailored to the partici-
pant’s baseline fitness, performance status and physical ac-
tivity preferences, and take account of personal facilitators
and barriers to physical activity. The study emphasises
aerobic physical activity. Consequently it is expected that
most participants will engage in walking as their preferred
form of physical activity; however, other forms of aerobic
running are
activity such as

swimming, cycling or

acceptable. The program also incorporates advice about
resistance exercises to encourage participants to maintain
muscle function and strength.

The weekly structured sessions include physical activity
as well as behaviour support sessions that use behaviour
lifestyle change principles. It is the behaviour support ses-
sions that will be the primary focus of the program pro-
moting unsupervised physical activity. A full
list of
behaviour change session titles and their learning goals is
outlined in Table 2. Participants will be supplied with a
physical activity and behaviour change guidebook titled
“Exercising with Lung Cancer”, a pedometer and physical
activity diary for use throughout the intervention.

Assessments
Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (prior to random-
isation), 2, 4 and 6 months (Figure 1). Baseline assess-
ments involve a medical history and examination. At all
assessments, disease and treatment
status will be
recorded and subjects will complete patient reported
outcome (PRO) questionnaires, a standardised fitness
test (6 Minute Walk Test, [41] Senior’s Fitness Test, [41]
hand grip strength [42]), and donate blood for bio-
marker analysis. All subjects will wear an Actigraph
GT1M accelerometer [43] (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola,
FL, USA) on the right hip to objectively determine phys-
ical activity for 7 full days prior to each assessment. Sur-
vival status will be obtained from the medical records,
with follow up until the time of the final analysis.

Primary and secondary endpoints
The primary endpoint will be the level of self-reported
fatigue as assessed by the Functional Assessment of

observed value are not systematically different. Data are
missing at random (MAR) if any systematic differences
can be explained by observed outcome or covariate data.
Data are missing not at random (MNAR) when system-
atic differences exist, even after adjusting for previously
observed data. A MAR primary analysis followed by sen-
sitivity analyses are recommended by experts in the field
of missing data [58].

Thus, our main analyses will use linear mixed models
for all outcomes, which are unbiased for data which are
MCAR or MAR and are consistent with the intention-
to-treat principle [58-60]. Mixed model account for co-
variance between repeated measures on patients and
allow for: 1) comparing patterns of change over time by
testing the intervention group by time interaction; and
2) estimating and testing differences between groups at
time points of interest via linear contrasts. Unadjusted
and adjusted main analyses will be carried out, with ad-
justment for baseline measures including sex, age, dis-
ease stage, and the baseline outcome.

Patterns of missing data will be assessed to consider
potential missing data mechanisms and baseline charac-
teristics of patients lost to follow-up at 2, 4 and 6
months will be compared to patients who completed
follow-up to assess patterns of loss to follow-up. Sensi-
tivity analyses will be carried out using multiple imput-
ation, which will include auxiliary data such as ECOG
performance status and baseline secondary outcomes
such as physical activity measures.

Overall survival is an exploratory endpoint, because the
study has limited power to evaluate this. Patients alive at
final analysis or who have become lost to follow up will be
censored at their last contact date. Overall survival will be
described by the Kaplan-Meier method. A stratified log-
rank test adjusting for the stratification factors of disease
stage (locally advanced vs metastatic) and ECOG perform-
ance status (0+1 vs 2) at randomisation will be used to
compare overall survival between the two arms.

Discussion
Advanced lung cancer is incurable, and is the leading
cause of cancer deaths world-wide. The goal of treat-
ment is to improve QOL, maintain physical function
and prolong life. Treatments to date have focused on
disease modifying anti-cancer therapies (e.g. chemother-
apy or radiation). A focus on the person and their func-
tional status reflects an innovative approach to therapy,
maximising their ability to live with miminal effects of
the disease for as long as possible.

A physically active lifestyle improves fatigue and QOL
in other cancer populations, particularly in early stage
disease, but this type of intervention has not been evalu-
ated in advanced lung cancer, where people are generally
older with a higher burden of co-morbid illnesses than

other cancer groups. This intervention has the potential
to change standard care with a simple, safe, relatively in-
expensive treatment that could improve the QOL of
people with lung cancer and help them to maintain in-
dependent function for as long as possible. This study
will determine whether a physical activity programme
reduces the number of days participants spend in hos-
pital for symptom control and end of life care. It will ob-
tain unique data about the impact of physical activity on
cytokines and the insulin pathway and the influence of
each of these biomarkers on prognosis. It will provide
preliminary evidence on whether physical activity can
impact on survival in people with lung cancer.

One of the greatest challenges to implementation of
physical activity programmes has been availability of ad-
equate support and resources to promote and maintain
adherence with physical activity. If a randomised con-
trolled trial demonstrated a significant benefit for people
with lung cancer this would not only provide great im-
petus to patients to increase their physical activity and
oncologists to promote it, but provide an evidence base to
support a change in policy and practice to ensure patients
engage with a physical activity consultant to design and
follow-up a personalised physical activity programme. The
intervention under study has been designed to ensure it
can be offered in a hospital or community setting.

Conclusions
Physical activity has been associated with many health
benefits. This study will provide high-level evidence of
the effectiveness of physical activity programmes to im-
prove cancer fatigue and QOL in a cancer population
with substantial symptom burden and high unmet needs.
It will determine the feasibility of delivering exercise
programmes in an advanced lung cancer population,
and be powered to evaluate whether physical activity
improves fatigue and QOL in this patient population. In
addition, it will obtain important data about the impact
of physical activity on physical function, body compos-
ition, mood, perceived cognitive function, dyspnoea,
cytokines and the insulin pathway, and their influence
on prognosis. The study outcomes have the potential to
change standard care, with a non-toxic and inexpensive
treatment, which can improve quality of life of people
with lung cancer and help them achieve the highest
possible level of independent function for as long as
possible [61].
