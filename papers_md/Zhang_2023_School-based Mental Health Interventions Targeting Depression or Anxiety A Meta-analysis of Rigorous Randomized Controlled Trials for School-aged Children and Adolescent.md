Abstract
Past meta-analyses in mental health interventions failed to use stringent inclusion criteria and diverse moderators, therefore,
there is a need to employ more rigorous methods to provide evidence-based and updated results on this topic. This study
presents an updated meta-analysis of interventions targeting anxiety or depression using more stringent inclusion criteria
(e.g., baseline equivalence, no signiﬁcant differential attrition) and additional moderators (e.g., sample size and program
duration) than previous reviews. This meta-analysis includes 29 studies of 32 programs and 22,420 students (52% female,
79% White). Among these studies, 22 include anxiety outcomes and 24 include depression outcomes. Overall, school-based
mental health interventions in grades K-12 are effective at reducing depression and anxiety (ES = 0.24, p = 0.002).
Moderator analysis shows that improved outcomes for studies with anxiety outcomes, cognitive behavioral therapy,
interventions delivered by clinicians, and secondary school populations. Selection modeling reveals signiﬁcant publication
and outcome selection bias. This meta-analysis suggests school-based mental health programs should strive to adopt
cognitive behavioral therapy and deliver through clinicians at the secondary school level where possible.

Introduction

Given the escalating mental health crisis (Wong et al.,
2021), there is a substantial need for effective ways to
improve depression and anxiety among school-age children.
There exists a proliﬁc amount of school-based mental health
interventions, yet the quality of such interventions varies
greatly. Previous meta-analyses provided many insights on
effective interventions; however, they failed to use stringent
inclusion criteria. There is a need to review high-quality
randomized controlled trials to generate new and evidence-
based insights. This study aims to synthesize research on
existing mental health interventions targeting depression
and anxiety of school-aged children and adolescents to
provide updated guidance on effective interventions.

Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety in School-
aged Children and Adolescents

In recent years, depression and anxiety have increased
rapidly among 6-17 years old American children (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (2022)). Approximately
9.4% 3–17-year-old children were diagnosed with anxiety
problems (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(2022)) and 31.5% 13-18-year-old children have experi-
enced depression (Feiss et al., 2019). These statistics are
concerning not only because of what they tell, but also
because of what they do not tell. In the mental health area,
numbers often underestimate the actual prevalence of
mental health problems due to diagnostic challenges
(Mathews et al., 2011), stigmatization (Moses, 2010), and
subsequent reluctance to seek help (Reavley et al., 2010).
On top of that,
there is a gap between those who are
diagnosed and those who receive treatment: around half of
diagnosed American adolescents receive mental health
treatments
in the form of medication or counseling
(Zablotsky, 2020). More needs to be done to provide
accessible mental health support for school-aged children

and adolescents (i.e., aged 10–19; World Health Organi-
zation (2022)).

Apart from the increasing prevalence and inadequate
treatment in depression and anxiety, the associated con-
sequences highlight the need to intervene early and effec-

among children are associated with poor academic outcomes
(Owens et al., 2012), deteriorating physical health (Naicker
et al., 2013), substance abuse or dependence (Conway et al.,
2006), negative coping strategies (Cairns et al., 2014), self-
injury (Giletta et al., 2012), and suicidal attempts (Nock
et al., 2013). In addition, anxiety and depression among
adolescents are likely to be recurrent (Gillham et al., 2006),
through
chronic (Costello et al., 2003), and persistent
adulthood (Lee et al., 2018). Treating depression and anxiety
effectively can create great social, educational, and eco-
nomic beneﬁts. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials can produce guidance for policymakers by providing
insights into the effectiveness of all related interventions.
This meta-analysis intends to provide evidence to help
school districts understand what
types of mental health
interventions work in the school environment.

School-based Mental Health Interventions

The importance of addressing mental health in children and
adolescents cannot be understated. The long-term adverse
outcomes outlined above exist not only for those who meet
diagnostic criteria, but also for those with subclinical levels of
depression (Copeland et al., 2021). Schools provide an ideal
setting within which to both implement preventative inter-
ventions as well as identify and serve those with or at-risk of
depression or anxiety. School settings can provide access to
all school-age children, while overcoming barriers such as
location, time, and stigma (Stephan et al., 2007). Compared to
primary-care settings, school-based mental health programs
can reach larger populations, provide more convenient access,
and enhance social relationships between classmates and
teachers (van Loon et al., 2020). An additional advantage of
school-based interventions is that they can serve to identify
students at high risk for depression and anxiety and provide
them with clinical support. This is especially important
because one major reason for untreated depression is the
failure to identify or diagnose depressive symptoms (Hirsch-
feld et al., 1997). This challenge can be mitigated by school-
based mental health programs. With these advantages, school-
based mental health interventions are increasingly gaining
popularity (Werner-Seidler et al., 2017).

and anxiety. One review identiﬁed 118 randomized con-
trolled trials with 45,924 participants and found that these
interventions had a small effect on depression and anxiety
(Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). Similarly, another recent
review analyzed 18 included studies and found that school-
based programs had a small positive effect on self-reported
anxiety symptoms (Hugh-Jones et al., 2021). These con-
clusions were challenged by another meta-analysis, where
authors identiﬁed 137 studies with 56,620 participants and
found little evidence that school-based interventions which
focused solely on the prevention of depression or anxiety
are effective (Caldwell et al., 2019). These three meta-
analyses focused on children within the age group of 4–19
years old. When meta-analysts narrowed their focus to
adolescents (11–18 years old) in the USA, they found sig-
niﬁcant effects of school-based programs on both depres-
sion and anxiety, but not on stress reduction (Feiss et al.,
2019). One possible reason behind these conﬂicting con-
clusions is the distribution of age groups; perhaps school-
based interventions are generally more effective for ado-
lescents compared to younger children. Another possible
source of conﬂict may be the subjective inclusion criteria
created by researchers, which can bias the results (Cheung
and Slavin, 2013). When applying more stringent inclusion
criteria, the magnitude and statistical signiﬁcance of effect
sizes tends to diminish (Neitzel et al., 2022). The associa-
tion between inclusion criteria and outcomes was demon-
strated in another school-based meta-analysis, where the
authors found that removing low-quality studies led to
changes in average effect sizes (Tejada-Gallardo et al.,
2020).

Outcome domain

Depression is a clinical symptom that involves persistent
sadness and loss of interest in previously enjoyable activ-
ities (National Institute of Mental Health, 2018). Anxiety
disorder refers to persistent anxiety that interferes with daily
life (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). In past
there are conﬂicting views on the effec-
meta-analyses,
tiveness of depression- or anxiety-focused school-based
interventions, ranging from no evidence of effectiveness in
either depression or anxiety (Caldwell et al., 2019),
to
effectiveness dependent on program features (Feiss et al.,
2019), to a small positive average effect size in both out-
come domains (Werner-Seidler et al., 2021), to sustainable
positive effect sizes even after 12 months (Hugh-Jones
et al., 2021).

Past Meta-analyses

Program type

Past meta-analyses have conﬂicting views on the effec-
tiveness of school-based interventions targeting depression

The universal approach delivers the treatment to the whole
population (e.g., class, school, cohort) regardless of their

conditions while the targeted approach delivers the treat-
ment to a selective group of students who show elevated
symptoms of depression or anxiety. In targeted interven-
tions, students were ﬁrst screened using self-reported sur-
veys to detect at-risk students. Universal programs are
preventive in nature while targeted programs are curative.
Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. Tar-
geted interventions may be difﬁcult to apply at a large scale
due to the tremendous amount of screening efforts required
(Merry et al., 2004). Moreover, compared to the universal
approach, the targeted approach involves taking students
from classes, which may cause unintended effects of
labeling and stigmatizing students (Huggins et al., 2008).
Past research has shown that students selected for targeted
mental health treatments feel embarrassed and may have
negative attitudes towards receiving medication (Biddle
et al., 2006). Universal programs avoid potential dangers of
social stigmatization and can reach more children, but they
may be more costly due to the larger group of participating
populations (Ahlen et al., 2012). Furthermore,
targeted
programs were more effective compared to universal pro-
grams (Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). Since both approaches
have pros and cons, investigating the effectiveness of one
compared to another can generate useful scientiﬁc and
implementation implications.

Program content

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a traditional type of
program targeting depression and anxiety (Feiss et al.,
2019). In clinical settings, CBT treatment usually involves
changing thinking and behavioral patterns, helping indivi-
duals to understand the problem, and developing a treatment
strategy together with the psychologist (American Psycho-
logical Association, 2017). In K-12 school settings, CBT
techniques and components can be adjusted and applied to
the behavioral social-emotional needs of students even
without clinical diagnosis (Joyce-Beaulieu & Sulkowski,
2019). Through CBT interventions, students gain skills to
understand and cope with their own feelings, such as using
relaxation techniques and interacting with peers more
effectively (Joyce-Beaulieu and Sulkowski, 2019). School-
based interventions with CBT components are found
effective to reduce depressive symptoms (Rooney et al.,
2013) and anxiety (Lewis et al., 2013), and to improve
coping strategies (Collins et al., 2014). Apart from CBT,
evidence suggests promising effects of other innovative
program features, such as physical education (Olive et al.,
2019), student-family-school triads (Singh et al., 2019), and
Hatha yoga sessions (Quach et al., 2016). One past meta-
analysis suggested that there are no signiﬁcant differences
between CBT programs and other approaches in treating
either depression or anxiety (Werner-Seidler et al., 2021).

Yet, another meta-analysis reported weak evidence of
CBT’s effectiveness in reducing anxiety in both elementary
and secondary school populations (Caldwell et al., 2019).
Comparing traditional program types to other new program
types can help us understand components that make inter-
ventions effective.

Delivery personnel

the rapidly growing demand for school-based
To meet
mental health services, the teacher’s role shifts from being a
supportive ﬁgure to being a service provider (Park et al.,
2020). The appeal of hiring teachers to deliver interventions
is increasing, yet there is lack of research that compares
teacher-delivered interventions to clinician-delivered inter-
ventions.
In school-based mental health interventions,
interventions are normally delivered by either trained tea-
chers or certiﬁed clinicians. Although trained psychologists
or clinicians have more professional and practical knowl-
edge than teachers, hiring specialists is more expensive
compared to training schoolteachers through a short work-
shop. Moreover, students spend most of their time during
schools with teachers and have developed rapport and trust
with each other. In contrast to teachers, clinicians are less
familiar with students’ backgrounds and personalities. Very
few meta-analyses were able to include the provider as a
moderator in their meta-regression because very few inter-
ventions were delivered by teachers. Findings on providers
are mixed, ranging from no signiﬁcant moderation effect on
delivery personnel (Ahlen et al., 2015), to external providers
being more effective than school staff (Werner-Seidler et al.,
2021), to teachers being more effective (Neil and Chris-
tensen, 2009), and to teachers being more effective under
some treatment conditions (Franklin et al., 2017). This
article contributes to the literature by comparing teacher-
delivered interventions to clinician-delivered interventions.

Program duration

Past research has established that interventions delivered
within a short span of time tend to produce much larger
effect sizes than long-duration interventions (Cheung &
Slavin, 2013). Factors contributing to this effect include
novelty factors, a more experimentally-stable environment,
and the feasibility of conditions only sustainable for short-
duration interventions (Cheung & Slavin, 2013). Those
ﬁndings suggest using 12 weeks as a benchmark to separate
short-duration and long-duration studies.

Sample size

Study sample size has also been found to strongly impact
effect sizes, with small sample sizes tending to inﬂate effect

198

sizes (Slavin & Smith, 2009). One reason behind this obser-
vation is the “superrealization” effect (Cronbach et al., 1980),
which means that the high implementation ﬁdelity maintained
within a small sample can hardly be scaled to a larger sample.
Another reason may be that small-scale studies are more likely
to use researcher-developed measures compared to standar-
dized tests (de Boer et al., 2014). Lastly, publication bias may
have contributed to this phenomenon since small-scale studies
have limited statistical power, which often requires higher
effect sizes than large-scale studies to reach statistical sig-
niﬁcance. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no prior
meta-analysis has included sample size as a moderator.

Student age

As summarized in the previous section (i.e., past meta-
analyses), results of the meta-analysis may be different
across age groups. For example, one investigation of aca-
demic achievement found that students in the elementary
grades gain much more academic progress than secondary
school students in one academic year (Bloom et al., 2008).
A separate meta-analysis of academic interventions found
the same disparity between age groups, but the signiﬁcance
of these results disappeared when they restricted inclusion
criteria to only randomized and quasi-experimental designs,
which further demonstrated the importance of applying
rigorous inclusion criteria (Cheung & Slavin, 2013).

Current Study

Past meta-analyses in mental health interventions failed to
use stringent
inclusion criteria and diverse moderators;
therefore, there is a need to employ more rigorous methods
to provide evidence-based and updated results on this topic.
In order to identify characteristics of effective depression or
anxiety interventions and provide evidence-based sugges-
tions for current and future practices, this meta-analysis
systematically reviews school-based mental health pro-
grams that serve K-121 students. The article aims to answer
two research questions: What are the overall impacts of
on
randomized-controlled-trial
school-based
depression and/or anxiety reduction? (Research question 1).
This study hypothesizes that school-based randomized-

programs

1 In the US educational system, K-12 refers to formal education
covering elementary and secondary school grades through kindergar-
ten to 12th grades (Department of Homeland Security, 2022). Amer-
ican children generally start formal education at age ﬁve or six.
However, educational systems in other countries may be different from
included in elementary
the US. For example, kindergarten is not
school grades in some countries. Thus, this study examines the effects
of interventions for children and adolescents in kindergarten, ele-
mentary school, middle school, and high school.

controlled-trial programs can effectively reduce depression
and anxiety in school-age children, as has been demon-
strated in prior reviews (Feiss et al., 2019; Hugh-Jones
et al., 2021; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). (Hypothesis 1). To
what extent do intervention outcomes differ according to
methodological criteria, such as sample size and program
duration; and intervention criteria, such as program type
(targeted vs. universal); program delivery personnel (trained
teachers vs. certiﬁed clinicians); program content (cognitive
behavior therapy vs. others); and student age? (Research
the identiﬁed
question 2). This study hypothesizes that
factors signiﬁcantly moderate the impact of the programs.
(Hypothesis 2).

Methods

Literature Search

the ﬁrst author
To ensure a thorough literature search,
conducted database search, handsearching, and backward
citation chasing. Using the list of keywords (Table 1), the
ﬁrst author searched for relevant articles in the Education
Resources Information Center, PsychINFO, and Google
Scholar. After the database search, the ﬁrst author also
conducted complementary handsearching in a set of repu-
table ﬁeld-speciﬁc journals (listed in Table 2). The ﬁrst
author used Paperfetcher, a browser-based tool, to conduct
both handsearching and backward citation chasing (Pallath
& Zhang, 2022). All literature search was completed in June
2021. There are three steps in the screening: ﬁrst, the ﬁrst
author used ASReview’s machine learning algorithms to
rank all retrieved articles by their relevance and exported
the most relevant 2308 studies (van de Schoot et al., 2021).
This decision was made by the ﬁrst author by manually
browsing through the titles of the most relevant studies and
making a cut-off point when studies become obviously
irrelevant. To be cautious, the ﬁrst author also sampled 10%
of the 5864 studies excluded through ASReview’s machine
learning ranking to conﬁrm that they would be excluded.
Then, these 2308 studies were imported into Covidence
(Covidence systematic review software, 2013) for double-
blinded screening. The authors chose Covidence here
because it enables full-text review and the authors’ afﬁliated
institutions provide free software licenses for this tool
(Zhang & Neitzel, 2021). The ﬁrst and second authors
manually screened the title and abstract through a single-
reviewer decision-making. Then the ﬁrst and second authors
manually screened full-text through a double-blinded deci-
sion-making. The proportionate agreement in this full-text
screening stage is 0.85. The third author was invited for a
group discussion to resolve all conﬂicts and 100% agree-
ment was reached eventually.

Eligibility Criteria

This article used the following inclusion criteria for full-text
review to ensure consistency and high standards in study
quality:

(1) Randomized controlled trials (RCT) must have at least
30 students per experimental condition to reduce bias
in small studies (Cheung & Slavin, 2016) and at least
2 teachers/schools per condition to eliminate con-
found due to sample size (What Works Clearing-
house, 2020a). For example, one study was excluded
because it used a one school vs. one school design
(Harnett & Dadds, 2004). Another
study was
excluded because it had 22 and 24 students in control
and treatment conditions respectively (Burckhardt
et al., 2016).

(2) Program duration from program start to posttest must
be at least four weeks to remove particularly short
interventions. A study was excluded because it was a
one-week intervention (Link et al., 2020).

(3) Studies must have taken place in the following
countries: USA, Canada, Europe (European Union +
U.K. + Switzerland + Norway), Israel, Australia, and

New Zealand. This geographical restriction intends to
narrow down the scope of review to countries that
share similar economic and political situations. A
study was excluded because it took place in South
Africa (Fernald et al., 2008).

(4) Studies must use randomization to focus on studies of
the highest level of internal validity. The level of
random assignment may be schools, classes, or
students. For example, a study was excluded because
it allocated students to treatment and control based on
number of students and gender composition (Kowa-
lenko et al., 2005).

(5) Differences between conditions at baseline on depres-
sion/anxiety measure must be less than 0.25 standard
deviations (SDs)
to reduce bias from unreliable
statistical analyses (Rubin, 2001). For example, a
study was excluded because its depression measure-
(Ardic &
ments at baseline were inequivalent
Erdogan, 2017).

(6) Differential attrition between treatment and control
groups must be less than 15% to reduce bias (What
Works Clearinghouse, 2020a).
(7) A control group must be present.
(8)

Intervention or instruction should be delivered by non-
researchers. Treatments had to be delivered by ordinary
teachers, not by researchers, because effect sizes are
inﬂated when researchers deliver the treatment (Scam-
macca et al., 2007). For example, a study was excluded
because the intervention was delivered by lead author
and master’s students in clinical psychology (García-
Escalera et al., 2020). Similarly, a study was excluded
because the intervention was delivered by lead author
and a research assistant (Burckhardt et al., 2016).

(9) Outcomes of

interest measurements must

include
quantitative measures of either depression/depressive
symptoms/depression literacy or anxiety/anxious symp-
toms. For example, a study was excluded because
outcomes did not measure depression or anxiety
(Daunic et al., 2012).

(10) Text must be available in English.
(11) Articles must be published on or after January 1st, 2000.
This means that this study reviewed experimental studies
in the last two decades for the most updated evidence.
(12) Children participating in the programs must come from
K-12 school grades. This means that this study includes

200

studies that focus on students studying in kindergarten,
elementary, secondary (including middle and high
schools). For example, a study was excluded because
the intervention focused on college students (Xiong et al.,
2022).

Moderators

Analytical Plan

This study conducted the meta-analysis in R (R Core Team,
2021) using the metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2010). The
three authors performed double coding in Google spread-
sheet and held discussion to eventually reach 100% inter-
judge reliability in codiﬁcation. This study used weighted
mean effect sizes and meta-analytic tests such as Q statis-
tics. Weights were then assigned to each study based on
inverse variance (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) and adjusted
weights (Hedges, 2007). A random-effects model was used
in meta-regression since there was no single true effect size
but a range of effect sizes that may have depended on other
factors (Borenstein et al., 2010). For cluster randomization,
this study added adjustments for clustering adapted from
What Works Clearinghouse (2020b). This study analyzed
six pairs of moderators (more details in the next section) and
examined differential effects by including interaction terms.
All moderators and covariates were grand mean centered to
facilitate interpretation of the intercept. All reported mean
effect sizes come from this meta-regression model, which
adjusts for potential moderators and covariates. To assess
this study adopted selection modeling
publication bias,
instead of other traditional techniques (e.g., funnel plot,
Egger’s regression, fail-safe N) because of the limitations2
in these traditional techniques. Selection modeling involves
a model of the selection process that uses a weight function
to estimate the probability of selection in random-effect
meta-analysis (Hedges, 1992). Selection modeling is the
most recommended method to investigate meta-analyses’
publication bias (Terrin et al., 2005). This study used
weightr package (Coburn & Vevea, 2019) to apply the
weight-function model (Vevea & Woods, 2005). To con-
duct risk of bias analysis, the authors decided to use JBI
Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials (Joanna Briggs
Institute, 2017) because it provides a clear guideline for
systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized con-
trolled trials, which ﬁts well with this meta-analysis.

2 The evaluation of funnel plots is subjected to meta-analysts’ inter-
pretations, which are often misled by the plot shapes (Terrin et al.,
2005). In addition, visual assessment of funnel plots or Egger’s
regression only presents part of the publication bias related to small-
study bias. The fail-safe N technique is also largely abandoned in the
ﬁeld due to its arbitrary choice of zero, ignorance of heterogeneity in
primary studies (Iyengar & Greenhouse, 1988), and other major ﬂaws
(Becker, 2005).

This study added moderators to explain the difference in
impacts based on outcome domains, methodological cri-
intervention criteria, program delivery personnel,
teria,
program content, and student age.

Outcome domain: depression vs. anxiety

Outcome domain was coded as depression if the outcome
used a depression scale, such as Children’s Depression
Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory II. It was coded
as anxiety if the outcome included used an anxiety scale,
such as Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale and Multi-
dimensional Anxiety Scale for Children.

Program type: universal vs. targeted

Programs were coded as either universal or targeted. Uni-
versal means the program was delivered to entire classes,
schools, or cohorts, regardless of risk level. Targeted means
the program was delivered to speciﬁc groups of students
showing elevated levels of depression of anxiety.

Program content: cognitive behavioral therapy vs. others

Programs were coded as either cognitive behavioral therapy or
others. CBT programs have design features that involve CBT
techniques and components. Non-CBT programs refer to a
wide range of other designs, including mental health education,
yoga, physical education, mindfulness, coping skills.

Delivery personnel: teachers vs. clinicians

Delivery personnel was coded as either teachers or clin-
icians. Among non-teacher delivered programs, one inter-
vention was delivered through a self-directed online
program; others were delivered by personnel with psycho-
logical backgrounds, such as psychologists, mental health
workers, clinicians, social workers, and counselors. In the
following analysis, this study treats all non-teacher delivery
personnel as clinicians.

Program duration: short duration (<12 weeks) vs. long
duration (≥12 weeks)

This article codes interventions shorter than 12 weeks as
short duration and interventions equal to or longer than

Journal of Youth and Adolescence (2023) 52:195–217

201

Fig. 1 PRISMA Diagram

12 weeks as long durations to compare the effect sizes of
the two types.

Sample size: small sample (<250) vs. large sample (≥250)

Sample size was either small or large. When the total par-
ticipating student sample is smaller than 250, the program
was coded as having a small sample size. When the sample
is equal or larger than 250, the program was coded as
having a large sample size.

Student age: grade level comparison between elementary
and secondary schools

Student age was coded as 1 for kindergarten and elementary
schools, 2 for middle schools, and 3 for high schools. In
analysis, 2 and 3 are combined to refer to secondary school
students.

stage, the top ﬁve reasons for exclusion are inadequate
outcome measures (n = 52),
(n = 46), wrong
design (n = 33), meta-analysis/review (n = 23) and outside
the geographical scope (n = 17). After applying the inclu-
sion criteria, this review found a total of 29 qualiﬁed studies
evaluating 32 programs3 (Fig. 1, Table 3). In total, these
programs have 22,420 K-12 students (n = 12,174 in treat-
ment group, and n = 10,246 in control group). Among these
students, 52% are female and 79% are White. Table 4
presents the descriptive statistics of the 29 included studies.
Among the included studies, most were conducted in
Australia and USA (13 and nine respectively, Table 4). For
grade levels, 17 programs (53.1%) focused on the elemen-
tary school population and 15 (46.9%) focused on the
secondary school population. Overall, 22 programs (68.8%)
employed Cluster Randomized Controlled Trials (CRCT)
and the other 10 programs (31.2%) used RCT design. In
terms of intervention design, 22 programs (68.8%) exam-
ined interventions with CBT components and 10 programs
(31.2%) reported interventions with non-CBT strategies. In
terms of duration, 10 programs (31.2%) evaluated inter-
ventions that last at least 12 weeks (i.e., long duration),
while 22 programs (68.8%) reported interventions that last

universal vs. targeted population), it is treated as two programs.

less than 12 weeks (i.e., short duration). Sample sizes of
included programs vary greatly, ranging from 68 students
(Chaplin et al., 2006) to 5,634 students (Sawyer et al.,
2010). In total, 17 programs (53.1%) have small sample
sizes (less than 250) and 15 (46.9%) have large sample
sizes. The majority (78.1%) of the interventions were uni-
versal, and seven programs (21.9%) are targeted. This
demonstrates universal programs’
increasing popularity.
This study analyzed 79 effect sizes related to depression or
anxiety. Among these outcomes, 40 effect sizes (50.6%)
were related to anxiety, and 39 effect sizes (49.4%) were
related to depression.
In addition, 40 (50.6%) studies
evaluated teacher-delivered interventions and 39 (49.4%)
studies investigated non-teacher-delivered interventions.

Meta-analysis Results

As shown in Table 5, the overall mean effect size for these
32 programs is 0.24 (p = 0.002) while holding all mod-
erators ﬁxed at their mean. The 95% predictive interval
ranges from −0.91 to 1.39.

Outcome domain: depression vs. anxiety

Overall, outcomes using anxiety-related measurements have
size (ES = 0.44,
a signiﬁcant weighted mean effect
p = 0.001, Table 6). But no signiﬁcant mean effect size was
found in outcomes measuring depression (ES = 0.04,
p = 0.723). The difference between anxiety outcomes and
depression outcomes was 0.4 SDs on average (p = 0.025).

Program type: universal vs. targeted

Intervention type was not a signiﬁcant moderator of effect
sizes. The mean effect size for interventions focused on
targeted populations was 0.42 (p = 0.021), while the mean
effect size for interventions focused on universal popula-
tions was 0.18 (p = 0.028).

Intervention design: cognitive behavioral therapy vs. others

Intervention design was a signiﬁcant moderator of impact.
On average, CBT programs have signiﬁcantly higher effect
sizes than those without CBT components (p = 0.016).
CBT programs have a mean effect size of 0.33 (p = 0.002),
while programs without CBT elements have a non-
signiﬁcant mean effect size of −0.15 (p = 0.260).

Intervention delivery: teachers vs. clinicians

Intervention delivery personnel were a signiﬁcant mod-
erator of impact. On average, the effect size of teacher-
delivered programs is 0.39 SDs lower
than programs

delivered by non-teacher personnel (p = 0.013). Programs
delivered by non-teacher personnel have, on average, a
signiﬁcant mean effect size of 0.44 (p = 0.007) while pro-
grams delivered by teachers have an average non-signiﬁcant
mean effect size of 0.05 (p = 0.371).

Intervention duration: short duration (<12 weeks) vs. long
duration (≥12 weeks)

No signiﬁcant difference was found between the mean
effect size of long-duration and short-duration programs.
On average, short duration programs had a statistically
signiﬁcant mean effect size (ES = 0.28, p = 0.003), com-
pared to long duration programs with a non-signiﬁcant
mean effect size of 0.14 (p = 0.222)

Sample size: small sample (<250) vs. large sample (≥250)

The weighted mean effect size of interventions with small
sample sizes (n < 250) is 0.35 (p = 0.019), while the mean
effect size of large-sample interventions (n ≥ 250) is 0.13
(p = 0.221). The difference between the mean effect sizes of
small-sample and large-sample interventions is not sig-
niﬁcant (p = 0.271).

Grade level: elementary vs. secondary schools

On average, there was no signiﬁcant effect found in the
interventions implemented in elementary schools (ES =
0.06, p = 0.547). Interventions implemented in secondary
schools had a signiﬁcant average effect size of 0.42
(p = 0.006). The difference in the effect sizes between
secondary school population and elementary school popu-
lation is 0.36 SDs, which is marginally statistically sig-
niﬁcant (p = 0.076).

Interactions

The interaction analysis identiﬁed a marginally signiﬁcant
differential effect
for personnel by presence of CBT
(β = −0.75, p = 0.059). On average, clinicians have higher
effect sizes with CBT (ES = 0.59, p = 0.007) than they do
without CBT (ES = −0.27, p = 0.325). Teachers have smaller
average effect sizes, with average effect sizes for CBT of 0.07
(p = 0.295) and for without CBT of −0.04 (p = 0.732).

In addition, a signiﬁcant differential effect for personnel
(β = 0.83,
identiﬁed by intervention type
also was
p = 0.024). On average, interventions delivered by clin-
icians for targeted populations have a larger effect size
(ES = 0.92, p = 0.023) compared to interventions for the
universal population (ES = 0.26, p = 0.044). On the con-
trary, although no signiﬁcant effect sizes were found by
universal
teacher-delivered

interventions

population and targeted population, the magnitude of the
effect sizes showed that teacher-delivered intervention for
universal population had higher effect sizes (ES = 0.09,
p = 0.297) compared to the effect sizes of targeted popu-
lation (ES = −0.08, p = 0.499).

The effect sizes for different grade levels also varied sig-
niﬁcantly by delivery personnel (β = 0.78, p = 0.049). At
secondary school level, the effects of interventions delivered by
clinicians have a larger mean effect size of 0.81 (p = 0.012)
compared to interventions delivered by teachers with a mean
effect size of 0.03 (p = 0.711). At elementary school level, no
difference in effect size was identiﬁed by delivery personnel.
Effect sizes for teacher-delivered interventions were similar
across grade levels, with an average effect size of 0.06
(p = 0.316) at the elementary school level and an average effect
size of 0.03 (p = 0.711) at the secondary school levels.

Moreover, signiﬁcant differential effects were identiﬁed
(β = 0.89,
for outcome types by delivery personnel
p = 0.017). Interventions with outcomes on anxiety deliv-
ered by clinicians have a signiﬁcantly larger effect size
(ES = 0.86, p = 0.004) compared to those delivered by
teachers (ES = 0.03, p = 0.657). Those with outcomes on
depression have a different trend. Teacher-delivered inter-
ventions on depression have a somewhat higher effect size
(ES = 0.07, p = 0.368) than those of clinician-delivered
interventions on depression (ES = 0.01, p = 0.980).

No signiﬁcant differential effects were found for inter-
vention outcomes (depression vs. anxiety) by intervention
design (β = −0.39, p = 0.219).

Exploratory and Sensitivity Analyses

In exploratory analysis, an additional moderator called waitlist
is included in the meta-regression model. The waitlist mod-
erator is coded as 1 when the control group adopts business as
usual or waitlist, which are considered as inactive group. It is
coded as 0 when the control group has an active intervention
serving as a placebo as compared to the real treatment. After
adding this moderator, estimates and signiﬁcance values were
broadly similar to the original results.

Two types of sensitivity analyses were performed on the
two moderators with arbitrary cut-off points: program duration
and sample size. In the ﬁrst round of sensitivity analysis,
duration and sample sizes were coded as continuous variables.
In the second round, they were coded as categorical variables
with three levels using 33% and 66% percentile values as

niﬁcance values were broadly similar to the original results.
Results of the exploratory and sensitivity analyses are available
from the authors upon request.

Publication Bias

Applying the weight-function model, this study found sig-
niﬁcant publication bias. In the adjusted model, the test for
heterogeneity is signiﬁcant (Q [df = 92] = 1485, p < 0.001).
Likelihood ratio test for the model result is signiﬁcant (x
squared = 81.88, p < 0.001). This means that the estimated

pooled effect of school-based programs is upwardly adjus-
ted, suggesting that statistically signiﬁcant positive effects
were 38.90 times more likely to be reported than non-
signiﬁcant results. Readers should exercise caution when
interpreting the results since there is a good chance that the
overall effect is overestimated.

Risk of Bias Analysis

Since this meta-analysis applied stringent inclusion criteria,
all the studies fulﬁll the JBI Checklist’s criteria except the
sixth criteria, therefore only sixth criteria were coded: Were

outcomes assessors blind to treatment assignment? The risk
implied in the sixth criteria is that when assessors of the
targeted outcomes are aware of participants’ allocation to
the treatment or control,
there may exist measurement
errors. Among the 29 included studies, seven are blinded,
16 are not blinded, and six are unclear. Table 7 presents the
risk of bias analysis. Overall, there is a low risk of bias
among the included studies.

Discussion

There is an urgent need for schools to provide more mental
health services and support; however, existing meta-
analyses are insufﬁcient
in providing evidence-based
insights on high-quality interventions. School-based men-
tal health interventions are promising tools to protect
school-aged children, so there is a pressing need to identify
and disseminate evidence-based models to address the
increasing number of children with depression and anxiety
in schools. This meta-analysis aims to identify elements of
effective school-based mental health interventions targeting
depression and anxiety for K-12 students. This meta-
analysis only included RCTs and used more stringent
inclusion criteria (e.g., baseline equivalence, no signiﬁcant
differential attrition) and additional moderators (e.g., sam-
ple size and program duration) than previous reviews. The
results indicate that, overall, compared to control groups,
there was a signiﬁcant positive mean effect of school-based
interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety.

publication bias, which was found to be likely in this study.
The overall ﬁndings disagree with a previous systematic
review and meta-analysis that found a lack of evidence of
the effectiveness of school-based interventions focusing on
depression or anxiety (Caldwell et al., 2019). One reason to
explain this disparity may lie in the method: the present
study used a random-effects model looking across studies

interventions. In addition,

Apart from main ﬁndings, the moderator analyses help us
gain a better understanding of the characteristics of effective
depression- or anxiety-focused interventions. One interest-
ing ﬁnding is that interventions focused on anxiety are more
effective than those on depression for the K-12 population.
Furthermore, the results ﬁnd that CBT programs were more
common and had signiﬁcantly higher effect sizes than
programs of other types. This supports the existing wide-
usage of CBT programs (Werner-Seidler et al., 2017) and
conﬁrms previous research establishing CBT as an essential

component in depression and anxiety reduction for school-
intervention
aged children (Rooney et al., 2013). For
delivery, this study ﬁnd that teacher-delivered programs had
a lower mean effect than clinician-delivered programs, such
that while clinician-delivered programs had signiﬁcant,
teacher-delivered programs had null
positive impacts,
effects. This ﬁnding is consistent with one previous meta-
analysis on this topic, which found that programs delivered
by non-school personnel are more effective (Werner-Seidler
et al., 2021). Grade level was a marginally signiﬁcant
moderator, with interventions being more effective on the
secondary-school population compared to the elementary-
school population. No signiﬁcant impacts were found in
other moderators: program type (universal vs. targeted),
program duration, and sample size. The result on program
type disagrees with a previous meta-analysis that suggests
targeted programs being more effective compared to uni-
versal programs (Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). The null
ﬁnding from program type may be a result of offsetting
effects between targeted programs’ pros and cons. Targeted
programs’ screening and selection process may embarrass
students, which further exacerbates their depression and
anxiety. The positive effects brought by targeted programs
may be nulliﬁed by the negative consequences of labeling
and stigmatizing students (Huggins et al., 2008). This
supports the notion that both targeted and universal program
types are useful, and more beneﬁts can be reaped if suitable
programs are matched with suitable delivery personnel and
treatment populations.

Moreover, the moderator analyses indicate that study-
related factors are not signiﬁcant moderators of impacts.
While short-duration interventions had a signiﬁcantly
positive mean effect while long-duration interventions had
no signiﬁcant effect, this difference was not signiﬁcant.
Similarly, small sample sizes were associated with sig-
niﬁcantly positive effect sizes, while large sample sizes had
no signiﬁcant effects, yet the difference between these was
not signiﬁcant. While intervention duration and sample size
may not be signiﬁcant moderators, another possible expla-
nation is that intervention duration and sample size do not
have an impact on the intervention results when using the
in the analyses (intervention duration:
arbitrary cutoff
12 weeks; sample size: 250).

Interesting ﬁndings come from interaction analyses
related to delivery personnel, an additional moderator many
failed to include. The results
previous meta-analyses
demonstrated differential effects for delivery personnel by
four pairs of interacting moderators. First, the effect sizes
vary for personnel by intervention design. Clinicians had
higher effect sizes with CBT programs than with non-CBT
programs. This suggests that CBT programs have better
effects when they are delivered by personnel with psycho-
training, while

non-CBT programs have null effects no matter who they are
delivered by. This makes sense because delivering CBT
programs needs rigorous training and experience working in
mental health ﬁelds.

Second, the effects of interventions vary for personnel by
intervention type. Clinician-delivered programs had higher
effect sizes for the targeted population than for the universal
population (though both were signiﬁcant and beneﬁcial);
while teacher-delivered programs showed the opposite
pattern, although both were non-signiﬁcant. Clinicians tend
to have better effects when delivering programs to the tar-
geted population. In targeted approaches, children demon-
strate symptoms of depression or anxiety. In such cases,
clinicians have more expertise in treating these symptoms
compared to classroom teachers, so clinicians are likely to
use more professional strategies when delivering programs
to the targeted population.

Third,

the effect sizes of interventions also vary for
personnel by grade level. Compared to teachers, clinicians
had a noticeably larger mean effect size at the secondary
school level. Teachers had similar (non-signiﬁcant) effect
sizes at the elementary school level and at the secondary
school level. One explanation for this may be that because
adolescents experience a more severe level of mental health
impairment than children (Olfson et al., 2015), adolescents
may be more receptive to CBT interventions delivered by
clinicians. It may also be that older students are more able to
engage with and understand the content of the intervention,
due to their more mature cognitive processes (Stice et al.,
2009). This also ﬁts with recommendations to target these
symptoms early (ages 11–15), before those behaviors and
beliefs become ingrained (Gladstone et al., 2011).

Fourth, the effects of interventions vary for personnel by
they had larger
intervention outcomes. For clinicians,
impacts on average on anxiety outcomes, with null effects
on depression outcomes, while for teachers, they had null
effects on both depression and anxiety outcomes.

Limitations and Strengths

Readers may want to take note of several limitations when
this study only focuses on
interpreting the results. First,
depression and anxiety outcomes. In the process of coding,
the authors found some other interesting outcomes worth
investigating, such as internalizing problems, stress, externa-
lizing problems (Fung et al., 2019), worry (Skryabina et al.,
2016), depression literacy (O’Kearney et al., 2009), stigma,
and help-seeking tendencies (Link et al., 2020). The limited
number of studies investigating these outcomes restricts this
study’s ability to perform meaningful meta-regression analy-
sis. Future studies can focus on these commonly under-
researched outcomes of interest. Second, the authors were not
able to extract information on socio-economic status (SES) for

all studies, which could be a valuable moderator to the out-
comes. SES may have impacts on the prevalence of mental
health issues, access to treatment and support, the delivery
personnel of mental health interventions. SES can be reﬂected
in free and reduced lunch eligibility, household median
income, single or double parenting etc. Future studies can
examine the moderator effect of SES on depression and
anxiety. Third,
two of the twelve inclusion criteria used
arbitrary cut-off points, which may have led to the exclusion
of quality articles. However, during the screening process,
only 10 studies were excluded because they have a sample
size smaller than 60 and six studies were excluded because
the program duration is less than ﬁve weeks. In total, this
means that 7.33% of the studies were excluded in the full-text
review stage due to these arbitrary cut-offs, so the results are
likely not changed substantially by their exclusion. Fourth,
publication bias was identiﬁed in the sample. That likely
means there are many studies that have not been made public,
and those studies likely have null effects. The average effect
sizes reported here are likely larger than what would be seen if
all studies were reported.

Despite these limitations, this study has a number of
strengths and makes signiﬁcant contributions to existing
literature. Unlike previous meta-analyses on this topic, this
article adds program duration, sample size, delivery per-
sonnel, and grade level as moderating factors. Under-
standing the effects of
these additional moderators is
important for making evidence-based decisions as well as
designing future interventions. The ﬁndings related to the
heterogeneity of delivery personnel and its interactions with
other program features have implications for policymakers
and practitioners.

Recommendations for Future Research

Future meta-analyses may beneﬁt
from doing further
moderator and interaction analysis in this vein. Moreover,
inclusion criteria to
this study applied more stringent
identify high-quality primary studies. The quality of sys-
tematic reviews depends on the quality of primary studies.
Many previous meta-analyses acknowledge inconsistencies
in primary studies’ quality as one limitation (e.g., Gerlinger
et al., 2021). This study only included RCTs that meet
certain standards, such as having equivalence in baseline
conditions, low attrition rates, etc. However, the ﬁeld would
be stronger with more rigorous studies, that report more
details about the population, such as SES data, as well as
better descriptions of the counterfactual. Additionally, there
is a dearth of effective programs at the elementary level as
well as those delivered by teachers. Future work should
explore if there are ways for teachers to deliver effective
mental health programming or whether it can be imple-
mented with younger students as a preventative approach.

Implications for Policy

study highlights

This meta-analysis provides updated evidence and has
practical implications for policymakers. While child and
adolescent mental health has always been a concern, the
need for services for school-age children is even greater, as
mental health needs have increased as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic (Pfefferbaum, 2021). Given limited
resources, investment in students’ mental health and overall
in
well-being often faces competition from investment
academic achievement given the intense pressure to
enhance performance (Zhang & Storey, 2022). It is essential
that any efforts to provide school-based mental health
interventions using this limited funding prioritize evidence-
based interventions.
The current

that depression- and
anxiety-focused school-based interventions are more effec-
tive when delivered by professionals, such as certiﬁed
clinicians or psychologists, compared to classroom teachers
or school-health staff. In reality, this need is unmet by many
schools due to a severe shortage of clinicians countrywide,
not to mention pediatric clinicians (Elias, 2021). Policy-
makers
creative
incentives, such as reducing costs to obtain certiﬁcations or
enabling smoother transitions from associate degrees to
bachelor’s degrees, to build a pipeline for school-based
mental health clinicians (Kirchner & Cuneo, 2022).
Although this meta-analysis concludes that

teacher
interventions are not effect, some school districts may be
unable to employ enough clinicians to provide mental
health supports to their students. In those cases, where
schools must rely on teachers to deliver interventions, based
on data from other meta-analyses and applying a caution
approach, we recommend focusing the available mental
health professionals on the targeted populations at the sec-
ondary level while having teachers provide universal
interventions at the elementary level. Another policy take-
away is that innovative programs are not necessarily better
than traditional programs. There is a lack of conclusions on
new interventions’ (e.g., mindfulness, yoga, positive psy-
chology) effectiveness, but ample evidence on CBT pro-
grams’ efﬁcacy.

should consider

Conclusion

Past meta-analyses provide many insights, yet they fail to
use stringent criteria and diverse moderators. In light of the
increasing incidence rates of depression and anxiety among
children, there is an imperative to provide proven services to
school-aged children. To synthesize rigorous past studies,
this meta-analysis only included RCTs and used more
stringent inclusion criteria (e.g., baseline equivalence, no

signiﬁcant differential attrition) and additional moderators
(e.g., sample size and program duration) than previous
reviews. This meta-analysis found that, overall, school-
based mental health interventions school settings are effec-
tive at reducing depression and anxiety. However, these
impacts may be somewhat inﬂated due to likely publication
bias. Moderator analysis shows that anxiety-focused inter-
ventions are more effective than depression-focused pro-
grams, cognitive behavioral therapy is more effective than
other types of programs, clinicians are more effective than
teachers, and programs focusing on secondary school ado-
lescents are more effective than those focusing on elemen-
tary school children. For practitioners, useful implications
from this meta-analysis are that CBT is an effective program
type and certiﬁed clinicians are more effective as compared
to trained teachers in delivering mental health interventions,
while efforts should focus on the secondary school level.
More research is needed to explain the mechanisms behind
effective elements in interventions and differences between
children and adolescents. Although trained teachers are less
costly and more widely available, this meta-analysis found
that hiring professional psychologists or clinicians to deliver
interventions produces more visible enhancements. At the
same time, this ﬁeld-specialization can also reduce teachers’
burdens and help them focus on teaching. In the post-
identifying evidence-based mental health
pandemic era,
interventions can help us better prevent
the onset of
depressive and anxiety symptoms from an early stage.
