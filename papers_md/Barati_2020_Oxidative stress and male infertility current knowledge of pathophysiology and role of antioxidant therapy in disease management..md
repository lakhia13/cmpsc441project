Abstract
Infertility is a global health problem involving about 15% of couples. Approximately half of the infertility cases are related 
to male factors. The oxidative stress, which refers to an imbalance in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxi-
dants, is one of the main causes of infertility in men. A small amount of ROS is necessary for the physiological function of 
sperm including the capacitation, hyperactivation and acrosomal reaction. However, high levels of ROS can cause infertility 
through not only by lipid peroxidation or DNA damage but inactivation of enzymes and oxidation of proteins in spermatozoa. 
Oxidative stress (OS) is mainly caused by factors associated with lifestyle. Besides, immature spermatozoa, inflammatory 
factors, genetic mutations and altering levels of sex hormones are other main source of ROS. Since OS occurs due to the 
lack of antioxidants and its side effects in semen, lifestyle changes and antioxidant regimens can be helpful therapeutic 
approaches to overcome this problem. The present study aimed to describe physiological ROS production, roles of genetic 
and epigenetic factors on the OS and male infertility with various mechanisms such as lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, 
and disorder of male hormone profile, inflammation, and varicocele. Finally, the roles of oral antioxidants and herbs were 
explained in coping with OS in male infertility.

Introduction

Infertility  is  defined  as  an  inability  in  pregnancy  after 
12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. Almost 7% of 
couples worldwide are infertile, and half of the infertility is 
associated with male factors [1]. Various factors are involved 
in the pathophysiology of male infertility including OS. The 
male infertility is strongly associated with reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) [2]. ROS includes highly reactive free radi-
·−), hydrogen peroxide 
cals including superoxide anions (O2
 (H2O2), proxyl (·ROO) and hydroxyl (·OH) [3]. Low levels 
of ROS are necessary for sperm capacitation, hyperactiva-
tion,  acrosomal  reaction,  and  sperm–ovule  fertilization. 
However, high levels of ROS neutralize antioxidants in the 
seminal plasma and cause OS. Sperm damage by ROS is 
the main cause of infertility in 30–80% of infertile men; and 
these conditions ultimately damage DNA in the nucleus and 
mitochondria [4]. Sperm cells are highly sensitive to oxida-
tive damages. On the other hand, these cells have cytoplas-
mic membranes rich in unsaturated fatty acids, and thus they 
are faced with the lipid peroxidation under the influence of 
ROS [2]. Moreover, these cells are incapable of repairing 
damage by oxidative stress because they suffer from lack of 
essential cytoplasmic enzymes. Finally, lower motility and 
death of sperm occurs due to the loss of adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP) caused by lipid peroxidation followed by axone-
mal injury [5]. OS indirectly affects hypothalamic axes and 
can disrupt the secretion of sex hormones. ROS reduces lev-
els of male sex hormones and strikes their balance and can 
disrupt the reproductive system [6]. A wide range of factors 

E. Barati et al.

including genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle-related factors such 
as over-consumption of alcohol, smoking, radiation, obesity 
and also infection and varicocele could increase the level of 
OS in the body and lead to infertility [7]. Therefore, the role 
of the antioxidant system is essential to cope with excessive-
produced ROS. Antioxidant enzymes and molecules such as 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and cata-
lase (CAT) are abundant in plasma or natural sperm cells 
[8]. Most of these enzymes are encoded by NRF2, SOD, 
CAT, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione per-
oxidase (GPx) genes. Genetic mutations in these genes, in 
turn, cause infertility caused by OS in men [9]. As a result 
of these injuries, rates of fertilization and implantation are 
reduced and fetal growth is disturbed, and the likelihood of 
abortion increases. Since the balance between antioxidant 
levels and ROS maintains the redox homeostasis, the use of 
oral antioxidants as well as herbal medicine can help treat 
men with infertility. These antioxidants remove extra ROS 
and provide the redox balance [10]. To overcome infertil-
ity, the mechanisms that cause sperm damage, as well as 
their  therapeutic  methods,  should  be  considered  more. 
Recently, some literature reviews describing the effect of 
OS on the male reproductive system were published. For 
instance, Bui et al. reported the role of excessive ROS lev-
els in damage of genomic and mitochondrial DNA, short-
ening of telomere length, Y chromosomal microdeletions, 
and epigenetic changes [4]. Also, Agarwal et al. discussed 
about  infection  and  inflammation-induced  OS  and  male 
infertility [11]. In another report, Darbandi et al. described 
the mechanisms of ROS-mediated disturbance of male hor-
monal profiles [6]. But in the present review with a more 
comprehensive attitude, we discussed about different aspects 
of OS on male infertility including its pathophysiological 
and genetic aspects with an emphasis on the therapeutic use 
of antioxidants.

Physiological role of ROS in the male fertility

Reactive  oxygen  species  can  have  both  beneficial  and 
destructive  effects  on  sperm  functions  and  these  effects 
depend on the ROS level. Reactive species of oxygen and 
nitrogen should be regulated at appropriate levels to ensure 
physiological functions. A small amount of ROS is a prod-
uct of normal metabolism in stem cells, sperm and ovum; 
and these reactive species regulate important reproductive 
processes  such  as  capacitation,  acrosomal  reaction  and 
hyperactivation. Sperm capacitation is a necessary process 
to obtain fertilizing facility. ROS such as superoxide,  H2O2, 
nitrogen oxide (NO), and superoxide anion radical are con-
tributed in this procedure [3]. Superoxide anion generation 
in neutrophils is correlated with some proteins tyrosine 
phosphorylation. Two chief phosphotyrosine-containing 

1 3proteins, 81 and 105 kDa, are overexpressed in capacitat-
ing conditions. Catalase and superoxide dismutase elimi-
nate both tyrosine phosphorylation of p81 and p105 and 
sperm capacitation, confirm the role of hydrogen peroxide 
·− in these two procedures. ADPH oxidase inhibitors 
and O2
could reduce both tyrosine phosphorylation of p81 and p105 
and sperm capacitation whereas hydrogen peroxide induces 
these two procedures [12]. NADH and NADPH activate 
phosphorylation of p81 and p105 and sperm capacitation, 
but these procedures were not inhibited by catalase or SOD, 
·−. 
nor were they correlated with an elevated production of O2
So, these cofactors seemed to apply their function by mecha-
nisms altered from some other inducers [13]. Nitric oxide 
is another essential compound for sperm capacitation while 
inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) reduced the acro-
some reaction percentage. In addition, nitric oxide could 
modulate tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in sperm 
and there is a true association between nitric oxide-related 
tyrosine phosphorylation and sperm capacitation [14]. Dur-
ing human sperm capacitation, a double phosphorylation 
occurs in threonine–glutamine–tyrosine motif (P-Thr-Glu-
Tyr-P) of 105 and 81 kDa proteins. This phosphorylation 
is specifically regulated by nitric oxide and the protein Tyr 
kinase, protein kinase C, and MEK or MEK-like kinase are 
involved in this process [15]. The phospho-MEK-like pro-
teins are regulated by kinases and ROS and maybe display 
an intermediate phase among the initial events and the late 
tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with sperm capacitation 
[16]. However, The PI3K/Akt axis contributed in Tyr and 
Thr-Glu-Tyr phosphorylation and sperm capacitation but not 
MEK-like proteins [17]. Additionally, during capacitation, 
Ca2+ stimulates increased levels of cAMP. The cAMP, via 
an indeterminate serine/threonine phosphorylation, regu-
lates the superoxide anion generation and this procedure 
could lead to elevation of p81 and p105 phosphorylation 
[18]. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activates 
the protein kinase A (PKA) and could indirectly control the 
tyrosine phosphorylation of protein. Levels of cAMP are 
regulated by a balance of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phos-
phodiesterases (PDEs) activities, which are responsible for 
its production and degradation, respectively. Lefièvre et al. 
[19] suggested that cAMP level is under the regulation of 
AC, since activity of PDE is steady throughout sperm capac-
itation. Moreover, they suggest that low cAMP concentra-
tions are enough for PKA activation and sperm capacitation 
[19]. The above-mentioned contents strengthen the concept 
that differentially intricate pathways are required for sperm 
to develop capacitated. In addition, phosphorylation events 
may be involved in the acrosomal reaction which could be 
affected by OS. The acrosomal reaction is correlated with 
the generation of extracellular ROS by spermatozoa and both 
·− might be involved in the control of this pro-
 H2O2 and O2
cedure. A possible mechanism of ROS effects on acrosomal 

95

reaction may be explained by tyrosine phosphorylation of 
sperm proteins such as 70–105 kDa and this effect could par-
tially disappear by some ROS scavengers [13]. Acrosomal 
reaction and a partial pathway involved in sperm capacita-
tion are depicted in Fig. 1.

ROS sources in seminal plasma

Various sources cause OS including genital tract infection, 
varicocele, metabolic syndromes, smoking, excessive con-
sumption of alcohol and drugs, ionizing radiation, cell phone 
use, mental stress, severe exercise, spinal cord injury (SCI) 
and environmental pollution. In general, these sources are 
classified into endogenous and exogenous groups [20, 21].

Endogenous sources

Immature sperm

During the spermatogenesis, the sperm release may occur 
along with additional cytoplasm of the germinal epithelium; 
and spermatozoa are usually immature and non-functional. 
Sperms with excess cytoplasmic residues in the mid-piece 
are known as immature sperm. Additional cytoplasm in the 
mid-part of the sperm contains glucose-6-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (G6PD) enzyme. This cytoplasmic enzyme con-
trols the production of intracellular β-nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) through a shunt hexose 
monophosphate. The NADPH is used to fuel the production 
of ROS via NADPH oxidase situated within the sperm mem-
brane [22, 23]. In addition, there are abundant numbers of 
mitochondria in mid-piece that store energy for motility of 
sperm. Diaphorase, an enzyme at the mitochondrial respira-
tory chain, controls the ratio between reduced and oxidized 
forms of NADH; thus it contributes to the sperm energy 
balance. This oxidoreductase is integrated with the mito-
chondrial respiratory chain and generates superoxide anions, 
affecting the level of ROS [24]. Mitochondrial dysfunction 
could lead to ROS production and the ROS can influence 
mitochondrial integrity in sperm cells within a mutual pro-
cess; ROS leads to damage of mitochondrial membrane 
and this causes an elevation in ROS generation production. 
Indeed, mitochondria and sperm membrane are two main 
regions for ROS production in immature sperms [25].

Leukocytes

There are few leukocytes in each natural ejaculation. Accord-
ing to the WHO criteria (World Health Organization), if the 
white blood cell count is greater than 1 million per ml of 
semen, it is defined as leukocytospermia [26]. The increased 
ROS in semen due to leukocytospermia leads to a decrease

Fig. 1   Physiological and pathological roles of ROS in male reproduc-
tive  system.  Small  amount  of  ROS  plays  an  important  role  in  acro-
somal reaction and penetration of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida 
through  a  mild  lipid  peroxidation  (a).  ROS  production  is  an  early 
procedure in sperm capacitation. In the plasma membrane, an oxidase 
·− in the extracellular region which helps sperm capacita-
produces O2
tion activators. Diphenyliodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of this oxidase 
.− in oxidative stress condition. In addi-
could block production of O2
·−.  Intra-
tion,  superoxide  dismutate  (SOD)  could  block  the  extra  O2
tion of  H2O2 with a certain target in plasma membrane assists sperm 

capacitation  and  catalase  could  inhibit  excessive   H2O2.  Nitric  oxide 
(NO) produced by a NOS and induces capacitation. Adenylyl cyclase 
(AC)  is  a  possible  target  for  ROS  which  is  responsible  for  produc-
ing  cAMP  (b).  Sources  of  ROS  in  male  infertility  included  obesity, 
immature sperm, radiation, leukocytosis, alcohol drinking, and smok-
ing (c). The NADPH oxidase causes production of superoxide radical 
·−  turns  into   H2O2  in  cytosol 
(O2
and this agent produces hydroxyl radical (OH·).  H+ and OH.could ini-
tiate lipid peroxidation in the sperm membrane and excessive ROS in 
the sperm causes mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage (d)

·−)  in  sperm  lipid  membrane.  The  O2

in concentration of antioxidants resulting in damage to DNA 
in sperms [27, 28]. The number of leukocytes increases in 
the seminal plasma due to the inflammation or infection of 
the reproductive tract. Positive peroxidase leukocytes can 
produce ROS 1000 times more than sperm by increasing the 
production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADPH) through the transfer of hexose monophosphate [11]. 
Studies indicate that levels of ROS in fertile men are less than 
infertile men, and there is a direct relationship between OS and 
increased leukocyte count [29]. Seminal plasma leukocytes, 
except for macrophages, which are about 30%, are mainly pol-
ymorphonuclear (PMN). Leukocytes or white blood cells are 
created in response to stimuli during inflammation and infec-
tion and can create ROS up to 100 times more than inactive 
cells. Activation of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) system from 
PMN cells and macrophages leads to the respiratory burst and 

increases ROS products. Spermatic injury due to leukocyte 
occurs when the number of seminal plasma leukocytes such 
as leukocytospermia is significantly high [29]. The inflamma-
tion or infection should be taken into consideration in infertile 
men. Antibiotic treatment at low levels of leukocytospermia 
(0.2–1 × 106) significantly increases spontaneous pregnancy 
[30].

Exogenous sources

Smoking

According to a study in Morocco in 2017, cigarette smok-
ing is the most important factor affecting male infertility 
[31]. Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes disrupt lev-
els of hormones and affect effective parameters in semen 

1 3[32].  Smoking  can  damage  the  DNA  of  sperm  in  male 
reproductive cells through high accumulation of ROS in 
the sperm production site. Cigarette smoke contains a lot 
of toxic substances, carcinogens, and mutagenic substances 
in addition to stable and unstable free radicals and ROS in 
its particles. It also increases the production of superoxide 
anions,  H2O2 causing oxidative damage to lipid membranes 
of cells, proteins, enzymes, and DNA and subsequently leads 
to infertility [33]. Cigarette smoking reduces creatine kinase 
(CK) in sperm as an energy reservoir for rapid buffering and 
rebuilding ATP and plays an important role in the sperm 
motility [34]. In addition, ROS-induced damage of mito-
chondrial DNA results in reduced ATP and energy accessi-
bility, impending sperm motility [5]. Furthermore, cigarette 
smoking reduces the quality of semen, reduces acrosin activ-
ity, protein phosphorylation, disturbance of expression of 
micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) and histone-to-protamine 
transition and ultimately leads to infertility [35]. Damage to 
DNA and methylation patterns due to the increased level of 
ROS in tissues of people, who have been indirectly exposed 
to cigarette smoke, is also another side effect of cigarettes 
[36].

Alcohol intake

Excessive alcohol consumption also has devastating effects 
on the quantity and quality of sperm parameters. Excessive 
alcohol consumption is associated with a decrease in sperm 
motility and concentration and also reduces the percent-
age of normal morphology of sperm [37]. Alcohol causes 
spermatic chromatin disorders through apoptosis, thereby 
affecting the sperm motility, nuclear maturation and DNA 
integrity [25]. According to an animal study in 2017, the 
sperm  motility  and  count  in  rats  have  received  alcohol 
decreased significantly, as well as the level of MDA and 
SDF increased, in addition to a decrease glutathione and 
superoxide dismutase levels have been observed in the tes-
ticles of animals that received alcohol [38]. Ethanol causes 
changes  in  the  structure  and  function  of  mitochondria, 
reduces respiration and ATP levels, and increases the ROS 
production through its metabolism in the liver [39]. Alco-
hol consumption increases activities of cytochrome P450 
enzymes (CYP2E), which in turn increase the activity of 
NADPH oxidase, and then changes levels of certain metals 
(especially copper- and iron-free ions) in the body, and ulti-
mately increases the production of superoxide anions [39] 
in men who constantly consume alcohol; and nitric oxide, 
NO production increases via inducible nitric oxide synthase 
(iNOS) [40]. Nitrite oxide and its metabolite, peroxynitrite 
(ONOO-) act as mediators of mitochondrial dysfunction [40, 
41].

Radiation

Another exogenous factor is radiation that affecting male 
fertility and its biological consequences depend on the type 
of radiation, the amount of produced energy and duration 
of radiation [42]. Ionized and non-ionized radiation effec-
tively  affects  spermatogenesis.  Male  fertility  is  heavily 
influenced by thermal, radioactive, radio frequency (RF) 
and other hazardous radiation [43]. In recent years, there is 
a significant increase in the use of mobile phones, laptops, 
wireless systems and microwave that have raised concerns 
about  male  infertility  due  to  the  electromagnetic  radia-
tion. Electromagnetic radiation leads to a lot of changes in 
reproductive parameters by an OS induction. Based on this 
hypothesis, the impact of 3G cell phone radiation was stud-
ied on the reproductive tract of male rats in 2018. After 3G 
cell phone radiation, decreased spermatogenic cells, sperm 
membrane changes, increased ROS rate and lipid peroxida-
tion were observed along with a simultaneous reduction of 
sperm count and changes in morphology of sperm tail [44]. 
Cell phone radiation might affect cell plasma membrane and 
stimulates plasma membrane NADH oxidase which plays a 
key role in the various cellular harmful effects and leads to 
OS [45]. Another experimental study indicates that due to 
the electromagnetic radiation, the mitochondrial genome is 
damaged and leads to disturbances in the electron transport 
chain (ETC) resulting in OS [46]. Small changes in ROS 
may play an important role in the capacity of sperm, acro-
some reaction, and fertilization, but the OS caused by radi-
ofrequency radiation causes damage to spermatozoa [43]. 
Another study examined the impact of 2.45-GHz microwave 
on the histology and lipid peroxidation level in male rats. 
According to the present study, the exposure to microwave 
radiation for 2 hours per day for 35 days can cause oxidative 
changes in rats [47]. Other studies on the radio frequency 
radiation  and  its  effects  on  male  infertility  reported  the 
reduced glutathione level and disturbed sperm membrane 
integrity because of OS [48]. Therefore, researchers con-
cluded that the ROS production could be a major pathway in 
men’s infertility and radiation pathophysiology; hence, the 
antioxidant therapy is a useful way to minimize its harmful 
effects (Fig. 1) [46].

Environmental sources

One of the most important environmental ROS source is 
genital heat stress. Exposure to heat radiant for a long time 
leads to scrotal hyperthermia and excessive ROS produc-
tion [49]. Animal studies demonstrate that spermatogenesis, 
motility of spermatozoa, sperm concentration and sperm 
viability could be affected by heat stress [50, 51]. Also, stud-
ies demonstrate that heat stress and subsequently increased 
ROS may result in over-expression of caspase 3 that lead

E. Barati et al.

to apoptosis in various cell types including sertoli and ley-
dig cells [52–54]. Another environmental source of ROS is 
pollution such as phthalates, air pollution, and heavy met-
als. Phthalates are the man-made chemical that exist in per-
sonal care products, plastics, and food packaging materials 
that influence the general population. Animal experiments 
demonstrated that a high level of ROS production, the lack 
of testicular antioxidant, and a decrease in hormone levels 
are the results of phthalates exposure [55, 56]. A human 
study shows that phthalates could increase the level of OS 
in the testis and subsequently cause mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, and ultimately reduces the sperm function as a result 
of increased lipid peroxidation [57]. Air pollution can pro-
mote oxidative stress by affecting sperm lipid membrane and 
generate free radicals and decrease sperm parameters [58, 
59]. In addition, heavy metals are considered to be another 
source of ROS. Cadmium and lead appear to cause testicular 
oxidative stress and also can be damaging to sperm DNA 
and the reduction of semen parameters [60–62].

Roles of genetic and epigenetic factors in OS 
affecting the male infertility

Environmental, genetic, and lifestyle factors affect male 
fertility. Both factors are associated with levels of sex hor-
mones, chromatin stability, and sperm quality. About 20% 
of  observed  changes  in  sperm  count,  hormonal  levels, 
sperm morphology, and sperm chromatin parameters are 
influenced by hereditary factors [63–65]. Since the ROS is 
affected by endogenous and environmental factors and can 
cause great damage to sperm quality and DNA, antioxidant 
enzymes play important roles in counteracting OS during 
spermatogenesis and fertilization. A number of antioxidant 
genes involved in spermatogenesis include NRF2, SOD, 
CAT, GPX, PRX, GRX, TRX, and NOS. Enzymes, which 
are encoded by these genes, are widely used in antioxidant 
responses, syntheses, and reduction of GSH and redox cycle 
of reducing thiol during spermatogenesis.  Furthermore, 
most of these genes have ARE (antioxidant responsive ele-
ment) motifs in promoter sites, thereby facilitating the NRF2 
transcription pathway in the OS [66]. NRF2 is a key gene in 
the antioxidant defense because it is a nuclear transcription 
factor that can induce antioxidant enzymes through the ARE 
element [67]. In response to OS, NRF2 binds with AREs and 
regulate defensive mechanisms against OS. A study in mice 
lacking Nrf2 showed an important role for the NRF2 in pre-
vention of oxidative damage in spermatogenesis [8]. How-
ever, Chan et al. reported that the function of NRF2 gene 
is not essential for mouse fertility [68]. SODs and CATs 
are genes that are regulated by NRF2-ARE signal pathway, 
and they protect sperm from oxidative damage by superox-
ide and  H2O2. SOD cause superoxide radical destruction in 

molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Three families of 
SOD isozymes are found in humans: soluble SOD (SOD1), 
mitochondrial SOD (SOD2) and extracellular SOD (SOD3) 
[69] among which, SOD2 isozyme is more expressed in 
human sperms [70]. SOD gene has several varieties, and 
studies indicate that rs4880 polymorphism is effectively 
associated with an increased risk of infertility in men [71]. 
CAT is a heme enzyme that is encoded by CAT genes. This 
enzyme converts  H2O2 to oxygen and water, and eventu-
ally maintains normal levels of ROS and protects sperm 
against ROS [72, 73]. CAT gene also has a single-nucleo-
tide C-262T mutation in the promoter site and is effectively 
associated with increased infertility in men [72]. However, 
an animal study revealed that the fertility rate was normal 
at 3 months in wild-type, Sod−/− or Cat−/− knockout mice. 
But, the fertility rate was significantly decreased in all mice 
at 12 months [74]. NOSs constitute a family of enzymes that 
catalyze the production of nitric oxide (NO) from l-arginine 
and confront with ROS at low levels. NO plays role in the 
sperm motility, survival and acrosome reaction [75]. Three 
NOS isozymes have been found in mammals including neu-
ronal NOS (nNOS; NOS1), inducible NOS (iNOS; NOS2) 
and  endothelial  NOS  (eNOS;  NOS3)  [76].  These  three 
isoforms can be found in various testicular cells including 
sertoli cells, germ cells in seminiferous epididymis, leydig 
cells, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, and spermatozoa. 
The effective presence of the above isoforms in testes indi-
cates the importance of NOS in the spermatogenesis [77]. 
A study evaluated relationships of different nitrite oxide 
polymorphisms with male infertility. The results indicated 
significant relationships between T-786C and G894T poly-
morphisms, reduced sperm parameters, and increased OS 
[78]. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are other proteins 
that catalyze the GSH binding to xenobiotic electrophilic 
substrates  as  causes  of  ROS  [79].  GST  family  includes 
three large subgroups namely cytosolic, mitochondrial, and 
microsomal GSTs [80]. In humans, GSTs include mito-
chondrial GSTK1, microsomal MGST1-MGST3, and cyto-
solic GSTA1-GSTA5, GSTZ1, GSTM1-GSTM5, GSTO1-
GSTO2,  GSTP1,  and  GSTT1-GSTT4  [81].  Studies  on 
different GST genotypes indicate that the removal of GSTT1 
and GSTM1 genes, as well as point mutations in GSTP1 
gene, is associated with an increase in the male infertility 
risk [82]. TPX, PRX, and GRX enzymes are involved in 
reducing cellular thiols. GRXs and TRXs jointly catalyze the 
reduction of protein-mixed disulfides [83]. TRX1 isozyme 
exists in the cytosol and nucleus, while TRX2 is specifically 
expressed in mitochondria [84]. PRX enzymes constitute a 
group of peroxidases that destroy organic hydroperoxides 
and  H2O2. GPX family catalyzes the reduction of thiol with 
glutathione [85]. Among its isozymes, GPX4 is dominant 
in  testes  and  is  vital  to  spermatogenesis  [86].  GPX5  is 
expressed in the epididymis caput and probably maintains 

1 3sperm DNA integrity [87]. As mentioned above, the genetic 
polymorphisms found in the genes involved in the OS sys-
tem  can  affect  male  infertility.  Genetic  polymorphisms, 
depending on their position on the gene map, can alter the 
expression and structure of a protein [88, 89]. Genetic vari-
ations can occur on the coding or non-coding regions of the 
genes. Non-coding region mutations, as well as mutations 
in the coding regions, can affect the gene expression and 
RNA splicing. Mutations in promoter regions can be directly 
related to gene expression [90–92]. Studying the molecular 
effects of polymorphisms in vitro and in vivo conditions 
are time-consuming and costly. Some previous studies have 
shown that computational analyses with bioinformatics tools 
can be a quick and cost-effective way in molecular analyzes, 
especially in investigating the molecular effects of genetic 
mutations [93, 94]. The important genes associated with the 
OS system and the role of their genetic variation in male 
infertility are summarized in Table 1.

Epigenetic  regulations  are  precise  mechanisms  that 
ensure that gene expression is regulated in normal growth 
[105].  Epigenetic  changes  regulate  the  gene  expression 
and are not associated with the direct change in the DNA 
sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methyla-
tion, histone changes, and performance of non-coding RNAs 
are essential for a number of biological processes including 
genomic imprinting and chromosome X inactivation [106]. 
Epigenetic markers, which play major roles in the gamete 
viability in sperms, are obtained during the cell growth and 
differentiation. Sperm DNA epigenetic planning happens 
at numerous important steps of spermatogenesis. In male 
rodents, expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DMT1) is 
upregulated in primary meiotic germ cells [107]. Testicu-
lar tissues from fertile male display restricted expression 
of DMT1 gene in pachytene spermatocytes, spermatogo-
nia, and round spermatids [108]. It is reported that genes 
involved in spermatogenesis could experience epigenetic re-
programming during maturation in epididymis. So, testicular 
and epididymal pathology could play a possible role in dis-
ruption of normal DNA sperm methylation program [109]. 
ROS leads to hypomethylation which is associated with ser-
toli cell-only syndrome, testis cancer, and hypospermatogen-
esis in humans [110]. However, some possible mechanisms 
for disrupted methylation of sperm DNA may exist including 
failures in the folate metabolizing pathway and OS [111]. OS 
results in breaks of the DNA strands and the generation of 
DNA base adducts such as  O6-methylguanine and 8-OH-dG, 
both described to affect the interaction of the DNA and DNA 
methyltransferases [112]. The  O6-methylguanine [113] or 
8-OHdG presence in CpG sequences [114], mainly prevents 
the adjacent cytosine methylation and eventually results in 
total DNA hypomethylation [111]. The folate/homocysteine 
metabolic pathway is necessary for the production of methyl 
donors and consequently is crucial for the DNA methylation 

99

process in all cell types [115]. Failings in the folate pathway 
could lead to reducing the levels of S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) and have been associated with hypomethylation of 
DNA [116]. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
is an important enzyme in folate pathway which converts 
the 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyl tetrahy-
drofolate. The latest compound provides methyl groups for 
conversion of homocysteine to methionine [117]. OS and 
hyper-homocysteinaemia have been associated with hypo-
methylation of somatic cell DNA. However, aberrations in 
metabolism of homocysteine could still possibly be cor-
related with changes in methylation of sperm DNA [111]. 
Further studies are necessary to access precise mechanisms 
of intermediary damage by ROS on epigenetic processes.

Effect of OS in cellular components

The role of OS in DNA damage

A  high  level  of  DNA  damage  usually  occurs  in  sperms 
simultaneous with infertility [46, 118]. Undoubtedly, fac-
tors that enhance the level of ROS can affect the integrity 
of sperm chromatin. Guanine base (G) is the most common 
DNA’s organic base that is exposed to oxidative attack by 
free radicals and converts to 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHG). 
According to conducted surveys on DNA of infertile men’s 
sperms  and  their  comparison  with  fertile  individuals,  it 
is found that 8-OHG in infertile individuals is about 100 
times more than fertile ones. OS leads to the production 
of oxidized DNA base compounds such as the 8-hydroxy-
2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) especially in genome locations 
that are less protamine [119].

Spermatozoon  has  8-oxoguanine  DNA  glycosylase 
enzymes in the base excision repair (BER). This glycosy-
lase is connected to the nucleus and mitochondria of sperm 
and can actively separate 8OHdG and release additional 
base compounds into the extracellular space. Spermato-
zoa do not have downstream compounds of BER pathway 
including apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and XRCC1. 
Due to this incomplete repair capacity of DNA, abasic sites 
arise in locations that are under the influence of 8OHdG. 
These sites destabilize the ribose-phosphate and lead to the 
b-elimination or opening ribose cycle response and DNA 
strand fragment. This biochemical aspect of DNA is known 
as the main cause of the onset of cancer in other types of 
cells. Therefore, the base oxidative DNA damage not only 
is a mutagen but also indirectly fragments DNA [120]. The 
deficiency in the protection by antioxidants due to exogenous 
and endogenous factors leads to the oxidative damage in 
sperm and eventually DNA damage [121]. DNA damage 
causes a number of changes such as a single or double-strand 
fragment, DNA fragmentation, the creation of free-base

sites, changes in purine, pyrimidine, deoxyribose, and DNA 
crosslinking [46]. These changes can lead to stopping or 
starting gene transcription, induction of final transduction 
pathways, increased degradation of telomeric DNA, replica-
tion errors, genomic instability, and transversion from CG 
to AT [122]. Sperms of patients with severe DNA oxidative 
damage are degenerated and absorbed through the spermato-
genesis and sperm maturation in the epididymis resulting in 
reduced sperm count in these patients. DNA fragmentation 

is the final stage of ROS damage and is often seen in sper-
matozoa of infertile men [123]. There is a close relationship 
between ROS and sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF). SDF 
can occur for several reasons including varicocele, infection, 
aging, heat, lifestyle-related factors, incomplete protamina-
tion, and occasionally for no reason. A large number of them 
are mediated by ROS, and thus ROS is the main cause of 
SDF creation. ROS also can damage mitochondrial DNA 
of sperm. Since mtDNA have a circular structure with few 

1 3DNA base pairs, lack of histones and absence of nucleotide 
excision repair (NER) pathway is more susceptible to ROS 
attack. In addition, ROS can damage the inner mitochondrial 
membrane and thus directly damage mtDNA and simulta-
neously cause electron leakage from the electron transport 
chain, which in turn increases the production of OS [4].

The role of OS in spermatic membrane lipid 
peroxidation

Sperms  are  particularly  susceptible  to  injuries  by  ROS 
because, on the one hand, their plasma membranes are full 
of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with multiple dou-
ble bonds, and on the other hand, the cytoplasm rates of 
antioxidant enzymes in sperms are extremely low. Induction 
of lipid peroxidation cascades is a result of the exceeded 
level of ROS in stressed sperms leading to reduced sperm 
function [124]. Extensive lipid peroxidation changes the 
accumulation, structure, and dynamics of lipid membranes, 
and since these lipids are highly reactive compounds, it 
can produce a large amount of ROS [125]. Hydroxyl radi-
cal (·OH) is a powerful lipid peroxidation initiator (Fig. 1). 
Most of the unsaturated fatty acids of the sperm membrane 
are non-conjugated double bonds separated by methylene 
groups. The presence of double bonds near the methylene 
group weakens H–C bonds of methylene, thereby increas-
ing the likelihood of hydrogen separation. When hydrogen 
is separated, free radicals are created and the location of 
double bonds changes in such a way that the created radical 
is stabilized. This radical contains two double bonds that 
are separated by a single bond. Therefore, lipids containing 
a large number of double bonds in the vicinity of methylene 
groups are highly susceptible to O2 peroxidation for radical 
creation. Conjugated radicals rapidly react with lipid peroxyl 
radicals (·ROO) that in turn separate hydrogen atoms from 
other lipid molecules to create lipid hydroperoxide (ROOH) 
[126]. Increased levels of ROS during a series of responses 
including the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups (SH-) decrease 
the phosphorylation of the axonal protein, thereby decreas-
ing the sperm motility. Hydrogen peroxide (a kind of ROS) 
can pass through the membrane of sperm and enter the cyto-
plasm. Hydrogen peroxide in the sperm cytoplasm inhibits 
activities of certain enzymes including G6PD. This enzyme 
regulates the entry of glucose into the hexose monophos-
phate  path  (pentose  phosphate  pathway).  Under  normal 
conditions, this pathway produces reduced NADPH for cel-
lular reduction responses. Inhibition of hexose monophos-
phate shunt reduces the production of NADPH as a reduc-
tion equivalent in sperm. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is 
a major antioxidant enzyme in the sperm and uses reduced 
glutathione (SH-G) for reduction of ROS. As a result of the 
action of glutathione peroxidase, the reduced glutathione is 
converted into its oxidized form (G-S-S-G). Cells need the 

101

NADPH for re-reduction of oxidized glutathione; hence, the 
reduced NADPH level due to the inhibition of G6PD enzyme 
reduces the activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme as an 
antioxidant defense. Therefore, the level of phospholipids 
peroxidation  increases  in  the  sperm  membrane,  thereby 
reducing the fluidity of the membrane and reducing the 
sperm motility. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a sub-product 
of lipid peroxidation that is considered as a measure of per-
oxidation damage to spermatozoa in various biochemical 
tests [124]. Also, removing electrons from lipids of plasmid 
membrane by ROS can cause lipid peroxidation. This leads 
to the creation of a series of reduction–oxidation reactions 
that ultimately result in highly mutagenic and genotoxic 
electrophilic aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 
4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and acrolein. 4-HNE is derived 
from  lipid  hydroperoxides  (LOOHs)  of  fatty  acids  ω-6 
such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid [4]. 4-HNE is a 
very genotoxic by-product, while MDA is very mutagenic. 
4-HNE and acrolein significantly increase lipid peroxidation, 
ROS production in the mitochondria, DNA fragmentation 
and apoptosis [127, 128]. High levels of ROS could interrupt 
mitochondrial membranes, resulting in caspases’ activation 
and eventually apoptosis. Cytochrome c release throughout 
the apoptosis further increases ROS levels, raising damage 
and fragmentation of DNA, and potentially enhances the 
apoptotic cycle [3, 103]. Therefore, the sperm plasma mem-
brane is a key target for ROS, which by stimulating cascade 
signals can damage the genetic composition of these cells. 
A recent study investigated the comparison of sperm param-
eters with MDA level as a factor for measuring the lipid 
peroxidation, NO, ascorbic acid and GSH in both infertile 
and unknown reproductive potential groups. Comparison 
of variables indicates that the sperm quality decreases in 
the infertile group, while NO, GSH and ascorbic acid levels 
increase. The results indicate that GSH and ascorbic acid 
levels probably increased to cope with the harmful effects 
of ROS and prevention of lipid peroxidation [129]. Given 
the above cases, determination of MDA level and total anti-
oxidant capacity (TAC) may be useful in the diagnosis and 
treatment of male infertility.

The role of OS on male reproductive hormones

Testicles’ OS, which may be due to the damage to Leydig cells 
and other endocrine structures such as the anterior pituitary, 
decreases testosterone production [130]. In normal steroido-
genesis, ROS is mainly produced by mitochondrial respiration 
and catalytic responses of cytochrome steroidogenic enzymes 
P450 [131]. OS increases the number of immature sperms 
through indirect effects on the production of male hormones 
during spermatogenesis [132]. Systemic hormones (FSH, 
LH, testosterone,  E2, PRL) adjust the total antioxidant capac-
ity [133]. Some hormones like testosterone and melatonin act

as antioxidants and protect sperm and other testosterone cells 
against damage by ROS [134]. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adre-
nal (HPA) axis is activated by the production of ROS and 
cortisol hormone is released in response to stress. This hor-
mone negatively affects the anterior pituitary gland through 
cross-talk between hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) 
and HPA axes, and finally, decreases secretes of LH and FSH 
hormones. As a result of low LH, it cannot stimulate Leydig 
cells to secrete testosterone.

Furthermore, the reduced FSH decreases the release of 
androgen-binding protein (ABP) to sertoli cells; hence, a 
general decrease in testosterone level occurs during the OS. 
ROS also affects the hypothalamo–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) 
axis and reduces secretes of T3 and T4. Reduced T3 decreases 
StAR mRNA levels in Leydig cells and decreases testoster-
one production. Increased OS also decreases insulin secretion 
from the pancreas and negatively affects the secretion of  T3, 
thereby affecting the biosynthesis of testosterone. Conditions 
like obesity not only involve HPA and HPT axes but also cause 
the secretion or non-secretion of several metabolic hormones 
manifesting the sequence of ROS induction in male repro-
duction. ROS due to obesity can force adipocytes to secrete 
more leptin. This hormone together with insulin negatively 
adjusts the secretion of  T3, and thus inhibits the performance 
of testes. Secreted leptin by adipocytes inhibits the emis-
sion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the 
hypothalamus. After exposure to ROS, the aromatase activ-
ity increases resulting in excessive production of testicular 
 E2 hormones. OS also increases the secretion of inhibitory 
hormones; hence,  E2 hormones and the inhibitor prevent the 
secretion of testosterone. The exposure to ROS increases the 
PRL secretion from the anterior pituitary, and thus decreases 
GnRH secretion. The genital tract infection can produce some 
proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6, thereby re-inhibiting 
the secretion of GnRH and testosterone hormones. Therefore, 
ROS can reduce the production of testosterone by affecting the 
hormonal axis alone or end up in cross-talk between different 
endocrine systems. Reducing testosterone disrupts spermato-
genesis and produces immature sperm. Lack of testosterone 
as the main regulator of male reproductive behavior may lead 
to the suppression of sexual behavior among men. Therefore, 
ROS leads to male infertility by disrupting reproductive endo-
crine glands (Fig. 2) [6].

Effect of OS in pathophysiological process 
and male infertility

Inflammation and OS

Inflammation is the natural response of the host to micro-
bial attack or tissue damage and ultimately leads to arterial 

regeneration and improvement of its function [135]. Fol-
lowing the inflammation, neutrophils are the first immune 
cells presenting at the infection area; though macrophages 
also play an important role in the inflammatory response. 
Macrophages  and  other  stimulated  inflammatory  cells 
secrete  a  large  amount  of  prostaglandin  E2  (PGE2), 
cytokine, and NO. However, inflammation affects steroido-
genesis and spermatogenesis. In addition to inflammation, 
there is a significant reduction in testosterone levels and 
luteinizing hormone in the blood [136]. Inflammation also 
stops spermatogenesis and inhibits the sperm maturation 
process. Spermatocytes and spermatids are the main tar-
gets of inflammation. Epididymitis may be also affected by 
inflammatory attacks on testes. The inflammatory response 
is caused by leukocytes that penetrate semen and secrete 
antisperm  antibodies.  Decreasing  lipid  components  of 
sperm flagella membrane, the inflammation increases its 
hardiness and decreases sperm motility resulting in sperm 
agglutination and asthenozoospermia. As a result of these 
events, maturation processes such as acrosome reaction, 
capacitation, and oocyte penetration encounter problems 
[137]. However, evidence suggests that the relationship 
between  inflammation  and  OS  is  very  high  in  sperm. 
Semen of infertile men has ROS in addition to high lev-
els of proinflammatory factors and cytokines. Despite the 
fact that some external pathogenic factors such as bacteria 
may produce ROS, leukocytes are also the most important 
sources of semen ROS [138]. There are direct and indi-
rect ways to increase ROS level by leukocytes. Leukocytes 
indirectly increase ROS levels by producing proinflamma-
tory cytokines. In general, cytokines are proteins that act 
as signal molecules to regulate cellular responses such as 
inflammation. These proteins activate the xanthine oxidase 
system, raise ROS levels, and create OS.

On the other hand, by stimulating phagocytes and ini-
tiating the phagocytosis process, a high level of ROS is 
produced  that  reacts  with  the  spermatozoa  membrane 
and increases the ratio of oxidants-to-antioxidants. The 
OS caused by these conditions continues even after the 
elimination of pathogens [136]. Studies indicate that an 
increase in TNF-α of semen is associated with decreased 
number  and  mobility  of  sperm  and  its  morphological 
defect. Increased cytokine levels in semen due to the pro-
liferation and differentiation of beta cells, the prolifera-
tion of T cells and natural lethal cells cause apoptosis. 
Interleukin  1  alpha  and  interleukin  1  beta  also  induce 
apoptosis  through  the  proliferation  and  differentiation 
of beta cells, the chemical absorption of leukocytes into 
inflammation site, induction of neutrophils and production 
of monocytes. These cytokines also negatively affect the 
quality of semen. A study suggests that increased levels 
of interleukin 1 beta are associated with reduced sperm 
motility [139,  140]. These results are accompanied by a 

1 3103

Fig. 2   Effect  of  oxidative  stress  on  production  of  testosterone.  The 
hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal  axis  (HPG;  green  arrow)  regulates 
production of testosterone pathway in mammalian. The hypothalamus 
produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and this hormone 
stimulates  anterior  lobe  of  the  pituitary  gland  to  secrete  luteinizing 
hormone  (LH)  and  follicle-stimulating  hormone  (FSH).  FSH  affects 
sustentacular  cells  (SC)  to  release  androgen-binding  protein  (ABP) 
which this protein concentrates testosterone near spermatogenic cells. 
In  addition,  LH  affects  interstitial  cells  (IC)  to  release  testosterone. 
Excessive production of ROS activates hypothalamic–pituitary–adre-
nal axis (HPA; blue arrow) and affects hypothalamus to release corti-

cotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which stimulates the anterior lobe 
of  pituitary  gland  to  release  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH) 
and this hormone affects adrenal gland. The adrenal releases cortisol 
hormone in response to OS. This hormone negatively affects the ante-
rior  pituitary  gland  and  finally  decreases  secretion  of  LH  and  FSH 
hormones. In another pathway, obesity increases production of ROS. 
Excessive ROS stimulates adipocyte cells to produce leptin hormone 
and  this  hormone  inhibits  the  HPG  axis.  On  the  other  hand,  excess 
ROS negatively affect pancreas to decrease insulin production, which 
results in decrease of testosterone production

simultaneous increase in ROS and MDA levels. Concen-
trations of similar cytokines, which act as immune-reg-
ulating elements for gonads, increase with infection and 
damage to semen tissue. Participation of these cytokines 
in the inflammation has a direct relationship with leuko-
cytospermia.  In  inflammatory  conditions,  white  blood 
cells in semen penetrate the inflammation site. In normal 
conditions, leukocytes are prevented from going to the 
center of the seminal vesicle. In inflammatory sites, arter-
ies which feed testes are dilated and allow leukocytes to go 
to the vascular center and exit the vascular endothelium. 

In addition to these changes, the increased permeability 
leads to the fluid accumulation followed by swelling, pain 
and also the accumulation of immunoglobulins and other 
semen proteins in the reproductive system. The excretion 
of leukocytes from the seminal vesicle depends on the 
crosslinking responses that are activated by the release of 
inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the inflammation or 
physical damage to the reproductive system causes phago-
cytic cells to be absorbed into the injury site. Activated 
neutrophils by TNF-α produce oxygen and oxide nitride 
radicals and release their stored granular content resulting

in the host defense and local tissue degradation. Since the 
male infertility is often caused by infection or damage to 
testes; and inflammatory response in the male reproduc-
tive system has a negative effect on the sperm quality and 
fertility, and the inflammation process produces ROS, all 
possible measures to eliminate or reduce inflammation 
reduce OS and improve pregnancy (Fig. 3) [141].

Varicocele and oxidative stress

Varicocele is a main cause of infertility in men; and its inci-
dence is 15% in the whole men and 40% in infertile men [142]. 
OS is a major contributor to the pathophysiology of this dis-
ease. Increased level of ROS and reduced concentrations of 
antioxidants simultaneously intensify varicocele [143]. In men 
with varicocele, ROS is released from three types of repro-
ductive system cells under heat and hypoxic stress conditions. 
These cells include main epididymal cells, endothelial cells 
in the dilated pampiniform plexus and testicular cells such as 
developing germ cells, Leydig cells, macrophages, and peri-
tubular cells. In mitochondria, heat and hypoxic stress can 
directly activate complex III of the electron transport chain and 
cause the release of ROS. On the other hand, NO is released 
from testicular and endothelial cells in testis with varicocele 
and can nitrosylate complexes I and IV, and simulates complex 
III to further release ROS [144]. OS plays an important role in 
causing damage to testicular tissue. A great number of studies 
have measured OS markers in semen of infertile men with 

varicocele and compared their values to men with idiopathic 
infertility. The results indicate that infertile men with varicoce-
les have higher levels of ROS, free radicals such as NO, nitric 
oxide synthase and  H2O2, high levels of MDA and hexanoyl-
lysine (another product of lipid peroxidation) [145]. Spermatic 
veins are the main components of the pathogenesis of varico-
cele. Endothelial cells can produce a lot of ROS by certain 
stimuli. Plasma levels of NO and iNOS are higher in spermatic 
veins of infertile men with varicocele than their other veins 
[146]. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants have been 
also measured to investigate OS in infertile men with varico-
celes. Results indicate lower levels of seminal TAC in infertile 
men with varicocele than healthy participants [144]. However, 
some studies have reported that an early increase in concentra-
tions of antioxidants such as SOD and CAT is due to the appli-
cation of a defense mechanism to prevent the disease [147]. 
ROS level is high both in infertile men with varicocele and 
infertile men without varicocele, but it is much higher in the 
first group indicating that varicocele increases the production 
of ROS and subsequently the oxidative damage. Varicocele is 
also associated with the severity of OS; and the highest degree 
of varicocele leads to the highest OS [145].

Obesity and oxidative stress

Obesity  is  a  metabolic  disorder  characterized  by  envi-
ronmental, genetic, lifestyle and physical activity factors. 
Approximately 1.9 billion of the world’s population are 

Fig. 3   Schematic  illustration  of  spermatogenesis  in  the  seminifer-
ous  epithelium  in  an  inflammatory  condition.  In  the  inflammatory 
reaction,  sertoli  cells,  mast  cells,  and  resident  macrophages  release 
chemokine and cytokines such as IL1β, IL6, IL8, TNFα, and TGFβ. 

These  proinflammatory  molecules  cause  the  accumulation  of  leuko-
cytes in the seminiferous tubules. Leukocytes also increase the level 
of ROS and OS up to 1000 times compared to normal conditions, and 
result in failed spermatogenesis

1 3overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). 
Laboratory and clinical data indicate the negative effect of 
obesity on the male reproductive function. Determinants of 
sperm quality including the sperm count and its motility are 
lower and the DNA damage is higher in obese or overweight 
people compared with those with normal BMIs [148]. Con-
sequently, obesity increases the risk of infertility by more 
than 20% [36]. Obesity along with the chronic inflamma-
tion increases metabolic rate and ROS in the tissue of testes 
and sperm. OS in sperm and testis has a positive correlation 
with increasing BMI and sperm DNA damage, but a nega-
tive correlation with reduced sperm motility and acrosome 
reaction [149]. In addition, gonad temperature in obese men 
may also help to change sperm parameters. The optimum 
temperature of spermatogenesis is between 34 and 35 °C 
in humans, and the spermatogenesis process is put at risk 
at higher temperatures. In obese men, the increased scrotal 
fat directly increases the internal temperature of the gonad 
[150]. Typically, increasing testicular heat can significantly 
exacerbate OS, thereby reducing the mobility and concen-
tration of sperm and increase DNA damage [151]. It has 
been recently found that the OS of testicular tissue in obese 
rats is used to the increased MDA level and reduced SOD 
level. Obesity is associated with an increase in serum-free 
fatty acids, and unsaturated fatty acids are sensitive to ROS 
attacks, and thus the SOD rate decreases and MDA increases 
by peroxidation. Therefore, the long-term effects of obesity 
can reduce fertility in men due to increased OS [152]. OS is 
a common complication in many diseases such as infertility 
in men, and reactive oxygen species play important roles in 
spermatogenesis and reproduction. The normal functioning 
of sperm requires a balance between ROS levels and anti-
oxidants; hence, the use of natural antioxidants, healthy life-
styles, regular exercise, and proper diets lead to the weight 
loss and gradual BMI reduction that helps reduce OS and 
provide sperm health [153].

Effect of antioxidants and herbal therapy 
on improvement of sperm quality

Antioxidant system including enzymatic factors (superox-
ide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase), non-
enzymatic factors, and low-molecular weight compounds 
(glutathione, n-acetylcysteine, vitamin E, A and C, coen-
zyme Q10, carnitines, myo-inositol, lycopene and …), and 
nutrients (selenium, zinc, and copper) can protect the body 
against OS. Lack of one of these leads to a reduction in the 
antioxidant capacity of the plasma [154]. Many urologists 
prescribe oral antioxidants for infertility [155], probably 
as the OS in semen is due to the lack of antioxidants and 
its side effects. Ideally, an oral antioxidant should reach 
a high concentration in the reproductive tract and restore 

105

vital elements for spermatogenesis. In addition, antioxi-
dant supplementation should increase the seminal plasma 
clearance capacity and decrease ROS level in semen [156]. 
Nowadays, the use of herbal therapy has also been consid-
ered to prevent infertility because these antioxidants can 
reduce the destructive effects of oxidative stress [157].

Enzymatic factors

SOD metalloenzymes are effective antioxidant enzymes 
in  the  body.  These  enzymes  are  the  first  body  defense 
against the ROS. SODs convert the superoxide anion into 
 H2O2, and then the produced  H2O2 is eliminated by activi-
ties of glutathione peroxidase or catalase. SOD protects 
spermatozoa against  O2 toxicity, lipid peroxidation and 
ultimately OS [158]. There is no consensus on SOD con-
sumption dosage; however, the most commonly proposed 
treatment for oral consumption is 150 IU per day for at 
least 3 months [159]. Catalase exists in peroxisomes and 
converts  H2O2 into the water and molecular oxygen in two 
steps. This enzyme plays a major role in the capacitation 
of nitric oxide-induced sperm [154]. Glutathione peroxi-
dase converts  H2O2 to water or alcohol, provides the main 
protection against low levels of oxidative damage, and 
plays an important role in the defense of sperm [160]. 
Glutathione is a tripeptide containing sulfur and can be 
seen in GSH and GSSG. The decreased glutathione in the 
human seminal plasma leads to instability in the middle 
of spermatozoa and ultimately causes motion impairment 
[161]. Glutathione supplement plays a pathological role in 
infertile men in situations where reactive oxygen species 
or other toxic substances such as unilateral varicoceles or 
genital inflammation result in significant improvement in 
sperm parameters (number, mobility, and morphology). 
GSH also plays an important protective role against cell 
membrane lipid damage. Its effective dose is intramuscular 
600 mg per day for 2–3 months [162]. N-Acetylcysteine 
(NAC) is a glutathione precursor and stimulates the sperm 
motility. It effectively improves the volume of seminal 
fluid and its viscosity and increases the sperm motility in 
humans [163]. The most commonly used dose of NAC is 
600 mg per day as a combination with other antioxidants 
for at least 3 months [164].

Animal experiments

NAC protects sperm DNA against oxidative damage and 
can improve sperm parameters in mice [165]. The catalase 
present in the sperm of ram has a potential role in controlling 
oxidative stress by catalyzing  H2O2 [166].

Non‑enzymatic factors

Carotenoids are natural antioxidants that protect the integrity 
of the cell membrane, regulate the differentiation of epithe-
lial cells and contribute to the regulation of spermatogenesis. 
Lack of carotenoids in the diet can reduce sperm motility 
[154]. In humans, low serum levels of retinol reduce sperm 
quality [167]; hence the use of vitamin A can be used to treat 
male infertility [168]. The amount of vitamin C in semi-
nal plasma is ten times more than serum [169]. In humans, 
ascorbic acid levels are positively correlated with percent-
ages of normal sperms [170] and negatively with the DNA 
fragmentation [171]. These findings support the consump-
tion of vitamin C for treating male infertility. Proper vita-
min C dose for increasing sperm quality is oral 1 g per day 
[172]. Vitamin E protects the sperm cell membrane against 
the OS, prevents lipid peroxidation and traps free radicals 
of hydroxyl and superoxide [154]. A clinical trial indicates 
that sperm function improves after consuming 600 mg of 
vitamin E per day for 3 months. Other studies used lower 
doses (200 mg/300 mg) [173]. A study reported that the 
sperm motility increased in infertile men after oral consump-
tion of vitamin E. Improvement of sperm motility is asso-
ciated with the reduction of MDA production as the final 
product of lipid peroxidation. In addition, during 6 months 
of treatment, 21% of patients achieved pregnancy [174]. In 
general, these findings indicate that vitamin E can be a good 
choice for treating male infertility [175]. Coenzyme Q10 is 
a fat-soluble antioxidant that endogenously synthesizes and 
prevents the oxidation and lipid peroxidation. It also regu-
lates the mitochondrial electron transfer chain [176]. A num-
ber of clinical studies found a positive effect of coenzyme 
Q10 on male fertility. This antioxidant improves all sperm 
parameters [177] and has a protective effect against OS and 
DNA damage [178]. Moreover, the treatment with CoQ10 
improves sperm parameters in people with varicocele [176]. 
CoQ10 can regenerate other antioxidants such as vitamins 
E and C [179]. Selenium is a necessary nutrient for normal 
growth of testicles, spermatogenesis, and sperm motility and 
function. The selenium deficiency leads to the epithelium 
atrophy of seminiferous, spermatogenesis and sperm matura-
tion impairment, reduced volume of testes, decreased sperm 
motility and changed sperm shape (especially in the head 
and middle part) [180]. There is no fully precise mecha-
nism by which selenium reduces OS and improves sperm 
parameters, but is likely to be achieved by selenoenzyme 
such as GPX. An appropriate dose of selenium for oral use is 
80–300 micrograms per day alone or with other antioxidants 
for 3 months [181]. Low amounts of ROS are essential for 
capacitation and acrosome reaction. Therefore, the excess 
reduction of ROS concentration due to the use of antioxi-
dants may have reversible effects on fertility [182]. However, 
antioxidants neutralize the OS; and most studies indicate 

E. Barati et al.

that improvement of sperm parameters occurs when several 
antioxidants are used in combination. However, there is no 
definitive consensus on dose and duration of use of these 
substances; and there is a need for further studies [10].

Animal experiments

A study on cows indicated that retinol stabilizes sperm acro-
some membrane in the OS condition due to the high tem-
perature [167]. Vitamin C in mice in a dose equivalent to 
human dose (10 m/kg) can reduce MDA level and increase 
the number of sperms [183]. Another study shows that treat-
ment with ascorbic acid reduces peroxidation levels and his-
tological damage on seminiferous tubules in diabetic rats 
[184].

Other nutrients

In addition to antioxidants, there are a variety of therapies 
around the world for male infertility management. The recent 
therapies as assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) are not 
only costly but also have a success rate of only 10–30%. 
Accordingly, the use of herbal medicines as an alternative 
therapy or complementary technique has been taken into 
account more for coping with male infertility [157]. The 
active substances of plants, which improve fertility, include 
various chemical groups such as saponins, phytosterols, 
carotenoids, oxygenated volatile compounds, phenols, lig-
nans and alkaloids [185]. Withania somnifera (ashwagan-
dha) is the root of evergreen shrub in India. Studies indi-
cate that the oral intake of this plant increases the quality of 
semen, prevents the lipid peroxidation, regulates levels of 
reproductive hormones, and also decreases the risk of infer-
tility in men by reducing the level of OS [157]. Curcumin 
is a Chinese herb monomer that is extracted from yellow 
turmeric and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proper-
ties. According to a study on the effect of curcumin on sperm 
quality in patients with leukocytospermia, results indicate 
that curcumin significantly improves the sperm motility in 
patients and decreases  H2O2. Therefore, it overcomes male 
infertility by reducing OS [186]. Cinnamon has antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties. Therefore, 
the use of cinnamon has potential effects on the oxidative 
and antioxidant balance of testes and sperm quality; and its 
use is beneficial for men with asthenozoospermia [187]. 
Crocus sativus is a plant of iridaceae family and is tradition-
ally used for diseases of the digestive system, reproductive 
tract, and depression. Saffron plays a protective role against 
DNA damage, chromatin anomalies and provides the mem-
brane integrity [188, 189]. Nigella sativa (black caraway) is 
a herbal medicine that is applicable for a wide range of dis-
eases such as pulmonary problems, headache, rheumatism, 
gastrointestinal problems, and male sexual disorders [185]. 

1 3In one clinical trial, the use of seed oil for infertile men with 
different factors of infertility resulted in the enhancement 
of all semen parameters [190]. Pomegranate seeds contain 
fatty acids and phenolic compounds with antioxidant prop-
erties. Green tea can improve gametes in men and women 
by the ability of catechin polyphenol through eliminating 
ROS. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is considered as an 
active antioxidant that can potentially improve reproductive 
health by reducing the OS [191]. There is little information 
about exact mechanisms of these plants and infertility, but 
most findings have pointed out the antioxidant properties 
of plants.

Animal experiments

A  study  examined  the  long-term  effects  of  cinnamon 
crust oil on antioxidant levels of testes and sperm quality 
of mature adult rats. The results indicated a significant 
reduction in the level of MDA and a significant increase 
in  the  activity  of  glutathione  peroxidase  and  catalase 
[187]. A study on rats demonstrated that dietary Zn defi-
ciency decreases serum testosterone levels, increases OS 
and results in apoptosis of germ cells [192]. Catechins 
are the main components of green tea, which have higher 
antioxidant  activity  than  vitamin  C.  Catechins  in  rats 
were  observed  to  regulate  gene  expression  and  reduce 
ROS levels [193]. Animal studies indicate that the use 
of Crocus sativus (saffron) improves sperm parameters 
due  to  its  antioxidant  properties  [194].  In  addition,  it 
promotes semen quality by increasing testosterone levels 
[195]. Animal studies show that the alcoholic extract of 
black caraway seed improves the sperm survival and also 
increases the sperm motility. The precise mechanism of 
black caraway function is still unknown, but it seems that 
it increases the activity of beta-hydroxy steroid dehydro-
genase (a key enzyme in the synthesis of testosterone) due 
to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids, and thus it is 
useful for the fertility [196]  Sesamum indicum (sesame) 
is an annual plant and old crop which could improve the 
quality of sperm parameters in rat. Furthermore, sesame 
helps to make better spermatogenesis process by affecting 
the hypothalamus–pituitary–testis axis and increasing the 
blood testosterone [197]. Pomegranate seeds can improve 
the integrity of the sperm membrane and protect it against 
oxidative damage, and prevent the DNA damage by antiox-
idant properties by eliminating free radicals [198]. Ionid-
ium suffruticosum (L.) ging (Violaceae) is an important 
herbal medicine that is widely used as traditional medi-
cine. According to a study on infertile rats treated with this 
herbal medicine, results indicated that spermatogenesis, 
sperm count, and oxidative biomarkers of SOD and CAT 
improved after a treatment period. Therefore, the use of 
this herbal medicine for the treatment of male infertility 

107

was recommended in traditional medicine [199]. Grape 
seed  extract  acts  as  an  anti-inflammatory,  antioxidant 
and antibacterial agent and also has protective effects on 
the heart, liver, and nerve. Grape seed contains a special 
flavonoid called anthocyanin oligomers. This compound 
increases intracellular vitamin C level and thus destructs 
ROS and free radicals, and it has more antioxidant proper-
ties than vitamins C and E. In a study, the impairment of 
testicular activity was induced by aluminum chloride, and 
the sperm number and motility increased after interven-
tion with grape seed extract. It also protects sperm against 
DNA damage and protects testicles by reducing the NO 
activity [200].

Conclusion

OS is now considered as the main cause of male infertility. 
Despite the need for low levels of ROS for the physiologi-
cal function of sperm, its increased level disturbs sperm 
functions, thereby leading to male infertility by mecha-
nisms such as lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. There-
fore, the early diagnosis of infertility is necessary to pre-
vent its irreversible damage due to the OS in the long term. 
There are several tests for early diagnosis of high levels of 
OS factors. Results of measuring levels of ROS in semen 
as well as the determination of MDA and TAC levels can 
affect the male infertility diagnosis and treatment. Besides, 
the lifestyle change is the primary action to balance levels 
of ROS and antioxidants in the body and prevent oxida-
tive stress. Reduced smoking and alcohol, non-exposure to 
radiation, and selection of a proper diet along with planned 
physical activity have significant effects on reducing levels 
of OS and thus male infertility. Moreover, the use of oral 
antioxidants can also help to reduce OS, but more studies 
are necessary about their doses and duration.
