Abstract

Purpose of Review—Eating disorders are severe psychiatric disorders with a suspected 
complex bio-psycho-social etiology. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the recent 
literature on brain imaging in eating disorders.

Recent Findings—Food restriction as well as binge eating and purging behaviors are associated 
with lower regional brain volumes or cortical thickness, but those changes largely return to normal 
with normalization of weight and eating behavior. Computational modeling has started to identify 
patterns of structural and functional imaging data that classify eating disorder subtypes, which 
could be used in the future diagnostically and to better understand disorder specific 
psychopathology. The prediction error model, a computational approach to assess dopamine 
related brain reward function, helped support a brain based model for anorexia nervosa. In that 
model, the conscious motivation to restrict conflicts with body signals that stimulate eating, which 
causes anxiety and drives a vicious cycle of food restriction.

Summary—Novel brain research supports the notion that eating disorders have distinct 
neurobiological underpinnings. This new knowledge can be used to describe disease models to 
patients and develop novel treatments.

Introduction

Eating disorders (EDs) are severe psychiatric illnesses with complex biological, 
psychological and social underpinnings (1). Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by a 
body weight below of that expected for age and height, feeling fat despite being 
underweight, an intense fear of gaining weight and a disturbance how one’s own body 
weight and shape are experienced. A restricting type marked by food restriction and 
commonly over-exercising, has been distinguished from a binge-eating/purging type, where 
afflicted individuals eat large amounts of food in a relatively short period of time (“binge 
eating”), or engage in behaviors to counteract weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting or

use of laxatives or diuretics (“purging”). Individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) are usually 
at normal weight, and engage in recurrent binge eating and purging behavior at least once a 
week for at least three months. Binge eating disorder (BED) is also characterized by regular 
binge eating episodes that are followed by guilt and shame feelings, but without 
compensatory behaviors to counteract weight gain. Other EDs that are described in the 
feeding and eating disorders section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM–5) (1) are avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), pica and 
rumination disorder.

Over the past two decades brain research in EDs has increased dramatically. Earlier studies 
found in EDs that alterations in serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter systems were 
associated with high anxiety, especially the temperamental trait harm avoidance. More 
recent studies that investigated brain function and behavior found that pathways that process 
rewarding, or salient stimuli frequently showed either elevated or reduced brain response. 
Tying altered brain response to ED behavior or models that explain the etiology of EDs has 
been difficult as studies tend to be heterogeneous and results have often been inconsistent 
(2). Several advances, however, have been made recently in understanding brain function in 
EDs and the aim of this article is to review the past 18 months of published work in this field 
to provide an up to date insight.

The US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health database PubMed was 
searched separately for “anorexia nervosa”, “bulimia nervosa”, “binge eating disorder”, 
“avoidant restrictive food intake disorder”, “pica” and “rumination disorder”. The search 
terms “imaging”, “functional magnetic resonance imaging”, “fMRI”, “brain volume”, “brain 
structure”, “gray matter”, “white matter”, “cortical thickness”, “positron emission 
tomography” and “connectivity” were subsequently entered in the search engine together 
with eating disorder diagnostic terms, In addition, the search term imaging was entered 
together with the search terms reward, cognition, emotion, eating, behavior, binge-eating or 
purging, and subsequently together with one of the 6 diagnosis terms. Identified studies were 
screened and suitable manuscripts were downloaded. This search resulted in 80 articles on 
brain imaging across AN, BN or BED. No suitable articles for other feeding or eating 
disorders were identified. The most important articles are reviewed in this article.

Methods

Structural MRI Studies

Several advances in structural imaging in AN have emerged in the past year. Studies by King 
and Nickel, showed that state of illness, such as acute food restriction, is associated with 
lower brain volume but this can normalize within weeks after starting weight restoration (3, 
4). Accordingly, lower cortical folding (gyrification) normalized with weight restoration in 
AN as shown by Bernardoni (5). Furthermore, Olivo found in so-called atypical AN, food 
restriction and body image distortion but without the AN typical underweight, normal brain 
volumes compared to controls (6). Altogether those results suggest that underweight may be 
directly related to changes in brain volume. Research by Seitz, using an AN animal model 
for structural brain changes showed that loss of astrocytes, cells that provide structure and

support to neurons, may be responsible for the observed volume losses in AN (7). The 
mechanism how those cells quickly recover with weight gain remains unclear.

There continues to be high heterogeneity across studies though and this was reflected in 
recent studies on cortical thickness in AN. Lavagnino showed in AN higher cortical 
thickness in the right orbitofrontal cortex when ill and after recovery, and greater cortical 
thickness in bilateral insula after recovery (8). Those regions have been associated with 
higher drive for thinness and bulimia symptom levels previously (9). Castro-Fornieles 
however, showed lower cortical thickness in the post central gyrus in AN when ill and after 
recovery, suggesting that the field needs to come together and adhere to common methods to 
create more reliable results to be able to define pathophysiology (10, 11).

Studies on brain structure in BN, one by Westwater and the other by Berner, found that 
higher binge eating and purging frequency were associated with lower cortical thickness in 
frontal, parietal or cingulate cortices (12, 13). Those results highlighted that not only food 
restriction but also binge eating and purging may directly alter brain structure. Those effects 
are non-specific though with respect to affected region, and their impact on ED behavior is 
uncertain.

Another advancement have been studies by Lavagnino and Vaughn that used machine 
learning, a statistical method to identify patterns of regional brain volumes to distinguish 
control from ED groups (8, 14). While classification accuracy in those studies was only 
between 70 and 80% for diagnostic purposes, those studies allow generating hypothesis 
about brain regions and circuits, such as insula and frontal cortical regions to be involved in 
ED pathophysiology and define subgroups.

White Matter Tract Diffusion Imaging

White matter tracts link functionally connected brain regions and could contribute to 
pathological behavior, including food restriction or binge eating and purging via altered 
information processing. Past studies suggested reduced fractional anisotropy (water flow 
along the axon as a measure of white matter tract integrity) across many regions, which was 
thought to be a result from malnutrition, while elevated tract numbers after long term 
recovery could be a potential compensatory mechanism (15). Several white matter studies 
were conducted in AN in the past year. Phillipou and Hu found in independent studies lower 
white matter integrity in AN versus controls widespread across the brain (16, 17). However, 
those study have to be viewed with caution. A recent report by Kaufmann indicated that so-
called “free water” such as from enlarged ventricles or other cerebrospinal fluid spaces that 
are adjacent to white matter tracts could lead to artificially lower white matter integrity 
values (18). This may indicate that previous studies should be reanalyzed. Similarly, to brain 
volume studies, weight restoration and recovery from AN are associated with white matter 
integrity normalization. Atypical AN showed normal white matter integrity, highlighting the 
impact of food restriction and underweight on white matter integrity (19–21). No white 
matter diffusion studies have recently been published in BN or BED.

Brain Connectivity Studies

Several recent studies identified brain network organization differences between AN and 
control groups. Geisler found that individuals recovered from AN had more nodes 
(functionally relevant regions) compared to controls across the brain, which mirrored ill AN 
findings, suggesting that this pattern could be a trait marker (22). Haynos found reduced 
functional connectivity between reward processing and executive regions in AN, while Olivo 
reported a more mixed picture of reduced connectivity between basal ganglia, occipital 
cortex and cerebellum, but higher connectivity in temporo-parietal-occipital circuits (23, 24). 
Whether these are state factors due to malnutrition and whether these are relevant for illness 
progression and recovery remains to be further studied (25).

Rangaprakash presented fear inducing pictures and saw that the AN group lacked expected 
connections between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, connections that are important 
for emotion regulation (26). This result suggests a possibly underlying mechanism for the 
often exaggerated fear or anxiety response in AN that is poorly modulated by frontal cortical 
input.

Two studies investigated functional connectivity related to binge eating. Stopyra found that 
anterior cingulate (salience network, reward processing, emotional arousal), and medial 
frontal cortex (default mode network, monitoring of physical and emotional states) were less 
active in BN and BED groups compared to controls implicating reward and executive 
function circuits in those disorders and associated especially with food intake control and 
binge eating (27). Domakonda on the other hand found no altered network connectivity 
across controls and BN, suggesting that larger, more definitive studies are needed to resolve 
questions about network involvement in those EDs (28).

Task Based Functional Brain Imaging Studies

Executive function, emotion processing, body perception, and reward processing may be 
relevant for ED pathophysiology and brain circuits related to those behaviors could be part 
of specific pathophysiology that drives illness related behaviors.

Bernardoni applied a decision making task during brain imaging and while brain response 
did not differ between group, AN had elevated learning rate compared to controls; this 
highlighted that certain types of learning are well preserved if not better in AN (29). In a 
study by Neveu on food choice and decision making, individuals with BN and controls rated 
food items for tastiness and healthiness during brain scanning and then chose food items 
based on what they deemed more important, taste or health (30). Individuals with BN used 
food unhealthiness and tastiness to make food choices while healthy controls used only food 
tastiness, supporting the clinical observation that individuals with BN “allow” themselves 
unhealthy foods during binges. The BN group activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
more than controls during food choice based on health, suggesting stronger mental effort in 
BN. Cyr et al studied a conflict resolution paradigm (“Simon Task”) where participants ill 
with or recovered from BN and controls had to respond with button presses to visual stimuli 
that appeared variably on each side of a computer screen (31, 32). Brain activation patterns

could distinguish healthy controls from individuals with BN. Interestingly, individuals who 
had recovered from BN showed the highest activation compared to controls, which led to the 
hypothesis that high brain response might compensate for executive function deficits found 
previously in BN.

A study by Berner that induced negative emotions by breathing in and holding the breath, 
suggested a state of hyper-arousal in AN across cortical and subcortical regions in AN (33). 
McAdams found in a social interaction task that individuals ill with AN had a negative bias 
toward how they interacted with others and this externalizing bias correlated with insula and 
frontal cortical brain activity, implicating those areas in difficulties in social perception in 
AN (34).

Body image distortion in AN continues to be an enigma and there is ongoing debate whether 
this is a cognitive emotional problem or whether there are neuronal factors that interfere 
with body integration or perception (35). Burke found that when comparing one’s own body 
with that of another person, women activated stronger than men striatal, medial prefrontal 
and insula regions, suggesting a sex specific brain response that could be related to the 
higher prevalence of eating disorders in women compared to men (36). Furthermore, the 
insula integrates interoceptive stimuli and that study raises the question whether intense self-
perception in AN is mediated by insula hyper-sensitivity. In treatment, patients with AN 
have a low threshold for being triggered by other patients’ thin body shape, causing fear of 
being heavier and it is possible that insula over-activation mediates this behavior response. 
That study, however, is in contrast to Via’s report that showed a lack of response when 
comparing oneself with others in AN (37). In summary, the pathophysiology that underlies 
body image perception continues to be poorly understood and more effort needs to be made 
to better understand this key element of AN.

Several functional studies in the past year have applied reward paradigms. In a study that 
presented pictures of food during brain imaging, Boehm showed that adults with AN had 
higher brain response to subliminal food cues in visual areas (38). Horndasch found higher 
cerebellar activation to both high and low calorie food images versus controls in adult AN, 
but adolescents had a mixed pattern of higher response in mostly frontal and parietal regions. 
A study by Aviram-Friedman that focused on presenting high and low-calorie food images 
in binge eating disorder found elevation of brain response across multiple regions (39). How 
to interpret results from those studies that presented visual food cues and use clinically 
continues to be difficult, as studies vary greatly and the neurotransmitters involved are 
uncertain (40). One study though indicated that amphetamines may be able to normalize 
exaggerated brain response to food images in BED and reduce binge eating, further 
implicating the dopamine and noradrenaline system in binge eating pathophysiology (41). A 
very elegant task by Mueller that depleted catecholamines in the blood prior to a monetary 
reward earning task in BN and a control group, found that the dopamine related reward 
circuitry is desensitized in BN, consistent with earlier studies (42). Interestingly, in controls 
higher brain response was associated with higher monetary earnings, but this relationship 
was disrupted in the BN group, which suggested a disruption between neurotransmitter 
function and behavior.

Our lab published a multi-modal brain imaging study in adolescents with AN and controls, 
where the AN group showed hyper-activation in the caudate head, nucleus accumbens and 
insula compared to controls during a classical conditioning paradigm that has been 
associated with dopamine function. Orbitofrontal brain response in AN was positively 
related to the anxiety trait harm avoidance and striatal-hypothalamic connectivity, but 
negatively with change in body mass index during treatment (43). This suggested that altered 
reward brain response in adolescent AN may be due to disturbed dopamine function in 
response to food restriction, may have a key role in AN’s specific pathophysiology and 
should be explored as a target for biological treatments. There is also evidence for genetic 
underpinnings that alter reward prediction error response, which needs to be further explored 
(44). Based on those data we developed a model, where we propose that there is a conflict 
between the conscious motivation to restrict food, and a body-homeostasis driven motivation 
to approach food in response to weight loss. These opposing motivations trigger anxiety, 
which maintains the vicious cycle of ongoing energy restriction and weight loss (45). Such a 
top-down control over eating was supported by a study from Hildebrandt that showed 
elevated frontal control network response to food cues (46). Another study from our group 
analyzed brain response and value that individuals with EDs attribute to sweet taste (47). We 
found that in AN when ill, the expected value for receiving sucrose is strongly associated 
with anterior cingulate activation, which correlated negatively with body mass index (BMI, 
weight in kg / height m2) across groups. This suggests that excessive food intake and 
resulting BMI change brain circuitry and reduce value attribution to the stimulus. The notion 
that extremes of food intake alter brain function was also suggested in a study by Joutsa that 
found lower mu-opioid receptor availability in obese individuals with and without binge 
eating (48). Previous research has demonstrated that food intake can directly alter 
neurotransmitter receptor expression and those recent brain imaging data are further 
supporting that extremes of food intake have profound effects on brain function and stimulus 
processing (49).

Conclusion

Brain structure and function are altered in response to extremes of eating and this can be 
used clinically to motivate patients to cease those behaviors. White matter studies indicated 
altered axon integrity, but methods need to be developed further to control for potential 
confounds. Altered functional connectivity in AN between amygdala and frontal cortex 
could account for poor emotion regulation. The dopamine system associated reward 
prediction error brain response is elevated in AN compared to controls and relationships 
between prediction error, anxiety and hypothalamus connectivity suggest that this signal 
drives anxiety and food restriction. The dopamine system can me modulated 
pharmacologically (50), and could become a target for intervention.

Food restriction as well as binge eating and purging behaviors are associated 
with lower regional brain volumes or cortical thickness, but those changes 
largely return to normal with normalization of weight and eating behavior.

Computational modeling has started to identify patterns of structural and 
functional imaging data that classify eating disorder subtypes.

The prediction error model, a computational approach to assess dopamine 
related brain reward function, helped support a brain based model for 
anorexia nervosa. In that model, `the conscious motivation to restrict conflicts 
with body signals that stimulate eating, which causes anxiety and drives a 
vicious cycle of food restriction.
