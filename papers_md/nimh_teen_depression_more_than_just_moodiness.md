Being a teenager can be tough, but it shouldn’t feel hopeless. If you have been feeling sad most of the time for a few weeks or longer and you’re not able to concentrate or do the things you used to enjoy, talk to a trusted adult aboutdepression.


## Do I have depression?


- Do you often feel sad, anxious, worthless, or even “empty”?

- Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?

- Do you get easily frustrated, irritable, or angry?

- Do you find yourself withdrawing from friends and family?

- Are your grades dropping?

- Have your eating or sleeping habits changed?

- Have you experienced any fatigue or memory loss?

- Have you thought about suicide or harming yourself?

Depression looks different for everyone. You might have many of the symptoms listed above or just a few.


## How do I get help for depression?


- Talk to a trusted adult(such as your parent or guardian, teacher, or school counselor) about how you’ve been feeling.

- Ask your doctorabout options for professional help. Depression can be treated with psychotherapy (also called “talk therapy”), medication, or a combination of medication and talk therapy.

- Try to spend time with friends or family,even if you don’t feel like you want to.

- Stay active and exercise,even if it’s just going for a walk. Physical activity releases chemicals, such as endorphins, in your brain that can help you feel better.

- Try to keep a regular sleep schedule.

- Eat healthy foods.

You’re not alone, and help is available. You can feel better. To get help, call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat988or chat at988lifeline.org.
