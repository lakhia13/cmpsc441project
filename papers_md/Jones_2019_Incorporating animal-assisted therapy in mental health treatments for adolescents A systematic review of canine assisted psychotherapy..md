As interest in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) grows, there is increasing need to differ-
entiate informal activities from formal and professionally directed therapies, including mental
health focussed Canine-Assisted Psychotherapy (CAP). There have been no reviews focus-
ing exclusively on CAP and the distinct developmental period of adolescence. The aims of
this study were to identify the characteristics of CAP interventions, their impacts and their
acceptability, tolerability and feasibility for adolescents with mental health disorders.

Method

A systematic review identified studies incorporating canines into mental health treatments
for adolescents aged 10–19 years. Studies reporting qualitative or quantitative psychologi-
cal or psychosocial outcomes were included.

Seven studies were scrutinised. Intervention characteristics varied, including a range of for-
mats, settings, locations, doses, and facilitators. Information on the role of the canines in
sessions was sparse. CAP had a positive impact on primary diagnoses and symptomatol-
ogy, conferring additional benefits to standard treatments for internalising disorders, post-
traumatic stress disorder, and equivalent effects for anxiety, anger and externalising disor-
ders. CAP was associated with positive impacts on secondary factors including increased
engagement and socialisation behaviours, and reductions in disruptive behaviours within
treatment sessions. Global functioning also improved. There was insufficient evidence that
CAP improved factors associated with self-esteem, subjective wellbeing, or coping. Good
attendance and retention rates indicated high levels of acceptability. Moderate to high toler-
ability was also indicated. Feasibility may be limited by additional training and logistical
requirements.

Recommendations

We recommend the development of theoretically informed, standardised (manualised) inter-
vention protocols that may subsequently form the basis of efficacy and effectiveness testing.
Such protocols should clearly describe canine-participant-facilitator interactions via a for-
malised nomenclature; spontaneous (animal-led), adjunctive (facilitator-led), and experien-
tial (participant-led).

Conclusions

There is emerging evidence to suggest that CAP improves the efficacy of mental health
treatments in self-selected adolescent populations via reductions in primary symptomatol-
ogy, and via secondary factors that improve therapeutic processes and quality, such as
engagement and retention.

Introduction
Defining animal-assisted interventions

The incorporation of animals into human treatments has a long history. As the field has
evolved, much work has been done to both define and describe the nature and types of these
interventions, and to explore their efficacy (the ability to produce the desired or intended
result within a controlled research context) and effectiveness (how the treatment works in
real-life practice) [1, 2]. Some of the earliest attempts to define formal and informal interven-
tions that incorporate animals were made in the 1980s and 1990s by the Delta Society (now
Pet Partners) USA. These definitions are possibly the most widely cited, differentiating struc-
tured therapies referred to as animal-assisted therapy (AAT) from informal interventions
called animal-assisted activities (AAA) [3].

Given the crucial importance of clear definitions to establishing efficacy, considerable work

has been done by researchers and international bodies to highlight the need for common ter-
minology [4–6]. A number of key points appear consistent in the existing literature and will be
accepted as definitions for the purposes of this paper. First, animal-assisted interventions
(AAI) is the umbrella term that refers to the deliberate and meaningful inclusion of animals
into human health, wellbeing, or educational interventions. Second, AAAs are less-formal
interventions that aim to improve human wellbeing but are not necessarily individualised or
documented. Goals may be general and applied to a wide range of target groups equally. Those
delivering the intervention need not be licensed professionals but are still trained and/or certi-
fied to work safely together with the animal. Third, AAT is a goal-directed and individualised
treatment that is measured and documented. AAT is delivered or directed by a qualified or
licensed health/human-service professional, within the scope of their professional practice.
The human and the animal are trained and/or certified to work safely together to deliver the
interventions. The professional may be the animal handler (triangle model) or there may be a
professional plus an animal and handler team (diamond model).

This review is particularly focused on mental health specific interventions that focus on psy-
chological and psychosocial outcomes. These are sub-sets within AAT, including, for example
AAT in counselling (AAT-C) [7] animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP) [8] and animal-assis-
ted play therapy (AAPT) [9]. These interventions include human-animal interaction in addi-
tion to, or combination with, a recognised and professional form of mental health therapy.
The unique relationships formed between humans and animals are seen as key agents of

change and are respected in a similar way to the therapist-client relationship. For the purposes
of this paper, AAP refers to a sub-set of AAT, focussed on mental health outcomes, and utilis-
ing psychotherapeutic techniques or theories. Canine-assisted psychotherapy (CAP) refers to
AAP interventions assisted by the intentional and meaningful inclusion of canines.

Impact of AAI’s on psychological and psychosocial variables

A number of literature reviews have been conducted to explore the efficacy of AAI’s on psycho-
logical and psychosocial variables. Eight systematic reviews have indicated that multi-species
AAIs may be effective as an adjunctive treatment for human health and wellbeing [10–17].
Across all of the studies reviewed, the most commonly employed animals were canines and
equines. Of the seven reviews that explored psychological variables, all concluded that AAI may
be beneficial in reducing psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, trauma symp-
toms, mental illness or addiction [10–16]. Three reviews examined psychosocial variables, all of
which concluded that AAI may improve behaviour, communication or social skills, especially
in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) [12, 15, 17]. In all cases, these findings are to be inter-
preted conservatively given the variability and poor methodological quality of the literature.

Although a there are a number of reviews that have focused specifically on equine-assisted
interventions [18–23], no such reviews exist for canines. This adds to the difficulties assessing
the impact of canine-assisted interventions. Similarly, whilst there have been reviews of the
impact of AAI’s on children and young people [15, 20, 22, 24, 25], most reviews have examined
AAIs across the lifespan [10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 26, 27]. We could find no reviews focused
on the distinct developmental period of adolescence (10–19 years) [28].

AAI versus AAT/P

Whilst the aforementioned reviews all examined psychological and or psychosocial variables,
only one focused specifically on AAT, exploring the impact of AAP on trauma-related symp-
toms across the lifespan [14]. In the majority of reviews, the authors failed to delineate simple
animal-presence, from therapeutic mental health treatments that incorporated animals. With-
out these clear distinctions, it is virtually impossible to establish an evidence-base for the differ-
ent types of AAI’s [6, 29]. In all but Germain, Wilkie [14] review, the authors compared very
brief unstructured interactions, often facilitated by a volunteer handler, with comprehensive
therapies, such as group counselling facilitated by a trained therapist and animal, in order to
draw conclusions about how effective AAT is in treating certain mental health (or other) con-
ditions. Kamioka, Okada [10] defined AAT so broadly as to compare brief unstructured inter-
actions, structured dairy-farm work, goal-focused therapeutic interventions, living with a
companion bird and living with a service canine. Hoagwood, Acri [15] stated their definition
was AAT, but the literature-review also included unstructured, volunteer-based interactions
rather than therapy “directed by health and human service providers as part of their profession”
[30] and “within the scope of the professionals’ practice” [5]. Specifically, there were no psycho-
therapeutic techniques or theories incorporated into the therapy. None of these reviews were
species-specific, including a broad range of animals such as equines, canines, felines (cats),
farm animals and birds. Consequently, there is no literature synthesis and hence no current
consensus on the efficacy or effectiveness of canine inclusion in mental health treatments or
psychotherapy.

The inclusion of canines in psychotherapy (CAP)

Individual studies exploring the impact of adding a canine to psychotherapy, show that psy-
chological and psychosocial variables may be improved over and above psychotherapy without

a canine (treatment as usual) for a range of populations. Children and young people with ASD
in residential care had significantly fewer interpersonal and functional problems [31] and chil-
dren with ADHD participating in counselling displayed reduced symptomatology [32]. Chil-
dren participating in a trauma treatment group showed significant reductions in PTSD
symptoms of intrusion, arousal, avoidance and dissociation [33]. Adults participating in a
trauma treatment analogue experienced significant reductions in distress and depressive
symptoms [34]. Adult inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia had reduced anhedonia [35]
and other negative symptoms [36]. Adults hospitalised for substance dependence demon-
strated increased therapeutic alliance [37] and interpersonal socialisation [38]. Women with
breast cancer attending counselling reported positive anticipation towards sessions, and thera-
peutic benefits such as reduced distress, and the promotion of feelings of peace and calm [39].
A number of these studies reported that the presence of canines had a direct impact on the
primary diagnoses and clinical symptomatology of the participants [31–36]. These were factors
that were specifically targeted by the intervention. Other studies reported that the presence of
canines improved secondary factors, including therapeutic processes, or outcomes that were of
benefit to participant wellbeing, but were not necessarily the primary focus of the intervention.
Significant improvements have been seen with therapeutic alliance [37] engagement [39],
interpersonal socialisation or trust [38], acute anxious arousal (distress) [34, 39], and function-
ing [31].

In each of the studies cited above there was some variation in how canines were integrated
into the therapeutic process from structured activities [31, 32, 35, 36], to natural and spontane-
ous responses to the mood or behaviour of the participants [34, 37, 39]. Few studies explored
the nature of the canine’s engagement, temperament or behaviour on clinical outcomes. In
contrast, two studies [40, 41] indicated that this may be a crucial component of the treatment
process. Firstly, a structured psychotherapy and psychoeducation group that included a calm
and gentle Collie was not as effective at reducing depression in adult college students as a
‘non-directive’ group without psychotherapy, that focussed on the behaviour of an engaging,
energetic and ‘puppy-like’ Collie [40]. Secondly, in trauma treatment groups for children and
young people aged 7–17 years who had experienced sexual abuse [41], the inclusion of 15 min-
utes of unstructured canine contact at the beginning of sessions (preceded by 30 minutes in
the waiting room) resulted in significant reductions in trauma symptoms. In phase two, the
therapists noted that it was difficult to transition from the canine visit to the group therapy
content. Consequently, therapeutic stories were developed to both integrate the presence of
the canine, and aid with the transition to group therapy once the canine left the session. This
resulted in further significant improvements to trauma symptoms over and above the groups
with canines but no stories, and over treatment as usual (without canines) [41]. This finding is
consistent with previous reports that the meaningful inclusion of a canine via storytelling is an
effective tool for children who have experienced sexual abuse [42, 43]. Taken together, these
studies highlight the need to explore the role of canines within the treatment process, and to
establish how meaningful the role of the canine is to the participants.

AAI for adolescents

There is some evidence to suggest that AAT, and in particular CAP, is an effective intervention
for child and adolescent populations with neurodevelopmental difficulties [31, 32] and trauma
symptoms [33, 41]. Adolescence, however, is a distinct developmental period for a number of
reasons, including reorganisation of regulatory systems in the brain [44], increasing impor-
tance of the peer-group and appropriate social experiences [45], increasing emotional and cog-
nitive demands, sexual and identity development and individuation [46]. Importantly, many

mental health disorders have their origin in childhood and adolescence [47], and mental health
difficulties during adolescence can severely impact educational and social functioning, causing
severe distress [48]. Indeed, the negative sequelae of mental health problems have been identi-
fied as the leading contributor to the burden of disease among young Australians [49]. Despite
this, young people have historically been a difficult population group to engage. Reports on the
nature of youth mental illness consistently state that adolescents are concerned about the
stigma associated with mental illness, and express concerns about ‘talking with strangers’
which may negatively impact seeking professional help [48, 50].

There is a need to make interventions for this age group engaging in order to overcome the
possible stigma associated with help seeking; mental health interventions and services need to
be ‘youth friendly’ and ‘appealing’ [50]. AAIs have been repeatedly shown to be an effective
tool to assist with engagement and rapport building [9, 37, 51, 52]. Animal presence makes
strangers and therapists seem more trustworthy and makes people feel more safe and comfort-
able disclosing [53–55]. These findings provide some support for anecdotal claims that AAIs
are both acceptable and well tolerated by adolescents (e.g. [56]). Despite this, acceptability and
tolerability have rarely been directly assessed in the literature [57, 58].

It is therefore important to understand how acceptable adolescents find mental health inter-
ventions that incorporate canines. Acceptability refers to a person’s experience of the interven-
tion, and can be assessed by gathering drop-out or cessation data [59] in combination with
qualitative sampling [60]. Willingness to enrol and participate can also be interpreted as mea-
sures of perceived acceptability [58]. Tolerability is frequently used in the context of health
risk-management (e.g., how well is a medication tolerated) and refers broadly to adverse or
unintended consequences arising from the intervention, versus intended outcomes [61].
Whilst adverse or unintended consequences have been described in some AAI studies, there is
a general lack of information about tolerability [57]. Working with animals also raises ques-
tions of feasibility. In a clinical context, feasibility refers to the extent to which an activity is
“physically, culturally or financially practical or possible within a given context” [62]. There are
also additional logistical, financial and training requirements for both the humans and animals
in AAI, prompting calls for greater reporting of constraints such as external limitations in AAI
research [63].

Objectives and research questions

The overall purpose of this systematic review was to explore the impact of CAP for young peo-
ple in the distinct developmental period of adolescence, as defined by the WHO [28], aged 10
to 19 years. The aims of the study were threefold, to identify: (i) the characteristics of the inter-
ventions (description of the intervention including; activities, underlying psychological theo-
ries, the role of the canine(s) in treatment, and the role of the facilitator(s) in treatment; and
replicability); (ii) the impacts of CAP for adolescents with mental health disorders on primary
(clinical diagnosis and symptomatology) and secondary factors (factors of benefit to partici-
pant wellbeing or the therapeutic process); and (iii) the evidence with regard to the acceptabil-
ity, tolerability and feasibility of CAP for adolescents with mental health disorders.

Methods
Study design

A comprehensive database search was conducted to identify goal-focused CAP aimed at
improving mental health outcomes for adolescents 10–19 years, and in accordance with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [64] (S1 Fig).

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

Eligibility criteria. Studies were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they met the fol-

lowing criteria:

• Treatment-based (goal-focussed) interventions, utilising psychotherapeutic techniques or

theories, facilitated by, or under the direct guidance of, mental health professionals;

• Including canines (irrespective of the nature of the interactions), but no other species; and

• Literature published in peer reviewed publications, written or translated into English and

reporting qualitative or quantitative results to mental-health outcomes.

Search strategy

The search protocol was designed to be inclusive and broad in order to capture the vast array
of terminology utilised in the field. Previous systematic reviews of AAT were consulted as a
guide [10, 15, 26]. A search strategy was developed in consultation with a specialist research
librarian. Search terms were identified as outlined below. Where discrepancies occurred, all
authors were consulted until consensus was reached. Given the poor methodological quality of
existing studies in the field, only those studies which had undergone peer review and publica-
tion were accepted.

Databases. The following databases were searched: PsycINFO; PubMED; Scopus; and
MEDLINE. No date range was stipulated. The following search terms were utilised in the Psy-
cINFO search, and all other databases followed an equivalent search protocol utilising the
same terms (S1 Table).

Reference searching. The reference sections of included papers were hand searched by
the lead researcher (MJ) for additional studies missed by the database searches. Relevant titles
were identified and cross-checked for duplication. Remaining titles were searched, and
abstracts reviewed in line with the search strategy. Studies identified for full-text review were
downloaded.

Data extraction

For each identified study, a range of data were extracted including: study characteristics and
design; participant, facilitator and animal characteristics; intervention characteristics; and out-
comes and conclusions.

Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the National Institute of Health
(NIH) guidelines for quantitative studies [65, 66] and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210761 January 17, 2019

(CASP) for qualitative research [67, 68]. Each study was rated ‘good’, ‘fair’ or ‘poor’ for meth-
odological quality. Studies were further ranked in accordance with Australia’s National Health
and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Evidence Hierarchy for Interventions [69, 70]. This
tool ranks intervention studies according to the quality of their research design to manage bias
and confounders, and the degree of confidence that can be attributed to the resulting conclu-
sions (see Table 1).

A description of the participants was extracted, including age and sex. Diagnoses or difficul-

ties were reported if identified by the authors (e.g., depression, anger). Facilitators were
accepted as mental health professionals if they could be identified either by qualification, job
title or job role. Descriptions of canines were extracted, including information about their
training, certification or evaluation.

Details about the intervention, such as program outlines or session activities, were reported

as a measure of standardisation or replicability. The nature of engagement between partici-
pants and canines was retrieved and coded as structured (facilitator-directed) interactions,
semi-structured interactions, and/or spontaneous interactions. The format of interventions
was coded as group or individual. The setting of the intervention refers to the location in
which the intervention occurred, including information about indoors versus outdoors where
available. The dose for each intervention included frequency (e.g., weekly) and total hours, cal-
culated by adding the duration of each session (e.g., 60 minutes), and the length of the inter-
vention (e.g., 12 sessions).

Outcomes and conclusions were extracted, including information about the type of assess-
ments used and a summary of the results. Information about the acceptability, tolerability and
feasibility were extracted. Limitations, future directions and conclusions drawn by the authors
were all documented.

Results

A total of 3985 studies were identified for initial screening via database searching. After exclu-
sions (see Fig 1), 88 studies were selected for full-text screening, including 3 studies identified
via hand searching of reference lists. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included
in the final analysis. These seven studies examine a range of presenting issues, including
mood, anxiety, trauma, anger and disruptive behaviour, self-concept, adaptive functioning
and global functioning, and clinical severity of serious psychiatric illness. A range of assess-
ment tools were used by the authors, including therapist report, youth self-report, observation
and qualitative thematic analyses. Given the heterogeneity of the methodologies, assessment
tools and presenting issues, meta-analysis was not feasible.

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

Studies identified

All seven of the studies were published in the last 17 years, with four published in the last 5
years. Three of the studies were conducted in the USA, two in Italy, one in South Africa, and
one Israel. All studies had the stated goal of reducing the impact of psychological distress or
disorder, and/or to improve the adaptive functioning of the client (see Table 2).

Study design and methodological quality

A range of methodological designs were reported, including three randomised controlled trials
(RCT), one case-controlled study, one pre-post design and two qualitative studies. Only two
studies had ‘good’ methodological quality, both were RCTs [71, 72]. In both studies, com-
puter-generated randomisation was employed, and equivalence of experimental and control
groups was reported. Stefanini, Martino [71] reported blinding of assessors and use of inde-
pendent observational measures. Stefanini, Martino [72] utilised a mix of self-report, staff-
report and independent observation measures. In both cases, the authors reported a primary
focus on methodological rigour.

Three of the studies [56, 73, 74] were ranked as ‘fair’ for methodological quality, indicating

the possibility of bias. Hartwig [73] reported randomisation, however, the process was not
described. Pre-intervention data was not reported, making comparison between groups diffi-
cult, and only self-report outcome measures were used. Hamama, Hamama-Raz [74] reported
the possibility of bias in the participant selection process, acknowledging they were selectively
identified by the school counsellor. Subjective self-report tools were used alongside the

validated tools, reducing the overall confidence in the conclusions obtained. Lubbe and Scholtz
[56] reported on a single case-study, using qualitative methodologies integrating information
from multiple sources over the duration of treatment, plus at follow up 18 months later. The
authors directly attributed a number of results to the presence of the canine, despite an
acknowledgment that confounding factors were not explored (e.g., the role of the therapy, rela-
tionship with the facilitator, outside relationships and age/development).

Two of the studies were ranked as ‘poor’ for methodological quality [75, 76]. Lange, Cox [75]

acknowledged that their sample size was too small to draw any conclusions from the data. The
process for recruiting and selecting participants was not reported, nor the reason for 2 of the 5
participants withdrawing from the study (i.e., being ‘unavailable’ for the follow up interview). It
was also unclear if the facilitator conducted the qualitative interview, which has the potential for
bias. Hanselman [76] report of treatment goals within the paper was very detailed; but there
were insufficient details on participant eligibility, screening, and statistical analyses to assess the
outcomes reported. There was also heavy reliance on subjective (non-validated) self-report mea-
sures, and informal facilitator observations, in many of the author’s conclusions.

Participant, facilitator & canine characteristics

Four studies reported interventions for participants aged 13–16 years, whilst three studies
involved participants from the wider developmental period 10–18 years or 11–17 years (see

counselling for emotional issues [56, 73]; or adolescents admitted to hospital with severe psy-
chiatric illness [71, 72]. Diagnostic information at intake was provided only by Stefanini, Mar-
tino [71] and Stefanini, Martino [72], and the cohort for each study was independent.

Facilitators were reported to be qualified or student counsellors [73, 75, 76], social workers

[74], psychologists [72], or psychiatric hospital staff [71]. All but two of the studies reported
that facilitators were explicitly trained or supervised in AAT [56, 76]. Two studies also reported
employing animal-handlers [71, 72].

Four of the studies included information about the selection, assessment or certification sta-

tus of the canines employed [71–73, 75]. None reported details about the canine’s breed/type
or size, although Hartwig [73] did indicate that the canine’s temperament or behaviour may
impact outcomes. Lubbe and Scholtz [56] included photos in the paper, showing a small
canine similar in appearance to a Yorkshire Terrier. Hanselman [76] reported employing two
canines but provided no other information. The number of canines employed in the interven-
tions was not reported by Hamama, Hamama-Raz [74] or Hartwig [73]. Stefanini, Martino
[71] and Stefanini, Martino [72] reported that five canines and their handlers were employed.

Intervention characteristics

A broad range of interventions were employed in the reviewed studies, including individual
counselling, group counselling, and combined interventions in a variety of settings such as a
school, hospitals and community settings (see Table 4).

One intervention was reportedly standardised; the HART model developed by Hartwig

[73]. This was a 10-week (8.3 total hours) intervention based on the concepts of solution
focused and play therapies, and utilising creative and expressive techniques delivered during
individual counselling sessions. The control group engaged in the standard HART curriculum,
whilst the intervention group engaged in a HART plus AAT curriculum, where session activi-
ties were modified to incorporate a canine. Examples of session activities were provided, and
the participant-canine interactions appeared to be structured (facilitator-directed). There were
multiple facilitators (trained counsellors) and canines employed during the intervention, with
AAT facilitators working with their own certified therapy canines. Lubbe and Scholtz [56]
reported a single case study; an individual counselling intervention, facilitated by a counsellor
and her own canine. The intervention was not standardised, but was delivered in a responsive
way to the participant’s presenting issues and treatment goals. Interactions with the canine
contained a mix of structured (facilitator-led), semi-structured and spontaneous interactions.
The dosage of the intervention was not described. Follow-up interviewing was conducted with
the participant 18 months post-treatment. Both individual counselling interventions [56, 73]
were delivered indoors, in typical counselling rooms.

The interventions delivered by Stefanini and colleagues [71, 72] consisted of individual ses-

sions (including matching participants with the canines) followed by group sessions over a
period of 3 months (9 total hours) at a psychiatric hospital. There was no reported overlap in
participants between the two studies. Interventions were conducted weekly, in addition to hos-
pital treatment as usual (TAU). Activities were tailored to the participants’ own treatment
goals, including structured (facilitator-led) and semi-structured canine interactions conducted
outside in the hospital garden, except when the weather was inclement. The comparison
groups received hospital TAU without the AAT intervention.

The remaining three studies reported group interventions [74–76]. Both Hamama,

Hamama-Raz [74] and Lange, Cox [75] reported goal-focused activities set out by the facilita-
tors. Hamama, Hamama-Raz [74] provided a programme overview with session examples,
indicating a structured and pre-determined intervention. This was the most intensive

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

intervention reviewed, with a total of 36 hours provided over 12 weeks. Canines were matched
to each participant. Activities were largely structured and semi-structured, conducted in a local
park close to the school. The comparison group engaged in equivalent or similar activities, not
including canines, based within the school classroom. The facilitators, two social work students,
ran both groups. In comparison, the intervention delivered by Lange, Cox [75] was developed
in response to the participants’ goals. The facilitator, a counsellor, developed goal-focused activ-
ities after feedback from the participants about their ideas. No session details were made avail-
able, but qualitative analysis indicated both structured and spontaneous interactions.

Unlike the other studies, Hanselman [76] reported that two canines were present only for
certain periods during the intervention, in particular during group discussions. The interven-
tion was based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with adaptations
based on attachment theory, and comprised 10 sessions facilitated by two counsellors. It was
unclear how many sessions or for what duration the canines were present. Informal observa-
tions made by the facilitators indicated largely spontaneous interactions.

Psychological & psychosocial outcomes

A summary of outcomes reported by each of the authors is outlined in Table 5. The results are
categorised by area of intervention focus below.

Psychological variables: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Hamama, Hamama-
Raz [74] reported a significant decline in PTSD symptoms (p = .018) and a significant reduc-
tion in the risk for a PTSD diagnosis (p = .046) on the self-report measure PTSD Checklist–
Civilian (PCL-C) from pre to post-intervention. At Pre-test the intervention group scored sig-
nificantly higher on the PCL-C than the comparison group who had no exposure to traumatic
events (p = .014); this difference was not present by the end of the intervention (p = .409).
Psychological variables: Depression, anxiety and internalising problems. Hamama,
Hamama-Raz [74] assessed depression via the short Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion Scale (CESD). The intervention group (with trauma history) showed no significant reduc-
tion in depression pre- to post-intervention (p = .063). The intervention group had
significantly higher rates of depression than the comparison group (without trauma history)
pre-intervention (p = .022) which was not evident post-intervention (p = 0.316). Hartwig [73]
assessed depression and anxiety using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI) respectively. Paired comparisons indicated a significant reduction in both
depression and anxiety from pre- to post-test for both the intervention group (HART curricu-
lum + AAT), and the comparison group (HART curriculum without AAT) (p’s < .05). There
was no difference between the intervention group (i.e., AAT) and the comparison group on
either measure.

Hanselman [76] assessed depression with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Mean
scores for depression increased significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention, with
results remaining in the ‘moderate’ range. Various subjective mood states were assessed via
mood thermometers for tension, confusion, fatigue and depression at the beginning and end
of sessions. In contradiction to the BDI-II scores, the author reported that the mood thermom-
eters indicated an improvement in subjective mood state over the course of the intervention.
Statistical analyses were not reported making interpretation of these results difficult.

Internalising symptoms were measured by Stefanini, Martino [72] on the Youth Self Report
(YSR). There was a significant decrease in symptoms for the intervention group (TAU + AAT)
but not the control group from pre- to post-test (p < .05). The intervention group also scored
significantly better when compared to the control group (TAU) on rate of change for internal-
ising symptoms (p = .02).

Psychological variables: Anger and externalising problems. Disruptive behaviour and
anger were assessed by Hartwig [73] using the Beck Disruptive Behaviour Inventory (BDBI)
and Beck Anger Inventory (BANI). There were 15 children in the HART+AAT and 14 chil-
dren in the HART only group. Although all children showed significant reductions in disrup-
tive behaviour, the difference between the two groups in rate of change was not significant. In
terms of anger, no significant differences were seen over time and between groups.

Hanselman [76] measured anger on the State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS-TAS) and by a sub-
jective mood thermometer. The author reported a significant decrease in the mean state anger
(STAS) and trait anger (TAS) from pre to post intervention and an increase in the mean rating
for subjective anger for beginning to end of sessions. Statistical analyses were not reported.

Stefanini, Martino [72] assessed externalising symptoms via the Youth Self-Report (YSR).

There was no significant difference between the control group (TAU) and the intervention
group (TAU + AAT) with regard to rate of change to externalising symptoms.

Psychological variables: Adaptive functioning, wellbeing, coping & self-concept. Sub-

jective wellbeing and coping was assessed by Hamama, Hamama-Raz [74] by asking “All
things considered, how satisfied are you with your life these days?” and by asking the partici-
pant to rate her perceived coping with stressful or extreme events. Responses were rated on a
4-point Likert scale. No significant change was reported pre- to post-intervention (p = .447,
and p = .594 respectively). Relative to the comparison group (without trauma history), the
intervention group had a lower level of subjective wellbeing pre-intervention (p = .041) that
was not present post-intervention (p = .116). Hartwig [73] assessed self-concept with the Beck

Self-Concept Inventory (BSCI). There were no significant differences pre to post-test for either
the intervention group (HART + AAT) or the comparison group (HART).

Stefanini, Martino [71] explored the adaptive functioning of participants via a number of
staff-reported (not facilitators) measures including; The Children’s Global Assessment Scale (C-
GAS), format of hospital care (indicating the clinical severity of the patient on a 3-point scale),
and ordinary school attendance (capacity for school attendance from 1, hospital school only, to
3, regular attendance at ordinary school). The intervention group (TAU + AAT) made signifi-
cant improvements over and above the control group (TAU) in global functioning (p < .001),
format of hospital care (p = .020) and ordinary school attendance (p < .030). Similar results
were found by Stefanini, Martino [72]; there was a significant improvement to global function-
ing on the C-GAS from pre- to post-intervention (p < .001) and a significant improvement
when compared to the control group (rate of change) (p < .001). The intervention group had
significantly greater improvement on the total competence scale of the YSR (p = .001).

Psychosocial variables: Engagement, socialisation & connection. Thematic analysis
conducted by Lubbe and Scholtz [56] of documents from the therapeutic case file (including a
book made by the participant that contained letters, drawings, paintings and photos) and fol-
low-up interview, identified five themes arising from the presence of the therapy canine: facili-
tating relationship building; enabling communication by working indirectly; experiencing
physical affection through the therapy canine; socialisation skills; and enhanced self-esteem.
Lange, Cox [75] similarly used qualitative methodology (semi-structured interview). There
was too little data to conduct thematic analysis, but common topics identified were that canine
presence was beneficial for: humour; calming; attendance; disclosure; self-soothing; and feel-
ing attached.

Hanselman [76] reports informal, in-session observations made by the facilitators, indicat-
ing that positive behaviour increased when the canines were present. The author also reports
an increase in the mean score on the Companion Animal Bonding Scale (CABS) pre-session
to post-session, although statistical data is unavailable. Behavioural coding of videotaped ses-
sions conducted by Stefanini, Martino [71] indicate significant increases in observed participa-
tion (p < .001), interaction (p < .001) and affection (p < .001) towards the canine,
socialisation with adults (p < .001) and peers (p < .001), and reduced withdrawal (p < .04).
Similar findings were reported by Stefanini, Martino [72]; significant increases in motivation
(p < .001), relationships (p < .05), socialisation (p < .01) and affect (p < .001).

Acceptability and dropout, tolerability, and feasibility

Limited information about acceptability, tolerability or feasibility is provided in the studies.
With regard to acceptability (i.e., attendance and attrition), no drop-outs are evident or
reported for four of the studies [56, 73, 74, 76]. Stefanini, Martino [71] and Stefanini, Martino
[72] report 100% attendance rates to sessions for the intervention group, whereas Lange, Cox
[75] reports that two of five participants were ‘unavailable’ for follow-up interview with no
cause provided. Another potential measure of acceptability is enrolment rates. This can be esti-
mated by calculating the number of eligible participants against the number of actual partici-
pants. The number of eligible participants is reported only by Hamama, Hamama-Raz [74],
with nine girls consenting to participate in the intervention group out of a possible 20. It is not
clear from the data if the majority of participants declined to participate due to concerns about
acceptability, or other intervening factors, such as scheduling.

Tolerability (i.e., intended versus unexpected or unintended consequences) is not directly
reported in four of the studies [71, 72, 74, 75]. An increase in depression was reported by Han-
selman [76], attributed to increased emotional awareness and reduced substance use. Lubbe

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

and Scholtz [56] imply that tolerability is high as the participant achieves positive outcomes in
the AAT intervention where previous interventions were unsuccessful.

Lange, Cox [75], Lubbe and Scholtz [56] and Hartwig [73] reported on limitations to feasi-
bility, stating that access to appropriately trained animals and handlers must be considered in
addition to facilitator training and supervision. Assessment of the canine and liability issues
must also be addressed [75]. Hartwig [73] further states that there were some difficulties adapt-
ing the HART curriculum to include the canines.

Discussion

This review was the first attempt to synthesise the CAP literature, using clear definitions to
delineate goal-focussed mental health treatments from informal activities that did not contain
any psychotherapeutic theories or techniques. This review was also the first systematic review
of AAT for participants in the distinct developmental period of adolescence. The characteris-
tics of CAP interventions were explored, including the nature of interactions between partici-
pants, facilitators and canines in an attempt to determine the specific components of
importance. The impact of CAP on primary mental health symptomatology was reviewed and
distinguished from secondary factors associated with improved therapeutic processes and par-
ticipant wellbeing. This resulted in a more comprehensive exploration than previous reviews
on AAIs. Acceptability, tolerability and feasibility were also examined. These factors have not
successfully been explored previously in the CAP literature.

Intervention characteristics

Limited detail about interventions was provided in the studies reviewed. Based on the information
presented, replicability of the reviewed studies is not possible. Although some authors included
brief program outlines, only one intervention was reported to be standardised [73]. No authors
discussed the temperament or behaviour of the canine or canines employed in the intervention.
Given previous findings indicating that spontaneous engagement with a boisterous and puppy-
like Collie was more effective at reducing depression than facilitator-led and structured interaction
with a quiet Collie [40], further exploration of canine temperament and behaviour, is needed.

Hartwig [73] discussed the difficulties of adapting existing curriculum to include canines,
reflecting that active and experiential activities may have been more therapeutic. Such experi-
ential interactions are well documented in models of equine-assisted interventions [77–82],
but are not evident in canine-assisted interventions. It will be important for future reviews to
explore the differences between heavily structured, facilitator-led interventions and those that
allow for spontaneous and participant-led interactions before conclusions can be drawn about
the efficacy of various models of engagement.

Three studies indicated that the participant-canine interactions were the central tenet of the
therapy, that is, all of the therapeutic content was centred around canine-related activities [71,
72, 74], whereas in others the canine was present only for portions of the therapy [76]. This is
important to explore further, as meaningful integration of canines into the therapeutic process
has been shown to increase efficacy [41].

Integration between theories of human-animal engagement and those for psychological
treatment were poorly reported. Only two studies included information about existing psycho-
logical theories or techniques that informed the nature of the intervention, such as play ther-
apy, attachment theory, solution-focused therapy and CBT [73, 76]. The remaining
interventions were informed by research indicating that the presence of a friendly animal can
facilitate engagement or rapport, reduce arousal or anger, and increase socialisation, all of
which may be beneficial to the treatment process.

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

Various intervention formats were utilised, including individual counselling, group coun-

selling, and combinations thereof. Dosages spanned 8.3 total hours [73] to 36 total hours of
treatment [74]. A range of settings were reported, including inpatient and community, out-
door and indoor. Whilst previous reviewers have noted that format (group), dose, or location
(indoors/outdoors) may impact outcomes [11, 14], this review is inconclusive. There is also
evidence to suggest that simply being in nature and outdoors environments can improve men-
tal health [83, 84]. To date the impact of nature (being outdoors) has not been separated from
the impact of animal species [14, 85].

Impact of CAP on primary diagnosis and clinical symptoms

There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the inclusion of canines in mental health treat-
ments for adolescents may confer additional benefits to primary clinical symptomatology, that
is, to the symptom or condition that is the primary target of the intervention. The impacts,
however, were not universal. The two studies that used an RCT design provided promising
results, indicating a reduction in clinical symptoms over and above treatment as usual for
global functioning and internalising (emotional) problems [71, 72]. Externalising (beha-
vioural) problems improved but not significantly more than the control group [72].

Studies conducted with lower levels of methodological rigour reported mixed findings,
indicating that CAP may have been helpful in reducing some symptoms over and above treat-
ment as usual, namely PTSD symptoms [74], but not others, including depression, anxiety and
disruptive behaviour over the standard treatment without the canines [73, 74]. One further
study reported on clinical symptoms [76], but the study was of such poor quality, that any con-
clusions must be treated conservatively and with caution. The intervention, an anger manage-
ment group, was associated with reductions in emotional and behavioural anger. The author
also reported an increase in depression that was attributed to greater emotional awareness and
reduced substance use [76].

There is no evidence to suggest that the inclusion of canines in adolescent mental health treat-
ments will increase the impact on clinical symptoms that are not the subject or focus of the ther-
apy. For example, Hartwig [73] reports no improvements to anger; however, anger was not a
treatment goal for any of the study participants. There is a general perception in the media and
the community that visitation with a canine can improve the symptoms of mental illness without
the inclusion of targeted therapy [6]. This perception is not supported by the current review.

Impact of CAP on secondary factors, including therapeutic processes &
participant wellbeing

Participant feedback, formal and informal observations indicate that CAP has positive impacts
on engagement and socialisation behaviours, even when these have not been the primary focus
of the intervention. Positive, pro-social engagements such as talking and showing affection
were reported by a number of the authors [56, 71, 72, 75, 76] and are consistent with the exist-
ing literature [38, 39]. These are factors that may have an important impact on the process
(and hence outcome) of therapy, such as developing collaborative relationships [52], or main-
taining a strong therapeutic alliance [86]. Qualitative reports also indicate a reduction in nega-
tive and disruptive behaviours displayed during interventions [75, 76].

These findings may be a product of the canine’s ability to increase calm, self-soothing and

feelings of attachment [38, 39, 56, 75, 76, 87], and provide further support for the oxytocin
hypothesis, which proposes that in the presence of a friendly animal, humans produce the
attachment promoting and anxiolytic hormone oxytocin, resulting in increased pro-social and
decreased anti-social interactions [53, 88].

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

There is insufficient evidence from this review to conclude that CAP will improve factors
associated with participant wellbeing; such as self-concept, self-esteem, coping or subjective
wellbeing [73, 74], with only one case study finding self-reported improvements to self-esteem
[56]. This finding is despite a general perception that working with canines can increase self-
efficacy or mastery [56, 74]. There is, however, evidence to support the finding that CAP may
improve global functioning over and above typical treatments [71, 72].

Acceptability, tolerability and feasibility of CAP

Based on the current literature review, CAP has high attendance and retention rates for adoles-
cents with mental health concerns, indicating high acceptability of CAP compared to standard
psychological treatments. Stefanini, Martino [71] and Stefanini, Martino [72] both reported 100%
attendance rates to each treatment session of their interventions. Although the data was poorly
reported, no dropouts are evident or reported for the therapeutic component of the seven inter-
ventions reviewed. If accurate, this speaks to high acceptability of these interventions. This is
important, as attrition is expected in mental health populations [89, 90] and is closely linked to
engagement [91]. Findings were supported by qualitative feedback indicating that CAP improved
attendance, disclosure, relationships and communication [56, 75]. This is in line with existing lit-
erature that suggests that the inclusion of a canine into psychotherapy improves therapeutic alli-
ance, trust and willingness to disclose [37, 55]. It was not possible to establish from this review
how likely adolescents would be to engage with CAP in comparison to other treatments. Given
the importance of engagement in this population group, these are key areas for further study.

Tolerability of CAP, based on the current findings, appears satisfactory for this population.
The majority of studies reported intended positive outcomes [56, 74, 75] including those that
were statistically superior [71, 72] or equivalent to [73] existing psychological treatments. Only
one study reported increased depression that was not attributed to the treatment [74].

CAP requires additional resources over and above traditional treatments, impacting feasi-
bility in some settings. For example, access to large rooms and outdoor spaces, may be of bene-
fit [71–74]. Facilitator training and/or supervision is required [73, 75], even when employing
external canine and handler teams [71, 72]. Screening, training or assessment of the canines is
also required [71–73, 75]. In this review, no authors reported on the welfare of the canines,
despite repeated calls in the literature to do so [92]. This is an area which requires additional
awareness and attention.

Limitations

This review was limited by the small number of studies (seven), their heterogeneity, and resul-
tant inability to perform meta-analysis. Only four of the studies achieved ‘fair’ or ‘good’ meth-
odological quality [65, 66] plus a moderate to high level of evidence [1, 69]. The details of
interventions were poorly reported, precluding replicability. There was significant variance in
the nature of the interventions, meaning that this review was unable to report on the impact of
elements within the interventions such as location, format, dose or role of the canine/facilita-
tor/handler. Nevertheless, this review contributes preliminary evidence to support the inclu-
sion of canines into mental health treatments for adolescents, to improve primary clinical
symptoms, facilitate attendance, increase rapport and positive socialisation. Including a canine
into therapy may also improve acceptability and tolerability for this difficult to engage popula-
tion group. Importantly, all of the studies engaged voluntary participants who consented to be
involved in interventions that included canines. This may have resulted in a self-selection bias
where conclusions are only generalizable to those adolescents who like canines and would
readily consent to engage with canines as a component of their mental health treatments.

Recommendations and future directions

A number of questions have arisen from the current literature namely, what are the specific
interactions or elements that create change and for which participants? Some excellent recom-
mendations to improve the quality of the literature have been made in previous reviews
including: clear and accurate use of terminology to describe interventions, such as those devel-
oped by the IAHAIO [5]; ensure therapeutic interventions are distinguished from brief
unstructured activities [14, 26]; and calls for standardization (manualisation) of interventions
to improve treatment fidelity and replicability [15, 26]. Whilst we support and reinforce these
recommendations, there are a number of very promising lines of enquiry that should be
adopted in future research.

An exploration of canine-facilitator-participant engagement. First, an exploration of
the engagement between facilitators, participants and canines is crucial. Previous literature
indicates that simple canine-presence is sufficient to impact treatment outcomes [34], whereas
other authors have indicated that active engagement [73] or matching of canines to partici-
pants [71, 72, 74] may also be important. Crucially, relevant and meaningful canine-presence
that is clearly related to the psychotherapeutic content has been found to have a superior effect
to incidental presence [41] and warrants further research. The role of the temperament or
behaviour of the canine should also be examined, to explore what, if any, impact this has. Pre-
vious literature has indicated that there may be a difference between canines who do and do
not solicit affection and attention [40]. Obtaining information from participants about the
nature of their relationship with the canines, and their perception of the canine’s role within
the therapy is an important future step for authors; specifically, how engaging were the
canines, how meaningful was their presence, and how relevant were the canines to the content
of the therapy. To our knowledge, no standardised measures exist to explore these factors, and
hence qualitative sampling should be used to elicit this information.

There have been many calls within the field for understanding of the characteristics of

interactions and interventions that cause change. To date, there have been no clear methodolo-
gies by which to do this. There have been some attempts to describe the level of ‘structure’ that
occurs in AAT upon a continuum, from non-directive play therapy through to greater struc-
ture that occurs when teaching a canine a trick [93]. This concept has not been reflected in any
of the studies we reviewed. We therefore recommend development and application of a consis-
tent nomenclature to describe the nature of the engagement with animals (of all species), and
also the role of the facilitator and participant in that engagement.

Spontaneous interactions are those in which the animal and the participant engage natu-
rally. In these interactions the animal is free to respond instinctively to the state or behaviour
of the participant(s), such as those applied by White, Quinn [39], and can be referred to as ani-
mal-led. Spontaneous interactions provide opportunities for the development of insight, as the
canine reflects to participants their level of arousal or emotional state, and these may be inter-
preted by the facilitator (handler) [94]. They also allow for the development of a meaningful
relationship to form between the participant and the canine, outside of their relationship with
the facilitator [8].

Adjunctive interventions, such as those employed by Hartwig [73], encompass structured
and semi-structured interventions in which the facilitator guides the interactions between the
animal and the participant, in order to achieve a pre-determined outcome. They are facilita-
tor-led, and ‘in addition to’ the standard treatment activity. For example, teaching a canine to
sit in order to develop communication or social skills, or engaging a canine in a mindfulness
exercise. Having animals present during these interactions may improve motivation to partici-
pate [95], or salience of the learned materials [96–98].

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

Experiential interventions do not appear to have been used widely within the canine-assis-
ted literature but are prevalent in the equine-assisted literature. It does not appear that experiential
interventions were utilised in any of the studies included in this review; although, Hartwig [73]
reflected that their use may have improved treatment outcomes. Experiential interventions
include interactions where the environment is set up by the facilitator, who then takes a non-
directive or supportive role during the interaction, allowing the participant to practice or experi-
ence change together with the animal, thereby learning by ‘doing’. These interventions are best
described as participant-led. For example, the facilitator may ask a participant to design an obsta-
cle course that reflects their current challenges, and then invite the canine to navigate the obstacles
with them, without help from the facilitator or canine-handler. Participants may be invited to
‘walk with’ or ‘play with’ the canine in whatever way feels right for the situation. Upon reflection
the participant is encouraged to develop their own meanings from the interactions.

Application of a language to describe the nature and types of interactions that are occurring

during interventions, together with standardisation of the interventions will lead to a greater
ability to evaluate the role of animals, facilitators and participants and assess their unique
contributions.

Theoretical foundations. Second, we recommend that further attention is given to the
links between the theories of human-animal interaction, for example the oxytocin hypothesis
[99], and how this relates to the nature or type of interventions that are being conducted
within therapy [53]. This review provides evidence to suggest, for example, that canine pres-
ence may be particularly beneficial to motivate attendance and improve retention [71, 72] pos-
sibly via the release of oxytocin in participants [53]. These benefits may be of particular
importance in the early phases of therapy in order to assist with participant engagement. This
information may be utilised to ensure engagement-related activities are made a priority at the
beginning of treatment.

This review also supports the existing literature which suggests that animal presence may
be soothing, calming or stress-relieving [34] possibly via reductions in stress physiology [53].
A focus on canine-related calming activities may therefore be particularly useful during the
middle and later phases of therapy when participants may be addressing difficult or distressing
content–such as trauma processing, and require assistance with grounding, mindfulness or
distress tolerance. Similarly, researchers and facilitators have previously identified the ability
of canines to give non-verbal feedback with regard to the state or behaviour of participants [7,
8, 94]. This may be particularly beneficial during the early and middle phases of therapy when
there is a focus on the development of self-awareness, behavioural or emotional regulation.
Working with canines may therefore provide real-life opportunities to practice cognitive and
behavioural reframing. It is also important for participants to feel confident in their ability to
maintain gains or changes once they leave therapy. The development of healthy relationships,
and the internalising of new skills are therefore important elements in the final phases of ther-
apy. Encouraging increasingly participant-led and experiential interactions during the final
phases of therapy may allow the participants to develop increased confidence in their abilities,
and the capacity to practice skills with someone other than the facilitator (i.e., with the therapy
canine).

To date, we have been unable to find any peer-reviewed, published canine-assisted therapy

protocols which draw on these theoretical foundations. Making explicit theoretical links
between the content of therapy and the types of interventions and interactions chosen will give
greater credibility to the field, distinguishing canine-assisted psychotherapy from other
canine-related activities.

Assessment of standardised interventions. Third, it is important to assess the outcomes

of any standardised CAP interventions and make changes accordingly. There have been

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210761 January 17, 2019

21 / 27

Canine-assisted psychotherapy for adolescents: A systematic review

numerous calls within the literature to increase the number of high quality randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) of AAT [e.g. 10]. It is not clear, however, what type of AAT should be
trialled, nor the important elements to include in such an intervention. There are currently no
published, clearly defined or recognised CAP protocols which could form the basis for RCTs.
We therefore recommend that following the development of a standardised protocol, prelimi-
nary trials are conducted to assess acceptability, tolerability, feasibility and qualitative out-
comes, prior to moving forward into RCTs.

Conclusions

There is evidence to suggest that CAP may improve the efficacy of mental health treatments in
self-selected adolescent populations via reductions in primary symptomatology including
PTSD and internalising symptoms, and the severity of serious psychiatric disorders. CAP may
also confer additional benefits via secondary factors that improve therapeutic processes and
quality, such as attendance and retention, positive socialisation, and feelings of connection.
Much work still needs to be done to establish the key components of CAP interventions

that are most effective. The authors of this review have proposed a clear nomenclature to
describe the interactions between canines, facilitators and participants, and provided recom-
mendations for establishing theoretically grounded, standardised (manualised), CAP interven-
tion protocols that may subsequently form the basis of efficacy and effectiveness testing via
RCTs.

We received no funding for this review.
