Abstract

Executive functions are thinking skills that assist with reasoning, planning, problem solving, and 
managing one’s life. The brain areas that underlie these skills are interconnected with and 
influenced by activity in many different brain areas, some of which are associated with emotion 
and stress. One consequence of the stress-specific connections is that executive functions, which 
help us to organize our thinking, tend to be disrupted when stimulation is too high and we are 
stressed out, or too low when we are bored and lethargic. Given their central role in reasoning and 
also in managing stress and emotion, scientists have conducted studies, primarily with adults, to 
determine whether executive functions can be improved by training. By and large, results have 
shown that they can be, in part through computer-based videogame-like activities. Evidence of 
wider, more general benefits from such computer-based training, however, is mixed. Accordingly, 
scientists have reasoned that training will have wider benefits if it is implemented early, with very 
young children as the neural circuitry of executive functions is developing, and that it will be most 
effective if embedded in children’s everyday activities. Evidence produced by this research, 
however, is also mixed. In sum, much remains to be learned about executive function training. 
Without question, however, continued research on this important topic will yield valuable 
information about cognitive development.

INTRODUCTION

The term executive function encompasses cognitive abilities that enable us to hold 
information in mind in working memory, to inhibit highly automatic responses to 
stimulation, and to shift the focus of attention between related but distinct aspects of a given 
task or problem. Executive, or cognitive control abilities, allow us to inhibit ingrained 
behaviors, to focus attention strategically, and to organize our thoughts in the face of 
distraction, complexity, and stress. Like many aspects of cognitive ability, executive

functions are useful in many different situations. Unfortunately, however, they also degrade 
rapidly under stress and pressure. If only we should all be so lucky to be as cool, calm, and 
collected as James Bond as he decides which wires to clip to defuse a nuclear bomb 
threatening to destroy civilization as its timer rapidly counts down to zero. If we could hang 
on to our thinking skills in the face of complexity and stress, in the face of pressure at work 
and in relationships, seemingly the world would be a better place and our lives would be 
more fulfilling (or at least we wouldn’t get blown to bits). More realistically, we might 
inhibit impulses that get us into trouble, that lead us down rocky paths and into bad 
decisions that bring problems, sickness, and even death. On the more positive side, we might 
do better in school and in work, routinely avoid bad situations and encounters, and feel 
generally good about the choices we make. Of course, there are situations in life in which it 
is far better to respond quickly without thinking about things, such as when hitting the 
brakes when the car in front of us stops suddenly in traffic. It is also possible to ‘over think’ 
or ruminate on a given situation or topic in ways that can impair our wellbeing and our 
ability to take action. For most aspects of daily life, however, executive functions are more 
help than hindrance.

Fortunately, like many aspects of cognitive ability, executive functions tend to get better the 
more we practice them. The big questions are how much better and what kind of practice? 
Although seemingly the stuff of fiction, the possibility that we can develop executive 
function skills through training is a tantalizing and scientifically realistic possibility; but how 
can we do this in a way that will lead to some lasting and broadly applicable benefits? The 
answer is complex and, for the most part, currently unknown. There are, however, some 
good indicators of what an answer might look like and the types of benefits this might bring 
to ourselves and our society.

NEUROSCIENCE

To begin, it is useful to consider some basic neurobiology. The brain areas associated with 
the thinking skills that make up executive functions – working memory, inhibitory control, 
flexible shifting of attention – are primarily ‘located’ in what is known as prefrontal cortex 
(PFC). The neural circuits that support these skills, however, involve numerous brain 
regions, including areas of cingulate cortex and parietal cortex as well as subcortical 
structures, primarily the basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus. In brief, specific 
networks of brain areas are active when we engage executive functions. These ares work 
together in an interconnected network to solve complex problems and help us reason about 
things. Most importantly for present purposes, some of the brain areas that are 
interconnected with PFC and make up the neural networks that support executive functions 
are part of the brain’s limbic system; particularly the amygdala. The limbic brain registers 
the emotional and motivational significance of things—events, persons, places, tasks, etc. 
Relatively rapid and automatic signaling from the limbic brain to the PFC helps to direct our 
attention and thinking skills to things that are meaningful to us and away from things that 
have less meaning. In a word, the interconnected limbic-to-PFC circuitry (or corticolimbic 
connectivity if you want to impress your friends) underlies goal-directed purposeful actions, 
from rare actions (as in, defuse the bomb before it blows up) to daily activities (plan your

day, solve a crossword puzzle, stop yourself from absent mindedly crossing the street against 
the light).

The interconnected limbic-to-PFC circuitry functions as a feedback loop. As the PFC 
receives input from the limbic brain, it feeds back on the limbic brain to modulate its input. 
In fact, the system is thought to work over short time periods to maintain a moderate level of 
input. That is, signaling from the limbic brain to the higher brain is in the form of 
neurotransmitters—dopamine, norepinephrine, the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol— that 
stimulate or more precisely modulate neural activity in the PFC brain areas that underlie 
executive functions1. When the increase in neurotransmitters/modulators is in a moderate 
range, PFC neural activity is strong and executive functions are working well. When the 
increase is too great, indicating that the person is under stress or over stimulated, or too low, 
indicating boredom and lethargy, then activity in PFC, and consequently the valuable 
thinking skills that this activity supports, is reduced.

BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION SKILLS TRAINING

Given the general principle of brain function and development, namely that “cells that fire 
together, wire together” (the idea that much of the brain’s circuitry and strength of 
connectivity is shaped over time by experience; what is referred to as use-dependent 
activity), it is reasonable to expect that an individual might strengthen his or her executive 
function skills by strengthening the neural circuitry that underlies these skills. By repeatedly 
practicing executive function types of tasks, one would repeatedly activate the PFC-to-limbic 
brain neural circuitry (as well as PFC connectivity throughout the brain related to the task at 
hand). Presumably such repeated practice, as long as it did not become too boring and 
repetitive and remained moderately challenging, would strengthen the top down control from 
PFC to limbic brain, as well as other brain areas, leading to better control of emotional 
responses to situations and to a cooler, calmer, more collected self. Such a scenario is 
plausible and some evidence suggests that this might be the case. Individuals practicing a 
specific type of executive function skill, namely, working memory, over 6-8 weeks about 
45mins per day get better at holding information in working memory and demonstrate 
changes in brain activity and even brain structure in relevant brain areas consistent with the 
increase in performance2. Primarily these activities are videogame-like activities that include 
things like remembering a series of locations, altering one’s actions in response to specific 
contextual cues, and overriding automatic responses. There is now a good body of evidence 
that repeated practice of executive skills (attention skills also) can be enhanced by practice in 
specific types of videogames and related types of activities3-5.

An important question, however, is whether the improvements in these skills will translate 
into gains that generalize across a variety of situations and behaviors. This generalizability 
question is a complicated one and looms large in this area of research. The question is 
whether training merely leads the individual to become better on the trained task and on 
similar types of tasks, something known as near transfer. The alternative is far transfer, 
where training leads to more widespread benefits, that is, gains that matter in the real world 
like becoming better at controlling one’s emotions or getting better at some higher-level skill 
such as math. Evidence pertaining to this key question is mixed. Some studies indicate that

training improves the control of behavior and attention for children with ADHD6. Some 
evidence also exists for other disorders (see Morrison & Chein5). Other studies, however, 
suggest that at best, near transfer is most frequently seen. One particularly interesting study 
with young adults demonstrated that working memory training led to improvements on a 
specific type of intelligence test that requires reasoning about matrices7. The idea here was 
that if intelligence and reasoning improved with training then perhaps many other things 
with which intelligence and reasoning are associated would also improve. Although the 
authors of that study did not look at broader underlying mental abilities beyond matrix 
reasoning, other similar studies with younger children have and demonstrate some benefits 
to broader abilities such as reading comprehension and mathematics that would be 
associated with general reasoning ability8, 9. Findings are far from definitive, however, and 
much remains to be done in this important area of research10. Methodologically speaking, 
there are many ways in which current studies could be improved. Some of these 
improvements are relatively straightforward, such as increasing sample size, while others are 
more complex, such as developing experimental manipulations to control for alternative, 
competing explanations for effects, such as social interaction11, 12.

EXPANDING THE PLAYING FIELD

Given pressing issues of generalizability, two overarching principles of psychological 
development would seem to readily come into play. One is the “earlier is better” principle 
and the other is the ecological validity principle. The earlier is better principle suggests that 
efforts at training and building executive function skills will be most effective when PFC and 
other brain areas, including limbic brain areas, are developing rapidly in childhood as 
executive functions are first emerging. Given that neural networks are less specialized and 
differentiated in infancy and early childhood, the idea is that they will be more amenable to 
the effects of training. The second, and related, principle, ecological validity, suggests that in 
addition to starting early, incorporating the training exercises into things that we want kids to 
become better at, such as learning things in school, should be most effective. This principle 
reflects the common sense idea that if we want training to help people in their everyday 
lives, then training should take place in the contexts in which individuals are typically 
situated, such as school and work. Realistically, what good is such training if it only 
improves performance on specific executive function assessments?

With respect to the earlier is better principle, there is some evidence to suggest that earlier 
actually is better. Starting as young as infancy, some enterprising researchers have shown 
that training attention skills through structured computerized presentations of information 
can support the development of attention and provide a foundation for later executive 
functions13, 14. There are longitudinal data indicating that attention in infancy is a great 
predictor of later mental ability15, 16, so training attention early to improve executive 
function makes good sense. As with the findings of training effects on the measure of 
intelligence in young adults, however, it may be that any observed positive effects would 
only be on superficial aspects of a given executive function task rather than broader 
underlying mental abilities. Longitudinal data are needed to determine whether starting early 
in life to train executive function skills through computer-based training of attention might 
lead to meaningful longer-term gains.

Related to the second principle, the ecological validity principle, why not start training early 
but do it in the context of preschool and kindergarten? Given that executive function skills 
support reasoning and problem solving, they are very useful in the classroom. Executive 
function training would assist students in learning new information in a context that would 
likely lead to high generalizability (or at least be very useful). But how to do this? Despite 
its appeal, playing videogames for part of the day in the classroom, on its own disconnected 
from other activities, would not seem to be a good idea (sorry kids.) Some insightful 
curriculum specialists, however, have been way ahead of the curve in this regard. Several 
years ago, these specialists recognized the power of structured play to encourage the 
development of complex thinking skills in young children. This is thought to occur primarily 
through the ability of structured play to encourage children to plan ahead and to reflect on 
their behavior, in a word, to be self-directed and, hence, self-regulated. Many experts 
consider the development of self-regulation skills, of which executive functions are the 
crown jewel, to be the most important objective of high quality preschool — to help children 
focus attention, be emotionally expressive, not be impulsive, and to engage in purposeful 
and meaningful interactions with caregivers and other children.

The use of child-directed, structured play and classroom activities are characteristic of 
Montessori education and of a program known as Tools of the Mind. Tools of the Mind and 
Montessori are thought to promote executive functions by providing children with 
opportunities for self-direction in choosing and completing learning activities. The programs 
are also thought to promote executive function skills by having children work collaboratively 
in ways that require each child to take the perspective of his or her partner. In addition, Tools 
of the Mind uses structured play and most importantly the planning of play in advance to 
encourage reflection and thereby the development of executive function skills.

Evaluations of Tools of the Mind and Montessori and similar educational approaches have 
been generally favorable, suggesting that they do indeed help young children build their 
executive function skills and to learn more quickly. For example, a ‘randomized’ (lottery 
system) evaluation of Montessori education indicated benefits to children’s executive 
functions as well as to academic achievement and play behavior17. Similarly, a recent 
randomized controlled trial evaluation of the Tools of the Mind program with children in 
kindergarten demonstrated benefits to executive functions and academic abilities as well as 
the ability to control attention in the face of emotionally arousing images18. These results 
followed RCT evaluations of the program with preschoolers, one of which found benefits to 
executive function skills19 with some evidence of academic benefits (Barnett et al., 2008) 
while another found no effects of Tools of the Mind on any aspect of child ability20. A third 
evaluation of the preschool program is now underway and is showing effects of the program 
on executive functions and academic abilities. In theory, by fostering the development of 
self-regulation, high quality preschool and early elementary education is understood to assist 
children in making sense of and building on the academic types of information that they will 
increasingly be exposed to throughout their school careers. Too much of an academic focus 
in early education without sufficient support for a strong foundation in self-regulation is 
ultimately self-defeating and likely to lead to worse, not better, school outcomes for 
children.

In addition to structured play, another approach to fostering executive functions is 
mindfulness meditation. Although not specific to school, this approach can and often is 
practiced by school children. Research on mindfulness meditation in adults indicates that 
mediation for even a short time improves attention and executive functions21. Educators and 
researchers are developing interesting techniques for assisting young children in meditating 
with some promising findings suggesting that the techniques are working22. Some of the 
best evidence for the effects of mindfulness meditation on executive functions comes from 
research with young adults. That research has shown not only effects on behavioral measures 
of executive functions but also on brain activity and connectivity in the limbic brain to 
higher brain PFC circuitry23. These effects suggest that although earlier may be better, it is 
perhaps never too late (or at least better late than never.) Research findings suggesting 
effects of training on executive functions in adults hold the very interesting possibility that 
we all might improve our well being and our job performance, interpersonal relationships, 
and so on through executive function training of one type or another, be it mindfulness 
meditation or videogame playing, or something else entirely. Perhaps recognition of the 
potential for change and the power to control one’s thinking skills – that effort matters more 
than ability – is enough to lead people to give it a try. It’s certainly something worth thinking 
about.

CONCLUSION

A number of studies with children and adults have shown that executive function skills -- 
particularly working memory — can be improved. The idea that we can increase our 
executive function abilities in ways that matter in our daily lives is less well established but 
would seem to be a realistic possibility. There have been very rapid advances in a relatively 
short period of time in the scientific understanding of executive functions and of how the 
brain works in general. It would seem likely that issues related to near and far transfer of 
executive function training will be resolved in the not too distant future and that executive 
function training will begin to make its way into a variety of activities, including educational 
and vocational training. An important aspect of progress in this research and its application, 
however, will be to pay close attention to how and under what circumstances training is 
actually effective and resulting in lasting gains. It is perhaps very easy to sell the idea that 
playing some sort of videogame, just like taking some sort of pill, might actually make one 
smarter and improve one’s life. If history and prior scientific evidence are any guide, 
however, genuine increases in ability are only likely to come through sustained and ongoing 
practice and persistence in things that matter to us most.
