Abstract 
Background:  There is a need to prevent anxiety and depression in young people and mindfulness contains impor‑
tant emotion regulation strategies. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a mindfulness‑based therapy, has 
yet to be evaluated as a prevention program, but has demonstrated an ability to reduce symptoms of anxiety and 
depression in adult and adolescent populations. This study examines the feasibility of using an ACT‑based prevention 
program in a sample of year 10 (aged 14–16 years) high school students from Sydney, Australia.

Methods:  Participants were allocated to either their usual classes or to the ACT‑based intervention. Participants were 
followed for a period of 5 months post‑intervention and completed the Flourishing Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress 
Scale, and a program evaluation questionnaire. Analyses were completed using intention‑to‑treat mixed models for 
repeated measures.

Results:  The results indicated that the intervention was acceptable to students and feasible to administer in a school 
setting. There were no statistically significant differences between the conditions, likely due to the small sample size 
(N 
 48). However, between‑group effect sizes demonstrated small to large differences for baseline to post‑interven‑
tion mean scores and medium to large differences for baseline to follow‑up mean scores, all favouring the ACT‑based 
condition.

Conclusion:  The results suggest that an ACT‑based school program has potential as a universal prevention program 
and merits further investigation in a larger trial.

Background
Youth  are  disproportionately  represented  in  epidemio-
logical  studies  of  anxiety  and  depressive  disorders  [1]. 
Furthermore, evidence suggests that 50% of these disor-
ders begin before the age of 14 and 75% by age 24 years 
[2]. Anxiety and depressive disorders significantly impact 
on  individuals,  their  families,  workplaces,  communities, 
and  countries  [3–5],  making  prevention  an  important 
goal.  Compared  to  treatment  in  the  early  stages  of  the

disorder,  termed  ‘early  intervention’,  prevention  averts 
the  short-  and  long-term  consequences  of  such  disor-
ders and has been shown to be more cost-effective [6, 7]. 
Prevention  programs  that  are  delivered  to  all  individu-
als irrespective of their level of symptomatology, termed 
‘universal  prevention’,  reduce  the  logistical  difficulties 
involved in large-scale screening, avert missing suscepti-
ble students, and ensure that the benefits of such a pro-
gram  are  available  to  all.  Existing  prevention  programs 
have largely drawn these skills from cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT), which focuses primarily on teaching indi-
viduals to change their appraisal of a situation in order to 
modify the emotional experience [8–11].

Mindfulness,  a  particular  manner  of  engaging  with 
one’s environment, is a concept that has grown in popu-
larity  over  recent  years.  It  has  been  defined  as  compris-
ing  two  components—paying  attention  to  the  present 
moment  and  doing  so  with  a  non-judgmental  attitude 
[12]. These two components correspond closely with two 
well-established  emotion  regulation  strategies:  attention 
deployment  and  acceptance  [13,  14].  Attention  deploy-
ment is the ability to choose which aspect of a situation 
to  focus  on  while  acceptance  involves  allowing  an  emo-
tion to occur without attempting to avoid the experience. 
With emotion regulation implicated in the development 
of mental disorders, particularly to anxiety disorders and 
depression  [14–17],  it  is  unsurprising  that  numerous 
clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  that  mindfulness  can 
assist  with  a  wide  range  of  mental  health  symptoms  in 
adult populations [18–28].

There  are  reasons  to  believe  that  mindfulness  may  be 
beneficial  to  adolescents  in  navigating  their  environ-
ment.  Developmental  brain  changes  mean  that  ado-
lescents  are  more  impacted  by  emotions  than  adults  or 
children: they have increased limbic reactivity (indicative 
of a greater sensitivity to threat), a stronger startle reflex 
(suggesting a more intense automatic emotional reactiv-
ity),  and  are  more  interfered  by  emotional  stimuli  when 
completing tasks [29–32]. In spite of adolescents experi-
encing  stronger  emotional  reactions,  the  frontal  lobe  of 
the brain, which controls the executive functions such as 
judgment, impulse control, planning, and emotion regu-
lation,  remains  underdeveloped  [33].  Mindfulness  and 
its ability to regulate emotions, may help counteract this 
imbalance. Research has demonstrated that mindfulness 
can reduce mental health symptoms in both clinical and 
non-clinical adolescent populations [34].

therapy 

There  are  a  number  of  existing  programs  that  have 
been designed to train individuals to become more mind-
ful  such  as  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR), 
mindfulness-based  cognitive 
(MBCT),  and 
acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT).  MBSR  has 
a focus on teaching meditation practices, which serve to 
train the brain to become more mindful (similar to using 
weight  training  to  increase  physical  strength).  MBCT 
combines  meditational  practices  with  components  of 
cognitive-behavioural  therapy  for  depression.  Unlike 
MBCT  and  MBSR,  ACT  does  not  use  meditation  but 
rather  is  didactic  in  style  and  draws  heavily  on  imagery, 
metaphors,  personal  stories,  and  short  experiential 
exercises.  It  also  focuses  on  the  application  of  mindful-
ness to emotions and related internal constructs such as 
thoughts,  memories,  and  body  sensations.  In  addition 
to  mindfulness,  ACT  draws  on  the  concept  of  ‘values’ 
as  an  over-arching  framework  to  guide  the  intervention 

techniques,  improve  life-satisfaction,  and  increase  moti-
vation.  ACT  defines  values  as  the  type  of  person  an 
individual  wishes  to  be  in  the  future.  Behavioural  prin-
ciples  are  also  incorporated  into  ACT  to  assist  a  per-
son  in  working  towards  their  values.  Engaging  in  such 
behaviours  that  are  important  and  goal-directed  even 
while  experiencing  intense  emotions,  may  be  regarded 
as  a  form  of  emotion  regulation  [35].  Acceptance  prin-
ciples  are  encouraged  when  thoughts  and  feelings  draw 
the  individual  away  from  maintaining  value  consistent 
behaviours.  ACT  does  not  distinguish  between  psy-
chopathology  and  everyday  struggles  and  so,  is  equally 
applicable to those with or without significant psychopa-
thology. While ACT was developed for adults, it has been 
successfully  applied  to  adolescent  clinical  populations 
[36–38].  When  used  with  adolescents,  ACT  principals 
remain the same but exercises, examples, and metaphors 
employed will be more age appropriate [39].

Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  is  an  appealing 
mindfulness  program  to  use  with  adolescents  compared 
to other meditation-based programs because adolescents 
may  struggle  to  engage  with  meditation,  particularly  in 
a school setting. It is also appealing for use with adoles-
cents as it places particular emphasis on using mindful-
ness  to  regulate  emotions,  which  is  important  for  this 
age  group.  Finally,  the  additional  components  of  ACT 
such as values may be particularly useful for adolescents 
as  they  are  in  an  important  transitional  period  where 
they are creating a self-identity. ACT has been shown to 
be effective in clinical samples of adolescents to address 
symptoms of depression and anxiety [37, 38] but remains 
untested  as  a  prevention  program  (i.e.  in  a  non-clinical 
sample of adolescents). The results from clinical samples 
suggest  that  ACT  is  effective  as  an  emotion  regulation 
strategy and so is worth evaluating as a prevention pro-
gram. There are nonetheless differences in using ACT as 
a  therapy  compared  to  as  a  prevention  program.  Many 
ACT-based  therapies  will  incorporate  other  elements  to 
target the disorder (e.g. behavioural activation for depres-
sion or exposure for anxiety) whereas in prevention this 
may be less relevant. Instead it may be more important to 
emphasise how experiential avoidance can lead to many 
types  of  problems  and  techniques  that  can  be  used  to 
reduce  experiential  avoidance.  Furthermore,  the  exam-
ples used to illustrate how ACT can be applied to real-life 
situations  in  clinical  therapies  may  need  to  be  modified 
to make ACT more relevant to a non-clinical population.
The  present  study  sought  to  investigate  for  the  first 
time  an  ACT-based  intervention  as  a  school  universal 
prevention program. One problem in the evaluation of a 
new prevention program is the issue of statistical power. 
Given  there  is  a  low  rate  of  emergence  of  new  cases  of

anxiety and depression over any given period, it has been 
estimated  that  over  30,000  participants  are  needed  to 
adequately power a prevention program evaluation study 
[40].  Measuring  symptom  reduction  rather  than  cases 
can  reduce  this  figure  but  still  almost  1000  would  be 
required  to  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  differ-
ence between conditions [41]. However to justify invest-
ment in a trial of this size, preliminary evidence, obtained 
in  a  feasibility  study,  is  required.  The  aims  of  this  study 
were  to:  (a)  examine  the  feasibility  and  acceptability  of 
using  an  ACT-based  prevention  program  that  targets 
anxiety and depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sam-
ple  of  adolescents;  and  (b)  to  compare  the  impact  of 
the  ACT-based  program  on  wellbeing  and  symptoms  of 
depression and anxiety. It was expected that there would 
be  a  trend  for  the  ACT  participants  to  demonstrate 
improvements on a range of measures compared to par-
ticipants  in  the  control  condition.  Given  the  underpow-
ered  nature  of  feasibility  studies,  this  trial  sought  to  use 
effect  sizes  as  an  indication  of  feasibility  and  to  provide 
evidence  to  determine  whether  a  large-scale  prevention 
study of this intervention would be appropriate.

Methods
Participants

Participants  were  drawn  from  a  private  high  school 
located  in  Sydney,  Australia.  Students  attending  this 
school  are  socio-economically  advantaged  compared 
with  other  students  in  the  state  of  New  South  Wales 
and  Australia,  with  76%  in  the  top  quartile  on  a  meas-
ure of socio-educational advantage [42]. The school per-
forms well academically and is ranked in the top 15% of 
schools  in  New  South  Wales  [43].  All  students  in  year 
10  (N  =  122)  were  invited  to  participate  in  the  study 
and,  if  they  agreed,  were  required  to  provide  signed 
parental  and  self-consent.  Regardless  of  participation 
in  the  evaluation  study,  all  year  10  students  attended 
the  ACT  workshops  as  it  was  required  curriculum. 
Year  10  in  the  Australian  school  system  is  the  3rd  year 
completed  before  graduating  from  high  school.  Ethi-
cal  approval  was  obtained  from  the  University  of  New 
South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (refer-
ence HC13132). Of the 122 students in year 10 who were 
invited  to  take  part  in  the  study,  76  were  males  (62%). 
Forty-nine  participants  provided  self-  and  parental-
consent. The primary reason the remaining students did 
not  take  part  was  due  to  not  returning  signed  parental 
consent forms. Of the 49 participants who provided self- 
and  parental-consent,  one  student’s  data  had  to  be  dis-
carded  because  of  unreliable  information.  A  flow  chart 
presents  participants  progression  through  the  study 
(Fig. 1). The final sample comprised 48 participants aged 

between 14 and 16 years (M = 15.64), of whom 28 were 
male (58%).

Interventions
ACT condition

An  ACT-based  prevention  program  was  developed  by 
two  of  the  authors  (RB  and  VM)  that  utilises  the  ACT 
components  of:  values,  committed  action,  contact  with 
present  moment,  acceptance  of  emotions,  and  thought 
defusion. These  components  are  included  in  other  ACT 
trials and are consistent with the manner in which ACT 
is  described  by  the  original  authors  of  ACT  [44].  While 
ACT  traditionally  includes  a  section  on  the  component 
of  self-as-context,  the  technique  of  detaching  from  the 
experience,  this  was  dropped  from  the  current  inter-
vention  as  the  facilitator  (RB)  has  found  that  it  is  a  dif-
ficult  and  confusing  concept  to  transmit  to  adolescents. 
Many programs make changes to the original therapy in 
order  to  better  suit  the  population  targeted  [e.g.  36,  45] 
and  other  ACT  interventions  have  also  chosen  not  to 
include  this  component  [46].  The  lead  author  delivered 
each session of the ACT program face-to-face to half of 
year  10  (approximately  60  students,  30%  of  whom  were 
enrolled  in  the  study)  in  an  amphitheatre  at  the  school. 
The  aim  of  each  session  was  to  educate  the  students  on 
a particular concept (e.g. values) and encourage them to 
apply the concepts to their everyday life. To achieve this 
aim in each session, verbal explanations, personal stories, 
metaphors,  PowerPoint  slides,  videos,  and  experiential 
exercises were used. An example of an experiential exer-
cise was the mindful eating of a sultana to help teach the 
concept  of  contact  with  present  moment.  The  lecture-
style  presentations  were  supported  by  four  teacher-led 
exercises  between  the  presentations,  during  class  time 
and  in  smaller  groups  (approximately  15  students). 
Teacher  exercises,  outlined  in  Table  1,  were  based  on 
the  ACT  components  of  thought  defusion,  contact  with 
present moment, and values. All workshops and teacher-
led  classes  were  25  min  in  duration.  In  total,  students 
received 4.6 h of the intervention.

The control condition

The  control  condition  comprised  ‘Pastoral  Care’,  which 
was  their  usual  class  activity  during  the  time  slot  that 
the  ACT  workshops  were  being  delivered.  In  these 
classes  of  around  15  students,  material  on  social  jus-
tice  and  cyber-safety  was  presented  by  a  schoolteacher 
who had been assigned to the tutorial at the start of the 
semester,  prior  to  the  study  commencing.  Duration  of 
both programs was equivalent—all Pastoral Care classes 
were 25 min in duration and students received 4.6 h of 
Pastoral Care.

Procedure
Recruitment and procedure

The  program  was  delivered  to  half  year  10  students  in 
Term  1  and  half  in  Term  3.  The  school  made  attend-
ing  the  workshops  obligatory  but  participation  in  the 
study  was  voluntary.  Prior  to  the  first  session,  partici-
pants  filled  out  baseline  questionnaires  and  students 
who  were  absent  on  the  day  were  approached  up  to 

1  week  later.  Workshops  began  1  week  after  the  base-
line questionnaires were completed and were delivered 
once per week for 7 weeks. At the end of the last ACT 
workshop, participants completed a program evaluation 
survey. The post-intervention questionnaire was admin-
istered 1 week after the final workshop. Attempts were 
made  to  contact  absent  students  for  a  period  of  up  to 
2 weeks. The follow-up questionnaire was administered

5  months  after  the  baseline  questionnaire  was  com-
pleted.  After  the  final  follow-up  questionnaires  were 
collected,  the  ACT  program  was  delivered  to  the  con-
trol condition.

Design and randomisation

The  current  study  was  a  quasi-randomised  controlled 
study.  Randomisation  was  conducted  by  a  staff  member 
of  the  school  who  was  independent  of  the  study  using 
cluster  randomisation  based  on  their  tutorial  groups  of 
which there were eight in the year group. Tutorial groups 
had a name and these were listed alphabetically and the 
first  assigned  to  the  ACT  condition  and  the  last  four  to 
the  control  condition.  Randomisation  was  completed 
before enrolment in the study because attendance to the 
workshops was a required curricular activity for students. 
It  was  for  this  reason  that  there  were  disproportionate 
numbers  in  each  condition  and  the  randomisation  was 
considered ‘quasi’.

The ACT program facilitator

The ACT workshop facilitator (RB) had 6 years of univer-
sity training in psychology, including 2 years in a clinical 
master’s program. He had also received specialist training 
and supervision in ACT and had previously delivered the 
same material to a similar sized group of students in the 
same  school.  At  the  time  of  workshop  delivery,  he  had 
approximately 2 years’ experience using ACT in both an 
individual and group context.

Measures

A  questionnaire  for  anxiety  and  depression  symptoms 
and  a  wellbeing  scale  were  selected  as  outcome  meas-
ures. While it was acknowledged that there are inherent 
difficulties in using a measure of anxiety and depression 
created for clinical populations in a non-clinical sample, 

it was esteemed that it was the best choice of the alterna-
tives available. The symptom measure selected has been 
used  and  validated  in  a  non-clinical  adolescent  popula-
tion [47–49]. In addition, a program evaluation question-
naire was created specifically for this study. Finally, while 
a  fidelity  scale  created  for  another  study  [50]  was  used, 
technical problems meant the data was not obtained.

The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale—Short Form 
(DASS‑21)

The DASS-21 is a widely used measure of negative affect 
[51].  It  comprises  21  items  scored  on  a  4-point  Lik-
ert  scale.  For  adults,  items  load  onto  three  subscales—
depressive  symptoms,  anxiety  symptoms,  and  stress 
symptoms.  Both  the  anxiety  and  stress  subscale  are 
measures  of  anxiety,  the  former  are  symptoms  found  in 
phobias  while  the  latter  is  consistent  with  generalized 
anxiety  disorder.  For  adolescents  some  authors  found 
the  same  loading  structure  as  for  adults  whereas  others 
found  a  single  loading—negative  affect  [47–49].  Given 
these  discrepancies,  both  the  three  subscales  and  a  sin-
gle total score were used in the current study. For adoles-
cents, the Cronbach’s α has been found to be .87 for the 
depression subscale, .79 for the anxiety subscale, and .83  
for  the  stress  subscale  [48].  In  the  current  study,  the 
Cronbach’s α was .90 for the depression subscale, .81 for 
anxiety, .88 for stress, and .95 for DASS-Total.

Flourishing Scale (FS)

The  FS  is  a  7-item  measure  of  wellbeing  with  responses 
given  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale  [52].  Items  assess  sev-
eral  domains  of  wellbeing  including  social  relationships, 
competency  in  activities,  optimism,  purpose  and  mean-
ing, and self-esteem. The FS has a single factor structure 
with  item  loadings  between  .72  and  .81  [53].  The  scale 
also  correlates  negatively  with  the  Centre  for  Epidemio-
logic  Studies—Depression  Scale  (−.60).  Amongst  the 
18–20 year-old cohort in this study, the mean score was 
42.71 (SD = 7.96) with a Cronbach’s α of .87.

Program evaluation

A  series  of  10  questions  with  a  6-point  Likert  scale  was 
created  for  this  study:  “Because  of  the  workshops…  (a) 
I’m clearer about what’s important to me in life (values); 
(b)  I  am  more  comfortable  sitting  with  negative  emo-
tions;  (c)  My  negative  thoughts  impact  me  less;  d)  I  am 
exercising  more;  (e)  I  feel  happier;  (f )  I  feel  more  confi-
dent; (g) Anxiety is less of a problem for me; (h) I am get-
ting along better with friends or family; (i) I have found 
that  the  workshops/tutorials  have  helped  me;  (j)  I  have 
been applying what I learnt in the workshops/tutorials to 
my everyday life.” The measure was delivered at the post-
intervention time-point only.

Statistical analysis

Statistical  analysis  was  completed  using  SPSS  22.0.  For 
the  DASS-21  subscales,  at  least  six  of  the  seven  items 
were required to compute a mean and seven of the eight 
items  for  the  FS,  as  per  author  guidelines.  For  baseline 
and dropout comparisons, t-tests were used for continu-
ous variables and Chi square tests of independence with 
Yates  Continuity  Correction  for  categorical  variables.  In 
the  universal  effects  analysis  comparing  outcome  scores 
between  the  ACT  and  control  conditions  an  intention-
to-treat  analysis  was  used.  Mixed  models  with  repeated 
measures  (MMRM)  is  considered  to  be  particularly 
appropriate for school-based studies or when the dropout 
rate is above 5% as it includes all available data from both 
completers  and  dropouts  [54].  A  single  analysis  exam-
ined  the  outcome  scores  across  the  three  time-points. 
To select the covariance structure, the best fitting model 
using  Akaike’s  information  criterion  was  retained.  The 
parameters of the model were estimated using restricted 
maximum likelihood as the evidence suggests it is prefer-
able over maximum likelihood when the sample is small 
[55]. The dppc2, formula [56] was used to estimate Cohen’s 
d effect sizes, except for the Chi square tests that Phi (φ) 
effect size, both of which were interpreted using Cohen’s 
standards [57]. A positive effect size on the DASS-21 and 
FS scales represent improvement in symptoms and well-
being, respectively.

Results
Mean  scores  and  standard  deviations  for  the  ACT  and 
control condition are presented in Table 2.

Baseline comparisons

The comparison of baseline scores of the ACT and con-
trol  conditions  found  no  significant  differences  for 
DASS-depression  (p  =  .55),  DASS-anxiety  (p  =  .88), 
DASS-stress  (p  =  .48),  DASS-total  (p  =  .96),  or  FS 

(p = .37). No significant difference in sex distribution was 
found between the conditions (p = .72).

Comparison of dropouts

Comparisons of the differences between participants that 
completed  their  post-intervention  and  follow-up  ques-
tionnaires  (‘completers’)  from  those  who  did  not  (‘drop-
outs’)  suggested  there  were  no  significant  differences 
between  post-intervention  completers  and  dropouts 
on  DASS-depression  (p  =  .69,  Cohen’s  d  =  .14),  DASS-
anxiety (p = .88, Cohen’s d = .05), DASS-stress (p = .72, 
Cohen’s d = .11), DASS-total (p = .81, Cohen’s d = .08), 
and FS (p = .93, Cohen’s d = .02). Likewise, no differences 
were found between follow-up dropouts and completers 
scores  for  DASS-depression  (p  =  .36,  Cohen’s  d  =  .27), 
DASS-anxiety  (p  =  .18,  Cohen’s  d  =  .41),  DASS-stress 
(p = .29, Cohen’s d = .33), DASS-total (p = .24, Cohen’s 
d = .36), and FS (p = .28, Cohen’s d = .32). No significant 
differences were detected on the variable sex between the 
completers  and  dropouts  at  post-intervention  (p  =  .67, 
φ = .11) or follow-up (p = .92, φ = .06). Likewise, no dif-
ferences in attrition were observed between the ACT and 
control conditions at post-intervention (p = .10, φ = .27) 
or follow-up (p = .20, φ = .18).

Universal effects of the program
The  MMRM  findings  from  the  Time  ×  Condition  anal-
yses  are  presented  in  Table  3.  There  were  no  significant 
differences  between  the  ACT  and  control  conditions 
for  the  DASS-21  or  FS.  However,  given  this  was  a  pilot 
study in a non-clinical sample, we were chiefly interested 
in whether effect sizes suggested that a larger trial of the 
intervention would be worthwhile. Effect sizes were cal-
culated for both baseline-post and baseline-follow-up dif-
ferences. Table 4 presents Cohen’s d effect sizes observed 
for  the  difference  between  the  ACT  and  control  condi-
tions.  Results  indicate  medium  or  large  between-group

Program evaluation

Twenty-four  participants,  from  both  conditions,  com-
pleted the ACT program evaluation. Program evaluation 
data are summarized in Table 5. To assess the percentage 
of affirmative/negative responses, the ‘Strongly Disagree’, 
‘Moderately  Disagree’,  and  ‘Slightly  Disagree’  responses 
were combined into a single outcome ‘Disagree’ and the 
same done for the three agree options which were com-
bined into ‘Agree’. Overall, there was agreement with the 
questions posed, except in response to whether they were 
exercising more.

Discussion
The  current  study  investigated  the  feasibility  of  using 
an  ACT-based  prevention  program  for  adolescents  in  a 
school setting. As expected because of the small sample 
size,  the  analyses  indicated  that  there  were  no  statisti-
cally  significant  differences  between  the  ACT  and  con-
trol  conditions  on  the  outcome  measures  of  depression, 
stress,  anxiety,  total  negative  affect,  and  wellbeing.  The 
effect  sizes,  which  were  expected  to  be  of  greater  util-
ity  in  this  study,  ranged  from  small  to  large  according 
to  Cohen’s  standards  [57],  all  in  the  direction  of  greater 
improvements  in  the  ACT  compared  to  control  condi-
tion.  The  high  rate  of  endorsement  of  the  various  items 
in  the  workshop  evaluation  questionnaire  also  suggests 
that many participants perceived benefits from the work-
shops.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  time  that  an 
ACT-based program has been evaluated as a prevention

program in a non-clinical population of adolescents. It is 
conceivable that with a larger sample size, a universal pre-
vention evaluation study of an ACT-based program may 
find mean differences that are statistically significant.

Interestingly, the present study found that stress scores 
demonstrated greater improvements over time than anxi-
ety scores on the DASS-21. While both are broad meas-
ures  of  anxiety,  the  stress  scale  of  the  DASS-21  relates 
to  cognitive  symptoms  (i.e.  worry)  while  the  anxiety 
subscale  tends  to  relate  to  physiological  symptoms  (e.g. 
increased heart beat). Given that worry may be regarded 
as  a  form  of  avoidance  [58],  it  is  unsurprising  that  this 
aspect  would  be  more  amendable  to  change  for  par-
ticipants  in  the  ACT  intervention  compared  to  physi-
cal  symptoms  that  are  not  associated  with  avoidance 
behaviours.

Compared  to  the  findings  from  CBT  prevention  pro-
grams,  our  results  are  encouraging.  A  meta-analysis  of 
prevention  programs  for  depression  [10]  found  that  the 
average effect size from baseline to post-intervention was 
Pearson’s r = .15 (Cohen’s d = .30), which is equivalent to 
our results. Effect sizes at follow-up were Pearson’s r = .11 
(Cohen’s  d  =  .20),  which  is  lower  than  the  effect  size 
found  in  the  present  study.  Early  intervention  programs 
targeting  depression  and  other  mental  health-related 
problems  have  reported  a  reduction  in  efficacy  from

post-intervention  to  follow-up  [10,  59].  These  programs 
were  predominately  CBT-based  and  thus  focused  on 
teaching skills, the retention of which is likely to diminish 
over  time.  The  present  intervention,  on  the  other  hand, 
observed an increase in efficacy from post-intervention to 
follow-up. It is possible that ACT may create a more fun-
damental  shift  in  how  a  person  relates  to  their  thoughts 
and feelings rather than teaching a new set of skills [60].

The program evaluation questions showed strong satis-
faction with the ACT program. The item which most stu-
dents  agreed  with  related  to  increased  confidence  from 
the  workshops.  This  is  likely  to  reflect  that  many  young 
people  struggle  with  low  confidence.  Despite  two-thirds 
of  participants  reporting  that  the  workshops  were  help-
ful, three-quarters said they felt more confident because 
of them, which may be reflective of a tendency amongst 
adolescents to downplay positive changes.

The present study used a large group setting to deliver 
the  workshops,  with  approximately  60  students  attend-
ing the workshop at the same time. The findings suggest 
that future early intervention programs may not need to 
be  delivered  to  small  groups.  Large  groups  enable  pro-
grams to be more readily delivered by external psycholo-
gists (due to reduced costs) rather than teachers which is 
an important advantage given that research suggests that 
compared  to  teacher-led  programs,  psychologist  facili-
tated  programs  have  better  outcomes  [59,  61].  In  addi-
tion,  it  was  observed  that  in  the  present  study,  students 
asked  clarifying  questions  on  the  workshop  material 
that  schoolteachers  without  psychology  training/experi-
ence  would  have  difficulty  in  answering.  The  responses 
to  these  questions  appeared  important  to  ensure  stu-
dents understood the material taught. For these reasons, 
we  recommend  that  trained  psychologists  rather  than 
schoolteachers deliver the program.

This study did have a number of methodological issues 
that  limit  the  conclusions  that  can  be  drawn,  including 
the  small  sample  size  and  the  quasi-randomisation  pro-
cess. Although the randomisation method led to unequal 
numbers  of  participants  in  each  condition,  importantly, 
baseline  differences  between  conditions  were  not  sta-
tistically  different.  Another  limitation  was  the  inability 
to  differentiate  the  benefits  obtained  from  the  practical 
teacher-led  exercises  compared  to  the  psychologist-led 
workshops. Future research to examine their differential 
benefits  would  be  of  interest.  The  study  was  also  lim-
ited  in  that  the  sample  used  was  a  private  school  with 
students  from  high  socio-economic  status  families.  It 
would  be  of  interest  to  evaluate  the  program  across  the 
socio-economic  spectrum.  The  present  study  experi-
enced  a  substantial  dropout  of  participants  in  the  con-
trol  condition  between  baseline  and  post-intervention. 
The workshops ended close to school holidays and so the 

limited time available before students left meant that the 
students  in  the  control  condition,  absent  on  the  day  the 
questionnaires  were  administered,  could  not  be  located. 
This learning can be utilised in future school-based pro-
gram evaluation research to avoid this same issue.

There  are  a  number  of  components  that  would  be 
of  benefit  to  include  in  a  larger  trial  of  an  ACT-based 
prevention  program.  Examining  an  increased  range  of 
outcomes,  such  as  academic  indicators  and  social  rela-
tionships  (e.g.  family,  friendships,  teacher–student)  in 
addition  to  the  mental  health  outcomes,  would  be  of 
interest. The study design could also have been improved 
by  including  a  measure  of  emotion  regulation,  and  it  is 
recommended  that  future  studies  in  this  area  do  so.  In 
addition, it would be of benefit that such a trial test the 
model  that  mindfulness  reduces  and  prevents  depres-
sive  and  anxiety  symptoms  through  improved  emotion 
regulation. Including mediator variables and testing this 
model  through  analysis  would  provide  greater  insight 
into  the  link  between  mindfulness  and  symptom  reduc-
tion/prevention. Future trials could also be strengthened 
by  examining  potential  confounds  and  moderators  of 
outcome, such as previous experience with mindfulness, 
current  engagement  with  mental  health  professionals, 
student  tutorial  group,  school  exams  during  the  study 
period, and past engagement with mental health preven-
tion  workshops.  Finally,  although  it  would  be  resource 
intensive, a future trial that can compare the effectiveness 
of  several  key  emotion  regulation  strategies  (e.g.  prob-
lem-solving,  cognitive  re-appraisals,  and  acceptance)  as 
well as a combined program of all these together, would 
be of great benefit to the field of prevention.

Conclusions
The  results  from  the  current  feasibility  study  found  that 
an ACT-based prevention program delivered in a school 
setting  led  to  moderate  to  large  effect  size  differences 
between  the  conditions  at  the  5  month  follow-up  and 
that  the  program  was  feasible  and  acceptable  to  partici-
pants.  This  study  suggests  that  an  ACT-based  program 
should  be  examined  further  in  a  larger  and  more  repre-
sentative sample. A number of lessons can be drawn from 
this study to inform such a trial.
