Abstract

Background—Although a behavioral addiction model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
has been proposed, it is still unclear if and how self-report and neurocognitive measures of 
impulsivity (such as risk-taking-, reflection- and motor-impulsivities) are impaired and/or inter-
related in this particular clinical population.

Methods—Seventeen OCD patients and 17 age-, gender-, education- and IQ-matched controls 
completed the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, and the 
Beck Depression Inventory and were evaluated with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 
and three computerized paradigms including reward (the Cambridge Gambling Task), reflection 
(the Information Sampling Task) and motor impulsivity (Stop Signal Task).

Results—Despite not differing from healthy controls in any neurocognitive impulsivity domain, 
OCD patients demonstrated increased impulsivity in a self-report measure (particularly attentional 
impulsivity). Further, attentional impulsivity was predicted by severity of obsessive-compulsive 
symptoms.

Conclusions—Our findings suggest that OCD is characterized by a subjective (rather than 
objective) impulsivity; in addition, self-reported impulsivity was largely determined by severity of 
OCD symptoms.

Introduction

Compulsivity has been defined as the “tendency to perform repetitive acts in a habitual/
stereotyped manner to attempt to prevent adverse consequences” [1], whereas impulsivity is 
considered “a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli 
without regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individuals 
or to others” [2]. Compulsivity and impulsivity are traditionally considered opposite ends of 
a risk aversive vs. seeking spectrum [3]. However, this model has been criticized by many 
researchers, who argue that compulsivity and impulsivity actually seem to be orthogonally 
[4] or positively [5] related. Accordingly, many clinicians have noted they and may actually 
coexist in increased levels in individual patients with obsessive-compulsive and related 
disorders, substance and behavioural addictions, or disruptive, impulse-control and conduct 
disorders [6].

Evidence of impulsive traits in OCD and of compulsive features in addictions and impulse 
control disorders has contributed to the hypothesis that impulsivity and compulsivity may 
share common neurobiological mechanisms. For instance, neurocognitive [7], imaging [8], 
and neurosurgical [9] studies suggest that OCD participants exhibit dysfunctional reward 
processes thought to be important to impulse control and addictive disorders [10]. 
Consequently, a behavioural addiction model for OCD has been recently proposed [11]. 
There is evidence suggesting that impulsivity in OCD tend to become more prominent with 
the progression and severity of the disorder [12]. According to this model, long-term OCD 
participants could display decreased resistance, control and insight in relation to their 
compulsive (particularly motor) behaviours, thus characterizing what some have termed 
‘impulsive compulsions’ for representing compulsive behaviours that are performed in an 
automatic/unplanned fashion [6, 12–15].

Although several studies have found increased neurocognitive [16–18] and self-reported 
impulsivity [16, 18–21] in OCD patients, there is still debate on which types and/or domains 
of impulsivity are predominantly affected among these individuals. For instance, some 
studies were unable to find differences in terms of motor and/or risk taking impulsivity 
between OCD patients and controls [22, 23]. Perhaps because of different methodologies, 
impairments in OCD samples have been reported in some [24, 25] but not all meta-analysis 
[26, 27]. Similarly, reflection impulsivity (tendency to gather and evaluate information 
before making a decision) [28] has been only sparsely assessed in adult [29] and juvenile 
[30] OCD participants, with inconsistent findings. For instance, although reflection 
impulsivity levels did not differ between adult OCD patients and controls [29], juvenile 
OCD samples have shown an increased decision threshold (the opposite of an impulsive 
decision) in a different version of the task using computational modelling [30].

Despite all the empirical evidence suggesting that compulsivity and impulsivity can share 
some characteristics, it is important to study how they relate to each other both at the self-
reported and at the neurocognitive levels, which may also not necessarily correlate with each 
other [31]. For instance, research has shown increased rates of impulse control disorders 
[including motorically-focused (“low order”) disorders such as trichotillomania (hair pulling

disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorders] in OCD patients from different cultures 
[32–35]; medium effect sizes for response inhibition according to Stroop Interference [26]; 
but no evidence of greater commission errors on the go non-go task in OCD patients as 
compared to healthy controls [36]. Further, some have argued that OCD is in fact associated 
with reduced behavioural impulsivity, and that the BIS attentional impulsivity (lack of sense 
of control of thoughts) causes an artificial inflation of the total score [37].

In this study, our aim was to comprehensively access all the components of self-reported and 
neurocognitive impulsivity in OCD participants and matched controls and to investigate 
whether they were differentially impaired. Although lack of correlations between self-report 
scales and behavioural tasks of impulsivity have been reported in different contexts, some 
authors suggest that these correlations would be greater if neurocognitive tasks measured 
more general impulsive tendencies (rather than single cognitive abilities) or if self-report 
questionnaire assessed specific processes identified by the neurocognitive tasks. [38] Thus, 
we attempted to address this issue by employing a broad neurocognitive battery assessing 
different aspects of impulsivity. Based on the behavioural addiction model of OCD and 
meta-analytic findings, we predicted that both self-reported and neurocognitive impulsivity 
levels would be significantly elevated in OCD.

2  Material and Methods

2.1  Participants

Seventeen OCD patients and 17 age-, gender-, education-, and IQ-matched controls were 
included in our study. Patients were selected from individuals being treated in the OCD and 
Anxiety Disorders clinic of the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de 
Janeiro (IPUB/UFRJ) and a few local private clinics. Controls have been recruited from 
D’Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR) and IPUB/UFRJ administrative and 
support staff (e.g. cleaners, doorkeepers, and handypersons). The Ethics Committee of the 
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro approved this research protocol (CAAE # 
05089412.2.1001.5263), which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Accordingly, 
written informed consent was obtained from all participants after the procedures involved 
were fully explained.

All research participants were submitted to an initial general assessment performed by a 
trained psychiatrist (IF), which included the Structured Interview for Disorders of Axis I 
(SCID) [39]; the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) [40]; and the Yale-Brown 
Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Scale (YBOCS) [41, 42]. The participants also answered 
the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [43] and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – 
Revised (OCI-R) [44, 45]. Patients’ OCD symptoms in descending order of severity were 
obsessions, neutralization, ordering, washing, checking, and hoarding.

The inclusion criteria comprised being aged between 18 and 65 years, having at least high 
school education, and, for OCD patients, scoring at least 16 on the YBOCS. Controls were 
selected from the IDOR and IPUB/UFRJ administrative and support staff, as long as they 
had a minimum score of 60 on the GAF, indicating satisfactory everyday functioning. 
Exclusion criteria for both groups comprised severe mental illness (e.g. psychosis),

conditions associated with impulsivity/suicidality (such as comorbid borderline or antisocial 
personality disorders), alcohol or other substances use disorders, and the use of 
antipsychotics or benzodiazepines (due to their effects on reaction times). Almost all OCD 
patients were under a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), with the exception of one patient 
taking a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine). One control was on a SRI 
due to major depression that has been fully remitted for more than a year.

Generally, neuropsychological assessments took place when OCD patients were already 
prescribed a SRIs and less anxious. However, they were in different stages of follow-up. For 
instance, many patients who were recruited and tested within the first weeks of treatment 
were still symptomatic and under lower doses of SRIs. Other subjects were under chronic 
SRIs prescribed by their previous clinicians when they reached our clinic. They were not 
necessarily resistant, but required some sort of medication adjustment. Finally, additional 
patients, who were in later stages of treatment and under higher doses of SRIs displayed 
different symptom severities and degrees of therapeutic resistance. That said, our sample can 
be described as heterogeneous in terms of duration of follow up, SRIs doses and treatment 
response, and cannot be characterized as resistant to treatment. For a summary on SRIs and 
doses prescribed, see table 1.

To quantify the effects of SRIs on OCD patients’ cognitive performance, scores were 
attributed to equivalent SRI doses (i.e., zero to no medication; one to 20 mg of fluoxetine, 
paroxetine or citalopram, 50 mg of sertraline, 100 mg of fluvoxamine, or 75 mg of 
clomipramine; two to the double of these doses; three to the triple, and so on) based on the 
minimum dose required to occupy at least 80% of the brain serotonin transporters in the 
striatum [46]. A similar rationale was used to rate escitalopram (1 to 10 mg), and 
venlafaxine (1 to 75 mg) equivalent doses. For a description of this SRI dose quantification 
strategy, see a previous paper by our group [47]. Although there are different approaches to 
calculate equivalent doses of antidepressants (including SRIs) [48], we felt the present one 
to be the closest to the clinical reality in OCD patients, which generally require higher doses 
of SRIs than major depression patients to be optimally treated.

Instruments

2.2.1  Self-reported Impulsivity

2.2.1.1  Barratt Impulsivity Scale: The BIS-11 is the most often used self-report 
instrument to access personality/behavioural construct of impulsiveness worldwide. It 
comprises 30 items scored on a Likert scale (ranging from never=1 point to very 
frequently=4 points). The BIS-11 measures impulsivity on its attentional (e.g. “I don’t “pay 
attention”), motor (e.g. “I do things without thinking”), and non-planning (e.g. “I am more 
interested in the present than the future”) aspects [49]. In this study, we used the validated 
Brazilian Portuguese version of the BIS-11 [50].

2.2.2  Neurocognitive Impulsivity: We employed three different tasks from the Cambridge 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) in order to access risk taking, 
motor and reflection impulsivity [51].

2.2.2.1  Cambridge Gambling Task: The Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) was developed 
to access decision-making and risk-taking behaviour under uncertainty [51]. In this task, the 
examinee attempts to accumulate as many points as possible. For each trial, a computer 
screen exhibits a row with a variable number of ten red and blue boxes (10 in total). The 
participant must choose the box colour (red or blue) they feel contains a yellow token 
underneath. After making this decision, they then gamble a proportion of points on whether 
or not they have made the correct colour choice. By sampling colour and bet choices across 
a range of box ratios, the task decomposes different aspects of decision-making. The 
outcome measures of interest were: overall proportion bet (i.e. mean percentage of points 
gambled), quality of decision-making (the proportion of trials when the logical colour choice 
was made), and risk adjustment (i.e. the extent to which the bet amount varied with the 
likelihood of winning) [52].

After each trial, the subject receives a feedback if he won or lost. The CGT differs from 
other gambling tasks by distinguish risk-taking from impulsivity as the participant who 
wants to make a risky bet must wait patiently for it to appear. We have compared three key 
outputs of the CGT between OCD and controls, namely: overall proportion bet (i.e. mean 
percentage of points gambled), quality of decision making [i.e. the fraction of time that the 
participant chose the most likely outcome (e.g. betting on red when seven red squares and 
three blue squares are displayed on the screen)], and risk adjustment (i.e. the extent to which 
the bet amount varies with the likelihood of winning) [52].

2.2.2.2  Stop Signal Task: The SST was employed to assess motor impulsivity [51]. 
Performance in the Stop Signal Task (SST) is modelled as a horse race between a “go 
process”, triggered by the presentation of the “go” stimulus (e.g. an arrow pointing to the left 
or right), and a “stop process”, triggered by the presentation of the stop signal (in our case, 
an auditory tone) [53]. When the stop process finishes before the go process, the response is 
inhibited; when the go processes finishes before the stop process, the response is emitted 
[53].

The SST is divided in two parts. In the first one, involving 16 practice trials, there is an 
arrow pointing either to the left or to the right and the subject must press a correspondent 
button according to the direction of the arrow. In the second part, comprising of five blocks 
of 64 trials with 16 stop trials per block, the subject must refrain from pressing any button if 
he or she hears an auditory stimulus after the visual one. [51] The outcome measure from the 
task was the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), which is an estimate of the time taken by an 
individual’s brain to suppress a response that would normally be made [53].

2.2.2.3  Information Sampling Task: The IST was employed to assess reflection 
impulsivity. It comprises the exhibition of a 5 X 5 matrix of grey boxes hiding a random 
distribution of blue or yellow squares; these two colours are also displayed at the bottom of a 
computer screen [51]. The participants must touch a grey box, which then revels its hidden 
colour. Participants should choose the colour that predominates on that specific trial at the 
bottom of the computer screen [54]. To this end, the participant is allowed to touch and 
reveal as many boxes as he or she wants to make his or her decision [54]. The boxes that

were opened by the participants remained visible during the whole duration of the trial to 
minimize the demands on working memory.

The IST comprises two conditions, one fixed and one decreasing win (FW and DW, 
respectively). While in the FW the participant is awarded 100 points for a correct colour 
decision regardless of the number of boxes opened, the number of available points decreased 
by 10 with every box opened in the DW condition. Thus, in the DW, there is a points’ cost 
for higher levels of information sampling [54]. The outcome measures of interest were the 
mean number of boxes opened for each of the two task conditions (FW and DW) [55].

2.3  Statistical Analysis—All analyses were conducted with the Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for Mac (Chicago, SPSS Inc.). Groups (OCD patients 
and controls) had their sociodemographic and clinical features compared by means of 
Student’s t or Mann-Whitney tests (according to the normality of distribution) and Chi-
square tests. As the IST had two conditions a general linear model repeated measures with 
condition (fixed vs. decreasing) as within-subjects factor and diagnostic status (OCD vs. 
controls) as between-subjects factor was performed using the IST outcome. Performances on 
the SST and CGT were also compared with of Student’s t or Mann-Whitney tests. The 
adopted level of significance was 0.05 uncorrected. The study had an 80% power to detect 
an effect size of Cohen's d = 1.0 or higher at p<0.05 uncorrected given the present sample 
size (n=17 in each group).

3  Results

The socio-demographic and clinical features of OCD patients and controls are described in 
table 2. The sample was age-, gender-, education-, and IQ-matched and all OCD patients 
were symptomatic, with Y-BOCS mean total score of 24.05. As expected, the OCD group 
had higher scores in the OCI-R and BDI when compared to controls. Regarding self-
reported impulsivity, we found that OCD patients had statistically significant higher scores 
in the BIS Attention and Total subscale.

Since BIS attention was normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test= .95; df-34; p=. 19), an 
exploratory linear regression model was performed to investigate which factors, other than 
diagnostic group, were able to predict BIS attention scores. Accordingly, total OCI-R and 
the BDI scores were entered in the model for differing significantly between the OCD and 
controls groups. Eventually, a model that included OCI-R (ß= .54; p= .01), but not BDI 
scores (ß= .28; p= .15) or diagnostic status (ß= -.11; p= .58), was found to predict BIS 
attention scores (Overall model fit was R2 = 0.46).

Comparisons between OCD and controls on neurocognitive tests are portrayed in table 3. No 
significant group differences in the performance of CGT, SST and IST by OCD and controls 
were found. In terms of the IST, there was the expected significant effect of condition for 
mean number of box opened [Wilks’ Lambda=.39, F (1, 32)=49.56; p<.0001). However, no 
interaction was found between the later variable and participants’ diagnostic status, i.e. OCD 
or controls [Wilks’ Lambda=.99, F (1,32)=.13, p=.71)]. Relationships between test 
performance and both the BDI and the SRI scores in the OCD group are depicted in Table 4.

Although correlations were found between the mean number of box opened in the 
decreasing winning condition and BDI scores (r=.48, p=0.05), no significant correlations 
between performance in neurocognitive tests and SRI doses was noted.

4  Discussion

In this study, we have performed a comprehensive assessment of impulsivity in OCD 
patients, both in terms of their self-reported (attentional, motor and non-planning 
impulsivity) and neurocognitive (reward/risk-taking, motor and reflection impulsivity) 
aspects, which were then compared to those of age-, gender, education, and IQ matched 
controls. Despite predicting that adult OCD patients would present increased levels of 
impulsivity [11], we found only partial support for this hypothesis. In fact, OCD patients 
exhibited significant heightened impulsivity that was restricted to the self-reported 
(particularly attentional) domain and was largely determined by the severity of OCD 
symptoms. Thus, our findings suggest that, despite describing themselves as impulsive, adult 
OCD patients do not show objective neurocognitive evidence of such abnormalities.

While the finding of increased BIS scores seems intuitive on the basis of phenomenological 
descriptions of OCD patients [who frequently report not being “in control” despite any 
objective evidence [56]], the fact that increased self-reported impulsivity in our OCD sample 
could be credited mostly to greater attentional impulsivity has already been described in 
previous studies with other OCD samples [16, 19–21]. Actually, it is interesting that, 
similarly to OCD obsessions (described as recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or 
images experienced as intrusive and unwanted in DSM-5) [57], increased attentional 
impulsivity has been related to the inability of “deleting no-longer-relevant information” 
from working memory [58].

Dissociation between self-reported and neurocognitive impulsivity in our OCD sample 
dovetails with studies showing that self-report and laboratory behavioral assessments of 
impulsivity are often unrelated to each other [38, 59]. We can only speculate on the reasons 
for this dissociation within our sample. Firstly, as previously suggested, self-report 
instruments and neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity may actually measure different 
constructs [38] regardless of the nature of the population under study. Secondly, in light of 
previous studies showing increased rates of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) symptoms in OCD patients [60], and several findings showing etiological and 
pathophysiological links between the two conditions [61], longitudinal studies could 
investigate whether increased self-reported impulsivity in OCD adults can be ascribed to 
previous ADHD symptoms (even subsyndromal) or to an early neurocognitive impulsivity 
that vanishes later due to the progressive maturation of fronto-subcortical circuits. [62]

Our negative findings regarding decision-making are consistent with a substantial part of the 
literature. For instance, previous studies with the CGT did not find evidence of an impaired 
CGT performance in OCD [22, 29, 63, 64]. In fact, several studies that reported impaired 
“decision-making” in OCD used the Iowa Gambling Task [65–67], which has been criticized 
for being unable to isolate risk preference from working memory abilities due to its 
emphasis on learning that the task demands [54]. Thus, although OCD patients may

occasionally show “risky” symptoms under conditions of uncertainty (such as avoiding 
drinking water as a way of reducing urinary elimination because of the fear of contamination 
in toilets [68]), we were unable to identify neurocognitive evidence of increased risk taking 
under uncertainty.

Contrary to expectation, we did not find differences in the SST performance between OCD 
and controls. Although studies report impaired motor response inhibition in OCD samples 
[17, 18, 29, 69], a finding confirmed by one meta-analysis [24], SST performance in OCD is 
still a controversial matter [26]. It is tempting to speculate that differences between studies 
may depend on the particular OC symptom domains; i.e. some domains may be more 
strongly associated with this deficit than others. For example, predominance of overt (motor) 
vs. covert (mental) ritualistic behaviors may be important. Interestingly, our patients’ scores 
on cognitive (obsessing and neutralization) symptoms were higher than on behavioral 
symptoms (checking and washing). Although we are not aware of specific instruments 
available to measure overt vs. covert rituals in a reliable manner, future studies could 
consider comparing SST performance between OCD subjects with predominant motor vs. 
mental rituals.

Finally, a lack of group differences in the number of boxes opened for the IST confirms 
previous findings on this CANTAB task in OCD [29]. Although in the present study we 
were more interested in testing impulsive responses in the IST, lack of any difference 
between OCD and controls on the IST is theoretically surprising, as the IST has also been 
argued by some to measure intolerance of uncertainty (the “incapacity to endure the aversive 
response triggered by the perceived absence of salient, key, or sufficient information”) [70], 
a construct that had been proposed to be shared by OCD and other related disorders, 
including generalized anxiety disorder [71]. In this regard, a recent study found increased 
decision thresholds on a modified reflection-impulsivity task in adolescent OCD [30]. This 
would be more in keeping with intolerance of uncertainty and we suspect that the latter task, 
which also uses computational modeling, may be more behaviorally sensitive to cognitive 
changes in OCD [30].

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, it included few participants. Thus, confirmation of 
its negative findings using a larger sample is advisable. In fact, the study was only powered 
to detect group differences of large effect sizes; and might have missed subtler group 
differences (i.e. those with small-medium effect sizes). Similarly, also due to the sample 
size, no correction for multiple comparisons was performed. Further, despite being 
substantially symptomatic [mean YBOCS = 24.05 (5.43)], most patients were receiving 
SRIs, which could theoretically affect at least some aspects of cognition. Nevertheless, no 
correlation between SRIs doses and cognition was found, suggesting that our results are not 
accounted by this possibility. Accordingly, other studies have shown that both motor [72] 
and reward [73] impulsivities are not reliably impacted by SRIs. However, as SRIs may 
interfere with reflection impulsivity [74], we feel that a follow up study assessing drug free 
patients both before and after pharmacotherapy would be the best way to investigate the 
impact of SRI on the neurocognition of OCD patients.

Some relevant phenotypic features, such as age at OCD onset and comorbidity profile (e.g. 
current or past ADHD), were not assessed in our sample. Bearing in mind theories (such as 
the behavioral addiction model of OCD) suggesting that increased impulsivity may be 
restricted to patients with longer duration of illness [12], it would have been interesting to 
clarify whether our sample was characterized by recent onset OCD. Although we are unable 
to rule out this possibility, it seems unlikely. Our sample included mostly adult patients 
[mean age at assessment = 35.88 (13.13) years]. As OCD has been suggested to start in child 
and adolescent years in up to 80% of cases [75], it is reasonable to speculate that our 
patients had a long history of OCD. Lastly, we did not rule out a history of some mental 
disorders (e.g. major depression) in the control sample, a methodological aspect that differs 
from some previous cognitive studies, which may have diminished the ability to detect 
deficits in patients. Despite these methodological caveats, our findings suggest that the 
impulsivity features reported in OCD subjects are more subjective (rather than objective) 
and largely determined by severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
