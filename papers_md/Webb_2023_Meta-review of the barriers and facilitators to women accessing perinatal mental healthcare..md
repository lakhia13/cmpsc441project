ABSTRACT
Perinatal mental health (PMH) problems are common and 
can have an adverse impact on women and their families. 
However, research suggests that a substantial proportion 
of women with PMH problems do not access care.
Objectives  To synthesise the results from previous 
systematic reviews of barriers and facilitators to women to 
seeking help, accessing help, and engaging in PMH care, 
and to suggest recommendations for clinical practice and 
policy.
Design  A meta- review of systematic reviews.
Review methods  Seven databases were searched and 
reviewed using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta Analyses search strategy. Studies 
that focused on the views of women seeking help and 
accessing PMH care were included. Data were analysed 
using thematic synthesis. Assessing the Methodological 
Quality of Systematic Reviews- 2 was used to assess 
review methodology. To improve validity of results, a 
qualitative sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess 
whether themes remained consistent across all reviews, 
regardless of their quality rating.
Results  A total of 32 reviews were included. A wide range 
of barriers and facilitators to women accessing PMH care 
were identified. These mapped across a multilevel model 
of influential factors (individual, healthcare professional, 
interpersonal, organisational, political and societal) 
and across the care pathway (from decision to consult 
to receiving care). Evidence- based recommendations 
to support the design and delivery of PMH care were 
produced based on identified barriers and facilitators.
Conclusion  The identified barriers and facilitators point 
to a complex interplay of many factors, highlighting the 
need for an international effort to increase awareness of 
PMH problems, reduce mental health stigma, and provide 
woman- centred, flexible care, delivered by well trained 
and culturally sensitive primary care, maternity, and 
psychiatric health professionals.

INTRODUCTION
Perinatal  mental  health  (PMH)  problems 
commonly  consist  of  anxiety  disorders, 
depression, post- traumatic stress disorder and 
stress- related  conditions  such  as  adjustment 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This meta- review synthesised a large amount of in-

formation from 32 systematic reviews.

 ⇒ Title  and  abstracts  and  full  texts  were  double 

screened by two reviewers.

 ⇒ Only  reviews  published  in  academic  journals  and 

written in English language were included.

 ⇒ Only 10% of studies had duplicate data extraction.

disorder. They can also include more severe 
difficulties such as postpartum psychosis, and 
many PMH problems are comorbid.1 2
PMH  problems  can  adversely 

impact 
women  and  their  families.  They  are  associ-
ated with obstetric physical health complica-
tions, such as increased risk of pre- eclampsia, 
antepartum  and  postpartum  haemorrhage, 
placental abruption, stillbirth,3–5 and preterm 
birth.6  7  Furthermore,  suicide  is  a  leading 
cause  of  death  during  the  perinatal  period 
in  higher- income  countries,  accounting  for 
5%–20%  of  maternal  deaths.2  8  9  Perinatal 
suicide  accounts  for  between  0.655%  and 
3.55%  of  pregnancy- related  deaths  in  lower- 
middle- income countries (LMICs).10 Research 
has also found PMH problems are associated 
with  a  child’s  cognitive,  language11–14  and 
behavioural  development.13  15  16  PMH  prob-
lems may also mean a woman’s child is at an 
increased  risk  of  developing  mental  health 
themselves.17–19  Furthermore, 
difficulties 
PMH problems can impact on a woman’s rela-
tionships with her partner, such as by a decline 
in relationship satisfaction,20 increased strain 
on  the  couple  relationship21  22  and  relation-
ship  breakdown.23  There  is  also  a  large  cost 
to society and healthcare services, with PMH 
problems costing the UK approximately £8.1 
billion every year.24

Evidence- based  PMH  care  can  reduce 
the  negative  impacts  on  women  and  their

families.  For  example,  cognitive–behavioural  therapy,25 
psychological  therapies26  and  certain  antidepressant 
medications27 have been shown to be effective in reducing 
PMH symptoms.

Globally,  evidence- based  guidelines  exist  for  PMH 
care.  The  WHO  Millennium  Development  Goal  5  is  to 
improve  maternal  health,28  and  states  that  a  mental 
health component should be incorporated as an integral 
part of maternal health policies, plans and activities in all 
countries.29  However,  research  suggests  access  to  PMH 
care  is  variable30–33  with  only  30%–50%  of  women  with 
PMH problems identified, and less than 10% referred to 
specialist  care.34–36  This  variable  access  could  be  due  to 
multiple  reasons,  such  as  difficulties  with  implementing 
PMH services,37 or due to barriers experienced by women.
Multiple  systematic  reviews  have  explored  barriers  and 
facilitators  to  women  accessing  PMH  care.  Each  system-
atic review varies slightly in relation to its aim and methods 
making it hard to extract the information needed to design 
PMH services in a more accessible way. A systematic review 
of systematic reviews, or a meta- review, is arguably the most 
suitable way to synthesise results by combining results from 
multiple reviews into a single body of evidence. This allows for 
comparison of results from multiple reviews. A meta- review 
would  make  it  easier  for  healthcare  providers  and  policy- 
makers to access the information and use it to inform their 
decisions.38  39  Therefore,  the  primary  aim  of  this  research 
is  to  determine  the  key  barriers  and  facilitators  to  women 
deciding to seek help, access help and engage in PMH care 
using a meta- review.

METHOD
The protocol for this review has been registered on PROS-
PERO  (CRD42020193107)  (see  online  supplemental 
appendix 1).

Patient and public involvement
This project was developed with patient and public involve-
ment  representatives  from  the  NCT  in  England,  and  the 
Maternal Mental Health Change Agents, a group of women 
with lived experience of PMH problems in Scotland.

Data sources and searches
Searches  were  carried  out  by  NR  in  CINAHL  (1982–
present);  Embase  (1974–present);  Medline  (1946–
present); PsycINFO (1806–present), Cochrane, SCOPUS 
and  Turning  Research  into  Practice  Medical  Database. 
Searches were completed on 4 August 2021 and forward 
and backward searches were completed by 8 September 
2021.  See  online  supplemental  appendices  2  and  3  for 
full search syntax and results.

supplemental  appendix  4  for  full  inclusion  criteria.  Search 
results  were  imported  into  EndNote  and  duplicates  and 
papers not meeting initial inclusion criteria (foetal distress, 
oxidative  stress  and  non- English  papers  due  to  translation 
times and costs) were removed by NR. The remaining studies 
were  imported  into  Eppi- Reviewer  V.4,  where  results  were 
double screened by title and abstract by two people (RW and 
GC). Following this, full- text screening was carried out by two 
people (RW and GC).

Data collection process and data items
Data extraction was carried out using Microsoft Excel by 
RW. Double coding of extracted data was carried out for a 
proportion of included reviews (n=3, 10%) by GC.

Critical appraisal of reviews
Methodology  sections  of  included  systematic  reviews  were 
appraised  using  the  Assessing  the  Methodological  Quality 
of  Systematic  Reviews- 2.41  A  decision  was  made  to  include 
reviews where confidence in results was evaluated as low and 
critically low because these reviews focused more on margin-
alised women, such as refugees, migrants, women with a low 
income  and  women  living  in  LMICs,  to  ensure  the  experi-
ences  of  these  seldom- heard  women  were  captured.  To 
improve the validity of results, a qualitative sensitivity analysis 
was carried out to assess whether themes remained consistent 
across all reviews, regardless of their quality rating (see online 
supplemental appendices 5–8).

Synthesis of results
Results  were  analysed  by  RW  using  a  thematic  synthesis42 
in NVivo and Microsoft Excel. Themes were mapped onto 
a  multilevel  framework  adapted  from  Ferlie  and  Shortell’s 
Levels of Change framework (individual level, group/team 
level,  organisational  level  and  larger  system/environment 
level)43 and used in a previous systematic review on barriers 
and  facilitators  to  implementing  PMH  care,  carried  out  by 
the  review  authors.37  The  levels  identified  in  the  previous 
review  reflect  the  reviewed  literature  and  the  complexities 
of the health services and are as follows: individual, health 
professional  (HP),  interpersonal,  organisational,  political 
and societal. These will be described in more detail below. 
The  mapping  of  descriptive  themes  was  developed  deduc-
tively from the initial theoretical framework and then induc-
tively  revised  as  new  themes  emerged.  The  mapping  of 
descriptive themes was discussed by all review authors before 
being finalised. Differences of opinion were resolved through 
discussion. Recommendations were developed for policy and 
practice based on the most cited themes. For a more detailed 
methodology, please see online supplemental appendix 5.

Study selection
Reviews  were  included  if  they  used  a  Preferred  Reporting 
Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta  Analyses40  search 
strategy  and  focused  on  the  views  of  women  seeking  help 
and  accessing  care  for  perinatal  mental  illness.  See  online 

RESULTS
Review selection and review characteristics
Screening  identified  32  reviews  to  be  included  in  the 
meta- review  (see  figure  1).  See  online  supplemental 
appendices 9 and 10 for review characteristics.

Risk of bias within studies
Most  reviews  were  evaluated  as  having  low  (n=14)  or 
critically  low  (n=5)  confidence  with  their  results.  The 
remainder had moderate (n=8) or high (n=5) confidence 
(see online supplemental appendix 11).

Synthesis of results
Determining the barriers and facilitators to women help-seeking 
and accessing PMH care
A total of six overarching themes, mapped onto a multi-
level framework,43 made up of 62 subthemes were iden-
tified  (see  online  supplemental  appendix  12).  The 
multilevel framework is an extension of Ferlie and Short-
ell’s Levels of Change framework43 with six levels, instead 
of four. The first level is the individual level, which reflects 
factors related to the person themselves. The second level 
is HP, which reflects factors related to the HP. Interper-
sonal refers to the relationship between women and HPs, 
this is an extension of Ferlie and Shortell’s work and was 
included because this theme was represented in the liter-
ature.37  The  next  theme  is  organisational,  which  relates 
to how the organisation is run, and the type of care the 
organisation  delivers.  The  literature  provided  multiple 
examples of how women wanted their care designed. As 
the organisation is in charge of designing and providing 
care,  ideal  care  was  mapped  as  a  subtheme  under  this 
theme.  The  political  level  relates  to  the  policies  and 
governing  that  may  impact  on  women  and  healthcare. 
The societal level relates to larger societal factors, such as 
stigma. It is important to note that these levels do not exist 
in isolation but often impact one another, for example, a 

lack  of  political  funding  and  policy  will  have  a  negative 
impact on how an organisation is run, staff burn- out and 
thus the care delivered to women.

Each level of the mult- level framework (figure 2) maps 
on  to  at  least  one  part  of  the  care  pathway  (figure  3). 
Each  level  of  the  multilevel  framework  will  be  outlined 
below, and within each level, the most cited barriers and 
facilitators will be presented following the chronology of 
the care pathway outlined in figure 3. Recommendations 
for practice and policy can be found in table 1. It should 
be noted that the review draws on international evidence, 
and  not  all  the  factors  identified  will  exist  to  the  same 
extent in all places.

Individual-level factors
Individual- level factors were identified by 25 reviews.

Deciding to consult
Barriers that prevented women from deciding to consult 
included, not understanding the role of HPs (n=6), and 
not knowing what perinatal mental illness is (n=14):

I  don’t  know  what  postnatal  depression  is—how 
you’re  supposed  to  feel,  look,  or  whatever.  I  don’t 
know. I have no idea … what exactly is postnatal de-
pression? What are you supposed to be doing, saying, 
or whatever? I don’t know. (44, p.e694)

Not  knowing  what  perinatal  mental  illness  is  led  to 
some  women  believing  their  symptoms  were  a  normal 
part of motherhood (n=8), or led to women attributing

Figure 3  Barriers and facilitators mapped onto the MATRIx care pathway. Note: Some parts of the pathway are redundant 
in healthcare systems where the woman can contact mental health services directly (eg, France or via Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies services in the UK). Further, the process is not always linear women might jump over certain stages.

their symptoms to external causes (eg, job loss; n=8), or 
physical causes such as hormones (n=9):

I’m  thinking  about  killing  myself.”  (44,  p.e694) 
[Recognising something is wrong]

I thought it was just lack of sleep and this heavy cold. 
I thought that after a good night’s sleep it would get 
better, and I would be able to manage (44, p.e696)

Other barriers at this stage of the care pathway included 
dealing with symptoms by ignoring them (n=6), or mini-
mising them (n=12); not knowing where to go in order to 
seek help (n=7); and the fear of being seen as a bad mum 
or fear of social services involvement (n=7).

Facilitators to deciding to consult was recognising that 
something was wrong (n=9) and having supportive family 
and friends (n=5):

That’s  when  I  thought,  you  know:  “Something 
is  really  wrong  here,  I  need  to  go  to  the  doctors  if 

It was sort of my partner saying to me: “Right, if you 
don’t  go,  I’m  basically  making  you  an  appointment 
… You can’t just keep feeling like this.” (44, p.e694) 
[Supportive family and friends]

Deciding to disclose
One  barrier  at  this  stage  of  the  care  pathway  was  not 
understanding the HP’s role, perceiving them as agents 
of social control (n=4):

‘I  don’t  really  know  what  their  job  is.  Nobody  gave 
me,  like,  the  parameters  of  this  role  of  the  health 
visitor  [maternal  and  child  health  nurse]….’  (44, 
p.e695)

Webb R, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e066703. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066703Open access

Linked  to  this  was  the  fear  of  social  services  involve-
ment and the removal of their child (n=7), as well as fears 
of being judged to be a bad mum (n=8):

I even went in at 3 months and I talked to a health 
nurse,  and  I  just  lied  through  my  teeth  because  I 
thought, what are they going to do if they find out I 
can’t be a good mom? (45, p.732–733)

Access to care, provision of optimal care and women’s experiences 
of care
These stages of the care pathway were mainly influenced 
by the characteristics of HPs. For example, HPs who were 
trustworthy, responsive, non- judgemental, understanding, 
caring, interested, warm, empathetic and positive (n=12) 
were facilitators. On the other hand, unhelpful or unin-
terested staff were barriers (n=2).

Access to care
The most cited barrier at this stage of the care pathway 
was logistical reasons (n=13) such as travel costs, lack of 
childcare and timing of services.

HP-related factors
HP- level factors were reported by 18 reviews.

First contact with HPs
HPs not recognising women’s help- seeking or symptoms 
(n=4),  and  being  dismissive  or  normalising  women’s 
symptoms  (n=8)  were  barriers  at  this  early  stage  in  the 
care pathway:

Interpersonal factors
Interpersonal- level factors were identified by 14 reviews.

Deciding to consult, deciding to disclose and women’s experience 
of care
The  development  of  a  strong  and  trusting  relationship 
with  a  HP  (n=10)  was  a  facilitator  to  women  at  each  of 
these stages of the care pathway:

She’s a supplement to my own mother. She’s easy to 
talk to. I depend on her. She’s not just there to take 
care of the baby but for the mothers too. She started 
a group for us new mothers. (46, p.79)

I did ask for support, but I didn’t really get any. And 
the  health  visitor’s  response—“Well  you  seem  like 
you’re  doing  all  right”—which  kind  of  closes  it  off, 
doesn’t it (44, p.e696)

First contact with HPs, assessment and provision of optimal care
Language difficulties (n=6) and a lack of shared decision- 
making  (n=6)  were  barriers  at  these  stages  of  the  care 
pathway:

Linked to this, HPs appearing to not have enough time 

to address women’s concerns was also a barrier

The health visitor said something like: “You know, in 
this community we have to look after a thousand and 
something babies.” And that instilled in me the feel-
ing,  like:  “Oh,  they  are  very  busy  these  people,  and 
I don’t have to be bothering them all the time (44, 
p.e696)

When the midwife visits, I can only speak the sentenc-
es about requesting a translator … They said that this 
kind of service is limited … that is what is difficult be-
ing Chinese—language barrier. (47, p.6) [Language 
difficulties]

…  it  would  have  been  good  I  think  to  have  been 
listened to about the side effects. I was on a very high 
dose of Olanzapine [sic] and it just knocks you out … 
(48, p.754) [Shared decision making]

Assessment/screening
Assessment being carried out in a formulaic tick- box way, 
or not being carried out at all (n=3) was the most cited 
barrier.

Deciding to disclose
The most reported barrier at this stage of the care pathway 
was  HPs  appearing  to  not  have  enough  time  (n=4)  or 
HPs being dismissive or normalising women’s symptoms 
(n=4).

Referral
Women’s perception of HPs knowledge of referral path-
ways/other  services  (n=3)  and  HPs  not  recognising 
women’s  help- seeking  or  symptoms  (n=2)  were  barriers 
to referral:

I purposely circled the things ’cos I’m struggling … 
the  health  visitor  didn’t  get  back  to  me,  which  I’m 
really disappointed about. (44, p.e696)

Organisational factors
Organisational- level factors were identified by 21 reviews.

Screening/assessment
The most cited barriers to screening/assessment was the 
wording or contents of the tool (n=2), or if the tool was 
delivered in a tick- box way (n=6).

There’s  so  much  more  that  you  want  to  say,  rath-
er  than  just  answering  quite  closed  questions.  (44, 
p.e695)

Some women found screening tools particularly prob-
lematic if the tool was not in her first language, indicating 
that  cultural  factors  can  overlap  with  organisational 
factors.  For  example,  one  review  reported  that  certain 
questions  may  not  elicit  true  feelings  from  Vietnamese 
women living in the UK because of the shame of admit-
ting to these.44 Further, question Q10 on the EPDS45 (‘the 
thought of harming myself has occurred to me’) was seen 
as problematic to Arabic, Vietnamese and black Caribbean

mothers44 living in the UK or USA, highlighting the need 
for culturally sensitive and relevant assessment tools.

Access to care
Practical  characteristics  (n=5)  of  the  organisation  and 
services offered, such as a lack of childcare facilities, hard 
to  reach  locations  and  timing  of  appointments  were  a 
barrier to access:

You have to have someone to look after your baby so 
who  am  I  going  to  get  to  look  after  [my  baby]  (44, 
p.e695)

Other barriers at this stage of the care pathway included, 
a lack of services or overstretched services (n=7), a lack of 
collaboration across services (n=3) and lack of continuity 
of care (n=2):

You shouldn’t have to press that danger button of ‘I'm 
gonna self- harm’ or ‘I'm gonna hurt my children’ for 
someone to help you. (48, p.756) [Lack of services]

My  GP  [general  practitioner/family  doctor]  says  go 
the HV [health visitor] and HV says go to GP. I don’t 
know what to do, I need help, don’t know where to 
go, or who to turn to (47, p.5) [Lack of collaboration 
across services]

Every  time  I  went  to  see  the  midwife,  or…,  I  always 
had somebody different, and I don’t want to tell 10 
people  my  story.  (48,  p.752)  [Lack  of  continuity  of 
care]

Women reported wanting care that gave them an oppor-
tunity  to  talk  to  someone  and  discuss  their  emotional 
difficulties  (n=8);  some  women  wanted  this  opportu-
nity  within  a  peer  support  or  group  setting  (n=12)  and 
reported  that  an  appropriate  peer  group  could  provide 
them  with  validation  for  their  feelings  (n=3).  Care  also 
needed  to  be  individualised  (n=10),  and  be  culturally 
sensitive (n=8):

In Pakistan we only saw lady professionals, but here 
you don’t have a choice, you have to see the men as 
well  otherwise  you  don’t  get  to  see  a  doctor…  (51, 
p.10)

Women also appreciated care that provided them with 
information  about  PMH  problems  (n=5).  Further,  the 
location of the care needs to be easy to reach or carried 
out in women’s homes (n=7), and women should not be 
discharged too early from these services (n=4).

Political factors
Political factors were defined as factors that governmental 
agencies  have  influence  over  (eg,  poverty,  immigration, 
housing). Eight women identified these factors.

Because  when  you’re  legal  you  can  take  the  child 
to  the  day- care  and  look  for  a  job…  if  you  don’t 
work,  it’s  like  you’re  dead,  being  alive…  (52,  p.13) 
[Immigration status]

…if she has no money, how is she going to find help 
[with PPD]? (53, p.12) [Economic status]

This is due to the costs of healthcare and women’s fear 
of  being  deported  if  they  access  help.  Economic  status 
was often exacerbated by immigration status with women 
reporting not being able to get health insurance due to 
their immigration status (n=4).

Women’s experience of care
Economic  status  also  impacted  women’s  experience  of 
care in terms of women not being able to feel any sense 
of well- being when they were unable to fulfil basic needs 
such as ‘…Not having enough money to make ends meet…’ (54, 
p.12) (n=4).

Societal factors
Societal  factors  were  identified  in  24  reviews.  The  main 
societal factors that influenced a woman’s journey along 
the  care  pathway  were  culture,  societies’  norms  of  what 
a  ‘good  mum’  should  look  like  (maternal  norms)  and 
stigma.  All  these  factors  intertwine  and  influence  one 
another.  There  was  only  one  review  that  only  included 
studies  from  LMICs,46  therefore,  these  results  mainly 
refer to western cultures.

Deciding to consult and deciding to disclose
Stigma (n=21) and the maternal norm for women to show 
they are strong, that they can cope and be a good mother 
(n=18), prevented women from deciding to consult, and 
deciding to disclose:

Mothers  tend  to  think  they  should  always  be  there. 
And  mothers  are  supposed  to  be  always  rock  solid, 
aren't they? Everyone assumes that. (56, p.568)

Adherence to cultural traditions (n=16) in women who 
had  moved  to  Western  countries,  impacted  their  deci-
sion  to  consult  and  disclose.  Two  reviews  reported  that 
Hispanic  women  living  in  the  USA  felt  they  needed  to 
remain  strong  (n=2),  feeling  they  needed  to  show  that 
they  could  cope,  and  that  stigma  prevented  them  from 
seeking  help;  they  did  not  want  to  be  seen  as  ‘crazy’  or 
‘loco’ (57, p.97).

Four  reviews  found  that  South  Asian  women  living  in 
the  UK  did  not  consult  or  disclose  for  similar  cultural 
reasons, for example, ‘for fear of an inability to perform their 
role as a woman and a mother’ (58, p. 325), perceiving symp-
toms in religious terms ‘All illness is coming from God’ (44, 
p.e649), and stigma:

Deciding to consult and access to care
Immigration  status  (n=4)  and  economic  status  (n=8) 
influenced  women’s  decision  to  consult  and  access  to 
care:

There  is  a  huge  stigma  of  being  mentally  ill  in  the 
public, but for us Asians there is a double disadvan-
tage.  I  really  fear  that  work  will  find  out.’  Pakistani 
woman living in the UK (47, p.5)

or USA were also deterred from deciding to consult and 
disclose because of the expectation of women to be strong 
and be able to cope (n=4).

Access to care, provision of optimal care and women’s experience 
of care
Women’s cultural backgrounds highlighted the need for 
culturally  sensitive  care.  The  lack  of  this  care  was  as  a 
barrier to access, provision of optimal care and women’s 
experiences  of  care  (n=8).  Two  reviews  explained  how 
Hispanic  women  living  in  the  USA  felt  that  language 
barriers,  cultural  insensitivity,  and  financial  difficulties 
were a barrier to them accessing care.47 48 Further, Jorda-
nian  women  (living  in  Australia)  spoke  of  being  torn 
between their own cultural practices and Western health 
advice, having HPs putting pressure demands on them to 
change their beliefs and behaviours.47 For women living 
in  sub- Saharan  Africa,  the  cultural  tradition  of  confine-
ment after birth meant women felt unable to leave their 
house for fear of being shamed. This was further exacer-
bated by the attribution of postnatal ill health to inade-
quate adherence to tradition.46

DISCUSSION
This meta- review identified a wide range of barriers and 
facilitators to women accessing PMH care, that were influ-
ential  at  different  levels  (figure  2)  and  across  different 
stages of the care pathway (figure 3).

Previous  research  has  identified  multiple  factors  that 
act as barriers to women seeking and accessing help for 
PMH  problems.  The  factors  include  women  not  recog-
nising  the  need  to  seek  help,49–53  the  need  for  HPs  to 
receive training on perinatal mental illness and cultural 
sensitivity,44  49  54–60  continuity  of  care49  51  56–59  61  62  and 
stigma.47–49  53  55  56  60  61  63  64  Our  findings  are  in  line  with 
these previous studies and adds to the body of evidence 
by  identifying  barriers  and  facilitators  to  PMH  care, 
across  the  globe  and  presenting  them  on  a  multilevel 
model, and at different stages of the care pathway. This 
provides  opportunities  for  HPs,  service  managers  and 
policy- makers to identify barriers and facilitators that are 
most relevant to their context. The mapping of barriers 
and  facilitators  in  this  way,  has  also  led  to  the  develop-
ment of evidence- based recommendations for design and 
delivery of PMH care.

Recommendations for PMH care
The results from this meta- review can be used to inform 
healthcare  providers  and  policy- makers  on  the  optimal 
characteristics  of  PMH  care  and  are  summarised  in 
table 1. This meta- review showed a complex interplay of 
multilevel  factors  that  influence  women’s  help- seeking 
and  access  to  PMH  care.  Thus,  recommendations  for 
policy and practice also relate to both international- level 
guidelines,  and  guidelines  for  national  and  individual- 
level care. International- level guidelines should facilitate 

Open access

more  personalised  care  and  should  feed  into  national 
guidelines and be adopted where appropriate.

Societal  factors  such  as  stigma,  maternal  norms 
and  culture  play  a  large  role  in  women  accessing  care. 
Research  suggests  that  public  mental  health  campaigns 
can increase knowledge about mental illness and improve 
attitudes  about  people  with  mental  illness.65  Therefore, 
increasing  women’s,  families’,  those  who  have  regular 
contact  with  women  in  the  perinatal  period,  and  the 
public’s  mental  health  literacy,  could  be  carried  out  on 
an international level. This could be done through public 
health  campaigns,  and  education  within  the  commu-
nity,  such  as  antenatal  education,  and  at  healthcare 
appointments.

Maternal  norms  identified  in  this  meta- review  related 
to  women  believing  that  they  needed  to  be  strong  and 
show  they  could  cope.  There  may  be  some  potential  to 
change societal beliefs around maternal norms through 
increasing societal expectations about fathers’ role in the 
family through more equal parental leave. For example, 
in  countries  where  parental  leave  is  more  equal  (eg, 
Finland),  the  uptake  of  paid  paternity  leave  is  higher.66 
Changing  society’s  maternal  norms  could  also  be  done 
by  increasing  women’s  equality.  Research  suggests  that 
stereotypes of what a mother or a woman should look like 
are beginning to change in countries where women have 
gained more participation in the labour force67 and have 
the right to access contraception and abortion.68 However, 
research is needed to corroborate these findings.

At the political level, immigration and economic status, 
and  healthcare  costs  were  barriers  to  women  accessing 
healthcare.  The  results  from  this  meta- review  show  how 
race  and  gender  interact  to  influence  women’s  expe-
riences  of  the  healthcare  system  (intersectionality).69 
White women living within their country of birth who try 
to access PMH care are faced with barriers (eg, no child-
care  support),  but  women  of  colour,  migrant  women, 
or  migrant  women  of  colour  are  faced  with  additional 
barriers  (eg,  language  barriers,  structural/systematic 
discrimination).  This  finding  is  supported  by  research 
in  general  healthcare  that  has  found  ethnic  minority 
and  migrant  women  are  disproportionately  affected  by 
existing barriers to accessing healthcare.70 As found in this 
meta- review, these barriers include language and commu-
nication barriers, stigma, the cost of healthcare71 and the 
inability  to  access  culturally  appropriate  services.72  This 
shows the need for equal rights to healthcare, regardless 
of  immigration  or  economic  status.  Further,  changes  at 
the legislative level are needed to protect those who have 
migrated to a different country from being penalised for 
accessing healthcare.71

At the organisational level, this meta- review identified a 
range of factors that women viewed as ideal care. Women 
appreciated the opportunity to discuss screening results 
with HPs and for it not to be filled out as a ‘tick- box’ exer-
cise.73 In terms of treatment, women wanted the oppor-
tunity  to  talk  to  someone  (a  HP  or  a  peer)  about  their 
difficulties.53 56 57 69 72 74 They found peer support offered

them  a  sense  of  validation  which  they  appreciated.75 
To  overcome  logistical  barriers,  the  location  of  services 
should be easily accessible, or in women’s homes.44 48 56 61 
Further,  the  length  of  treatment  should  be  flexible  and 
based  on  women’s  needs.  Women  did  not  want  a  ‘one- 
size- fits- all’ approach but wanted individualised treatment 
that was culturally appropriate.47 49 54–57 59 75 76

At  the  interpersonal  and  HP  level,  the  characteristics 
of the HPs were important, as was their communication 
with women. Women reported that many HPs normalised 
their symptoms or were dismissive of their attempts to seek 
help. This may reflect the heavy workload experienced by 
many HP.77–79 For example, research suggests that consul-
tations where mental health problems are discussed take 
longer,  and  HPs  often  feel  there  is  not  enough  time  to 
address concerns fully.79 80 This finding could also reflect 
inadequate training.81 Within the UK, guidance states that 
all  midwives  and  health  visitors  should  receive  training 
in order for them to identify, care for and refer women 
with PMH problems.82 However, a synthesis of 30 studies 
found that midwives lack the confidence, knowledge and 
training  to  do  this,83  therefore,  training  around  mental 
health is important. Another key training need is cultural 
sensitivity  and  cross- cultural  understanding  of  PMH. 
Some  systematic  reviews  in  this  meta- review  identified 
that  women  were  treated  in  a  culturally  insensitive  way 
by  HPs  and  that  women  of  colour  were  less  likely  to  be 
offered treatment or be asked about their mental health. 
It has been suggested that training given at medical and 
nursing  school  does  not  do  enough  to  reduce  uncon-
scious biases against marginalised groups, which in turn 
influences treatment provided by healthcare providers.84
Improved interpretation services within PMH care may 
aid  culturally  sensitive  care.  Another  potential  way  to 
improve  culturally  sensitive  care  is  through  the  recruit-
ment and retention of healthcare providers from diverse 
backgrounds.85 This strategy has the potential to improve 
interpersonal relationships between HPs and patients,86 87 
which  may  therefore  increase  disclosure  of  PMH  prob-
lems  to  HPs.  In  addition,  research  suggests  increased 
representation  of  diverse  populations  in  healthcare  is 
associated with improved communication between health 
providers,88  89  which  therefore  may  reduce  the  risk  of 
women falling through gaps in the care pathway.

Further,  it  has  been  argued  that  the  way  the  western 
world views mental illness is very ethnocentric90 and that 
culture and society influences what is viewed as a mental 
illness.91  This  may  mean  that  some  women’s  attempts 
to  seek  help  are  missed  by  HPs.  It  is,  therefore,  crucial 
that  cultural  sensitivity  and  cross- cultural  mental  health 
training is provided to HPs.

In  terms  of  individual- level  factors,  many  of  these 
barriers can be improved through the recommendations 
suggested  above.  For  example,  improvement  of  knowl-
edge  around  mental  health  is  likely  to  reduce  women’s 
fear  of  judgement  and  self- stigma  and  increase  her 
awareness  of  the  symptoms  she  is  experiencing,  which 
may  encourage  help- seeking.92  Redesign  of  care,  such 

10

as providing easily accessible healthcare, may reduce the 
logistical barriers women experience.

Strengths and limitations
The strength of this meta- review is the synthesis of a large 
amount of information from 32 systematic reviews from 
many  different  countries  in  order  to  identify  barriers 
and  facilitators  to  women  deciding  to  seek  help,  access 
help and engage in PMH care. This information was then 
used  to  provide  recommendations  for  the  design  and 
delivery of care. A limitation of the methodology is that 
only reviews published in academic journals and written 
in English language were included. Relevant reviews from 
health services, charities, third sector organisations, and 
other  grey  literature  may  have  been  missed.  Another 
limitation is that only 10% of studies had duplicate data 
extraction.  However,  concordance  was  high,  and  it  is 
therefore unlikely that any key themes were missed.

A  limitation  about  the  papers  included  in  the  meta- 
review  was  that  most  of  them  were  rated  as  having  low 
or critically low quality, meaning less confidence can be 
placed on their results. However, the qualitative sensitivity 
analysis found that most themes were supported in both 
the higher quality and lower quality reviews and including 
all reviews meant there was more focus on marginalised 
women,  such  as  refugees,  migrants  and  women  living 
in  sub- Saharan  Africa.  This  shows  that  the  results  from 
this  meta- review  can  be  interpreted  with  reasonable 
confidence.

Implications for future research
This  review  has  revealed  several  limitations  with  the 
current  evidence  base  on  this  topic.  Very  few  system-
atic  reviews  (n=2)  addressed  the  severity  of  illness,  only 
one  review  looked  at  severe  PMH  problems59  and  most 
reviews  (n=24)  focused  only  on  depression.  There  may 
be different barriers for other PMH problems therefore 
future research should focus on researching the barriers 
and  facilitators  to  women  with  disorders  other  than 
depression. Another limitation with the identified reviews 
is  that  no  reviews  specified  whether  women  had  given 
birth to singletons only, or twins/higher- order multiples. 
This is important, as parents of twins or multiples report 
unique experiences in accessing PMH care.93

Furthermore,  reviews  only  covered  the  inclusion  of 
studies carried out in 25 countries, and only one review 
included  studies  that  were  only  carried  out  in  LMICs.46 
More research is needed in other countries to further aid 
our  understanding  of  help- seeking  and  accessing  care 
in women with PMH problems. In addition, none of the 
identified reviews included studies from diverse families, 
including same- sex couples and the transgender commu-
nity.  It  is  important  that  future  research  recruits  more 
diverse populations to ensure all voices are heard.

Most reviews were rated as having low or critically low 
quality  meaning  less  confidence  can  be  placed  on  their 
results. However, the qualitative sensitivity analysis found 
that  most  themes  were  supported  in  both  the  higher 

Webb R, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e066703. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066703quality and lower quality reviews and including all reviews 
meant there was more focus on marginalised women, such 
as  refugees,  migrants  and  women  living  in  sub- Saharan 
Africa. This shows that the results from this meta- review 
can be interpreted with reasonable confidence.

Conclusion
The  findings  from  this  review  point  to  a  complex  inter-
play of individual and system- level factors across different 
stages  of  the  care  pathway  that  can  influence  whether 
women  seek  help  and  access  care  for  PMH  problems. 
These factors should all be considered by policy- makers 
to improve the identification and treatment of PMH prob-
lems.  Recommendations  for  the  design  and  delivery  of 
PMH care have been produced, building on the barriers 
and  facilitators  identified  in  this  review.  The  identified 
barriers and facilitators point to the need for an interna-
tional effort to reduce mental health stigma, and increase 
woman- centred,  flexible  care,  delivered  by  well  trained 
and culturally competent HPs.
