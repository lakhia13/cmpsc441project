HIGHLIGHTS
• This is to our knowledge 

the first literature review of 
the effectiveness and key 
factors of Somatic 
Experiencing  (SE). 

• Results provide preliminary 

evidence that SE is an 
effective treatment of PSTD 
related symptoms and may 
be also usefull in the treat-
ment of other disorders.  

ABSTRACT
Background: The body-oriented therapeutic approach Somatic  Experiencing®  (SE)  treats post- 
traumatic symptoms by changing the interoceptive and proprioceptive sensations associated 
with  the  traumatic  experience.  Filling  a  gap  in  the  landscape  of  trauma  treatments,  SE  has 
attracted growing interest in research and therapeutic practice, recently.
Objective: To date, there is no literature review of the effectiveness and key factors of SE. This 
review  aims  to  summarize  initial  findings  on  the  effectiveness  of  SE  and  to  outline  method- 
specific key factors of SE.
Method:  To  gain  a  first  overview  of  the  literature,  we  conducted  a  scoping  review  including 
studies until 13 August 2020. We identified 83 articles of which 16 fit inclusion criteria and were 
systematically analysed.
Results:  Findings  provide  preliminary  evidence  for  positive  effects  of  SE  on  PTSD-related 
symptoms. Moreover, initial evidence suggests that SE  has a positive impact on affective and 
somatic  symptoms  and  measures  of  well-being  in  both  traumatized  and  non-traumatized 
samples. Practitioners and clients identified resource-orientation and use of touch as method- 
specific  key  factors  of  SE.  Yet,  an  overall  studies  quality  assessment  as  well  as  a  Cochrane 
analysis of risk of bias indicate that the overall study quality is mixed.
Conclusions:  The  results  concerning  effectiveness  and  method-specific  key  factors  of  SE  are 
promising;  yet,  require  more  support  from  unbiased  RCT-research.  Future  research  should 
focus on filling this gap.

Experiencia somática – Efectividad y factores clave de una terapia para 
trauma orientada en el cuerpo: Una revisión del alcance de la literatura
Antecedentes:  Somatic  Experiencing®  (SE),  abordaje  terapéutico  enfocado  en  el  cuerpo,  trata 
los  síntomas  postraumáticos  mediante  al  modificación  de  las  sensaciones  interoceptivas 
y propioceptivas asociadas a la experiencia traumática. Al subsanar una brecha en el repertorio 
de  tratamientos  para  el  trauma,  la  ES  ha  atraído  recientemente  un  creciente  interés  en 
investigación y en la práctica terapéutica.
Objetivo: A la fecha, no existe una revisión de la literatura sobre la efectividad y los factores 
clave  de  la  ES.  Esta  revisión  tiene  por  objetivo  el  resumir  los  hallazgos  iniciales  sobre  la 
efectividad de la ES y describir los factores claves específicos del método aplicado en la ES.
Métodos: Para  obtener un primer panorama  general de  la literatura, realizamos  una revisión 
del  alcance  de  la  literatura  incluyendo  estudios  publicados  hasta  el  13  de  agosto  del  2020. 
Identificamos  83  artículos,  de  los  cuales  16  cumplían  con  los  criterios  de  inclusión  y  fueron 
analizados de manera sistemática.
Resultados:  Los  hallazgos  brindan  evidencia  preliminar  sobre  efectos  positivos  de  la  ES  en 
síntomas  relacionados  al  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  (TEPT).  Asimismo,  la  evidencia 
inicial  sugiere  que  la  ES  tiene  un  impacto  positivo  sobre  síntomas  afectivos  y  somáticos, 
y  sobre  indicadores  de  bienestar  tanto  en  muestras  de  personas  traumatizadas  como  en  no 
traumatizadas. Los facultativos y los clientes identificaron recursos de orientación y el uso del 
tacto como los factores clave específicos del método aplicado en la ES. Sin embargo, tanto una 
evaluación general de la calidad de los estudios como un análisis Cochrane para el riesgo de 
sesgo mostraron que la calidad general del estudio es mixta.
Conclusiones:  Los  resultados  relacionados  a  la  efectividad  y  a  los  factores  clave  específicos 
del  método  aplicado  en  la  ES  son  prometedores;  no  obstante,  se  requiere  mayor  sustento 
proveniente de ensayos clínicos aleatorizados sin sesgo. Las investigaciones futuras deberían 
enfocarse en subsanar esta brecha.

In traumatic situations, people are pushed beyond the 
limits  of  their  mental  and  physical  capacity.  These 
events  trigger  a  strong  stress  reaction  and  may  lead 
to serious psychological and physical illnesses such as 
post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD;  e.g.  Brady, 
Killeen,  Brewerton,  &  Lucerini,  2000).  According  to 
the DSM-V criteria (American Psychiatric Association 
[APA],  2014)  the  characteristic  symptoms  of  PTSD 
can  be  classified  into  three  symptom  groups:  intru-
sions  (involuntary  and  stressful  memories  of  the 
trauma),  avoidance  of  the  trauma  associated  stimuli, 
and  persistent  physiological  hyperarousal.  Unlike 
other  mental disorders, PTSD has a particularly high 
persistence  and  low  levels  of  spontaneous  remission 
(Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995). 
Moreover,  people  with  PTSD  symptoms  report  high 
levels  of  suffering  and  have  an  increased  chance  of 
developing  additional  mental  disorders  (e.g.  Stewart, 
Pihl, Conrod, & Dongier, 1998). Thus, it is important 
to identify effective interventions for the treatment of 
PTSD and to pursue new approaches that can success-
fully complement the existing ones.

A  recent  comparative  effectiveness  review  reports 
a growing number of RCTs in the treatment of PTSD 
(O’Neil  et  al.,  2020).  By  now,  research  on  non- 
pharmacological  approaches  has  focused  primarily 
on  cognitive-behavioural  and  exposure-based  proce-
dures  to  treat  PTSD  (e.g.  Watts  et  al.,  2013).  These 
approaches  address  the  dysfunctional  cognitive  and 
affective  processing  of  traumatic  experiences  and  try 
to  teach  a  new  way  of  dealing  with  the  trauma. 
Numerous  studies  show  that  these  procedures  can 
lead to a significant reduction in post-traumatic symp-
toms  (e.g.  Watts  et  al.,  2013).  Cognitive-behavioural 
and exposure-based interventions can thus be an effec-
tive way to treat PSTD.

However,  cognitive-behavioural  and  exposure- 
based  interventions  do  not  help  all  clients  to  reduce 
their  PTSD-symptoms  (e.g.  Corrigan  &  Hull,  2015). 
Cognitive, 
require 
a  substantial  amount  of  cognitive  processing.  Yet, 
people  who  suffer  from  traumatic  experiences  show 

language-based 

interventions

frequently 

impaired  cognitive  functioning  due  to  the  increased 
negative  affect  that  they  are  experiencing  in  trauma- 
(Mujica-Parodi,  Greenbag,  & 
related 
Kilpatrick,  2004;  Van  der  Kolk,  2016).  Thus,  the 
trauma-related cognitive malfunction may reduce the 
efficacy of cognitive-behavioural treatments (Van der 
Kolk  &  Fisler,  1995).  Additionally,  exposure-based 
interventions 
cognitive- 
behavioural therapy result in high drop-out rates due 
to the confrontational, aversive nature of the interven-
tion (Lewis, Roberts, Gibson, & Bisson, 2020; Wald & 
Taylor, 2008). As a result, the last decade witnessed the 
development  of 
complementing,  body-oriented 
approaches aiming at changing the physiological and 
emotional  processing  of  the  traumatic  experience  in 
a  ‘bottom-up’  instead  of  ‘top-down’  way  (Van  der 
Kolk,  1994,  2016). 
top-down 
approaches, bottom-up procedures focus on the body 
‘body  memory’.  In  other  words,  these 
and  the 
approaches  emphasize  the  importance  of  subcortical 
brain levels, such as the brain stem and limbic system. 
Starting  from  these  more  ‘primitive’  brain  structures 
and their embodied reactions, bottom-up approaches 
aim at changing the way the body responds to trauma 
experiences and are working upwards towards higher 
cortical systems (Levine, 1997; Van der Kolk, 2016).

In  contrast 

to 

1. Somatic experiencing

Among  others,  the  ‘bottom-up’  approach  Somatic 
Experiencing®  (SE;  Levine,  1997)  has  emerged  as 
a  promising  intervention  for  the  treatment  of  PSTD 
(see case reports: case of ‘Nancy’, Levine, 2008; case of 
‘Simon’,  Payne,  Levine,  &  Crane-Godreau,  2015).  It 
focuses  on  resolving  the  symptoms  of  chronic  stress 
and  post-traumatic  stress  (Payne  et  al.,  2015).  SE  is 
a body-oriented therapeutic approach that focuses on 
the  psychophysiological  consequences  of  the  trau-
matic  event.  SE  is  based  on  a  generalized  psychobio-
logical  model  of  resilience  (Levine,  1997).  According 
to SE, post-traumatic stress symptoms originate from 
a  permanent  overreaction  of  the  innate  stress  system

due  to  the  overwhelming  character  of  the  traumatic 
event. In the traumatic situation, people are unable to 
complete the initiated psychological and physiological 
defensive  reaction  (e.g.  prolonged  freeze  instead  of 
fight  or  flight;  Levine,  1997).  This

leads 

well  (Foundation  for  Human  Enrichment,  2007; 
Levine, 1997; Payne et al., 2015).

Moreover, some specific interventions are designed 
which  are  based  on  SE  principles  for  application  in 
specific settings. One example is the trauma resilience 
model (TRM). It was developed by Leitch and Miller- 
Karas as a brief, early intervention used for stabiliza-
tion  in  disaster  and  emergency  settings  (Leitch  & 
Miller-Karas, 2009).

therapy 

from  cognitive-behavioural 

Therefore, the primary goal of SE is to modify the 
trauma-related  stress  response  (Ogden  &  Minton, 
2000).  To  achieve  this,  its  major  interventional  strat-
egy builds on bottom-up processing. Clients’ attention 
is directed to internal sensations, both visceral (inter-
oception)  and  musculoskeletal  (proprioception  and 
kinaesthesis),  rather  than  to  primarily  cognitive  or 
emotional  experiences.  This  is  an  important  diver-
that 
gence 
focusses  primarily  on  the  cognitive  and  emotional 
experience  associated with  the  trauma.  In doing  this, 
clients  are  trained  to  gradually  reduce  the  arousal 
associated  with  the  trauma  by  increasingly  tolerating 
and  accepting  the  inner  physical  sensations  and 
related emotions and by activating internal and exter-
nal resources, such as identifying parts of the body or 
memories that are associated with a positive and reas-
suring feeling. The resulting increase in interoceptive 
and  proprioceptive  awareness  leads  to  a  ‘discharge 
process’  after  which  the  trauma-related  activation  is 
resolved  (Brom  et  al.,  2017;  Payne  et  al.,  2015).  An 
important divergence from exposure-based therapy is 
that clients do not have to relive the whole traumatic 
event again to reduce the stress-reaction. The SE ther-
apeutic  intervention  specifically  avoids  direct  and 
intense  evocation  of  traumatic  memories.  Trauma- 
related  memories  are  approached  indirectly  and  very 
gradually. Additionally, the generation of new correc-
tive  interoceptive  experiences  that  physically  contra-
dict 
those  of  overwhelm  and  helplessness  are 
facilitated (Payne et al., 2015). By this so-called process 
of ‘renegotiating’ (Levine, 1997) the clients’ traumatic 
stress reaction related to the trauma is modified in an 
adaptive and holistic manner.

As mentioned above, SE is based on a generalized 
psychobiological  model  of  resilience  (Levine,  1997). 
Thus,  the  psychophysiological  dysregulation  that 
occurs  in  a  traumatic  situation  is  expected  to  be 
associated  with  other  mental  disorders  such  as 
panic  disorder,  depression,  or  chronic  pain  (e.g. 
Carney,  Freedland,  &  Veith,  2005;  Chrousos,  2009; 
Cohen et al., 2000) as well. In these cases, the bottom- 
up approach aims to promote clients’ ability for self- 
regulation, thereby contributing to a stress-reduction 
and  finally  to  an 
in  symptoms. 
Although  originally  developed  to  treat  trauma- 
related  disorders,  SE  is  therefore  increasingly  used 
in clinical practice to treat other mental disorders as 

improvement 

2. The present study

Despite  the  high  interest  in  clinical  practice  and 
a growing number of empirical studies on SE, there is 
still no literature overview of the current state of knowl-
edge of SE. The aim of the present study is to provide 
a literature overview of research on SE with a focus on 
initial  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  this  approach. 
Furthermore, we aimed to identify method-specific key 
factors of SE to outline avenues for future research.

3. Method

Considering the novelty of the research field regarding 
SE and the heterogeneity of the existing literature, we 
decided to apply a scoping review approach (Arksey & 
O’Malley,  2005).  Arksey  and  O’Malley  (2005)  pro-
posed  that  a  scoping  review  is  informative  when  a) 
a  research  field  is  still  in  its  early  stages  of  develop-
ment, b) the overall aim is to cover a broader research 
question including many different study designs, and/ 
or  c),  when  the  research  field  is less  likely  to  address 
specific research questions.

3.1.

Identifying the research questions

Arksey and O’Malley (2005) recommend to maintain 
a wide approach to cover a broad range of studies and 
topics. Consistently, in the initial stage, we conducted 
an exploratory literature research. After screening the 
results, we specified inclusion and exclusion criteria in 
an  iterative  process  to  focus  on  the  two  central 
research questions present in the field (for details, see 
Supplement Material Section I): What is known about 
the  effectiveness  of  the  SE  approach?  And  what  are 
method-specific key factors of SE?

3.2. Literature search strategy

Pubmed, 

PSYNDEX, 

We  identified  relevant  studies  using  the  databases 
PubPsych, 
PSYJournals, 
PsycINFO,  and  PsycARTICLES  as  well  as  Google 
Scholar  and  Google  using  the  following  search  terms: 
‘somatic  experiencing’,  ‘SE’,  or  in  combination  with 
‘trauma’, ‘body therapy’ or ‘body trauma therapy’. The 
search  was  extended  by  tracking  the  references  in 
identified  hits  and  by  checking  the  publication  lists 

4

of  authors, who published identified,  relevant studies 
on  SE.  Additionally,  the  bibliography  of  the  somatic 
experiencing training manual (Foundation for Human 
Enrichment,  2007)  served  as  a  supplementary  source 
of  information  for  potential  articles.  Finally,  expert 
interviews with SE trainers were conducted, resulting 
in  the  identification  of  further  valuable  sources  of 
literature.

3.3. Eligibility criteria

After screening the initial findings, we added relevant 
points  to  the  criteria  in  several  steps  until  we  finally 
obtained a set of studies with sufficient methodological 
soundness and adequate content.

We included all studies that met the final inclusion 
criteria: 1) They were published in peer-reviewed jour-
nal  articles,  dissertations  or  clinical  research  project 
reports  that  were  available  in  the  above-mentioned 
databases  up  to  and  including  13  August  2020; 
and  2)  were  available  in  German  or  English.  3)  The 
studies included quantitative and qualitative empirical 
analysis of SE with sample sizes of N > 1; and 4) tested 
SE  as  a  therapeutic  intervention  in  isolation  or  in 
combination  with  another  therapeutic  intervention. 
We  excluded  all  studies  that  1)  investigated  SE  in 
combination  with  more  than  one  other  therapeutic 
method;  2)  explained  only  theoretical  aspects  of 
SE;  3)  placed  SE  in  a  new  neuroscientific  framework 
model; or 4) discussed theoretical differences between 
SE and another therapeutic approach.

We did not define any inclusion/exclusion criteria 
intervention 
concerning  outcome  measures  and 
details  (e.g.  number  of  SE  sessions  or  duration  of 
treatment). Details of the search and selection process 
are reported in Figure 1 and in Sections I and II of the 
Supplemental Online Material.

3.4. Data analysis

The aim of the present scoping review was to present 
and  summarize  all  data  reviewed  without  seeking  to 
quantitatively  assess  quality  of  evidence  (Arksey  & 
O’Malley,  2005).  Still,  a  critical  quality  evaluation  of 
the studies was conducted by implementing an overall 
quality assessment and a Cochrane risk of bias assess-
ment (Higgins & Green, 2008).

We  use  descriptive  data  to  summarize  the  studies 
(see  Table  1),  list  the  studies’  overall  quality  assess-
ment (see Table 2) and the Cochrane risk of bias (see 
Tables  3  and  4),  and,  finally,  document  the  reported 
effect sizes as well as other statistical information and 
results documented in the original quantitative studies 
(see Tables 5 and 6). We used counts and proportions 
to report all other data. No inferential statistical testing 
was performed in the present study.

4. Results

4.1. Study characteristics

Out  of  83  articles  identified  at  the  beginning,  16  ful-
filled the inclusion criteria. Table 1 reports details on 
the included studies. To facilitate reading, numbering 
in the Results section refers to Table 11: Ten quantita-
tive studies [1–10] tested the effectiveness of SE and six 
qualitative  analyses  [11–16]  investigated  method- 
specific key factors of SE.

4.1.1. Study  setting and participants
The  included  articles  were  published  between  2007 
and 2018. The majority of the studies were conducted 
in the USA (53%). Still, we found further studies con-
ducted  in  Denmark  (12%),  India  (12%),  Brazil  (6%), 
Thailand  (6%),  China  (6%)  and  Israel  (6%).  Ten  of 
them  have  been  published  in  international  peer- 
reviewed  journals  [1–9,  16].  The  sample  size  varied 
between  N  =   3  and  N  =   350  (total  N  =  1014).  All 
studies  included  samples  of  adult  subjects;  one  study 
additionally investigated children and adolescents [5]. 
The  following  samples  were  examined:  Victims  of 
natural catastrophes such as a hurricanes or tsunamis 
[4, 5, 6]; students in/after classic [9, 10] or shortened 
SE training (Trauma Resilience Model; TRM; Leitch & 
Miller-Karas,  2009)  [7];  practicing  SE  practitioners 
[11, 12, 13]; subjects with a diagnosis of PTSD due to 
diverse experienced traumas [1], subjects with chronic 
low  back  pain  and  comorbid  PTSD  [2]  or  comorbid 
depression  [16];  homeless  adults  [3];  subjects  with 
altered  gender  identity  [8];  Tibetan  refugees  [15]; 
and women traumatized by domestic violence [14].

4.1.2. Outcome measurements
In the  quantitative  studies, a  total  of  24 different  test 
instruments were used, of which only two instruments 
were used more than once (in two studies).

Overall,  the  16  included  studies  show  a  great  het-
erogeneity, not only in the type of sample but also in 
length and format (e.g. individual or group session) of 
the SE intervention, as well as the research objectives 
of the studies.

4.2. Quality of included quantitative studies

All  ten  quantitative  studies  were  systematically  ana-
lysed  and  critically  evaluated.  We  derived  the  overall 
quality assessment criteria on the basis of the criteria 
used  in  previous  reviews  (e.g.  Lemmens,  Müller, 
Arntz,  &  Huibers,  2016).  Additionally,  we  developed 
new  criteria  based  on  the  methodological  differences 
and deficiencies of the included studies. Table 2 pro-
vides  a  summary  of  studies’  overall  quality.  Further 
details  on  the  assessment  of  overall  study  quality  are 
provided  in  Section  IV  of  the  Supplemental  Online 
Material.

Two  studies  [1,  2]  were  classified  as  randomized 
controlled trials, three [3, 6, 14] used a control group 
without randomization. For these five studies, we con-
ducted a Cochrane risk of bias assessment (Higgins & 
Green, 2008) resulting in mixed evaluation of the risk 
of  bias with  different  problems  in  each  study (details 
see Tables 3 and 4).

4.3. Key findings

We grouped the results in two different sections struc-
tured  by  the  two  research  questions.  First,  we  outline 
results  on  the  effectiveness  of  SE  in  the  treatment  of 
PTSD and other psychological disorders. Next, we focus 
on the results on method-specific key factors of SE.

4.4. Effectiveness

The results of the effectiveness analysis are presented 
in  Table  5.  Overall,  we  found  ten  studies  reporting 
pre-  to  post-treatment  changes  in  symptoms.  In 
these  ten  studies,  24  different  test  instruments  were 
collected.  Only  two  instruments  (WHOQOL-BREF; 
PHQ-SADS) were used twice in two different studies 
[8, 9]. The dependent variables were collected at one to 
four  measurement  points  across  all  studies.  The  fol-
low-up measurements covered a period between seven 
days and 12 months after the first measurement.

In six of the ten studies, the intervention consisted 
of individual SE sessions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and in another

of SE group sessions [8]. Studies provided between 1–3 
sessions [3, 4, 5, 6] and 6–15 sessions [1, 2, 8]. In the 
three  remaining  cases,  no  SE  sessions  were  held, 
instead  participation  in  the  SE  training  modules 
served  as  an  intervention.  In  only  four  studies, 
a  control  group  was  established  [1,  2,  3,  6].  We 
grouped  the  results  on  effectiveness  depending  on 
the dependent variables.

4.4.1. Posttraumatic stress symptoms
In  four  studies  [1,  2,  4,  6],  the  effects  of  SE  on  post-
traumatic  stress  symptoms  were  investigated.  Positive 
effects of a SE treatment were found for all instruments 
assessing post-traumatic stress symptoms both in post- 
treatment and follow-up measurements up to one year. 
Three of the four studies included a control group and 
significant  effects  were  found  for  the  experimental 
group compared to the control group [1, 2, 6].

4.4.2. Depressive and anxiety symptoms
Two  [1,  3]  of  four  [1,  3,  8,  9]  studies  provide 
a  sufficient  data  basis  for  a  quantitative  analysis  of 

the effect of SE on depressive symptoms. Both studies 
report  significant  effects  of  SE  in  a  pre-post  compar-
ison for the experimental group that were absent in the 
control group. Regarding anxiety symptoms, two [3, 9] 
out of three [3, 8, 9] studies found a significant reduc-
tion in anxiety symptoms due to an SE intervention in 
the  follow-up  measurements  compared  to  baseline 
measurements  [3,  9]  and  to  control  group  [3].  The 
remaining study reported no improvement in anxiety 
through SE [8].

4.4.3. Specific symptom testing in the context  of 
trauma
Two  [4,  5]  of  three  [4,  5,  6]  studies  analysing  the 
effects  of  SE  during  natural  disasters,  such  as  tsu-
namis  or  hurricanes,  showed  positive  effects  of  SE 
on  all  measures  of  symptoms  assessed  by  self- 
symptom 
developed 
scores  and  stress  symptom  checklist  in  [4],  descrip-
tive  reduction  in  [5])  between  pre-post-follow-up 
measurements.  In  the  third  study  [6],  the  signifi-
cant  reduction  in  symptoms  was  achieved  on  the

psychological  scale  of  SCL-R  for  the  experimental 
group  compared  to  the  control  group  between  post 
and  follow-up  measurement,  while  the  physical 
symptom  scale  of  this  test  showed  no  changes. 
Regarding  pain-related  symptoms  in  the  context 
of  trauma,  one  study  [2]  assessed  the  variables 
kinesiophobia, pain-related  impairment, pain inten-
sity,  and  pain-related  catastrophizing.  All  assessed 
variables  were  significantly  reduced  in  pre  to  fol-
symptom 
low-up  comparisons.  Differences 
reduction  between  experimental  and  control  group 
were  found  only  for  the  variable  kinesiophobia.

4.4.4. Resilience
In addition, three studies addressed the influence of SE 
on  resilience  [6,  8,  9].  Two  of  them  collected  the 
general  quality  of  life  (by  using  the  WHOQOL- 
BREF).  There  were  significant  improvements  in  the 
social, physical [9] and psychological [8] domains, but 
not in the environmental domain [8, 9] of the general 
quality of life questionnaire in pre to follow-up com-
two  studies  [8,  9]  show  also 
parisons.  These 
a significant [9] or marginally significant [8] improve-
ment  in  the  somatic  symptom  scale  of  PHQ-SADS 
following  SE  intervention.  Beyond  that,  significant 
improvements  were  achieved  in  a  further  study  [6] 
on  an  in-house  developed  resilience  scale  in  pre  to 
follow-up  comparison  between  control  and  experi-
there  were  no  significant 
mental  group,  while 
improvements in an in house-developed coping scale 
of the same study.

4.4.5. User perspective
Finally,  two  studies  evaluated  the  SE  training 
by  implementing  one  post-measurement  after  the 
completed  training  modules  [9,  10].  In  both  stu-
dies,  descriptively  positive  effects  of  the  training 
on  the  professional  and  personal  life  of  the  SE 
trainees  could  be  shown.  Consistently,  in  a  third 
study  [7],  therapists  who  worked  in  crisis  areas 
reported  that  they  benefitted  in  their  work  and 
in  their  own  self-care  from  an  SE/TRM-training 
on  a  descriptive  level.  In  these  three  studies,  trai-
nees  did  not  receive  an  SE-treatment  themselves. 
Thus,  they  do  not  inform  about  the  effectiveness 
of  the  SE-treatment  and  method-specific  key  fac-
tors  and  are  excluded  from  further  discussion. 
Still,  it  might  be  an  interesting  avenue  for  future 
research to investigate whether SE leads to positive 
outcomes  for  both  clients  and  professionals.

4.5. Method-specific key factors

Six  studies  addressed  the  key  factors  of  SE  by  inter-
viewing both practitioners [11, 12, 13] and clients [14, 
15, 16]. The study specific results are listed in detail in

4.5.1. Practitioners’ perspective on  method-specific 
key factors of SE
In the following, we report only the key factors that are 
considered  key  aspects  for  the  success  of  SE  across 
studies and samples.

Physiological conceptualization of trauma. All inter-
viewed  practitioners  agreed  with  SE’s  basic  idea  that 
traumatic events are ‘stored’ in the nervous system and 
can be resolved by integrating non-verbal, physiologi-
cal impulses into the therapeutic process. Practitioners 
proposed  that  clients  who  do  not  agree  with  this 
trauma-concept were non-compliant with SE therapy 
and preferred a standard PTSD-treatment [11, 12, 13].

The  importance  of  psychoeducation. Furthermore, 
practitioners  from  all  three  studies  considered  the 
simplicity  of  the  theoretical  approach  of  SE  as  a  key 
factor  of  its  effectiveness.  The  theoretical  approach 
provides  an  easy,  comprehensive  approach  to  under-
stand the origin of a trauma and the need for treating 
symptoms at both the psychological and the physiolo-
gical level [11, 12, 13].

Establishment  of  trust  and  security. Finally,  practi-
tioners emphasized that building trust and security 
in  clients  is  a  central  factor  for  a  successful  SE 
treatment  of  trauma.  It  is  of  particular  importance 
that  clients  trust  both  the  therapeutic  approach  of 
SE  and  their  own  body  with  its  survival  mechan-
isms.  In  addition,  there  should  be  a  basic  feeling 
of  security  before  dealing  with  the  trauma  [11,  12, 
13].

4.5.2. Clients’ perspective on key factors
Reviewing  clients’  perspectives  on  key  factors  of  SE, 
we quickly realized that studies‘ results were too het-
erogeneous in terms of sample composition and inter-
vention  methods  to  be  able  to  draw  comprehensive 
conclusions  about  method-specific  key  factors  [14, 
15, 16].

4.5.3. Cross-category key factors
We  decided  to  summarize  the  key  factors  that 
were  found  both  in  the  reports  of  practitioners 
and  clients.  We  identified  two  method-specific 
key  factors  that  were  reported  consistently  in 
three  studies  [11,  13,  16  &  12,  13,  14]  by  both 
clients  and  practitioners.

Building up resources. Both practitioners and clients 
reported that the development and work with internal 
and  external resources  is an  important  key factor  for 
the effectiveness of SE. Some qualitative analyses high-
light that it is important to perceive the body itself as 
a central resource. Thus, practitioners should support 
clients in their ability to regulate and relax themselves. 
In addition, some analysis outlined that the successful 
establishment  of  internal  and  external  resources  is 
a  prerequisite  for  treating  the  trauma-related  experi-
ences [11, 13, 16].

Use  of  touch  in  SE. A  second  overarching  factor 
mentioned  by  practitioners  and  clients  is  the  use  of 
touch  –  either  self-touch  or  soft  touch  by  the  thera-
pist  –  in  therapy.  In  a  one-year  advanced  course,  SE 
practitioners learned techniques for the integrative use 
of touch in therapy (e.g. a hand contact on a shoulder 
to  provide  gentle  support  and  endorse  a  feeling  of 
safety).  According  to  the  theory  behind  SE  (Levine, 
1997), touch can be an important key factor in trauma 
healing  as  it  can  support  a  feeling  of  safety  which  is

a key to overcoming trauma symptoms. Consistently, 
the  majority  of  practitioners  and  clients  across  three 
studies  rated  touch  as  a  supporting  factor  and  as 
a  helpful,  effective  enhancer  in  therapeutic treatment 
[12, 13, 14].

characteristics  (e.g.  age,  culture,  socioeconomic  sta-
tus),  as  well  as  the complexity  and  cause of  the  trau-
matization (e.g. natural disasters, terrorist attacks, car 
accidents). Still, SE led to a significant symptom reduc-
tion in nearly all of the reviewed studies.

5. Discussion

In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  growing  interest  in 
body-oriented  psychotherapeutic  approaches,  espe-
cially  for  the  treatment  of  trauma-related  disorders 
(e.g.  Kim,  Schneider,  Kravitz,  Mermier,  &  Burge, 
2013;  Metcalf  et  al.,  2016).  Among  others,  Somatic 
Experiencing®  (SE;  Levine,  1997)  has  emerged  as 
a promising approach that focuses on the integration 
and modification of trauma-related somatic reactions. 
The  aim  of  the  present  review  was  to  examine  the 
initial  empirical  findings  on  the  effectiveness  and 
method-specific key factors of SE.

5.1. Findings on the effectiveness of SE

5.1.1. PTSD
SE  was  originally  developed  for  the  treatment  of 
trauma-related  stress  symptoms.  Consistently,  the 
majority of the studies that were reviewed focused on 
the  effectiveness  of  SE  in  the  treatment  of  PTSD. 
Overall,  four  of  the  five  studies  on  PTSD  showed 
significant  symptom  reductions  for  all  eight  depen-
(Andersen,  Lahav,  Ellegaard,  & 
dent  variables 
Manniche,  2017;  Brom  et  al.,  2017;  Leitch,  Vanslyke, 
&  Allen,  2009;  Parker,  Doctor,  &  Selvam,  2008).  The 
fifth  study  (descriptively  evaluated)  supports  these 
findings  (Leitch,  2007).  The  identified  effects  were 
shown  for  experimental  compared  to  control  group 
(Andersen et al., 2017; Brom et al., 2017; Leitch et al., 
in  comparisons  between  pre-  and  post- 
2009), 
measurement (Brom et al., 2017; Leitch, 2007; Parker 
et  al.,  2008)  and  remained  stable  in  the  follow-up 
measurements  (Andersen  et  al.,  2017;  Brom  et  al., 
2017;  Leitch,  2007;  Leitch  et  al.,  2009;  Parker  et  al., 
2008).  The  three  studies  using  a  control  group 
(Andersen et al., 2017; Brom et al., 2017; Leitch et al., 
2009)  showed  these  effects  in  experimental-control 
group  comparisons.  Three  out  of  four  studies  evalu-
ated by inferential statistics reported a large beneficial 
effect of SE (Andersen et al., 2017; Brom et al., 2017; 
Parker  et  al.,  2008),  the  fourth  (Leitch  et  al.,  2009) 
a  small  effect  (Cohen,  1988).  Taken  together,  there 
are 
suggesting 
a  significant,  long-term  symptom  reduction  due  to 
SE treatment.

initial,  but  promising  findings 

Moreover, these findings show that SE can success-
fully  treat  trauma  sequelae  in  different  settings  and 
under  different conditions.  The available studies  var-
ied  considerably  in  the  duration  of  the  intervention 
the  sample 
(between  1–2  and  6–15  sessions), 

5.1.2. Comorbidities
In addition, the present body of research suggests that 
SE leads  to  an  improvement  of  comorbid  symptoms. 
We  found  studies  reporting  positive  effects  of  SE  on 
comorbid  depression  symptoms  (Brom  et  al.,  2017), 
pain-related  symptoms  (Andersen  et  al.,  2017),  and 
post-treatment  resilience  (Leitch  et  al.,  2009).  The 
effect of SE on pain-related symptoms was shown for 
the variables kinesiophobia, pain-related impairment, 
pain intensity, and pain-related catastrophizing. These 
effects are limited by the fact that the symptom reduc-
tion  for  the  last  three  variables  was  evident  in  both 
experimental and control group. Overall, findings cor-
respond  with  SE’s  objective  of  a  symptom-spanning 
treatment of PTSD ranging from cognitive and affec-
tive to somatic symptoms (Levine, 1997; Payne et al., 
2015).

5.1.3. Further  symptomatology
An  additional  focus  of  the  reviewed  studies  was  the 
treatment of affective symptoms and the enhancement 
of well-being. In two studies, SE led to a reduction of 
depressive 
(Briggs,  Hayes,  &  Changaris,  2018; 
Changaris,  2010)  and  anxiety  symptoms  (Changaris, 
2010)  that  were  unrelated  to  trauma.  Two  studies 
showed positive effects on quality of life and somatic 
symptoms (Briggs et al., 2018; Winblad, Changaris, & 
Stein, 2018).

5.2. Evaluation of the effectiveness of SE

The  available  results  provide  initial,  but  promising 
evidence  that  SE  is  an  effective  treatment  of  PTSD 
and  comorbid  symptoms.  Moreover,  results  suggest 
that  SE  also  has  a  positive  effect  on  general  well- 
being  outside  PTSD  treatment  and  may  be  effective 
in the treatment of affective and somatic symptoms.

5.2.1. PTSD
Yet,  the  present  findings  are  limited  in  several  ways. 
First, by  now,  there is only  a  very limited  number of 
studies (n =  5) addressing the effectiveness of SE in the 
treatment  of  PTSD  with  sufficient  scientific  rigour. 
Second,  two  out  of  five  studies  on  PTSD  did  not 
compare  SE  treatments  to  adequate  control  groups. 
Moreover, these studies used self-developed symptom 
checklists as dependent variables (Leitch, 2007; Parker 
et al., 2008). The authors report that they had to adapt 
the questionnaires to the severe traumatization of the 
subjects in the investigated crisis areas and thus could 
not refer to validated standard questionnaires used in

PTSD research. The special survey conditions of some 
studies  also  resulted  in  only  two  out  of  five  studies 
including exclusively subjects with a confirmed PTSD 
diagnosis  (Andersen  et  al.,  2017;  Brom  et  al.,  2017). 
Furthermore,  the  assessment  of  the  risk  of  bias 
(Higgins  &  Green,  2008)  indicates  that  the  risk  of 
bias  is  mixed  throughout  the  experimental  studies. 
The  overall  study  quality  assessment  points  out  the 
high  heterogeneity  of  the  included  studies.  Thus,  the 
field of SE research is urging for strong experimental 
research designs. Still, regarding these limitations, it is 
important to notice that SE is statistically most effec-
tive in the methodologically high-quality randomized 
controlled  trials  (Andersen  et  al.,  2017;  Brom  et  al., 
2017).  Results  suggest  that  the  positive  effects  of  SE 
found  in  these  studies  were  reduced  rather  than 
inflated due to methodological shortcomings.

5.2.2. Further symptomatology
Beyond the treatment of PTSD, it is also apparent that 
(a) the effects  of SE were  not stable  across all depen-
dent  variables,  (b)  the  studies  had  small  sample  sizes 
(Briggs et al., 2018) and (c) a control group was only 
collected in one of the studies (Changaris, 2010). Due 
to the small number of available studies (n = 3) and the 
methodological  deficiencies  mentioned,  findings  can 
therefore be considered only preliminary evidence for 
the effectiveness of SE outside PTSD.

5.3. Method-specific key factors of SE

the 

following 

emphasized 

Six  studies  investigated  method-specific  key  factors 
(Ellegaard  &  Pedersen,  2012;  Gomes  Silva,  2014; 
Hays,  2014;  McMahon,  2017;  Nickerson,  2015; 
Olssen,  2013).  Across  the  three  studies  from  practi-
tioner’s  perspective,  all  the  practitioners  who  were 
three 
interviewed 
method-specific  key  factors:  Physiological  concep-
tualization  of  trauma,  psychoeducation,  and  the 
establishment  of  security  and  trust  (Hays,  2014; 
McMahon,  2017;  Olssen,  2013).  Moreover,  both 
practitioners  and  clients  emphasized  that  resource 
activation  (Ellegaard  &  Pedersen,  2012;  Hays,  2014; 
Olssen,  2013)  and  the  use  of  touch  (Gomes  Silva, 
2014;  Hays,  2014;  McMahon,  2017)  are  method- 
specific  key  factors  in  SE.

These  findings  are  again  limited  by  the  fact  that 
studies  on  key  factors  in  SE  (n  =   6)  are  still 
scarce.  Furthermore,  these  studies  are  very  hetero-
genous  in  both  study  design  and  study  objective. 
For  instance,  two  out  of  six  studies  investigating 
the  key factors of SE analysed a combination of SE 
with  another  therapeutic  intervention  suggesting 
that  the  identified  key  factors  in  these  studies 
may  not  be  attributed  to  the  SE  intervention 
alone  (Ellegaard  &  Pedersen,  2012;  Gomes  Silva, 
2014).

Still,  results  provide  a  first  overview  of  method- 
specific key factors of SE outlining avenues for future 
research on SE.

5.4. Limitations and future directions

In the present scoping review, we investigated the state 
of  literature  on  the  effectiveness  and  key  factors  of 
Somatic  Experiencing  (SE),  a  body-oriented  approach 
to treat PTSD (Levine, 1997): Overall, the present find-
ings  are  consistent  with  previous  findings  on  body- 
oriented PTSD interventions. In a comprehensive field 
review,  Kim  et  al.  (2013)  showed  that  body-oriented 
procedures are effective interventions for the treatment 
of  PTSD  symptoms  and  have  a  positive  effect  on 
comorbid  symptoms,  as  well.  Consistently,  we  found 
preliminary evidence suggesting that SE is an effective 
approach  to  treat  PTSD  and  comorbid  symptoms 
(Andersen et al., 2017; Brom et al., 2017; Leitch, 2007; 
Leitch et al., 2009; Parker et al., 2008). Taken together, 
findings  suggest  that  body-oriented  interventions  are 
a promising approach to treat trauma-related disorders 
and may complement other interventions in this area.

This review is, to our knowledge, the first literature 
review  of  studies  on  SE.  The  aim  was  therefore  to 
provide a comprehensive and broad overview of exist-
ing research. For this reason, in addition to checking 
the databases and search engines, a number of expert 
interviews  were  conducted  and  additional  hits  were 
identified by tracking references.

The included studies report promising effects of SE in 
the treatment of PTSD symptoms. Moreover, the present 
findings  also  provide  initial  evidence  that  SE  may  be 
useful as a body-oriented approach beyond trauma ther-
apy  (Briggs  et  al.,  2018;  Changaris,  2010;  Ellegaard  & 
Pedersen,  2012;  Winblad  et  al.,  2018).  Consistent  with 
the  underlying  model  of  SE  to  treat  PTSD  as 
a psychobiological phenomenon (Levine, 1997), the posi-
tive effects of SE treatment were found for diverse out-
come  measures  ranging  from  affective  symptoms  to 
psychosomatic symptoms such as pain.

However, the results must be interpreted with cau-
tion. Only few of the studies meet the rigorous meth-
odological  criteria  (e.g.  RCT  design)  necessary  for 
a  robust  proof  of  both  efficacy  and  effectiveness  of 
a clinical treatment.

Therefore,  we  encourage  future  research  to  repli-
cate  the  previous  findings  in  randomized  controlled 
trials  with  satisfactory  sample  sizes  to  evaluate  SE’s 
efficacy.  For  this  purpose,  the  development  of 
a  standardized  therapeutic  manual  is  recommended. 
Training practitioners in a manualized therapy would 
reduce  the  heterogeneity  of  the  interventions  exam-
ined in the empirical studies. By ensuring a high meth-
odological  standard  of  the  SE  interventions,  future 
studies  may  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  effectiveness  of 

SE  more  precisely.  In  a  following  step,  SE  should  be 
compared with other interventions.

A second focus of the present review was to inves-
tigate  the  key  factors  in  SE  (Ellegaard  &  Pedersen, 
2012;  Gomes  Silva,  2014;  Hays,  2014;  McMahon, 
2017;  Nickerson,  2015;  Olssen,  2013).  Consistent 
with  the  theoretical  foundation  of  SE  (Levine,  1997) 
and  previous  reports  from  SE  users,  we  identified 
resource  activation  (Ellegaard  &  Pedersen,  2012; 
Hays,  2014;  Olssen,  2013)  and  the  use  of  touch 
(Gomes  Silva,  2014;  Hays,  2014;  McMahon,  2017) 
(by both clients and practitioners) as well as physiolo-
gical  conceptualization  of  trauma,  the  importance  of 
psychoeducation,  and  the  establishment  of  security 
and  trust  (Hays,  2014;  McMahon,  2017;  Olssen, 
2013)  (by  practitioners)  as  method-specific  key 
factors.

The  latter  represents  a  key  factor  that  is  exclu-
sively  used  in  body-oriented  approaches.  Thus,  we 
encourage  future  research  to  investigate  the  influ-
ence  of  these  key  factors  and  therapeutic  outcomes 
in  randomized  control-trials  and  to  outline  poten-
tial  implications  for  standard  approaches  in  trauma 
therapy.

Although  SE  was  developed  as  an  intervention  in 
the  context  of  trauma  therapy,  there  are  reports  that 
practitioners have successfully implemented SE in the 
treatment  of  other  psychological  disorders  (Briggs 
et  al.,  2018;  Changaris,  2010;  Ellegaard  &  Pedersen, 
2012;  Winblad  et  al.,  2018).  In  the  present  scoping 
review, we found that SE is often used in combination 
with  other  treatment  procedures  (Changaris,  2010; 
Ellegaard  &  Pedersen,  2012;  Hays,  2014;  Nickerson, 
2015). Findings suggest that SE is easily integrated in 
existing therapeutic approaches (e.g. as a supplement 
to  Gestalt  therapy  (Ellegaard  &  Pedersen,  2012)).  In 
future  studies,  the  ability  to  combine  SE  with  other 
procedures  could  be  systematically  investigated.  This 
would make SE useful for the broad field of application 
and enable synergy effects.

Finally, the present study identified the duration of SE 
intervention  as  a  potentially  important  moderating  key 
factor of the effectiveness of SE treatments. Studies with 
the  longest  SE  interventions  (6–12  sessions)  also  pro-
vided  the  greatest  effects  in  the  treatment  of  posttrau-
matic  stress  (Andersen  et  al.,  2017;  Brom  et  al.,  2017). 
Consistently,  Changaris  (2010)  notes  that  a  significant 
reduction  in  depressive  symptoms  with  SE  was  only 
found  after  controlling  for  the  number  of  SE  sessions. 
We suggest that future studies may consider the number 
of  sessions  as  a  moderating  factor  for  the  treatment 
effects on both simple and complex trauma.

that research on SE is in an early stage. So far, it provides 
promising findings indicating that SE might be effective 
in  reducing  traumatic  stress,  affective  disorders,  and 
somatic symptoms and in improving life quality. In addi-
tion,  first  method-specific  key  factors  of  SE  have  been 
identified. SE seems to be characterized in particular by its 
cross-cultural  applicability  and  its  combinability  with 
other therapeutic procedures. The latter might be one of 
the  reasons  why  SE  attracts  growing  interest  in  clinical 
application despite the lack of empirical research. Yet, the 
current  evidence  base  is  weak  and  does  not  (yet)  fully 
accomplish  the  high  standards  for  clinical  effectiveness 
research.  Thus,  we  hope  that  this  review  encourages 
future  research  to  focus  on  extensive,  methodologically 
rigorous studies to ensure the efficacy and effectiveness of 
SE in the treatment of trauma-related disorders.
