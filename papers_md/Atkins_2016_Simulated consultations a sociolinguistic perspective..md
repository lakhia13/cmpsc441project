Simulated consultations: a sociolinguistic
perspective
Sarah Atkins1*, Celia Roberts2, Kamila Hawthorne3 and Trisha Greenhalgh4

Abstract

Background: Assessment of consulting skills using simulated patients is widespread in medical education. Most
research into such assessment is sited in a statistical paradigm that focuses on psychometric properties or
replicability of such tests. Equally important, but less researched, is the question of how far consultations with
simulated patients reflect real clinical encounters – for which sociolinguistics, defined as the study of language in its
socio-cultural context, provides a helpful analytic lens.

Discussion: In this debate article, we draw on a detailed empirical study of assessed role-plays, involving
sociolinguistic analysis of talk in OSCE interactions. We consider critically the evidence for the simulated
consultation (a) as a proxy for the real; (b) as performance; (c) as a context for assessing talk; and (d) as potentially
disadvantaging candidates trained overseas. Talk is always a performance in context, especially in professional
situations (such as the consultation) and institutional ones (the assessment of professional skills and competence).
Candidates who can handle the social and linguistic complexities of the artificial context of assessed role-plays
score highly – yet what is being assessed is not real professional communication, but the ability to voice a credible
appearance of such communication.
Summary: Fidelity may not be the primary objective of simulation for medical training, where it enables the
practising of skills. However the linguistic problems and differences that arise from interacting in artificial settings
are of considerable importance in assessment, where we must be sure that the exam construct adequately
embodies the skills expected for real-life practice. The reproducibility of assessed simulations should not be
confused with their validity. Sociolinguistic analysis of simulations in various professional contexts has identified
evidence for the gap between real interactions and assessed role-plays. The contextual conditions of the simulated
consultation both expect and reward a particular interactional style. Whilst simulation undoubtedly has a place in
formative learning for professional communication, the simulated consultation may distort assessment of
professional communication These sociolinguistic findings contribute to the on-going critique of simulations in
high-stakes assessments and indicate that further research, which steps outside psychometric approaches, is
necessary.

Background
This paper addresses issues arising from the use of simu-
lated patients in assessments of clinical consulting, in
particular the linguistic difficulties of interacting in such
settings and how far they reflect a practitioner’s real con-
sulting abilities. Simulated patients are lay people or pro-
fessional actors trained to portray a patient with a
particular condition in a standardised way. As well as
their use in practice and training for medical practi-
tioners, they play an important role in formal assess-
ment,
clinical
examination (OSCE) for undergraduates [1, 2] and licen-
sure examinations for postgraduates [3–5]. One advan-
tage of this assessment format is that it helps ensure
everyone has a standardised, equitable and repeatable
experience [6–8]. However, given that such exams can
demonstrate significant differences in pass rates between
demographic groups, such as, the Membership of the Royal
College of Physicians ‘Practical Assessment of Clinical
Examination Skills’ (PACES) exams and Membership of the
Royal College of General Practitioners’ Clinical Skills
Assessment (CSA) [9–11], the construct validity of simula-
tions is an important research question. Recreating a lin-
guistically authentic medical interaction may not be the
primary objective of simulation when used for medical
training, where it enables practice and focussing in on par-
ticular skills, particularly technical skills. Recent research
evidence has also shown the important uses of simulation
in communication skills training for medical teams, not
least because of the facility it provides practitioners to rec-
ord and reflect on how an interaction has unfolded [12].
However, the linguistic differences and difficulties of simu-
lation are of considerable importance in assessment. In
many high-stakes summative exams, the simulated consult-
ation is not used to enable the medical practitioner to re-
flect on and develop their own communication skills, but
rather for an external party to measure a candidate’s com-
petence and assign a grade. When using the simulated con-
sultation for assessment, particularly where interpersonal
and communication skills are being marked, we must be
sure that the exam construct and the linguistic require-
ments placed on candidates adequately embody the skills
expected for real-life practice.

The authenticity of the interaction is particularly per-
tinent when assessing communication skills. The clinical
consultation is not a technical procedure, but an emo-
tionally charged interpersonal interaction of high social
significance and linguistic complexity [13]. When con-
sidering the appropriateness of simulation in assessing
this complexity, we need a different kind of research -
sited in a humanistic rather than psychometric para-
digm. Sociolinguistic research provides a useful means
of interrogating and debating these issues. Sociolinguis-
tics is a field which systematically studies the way

language and society inter-relate. It looks at how people
use language in their everyday lives and how language-
in-context creates the complex social world. The tools of
sociolinguistic research are real recordings of spoken
language, to examine evidence of how different contexts
and social backgrounds affect the talk we produce and
how it is evaluated by others. This focus on evidence
from actual interactions is an important one here. Prior
research on simulated consultations has largely addressed
psychometric properties of particular tests and scenarios
such as internal consistency (e.g. using Cronbach’s alpha),
generalisability, inter-rater reliability, predictability (e.g. of
subsequent examination success), discriminatory power
(ability to distinguish consistently between ‘good’ and
‘poor’ examinees), as well as protocols and procedures for
quality control [3, 14–18]. A crucial question remains as
to how far such scenarios reflect real consulting abilities.
Both simulated patients and those being assessed, when
asked after the event, tend to rate their experience as ‘real-
istic’ [19, 20]. Various studies have also found that un-
announced simulated patients, trained to present with a
‘mystery shopper’ ap-
particular scenario in a kind of
proach, went undetected by medical practitioners [6, 21].
Yet there remain crucial differences between real and sim-
ulated consultations, particularly as they are used in as-
sessment, that cannot easily be evidenced by the mystery
shopper method or participants’ retrospective accounts.

Sociolinguistic analysis can unpick the subtly different
interactional discrepancies that a simulation produces.
It looks at direct evidence from the interactions pro-
duced in situ, rather than relying on asking participants
to reflect back on an interaction. Sociolinguistics often
‘discourse analysis’ to identify
employs techniques of
important features and fine-grained characteristics of
talk, such as grammatical structure, turn-taking be-
tween speakers, intonation and the integration of non-
verbal communication [22]. These can systematically
evidence the characteristic linguistic features that occur
in a particular setting - and how the talk is created by,
as well as constitutive of, the social relationships in that
context. Sociolinguistics is therefore interested in the
choices that speakers make when they use language and
what those choices and variations might mean for the
evaluation of speakers (page 16) [23].

Integrated with this theoretical approach in sociolinguis-
tics, is a fundamental interest in how language produces
power relations in society. Professional discourses in par-
ticular, which largely consist of goal-oriented encounters,
often demonstrate a degree of power-imbalance [24]. We
can evidence these power relationships in the ‘microphys-
ics’ and fine-grained detail of our everyday practices [25],
including our professional talk. There are asymmetrical
relationships in terms of who is expected to speak at cer-
tain points, who should show politeness and which

Atkins et al. BMC Medical Education  (2016) 16:16

speakers are meant to demonstrate their domain-specific,
professional knowledge [26]. Power relations in the setting
of an exam role-play differ from real-life clinical encoun-
ter, since the role-player has a very different position to
that of a patient and there is also a more powerful third
participant in the examiner, observing the interaction.
Given the different relationships of participants,
inter-
actional differences in simulated consultations compared
to real-life are perhaps to be expected. The environment
in assessed simulations is (intentionally) decontextualized
and scenarios involving invasive physical examinations [5]
and a range of patient groups such as those with multi-
morbidity, limited English or a very different communica-
tive style [27] are often (though not invariably) excluded.
Yet candidates are asked to behave as if these scenarios
were real [28, 29].

This

sociolinguistic

approach to language

and
professional communication was recently used in a 3-year
the Royal College of General Practitioners’
study of
Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) [27, 30], which we draw
upon in this paper. As well as this we draw on analytic
work around final-year undergraduate medical OSCEs by
Roberts et al. [31]. De La Croix and Skelton on under-
graduate OSCEs [32–34], Seale et al.’s linguistic study of
OSCE examinations [28], Niements on the use of role-
play in training [35], and O’Grady and Candlin on the
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' licens-
ing exam [36]. Some linguistic evidence on the use of
simulation for assessing professional communication out-
side the medical field is also drawn upon, particularly Sto-
koe’s [37, 38] account of
the linguistic patterns in
simulated police interviews. Evaluating this evidence col-
lectively helps us flesh out this debate paper with a fuller
picture of the complexities of using simulation. Although
simulated consultations and OSCE exams do vary in their
setup, some of the essential commonalities, like the semi-
scripted standardised part of role-players, the timed cases
and marking descriptors, render our sociolinguistic dis-
cussion relevant to this wide genre of assessment. The
paper addresses the following four themes, identified from
the literature review and our own research, in considering
the simulated consultation: (a) as a proxy for the real; (b)
as performance; (c) as a context for assessing talk and (d)
as potentially disadvantaging candidates trained overseas.

degree of standardisation of any scenario (hence, its replic-
ability) and its reflection of the real (its authenticity), since
100 % standardisation would require the simulated patient
to reproduce a script robotically. In reality, while the sim-
ulated patient plays a character and helps depict a context-
ual hinterland in answer to candidates’ questions, he or
she must draw on their own interactional resources to
manage the interaction itself [28].

To understand how simulations are experienced differ-
ently from real consultations, we must ask, “what ‘main-
tenance work’ needs to be done by both parties to
maintain the semblance of reality?”. To do this, we draw
on the work of sociologist Erving Goffman, whose sem-
inal essay ‘Frame Analysis’ addressed the question,
“under what circumstances do we think things are real?”
[39]. Goffman argued that the sense of feeling an activity
is real depends upon our sense of self as we relate to
others. Each interaction creates and reinforces a shared
reality to keep the relationship going [40]. We attend to
others, become involved in the to and fro of talk, how-
ever momentarily, since we have what Goffman calls a
moral requirement to display ourselves in ways that
others expect of us.

His concept of ‘frame’ describes this socially defined
reality. In any given stage of an encounter, speakers and
listeners establish or negotiate what is going on: we are
in the frame of a passing conversation, a preliminary
chat about the weather before the consultation proper
begins, an examination and so on. The frame constitutes
what is happening and also works as a filtering process
through which general principles of conduct apply. For
example, when a doctor tells a patient that chances of
recovery are high, both sides can understand that they
are in a ‘reassurance’ frame within this shared moment
of reality. Different frames can be invoked, and indeed
evidenced, through changes in linguistic behaviour by
the participants. For example, in a case from our CSA
research [27], a simulated patient presents with menor-
rhagia. The candidate indicates that he wants to do a
"quick abdominal examination", in the frame of a rou-
tine element of the diagnosis. But when he responds to
the simulated patient’s query by saying “we look for any

Social
interaction cannot ultimately be standardised.
While there are some relatively stable, overarching fea-
tures of a consultation, such as the phases to be per-
formed and the general history to be conveyed by the
patient, at the minute level of turn-by-turn talk stand-
ardisation becomes difficult and small differences in de-
livery are inevitable. There is a tension, then, between the

At any time in an encounter, Goffman argues (page
156–200) [39], we can experience multiple frames. For
example, in an OSCE-style exam, the frame of showing
empathy to a role-playing patient is nested in a frame of
displaying competence to an examiner, which in turn is
nested in the institutional frame of the overall assessment
process. For this reason, the values associated with em-
pathy are not seriously committed to or felt as real be-
cause they are anchored in a more fundamental frame,

is realistic,

related to simulated performance in the exam. While role-
player and trainee/candidate can put on a surface per-
formance that
the assessor must decide
whether the candidate is demonstrating ‘real caring’. This
makes any simulated consultation a hybrid activity in
which real qualities (subjectively experienced) are assessed
through the unreal, requiring a considerable amount of
interactional work to sustain the talk and illusion of a real
consultation [28].

Goffman calls an activity that does not fit within the
frame of the moment a ‘frame-break’. For example,
candidates in simulated consultations often do not
know whether they are expected to carry out a physical
examination ‘for real’. They may commence a physical
examination frame, only to be interrupted by the
examiner either verbally or by handing them a card
with key physical findings. Candidates must then rap-
idly shift frame to the preliminaries of diagnosis. We
found such shifts were typically marked by disfluencies
and/or hesitations, even with highly successful candi-
dates, as the candidate worked to maintain the simu-
lated case and ignore any interaction with the
examiner (page 53) [27]. To justify a simulated con-
sultation as a proxy for the real obscures its limitations
and complexities, many of which only become appar-
ent when analysing their interactional detail. It is in
this linguistic detail of simulations that we can really
identify the different communicative competences that
come to the fore in simulated consultations, which
may not be the competences required for real-life
practice.

The simulated consultation as performance
One of the concerns voiced about OSCE examina-
tions is that they test acting skills as much as they do
professional communication [30, 41]. Niements de-
scribes how role-played interactions "cannot reproduce
the orientations of real interactions...[W]hat is authentic
to those users when they “live” a specific situation can-
not be authentic to trainers/trainees when they play it"
[42] (p. 317). A number of studies have addressed the
‘acted’ behaviour such settings consequently
types of
produce, what de la Croix and Skelton have called "the
language game of role-play" [32]. Seale et al. explore
how different ‘frames’, real and fictitious, are invoked
through talk in simulations [28]. They find subtle mo-
ments in which attention is drawn to the fictitious na-
ture of
role-play, citing an example of humorous
comments made about an entirely invented paediatric
patient, that both the candidate and the role-player are
pretending is present (page 183). In their analysis, using
the fictitious nature of role-play to create humour is a
means for the candidate to achieve rapport with the
actor, not rapport with a ‘patient’. So there are multiple

roles and identities at play in simulations and these can
be evidenced in the communication. In answering the
question on ‘authenticity’, Seale et al. ultimately do sug-
gest that experience of participants in a role-play is fun-
damentally different from that of a real-life interaction
and that the candidate must do much more inter-
actional ‘work’ to keep the illusion up (page 181).

Of course, real consultations also require some level of
performance, but to properly understand the differences
we must unpack what ‘acting’ and ‘performing’ mean in
these interactional situations. To do so, we can draw on
Goffman’s depiction of life as drama – i.e. we present our-
selves on the world as a stage, ‘performing’ in different
ways to different ‘audiences’ in different settings (everyday,
professional, institutional and so on) [43]. We perform all
the time in the everyday, managing impressions of our-
selves in what Goffman called ‘facework’ [44].

Goffman distinguished the banal and intimate per-
formances of the everyday that occur ‘backstage’ from
professional behaviour, which is largely ‘front-stage’
[43] – a term he used to refer to activities like the
waiter at table, the doctor in the surgery or the teacher
in class. Here there are constraints on behaviour in
terms of manner, quality of attention and emotions,
and the performance has an ‘audience’ that evaluate
the competence displayed [45, 46]. Importantly, under-
standing professional behaviour as a performance does
not undercut its values. For example, to care for a pa-
tient may involve masking frustration or fatigue in
order to care better. When institutions require this
professional behaviour to be monitored and assessed,
however,
it becomes an institutional performance.
Evaluation of professional performance becomes insti-
tutionalised as observers rate and record performance
and implement rewards and sanctions. There is a
heightened awareness of the need, on the part of the
to perform expressively, a “heightened
professional,
mimicry” [28] and, on the part of the assessor, “a license
… to regard the act of expression and the performer
with special intensity” (page 11) [46]. However, it is im-
portant to make the distinction between a heightened
performance for institutional purposes (e.g. someone
pointedly looking in the mirror when taking a driving
test) and a simulated performance (someone pretending
to look in the mirror).

structed as an unreal activity. In her analysis of emotions
in theatre acting, Konijin discusses the way actors must
monitor how far the emotions they are acting out accord
with the inner model of what the play should convey
[47]. The actor’s task is not to convey sincere emotions
but to play out words and actions that convince the
audience of the authenticity of their character within the
terms of the drama. At the same time they monitor their

own experience of acting and so experience a ‘dual con-
sciousness’. In a simulation, likewise, the trainee or candi-
date has to work hard to create a synthetic reality – one
that convinces the audience/observer, but not one that is
real to candidates in terms of consequences for patients:
an institutionalised display rather than a professional in-
vestment, all the while monitoring their conduct vis-à-vis
the examiner. In sum, simulation is a multi-layered per-
formance for both role-player and candidate requiring
some of the skills of an actor.

The simulated consultation as a context for assessing talk
The design of OSCE-style exams bring five other com-
plexities, relating to the quality of talk to the candidate’s
task, adding burdens and reducing the ‘real’. We con-
sider: (i) the talk-heavy nature of the consultations; (ii)
the design and timing of cases; (iii) the shift of power to
the role-player; (iv) standardised scenarios but individual
emotional responses and (v) who fails such assessments
– and why? We establish these themes from the authors’
study of the CSA [27] and from an overview of the lin-
guistic research on simulations [28, 32–37], but draw on
these findings to debate the particular implications for
assessment.

The talk-heavy nature of the consultations
In simulated consultations, it is primarily talk-in-interaction
that is assessed. To succeed in simulated scenarios, candi-
dates must work harder or ‘over perform’, holding a higher
proportion of the conversational floor (between 67–77 %)
than in everyday consultations [34]. Research by Seale et al.
identifies the complex, additional linguistic work required
from candidates in simulations [28] and research on the
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ licensing
examination identified how role-played scenarios require a
complex, hybrid discourse from the GP candidate [36]. Col-
lectively, these findings suggest that simulated consultations
require actions and skills to be verbalised by the candidate
to a much greater degree than in everyday clinical work.

Talk in simulated assessments is also relatively decon-
textualized, without the shaping role of the computer
[27, 48] or any of the other props and interruptions of
real consultations. Decontextualised environments incur
more talk [49] and, in an environment such as this, lead
to talk becoming intensely focussed on. In addition,
there is no continuity of care, so shared, unspoken
knowledge between doctor and patient can play no part.
This potentially diminishes the types of relationships
and interactions that can be experienced by doctor and
patient in the simulated consultation. Relationship build-
ing over time and the deep values inherent in building
professional capability [50, 51] are overshadowed by an
externally timed case where surface skills must be made
explicit (e.g. enacted or voiced) for assessment. This

simultaneous amplification and reduction is most appar-
ent in the interpersonal domains of assessment, as we
discuss below.

The design and timing of cases
The design of cases for simulated consultations moves the
focus from the how of patient care to the why of the par-
ticular selected case. Both students and candidates are
primed to fear the trip-wire that comes with the case:
“learners sometimes think there are hidden aspects…they
are being asked to discover, akin to peeling away the skins
of an onion until the flesh is found” (page 67) [52].

In a high-stakes examination, this ‘Sherlock Holmes’
factor can mar or make success [27]. It turns the candi-
date into a timekeeper, dealing with concerns superfi-
cially so that the putative puzzle of the case can be
resolved. They may stop in mid-sentence when the whis-
tle blows or pack in questions or information as the last
minute ticks by. The strictly timed structure for simu-
lated consultations produces very different openings and
closings from that identified in real consultations. For
example, in real clinical encounters, doctors raising new
topics at the likely end of the encounter is rare but, con-
versely, closings are often extended conversational
exchanges which build the doctor-patient relationship
more generally [53].

The shift of power to the role-player
Sociolinguistic research has identified how asymmetrical
interactions, where one speaker has more power than
another, show small-scale differences in talk. Medical
consultations are necessarily asymmetrical. The move-
ment in recent years towards patient-centredness and
shared decision making has not fundamentally altered
this, since asymmetry stems at least partly from the
doctor’s knowledge [54]. But in simulated consultations,
candidates must manage the fact that “the power rela-
tion is inverted, because knowledge and judgment rest
with the simulated patient rather than with the physician
student” (page 266) [55]. De la Croix and Skelton iden-
tify a higher number of interruptions from role-players
across 100 third-year OSCE exams, suggesting a position
of greater interactional power compared to findings on
the linguistic behaviour of real-life patients [32–34]. Not
only do the simulated patients know the case and how it
should play out [34], but in examiner feedback sessions
for research on simulations [27], examiners noted that
the simulated patients positioned themselves in an
actorly manner. They put demands on candidates that
patients usually would not and showed familiarity with
the exigencies of the case through their language [27].

Evidence from outside medical education has also
shown the shift in power relations between speakers when
interacting in simulations. Stokoe conducts a nuanced

Atkins et al. BMC Medical Education  (2016) 16:16

account of the conversational inauthenticities of role-play
for police interviews [37], particularly the more elaborate
and sometimes humorous way in which conversational ac-
tions are performed in these false settings, where the
stakes for participants are entirely different from those
where a real defendant is being interviewed. There is lin-
guistic evidence, then, for how participants must orient
themselves in acted, simulated settings, monitoring their
performance and conducting extra linguistic work to
maintain the illusion of a real interaction.

Standardised scenarios but individual emotional responses
The role-player’s power is made more complex by the
shift from the institutional persona of the actor/patient
to the instinctive resources of the private person. In
other words, the role-player works with a hybrid of act-
ing behaviour and their own, individual interactional re-
sources. While careful training is used to standardise
‘patients’, the role-player is usually not working to a
tightly scripted part. He or she is given guidance to react
to the candidate in a natural way, to fulfil interactional
criteria (Table 1). If the candidate’s performance is un-
clear or irritating to the role-player, then the role-player
can respond in accord with their inner emotions (the ir-
ritation feels real, even though the setting is simulated).

All parties in fact, must draw on their own inter-
actional resources to make sense of the encounter. Even
where a middle class actor acts a convincingly troubled
and inarticulate teenager, they cannot gainsay their own
interpretive processes (e.g. they can mumble or remain
silent but they cannot not understand). Examiners not
only have to judge this hybrid of simulation and instinct-
ive resources, they also have to manage their own mix of
instinctive reactions to how others interact, their own
professional expectations and the formal categories of
the examination. As one said, “A lot of the time, I am
comparing them to me and what I’m used to” [27]. This
mix of habits of talk, interpretation and evaluation (on
the one hand) and standardised judgements (on the
other) are most problematic in the domain of interper-
sonal skills, where subjective interpretation is necessary
to interpret what counts as ‘rapport’ or ‘sensitivity’. This

became particularly evident in feedback sessions with
examiners, as the following section explores.

Who fails such assessments – and why?
We have noted the heavy focus on talk in simulated con-
sultations. Communication or interpersonal skills are
often explicitly assessed with their own marking criteria
in medical OSCEs, but can also become implicitly
judged across all other domains, since professional ac-
tions like data-gathering and clinical management must
also be performed through effective communication
[27]. The metric of reliability also tends to reinforce the
unspoken assumption that there is an implicit ‘best way’
of scoring highly in the interpersonal domain. Candidates
in simulated consultations routinely produce formulaic
phrases such as "Can you tell me a bit more about…" "I
understand how you feel" or "I’m sorry to hear about that",
with a greater frequency and often in different sequential
positions, than is found in real life practice [27]. Some of
these mimic the phrases recommended in communication
skills textbooks and their extensive use in simulations may
be inevitable in an environment in which talk is being ob-
served and assessed. This is a finding corroborated by
Roberts et al. [31] in a study of undergraduate medical
OSCEs, where the use of elicitation phrases such as "How
do you feel about that?" could be interpreted as sounding
overly trained if used in the wrong location (page 8–9). In
an essay on the experience of being a role-player evalu-
ating candidates in US medical exams, Jamison points
out that to gain marks, empathy and compassion must
be ‘voiced’ and that (perhaps as a consequence) candi-
dates seemed either aggressively formulaic in their in-
sistence, "that must be really hard", or saturated with
humility "Would you mind if I – listened to your heart?"
(page 4–5) [56]. There have been similar findings on
simulations in professional settings outside medicine,
such as Stokoe’s research on police interview role-plays,
in which communication directives from training man-
uals are overtly used in the openings, in a way which
they are not in real-life police interviews, potentially for
the benefit of a marker [38].

It seems to be a consequence of the assessed, simulated
setting then, that participants use these formulaic, trained
professional phrases and interactional moves with a much
higher frequency than real-life. In exams such as the CSA,
high scoring candidates also produce 32 % more of these
exam-modelled utterances than weaker candidates. Yet
these phrases appear much less frequently in real consul-
tations [27]. Interestingly, weaker CSA candidates who
also produce these types of phrases, albeit slightly less fre-
quently, were assessed as formulaic in examiner feedback:

It seems just very formulaic and a lot of it seems
learned. ‘I understand why you would be worried’,

Atkins et al. BMC Medical Education  (2016) 16:16 

Page 7 of 9

‘What kind of thought went through your mind when
you made this appointment’ which kind of is an
attempt to do the right thing but to me it just felt
very crass… [27]

Detailed analysis of stronger candidates’ talk showed
that they knew how to play the game: they customised
formulaic phrases so they sounded more real and sin-
cere, adding in little hesitations, colloquialisms and
changes in intonation (page 59–61) [27]. In such cir-
cumstances, the ‘empathy telling’, already a simulation of
feeling and perception, has to be further worked on to
invoke a convincing suspension of disbelief: a double
simulation or to extend Konijin’s concept of ‘dual con-
sciousness’ [47], a ‘triple consciousness’, consisting of the
candidate’s own sense of themselves as professionals, the
consciousness that they must simulate a professional en-
counter – and in addition within the institutional frame
– must work on the formulaic phrases of the simulation
so that they sound more sincere to examiners. It is in
these small details of talk, here in the small variations in
delivery of exam-modelled phrases, that we can see how
power and social relationships are constituted in the
micropractices of interaction and its evaluation [25].

In terms of construct validity, does the simulated con-
sultation measure what it purports: the interpersonal
capabilities expected of a doctor? The answer is a com-
plex one. Though the simulation may be good at testing
skills such as giving explanations and structuring the
consultation, there are a number of linguistic features
which do not mimic real-life practice. For example, it
examines competence in using additional communica-
tive resources to make exam-induced ‘voiced’ phrases
sound sincere and to manage the triple consciousness
required to perform to examiners. In terms of assess-
ment theory, there is a "construct-irrelevant variance"
[57] in which certain know-how is assessed which is not
a requirement of real consultations.

Simulated consultations as potentially disadvantaging
candidates trained overseas
While all assessments may require ‘exam skills’ to some
degree, when one group of candidates fares much worse
than another, as occurs in many of these assessments [27],
the fairness of
these exam-constructed requirements
needs to be carefully considered. There is wide recogni-
tion that for many candidates trained outside their home
country for the assessment, simulations are often a new
phenomenon and that, like any type of assessment, lack of
familiarity affects performance [58]. The simple solution
offered is that this group need more practice with simula-
tions. However, detailed sociolinguistic analysis suggests
that simulations may cause difficulties for this group of
candidates in other ways as well.

As indicated above, simulations lead to more talk,
more formulaic phrases and more work to ensure that
such talk sounds sincere. This focus on talk and how it
sounds in contexts of intense assessment puts particular
pressure on those whose style of communicating is dif-
ferent from the majority of examiners and also, perhaps,
the patient role-players. Small differences in such subtle
features as intonation, word stress and other small
markers of speech can be amplified and read off as
showing negative characteristics, such as formulaic re-
sponses or not engaging, attracting lower marks in the
interpersonal (page 32–73) [27]. Additionally, since it
can be difficult to make standardised, simulated cases re-
flect the same variation as real-life consulting, perform-
ance will not reflect the ability to interact effectively and
flexibly with a diverse patient population. In many such
exams, while UK graduates are not assessed on consult-
ing in linguistically challenging situations, International
Medical Graduates, many of whom consult regularly in
another expert language within the British multi-cultural
context, have no opportunity to display this skill as they
might use it in their everyday practice. Such competence
in linguistically and culturally challenging situations is
increasingly important for medical practitioners treating
diverse patient populations, both in the UK and globally.
It is perhaps the biggest challenge for assessing medical
practitioners’ interpersonal competence in our modern-
day context of globalised, mobile and diverse societies.

Summary
A review of sociolinguistic approaches to simulations
demonstrates that simulated assessment, even when it is
‘realistic’, shows some crucial differences to the communi-
cative competences found in real-life practice. Talk is al-
ways a performance in context and in simulations, the
role-playing patient, the candidate and the examiner all
have to work hard to maintain the illusion. Candidates
who can handle the social and linguistic complexity of this
somewhat artificial, standardised situation score highly –
yet what is being assessed is not real communication but
the ability to voice a credible appearance of such commu-
if communication skills are
nication.
assessed purely through simulated patients, this may not
reflect the real consulting abilities of candidates. We must
question whether simulations replace the values–led de-
velopment of medical students with ‘playing the game’ of
simulation [50, 51, 59]. The ability of doctors to form en-
during therapeutic relationships with patients may not be
adequately reflected in the “colonisation [of medicine] by
the technologies of the unreal” [60].

The discipline of sociolinguistics offers an evidenced
approach to these questions around professional com-
munication. In this paper, we have introduced three core
sociolinguistic concepts relevant to the assessment of

communication in medicine: that the particular variety
of talk in simulated consultations separates it out from
the talk in real consultations; that the notion of ‘frame’
is used to understand how we relate to and make our
talk real to each other and that this reality breaks down
in institutionally assessed communication; and that
micro-features of talk feed constantly into our evaluation
of others and, in high-stakes assessments, can have large
consequences on the trajectory of an interaction. While
a single awkward moment is unlikely to lead to failure,
in settings of intense evaluation, perceived infelicities
such as an unfilled pause or formulaic phrase become
amplified. The cumulative effect of such micro-features
may lead to a candidate being judged as "not developing
rapport" or as showing inadequate responsiveness to
"verbal and non-verbal cues" and an overall negative im-
pression of interpersonal abilities.

Although a number of studies have identified that sim-
ulated interactions show important differences from
real-life professional communication [27, 28, 33–37], we
are not arguing that simulation has no place in teaching
or assessment. Much of medical practice consists of
skills that are more or less technical in nature and which
can be both taught and assessed effectively using simu-
lated patients (the rationale behind the ‘skills lab’) [61].
Formative simulated consultations have great value in
the safety they afford learners to make and learn from
mistakes, as well as to ‘slow down’ the consultation to
study what has happened. Summative simulated assess-
ments, however, must carefully consider the difficulties
of assessing interpersonal skills in this setting. Hence, we
do not seek to bury the OSCE, but in introducing the
sociolinguistic perspective, we do seek to debate its level
of validity for assessing communicative and interactional
aspects of clinical performance. Furthermore, we believe
the evidence identified in a number sociolinguistic studies
of simulated interaction [27, 30, 58] requires us to con-
sider carefully what we mean by ‘fairness’ in assessment
and how we might better assess communication skills in
settings of cultural and linguistic diversity.
