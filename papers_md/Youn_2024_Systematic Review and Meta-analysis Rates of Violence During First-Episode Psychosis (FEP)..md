Background:   Most people with psychotic disorders will 
never commit an act of violence. However, the risk of vi-
olence committed by people with schizophrenia is higher 
than the general population. Violence risk is also known 
to  be  highest  during  the  first  episode  of  psychosis  com-
pared  to  later  stages  of  illness.  Despite  this,  there  have 
been no comprehensive reviews conducted in the past 10 
years examining rates of violence during FEP. We aimed 
to  provide  an  updated  review  of  the  rate  of  violence  in 
people  with  FEP.  Study  Design:    Meta-analytical  tech-
niques  were  used  to  identify  pooled  proportions  of  vio-
lence according to severity (less serious, serious, severe) 
and timing of violence (before presentation, at first pres-
entation,  after  presentation  to  services).  Study  Results:  
Twenty-two studies were included. The pooled prevalence 
was  13.4%  (95%  CI  [9.0%–19.5%])  for  any  violence, 
16.3%  (95%  CI  [9.1%–27.4%])  for  less  serious  vio-
lence, 9.7% (95% CI [5.4%–17.0%]) for serious violence 
and  2.7%  for  severe  violence,  regardless  of  time  point. 
The pooled prevalence of any violence was 11.6% (95% 
CI  [6.8%–18.9%])  before  presentation,  20.8%  (95% 
CI  [9.8%–38.7%])  at  first  presentation  and  13.3% 
(95%  CI  [7.3%–23.0%])  after  presentation  to  services. 
Conclusion:  Overall, rates of violence appear to be lower 
in more recent years. However, due to the high between-
study heterogeneity related to study design, the findings 
must  be  interpreted  with  consideration  of  sample  char-
acteristics and other contextual factors. The prevalence 
of violence remained high at all-time points, suggesting 
that more targeted, holistic, and early interventions are 
needed for clinical FEP groups.

Introduction

Violence  typically  refers  to  behavior  involving  physical 
force towards other people and is often categorized based 
on severity, such as less serious, serious, and severe violence, 
within the psychosis literature.1 Violence is also measured 
using  different  methods,  such  as  self-reports  and  patient 
interviews; however, there are notable inconsistencies across 
studies.2,3 The general community, media, and governments 
often assume that individuals with severe mental illnesses 
such as psychotic disorder (eg, schizophrenia) and bipolar 
disorder are more likely to commit violence.4 Past reviews 
have also identified a higher incidence of violence in people 
with  schizophrenia  spectrum,4  personality  and  substance 
use  disorders,  compared  to  other  psychiatric  illnesses.5 
Although most people with psychotic disorders will never 
commit violence, the risk of violence committed by people 
with schizophrenia is up to four to six times higher than 
the  general  population.6–9  Compared  to  later  and  more 
chronic stages of illness, the risk of violence perpetration is 
usually highest during the first episode of psychosis (FEP; 
up to 20-fold), with rates of any type of violence between 
35% and 39% during this early illness phase.1,10 People ex-
periencing  FEP  are  considered  an  important  group  for 
early intervention, due to risks of poor long-term clinical 
and functional outcomes, especially if there is a history of 
violence-related incarceration.11–13

Access  to  appropriate  psychiatric  care  may  be  one 
reason  for  the  decline  in  violence  over  the  course  of 
psychosis.8,10  One  systematic  review8  compared  rates  of 
homicide before and after treatment, and found that the 
annual rate of homicide was 15.5 times greater in people 
with FEP not treated for psychosis, compared to those 
who  were  treated.  Similarly,  one  longitudinal  study  re-
ported  that  after  treatment  initiation  (antipsychotic 
medication  or  hospitalization  to  manage  severe  psy-
chotic symptoms), up to 10 years since first entry to serv-
ices, the rates of violence in people with FEP reduced to 
a  level  similar  to  that  seen  in  the  general  population.14 
While  these  findings  highlight  the  potential  effects  of 
treatment in reducing the incidence of violence, they also 
suggest that the early stage of illness (ie, FEP), particu-
larly before appropriate treatment initiation (ie, duration 
of untreated psychosis [DUP], which refers to the period 
between  the  onset  of  psychotic  symptoms  and  start  of 
treatment),7,15,16  is  a  time  of  vulnerability  for  violence 
perpetration.

Despite the incidence of violence being highest during 
FEP, there are very few recent reviews examining violence 
specifically  during  this  early  stage,  with  most  including 
studies published between 1992 and 2011.1,7,10,17 Further, 
most studies only report the overall rate of violence, and 
the  prevalence  of  different  severities  of  violence  (eg, 
less  serious,  serious,  severe)  are  inconsistently  reported. 
Consequently,  the  current  rates  of  violence  are  unclear, 
and an updated review is needed. Although we aimed to 
conduct an updated review of the past 10 years, a broader 
time frame of 20 years was selected to capture the expan-
sion of specialist early intervention (SEI) services for psy-
chosis, which have been more broadly implemented over 
the  past  two  decades.18,19  Systematic  review  and  meta-
analysis  techniques  were  used  to  address  the  following 
question:  “what  are  the  rates  of  violence,  according  to 
severity,  in  people  with  FEP  in  more  recent  years  (i.e., 
past 20 years)?”

Methods

Protocol Registration

This  study  was  pre-registered  with  the  International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; 
registration  number:  CRD42021277673)  on  8  October 
2021.

Search Strategy

The  initial  search  strategy  was  developed  by  analysing 
the title and abstract of 22 relevant studies,11,14,20–39 which 
were identified via Google Scholar. Four search plans (see 
Supplementary tables 1–4) were used to identify studies 
in  MEDLINE,  Embase,  PsycINFO,  and  CINAHL. 
The  search  was  limited  to  studies  in  English  published 
between  2000  and  2023  (inclusive).  All  searches  were 

758

conducted on February 4, 2023. Additionally, the refer-
ence lists of relevant reviews were hand searched for ad-
ditional articles.

Definition of Violence

Violence  was  defined  as  physical  violence  perpetrated 
towards  other  people,  as  measured  by  and/or  classified 
using any method (eg, self-reports, interviews, police re-
cords). Studies referring to verbal aggression, violent vic-
timization, and violence towards objects and the self (eg, 
suicide, self-harm) were excluded.

Violence  was  further  grouped  according  to  severity, 
based on definitions from Large and Nielssen,1 to allow for 
comparisons with existing reviews: (1) less serious violence 
(physical violence against other people not causing injury 
and without weapon use); (2) serious violence (physical vio-
lence causing any degree of injury with or without weapon 
use or any sexual assault); (3) severe violence (physical vi-
olence towards others resulting in serious injury requiring 
treatment  in  hospital  or  permanent  physical  harm);  and 
(4) any violence (any form of physical violence perpetrated 
towards other people). The term “any violence” was used 
when the severity of violence was not specified.

Inclusion Criteria

Participants  Studies  were  included  if  participants  had 
a diagnosis of FEP of any non-affective (schizophrenia, 
schizophreniform  disorder,  brief  psychotic  disorder,  de-
lusional disorder) or affective psychotic disorder (bipolar 
disorder,  schizoaffective  disorder,  major  depressive  dis-
order with psychotic features), or psychotic disorder not 
otherwise  specified  (NOS).  As  recommended  by  a  pre-
vious review,40 FEP was defined broadly as the early stage 
of psychotic illness, not necessarily the first “episode” of 
psychosis. Although it has been recommended to define 
FEP  based  on  duration  of  illness  (typically  around  2–5 
years from first diagnosis), we did not include restrictions 
around the period of illness to ensure that relevant studies 
were not excluded. Studies were excluded if they: (1) did 
not specify whether participants were experiencing FEP 
or  early  psychosis;  (2)  did  not  use  a  well-validated  di-
agnostic  tool  (eg,  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of 
Mental Disorders [DSM], International Classification of 
Diseases [ICD]); (3) did not specify method of diagnosis; 
and/or  (4)  only  included  forensic  samples  (eg,  prison 
populations). Although the age of onset for FEP is typi-
cally during adolescence and early adulthood between 15 
and 30 years,41 as FEP can occur at any age,42 there was 
no limitation on the age of participants. Diagnoses such 
as bipolar disorder were included to allow for greater gen-
eralizability, and to be more inclusive of samples given bi-
polar disorder and manic symptoms are often overlooked 
in existing violence and FEP literature.43

Violence  Studies were included if  the prevalence of  vi-
olence was reported (% or n). There was no time limit on 
when  the  violence  was  committed  (eg,  at  presentation, 
before or after first entry to service). Studies only exam-
ining  aggression  were  included  if   aggression  included 
physical violence towards others. Similar to existing re-
views  (eg,  Large  and  Nielssen1),  studies  were  excluded 
if   they  claimed  to  assess  verbal  aggression  or  violence 
towards the self  or objects only, and not in addition to 
physical  violence  towards  other  people.  Studies  were 
excluded if  they claimed to assess violence but did not 
specify  whether  this  included  violence  towards  other 
people.

Procedure

The  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for 
the guide screening and selection of studies as well as re-
porting of findings.44

Study  Selection  During  the  first  stage,  two  researchers 
(SY and SM) independently screened titles and abstracts 
of  studies,  using  broad  inclusion  criteria.  Studies  were 
selected if: (1) participants were diagnosed with FEP of 
any  psychotic  disorder;  and  (2)  violence  or  aggression 
was  assessed.  Studies  were  still  included  if  FEP  status 
was not specified. In the next stage, full-text articles were 
screened  by  SY  and  SM  according  to  the  full  inclusion 
criteria  above.  Lastly,  studies  with  overlapping  samples 
were identified and excluded if the study was: (1) not the 
original study (ie, later publication year) or (2) included 
limited  information  about  measurement,  definition,  or 
classification of violence compared to the original study. 
Screening  was  conducted  via  Covidence  (Covidence 
Systematic  Review  Software),  and  all  conflicts  were  re-
solved via discussion.

Data Extraction  The following variables were extracted 
independently  by  SY  and  SM:  author;  year  of  publica-
tion;  title;  country;  recruitment  method;  recruitment 
period; sample size; sample demographics (age, gender); 
diagnostic  method;  method  of  classification,  measure-
ment, or definition of violence; timing of violence; rate 
and  proportion  of  violence.  For  studies  that  reported 
separate  rates  for  violence  towards  others,  self,  and/
or objects, only the rate of violence towards others was 
included. If studies did not include specific rates for vi-
olence towards others, but reported an overall rate of un-
specified violence, the latter was included.

Quality Appraisal of Studies

The methodological quality of studies was assessed by SY 
and  SM  using  an  adapted  version  of  the  Joanna  Briggs 
Institute  (JBI)  Critical  Appraisal  Checklist  for  Studies 

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Violence and FEP

Reporting  Prevalence  Data  (see  Supplementary  table  5). 
This is 9 item scale pertaining to quality of methodologies 
used  in  a  study.  A  response  of  “yes,”  “no,”  or  “unsure” 
was given for each item. “Yes” responses were scored “1” 
whilst “no” and “unsure” responses were scored “0.”

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using R Version 4.1.1 
(R Core Team, 2020). The metaprop function was used 
to  calculate  pooled  proportions  of  violence,  according 
to severity: less serious violence, serious violence, severe 
violence, and any violence. When calculating the pooled 
proportions of violence, non-independent samples were 
excluded.  To  do  this,  when  studies  reported  rates  of 
violence across multiple timepoints for all types of vio-
lence (ie, any, less serious, serious, severe violence), only 
the  rate  of  violence  at  one  timepoint  (at  presentation 
or  the  earliest  timepoint)  was  included  for  each  single 
analysis.

Additional  pooled  proportions  were  calculated  for 
any  violence  at  different  timepoints,  regardless  of  se-
verity:  before  presentation  (at  least  3  months  or  un-
specified period before presentation to services), at first 
presentation  (“baseline”  or  less  than  3  months  before 
or  after  first  presentation  to  services),  and  after  pres-
entation  to  services  (at  least  3  months  since  treatment 
initiation).  For  these  analyses,  studies  were  excluded  if 
they did not specify the timepoint at which violence was 
committed.  Due  to  the  small  number  of  studies,  this 
timepoint  was  not  separated  into  additional  subgroups 
(eg,  1-year   follow-up,  2-year  follow-up).  Considerable 
between-study heterogeneity was expected due to differ-
ences in variables such as age, sociodemographic factors, 
definition, measurement, and  timing of violence across 
studies. Given this, a  random-effects model was chosen a 
priori to calculate pooled proportions. Heterogeneity of 
studies was assessed using Cochran’s Q and I2 statistic. 
I2 values greater than 75% indicated very high heteroge-
neity.45  Publication  bias  was  assessed  using  Egger’s  test 
and  P-Curve  analysis,  unless  between-study  heteroge-
neity  was  high  (I2 > 75%),  as  the  results  are  considered 
non-acceptable.46

Sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  using  subgroup 
analyses (update.meta function) to compare pooled pro-
portions of violence between timepoints (before presen-
tation, at first presentation, after presentation to service). 
Meta-regression  analyses  (metareg  function)  were  also 
conducted  to  compare  rates  of  violence  according  to 
publication year.

studies. Following the removal of 1543 duplicates, 1967 
studies  were  determined  as  not  relevant  based  on  title 
and  abstract  screening,  and  an  additional  161  studies 
were  excluded  following  full-text  screening.  This  led  to 
the  inclusion  of  22  studies  (see  figure  1  for  PRISMA 
flowchart). Table 1 outlines relevant study details for in-
cluded  studies.  There  was  a  total  of  8284  participants 
across  studies  (M  sample  size = 376.5,  SD = 576.1), 
with  the  percentage  of  males  ranging  between  51.4%39 
and 85.5%,47 and mean age ranging between 18.526 and 
33.3  years.30  FEP  diagnoses  were  generally  broad  and 
included  all  psychotic  disorders  (eg,  schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder) or mood disorders (eg, bipolar 
disorder, major depressive disorder) with psychotic fea-
tures,  usually  based  on  the  DSM-IV  and  ICD-10  cri-
teria.  A  majority  of  studies  included  samples  from 
both inpatient and general community outpatient serv-
ices,22,25–28,32,47,48 inpatient and SEI outpatient services,30,36 

SEI  outpatient  services  for  FEP  only,11,14,39,49,50  hospital 
inpatient  services  only,12,43,51–54  and  community  outpa-
tient  mental  health  services  only.21  Most  studies  were 
conducted in the United Kingdom (22.7%) and United 
States  (18.2%).  Approximately  17  disagreements  were 
identified  and  all  were  resolved  through  discussion. 
See figure 1 for a flowchart with the number of studies 
screened,  excluded,  and  included  for  analysis,  with 
reasons for exclusion.

Definition, Measurement, and Classification of Violence

Studies varied greatly with respect to operationalizations 
of violence (including the method of assessment, defini-
tion,  and  timing  of  violence;  see  table  2).  Violence  was 
usually defined broadly, and at times, based on definitions 
from  previous  studies,  dictionaries,  or  standardized  as-
sessment  tools  (eg,  Psychiatric  and  Personal  History

coercion, child molestation, indecent exposure, or sexual ha-
rassment), illegal threats or intimidation”.
Violent behavior defined as “an act involving use of physical 
force which is intended to hurt or injure another person”. 
Serious violence defined as “assault resulting in injury or 
involving use of a weapon, threat with a weapon or sexual 
assault.” Other violence (ie, less serious violence) defined as 
“assault without injury or weapon use.” Definitions based on 
MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study57
Minor violence (ie, less serious violence) defined as “simple 
assault without injury or weapon use.” Serious violence de-
fined as “assault resulting in injury or involving use of a lethal 
weapon, threat with a lethal weapon, or sexual assault”
Violence defined as “physical harm towards others”

Violence defined as “physical assault, threat with a weapon, 
arson, or other extensive property damage”

included  the  Modified  Overt  Aggression 
measures 
Scale  (MOAS),56  the  MacArthur  Community  Violence 
Instrument (MCVI),57 and the Psychiatric and Personal 
History  Schedule  (PPHS).58  Overall,  there  were  incon-
sistencies in the type of behavior that was measured (see 
Supplementary  table  6).  Most  instruments  (eg,  ABQ, 
LHA, MOAS, PPHS, SOAS-R) assessed for a wide range 
of  behaviors  including  verbal  aggression,  violence  to-
wards  self,  others,  and  objects.  Other  measures  focused 
on physical violence towards others only (eg, MCVI) or 
past  forensic  history  (eg,  EPFQ).  Occasionally,  studies 
did not include subscales that were deemed irrelevant to 
their study (eg, suicide and self-harm).59 Incidents of vio-
lence and aggression were usually rated on a Likert or di-
chotomous scale (yes/no), and the frequency of behaviors 
were occasionally reported.

In terms of classification, violence was usually grouped 
based  on  severity  level  and  timing  of  violence.  Several 
studies categorized violence into “any” and “serious” vi-
olence and had definitions similar to those of the current 
review. However, the time periods were highly varied. The 
timepoint  before  treatment  (ie,  “before  presentation  to 

services”)  ranged  from  an  undefined  period11,12,27,36,39,53,54 
to  3  months  before  treatment  initiation,26  and  the 
 follow-up  period  (ie,  “after  presentation  to  services”) 
ranged between 4 weeks43 and 10 years14 following entry 
to services (see table 2). These services typically included 
specialized  early  intervention  programs,39,50  hospital  ad-
missions,14,43  and  other  unspecialized  treatments  in  the 
broader community.32

Quality Appraisal

Table 1 includes a summary of quality scores for included 
studies. Item five from the original measure was excluded 
as  there  were  no  subgroup  analyses  in  the  included 
studies. Item nine was also excluded as we did not con-
duct  a  survey  study  and  hence,  low  response  rates  were 
not applicable. An overall score was given for each study, 
with  a  potential  maximum  score  of  7.  Approximately 
10  disagreements  were  identified  and  were  all  resolved 
through discussion. Quality scores ranged between 012,52 
and  6,21,39  and  the  average  score  was  3.68.  Most  studies 
included  representative  samples  with  large  sample  sizes 

763

S. Youn et al

and provided sufficient information about the sample and 
study setting. About half of the studies recruited partici-
pants  from  both  inpatient  and  community  services  and 
collected data consistently across researchers. Only a few 
studies (11 studies) used standardized measurement tools 
or existing definitions for assessing violence. No studies 
reported all relevant statistics (n, %, CI).

Meta-analysis of Rates of Violence According to 
Severity

Any  Violence  A  meta-analysis  of   17  studies11,12,14,21,27, 
28,30,32,39,43,47,48,50,51,54  including  4269  participants,  found  a 
pooled prevalence of  13.4% (95% CI [9.0%–19.5%]) for 
any  violence,  regardless  of   timepoint  (ie,  before  pres-
entation,  at  first  presentation  or  after  presentation  to 
services).  This  value  included  less  serious,14,21,39,49,55  se-
rious,11,12,14,21,22,25–27,30,32,39,48,50,51  and  severe25,43,50,51  vio-
lence.  The  prevalence  of   any  violence  ranged  between 
3.8%50  and  43.6%.47  The  between-study  heterogeneity 
was  very  high  (I2 = 95.3%,  95%  CI  [93.7%–96.5%]; 
Q = 340.4,  df = 16,  P < .0001).  The  exclusion  of   out-
liers  led  to  lower  between-study  heterogeneity  (I2  = 
84.8%  vs  95.3%)  however,  outliers  were  not  removed 
as the between-study heterogeneity remained high (I2 > 
75), and the removal of  outliers led to a large reduction 
in  sample  size  (from  17  to  11  studies).  Supplementary 
figure  1  displays  a  forest  plot  of   included  studies  and 
relevant statistics.

Less  Serious  Violence  Four  studies21,25,32,49  reported  the 
prevalence  of  less  serious  violence.  The  pooled  propor-
tion  was  16.3%  (95%  CI  [9.1%–27.4%])  amongst  1230 
participants (see Supplementary figure 2), and the prev-
alence  ranged  between  11.5%25  and  26.4%.21  Between-
study  heterogeneity  was  very  high  (I2 = 90.9%,  95%  CI 
[79.7%–95.9%]; Q = 33.3, df = 3, P = .0001). No outliers 
were identified.

Serious Violence  The pooled prevalence of serious vio-
lence, regardless of time period was 9.7% (95% CI [5.4%–
17.0%];  see  Supplementary  figure  3).  This  value  was 
pooled from seven studies,21,25,30,32,36,39,49,55 which included 
a  total  of  2208  participants.  The  prevalence  of  serious 
violence  ranged  between  2.6%25  and  19.6%.49  Between-
study  heterogeneity  was  very  high  (I2 = 91.6%,  95%  CI 
[85.3%–95.2%]; Q = 88.3, df = 6, P < .0001). No outliers 
were identified.

Severe Violence  Two studies26,53 reported rates of severe 
violence. The pooled proportion was 2.2% (95% CI [0.0%–
61.7%])  based  on  414  participants  (see  Supplementary 
figure  4),  and  ranged  between  0.0%26  and  2.7%.53  There 
was  no  between-study  heterogeneity  (I2 = 0.0%)  or 
outliers.

Meta-analysis of Rates of Any Violence According to 
Timing of Violence

Before Presentation to Services  The pooled proportion of 
any violence before entry to services was 11.6% (95% CI 
[6.8%–18.9%]; see Supplementary figure 5). This figure was 
pooled from 11 studies,11,12,21,22,26–28,32,39,50,54 which included a 
total of 3415 participants. The prevalence ranged between 
3.8%50  and  38.2%.21  Between-study  heterogeneity  was 
very high (I2 = 96.5%, 95% CI [95.1%–97.5%]; Q = 284.3, 
df = 10, P < .0001). Although the removal of outliers led 
to a small reduction in between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 
83.6% vs 96.5%), the heterogeneity remained very high (I2 
> 75), and the removal led to a reduction in sample size 
(from 11 to 9 studies). Hence, outliers were not removed.

At  First  Presentation  to  Services  A  meta-analysis  of 
five  studies22,25,30,47,52  with  955  participants  revealed  a 
pooled proportion of 20.8% (95% CI [9.8%–38.7%]; see 
Supplementary figure 6) for any violence at first presen-
tation to services. The prevalence ranged between 8.3%52 
and 43.6%.47 Between-study heterogeneity was very high 
(I2 = 88.8%,  95%  CI  [76.6%–94.7%];  Q = 35.8,  df = 4, 
P < .0001). No outliers were identified.

Following  Treatment  Initiation  Five  studies14,32,39,43,50  re-
ported  rates  of  violence  following  entry  to  services, 
amongst a total of 1525 participants. The pooled propor-
tion of any violence following treatment initiation (ie, since 
first entry to services) was 13.3% (95% CI [7.3%–23.0%]) 
and  the  prevalence  ranged  between  7.3%14  and  23.4%32 
(see Supplementary figure 7). The between-study hetero-
geneity was very high (I2 = 91.3%, 95% CI [82.6%–95.6%]; 
Q = 45.9, df = 4, P < .0001). No outliers were found.

Comparison of Pooled Proportions Across Timepoints  The 
pooled  proportion  was  highest  at  first  presentation  to 
services  (20.8%)  compared  to  other  timepoints  (before 
presentation,  after  presentation  to  services)  and  there 
was a decrease in the pooled proportion of violence fol-
lowing entry to services (20.8% vs 13.3%). Subgroup ana-
lyses revealed statistically significant differences in pooled 
proportions  across  timepoints  (before  presentation, 
at  presentation,  after  treatment  initiation;  17  studies, 
Q = 7.0,  df = 2,  P = .03).  Additional  subgroup  analyses 
revealed  significantly  lower  rates  of  any  violence  after 
first  presentation  (ie,  following  treatment)  compared  to 
rates  before  service  contact  (12  studies,  Q = 0.6,  df = 1, 
P = .45;  risk  ratio = 1.01,  standard  error = 0.03)  and  at 
initial  contact  with  services  (7  studies,  Q = 7.0,  df = 6, 
P < .0001;  risk  ratio = 1.61,  standard  error = 0.06). 
There  were  no  significant  differences  in  rates  of  any  vi-
olence  before  versus  at  first  presentation  to  services  (15 
studies,  Q = 2.7,  df = 1,  P = .10).  According  to  meta-
regression analyses, later publication year (ie, more recent 

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Violence and FEP

publication year) was significantly associated with lower 
rates of violence (19 studies, β = −.08, 95% CI = [−0.15, 
−0.02], P = .04; see figure 2).

Frequency  of  Violent  Episodes  Only  two  studies26,32  in-
cluded  additional  information  about  the  frequency  of 
violent  behavior.  One  study32  reported  six  episodes  of 
less serious and 14 incidents of serious violence amongst 
participants before presentation to services, and an addi-
tional 121 and 25 episodes of less serious and serious vi-
olence, respectively, after treatment initiation. In another 
study,26 25 people engaged in one to three episodes of vi-
olent episodes, five people had 4–10 incidents, and only 
one person had over 10 episodes of violence prior to first 
presentation to services.

Discussion

This  study  is  the  first  comprehensive  review  conducted 
in  the  past  10  years  to  specifically  examine  violence  ac-
cording to both severity (ie, less serious, serious, severe) 
and the time point at which violence was committed (ie, 
before  treatment,  at  first  presentation  to  services,  after 
treatment initiation), during FEP. This provided greater 
detail  regarding  the  nature  of  the  violence  perpetrated 
and  the  potential  impacts  of  treatment  on  reducing 
violence.

There  are  three  main  findings.  First,  the  overall  rate 
of  any  violence  in  people  with  FEP,  regardless  of  time 
point (13.4%), was lower than those reported in older re-
views1,10,17  (between  28%17  and  35.4%1)  however,  similar 
to a more recent study,60 which found reported a preva-
lence of 20.3%. Our findings also revealed lower rates of 
serious  violence  (9.7%)  compared  to  previous  findings, 

which  have  reported  pooled  proportions  between  13%17 
and  16.6%.1,10  One  explanation  for  this  decline  is  the 
potential  effects  of  SEI  services,  which  have  been  more 
broadly  implemented  over  the  past  20  years.18,19  SEI 
programs  differ  from  standard  treatment  practices  by 
focusing  on  the  early  detection  of  people  experiencing 
prodromal  symptoms  and  preventing  the  onset  of  psy-
chotic illness in these groups. These services aim to pre-
vent the worsening of illness amongst those in the early 
stages  of  full-threshold  psychotic  disorder.55,61,62  SEIs 
also  aim  to  treat  known  risk  factors  of  violence,  in-
cluding  substance  misuse,1,10,17,25  positive  symptoms  (eg, 
delusions, hallucinations)14,17 and longer duration of un-
treated psychosis (DUP),1,7 which may subsequently lead 
to  lower  violence  risk.  However,  this  is  speculative  and 
further  research  is  needed  to  clarify  whether  other  fac-
tors  may  be  influencing  this  trend.  Additionally,  whilst 
the rate of severe violence (2.2%) was higher than those 
reported in previous reviews (0.6%1), this finding should 
be interpreted with caution given the small sample size of 
two studies. One possible explanation for this difference 
is that severe acts of violence may have not been included 
in earlier studies due to the severity of behavior (eg, in-
carcerated for violent crimes).

Second,  the  pooled  proportion  of   violence  was 
highest at first presentation to services (20.8%) and sig-
nificantly lower post-contact with services (13.3%), with 
the risk of  violence perpetration being almost two times 
lower following treatment initiation (ranged between 4 
weeks43 and 10 years14 following entry to services). This 
was consistent with previous reviews, which found sig-
nificant reductions in rates of  violence14 and homicide8 
following  treatment.  In  the  current  review,  treatment 
typically  involved  community-based  specialized  early 

765

S. Youn et al

intervention  programs,39,50  hospital  admissions,14,43,63 
and other unspecialized treatments in the broader com-
munity.32 Further, given the rate of  violence was highest 
at first presentation to services, our findings suggest that 
this period is associated with increased vulnerability for 
violence.  It  was  not  possible  to  identify  the  exact  time 
point at which the risk of  violence was highest, as most 
studies did not specify the time range at which violence 
was  assessed  at  first  presentation  (eg,  within  the  first 
week of  presentation). While our findings are consistent 
with  most  previous  reviews,  one  earlier  study  found 
that  rates  of   serious  aggression  (ie,  violence)  was  not 
significantly  different  pre-  and  post-contact  with  serv-
ices.17 It is possible that differences in the defined time 
periods (ie, pre- and post-contact) may have contributed 
to this discrepancy. It is also likely that other treatment 
related  factors  such  as  involuntary  treatment1,64  and 
non-adherence  to  psychological  and  pharmacological 
treatment,2,65,66  as  well  as  clinical  presentations  such  as 
comorbid  substance  use1,12,32,67,68  and  longer  DUP,7,36 
may  have  contributed  to  the  non-significant  reduction 
in rates post treatment initiation.

Third,  consistent  with  previous  reports,2,3  we  found 
notable inconsistencies in the definition, measurement, 
and  classification  of   violence.  Our  results  showed  that 
across  studies  violence  has  been  defined  according 
to  varying  sources  (eg,  existing  reviews,  dictionaries, 
standardized assessment tools), whilst some studies ap-
peared  to  have  defined  violence  arbitrarily  or  failed  to 
provide  any  definition.  Violence  has  also  been  meas-
ured  differently  across  studies  (eg,  patient  interview, 
self-reports,  police  records),  and  classified  inconsist-
ently  based  on  severity  and  timing  of   violence.  Most 
studies  used  a  combination  of   methods,  which  has 
been  previously  recommended,2  as  single  measures 
are  likely  to  cause  selective  and  partial  reporting  of 
violence.  Overall,  the  discrepancies  in  the  definition, 
measurement and classification of  violence make it dif-
ficult  to  compare  rates  across  studies,2  and  are  likely 
to  contribute  to  the  very  high  between-study  hetero-
geneity  that  was  observed  in  the  current  study.  Other 
methodological  factors  such  as  differences  in  study 
design  (eg,  inpatient  versus  community  samples)  may 
also  contribute  to  the  disparity  in  results.3  This  could 
be  associated  with  variations  in  the  threshold  for  in-
clusion/exclusion  of   participants  (eg,  only  including 
those  with  specific  diagnoses  of   mental  illness),  fur-
ther  contributing  to  the  between-study  heterogeneity. 
Moving  forward,  this  field  would  benefit  from  using 
consistent  methods  to  examine  violence,  as  rates  can 
vary depending on the measurement tool used. For in-
stance, it has been reported that the use of  structured, 
standardized  assessment  tools  (eg,  MOAS,  PPHS)  has 
led  to  increased  reporting  of   aggression  and  violence 
compared  to  unstructured  assessments  (35%  vs  26%), 
whilst  the  use  of   self-reports  has  led  to  the  reporting 

766

of   higher  rates  of   violence  (34%)  compared  to  case 
notes (31%) or criminal records (27%).17

Clinical Implications

The  findings  of  this  study  suggest  that  the  overall  rate 
of violence appears to have declined in the last 20 years; 
however,  it  is  important  to  consider  potential  factors 
that may be contributing to this decline, such as changes 
in  how  violence  has  been  defined  and  measured  over 
time.  Furthermore,  findings  show  that  rates  of  violence 
amongst FEP populations are higher at first presentation 
to services until people are effectively treated.

The prevalence of any violence was higher at first pres-
entation to services (20.8%), indicating that more timely 
intervention  is  needed  prior  to  this  period,  particularly 
during the DUP stage or the ultra-high risk (UHR) stage, 
which  is  considered  the  putatively  prodromal  stage  of 
psychosis.69  This  will  be  important  for  preventing  poor 
clinical and functional outcomes, including future acts of 
violence.1 Previous incarceration, including those related 
to violent behavior, can lead to treatment delay of up to 
2 years,11,12 more severe positive symptoms (eg, delusions, 
hallucinations),  poorer  premorbid  adjustment,  and  dis-
ruptions in the continuity of care and maintenance of ex-
isting  social  support  networks.12,70  One  way  to  enhance 
prevention  is  to  address  the  barriers  to  early  treatment, 
including the poor integration of mental health services 
and the criminal justice system. Families of people with 
psychosis often make several attempts to access services 
before  finally  receiving  treatment,71,72  and  many  people 
rely on the criminal justice system as a provider of mental 
health  services  or  the  “last  resort”  (State  of  Victoria, 
2021). By the time they access treatment, particularly if 
DUP is significantly lengthened, the risk of committing 
violence is likely to be higher,1,7,73 and opportunities to in-
tervene early and prevent violence may be missed. It may 
also be important to involve other services such as police 
and drug and alcohol services, since previous offending39 
and substance use1,10,17,25 are associated with a greater risk 
of violence perpetration.

Although our findings showed a significant reduction 
in violence following treatment initiation, the prevalence 
remained high. One possible explanation is that existing 
interventions may not be suitable or effective in reducing 
violence in non-offender populations with psychotic dis-
orders.71,74,75 Although interventions such as cognitive be-
havioral  therapy  (CBT)  appear  to  be  effective  amongst 
offender  populations,  its  effectiveness  and  appropriate-
ness  for  clinical  populations  are  unclear,  as  most  inter-
ventions targeting violence and aggression are developed 
from  offender  populations.74  Whilst  this  highlights  the 
need for interventions that specifically target risk for vi-

violence, rather than only reporting the overall rate of 
any  violence.  This  can  provide  richer  data  about  the 
type  of   violent  behavior  committed  by  people  with 
FEP.

Limitations and Future Directions

The  current  review  has  a  few  limitations.  First,  we  did 
not  examine  predictors  of  violence  as  this  was  beyond 
the  scope  of  the  review.  Second,  we  adopted  a  stricter 
approach to inclusion, particularly around FEP groups, 
which may have led to the exclusion of potentially rele-
vant  studies  and  thus,  limit  the  generalizability  of  find-
ings. Studies were excluded if they did not specify what 
diagnostic  method  was  used  to  define  FEP  or  early 
psychosis,  or  if  well-validated  tools  were  not  used  (eg, 
DSM, ICD). This was to ensure that studies were of high 
quality, and that diagnoses were made using standardized 
tools, particularly given diagnoses can be difficult to es-
tablish during early stages of illness. Third, we included 
studies  even  if  they  claimed  to  assess  violence  or  used 
measures of aggression (eg, MOAS), but did not specify 
whether  they  included  physical  violence  towards  people 
only. Consequently, there is potential for the inclusion of 
irrelevant outcomes, such as rates of verbal aggression, or 
violence towards objects. However, the exclusion of these 
studies would have led to a significant reduction in sample 
size and the loss of important data related to violence to-
wards others. Fourth, we did not conduct thorough ana-
lyses of heterogeneity, as this was outside the scope of the 
review.  However,  differences  in  methodological  factors 
such  as  the  definition,  measurement  and  classification 
of  violence,  timing  of  violence,  and  sample  character-
istics  (eg,  inpatient  versus  community  outpatient  versus 
SEI  services)  are  likely  to  contribute  to  the  high  heter-
ogeneity.  Future  studies  may  consider  using  subgroup 
analyses based on study design to investigate reasons for 
the high between-study heterogeneity. However, this may 
be  challenging  due  to  the  limited  information  around 
study  methodology.  Fifth,  due  to  selecting  articles  that 
were  only  written  in  English,  there  is  potential  for  lan-
guage and publication bias, and the inability to examine 
cross-cultural differences in rates of violence. The exclu-
sion of gray literature may also contribute to publication 
bias.

Although we used existing definitions from previous 
reviews1  to  allow  for  comparability,  there  was  notable 
heterogeneity in the definition, measurement, and clas-
sification  of   violence  across  studies.  Future  studies 
are  encouraged  to  use  a  combination  of   various  data 
sources  (eg,  patient  interviews,  medical  records,  offi-
cial police data, self-reports), standardized assessment 
tools  (eg,  MOAS,  PPHS),  and  existing  definitions  of 
violence, in a standardized way. A universally accepted 
data collection protocol may be helpful for addressing 
these  inconsistencies.  It  is  also  recommended  that 
studies  report  specific  rates  for  different  severities  of 

Conclusion

Overall,  the  rate  of  violence  during  FEP  appears  to  be 
lower in more recent years compared to those reported in 
previous reviews, although further research is needed to 
identify potential factors that may be contributing to this 
trend. Treatment appears to be effective for reducing vi-
olence however, rates remain high following service con-
tact.  Consequently,  more  targeted,  early  and  accessible 
treatment is needed to prevent violence, and other nega-
tive outcomes such as longer DUP and worsening of clin-
ical symptoms. A greater integration of mental health and 
criminal justice services could allow for the early identifi-
cation of and better access to treatment in those at risk of 
perpetuating violence. Specialized and holistic interven-
tions  are  also  needed  for  clinical  FEP  populations  with 
a history of violence to prevent future offending. Future 
studies are encouraged to use standardized measures to 
ensure consistent measurement of violence.
