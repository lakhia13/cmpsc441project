1. Introduction 

Human well-being is an important goal in both policy contexts and in health care, while also predicting various 
health-related outcomes. However, the proliferation of conceptions of well-being has become a major obstacle 
for the progress of a comparable and cumulative science of well-being, leading to a need to reach consensus on 
the key dimensions and indicators to be measured as part of human well-being. While attempts at consensus have 
been made, we see that the currently suggested dimensions need to be complemented by the inclusion of in-
dicators for basic psychological needs, as need satisfaction is a crucial dimension of human wellness, flourishing, 
and  more  eudaimonic  conceptions  of  well-being.  In  particular,  we  argue  that  the  inclusion  of  the  three  psy-
chological needs as proposed by Self-Determination Theory – autonomy, competence, and relatedness – would 
provide  a  parsimonious  set  of  indicators  of  key  elements  of  experienced  well-being  deeply  rooted  in  human 
nature,  and  thus  measuring  them  alongside  other  dimensions  would  offer  a  broader  view  of  psychological 
wellness in policy and health care contexts.   

Human  well-being  –  understood  broadly  as  feeling,  doing,  and 
functioning well in life – has been increasingly recognized as a key target 
in both politics and policy contexts as well as in health care and pro-
motion of mental health (Keyes, 2007; OECD, 2013; Prilleltensky, 2005; 
Ryff  et  al.,  2004).  Research  has  also  demonstrated  how  human  well- 
being is a key predictor of various health-related outcomes, including 
longevity (Cohen et al., 2016; Howell et al., 2007; Lyubomirsky et al., 
2005;  Martín-María  et  al.,  2017).  The  recognition  of  well-being  as 
important both as an outcome and as a predictor of other health-related 
factors has made the accurate measurement of well-being a crucial issue 
in health care (VanderWeele et al. 2020). 

However, the expanding number of conceptions of well-being that 
measure an increasingly wide array of disparate components is a major 
obstacle  for  the  progress  of  a  comparable  and  cumulative  science  of 
well-being (Lindert et al., 2015; Linton et al., 2016; Martela and Shel-
don, 2019). Tens of different conceptualizations of well-being exist, with 
the  associated  measures  sometimes  having  almost  no  overlap  at  all 
(Cooke  et  al.,  2016;  Martela  and  Sheldon,  2019).  In  an  attempt  to 
transcend this untenable situation, VanderWeele et al. (2020) recently 

synthesized the field to provide recommendations on what constructs of 
well-being  should  be  measured,  and  how  to  measure  them.  The  key 
constructs  they  recommend  to  be  measured  include  evaluative  well- 
being  (life  satisfaction)  and  emotional  well-being  (positive  and  nega-
tive affect) as well as broader constructs such as eudaimonic well-being 
and human flourishing. Finding such synthesis is crucially important to 
ensure that measures of well-being in various context are comparable 
and contribute to an accumulating body of knowledge about the ante-
cedents and outcomes of human well-being. 

In this spirit, we want to complement the set of recommendations by 
VanderWeele  et  al.  (2020)  by  arguing  that  there  is  a  crucial  aspect 
missing  from  the  dimensions  of  well-being  that  they  recommend  to 
measure:  Human  psychological  needs.  Humans  are  biologically  and 
psychologically constructed such that there are specifiable experiences 
that  all  people  require  in  order  to  survive,  thrive,  and  function  well 
(Doyal  and  Gough,  1991;  Pittman  and  Zeigler,  2007;  Ryan  and  Deci, 
2017). While all organisms have certain physiological needs such as the 
need for water and hydration, the complex cognitive capacity of humans 
means  that  they  also  have  certain  psychological  needs  required  for 
healthy psychological development, growth, integrity, and well-being. 
Accordingly,  a  long  line  of  research  within  psychology  has  aimed  to

identify  those universal  psychological needs  that are  essential  for the 
psychological  health  and  well-being  of  the  person  (Alderfer,  1972; 
Baumeister  and  Leary,  1995;  Deci  and  Ryan,  2000;  Maslow,  1954; 
McClelland, 1985;  Murray, 1938). This  has  led to a  broad  agreement 
around certain needs, especially for the psychological need for related-
ness or belonging (Alderfer, 1972; Baumeister and Leary, 1995; Maslow, 
1954;  McClelland,  1985;  Ryan,  1995),  for  competence  or  efficacy 
(Bandura, 1977; Ryan and Moller, 2017; White, 1959), and, at least in 
some  perspectives,  for  autonomy  (Doyal  and  Gough,  1991;  Ryan  and 
Deci, 2017; Yu et al., 2018). 

These needs have been especially researched within Self-Determina-
tion Theory (SDT; Ryan and Deci, 2017; Deci and Ryan, 2000), where 
their  importance  for  well-being  has  been  demonstrated  in  literally 
hundreds of empirical studies conducted by many independent research 
groups  around  the  world  (reviewed  in  Ryan  and  Deci,  2017;  Van-
steenkiste  et  al.,  2020)  and  in  contexts  ranging  from  education  (e.g., 
Jang et al., 2016) and sports coaching (e.g., Curran et al., 2016) to work 
(Van den Broeck et al., 2016). A meta-analysis in the health care and 
health promotion context alone identified 184 studies examining SDT 
and basic psychological needs (Ng et al., 2012). According to SDT, au-
tonomy is about a sense of volition and an internal locus of causality, 
competence  is  about  a  sense  of  mastery,  effectance  and  efficacy,  and 
relatedness is about a sense of having caring relationships in one’s life. 
VanderWeele  et  al.  (2020,  p.  3)  emphasize  that  a  comprehensive 
understanding of well-being requires the “assessment of multiple aspects 
of  psychological  well-being.”  We  agree,  and  see  that  it  is  crucially 
important to measure psychological needs, for a more complete under-
standing  of  the  person’s  psychological  situation  and  well-being. 
Although positive and negative affect and general life evaluations can 
serve  as  prime  indicators  of  whether  a  person  is  feeling  well,  the 
assessment of psychological needs gives us knowledge on why the person 
is feeling well (Martela and Sheldon, 2019; Ryan, Huta and Deci, 2008). 
The psychological needs function as essential “nutrients” humans need 
from the environment to experience well-being, thus typically mediating 
the influence of various behavioral strategies and environmental factors 
on subjective well-being (Deci and Ryan, 2000; Martela and Sheldon, 
2019). Measuring psychological needs thus gives a richer view of the 
person’s psychological functioning and what makes them feel well. 

The inclusion of psychological needs is especially important when 
the aim is to measure human flourishing, defined as complete human 
well-being where “all aspects of a person’s life are good” (VanderWeele, 
2017, p. 8149). It is hard to see how a person could be flourishing if 
one’s basic psychological needs are thwarted. A complete state of psy-
chological well-being seems impossible without the satisfaction of one’s 
psychological  needs.  Indeed,  perspectives  on  flourishing  have  often 
explicitly  drawn  from  theories  of  psychological  needs  when  choosing 
what  dimensions  to  include  in  their  assessments  of  flourishing  (e.g., 
Diener  et  al.,  2010).  Further,  given  that  any  element  of  flourishing 
should  be  viewed  as  an  end  in  itself  and  nearly  universally  desired 
(VanderWeele,  2017),  it  is  worth  noting  that  “values  associated  with 
autonomy,  relatedness,  and  competence  show  a  universal  pattern  of 
high importance and high consensus” according to a cross-cultural study 
of values including 60 different countries (Fischer and Schwartz, 2011, 
p. 1127), demonstrating that these three basic psychological needs are 
something people across cultures value. 

The  psychological  needs  are  also  central,  when  an  often  recom-
mended  distinction  is  made  between  hedonic,  evaluative,  and  eudai-
monic  conceptions  of  well-being  (Graham  et  al.,  2018;  National 
Research Council, 2013; OECD, 2013; Steptoe et al., 2015; VanderWeele 
et al., 2020). While hedonic and evaluative conceptions are relatively 
well understood, eudaimonia is still “less well fleshed out” (OECD, 2013, 
p. 32) and vague, lacking required unification (Heintzelman, 2018; Huta 
and  Waterman,  2014).  Accordingly,  it  has  been  argued  that  psycho-
logical needs could provide the “common core” for the eudaimonic in-
dicators of well-being (Martela and Sheldon, 2019, p. 459), providing a 
parsimonious set of indicators about key aspects of eudaimonia. Here 

eudaimonia is understood as being fundamentally about functioning well 
rather than just feeling well (Huta and Ryan, 2010; Ryan and Martela, 
2016). Instead of seeing hedonia and eudaimonia as two different types 
of feelings, this stream of research sees eudaimonia as being about the 
key  motives,  activities,  and  functioning  that  lead  to  subjective  well- 
being. In other words, eudaimonic activities and functioning should be 
seen  as  key  antecedents  of  indicators  of  feeling  well.  And  as  regards 
psychological  functioning,  psychological  need  satisfaction  should  be 
seen as the core of such functioning (Martela and Sheldon, 2019). Thus, 
we see that indicators of eudaimonia that tend to focus on meaning and 
purpose  (which  are  outcomes  of  need  satisfaction,  see  Martela  et  al., 
2018), should be complemented with ways to assess psychological need 
satisfaction. 

There are several theories of psychological needs, as noted, but the 
theory that has been subject to most comprehensive empirical research 
program  is  Self-Determination  Theory  (Ryan  and  Deci,  2017),  which 
recognizes three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and 
relatedness. Given that there are well-validated scales to measure these 
three  needs  translated  to  many  languages  (Chen  et  al.,  2015)  and 
included  in  international  surveys  (e.g.,  ESS,  round  6;  Huppert  et  al., 
2013), measurement of autonomy, competence, and relatednesss would 
provide a concise way to assess the psychological need satisfaction of an 
individual, and through that receive key information about the person’s 
psychological functioning and flourishing. The Basic Psychological Need 
Satisfaction  and  Frustration  Scale  (BPNSFP;  Chen  et  al.,  2015)  is 
currently the most validated and utilized scale for need satisfaction. It 
measures the three needs with four items each, but if there is room for 
only 1 item per need, we recommend using the following items from the 
BPNSFP:  

1.  I feel that my decisions reflect what I really want. (Autonomy)  
2.  I feel confident that I can do things well. (Competence)  
3.  I feel close and connected with other people who are important to 

me. (Relatedness) 

Accordingly,  we  argue  that  “the  needs  category  provides  a  parsi-
monious set of elements at the core of the well-being construct” (Martela 
and Sheldon, 2019, p. 458) and thus should be included in various at-
tempts to measure human well-being more comprehensively. Indicators 
of psychological need satisfaction focus on key elements of experienced 
well-being  deeply  rooted  in  human  nature.  Measuring  autonomy, 
competence, and relatedness along with SWB in future studies of well- 
being would thus offer a broader view of the well-being of an individ-
ual, and help identify key ways to improve well-being in both policy and 
health care contexts.
