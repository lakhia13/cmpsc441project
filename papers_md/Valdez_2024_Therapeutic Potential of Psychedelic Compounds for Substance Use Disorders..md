Abstract: Psychedelics have recently (re)emerged as therapeutics of high potential for multiple
mental health conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite early mid-20th century
anecdotal reports and pilot studies demonstrating the possibility of these substances in efficaciously
treating conditions such as alcohol and opioid use disorders, legal restrictions and social stigma have
historically hindered further research into this area. Nevertheless, concurrent with the rise in SUDs
and other mental health conditions, researchers have again turned their attention to these compounds,
searching for differing pharmacological targets as well as more holistic treatments that might increase
patient adherence and efficacy. The aim of this review is to examine the emerging evidence-based
data with regards to the therapeutic treatment of SUDs with the psychedelic compounds psilocy-
bin, ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA),
ayahuasca, ibogaine and peyote.

1. Introduction

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex physiological and psychological mental
health condition that involves the usage of alcohol, cannabis, opiates, stimulants and
other substances in uncontrolled amounts despite the consequences [1]. According to the
2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) conducted by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Association (SAMHSA), 48.5 million individuals (~17% of the
population) in the United States over the age of 12 were afflicted with an SUD over the
previous 12 months [2]. Included within that population, 28.9 million had an alcohol use
disorder (AUD), 5.7 million had an opioid use disorder (OUD), and 1.3 million had a
cocaine use disorder (CUD). Additionally, 49.9 million individuals reported using nicotine
products (cigarettes, cigars, vapes, etc.) within the last month (Table 1). The impact of
these SUDs on the population as a whole spreads far beyond the physiological harm of the
addicted individuals.

In recognizing SUDs as a public health concern, one must identify and acknowledge
the risk factors and how those factors have been influenced by social, legal and govern-
mental policies over the past 75 years. As can be seen in Table 2, individuals of lower
socioeconomic status are more likely to use and/or misuse nicotine, opioids and cocaine.
The only substance included which does not follow this pattern is alcohol, with the use
of it increasing concurrent with total family income. In looking at AUD in particular, the
highest earners still demonstrate the highest incidence, with the lowest earners next and
middle-income having the lowest incidence of AUD [2]. Low socioeconomic status is
associated with increased stress along with decreased access to health care, leading many to
self-medicate. Hand-in-hand with the socioeconomic determinants are the data regarding
racial or ethnic minorities. In nearly all cases, non-Hispanic American Indians or Alaskan
Natives have the highest incidence of substance use, followed by those of two or more
races (Table 2). Again, the exception to this is alcohol, in which case the non-Hispanic
White population partakes at the highest percentage. The combination of low socioeco-
nomic status with minority racial expression often fosters an environment of exposure
to substances at a young age through family or peers, which in turn increases the risk of
developing an SUD [3]. Additionally, having a family history of addiction can increase the
risk of an individual developing an SUD by 40–60% [4]. Much of this disparity can be seen
as a self-perpetuating societal issue stemming from the US War on Drugs campaign. In the
1970s, there was an increase in federal funding for drug control and treatment in part due to
then-President Nixon’s claim that drug abuse was “public enemy number one” followed up
in the 1980s by Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign [5]. While these efforts to regulate
drug control led to the establishment of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and allowed
Congress to enact several laws like the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the societal impact
this had on the country was detrimental. Rather than bringing awareness to the issue
at hand, this period in time gave leverage to those in power to label, target, criminalize
and incarcerate individuals based on racial and substance abuse stereotypes [3,5]. The
criminalization and incarceration associated with the War on Drugs has disproportionately
impacted those of low socioeconomic status as well as Black and Indigenous People of
Color (BIPOC), with the overall result being that these groups are more exposed to and
subsequently likely to develop SUDs while simultaneously having less access to prevention
and treatment options.

Ironically, recent advancements in the research surrounding mechanisms and potential
treatments for SUDs have identified and demonstrated that one of the other targets of the
War on Drugs, namely psychedelics, may be the key to a holistic therapeutic option. Whilst
early experimentation in the 1950s–1960s hinted at the therapeutic potential of psychedelics
such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin (the main psychoactive com-
ponent of ‘magic mushrooms’) for the treatment of SUDs, this research was practically
halted when these compounds were made Schedule I substances by the 1970 Controlled

Substances Act [6–10]. Concurrent with the rise in SUDs, particularly with the opioid epi-
demic and the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, renewed interest has been shown
in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for the treatment of various mental health
disorders [6,9,11–16]. While considering potential accessibility for marginalized popula-
tions, this review seeks to examine the emerging evidence that psychedelics may represent
novel, efficacious and holistic treatment options for SUDs. In particular, we will evaluate
the data surrounding psilocybin, ketamine, LSD, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA), ayahuasca, ibogaine and peyote, focusing specifically on nicotine, alcohol, opioid
and cocaine use disorders.

2. SUD Pathophysiology

A variety of substances may lead to addiction, from alcohol to opiates to stimulants.
As measured by the 2023 NSDUH and defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, an individual may be diagnosed with an SUD based on
the following criteria: the substance is recurrently taken, often in larger amounts than
intended, despite its use resulting in professional, social or interpersonal problems; efforts
to decrease or quit using the substance are unsuccessful, and/or more of the substance
is required to achieve the desired effect; and physical and/or psychological withdrawal
symptoms occur when use is stopped for a period of time [2,17]. While the specific
mechanisms of action by which a substance lends itself to abuse are slightly variable,
the overarching mechanism is that the substance interacts with the reward circuit, stress
circuit, and/or decision-making circuits within the brain [18]. Use of a substance can
stimulate the dopaminergic reward system, specifically leading to the transcription and
accumulation of Delta-FosB within the neurons of the nucleus accumbens (nAC) and dorsal
striatum [19–21]. In addition to the direct positive reinforcement from the reward circuit,
the ways in which an individual responds to stress can increase the potential for drug-
seeking behavior via the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Although stress can
create positive feelings of accomplishment or adaptability in the short term, chronic stress
can lead to sustained activation of the HPA which indirectly increases dopamine release
and the accumulation of Delta-FosB [22]. The inflammation caused by physiological and
psychological stress is known to switch the breakdown of tryptophan off of production of
serotonin and towards kynurenine [23]. Kynurenine is then metabolized to the N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist quinolinic acid, which leads to neurotoxicity, enhanced
HPA dysregulation and glutamate excitotoxicty [24]. Indeed, glutamate imbalance has
been implicated in the development of SUDs, with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2
(mGlu2) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nAC and mesocorticolimbic systems exhibiting
decreased function with chronic drug exposure [25]. This glutaminergic dysfunction has
been shown to alter the reward pathways and increase addictive behaviors. Overall,
activation of these systems can create cravings for the initiating substance, and the absence
of that substance can lead to symptoms of withdrawal (Figure 1).

In reviewing individual substances, nicotine and alcohol are the most abused, likely
due to their legal status when compared with opioids and cocaine. Although the above
listed mechanisms underscore dependency to each of these substances, individually they
do have other receptors and pathways that may be targeted when looking for therapeutics
to mitigate their abuse. Nicotine, typically self-administered in the form of tobacco or vape
products, stimulates the release of dopamine via its interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors [26]. Alcohol use leads to a rapid increase in the release of the neurotransmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which, particularly with chronic use, causes downreg-
ulation of GABA type A receptors, inhibition of NMDA postsynaptic glutamate receptor
activity and consequential upregulation of NMDA receptors [27]. Opioids, whether in the
form of pain-relieving prescription medication or illegal heroin or synthetics, act primarily
via the mu opioid receptor, with upregulation of NMDA receptors and an increase in
cAMP/PKA signaling [28]. Cocaine increases dopamine in the synaptic cleft by blocking
dopamine transporters, leading to increased alertness and feelings of euphoria [29]. It also

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake resulting in sympathomimetic symptoms
and occasionally promoting aggressive tendencies. Withdrawal from any of these sub-
stances can cause a multitude of physical and psychological symptoms including, but not
limited to, headaches, seizures, gastrointestinal distress, depression and anxiety.

3. Current SUD Treatments

Although there are a number of current treatments for SUDs, typically involving a
combination of medication and therapy, they all generally suffer from issues with low
efficacy and/or low adherence. For nicotine, those who are trying to quit can try a variety
of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies (patches, gums, lozenges) as well as
some physician-prescribed medications (e.g., bupropion and varenicline). Nevertheless,
of the nearly 15 mil Americans who attempted to quit smoking in 2022, only 8.8% were
successful [30]. For AUD, current treatments for acute withdrawal include benzodiazepines,
gabapentin and alpha 2 agonists, with naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram for main-
tenance. As with nicotine cessation, however, 60–70% of those with AUD who attempt
to quit relapse within the first 6 months to 1 year [31]. OUD is generally treated with mu
opioid receptor agonists and has relapse rates ranging from 10–50% [32]. Cocaine has no
specific FDA-approved medication for withdrawal or cessation although clonidine and
antiemetics may be utilized during the acute phase [33]. Again, maintenance of abstinence
is reportedly low, at around 25% one year post-cessation. Aside from medication, various
forms of psychotherapy including cognitive behavioral therapy, individual counseling and
group therapy are often recommended but do not appear to significantly increase the rates
of abstinence.

4. Psychedelic Compounds for SUDs

A new approach is therefore needed—one which ideally encompasses a holistic ap-
proach to ensure not only mitigation of withdrawal but also the foundation and support
for long-term adherence and abstinence. Building upon early, pre-scheduling research
conducted on psychedelic compounds, a number of preclinical and clinical studies have
again focused on the potential of these drugs to treat SUDs. Below, we highlight the emerg-
ing clinical data surrounding the use of psilocybin, ketamine, LSD, MDMA, ayahuasca,
ibogaine and peyote for the treatment of nicotine, alcohol, opioid and cocaine use disorders
(Table 3).

Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a 5HT2A receptor agonist, is
the main psychoactive component of so-called ‘magic mushrooms’. Despite the religious
and health-related utilization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms by various indigenous
cultures for several millennia, it was not until 1958 that Albert Hofmann isolated and deter-
mined the two main psychoactive agents—psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin [44].
Although produced by Sandoz Pharmaceutical in 1960 under the name Indocybin and
utilized in a variety of psychotolytic and psychedelic treatment models, most of the formal
studies during this time focused on LSD or a combination of LSD and psilocybin or other
classic psychedelics [45,46]. With the recent resurgence of interest in these compounds,
however, several new studies into the potential for psilocybin to treat SUDs have been
completed and more are undergoing clinical Phase I and II trials.

At present, there are thirteen active and/or currently recruiting clinical studies in-
volving psilocybin as a treatment intervention for SUDs—nine for AUD, two for OUD and
one for tobacco use disorder (TUD), with an additional six studies not yet at the recruit-
ment phase [47]. In 2014, researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
published a pilot study of psilocybin in the treatment of tobacco addiction. Of the 15 partici-

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

pants, who had previously attempted to quit smoking on average six times prior, 80% were
nicotine-free at the 6-month follow-up [34]. The structure of treatment involved weekly
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions with a psychologist and three spaced-out doses
of 20 mg/70 kg or 30 mg/70 kg of psilocybin over a 15-week period. In a 12-month and
16+-month follow-up of the study participants, it was found that 67% and 60%, respectively,
remained smoking abstinent. Interestingly, 86.7% of the participants rated the experience as
one of the most personally meaningful of their lives, with 60% meeting the criteria for going
through a ‘complete mystical experience’ [48,49]. Outside of the pilot study, recent surveys
have indicated that those who use or have used psilocybin are at reduced odds of current
nicotine dependence, and one online survey reported 38% total cessation, 28% reduced
use and 34% temporary relapses to smoking following ingestion of psilocybin or another
classic psychedelic [50,51]. Finally, recently posted results of the Phase II clinical study
into psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation (NCT011943994) show that, 6 months after
a single dose of 30 mg/kg psilocybin combined with 13 weeks of cognitive behavioral
intervention, 40.5% of those in the psilocybin group remained abstinent versus 10.0% of
the group receiving CBT + standard Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT; transdermal
nicotine patches) [47].

Comparatively, studies of psilocybin for the treatment of AUD, OUD and CUD are not
as far along in the clinical pipeline, with only a few published results but significant research
interest. In an early study, 31 patients with AUD were treated with alternating psilocybin
and LSD sessions along with undefined psychotherapy and subsequently followed for a
mean of 6 years [46]. Overall, 32% of patients remained abstinent from alcohol, while 58%
had what the authors termed ‘satisfactory therapeutic effect’ (undefined). Interestingly, the
LSD in this study was eventually ceased and only psilocybin sessions were used after it
was determined that psilocybin had a greater effect and fewer adverse reactions. Further
research into this area was halted following the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970
until the past decade, when Bogenschutz et. al. revived the inquiry. The initial pilot
study composed of 10 patients with AUD involved two psilocybin sessions (21 mg/kg and
28 mg/kg) spaced 4 weeks apart along with twelve sessions of psychotherapy (prepara-
tion, motivational enhancement and debriefing) [52]. Patients only reduced alcohol intake
after the first psilocybin session (week 4), and those who reported an intense trip were
significantly more likely to continue to reduce or even remain abstinent from alcohol in
the subsequent 28 weeks of the study. As a follow-up, the group completed a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 95 AUD patients given either two doses of psilo-
cybin (25 mg/70 kg and 25–40 mg/70 kg) 4 weeks apart or two doses of diphenhydramine
(50 mg and 50–100 mg) along with 12 psychotherapy sessions (motivational enhancement
and CBT). Results demonstrated that those receiving psilocybin had fewer heavy drinking
days (9.7% vs. 23.6%) and a lower mean daily alcohol consumption than those adminis-
tered diphenhydramine. While a number of other studies have called for investigating
the treatment of OUD and CUD with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy [53–56], results of
clinical studies in these two SUDs remain unreported and/or in progress at this time aside
from a single technical report indicating that buprenorphine and psilocybin for OUD was
safely tolerated in two patients [57]. At this time, one Phase II trial on psilocybin-facilitated
treatment for cocaine use has been completed (NCT02037126) and results are awaited
with interest.

4.2. Ketamine

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist derived from phencyclidine (PCP), replaced
PCP as a clinical anesthetic in the 1970’s because, while both compounds have addictive
potential and can cause psychodysleptic effects, these effects were lower in ketamine while
still allowing for the maintenance of hemodynamic stability during anesthesia [58–60]. Due
to these hallucinatory side effects, ketamine has also been used in recreational contexts,
although, unlike the other compounds discussed here, it is available for both clinical use
and research as a Schedule III drug. As such, ketamine has been extensively researched

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

7 of 17

for a variety of mental health conditions, notably depression [61,62]. As an adjunct to
psychotherapy, ketamine has also been examined in a number of SUDs with or without
depression as a co-morbidity. Clinical studies currently underway or recently completed
include three for TUD, seven for AUD, four for OUD and one for CUD [47].

Following promising pre-clinical trials in which ketamine attenuated nicotine self-
administration in rodents, several Phase I/II trials were developed to determine if this
efficacy could be translated to humans with TUD [47,63]. In the only trial to have thus
far released results, 10 individuals with TUD were randomly assigned to receive a single
infusion of either saline or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 20 min (NCT03813121). While safety
seems to have been established in the reporting of one case each of non-serious adverse
events (nausea, emotional distress, motor incoordination) in the week following infusion,
no results with regard to abstinence or reduction in tobacco have yet been reported. The
other TUD trials are in early Phase I, and we await the results with interest [47]. Evidence
for the efficacy and safety of ketamine-assisted therapy in those with AUD, on the other
hand, indicates potential, as reflected in the amount of current clinical trials examining
this intervention (for comprehensive reviews, see [64,65]). For example, in a sample of
211 individuals receiving inpatient care for AUD, those who were administered a single
intra-muscular dose of ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) alongside the standard intensive individual
and group therapy reported 65.8% abstinence at one year compared with 27.0% in the
control group [36]. In a recent outpatient setting, 40 individuals with AUD were treated
with either a single ketamine (0.71 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.025 mg/kg) infusion paired
with five weeks of motivational enhancement therapy. At the 21-day follow-up, 52.9%
in the ketamine group remained abstinent versus 40.9% in the midazolam group [66].
Interestingly, the patients in this study who had a ‘mystical-type’ experience on ketamine
were more likely to reduce their at-risk drinking behaviors [67]. In a recently completed trial
examining the effects of ketamine or placebo with either psychotherapy or simple education
on alcoholic relapse, the ketamine + psychotherapy group had the lowest amount of relapse
(61.9%) while the placebo + education group had the highest (78.3%) (NCT02649231) [47].
Current trials are looking at the comparison of ketamine- versus psilocybin-assisted therapy
for AUD or ketamine-assisted therapy for AUD + depression. Similar to AUD, ketamine
has also shown some promise as a treatment for OUD. In fact, with regards to opioids,
ketamine has the potential to not only be a treatment but also a preventative measure
for OUD. A number of studies have demonstrated the benefit of utilizing low doses of
ketamine as an adjunct to opioids following surgery, allowing physicians to decrease the
necessary dose of opioids and thereby lower the risk of OUD development [68–71]. On the
treatment side, two separate studies conducted by Krupitsky et.al. illustrated the potential
of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy to treat heroin addiction. In the first study, 70 detoxified
patients were divided into a low (0.2 mg/kg) and high (2.0 mg/kg) intramuscular dose
of ketamine alongside psychotherapy. At 24 months post-administration, the high dose
group had significantly increased levels of abstinence [38]. In the second study, single
versus multiple sessions of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for heroin addiction led
to the conclusion that those receiving multiple doses were significantly more likely to
remain abstinent for at least one year [72]. Current clinical trials are investigating the
use of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy in OUD patients in sustained or early remission
as well as those with co-morbid depression. Finally, with one Phase II trial currently
active, ketamine has also been highlighted as a potential treatment for CUD. In a crossover,
double-blind trial eight patients with CUD who were not actively seeking treatment or
abstinence were given infusions of ketamine and lorazepam. One day after the infusions,
both single and subsequent infusions of ketamine were associated with significant increases
in abstinence motivation and decreases in cue-induced cravings [73]. In a subsequent
trial of 20 individuals with CUD, ketamine was found to significantly reduce cocaine
self-administration by 67% compared to the baseline [41]. As with other substances, the
‘mystical-type’ experiences that accompany ketamine infusion appear to be critical to its
efficacy [74].

4.3. LSD

LSD, arguably the most iconic psychedelic, was one of the first to introduce the concept
of using this class of drugs as potential treatments for SUDs. Similar to psilocybin, it is a
5HT2A receptor agonist. Synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1938 and then subsequently
forgotten about until his accidental and then iconic intentional ingestion in 1943, LSD
was widely distributed to researchers and psychiatrists by Sandoz Ltd. under the name
Delysid from the late 1940s–1960s. Then, as with the other classic psychedelics that had
moved into the recreational sphere, it was classified as Schedule I in 1970, bringing that
early research to a halt. Nevertheless, once interest began to be renewed in psychedelics
as potential therapeutic agents, researchers were able to look back on those thousands of
papers and anecdotes from that time period and recreate and build upon our knowledge of
these compounds.

Much of the early research into LSD focused on its apparent ability to treat alco-
holism anecdotally and in uncontrolled trials. The few trials that utilized control groups
were inconclusive, suffering from poor design, inadequate sample sizes and questionable
statistics [6,9]. A modern-day meta-analysis of these early studies, however, did find
that the results were significant and consistent across seven impactful trials, with 59%
of those treated with LSD demonstrating significant improvement as compared to 38%
of the control group [9]. Still, likely due to the intense social stigma surrounding LSD
in particular, there a no recent reports and only one ongoing clinical trial into the use of
LSD for AUD (NCT05474989) [47]. Similarly, there are no direct studies utilizing LSD as
an intervention for TUD, although there are some survey data. Those data, however, are
complicated by self-reporting and the lack of separation between the type of psychedelic
ingested and the resultant effect. While the previously mentioned online survey indicated
that psychedelic use (mostly psilocybin and LSD) reduced cigarette smoking, it is unclear
if one substance had more impact than any other, or indeed if participants were using
more than one substance at a time [50]. Conversely, the survey utilizing data from the
2015–2019 NSDUH reported that the use of LSD was associated with increased odds of
nicotine dependence [51]. With regards to OUD, one study exists from the early era of
research, in which 78 male prisoners up for parole and addicted to heroin were divided
into a group that received 4–6 weeks of residential treatment including one 300–500 mcg
LSD session or to the standard outpatient abstinence program involving drug monitoring
and weekly group therapy [39]. While the variation in therapy makes direct comparison
impossible, the LSD group did report 25% abstinence at one year as compared to 5% in the
standard outpatient group. While there have been calls for more studies, there are currently
no active clinical trials for LSD in TUD, OUD or CUD. Indeed, a population survey using
data from the 2015–2019 NSDUH indicated that LSD use was associated with increased
odds of CUD [56]. Overall, despite serving as the catalyst for research into psychedelics for
the treatment of SUDs, LSD has fallen by the wayside and much more research needs to be
conducted to determine whether it could potentially be of benefit.

4.4. MDMA

MDMA is a somewhat unique poly-pharmacological psychedelic, acting not only as
an agonist at 5HT2A receptors, but also as a serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine
releasing agent (SNDRA) and agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR1).
Despite not featuring in the research of the 1950s–1970s, MDMA has taken center stage
in the recent psychedelic renaissance as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) [15,75,76]. While much of the attention is focused on MDMA-assisted
therapy for PTSD, research into its potential for SUDs continues in the background.

Despite some preliminary pre-clinical data, there is no evidence indicating the useful-
ness of MDMA in TUD. For AUD, however, there are three current clinical trials underway
testing the effects of MDMA, two of which include PTSD as a co-morbidity [47]. Details
of the first open-label safety and tolerability study investigating the potential of MDMA-
assisted therapy in treating those with AUD were published in a case report on the first few

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

9 of 17

patients in 2019, followed by a full report in 2021 [37,77]. Whilst it was only a pilot study
including 14 participants, results were favorable with patients reducing alcohol consump-
tion by 85.7% at 9 months post-treatment and reporting increased psychosocial functioning.
MDMA in this group was well tolerated with only a transient rise in blood pressure, heart
rate and body temperature that returned to baseline after the session [77]. MDMA-assisted
therapy is also currently being studied in a Phase II trial of co-morbid PTSD and OUD after
childbirth (NCT05219175) [47]. While there have been no direct studies on the potential of
MDMA-assisted therapy for CUD, this is one area where it may be contraindicated. Data
from the 2015–2019 NSDUH survey indicated that those individuals who had used MDMA
in their lifetime had significantly greater odds of presenting with past-year CUD (aOR 2.61;
p < 0.001) [56]. This discrepancy could possibly be explained by the fact that both cocaine
and MDMA are stimulants, leading the same population to be attracted to them, although
further research is warranted. From a population perspective, one study has indicated that
while Asian people were the most in favor of medical trials of MDMA-assisted therapy at
86.4%, they were the least willing to try said therapy at 40.9% [78]. Amongst other races,
Hispanic/Latino people indicated the highest willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy
at 68.0%, followed by Black/AA people at 60.1%, White people at 57.5% and AIAN people
at 47.5%. These percentages highlight the openness of all individuals regardless of race or
ethnicity to utilize these drugs should they prove beneficial and become available.

4.5. Ayahuasca

Ayahuasca, an indigenous Amazonian spiritual and healing brew made from the
plants Banisteriopsis capi and Psychoria viridis, is a potent mixture of the psychoactive
molecule N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).
Like psilocybin and LSD, DMT is considered a ‘classic psychedelic’ in that it induces
psychoactive properties via agonism at the 5HT2A receptor [79]. Although somewhat less
popular than mushrooms or acid, ayahuasca has made its way into Western medicine with
individuals taking trips to the Amazon for what has been called ‘ayahuasca tourism’ and
others incorporating it into their religious ceremonies in the U.S. itself.

Used by indigenous populations for hundreds if not thousands of years, ayahuasca
has anecdotally been known to have positive effects in relieving mental health disorders,
including SUDs. Only recently, however, have regulated trials or surveys been conducted
to quantify this potential efficacy. A preliminary observational study conducted among
a First Nations community in Canada combined four days of group counseling with two
ayahuasca ceremonies, assessing psychological and behavioral patterns of SUDs before
and at six months after the treatment [35]. Individuals in the study demonstrated increased
hopefulness, empowerment, mindfulness and quality of life following the ayahuasca
ceremonies. They also self-reported decreases from pre-ceremony in the use of tobacco
(81.8% to 63.6%), alcohol (50% to 20%) and cocaine (60% to 0%), although no decline was
noted in opioid use [35,55]. Regarding long-term ayahuasca use, Barbosa et. al. assessed
the impact of ceremonial ayahuasca use on TUD and AUD on Brazilian members of União
do Vegetal (UDV) by comparing them to a national normative sample [80]. While lifetime
use of alcohol and tobacco were higher proportionally in the UDV group, the incidence of
current TUD and AUD were significantly lower (p < 0.001 for all age ranges). Similarly, in
interviews of 40 crack cocaine users in Brazil, ayahuasca was reported to create a spiritual
experience, increasing their self-esteem and the socio-emotional aspects of their lives while
allowing them to solve their traumas and reduce cocaine use [42]. While more intentional
and regulated research needs to be done, there does appear to be some promise in the
potential of ayahuasca, particularly when used in a religious/spiritual context, to reduce
the severity and/or incidence of SUDs.

4.6. Ibogaine

Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid, isolated from the root of the Tabernanthe iboga plant, that
has been used for centuries by the followers of the Bwiti religion in Central and Western

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

10 of 17

Africa. As an integral part of their religious and initiation ceremonies, the Bwiti have
reported its ability to abrogate thirst, hunger and fatigue as well as to induce a trance-
like healing state [81]. As with LSD and psilocybin, ibogaine was experimented with
throughout the 1960s in the U.S. and European psychedelic scene. It was during one such
case of experimentation that Howard Lotsof, a soon-to-be proponent of iboga therapy,
realized that it had reduced, and in some cases removed, their cravings and withdrawals
from heroin [82]. Unfortunately, mainly due to its hallucinatory properties, it became illegal
in 1967 and was established as a Schedule I drug following the CSA. Still, as with ayahuasca
and the other drugs covered in this review, people have sought out ibogaine regardless of
its legal status in hopes that it might help them with their SUDs.

Ibogaine has mostly been investigated for its potential as a treatment for OUD, and
to a lesser extent CUD. While there are some pre-clinical studies indicating that ibogaine
might be useful in TUD or AUD, these results have not yet been translated into human
trials, although there is one current Phase II clinical trial for AUD (NCT03380728) [47,83–85].
Indeed, the two reports involving ibogaine use for AUD have drastically different results. In
one study, a 31-year-old male with moderate AUD treated with a combination of ibogaine
and 5-MeO-DMT reported that the ibogaine led to resolution of traumas behind his alcohol
use while the 5-MeO-DMT induced a spiritual breakthrough. He remained abstinent from
alcohol for one month [86]. In contrast, there is a second case report of a male AUD patient
who died suddenly within 24 h of ibogaine treatment [87]. Indeed, there have been a small
number of fatalities associated with ibogaine treatment, mostly due to its inhibition of hERG
potassium channels leading to potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias [88]. It is therefore
imperative that these patients be screened and monitored properly before, during and after
ibogaine treatment. Nonetheless, it has been estimated that over 10,000 patients have sought
out and been treated with ibogaine worldwide in the past few decades. The vast majority
of these patients seek treatment for OUD. Based on past and emerging research, it does
appear that ibogaine is an extremely effective OUD treatment for reducing withdrawal and
treating opioid dependence [13,40,89–93]. To highlight one study that followed 30 patients
for 12 months post-treatment, Brown and Alper found a significant improvement in the
patients’ Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) scores and reported abstinence
from opioids at 1 (50%), 3 (33%), 6 (20%), 9 (37%) and 12 (23%) months [13]. Similar
improvements in SOWS and an even higher rate of abstinence was reported in another
study, with 75% of patients maintaining abstinence from opioids 12 months post-ibogaine
therapy [40]. In patients with CUD, the intensity, frequency and duration of cravings
decreased along with an improvement in depressive mood as 91.7% of patients reported
that ibogaine was useful for their drug problems at three days post-treatment [43]. Given
its potential benefits and considering the serious risks, it is critical that ibogaine continue
to be researched and to develop optimal guidelines that govern its use in patients with
an SUD.

4.7. Peyote

The peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii) is a small, endangered cactus native to the southern
portion of North America. It has been used for thousands of years by the indigenous populations
of the area in religious and healing ceremonies, similar to ayahuasca and ibogaine. The main
psychoactive component of the cactus is 3,4,5-trimenthoxyphenethylamine (mescaline), a
phenylethylamine proto-alkaloid with properties similar to LSD and psilocybin in that
it produces its hallucinogenic properties via agonism of the 5HT2A receptor [94]. Due
to its endangered status as well as its current sacramental use, a vast majority of the
studies performed on peyote have been retrospective or survey studies among indigenous
populations. Among AI youth, more individuals reported the use of peyote for spiritual
over recreational reasons, with those using it recreationally more likely to have used
alcohol or cannabis within the previous thirty days [95]. In adults, those who reported use
of mescaline in naturalistic settings also reported subjective improvements in depression,
anxiety, AUD and general drug use disorders, with those having reported a ‘mystical

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

11 of 17

experience’ indicating the greatest rates of improvement [96]. In assessing the data from
the 2015–2019 NSDUH, Jones et. al. found that while peyote use did not alter the chance
of nicotine dependence, it was associated with lower odds of past-year CUD (aOR 0.47;
p < 0.05) [51,56]. As noted, cultural and environmental considerations have limited the
study of peyote for medicinal value; however, there are other cacti that produce mescaline
(e.g., Peruvian torch), and it may be synthesized in the lab. It would be of interest to test
mescaline obtained in these ways for the potential of alleviation of SUDs.

5. Potential Mechanisms of Action for Psychedelics in SUD

Despite the past and emerging evidence of efficacy for the use of psychedelics as
holistic treatments for SUDs, their mechanism of action in addiction is still not well un-
derstood. For the classic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, peyote), the activation
of the 5HT2A receptor is pointed to as the most likely mechanism of altering addictive
behaviors. Indeed, 5HT2A and mGlu2 have been demonstrated as using crosstalk or
heterodimer formation to regulate each other’s signaling pathways, thereby potentially
restoring glutamate transmission within the PFC [25,97]. In restoring the PFC, glutamate
transmission may result in less stress reactivity and more inhibitory control in the amygdala
and dorsal raphe nuclei. This decrease in stress reactivity and subsequent stress-induced
neurodegeneration at the HPA may be at least partially responsible for the reduction in
drug-seeking behaviors. Ibogaine and MDMA also act via the 5HT2A receptors with some
additional activity due to their unique pharmacodynamics. As an SNDRA, MDMA drasti-
cally increases the availability of not only serotonin, but also dopamine and norepinephrine,
creating stimulating effects along with pleasure that, when combined with the neuroplastic
effects of 5HT2A agonism, may add to its efficacy. Ibogaine, while an agonist for the 5HT2A
receptors, is also an NMDA antagonist similar to ketamine. This action at the NMDA
receptors may counteract the increase in the NMDA agonist quinolinic acid, helping to
restore the glutamate imbalance and reset the HPA axis along with potentially leading to
new synaptic formations and subsequent changes in learned behavior [81,98]. Moreover,
ibogaine metabolizes in the body to noribogaine, an active metabolite that exhibits a strong
affinity for mu opioid receptors. This may help to explain the reductions in opioid with-
drawal symptoms and cravings associated with ibogaine treatment for OUD [93]. Beyond
the pharmacologic profiles of these compounds, however, the altered consciousness and
‘mysticality’ of the experience cannot be ignored (Figure 1). In nearly all cases where it
has been recorded, those individuals undergoing psychedelic therapy who have the most
intense spiritual or mystical experiences on the drug are the ones who perceive the most
benefit [48,99,100]. For example, in the psilocybin TUD study, it was noted that patients
report feeling whole again, with the experience being likened to the opposite of an episode
of PTSD [48]. Similarly, ibogaine’s oneirophrenic effects have been reported to significantly
increase the overall empathy of patients along with encouraging them to learn to love
themselves [101]. Ayahuasca, ibogaine and peyote, as sacraments for certain Indigenous
cultures, have long been associated with spiritual enlightenment and growth [96,102,103].
Finally, the significance of the psychotherapy component cannot be ruled out at present.
Although different types and intensities of therapy have been used, it is almost always
a part of the experience. Determining which, indeed if any, psychotherapy is the most
effective alongside psychedelics is an area requiring far more research before any potential
guidelines are put into place.

6. Safety Considerations of Psychedelic Therapy

As these drugs make their way through various clinical trials and back into the
public psyche as a whole, it is imperative that their potential harmful effects also be
elucidated and acknowledged. Although the classic 5HT2A-agonist psychedelics have
generally been considered reasonably non-toxic and non-addictive, there are a number
of transient along with a few potential long-term adverse effects that may make their use
in certain patient populations contraindicated. Specifically, psilocybin, DMT and LSD

Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1484

12 of 17

have all demonstrated a transient increase in blood pressure and heart rate during the
active portion of the experience which may exclude those with certain cardiovascular
diagnoses [99,104–106]. Additionally, these compounds are strongly contraindicated for
individuals with a personal or family history of psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar
disorders as they have the potential to make these conditions manifest or worsen. Current
clinical trials actively exclude such patients. Ketamine, despite its lower scheduling, has
similar adverse effects as classic psychedelics as well as reports of serious gastrointestinal
and urological disorders such as hemorrhagic cystitis [107]. Additionally, while more
research is needed, there is some evidence that ketamine itself can be both psychologically
and physically addictive [108]. MDMA, while sharing the same cardiovascular and mental
health contraindications as classic psychedelics, can induce severe hyperthermia and long-
term changes in liver and brain function [109–111]. Ibogaine’s most dangerous side effect
is the activation of cardiac hERG potassium channels which can lead to QT prolongation
and potentially fatal arrhythmias [88]. In addition to the above, it is likely that other
potentially dangerous adverse effects as well as serious drug–drug interactions may be
noted as research continues on these compounds. It is therefore extremely important that
all effects be recorded and published and that patients be properly screened and evaluated
prior to utilizing any of these drugs.

7. Conclusions

Emerging evidence has indicated the potential efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy
for the treatment of SUDs. With increasing rates of these disorders and the number of
patients who do not or cannot benefit from existing treatments, psychedelics may hold
promise. Indeed, those who have undergone psychedelic-assisted treatment for an SUD,
whether monitored or not, in general report improvements not only in their substance
use but also in their professional and social lives. Nonetheless, far more research needs to
be conducted to verify efficacy and ensure safety in developing guidelines, incorporating
specific evidence-based, repeatable data. Along with this, it is imperative that those
guidelines consider accessibility and equity in treatment for all SUD patients regardless of
location, socioeconomic status or ethnicity.
