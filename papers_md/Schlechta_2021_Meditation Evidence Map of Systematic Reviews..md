Study Basis: This evidence map presents a summary of studies that addressed
the effects of meditation on various clinical and health conditions. Meditation is a
contemplative practice that has been used for the promotion of health, and the treatment
of different conditions.

The study is based on the search of

Method:
four electronic databases for
the period 1994-November 2019 and includes systematic reviews, meta-analyses,
meta-syntheses, and integrative reviews. 3iE evidence gap map was the methodology
of choice, and AMSTAR 2 was used for
the analyses. Tableau was used to
graphically display the conﬁdence level, number of reviews, health outcomes, and
intervention effects.

Results: This map encompasses 191 studies, with Mindfulness being the key word that
retrieved the highest number of results. Several meditation techniques were evaluated in
different contexts, and the conﬁdence levels of 22 studies were high, 84 were moderate,
and 82 were low. Two 2 meta-syntheses and 1 integrative review were also included.
Most of the studies reported positive effects and a beneﬁcial potential of the practice
of meditation. Health outcomes were divided into ﬁve groups out of which mental health
and vitality, and well-being and quality of life stood out with the largest number of studies.

Conclusions: Meditation has been applied in different areas. This Evidence Map
intends to be an easy visual tool to access valuable evidence-based information on this
complementary therapy for patients, health professionals, and managers.

Keywords: meditation, evidence map, systematic review, complementary and alternative medicine, mindfulness

BACKGROUND

The World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged and strengthened the inclusion,
recognition, and use of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPs) in national
health systems at all levels: Primary Care, Specialized Care, and Hospital Care, through the
recommendations of the WHO Strategy on Traditional Medicine 2014–2023 (1).

Since 2018, meditation is one of the 29 practices that have been included in the Brazilian Uniﬁed
Health System (2). Meditation is a contemplative practice, related to the development of human
experiences and widely used in diﬀerent traditions. It originated centuries ago and is currently
studied for its eﬀects on health. Meditation is a generic term that many practices ﬁt into. Therefore,

some authors propose a general deﬁnition of meditation.
Cardoso et al. (3) deﬁne it as: “Meditation is a procedure
which should encompass a speciﬁc technique, clearly deﬁned,
involving muscle relaxation in some point of the process and
“logic relaxation”; it is a self-induced state, using a self-focus
skill (coined “anchor”). Within the various schools of meditation,
Mindfulness has a prominent place due to the considerable
number of works found on this map. Some authors deﬁne
Mindfulness as: “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose,
in the present moment, non-judgmentally” (4) or “mindfulness
meditation involves the self-regulation of attention and involves
adopting a particular orientation toward one’s experiences in
the present moment” (5). Given the considerable number of
meditation schools, we chose to add studies that self-identiﬁed
as meditation.

According to Johnson (7), meditation is a practice that may
have arisen simultaneously with the domestication of ﬁre. The
author explains that the ﬁrst meditative experiences may have
taken place while our ancestors contemplated the ﬁre ﬂames.
In the past, meditation was considered a practice within the
spiritual realm; however, the recent increase in the number of
practitioners may derive from its positive eﬀects on health (8, 9).
The ﬁrst robust evidence in the health ﬁeld can be found in the
late 60’s. In 1970 (10), Wallace used EEG and other physiological
measures to monitor the meditative state. The results of this
study pointed to the surge of theta waves, a frequency decrease,
and an increase in the amplitude of the alpha waves. Thus, the
author characterized meditation as a hypo metabolic state with a
predominant expression of the parasympathetic nervous system
and a reduction of the sympathetic tonus.

Since then, the number and quality of studies on meditation
has increased, becoming an integrative practice that has gained a
growing interest among health professionals.

About 19% of the non-institutionalized adult population in
the USA practices some kind of meditation (11). A higher rate
of adoption has been observed among women, and the more
educated and younger population, and people with chronic
diseases as anxiety, depression, pain, and sleep problems. The
high cost of conventional medical treatment is also one of the
reasons for the adoption of this practice. The most vulnerable
population, with worse health conditions, is less likely to practice
meditation (12).

The interest in Complementary and Alternative Medicine,
classiﬁed by WHO within a broader scope as Traditional,
Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (MTCI), has grown
not only within the general population, but also among health

professionals. In general, about 80% of complementary therapies
have been considered as an option of treatment during the
patient-doctor discussions (13). Despite the moderate level of
knowledge that doctors have about meditation, they ﬁnd it
beneﬁcial and prescribe it as a form of treatment (14). This
acceptance of the meditation practice may derive from the
increasing number of courses on MTCI oﬀered as part of the

were consulted and the search strategy was jointly developed
with BIREME.

To bridge this gap, this study intends to systematize research
results on the prescription and adoption of meditation in a clear
and concise map to boost conﬁdence and inform decisions taken
by health professionals and public administrators.

METHOD

This Evidence Map includes integrative and systematic reviews,
meta-analysis, and meta-synthesis, and summarizes meditation
related health interventions and outcomes. Systematic reviews
were performed to obtain a reliable summary of the best evidence
available in this area. The analysis was carried out following
the PRISMA guidelines (16) and the International Initiative for
Impact Evaluation (3iE) Evidence Gap Map methodology (17).
An advisory panel of librarians, practitioners, policy makers,
content experts, and researchers contributed to the production
of this evidence map.

DATA SOURCES

Papers published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were
selected in searches conducted on PUBMED, BVS, and EMBASE
databases from 1994 to November 2019. Experts on the topic

resolved by discussion (Figure 1). AMSTAR 2 (19) (Figure 2)
was used to analyze the quality and methodological rigor of the
studies included.

Synthesis of the Data
A spreadsheet with various descriptors was developed to
synthesize the ﬁndings. This matrix included: Full text citation;
Interventions; Outcomes group; Outcomes; Eﬀect; Population;
Database ID; Country of
focus; Country of publication;
Year of publication; Type of review; Review design; Study
design; Conﬁdence level. The Evidence Map was organized
considering the outcomes, eﬀects, and conﬁdence level of the
studies included.

RESULTS

Of 407 citations identiﬁed, 191 studies met the inclusion criteria.
A total of 507 diﬀerent outcomes were identiﬁed, with it being
possible to ﬁnd more than one per study, i.e., a single article
may have information related to two outcome groups, several
types of meditation, and diﬀerent populations. One hundred and
ten systematic reviews with meta-analysis, 78 systematic reviews,
two meta-syntheses, and one integrative review were included.
Meditation types based on open state practices accounted for
the highest number of results (390 results), followed by mixture
of techniques (93 results), mantra-focused practices (15 results),
state-focused practices (8 results), and focused mindfulness

practices (1 result). According to AMSTAR2 classiﬁcation, most
studies showed a moderate level of conﬁdence (n = 84 studies),
82 studies had a low conﬁdence level, and 22 studies had a high
conﬁdence level. The two meta-syntheses and the integrative
review could not be evaluated by this tool (19).

Population
Most of the studies found in the search addressed outcomes in the
adult population with some diagnosed conditions, with 114 on
patients with mental disorders, 45 on patients with cancer, and
36 on patients with chronic pain. The search also identiﬁed 36
studies conducted exclusively with children or adolescents, and
35 that only included women.

Countries
The United States was the country of focus where the highest
number of studies were carried out (61 studies), followed by
Canada (30 studies), United Kingdom (28 studies), and Australia
(23 studies). One hundred and twenty one studies did not report
the country of focus.

Outcomes and Effects
It was observed that meditation has been used as an intervention
in diverse health conditions. Within the 191 studies retrieved,
eﬀects were classiﬁed into ﬁve categories of health outcomes
and considered as: negative (no results); positive (246 results);
potentially positive (174 results); inconclusive/mixed (74 results);
and no eﬀect (13 results), reaching a total of 507 diverse eﬀects, as

shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 depicts the results, which are divided
into ﬁve major groups.

Mental Health
The Mental Health category included 270 results involving the
practice of meditation (Figure 5) among which 138 reported
positive eﬀects, 88 reported potentially positive eﬀects, 38
reported inconclusive/mixed eﬀects, and 6 did not describe the
eﬀects. The highest number of results was found in the treatment
of anxiety, depression, and stress, followed by those pointing out
the improvement in levels of mindfulness (Figure 5). Regarding
the population, in 97 results the inclusion criterion was patients
with some diagnosis of mental disorder, 24 results referred
to the eﬀect of meditation practices exclusively in children
and adolescents, and in 20 results the inclusion criterion was
cancer patients. Results whose inclusion criterion was exclusively
women had 18 occurrences. Open State practices were the
most prevalent, represented in the treatment of 34 diﬀerent
categories among which Mindfulness-Based Interventions were
the most common, followed by Mixed Techniques, adopted
in 16 categories, mantra-focused practices, adopted in six
categories and focused attention adopted for the treatment of
four diﬀerent categories.

Physical and Metabolic Effects
The group including Physical and Metabolic outcomes presents
a total of 87 results. The eﬀect of meditation was positive
in 41 results, potentially positive in 29 results, inconclusive
in 15 results, and with no eﬀects in two results. The most

inconclusive and two results with no eﬀects. The most common
outcomes were decreasing stress, higher quality of life and better
worker health with 39, 24, and 4 results, respectively. Most
of the results obtained in this group (62 results) included a
population with some health disorder diagnosed, plus 11 results
were obtained using the criteria of workers.

DISCUSSION

The number of meditation practitioners has grown in recent
years. One of the main reasons is the acknowledgment of the
positive eﬀects that meditation exerts on health in general (8, 9).
However, healthcare courses themselves oﬀer few disciplines
and little scientiﬁc evidence on the MTCI (15, 20), that is why
studies of this nature are necessary, such as systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, and evidence mapping.

A survey carried out by Andrade et al. (21), found out that
∼30% of the population in a large city like São Paulo suﬀer some
sort of mental disorder, the most prevalent being depression and
anxiety. Our survey mostly researched population with some
mental disorder. The high prevalence of psychiatric disorders
around the world is one of the reasons why a large number
of studies on meditation were carried out within the Mental
Health outcome group. Within a US sample, anxiety, stress, and
depression were the health issues most associated with the search
for meditation. Most respondents recognized that meditation
improves mental health (22).

In the map, depression, and anxiety were the disorders
with the highest number of results, with 71 and 67 results,
respectively. On depression, there were 11 reviews with a high
conﬁdence level of which only one eﬀect was inconclusive,
one potential positive and 9 had positive eﬀects related to
meditation. All articles with a high conﬁdence level were
systematic review studies with meta-analysis (23, 24) reporting
positive eﬀects for reducing depressive symptoms in patients with
mental disorders.

Goldberg et al. (24) also conclude that meditation has similar
results to some standard treatments such as psychotherapy.
Another study showed that a meditation program reduced
relapse in patients with depression (25), that is, since recurrent
depression is more diﬃcult to be treated and causes high costs
for society (26, 27), the MBCT program can be considered an
eﬃcient treatment, as observed in NHS experiences in England
(28) and conﬁrmed by several studies present in this map (29–
31).

Mental health costs in China increased more than 3-fold from
2005 to 2013 and could have reached much higher values if
all patients with mental illness received adequate professional
treatment. Anxiety is the most prevalent mental disorder,
aﬀecting up to a third of the population at some point in life
(21, 32, 33) with a high economic and social impact (34). Of all
the studies included in this map, most have addressed anxiety.
Of the 67 results for Anxiety Disorders, the vast majority, 56
results, were positive or potentially positive, that is, meditation
can be used as one of the forms of integrative and complementary
treatment for anxiety disorders, as shown in Montero-Marin

et al. (35). In other studies, anxiety was assessed in patients
with other comorbidities, such as cancer (36–39). The prevalence
of anxiety in cancer patients is high (40, 41) and meditation
can help patients to reduce anxiety symptoms as stated in the
meta-analysis carried out by Zhang et al. (42) which included
RCT studies of patients diagnosed with cancer.

In the dimension of health promotion and vitality, 7 moderate
quality reviews highlight relevant eﬀects on quality of life (37,
39, 43–48) obtained through Mindfulness interventions. These
practices can even be done online (49). The fact that meditation
is a potentially self-applicable practice that can be taught from a
distance is especially important in periods of social isolation such
as the one imposed by the covid-19 (50) pandemic.

The use of meditation as a health promotion resource
is growing, with positive outcomes in terms of cognitive
performance (51–53) and sexual performance (54), for example.
Also noteworthy is the development of mindfulness skills
(39, 48, 55–57), compassion (58), empathy (58), and positive
emotions (59).

Integrative resources have been increasingly used in the
context of health promotion (60). Sarris et al. emphasize the
importance of
incorporating practices that support lifestyle
change based on scientiﬁc evidence to support health protocols
and policies (60).

Among the interventions of

(MTCI), meditation is
the most comprehensive in terms of results and variety
of eﬀects. Among the systematic review studies included
in the evidence maps presented in the BVS/MTCI,
the
meditation map is the largest of them,
indirectly showing
the substantial number of studies published on the subject in
recent decades. Meditation techniques can be used by children
and adolescents (63), pregnant women (64), the elderly (65),
health professionals, and caregivers (66, 67),
in addition to
people with chronic diseases (68), having a great potential
from the point of view of public health, given its impact
on physical and metabolic health conditions (63). In cancer
patients, it is possible to highlight the increase in variables such
as physical well-being (69, 70) and psychological well-being
through meditation.

On the physical and metabolic eﬀects of meditation, the
literature has described several relevant factors. The ability
to promote neural plasticity of meditation techniques is very
relevant and has important physical and metabolic impacts (71).
Black and Slavich describe possible eﬀects of meditation to
improve the immune system (72). The literature also speaks of
inﬂammatory and metabolic markers (73) that are altered with
meditative practice.

In this perspective, perhaps interventions such as meditation
are part of a plausible solution to deal with the challenges related
to quaternary prevention in collective health (74, 75) mainly
due to the need to deal with chronic diseases in a preventive

The creation and publication of evidence maps consists of
graphically representing the best evidence found, analyzed and
categorized, with the corresponding bibliographic records and
full texts (when available) of the studies, in order to facilitate
access to information for all interested parties (50).

As it is not the objective of an evidence map, the calculation
of the eﬀect sizes of a meta-analysis was not performed, nor
was the risk of bias assessments performed, but we tried to
overcome these limitations by assessing the quality of

included systematic reviews by applying AMSTAR 2.

The outcomes and eﬀects information presented in this
Meditation Evidence Map will further advance the evidence-
based knowledge of MTCI as proposed by PNPIC in Brazil and
promoted by WHO 2014–2024 and BIREME.

CONCLUSIONS

Meditation practices can be developed by healthy individuals
from
or individuals who have diﬀerent health conditions,
chronic diseases to diﬀerent mental health disorders, with
positive and potentially positive eﬀects on various low-risk
health outcomes.

The practice of meditation can be a safe and eﬀective strategy
for implementing programs in the ﬁeld of collective health. The
possibility of applying it in groups facilitates access and reduces
costs in relation to drug interventions, for example in mild cases
of depression and anxiety, being a potential resource to avoid
chronicity and the negative impact of stress on health.
