Summary
Major depressive disorder is one of the most disabling mental disorders worldwide. Increasing preclinical and clinical
studies have highlighted that compositional and functional (e.g., metabolite) changes in gut microbiota, known as
dysbiosis, are associated with the onset and progression of depression via regulating the gut-brain axis. However, the
gut microbiota and their metabolites present a double-edged sword in depression. Dysbiosis is involved in the
pathogenesis of depression while, at the same time, offering a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we describe the
association between dysbiosis and depression, drug–microbiota interactions in antidepressant treatment, and the
potential health beneﬁts of microbial-targeted therapeutics in depression, including dietary interventions, fecal
microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. With the emergence of microbial
research, we describe a new direction for future research and clinical treatment of depression.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most
disabling mental disorders, affecting over 35 million
people worldwide. MDD is characterized by signiﬁcant
and persistent low mood and is driven by a combination
of genetic and environmental
factors. The recent
pandemic has added a marked depressive burden to this
situation; the 2020 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data
from 204 countries indicates that, throughout 2020, the
COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns led to a
27.6% increase in MDD cases.1

The trillions of microorganisms that

inhabit our
guts, including bacteria, viruses, archaea, and fungi,
play roles in human health. Recent studies have
demonstrated the effects of the gut microbiome on
distal organs, such as the brain. A pivotal role of gut
microbiota in the pathogenesis of MDD has long been
postulated.2 However, a clear cause-effect relationship
has not been deﬁnitively shown. MDD is associated with
microbial dysbiosis, which is deﬁned as an alteration in
microbial diversity owing to the disrupted balance of
microbiota and corresponding functional changes.3

Circumstantial evidence comes from an observed
increased risk of severe mental disorders (e.g., depres-
sion, anxiety, and psychosis) following antibiotic use,
even 5–10 years after use.4–6 A recent systematic review
indicated the association between antibiotics use and
subsequent development of depression.7 This is largely
because antibiotics reduce the diversity of gut micro-
biota.8 Moreover, an unhealthy diet and environmental
exposures that inﬂuence the gut microbial composition
were proved to be highly associated with the increased
incidence of depression in recent years.9,10

microbial therapy. Before this, antidepressants are still

treat-
ment, and the potential clinical
transformations of
microbial-targeted therapeutics for MDD.

Gut microbiota composition and depression
Gut bacterial microbiota dysbiosis and depression
Accumulating studies have shown an association be-
tween dysbiosis and depression (Fig. 1) by reporting
changes in the gut microbial composition of MDD
patients compared to healthy individuals, particularly
in terms of microbial diversity and the relative abun-
dance of speciﬁc bacterial
taxa.3,12,13 Although the
ﬁndings between studies have been inconsistent,
enriched pro-inﬂammatory bacteria and depletion of
anti-inﬂammatory bacteria have been the most
consistent ﬁndings3,13; this is similar to other disease
conditions which are linked with systemic and gut
inﬂammation, further strengthening the case for the
inﬂammatory hypothesis of depression. In depression,
Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes are the
most affected phyla2,14; especially an increase in the

Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio in MDD patients, char-
acterized by an enrichment of the genus Bacteroides
and a depletion of the genera Blautia, Faecalibacte-
rium, and Coprococcus.3,12,13,15 An increase in Egger-
thella and decrease in Sutterella were also consistently
demonstrated in patients with MDD.3,12,13,16 Driven by
succession and within-host evolution throughout life,
gut microbiota have become increasingly patho-
genic,17,18 leading to possible distinct microbial char-
acteristics in MDD patients of different ages.19 There
are also regional differences in microbial compositions
in patients with MDD. For example, several taxa were
primarily identiﬁed in patients from China, such as
increased Eggerthella and decreased Coprococcus, and
Fusicatenibacter.3 However, simple association studies
do not provide information about causality. Trans-
planting of fecal microbiota from MDD patients to
induce depressive-like behaviors in rodents suggests
that microbial dysbiosis precedes MDD onset and
might play a causal role in MDD.2,20 Meanwhile, there
is also evidence supporting a pathological vicious loop
in which depression-associated pathological changes
also cause and exacerbate the dysbiosis.21 Thus, while

microbiome shifts can occur early in MDD and
perhaps contribute to the onset of MDD, over time
pathological changes in MDD further contribute to
dysbiosis by altering the gut environment.

speciﬁcally highlighted,

Potential causative pathobionts in depression
Although global shifts in the gut microbiota have been
reported in patients with MDD, the speciﬁc pathobionts
remain to be fully elucidated. Previous studies sug-
gested that several species belonging to the Bacter-
oidaceae family are speciﬁc to MDD,14 and that species
from Bacteroides (e.g., B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis and
B. uniformis) signiﬁcantly increase the susceptibility to
depression.15,22 Additionally, clinical and preclinical
studies have reported that segmented ﬁlamentous bacteria
increase the susceptibility to depression by promoting T
helper 17 (Th17) cell production.23 Moreover, a large-
scale population-based cohort found that, even though
Morganella was not
the
increasing abundances of Morganella predicted to have a
causal effect on MDD.24 Furthermore, Liu et al.25 iso-
lated Mycobacterium neoaurum, which can degrade
testosterone by expressing the 3β-Hydroxysteroid dehy-
drogenase enzyme, from the feces of male MDD pa-
tients, and found that administering this strain to rats
via oral gavage,
induced depressive-like behaviors.
However, in the context of a complex gut microbial
these speciﬁc pathobionts probably act
community,
synergistically with others to cause depression, rather
than merely as individual infectious agents. The in-
teractions between microbial species are likely quite
complex. Understanding these so-called higher-order
interactions, that generate new effector molecules, may
improve our understanding of the mechanisms under-
lying microbiome–host interactions that contribute to
depression.26

Gut nonbacterial microbiota dysbiosis and
depression
In addition to the intestinal bacteria, nonbacterial
microbiota also participates in the pathogenesis of
depression. As beneﬁcial partners, bacteriophages in-
ﬂuence the function of bacterial microbiota by pro-
moting the diversity of the intestinal bacteria genotypes
and phenotypes.27 Shifts in the composition of bacte-
riophages in MDD patients have been documented,
particularly changes in Caudovirales bacteriophages.15
Similar changes were also identiﬁed in a non-human
primate model of depression, indicating that Caudo-
virales alteration is a hallmark of depression.28 Further,
gut fungal dysbiosis was documented in depressed
patients, and a disrupted fungi-bacteria network ap-
pears to be involved in the onset of depression.29 The
role of Candida albicans in the pathophysiology of
psychiatric diseases such as depression was reviewed
previously.30 The prevalent interactions between bac-
terial and nonbacterial microbiota in the gut are

complex, suggesting that studying the properties of
bacteria in vitro or in vivo without considering other
nonbacterial microbiota might provide a distorted view
of the role of functional networks that,
in reality,
involve multiple individual microorganisms and mi-
crobial communities.

Gut microbiota-derived metabolites and
depression
There are multiple important mediators involved in gut
microbiota-host interactions, such as microbial metab-
olites, derived from the fermentation of dietary sub-
stances by bacteria, and bacterially-modiﬁed host
molecules, such as bile acids (BAs), or products pro-
duced by bacteria directly.31 Shifts in the composition of
gut microbiota in MDD lead to changes in the microbial
metabolome, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of
MDD. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites present a
double-edged sword in depression. Short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs: acetate, butyrate, and propionate) have
been strongly implicated in depression. SCFAs were
reported to be depleted in patients with MDD,2,32 while
their administration resulted in antidepressant effects
by ameliorating depression-related intestinal perme-
ability and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis
reactivity, in particular butyrate.33,34 Neurotransmitters
(e.g., serotonin and gamma amino butyric acid), pro-
duced by the gut microbiota directly or indirectly, can
inﬂuence emotional behavior by modulating local gut
physiology and by regulating the function of distal or-
gans when absorbed into the bloodstream.34 In addition,
the actions of BAs through binding to their dedicated
receptors, farnesoid X receptor and Takeda G-protein-
coupled receptor 5, regulate the physiological metabolic
responses of the body. Disturbances in BA metabolism
have been identiﬁed in MDD35; BA levels, especially of
the secondary BAs modulated by gut microbiota, are
negatively correlated with the severity of depressive
symptoms,35 suggesting a protective role of higher BA
levels for depression. Turicibacterales, Turicibacter-
aceae, and Turicibacter were related to the increased
production of BAs.35 And this taxa has been reported to
reduce in depression state.3 Furthermore, microbiota-
derived trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) from choline
metabolism can cross the blood–brain barrier to inﬂu-
ence brain pathology and the development of neuro-
psychiatric disorders.36 A positive association between
serum TMAO levels and depression severity has been
reported in individuals.37 Other microbiota-derived me-
tabolites such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lactate, and
B-vitamins are also associated with the pathogenesis of
MDD.38–40 The levels of these metabolites reﬂect, at least
in part, the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota.
Beyond the composition of gut microbiota, the micro-
bial function (e.g., metabolism, metabolite) is equally
important, and future diseases studies should take into

account both the microbial composition and functional
changes.

Microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis in depression
Communication between the gut and the brain is bidi-
rectional and involves various routes including neural,
endocrine, and immune pathways.41 The microbiota and
their derived metabolites act as key modulators in gut-
leading to the concept of an MGB
brain signaling,
axis.42 The role of the routes involved in the MGB axis in
depression has been well delineated (Fig. 2). The mi-
crobial composition and metabolites change in MDD
patients results in a disrupted homeostasis of the gut
microenvironment, affecting the function of the gut
epithelium and causing intestinal barrier dysfunction
and inﬂammatory responses.43,44 The increased systemic
translocation of gut metabolites, microbial cell compo-
nents, or even the microbiota via the damaged intestinal
barrier (the “leaky gut”) heightens systemic inﬂamma-
tory responses (e.g., Th17/regulatory T cell (Th17/Treg)
imbalance, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-α)) that have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of depression.45,46 The enteric nervous
system (ENS), referred to as the “second brain”, has
been reported to be involved in the development of
brain disorders. Abnormal ENS activity arising from
depression-related

pathological changes by altering gut secretion, immune
defenses, motility, and permeability.47 Besides the ENS,
the vagus nerve also plays an important role in trans-
mitting microbial signals from the gut to the brain in
depression.48 Preclinical studies have veriﬁed that sub-
diaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the development of
depression-like behaviors in rodents after LPS injection
or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Chrna7
knock-out mice with depression-like behaviors.48,49 In
clinical, vagus nerve stimulation has long been approved
for treatment-resistant depression.50 The microbial cell
components, e.g., LPS produced by gram-negative bac-
teria, and peripheral inﬂammatory signals reach the
brain by crossing the blood–brain barrier resulting in
neuroinﬂammation,38 subsequently induce neuropatho-
logical changes through chronic activating speciﬁc cells,
including synaptic defects, demyelination, abnormal
neurogenesis and neurotransmitters release,22,51–53 that
are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Micro-
bial signals, pathological neurobiological changes, and
depressive emotions
can activate the HPA axis,
increasing the synthesis and release of cortisol. As a part
of the brain-gut axis, excessive levels of cortisol promote
gut pathology by modulating intestinal barrier function
and inﬂammatory responses, resulting in a leaky gut54;
this process is a key component of the MGB axis in
depression. Beyond these routes, various signal trans-
duction systems and metabolic pathways are also

tamine shows long-lasting antidepressant effects and
can be effective for treatment-resistant patients. Gut
microbiota is an important modulator of the antide-
pressant effects of Ketamine and its enantiomer R-ke-
tamine.77 Phylum Actinobacteria, class Coriobacteriia,
and SCFAs producing genera, such as Butyricimonas
and Turicibacter, might contribute to the robust antide-
pressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomer in
depression.78,79 Furthermore, due to the effects of
microbiota on drug toxicity, the chronic use of most
drugs, from all categories, potentially causes various
adverse effects
in some patients,80
including an
increased risk of diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal
symptoms and cardiovascular diseases. Correcting gut
dysbiosis by using probiotics or other interventional
strategies might help reverse the antidepressant-
associated adverse effects.80

It is worth mentioning that most previous studies
only assessed the drug–microbiota interactions for in-
dividual drugs. However, patients with MDD are often
prescribed multiple antidepressants and medications for
comorbidities; this polypharmacy approach may cause
bias in the interpretation of drug–microbiota in-
teractions. Importantly, the actual drug–microbiota in-
teractions are far more complex than suggested by
current reductionist ﬁndings from preclinical studies.

With the
depression, a deeper understanding of the bidirectional
interactions between drugs and the gut microbiome will
emerge that explains how antidepressants affect gut
microbial composition and function and how the

theoretical foundation of how we can exploit the gut
microbiome to improve the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
antidepressants.

The interactions between gut microbiota and
antidepressants
The effects of antidepressants on gut microbiota
composition
Currently, drugs interventions are still the therapeutic
mainstays in depression. Drugs, especially those taken
orally, have a signiﬁcant effect on gut microbial
composition and function. Interactions between drugs
and microbiota can alter bacterial metabolism and drug
activity and efﬁcacy. There is evidence that clinically
utilized antidepressants have antimicrobial effects,
especially on gram-positive bacteria.60 Selective seroto-
nin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs), tricyclic
antidepressants, and others alter the microbial diversity
and composition (Table 1).60–68 As reported, SSRIs
treatment increase the abundance of intestinal Eubac-
terium ramulus while tricyclic antidepressants increase
the abundance of Clostridium leptum.69 Duloxetine also
markedly increases the abundance of Eubacterium rectale
by more than 100-fold when compared to a no-drug
group.70 Since these bacteria are known to produce
anti-inﬂammatory butyrate during bacterial metabolism,
their increased abundance may impose an adjuvant ef-
fect on antidepressant therapy, thereby increasing the
beneﬁcial drug effects.71 These data suggest that anti-
depressants alter gut microbial composition and func-
tion,
their
antidepressant effects. In addition, a prospective cohort
study demonstrated that gut microbiota may be used as
treatment outcome in
a predictor of antidepressant
geriatric depression; enrichment of Faecalibacterium,
Roseburia and Agathobacter relative to Lachnoclostridium
(a reference frame) at baseline was associated with
depression remission.72

the possibility of the gut microbiota as a novel thera-
peutic target for depression. Accumulating evidence
supports the efﬁcacy of various microbiota-target thera-
peutics in alleviating depression, including dietary in-
terventions, FMT, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and
postbiotics.

Probiotics
Probiotics are live microorganisms that beneﬁt host
health when administered in adequate amounts. Pro-
biotics are the most studied microbiota-targeting thera-
pies for depression. A previous comprehensive study
identiﬁed 178 species and subspecies probiotics that can
attenuate depression; most probiotic regimens for
depression treatment are based on Lactobacillus spp. and
Biﬁdobacterium spp.3 RCTs have demonstrated the efﬁ-
cacy of various probiotic species in the treatment of
clinical depression (Table

CCFM1025. However, it is important to note that some
studies have reported negative results.104,105 Although
unknown, heterogeneity in the cohort characteristics
and/or the interventions may underlie these mixed
ﬁndings. An umbrella meta-analysis reported a robust
effect of probiotics on relieving depression symptoms in
adults only when administered for >8 weeks at a dosage
of >10 × 109 colony forming units.106 However,
to
accurately screen probiotics for use in MDD treatment,
we must understand the structure and function of gut
microbiota and the effects of various confounding fac-
tors (e.g., geographical region, age, comorbidity) in pa-
the interaction of
tients with depression. Moreover,

enhancing the antidepressant efﬁcacy of probiotics,
suggesting that the judicious use of multi-species pro-
biotics may be more effective than single species.107
Furthermore, in recent years, a group of microorgan-
isms that perform special functions in the host and are
very difﬁcult to cultivate have shown great probiotic
potential; these are called the “next generation pro-
biotics” and include Akkermansia spp. and Clostridium
spp. A. muciniphila and C. butyricum miyairi 588 were
shown to ameliorate stress-induced depressive-like
behavior in mice.99,108,109 However, there is still a gap
between laboratory research and clinical application. To
achieve clinical translation, researchers must ﬁrst over-
come this obstacle.

Prebiotics
Prebiotics are substrates that are beneﬁcial for host
health by being selectively utilized by gut microbiota.
This can promote the growth of some beneﬁcial bacte-
ria. A previous study summarized the preclinical and
clinical evidence for the antidepressant effects of various
prebiotics.3 Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-
oligosaccharides (GOS) are the most documented pre-
biotics in the treatment of depression, along with poly-
phenols, inulin, and compounds from vegetables, herbs,
and plants. For example, chronic prebiotic FOS and

diversity, lower levels of gastrointestinal inﬂammation,
and the integrity of the intestinal barrier.83 Microbiota-
derived SCFAs, especially propionate and butyrate, act
as a key mechanistic link between MD and gut patho-
physiology.83 Yang et al.84 evaluated the relationship be-
tween relative carbohydrate intake and depression based
on genetic information from over 400,000 people and
found that a 16% increase in carbohydrate-based calo-
ries was associated with a 58% decrease in the risk of
depression; this protective effect has some causality. In
general, a healthy dietary pattern that includes high
levels of plant compounds, vitamins, minerals, poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, and dietary ﬁbers was recom-
mend for patients who have or are predisposed to
depression. Due to individual differences in the genome
and gut microbiome, the use of a personalized diet was
suggested. However, dietary interventions alone should
be used cautiously in the treatment of clinical depres-
sion;
in-
these need to be combined with other
terventions, such as antidepressant drugs, psychological
interventions, and lifestyle regulation.

FMT
FMT is a rapid approach to reshaping the patient’s gut
microbiota by the administration of fecal ﬂora from
healthy donors; this makes it a promising intervention
strategy for chronic diseases associated with dysbiosis.
In preclinical studies, FMT has been widely docu-
mented as being able to alleviate depressive-like
behavior. Transplanting microbiota from healthy do-

ually improved depression symptoms, regardless of
gastrointestinal symptom remission.90 These positive
therapeutic effects in patients with concomitant IBS-D,
anxiety, and depression were further veriﬁed in an
RCT.91 Another RCT assessed the efﬁcacy of oral frozen
FMT-capsules as an add-on therapy in MDD patients
and found that depressive symptoms improved signiﬁ-
cantly 4 weeks after transplantation.92 Similar to autism,
FMT therapy for depression also improves the gastro-
intestinal symptoms and rebalances the gut ecosystem.93

Summary and prospects
Gut microbiota plays a vital role in regulating human
health. In recent years, abundant research has uncov-
ered the effects of gut microbiota and its metabolites on
the pathogenesis of depression. Microbiota-based di-
agnostics and therapeutics for depression are the future
directions of research. In moving the ﬁeld forward,
many key challenges need to be addressed and some
(1)
recommendations provided might be useful:
Exploring the causal relationship between gut micro-
biome and depression. More prospective studies are
required to analyze the interplay between the develop-
ment of dysbiosis and depression, and drug–microbiota
interactions,
to uncover the causal relationships be-
tween dysbiosis, depression, and treatment. In partic-
ular, we need to better understand if the antidepressant
effects of drugs can be enhanced by modulating gut
microbiota; (2) Elaborating the pathological mechanism

microbiota-based therapies can result in the remission
of depression, but little is known about their mecha-
nisms of action, the key microbiota, and how these
bacteria interact; (3) Isolating the bacteria to construct
the disease-based gut microbial biobank. More studies
are required that utilize high-throughput sequencing,
multi-omics approaches, and microbial culture tech-
nology to isolate the pathogenic and beneﬁcial strains
involved in depression, identify the exact functions of
these strains, and uncover the underlying mechanisms
involved in the gut-brain axis, to build a disease-based
strain resource database; (4) Analyzing the confound-
ing effects to promote the development of microbiota-
based diagnostics and therapeutics. The effects of
various confounding factors should not be ignored
when analyzing the changes of microbial structure and
function in depression. We must better understand how
the composition, proportion, and abundance changes of
gut microbiota contribute to various cases of MDD. This
will build a foundation for targeted therapeutic manip-
ulation and ﬁnally impel the uptake of microbiota-based
personalized precision medicine for depression;

Synbiotics
The development of probiotics and prebiotics has led to
the development of synbiotics which combine the ad-
vantages of both. A synbiotic supplementation (con-
taining L. acidophilus, L. casei and B. biﬁdum plus inulin)
improved depressive symptoms in overweight or obese
adults,112
supplement
and
symbiotic
strain T16, B. biﬁdum strain BIA-6,
(L. acidophilus
B. lactis strain BIA-7 and B. longum strain BIA-8 plus
FOS, GOS, and inulin) was found to decrease depres-
sion scores in hemodialysis patients and increase serum
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in a subgroup
of patients with depression.113,114 Given the symbiotic
relationships between probiotics and prebiotics, syn-
biotics are likely to drive the next breakthroughs in
depression treatment. The simultaneous administration
of probiotics and prebiotics is believed to improve the
activity of beneﬁcial gut bacteria. However, the formu-
lation of effective synbiotics is contingent on the careful
selection of the correct probiotic strains and prebiotics.

Postbiotics
The inanimate microbial cells and/or their components
and metabolites that are beneﬁcial to host health are
deﬁned as postbiotics. This class offers a novel microbial
therapeutic approach for depression. Studies have re-
ported that pretreatment with heat-killed probiotic
L. plantarum-derived postbiotics, particularly their metab-
olites, protected mice from Salmonella-induced depressive-
like behavior by modulating the gut-brain axis.115 Some
bacterial metabolites such as SCFAs and BAs act as
postbiotics. Oral treatment with sodium butyrate restored
paclitaxel-induced alterations in microbiota composition
and gut barrier integrity and relieved depressive-like be-
haviors in mice.116 Despite the apparent antidepressant
effects of probiotics, the potential adverse effects associ-
ated with administrating live bacteria to seriously ill pa-
tients or other vulnerable populations remain unknown.
At present, there is still a lack of sufﬁcient scientiﬁc evi-
dence to properly eliminate this concern. Therefore,
postbiotics that exert similar health beneﬁts to probiotics
might offer a novel and safer alternative to probiotics for
the treatment of depression. Although there are few
studies on postbiotic-based depression treatments, post-
biotics offer a promising approach to utilizing microbial
therapeutics for this condition.

depression, and this is a next frontier in microbiome
research.

Outstanding questions
Dysbiosis is associated with depression, although spe-
ciﬁc gut microbial changes are not consistently identi-
ﬁed across studies. Gut microbiota is easily inﬂuenced
by external factors such as diet; the compositions of gut
microbiota in two healthy individuals are likely to be
markedly different. Therefore, the effects of various
confounding factors on gut microbiota should be clari-
ﬁed in future studies. In addition, large-scale prospec-
tive studies are required to (1) identify the characteristic
microbial changes of depression that change in parallel
with depression symptoms, (2) determine the patho-
genic and beneﬁcial strains involved in depression and
their cause-effect relationships, and (3) elaborate the
underlying gut-brain mechanisms that are involved in
the pathogenesis of depression. Ultimately, this work
should generate a disease-related strain resource data-
base. Furthermore, in the complex intestinal environ-
ment, there are myriad bacteria–bacteria and bacteria–
metabolite interactions that need to be considered
when exploring the function of speciﬁc bacterial strains
and developing gut microbiota-target
therapeutics.
Much remains unknown about the microbiota-host re-
lationships and future work is needed to further
describe these interactions and the possible inﬂuence of
interventions targeting microbiota on the host. Indeed,
there are still many challenges to developing gut
microbiota-target therapeutics for depression, and we
hope that more new technologies and approaches will
emerge in this ﬁeld to address these challenges.
