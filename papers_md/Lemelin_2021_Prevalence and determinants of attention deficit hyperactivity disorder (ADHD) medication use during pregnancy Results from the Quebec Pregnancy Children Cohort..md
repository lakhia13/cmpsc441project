Abstract

Aims:  The	 use	 of	 attention	 deficit/hyperactivity	 disorder	 (ADHD)	 medications	 has	

grown	over	the	past	decade	among	pregnant	women,	but	these	treatments	are	not	

without	risk.	Updated	prevalence	of	ADHD	medication	use	and	whether	prescribed	

dosages follow guidelines are needed. The aim of this study is to describe the preva-

lence	of	ADHD	medication	use	among	pregnant	women—	dosages	and	switches—	and	

identify	determinants	of	ADHD	medication	use.

Method: A	population-	based	longitudinal	cohort	study	within	the	Quebec	Pregnancy/

Children	 Cohort	 (QPC).	 Women	 aged	 15–	45	 years	 old	 covered	 by	 the	 RAMQ	 pre-

scription drug plan for at least 12 months before and during pregnancy from 1998 to 

2015.	 ADHD	 medication	 exposure	 was	 assessed	 before	 and	 during	 pregnancy.	 We	

estimated	odds	ratios	(ORs)	for	determinants	of	ADHD	medication	use	during	preg-

nancy with generalized estimating equations.

Results: Among	428,505	included	pregnant	women,	1,130	(0.26%)	used	ADHD	medi-

cation.	 A	 14-	fold	 increase	 in	 the	 prevalence	 of	 ADHD	 medication	 use	 in	 pregnant	

women	was	observed,	from	1998	(0.08%)	to	2015	(1.2%).	Methylphenidate	was	the	

most	prevalent	medication	at	70.1%.	ADHD	medication	fillings	were	at	optimal	dos-

age	91.8%	of	the	time	based	on	guidelines	and	18.1%	of	women	switched	to	another	

ADHD	 medication	 class	 during	 gestation.	 Main	 determinants	 of	 ADHD	 medication	

use	during	pregnancy	were	psychiatric	disorders	(aOR	2.19;	95%	confidence	interval	

[CI]	1.57,	2.96),	mood	and	anxiety	disorders	(aOR	1.74;	95%	CI	1.32,	2.24),	and	calen-

dar year.

Conclusions:  The	 number	 of	 pregnancies	 exposed	 to	 ADHD	 medications	 has	 in-

creased	similarly	to	the	increase	reported	in	other	countries	between	1998	and	2015.	

In	addition	to	the	current	literature,	the	use	of	ADHD	medications	during	pregnancy	

is consistent with Canadian guidelines recommendations on dosage.

What is already known?

Attention	deficit/hyperactivity	disorder	(ADHD)	medication	use	among	pregnant	women	has	

increased	significantly.	There	is	little	information	on	the	most	recent	prevalence	of	ADHD	medi-

cation	use	in	pregnancy	and	its	long-	term	trends.	There	are	no	updated	data	on	dosages	and	

characteristics	of	ADHD	medications,	while	adverse	outcomes	following	their	use	have	been	

reported in children.

What this study adds?

Previous	studies	have	focused	on	ADHD	medication	use	in	children	and	adults.	This	study	adds	

to	 the	 literature	 by	 reporting	 on	 the	 ADHD	 medication	 use	 in	 pregnant	 women	 according	 to	

guideline	recommendations,	as	well	as	details	about	determinants	of	use	and	dosage.

disorders.45	Not 	less 	than 	80% 	of 	adults 	with 	ADHD 	condition 	
would  have  at  least  one  comorbid  psychiatric  disorder.46,47  This

more	 protective	 estimate.	 As	 the	 information	 about	 lifestyles	 in

could	 also	 be	 explained	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 mothers	 with	 ADHD	 or

psychiatric	disorders	had	a	more	positive	attitude	towards	ADHD

plan	 in	 Quebec	 (RAMQ),	 which	 may	 consist	 of	 women	 of	 lower

In	this	large	population-	based	cohort	study	among	pregnant	women,	

the	 estimated	 prevalence	 of	 ADHD	 medication	 use	 in	 pregnancy	

was	1.2%	in	2015,	representing	a	significant	increase	in	prevalence	

from 1998. Stimulants were also shown to be the most widely used 

class	 of	 ADHD	 medications.	 Specifically,	 this	 increase	 is	 mainly	

driven  by  methylphenidate.  Independently  from  the  main  indica-

tion,	several	determinants	such	as	mood	and	anxiety	disorder,	and	

other	psychiatric	disorders	were	associated	with	ADHD	medication	

use  in  pregnancy.  While  fetal  consequences  of  prenatal  exposure 

are	still	to	be	determined,	an	increasing	number	of	pregnant	women	

are	 taking	 ADHD	 medications.	 Furthermore,	 the	 consequences	 of	

untreated	ADHD	on	mother	and	newborn	need	to	be	considered.
