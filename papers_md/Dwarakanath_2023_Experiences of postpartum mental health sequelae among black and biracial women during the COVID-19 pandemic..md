Abstract
Objective  The objective of this study was to qualitatively examine coping mechanisms and desired supports in 
pregnant and birthing Black and Biracial adolescent and young adult women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods  Black and Biracial participants ages 16–23 were recruited for virtual individual semi-structured interviews. 
Participants (n = 25) were asked about pre- and post-natal experiences with the healthcare system, effects of the 
pandemic, and participants’ experiences of or desires for ideal care within the healthcare system. Interviews were 
transcribed verbatim and coded for qualitative analysis using nVivo. Discussions around postpartum mental health 
evolved organically when asked about how participants were coping postpartum.

Results  Nearly half the interviewees organically reported mental health symptoms consistent with postpartum 
depression (PPD) during questions regarding their postpartum experience. Of the 11 interviewees who reported 
mental health symptoms consistent with PPD, 2 were afraid to disclose their symptoms to a healthcare provider due 
to fear of child protective services involvement and their belief they would be treated unfairly because of their race.

Conclusion  Clinicians who care for Black and Biracial adolescent and young adult mothers must be particularly 
attuned to structural barriers for appropriate screening and treatment of postpartum depression. Expanding 
investigations of intersectional influences on young mothers’ perinatal health and PPD are needed.

Introduction
Adolescence is already a period of significant social, emo-
tional,  and  physical  transition,  to  which  the  addition  of 
motherhood can create further stress. Depressive symp-
toms are noted to have higher incidence among pregnant 
adolescents  and  young  adults  (AYA)  compared  to  their

nonpregnant peers [1], in part due to age related stigma 
[2, 3]. In fact, individuals who transition to motherhood 
at  younger  ages  report  more  depressive  symptoms  [4]. 
Young mothers must also navigate the new role as a par-
ent  within  an  existing  structure  of  peer  relations  with 
peers that may not have similar experiences and respon-
sibilities  [5].  Adolescent  mothers  may  be  at  increased 
risk  of  facing  socioeconomic  challenges  including  lower 
income, single parent status [6] as well as social and emo-
tional risk factors such as intimate partner violence, fam-
ily conflict, low self-esteem and fewer social supports [7]. 
These  risk  factors  may  be  particularly  compounded  by

structural  inequities  and  racism,  as  literature  has  dem-
onstrated that low income Black and Hispanic women in 
the general population may be more likely to suffer from 
postpartum depression [8]. They are also less likely to ini-
tiate postpartum mental health care as well as follow-up 
treatment for postpartum depression [9].

During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  rates  of  postpar-
tum depression escalated dramatically. According to one 
meta-analysis,  the  prevalence  of  postpartum  depression 
was  34%  during  COVID-19,  compared  to  10%  in  devel-
oped countries and 21–26% in developing countries prior 
to the pandemic [10]. Several risk factors associated with 
postpartum  depression  including  fewer  social  supports 
and lower income with unemployment [10] likely became 
exacerbated during the pandemic. This may have contrib-
uted to the the marked increase in depressive symptoms, 
especially  for  minoritzed  women  disproportionately 
affected  by  the  pandemic  [11].  Pregnant  Black  women 
have reported more stress, financial strain, and concerns 
about their medical care during the pandemic compared 
to pregnant non-Hispanic white women [12–14].

With  the  multiplicity  of  risk  factors  that  predispose 
minority  mothers  to  postpartum  depression,  under-
standing and intervening to treat mental health sequelae 
of  adolescent  pregnancy  is  paramount  for  both  mater-
nal  and  infant  outcomes.  Unaddressed  PPD  could  have 
potentially devastating consequences for both infants and 
mothers  including  poor  neurodevelopmental  outcomes 
in  infants,  and  low  self-esteem,  intimate-partner  vio-
lence,  suicidal  ideation,  difficulties  with  parenting  skills, 
substance use disorder, and persistent mental illness after 
the  postpartum  period  in  mothers  [15].  Underreporting 
of postpartum depression, especially among Black moth-
ers, is known more broadly in the literature.

The results of one study with low-income Black moth-
ers  in  New  York  City  suggest  that  this  population  may 
be  underdiagnosed  and  undertreated  for  postpartum 
depression.  In  this  pilot  intervention  to  prevent  depres-
sion  among  the  general  population  (i.e.,  not  specific  to 
adolescents  and  young  adults),  clinical  social  work  staff 
noted  that  patients  were  reluctant  to  acknowledge  the 
impact  of  stress  and  mental  health  on  screening  tools, 
due  to  stigma  as  well  as  not  having  practice  and  a  dis-
connect  between  how  patients  might  express  mental 
health concerns and how providers ask about or interpret 
answers.  One  of  the  social  workers  in  the  study  stated 
that patients were concerned that disclosure about men-
tal  health  issues  would  lead  to  child  protective  service 
involvement.  Another  social  worker  noted  that  partici-
pants would screen negative on a PHQ-9, only to disclose 
symptoms of stress and concern after building trust with 
a  provider. Only 15%  of participants scored  10  or above 
on  the  PHQ-9  during  the  time  period  of  the  interven-
tion,  a  low  percentage  given  the  financial  stressors  and 

race-based  discrimination  that  impacted  the  sample. 
Interestingly,  in  the  same  intervention,  many  patients 
deferred  services  for  postpartum  depression,  citing  that 
they  could  handle  the  stress  or  had  support  from  their 
church. They may have also deferred it due to mistrust or 
negative community experiences with mental health sys-
tems.  Only  two  of  the  30  eligible  participants  for  inter-
vention followed up with the program [16].

As  underreporting  of  PPD  may  be  high  among  low-
income  Black  mothers,  it  is  paramount  to  better  under-
stand  the  experiences  of  Black  adolescent  and  young 
adult  pregnancies,  particularly  those  demonstrating 
symptoms  of  PPD,  and  to  determine  barriers  to  treat-
ment. This is critical to ameliorating gaps in care for the 
most vulnerable patients during a challenging life transi-
tion. Therefore,  the  objective  of  this  study  was  to  quali-
tatively examine the pregnancy experiences of adolescent 
and  young  adult  Black  and  Biracial  women  during  the 
novel coronavirus pandemic in one geographic region, to 
assess coping mechanisms and desired supports.

Methods
Setting and context

This  qualitative  study  was  conducted  as  a  secondary 
analysis  of  an  existing  project,  the  YoungMoms  study 
(R01DA046401),  a  longitudinal  cohort  study  designed 
to  examine  perinatal  cannabis  and  tobacco  co-use  in 
young  people  and  associated  infant  outcomes.  The  pur-
pose of the secondary analysis–which was conducted as 
the larger study continues–was to qualitatively assess the 
impact of COVID-19 on the experiences of young Black 
and  Biracial  mothers,  particularly  regarding  substance 
use, which was being evaluated in the larger study. Preg-
nant  persons  ages  13–21  were  recruited  at  or  before  a 
prenatal  visit.  Participants  who  completed  the  baseline 
survey and were < 14 weeks gestation were recruited for 
the  longitudinal  study.  YoungMoms  participants  who 
identified as Black or Biracial in the survey but who were 
not  enrolled  in  the  longitudinal  study  were  recruited 
(by  telephone,  email  or  text  message)  to  participate  in 
45–60-minute  semi-structured,  in-depth  interviews  for 
this  qualitative  study.  IRB  approval  was  obtained  after 
review by the University of Pittsburgh Office of Research 
Protections.  We  followed  Consolidated  Criteria  for 
Reporting  Qualitative  Research  (COREQ)  guidelines 
[17].

Interview guide development

The  interview  guide  was  developed  by  the  PI  of  the 
YoungMoms study in collaboration with a Co-Investiga-
tor with expertise on Black women’s reproductive health 
(AH)  and  further  refined  with  feedback  from  the  inter-
viewers  (ND  &  AH).  Open-ended  questions  focused  on 
the  impacts  of  structural  and  racial  discrimination  as

well  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  pregnancy  and 
postpartum experiences of Black and Biracial adolescents 
and young adults (see Supplement). Biracial interviewees 
identified as Black and one other race, and were included 
in  the  study  as  noted  to  have  experiences  of  being  seen 
as  Black  in  the  healthcare  system.  Substance  use  was 
not an inclusion criteria for the parent study or the sec-
ondary  analysis.  Participants  were  asked  about  pre-  and 
post-natal experiences with the healthcare system, effects 
of  the  pandemic  (including  social  isolation,  vaccination 
status, and infection; coping mechanisms and substance 
use);  obstetric  racism;  and  participant-driven  notions 
and  experiences  of  ideal  care  within  the  healthcare  sys-
tem. Interviews lasted roughly 45–60 min. Although not 
the  intended  purpose  of  this  investigation  at  inception, 
many  of  the  participants  (n = 11)  described  symptoms 
concerning for postpartum depression organically as part 
of their narrative regarding their postpartum experience, 
though  no  formal  screening  of  postpartum  depression 
was conducted. The first questions in the guide were used 
to  establish  rapport  with  the  participant  and  elicit  sto-
ries about the most recent pregnancy. At the end of each 
interview, participants were asked open-ended questions 
to give them the opportunity to share further questions, 
concerns, or stories that we might have missed. It was in 
this  open-ended  part  of  the  interview  that  we  noted  so 
many  narratives  noting  participants’  struggle  with  post-
partum  mental  health  sequelae.  Many  of  the  responses 
regarding  postpartum  mental  health  sequelae  were 
noted after the interviewer posed the question “How was 
your postpartum?” Of note, it was posited by a commu-
nity member who also reviewed this paper that in some 
communities,  postpartum  can  be  colloquial  for  postpar-
tum  depression  which  may  have  precipitated  narratives 
around postpartum mental health sequelae. This created 
the desire to further capture and understand the postpar-
tum experiences, specifically around why they may have 
hesitated to bring up symptoms concerning for postpar-
tum depression and/or seek care.

Data collection

A  research  team  member  recruited  eligible  individu-
als  by  telephone,  provided  details  about  the  study,  and 
answered any questions from those interested in partici-
pating.  Participants  provided  verbal  informed  consent 
and were offered $50 on a gift card for their participation. 
Interviews  were  conducted  remotely  over  Zoom  by  two 
interviewers  (F.H.,  M.D.).  A  clinician  and  a  researcher 
with  experience  conducting  qualitative  research  con-
ducted  the  interviews  (F.H.  and  M.D.),  which  allowed 
for  a  balance  of  interviewing  strategies  and  approaches 
in  the  semi-structured  interview  format.  The  interviews 
were recorded and transcribed with the Zoom transcrip-
tion  feature.  Interviews  were  then  de-identified  and  the 

transcripts  were  manually  edited  by  a  student  and  two 
of  the  authors  (MM,  FH)  to  reflect  the  audio  recording. 
Interviews were conducted until the research team con-
cluded thematic saturation was achieved. Thematic satu-
ration  was  achieved  when  both  separate  coding  teams 
agreed  that  interview  themes  started  to  become  redun-
dant  and  could  be  sufficiently  captured  by  the  existing 
codebook.  Demographic  data  were  collected  from  the 
survey for the parent study.

Data analysis

The  research  team  used  thematic  content  analysis  to 
identify major themes and subthemes, with the prelimi-
nary  codebook  developed  from  5  interviews.  Thematic 
content analysis is a methodology of qualitative descrip-
tive  research  which  involves  the  systematic  process  of 
examining  an  interview  text  for  themes,  developing 
descriptive  terms  for  those  themes,  and  coding  the  text 
under  those  themes.  The  description  and  interpreta-
tion  of  participants’  narratives  are  subjective,  but  some 
researchers believe this allows for less inference in inter-
preting the interview text [18].

The process also relied on inductive analysis, where the 
codes were developed from the participants’ own words 
rather than a pre-prescribed set of codes that were then 
applied to the text [19]. Two teams of investigators (F.H. 
and M.D; P.B. and M.M) coded the interviews separately 
using  qualitative  analysis  software  (NVivo)  Code  books 
were then compared for agreement and finalized through 
consensus,  with  iterative  refinement  of  the  codebook  as 
more interviews were completed and coded.

Results
We  interviewed  25  study  participants  (88%  Black,  12% 
Biracial)  who  ranged  from  16  to  23  years  of  age  at  the 
time  they  participated  in  this  study  (March-July  2022). 
Within  this  range,  3  participants  were  between  the  ages 
of  16–17;  6  between  18  and  19;  and  16  between  20  and 
23.  This  means  that  approximately  1/3  of  our  partici-
pants were interviewed when they were considered teen-
agers  (between  the  ages  of  16–19),  and  the  majority  of 
participants  (n = 32)  were  in  early  adolescence  (between 
the ages of 18–24). This was the first pregnancy for most 
participants (n = 15). Additional sociodemographic char-
acteristics  are  presented  in  Table  1.  Out  of  the  eleven 
participants  reporting  symptoms  consistent  with  post-
partum  depression,  only  two  participants  reported  tell-
ing their health care provider about these symptoms, and 
only one reported that they were subsequently connected 
to resources. Three participants specifically reported fear 
of child protective services as a reason for not reporting.

Four  major  themes  were  delineated  using  inductive 
analysis  on  the  narratives  of  participants:  (1)  Symptom-
atology  Consistent  with  Postpartum  Depression  (2)

Self-Blame  Around  Postpartum  Mental  Health  Sequelae 
; (3) Fear Admitting Postpartum Mental Health Sequelae 
to  a  Health  Care  Provider,  and  (4)  Social  Support  and 
Affirmation as Critical Elements in Coping with Postpar-
tum Mental Health Sequelae, represented in Table 2.

Theme 1: symptomatology consistent with postpartum 
depression

Despite  the  interview  guide  not  explicitly  asking  about 
postpartum  depression,  of  25  participants,  11  described 
symptomatology  consistent  with  postpartum  depres-
sion while describing their postpartum experiences. The 
symptoms of postpartum depression, based on the com-
monly  used  Edinburgh  Postpartum  Depression  Screen, 
include  anhedonia,  self-blame,  feelings  of  being  over-
whelmed, increased tearfulness, anxiety, difficulty coping, 
difficulty  sleeping,  and  suicidality.  Mothers  are  gener-
ally screened at the six-week postpartum visit, a visit for 
which  only  40%  of  mothers  return  [20].  With  the  addi-
tional  burden  of  the  pandemic,  Black  women–already 
noted to have lower attendance rates for postpartum vis-
its  compared  to  white  counterparts  while  also  showing 
slower recovery for attendance as the pandemic impacts 
subsided  [21],  signifying  those  opportunities  for  Black 
women  to  be  appropriately  diagnosed  and  treated  for 
mental health sequelae related to pregnancy and postpar-
tum has been further diminished by the pandemic. One 
of our participants [Q1] described wanting to “run away 
from it all.” The same interviewee later reflected that the 
interview  had  given  her  the  opportunity  to  express  how 
exhausted  she  was,  describing  her  fatigue  and  feelings 

Page 4 of 9

of  being  overwhelmed,  both  of  which  are  assessed  in 
screens for postpartum depression. A second participant 
went so far as to say that she suffered from postpartum, 
a colloquial term for postpartum depression and did not 
believe the phenomenon was real until her own struggle 
[Q3]. She also is quick to say her child was the antidote to 
the depression, calling her child the prize for her struggle. 
This may be the result of embedded cultural expectations 
that  may  make  both  disclosing  postpartum  depression 
and seeking care difficult as it means not acknowledging 
the gift of one’s child.

Theme 2: self-blame around postpartum mental health 
sequelae

A second theme was participants’ self-blame around feel-
ings  consistent  with  postpartum  depression.  The  notion 
that  postpartum  mental  health  sequelae  was  the  fault 
of  the  mother  and–sometimes  by  extension–addressed 
by  the  mother  alone–was  noted  among  participants.  As 
noted  earlier,  one  of  our  participants  did  not  believe  it 
was  real  until  she  experienced  it  herself,  even  acknowl-
edging that she saw it as a personal failure among [Q6]. 
Even  in  the  endorsements  of  symptoms  consistent  with 
postpartum depression, an interviewee stated she did not 
disclose  her  tearfulness  to  her  partner,  wanting  to“deal 
with it herself.”

One  of  the  interviewees  expressed  her  frustration 
around postpartum depression symptoms of fatigue and 
feeling  overwhelmed  despite  being  a  single  mother  of 
three children [Q4]. She even expressed disappointment 
in  her  exhaustion,  stating  “I  feel  I  should  not  be  physi-
cally tired of doing a routine that I am comfortable with 
doing.” The challenges of single parenthood, and the self-
doubt surrounding one’s ability to meet those challenges 
was  expressed  by  another  participant  [Q5],  who  asked 
herself whether she was good enough to be her son’s par-
ent–whether she alone could provide a good life for her 
son.  This  was  the  same  participant  who  did  not  believe 
postpartum depression was a real entity until she started 
to  have  experiences  of  postpartum  depression  herself 
[Q6].  She  even  noted  that  she  conceived  of  postpartum 
as  a  reflection  of  character,  stating  “I  really  just  thought 
it  was  just  some  way  that  moms  and  women  made  an 
excuse to be, in my eyes, the bad person they were.”

Another  participant  reported  not  even  being  able  to 
tell her partner due to the desire to “deal with that myself 
[Q7].”

Lack  of  comfort  disclosing  depression  to  social  sup-
ports  might  have  increased  the  intensity  of  emotion 
and  prolonged  and  enhanced  feelings  of  isolation  for 
this  young  mother.  It  may  also  be  a  further  suggestion 
that  the  participant  also  understood  postpartum  mental 
health sequelae to be a personal problem.

Table 2  Themes from Qualitative Interviews with Participants
Symptomatol-
ogy Consistent 
with Postpar-
tum Depression

Q1. “But when I say that I don’t know what I mean… I don’t know if I mean like just literally physically, stop doing everything like 
just stay in one spot, I don’t know if that means that I wanna maybe pack my own bags up and run away from all of my problems 
or your problems or life. My life. This life. You know I know genuinely you know I don’t wanna harm myself. I don’t want to harm 
my children at all, but I just sometimes wish that I could go into a zone.”
Q2. “You’re probably helping me right now, but it’s like damn, just in a little bit- I always have you tell people if I use a timer in my 
head that’s ticking every time I turn around, I gotta do this. I’m on this. I got- and I’m just- I’m tired of being tired.
Q3. “So it’s like, it’s a lot, and I just hope that anybody that does go through it just is, strong, clear-minded, level, because it’s a lot, 
but the baby is, the baby is what makes postpartum disappear. Okay, that’s the best part. That’s the prize at the end. And when I 
look at them, I can forget all about everything.”
Q4. “That’s where my mental frustration comes from, because I’m tired of complaining of being tired, because generally I how I 
feel I should not be physically tired of… of doing- of doing a routine that I’m comfortable with doing, the routine that I set. You 
know my frustration comes from, you know- Just the type of person that I am, I- I’m talking and working. I’m trying to learn how to 
be selfish and just tackle and do what I gotta handle and do, because I feel like I get overwhelmed when I’m taking on so much-”
Q5. “I wasn’t thinking about like killing myself or anything like that, but I would just feel down, think about like “Am I good enough 
to be like my son’s parent?” like his dad is not around so you know, I was just, I was just thinking about that too much in him hav-
ing a good life with just having me so that would like put me down a little bit so that’s what caused my postpartum.”
Q6. “Postpartum, I didn’t believe it was real at first, I really just thought it was just some way that moms and women just made 
an excuse just to be, in my eyes, just be the bad person they were, or to let the feelings out that they had. It took me to, to be to 
go through it with my first child and start to, I feel it sometimes because I don’t have really bad postpartum, but I did go through 
postpartum, and I’m going through it again now.”
Q7. “He honestly didn’t even know I had postpartum just because I was crying so much by myself in the room. When he did find 
out I had it, he was more so, “Why aren’t you coming to me and confiding in me?” I just had to pull myself out of it because I just 
wanted to deal with that myself.”
Q8. “Actually, because my sister, I have a lot of siblings. My sister, [name], ended up doing it. but they like- they ended up putting 
her in like, what is it called like? Not a psych ward, but like basically where you go and they like it’s like whenever you’re dealing 
with depression basically and that’s what they did to her I just don’t know the name of the hospital or whatever, and they did that 
to her. But that was about 2 years ago. I don’t know if they’ve changed it. But I dealt with CYS my whole life and I’m just afraid of, 
you know that coming again I can’t deal with that. I- I just can’t deal with that. I’m scared. I’m just scared.”
Q9. “But when it would come to me like going to his visits, you know they have the papers that talks about postpartum depres-
sion. I’ll just put I’m okay for all of them because I was scared that they were gonna take my child or something.”
Q10. “Cuz- I don’t know- I didn’t want them to think we- usually, when some moms get depressed they think they’re going to hurt 
your children and stuff like that, so it was just-I’mma be honest, because I’m black I thought that-, if I told them that I’m depressed 
that they will try to take my daughter from me and I didn’t- I just didn’t want that risk.”
Q11. “I don’t like to think about it but I get reminded every day like damn, you know, [I] had the babies and I’m by myself. Just one 
thing you know, feeding them every day by myself is one thing- washing them up because that’s something that I was doing. I’m 
used to doing, I was gonna do that, but it just like- like damn every single day like I’m here by myself. I’m doing this by myself, you 
know, that sucks!”
Q12. “My mom always told me, my grandma always tells me, anybody around me that I have around my son, they would tell me 
like you’re a good mom you’re doing real good for his age like, I was getting that a lot. Especially when my postpartum that’s 
another thing that like uplifted me like just be[ing] told I’m a good mom without having any help, except for my mother.”
Q13. “I had a lot of postpartum depression, only because it was like I’m a young mom, I didn’t know what I was—I knew what I 
was doing because I had past experience of kids living with me. It’s just by myself, like I’m home with the baby—not by myself; I 
had him too, and he was a lot of help—”

Theme 2: fear admitting Postpartum Mental Health 
Sequelae to a Health Care Provider

A third theme was fear around reporting symptoms con-
sistent  with  postpartum  depression  to  a  healthcare  pro-
vider.  Two  participants  specifically  reported  concerns 
around  their  healthcare  team  alerting  child  protective 
services  of  their  depression  and  risking  their  child  or 
children being removed from their care, and one in par-
ticular, noted her race as a reason for increased propen-
sity for reporting. One of our participants [Q8] related an 
anecdote where her sister reported symptoms consistent 
with postpartum depression and was eventually hospital-
ized–with  her  child  placed  in  state  custody.  The  inter-
secting  histories  of  the  participant’s  sister’s  experience 
and  her  own  experience  with  child  protective  services 

in her own childhood created a web of causality for this 
patient  who  saw  disclosing  postpartum  mental  health 
sequelae  as  a  reason  for  the  medical  system  to  report 
to  child  protective  services.  Another  participant  [Q9] 
admitted that she did not answer the questionnaire hon-
estly due to fear of child protective service involvement, 
which likely impacted her ability to receive mental health 
support  and  may  reflect  broader  concerns  about  honest 
disclosure around mental health concerns in the context 
of  postpartum  care.  Race  was  also  specifically  cited  by 
a  participant  [Q10]  as  a  reason  for  increased  child  pro-
tective  service  involvement  when  one  opted  to  disclose 
symptoms consistent with postpartum depression.

Theme 4: Social Support and Affirmation as critical 
elements in coping with Postpartum Mental Health 
Sequelae

The  fourth  theme  was  that  social  support  and  affirma-
tion  appeared  to  have  a  positive  effect  on  coping  with 
postpartum mental health sequelae, while the absence of 
social support and affirmation had a negative effect.

One  participant  spoke  candidly  about  her  exhaustion 
parenting  three  children  as  a  single  mother  despite  her 
own  mental  fortitude  [Q11],  stating  “Damn  every  single 
day…I’m  doing  this  by  myself,  you  know,  that  sucks!” 
This  same  participant also  noted that  our  interview was 
a unique opportunity to disclose her frustrations, telling 
the  interviewer  “you’re  probably  helping  me  right  now. 
[Q2]”.

Another  participant,  also  a  single  mother,  explained 
that  she  received  positive  affirmations  from  her  mother 
and  grandmother,  which  helped  to  improve  her  mood-
postpartum [Q12].

A third participant cited her partner as important sup-
port, assisting her to contend with her depressive symp-
toms  [Q13],  despite  her  reluctance  in  disclosing  her 
mental symptoms to her partner initially [Q7]. Her part-
ner supported her with caretaking responsibilities, which 
potentially dissipated some of the feelings of being over-
whelmed expressed by single parents [Q2, Q11].

Discussion
Our  interviews  reflect  a  small  number  (n = 11)  of  Black 
and  Biracial  adolescent  and  young  adult  mothers  who 
organically  disclosed  symptoms  concerning  for  postpar-
tum depression often not captured by traditional screen-
ing  tools  or  noted  by  a  medical  provider.  Additional 
themes  noted  in  the  interviews  reflect  that  postpartum 
mental health sequelae are often conceived of as personal 
failure;  reporting  postpartum  mental  health  sequelae 
can be associated with a negative outcome of referral to 
child protective services; and social supports–either fam-
ily or partner support–have a positive impact on manag-
ing postpartum mental health sequelae while absence of 
familial  or  partner  support  can  worsen  feelings  consis-
tent with postpartum depression.

While difficult to extrapolate towards broader implica-
tions for screening, diagnosing, and treating postpartum 
depression, the themes captured may give some opportu-
nity to reflect on some of the structural barriers for young 
Black and Biracial mothers to report postpartum mental 
health  sequelae  to  providers  as  well  as  consider  ways  to 
support this vulnerable population at a particularly chal-
lenging juncture of motherhood. From broader data, we 
know  that  racial  disparities  exist  both  in  the  prevalence 
of  PPD  and  the  receipt  of  postpartum  care,  with  Black 
and Hispanic women having higher rates of PPD [8] com-
pared to white women, and less connectivity to care [9]. 

While not a formal purpose of this qualitative study, it is 
also notable that our participants were part of a recruit-
ment effort to characterize experiences of substance use 
disorder  screening  in  obstetric  care—which  may  have 
been a confounding factor.

Other qualitative studies have also shown similar prev-
alence of mental health concerns characterizing the peri-
natal  and  postpartum  experiences  of  Black  women.  In  a 
qualitative study by Barnett et al., self-identified women 
of color were interviewed in focus groups where themes 
were  similarly  identified  via  an  inductive  and  iterative 
approach [22]. The study reported that mental health was 
a common theme among the focus groups, with many of 
the  participants  reporting  postpartum  depression.  They 
also  noted  the  need  for  mental  health  resources  includ-
ing  screening  and  diagnosing  postpartum  depression 
appropriately.

The preponderance of unprompted discussions around 
postpartum  mental  health  sequelae  noted  in  nearly  half 
our  subjects  suggests  that  Black  and  Biracial  adolescent 
and young adult (AYA) mothers are experiencing depres-
sive  symptoms  but  may  be  under-reporting  struggles 
with mental illness to clinicians and on screening forms. 
This  finding  is  consistent  with  qualitative  meta-analysis 
study by Maxwell et al. [23] where the pressure to “keep 
it to myself ” was reflected among the narratives of mar-
ginalised groups more broadly. In this study, the pressure 
to  not  disclose  postpartum  mental  health  sequelae  was 
notably a consequence of non-Western cultural pressures 
or  not  having  sufficient  language  in  non-Western  cul-
tures, more than stigma or self-blame. .

In  our  interviews,  mothersmore  often  attributed  their 
depressive  symptoms  to  personal  weakness  rather  than 
illness, which created stigma around disclosure. Our par-
ticipants were also quick to shift blame away from their 
children as sources of pressure or reasons for their feel-
ings. Social pressure for new mothers to bear the physi-
cal and mental sequelae of childbirth are noted in other 
qualitative  studies  [23]  which  discuss  idealised  mother-
ing,  but  the  nuances  of  how  this  may  manifest  in  Black 
and Biracial adolescent mothers are less explored. In one 
study, Black mothers were asked “what do you do when 
you  feel  down  in  the  dumps?”  and  the  overwhelming 
majority, 63%, employed strategies that typically denied, 
masked, or suppressed their emotions rather than strate-
gies  which  acknowledged  symptoms,  treating  causes,  or 
seeking professional help [24].

Additionally,  the  mythology  around  the  “strong  Black 
woman”  (SBW)  may  be  implicated  in  the  expectation 
that  Black  women  bear  their  mental  illness  alone.  A 
qualitative study by Hall et al. [25] noted that higher lev-
els  of  SBW  schema  endorsement  were  associated  with 
higher  levels  of  psychological  distress  including  depres-
sion,  stress,  anxiety,  and  suicidal  behaviors.  Moreover, 

Dwarakanath et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:636 another qualitative study interviewing eight focus groups 
of  Black  women  noted  that  some  of  the  distress  of  the 
SBW  schema  was  caused  by  restriction  of  help-seeking 
behaviors and attending to others’ needs over one’s own. 
TheSBW  schema  which  may  predispose  young  Black 
women  to  minimize  postpartum  mental  health  sequelae 
may  be  exacerbated  by  the  intersectionality  of  being  a 
young  Black  mother  in  a  culture  which  does  not  often 
favorably  view  Black  mothers  or  young  mothers  and 
can further expectations for young, Black mothers to be 
“superhuman”  to  contradict  known  stereotype  threats. 
This  makes  capturing  information  around  postpartum 
mental  health  sequelae  for  this  population  extremely 
difficult,  though  our  experience  interviewing  our  par-
ticipants  certainly  revealed  this  to  be  a  substantial  and 
unmet  need.  Pittsburgh  Healthy  Start  and  the  Infant 
Health Equity (IHE) Coalition, which includes local com-
munity  perspectives  and  experiences,  have  suggested 
replacing or supplementing paper mental health screen-
ings  with  one-on-one  trusted  maternal  and  child  health 
workers, which aligns with the narratives of several of our 
participants [26].

It is imperative that mental health researchers and pro-
fessionals  develop  targeted  strategies  that  improve  the 
comfort  and  remove  barriers  that  dissuade  young  Black 
and  biracial  mothers  from  disclosing  postpartum  men-
tal health sequelae and to normalize seeking appropriate 
treatment. Strategies that may be helpful considering the 
themes identified in this study would be greater inclusion 
of Black and biracial doulas, who are often seen as non-
judgmental advocates, during pregnancy, as well as con-
tinued screening for postpartum mental health sequelae 
well  beyond  the  six-week  postpartum  checkup.  Addi-
tionally,  as  many  birthing  people  forgo  their  six-week 
checkup,  pediatricians  may  be  critical  advocates  and 
touchpoints for rescreening of postpartum depression in 
mothers further out from the infant’s birth. Additionally, 
it  may  be  important  to  identify  community  support,  as 
many participants  in this study reported  social  isolation 
as  a  result  of  being  a  young  mother.  Centering  groups, 
which offer birthing people a cohort of peers during their 
pregnancy  as  well  as  new  parent  support  groups,  can-
create  a  community  for  young  mothers  navigating  their 
new roles. Other interventions like early intervention and 
nurse visiting  programs have also demonstrated efficacy 
in addressing disparities among adolescent mothers [27].

Strengths and limitations

A  primary  strength  of  this  study  is  that  the  participants 
were already enrolled in the broader YoungMoms’ study 
and  had  developed  a  longitudinal  relationship  with  the 
clinical  team  prior  to  their  childrens’  deliveries.  This 
longitudinal  relationship  between  the  participants  and 
the  study  team  may  have  created  a  level  of  trust  that 

Page 7 of 9

facilitated  the  more  candid  disclosures  of  postpartum 
mental  health  sequelae.  An  additional  benefit  of  our 
study was that many participants were no longer in their 
first  year  postpartum  period  at  the  time  of  the  inter-
view;  this  distance  from  the  timing  of  their  birth  may 
have  increased  comfortability  in  reflecting  and  disclos-
ing  postpartum  mental  health  sequelae  as  something 
they  had  overcome.  There  were  also  some  limitations, 
including the lack of inclusion of questions about perina-
tal mental health and postpartum depression specifically. 
Another limitation was the lack of intersectional analysis 
and  fewer  number  of  Biracial  participants  to  determine 
differences  between  Black  and  Biracial  participants.  the 
dearth  of  research  on  postpartum  depression  in  Black 
and  biracial  AYA,  more  research  is  needed  to  better 
understand how to meaningfully care for this population.

Conclusion
Black  and  biracial  adolescent  and  young  adult  mothers 
may  under-report  depressive  symptoms  in  the  postpar-
tum  period  due  to  structural  and  social  barriers.  Elimi-
nating  these  barriers  and  improving  the  acceptability 
of  reporting  depressive  symptoms  for  minority  young 
women after experiencing pregnancy is vital to improve 
perinatal  and  infant  health  overall.  The  narratives  and 
insight from participants in this study suggest the need to 
better understand social and historical reasons why Black 
and biracial AYA mothers may be unlikely to report post-
partum  depression  to  develop  appropriate  interventions 
to support a healthy pregnancy and postpartum period.
