Abstract
Background  Premenstrual syndrome affects many women in their reproductive years and often disrupts their 
social connections and work. This study aimed to compare the effects of positive psychology and physical activity on 
depression, anxiety, and stress among students with premenstrual syndrome.

Methods  In this four-group parallel clinical trial with blinded data analysis, 120 eligible students who experienced 
premenstrual syndrome were recruited based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomly allocated to four groups 
(n = 30) including three experiment groups as positive psychology, physical activity, and positive psychology, physical 
activity, and control group, using a simple randomization method. All four groups completed premenstrual syndrome 
screening and the DASS-21 questionnaire before the intervention. Then, the positive psychology intervention 
group received eight sessions of 70–90 min weekly intervention, the second group received eight weeks of aerobic 
physical activity intervention, and the third group received positive psychology and physical activity intervention 
for eight weeks. The control group did not receive any interventions. The DASS-21 was completed immediately after 
the intervention and two months later by all four groups. In this study, the participants and investigators were not 
blinded; however, the analysts were. The recruitment process took place from September 2018 to March 2019. One 
hundred twenty participants fulfilled the study. The Data were collected and analyzed using SPSS (v18).

Results  Before and immediately after the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference in depression, 
anxiety, and stress mean scores among the positive psychology, physical activity, positive psychology, and physical 
activity and control groups (p ≥ 0.05). However, two months after the intervention, a significant difference was 
observed between the four groups so there was a difference between the scores of the three intervention groups and 
the control group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between positive psychology, and physical activity 
groups. No significant adverse events or side effects were observed.

Keywords  Premenstrual syndrome, Anxiety, Depression, Stress

Introduction
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is  a  set  of  various physi-
cal, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that may occur 
due to hormonal changes during menstruation [1]. These 
symptoms can negatively affect daily life, including physi-
cal  performance,  mood,  cognitive  abilities,  and  social 
interactions, ultimately threatening overall well-being [2]. 
Research  shows  that  about  53%  of  women  in  Ethiopia, 
80% of women in Saudi Arabia, and 70.8%  of women in 
Iran experience PMS [3, 4].

While  the  exact  cause  of  PMS  is  still  unknown,  it  is 
believed to be linked to sensitivity to hormonal changes 
during menstruation in certain women [5]. The relation-
ship  between  ovarian  cycle  activity  and  PMS  symptoms 
can  be  inferred  from  the  effectiveness  of  ovulation  sup-
pressants  in  reducing  symptoms  during  pregnancy  and 
after  menopause  [6].  Furthermore,  PMS  symptoms  may 
be alleviated using antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs that 
regulate  neurotransmitters  such  as  serotonin  and  affect 
GABA  activity.  Therefore,  it  appears  that  PMS  symp-
toms are strongly influenced by the activity of these neu-
rotransmitters [7].

PMS includes a range of physical symptoms like bloat-
ing,  breast  tenderness,  headaches,  increased  appetite, 
and palpitations, as well as psychological and behavioral 
symptoms such as depression, irritability, fatigue, aggres-
sion,  suicidal  tendencies,  poor  concentration,  mood 
swings, and social isolation. Symptoms like stress, mood 
changes,  loss  of  control,  depression,  irritability,  sleep 
disturbances,  impaired  coordination,  and  alterations  in 
sexual  desire  emphasize  the  importance  of  addressing 
and  treating  PMS  [2].  Consequently,  numerous  studies 
in recent years have focused on exploring the prevalence, 
causes, and management of PMS [7, 8].

While there is still no clear understanding of the exact 
causes of PMS, managing its symptoms involves a com-
bination  of  non-pharmacological  structured  techniques 
[9, 10], antidepressant medications [11], cognitive-behav-
ioral therapies [10], and hormonal treatments [12].

Positive  psychology,  a  burgeoning  field,  aims  to 
enhance people’s well-being and improve their quality of 
life  through  deliberate  actions  or  therapeutic  strategies 
that foster optimistic emotions, behaviors, and thoughts 
and  reinforce  desirable  personality  traits  [13].  Studies 
have shown that positive psychology-based interventions 

reduce depression, anxiety, and stress in healthcare work-
ers [14, 15]. The results of a study showed that online pos-
itiveoriented  counseling  alleviated  PMS  symptoms  [16]. 
In  another  study,  positive  cognitive-behavioral  therapy 
(P-  CBT)  was  associated  with  significantly  higher  rates 
of clinically significant or reliable change for depression, 
negative affect, and happiness [17]. The results of a study 
showed  that  positive  group  counseling  reduced  physical 
symptoms,  anxiety,  and  sensitivity  in  interpersonal  rela-
tionships,  and  aggression  associated  with  PMS,  but  no 
significant reduction was observed in depression [18].

Engaging  in  regular  physical  activity  can  be  beneficial 
in  the  neurological  and  psychological  realms  [19,  20]. 
Exercise  stimulates  the  release  of  endorphins,  reduces 
pain,  and  induces  feelings  of  satisfaction  and  happiness 
[19, 21]. It also helps regulate hormone levels, leading to 
fewer  mood  fluctuations.  Additionally,  physical  exercise 
can lower cortisol levels, decreasing stress and associated 
psychological symptoms [22–24].

In  a  study  conducted  on  university  students,  aerobic 
gymnastic physical activities were found to have a greater 
reduction  effect  on  specific  psychological  symptoms 
related  to  PMS  compared  to  a  control  group  [25].  Simi-
larly,  in  a  clinical  trial  involving  35  women  with  PMS,  a 
walking  program  for  two  months  during  two  menstrual 
cycles resulted in improvements in various mood-related 
symptoms  such  as  irritability,  restlessness,  weakness, 
fatigue,  crying,  depression,  and  desire  to  stay  at  home, 
and anxiety symptoms [26].

The  hypothesis  of  the  current  study  posits  that  non-
pharmacological  interventions  could  offer  viable  treat-
ment  options  for  women  who  either  cannot  tolerate  or 
are  non-compliant  with  antidepressant  or  hormonal 
medications,  or  for  those  who  seek  alternative  or  sup-
plementary  treatments  to  enhance  the  management  of 
premenstrual  syndrome.  Additionally,  there  is  a  lack  of 
clarity  regarding  the  comparative  effectiveness  of  these 
interventions  for  women  suffering  from  PMS.  Conse-
quently, this study aims to evaluate and compare the effi-
cacy of aerobic physical activity and positive psychology 
interventions in mitigating depression, anxiety, and stress 
in women with PMS.

Methods
Design

This  four-group  parallel  clinical  trial  was  conducted 
after  obtaining  ethical  approval  from  the  Ethics  Com-
mittee  of  Kermanshah  University  of  Medical  Sciences, 
under the code KUMS.REC.1397.136. The trial was pro-
spectively  registered  on  11  August  2018  with  the  Ira-
nian Registry of Clinical Trials under the registration ID 
IRCT20130812014333N97, titled “A comparative study of 
the effect of the educational intervention based on posi-
tive psychology and exercise on depression, anxiety, and 
stress in students with premenstrual syndrome.”

The  study  was  designed,  conducted,  and  reported  in 
accordance  with  the  Consolidated  Standards  of  Report-
ing  Trials  (CONSORT)  2010  guidelines.  All  procedures 
adhered  strictly  to  these  standards  to  ensure  trans-
parency,  reproducibility,  and  integrity  of  the  research 
findings.

Participants

Out  of  the  180  screened  students,  120  were  recruited, 
and  60  were  excluded  due  to  a  lack  of  inclusion  criteria 
or  a  lack  of  desire  to  participate  in  the  study.  The  par-
ticipants  were  students  at  the  Faculty  of  Literature  and 
Human Sciences of Razi University of Kermanshah prov-
ince - west of Iran.

The  Premenstrual  Symptoms  Screening  Tool  (PSST), 
validated  by  Hariri  et  al.  (2017),  in  Iran,  and  Gynecolo-
gist approval (third author) were the criteria that allowed 
the  identification  of  students  who  could  potentially  be 
enrolled in the study. The recruitment process took place 
from September 2018 to March 2019.

Inclusion criteria were age 20 to 24, regularity of men-
struation,  length  of  menstrual  cycle  between  22  and  35 
days,  number  of  bleeding  days  between  3  and  8  days, 
body mass index less than 30, obtaining a mild and mod-
erate  score  (8–14)  on  the  DASS21  questionnaire,  and 
scoring  18  or  higher  on  the  premenstrual  syndrome 
symptoms questionnaire.

The  exclusion  criteria  were  diagnosis  of  Premenstrual 
dysphoric  disorder  (PMDD)  by  the  Gynecologist  (third 
author), history of traumatic events or loss of loved ones 
and divorce in the last three months, failure to participate 
in  two  positive  intervention  sessions  and  three  physical 
activity sessions, severe and very severe cases of depres-
sion  -  subscales  (21  and  above),  anxiety  (15  and  above), 
and tension (26 and above) and unwillingness to continue 
participating in the study.

Randomization

A  total  of  120  eligible  students  with  premenstrual  syn-
drome,  who  achieved  a  mild  to  moderate  score  (rang-
ing from 8 to 14) on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress 
Scale  (DASS-21)  questionnaire,  were  selected  through 
random  sampling.  These  participants  were  then  ran-
domly assigned to one of four groups: three experimental 
groups (physical activity, positive psychology, and a com-
bination of physical activity and positive psychology) and 
one control group, each consisting of 30 participants (see 
Fig. 1).

To accomplish this, 120 identical cards were prepared, 
with  30  cards  marked  with  the  code  1  representing  the 
“positive  psychology  intervention,”  30  cards  with  code 
2  representing  the  “physical  activity  intervention,”  30 
cards  with  code  3  representing  the  “combined  inter-
vention,”  and  30  cards  with  code  4  representing  the  “no 
intervention”  (control  group).  Each  qualified  participant 
then  randomly  selected  one  of  these  cards  to  determine 
their group allocation. Importantly, the participants were 
blinded to the allocation design to maintain the integrity 
of  the  randomization  process.  The  recruitment  process 
was conducted from September 2018 to March 2019.

Research procedures

The  first  author  invited  eligible  female  students  to  par-
ticipate  and  explained  the  project.  A  person  who  had 
no  role  in  the  study  generated  the  random  allocation 
sequence  and  assigned  participants  to  interventions.  To 
prevent biases in the filling of records by the investigators 
a person who had no role in the study, and was unaware 
of the participant’s group allocation, received training to 
collect data.

Interventions
The positive psychology intervention

The  positive  psychology  intervention  group  received 
eight  weekly  70–90  min  educational  intervention  ses-
sions by the first author, under the guidance of the fourth 
author.  The  multiple  groups  activated  for  a  total  of  30 
subjects  (each  group  including  ten  students). The  group 
was led by a Ph.D. in Psychiatric Nursing (fourth author). 
The content of the sessions is shown in Table 1.

Physical activity

Sample size calculation

The sample size was calculated using a similar study [27] 
considering  the  first  type  error  (α)  of  0.05,  95%  confi-
dence level, a test power of 80% (β = 0.2)), and a dropout 
rate of 120 participants.

In  the  physical  activity  experimental  group,  a  regular 
physical  activity  program  consisting  of  20–30  min  ses-
sions,  conducted  three  days  a  week  over  eight  weeks, 
was  implemented  in  coordination  with  the  Dean  of  the 
Department  of  Physical  Education  at  Razi  University.

Fig. 1  Flowchart of the study

This  program  took  place  in  the  university’s  sports  facil-
ity and included five minutes of warm-up exercises at the 
beginning,  15 –10  min  of  light  jogging  with  rest  inter-
vals,  and  concluded  with  five  minutes  of  cooling  down 
stretches  and  relaxation  exercises.  The  exercise  pro-
gram was supervised and guided by the first author and 
a  sports  coach.  The  training  protocol  was  based  on  the 
guidance of the Integrative Body Mind Information Sys-
tem (IBIS), which was developed in 2002 [28].

The third experimental group received both the sports 
activity  intervention  and  the  educational  intervention 
based on positive psychology for eight weeks, the fourth 
group was the control group with no intervention.

Measures

A demographic form was completed by the participants 
at baseline including age, age of first menstruation, body 
mass index, and days of bleeding in menstruation.

The  Premenstrual  Symptoms  Screening  Tool  (PSST), 
validated  by  Hariri  et  al.  (2017),  in  Iran,  was  utilized 
to  diagnose  PMS.  PSST  Consists  of  19  symptoms  that 
are  evaluated  using  a  Likert  scale,  the  responses  vary 
depending on the severity of each symptom, including 0 
(absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 4 (severe). Obtaining 
a score of 18 and above on this questionnaire was consid-
ered positive premenstrual syndrome. This question has 
been psychometrically evaluated in Iran, and Cronbach’s 
alpha has been reported as 0.93 [29].

Depression,  stress,  and  anxiety  levels  were  measured 
using the questionnaire (DASS-21). The DASS21, an eval-
uation  tool  for  assessing  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress, 
was  created  in  1995  and  comprises  21  items  [30].  Items 
3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, and 21 measure depression; items 2, 
4, 7, 9, 15, 19, and 20 measure anxiety; and items 1, 6, 8, 
11, 12, 14, and 18 measure stress. This question has been 
psychometrically evaluated in Iran, and Cronbach’s alpha

has been reported as 0.79 for anxiety, 0.91 for stress, and 
0.93 for depression, respectively [31].

The  questionnaire  (DASS-21)  was  completed  before 
the intervention, immediately after (at the end of the last 
intervention session), and two months later (two months 
after the last intervention session), by all four groups. In 
this  study,  the  participants  and  investigators  were  not 
blinded; however, the analysts were.

Outcome measures
Primary outcome

Depression, stress, and anxiety levels before, immediately 
after, and two months after the completion of the inter-
vention, the questionnaire (DASS-21) was completed by 
the participants of the four groups.

Ethical considerations

The first and second authors visited Razi University after 
securing the Ethics Committee and IRCT’s approvals. At 
first,  the  participants  were  briefed  about  the  study  and 
signed  a  written  informed  letter  of  consent.  This  study 

with  clinical  trial  code:  IRCT20130812014333N97  was 
based  on  an  MSc  Dissertation  in  counseling  and  mid-
wifery under the ethics code: KUMS.REC.1397.136, Ker-
manshah  University  of  Medical  Sciences  approved  on 
12  June  2018  by  the  Research  Ethics  Committee.  Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all participants 
after the briefing.

Data analysis

The collected data was analyzed in SPSS version 18 using 
descriptive  and  analytical  statistical  indicators.  Kol-
mogorov  Smirnov  (k-s)  test  was  used  to  check  the  nor-
mality of quantitative variables. If the variables followed 
a  normal  distribution,  the  one-way  ANOVA  and  Toki 
test  were  used,  otherwise,  the  Kruskal-Wallis  test  was 
employed.  The  Wilcoxon  test  was  used  to  discriminate 
differences  in  cases  where  the  Kruskal-Wallis  test  had 
p-values less than 0.05.

For  qualitative  variables,  the  chi-square  test  was 
employed  for  homogeneity,  and  in  case  of  an  insuffi-
cient number of samples, Fisher’s test was used (P < 0.05).

tions  did  not  follow  the  normal  distribution  (P < 0.05). 
Therefore, non-parametric tests were used in this study.

Results
The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that before 
the  intervention,  there  was  no  significant  difference 
between  the  four  investigated  groups  in  terms  of  mean 
age,  the  average  age  of  first  menstruation,  and  average 
number  of  days  of  menstrual  bleeding  (p > 0/05).  More-
over,  the  results  of  the  one-way  analysis  of  variance  did 
not show a statistically significant difference in terms of 
the  mean  body  mass  index  and  the  mean  scores  of  the 
PSST questionnaire in the four studied groups (p > 0.05) 
(Table 2).

According  to  the  results  of  the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test,  the scores  of depression, anxiety,  and  stress before, 

The study results indicated that the stress mean scores 
of  the  first,  second,  and  third  experimental  groups,  and 
the  control  group  were  20.53,  15.3,  17.93,  and  13.6, 
respectively,  before  the  intervention. These  mean  scores 
immediately  decreased  after  the  intervention  to  14.7, 
12.26,  13.54,  and  14.23.  Two  months  after  the  interven-
tion, the mean scores of the groups were 12, 11.23, 12.93., 
and 14.33(Table 3).

The study results indicated that the anxiety mean scores 
of  the  first,  second,  and  third  experimental  groups,  and 
the  control  group  were  22,  20,  20.46,  and  19.7,  respec-
tively, before the intervention. These mean scores imme-
diately  decreased  after  the  intervention  to  17.93,  16.86, 
17.06, and 19.16. Two months after the intervention, the 

Shavaisi et al. BMC Women's Health          (2024) 24:499 mean  scores  of  the  groups  were  15.6,  15.7,  15.86.,  and 
19.13 (Table 3).

The  study  results  indicated  that  the  depression  mean 
scores of the first, second, and third experimental groups, 
and  the  control  group  were  15.87,  13.43,  13.93,  and  12, 
respectively,  before  the  intervention. These  mean  scores 
immediately decreased after the intervention to 11.4, 10, 
10.4,  and  11.7.  Two  months  after  the  intervention,  the 
mean scores of the groups were 9.13, 9.06, 9.73, and 11.86 
(Table 3).

The  Kruskal-Wallis  test  was  used  to  check  any  sig-
nificant  difference  between  the  depression,  anxiety,  and 
stress  scores  of  the  four  groups  before  and  immediately 
after the intervention. The results of the test do not show 
a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  four 
groups  (P > 0.05).  However,  two  months  after  the  inter-
vention,  the  results  of  the  Kruskal-Wallis  test  showed  a 
statistically significant difference between the four stud-
ied  groups  in  terms  of  depression  (P < 0.001),  anxiety 
(P < 0.001), and stress (P < 0.001).

The  post  hoc  Mann-Whitney  test  showed  that  the 
mean  anxiety  score  two  months  after  the  intervention 
was  significantly  different  between  the  positive  psychol-
ogy group and the control group (p < 0.001), between the 
physical activity group and the control group (p < 0.001), 
and  between  the  simultaneous  intervention  group  and 
the control group (p = 0.02).

According  to  the  Mann-Whitney  post  hoc  test,  the 
mean depression score two months after the intervention 
between  the  positive  psychology  group  and  the  control 
group (p = 0.006), between the physical activity interven-
tion  group  and  simultaneous  intervention  (p = 0.007), 
and  between  the  physical  activity  and  control  group 
(p < 0.001) had a significant difference.

In  addition,  the  Mann-Whitney  post  hoc  test  showed 
the  average  stress  score  two  months  after  the  interven-
tions  between  the  positive  psychology  group  and  the 
control  group  (p < 0.001),  between  the  physical  activity 
intervention group and the control group (p < 0.001), and 
between  the  simultaneous  intervention  group  and  the 
control group (p = 0.007) had a significant difference. Two 
months after the intervention, no statistically significant 
difference  was  observed  in  terms  of  anxiety,  depression, 
and  stress  scores  between  the  two  groups  of  physical 
activity  intervention  and  positive  psychology  (p > 0.05) 
(Table 3). Based on the results of the repeated measures 
test,  the  trend  of  changes  in  the  mean  scores  of  stress, 
depression,  and  anxiety  was  significant  in  the  three 
interventional  groups  (p < 0.05)  (Table  3).  No  significant 
adverse events or side effects were observed.

Discussion
The  results  of  the  present  study  indicated  that  all  three 
interventions—aerobic physical activity, positive psychol-
ogy,  and  the  combined  intervention  of  positive  psychol-
ogy  and  physical  activity—were  effective  in  alleviating 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among uni-
versity  students  with  premenstrual  syndrome.  And  the 
mean of depression, anxiety, and stress scores in the three 
interventions groups was significantly lower than that of 
the  control  group.  Furthermore,  the  effects  of  physical 
activity intervention and positive psychology on alleviat-
ing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were the 
same.

A  review  of  the  literature  revealed  an  absence  of 
studies  that  examined  the  same  interventions  as  those 
investigated  in  the  current  research. Therefore,  this  sec-
tion  compares  the  results  of  the  present  study  with  the 
findings  from  related  studies  that  have  explored  similar 
but  not  identical  interventions.  The  findings  of  a  study 
indicated  that  positive-oriented  online  counseling  sig-
nificantly  alleviated  premenstrual  syndrome  symp-
toms  among  participants  [16].  A  different  study  found 
that  positive  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (P-CBT)  led 
to  notably  higher  rates  of  clinically  significant  or  reli-
able changes in depression, negative affect, and levels of 
happiness  [17].  Another  study  demonstrated  that  posi-
tive  group  counseling  was  effective  in  reducing  physical 
symptoms, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, and aggres-
sion associated with PMS, though it did not significantly 
alleviate  depression  [18].  The  effectiveness  of  positive 
psychology in treating depression, anxiety, and stress was 
further supported by other studies [15, 32], which found 
that the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions comes 
from  two  significant  factors.  The  first  factor  involves 
defining  interventions  that  promote  pleasure,  engage-
ment,  and  meaning,  which  are  carefully  selected  justifi-
able approaches. Another critical aspect is that fostering 
positive  emotions,  engagement,  and  meaning  has  the 
potential to reduce the impact of illnesses [33].

The  findings  of  such  research  are  consistent  with 
the  fundamental  beliefs  of  positive  psychology,  which 
emphasizes  the  importance  of  cultivating  positive  emo-
tions and engagement as essential elements for achieving 
a  satisfying  life.  Positive  psychology  also  highlights  the 
significance of identifying these factors [34].

Strengthening  and  developing 

individuals’  diverse 
strengths  can  significantly  decrease  or  eliminate  emo-
tional and mental issues [32]. Positive psychology asserts 
that  spotting  and  defining  individuals’  strengths  and 
learning  how  to  apply  them  effectively  can  significantly 
reduce the intensity of depressive symptoms. In general, 
the stronger the sense of positivism, the lower the risk of 
depression or anxiety [13].

practice over time maintain its lasting effect in the mind 
and  increase  adaptation  and  self-regulation,  improve 
relationships  with  others,  forgiveness,  and  physiologi-
cally increase mood-regulating neurotransmitters such as 
serotonin and endorphins in the body and thus improv-
ing mood [33, 42, 43].

Limitations and advantages

The strengths of the current study include a two-month 
follow-up period post-trial completion to ensure the con-
tinued  effectiveness  of  the  interventions.  Additionally, 
providing  session  content  as  an  educational  package  for 
future investigators enhances the study’s clinical applica-
tion.  Furthermore,  this  research  used  standardized  and 
normalized tools for the Iranian population.

The  effectiveness  of  different  short-term  interventions 
suggests viable treatment options for women who prefer 
alternatives to anti-depressant or hormonal drugs due to 
concerns about side effects or compliance issues, or who 
seek complementary treatments for enhanced efficacy in 
managing PMS.

However,  due  to  some  limitations,  the  results  should 
be  generalized  with  caution.  Firstly,  the  sample  size  was 
small;  therefore,  further  research  with  a  larger  sample 
group  is  recommended.  Secondly,  due  to  time  con-
straints,  we  were  unable  to  conduct  any  further  follow-
up actions. The authors suggest that future studies should 
explore the long-term impact of such interventions with 
extended  follow-up  periods.  Another  limitation  of  this 
study was the inability to blind participants and the inves-
tigators due to the nature of the interventions, resulting 
in  participants  being  aware  of  their  assigned  treatment, 
which could potentially affect outcomes.

Conclusion
Among  the  three  non-antidepressant/non-hormonal 
drug  interventions—  aerobic  physical  activity,  positive 
psychology,  and  the  combined  intervention  of  positive 
psychology and physical activity—all were found to alle-
viate  anxiety,  depression,  and  stress.  And  the  effects  of 
physical activity and positive psychology-based interven-
tions on alleviating anxiety, depression, and stress symp-
toms  in  students  with  premenstrual  syndrome  were  the 
same. Health care providers, policymakers, and managers 
are  encouraged  to  incorporate  and  endorse  such  inter-
ventions  in  the  treatment  programs  and  clinical  guide-
lines for women with PMS.

In  addition,  it  appears  that  positive  psychology  can 
empower  individuals  by  facilitating  positive  cognitive 
shifts  from  negative  to  positive  thoughts  and  enhancing 
coping  skills.  Consequently,  one  reason  for  the  positive 
impact  of  positive  psychology  may  be  its  direct  influ-
ence  on  interpersonal  relationships,  empowerment  of 
individuals  to  utilize  their  capabilities,  reinforcement  of 
self-confidence  and  positive  thinking,  and  reduction  of 
destructive  and  negative  thoughts,  thereby  improving 
mood [35, 36].
Top of Form.
Consistent  with  the  present  study,  the  results  of  stud-
ies  showed  that  the  aerobic  exercise  reduced  the  PMS 
symptoms,  and  the  impact  continued  for  two  months 
after the study [4, 9, 17, 20–22, 35]. Vaghela et al. (2019) 
found that aerobic physical activity reduced the intensity 
of  pain  and  PMS  symptoms  [36],  and  Vishnupriya  and 
Rajarajeswaram (2011) observed that moderate-intensity 
aerobic  physical  activity  was  effective  in  managing  PMS 
[37].

Aerobic physical activity leads to a significant increase 
in serum progesterone levels, which may have beneficial 
effects  in  terms  of  improving  mood  and  reducing  stress 
[38]. Neurotransmitters such as GABA and serotonin are 
affected by the presence of sex steroids, and the secretion 
of  high  levels  of  endorphins  during  physical  activity  is 
associated with a reduction in pain, anxiety, and depres-
sion  in  women  with  premenstrual  syndrome,  which 
contradicts the decrease in endorphins during the luteal 
phase [35].

Another  potential  mechanism  for  the  effectiveness  of 
aerobic  physical  activity  was  proposed  by  Salem  (2021) 
who  suggested  that  the  regulatory  process  of  the  men-
strual cycle depends on the control of leptin [39]. Leptin 
plays  a  critical  role  in  managing  emotional  behaviors, 
and it increases in women with PMS compared to those 
without [40]. Psychological symptoms of PMS are associ-
ated  with  increased  circulating  leptin  levels,  and  several 
studies  have  shown  that  physical  activity  can  lead  to  a 
decrease in blood leptin levels, which can reduce behav-
ioral symptoms [41].

A  possible  general  reason  for  the  effectiveness  of  the 
interventions in the current study could be attributed to 
the participants’ lack of prior awareness about PMS and 
their limited exposure to treatment options before enter-
ing the study. It appears that all three interventions were 
effective in educating the participants about their condi-
tion [42–44].

Another  reason  may  relate  to  feasibility  of  skills  and 
assignments  that  could  be  continued  individually  by 
women  after  completion  of  the  interventions.  It  seems 
that  women  had  enough  time  to  repeat  learned  skills 
individually and obtained more talent. It also seems that 
positive  thinking  and  positive  self-talking  with  regular
