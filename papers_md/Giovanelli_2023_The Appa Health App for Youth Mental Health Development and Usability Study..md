Abstract

Background:  Demand  for  adolescent  mental  health  services  has  surged  in  the  aftermath  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and
traditional models of care entailing in-person services with licensed mental health providers are inadequate to meet demand.
However, research has shown that with proper training and supervision mentors can work with youth with mental health challenges
like depression and anxiety and can even support the use of evidence-based strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
In our increasingly connected world, youth mentors can meet with young people on a web-based platform at their convenience,
reducing barriers to care. Moreover, the internet has made evidence-based CBT skills for addressing depression and anxiety more
accessible than ever. As such, when trained and supervised by licensed clinicians, mentors are an untapped resource to support
youth with mental health challenges.

Objective:  The objective of this study was to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of Appa Health (Appa), an
evidence-based mental health mentoring program for youth experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. This paper describes
the development, pilot testing process, and preliminary quantitative and qualitative outcomes of Appa’s 12-week smartphone app
program which combines web-based near-peer mentorship with short-form TikTok-style videos teaching CBT skills created by
licensed mental health professionals who are also social media influencers.

Methods:  The development and testing processes were executed through collaboration with key stakeholders, including young
people and clinical and research advisory boards. In the pilot study, young people were assessed for symptoms of depression or
anxiety using standard self-report clinical measures: the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
scales. Teenagers endorsing symptoms of depression or anxiety (n=14) were paired with a mentor (n=10) based on preferred
characteristics  such  as  gender,  race  or  ethnicity,  and  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  transgender,  queer  (LGBTQ)  status.  Quantitative
survey data about the teenagers’ characteristics, mental health, and feasibility and acceptability were combined with qualitative
data assessing youth perspectives on the program, their mentors, and the CBT content.

Results:  Participants reported finding Appa helpful, with 100% (n=14) of teenagers expressing that they felt better after the
12-week program. Over 85% (n=12) said they would strongly recommend the program to a friend. The teenagers were engaged,
video chatting with mentors consistently over the 12 weeks. Metrics of anxiety and depressive symptoms reduced consistently

from week 1 to week 12, supporting qualitative data suggesting that mentoring combined with CBT strategies has the potential
to positively impact youth mental health and warrants further study.

Conclusions:  Appa  Health  is  a  novel  smartphone  app  aiming  to  improve  the  well-being  of  youth  and  reduce  anxiety  and
depressive symptoms through web-based mentoring and engaging CBT video content. This formative research sets the stage for
a large-scale randomized controlled trial recently funded by the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research
program.

Introduction

Background
It is well established that most youth who need mental health
care  do  not  receive  evidence-based  services  [1,2].  The
COVID-19 pandemic contributed to further spikes in demand
for  such  care  [3,4]  while  simultaneously  widening  existing
disparities for youth from historically underserved racial and
ethnic populations, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
queer (LGBTQ), rural, and low-income youth [5,6]. In 2021,
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Adolescent
Behavior and Experiences Survey found that one-third of high
school-aged youth in the United States reported experiencing
poor mental health (defined as stress, anxiety, and depression)
in  the  past  year,  and  44%  reported  experiencing  persistent
periods  of  sadness  or  hopelessness  [4]  with  higher  rates  for
LGBTQ youth. However, youth who felt connected to others,
whether in person or on the web, evinced significantly better
mental health outcomes [4].

Lack of accessibility to evidence-based care continues to be a
barrier for youth seeking mental health treatment, and as such,
innovative solutions are needed to meet the mental health needs
of  teenagers  [7,8].  Youth  mentoring,  which  involves  a
nonparental  adult  or  older  peer  building  and  maintaining  a
supportive relationship with a young person in a nonprofessional
capacity  [9],  is  one  such  potential  solution  leveraging
connectedness as a protective factor. Mentors provide guidance,
support, and encouragement to cultivate healthy development
and outcomes. Unlike formal mental health treatment, mentoring
is  provided  by  an  individual  without  advanced  professional
training  (eg,  a  licensed  therapist).  There  are  typically  fewer
constraints on mentor-mentee interactions in terms of frequency,
location, modality, and types of discussions between the mentor
and mentee. These differences may be conducive to developing
deeper personal relationships than are typical of formal mental
health care and can provide a greater range of opportunities and
resources for youth, particularly for those with less access to
traditional care and for those who are not able to find culturally
relevant care [7]. Moreover, the pool of potential youth mentors
is  large  and  relatively  easily  trained,  which  has  significant
implications for scalability and accessibility [10,11]. Crucially,
mentors and other paraprofessionals have been found to be able
to effectively support people with mental health challenges in
the setting of appropriate supervision and support [11,12], with
precedent  for  successful  mentoring  programs  specifically
targeting youth with mental health challenges [13-16]. Mentors

can also serve as a bridge to connecting youth who show more
serious  mental  health  symptoms  to  professional  care  when
indicated [7]. As such, youth mentoring presents a promising
opportunity  to  reach  many  teenagers  in  need  of  a  supportive
presence.

Web-based  mentoring,  or  e-mentoring,  can  further  reduce
barriers  by  meeting  teenagers  where  they  are.  This  modality
has grown in popularity in recent years due to the proliferation
of  digital  mobile  devices,  web-based  accessibility,  and  the
ubiquitous use of digital communication technology, particularly
among  young  people  [7,17,18].  As  such,  evidence-based
e-mentoring presents an opportunity to support a greater number
of young people experiencing mental health challenges.

Appa Health: Development and Theoretical
Underpinnings
Appa  Health  [19] 
theory-driven
adolescent-facing  mental  health  mobile  app  and  mentoring
program  that  aims  to  support  and  improve  mental  health  for
adolescents displaying clinical levels of depression or anxiety
symptoms in innovative and engaging ways.

is  an  evidence-based, 

Appa  Health  (henceforth  referred  to  as  “Appa”),  founded  in
2021, was developed through an iterative process entailing close
collaboration with youth and clinical advisory boards. Licensed
mental  health  providers  who  are  also  social  media  content
creators were contracted to develop short-form video content
for its initial prototype, testing the content with the advisory
boards. Youth advisors provided feedback on relatability and
engagement,  while  clinical  advisors  provided  feedback  on
accuracy and use.

This video content was then released on Appa’s platform in the
form of asynchronous digital tools teaching cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) skills. Asynchronous digital mental health tools
have been found to have small but clinically meaningful impacts
on youth mental health [20], but evidence suggests that adding
human  support  to  such  tools  in  the  form  of  guidance,
encouragement, and reminders to engage can increase impacts
on  mental  health  outcomes  [21-23]  through  both  increased
self-efficacy and enhanced engagement [24-26], in some cases,
doubling  the  impacts  [21-23].  Attention  to  engagement  in
particular is crucial for adolescents; while attrition rates are high
for asynchronous digital interventions across age groups [26,27],
consistent intervention engagement is particularly challenging
in the adolescent period [28]. Through the use of mobile tools
like  Appa,  young  people  have  an  opportunity  to  create

meaningful  relationships  with  relatable  mentors  while  also
receiving support to learn and generalize CBT skills in the real
world, which may ultimately lead to improved mental health
and quality of life.

The  use  of  CBT  tools  as  part  of  Appa’s  programming  is
informed by extensive literature establishing CBT as a validated
approach  for  addressing  adolescent  mental  health  symptoms
[22,23], with decades of research illustrating effectiveness for
treating a variety of youth concerns, including depression and
anxiety, as well as general challenges with emotion regulation
that contribute to many disorders [29-32]. Increased knowledge
of CBT skills is a necessary foundational component [33] in
increasing the use of skills, which can ultimately contribute to
symptom reduction [34-36].

The theoretical basis for Appa’s combination of relatable mentor
support  with  CBT  skills  is  found  in  social  cognitive  theory
(SCT) [37]. In SCT, a person’s beliefs about their self-efficacy,
or their capabilities to plan and accomplish a given course of
action,  are  crucial  in  determining  behaviors  like  skills  use.
Self-efficacy  can  be  strengthened  in  several  ways,  including
through mastery experiences (eg, handling challenging situations
by  using  a  CBT  skill)  and  vicarious  experiences  (eg,  seeing
behaviors modeled by others, particularly people who the learner
admires or sees as similar to themselves in some way ). This
latter aspect of SCT, known as “identification with the model”
[38], is leveraged in Appa through both teaching of skills by
the TikTok influencers and more explicitly through modeling
examples of skills used by their near-peer mentor with shared
characteristics  or  lived  experience.  In  this  study,  we  aim  to
examine the feasibility and acceptability of the Appa mobile
e-mentoring app with an initial youth cohort.

Methods

Appa Health Structure and Curriculum
Appa Health is a 12-week web-based mentoring program that
combines (1) short-form digital CBT content via 30-, 60-, and
90-second educational videos from mental health experts and
(2) rigorously trained and closely supervised near-peer mentors
with 
lived  experiences  who  use  supportive
accountability to facilitate adolescents’ learning and use of CBT
skills.

relatable 

Educational Videos
The short-form educational videos introduce and demonstrate
CBT skills and concepts. Videos were filmed in collaboration
with mental health content creators recruited from TikTok and
Instagram.  All  creators  were 
licensed  psychologists,
psychiatrists, or marriage and family therapists. Creators were
chosen by one of two criteria: (1) either had significant existing
followership on social media channels (more than 200,000 total
followers)  or  (2)  had  experience  distributing  original  mental
health content through podcasts. Users were given access to 2-4
new videos each week structured around a specific CBT topic
(eg, negative self-talk, cognitive distortions, and active coping
strategies like progressive muscle relaxation) as well as topics
like acceptance and distress tolerance.

Near-Peer e-Mentoring Component
Appa’s mentoring program was designed based on best practices
from  the  existing  youth  mentoring  research  literature  [7,10]
with the added component of mentor compensation (US $20
per hour) due to the 10-hour weekly time commitment. Appa
designed  a  hiring  process  and  training  program  to  ensure
high-quality mentors are selected, onboarded, and continually
monitored  and  supported.  Training  consisted  of  onboarding,
weekly ongoing training through consultation and supervision
by  a  licensed  clinician,  and  quality  assurance  to  ensure  care
quality and further promote mentor growth.

Participants
Adolescent  participants  ages  12-18  years  were  recruited
primarily through Appa Health promotional videos posted on
social media by the mental health content creators contracted
to create videos for the curriculum. Additional recruitment was
facilitated via referrals from counseling departments at private
high schools. Participants aged 18 years or younger (n=10) were
required to have their parents begin the enrollment process in
addition  to  parental  consent  to  participate  in  this  study.
Participants aged 18 years or older (n=4) were able to self-enroll
in the program and the study.

Exclusionary criteria included history of a psychotic disorder,
history of suicidal ideation or attempt, history of self-injurious
behavior, or current diagnosis of a substance use disorder. In
the onboarding survey, parents were asked (1) “Has a doctor or
therapist  ever  diagnosed  your  teen  with  a  psychotic  disorder
like schizophrenia?” and (2) “Does your teen currently have a
diagnosis of a substance use disorder?” Additionally, parents
were required to affirm that their teenager did not have a history
of suicidal ideation or attempt and presented no or low risk for
self-injurious behavior. Participants who were aged 18 years or
older were asked to affirm the same about themselves.

After participants were recruited and proceeded with enrollment,
they were given the option to indicate preferences for mentor
demographic characteristics, including gender, LGBTQ status,
and  racial  or  ethnic  identity.  Participants  were  then  able  to
choose  from  a  preselected  list  of  available  mentors  that  best
matched  their  demographic  preferences.  After  choosing  a
mentor,  participants  were  given  access  to  the  Appa  Health
platform for a period of 12 weeks, where they could schedule
weekly video sessions with their mentor, chat with their mentor
via text, and watch the short-form weekly videos. Pilot study
participants received the Appa Health program at no cost.

Mentor Recruitment
In total, 10 mentors participated in the pilot study. Mentor ages
ranged in age from early 20s to early 30s. All had undergraduate
degrees, typically in psychology, social work, or a related field,
and  experience  working  with  teenagers  in  contexts  like
residential  treatment  centers,  summer  camps,  and  other
mentoring  programs.  The  majority  were  female  (n=7,  70%),
and half identified as Hispanic or Latinx or people of color (n=5,
50%).  Nearly  one-third  (n=3,  30%)  of  mentors  identified  as
members of the LGBTQ community.

Mentor Roles
Mentors  were  selected  in  part  because  they  had  relatable
experiences  in  overcoming  mental  health  challenges  during
their  youth  and  young  adult  years.  Mentors  were  trained  in
supportive accountability in the form of regular check-ins and
problem-solving in support of participants’ learning and use of
CBT strategies.

the 

teenagers 

Mentors met with their youth mentees for 30 minutes weekly
via Appa’s telehealth platform over the course of 12 weeks. In
these  meetings, 
in
they  would  support 
understanding  and  applying  the  video-based  CBT  materials
released in the app over the prior week. They were also available
via SMS text message within the app with the expectation that
they would respond to mentee SMS text messages within 24
hours.  Regular  contact  between  parents  and  their  teenager’s
mentor  is  not  a  standard  component  of  the  Appa  model,
providing adolescents with an increased sense of autonomy and
confidentiality  in  the  context  of  rigorous  safety  protocols
developed and overseen by licensed clinicians.

Procedures
Adolescent  participants  completed  surveys  at  baseline  (week
1), midpoint (week 6), and end point (week 12) over the course
of the program. Surveys took from 5 to 15 minutes to complete,
depending on the timepoint. Surveys were also completed by
caregivers and mentors at baseline and end point, but this study
reports on adolescent survey results only. Informed assent and
parental consent were obtained for all participants aged 18 years
or younger (n=10), and informed consent was obtained for all
participants who were 18 years of age (n=4).

Participants  received  US  $25  in  total  for  completing  all  3
surveys  and  an  additional  US  $25  for  completing  the  short
semistructured interviews at the end of the program. This study
received human subject research approvals for secondary data
analysis of the pilot data from the institutional review board of
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Measures

Demographics
Demographic information on the age, race, or ethnicity of the
teenagers, their gender identity, and their history of receipt of
mental health services was collected from both teenagers and
parents.

Depression and Anxiety Symptoms

Patient Health Questionnaire-8

The  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-8  (PHQ-8)  is  an  8-item
self-report measure based on the PHQ-9, which was developed
to assess the severity of depressive symptoms [39,40]. A cutoff
of  ≥10  is  used  to  indicate  clinically  significant  depression.
PHQ-9 items are based on the 9 symptom criteria used in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition.  The  PHQ-8,  used  in  this  study,  excludes  the  ninth
question asking about suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt. The
PHQ-8  is  commonly  used  in  clinical  research  and  has  been
found to have similar sensitivity and specificity to the PHQ-9
at the clinical cutoff of ≥10 with good reliability and validity

[41,42]. Response options for each of the 8 items range from
“not  at  all”  (0)  to  “nearly  every  day”  (3)  for  a  total  possible
score of 24.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7

The  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7)  is  a  7-item
self-report  measure  based  on  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Edition  symptom  criteria
assessing for the presence of GAD [43,44], demonstrating good
reliability  and  validity.  Items  are  scored  on  a  4-point  Likert
scale ranging from “not at all” (0) to “nearly every day” (3).
The GAD-7 has been validated in a large sample of adolescents
and young adults ages 14-25 years; the measure demonstrated
age  invariance,  reliability,  and  internal  consistency  (GAD-7)
[44].

Well-Being of Youth Participants
Youth Top Problems Assessment (TPA) [45]: the TPA is a brief
idiographic  measure  designed  to  identify  problems  that
adolescents identify as especially important or impactful in their
lives.  Participants  are  asked  to  self-report  between  1  and  3
problems in their lives in their own words, ranking the problems
and then rating them in severity on a 5-point Likert scale from
0 (not a problem) to 4 (a very big problem). This measure has
been  validated  in  adolescents  and  has  been  found  to  be
psychometrically sound [45].

Mentor Relationship
Mentor-Youth  Alliance  Scale  (MYAS)  [46]:  the  MYAS  is  a
9-item  self-report  scale  assessing  youth  perspective  on  the
quality of their relationship with their mentor on a 4-point Likert
scale  ranging  from  1  (very  false)  to  4  (very  true).  The  scale
measures the youth-mentor bond with items like “My mentor
cares about me” and “I feel comfortable with my mentor.” For
the purposes of this study, 1 item was removed, and the wording
of  another  item  was  altered  slightly  based  on  the  needs  and
characteristics  of  the  study  population.  The  MYAS  has
demonstrated  excellent  internal  consistency  (0.92)  and  good
concurrent validity [46].

Satisfaction With the Program
The net promoter score, or NPS, is considered the gold standard
customer experience metric [47]. It is used to measure and track
how a company is perceived by its customers and the loyalty
of its customer base. Customers are asked the question “How
likely  are  you  to  recommend  this  company  to  a  friend  or
colleague?” measured on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at
all  likely)  to  10  (extremely  likely).  NPS  is  calculated  by
subtracting the percentage of detractors, or participants choosing
ratings of 0-6, from the percentage of promoters, or participants
choosing ratings of 9 or 10. NPS scores range from −100 to
+100, and while scores vary across industries, a score of 70+
is considered excellent [47].

In-Depth Interviews With Youth Participants
College  student  interns  conducted  short  interviews  with
participants through the Zoom platform after school hours. Each
interview was recorded through Zoom and transcribed by otter.ai
(version 3.27.0; Otter.ai, Inc). Participants were all asked the
same questions about topics such as (1) their general experience

using Appa Health, including areas where they feel Appa Health
could  continue  to  expand  and  grow  to  better  fit  the  needs  of
young  people;  (2)  their  feedback  about  mentoring  and  their
relationship  with  their  mentor;  and  (3)  their  experience
navigating  and  using  the  digital  content,  including  the
“bite-sized” videos.

Data Analysis
For  quantitative  survey  data,  responses  on  the  PHQ-8  and
GAD-7 surveys across all 3 timepoints were examined using
Stata SE (version 17; StataCorp LLC). Due to the limited sample
size  (n=14),  descriptive  results  in  the  form  of  frequencies,
medians, and IQRs were calculated. For the quantitative aspect
of the TPA, administered at the midpoint, medians and IQRs
were calculated for participant rankings of the severity of each
of their 3 problems.

Qualitative methods were used to examine participant responses
to  the  free-response  portion  of  the  TPA  and  to  the  optional
interviews conducted at the end of the program. For the TPA,
thematic analysis was used to explore themes in participants’
free-response answers listing their top 3 problems. Thematic
analysis is especially suited to assess common or shared themes
presented  across  individuals  within  a  data  set  [48].  These
analyses consisted of the following steps: data familiarization,
the generation of initial codes, examination of themes, revising
themes,  and  defining  and  naming  themes.  For  participant
interviews,  each  interview  was  transcribed  verbatim  using
otter.ai and then reviewed in detail. Transcribed interviews were
also analyzed using a thematic analysis approach [48] applying
a combination of both inductive and deductive coding. At every
stage of the data analysis process, memos were used to capture
any  relevant  data  analysis  insights.  ATLAS.ti  (version  8.4.4;
ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH) was used
to manage the qualitative data.

Ethics Approval
The secondary data analysis involving deidentified data for this
research was approved by the ethical review board of the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (IRB 22486). All
participants  whose  data  were  used  in  this  study  provided
informed consent (if 18 years of age or older) or assent with
parental consent (if younger than 18 years of age) for the use
of their data.

informed  about  privacy  and
Participants  were  also 
confidentiality  protection  with  the  following  statement:  “We
will  do  our  best  to  make  sure  that  the  personal  information
gathered  for  this  study  is  kept  private.  However,  we  cannot
guarantee total privacy. Your or your teen’s personal information
may be given out if required by law. For example, if a condition
that  requires  mandatory  reporting  (eg,  a  child  or  vulnerable
adult  is  being  abused  or  neglected),  is  discovered,  the  usual
procedures will be followed as required by law. If information
from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings,
your or your teen’s name and other personal information will
not be used. In addition, information from this study will only
ever be presented in aggregate, such that no single individual
is identifiable.” Participants were compensated with a gift card
in the amount of US $25 for completion of surveys, and a subset
of participants were compensated an additional US $25 if they
elected to partake in a postintervention interview.

Participant Demographics
The  median  age  of  participants  (n=14)  was  16  (IQR  15-18)
years (Table 1). Participants were primarily white (n = 9, 64%)
and female (n=12, 86%) with 14% (n=2) of teenagers identifying
as male. Two participants (n = 2, 14%) identified as transgender.
Parent reports indicated that half of the participants (n=7, 50%)
had seen a therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental
health professional in the past.

Feasibility and Acceptability of Appa Health
Over the course of the 12 weeks, participants engaged in video
calls  with  their  mentor  for  a  median  of  107  (IQR  50-189)
minutes. The primary reasons participants reported wanting to
join  Appa  Health  were  “anxiety  or  worries”  (n=14,  100%),
“sadness,  low  mood,  or  loss  of  interest”  (n=12,  86%),  and
“general  stress  management”  (n=12,  86%;  Table  2).  Overall,
all participants (n=14, 100%) reported feeling better at the end

of the 12-week program. Moreover, when asked to indicate their
“main reasons for feeling better,” all participants (n=14, 100%)
cited  mentoring,  while  just  over  half  (n=8,  57%)  cited  the
short-form CBT videos. Consistent with this, average scores on
the MYAS were high (mean 35.1, SD 0.95 of a possible 36).

The NPS, which asked participants to rate the likelihood that
they would recommend Appa to a friend, was 85.75 out of a
possible 100. A score of ≥70 is considered excellent [46].

Depression and Anxiety Symptoms

Patient Health Questionnaire-8
Median scores on the PHQ declined from 10 (IQR 8-13) at week
1  to  6.5  (IQR  2-10)  at  week  12  (Table  3 and  Figure  1).
Categories of depressive symptom severity were also examined.

At  week  1,  50%  (n=7)  of  participants  reported  moderate,
moderately  severe,  or  severe  depressive  symptoms.  By  week
12,  29%  (n=4)  of  participants  reported  moderate  depressive
symptoms with no participants reporting moderately severe or
severe symptoms. Moreover, 29% (n=4) reported no significant
depressive symptoms at week 12.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
Median GAD-7 scores reduced from 8.5 (IQR 7-11) at week 1
to 6.5 (IQR 4-7) at week 12 (Table 3 and Figure 2). At week 1,

about  one-third  (n=5,  36%)  of  participants  scored  in  the
moderate or severe anxiety category on the GAD-7. By week
6, that number had dropped to 21% (n=3), and by week 12, no
participants endorsed moderate or severe anxiety symptoms.

problems  were  framed  in  terms  of  functional  outcomes,
particularly, as related to performance (eg, school and college
applications)  and  interpersonal  relationships  (eg,  friendships,
family, and romance). Thus, participants were largely concerned
with  issues  impacting  daily  living  (eg,  “stressed  about
schoolwork” and “loneliness”). The third most endorsed theme
of cognitive or emotional (n=8, 19%) problems demonstrated

that many participants also conceptualized their issues in terms
of  the  cognitive  and  emotional  processes  driving  their  issues
(eg, “trouble regulating emotion” and “overwhelming anxiety,
the constant feeling and worry that I’m not doing enough, that
I’m running out of time, and that I’m watching my life rush
by”).

Semistructured Interviews With Teenaged Participants
Teenagers  were  given  the  option  to  participate  in  short
semistructured  interviews  after  completion  of  the  program.
Interviews with 5 teenagers ranged in length from 10.52 to 25.37
minutes  with  a  median  length  of  14.38  (IQR  11.52-17.18)
minutes.

Overall Perspective on Appa Health
Participants were asked to think of the first 3 words that come
to mind when they think about Appa Health. All participants
expressed positive feelings about Appa Health, with 4 of the 5
participants choosing “support” as one of their 3 words. Other
words shared by participants included “comfort,” “friendship,”

“healthy,”  “proactive,”  “text,”  and  “caring.”  One  participant
further elaborated on this response and stated:

[Three  words  to  describe  Appa  are]  supportive,
engaging, and... just like, basically like providing the
tools I need to, like, build a better mental health space
around  me.  And...  equipping  me  with  the  proper
strategies and concepts [Cisgender male participant,
18 years old]

Addressing Barriers to Access Teenage Mental Health
Services
For  3  of  the  5  participants,  Appa  Health  presented  a  new
opportunity  to  access  teenage  mental  health  services  using  a
different modality from traditional, in-person, services. In total,
2 of these 3 participants cited high costs associated with mental
health services as a major barrier. Furthermore, all 3 participants
compared Appa Health favorably to traditional teenage mental
health services, indicating that the web-based nature of Appa
Health provides a more convenient option for teenagers. Two
of these participants expressed the following:

I  would  say  I  feel  even  better  about  Appa  [after
completing the program]. Before the program I like,
did in person therapy before and honestly, like, it's a
big commitment to like, drive to and like, take that
time out of your day. So it was really nice for [Appa]
to just, you know, be in the comfort of your own home,
and  do  things  more  remotely. 
[Cisgender  male
participant, 18 years old]

It's hard to find support for people that are under 16.
And I think it's also hard to find support that's not
going to cost like $400 for session. And I also, I had
found a therapist, but she just was more trained with
speaking to adults. So it wasn't really working out for
me. And I couldn't make the hour-long sessions with
my  school  schedule.  So...the  help  that's  there
sometimes doesn't work. And so I just don't think there
was enough. But then [with Appa], I thought, well,
it's like, only 30 minutes, and I can talk to my mentor
whenever and the videos I can watch and I can look
back on. And I just realized it was a lot more helpful
than  what  I  had  before. 
[Transgender  female
participant, 15 years old]

Appropriate Candidates for Appa Health
When asked who might be an appropriate candidate for Appa
Health, 3 participants indicated that Appa would be a good fit
for teenagers who are “willing to share” and are “open-minded”
about  discussing  their  experiences  and  getting  to  know  their
mentor.

One participant expressed that Appa Health feels geared more
for teenagers who are more self-aware of their emotional state
and  need  extra  support  in  their  daily  lives.  However,  the
participant indicated that a therapist should be used for more
professional help:

I think a teenager who is aware of their emotions. I
don't  think  it's  for  people  who  desperately  need
professional  help,  but  it's  more  of  a  thing  for  like,

https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e49998

XSL•FO
RenderX

people who want extra support. Because if you need
professional  help,  you  should  go  to  a  professional
therapist.  But  if  you  need  like,  just  a  little  bit  of
support in your daily life and talk to somebody that
I  think  this  is  great  for  you. [Cisgender  male
participant, 18 years old]

Lastly, one participant with experience with traditional mental
health services indicated that Appa Health would be appropriate
for teenagers who may not want to have a traditional therapy
session with a therapist due to time commitments or challenges
like anxiety. This participant said:

I  think  [Appa  would  be  good  for]  someone  who's
looking for someone to talk to you that's not sitting
there writing on a notepad taking down everything
you say, and someone it's not trying to analyze all of
your thoughts. Also [for] someone who's struggling
through something, or if they're just kind of getting
stressed a lot or getting anxious a lot. I would say
someone who's more likely, like doesn't have time for
longer sessions. [Transgender female participant, 15
years old]

Appa Health Mentoring Experience and Dynamics
All  5  participants  expressed  having  had  a  highly  positive
experience with their mentors. Participants all described their
mentors as compassionate individuals who were able to listen
to  their  struggles  and  current  situations  and  offer  them
constructive advice, support, and a space for understanding and
dialog.  All  participants  expressed  looking  forward  to  their
mentoring sessions. One participant reported applying lessons
she  learned  from  her  mentor  when  she  was  experiencing  a
difficult time:

When I started the program, I was in a, like, a really
low spot. And I think that my mentor, like, she really
kind  of  helped  me  through  that. [Cisgender  female
participant, 12 years old]

The participant went on to explain that her mentor leveraged
her own lived experience to demonstrate a technique to shift
her  perspective  when  negative  events  occur.  This  simple
technique  entailed  acknowledging  the  presence  of  negative
events  while  simultaneously  noticing  positive  events  that  are
also  present  in  her  life.  The  mentor’s  explanation  parallels
Appa’s content and further reinforces the concept.

Another  participant  described  challenges  with 
feeling
comfortable openly sharing with others. However, through the
mentoring component of Appa Health, this participant recalled
being able to share more candidly with her mentor. She said:

I struggled talking about the past [but] like towards
the end of the program.... I knew my relationship was
close with my mentor. And I trusted her.... I was able
to, like open up to her. And she was able to like guide
me  through  it  sort  of,  even  though  like  it  was
something that had already happened, but like had
still  been  affecting  me.  She  was  just  powerful.

Giovanelli et al

Finally, a participant expressed valuing the ability to select a
mentor that could relate to their racial identity, saying:

When we first started, we had the option to request
for a mentor to be a person of color. And I just really
liked  that  option.  It  just  made  me  a  lot  more
comfortable sharing my experiences. [Cisgender male
participant, 18 years old]

In  total,  3  of  5  participants  reported  missing  the  mentoring
component  of  Appa  Health,  now  having  completed  the
curriculum.  These  participants  all  expressed  feeling  “sad”  at
not being able to connect with their mentors on a weekly basis
as they had done while in the program, saying:

I was really excited every week to like, get to talk to
her.  And  she  was  also  just  like,  really  nice....  So  it
was like really sad actually having to like, have our
last  call  and  everything.
female
participant, 12 years old]

[Cisgender 

I'm  actually  really  sad  that  it  ended,  because  I'm
really glad that I got the opportunity to join. And I
would  not  change  that  at  all.  But  I  am  very
sad...because sometimes things will happen and I'm
like, “Oh, I wish I could text my mentor right now.”
[Transgender female participant, 15 years old]

Appa Health Video Experience
All participants expressed positive attitudes toward the Appa
Health program short-form CBT skill videos. Participants all
reported  liking  the  length  of  the  videos,  expressing  that  it
facilitated engagement with the content:

I really liked it because it was really informational
and  a  lot  of  new  things  and  new  concepts  but  also
like compressed into one-minute to two-minute video
that was easily digestible. I wouldn't have to like, get
bored  or  anything  like  that.  Like  I  would  be
understanding  and  engag[ing]  with  the  video.
[Cisgender male participant, 18 years old]

One participant suggested that if longer videos were made for
the program, a short video summary should still be included:

I did really like the bite-sized videos because I think
like  I  started  getting  a  lot  of  schoolwork....  I  don't
think I could watch an hour-long video. I think like,
the short videos were [a] really good size. But if they
were looking to do longer videos, maybe still include
some like, like a summary video that could go along
with it that people could watch. [Transgender female
participant, 15 years old]

In terms of recommendations for video content and engagement,
one  participant  recommended  that  mentors  use  the  videos  to
further  engage  with  participants  on  weekly  content  and
discussions while in the Appa Health program. This participant
stated:

It would be helpful if like the mentors also went over
everything with you just to like, clarify everything and
like maybe go into more detail about it. [Cisgender
female participant, 12 years old]

https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e49998

XSL•FO
RenderX

Other  participants  recommended  that  the  videos  expand  to
further share more “personal experiences” or to illustrate more
longer-term  approaches  to  understanding  and  handling  one’s
mental health. This participant stated:

I  think  [the  videos]  did  cover...how  to  handle  your
emotions  very  well.  But  I  feel  like,  I  feel  like  there
wasn't  really  like  approach  to  like,  fixing  it,  it  was
more of an approach of like, helping you right then
and  there  to  like,  calm  down,  and  think  about  the
situation  more.  The  videos  didn't  really  feel  like,
“Hey, if you do this, you could work on your mental
health  from  here.”...I  just  wanted  something  more.
[Cisgender male participant, 18 years old]

Lastly,  one  participant  also  recommended  including  video
content  on  feeling  “overwhelmed”  and  “overworked”  due  to
school commitments and demands.

Applications of Appa Health Learned Skills and
Techniques Into Everyday Life
When  asked  if  and  how  the  skills  learned  through  the  Appa
Health program were being applied into their everyday lives,
all participants said they benefited from learning through the
Appa Health program and that they used the information and
instructions  gained  from  the  Appa  Health  videos  or  their
mentorship relationships to address their own mental health. In
one  example,  a  participant  recalled  using  the  cognitive
behavioral triangle to address negative thoughts:

I definitely use the...behavioral triangles. So like, if
I'm feeling a certain way, I try and trace it back to
why. And then if I can't really change my thought on
why, like if I can't really change my negative thoughts,
and I try and change behavior to hopefully influence
my  emotions. [Transgender  female  participant,  15
years old]

In another example, a participant discusses using CBT learned
through their mentor to address experiences of anxiety at school:

So at my school I’m on a leadership team, so I had
to  do  announcements  one  day,  and  that  really  was
triggering my anxiety because I was anxious about
it. But [my mentor and I] talked about like CBT and
like changing our thought processes. So I just thought
about that and what [my mentor] had talked about,
and  about,  like  how  to  change  these  like  negative
thoughts that might not even be realistic or like the
reality so I thought about that, and that helped me a
lot to get over that fear. [Cisgender male participant,
18 years old]

Lastly, one participant recalled applying breathing techniques
learned through Appa Health when feeling stressed and anxious:

I  can  get  really  like  stressed  out.  I'm  in  track,  and
yesterday, we had an away meet, which meant that
we had to ride the bus because my parents didn't get
home  in  time  to  like,  drive  me  there....  I  get  really
stressed out on buses, so I was using the breathing
techniques [and] that really helped me out yesterday.
Also, when I get really anxious at night, too.... I use

Discussion

Principal Results
The purpose of this study was to use adolescent participant data
from Appa Health, a 12-week web-based mentoring program
combining weekly 30-minute video sessions, text chat, and a
structured curriculum of short-form videos teaching CBT skills,
to determine acceptability and preliminary efficacy for mental
health and well-being of youth.

Teenagers’ primary reasons for joining Appa related to mood,
stress, and anxiety. A qualitative examination of participants’
top problem areas indicated that problems most often cited by
teenagers  were  related  to  performance  and  interpersonal
concerns.

Feasibility and acceptability measures of the present participants
suggested  that  the  Appa  Health  program  was  feasible  with
satisfactory rates of engagement with mentors via video chats.
Participants also found the program acceptable: MYAS scores
were high, and the overall NPS was excellent, with around 85%
(n=12) of young people choosing a 9 or 10 out of 10 when asked
“how likely is it that you would recommend Appa to a friend?”
Qualitative  data  from  interviews  enriched  the  picture  of
feasibility and acceptability. Participants were enthusiastic about
Appa, citing the reduction of barriers to care, highly positive
mentor experiences, and appreciation of both the content and
presentation  of  the  short-form  videos.  Youth  suggestions  for
improvement of video content included additional content on
feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork and longer-term approaches
to improving and sustaining mental health.

Youth  scores  on  measures  of  symptoms  of  depression  and
generalized  anxiety  demonstrated  promising  trends  over  the
course of the program with scores on the PHQ-8 and the GAD-7
reducing in severity over the course of the 12-week program.

Comparisons With Prior Work
This is the first study assessing the combination of short-form
digital  content  and  near-peer  mentoring  from  mentors  with
shared lived experiences of youth depression and anxiety. While
this concept is novel, there is precedent for both the core concept
of  pairing  human  support  with  digital  tools  [21-23]  and  for
mentors supporting the delivery of mental health interventions
[11-16].  While  this  design  does  not  allow  us  to  compare  to
young people receiving digital tools or human support alone,
the preliminary quantitative and qualitative results here indicate
that youth with significant symptoms of depression or anxiety
felt  adequately  supported  by  their  mentor  and  by  the  CBT
content and that the human support was crucial to the feasibility
and  acceptability  of  the  intervention.  This  is  consistent  with
prior literature.

Limitations
While this study has several strengths, including a theory-driven
and evidence-based approach drawing on CBT and SCT and
in-depth  qualitative  interviews  to  provide  a  fuller  picture  of
feasibility  and  acceptability,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge

https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e49998

XSL•FO
RenderX

several  limitations  of  this  pilot  study  that  require  additional
research.  First,  due  to  low  response  rates  from  parents  and
guardians as the Appa team sought research consent, the overall
sample of teenagers who consented to participate in the research
was limited. Thus, a self-selection bias toward more engaged
teenagers and their parents is likely. The teenagers in this study
consented or assented to research and completed measures at
all 3 timepoints. These teenagers may be qualitatively different
than those who were not able to participate in this study. Second,
due  to  the  small  sample  size,  the  ability  to  explore  greater
nuanced experiences in Appa Health was limited. An expanded
sample  will  allow  for  the  exploration  of  characteristics  of
teenagers who are engaged in Appa and for whom the program
works, providing more clarity on mechanisms of effectiveness.
Third, the lack of follow-up post–end point survey means we
are unable to assess sustained improvements. Lastly, there was
no  objective  metric  of  engagement  with  the  CBT  videos.  As
such,  there  are  many  potential  areas  for  future  investigation.
Running  a  similar  investigation  using  a  larger,  more  diverse
sample of teenagers and incorporating additional measures of
feasibility, such as rates of recruitment, adherence, and attrition,
would  be  helpful  in  expanding  upon  this  pilot’s  results.
Additionally, examination of reasons for and patterns behind
attrition will be necessary to better understand who is best suited
for  participation.  Finally,  large-scale  randomized  controlled
trials would be helpful in further understanding the effectiveness
of this novel solution (short-form CBT skills videos coupled
with  paraprofessional  mentorship)  relative  to  its  components
(standalone CBT and standalone mentorship) as well as existing
other  solutions  (therapy  and  other  types  of  digital  tools),  in
addition to further understanding the underlying mechanisms
of action. It also remains to be seen where an intervention like
Appa Health fits on the care continuum in the broader digital
mental  health  landscape.  Nevertheless,  this  study  provides
directional evidence of a potentially clinically meaningful and
engaging  intervention  to  meet  the  mental  health  needs  of
adolescents.

Conclusions
Appa Health aims to be part of the solution to the youth mental
health  crisis  by  combining  brief  video-based  CBT  delivery
methods  in  a  modern,  accessible  format  to  adolescents  with
evidence-based  mentoring  for  teenagers  with  depression  and
anxiety, all delivered remotely in a fully digital environment.
Appa’s approach to video production uses a format with proven
engagement success (TikTok influencers with clinical expertise
and a significant social media following), and Appa’s approach
to mentoring is theory-driven and evidence-based, leveraging
near-peer mentors with shared lived experience and identities
who are trained to provide supportive accountability. Moreover,
the  use  of  paraprofessionals  (trained  mentors  supervised  by
clinical  psychologists)  and  auxiliary  methods  (video)  to
supplement, support, or supplant the clinical workforce could
provide a transferable, generalizable model to increase access
to effective services and support overburdened professionals.
Finally, Appa’s large, diverse pool of remote mentors permits
a wide sample of near-peers with whom to match young people
and foster alliance. In sum, Appa Health has the potential to

become a blueprint for accessible, mentor-supported, self-help
