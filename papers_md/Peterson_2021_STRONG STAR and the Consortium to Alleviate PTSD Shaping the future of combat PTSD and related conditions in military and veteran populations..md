the Future of Combat PTSD and Related Conditions in Military 
and Veteran Populations

A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.

Abstract

The STRONG STAR Consortium (South Texas Research Organizational Network Guiding 
Studies on Trauma and Resilience) and the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD are interdisciplinary 
and multi-institutional research consortia focused on the detection, diagnosis, prevention, and 
treatment of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid conditions in 
military personnel and veterans. This manuscript outlines the consortia’s state-of-the-science 
collaborative research model and how this can be used as a roadmap for future trauma-related 
research. STRONG STAR was initially funded for 5 years in 2008 by the U.S. Department of 
Defense’s (DoD) Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Program. Since the 
initial funding of STRONG STAR, almost 50 additional peer-reviewed STRONG STAR-affiliated 
projects have been funded through the DoD, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the 
National Institutes of Health, and private organizations. In 2013, STRONG STAR investigators 
partnered with the VA’s National Center for PTSD and were selected for joint DoD/VA funding 
to establish the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD. STRONG STAR and the Consortium to Alleviate 
PTSD have assembled a critical mass of investigators and institutions with the synergy required 
to make major scientific and public health advances in the prevention and treatment of combat

Introduction

The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been the longest military operations in U.S. 
history [1]. Many service members have deployed multiple times, and the high operational 
tempo over such an extended period is unprecedented for the U.S. military. Combat-
related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the psychological health problem most 
commonly associated with these deployments [2, 3]. The potential military and public 
health consequences of combat-related PTSD in post-9/11 service members and veterans 
were brought to international attention through several seminal research reports [4–7]. These 
reports highlighted the need for effective treatments for PTSD in this new generation of 
combat veterans.

In 2008, a body of scientific literature existed on PTSD treatment in civilian and veteran 
populations [5, 8–11]. Prolonged Exposure [12–14] and Cognitive Processing Therapy [15–
18] were identified as the leading evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral treatments for these 
groups. However, the treatment-outcome literature in military populations was sparse, and 
no randomized clinical trials had been conducted to evaluate any treatment for PTSD in 
active duty military personnel [19, 20]. In response to these research gaps, Department of 
Defense (DoD) funding was allocated to the Congressionally Directed Medical Research 
Programs to establish a Multidisciplinary PTSD Research Consortium. After a competitive, 
peer-reviewed process, the South Texas Research Organizational Network Guiding Studies 
on Trauma and Resilience, or the STRONG STAR Consortium, was funded in 2008 for 
5 years. Headquartered at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 
STRONG STAR is a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research consortium focused on 
the detection, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of combat PTSD and related conditions 
(e.g., traumatic brain injury, sleep disorders, chronic pain, substance use disorders, tinnitus, 
suicide) in military personnel and veterans.

Initial DoD funding for STRONG STAR supported 14 projects and four research cores 
[21]. STRONG STAR investigators subsequently secured additional peer-reviewed funding 
through the DoD, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
and private organizations to support almost 50 STRONG STAR-affiliated projects. In 2013, 
STRONG STAR investigators partnered with the VA’s National Center for PTSD and were 
selected for joint DoD/VA funding to establish the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP), 
which developed 11 additional research projects [21].

2.  Addressing the psychological health needs of post-9/11 service 

members and veterans

In 2006, concerns about the emerging deployment-related mental health needs of the U.S. 
military led to the establishment of a DoD Task Force on Mental Health [22]. The task force 
published a report highlighting that the DoD and VA systems of care were insufficient to 
meet current and future psychological health needs of service members and veterans. The 
report specifically highlighted the significant risks for combat-related PTSD and traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) in service members who had deployed in support of post-9/11 combat 
operations. The report noted two major concerns, including significant staffing shortages 
of mental health personnel in the DoD and VA and limited empirical data available 
to guide treatment recommendations for combat-related PTSD, especially in active duty 
military populations. In response to these clinical and research needs of significant national 
importance, the U.S. Congress appropriated $300 million for DoD research programs 
targeting PTSD and TBI [23].

Given the dearth in 2007 of previous clinical trials treating combat-related PTSD in 
military personnel, the initial STRONG STAR research portfolio placed heavy emphasis 
on treatments with the strongest scientific evidence from previous clinical trials in civilian 
and veteran populations. Much of the scientific literature at the time had been reviewed and 
summarized in a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) titled Treatment of Posttraumatic 
Stress Disorder: An Assessment of the Evidence, which was publicly available as a 
prepublication copy in 2007 and subsequently published in 2008 [5]. That publication 
reported the results of the IOM committee review of 52 psychotherapy studies and 37 
pharmacotherapy studies. In the overall summary, the IOM reported, “The committee finds 
that the evidence is sufficient to conclude the efficacy of exposure therapies in the treatment 
of PTSD” [5(p8)]. However, this conclusion was limited to work in civilian trauma. The 
committee found that the state of the research on the treatment of PTSD in U.S. veterans 
was inadequate to answer questions about (1) the efficacy of interventions with and (2) the 
settings and lengths of treatment that are applicable to military populations. Trauma-focused 
therapies were the only form of treatment to receive the IOM committee’s highest level of 
endorsement.

The majority of the studies reviewed by the IOM included one or more cognitive-behavioral 
therapy approaches, and the largest proportion of these studies included an exposure-or 
trauma-focused therapy. The IOM committee recognized that exposure was frequently 
administered in combination with another cognitive-behavioral therapy technique. That led 
the committee to group together studies with exposure and exposure plus something else 
(e.g., Cognitive Processing Therapy). The committee concluded that there was inadequate 
evidence to determine the efficacy of Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing 
(EMDR) or any form of group therapy for PTSD. Similarly, the IOM concluded, data was 
insufficient to support efficacy of pharmacotherapy for PTSD.

The IOM report substantially guided STRONG STAR project selection. Prolonged Exposure 
(PE) [12, 13], Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) [15–18], Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint 
Therapy (CBCT) for PTSD [24], and various adaptations of these therapies were thought 
to have the most promise as interventions for combat-related PTSD in military personnel 
and recently discharged veterans. In addition, we envisioned that PTSD treatments provided 
soon after exposure to traumatic events could result in positive outcomes for this population 
that might rival the outcomes found in civilians. For example, in one civilian study, up 
to 80% of female sexual assault survivors who completed treatment with PE or CPT 
were found no longer to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD or even to have been treated 
successfully into remission [16]. We therefore sought to develop clinical trials that evaluated 
these therapies’ efficacy for the first time in military personnel and veterans of post-9/11 
combat operations.

2.1.  The STRONG STAR Multidisciplinary PTSD Research Consortium

In March 2008, STRONG STAR was selected for funding after a competitive peer review for 
the Multidisciplinary PTSD Research Consortium. Funding to support STRONG STAR was 
from the DoD’s PTSD and TBI Research Program (W81XWH-07-PTSD-MRC) and was 
made through multiple independent research awards to the Partnering Principal Investigators 
(PIs). The original STRONG STAR Multidisciplinary PTSD Research Consortium included 
14 research projects focused primarily on active military and recently discharged veterans in 
South and Central Texas, with one study even occurring in deployed settings. Supplemental 
Table 1 provides a summary of the projects including (1) the PI, (2) the project title, (3) 
a brief project description, (4) the research participants, recruitment sites, and participant 
sample sizes, and (5) the scientific manuscripts produced to date as a result of each project. 
Supplemental Figure 1 illustrates how the consortium was administratively organized. It 
should be noted that, although the consortium was headquartered through an Administrative 
Core (see supplemental text) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San 
Antonio, STRONG STAR was, from its inception, a nationwide consortium of individual 
PIs located at leading research institutions around the country. Project PIs worked through 
the Administrative Core to conduct multiple projects at one of four military or VA 
performance sites. The Administrative Core provided all infrastructure and support functions 
to conduct studies in full regulatory compliance according to International Conference 
on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The consortium was advised 
by a DoD-appointed External Advisory Board and a STRONG STAR Administrative Core-
selected Executive Steering Committee.

2.2.  STRONG STAR-affiliated projects

During the 5-year funding cycle of the STRONG STAR Multidisciplinary PTSD Research 
Consortium, its DoD’s External Advisory Board encouraged investigators to seek additional 
peer-reviewed grant awards so the consortium could be sustained with additional research 
funding beyond the initial award period. In response to this recommendation, STRONG 
STAR investigators collaborated to submit many grant applications to DoD, VA, NIH, and 
private funding sources. These projects are now referred to as STRONG STAR-affiliated 
projects to distinguish them from the projects supported by the original funding of the 
Multidisciplinary PTSD Research Consortium.

Supplemental Table 2 provides an overview of 48 STRONG STAR-affiliated projects that 
have been added over the past 13 years, including (1) the PI, (2) the funding source and 
award number, (3) the project title, (4) a brief description of the project and current status, 
(5) the research participants, recruitment sites, and participant sample sizes, if applicable, 
and (6) the scientific manuscripts produced to date as a result of each project. The focus 
of STRONG STAR-affiliated projects expanded to include common comorbid conditions 
such as sleep disorders (8 projects), chronic pain (5 projects), suicide (4 projects), tinnitus 
(2 projects), and traumatic brain injury (1 project). Supplemental Figure 2 shows how 
the consortium was administratively organized to support affiliated projects. Multiple-PI 
arrangements or subawards allowed both the PIs and the consortium to receive funding from 
the funding agency. Investigators had options to work directly with their community sites or 
VAs or indirectly through the STRONG STAR Administrative Core and its affiliated military 
sites. Options also allowed investigators to use central data management and statistical 
analyses and to contribute to the data repository (see Section 2.3 and supplemental text).

2.3.  The Consortium to Alleviate PTSD

On August 31, 2012, a National Research Action Plan was approved as part of an Executive 
Order from President Obama to improve access to mental health services for veterans, 
service members, and military families [25]. The National Research Action Plan outlined 
a framework for improved coordination across governmental organizations (e.g., DoD, VA, 
NIH, etc.) with the goal that scientists from the academic and industrial sectors share 
information, inspire innovations, and accelerate science. It also outlined key themes related 
to PTSD, TBI, and suicide-prevention research and allocated funding to support nationwide 
research consortia in each of these areas. The research consortia included the Consortium to 
Alleviate PTSD, the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium, and the Military Suicide 
Research Consortium. The primary research priorities for PTSD were related to biomarkers, 
mechanisms, and treatment research.

In the initial award of the original STRONG STAR Multidisciplinary PTSD Research 
Consortium, all 14 research projects were funded with the original award. In contrast, 
the CAP Government Steering Committee (GSC) approved only one of the seven CAP 
projects proposed by PIs in the original application (i.e., the Treatment of Comorbid 
Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Headaches; PI: Donald McGeary, PhD). Because 
project approvals and funding were determined by the GSC, the Coordinating Center, which 
for the CAP functioned similarly to the STRONG STAR Administrative Core, published

two Requests for Applications that were disseminated to over 84,000 potential applicants 
over the first 3 years of the CAP award. A scientific review process was developed that 
screened over 200 research preproposals. Approximately 10% were selected to submit full 
proposal applications that were evaluated through an independent, peer-reviewed process. 
Of those, 11 projects were finally selected and approved by the GSC to be part of the 
CAP research portfolio. The primary focus of CAP projects was to expand on the results of 
previous STRONG STAR studies and to integrate biomarkers to assess treatment prognosis, 
mechanisms of change, and treatment outcomes. An outline of the CAP projects is provided 
in Supplemental Table 3, including (1) the PI, (2) the project title, (3) a brief project 
description, (4) the research participants, recruitment sites, and participant sample sizes, and 
(5) the scientific manuscripts produced to date as a result of each project. Supplemental 
Figure 3 shows how the CAP was administratively organized. All DoD funds were dispersed 
only through the Coordinating Center in San Antonio, while VA funds were granted through 
the central VA grants office. Because of increased funding through VA sources, the CAP 
included more local VA sites for investigators compared to STRONG STAR studies. The 
Coordinating Center fulfilled all administrative and sponsor roles for regulatory compliance 
and facilitated study activity and data management at multiple performance sites. It also 
provided overall project management and reporting to the GSC.

Another aspect of the National Research Action Plan was the overarching goal of 
standardizing, integrating, and sharing research data at a national level, which required a 
standard set of unique data identifiers and assessment measures known as common data 
elements, or CDEs [26, 27]. A specific emphasis was placed on the assessment of war- or 
combat-related trauma [28–33]. The use of CDEs was initially established with the original 
STRONG STAR Consortium and then incorporated into the STRONG STAR-affiliated 
studies and the CAP studies. Revised versions of CDE measures were incorporated as 
necessary. Because of the consistent use of established and accepted CDEs across all 
research projects, we were able to transfer and store all CAP data in the STRONG STAR-
CAP Repository (described in the supplemental text). This data repository was established 
in compliance with research regulations to promote and facilitate the sharing of data across 
projects and for other investigations beyond the original consortia and individual projects 
themselves.

2.4.  Lessons Learned in the Management of a Nationwide Research Consortium

There have been three different consortium funding and administrative management models 
used within STRONG STAR and CAP, and there are advantages and disadvantages of each 
(see Supplemental Figures 1–3). First, the original STRONG STAR Consortium included the 
funding of 14 PTSD research projects as part of the initial award. A Government Officer 
Representative (e.g., science officer or program manager) managed it with consultation 
provided by an External Advisory Board. An advantage of this model was the streamlined 
decision-making process with regards to research administration, which allowed projects to 
be initiated immediately. A disadvantage of the model was the need to obtain regulatory 
approvals, establish participant recruitment methods, and initiate recruitment for 14 projects 
simultaneously. This led to delays in starting projects and a backlog of proposals submitted 
for review and approval by the single military Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing

all of the projects. Overall, we believe that this is the most efficient and effective 
administrative model to support a multidisciplinary research consortium.

The second consortium funding and administrative management model is the one initiated 
with the funding of the first STRONG STAR-affiliated project in March 2009 and is the 
current model being used by the consortium. This involves the management of multiple 
investigator-initiated projects, with each project providing a small amount of funding to 
support STRONG STAR Consortium infrastructure in return for assistance with use of 
common data elements, access to military and veteran populations, and support for analysis, 
publication, and dissemination of results. The primary advantages of this model are the 
streamlined research administration and approval processes, consisting of an individual 
science officer for each project. Currently these STRONG STAR-affiliated projects are also 
supported by additional infrastructure provided thus far by year-to-year funding from the 
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and the VA’s National Center 
for PTSD. A disadvantage of this model is that it is difficult to maintain the necessary 
infrastructure without primary infrastructure funding from the DoD and/or VA to support 
multiple ongoing research projects.

The final consortium funding and administrative management model is the one that was used 
by CAP, which included funding from both the DoD and VA to support the research cores 
and projects. An advantage of this model was that both the DoD and VA contributed to 
and had a stake in the consortium and essentially doubled the funding to support research 
cores and projects. This model also provided investigators with the opportunity to recruit 
both active duty military and veteran participants into studies. CAP clearly demonstrated 
that joint DoD/VA research funding could be effectively leveraged to support the research 
goals of the DoD and VA. A drawback of the CAP model was the ungainly three-tiered 
administrative management model. The CAP Coordinating Center leadership reported to the 
Government Officer Representative, who reported to a Government Steering Committee led 
by two co-chairs (one from the DoD and one from VA), who reported to a panel of three 
senior leaders from the DoD, VA, and the Department of Health Affairs. This multi-layered 
consortium administrative management model was very inefficient, resulting in long delays 
for most research administrative activities. In addition, the CAP model required the CAP 
Coordinating Center to manage nationwide requests for applications, including the review of 
hundreds of pre-proposal applications along with the management of an external scientific 
review process. The time-consuming development and administration of the review process 
by the CAP Coordinating Center coupled with the three-tiered approval process resulted 
in the final two CAP research projects not being approved by the panel of senior leaders 
until the CAP was 3 years into its initial 5-year consortium award. With the primary focus 
of CAP being PTSD randomized clinical trials (RCTs)—often requiring a 3- to 5-year 
period of performance to complete—a 2-year extension without funds at the end of the third 
year of the consortium was necessary to complete the projects. The delays in obtaining 
administrative research approvals resulted in the Government Steering Committee members 
and panel of senior leaders being generally frustrated by and disappointed with the perceived 
lack of research progress. This led some Government Steering Committee members to 
repeatedly recommend the termination of ongoing clinical trials due to failure to meet the 
original recruitment goals. Nonetheless, despite delays in starting up the trials, by the end

of the 2-year extension, 10 of the 11 projects successfully accomplished their research 
objectives, and many produced high-impact research results. Overall, we observed that 
the CAP model was the least efficient administrative model to support a multidisciplinary 
research consortium. However, a jointly funded DoD/VA research consortium similar to 
CAP would have excellent potential for success with (1) a streamlined governmental 
oversight model similar to the original STRONG STAR Consortium, (2) advance planning 
for distribution of nationwide requests for applications utilizing external scientific reviewers, 
and (3) an overall 7-year period of performance to allow for review of proposals and the 
conduct of clinical trials.

3.  Discussion

The synergistic work of STRONG STAR and the CAP has contributed to major advances 
in the state-of-the-science on and the direct care and treatment of service members 
and veterans impacted by combat-PTSD and common comorbidities. In a team-science 
approach, over 150 nationwide investigators have secured approximately $200 million 
in peer-reviewed funding to support approximately 70 ongoing or completed projects, 
including over 40 clinical trials, involving 50 different civilian, military, VA, academic 
research and health care institutions. In their pioneer efforts to bring RCTs on combat-
related PTSD and other psychological health conditions to active duty military and post-9/11 
veteran populations, consortia leadership and investigators have developed specific and 
significant expertise in this area. To date, over 4,000 patients have participated in STRONG 
STAR-CAP clinical trials, and almost 25,000 have participated in clinical observations 
studies.

This effort has led to significant military-relevant research and dissemination advances 
resulting from a unified research approach. For example, the consortia have established 
an unprecedented infrastructure to support psychological health research at military sites 
around the country. They also have implemented a streamlined research regulatory approval 
processes to help investigators navigate a complex landscape of DoD, VA, and civilian 
IRBs as well as the DoD’s Human Research Protection Office. The incorporation of 
common data elements across studies and the collection of study data into a repository 
enables large-scale analyses that could not be done with data from an individual study 
alone and creates the potential to address future questions not even foreseen today. The 
consortia’s numerous clinical trials with service members and veterans also have allowed 
for the development of some of the most experienced and culturally competent research 
therapists in the country, who now train civilian providers nationwide in the delivery of 
evidence-based treatments for combat-PTSD and related conditions. In addition, the San 
Antonio Combat PTSD Conference was an outgrowth of our own investigator meetings. 
Now this international gathering provides a unique opportunity to share the latest advances 
on the state-of-the-science in combat-PTSD care and treatment with researchers, clinicians, 
policy makers, and the public. For more information on these items and other details about 
consortium operation, see the supplementary materials.

The ultimate benefits of the consortia’s research are in our increased understanding of how 
best to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat combat-PTSD and related conditions. Here, the

collective efforts of our investigators have yielded over 200 published scientific manuscripts 
and more than 500 presentations at national and international conferences. Overall, the 
results of STRONG STAR-CAP clinical trials indicate that PTSD, sleep disorders (insomnia, 
nightmares, sleep apnea), chronic pain, substance use disorders, tinnitus, and suicidal 
ideation can be treated effectively in post-9/11 military and veteran populations using 
cognitive-behavioral therapies alone and/or with medications or medical devices (e.g., 
transcranial magnetic stimulation in combination with inpatient therapy). In general, the 
outcomes of these clinical trials with service members and veterans have been less robust 
than those involving civilians treated for similar conditions. Possible explanations include 
the unique occupational demands of military personnel, the unique nature of traumas 
experienced in the military, and the potential for service-connected disability. Several reports 
have indicated that the length of deployments, number of deployments, cumulative overall 
duration of deployments, and limited dwell time between deployments (i.e., time at the 
service member’s home station) may all increase the cumulative detrimental health risk 
for polymorbid physical and psychological health conditions [34–37]. The more modest 
outcomes for military personnel may also potentially be due to higher levels of perceived 
stigma in seeking out mental health treatment because of the possibility of negative career 
impacts (e.g., loss of weapons-bearing status or security clearances) [38]. Deployed military 
personnel may also be at increased risk for experiencing more traumatic losses [28]. 
Finally, military training that emphasizes maintaining high levels of vigilance and the 
precise adherence to policies, procedures, and a military ethos that may have life-saving 
consequences can be difficult to extinguish after returning from the combat theater.

It is noteworthy that STRONG STAR and CAP investigators have conducted relatively few 
psychopharmacology clinical trials. This limited research was guided initially by the 2008 
IOM report on the treatment of PTSD [5(p85)], which stated, “Based on its assessment 
of the medications for which randomized controlled trials were available…the committee 
found the evidence for all classes of drugs reviewed inadequate to determine efficacy for 
patients with PTSD.” Over the past 13 years, the consortium reviewed dozens of research 
proposals to evaluate various medications and compounds for PTSD treatment. The majority 
were not selected for funding after scientific and programmatic review. The consortium has 
conducted three RCTs evaluating sertraline (Supplemental Table 1; PI: Roache), doxazosin 
(Supplemental Table 3; PI: Back), and ketamine (Supplemental Table 3; PI: Krystal). 
Unfortunately, none of these RCTs found the medications to be efficacious in treating PTSD. 
These results are consistent with those of other pharmacological studies conducted with 
civilian, veteran, and military populations, and they highlight what has been described as a 
crisis in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, as well as the need for additional research [39].

At the time of STRONG STAR’s initial funding in 2008, no RCTs had been conducted 
to evaluate any form of treatment for combat-related PTSD in active duty military 
personnel. STRONG STAR and CAP investigators have now conducted 26 clinical 
trials focused specifically on combat-related PTSD in military and post-9/11 veteran 
populations [21]. Working collaboratively as a research consortium, we have used each 
PTSD clinical trial in our portfolio systematically and incrementally to improve our 
understanding of combat-related PTSD and its treatment and to examine the functional 
outcomes with service members, veterans, and their families. In many cases, a series

of clinical trials evaluating treatments such as Prolonged Exposure, Cognitive Processing 
Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy, and Written Exposure Therapy have been 
conducted, with each subsequent clinical trial building on the results of previous trials 
to further improve outcomes and functioning. No PTSD treatment has been established 
that helps all patients. However, STRONG STAR and CAP investigators have developed, 
evaluated, and disseminated a number of evidence-based treatments for combat-related 
PTSD to help fill the clinical toolbox for behavioral health providers. Additionally, 
consortium investigators have pushed out effective treatments to specialty mental health 
to improve access through interventions set in primary care, provided through telehealth, and 
offered through web-based applications.

Despite the tremendous contributions made by STRONG STAR and CAP investigators to 
advance research and clinical practice related to the treatment of combat-related PTSD, 
much work remains to be done. With recovery rates limited to slightly more than 50% 
of those treated with current evidence-based interventions, and as the incidence of PTSD 
continues to persist in military and veteran populations, there is a critical need for continued 
funding of a nationwide PTSD research consortium.

Additional research is needed to further improve the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and 
prevention of PTSD and comorbid conditions in service members and veterans. More 
trials are needed on how best to tailor treatments and treatment protocols to yield the 
best outcomes for these complex cases. Clinical trials are also needed to evaluate the 
combination of cognitive-behavioral therapies with medications and medical devices. In 
addition, brief interventions that can be administered soon after trauma exposure in far-
forward combat locations need to be evaluated as methods to prevent the onset of chronic 
PTSD. As was done at various points throughout the history of the consortium, the use 
of community-based participatory research and the inclusion of key stakeholders such as 
service members, veterans, family members, and military leaders should be incorporated 
into the planning, review, approval, and management of clinical studies.

Continued federal funding is needed to advance and expand upon the many important 
scientific and public health contributions made by STRONG STAR and CAP investigators 
since 2008. For a list of identified research gaps that remain to be targeted, see the 
supplementary materials. Despite the expiration of joint DoD/VA funding of a nationwide 
PTSD research consortium in 2020, the STRONG STAR Consortium has continued with 
ongoing support from about 20 current peer-reviewed, individual, investigator-initiated 
projects funded by the DoD, VA, NIH, and private funding organizations (see Supplemental 
Table 2). However, the long-term sustainment of the infrastructure needed for a nationwide 
research consortium is extremely difficult to achieve with individual investigator-initiated 
research projects. Federal infrastructure funding is urgently needed to continue to leverage 
the synergistic power of team science that has been made possible through the federal 
funding of PTSD research consortia [40].
