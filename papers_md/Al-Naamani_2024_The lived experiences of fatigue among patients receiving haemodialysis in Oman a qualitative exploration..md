Abstract
Background  Fatigue among patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving haemodialysis imposes a 
substantial burden on patients’ quality of life and expected treatment outcomes. This study explores the perspective 
on ESKD-related fatigue and contributing factors among Omani patients receiving haemodialysis.

Methods  An exploratory qualitative design was used. Participants (N = 25) were recruited from two Omani 
haemodialysis centres, and data were collected through semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed and 
analysed using a thematic analysis approach. NVivo 11 is used to manage qualitative data and create memos, nodes, 
and codes.

Results  Findings highlighted three themes: (i)“Inevitability of fatigue,” (ii)“Contributors to physical fatigue,” and 
(iii)“Contributors to mental fatigue.” Theme one alluded to the inevitability of fatigue and the unique experience 
encountered by patients. Theme two addressed the physical fatigue associated with ESKD-related factors, such as 
chronically low haemoglobin levels, and the exhausting impact caused by the frequency and travelling distance 
for treatment sessions. Theme three, mental fatigue, was notably driven by heightened emotional disturbance, 
encompassing frustration, guilt, anxiety, and distress, that in turn impacted family interactions, frequently triggering 
anger and remorse. Moreover, mental fatigue is a result of disturbances in expressing physical sexuality in marriage, as 
physical fatigue was found to be a significant contributor to unsatisfactory sexual experiences and, thus, straining the 
relationships between couples.

Conclusions  This study offers an explanation of fatigue among Omani patients with ESKD who are receiving 
haemodialysis. The study emphasises close links between physiological change, the haemodialysis process, and 
mental tiredness, together with their contribution to supporting the need for a holistic approach and care strategies 
in managing these patients and promoting patient and family well-being.

Background
End-stage  kidney  disease  (ESKD)  imposes  a  substantial 
burden  on  global  healthcare  services  and  patients’  qual-
ity  of  life.  According  to  the  National  Institute  of  Health 
2022  annual  report,  the  prevalence  of  ESKD  increased 
by  118.7%  between  2000  and  2019  [1].  Even  higher  per-
centage  was  reported  in  Arabic  countries,  including 
Oman,  where  a  significant  increase  was  mainly  attrib-
uted to diabetes and hypertension as the primary causes 
of  ESKD  [1].  In  Oman,  statistics  highlight  the  accelerat-
ing incidence of ESKD and the consequent need for renal 
replacement therapy (RRT), which stood at 21 per million 
people  (pmp)  in  1983  compared  with  160  pmp  in  2019 
[2]. In 2019, a total of 4117 patients with ESKD received 
RRT compared to 49 patients in 1983 [2].

Globally,  haemodialysis  is  the  most  common  RRT. 
Although  haemodialysis  plays  an  essential  role  in  sus-
taining  the  life  of  patients  with  ESKD,  patients  often 
experience  debilitating  symptoms  that  negatively  affect 
their  physical,  psychological,  and  social  well-being  [3, 
4].  Flythe  et  al.  (2018)  listed  the  key  symptoms  present-
ing  among  patients  receiving  haemodialysis,  including 
fatigue, muscle cramping, body aches, insomnia, anxiety, 
depression, and frustration [5]. Despite the advancement 
in  haemodialysis  technology  and  delivery  care,  poor 
symptom management, such as those identified, remains 
a health professional concern [5–7].

Fatigue  is  one  of  the  most  reported  symptoms  among 
haemodialysis  patients,  with  a  prevalence  rate  rang-
ing  from  49  to  92%  [8–10].  Fatigue,  characterised  by  an 
overarching  sense  of  physical  and  mental  exhaustion, 
significantly  impairs  patients’  ability  to  engage  in  daily 
activities, maintain social connections, and experience a 
satisfactory  quality  of  life  [11,  12].  Fatigue  was  found  to 
be  correlated  with  increased  risks  of  cardiovascular  dis-
orders  [13],  suicidal  attempts  [14],  mortality  rate  [15], 
and  adherence  to  the  haemodialysis  regimen.  Also,  it 
reduced  the  likelihood  of  kidney  transplantation  [10]. 
Despite the significant negative impact of fatigue among 
patients receiving haemodialysis, fatigue-causing mecha-
nisms,  and  its  contributing  factors  are  still  unclear  and 
poorly investigated, leading to poor management strate-
gies  and  a  negative  influence  on  patients’  quality  of  life 
and potential treatment outcomes [8, 16].

Fatigue  among  patients  receiving  haemodialysis  is  a 
complex  phenomenon  associated  with  multiple  contrib-
uting  factors  resulting  from  the  actual  kidney  disease 
process in the first instance and then the chronic haemo-
dialysis regimen [16–19]. Fatigue is associated with mul-
tiple physiological [19], psychological [20, 21], and social 
[3,  22]  contributing  factors.  For  example,  fatigue  mani-
festations are attributed to poor sleep quality [23], family 
and social responsibilities [12], and mood disorders [21, 

24], and the causes of this symptom are often ambiguous 
and confounded by cultural differences [22, 25, 26].

A  number  of  studies  have  explored  fatigue  among 
patients  receiving  haemodialysis  within  European  and 
North  American  contexts  where  culture  and  beliefs  are 
likely to influence patient perspectives and interpretation 
of symptoms and will be uniquely different to other areas 
of  the  world  [3,  27].  There  is  a  dearth  of  studies  in  the 
Arab  context  exploring  the  lived  experiences  of  fatigue 
among patients receiving haemodialysis. Oman is located 
in the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, with 
a  land  area  of  around  309,500  km  [28].  The  majority  of 
Omanis  are  Arabs  and  Muslims  who  are  proud  of  their 
heritage and culture. According to the 2022 annual health 
report of the Ministry of Health, the total population in 
Oman  is  approximately  4.9  million,  comprising  Omanis 
(59%)  and  non-Omanis  (41%).  The  Omani  population 
is  relatively  young,  with  94%  below  the  age  of  60  [28]. 
Addressing  this  gap  is  important  because  of  the  unique 
cultural,  environmental,  and  lifestyle  factors  related  to 
the Arab context. This study aims to explore the experi-
ence  of  fatigue  and  contributing  factors  among  Omani 
patients receiving haemodialysis.

Methods
Study design

An  exploratory  qualitative  research  design  was  used  to 
gain in-depth understanding of the experience of fatigue 
and  contributing  factors  among  patients  with  ESKD 
receiving  haemodialysis.  The  exploratory  qualitative 
approach  is  used  to  gain  new,  rich  insights  and  under-
standing  of  the  various  ways  in  which  a  phenomenon  is 
manifested  and  the  underlying  process  that  underpins 
it  as  presented  by  participants  [29].  This  is  particularly 
important where the topic of investigation or phenome-
non is not fully understood, and there is limited coverage 
in  the  literature  about  the  experience  of  fatigue  among 
Omani patients receiving haemodialysis [29].

Study participants

The study participants were recruited from two in-centre 
haemodialysis  in  Oman.  The  centres  run  four  haemodi-
alysis  sessions  daily:  a  morning  session  (7  am  –  11  am), 
an early afternoon session (12 noon – 4 pm), a late after-
noon session (5 pm – 9 pm), and a night-time session (10 
pm – 2 am). Participants are required to attend three in-
centre  haemodialysis  sessions  a  week  for  four  hours  per 
session.  The  scheduled  sessions  are  fixed  each  week  for 
patients by the healthcare provider according to the slot 
availability unless the change is necessary.

Eligibility  criteria  included  adult  Omani  patients  over 
18  years  old,  diagnosed  with  ESKD,  recipients  of  hae-
modialysis for at least six months, and reporting a score 
of ≥ 1 of fatigue using a Likert scale from 0; no fatigue to

consent  form  and  return  it  inside  envelopes  to  the  hae-
modialysis  centre  reception  desk  at  their  next  appoint-
ment. Participants were also given the option to contact 
the  researcher  directly  via  phone,  as  provided  on  the 
information  sheet,  for  any  clarifications.  After  collect-
ing the contact consent forms, the researcher (ZA) called 
participants  and  provided  a  detailed  explanation  about 
the study. Of 76 potential participants approached to par-
ticipate, 30 participants agreed to take part in the semi-
structured interview. Participants were then contacted by 
the main researcher (ZA), who met with them in a mutu-
ally accepted place and time.

After  obtaining  formal  consent,  the  interview  process 
began  with  an  informal  discussion  to  establish  rapport, 
create trust, and facilitate flexibility in the interview [32]. 
After  that,  the  researcher  started  first  with  the  general 
and  the  least  personal  questions  to  break  the  ice  [31]. 
Then,  the  researcher  directed  the  interview  and  asked 
more  personal  and  probing  questions  to  elicit  detailed 
information,  which  ultimately  advanced  the  research 
goals.

After  25  interviews,  no  additional  information  was 
found,  and  data  saturation  occurred  [33]. Therefore,  the 
remaining  five  interviews  were  cancelled.  All  interviews 
were held in a convenient, quiet room for 30 to 80 min. 
The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, 
and field notes were taken during interviews. Data were 
stored in a protected and encrypted computer to ensure 
data security and protect participants’ privacy.

Ethical approval

The  ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the  ethical 
committee  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  in  Oman  (MOH/
CSR/18/9002). This study is consistent with the Helsinki 
Declaration.  Participants  were  informed  that  they  could 
refuse  to  answer  questions  or  withdraw  at  any  time.  A 
protocol  was  developed  to  protect  interviewees  from 
potentially provoking emotional distress during the inter-
view. ZA, who conducted the interview, is a senior nurse 
with a lot of experience and was able to survey the par-
ticipants for any sign of stress during the interview. If any 
sign  of  stress  was  shown,  the  interview  was  stopped  till 
the  participant  relaxed  and  their  ability  to  continue  the 
interview  was  assessed,  but  if  the  participant  continued 
showing the signs of stress, the interview was terminated, 
and the participants would be referred to a psychologist 
who  was  attached  to  the  unit.  All  Omanis  are  covered 
by  health  insurance  so  that  no  expenses  would  be  paid. 
However,  the  researchers  did  not  experience  this  in  any 
case. Pseudonyms were used instead of identifying infor-
mation to maintain participants’ confidentiality.

10;  severe  fatigue.  A  period  of  6  months  on  haemodial-
ysis  was  deemed  sufficient  time  for  patients  to  adapt  to 
and cope with the treatment process of haemodialysis in 
their daily lives. This time window was selected because, 
in the first period of haemodialysis, patients experience a 
critical transition in their life and have significant physio-
logical and functional changes that potentially affect how 
they  perceive  their  fatigue  experience  [30].  Participants 
were excluded if they had a cancer diagnosis, HIV, severe 
heart failure, or depression, as these patients were likely 
to experience fatigue unrelated to haemodialysis.

Data collection

After  ethical  approval,  an  Interview  Guide  was  for-
mulated  and  piloted  in  a  different  location  with  three 
patients  receiving  in-centre  haemodialysis  to  ensure 
the  questions  were  clear  and  relevant  to  haemodialysis-
related  fatigue  (Table  1).  Price  (2002)  emphasised  using 
a  framework  and  a  sequential  questioning  system  that 
begins with the least intrusive and moves on to more in-
depth  concepts  if  the  interviewee  indicates  their  readi-
ness [31]. A minor modification related to sexual effects 
in  the  guide  was  included  to  address  cultural  aspects. 
These  patients  and  their  interviews  were  excluded  from 
the final analysis.

A flyer was posted on the notice board, and interested 
potential  participants  contacted  the  senior  nurse,  who 
has  a  copy  of  the  information  sheet,  contact  consent 
form,  and  knowledge  about  the  study  and  researchers. 
The information sheet stresses that this study is indepen-
dent  from  the  hospital  and  that  declining  participation 
will not affect the patients by any means. If patients were 
willing to participate, they were asked to fill out a contact

Data analysis

Semi-structured  transcripts  were  analysed  systemati-
cally  via  using  the  six-step  approach  to  thematic  analy-
sis, namely (1) familiarisation with the data (reading and 
re-reading), (2) generating initial codes, (3) searching for 
themes,  (4)  reviewing  themes,  (5)  defining  and  naming 
themes, (6) producing the results [34].

At the initial stage of data management, all interviews 
were transcribed verbatim, with interviews conducted in 
Arabic.  All  the  interviews  were  translated  into  English. 
WHO guidelines for translation were followed [35]. First, 
translation  to  English  was  conducted  by  a  researcher 
(ZA), who is fluent in both languages, and back transla-
tion was conducted by another fluent researcher (OO) to 
ensure the data did not lose their richness. ZA). Then, the 
translated interviews were thoroughly checked for accu-
racy by other researchers fluent in Arabic and English to 
validate  the  translated  information  (HS  &  NM).  NVivo 
11  was  used  to  manage  the  raw  data,  help  organise  the 
dataset, and create memos, free nodes, and tree nodes to 
show the relationship between the codes and themes.

Descriptive  encoding  entailed  reading  the  transcripts 
several  times  to  create  accurate  representations  of  the 
raw  data  and  to  get  a  general  sense  of  the  key  concepts 
in  the  descriptions  [36].  The  text  was  then  divided  into 
manageable meaning units. The meaning of the text was 
preserved  even  after  these  meaning  units  were  further 
reduced.  These  condensed  units  had  codes  assigned  to 
them. Codes that were comparable and related were cat-
egorised. The researcher performed additional analysis in 
each category to generate  overarching themes, interpre-
tive themes, and subthemes (Fig. 1). As a quality measure, 
an expert panel (KG, HN, and OS) conducted a compre-
hensive review of the findings to validate the authenticity 
and precision of the interpretations [37].

Miles  and  Huberman  Framework  (1994)  was  used  to 
ensure  a  systematic,  rigorous  and  transparent  process 
of  data  analysis  and  interpretation  [38].  The  framework 
includes  three  main  processes:  data  reduction,  data 
display  and  drawing  conclusions.  Data  reduction  was 
achieved by researchers (ZA, KG, HN, OS) who indepen-
dently  reviewed  data  to  capture  the  essence  of  the  data 

and identify initial emerging codes. The initial codes were 
then  displayed  and  organised  to  identify  patterns  and 
themes,  and  discrepancies  were  resolved  by  consensus 
and  mutual  understanding.  Researchers  then  engaged 
in iterative processes of discussions to draw conclusions 
and verify their interpretations by moving back and forth 
between  the  themes  and  text  to  ensure  the  validity  and 
reliability of the findings.

To further ensure the quality of the data and the rigour 
of  this  qualitative  study  and  maintain  the  trustworthi-
ness, the researcher adhered to the four criteria Lincoln 
and  Guba  proposed:  credibility,  transferability,  confirm-
ability,  and  dependability  throughout  the  study  [36]. 
These  criteria  are  considered  important  elements  in 
qualitative research to ensure the accuracy of the process 
of  data  interpretation  and  how  conclusions  are  drawn. 
Several  methods  were  used;  for  example,  all  interviews 
were  digitally  audio  recorded  and  transcribed  verbatim 
to  ensure  no  information  was  lost  and  checked  inde-
pendently  (credibility  and  transferability).  Pseudonyms 
ensured  participants’  confidentiality  and  anonymity  of 
information, and direct quotes from the interviews were 
provided to authenticate the meanings conveyed through 
various  themes  (transferability).  Interpretations  of  the 
findings were further verified for accuracy and complete-
ness by expert researchers (confirmability).

Results
Table 2 outlines the patients’ sociodemographic profiles. 
The mean age of patients was 41.32 years. The length of 
time  they  had  been  receiving  haemodialysis  treatment 
ranged  from  1  to  17  years.  Most  patients  were  married 
(68%) and employed (44%).

The qualitative thematic analysis revealed an overarch-
ing  theme,  Inevitable  and  Multifaceted:  ESKD-related 
fatigue, highlights patients’ perspectives on the meaning 
and description of fatigue and considers some of the fac-
tors which impact on fatigue severity. Generally, patients 
found it difficult to clearly describe their fatigue because 
its contributing factors were unclear.

What  to  say  about  my  fatigue?  It’s  difficult  to 
explain the feelings … (BHC: P23).

This  overarching  theme  is  further  divided  into  three

tal  fatigue  (Table  3).  Although  the  factors  contributing 
to physical and mental fatigue are discussed individually, 
these factors are strongly interrelated and as such has an 
impact on one another.

Inevitability of fatigue

Most  patients  perceived  fatigue  as  an  inevitable  experi-
ence and to be expected as a consequence of haemodialy-
sis. Insights around this theme were articulated through 
patients’  individual  descriptions  of  what  fatigue  meant 
for them, and their attempts to describe the fluctuation in 
the severity of their fatigue.

Meaning of fatigue

Patients believed fatigue to be a symptom closely related 
to  their  disease  and  treatment  and,  therefore,  to  be 
expected  and  unavoidable.  Fatigue  was  described  as  a 
constant presence that followed patients continually, and 
was described as being like a ‘virus’ in the bloodstream. 
They  described  the  impact  of  fatigue  on  their  physical 
and mental well-being and highlighted how fatigue nega-
tively impacted their everyday lives.

Doing  haemodialysis  is  exhausting  physically  and 
mentally  because  my  life  changed  totally  …  This 
fatigue is like a virus in my blood, I can’t get rid of it. 
(BHC: P20)

Some  patients  believed  that  their  fatigue  was  a  conse-
quence  of  abnormal  physiological  values  arising  from 
their  disease,  particularly  chronically  low  haemoglo-
bin  levels.  Alongside  this,  the  unavoidable  weight  gain 
caused by accumulated body fluid, was also felt to have a 
negatively impact on their well-being.

You know our haemoglobin now is below the normal 
level. … So, fatigue is always present but sometimes 
I  feel  less  tired,  and  this  is  normal  because  since  I 
started my haemodialysis treatment, my haemoglo-
bin has been between 7 and 9 [g/dl]. (BHC: P09)

Other  patients  believed  that  physical  fatigue  was  an 
inevitable  consequence  of  the  constant  and  exhausting 
treatment process and the frequent travel for these treat-
ments, in some cases this was up to three times per week.

After  my  dialysis  session  I  feel  exhausted  until  the 
next day (BHC: P13).

The physiological changes associated with haemodialysis 
increased the severity of physical fatigue and contributed 
to  patients’  inability  to  meet  their  daily  responsibilities. 
Patients often complained of feeling overwhelmed when 
they  thought  about  their  roles  and  responsibilities  at 
home; and mentally tired and challenged.

Even  if  my  physical  fatigue  is  less,  I  feel  mentally 
tired,  which  sometimes  gives  me  a  headache  … 
because I’m still young and [I] worry for my future. 

Al-Naamani et al. BMC Nephrology          (2024) 25:239 Page 6 of 12

…  [M]y  family  also  suffer  with  my  treatment  and 
the mood fluctuations that I’ve suffered from since I 
started haemodialysis. (BHC: P08)

Nature of fatigue

Patients  reported  that  the  severity  of  their  fatigue  was 
unpredictable  and  often  fluctuated  throughout  the  day, 
thereby  negatively  affecting  their  capacity  to  meet  their 
daily  needs.  Most  of  the  patients  stated  that  whenever 
haemodialysis treatment was completed, they frequently 
complained  about  post-dialysis  fatigue  (PDF),  which 
many of them seemed to accept as an inevitable experi-
ence, and which was so severe that it often limited their 
functional abilities. PDF is immediately manifested after 
haemodialysis sessions and may persist for hours due to 
fluid shifts during the cycle of haemodialysis.

I feel exhausted when I arrive home … I feel remorse 
at  not  being  able  to  do  household  tasks  and  take 
care of my husband and children. (BHC: P25)

Fatigue and fatigue severity following haemodialysis was 
described  as  unpredictable  with  various  recovery  times. 
Patients reported that sometimes they would experience 
minimal PDF, and hence required only a little rest before 
they  were  ready  to  engage  in  other  activities.  On  the 
other hand, there were times when the fatigue persisted 
for longer than a full day, as this patient explained:

Fatigue  varies  day  to  day.  Sometimes,  I  feel  fatigue 
for  24  h,  and  at  other  times,  I  just  feel  fatigued  for 
4 h, but I’m not [always] sure if I can do work. (Phase 
1: NHC: P05)

These  fluctuations  in  the  severity  of  fatigue  meant  that 
patients  described  their  fatigue  experience  in  different 
ways. When their fatigue was less severe, especially dur-
ing haemodialysis sessions, they used terms such as ‘tired’ 
or  ‘weak’  to  describe  their  feeling  of  fatigue.  However, 
when the symptom of fatigue was severe, they described 
the  fatigue  phenomenon  using  a  range  of  descriptive 
words  such  as  ‘paralysing’,  ‘lethargic’  and  ‘exhausting’. 
This distinction was underscored by their body language 
when they narrated their severe fatigue experience. They 
looked  sad  and  despondent  when  describing  severe 
fatigue,  and  conceptualised  it  as  an  unavoidable  feeling 
that they were left to face alone, because healthcare pro-
viders  (HCPs)  rarely  discussed  fatigue  with  them  after 
haemodialysis sessions,

expression).  The  feeling  can’t  be  described  …  (spo-
ken with a sad tone) … Nurses never ask about [my] 
fatigue,  [except]  only  when  I  experienced  recurrent 
low blood pressure during haemodialysis …. (NHC: 
P02)

Some patients described themselves as ‘fatigued persons’, 
having  surrendered  or  accepted  fatigue  as  an  inevita-
ble  part  of  their  haemodialysis  day.  Sadly,  due  to  severe 
fatigue,  some  patients  had  become  accustomed  to  sim-
ply excluding the haemodialysis day from their planning 
for the week, knowing full well that these days would be 
“wasted” anyway.

Fatigue is always present, especially after my dialy-
sis sessions … That is why I don’t count the dialysis 
day as part of my week. (BHC: P13)

Contributors to physical fatigue
Negative physiological changes

Patients  were  aware  that  physiological  changes  contrib-
uted  to  their  physical  fatigue.  Fatigue  was  viewed  as  a 
consequence of electrolyte disturbance, especially potas-
sium level.

When  my  potassium  level  is  high,  my  heart  rate 
increases, and I can feel it. I feel very tired and I’m 
afraid my heart will stop … (BHC: P25).

High  levels  of  phosphorus  in  the  blood  caused  contin-
ued  and  intolerable  itching,  especially  in  summer  with 
heightened  temperature.  Patients  associated  symptoms 
of irritation, pain and physical discomfort to their feeling 
of  fatigue,  particularly  when  performing  daily  activities. 
Some patients also complained of sudden muscle cramps, 
especially at night. They highlighted as negatively impact-
ing  sleep  quality,  often  leaving  them  further  exhausted 
the next day, as these participants narrated:

If I’m exposed to sunlight especially during summer, 
I  get  itching  and  sometimes  muscle  cramps.  I  can’t 
sleep  peacefully  at  night  because  of  scratching  or 
sudden muscle cramps that cause severe pain (shows 
grimaced face). Next morning, I feel very tired when 
doing my work … (NHC: P04).

A  number  of  patients  also  linked  their  energy  levels  to 
their haemoglobin levels, they believed that their energy 
levels dropped in parallel with their haemoglobin levels.

I feel my whole body is paralysed and exhausted, like 
I’ve a mountain on my back and pain in my joints. 
I  can’t  walk  or  do  anything  (pauses  with  a  blank 

If my haemoglobin level drops below 8, I can’t do my 
work, even simple tasks. I feel lethargic, sleepy, and I 
just stay at home … (BHC: P01).

Al-Naamani et al. BMC Nephrology          (2024) 25:239 Page 7 of 12

The  issue  was  of  particular  concern  for  female  patients, 
who indicated that their menstrual periods caused a fur-
ther drop in their haemoglobin levels, resulting in further 
increase in the severity of their fatigue:

I  think  the  cause  of  my  fatigue  is  low  haemoglo-
bin  level  …  when  I  get  bleeding,  it  [my  haemoglo-
bin] drops to 5 and I feel more tired and cannot do 
anything  at  all,  and  you  know  this  thing  is  not  in 
our  hands  as  we  get  it  [menstrual  period]  monthly. 
(BHC: P07)

Furthermore,  some  patients  linked  increased  physical 
fatigue levels to the extra fluid that accumulates between 
haemodialysis sessions. This association between fatigue 
and  weight  gain  became  apparent,  especially  on  Fridays 
when dialysis centres were officially closed for the week-
end.  This  means  that  patients  often  have  to  endure  two 
consecutive  days  without  haemodialysis.  During  this 
time, there was also a tendency to consume more fluids 
because  of  social  activities  and  family  gatherings,  which 
exacerbated  weight  gain  and  further  increased  their 
physical fatigue.

You know, during the weekend, I eat and drink more 
because of family gatherings and activities we have. 
Sometimes  I  gain  more  weight,  approximately  5  to 
6  kg.  This  really  makes  me  feel  more  tired.  (BHC: 
P05)

Nature of haemodialysis procedure

Many  patients  observed  that  when  they  attended  hae-
modialysis  sessions,  the  healthcare  providers’  efforts  to 
remove  accumulated  fluid  often  aggravated  their  post-
dialysis fatigue and increased their risk of developing side 
effects  such  as  hypotension  and  electrolyte  imbalances, 
which  in  turn  further  extended  their  recovery  periods. 
This  feeling  of  immense  fatigue  was  especially  pres-
ent  when  the  healthcare  providers  attempted  to  remove 
more fluid than the patients could otherwise tolerate,

[I]f  they  [HCPs]  remove  more  fluid  than  my  body 
can tolerate, my blood pressure drops and I feel nau-
seated, drowsy and very weak. (NHC: P01)

Some  patients  also  believed  that  the  pump  (dialysis 
flow  rate)  used  to  maintain  circulating  blood  flow  while 
removing  accumulated  body  fluid  was  sometimes  set  at 
an intolerably high level (of up to 400 ml/min).

home I was very exhausted… till they adjusted it to 
300 and I feel somewhat better. (BHC: P13)

In  addition  to  fatigue,  patients  experienced  other  recur-
rent  unpleasant  symptoms  during  the  haemodialysis 
sessions,  the  most  common  being  hypotension.  These 
unpleasant  symptoms,  when  they  occur,  aggravate  the 
severity of fatigue and the recovery time.

[I]f  they  continually  kept  the  speed  on  the  higher 
side for a long period of time, I could develop heart 
problems later on as my blood vessels would become 
weaker, and I would be more at risk of [developing] 
hypotension … (BHC: P23).

Night-time haemodialysis sessions

Unfavorable  timing  of  haemodialysis  sessions,  partic-
ularly  at  night  (10  pm  –  2  am)  was  offered  as  a  reason 
for  additional  or  exacerbated  fatigue.  This  caused  fur-
ther  concern  to  some  patients  who  commented  that 
night-time haemodialysis sessions resulted in even more 
debilitating fatigue due to what they argued as a combi-
nation of post-dialysis fatigue and insufficient night sleep. 
This  in  turn  was  further  worsened  by  the  need  of  some 
patients to drive back home by themselves,

… I stop at least twice to rest and take a nap because 
I  feel  very  tired  and  sleepy,  especially  during  night 
sessions … It’s not good to drive in this condition but 
I don’t have a choice. (BHC: P08)

Many patients reported that the severe fatigue following 
night-time  haemodialysis  sessions  predisposing  them  to 
road traffic accidents.

I  felt  more  exhausted  when  I  did  night  sessions 
because I was not getting enough sleep at night, and 
I had to drive home at 3:30 am… I fell asleep twice 
while driving and had an accident. (NHC: P05)

Contributors to mental fatigue
Heightened  emotional  disturbances  Many  patients 
said  the  burden  of  fatigue  was  provoked  by  a  variety  of 
emotions,  including  frustration,  guilt,  anxiety,  and  dis-
tress. Many felt they could neither spend enough quality 
time with their families nor fulfill their needs due to the 
unpredictable nature and severity of fatigue.

… the nurse used to keep the pump speed at 400 [ml/
min],  and  I  lost  consciousness  many  times  and  at 

I feel psychologically exhausted, as I can’t handle my 
fatigue  and  home  responsibilities  as  a  mother,  …  I

feel  guilty  if  they  come  back  and  their  lunch  is  not 
ready, … (BHC: P25).

fore,  I  don’t  feel  interested  in  going  out  anymore. 
(BHC: P15)

fatigue 

increased 
Some  reported  that  post-dialysis 
their  frustration  and  anger,  especially  when  subjected 
to  noise,  or  when  they  were  too  exhausted  to  function 
after haemodialysis sessions. Often, frustration impacted 
negatively  on  their  behaviour  and  resulted  in  inappro-
priate  reactions,  such  as  verbal  abuse  toward  others. 
Patients  felt  judged  by  these  emotional  outbursts  and 
were  sometimes  criticised  for  being  angry  unnecessar-
ily.  Participants  reported  that  their  emotions  disrupted 
them  psychologically,  and  they  often  felt  huge  remorse 
for  angry  outbursts,  especially  towards  close  family 
members,

“After  dialysis  sessions  I  can’t  control  my  temper. 
Imagine, I become annoyed with simple things, and 
I react in a bad way, like throwing things. … (BHC: 
P13).
Sometimes, I shouted, and no one could tolerate my 
temper. Believe me, I used to be calm and rarely got 
angry  but  now  even  my  husband  has  told  me  my 
behaviour has changed … (BHC: P18)”.

Anxiety  was  frequently  experienced  by  the  patients  in 
this  study.  Causes  were  related  to  a  lack  of  consistency 
in  the  haemodialysis  services  as  well  as  a  lack  of  essen-
tial  clinical  staff  and  other  resources.  This  caused  over-
whelming thoughts as they were unsure about the quality 
of care provided and the impact on fatigue management.

She  [the  dietician]  comes  only  during  morning  and 
early  afternoon  sessions,  and  she  sees  only  patients 
who have abnormal blood results. There is no dieti-
cian in the remaining sessions and there were fewer 
services when I did late evening sessions. (BHC: P18)

Patients  experienced  a  sense  of  isolation,  loneliness, 
and  worry  associated  with  the  inability  to  be  involved 
in  social  activities.  Most  patients  often  felt  socially  iso-
lated.  They  explained  that  post-dialysis  fatigue  reduced 
their interest in social interaction and demotivated them 
because they were uncertain of their moods and capabili-
ties. They were ashamed to be seen as ‘a weak person’ and 
unable to spend enough quality of time with their fami-
lies and friends

I seldom join my family or friends for trips or special 
occasions, and I prefer to stay home because I’m not 
sure about my energy, which might ruin the trip. … I 
also used to go out for shopping with my sisters and 
sometimes I felt exhausted after the shopping. There-

Financial  insecurity,  especially  among  those  who  were 
employed,  also  caused  huge  concern.  The  most  crucial 
source  of  worry  was  the  possibility  of  losing  a  job  or 
missing out on promotion, thus affecting future income.

…  When  I  started  haemodialysis,  and  because  I 
can’t  function  as  before,  the  company  forced  me  to 
retire from work. It is not easy to survive, and I keep 
thinking how I can provide a better life for my family 
(sad expression). (NHC: P06)

Disturbances in sexuality and marriage  Fatigue led to 
a reduction in physical sexual contact between partners. 
Many patients had lost interest in intimacy and the desire 
to  engage  in  sexual  relations  with  their  partners,  which 
they  argued  was  a  consequence  of  continued  fatigue. 
Some  reported  that  they  engaged  in  sexual  intercourse 
just to satisfy their partners. This poor sexual experience 
negatively  affected  some  relationships.  Patients  worried 
about the feelings of their partners, whether expressed or 
not,  and  were  aware  that  unsatisfactory  sexual  relation-
ships were “hot spots” in influencing their married life.

.  ...Sometimes,  I  can’t  tolerate  it  [Sexual  relation-
ship]  and  don’t  finish  because  I  feel  exhausted  and 
have no stamina. I sometimes fake my feelings dur-
ing the relationship to satisfy my wife (said with sad 
expression). (NHC: P06)

In addition to physical fatigue, poor sexual performance 
in  males  was  also  attributed  to  erectile  dysfunction, 
which  often  caused  severe  anguish,  with  many  suffer-
ing in silence about their sexual inability. However, while 
many suffered in silence, others sought alternatives to aid 
their sexual performance, as this participant explained:

I  get  weak  erections,  and  sometimes  I  use  Viagra 
tablets  to  enjoy  [the  sexual  relationship]  more. 
(NHC: P06)

Patients were also concerned about their weight gain and 
fistulas, which they perceived as making them less attrac-
tive to their partners. They also expressed concern about 
damaging the fistula site during sexual intercourse, con-
cerns which they reported their partners also shared,

My  performance  during  [sexual]  relations  became 
less  [frequent].  I  feel  heavy  and  [I]  become  tired  … 
we  [the  participant  and  her  husband]  are  also  too 
concerned  about  the  fistula,  we  might  unintention-

Al-Naamani et al. BMC Nephrology          (2024) 25:239 Page 9 of 12

ally  damage  it  …  during  that  moment  [of  sexual 
intimacy]. (BHC: P18)

Unmarried  patients  expressed  anxiety  about  finding  a 
husband or wife. Their greatest worry was whether they 
would ever find someone who would accept their current 
situation,  including  their  limitations.  Some  felt  hopeless 
about the possibility of having a life partner:

I don’t know if I will be able to get married. Kidney 
failure and dialysis treatment is like an imprint on 
my  life.  Honestly,  I’m  losing  hope  in  getting  a  wife 
because no one will accept a person [who is] sick and 
retired from work. (BHC: P08)

Patients  who  experienced  previous  rejections  lamented 
that they were left psychologically broken, unsure if they 
should continue to seek a spouse.

.  I’m  turning  43  years  [old].  I’m  still  not  married, 
and it’s really difficult not being able to fulfil my life 
and have my own family. (BHC: P24)

Some married younger adults expressed worries regard-
ing their fertility and the possibility of failing to have chil-
dren of their own.

…  My  husband  suffers  sometimes,  and  I  feel  guilty 
because we’ve no children yet. I know he wants to be 
a father but what I can do? (Participant cries as she 
narrates her ordeal. (BHC: P20).

When  asked  how  they  dealt  with  difficulties  related  to 
sexual health, many patients reported being unsure about 
how to deal with such problems. Some were too shy and 
embarrassed to ask for professional support,

I  feel  too  shy  and  embarrassed  to  tell  the  doctor 
because  it  [sexual  concerns]  is  a  sensitive  topic. 
(BHC: P09)

Discussion
Effective  fatigue  management  requires  a  clear  under-
standing  of  the  symptoms  experienced  in  relation  to 
the  affected  person’s  perception  and  evaluation  of  and 
response  to  fatigue.  Notable  findings  in  this  study  show 
that  patients  found  it  difficult  to  clearly  describe  their 
fatigue  and  its  causes  because  of  incidences  of  intrusive 
and often lingering physical and mental contributing fac-
tors. In fact, patients often evaluate what aggravates the 
severity  of  their  physical  and  mental  fatigue  instead  of 
its  causes,  which  might  link  to  the  patient’s  perception 
of  the  inevitability  of  fatigue.  The  finding  that  fatigue  is 

present  and  persistent  aligns  with  published  literature 
[12, 39, 40]. For example, in a study conducted in the UK, 
haemodialysis patients reported that ‘fatigue is persisting 
despite rest’ [10]. Similarly, in Taiwan, patients described 
their  experience  as  a  ‘fight  against  fatigue  all  the  time’ 
[41],  while  patients  in  Iran  perceived  fatigue  as  ‘a  bad 
feeling’  that  persisted,  leading  to  endless  physical  and 
mental  burnout  [42].  In  this  study,  too,  haemodialysis 
patients  often  experienced  ongoing  physical  and  mental 
fatigue. Moreover, the severity of their fatigue symptoms 
worsened and became unpredictable after their haemodi-
alysis sessions, leaving patients unable to organise or plan 
required daily activities [22, 42]. As a result, remarkable 
findings  from  this  study  where  patients  did  not  count 
dialysis  days  as  part  of  their  weekly  plan  due  to  unpre-
dictable fatigue.

In  terms  of  fatigue-causative  factors,  similar  to  other 
international  findings  [8,  22,  41],  this  study  found  that 
patients attributed physical fatigue to kidney disease and 
the  exhausting  haemodialysis  treatment  process.  You  et 
al.  (2022)  conducted  a  systematic  review  to  investigate 
fatigue  and  its  related  factors  among  patients  receiv-
ing  haemodialysis.  The  authors  found  26  potential  risk 
factors  associated  with  ESKD  and  the  haemodialysis 
process,  including  electrolyte  imbalance,  low  haemodi-
alysis  levels,  and  extra  fluid  that  accumulates  between 
haemodialysis sessions [8]. However, this study adds fur-
ther  perspectives  about  physical  fatigue-related  factors, 
including  (1)  female  participants  associated  menstrual 
periods  with  the  severity  of  fatigue,  and  (2)  night-time 
haemodialysis  sessions  resulted  in  more  debilitating 
fatigue due to insufficient night sleep. Therefore, expand-
ing  the  bed  capacity  of  the  haemodialysis  centres  and 
eliminating  night-time  sessions  has  been  recommended 
by patients to help mitigate their fatigue.

Mental  fatigue  was  linked  to  role  identity  in  specific 
cultural  contexts,  such  as  family  gatherings  and  attend-
ing  social  events,  as  well  as  the  specific  gender  roles  in 
the  family  in  fulfilling  daily  life.  As  observed  in  these 
studies,  Lee  et  al.  (2007)  and  Rezaie  et  al.  (2020),  for 
example,  found  that  patients  attributed  emotional  and 
psychological  reactions  to  mental  fatigue  [41,  42].  Deal-
ing with constant heightened emotions drained patients’ 
energy levels and negatively affected their behaviours and 
family  relationships.  Research  also  found  that  negative 
emotions such as lack of anger control, negative moods, 
and  aggression  were  all  associated  with  low  tolerance 
thresholds that affect the severity of fatigue [3, 21]. Most 
patients,  therefore,  tend  to  exhibit  some  form  of  behav-
iour that indicates helplessness and the intention to avoid 
overwhelming emotions, such as avoiding social interac-
tion, self-isolation, and limiting their social activities.

In  this  study,  both  male  and  female  patients  reported 
lowered sexual satisfaction with their spouse and reduced 

Al-Naamani et al. BMC Nephrology          (2024) 25:239 sexual  activity  and  interest.  All  these  factors  lowered 
their  self-esteem  and  increased  their  levels  of  frustra-
tion  with  themselves  as  well  as  their  partner,  leading  to 
psychological  distress.  Jacobson  et  al.  (2019)  reported 
that  haemodialysis  patients  lacked  the  stamina  for  sex-
ual  intimacy  because  fatigue  inhibited  sexual  relations. 
Sexual activity drained their energy, which reduced their 
desire  for  sex,  leading  to  a  constant  feeling  of  guilt  over 
their  failure  to  meet  their  partner’s  sexual  expectations. 
Female participants also tended to harbour the fear that 
their persistent fatigue would lead their partners to have 
extramarital affairs, predisposing them to mental distress 
[3].

The  present  findings  move  beyond  these  observations 
to  offer  insights  from  a  transcultural  diversity  perspec-
tive.  In  Islam,  major  decisions  are  often  patriarchal, 
which means that males have the authority to make deci-
sions  pertaining  to  divorce  and  marriage.  Data  revealed 
that the female participants were fearful that their spouse 
might  leave  them  or  take  another  wife  because  of  their 
inability  to  satisfy  their  partner’s  sexual  needs,  to  con-
ceive  and  give  birth  due  to  unceasing  fatigue.  Unmar-
ried  patients  in  the  present  study  also  reported  mental 
fatigue arising from the fear of missing out on marriage 
and remaining single for life, of being rejected upon dis-
closing their illness, as well as feelings of unattractiveness 
following haemodialysis. This unmet need to get married 
had negatively affected patients’ identity and confidence. 
These findings concur with those of Stewart (2013), who 
argued  that  sexual  concerns  might  negatively  influence 
coping  strategies  among  patients  receiving  haemodi-
alysis.  The  author  suggested  that  sexual  problems  could 
be  further  evaluated  if  one  understood  how  patients 
perceived  identity  and  potential  family  and  social-cul-
tural  factors  [43].  Gender  and  physiological  differences 
between men and women could be explained by cultural 
and  environmental  factors  which  modify  patients’  expe-
rience  and  interpretation  of  their  fatigue.  As  a  remedy, 
sexual  education  for  haemodialysis  patients  and  their 
partners  is  a  vital  aspect  of  managing  sexually-related 
concerns  [44].  Additionally,  nephrology  staff  need  an 
educational and  training program to enhance  their con-
fidence in initiating discussions around sex-related prob-
lems among their patients [45].

Fatigue  also  had  an  impact  on  patients’  identity  and 
self-esteem,  especially  when  it  came  to  expected  gen-
der  roles.  Gender  roles  are  the  socio-cultural  expecta-
tions  that  encompass  norms,  behaviours,  and  actions  of 
an individual based purely on them being male or female 
[46,  47].  In  some  cultures,  gender  roles  and  behaviours 
are  well-defined:  men  are  expected  to  take  care  of  their 
families  financially,  whereas  the  primary  role  of  women 
is  to  rear  children  and  take  care  of  their  families  [48]. 
In  this  present  study,  patients  felt  that  fatigue  rendered 

Page 10 of 12

them incapable of fulfilling their gender role responsibili-
ties.  Similarly,  Horigan  et  al.  (2013),  found  that  patients 
felt  guilty  because  they  were  unable  to  meet  their  role 
responsibilities,  had  less  confidence  in  their  ability  to 
care for their children, and felt themselves to be a burden 
on their family. The loss of their identity and self-esteem 
caused  patients  to  experience  additional  psychological 
distress.  Similar  findings  were  reported  in  a  systematic 
review [3] in which fatigue was found to erode patients’ 
identity and self-esteem.

Thus,  the  overlapping  of  these  factors  contributed  to 
a  state  of  confusion  leading  patients  to  describe  their 
fatigue  in  relation  to  their  physical,  psychosocial,  and 
behavioural  problems.  Identifying  the  causes  of  fatigue 
in such multi-dimensional environments, with social and 
cultural influences at play, can be challenging. It is there-
fore  suggested  that  HCPs  should  independently  assess 
the contributing factors of physical and mental fatigue to 
help  patients  gain  a  better  understanding  of  fatigue  and 
differentiate the various causative factors of their fatigue 
to manage it more effectively.

Strength and limitation

The strengths of this study include a relatively large sam-
ple size and a well-defined population that provided valu-
able  insights  related  to  fatigue  from  their  perspectives. 
There  are  also  some  limitations,  including  the  timing  of 
data  collection;  some  patients  were  interviewed  during 
dialysis sessions, which may have influenced the depth of 
the data obtained and may have hindered patients’ free-
dom  to  express  themselves.  Translation  of  some  infor-
mation  from  Arabic  to  English  may  have  hindered  data 
interpretation.  Generalisation  of  the  findings  may  be 
limited due to differences in the cultural background and 
haemodialysis services across countries.

Implication for nursing education, practice, and research

Fatigue  among  patients  receiving  haemodialysis  is  a 
complex  phenomenon  and  associated  with  physical  and 
mental  contributing  factors.  Thus,  healthcare  providers 
should  assess  and  manage  patients  beyond  traditional 
haemodialysis  treatment  and  carry  out  regular  holis-
tic  assessment  to  detect  contributing  factors  impacting 
physical,  psychosexual,  and  emotional  fatigue.  There  is 
a  need  for  formal  and  specific  context-based  guidelines 
to  assess  and  manage  fatigue  within  haemodialysis  cen-
tres.  Additionally,  specialist  educational  and  training 
programs for assessing and managing the complex symp-
toms  associated  with  ESKD  should  be  offered  to  HCPs. 
Further exploration of patient-initiated strategies to man-
age their fatigue is required, which may provide insights 
into potential fatigue-specific interventions.

Al-Naamani et al. BMC Nephrology          (2024) 25:239 Conclusion
Fatigue perspectives among patients receiving haemodi-
alysis are not well recognised [13] and obtaining in-depth 
knowledge  of  the  complex  nature  of  the  multi-contrib-
uting  factors  of  fatigue  is  essential.  Understanding  the 
meaning  of  fatigue  and  physical  and  psychological  con-
tributing factors may facilitate early assessment and bet-
ter management. Therefore, healthcare providers need to 
be knowledgeable and aware of these factors to be able to 
recognise fatigue and offer appropriate care.
