Abstract
Conversion disorders (CD) are changes in sensorimotor activity experienced by an individual due to an
external event. Patients may experience "pseudoseizures" accompanied by the presence or absence of loss of
consciousness. Disorders of movement and sensation is the term used to classify the various kinds of CDs in
the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic manual, and they are the
rarest among all dissociative disorders. We will discuss two instances that are particularly rare. The first
includes an older couple, starting with the wife, who had nervousness, heightened worry, intrusive thoughts,
heavy perspiration, palpitations, headaches, and problems sleeping. She was prescribed 10 mg once-daily
escitalopram. She stopped taking her medication and had facial and hand problems. The patient's 65-year-
old husband started having strange hand and face movements and lost consciousness. The pair was
hospitalized willingly and had radiographic (MRI and non-contrast computerized tomography {NCCT} head),
nerve conduction, and neurological tests to rule out a movement issue. No inquiry or inspections uncovered
anything unusual. The second case involves a mother and her 13-year-old son, who was taken to a
psychiatric unit after urinating on a religious shrine. His mother had the same issue and couldn't urinate for
days. Both patients were given 25 mg of paroxetine and benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleeplessness. After
a week of medicine and psychotherapy after identifying stressors, both cases improved.

Introduction
True conversion disorder is uncommon, affecting between two and 22 people per 100,000 people annually
[1]. It may be more prevalent among military personnel, rural residents, and people with a lower
socioeconomic status. It is unknown how frequently it affects men and women, although the disease is more
common among adolescents than it is among children [2,3]. One or more conversion disorder symptoms
impair conscious motor or sensory function, indicating a neurological or other physiological disorder.
Nonetheless, these symptoms are inconsistent with known neurological or musculoskeletal disorders [4].
Individuals with conversion disorders (CD) do not intentionally develop or imitate their symptoms. Instead,
the symptoms are caused by an unconscious psychological conflict or desire. Symptoms are frequently
exacerbated by social interference from family and friends or by emotional stress avoidance. One or more
limbs becoming paralyzed, ataxia, tremors, tics, and dystonia are only a few of the conversion disease's
debilitating symptoms [5]. Functional gait disorder, hysterical paralysis, psychosomatic disorder, conversion
response, and persistent neurosis are additional labels for this syndrome [6]. There may be primary and
secondary gains that function as sustaining factors. CDs continue to be poorly understood and difficult to
diagnose despite their well-documented history. It is frequently misdiagnosed as other neurological and
psychiatric disorders, creating diagnostic difficulties for physicians. Identification of these patients
immediately is crucial [7].

Case Presentation
Case 1: a shared dissociative disorder between elderly married couple

We present a case of a 61-year-old female who came to the outpatient department (OPD) of the psychiatry
unit, at a tertiary care hospital, with a chief complaint of apprehension, increased worries and thoughts,
excessive sweating, and palpitations. In addition, she also had somatic complaints like frequent headaches,
aches, pain all over the body, and decreased sleep for the past seven months. On the integration of the
patient's symptoms, we diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) according to the

International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) classification. As a result, she was started
on escitalopram 10 mg once a day, along with benzodiazepines. On the follow-up appointment, the patient's
condition improved significantly after one month of straight medication.

Two months later, she discontinued her medication and had a significant psychosocial stressor during this
duration. She again presented to psychiatric OPD with a chief complaint of abnormal body movement in her
hands and face. She also had a few episodes of unconsciousness, not associated with abnormal body
movement, up-rolling eyeballs, or tongue bites. No urinary or fecal incontinence was documented.
Moreover, after a few days, her husband, a 65-year-old elderly male, started complaining of abnormal body
movement in his hands and face and episodes of loss of consciousness. Voluntary admission of both patients
was made. Subsequently, we performed various routine and radiological investigations (MRI, non-contrast
computerized tomography {NCCT} head), nerve conduction study (NCS), and a complete neurological
examination to rule out any underlying neurological movement disorder. However, all investigations and
assessments were unremarkable. Upon integrating their signs and symptoms, we concluded the diagnosis of
dissociative disorders of movement and sensation according to ICD-10. For both patients, we started the
appropriate pharmacotherapy, which consisted of paroxetine controlled-release tablets 25 mg once a day,
and benzodiazepine for anxiety and sleep disturbance management. After one week of treatment, we
identified multiple stressors and prescribed short-term psychotherapy. Both patients responded well to
treatment and showed similar alleviation of symptoms.

Case 2: a shared dissociative disorder between mother and adolescent
son

We present the case of a 13-year-old child who was referred to a psychiatric unit from a tertiary care hospital
pediatric unit. He presented to the pediatric team with lower limb weakness associated with pain for 10 days.
In addition, he was unable to walk on his foot. Instead, he was sliding in a peculiar gait (squatting position)
for two days. Owing to this, he was treated symptomatically by the pediatric unit; however, he did not
respond to the treatment given hence he was referred to a psychiatric unit. He underwent routine
radiological and nerve conduction studies in the pediatric unit to exclude any organic neurological causes.
Subsequently, all the investigations came up with normal results.

His mental status examination and psychological assessment were done in the psychiatric unit. After further
history exploration, it was found that his 35-year-old mother had the same complaint of lower limb
weakness associated with pain and sliding in a squatting position. So, his mother was also called for an
assessment in the psychiatry OPD to understand the case better. On further exploration of history, we
learned that the boy urinated at a shrine a few days back and complained of pain in his lower limbs. The
mother correlated the event that since the boy had urinated at the shrine, he developed pain. She went to the
shrine along with her child and performed some rituals so that the departed soul might forgive her child. The
boy continued to experience pain, following which his mother started to experience lower limb weakness
associated with severe diffused lower limb pain and abnormal gait. In addition, she did not void urine for
one day. She would think that all her symptoms are due to the abovementioned event. Moreover, on physical
examination of the mother, bulging in the lower abdomen was identified because she could withhold urine
for long time.

After combining clinical signs and symptoms, both mother and son were diagnosed with dissociative
disorders of movement and sensation according to ICD-10. Additionally, the mother had anxiety symptoms
like palpitations, sweating, and dizziness with decreased sleep. Subsequently, both mother and child were
voluntarily admitted to the unit, and the mother was started on paroxetine 25 mg once a day, accompanied
by benzodiazepines for anxiety symptoms. The child was not begun on any pharmacotherapy,
instead relaxation techniques and psychotherapy were initiated. After 10 days of therapeutic intervention,
patients were given family-focused cognitive behavior therapy. Both patients responded well to the
treatment and were discharged and followed up.

Discussion
Previously, CD and dissociative disorders, such as "functional" or "psychogenic" amnesia, dissociative
identity disorder (DID), fugue, and depersonalization disorder, were classified as forms of hysteria. In
industrialized nations, 2.4% of the population suffers from dissociative disorders characterized by a
disruption of normally integrated functions. It is believed that traumatic events, intolerable stressors, or
dysfunctional relationships cause psychogenic dissociative disorders [8]. As a result, assumptions can be
made regarding how the individual copes with their insoluble distress.

In addition to the essential diagnostic indicators, patients with DID typically exhibit additional symptoms
[9]. Typically, dissociative states resolve within weeks or months, especially if triggered by a traumatic event.
If they are associated with intolerable problems or interpersonal issues, chronic conditions such as paralysis
and anesthesia may develop (sometimes more slowly). People with dissociative disorders frequently deny
the existence of problems or difficulties that may be apparent to others. Consequently, the patient may
present as having a physical disorder despite the fact that no physical disorder can be identified as the cause
of the symptoms.

Furthermore, an evaluation of the patient's mental state and social situation typically indicates that the
disabled state aids the patient in avoiding unpleasant conflicts and expressing dependence or resentment. In
addition to a central, constant, and involuntary loss of movement or sensation, a small amount of
attention-seeking behavior may also be present. Some patients exhibit symptoms that are strongly
associated with psychological stress, whereas others do not. Personal relationship and personality
abnormalities are typically present, and close relatives and friends may have experienced similar physical
illnesses. Mild and transient forms of these disorders are prevalent during adolescence, particularly among
girls, whereas chronic forms are prevalent among young adults. Some elderly individuals who consistently
respond to stress, in the same way, may still have these disorders [10].

In all cultural contexts, dissociation and coping mechanisms are prevalent [11]. Studies from Turkey,
Scandinavia, Canada, Australia, the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom suggest that dissociative
and cognitive dysfunctions may share similar brain dysfunctional processes [12]. The orbitofrontal cortex,
thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex are all associated with CD
[13]. The right cerebellum, right orbitofrontal cortex, left putamen, and left thalamus were all implicated in
a functional MRI (fMRI) investigation of hypnotically induced paralysis, and hypnotizable people show
substantial functional connections between their dorsolateral and frontal prefrontal cortex [14,15].

Conclusions
The cases described here are uncommon presentations of dissociative disorders of movement and sensation
in which the patients exhibited identical symptoms. The cases are unique in that they are observed at
extreme ages. In the first case, a 55-year-old woman shared her symptoms with her 61-year-old husband; in
the second case, a 35-year-old mother and her 13-year-old child had identical symptoms. In our cases, the
symptoms of dissociative disorders are frequently very similar in close relationships. The most intriguing
aspect of both cases is that the patient's symptoms began diminishing simultaneously and in a similar
manner. Both patients in the first case received pharmacotherapy in addition to psychotherapy, whereas the
child in the second case was managed solely through psychotherapy.

CD, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, is a complex illness characterized by
symptoms that manifest in both physical and mental health conditions. It can also be exacerbated by the
social environment of the patient. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the need for unnecessary tests
and treatments. Before making this diagnosis, a comprehensive medical evaluation is required to ensure
that no underlying medical condition is overlooked. Early detection of potential CD would facilitate referral
to the appropriate specialist, as many individuals with conversion symptoms initially seek treatment in
primary care settings. In addition to patient interviews and medical evaluations, psychological and
neuropsychological assessments can be valuable tools (for example, physical examinations, neuroimaging,
and laboratory tests). Early CD detection enables early CD treatment, delaying the onset of symptoms as
much as possible.
