Abstract

Long- term health conditions, whether mental or physical, often co- occur in adoles-

cents. For instance, adolescents with chronic pain may experience co- occurring pri-

mary psychological disorders. In this scoping review, we determine the influence of 

co- occurring chronic pain and primary psychological disorders on adolescents' func-

tioning.  A  systematic  search  of  six  databases  was  conducted  to  identify  articles  if 

they were: (1) peer- reviewed; (2) reported original findings; (3) included participants 

aged 11– 19 years, who experienced chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting 3 months or more) 

and had a co- occurring diagnosis of a primary psychological disorder; and (4) assessed 

functioning. Searches returned 9864 articles after the removal of duplicates. A two- 

phase abstract and full- text screening process identified two eligible articles which 

compared emotional functioning (n = 1) and social functioning (n = 2) between groups 
of  adolescents  with  co- occurring  chronic  pain  and  primary  psychological  disorders 

with adolescents only reporting chronic pain. Overall findings revealed no differences 

in social functioning,  but  adolescents  with  co- occurring  chronic  pain  and a  primary 

psychological disorder (depression and anxiety) reported worse emotional functioning 

compared with adolescents with chronic pain alone. This review confirms the limited 

research on the co- occurrence of primary psychological disorders and chronic pain in 

adolescents  by  only  identifying  two  eligible  articles  exploring  the  co- occurrence  of 

chronic pain with depression, anxiety, and/or attentional disorders.

Furthermore,  for  adolescents  who  experience  chronic  pain,  the

articles recorded.

3.1  |  Stage 5: Collating, summarizing, and reporting 
the results

Two  articles  were  included  in  this  review  and  comprised  partici-
pants  from  Taiwan,  Wang  et  al.34  and  the  USA,  Kashikar- Zuck 
et  al.35  Across  the  articles,  the  number  of  participants  with 

co- occurring  pain  and  primary  psychological  disorders  was  re-

corded as n = 121, recruited from a community sample, mean age 
13.9 years and were predominantly female 74.4% (Wang et al.) and 

n = 102,  recruited  from  a  specialist  pain  center,  mean  age  14.96 
and were also predominantly female 87.3% (Kashikar- Zuck et al.). 

Both  articles  adopted  a  quantitative  approach  and  incorporated 

a  cross- sectional  design  using  self- report  assessment  surveys 

allow  for  a  rigorous  assessment  of  published  articles  irrespective 

and  an  additional  diagnostic  psychiatric  interview,  following  the 

of their methodology (see Appendix S1 for full criteria and results) 

and frequently used to record the quality of published papers in re-
views.32,33  Although  a  quality  assessment  is  outside  of  the  Arksey 
and O'Malley27 methodological framework used for this scoping re-

view, the appraisal of quality provided a robust method to allow the 

Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (4th  ed.; 
DSM- IV36). A descriptive summary of the included articles can be 

seen in Table 3.

With respect to the overall research question, of identifying the 
nature of adolescent functioning, Wang et al.34 focussed on exam-

direct comparison across articles. Articles were ranked by individual 

ining  the  prevalence  of  primary  psychological  disorders,  in  partic-

grading between 1 (low quality) and 3 (high quality) on rating criteria 

of 9, 11, and 16, respectively. The quality assessment was indepen-

for  the  age  group  7– 17 years,  and  the  K- SADS- PL  is  a  validated 

measure for the age group 7– 17 years. In addition to the adolescent 

measures, parents provided a report of adolescent pain history, and 

school attendance was recorded via both parent report and school 

report  in  the  Kashikar- Zuck  et  al.  article.  Additionally,  adolescents 

in this study reported their average pain duration as 35.77 months, 

and although the self- report depressive symptoms on the CDI were 

mildly elevated in comparison to age norms, 25% of the participants 

reported  scores  above  the  clinical  cut- off 

(T- score = 65)  for 
depressive  symptoms.  Furthermore,  24%  of  adolescents  met  the 

criteria  for  an  attentional  disorder,  and  19%  met  the  criteria  for  a 
depressive  disorder.  In  comparison,  in  the  Wang  et  al.34  paper, 

adolescents  with  a  chronic  daily  headache  diagnosis  (experienced 

headaches  for  2 hours  or  more  per  day,  for  15  or  more  days  per 

month)  participated  in  diagnostic  psychiatric  interviews  using  the 

Structured  Mini- International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview- Kid  for 
children  and  adolescents  (MINI- Kid),40  a  validated  measure  for 

the age group 6– 17 years. Furthermore, 67% of adolescents in this 

study  reported  symptoms  of  migraine  or  probable  migraine,  55% 

experienced migraine without aura and 12% experienced migraine 

with and without aura. With regard to psychological symptoms, 47% 

had at least one depressive or anxiety disorder; the most frequent 

were major depression 21% and panic disorder 19%. The subsequent 

narrative  part  of  the  review  will  summarize  the  evidence  on  the 

identified functioning domains of emotional and social functioning.

3.3  |  Domains of functioning

3.3.1  |  Social functioning

Social functioning was examined in both the Kashikar- Zuck et al.35 
and the Wang et al.34 articles.

Social  functioning  was  operationalized  as  school  attendance 
in  the  Kashikar- Zuck  et  al.35  article  and  the  number  of  sick  days 
(referred to as sick leave) taken in the Wang et al.34 Although nei-

ther  article  included  in  this  domain  specified  the  need  for  a  diag-

nosed psychological disorder in their inclusion criteria, both articles 

sought to examine the prevalence of co- occurring chronic pain and 

clinical  levels  of  psychological  disorders  and/or  the  impact  of  hav-

ing  co- occurring  symptoms  on  social  functioning.  However,  only 
Kashikar- Zuck et al.35 included the explicit objective to assess social 

functioning in participants experiencing chronic pain and a psycho-
logical disorder, while Wang et al.34 set out to investigate the preva-

lence and association of psychological disorders in adolescents with 

chronic pain.

and  Schizophrenia  (K- SADS- PL)38,39  to  conduct  the  diagnostic 

rate primary psychological disorders prevalent in adolescents with 

chronic pain, notably depression, anxiety, and attentional disorders. 

The authors also identified an association between social function-

Wang  et  al.34  reported  the  existence  of  two  separate  primary 

disorders and adolescents' pain alone. This finding is in contrast to 

psychological disorders in their adolescent sample, depression, and 

articles  exploring  the  impact  of  high  levels  of  psychological  symp-

anxiety.  Results  showed  no  difference  in  social  functioning  when 

comparing adolescents experiencing co- occurring pain and primary 

psychological  disorders  with  adolescents  who  experience  chronic

3.3.2  |  Emotional functioning

Whilst the evaluation of emotional functioning was not the primary 
aim of the Wang et al.34 article, emotional functioning was examined 
as an adjunct to their primary objective. Wang et al.34 identified sui-

primary psychological disorders. Existing literature typically focuses 

on assessing the functioning of adolescents recruited from chronic 

pain clinics who report chronic pain and elevated levels of psycho-
logical  symptoms  via  self- report  measures.43,44  Similarly,  previous 

literature  also  reveals  that  adolescents  recruited  through  mental 
health settings also report chronic pain symptoms45; however, there 

was no reference to functioning outside of pain- related disability in 

this article. While research concerning elevated psychological symp-

cide risk in participants with chronic daily headache (CDH), which we 

toms  helps  provide  some  context,  there  are  important  differences 

have operationalized as emotional functioning. In their study, Wang 

between  adolescents  who  experience  symptom  elevations  and 

and colleagues reported that female participants who experienced

two  articles,  it  is  clear  from  our  review  that  adolescents  with 

these co- occurring conditions face more challenges to emotional 

functioning in comparison to adolescents who experience chronic 

pain alone. It is also clear that the psychological disorders and the 

assessment  measures  used  to  investigate  them  are  often  limited 

to depression and anxiety, with little exploration of the different 

types  of  psychopathologies  that  many  adolescents  experience. 

Subsequently,  research  surrounding  co- occurring  chronic  pain 

and psychopathology needs to be expanded to include a rigorous 

assessment  of  common  adolescent  psychopathology,  including 

self- harm, conduct disorder, eating disorders, OCD, ADHD, PTSD, 

phobias, etc.
