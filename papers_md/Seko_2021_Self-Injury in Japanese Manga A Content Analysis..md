Abstract
This study explored representations of self-injury in Japanese manga (graphic novels). A
content analysis of fifteen slice-of-life manga published between 2000-2017 was con-
ducted, focusing on forty scenes that depict eighteen characters engaging in self-injury.
Most depictions of self-injury reflect a stereotypical perception of “self-injurer,” a young
girl cutting herself to cope with negative emotion. Characters receive informal support
from friends and partners, while parents are portrayed as unsupportive and even trigger-
ing. An emergent trend was observed among manga targeting male readers to label self-
injuring women as “menhera” - mentally vulnerable damsels in distress - inviting a
fetishistic gaze on the self-injuring female bodies.

Introduction

As I watched the blood drip… And drip… It was like all the mixed-up thoughts in my
head… were flowing out of me.
The only thing that makes me feel better… is pain. If I want to know what it’s like to get
hurt… I have to experience it firsthand.
– LIFE (Suenobu 2002, 85, 97)

After slicing her arm with a box cutter, Ayumu, a fifteen-year-old high school girl crouches on
the floor, leaning against the bed. As the pent-up emotion that occupied her a moment ago

dissolves with the blood flowing out, so does the imagined face of her former best friend
staring at her with hatred. As tears flow from her eyes, Ayumu starts sobbing, “I’m sorry… I’m
sorry…” over and over again (Suenobu 2002, 87).

Ayumu’s self-cutting, portrayed in a Japanese manga (graphic novel), LIFE (Suenobu
2002-2009; 20 volumes), vividly represents increased public attention toward this new
“epidemic” among adolescents and young adults (Brumberg 2006). Since the early 1990s,
medical and public health communities across the world have reported the growth of self-
injury, the deliberate hurting of one’s body by cutting, burning, self-bruising or other methods.
While self-injury affects all age groups, research has consistently shown high prevalence
among youth. In a systematic review of one hundred nineteen epidemiological studies across
eighteen countries, the mean lifetime prevalence of self-injury (i.e., reporting at least one self-
injuring episode in lifetime) was estimated to be on average 17.2% among adolescents (ten to
seventeen years old) and 13.4% among young adults (eighteen to twenty-four years old),
compared to 5.5% among adults (twenty-five years or older) (Swannell et al. 2014). Although
the definition of self-injury has been the subject of contested debate (Chandler, Myers and Platt
2011), it is now widely accepted that most acts of self-injury represent behavioural problems
distinct from suicide attempts (Nock et al. 2006) and are distinguishable from culturally
sanctioned self-mutilations such as tattooing or body piercing (International Society for the
Study of Self-Injury 2018).1

While most existing prevalence studies are done in North America (Swannell et al. 2014;
Muehlenkamp et al. 2012), a handful of epidemiological studies have originated in Japan, a
country in which mental illness is considered the fifth “priority disease” for national medical
service (Ito et al. 2013). Okada et al. (2010) reported a lifetime prevalence rate of 8.2% from a
sample of Japanese junior high school students (n=2206, age range: twelve to fifteen).
Similarly, in a study of 1784 junior and senior high school students (mean age: 14.5, age
range twelve to seventeen), a lifetime prevalence rate of self-cutting was 9.9% (Matsumoto
et al. 2008), which is slightly higher than the prevalence rate of 6.9% among 540 college
students (Yamaguchi et al. 2004). According to two systematic reviews of prevalence studies
across geographical regions (Swannell et al. 2014; Muehlenkamp et al. 2012), these estimates
are slightly lower than those reported in North America, Europe, and other East Asian
countries. Nonetheless, mounting anecdotal evidence from health professionals and educa-
tional specialists suggests that the number of youth engaging in self-injury may have been
rapidly increasing in Japan, perhaps outpacing research and clinical efforts (e.g., Ishige 2006;
Takahashi and Fujiu 2015; Asano 2015). According to a survey with school counselors at
junior high and high school levels, over 98% of the respondents reported experiences working
with students who self-injure (Matsumoto, Imamura, and Katsumata 2009).

Although it is not clear why self-injury has rapidly gained public visibility over a relatively
short period of time, it is quite possible that media portrayals, especially visual depictions of
people who self-injure, have contributed to this growing public awareness. In their analysis of
English movies, TV shows, music, and print news featuring self-injuring characters, Whitlock
et al. (2009) identified a clear upward trend in the amount of media content featuring self-injury
since 2000. There were twenty movies with explicit references to self-injury in the 2000-2005
period alone, whereas prior to the 1990s only two movies in the sample portrayed self-injury.
A corpus of research indicated that depictions of self-injury in movies and TV shows are
often stereotypical and misrepresentative, as the self-injuring characters were predominantly
“White female cutters” in their teens or early twenties (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich
2009). This finding was replicated in another content analysis of forty-one English films

Journal of Medical Humanities (2021) 42:355–369

wherein the stereotype of young women cutting themselves to mitigate acute negative emotion
was readily prevalent and persistent (Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010). Feminist
scholars have problematized the gendered and racially-skewed representation of the “self-
injurers” in popular media. Brickman (2004) contends that media portrayal of self-injurers as
vulnerable young girls perpetuates the “delicate cutter” myth that reproduces a patriarchal
assumption of female passivity. Echoing Brickman and other feminist thinkers, Bareiss (2017)
also argues that representations of self-injury in popular Hollywood films, though somewhat
challenging societal norms, ultimately reinforce normative expectations of young women who
self-injure to be docile and submissive.

Compared to the Anglophone mediascape, little is known about how self-injury is repre-
sented in Japanese popular culture. Among many visual forms, manga2 has become one of the
most influential media outlets, due to its large and lucrative market,3 entertainment value,
affordability, and unique visual language representing internal thoughts and emotions of
characters (Cohn 2010). Manga has been instrumental in building a shared cultural space
among Japanese readers, covering virtually all topics imaginable, including sports, war,
corporate life, child rearing, sex, cooking, usury, and medicine. Beyond entertainment, manga
plays a wide array of roles in Japanese society – from a teaching tool, an information source, a
behaviour guide, social commentary, an agent of socialization (Ito 2005), to a vehicle for
government policy (Matanle, Ishiguro, and McCann 2014).

One notable characteristic of manga is its division of genres by gender and age. Most
manga first appear as a series in comic magazines, which are grouped by their gender-based
readership, namely, magazines for men (dansei-shi) and for women (josei-shi). Each category
is further divided into age-based subgenres including: shōnen manga (boy’s comics targeting
readers eighteen years old and younger), seinen manga (comics for young males age eighteen
to thirty), seijin manga (comics for grownups), shōjo manga (comics for girls eighteen years
old and younger), josei manga (comics targeting young female adults age eighteen to thirty),
and redicomi (“Lady’s Comic” for adult women). Shōnen and shōjo manga targeting young
readers generally refrain from explicit nudity, violence and sex, while manga for adult
audiences may carry R18 content.

Although Japanese consumers increasingly engage in cross-age, cross-gender readership,
the gender-/age-based heterosexual marketing genres still firmly shape the styles and aesthetic
of manga. For example, female characters in shōjo manga tend to embody societal appearance
norms, particularity girlish-cuteness (“kawaii”) culture typified by large staring eyes, frilly
dresses, flowers, ribbons and hearts (Kinsella 1995). Traditional gender perceptions manifest
more conspicuously in boys’ and men’s manga, in which female characters use a stereotypical
feminine speech style more frequently than has been reported for natural speech (Unser-Schutz
2015). Working women in best-selling men’s manga are typically portrayed as either excluded
from careers or negatively constructed as being too masculine (Matanle, Ishiguro, and
McCann 2014). Stereotypical gendering may also occur on the creator’s side, as manga
authors are likely to draw for audiences of their own gender. In other words, shōjo manga
are generally considered as comics “for girls, by girls,” while shōnen manga are comics “for
boys, by boys, about boys” (Unser-Schutz 2015), based on a marketing assumption about
readers relating to the characters of their own gender.

Like any other form of fictional literature and popular art, manga is deeply immersed in a
particular social environment. It constantly reproduces dominant norms, cultural values and
beliefs, including socially-embedded heteronormative gender norms and sexism, while offer-
ing readers an escape into an imaginative realm to pursue their desires and aspirations beyond

358

the limitations set by societal norms. Indeed, what manga offers goes beyond mere escapism;
via authentic depiction of a “Japanese way of life” (Ito 2005), it not only confirms social order
but also challenges readers to reconsider the taken-for-granted worldviews, social hierarchy
and norms. For Masuda (2015), manga’s character-based narrative allows readers to “experi-
ence different types of the “I” and “relate to the world by simulating the characters’ thoughts
and relationships” (28) and invites readers to reassess their everyday life and explore alterna-
tive ways of being.

Manga serves as a window to Japanese way of life that simultaneously conforms to and
challenges societal norms and values, making this cultural artifact particularly optimal for
analyzing a topic of interest in situ. While a few previous studies examined iryō-kei manga
(medical comics) featuring medical professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists) (Kishi
et al. 2011; Matsuoka, Smith, and Uchimura 2011), little has been explored about how manga
depicts a public health issue such as self-injury in everyday life context. Literature on the topic
of self-injury in manga is virtually nonexistent. We were able to locate one brief report (written
in Japanese) by Ishige (2006) that examines self-cutting portrayed in shōjo manga published
between 1973-2005, along with folklore and popular songs. Looking at shōjo manga featuring
wrist-cutting, Ishige asserts that the meaning ascribed to self-injury has been changing over
time from a suicide attempt to a coping strategy. However, although Ishige’s study offers a
meaningful introduction to this largely under-explored topic, the author does not provide a
detailed documentation of the search strategy, analytic method, and the content of manga
examined. It remains unknown as to what types of characters were depicted to engage in self-
injury and which set of meanings were associated with the act in each narrative. In addition,
there seems to be a significant increase in the volume and variety of manga featuring self-
injury since Ishige’s study, especially in genres other than shōjo manga.

The purpose of the present study was thus to examine how self-injury has been represented
in Japanese manga since 2000 through a thorough exploration of character demographics,
perceived functions of self-injury, and help-seeking behaviours among self-injuring characters
within each manga narrative. This study also intended to expand the scope from shōjo manga
to encompass other types of manga targeting different audiences in terms of gender and age.
Given the gendered nature of manga, one can hypothesize that boys’ manga and girls’ manga
may differ in portraying characters who self-injure, as well as meanings ascribed to each act.
Exploring the content of manga featuring self-injury thus leads to an important realization
about how this mass medium constructs a perceived reality of self-injury, and in so doing,
shapes public perceptions of this phenomenon.

Methods

Data collection

To date, there is no comprehensive database for Japanese manga. The sources of data for this
study were determined through various methods to enhance sampling validity. We first
searched three digital databases for manga, the Japan National Diet Library’s online catalogue
(http://www.ndl.go.jp/), the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs’ media arts digital archive
(https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp), and Kyoto International Manga Museum’s Manga
Repository (http://mmsearch.kyotomm.jp/index_j.html), using the term “jishō” (self-injury).
We also consulted with librarians at six Japanese libraries with extensive manga collections.

Two out of the six libraries, the Osaka Prefectural Library and the Kyoto International Manga
Museum, provided us with a comprehensive list of manga that might meet our eligibility
criteria below. Additionally, we sought eligible manga by conducting a Google search, visiting
online communities where members discuss manga/comics, movies and books featuring self-
injury (e.g. Self-Injury.net), circulating general inquiries among our professional and personal
networks, and consulting relevant literature on visual representations of self-injury.

While the narrative review by Ishige (2006) covered shōjo manga published between 1973-
2005, 75% of the samples were published prior to 2000. Similar to what Whitlock et al. (2009)
reported in their study of English movies featuring self-injury, since 2000 we have noticed a
clear upward trend in the amount of manga portraying self-injury. To update and expand
Ishige’s work, we chose to analyze manga published between 2000 to 2017, and broadened the
focus to include other marketing genres than shōjo manga, such as shōnen manga, seinen
manga, and Boy’s Love, a subgenre of josei manga featuring homoerotic relationships between
male characters. As we were most interested in depiction of self-injury in everyday life
contexts, we limited our focus onto nichijō-kei (“slice-of-life”) genre that features realistic
depictions of everyday life, excluding science fiction, fantasy, picaresque romance and other
genres that take place in imaginary worlds. Manga featuring overt suicide attempts and
culturally sanctioned forms of self-mutilation (e.g. tattooing, body-piercing) were also exclud-
ed. As such, our sample did not include a distinct manga genre featuring Yakuza (Japanese
mafia) and Yankee (gangster) subculture that frequently portray ritualistic self-injury including
yubitsume (a ritual of finger amputation to atone for one’s misdeed) or konjō-yaki (a test of
courage by burning skin with a cigarette). These self-mutilation rituals serve as staples of
Yakuza/Yankee manga and movies as a sign of underground camaraderie among clan mem-
bers, but did not meet our eligibility criteria.

A total of fifteen manga featuring eighteen characters with explicit engagement with self-
injury were identified (see Appendix Table 4 for the list of manga analyzed). Of fifteen manga,
there were eight shōjo manga (Memai, Tobira, LIFE, GALS!, Mondai no nai watashitachi,
Aishiteruze Baby, NANA, Tokyo Children), five seinen manga (eleGY, Last Menhera, Jisatsu
Circle, G senjō Heaven’s Door, Onani Master Kurosawa), one josei manga (Pietà), and one
Boy’s Love (CUT). No shōnen manga met our eligibility criteria.4 Each manga was further
scrutinized to identify scenes depicting self-injury. In cases where self-injury appeared more
than once in the story, each scene was recorded as a separate event. A total of forty scenes of
self-injury were depicted among the sample with nine out of eighteen characters (50%)
portrayed as engaging in self-injury more than once. The year when the scene of self-injury
appeared in each manga ranged from 2000-2017, with 75% (n=30) appearing during 2000-
2005.

Content analysis

The method of content analysis was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative ap-
proaches. Informed by previous quantitative content analysis of movies featuring self-injury
(Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009; Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010), two
authors first collaboratively developed a coding rubric to capture: 1) demographic data of the
characters who self-injure (i.e. gender, age, occupation, sexual orientation, whether the char-
acters are portrayed as engaging in habitual self-injury); 2) methods of self-injury depicted (e.g.,
cutting, burning, hitting); 3) locations of self-injury on the body (e.g. wrist, forearm, thigh); 4)
presence of other characters at the scene of self-injury; and 5) mental and/or physical health

360

intervention after self-injury. Two authors then individually read five manga each to qualita-
tively analyze: 6) events that triggered self-injury; 7) degree of suicidal intent (e.g., overt,
implied, none); 8) consequences of self-injury; and 9) perceived functions of self-injury. In this
process, perceived functions of self-injury were determined in accordance with the antecedents
and consequences implicitly and explicitly portrayed in narratives. As manga contains a
complex system of symbolic meaning combining multiple visual and textual subcodes, the
authors paid close attention not only to plots, characters’ facial expressions and dialogues but
also backgrounds (e.g., tones of the scene), onomatopoeia, frames, and characters’ interior
monologues implying particular meanings associated with each self-injurious act. Klonsky’s
(2007) seven-function model also provided a guiding framework for coding of the perceived
functions. The seven functions include: affect regulation, anti-dissociation, anti-suicide, inter-
personal boundaries, interpersonal influence, self-punishment, and sensation seeking.

After two iterations, the coding rubric was finalized. The first author coded all forty scenes,
while two trained research assistants independently coded 50% of the sample each using the
final rubric to capture the aforementioned nine elements. Agreement between two coders (the
first author and one of the research assistants) was on average 95%, ranging from 100%
(demographic characteristics, methods of self-injury) to 82% (perceived functions of self-
injury). During the coding process, the first author and the research assistants took notes of
their thought process and ensured interpretative consistency by team discussion. Discrepancies
among coders were discussed until consensus was achieved.

sampled manga. A salient gender difference was found in the characters, with sixteen out of
eighteen characters being female (88.9%). All but one character (94.5%) were in their
adolescence aged between thirteen and eighteen years old, being in high school or at junior

high school. The youngest age of onset depicted in those flashback scenes is grade four (nine
to ten years old). In general, characters are portrayed as heterosexual, except for two charac-
ters, the female protagonist of Pietà (Haruno 2000) and the male protagonist of CUT (Kawayui
2003) who are depicted as in non-heterosexual romantic relationships. Characters who self-
injure tended to be main characters in the narrative (77.8% n=14) with the story unfolding
through their perspectives. These characters’ internal thoughts are often expressed through
thought bubbles or narrations. Thirteen characters (72.2%) are portrayed as recurrently
engaging in self-injury, suggested by visible scars or through flashback scenes that reveal
their past history.

Depictions of self-injury

Of the forty self-injury scenes, thirty-five (87.5%) feature graphic depictions of self-injury in
action, while five scenes allude to the act through visual depictions of bleeding wounds or
scars with characters’ accounts or inner thoughts. Four of the forty scenes of self-injury are
flashbacks in which the characters retrospectively recall their past self-injury and events that
triggered the act. Of the forty scenes examined, cutting is the most prominent method (87.5%,
n=35), followed by stabbing (7.5%, n=3) and burning (5%, n=2). In terms of wound locations,
self-injury is performed most often on wrists (47.5%, n=19) and on arms (40%, n=16), then
less frequently on thighs (5%, n=2), hands (5%, n=2) and neck (n=1). Two characters self-
injure multiple body parts (See Table 2). In 85% of the scenes examined (n=34), characters
self-injure alone in a private space such as a bathroom or a bedroom to conceal their
behaviours. In six scenes (15%), characters engage in self-injury in the presence of others
(e.g., friends, families) to shock the person in presence or to express belonging to a group. In
the majority of scenes examined (n=34, 85%), characters engaging in habitual self-injury feel
they would be discriminated against if others discover their self-injury and thus conceal their
scars with wristbands or long sleeves.

Functions of self-injury and interventions

The perceived primary functions of self-injury vary across the forty scenes (Table 3). The most
conspicuous is affect regulation (55%, n=22) in which self-injury is depicted as a strategy to

alleviate acute negative emotion or aversive affective arousal (Klonsky, 2007) triggered by
events such as bullying, friendship dissolution, conflict with family, or childhood trauma. The
majority of scenes make no reference to a specific mental disorder (e.g., Borderline Personality
Disorder, anxiety disorder) except for two scenes where characters are depicted as suffering
from substance abuse (Memai) or depression (Tokyo Children).

For some of the characters who engage in habitual self-injury, the act tended to serve a
single function (e.g., coping with emotional distress) despite being triggered by different
antecedents. For others with recurrent self-injury, the meaning associated with self-injury
varies depending on the motivation at the time, the relationship with the others in presence,
and the frame of reference drawn to interpret the act. For example, a young female protagonist
of Tobira (Momochi 2002) engages in self-cutting twice through the story; the first time is to
express a blood oath of friendship with her classmate who habitually self-injures, and the
second time is to attempt suicide in front of her mother. The protagonist, Manatsu, flexibly
interprets self-injury first as a gesture of social bonding, then as a means to communicate her
suicidality to her mother.

In most scenes analyzed (75%, n=30), self-injury is portrayed as independent from suicidal
thoughts or behaviour. In Last Menhera, for example, the protagonist Sumire describes her
recurrent self-cutting as a way of “enduring the pain of living” (Amano and Ise 2016, 56),
rather than terminating her life. In five scenes (12.5%) characters are depicted as having overt
or implied suicidal intent. Among these scenes three characters attempt suicide by wrist-
cutting, while two attempt suicide by jumping or intoxication in addition to cutting.

In four scenes (10%), characters engage in self-injury to punish or invalidate themselves.
This tendency is particularly salient in LIFE (Suenobu, 2002-2009; 20 volumes) quoted at the
beginning of this article. The protagonist, Ayumu, is portrayed as shy and introverted,
engaging in recurrent self-cutting as she feels she “does not deserve” to be happy (Suenobu
2002, 97). In two scenes (5%), characters injure themselves in a dissociative state. For
example, in Pietà (Haruno 2000), the protagonist, Rio (a female high school student), is
portrayed as cutting herself after having a flashback nightmare of her vicious stepmother. She
is depicted as though not noticing her self-cutting until blood is dripping on the kitchen floor.
Regaining a sense of self, Rio sinks on the floor with her arms wrapped around knees, faintly
murmuring “Help” (19).

The majority of characters are not in any form of psychiatric treatment when engaging in
self-injury. With respect to consequences of self-injury, in twenty-nine of forty scenes

Journal of Medical Humanities (2021) 42:355–369

363

examined (72.5%), self-injury does not result in any treatment or intervention. Six scenes
(15%) were categorized as “unspecified” because these scenes depict either the character
recalling a past self-injury episode, or the story stops right at the moment of self-injury then
leaps to a few days/months later with no reference to whether a treatment or intervention was
offered to the character. There is little direct depiction of mental health treatment provided to
characters after self-injury, except for one manga (Tobira) in which the mother of the
protagonist saw a psychiatrist for advice after her daughter’s wrist-cutting. In terms of informal
support, ten characters (55.6%) receive support from partners and friends, while parents and
siblings seldom served as a source of support. The reactions of partners and close friends
tended to be empathetic and contributing to the characters’ recovery from self-injury, while
parents, siblings and distant peers (e.g., classmates) are shown to be indifferent or react
aversively to the character. In some of the manga examined, family members are portrayed
as a direct trigger of self-injury. For example, in Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and
Ushida 2003, 3 volumes), a high school girl, Midori, faces constant pressure from her mother
to succeed in school, marry a rich man, and take the mother out of her unhappy marriage.
Midori feels distressed by the selfish dream that her mother imposes upon her and engages in
recurrent self-injury until she meets the story’s protagonist Mio at school and receives
emotional support.

An emergent conceptualization of self-injury was also observed. While self-injury itself
does not serve a distinct identity label (i.e., no character is called a “wrist-cutter” or “self-
injurer”), in two seinen manga (eleGY, Last Menhera) published in 2012 and after, female
characters who self-injure are coined “menhera” (a derivation of “mental health-er,” a person
with mental instability)5 by other characters or superimposed texts. In both manga, the
menhera girls are depicted as isolated, mentally unstable, and highly dependent on male
protagonists who are interested in having a romantic/sexual relationship with them. The female
protagonist Sumire in Last Menhera (Amano and Ise 2016) also engages in promiscuous
sexual activity to combat feelings of emptiness until developing a stable relationship with the
male protagonist.

Discussion

The current study aimed to offer a close reading of scenes in Japanese manga featuring self-
injury. We explored how self-injury has been represented in Japanese manga since 2000,
focusing on self-injuring characters, the perceived functions of the behaviour, as well as the
presence and absence of help-seeking among the characters. Results indicate that manga’s
depiction of self-injury are largely congruent with previous research on self-injury in English
films (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009; Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010;
Bareiss 2017), in which characters who self-injure are predominantly heterosexual female in
their late teens, engaging in habitual self-cutting. Although there are a few male self-injuring
characters, the gendered perspective still permeates the sampled manga.

Likewise, functions of self-injury mirror those identified in previous studies and clinical
research (e.g., Klonsky 2007; Klonsky et al. 2015). Most characters who self-injure are
portrayed as using self-injury as a strategy to cope with negative emotions, punish themselves,
or interrupt a dissociative episode rather than as an act of suicide attempt. In two of five scenes
in which characters are depicted to have overt or implied suicide intent, wrist-cutting is used in
combination with more lethal methods such as jumping and intoxication, implying perceived

364

Journal of Medical Humanities (2021) 42:355–369

low lethality of wrist-cutting. In alignment with Ishige’s (2006) observation that wrist-cutting
no longer signals suicidal ideation in the post-1980 manga, this finding indicates that while the
depiction of wrist-cutting may still evoke a traditional cultural reading that connects the act
with suicidal intent, the interpretation of habitual wrist-cutting as a coping mechanism to
endure “the pain of living” (Amano and Ise 2016) may be increasingly incorporated into the
Japanese popular cultural imagination. Given that research indicates habitual engagement in
self-injury elevates suicide risk and provides a “gateway” for suicide (Whitlock et al. 2013),
potential implications of this interpretation warrants caution.

There is a general lack of help-seeking among self-injuring characters. Across the forty scenes
examined, self-injury is portrayed as a stigmatized behaviour that makes the characters feel
ashamed, and they conceal their behaviours and scars from others. However, more than half of
the characters who self-injure eventually receive emotional support from significant others who
help them recover from habitual self-injury. While a similar finding was reported in a previous
study in which self-injuring characters receive informal support from friends and family
(Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010), in the present study the sources of support are
primarily romantic partners and close friends; reaction by families, parents in particular, to the
self-injuring characters tend to be unsupportive and aversive, or even triggering, like the mother in
Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and Ushida 2001-2003) who desires to use her daughter to
compensate for her unhappy life. In such a context, character’s self-injury is portrayed as a form of
resistance against repressive parental domination, similar to Bareiss’s (2017) analysis of films
featuring self-injuring girls. In addition, the absence of parental support for self-injury can also be
explained by the prevalence of a bildungsroman theme in both shōnen and shōjo manga, in which
conflict with parental figures often serve as a catalyst for self-actualization for young characters.
In a related vein, we observed two contrasting perspectives toward young girls who self-
injure. On one hand, in shōjo manga, characters who self-injure are primarily protagonists of
the narrative, whose internal struggles and causes of self-injury are delineated with extensive
detail from a first person point of view. As shōjo manga serve young female readers as “a
model for reality” (Masuda 2015), these manga may invite readers to walk through life
struggles with the protagonists and frame self-injury as a maladaptive but understandable
response to contemporary pressures placed upon young girls. The depiction of self-injury as a
gesture of friendship or group membership also reflects the female characters’ desire for
escaping from parental control and belonging instead to a group of peers who accept them.

On the other hand, seinen manga aimed at adult male readers portray girls who self-injure
from the perspective of male protagonists. Of particular interest is the emergence of “menhera”
characters in two seinen manga published since 2012, in which male protagonists are attracted
to menhera girls who exhibited mental instability, fear of abandonment and insecure romantic
attachments. For these menhera girls, self-injury is not just an act of affect regulation but also
an identity label that shapes their role in the narrative. The menhera character can be seen as a
twisted variant of the damsel in distress, a classic narrative trope in literature that involves
young, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by a hero. They were placed in
a predicament not by a monster or a villain but by mental illness that makes them prone to
risky behaviour such as self-injury or sexual promiscuity. Contrary to characters that self-injure
in shōjo manga, these menhera girls are clearly subjected to the male gaze that objectifies and
fetishizes the female self-injured body, while attention is deflected from underlying causes of
self-injury. Although it may be too naïve to believe that readers take such a portrayal at face
value, this fetishized gaze toward menhera girls nonetheless provides its overwhelmingly male
readers with a highly gendered interpretive repertoire. An inquiry into these two contrasting

views would make a valuable contribution to the understanding of public perception on mental
illness in Japan.

Furthermore, it would be meaningful for future work to explore depictions of subcultural
and ritualistic self-injury in manga for male readers, particularly those themed Yakuza (Japa-
nese mafia) and Yankee (gangster) that were excluded from the current study. In their content
analysis of English films, Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister (2010) report that male charac-
ters who self-injure engage in more diverse methods of self-injury than females. Exploring
subculturally sanctioned body mutilations in shōnen, seinen and seijin manga targeting male
readership may imply how these self-injuries have distinctive meaning in Japanese popular
culture in contrast to the pathologized and highly gendered portrayal of self-injury explored in
this study. In this process, applying a critical gender lens to these representations would
substantially enrich future investigation. Moreover, future exploration into self-published
doujinshi (indie comics) and web comics with self-injuring characters would further expand
this field of inquiry. With the advancement of indie comic markets and self-publishing online
tools, Japanese readers are increasingly exposed to less filtered and more direct depictions of
violence and human suffering including self-injury, suicide, and other mental health issues.
This line of research could analyze how this emergent subculture represents self-injury in
comparison with mainstream manga, focusing particularly on the “menhera” characters and
on unique behavioural and affective attributes they embody.

The current findings have several implications for future research and intervention of self-
injury. First, manga has been deeply embedded in contemporary Japanese society to the extent
that its power to shape public understanding of mental health issues cannot be underestimated.
Manga representations of self-injury examined in this study offer a complex commentary on
self-injury and have likely influenced, to varying degrees, readers’ perceptions of how people
who self-injure could be like and should be treated. As manga is considered providing young
readers “textbooks for living” (Masuda 2015, 28), some readers may turn to these manga to
make sense of their own engagement in self-injury. The portrayal of emotional support from
partners and close friends observed in this study may induce a sense of hope among readers
who self-injure, while reducing the feeling of social isolation commonly reported by youth
engaging in self-injury (Whitlock et al. 2013). Meanwhile, the general absence of support from
family (parents in particular) found in this study is concerning, because this tendency may
perpetuate existing stigma associated with self-injury and promote the vilification of parents.
Second, actual impacts of manga on readers should be examined in future research. Although
there is as yet no empirical evidence if exposure to the portrayal of self-injury in manga (and
popular media in general) may induce contagion,6 researchers have addressed concern that
recurrent exposure to fictional/non-fictional self-injury stories may result in narrative reinforce-
ment (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009), which, for better or worse, justify self-injury
related behavioural choices. Indeed, remarkably little has been written about the positive thera-
peutic potential of manga for readers with mental health issues. Researching further into how
readers of different types interpret manga and the potential use of manga in treating people who
self-injure may provide a new avenue into improving support to those engaging in self-injury.

Finally, the present study makes a unique contribution to the emergent study of graphic
medicine (Williams 2012) by illuminating how the medium of comic can be used to under-
stand subjective experience of self-injury. For readers residing in other countries than Japan,
the current study findings may be of particularly salience, as they offer an interesting window
into a unique cultural interpretation of self-injury in Japan and suggest the potential of cross-
cultural exploration into cultural attitudes toward self-injury and related mental health issues.

Given the increasing visibility of Japanese popular media including manga in international
markets (Ito 2010), much more work could be done in this area, including the academic
appraisal of manga representations of mental health in and outside Japan, and how such
manga are perceived by Japanese and non-Japanese audiences.

Endnotes

1 Promoting this line of definition, a group of psychiatrists and researchers proposed a term “non-suicidal self-
injury (NSSI)” to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5 criteria (American
Psychiatric Association 2013). Although NSSI did not become a standalone, formal diagnosis, the term is now
widely used among the clinical community allowing clinicians to treat self-injury as a mental illness. Critical
scholars of health such as Amy Chandler (2014) voiced concern over how this trend towards pathologization
would impact individual and public understandings of self-injury.
2 Although the history of Japanese manga can date back to the seventh century (Ito 2005), in this article manga
refers to modern Japanese graphic novels popularized after World War II that combines traditional Japanese
iconography with American cartoon and cinematic techniques. Fredrik Schodt’s seminal book Manga! Manga!:
The World of Japanese Comics (1986) provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Japanese manga
until the 1980s. Kinko Ito’s chapter (2005) also provides a succinct summary of Japanese manga history from
ancient times to the early twenty-first century. It is worth noting here that this article uses the term “manga” both
as a singular and a plural noun.
3 A 2018 report by the All Japan Magazine and Book Publishers and Editors Association (AJPEA)’s 2018
estimated the total sales of the manga industry in 2017 (physical and digital platforms combined) as 433 billion
yen (equivalent to $3.92 billion USD), which generated nearly double the revenues of the local film industry (228
billion yen, Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan, 2018). Although sales of print manga have been
declining since the mid-1990s, the rise of denshi comic (digital comics) kept the market afloat. Manga also plays
a vital role in Japan’s “media mix,” a character-based marketing strategy to distribute content across multiple
media platforms (Ito 2010). Popular manga series often provide characters and plots for other platforms such as
anime (animation), games, films, TV dramas, advertising and even political campaigns that together establish
manga’s pervasive presence in Japanese cultural landscape.
4 There are two potential explanations that may account for the absence of shōnen manga. First, in shōnen manga,
slice-of-life genre is popular, but not as dominant as in other genre (e.g., shōjo manga). Self-injury depicted as
happening in imaginary worlds did not meet this study’s inclusion criteria. Second, when shōnen manga portray
self-injurious behaviours, the acts tend to take a form of physical aggression against objects, rather than
aggression against oneself. For example, it is a common scene among shōnen and seinen manga wherein a male
protagonist punches a wall or window, damages the object, and consequently hurts himself. Such a portrayal did
not meet the study definition of self-injury being a deliberate hurting of one’s body, because the injury is the
consequence, rather than the purpose of the act. As pointed out by one reviewer, the absence of shōnen manga in
our sample may also suggest a gendered understanding of self-injury penetrating Japanese popular culture. Future
research focusing on gender difference in the depiction of aggressive behaviours among Japanese manga would
provide further insight.
5 The term “menhera” spawned from a mental health discussion board on 2-channel (2-chan), a Japanese massive
anonymous online forum. Although the term was originally used by people struggling mental health issues to
address themselves, it increasingly carries negative, derogatory connotations in Japanese popular culture.
6 In Japan, potential psychological and behavioural impacts of manga on readers, especially adolescents and
young adults, have long been the topic of contested debate. Violent and sexually explicit expressions in manga
for young readership came under recurrent critique by parent associations, school authorities, and policy makers
who insisted manga has harmful impact on children. Most recently in 2010, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government
tried to ban the sexually explicit expression in manga and anime through the revision of the Tokyo Metropolitan
Youth Healthy Development Ordinance. The Ordinance was amended to extend the definition of “harmful
content” to include “hijitsuzai seishōnen” (non-existent youth). Facing massive protest from writers and
publishers, this proposal removed ‘non-existent youth’ and received approval by the Metropolitan Assembly
in December 2010 (Asahi Shimbun 2010)
