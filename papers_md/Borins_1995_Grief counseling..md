Grief counseling

MEL BORINS, MD, CCFP

SUMMARY
Patients grieve the loss of loved
ones, jobs, morriages, or even
functioning. They seek comfort,
understanding, respect, and
espedally hope. The "work of
grief' progresses through
stages. Mixed with the sadness
can be feelings of anger, fear,
and guilt. Psychotherapy can
relieve self-destructive anger
and guilt, advance the recovery
phase, and stimulate
psychological strength and
personality growth.

RESUME
Les patients pleurent la perte
des etres chers, d'un emploi,
la rupture d'un mariage et la
perte de leur autonomie
fonctionnelle. Ils recherchent
du soutien, de la comprehension,
du respect et surtout de l'espoir.
Le cheminement a travers
ce processus de deuil comporte
plusieurs stades. La tristesse
peut s'accompagner de senti-
ments de colere, de crainte et
de culpabilite. La psychotherapie
peut attenuer la colere et la
culpabilite autodestructrices en
accelerant le stade de
recuperation et en stimulant le
pouvoir psychologique et Ia
croissance de la personnalite.

OSS IS SO MUCH A PART OF BEING
human that we tend to
underestimate the impact of
grief on the health of our
patients. Increases in morbidity in
terms of physical and mental health
problems and greater health care use
as well as increases in mortality have
been substantiated.' Increased use of
sedatives, tranquilizers, alcohol, and
medications has been demonstrated
among those who are grieving the
death of a husband or wife.2

Holmes and Rahe3 developed the
Social Readjustment Rating Scale
showing that people are more likely to
become ill after a loss. Patients com-
monly grieve the loss of loved ones,
such as parents, spouses, children, and
siblings, and also the loss ofjobs, mar-
riages, or even functioning (loss of
body part or use). Frequently the
grieving process is a normal adjust-
ment to the realities of daily living
rather than a pathological state.
People come to physicians looking for
a wise sage, a human being who has
experience dealing with the tragedies

of life. They look for an empathetic,
nonjudgmental, supportive listener
whom they can trust. They often turn
to physicians first.

It is sometimes difficult to find psy-
chiatrists, social workers, or psycholo-
gists who have the time to counsel
people who need help. This is especial-
ly true in rural areas. As a result, much
of the responsibility falls on primary
care physicians. Often physical com-
plaints and medical conditions make
the emotional problems more compli-
cated to treat. Family practitioners are
in an excellent position to integrate the
psychological with the physical (taking
into consideration the spiritual) to
provide "holistic care."4 This article
attempts to heighten physicians'
awareness of the grieving process and
indicate how we can intervene.

Acute phase
Patients in the acute phase of grief are
seeking comfort, understanding,
respect, and especially hope. They do
not need to be judged, told what to do,
or told to keep a "stiff upper lip." They
need to be allowed to cry and express
in words their feelings of loss. An
appointment right after a loss enables a
physician to assess the effect the death
has on the patient's life and decide
what appropriate action can be taken.

Canadian Family Physician VOL41:July 1995 1207

reorganization that are stimulated by
awareness of the impending death of a
loved one and recognition of the associ-
ated losses that have already occurred;
of the ongoing losses of progressive
debilitation, increasing dependence,
continual uncertainty, decreasing con-
trol; and of the losses yet to come.
Physicians can help patients with the
delicate balance of simultaneously
holding onto, letting go of, and drawing
closer to the dying person.R Certain
people are more at risk of having prob-
lems because of highly ambivalent or
dependent relationships.

Unresolved grief
Sigmund Freud described a clear dif-
ference between grief and melancholia.
In grief the mourner comes to terms
with a permanent detachment from
the much loved person:
[The] work of grief is a progression through
stages of anger, painful dejection, loss of interest
in the outside world, inhibition of activity and
the temporary interruption of the capacity to
love. Melancholia results when the normal
process is not completed.9

Often patients will offer other symp-
toms as a way of getting a foot in the
door. They sometimes believe it is inap-
propriate to discuss psychosocial issues
with their physicians. Sometimes their
own denial is so strong that they them-
selves have blocked their true feelings,
and the sadness comes out inadver-
tently in the course of an appointment
for something else.

a creative listener. Dr Carl Rogers in
his book, Client Centred Therapy,5
describes a technique of simply playing
back to patients the essence of what
they said, reflecting content and affect.
Patients get the experience of being
listened to and of hearing feedback
from another person replaying their
words and feelings. Rogers postulated
"empathy," "unconditional regard,"
and "genuineness" as necessary condi-
tions for psychotherapy.

People who are suddenly bereaved
could require more support and coun-
seling than those who have known
their loved ones are dying. They need
to be given the opportunity to talk
through the death, to have repeated
opportunities to share feelings and
make real the events of the death, to
work through the unfinished feelings
about the deceased (especially the
feelings of chaos and insecurity stimu-
lated by unanticipated loss), and to
learn how not to overreact to the
insecurity and fear that remains after
this type of death.6 Emergency
departments, coronary care units, and
intensive care units should provide
help for the bereaved. Early counsel-
ing can reduce morbidity among
high-risk groups.7

Anticipatory grief
Anticipatory grief encompasses the
processes of mourning, coping, interac-
tion, planning, and psychosocial

A patient comes in with a headache
or bronchitis and, in the midst of a
15-minute appointment, starts to cry.
There is too little time available to deal
with the complex issues. It is helpful to
attempt to manage the acute situation
and then arrange for a follow-up
appointment in a psychotherapy slot
for a half-hour or full hour. It is impor-
tant to establish that there is no danger
of homicide or suicide and even see the
patient for another short appointment
next day if a longer session cannot be
arranged quickly.

It is not unusual for patients to visit
years later with unfinished, unresolved
issues concerning a death from the
past. Usually the grieving process lasts
somewhere from 6 months to 2 years.
But there are differences between cul-
tural backgrounds. All people, depend-
ing on their cultures, belief systems,
and personalities, will find their own
ways to resolve the loss.

If, after a reasonable period, the
person is still not over the death of a
loved one, it is worthwhile to look for
other factors preventing resolution.
Mixed in with the sadness can be

feelings of anger, fear, and guilt. None
of us likes to admit anger at a dead
person, so these emotions are often dis-
guised or repressed and prolong the
period of grief or show up in other
ways.'0 Sometimes the patient is clini-
cally depressed and needs antidepres-
sant medication.

Techniques of interventions
A technique originally developed by
Jacob Moreno and later adapted by
Dr Fritz Perls in Gestalt therapy
involves psychodrama or the patient's
acting out a dialogue with the
deceased. " The patient plays both
roles by actually changing chairs and
talking back and forth to the imagined
person with the aim of contacting old
feelings and linking them up to
thoughts. The focus can be on express-
ing the loss, anger, fears, and resent-
ment. Eventually working toward
forgiveness of the deceased is helpful.
This technique has been used to
deal with the loss of children, grief
about abortions, and even mis-
carriages. The patient plays the part of
herself and the unborn child.

Canadian Famiy Physician VOL41:]uy 1995 1209

Because children tend to communi-
cate nonverbally, drawings that allow
children to express their feelings freely
and their concerns without the pressures
and risks of miscommunicating are an
important tool for physicians. Physicians
can ask children to draw a picture of the
family and then ask them to talk about
the picture. If serious concerns are
raised, referral to professionals experi-
enced in dealing with bereavement
among children can be sought.
Physicians can provide surviving parents
and children with books and movies,
which can stimulate further discussion in
terms the child can understand.'4

Instead of death being seen as part
of life, deaths can be seen as somehow
a mistake or deficiency. Even physi-
cians can have feelings of guilt if they
see any death as a failure on their part.
If only they had done this or that or
responded differently, the person might
still be living. As physicians we must
learn from our mistakes and be able to
share our grief with our patients and
their families."'

Counseling that focuses on the grief
reaction can help to advance the recov-
ery phase and stimulate new psychologi-
cal strength and personality growth.
Mourning is important, but when the
mourning takes over, affects functioning,
and is excessively prolonged, then inter-
vention is necessary. Psychotherapy can
focus on the resentment and anger sup-
pressed or turned back on the self as well
as help resolve self-destructive guilt.

Grief counseling

Sometimes patients feel unresolved
because they never actually got a
chance to say goodbye and see the per-
son die. Deaths often occur in hospi-
tals, with family and friends absent.
Having them act out a conversation
with the deceased and actually saying
goodbye, even though totally artificial,
can dramatically help to resolve unfin-
ished feelings. This type of intervention
can also be done using hypnosis.

The biggest problem faced by par-
ents of a stillborn child is the failure of
families, friends, and physicians to rec-
ognize that their grief has arisen from
the death of a real person.'2 Always
make a point of talking about grief after
abortions, miscarriages, and deaths
from sudden infant death syndrome. It
is not uncommon to find parents even
years later with unfinished sad feelings
about the loss of their unborn child.
Because recovering from the death of a
child is perhaps the most difficult, sug-
gest patients get involved in self-help
community support groups to help
reduce the psychological damage to
themselves and remaining siblings.
The death of a parent is one of the
most stressful occurrences for a child to
endure. A reported 61 % of bereaved
children have suicidal thoughts and
plans.'3 Children can experience devel-
opmental disturbances, psychiatric dis-
orders, disturbed ego development,
and physical complaints. Intervention
with this group can prevent future psy-
chiatric disturbance.

Involving family members in the
therapy can mobilize additional sup-
port. Often working on forgiveness
and helping patients to express
unspoken feelings eases the grief and
helps patients to heal.

WMevacor®

(lovastatin tablets, MSD Std.)

Tablets 20 and 40 mg
Cholesterol-lowering agent
INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE
As an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL-C levels
in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, whether the elevated serum
cholesterol is associated with triglyceride levels that are normal (Type Ila)
or increased (Type llb).
To determine which patients to treat, initially establish that the elevation in
plasma lipids is not due to secondary conditions such as poorly-
controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, the nephrotic syndrome,
liver disease, or dysproteinemias. Then ascertain whether elevated LDL-C
level is the cause for elevated total serum cholesterol, particularly in
patients with total triglycerides over 4.52 mmol/L (400 mg/dL) or with
markedly elevated HOL-C values, where non-LDL lipoprotein fractions
may contribute significantly to total cholesterol levels, without apparent
increase in cardiovascular risk.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to any component. Active liver disease or unexplained
persistent elevations of serum transaminases. Pregnancy and lactation
(see PRECAUTIONS).
WARNINGS
The effect of lovastatin-induced changes In lipoprotin levels,
including reduction of serum cholesterol, on cardiovascular
morbidity or mortality has not been established.
1. Liver Dysfunction: In controlled clinical trials, marked
persistent Increases in serum transaminases occurred in 1.6%
of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year
(see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Increases usually appeared 3 to
12 months after start of therapy and were not associated with jaundice or
other clinical signs or symptoms. Serum transaminases fell slowly to pre-
treatment levels when drug was interrupted or discontinued.
Present clinical experience Indicates that all patients should
have liver function tests at baseline and every 4-6 weeks
during the first 15 months of therapy, and periodically
thereafter. Patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels,
require particular aftention, prompt retesting, and more frequent testing.
Discontinue drug if transaminase levels show evidence of
progression, particularly a rise to 3 times the upper limit of
normal. If elevations still persist, make further investigations, including
liver biopsy if necessary.
Use with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of
alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Discontinue drug if active
liver disease or unexplained serum transaminase elevations develop
during therapy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Moderate elevations of serum transaminases, reported with lovastatin,
have also been observed with other, comparative lipid- lowering agents.
These changes generally appeared within the first 3 months after
initiation of therapy, were often transient, not accompanied by any other
symptoms, and did not need interruption of treatment.
2. Muscle Effects - CPK: Transient elevation of creatine phosphokinase
(CPK) levels commonly seen, have usually no clinical significance. -
Myaigia and muscle cramps have also been observed. - Rhabdo-
myolysis occurred rarely; consider possibility in any patient with diffuse
myalgias, muscle tenderness and/or marked elevation of creatine
phosphokinase (10 times the upper limit of normal). In cardiac transplant
patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporine,
severe rhabdomyolysis that precipitated acute renal failure, has been
reported. Discontinue lovastatin it marked elevation of CPK
levels occurs and institute appropriate therapy. - Myopathy:
Mostly seen in patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive drugs
that included cyclosporine, gemfibrozil or lipid-lowering doses of niacin.
Carefully consider benefits and risks of concomitant use with
immunosuppressive drugs, fibrates or lipid-lowering doses of
niacin. Consider Interrupting lovastatin In any patient with a
risk factor predisposing to development of renal failure or
rhabdomyolysis, such as: severe acute Infection, hypotension,
major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine or
electrolyte disorders and uncontrolled seizures.
PRECAUTIONS
General: Before starting therapy, aftempt to control hypercholesterolemia
with appropriate diet, exercise, weight reduction in overweight and obese
patients, and to treat underlying medical problems (see INDICATIONS).
he patient should inform subsequent physicians of prior use of
lovastatin. Ophthalmological observations: No unequivocal evidence
exists that lovastatin causes human lens opacities, but lack of an effect on
the lens has not been established. Pending further experience, it is
recommended that patients undergo a lens examination before or shortly
after initiation of lovastatin and annually thereafter. Homozygous
familial hypormholesterolemia: Lovastatin is less effective in this rare
condition, and appears to be more likely to raise serum transaminases in
these homozygous patients. Carcinogenesis: In animal studies,
increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas, and
pulmonary adenomas was noticed in mice receiving 312 times the
maximum recommended human dose; but no evidence of a tumorigenic
effect was observed in rats receiving 112.5 times the maximum
recommended human dose. (See TOXICOLOGY section of Product
Monograph.) Use In pregnancy: Lovastatin Is contraindlcated and
there are no data on its use in pregnancy. Because the HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors are able to decrease the synthesis of cholesterol and
possibly other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that are
essential components for fetal development, lovastatin may cause fetal
harm. Administer to women of childbearing age only when they are highly
unlikely to conceive. If patient becomes pregnant, apprise her of potential
hazard to the fetus, and discontinue drug. Nursing mothers: Whether
lovastatin is excreted in human milk is unknown. However, because of the
potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking
lovastatin should discontinue nursing (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness have not been established;
therefore lovastatin therapy in children is not yet recommended. Use in
patients with impaired renal function: Exercise caution if renal
function impairment is significant.
Drug InteractIons
Concomitant therapy with other lipid-lowering agelnts:

additive. Exercise caution when coadministering with other lipid-lowering
agents, particularly gemfibrozil and niacin (see WARNINGS). Coumarin
anticoagulants: Carefully monitor prothrombin time in patients on con-
comitant coumarin anticoagulants, because occasional bleeding and/or
increases in prothrombin time have been reported. Di9oxin: Digoxin
plasma concentrations were not affected by coadministration of lovastatin
in hypercholesterolemic patients. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs:
No clinically relevant interaction reported in patients on concomitant
lovastatin. Antipyrine: Lovastatin had no effects on the pharmacokinetics
of antipyrine. Other concomitant therapy: In clinical studies, lovastatin
was used with verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem, a number of diuretics
and NSAIDs, without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
Drug/laboratory test interactions: Lovastatin may elevate creatine
phosphokiriase and transaminase levels (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In
differential diagnosis of chest pain in patients on lovastatin, determine
cardiac and non-cardiac fractions of these enzymes.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Lovastatin was found generally well tolerated, and adverse reactions
usually mild and transient, based on experience in over 1,300 patients
(about 800 treated for 1 year and over 250 for 2 years or more). In
controlled clinical trials, less than 1% were withdrawn due to adverse
experiences attributable to lovastatin. Adverse experiences reported in
controlled clinical studies are shown in table below.

Laboratory tests: Marked persistent increases of serum transaminases
noted (see WARNINGS). About 11% of patients had elevations of CPK
levels of at least twice normal value, attributable to the non-cardiac
fraction of CPK, on one or more occasions. Muscle pain or dysfunction
was not usually reported; however, myopathy with large increases in CPK
occasionally occurred (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Nervous
system: In the single case of peripheral neuropathy reported, relationship
to lovastatin was uncertain. Intensive neurological testing in over 30
patients showed no evidence or neurotoxic effects of lovastatin.
Ophthalmological observations: (see PRECAUTIONS).
SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE
In the few cases of accidental overdosage reported, no patients had any
specific symptoms and all recovered without sequelae. Maximum dosage
taken was 1.04 g (fifty-two 20 mg tablets). Treatment should be
symptomatic and supportive, liver function should be monitored, and
appropriate therapy instituted. Dialyzability of lovastatin and its
metabolites in man, is unknown.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Before initiating lovastatin, place patient on standard cholesterol-lowering
diet, and continue on this diet during treatment. If appropriate, implement
a program of weight control and exercise. Usual starting dose:
20 mg/day, as a single dose with evening meal (such a regimen has been
shown to be more effective than morning dosing). Make dosage
adjustments, if necessary, at intervals of not less than 4 weeks, to
maximum of 80 mg daily, given as a single dose or divided between
morning and evening meals. (Twice daily dosing tends to be slightly more
effective than single daily dosing.) Monitor cholesterol levels
periodically and consider reducing dosage if cholesterol levels
fall below targeted range, as recommended by the Canadian
Consensus Conference on Cholesterol.
Concomitant therapy: Cholesterol-lowering effects of lovastatin and
cholestyramine appear additive. For use with other lipid-lowering agents,
see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.
