comparing the long term effects of isolated hip
strengthening, quadriceps-based training and free
physical activity for patellofemoral pain syndrome
(anterior knee pain)

Abstract

Background: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), also known as Anterior Knee Pain, is a common cause of
recurrent or chronic knee pain. The etiology is considered to be multifactorial but is not completely understood. At
the current time the leading theory is that pathomechanics in the patellofemoral joint leads to PFPS. Traditionally,
conservative treatment has focused on improving strength and timing in the quadriceps muscles. In recent years,
evidence has been accumulating to support the importance of hip control and strengthening in PFPS. Two recent
studies have shown promising results for hip strengthening as an isolated treatment for PFPS. The aim of this
randomised contolled trial (RCT) is to compare isolated hip strengthening to traditional quadriceps-based training
and a control group with free physical activity.
Methods/Design: An observer-blinded RCT will be performed. We intend to include 150 patients aged 16–40 years,
referred from primary care practitioners to the department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Kristiansand,
Norway for PFPS with more than three months duration. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised
using opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to one of three groups: isolated hip strengthening, quadriceps
based training, or a control group (free physical activity). All groups will receive standardized information about PFPS
formulated with the intention to minimize fear avoidance and encourage self-mastery of symptoms. Standardized
exercises will be performed under supervision of a study physiotherapist once per week in addition to home
training two times per week for a total of six weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the Anterior Knee Pain
Score (AKPS) at three and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures will include Visual analogue scale (VAS) for
pain, hip abductor and quadriceps strength, the generic EuroQol (EQ-5D), Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), Knee
self-efficacy score and Tampa score for Kinesiophobia.

Discussion: This trial will help to elucidate the role of hip and quadriceps strengthening in the treatment of PFPS.
Information as to the role of anxiety and depression, kinesiophobia and self-efficacy will be collected, also as
regards prognosis and response to exercise therapy.

Background
Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), also known as
Anterior Knee Pain, can be defined as pain behind or
around the knee cap (patella), provoked during loading
of the knee in flexion or extension, in the absence of
other specific pathology of the knee joint [1]. It is one of
the most common causes of pain in the lower extremity,
with the reported prevalence ranging from 7% to as high
as 26%, although the true incidence and prevalence of
PFPS have not been adequately studied [2-4]. Despite
being commonly regarded as a benign and self-limiting
condition, several long-term studies show that as many
as 73-96% of patients with PFPS have continued pain
longer than four years after diagnosis [5-8].

The etiology of PFPS is not completely understood,
and is considered to be multifactorial [1,9]. The primary
theory at the current time is that patellofemoral malalign-
ment and maltracking (pathomechanics) result in PFPS
[10]. Suggested mechanisms causing PFPS are overload,
patellar maltracking/malalignment and imbalances
in
muscle strength and contraction [1,9,11,12]. Factors such
as fear avoidance (kinesiophobia) and catastrophizing
may be contributing factors [13-15]. Central neuro-
logical mechanisms such as sensitization or neuropathic
pain also could be possible mechanisms influencing the
pain experienced in some patients [16-18].

Several studies have underlined the importance of the
quadriceps muscle function including timing and/or
activity of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) [19-21]
although the evidence is conflicting [22]. Traditionally,
conservative treatment principles have therefore focused
mainly on training strength, balance and timing in quadri-
ceps muscles, especially VMO [1,23,24], often in combin-
ation with other modalities such as stretching, taping, and
orthotics [1,23,25]. There is some evidence for a short-
term effect of quadriceps-based training [23]. However,
long term results after quadriceps-based training may be
poorer, with up to 80% still reporting pain at five-year
follow-up in one study [6].

In recent years there has become an increased focus
on the importance of hip strength and control in PFPS.
Several studies indicate that women with PFPS have al-
tered hip kinematics during more demanding loading
such as running, jumping and landing [26-28]. Studies
using dynamic MRI suggest
increased femoral
internal rotation results in increased lateral patellar dis-
placement and resultant increased stress in the patellofe-
moral joint [29,30]. Women with PFPS have been found
to be weaker in hip abduction and external rotation
compared to healthy controls, although a recent system-
atic review raises the question as to the causality of the
relationship [31,32].

that

More recent studies have reported promising results
when strengthening hip abduction and external rotation

on women with PFPS are used prior to [33], or in
addition to [34-36], quadriceps-based training, and a re-
cent systematic review concludes that proximal exercises
are effective in treating PFPS [37]. A newly published
large RCT compared quadriceps-based training to hip
and core strengthening and found no significant differ-
ences in outcome, but an earlier effect of proximal ex-
ercises [38]. Posterolateral hip strengthening has only
recently been studied as an isolated treatment
for
PFPS, and results are promising [39,40]. Much is still
unclear
regarding the role of proximal muscular
strength and control in PFPS. Most published studies
limita-
are relatively small and have methodological
tions. A newly published systematic review concludes
with the need for more research to further evaluate the
possible effects of different exercise therapy modalities
on PFPS [41].

Aims
The aim of this study is to compare the effect of isolated
traditional quadriceps
hip strengthening exercises,
based exercises and free physical activity in patients
with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The primary out-
come is the Anterior Knee Pain Score (AKPS) at three
months and one year. Our null-hypothesis is that there
is no difference between the three groups for primary or
secondary outcomes, measured at three months and
one year.

Methods/Design
Trial design
This is an observer-blinded randomised controlled trial
(RCT) with first primary endpoint at three months, and
second primary endpoint at one year (Figure 1: diagram).

Ethics
Ethics approval for this study has been received from
the Ethics Committee Health Region Southeast, Norway.

Participants
Participants will be recruited from general practitioners,
chiropractors, manual therapists and from departments
of orthopedic surgery, rheumatology and physical medi-
cine and rehabilitation. To increase awareness of the
trial, potential sources of referral will receive regular
written information on the ongoing trial, and general
practitioners will be invited to attend lectures on knee
complaints with a focus on the current study.

All potential participants will be screened to determine
their eligibility according to the following inclusion and
exclusion criteria. For inclusion, patients should be 16–40
years of age and have at least three months history of
peri- or retropatellar pain with worst pain intensity dur-
ing previous week of VAS 3 or more. The pain should

be provoked by at least two of the following activities:
Stair ascent or descent, hopping, running, prolonged
sitting, squatting or kneeling. On clinical exam, pain
should be present during one of the following: Com-
pression of the patella, palpation of the patellar facets.
In patients with bilateral pain the worst knee will be
included, and presence of bilateral pain will be docu-
mented. One specialist in Physical Medicine and Re-
habilitation (PM&R) will perform clinical examinations
of all patients. Possible candidates will have a plain
x-ray and MRI of the knee joint performed,
if this
has not already been performed within the previous
six months.

Exclusion criteria include clinical, x-ray and MRI
findings indicative of meniscal or other intra-articular
injury to or increased laxity of cruciate or
injury,
collateral
ligaments, or other pathology including:
osteoarthritis, Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding-Larsen-
Johanssen syndrome,
jumpers knee, or of significant
knee joint effusion, significant pain from hip or lumbar
spine on clinical evaluation, with potential for causing
referred pain to the knee, or hindering the patient’s
ability to perform the prescribed exercises, recurrent
patellar subluxation or dislocation, previous surgery to
the knee joint, NSAID or cortisone use over an ex-
tended period of time, having suffered trauma to the

knee joint judged during clinical evaluation to have a
significant effect on the presenting clinical condition.
Patients having received physiotherapy or other similar
treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome within the
previous three months will also be excluded.

Randomisation
Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and consent to
take part in the trial after they have received the
standardized oral and written information, will be
randomized to receive hip strengthening (H), quadriceps-
based training (Q), or control group (C). Sealed opaque
randomization envelopes with a study-specific patient
number will be supplied by an external statistician.
The randomization sequence is computer-generated
with randomization blocks of a variable size which is
unknown to any of the research team. A nurse not
otherwise involved in the research study will take the
sealed opaque numbered envelopes in order, by num-
ber, and deliver the correct envelope to the treating
physiotherapist. The envelope contains a piece of
paper which is labeled with the same patient specific
number, plus the group assignment (H, Q or C). The
group assignments will be communicated for the pur-
pose of data analysis in coded form. The code will only
be revealed when the data analysis is complete.

Interventions
Standardized information
All groups receive standardized oral and written infor-
mation from the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
(PM&R) specialist at the time of inclusion to the study
focusing on understanding of the etiology of PFPS, and
especially reassurance as to the benign nature of the
condition. The information is formulated with the
intention to minimize fear avoidance and encourage
self-mastery of symptoms. Advice will be given to stay
physically active without excessively provoking knee
pain, and types of potential activities will be explored
with the patient. Participants will be asked to refrain
from seeking other forms of treatment (eg. physiother-
apy, shoe inserts,
laser, etc.) during the
study. The same written and oral information will be
repeated by the study physiotherapists at randomization.
Standardization of information will be achieved by regular
meetings for the research staff before initiation of the
study and throughout the study period.

Hip strengthening protocol
The hip strengthening exercises consist of side-lying hip
abduction, hip external rotation (clam-shell) and prone
hip extension. The exercise positions are based on previ-
ous studies of hip strengthening [34,39,40], and are
chosen to maximally isolate the hip abductors and exter-
nal rotators, respectively. Initial dosage of 10 × 3 will be
used, with a progression up to a maximum 20 × 3, as
previous studies on isolate hip strengthening have used a
high-repetition approach [39,40], which is also sup-
ported by studies examining dose–response relationship
in PFPS exercises [42]. Additional resistance will there-
after be provided by weights or elastic tubing if neces-
sary. One session per week will be performed under
supervision of the physiotherapist, with two additional
sessions performed as home sessions, for a total of three
sessions per week. To avoid focus on pain and pain be-
haviours, dosage will be adjusted on an individualized
basis once weekly by the physiotherapist according to
level of function, based on principles for operant condi-
tioning [43]. This entails setting quotas of exercise below
the patients’ limit of tolerance as opposed to training up
to the pain threshold. A dosage will be chosen in which
the last repetitions are difficult while still allowing the
patient to maintain high quality of movement control
throughout the entire program.

Quadriceps-based training
The quadriceps exercise regime is based on previous
studies [40,44], and chosen to maximally isolate the
quadriceps muscles while still approximating a trad-
itional quadriceps strengthening regime. The exercises
will consist of straight leg raises in the supine position,

prone terminal knee extensions (from 10° flexion to
full extension) and a mini-squat (45° flexion) with the
back supported against the wall (to reduce stabilizing
requirements from the hip muscles). The timing,
duration and progression of the exercise protocol will
be matched to the hip strengthening group using
the same principles for individualized dosage of ex-
ercises described over, adjusted once weekly by the
physiotherapist.

Control group (free physical activity)
The control group will receive the same standardized
information and advice from the specialist as the exer-
cise groups at study inclusion. At randomization, the
control group will meet with the study physiotherapist
and will again receive standardized information about
PFSS and advice about choice and dosage of activities.
They will receive no prescribed exercise regime but are
encouraged to be physically active according to their
own wishes. The purpose of the control group is to as-
sess whether specific hip strengthening or quadriceps-
based training is better than free physical activity. This
is important if there is no difference in effectiveness be-
tween hip strengthening and quadriceps-based training
and also for assessing whether any of the specific train-
ing regimens are better than free physical activity.

Outcome assessment
Baseline data will
include gender, age, height, weight,
body-mass index, level of physical activity, unilateral vs.
bilateral symptoms, duration of symptoms, work status,
whether on sick leave or disability, highest level of educa-
tion achieved, use of pain or anti-inflammatory medica-
tion, a plain film x-ray including skyline view, and MRI
examination of
(previous examination
within 6 months of baseline will be accepted, assuming no
significant change in symptoms has occurred during this
period). We will also record the Beighton score with re-
gard to joint mobility [45].

the knee joint

Blinded observers will assess all participants at base-
line, three months and one year after inclusion. Pain and
function, health related quality of
life, activity level,
strength, self-efficacy, anxiety and depression, number of
pain regions, and kinesiophobia will be assessed by stan-
dardised, validated questionnaires at each time point. At
six weeks, a mid-term assessment will be performed in-
cluding pain and function (AKPS and VAS) and strength
measurements. The treating physiotherapists will be
blinded to all baseline data. Due to the nature of the
study, blinding of the patients and physiotherapists to
the intervention is not possible, but patients’ expecta-
tions about the effectiveness of each intervention will be
assessed at baseline.

Primary outcome measure
The main hypothesis in the present study will be exam-
ined at three and 12 months using the Anterior Knee
Pain Scale (AKPS) as the primary outcome measure.
This is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 13 ques-
tions to assess severity of pain and disability [46]. It has
been validated for use in this patient population [47].
The categories within each question are weighted, and
the responses are summed for an overall index where
100 represents perfect function and 0 represents worst
possible function. The minimal clinically important dif-
ference (MCID) was reported to be 10 points in a previ-
ous study [47]. This questionnaire will be translated to
Norwegian and validated according to standard scientific
procedures with approval from Kujala et al. [46].

Secondary outcome measures
Include a range of standardised, generic self-report mea-
sures including VAS for pain, global score of change,
step-down test, strength and endurance testing, quality
self-
life, kinesiophobia, anxiety and depression,
of
efficacy, number of pain regions, and activity level.

A 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to
measure pain, where 0 corresponds to no pain and 10
corresponds to worst imaginable pain. The scale is vali-
dated for use with patellofemoral pain [47]. We will rec-
ord VAS for assessment of usual pain the past week
(VAS-U) and worst pain during the past week (VAS-W).
For these measurements a MCID of 2 has been reported
[47].

An 18-point Likert scale for measuring patients’ global
assessment of change compared with baseline will be
carried out at three and 12 months. The scale ranges
from −9 (maximum deterioration) to +9 (maximum im-
provement) [48].

According to Loudon et al. [49] the step-down (from a
20 cm step) is the only functional test which discrimi-
nates between PFSS patients and normal controls. The
step down as performed according to standardised in-
struction will be used to quantify changes in patients’
function. The measure is number of repetitions in 30
seconds.

Isometric strength will be measured for hip abduction,
hip external rotation and knee extension. Strength will
be measured with a force gauge (MuscleLab Force
Gauge 300 kg) using stabilizing straps to ensure correct
positioning of
the patient, according to the current
standard for studies of this type. Standardized positions
and procedures are based on techniques proposed by
Caldwell et al. [50] and Thorborg et al. [51]. Research
personnel will be trained in the procedures by qualified
researchers at University of Agder, Norway.

A novel test for hip abduction endurance has been de-
veloped for use in this study. A parallel article will be

published quantifying normal values for this test, values
for PFPS patients (men and women), its inter- and intra-
rater reliability, validity compared to strength testing
with force measurer, and its predictive value for clinical
response to hip strengthening in PFPS patients. Testing
is carried out in side-lying position with a 5 kg weight
around the ankle of the upper leg, which is in 0-10° hip
extension and abducted to 30° above the horizontal
plane. Time successfully held in target area is measured
in seconds. All participants in the study will be tested at
baseline, six weeks, three and 12 months. Parallel with
the RCT, normative data will be collected in a group of
75 healthy controls of both sexes from 16–40 years old.
Euro-Qol – 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a questionnaire
used to measure health related problems and quality of
life [52]. The questionnaire is widely used both inter-
nationally and in Norwegian [53]. EQ-5D-5 L includes
five questions about mobility, usual activities, self care,
pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression, each
has five possible answers. The results are translated to a
single summary index value through the use of a table
[54]. In addition the subject scores his/her overall health
on a 0–100 scale (EQ-VAS).

The Tampa scale for kinesophobia (TSK) is a 13 –item
questionnaire aimed at the assessment of fear of move-
ment/re-injury. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert
scale with alternatives ranging from strongly disagree (0)
to strongly agree (4). This gives a possible total score
range from 0 to 52. The TSK is translated to Norwegian
and a cross-cultural adaptation and validation study
showed satisfactory validity and reliability in a Norwe-
gian population with sciatica [55].

The Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) is a symp-
tom inventory which measures symptoms of anxiety, de-
pression and somatisation, originally consisting of 58
items [56]. Comparisons of different versions of the
HSCL indicate that a shorter version (HSCL-10) perform
almost as well as the full version, also in the Norwegian
population [57]. The scale for each question includes 4
categories of response ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4
(extremely). The average HSCL score is calculated by
dividing the total score by ten (number of items). In ac-
cordance with recommendations by the Regional Ethical
Committee, patients who score >2.00 on HSCL-10 (with
suspected clinical depression or anxiety disorder that
warrants treatment) will receive an offer of referral to
psychologist or psychiatrist for follow-up.

Self-efficacy will be measured using the Knee Self-
Efficacy Score (K-SES). This score is originally developed
in both Swedish and English for measuring self-efficacy
in patients with anterior cruciate injury [58] and will be
translated to Norwegian for the purpose of this study. K-
SES is a self-administered instrument consisting of in
total four sections in which patients score how certain

Hott et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2015) 16:40 

Page 6 of 8

they are about specific activities currently and in the fu-
ture. The K-SES has not been validated for use in PFSS
patients, but we consider that it is preferable to a more
general self-efficacy score.

An adaptation of the Standardized Nordic Question-
naire [59] will be used to register the number of painful
areas. This modified questionnaire is used in a recent
Norwegian study [60] which showed a high prevalence
of patients with more than one pain site in a Norwegian
population, and that there was a strong correlation be-
tween increasing number of pain sites and decreasing
functional ability.

Activity level will be monitored using a multi-sensor
which includes an accelerometer (SenseWear Pro2 Arm-
band) using the techniques validated in a study by Bernt-
sen et al. [61]. Study participants will wear the monitor
continuously for one week at baseline, three months and
12 months follow-up.

Compliance will be registered weekly by the treating
physiotherapist, recording number of completed home
sessions and sessions with the physiotherapist. We will
also register use of pain medication including non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sick leave from work,
and whether the patient has sought other treatment
(type and number).

Sample size
The power and sample size calculations are based on a
one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model at
follow-up that does not take into account adjustment for
the baseline values. Based on previous studies, standard
deviation of AKPS and VAS is assumed to be 13.5 and
2.25, respectively. MCID for AKPS or VAS is set at 10
and 2, respectively [47]. With these assumptions 27 pa-
tients are required in each of the treatment groups (in
total 81 patients for all three groups) to obtain 80% stat-
istical power with 5% significance level for AKPS, and 19
in each group for VAS. To take into account possible
missing data or drop-outs, a minimum of 35 patients
will be included in each group. We will therefore include
a minimum of 105 patients in total in this study but in-
tend to include as many as 50 in each group (150 in
total) to improve the power of the study considering the
assumed heterogeneity of the study population.

Planned statistical analysis
All eligible patients, regardless of their compliance with
the protocol (analysis by intention-to-treat) will be in-
cluded in the main analysis.

To assess the primary endpoints of the study after
three months and one year the differences between the
three treatment groups will be analysed with an Analysis
of Covariance model using the baseline value as one of
the covariates. Assumptions of the model will be checked.

To analyse the time course repeated measures will be ana-
lysed using linear mixed models. The influence of factors
including compliance, muscle strength, psychological fac-
tors, joint hypermobility and baseline pain levels will also
be examined with regard to treatment response.

A blinded statistical analysis and review of the out-
come data is planned [62]. Only after the writing com-
there will be no
mittee members have agreed that
further changes in the interpretation, the randomisation
code will be broken, and the manuscript of the final
study will be published.

Discussion
PFPS is a common cause of knee pain in which there are
significant levels of recurring or chronic problems. The
etiology is not completely understood, and heterogeneity
and existence of subgroups has been proposed by many
as an explanation for varying results of treatment [1,63].
Traditionally the focus has been on quadriceps strength-
ening, often as a part of a multimodal approach [23].
Two recent studies have shown promising results for
isolated hip strengthening as a method of treating PFPS
[39,40]. These studies are relatively small and have
methodological weaknesses. A newly published multi-
center RCT found no significant difference in outcomes
between hip and core strengthening compared with knee
exercises [38]. The current study aiming for a sample
size of 150 patients will be one of the largest RCTs in
this field. The inclusion of a control group receiving
standardized information and free physical activity is im-
portant. Two recent studies show a superior effect of
specific exercises compared to patient education [64,65],
but there is a need for more knowledge regarding the
effectiveness of specific training compared to patient
education and patient-directed free physical activity. In
addition, other possible contributing factures, such as
anxiety and depression, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy and
health-related life quality, will be assessed. Existing data
on the relevance of these factors in PFPS is limited but
may be of importance with respect to response to spe-
cific exercise therapy.
