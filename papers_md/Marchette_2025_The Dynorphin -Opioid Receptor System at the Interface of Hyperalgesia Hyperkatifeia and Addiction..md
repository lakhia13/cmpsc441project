Abstract
Purpose of Review  Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, accompanied by negative emotional 
states (hyperkatifeia) and heightened pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. Both hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia 
are integral components of substance use disorders, negatively impacting treatment and recovery. The underlying neurobio-
logical mechanisms of hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia involve alterations of brain reward and stress circuits, including the 
dynorphin/κ-opioid receptor (KOR) system. The dynorphin/KOR system modulates pain perception, negative affect, and 
addictive behaviors. Here, we review the preclinical evidence of dynorphin/KOR signaling in opioid withdrawal-induced 
hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia.
Recent Findings  In opioid dependence models, pharmacological and genetic interventions of the dynorphin/KOR system 
attenuate somatic and motivational signs of withdrawal and addictive-like behaviors, highlighting its therapeutic potential. 
Understanding the intricate interplay between dynorphin/KOR signaling, hyperalgesia, hyperkatifeia, and addiction offers 
novel insights into treatment strategies for opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders.
Summary  Further research is needed to elucidate precise mechanisms of the sexual dimorphism of dynorphin/KOR signal-
ing and identify targeted interventions to mitigate hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia and facilitate recovery from addiction.

Introduction

Drug and alcohol addiction are major contributors to disa-
bility-adjusted life years throughout the world. For example, 
the prevalence of alcohol use disorder was the highest of all 
substance use disorders (1320.8 per 100,000 people), fol-
lowed by opioid (353.0 per 100,000 people) and cannabis 
(289.7 per 100,000 people) use disorders [1]. Opioid use

disorder, in particular, afflicts over 30 million individuals 
(or 0.6% of the world’s population) annually, with a similar 
prevalence in men and women (World Drug Report 2023; 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: https:// datau 
nodc. un. org/; accessed May 16, 2024). Opioid use disorder 
can be defined as a compulsion to seek and take opioids, the 
loss of control over intake, and the emergence of a negative 
affect state during withdrawal [2, 3]. It can also be consid-
ered within an heuristic framework that consists of three 
stages, with three domains of dysfunction and three neuro-
circuitries [4–9].

Hyperalgesia  and  hyperkatifeia  are  well-documented 
symptoms of both acute and prolonged opioid withdrawal. 
These  symptoms  reflect  opponent  processes  that  hold 
motivational significance [3]. Opioid withdrawal-induced 
hyperalgesia and opioid withdrawal-induced hyperkatifeia 
are clinical phenomena whereby patients who chronically 
use opioids and individuals with opioid use disorder present 
higher sensitivity and lower tolerance to painful stimuli and 
greater emotional pain [2]. The International Association for 
the Study of Pain defines hyperalgesia as greater pain from

a stimulus that normally provokes pain, whereas allodynia 
refers to pain that is experienced from stimuli that normally 
do not provoke pain (https:// www. iasp- pain. org/ resou rces/  
termi nology/; accessed May 16, 2024). Hyperalgesia and 
allodynia can co-occur in the context of opioid withdrawal. 
For simplicity, the present review uses the term “hyperalge-
sia” to encompass sensitized pain responses. Hyperkatifeia, 
derived from the Greek katifeia for dejection or negative 
emotional state, encompasses the hyper-negative emotional 
state that is observed during withdrawal, characterized by 
dysphoria, anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and emo-
tional pain [10].

Hyperalgesia is a common response to chronic opioid use 
in humans, with tolerance, and even sign-reversal occur-
ring in the presence of opioids [11–14]. Importantly, opi-
oids also alleviate emotional pain, which is a key aspect of 
hyperkatifeia and a driving force for the withdrawal/negative 
affect stage of the addiction cycle. Chronic opioid use leads 
to reduced effectiveness for chronic emotional pain due to 
withdrawal and tolerance. Indeed, there is a significant con-
tribution of negative affect to the perception of “physical 
pain” and a significant contribution of “physical pain” to 
negative affect (see [15]). Under this conceptual framework, 
we and others have hypothesized that it is the pain and mis-
ery of hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia that drive up the dose 
requirement during chronic pain treatment [3, 16].

Hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia are complex constructs 
that are modulated by biopsychosocial factors. The focus 
of this review is the potential of dynorphin as a biologi-
cal mediator of these constructs as evidenced in preclinical 
research. We also broadly review the state-of-the-art clinical 
evidence of hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia before discussing 
the preclinical literature.

Clinical Evidence of Hyperalgesia

Opioids are powerful and effective drugs for relieving pain 
in humans [17], but opioids are less effective with repeated 
use, such as for the treatment of chronic pain conditions, par-
ticularly neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and low-back pain. 
As a result, the efficacy of long-term treatment with opioids 
is under significant debate, and the risk of prolonged opioid 
treatment outweighs the benefits in clinical practice [18–20]. 
In addition, both physical (somatic) symptoms and hard-to-
reverse emotional symptoms are observed with established 
and continuous opioid therapy [3, 7, 10, 18, 21].

Withdrawal from chronic opioid use produces hyper-
algesia, an effect that is most prominent in patients with 
opioid use disorder than in patients with chronic pain [2]. 
Hyperalgesia has long been observed in people with a 
history of opioid addiction [22–24]. Heroin users show 
greater pain sensitivity while in acute withdrawal and in 

protracted abstinence [23, 25–27]. Patients in methadone-
maintenance therapy have low pain tolerance and report 
more pain [28–33]. In these individuals, pain is a main 
trigger of relapse or continued opioid use [28, 34]. Moreo-
ver, although buprenorphine maintenance therapy may ini-
tially improve hyperalgesia, this improvement is not sus-
tained after prolonged exposure [35]. A recent metanalysis 
showed that patients with chronic opioid use (methadone, 
buprenorphine) exhibited lower tolerance to pain, and that 
tolerance to pain was lower right before a methadone dose 
than it was immediately after a methadone dose [24].

Individuals with opioid use disorder who underwent a 
1-month detoxication program exhibited a shorter latency 
and lower tolerance in a cold pressor test [36]. Former opi-
oid-dependent patients in abstinence (6–38 months) still 
exhibited abnormal negative emotion in response to the 
presentation of noxious stimuli [31], thus underscoring the 
importance of the aversive aspect of pain over the inten-
sity of stimuli. An interaction between the sensorial com-
ponent of pain (i.e., nociception) and negative emotional 
aspect of pain was observed in individuals who were in 
acute withdrawal (24–72 h) from opioids or in protracted 
abstinence (30 months), in which negative emotion exac-
erbated hyperalgesia and caused a further increase in pain 
sensitivity [27].

Studies showed that non-opioid-dependent individuals 
who underwent acute exposure to opioids also exhibited 
hyperalgesia upon the cessation of opioid administration 
[37–39] or upon the precipitation of withdrawal with an 
opioid receptor antagonist [40], observations that highlight 
the rapid recruitment of opponent processes that underlie 
complex analgesia/hyperalgesia responses to opioids.

Pain  neurotransmission  is  modulated  by  a  balance 
between ascending and descending systems. The ascend-
ing system integrates sensory inputs from primary affer-
ents  (the  dorsal  root  ganglion  and  spinal  cord)  to  the 
somatosensory cortex through two major pathways: spi-
nothalamic pathway and spino-reticulo-thalamic pathway. 
The  descending  system,  when  activated,  inhibits  pain 
responses [41]. Such a descending system is composed 
of projections from the periaqueductal gray (PAG) to the 
rostral ventromedial medulla to the spinal cord [42]. The 
descending system can be activated or inhibited by several 
cortical and subcortical structures, such as the extended 
amygdala, and is modulated at least partially by endog-
enous opioid peptides [43]. Opioid withdrawal-induced 
hyperalgesia is likely mediated centrally because a periph-
erally restricted opioid receptor antagonist did not pre-
cipitate hyperalgesia [44,  45]. Consistent with the cen-
tral modulation hypothesis, both central sensitization and 
descending pain modulation were affected by opioids in 
individuals with hyperalgesia [38, 46].

Clinical Evidence of Hyperkatifeia

Hyperkatifeia is dissociable from somatic signs of with-
drawal and other psychiatric disorders and was described 
as early as 1880 by Rossbach [47]: “When dependence on 
opioids finally becomes an illness of itself, opposite effects 
like restlessness, sleep disturbance, hyperesthesia, neu-
ralgia and irritability become manifest.” Historically, the 
terms “withdrawal” and “dependence” have been defined 
differently across various contexts. Withdrawal refers to 
abstinence from or the cessation of chronic drug use, typi-
cally marked by signs and symptoms that are opposite to 
acute effects of the drug [3].

Dependence  is  defined  as  the  onset  of  a  withdrawal 
syndrome when drug use is stopped. According to this 
definition, any drug, even those without addiction poten-
tial, can produce dependence. This concept evolved into 
the definition of physical dependence, an intense physi-
cal disturbance upon discontinuation of drug use. Physi-
cal withdrawal syndrome typically presents as opposite 
effects to that caused by acute administrations of the drug. 
For example, opioid withdrawal causes pupillary dilation, 
while opioid intoxication leads to pupillary constriction. 
Psychological dependence was later defined as a “condi-
tion in which a drug produces a feeling of satisfaction 
and a psychic drive that require periodic or continuous 
administration of the drug to produce pleasure or to avoid 
discomfort” [48]. However, both somatic and behavioral 
symptoms are driven by physiological changes in the body 
and brain. It is argued that symptoms that are associated 
with protracted hyperkatifeia hold greater motivational 
significance for opioid seeking than the somatic signs of 
withdrawal [3].

This  thesis  is  supported  by  the  strong  correlation 
between dysphoria and spontaneous opioid withdrawal 
[49]. In studies of heroin-dependent patients undergoing 
detoxification, the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone 
increased both somatic signs of withdrawal and dysphoria 
in a dose-dependent manner [49, 50]. These findings were 
further supported by community sample studies, which 
indicated that among individuals with untreated opioid use 
disorder, withdrawal was perceived as the determining fac-
tor in maintaining opioid use and delaying treatment [51]. 
The author proposed a withdrawal catastrophizing scale as 
an important clinical measure of hyperkatifeia [52].

A conceptual framework was developed to explain the 
neural systems thought to mediate hyperkatifeia and drive 
the motivational aspect of the opponent processes involved 
in  excessive  opioid  use.  This  framework  involves  the 
downregulation of brain reward circuitry within the sys-
tem and the recruitment of brain stress circuitry between 
systems [6, 53]. Within-system neuroadaptation refers to 

the process where the primary cellular response element 
to the drug within a specific neurochemical circuit adapts 
to counteract the effects of the drug. In contrast, between-
systems neuroadaptation describes changes in which a dif-
ferent circuit (i.e., stress or antireward circuit) is activated 
by the reward circuit. The persistence of these opposing 
effects after the drug is removed is evidenced by the nega-
tive emotional withdrawal syndrome.

Consistent with this hyperkatifeia framework, imaging 
evidence points to an overlap in circuitry that underlies 
the stress response, reward, and major depressive disor-
der. Acute stress changes global cortical connectivity and 
increases striatal connectivity with cortical regions that 
express genes previously linked to imaging abnormalities 
in major depression. These regions are abundant in μ- and 
κ-opioid receptors [54].

Neurocircuitry of Hyperalgesia 
and Hyperkatifeia (Pre‑Clinical)

In animal models, repeated opioid administration produces a 
long-lasting, gradual, and dose-dependent decrease in noci-
ceptive thresholds [55–61]. As with human studies, hyper-
algesia is a consequence of rapid opioid-induced neuroad-
aptations and can be observed after a single opioid exposure 
[62–64].

Opioid withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia has been shown 
to involve a facilitatory mechanism in a descending system, 
characterized by greater activity of the rostro ventromedial 
medulla [65, 66]. Recent studies that used immediate early 
gene expression markers as a proxy of neuronal activation 
found greater activity in several subcortical and midbrain 
regions during hyperalgesia in opioid withdrawal. Hyperal-
gesia that was precipitated by naloxone following a single 
morphine exposure increased Fos and Zif268 expression in 
the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) capsular and lat-
eral portions, and amygdalo-striatal transition zone, latero-
dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and lateral 
interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior com-
missure in the brain of male rats[67]. Oxycodone-dependent 
rats exhibited lower pain thresholds and an increase in Fos-
positive neurons in the PAG, CeA, locus coeruleus, paraven-
tricular nucleus of the thalamus, agranular insular cortex, 
BNST, and lateral habenula medial parvocellular region dur-
ing withdrawal [68]. In heroin-dependent mice, hyperalge-
sia was associated with higher Fos expression in the lateral 
hypothalamus, CeA, ventral tegmental area, parabrachial 
nucleus, dorsal raphe, and locus coeruleus [60].

Although the term hyperkatifeia was coined relatively 
recently  [10],  the  construct  builds  from  an  extensive 
body of literature on the manifestation of a negative emo-
tional state or negative affect that is associated with drug

withdrawal. Current evidence suggests that the extended 
amygdala  is  a  focal  point  in  neurocircuitry  that  medi-
ates hyperkatifeia [69]. Here, within- and between-sys-
tem neuroadaptations of brain reward and stress systems 
are hypothesized to drive negative emotional states [3]. 
Although not part of the extended amygdala, the PAG has 
reciprocal connections with the extended amygdala, and 
the PAG integrates negative emotions with autonomic, 
neuroendocrine, and immune responses [70] and partici-
pates in the integration of hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia 
[71].

Dynorphin and the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) have been 
implicated in an array of biological processes, including 
endocrine regulation [72], neuronal myelinization [73], and 
itch [74], among others. We review evidence of the involve-
ment of dynorphin/KOR system in domains that underlie 
hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia.

Dynorphin/KOR System

Dynorphins play a role in multiple functional pathways in 
the brain. They are encoded by the prodynorphin (Pdyn) 
gene that is translated into prodynorphin, a 26 kDa protein, 
which in turn is processed into big-dynorphin by prohor-
mone convertase 1. Big-dynorphin is further processed by 
prohormone convertase 2 in the presence of carboxypepti-
dase E to dynorphin A(1–17), dynorphin A(1–8), dynorphin 
B, α-neoendorphin, and leumorphin (reviewed by [75–78]). 
Prodynorphin-derived peptides bind preferentially to the 
KOR [79].

Prodynorphin is found in most brain structures and gener-
ally matches the KOR distribution. Prodynorphin is highly 
concentrated in the nucleus accumbens, whereas its concen-
tration in the thalamus is low. The KOR is highly expressed 
in cortical, limbic, and brainstem regions of the rodent brain. 
Particularly high densities are found in the basal anterior 
forebrain, including the claustrum, endopiriform cortex, 
olfactory tubercle, striatum (caudate putamen and nucleus 
accumbens), preoptic area, hypothalamus, and pituitary [80].
The KOR is a  Gi-coupled receptor that inhibits cell excit-
ability and neurotransmitter release [81]. The activation of 
KORs by dynorphin leads to lower dopamine transmission 
[82]. Electrophysiology evidence shows that KOR activation 
reduces γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate release 
in the nucleus accumbens [83, 84], glutamate release from 
the basolateral amygdala to the BNST [85], and glutamate 
release from the insular cortex to the substantia nigra [86]. 
In the CeA, the antagonism or genetic deletion of KORs 
enhanced GABA release that was caused by corticotropin-
releasing factor (CRF), suggesting that CRF activation pro-
motes dynorphin release and subsequent KOR activation, 
which modulates presynaptic GABA release [87].

Dynorphin and KOR: Pain

Several alterations of the dynorphin/KOR system have been 
identified in chronic pain. In the spinal cord, the intrath-
ecal administration of high doses of dynorphin produced 
allodynia in an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent 
manner [88, 89], whereas low doses of dynorphin and KOR 
agonists produced analgesia [90], an effect that was medi-
ated by adenylyl cyclase 3 [91]. Dynorphin knockout mice 
showed a faster return to normal nociceptive baseline after 
a peripheral nerve lesion [92], suggesting a pronociceptive 
role for dynorphin in chronic pain. κ-Opioid receptor antago-
nism also enhanced allodynia following sciatic nerve injury. 
The authors proposed that KOR blockade in the spinal cord 
shifts dynorphin signaling toward a pronociceptive, NMDA-
dependent mechanism [93].

Effects of dynorphin in pain conditions are influenced by 
sexual hormones. In a model of chronic inflammatory pain 
that was induced by Complete Freund’s Adjuvant adminis-
tration, hyperalgesia was higher in proestrus, and dynorphin 
expression was upregulated in the ipsilateral spinal cord in 
freely cycling females in diestrus and proestrus. The same 
study showed that prodynorphin expression was upregulated 
in the spinal cord in ovariectomized females and downregu-
lated in castrated males compared with intact males [94]. 
However,  in  the  absence  of  chronic  inflammatory  pain, 
systemic treatment with a KOR agonist produced analge-
sia in male but not female mice, and the lack of analgesia 
in females was estrogen-dependent [95]. The intrathecal 
administration of a KOR agonist induced greater analge-
sia in males and was estrous phase-dependent in females; 
in gonadectomized rats, estradiol enhanced analgesia and 
upregulated KOR expression in females but not males, and 
testosterone had no effect [90]. Further studies are needed to 
disentangle the role of estrogen in KOR-induced analgesia 
in acute and chronic pain.

Chronic pain recruits cortical and subcortical structures 
through ascending and descending pathways. In chronic pain 
models, there is higher KOR binding in the CeA [96–98]. 
The  administration  of  KOR  antagonists  systemically  or 
directly into the amygdala [97], anterior cingulate cortex 
[99], and nucleus accumbens shell [100] reversed the aver-
sive component of chronic pain, measured by a decrease in 
the consumption of, or motivation for, palatable substances 
(e.g., sucrose). Chronic pain upregulated KOR and dynor-
phin expression in the nucleus accumbens and midbrain 
and enhanced KOR agonist-induced aversion in male but 
not female mice. κ-Opioid receptor antagonism prevented 
pain-induced aversion in males only but reversed chronic 
pain-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in both 
sexes [101]. In female rats, chronic inflammatory pain led 
to anhedonia- and anxiety-like behavior, and KOR antago-
nism in the nucleus accumbens prevented the emergence of 

 
Current Addiction Reports (2025) 12:11

anxiety-like responses [102]. However, systemic adminis-
tration of the KOR antagonist JDtic failed to block condi-
tioned place aversion that was produced by visceral and ace-
tic acid-induced pain in mice [103]. In addition to its effects 
on motivation and negative affect in chronic pain models, 
KOR antagonism has been shown to reverse sciatic nerve 
ligation-induced deficits in total, non-rapid-eye-movement, 
and fragmented sleep [104].

One suggested mechanism for the effects of dynorphin 
and KORs in the emotional component of pain is the modu-
lation of dopamine transmission. This is evident in chronic 
pain models, where systemic KOR antagonism blocked the 
reduction of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in 
inflammatory pain [105]. However, KOR antagonism did not 
block lactic acid-induced elevations of brain reward thresh-
olds and the decrease in nucleus accumbens dopamine in 
rats [106].

In summary, despite some contradictory findings, the 
dynorphin/KOR  system  is  proposed  to  be  an  important 
mediator of negative affect that is associated with chronic 
pain. The pain modality and dependent variable that is used 
to measure negative affect are likely important, as well as the 
dynorphin neuron subcircuits' opposing actions [107, 108].

Dynorphin and KOR: Negative Affect

Plasma levels of dynorphin positively correlated with the 
severity of depression [109]. There is an extensive body of 
work on dysphoric effects of KOR activation and its involve-
ment in depression [110]. The short-acting KOR antagonist 
aticaprant is being developed for the treatment of anhedonia 
[111]. The development of KOR antagonists for the treat-
ment of depression is supported by intracranial self-stim-
ulation experiments. κ-Opioid receptor agonists elevated 
intracranial self-stimulation reward thresholds and decreased 
the function of the mesolimbic dopamine system [112–116]. 
κ-Opioid receptor agonists also induced conditioned place 
aversion [95, 117–119]. κ-Opioid receptor agonism-induced 
aversion is at least partially mediated by serotonin and dopa-
mine [114, 117, 118] and is less evident in females, an effect 
that is mediated by estrogen [95]. Anhedonic-like effects of 
the KOR agonist U50,488 were less evident in females, an 
effect that was associated with higher tyrosine hydroxylase, 
an enzyme that is essential for the production of dopamine, 
in the ventral tegmental area and differential patterns of 
brain activation, with upregulations in the paraventricular 
nucleus of the thalamus and BNST [115, 116].

Further evidence of the involvement of KORs in nega-
tive affect comes from models of stress-induced anhedonia. 
κ-Opioid receptor agonism activates the hypothalamic–pitui-
tary–adrenal axis, reflected by an increase in the release of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone, an increase 
in the phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptors, and Fos 

activation in the thalamus in female rats [120]. Dynorphin 
and phosphorylated KORs are upregulated in the ventral 
pallidum and inhibit GABAergic neurons to promote anhe-
donia-like behavior [121]. The KOR-mediated inhibition of 
glutamatergic projections from the claustrum to prelimbic 
cortex was sufficient to promote anhedonia-like behavior 
[122]. Deleterious effects of chronic social defeat can be 
prevented by treatment with the long-lasting KOR antago-
nist norbinaltorphimine [123]. κ-Opioid receptor antago-
nism also prevented working memory deficits in the face of 
a stressor in rhesus monkeys [124].

Dynorphin and KORs are also involved in anxiety-like 
behavior and fear responses. The genetic knockout of KORs 
selectively in dopaminergic neurons reduced anxiety-like 
behavior [125]. The deletion of KORs in the CeA and abla-
tion of dynorphin inputs to the CeA increased anxiety-like 
behavior and impaired conditioned threat discrimination 
[126]. Dynorphin transmission in the prefrontal cortex sup-
pressed defensive behaviors in response to threat [127]. 
κ-Opioid receptor stimulation in the caudal portion of the 
nucleus accumbens shell resulted in the greater inhibition 
of dopamine release and coincided with the emergence of 
avoidance behavior [128]. Threat generalization was modu-
lated by KORs in a dorsal raphe-to-ventral tegmental area 
projection-specific manner [129]. κ-Opioid receptors in the 
basolateral amygdala regulated anxiety-like behavior and 
mediated KOR agonist-induced aversion [130]. Upregula-
tion of the dynorphin/KOR system in the amygdala led to 
the emergence of depression-like behavior following chronic 
social defeat stress [123]. Altogether, these data suggest the 
involvement of a dynorphin/KOR system in the dorsal raphe 
to ventral tegmental area to nucleus accumbens shell and its 
reciprocal connection with the CeA and basolateral amyg-
dala in the modulation of negative affect.

Dynorphin and KOR: Drug Addiction

It has been hypothesized that the activation of KORs leads 
to the negative emotional states that are associated with drug 
withdrawal [131], pain, and particularly pain associated with 
acute withdrawal. More specific to opioid dependence, ani-
mal studies have demonstrated region-specific increases in 
dynorphin levels after the passive administration of mor-
phine or heroin in the brain [132, 133] and spinal cord [56, 
134, 135]. The precursor of dynorphin, prodynorphin, was 
upregulated after heroin self-administration [136–138], and 
dynorphin was also upregulated during the anticipation of 
heroin self-administration [139].

The genetic deletion of KORs prevented the appearance 
of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs and mitigated 
social interaction deficits observed during withdrawal in 
male mice [140]. Administering norbinaltorphimine, a selec-
tive antagonist of KOR, 5 h before naltrexone-precipitated 

11  Page 6 of 14

withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats decreased certain 
signs of opioid withdrawal during a 30-min withdrawal ses-
sion and lowered the subsequent conditioned place aversion 
to the withdrawal chamber 2 days later [141]. Intraventricu-
lar and intra-dorsal hippocampus infusions of norbinaltor-
phimine blocked naloxone-induced conditioned place aver-
sion when given before naloxone [142]. However, opposite 
effects were observed when norbinaltorphimine was admin-
istered before morphine exposure, and they coincided with 
a decrease in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens 
[143].

The KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine has been shown 
to improve myriad opioid withdrawal-related behaviors. 
Administered systemically or intra-nucleus accumbens shell, 
norbinaltorphimine reduced the development of addiction-
like behavior and anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal 
from heroin in male rats [138]. In male mice, treatment with 
norbinaltorphimine was sufficient to prevent and reverse her-
oin abstinence-induced social avoidance [144] and morphine 
abstinence-induced anhedonia [145]. Systemic KOR antag-
onism with either norbinaltorphimine or 5’-guanidinonal-
trindole reversed heroin withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia 
in male and female rats [59], an effect that was recapitulated 
with an intra-CeA infusion of norbinaltorphimine [146].

The  reduction  of  dopamine  release  caused  by  dynor-
phin, particularly in the nucleus accumbens shell, was also 
hypothesized to modulate aversive/rewarding aspects of 
drug intake [147]. Acute and protracted withdrawal from 
morphine upregulated KORs in the nucleus accumbens. The 
conditional deletion of KORs in the nucleus accumbens pre-
vented withdrawal-induced anhedonia, and a local norbin-
altorphimine infusion reversed it [145]. The KOR agonist 
U50,488H reduced dopamine release in the nucleus accum-
bens in rats that self-administered heroin, resulting in an 
increase in immediate heroin intake [148]. κ-Opioid recep-
tor antagonists did not block the acute rewarding effects of 
opioids but blocked the stress-induced potentiation of opioid 
reward, the stress-induced reinstatement of opioid-seeking 
behavior, and the escalation of opioid intake in an extended 
access model [138].

Other less extensively studied brain regions that may 
mediate aversive effects of dynorphin and KORs in opioid 
dependence include the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, 
amygdala, and dorsal raphe. For example, morphine with-
drawal caused the release of dynorphin in the prelimbic 
cortex, leading to working memory deficits [149], whereas 
the inhibition of a dynorphinergic basolateral amygdala-
to-ventral  hippocampus  projection  reversed  morphine 
withdrawal-induced  anxiety-like  behavior  [150].  Mor-
phine abstinence activated dynorphin/KOR signaling in the 
basolateral amygdala, facilitating glutamate transporter 1 
upregulation that led to the inhibition of excitatory inputs 
to the nucleus accumbens. The activation of basolateral 

amygdala-to-nucleus accumbens inputs blocked depression-
like behavior following morphine abstinence [151].

The dynorphin/KOR modulation of serotonergic trans-
mission has been implicated in negative affect-like effects 
of opioid withdrawal [144, 152, 153]. Protracted abstinence 
from morphine led to robust social interaction deficits in 
mice, and this effect was mediated by KORs in the nucleus 
accumbens shell and by suppressing the release of serotonin 
[152].

Dynorphin  has  long  been  known  to  be  activated  by 
chronic alcohol administration [154] and chronic psycho-
stimulant administration [6, 155]. For alcohol, polymor-
phisms of the gene that encodes the KOR (Opkr1) have 
been associated with the severity of alcohol use disorder and 
depression [156], whereas polymorphisms of the Pdyn gene 
have been associated with alcohol dependence [157] and 
the propensity to drink in negative emotional states [158], 
an effect that appears to be more prominent in men [159].

During acute alcohol withdrawal there was an increase in 
prodynorphin mRNA expression in the CeA [160] and in the 
nucleus accumbens [161]. Similar findings are seen in the 
CeA and hypothalamus in alcohol-preferring rats compared 
with non-preferring rats after voluntary alcohol consump-
tion [162].

Dynorphin signaling is hypothesized to drive behavioral 
effects of acute withdrawal from alcohol. A KOR antagonist 
reversed anxiety-like acute withdrawal effects of exposure 
to chronic, intermittent alcohol exposure in mice [163] and 
somatic withdrawal and alcohol self-administration in rats 
[164].  Again,  a  prominent,  proposed  mechanism  is  that 
alcohol withdrawal exacerbates the inhibition of dopamine 
release in the nucleus accumbens, which is normalized by 
KOR antagonism [154, 163, 165, 166].

Dynorphin/KOR  signaling  in  the  extended  amygdala 
also has been shown to mediate compulsive-like drinking 
in alcohol dependence [167]. A combination of a short-
acting KOR antagonist and naltrexone decreased voluntary 
alcohol drinking in mice [168]. Both systemic and intracer-
ebral KOR antagonist administration blocked high compul-
sive-like alcohol intake [169, 170]. Antagonism of KORs 
reduced the stress-induced escalation of intake in mice that 
were exposed to chronic intermittent alcohol [171–173]. The 
chemogenetic inhibition of KORs in the CeA reduced drink-
ing in alcohol-dependent rats, similar to microinfusions of 
norbinaltorphimine in the CeA and BNST [174]. The CeA 
may also mediate effects of KOR blockade on binge-like 
drinking in mice [173, 175].

The rostro-caudal location of dynorphin and KOR cells 
in the nucleus accumbens has been shown to bi-direction-
ally modulate alcohol drinking. The stimulation of KORs 
in the caudal shell stimulated drinking, whereas stimula-
tion in the rostral shell decreased drinking [176]. The bi-
directional differences in alcohol intake coincided with the

KOR-mediated inhibition of dopamine release in rostral 
vs. caudal portions of the shell [177]. κ-Opioid receptor 
expression was downregulated in the ventral tegmental 
area following alcohol exposure [178], and KOR overex-
pression in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons 
that project to the nucleus accumbens led to compulsive-
like alcohol intake [179]. The nucleus accumbens shell 
also plays a role in the intersection between pain and alco-
hol, in which chronic inflammatory pain increased alcohol 
consumption following abstinence in female rats, an effect 
that was blocked by KOR antagonism [180].

Other  regions  have  been  implicated  in  actions  of 
dynorphin  in  addiction-like  effects  of  alcohol.  Dynor-
phin deletion and KOR blockade in the insula reduced the 
escalation of alcohol intake in a two-bottle choice inter-
mittent-access model [181]. κ-Opioid receptor antagonism 
in the PAG attenuated alcohol withdrawal-induced anxi-
ety- and depressive-like behaviors [182]. Medial prefrontal 
cortex KORs mediated working memory deficits in alcohol 
dependence [183].

Most evidence of the involvement of dynorphin and 
KORs in the neurobiology of stimulant addiction is related 
to the regulation of dopamine transmission. Binge-like 
cocaine  self-administration  upregulated  prodynorphin 
and KOR expression in the nucleus accumbens and ven-
tral tegmental area and increased KOR agonism-induced 
dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens [184, 185]. A 
midbrain dopamine circuit was also shown to modulate 
cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, dynorphin 
projections from the dorsal raphe to the ventral tegmental 
area led to dopamine release in response to cocaine [186]. 
Systemic [187] and intra-nucleus accumbens core [188] 

KOR antagonist administration prevented the escalation 
of cocaine intake in an extended-access model in rats, and 
these  treatments  reversed  cocaine  withdrawal-induced 
anxiety-like  behavior  [189].  Extended  access  to  meth-
amphetamine upregulated prodynorphin in the nucleus 
accumbens core and shell, and systemic and intra-nucleus 
accumbens shell (but not core) KOR antagonist admin-
istration prevented the escalation of methamphetamine 
intake and decreased the motivation to seek the drug [190]. 
Methamphetamine withdrawal-induced cognitive deficits 
may also be mediated by KORs in the hippocampus [191] 
and prelimbic prefrontal cortex [192].

In nicotine dependence, there was an upregulation of 
KORs and Oprk1 expression in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus 
accumbens, and hippocampus [193]. Moreover, a KOR ago-
nist promoted the reinstatement of nicotine self-administra-
tion and conditioned place preference [194–196]. Evidence 
also indicates that dynorphin and KORs might play a role 
in cannabis dependence. Withdrawal from chronic systemic 
exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol upregulated dynorphin and 
KORs in the nucleus accumbens [197].

Conclusion

Dynorphin and KORs modulate neurotransmission in the 
key circuits that are implicated in the interface of chronic 
pain states, stress, and addiction with a focus on the con-
struct of hyperkatifeia. The circuits and brain regions where 
KORs  and  dynorphin  modulate  behaviors  that  underlie 
the hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia constructs are summa-
rized in Fig. 1. A particular focal point is the modulation

of emotional pain or hyperkatifeia by the dynorphin/KOR 
system via the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system in the 
context of addiction. Although there is evidence of sexual 
dimorphism and a role for estrogen in the function of dynor-
phin and KORs, most published studies have utilized male 
rodents only. Those that used both male and female subjects 
frequently presented the data of both sexes combined. In 
conclusion, we propose that modulation of the dynorphin/
KOR system is a promising target for addressing hyperalge-
sia and hyperkatifeia during opioid withdrawal, which could 
potentially be used for the treatment of opioid use disorder 
and addiction more generally.
