Abstract
Background and Objective  Daridorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist for the treatment of insomnia. In two phase III, 12-week 
studies in patients with insomnia disorder, daridorexant improved sleep and daytime functioning while maintaining a favorable safety 
profile. The objective of this 40-week extension study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of daridorexant.
Methods  Adults with insomnia disorder who completed the 12-week studies were invited to enroll in this double-blind exten-
sion study. Patients originally randomised to daridorexant (10 mg/25 mg/50 mg) remained on their respective treatments; 
patients randomised to placebo were re-randomised to daridorexant 25 mg or placebo. The 40-week treatment period was 
followed by a 7-day placebo run-out. The primary objective was to assess safety/tolerability. Exploratory objectives were to 
evaluate the efficacy of daridorexant on sleep (self-reported total sleep time) and daytime functioning (Insomnia Daytime 
Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire).
Results  In total, 804 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 801 received at least one dose of the study treatment 
and 550 patients (68.4%) completed the study. Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar across 
groups (35–40%). Daridorexant did not induce next-morning sleepiness and no withdrawal-related symptoms or rebound 
were observed after treatment discontinuation. Improvements in sleep and daytime functioning were maintained through 
to the end of the study and were most pronounced with daridorexant 50 mg. Daridorexant 50 mg, compared with placebo, 
increased self-reported total sleep time by a least-squares mean of 20.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2, 36.5), 15.8 (95% 
CI − 0.8, 32.5) and 17.8 (95% CI − 0.4, 35.9) minutes and decreased (i.e., improved) Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and 
Impacts Questionnaire total scores by a least-squares mean of − 9.3 (95% CI − 15.1, − 3.6), − 9.5 (95% CI − 15.4, − 3.5) 
and − 9.1 (95% CI − 15.6, − 2.7), at weeks 12, 24 and 36 of the extension study, respectively.
Conclusions  Treatment with daridorexant, for up to 12 months, was generally safe and well tolerated. Exploratory efficacy 
analyses suggest that the sustained improvements in sleep and daytime functioning with daridorexant 50 mg support its use 
for long-term treatment of insomnia disorder, without concerns of new safety signals.

Plain Language Summary
Insomnia disorder is the long-term inability to fall asleep or stay asleep with a significant impact on daily life. Left inad-
equately treated, this disorder may increase the risk of other health problems. For patients with insomnia disorder who require 
a sleep medication, many drugs are not recommended for long-term use and there is an unmet need for one that can be used 
safely and effectively over the long term. Daridorexant is a new insomnia treatment that was approved for adults following 
positive results in two 12-week clinical studies. Both studies showed that, in patients with insomnia disorder, daridorexant 
improved night-time sleep and patients’ ability to function during the day, while avoiding major safety concerns. Patients who

completed these two studies could continue into a 40-week extension study enabling the safety and tolerability of daridorexant 
to be investigated for up to 1 year. Treatment remained double blind for the entire 1-year period. The extension study showed 
that daridorexant, at all doses studied (10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg), continued to be generally safe and well tolerated. Patients 
showed no signs of tolerance, physical dependence, rebound nor any excessive daytime sleepiness. Exploratory efficacy 
analyses suggest that improved night-time and daytime symptoms of insomnia were sustained, in particular with the highest 
approved dose, 50 mg, and there were no signs that the benefits of the drug were wearing off at the end of the 1 year. These 
results support the use of daridorexant 50 mg for the long-term treatment of insomnia disorder in adults.

Key Points 

In patients with insomnia disorder, daridorexant admin-
istered for up to 1 year was generally safe with no signs 
of tolerance, physical dependance or rebound.

Exploratory efficacy endpoints show daridorexant sus-
tained improvements in night-time sleep variables and 
daytime functioning.

The effects of daridorexant were most favorable with the 
highest approved dose of 50 mg, without concern for 
new safety signals.

1  Introduction

Some 50 years ago, sleep alterations were at the forefront of 
emerging biological psychiatry as specific changes in sleep 
architecture were recognised as biological markers of, for 
example, depressive illnesses [1]. In the International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, difficulties to initi-
ate or maintain sleep were operationalised as symptoms of 
mental disorders leaving just a small group of patients with 
primary insomnia to be treated with specific sleep-related 
therapy [2, 3]. Over the past 30 years, pivotal functions of 
sleep have been described including its influence on brain 
maturation,  neuronal  plasticity,  memory  consolidation, 
learning processes, metabolic coordination and immune 
system functioning [4]. Thus, good-quality sleep of suffi-
cient length is a basic physiological necessity, essential for 
well-being, performance and health.

In 2019, the World Health Organization passed the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, includ-
ing Chapter 7 on Sleep-Wake Disorders. Insomnia disorder 
was operationalised to be diagnosed whenever disturbances 
to initiate or maintain sleep in conjunction with day-time 
impairment are present [5], aligning the International Clas-
sification of Diseases, 11th Revision with the definition 
adapted in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition published in 2013 [6]. Epidemio-
logic studies consistently report ~10% of the general popula-
tion experience insomnia or nonrestorative sleep [7]. Thus, 

insomnia disorder seems to be one of the most prevalent 
and chronic medical disorders. Insomnia disorder is asso-
ciated with a substantial burden of disease [8]. The day-
time impairment can negatively influence quality of life in 
several ways, including decreased workplace productivity, 
and an increased risk for injuries and accidents [9–14]. For 
many patients, this sleep-wake disorder becomes a persis-
tent condition and beyond the short-term effects of not get-
ting enough good sleep, undertreated or untreated insomnia 
poses some serious long-term health consequences, includ-
ing increasing the risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
depression, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer [15–17].
The  ideal  treatment  for  insomnia  disorder  should  be 
one that is safe and effective, in the short and long term. It 
should improve not only the quantitative measures such as 
total sleep time, wake-time after sleep onset and sleep-onset 
latency, but also sleep quality, to improve daytime perfor-
mance and general health [18, 19]. Several drugs are availa-
ble for the treatment of insomnia, with GABA-A modulators 
(benzodiazepines and Z-drugs) being the most commonly 
prescribed, and generally considered effective for short-term 
treatment [20]. However, many of these medications do not, 
for example, provide meaningful effects on sleep mainte-
nance or address the daytime functioning impairments [21]. 
Concerns regarding cognitive and motor impairment, falls, 
dependence and high levels of somnolence further limit their 
use and guidelines strongly caution against, or discourage, 
their long-term use [2, 11, 20–22]. This creates a critical 
unmet need for patients who require a safe and effective 
long-term treatment.

Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) have in the 
last decade emerged as a novel treatment option for insomnia 
disorder. They act specifically on the brain’s orexin system 
that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, without causing broad 
depression of the central nervous system. The orexin A and 
B neuropeptides bind to the G-protein-coupled orexin-1 and 
orexin-2 receptors to promote wakefulness [23, 24]. Nor-
mally, the orexin neurons exert their highest activity during 
the day as wakefulness is promoted and are virtually silent at 
night [25, 26]. Unusual activity of the orexin system during 
night-time (or sleep time) could lead to abnormal hypera-
rousal and insomnia [27, 28]. Dual orexin receptor antago-
nists suppress the excessive wakefulness during sleep time 

by selectively targeting and blocking the binding of orexin 
neuropeptides to the two receptors [29]. This mechanism of 
action avoids the more widespread inhibition of neuronal 
pathways and side effects (e.g. next-morning residual sleepi-
ness, falls, motor incoordination, tolerance and physical 
dependence) that are intrinsic to GABA-A modulators and 
often limit their use [30–35].

The  DORA  daridorexant,  approved  for  the  treatment 
of insomnia in adults aged ≥ 18 years [14], has a pharma-
cokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic profile with a rapid 
absorption enabling a fast onset, and a rapid elimination 
enabling  night-time  sleep  maintenance  whilst  avoiding 
next-morning sleepiness [36–38]. Beneficial effects of dari-
dorexant were shown in two pivotal 12-week trials in adult 
patients with insomnia disorder [39]. Daridorexant signifi-
cantly improved sleep onset and sleep maintenance with the 
highest dose (daridorexant 50 mg) being the most effica-
cious. Progressive improvements in daytime functioning 
(sleepiness, alert/cognition and mood) were also observed, 
assessed  using  the  validated  patient-reported  outcomes 
instrument, the Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts 
Questionnaire (IDSIQ) [40], with no evidence of next-morn-
ing sleepiness. Patients who completed the 12-week studies 
were eligible to enroll in a 40-week extension study. Here, 
we report the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy find-
ings for daily daridorexant on self-reported sleep quality and 
daytime functioning.

2   Methods

2.1   Study Design

The extension study was a phase III, international, ran-
domised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
study  (ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT03679884)  designed  to 
evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of daridorex-
ant in patients with insomnia disorder who had completed 
one of the two pivotal 12-week phase III trials (Trial 1: 
NCT03545191; Trial 2: NCT03575104). Protocol details 
for the 12-week studies have been reported [39].

The extension study consisted of a 40-week treatment 
period followed by a 30-day safety follow-up period, which 
included a 7-day single-blind placebo run-out period (Fig. 
S1  of  the  Electronic  Supplementary  Material  [ESM]). 
Patients who completed the 12-week studies [39], and had 
been randomised to oral daridorexant (10 mg, 25 mg or 50 
mg) continued their same double-blind treatment for an 
additional 40 weeks (52 weeks total treatment). Patients 
originally randomised to 12 weeks of placebo were re-ran-
domised (1:1) to receive double-blind daridorexant 25 mg 
(‘ex-placebo/daridorexant 25 mg’) or placebo for 40 weeks. 
Randomisation was stratified by age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) 

95

and treatment was allocated using an interactive response 
technology system. The randomisation list remained confi-
dential until after the database lock. Patients, investigators 
and study/sponsor personnel remained blinded to all treat-
ment assignments for the duration of the study. Please refer 
to Table S1 in the ESM for the full list of investigators.

The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice 
and local regulations. Protocols were approved by an insti-
tutional review board or ethics committee. All participants 
provided written informed consent. The study was moni-
tored by an independent data-monitoring committee and an 
independent safety board (ISB) [see Table S2 and S3 in the 
ESM].

2.2   Study Participants

Inclusion criteria for the extension study were completion 
of the 12-week double-blind treatment plus the placebo run-
out of the pivotal trials. Eligibility criteria for the 12-week 
studies have been described [39]. Briefly, this included adult 
patients (aged ≥ 18 years), with a diagnosis of insomnia 
disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, Fifth Edition), an Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 
15 and a self-reported history of disturbed sleep (≥ 30 min to 
fall asleep, ≥ 30 min awake during sleep time, self-reported 
total sleep time [sTST] ≤ 6.5 h) for ≥ 3 nights per week for 
≥ 3 months. During the placebo run-in period, the following 
polysomnography criteria were required to be met: latency to 
persistent sleep ≥ 20 min, wake after sleep onset ≥ 30 min 
and mean total sleep time < 7 h. Patients with a history of 
sleep-related breathing disorders, other sleep disorders, sui-
cide ideation/attempt, self-reported excessive daytime nap-
ping, acute/unstable psychiatric conditions or alcohol/drug 
abuse were excluded [39]. Patients with unstable medical 
conditions, significant medical disorders or acute illnesses, 
clinically relevant electrocardiographic findings, suicidal-
ity, hematology or biochemistry test results reported during 
the 12-week trials that could affect the patient’s safety or 
interfere with assessments were excluded from entering the 
extension study.

2.3   Primary Outcomes: Safety and Tolerability

The primary objective of this extension study was to assess 
the long-term safety and tolerability of daridorexant. Meas-
ures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
including serious TEAEs, that started/worsened on or after 
the double-blind treatment start date of the extension study 
up to 30 days after the double-blind treatment end date, 
as well as TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of 
double-blind treatment, and adverse events of special inter-
est (AESIs) after adjudication by an ISB. Adverse events of

special interest were defined as narcolepsy-like symptoms 
related to excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, complex 
sleep behaviour events including hallucinations and sleep 
paralysis, and suicide/self-injury. Adverse events were coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Pre-
ferred Terms.

Change  from  the  baseline  in  the  Epworth  Sleepiness 
Scale (ESS) total score (range 0–24; higher scores indicate 
greater daytime sleepiness) was assessed at weeks 14, 27, 
40 and 41 (run-out). Change from the baseline in the visual 
analogue scale-assessed morning sleepiness score (range 
0–100, higher score indicates a better outcome) was assessed 
as an average of daily entries over 1 week, every 4 weeks. 
Vital signs and electrocardiographic parameters were moni-
tored throughout the study and a change in body weight was 
assessed at week 40.

Withdrawal effects upon treatment discontinuation were 
assessed based on changes from the last assessment on double-
blind treatment (week 40) to the end of the placebo run-out 
(week 41) in the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Ques-
tionnaire (BWSQ) total score and the occurrence of relevant 
adverse events during the placebo run-out. Rebound insomnia 
was assessed based on a change in sTST from the baseline to 
the average over the 1-week placebo run-out period.

2.4   Exploratory Outcomes: Night‑Time Sleep 

and Daytime Functioning

Exploratory objectives were to evaluate the long-term effi-
cacy  of  daridorexant  on  sleep  and  daytime  functioning. 
Analyses focused on the self-reported variables that were 
included as secondary endpoints in the 12-week studies, 
and for which a type I error was controlled in these studies 
[39]. The endpoints were changes from the baseline in sTST, 
recorded by the patient in the sleep diary questionnaire, and 
in IDSIQ scores. The IDSIQ is a validated instrument devel-
oped in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration 
guidance for assessing patient-reported outcomes [40]. The 
IDSIQ contains 14 different questions assessing daytime 
functioning in patients with insomnia disorder; the ques-
tions are grouped into three domains each representing the 
main daytime symptoms and impacts of insomnia on alert/
cognition (six questions), sleepiness (four questions) and 
mood (four questions), and patients rate each question on 
a scale of 0–10. The sleep diary questionnaire and IDSIQ 
were completed daily for 7 days every 4 weeks and sTST and 
IDSIQ scores were the mean of the entries each week. Treat-
ment exposure was measured as the duration of double-blind 
treatment (days) in the extension study.

2.5   Statistical Analyses

No  formal  sample  size  calculation  was  performed;  the 
extension study was open to all patients who completed the 
12-week trials. Baseline was defined as the last observed 
measurement  before  or  on  the  first  day  of  double-blind 
treatment in the 12-week study (termed “pivotal 12-week 
study baseline” for daridorexant 10-mg, 25-mg, 50-mg and 
placebo groups) or the extension study (termed “extension 
study baseline” for ex-placebo/daridorexant 25-mg and pla-
cebo groups).

Safety  endpoints  were  summarised  descriptively  and 
analysed using the safety set (all patients who received one 
or more doses of the study treatment) except those evalu-
ating the placebo run-out period, withdrawal symptoms or 
rebound insomnia, which were analysed using the treatment 
withdrawal set (all patients in the safety set who received 
one or more doses of the single-blind placebo treatment in 
the run-out).

Exploratory efficacy outcomes were analysed using the 
full analysis set (all patients randomised to study treatment). 
Changes from the baseline were analysed using a mixed 
model for repeated measures and a restricted maximum like-
lihood approach. The model included terms for age group 
as per assigned strata (< 65; ≥ 65 years), treatment, visit 
(week 12, 24 and 36 of extension study), and interaction of 
treatment by visit, and baseline by visit. Results are reported 
as least-squares mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
change from the baseline and difference to placebo; these 
are provided as a measure of the strength of the findings 
and should be viewed as descriptive only. Post-hoc analyses 
of the change from the pivotal 12-week study baseline for 
the efficacy endpoints were performed according to which 
12-week study patients entered from (Trial 1 and 2); any 
p-values presented are descriptive only. For the post-hoc 
analyses, a similar mixed model for repeated measures and a 
restricted maximum likelihood approach were used but with 
the respective treatment in Trial 1 or 2 and visit (month 1, 3, 
6, 9 and 12). Missing data were handled by a mixed model 
for repeated measures and were not imputed.

3   Results

3.1   Study Participants

The study was conducted between October 2018 and Feb-
ruary 2021 at 94 sites in 14 countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, 
Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, USA). 
Overall, 1684 patients completed the 12-week double-blind 
treatment and placebo run-out of the pivotal trials (Trial 1: 

N = 847; Trial 2: N = 837). Of these, 804 (47.7%) entered 
the extension study and 801 received at least one dose of the 
study treatment (daridorexant 10 mg, n = 142; daridorexant 
25 mg, n = 268; daridorexant 50 mg, n = 137; ex-placebo/
daridorexant 25 mg, n = 126; placebo, n = 128) (Fig. 1). No 
information was collected on reasons for non-participation. 
Overall, 550 patients (68.4%) completed 40 weeks of dou-
ble-blind treatment. Treatment discontinuations were more 
frequent in the placebo group than the daridorexant groups 
with the most common reason being a lack of efficacy (23% 
vs 8–11%, placebo vs daridorexant groups, Fig. 1). Mean 
(standard deviation) treatment exposure during the extension 
study double-blind treatment period was slightly higher in 
the daridorexant treatment groups (227 [91.6], 231 [85.3], 
222 [93.2] and 232 [88.6] days in the 10-mg, 25-mg, 50-mg 
and ex-placebo/daridorexant 25-mg groups, respectively) 
versus placebo (210 [97.2] days).

Demographic and baseline characteristics were overall 
balanced between treatment groups (Table 1) and similar to 
the intention-to-treat population (N = 1854) in the 12-week 
trials [39]. Overall mean age was 58 years (range 19–85 

97

years), with 41.7% aged ≥ 65 years. The majority of patients 
were female (71.5%) and White (89.8%). At the start of the 
extension study, comorbidities and concomitant therapies 
were reported in 72.1% and 64.8% of patients, respectively; 
both were balanced across treatment groups (Table 1).

3.2   Safety

All results presented are during the extension study. The 
overall incidence and severity of TEAEs (up to 30 days after 
the end of the double-blind treatment) were similar across 
groups (35–40%) (Table 2). Most TEAEs occurring dur-
ing the 40-week double-blind period were mild/moderate 
in severity (91.2%). The most commonly reported TEAE 
during double-blind treatment in all groups was nasophar-
yngitis. All other TEAEs, including falls, headache and 
somnolence were reported in < 3% of patients, with diz-
ziness and fatigue in < 2% of patients in any group. Treat-
ment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of

(and  hence  double-blind  [DB]  treatment)  at  any  time.  However, 
patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  DB  treatment  were  not  con-
sidered withdrawn from the study and could remain in the extension 

study and continue with all planned study procedures until the end of 
the study (apart from the placebo run-out). Therefore, the reason for a 
patient prematurely discontinuing treatment and for discontinuing the 
study could be different. SB single-blind

Data are presented as n (%). The safety analysis population included all patients who received at least one dose of double-blind treatment during 
the extension study. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event that started or worsened during the double-blind treatment of the extension study, 
up to 30 days after the end of the double-blind treatment
ISB independent safety board, TEAE treatment-emergent adverse event
a TEAEs that occurred during the double-blind treatment period and presented with their preferred terms. TEAEs are sorted by descending fre-
quency in the daridorexant 50-mg group, followed by the 25-mg, 10-mg, placebo and ex-placebo/25-mg groups

double-blind treatment were reported only for single patients 
in any given group (Table S4 in the ESM).

The incidence of serious TEAEs was < 5.5% in all groups 
(Table 2). Two serious TEAEs assessed as related to study 
medication by the investigator were reported: orthostatic 
intolerance (daridorexant 25 mg) and depression/suicidal 
ideation (placebo) [Table S5 in the ESM]. Two deaths, both 
cardiovascular related, were reported during the study (dari-
dorexant 10 mg, n = 1; daridorexant 25 mg, n = 1) and 
assessed by the investigator as not related to study treatment.
Independent safety board-adjudicated AESIs were infre-
quent and reported in three patients, all considered by the 
investigator  as  drug  related  and  not  requiring  treatment 
(Table 2). One non-serious event related to excessive day-
time sleepiness was reported in the daridorexant 25-mg 
group. This AESI had onset on day 44 (of extension study) 
and was resolved on day 93. During this period, the patient 

experienced several separate episodes of short duration (fell 
asleep or napped during daytime less than or once per week). 
The patient discontinued the study on day 98 because of 
this AESI. A second non-serious TEAE related to hallu-
cinations/sleep paralysis was reported in the daridorexant 
50-mg group; this patient experienced mild events of abnor-
mal dreams (no impression of fear or being in a nightmare) 
on days 1, 2 and 4 of the extension study, awaking 1–1.5 h 
after taking the study drug. The AESI resolved thereafter. A 
third serious AESI of suicidal ideation was reported in the 
placebo group. No complex sleep behavior nor AESI related 
to cataplexy was reported in any patient.

Accidental overdose (patients who unintentionally took 
or were uncertain of whether they had taken an extra tablet) 
was the most frequently reported TEAE pertaining to drug 
abuse potential and was reported in 15 patients receiving 
daridorexant (10 mg, n = 4 [2.8%]; 25 mg, n = 3 [1.1%];

BWSQ was low in all groups, and no dose dependency was 
observed.

3.4   Rebound Insomnia

No signal suggestive of any rebound effect after treatment 
discontinuation  was  observed  with  daridorexant  versus 
baseline (Table S10 in the ESM). During the placebo run-
out, mean sTST was numerically higher than baseline (i.e. 
improved) in all daridorexant and placebo groups (Table S12 
in the ESM).

50 mg, n = 4 [2.9%]; ex-placebo/daridorexant 25 mg, n = 
4 [3.2%]) [Table S6 in the ESM]. All cases were asymp-
tomatic, mild and non-serious. Other TEAEs pertaining to 
drug abuse were reported for only one or two patients in 
any one treatment group and no TEAEs denoting euphoria 
were reported.

Fall was the most frequently reported TEAE pertaining to 
accidents and injuries, reported for 14 patients across treat-
ment groups (10 mg, n = 2 [1.4%]; 25 mg, n = 6 [2.2%]; 
50 mg, n = 3 [2.2%]; ex-placebo/daridorexant 25 mg, n = 1 
[0.8%]; placebo, n = 2 [1.6%] (Table S7 in the ESM). None 
was serious nor occurred during the night and, in all cases, 
external contributing factors (e.g. stumbling, slippery floor) 
were reported. No evidence of any central nervous system 
depressant effects, such as somnolence or impaired atten-
tion, was reported at the time of any fall. The incidence of 
falls was low in patients aged < 65 years (1.1%) and ≥ 65 
years (2.7%).

Patients taking daridorexant did not show excessive day-
time sleepiness relative to placebo. At all timepoints, and in 
all groups, compared with baseline, mean visual analogue 
scale scores for morning sleepiness were numerically higher 
(Table S8 in the ESM) and mean ESS scores numerically 
lower (i.e. both improved) [Table S9 in the ESM]. There 
were no clinically significant findings for any changes in 
hematology or clinical chemistry parameters, vital signs, 
body weight or electrocardiographic parameters.

3.3   Withdrawal

There was no evidence of any withdrawal-related symptoms 
upon cessation of the study treatment (Table S10 in the 
ESM). Mean BWSQ total scores were low and similar across 
treatment groups (Table S11 in the ESM). Changes from the 
last assessment on the double-blind treatment to the pla-
cebo run-out period were minor with no relevant differences 
between daridorexant and placebo groups. No patient had 
a BWSQ score > 20 at the end of the run-out. The number 
of patients with at least one symptom scored as severe on 

3.5   Efficacy

Improvements from the baseline in sTST and IDSIQ scores 
observed  in  the  12-week  studies  [39]  were  maintained 
through to the end of the extension study. Least-square mean 
changes from the pivotal 12-week study baseline in sTST 
and IDSIQ scores at week 12, 24 and 36 of the extension 
study were numerically greater for all daridorexant doses 
versus  placebo  and  most  pronounced  with  daridorexant 
50 mg (Table S13 in the ESM). In the 50-mg group, least-
squares mean increases in sTST from the 12-week study 
baseline versus placebo were 20.4 min (95% CI 4.2, 36.5; 
p = 0.014) at week 12, 15.8 min (95% CI − 0.8, 32.5; p = 
0.063) at week 24 and 17.8 minutes (95% CI − 0.4, 35.9; 
p = 0.055) at week 36. For the IDSIQ total score, least-
squares mean reductions from baseline versus placebo in 
the 50-mg group were − 9.3 (95% CI − 15.1, − 3.6; p = 
0.0015), −9.5 (95% CI − 15.4, − 3.5; p = 0.0019) and − 9.1 
(95% CI − 15.6, − 2.7; p = 0.0058) at weeks 12, 24 and 
36, respectively. Similar findings were observed for IDSIQ 
sleepiness, alert/cognition and mood domain scores with all 
p values < 0.05 at weeks 12, 24 and 36 in the daridorexant 
50-mg group.

For patients who entered the extension study from Trial 1, 
the increases in sTST and reductions in IDSIQ total scores 
and domain scores from baseline were consistently larger 
with daridorexant 50 mg versus 25 mg and placebo through-
out the extension study (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 and Table S14 in 
the ESM). For patients who entered from Trial 2, the treat-
ment effect on sTST was maintained for both daridorexant 
doses (10 and 25 mg) and placebo (Fig. S3 and Table S15 
in the ESM). For the IDSIQ total score, a large treatment 
effect was maintained throughout the extension study for 
daridorexant 50 mg from Trial 1 (Fig. 2) and daridorex-
ant 25 mg from Trial 2 (Fig. S3 in the ESM) and changes 
were consistently larger than with placebo. Similar findings 
were observed for the individual IDSIQ domain scores. For 
patients who received placebo during the 12-week studies 
and were re-randomised to daridorexant 25 mg in the exten-
sion study, mean changes from the extension study baseline

4   Discussion

This  is  the  first  long-term  study  to  investigate,  in  par-
allel, the safety, the night-time efficacy and the impact 
on daytime functioning of an insomnia medication in a 
placebo-controlled setting. Over a total of 52 weeks of 
nightly treatment (including the pivotal 12-week trials), 
daridorexant in patients with insomnia disorder demon-
strated a favorable long-term safety and tolerability profile 
consistent with the 12-week study findings [39]. No new 
safety signals were reported and there was no evidence of 
physical dependence, tolerance or rebound. In exploratory 
efficacy analyses, daridorexant 50 mg showed the most 
favorable  improvements  that  were  sustained  from  the 
baseline in patient-reported total sleep time and daytime 
functioning compared with placebo. There were no signs 
that the benefits were wearing off at the end of the study.
In patients who received 52 weeks of active treatment, 
daridorexant was generally safe and well tolerated without 
any residual sleepiness the next morning, or other safety 
concerns  at  any  dose  studied.  In  fact,  consistent  with 
observations from the 12-week studies [39], daridorex-
ant improved next morning sleepiness (visual analogue 
scale).  Moreover,  the  incidences  of  falls,  somnolence, 
fatigue and dizziness were low in all groups. As in the 
12-week studies, no adverse events of cataplexy or other 
narcolepsy-related symptoms were reported during the 
extension study. The abuse of sleep medications is a major 
concern to both prescribing physicians and patients [41]. 
Here, the incidence of abuse-associated adverse events 
was low and, following abrupt cessation of 52-week treat-
ment, there was no evidence of withdrawal symptoms, or 
rebound insomnia, suggesting low potential for abuse of 
daridorexant. This is consistent with all clinical data to 
date in which there have been no reports of misuse, abuse 
or diversion of daridorexant [39,  42–44], and with pre-
clinical data that show daridorexant does not bind to any 
known abuse-associated central nervous system targets 
[45].

Daridorexant provided sustained efficacy in increasing 
sTST and decreasing all IDSIQ scores, versus placebo. 
Many patients require long-term treatment for insomnia 
disorder and thus this sustained efficacy over time, and 
lack of any evidence of attenuation of efficacy over time, 
is noteworthy. For patients who received placebo during 
the 12-week studies and were subsequently randomised 
to daridorexant 25 mg for 40 weeks, the mean changes 
in sTST and IDSIQ scores indicated clear improvements, 

suggesting that daridorexant adds benefit even in patients 
who previously improved on placebo in the pivotal trials.
The sustained improvement in all aspects of daytime 
functioning, observed with daridorexant 50 mg, addresses 
a crucial medical need for patients with insomnia disorder. 
The chronology of the improvement of daytime function-
ing is also of interest. Evidently, the improvement in night-
time function arises before the plateau of improvements in 
daytime functioning during the first 3 months of treatment. 
It could be speculated that an accumulation of nights with 
increased quality and quantity of sleep may be required to 
observe this improved daytime functioning.

Despite the chronicity of insomnia disorder, there is a 
lack of long-term clinical trials and as such, most sleep 
medications are not approved for use beyond 1 month. For 
benzodiazepines, to our knowledge, the longest study is an 
8-week trial of temazepam [46]. For Z-drugs, eszopiclone 
has been studied up to 12 months and shown to maintain 
efficacy without development of tolerance [47, 48]. Never-
theless, because of a lack of evidence and remaining safety 
concerns, sedative hypnotics remain recommended only for 
short-term use [2, 11, 22]. With regard to DORAs, 12-month 
studies have been performed for suvorexant [49] and lembo-
rexant [50]; however, these studies have some limitations. 
For suvorexant, no long-term data on the approved 10-mg 
dose are available [49]. For lemborexant (5 or 10 mg), only 
the first 6 months of the study were placebo controlled and 
daytime  functioning  was  not  assessed  using  a  validated 
instrument such as the IDSIQ.

A strength of the current study is the collection of self-
reported patient relevant endpoints for up to 1 year, including 
the prospective daily measurements of daytime functioning. 
A further strength is that treatment remained double blind 
for the entire 1 year without any reports of any code breaks 
or indications of patient unblinding. Given this study design, 
the study completion rate (68.4%) was relatively high; often 
such long-term extension studies with a continued placebo 
arm do not provide the same incentives to patients as shorter 
term studies. This may be indicative of the continued effec-
tiveness and safety of daridorexant. However, it does likely 
contribute to the proportion of patients who decided not to 
participate in the extension study. Reasons for non-partici-
pation were not collected; such information may have been 
insightful in helping to understand the reasons for patients 
who do not wish to take sleep medications in the months 
following acute remediation of their insomnia. Non-par-
ticipation may however be partly explained by a potential 
reluctance to continue long-term treatment with a sleep 
medication (given general recommendations for short-term 
use only) plus the possibility of remaining on placebo for a 
further 40 weeks. Those who felt a benefit while receiving 
placebo in the 12-week studies may have been more likely 
to continue into the extension study. Further, there may 

be attrition bias during the extension study owing to more 
patients in the placebo group prematurely discontinuing 
treatment than in the daridorexant groups. Further, efficacy 
endpoints, which should be interpreted as exploratory, are 
limited to those that were key endpoints in the two 12-week 
trials and considered of most relevance. Other efficacy end-
points will be considered for separate publication. There are 
also the limitations associated with the 12-week studies [39], 
including that most patients were White and represented a 
population with moderate and severe insomnia (Insomnia 
Severity Index score ≥ 15), and perhaps more severe than 
is generally seen in practice; this study population may not 
be fully representative of the wider patient population, and 
patient numbers may not have been big enough to detect 
rare adverse events. It should also be acknowledged that, in 
the absence of head-to-head trials comparing daridorexant 
to other DORAs, any inferences about comparative efficacy 
or safety are limited.

As with any long-term treatment, many patients will take 
other medications concomitantly for a variety of conditions 
and thus consideration should be given to the PK and phar-
macodynamic drug–drug interactions with daridorexant. 
No PK analyses were performed from this study but within 
the clinical pharmacology program of daridorexant, the 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of daridorexant has 
been evaluated in healthy young and older adults [37, 38]. 
Specific safety aspects, including the modulating effects of 
intrinsic [51] and extrinsic factors [52–54], human abuse 
potential [44] and effects on driving performance [55] and 
safety  in  special  populations  (subjects  with  respiratory 
disease [56, 57] and hepatic or renal impairment [58, 59]) 
have also been evaluated. To summarise, daridorexant is 
quickly absorbed and cleared from the plasma and the dis-
tinct pharmacodynamic effects observed are in accordance 
with the pharmacokinetics, i.e. for a certain dose, the extent 
and duration of effects are explained by its PK profile, also 
demonstrated by the dose–response relationship for sleep 
parameters observed in phase III [39].

5   Conclusions

Results from this study indicate that daridorexant, at all 
doses studied, administered for up to 1 year is generally 
safe and well tolerated in patients with insomnia disorder. 
Exploratory analyses suggest that the sustained efficacy in 
improving night-time and daytime symptoms of insomnia, 
with no evidence of tolerance or dependency, supports the 
use of daridorexant 50 mg for the long-term treatment of 
insomnia disorder in adults.
