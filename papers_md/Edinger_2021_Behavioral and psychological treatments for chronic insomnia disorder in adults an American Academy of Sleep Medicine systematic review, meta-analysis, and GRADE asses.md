Introduction: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline on the use of behavioral and
psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adult populations.
Methods: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of 9 experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology. A systematic review was
conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that addressed behavioral and psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.
Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the treatments produced clinically signiﬁcant improvements in a range of critical and important outcomes. Finally, the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process was used to evaluate the evidence for making speciﬁc treatment recommendations.
Results: The literature search identiﬁed 1,244 studies; 124 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 89 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. Evidence
for the following interventions is presented in this review: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, brief therapies for insomnia, stimulus control, sleep restriction
therapy, relaxation training, sleep hygiene, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining, and mindfulness. This review provides a detailed summary
of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of beneﬁts vs harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

INTRODUCTION

This systematic review is intended to provide supporting evi-
dence for a clinical practice guideline1 on the behavioral and
psychological treatments of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.
This systematic review is an update of the evidence review
conducted for the previously published American Academy of
Sleep Medicine (AASM) guideline.2 The AASM published a
separate clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological
treatment of chronic insomnia in 2017.3

BACKGROUND

Diagnosis, prevalence, course, and etiology
The International Classiﬁcation of Sleep Disorders,
third
edition (ICSD-3)4 diagnostic manual describes chronic in-
somnia disorder as a report of difﬁculty initiating or maintaining
sleep or waking up too early with associated daytime conse-
quences, occurring despite adequate opportunity and circum-
stances for sleep. The sleep difﬁculties must occur at least
3 times per week for at least 3 months. Historically, insomnia

disorders have been divided into primary and secondary (comorbid)
subtypes, based on the clinician’s diagnostic assessment of the
role of medical and/or psychiatric comorbidities in the genesis
and maintenance of the insomnia disorder. However, with the
publication of ICSD-3 and the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, ﬁfth edition,5 this nosological
dichotomy is no longer utilized. The decision to eliminate this
distinction was based on the observation that it is often difﬁcult
to discern cause-effect relationships between insomnia and co-
occurring disorders and that insomnia often becomes an in-
dependent disorder even if it is initially caused by another
medical or psychiatric condition. Notably, many studies in-
cluded in this systematic review employed the historical dis-
tinction between primary and secondary (comorbid) subtypes in
identifying patients for inclusion in treatment trials.

Insomnia symptoms occur in a high percentage of the adult
population, with estimates ranging from 35%–50%.6–8 Chronic
insomnia disorder, deﬁned by speciﬁc diagnostic criteria, has an
estimated prevalence of 5%–15%.4,5,8 Chronic insomnia disor-
der is more common among women, those with lower socio-
economic status, and those with medical or psychiatric illness.6–8
The course of chronic insomnia disorder is typically measured

Description
CBT-I combines 1 or more of the cognitive therapy strategies with education about sleep
regulation plus stimulus control instructions and sleep restriction therapy. CBT-I also often
includes sleep hygiene education, relaxation training, and other counterarousal methods.
Treatment progresses using information typically gathered with sleep diaries completed by
the patient throughout the course of treatment (typically 4–8 sessions).
BTIs include abbreviated versions of CBT-I (typically 1–4 sessions) emphasizing the
behavioral components. BTIs typically consist of education about sleep regulation, factors
that inﬂuence sleep, and behaviors that promote or interfere with sleep, along with a tailored
behavioral prescription based on stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy and on
information typically derived from a pretreatment sleep diary. Some therapies include brief
relaxation or cognitive therapy elements.
A set of instructions designed to (1) extinguish the association between the bed/bedroom and
wakefulness to restore the association of bed/bedroom with sleep, and (2) establish a
consistent wake-time. Stimulus control instructions: (1) go to bed only when sleepy, (2) get out
of bed when unable to sleep, (3) use the bed/bedroom for sleep and sex only (eg, no reading
or watching television in bed), (4) wake up at the same time every morning, and (5) refrain
from daytime napping.
A method designed to enhance sleep drive and consolidate sleep by limiting time in bed equal
to the patient’s sleep duration, typically estimated from daily diaries. Time in bed is initially
limited to the average sleep duration and is subsequently increased or decreased based on
sleep efﬁciency thresholds until sufﬁcient sleep duration and overall sleep satisfaction
are achieved.
Structured exercises designed to reduce somatic tension (eg, abdominal breathing,
progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training) and cognitive arousal (eg, guided imagery
training, meditation) that may perpetuate sleep problems.
A set of strategies including structured psychoeducation, Socratic questioning, use of thought
records, and behavioral experiments designed to identify and modify unhelpful beliefs about
sleep that may support sleep-disruptive habits and/or raise performance anxiety
about sleeping.
A set of general recommendations about lifestyle (eg, diet, exercise, substance use) and
environmental factors (eg, light, noise, temperature) that may promote or interfere with sleep.
Sleep hygiene may include some education about what constitutes “normal” sleep and
changes in sleep patterns with aging.
A variant of relaxation training that employs a device capable of monitoring and providing
ongoing feedback on some aspect of the patient’s physiology. This technique has most
commonly employed continuous monitoring of frontalis electromyography activity to assess
the overall level of muscle tension. Typically, the biofeedback device produces an ongoing
auditory tone to train the patient to relax by learning how to alter the auditory feedback tone in
the desired direction (eg, reduced muscle tension).

The patient is instructed to remain awake as long as possible after getting into bed. The
patient is instructed to purposefully engage in the feared activity (staying awake) to reduce
performance anxiety and conscious intent to sleep that confound associated goal-directed
behavior (falling asleep). This method alleviates both the patient’s excessive focus on sleep
and anxiety over not sleeping; as a result, sleep becomes less difﬁcult to initiate.
This newly described treatment is designed to markedly enhance homeostatic sleep drive to
reduce both sleep onset difﬁculties and sleep misperception. After a night wherein the patient
limits time in bed to no more than 5 hours, the treatment includes a 24-hour laboratory
protocol in which the patient is given an opportunity to fall asleep every 30 minutes in sleep-
conducive conditions. If sleep occurs, then the patient is awakened after 3 minutes and
remains awake until the subsequent 30-minute trial. For each sleep opportunity, the patient is
given feedback as to whether or not sleep occurred.

Mindfulness approaches are used as a form of meditation emphasizing a nonjudgmental
state of heightened or complete awareness of one’s thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a
moment-to-moment basis. Mindfulness therapies are typically administered in a group
format. Structured exercises teach momentary awareness, self-acceptance, and muted
reactivity. Home practice of mindfulness exercises is required. When applied to people with
insomnia, standard mindfulness is often combined with other insomnia therapies such as
stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, and sleep hygiene (described above).

aMulticomponent treatment is a combination of approaches, and single-component treatment is delivered in isolation. BTIs = brief therapies for insomnia,
CBT-I = cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia.

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

in years or even decades, with spontaneous remission rates
generally less than 50%.9 Isolated sleep-onset difﬁculties are
less common than sleep maintenance difﬁculties, although a
substantial proportion of people with insomnia report difﬁ-
culties with both sleep onset and sleep maintenance.10

Chronic insomnia disorder is associated with daytime fa-
tigue, depressed mood, increased incidence of nonremitting
depression with increased suicide risk, impairment in social/
vocational functioning, and reduced quality of life.11–14 Studies
have shown that insomnia contributes to increased health care
costs and utilization15–17 and to lower worker productivity.18 In
fact, more than 90% of insomnia-related costs are attributable to
work absences and reduced productivity.19

The etiology of chronic insomnia disorder is multifactorial.
Emerging research indicates that some individuals may be
genetically predisposed to insomnia as a result of clock gene
polymorphisms or other genetic factors.20 As noted in the above
paragraph, numerous medical and psychiatric disorders are
associated with a high risk for insomnia. Some disorders, such
as major depressive disorders, show rates of concurrent in-
somnia as high as 80%–90%.21 A variety of maladaptive
cognitions and behaviors play a critical role in the development
and maintenance of chronic insomnia.22 These include per-
formance anxiety and negative expectations regarding sleep,
with associated worry about potential consequences of not
sleeping and unhelpful beliefs and attitudes around sleep. In
addition, unhelpful behaviors can have a direct impact on the
physiological systems controlling sleep. For example, vari-
ability in the timing of sleep-wake behaviors can create cir-
cadian dysregulation, and excessive time in bed can diffuse the
homeostatic drive for deep sleep and can also lead to condi-
tioned arousal. Finally, psychophysiological studies indicate an
increased 24-hour metabolic rate, elevated cortisol levels par-
ticularly in the presleep and early sleep period, elevated fast
(waking) electroencephalogram activity, and heightened re-
gional brain activity during sleep among individuals with
insomnia.6,23,24 These ﬁndings collectively support the theory
that physiological hyperarousal is an additional signiﬁcant
factor for many patients in the etiology of this sleep disorder.

Deﬁnition of behavioral and psychological treatments
Several options are available for treating insomnia, including
a range of pharmacotherapies and nonpharmacological ap-
proaches. Various psychological and behavioral therapies have
been speciﬁcally developed for insomnia treatment, and a
number of complementary and alternative strategies (eg, dietary
supplements, acupuncture) have also been used. This review
focuses on psychological and behavioral therapies for insomnia.
The nature and focus of these treatments vary considerably, but
they are all designed to reduce or eliminate 1 or more of the
putative factors that perpetuate insomnia,
including sleep-
disruptive arousal and/or habits and conditioning factors that
sustain insomnia over time. Among these therapies are a range
of single-component therapies, each of which targets a speciﬁc
subset of insomnia-perpetuating factors. Second-generation
therapies that evolved from the various single-component
therapies combine several such treatments to constitute a
more comprehensive, multicomponent intervention approach.

Table 1 provides a brief description of each of the therapies
considered in this review.

Many of the interventions described herein can be delivered
using a variety of methods. In describing delivery methods, we
use the term “in-person, one-on-one,” which involves a ther-
apist providing a patient with treatment in individual, one-on-
one therapy visits. However, the in-person group format has also
been used, in which such treatment is provided by a therapist to a
group of patients. The self-help format can include self-help
books or other written materials that provide treatment in-
struction, audio recordings, or prerecorded video treatment
sessions. Internet-based delivery has also been used for one-on-
one or group delivery and for self-help interventions. Telephone
and telehealth delivery have also been used in the delivery of
insomnia treatments, either with the patient traveling to a clinic
with telehealth services (with the provider in a different location) or
with the patient at home engaging with the provider using a
telephone or online service for real-time interactions. This review
includes all delivery modalities for each intervention.

Measurement of insomnia treatment outcomes
A variety of approaches can be taken to measure the effects of
behavioral and psychological
in-
cluding questionnaires, daily sleep diaries, polysomnography
(PSG), and wrist actigraphy. To address this variability in
measurement approaches, standardized assessment instruments
have been proposed for insomnia research.25 Current deﬁnitions
of insomnia disorder include reports of both nighttime symp-
toms (difﬁculties with sleep initiation, maintenance, and/or
duration) and daytime consequences attributed to insomnia
(eg, fatigue, mood disturbance, memory impairment). Thus,
treatment measures assessing the impact of behavioral and
psychological treatments on insomnia should capture both
domains.2 Global measures of sleep disturbances provide an
index of the nature and severity of insomnia and can be ad-
ministered longitudinally to measure treatment response. The
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)26 and the Insomnia
Severity Index (ISI)27 are the two most widely used tools to
assess patient-reported sleep disturbances. The PSQI is a
measure of global sleep quality, and the ISI more speciﬁcally
measures self-reported insomnia symptom severity, but both are
categorical scales and provide total scores that can be evaluated
across treatment and accepted scale-speciﬁc criteria for de-
ﬁning treatment response and remission.26–28 These categorical
measures, especially insomnia remission, are increasingly
recognized as being of primary importance for evaluating the
beneﬁts of treatment.

In the study of insomnia treatments, nighttime sleep and
insomnia symptoms are most commonly measured with daily
sleep diaries,29 which capture information about the timing of
sleep (bedtime, rise time) in addition to individual sleep pa-
rameters, such as sleep latency (time to fall asleep initially),
wake after sleep onset (WASO; duration of nighttime wake-
fulness), and early morning awakenings (waking in advance of
the desired rise time) that are commonly the primary symptoms
targeted in insomnia treatments. Additional summary metrics
commonly derived from daily sleep diaries include total sleep time
and sleep efﬁciency (total sleep time/time in bed*100%). Daytime

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

napping/sleeping behaviors are also commonly tracked in
daily diaries when delivering treatment. The primary advantage
of sleep diaries is that they allow for the daily collection of
information on nighttime symptoms, making them less subject
to recall bias than questionnaires. Treatment effects are most
commonly assessed with aggregated mean-level changes in
individual sleep diary parameters across time, generally every 1
or 2 weeks, but increasingly, the variability of these parameters
across days is also being viewed as clinically important.

The objective evaluation of nighttime sleep and insomnia pa-
rameters with PSG and/or actigraphy provides complementary
information to sleep diaries and allows for a multimethod com-
prehensive assessment. However, objective evidence of sleep
disturbance is not required to establish a diagnosis of insomnia
disorder. When objective information is deemed necessary, wrist
actigraphy is a suggested option for clinicians to consider.30

Daytime impairments associated with insomnia commonly
include fatigue and/or sleepiness, mood disturbances, impaired
cognitive abilities, and overall reduced quality of life. Although
discrepancies may exist between the magnitude of self-reported
and objectively measured daytime impairments,31 daytime
impairment from insomnia is what often leads patients to seek
treatment. Thus, perceptions about daytime functioning are
important to target with behavioral and psychological treat-
ments. These daytime correlates of insomnia can be measured
by a variety of methods, but a limited number of valid and
reliable self-report instruments have been recommended for
insomnia research.25 Because daytime fatigue is among the most
common daytime symptoms of insomnia, various self-report
questionnaires designed to assess daytime fatigue have been
included in the studies included in this systematic review.
Finally, the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep
(DBAS) scale32 is a sleep-speciﬁc scale that is often included
in clinical insomnia trials to determine changes in unhelpful
sleep-related beliefs that can serve to perpetuate insomnia.

Statements and recommendations regarding
treatment of insomnia disorder
Assessment and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults has
been addressed in numerous recent practice guidelines and
clinical recommendation statements.3,30,33–36 Recent guide-
lines and statements that address comprehensive treatment for
chronic insomnia uniformly support the use of cognitive-
behavioral therapies (CBTs) as ﬁrst-line treatment for the
disorder.34,35,37,38 A report from the American College of
Physicians34 recommended that all adult patients receive CBT
for insomnia (CBT-I) as the ﬁrst-line treatment method for
chronic insomnia disorder. Likewise, in 2017 the Australian
Sleep Association developed recommendations for a limited set
of psychological and behavioral treatments for insomnia dis-
order, noting that CBT-I should be considered ﬁrst-line
treatment.39 The Australian Sleep Association also noted
emerging evidence for mindfulness-based treatments for in-
somnia. The British Association for Psychopharmacology’s
recent consensus statement also notes that CBT-I should be
considered a ﬁrst-line approach.38

The current AASM guideline differs from previous guide-
lines in 2 signiﬁcant ways.1 First, it is a comprehensive review

aWhen data were available, treatment efﬁcacy was examined in the fol-
lowing subgroups: (1) insomnia without comorbidities, (2) insomnia with
medical comorbidities, and (3) insomnia with psychiatric comorbidities.
bThe efﬁcacy of the following behavioral and psychological treatments was
evaluated: biofeedback, BTIs, CBT-I, cognitive therapy, intensive sleep
retraining, mindfulness, relaxation therapy, paradoxical intention, sleep
hygiene, sleep restriction therapy, and stimulus control. cControl condi-
tions examined: (1) sleep hygiene or sleep education, (2) pharmacologic—

of both single-component and multicomponent psychological
and behavioral interventions. Second, it is designed to com-
plement the existing AASM guidelines speciﬁcally related to
pharmacological treatments for insomnia disorder, which were
published in 2017.3

Meta-analytic reviews
Individual, group, Internet-based, and self-help CBT-I methods
have also been the subject of numerous meta-analyses.40–52 A
recent comprehensive meta-analysis of individual, group, and
self-help cognitive and behavioral therapies49 showed robust
clinical improvements in numerous sleep-related outcomes
including questionnaires (ISI and PSQI) and sleep diary metrics
(eg, sleep efﬁciency, WASO, and sleep onset latency). Com-
parable improvements were also shown in a meta-analysis of
insomnia comorbid with medical or psychiatric conditions,50
although the magnitude of improvement was greater among
patients with psychiatric vs medical comorbidities. Several
meta-analyses have also found clinically signiﬁcant improve-
ments with internet-based CBT-I,40,48,51,52 suggesting that
multiple delivery modalities can be used to provide treatment
to patients with insomnia disorder.

Previous AASM practice guidelines for and behavioral
and psychological treatments of insomnia
The initial (1999) practice parameters53 found the strongest
evidence for stimulus control therapy (identiﬁed as a “treatment
standard”); somewhat weaker evidence in support of relaxation
therapy, paradoxical intention, and biofeedback (identiﬁed as a
“guideline”); and the weakest evidence for multicomponent
CBT and sleep restriction therapy (identiﬁed as an “option”),
reﬂecting treatment trends and the existing literature of that time
period. An update of those parameters was published in 2006.54

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

Based on review of the evidence since the previous publication,
stimulus control, relaxation training, and CBT (with or without
relaxation) were recommended in the update as showing
the strongest evidence for efﬁcacy (deﬁned as a “standard”).
Sleep restriction therapy, multicomponent behavioral therapy
(without cognitive therapy), biofeedback and paradoxical in-
tention were also found to be “individually effective therapies
in the treatment of chronic insomnia (Guideline).” Sleep hy-
giene alone was not identiﬁed as an effective single-component
therapy in any of these reports. To date, there have been
no speciﬁc guidelines that address the superiority of one
behavioral or psychological treatment over another based
on direct comparisons, and this remains a limitation of the
current guidelines.

The present guidelines represent a further advancement in the
establishment of clinical practice guidelines in that the speciﬁc
recommendations offered herein are based on the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) process (see “Grade Assessment for Developing
Recommendations” below), which uses efﬁcacy data and an
assessment of the quality of the evidence, patient values and
preferences, beneﬁts vs harms, and resource utilization to in-
form the ﬁnal recommendation statements, with a goal of im-
proving patient-centered care. We believe that these guidelines
are based on the most comprehensive review of available ev-
idence and analysis to date. All single-component therapies (eg,
stimulus control alone) and multicomponent therapies (ie,
CBT-I and BTI) for which evidence was available were ex-
amined in our review. In addition to an analysis of efﬁcacy data
for pooled patient populations, we attempted to determine the
efﬁcacy of treatment for subgroups of patients such as those
with and without identiﬁed comorbidities that might affect
sleep (ie, medical or psychiatric conditions). We also
attempted to examine whether outcomes varied across delivery
methods and which delivery method seemed most efﬁcacious.
Limitations in the available evidence, including heterogeneity
across study samples and methods, did not allow for compar-
ative meta-analysis or speciﬁc recommendations; however,
delivery methods were still considered in formulating the
recommendations and are discussed in detail.

METHODS

Expert task force
The AASM commissioned a task force (TF) of sleep medicine
clinicians and researchers with expertise in behavioral and
psychological treatments of chronic insomnia disorder. The TF
professionals were required to disclose all potential conﬂicts of
interest, per the AASM’s conﬂicts of interest policy, before
being appointed to the TF and throughout the research and
writing of these documents. In accordance with the AASM’s
conﬂicts of interest policy, individuals were not allowed to be
appointed to the TF if they reported a professional or ﬁnancial
conﬂict that might diminish the integrity, credibility, or ethical
standards of the guideline. Individuals reporting professional
or ﬁnancial conﬂicts that represented potential bias but did not
prohibit participation in the development of the guideline

agreed to recuse themselves from discussion or writing re-
sponsibilities related to the conﬂicts. All relevant conﬂicts of
interest are listed in the Disclosures section.

Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes
questions and clinical signiﬁcance thresholds
Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) ques-
tions were developed by the TF to assess (1) the efﬁcacy of in-
terventions and (2) the efﬁcacy of different delivery methods
(Table 2). The AASM board of directors approved the ﬁnal list
of questions before the literature searches.

Through consensus, the TF then developed a list of patient-
oriented, clinically relevant outcomes to determine the efﬁcacy
of the interventions and delivery methods. The outcomes and/or
measurement tools that were employed in the research literature
were rated by relative importance for clinical decision-making;
outcomes deemed most important for decision-making were
considered “critical,” and the remaining outcomes were con-
sidered “important.”

The TF set a threshold for each outcome/measurement tool
to determine whether the mean treatment vs control differences
in the outcomes assessed at posttreatment were clinically sig-
niﬁcant. The clinical signiﬁcance threshold was deﬁned as the
minimum level of improvement in the outcome of interest that
would be considered clinically important to clinicians and
patients. For the PICO question on the efﬁcacy of interventions,
thresholds based on the mean difference between treatment and
control at posttreatment were used for most outcomes; however,
standardized mean differences were used when the TF con-
cluded that the interpretation of effect sizes would be more
meaningful (Table 3). For the PICO question on the efﬁcacy of
thresholds were set for these
different delivery methods,
methods. Clinical signiﬁcance thresholds were determined
based on a TF literature review of commonly used thresholds
including past AASM guidelines.3 Where no clearly established
threshold values could be determined, the TF used the literature
review, clinical judgment, and experience to establish a clinical
signiﬁcance threshold based on consensus. A summary of the
clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for the outcome measures is
presented in Table 3.

Literature searches, evidence review, and
data extraction
Literature searches were performed using the PubMed and
PsycINFO databases for each PICO question (see supplemental
material for search strings). The initial search was performed in
January 2017 with no date limits, resulting in 532 unique hits.
The publications cited in the 2006 review54 were also included
if they met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review.
An updated literature search was performed in January 2018,
resulting in 431 additional unique hits. In February 2019, a
subsequent literature search was conducted to identify recently
published literature, dating from December 2016 to January
2019, resulting in 114 unique hits. The PsycINFO search be-
tween January 2018 and March 2019 identiﬁed an additional
29 publications. A ﬁnal literature search was performed in
February 2020, using both the PubMed and PsycINFO data-
bases, and resulted in 73 unique hits. Finally, the TF reviewed

previously published guidelines, systematic reviews, and meta-
analyses to identify references that may have been missed during
the prior searches. The TF identiﬁed 65 additional articles through
this spot-check process for a total of 1,274 articles that were
screened for inclusion/exclusion in the systematic review.

Initial screening by title and abstract was performed by pairs
of TF members. Discrepancies were resolved by a third re-
viewer. Articles were included for further review if they fo-
cused on the efﬁcacy of behavioral or psychological treatments
for chronic insomnia in adults, addressed at least 1 of the PICO
questions, and included at least 1 of the outcomes of interest.
Full publications were reviewed by pairs of TF members and
were excluded if they did not provide evidence for any PICO
questions. The full inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in
the supplemental materials.

A total of 124 articles from the literature searches were ac-
cepted and considered for meta-analysis and evidence grading.
Speciﬁc data elements of all accepted studies were extracted into
evidence tables (not published) to address each PICO question.
Upon review of these articles, 89 studies were determined to
be suitable for meta-analysis and/or the GRADE process. An
evidence base ﬂow diagram is presented in Figure 1.

Statistical methods, meta-analysis, and interpretation
of clinical signiﬁcance
Meta-analyses were performed on outcomes of interest for each
PICO question (Table 2), using Review Manager 5.3 software

(The Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom) when
at least 3 studies with the relevant outcome of interest were
available for data pooling. Depending on the number of studies,
data analysis proceeded in 1 of 2 ways:

1. If 3 or more studies were available, a meta-analysis
was conducted. The meta-analysis results were then
subgrouped by delivery methods (Table 4), and pooled
results are reported for each outcome in the
Results section.

2. When fewer than 3 studies were available, studies are
described individually and were not subjected to
meta-analysis.

Results were also subgrouped by patient populations, which
included patients with insomnia with and without comorbidities
(Table 5). Data were excluded from the subgroup analyses if
studies included a mixed population where the data could not be
categorized in any 1 of the subgroups. For delivery method
comparisons, the TF chose to compare all alternative delivery
methods to in-person, one-on-one delivery, which historically
has been the most common and standard delivery method
employed. As we have noted, when fewer than 3 studies were
available for any delivery method, studies are described indi-
vidually and were not subjected to meta-analysis.

For each outcome, unadjusted posttreatment data were used
for all statistical analyses. Mean differences were calculated for
all outcomes with the exception of sleep quality, ISI, daytime

Description

Patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder (1) in the absence of identiﬁed
sleep-disruptive comorbidities, or (2) who met the criteria for “primary insomnia”
based on earlier diagnostic systems (eg, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR)
Patients diagnosed with both chronic insomnia disorder and concurrent psychiatric
comorbidities (eg, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, or alcohol and
substance use)

fatigue, and the DBAS scale, for which standardized mean
differences were calculated. Some studies had data presented as
standard errors, and in these cases, the data were converted into
standard deviations so that the study could be included. There
were also some studies that reported data in the form of median
and interquartile range. These, too, were converted into data
expressed as means and standard deviations.55,56 The pooled
results for each continuous outcome measure are expressed
herein as the mean difference or standardized mean differences
between the intervention and comparator groups. The pooled
results for the dichotomous outcome measures are expressed as
the risk difference between the intervention and comparator. All
analyses were performed using a random-effects model with the
results displayed as a forest plot. If outcome data were not
presented in the format necessary for statistical analysis (ie,
mean, standard deviation, and sample size), or data were pre-
sented only in graphical formats, then the authors were con-
tacted to obtain the necessary data.

Interpretation of clinical signiﬁcance for the outcomes of
interest was conducted by comparing the mean difference in
effect size, or the risk difference for dichotomous outcomes, of
each treatment approach to the clinical signiﬁcance threshold.

GRADE assessment for developing recommendations
The assessment of evidence quality was performed according to
the GRADE process for the purposes of making clinical practice

recommendations.57,58 GRADE assessment was only performed
for the ﬁrst PICO question on the efﬁcacy of interventions; the
TF determined that there was insufﬁcient evidence for delivery
method comparisons (the second PICO question) to warrant
recommendations. Quality of evidence was assessed only for
the studies reporting data that could be included in the meta-
analysis. The TF assessed the following 4 components to de-
termine the direction and strength of a recommendation:

1. Quality of evidence: Based on an assessment of the

overall risk of bias (blinding, allocation concealment,
selective reporting), imprecision (95% conﬁdence
interval [CI] relative to the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold, total sample size < 200), inconsistency
(I2 cutoff of 50%), indirectness (study population), and
publication bias (funding sources), the members of the
TF determined that their overall conﬁdence that the
estimated effect found in the body of evidence was
representative of the true treatment effect that typical
adult patients with insomnia would experience. The
overall quality of the evidence was based on outcomes
that the TF deemed critical for decision-making. The
TF considered remission and responder rates as the most
inﬂuential critical outcomes in determining the quality
of evidence.

2. Beneﬁts vs harms: Based on any harms/adverse effects

reported within the accepted literature and on the clinical

experience and expertise of the TF, the TF determined
whether the beneﬁcial outcomes of using each
intervention outweighed any harms.

3. Patient values and preferences: Based on the clinical

experience and expertise of the TF members and any data
published on the topic relevant to patient preferences for
behavioral and psychological interventions for
insomnia, the TF determined whether patient values
and preferences would be consistent across the majority
of patients and whether patients would use the
interventions based on the body of evidence.

4. Resource use: Based on the clinical experience and

expertise of the TF members, the TF determined whether
the accessibility and costs associated with each
treatment approach compared favorably to those
associated with alternative treatments. Information on
costs to both patients and the health care system
were considered.

A summary of each GRADE domain is provided herein after

the detailed evidence review for each intervention.

Public comment and ﬁnal approval
Drafts of the systematic review with supplemental materials
and accompanying clinical practice guideline1 were made avail-
able for public comment for a 2-week period on the AASM
website. AASM members, the general public, and other relevant
stakeholders were invited to provide feedback on the drafts. The
TF considered all the comments received and made decisions
about whether to revise the draft based on the scope and feasibility
of the comments. The public comments and revised documents
were submitted to the AASM board of directors, which subse-
quently approved the ﬁnal documents for publication.

The AASM expects this systematic review to have an impact
on professional behavior, patient outcomes, and possibly health
care costs. This review reﬂects the state of knowledge at the time
of publication and will be reviewed and updated as new in-
formation becomes available.

RESULTS

The aims of the current systematic review and data analyses
were to inform PICO questions assessing the efﬁcacy
of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic in-
somnia and treatment efﬁcacy across delivery methods. We
found evidence for the following interventions: CBT-I, BTIs,
stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training,
sleep hygiene, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, intensive
sleep retraining (ISR), and mindfulness. No studies meeting
our inclusion criteria were found for cognitive therapy as a
single-component treatment.

Below are detailed summaries of the evidence identiﬁed in
the literature searches and the statistical analyses performed by
the TF to inform recommendations within the clinical practice
guideline.1 All ﬁgures and a summary of the study character-
istics can be found in the supplemental materials. All values of
the critical outcomes results are reported in the following text.

For important outcomes results, values are only reported if the
results met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold. Each evidence
summary is accompanied by a discussion of the quality of evi-
dence, balance of beneﬁts and harms, patient values and prefer-
ences, and resource use considerations that contributed to the
development of the clinical practice recommendations, which are
provided in the accompanying clinical practice guideline.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 66 randomized controlled
trials (RCTs)59–122 which could be included in the meta-analyses
examining the effect of CBT-I vs control in adult patients with
chronic insomnia. Forty-nine studies59–61,63–75,77–107,118,119 re-
ported at least 1 of the critical outcomes (Table 3). In addition,
17 RCTs123–139 provided data not suitable for meta-analyses but
were included as supporting evidence. The delivery formats of
CBT-I in these studies included in-person one-on-one, in-
person group, Internet-based delivery, self-help, and video
delivery. The control groups received treatment as usual, wait
list control, minimal intervention (eg, sleep hygiene education),
placebo behavioral treatment (eg, quasi-desensitization), or
placebo drug.

The related ﬁgures and tables are Figures S1–S76 and Tables
S1–S28 in the supplemental material. Summaries of the meta-
analyses conducted are provided in Tables S29–S32. A sum-
mary of the evidence, the results of the statistical analysis, and
whether the results met the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for
each outcome (Table 3) are provided beginning below.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section for sleep quality, sleep
latency, and WASO.

Sleep quality: Meta-analysis of 19 studies60,61,63,69,71,74,75,79,80,82,84,
86,94,98,100,101,103,105,140 reporting posttreatment comparisons of
diary-determined sleep quality between CBT-I and control
showed an effect size of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.28—0.61 higher)
favoring CBT-I compared with control; these results did not
reach the threshold for clinical signiﬁcance established by the
TF (Figure S1).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, diary-determined
sleep quality was reported in 2 studies of patients with insomnia in
the absence of comorbidities.98,101 One study101 showed a clin-
ically signiﬁcant posttreatment difference, with an effect size of
1.48 (95% CI, 0.64–2.32 higher) favoring CBT-I compared with
control (Table S1). The other study98 did not show a clinically
signiﬁcant posttreatment difference between CBT-I and con-
trol, with an effect size of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.29 lower–0.61
higher) (Table S1). One study in patients with insomnia and
comorbid psychiatric conditions61 showed a clinically signiﬁ-
cant posttreatment difference with an effect size of 0.85 (95%
CI, 0.23–1.46 higher) favoring CBT-I over control (Table S2).

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

Meta-analysis of 3 studies in patients with insomnia and comorbid
medical conditions69,79,140 reported an effect size of 0.14 (95%
CI, 0.60 lower–0.88 higher) favoring CBT-I over control; these
results did not reach the threshold for clinical signiﬁcance
established by the TF69 (Figure S2).

Meta-analysis of 21 studies59–61,64,72–75,86,91–93,101,104,106,109,112–115,119
reporting PSQI-determined sleep quality (ie, PSQI total score)
showed an effect size of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54–0.78 lower) fa-
voring CBT-I over control (Figure S3); this effect was above the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold established by the TF.

Two studies64,101 reporting PSQI-determined sleep quality
for patients with insomnia and no comorbidities showed clin-
ically signiﬁcant posttreatment differences, with effect sizes
of 0.55 (95% CI, 1.24 lower–0.14 higher) and 1.67 (95% CI,
0.80–2.53 lower), respectively, favoring CBT-I over control
(Table S3). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 4 studies61,73,93,106 in
patients with insomnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions
showed a clinically signiﬁcant posttreatment difference with an
effect size of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.53–1.06 lower) favoring CBT-I over
control (Figure S4). Meta-analysis of 5 studies,76,91,114,115,119
including patients with insomnia and comorbid medical con-
ditions, showed an effect size of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.60–1.13
lower), which met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold favoring
CBT-I over control (Figure S5). The quality of evidence for
sleep quality ranged from low to moderate because of impre-
cision and a risk of bias.

5
studies61,84,100,141,142 reporting diary-determined sleep quality
were included in the meta-analysis of in-person one-on-one
delivery compared with another delivery modality (Figure S6).
One study141 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with
group delivery showed an effect size of 0.46 favoring in-person
one-on-one delivery over group delivery (95% CI, 0.25 lower–
1.18 higher). Three studies84,100,142 comparing in-person de-
livery with Internet delivery reported an effect size of 0.06
favoring in-person one-on-one delivery over Internet delivery
(95% CI, 0.99 lower–1.12 higher) (Figure S6). Out of 2
studies141,142 comparing in-person with telephone delivery, 1
study141 reported an effect size of 0.57 favoring in-person one-
on-one delivery over telephone delivery (95% CI, 0.18 lower–
1.31 higher), which met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
(Figure S6). The other study142 had an effect size of 0.27 (95%
CI, 0.75 lower–0.21 higher) favoring telephone delivery and did
not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold when compared with
in-person one-on-one delivery. One study61 comparing in-
person one-on-one with self-help delivery met the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold, with an effect size of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.33
lower–1.64 higher) favoring in-person one-on-one delivery of
CBT-I over self-help (Figure S6).

Two studies59,143 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery
with in-person group delivery reported clinically signiﬁ-
cant mean effect sizes of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.27–1.05 lower) and

1.79 (95% CI, 1.09–2.50 lower), respectively, for PSQI-
determined sleep quality favoring in-person one-on-one de-
livery over group delivery (Figure S7). One study61 comparing
in-person one-on-one delivery with self-help delivery also met
the clinical signiﬁcance threshold with an effect size of 0.61
(95% CI, 1.34 lower–0.11 higher), favoring in-person one-on-
one delivery over self-help delivery (Figure S7).

Sleep latency: Meta-analysis of 4759–61,63–66,68–75,77,78,80–86,88–105,107,118,119,
140,144 studies reporting diary-determined sleep latency showed a
mean difference of 12.68 minutes lower (95% CI, 10.48–14.88
minutes lower) for CBT-I compared with control, which did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S8).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, diary-determined
sleep latency was reported in 10 studies64,66,78,85,88,90,98,101,107,144 of
patients with insomnia and no comorbidities with a mean
difference of 12.82 minutes lower (95% CI, 7.56–18.09
minutes lower) for CBT-I compared with control (Figure S9);
this difference did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance thresh-
old. Five studies61,73,81,99,102 of patients with insomnia and
comorbid psychiatric conditions showed a mean difference of
30.60 minutes lower (95% CI, 20.37–40.83 minutes lower)
for CBT-I compared with control
(Figure S10). Eleven
studies65,69,89,91–93,95–97,119,140 in patients with insomnia and
comorbid medical conditions reported a mean difference of
10.63 minutes lower (95% CI, 5.83–15.44 minutes lower) for
CBT-I compared with control (Figure S11). Only the studies1
reporting insomnia in individuals with comorbid psychiatric
conditions met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold.

Meta-analysis of 6 studies77,88,96,97,107,140 reporting PSG-de-
termined sleep latency also did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold (Figure S12). One107 out of 2,107 studies reporting
PSG-determined sleep latency in patients with insomnia and no
comorbidities showed a clinically signiﬁcant posttreatment
difference of 31.50 minutes lower (95% CI, 15.52–47.48
minutes lower) for CBT-I compared with control (Table S4).
The other study88 did not show a clinically signiﬁcant post-
treatment difference favoring CBT-I. Meta-analysis of 3
studies96,97,140 reporting PSG-determined sleep latency in pa-
tients with insomnia and comorbid medical conditions did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S13). The
quality of evidence for sleep latency ranged from low to
moderate because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

a mean difference of 11.68 minutes lower (95% CI, 0.28–23.08
minutes lower) and 7.49 minutes higher (95% CI, 7.28 minutes

thod (Figure S14). One study61 comparing in-person one-on-one
delivery with self-help delivery and another study95 comparing
in-person one-on-one delivery with video delivery reported
mean differences of 2.70 minutes lower (95% CI, 13.25 minutes
lower–7.85 minutes higher) and 4.61 minutes lower (95% CI,
0.21–9.01 minutes lower) in the in-person one-on-one delivery
arm, respectively (Figure S14). None of the comparisons re-
ported results that met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for in-
person delivery compared with the other delivery methods.

WASO: Meta-analysis of 44 studies59–61,63–66,68–75,77,80–102,
105,118,119,140,144 reporting diary-determined WASO showed a
posttreatment mean difference of 18.96 minutes lower (95% CI,
15.46–22.46 minutes lower) favoring CBT-I over control, a
result that did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
(Figure S15).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, 9 studies64,66,85,87,
88,90,98,101,144 reporting diary-determined WASO found a clini-
cally signiﬁcant posttreatment difference of 22.83 minutes
(95% CI, 11.04 minutes–34.63 minutes lower) favoring CBT-I
over control in patients with insomnia and no comorbidities
(Figure S16). In contrast, 5 studies61,73,81,99,102 of patients with
insomnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions reported a mean
posttreatment nonclinically signiﬁcant difference of 14.55
minutes lower (95% CI, 2.05–26.84 minutes lower; Figure S17)
for CBT-I vs control. Eleven65,69,89,91–93,95–97,119,140 studies of
patients with insomnia and comorbid medical conditions showed a
mean difference of 19.36 minutes lower (95% CI, 11.90–27.31
minutes lower) for CBT-I compared with control (Figure S18),
which did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold.

Eleven studies64,65,69,70,72,85,97,99–101,140 reporting actigraphy-

Meta-analysis of 7 studies77,87,88,96,97,99,140 reporting PSG-
the clinical signiﬁcance
determined WASO did not meet
threshold for favoring CBT-I over control (Figure S22). Two
studies87,88 assessed WASO by PSG in patients with insomnia
and no comorbidities; only 1 reported a clinically signiﬁcant
posttreatment difference of 27.94 minutes lower (95% CI,
6.63–49.25 minutes lower) favoring CBT-I over control (Table
S6). One study99did not report a clinically signiﬁcant post-
treatment difference in PSG WASO between CBT-I and control
among patients with insomnia and comorbid psychiatric con-
ditions (Table S7). Meta-analysis of 3 studies96,97,140 reporting
WASO measured by PSG in patients with insomnia and

comorbid medical conditions97 did not meet the clinical sig-
niﬁcance threshold (Figure S23). The quality of evidence for
WASO ranged from low to moderate because of imprecision
and a risk of bias.

Eleven studies67,92,124,126,127,129,131,133,134,137,138 were not in-
cluded in the meta-analyses because the posttreatment mean
difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings. These studies
showed posttreatment intervention improvements in WASO.
For direct comparisons of delivery methods, 3 studies59,141,145
reporting diary-determined WASO were included in a meta-
analysis comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with in-
person group delivery (Figure S24). A posttreatment WASO
difference of 0.34 minutes higher (95% CI, 9.75 minutes lower–
26.99 minutes higher) was found favoring the group delivery
method, a difference that did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold. Meta-analysis of 3 studies84,100,142 comparing in-
person one-on-one delivery with Internet delivery showed a
posttreatment difference in WASO of 10.11 minutes lower
(95% CI, 2.00–18.23 minutes lower) favoring the in-person
one-on-one method; these results also did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S24). Two studies141,142 com-
paring in-person one-on-one delivery with telephone delivery
reported a mean difference in WASO of 19.23 minutes higher
(95% CI, 4.82 minutes lower–43.28 minutes higher) and 8.01
minutes higher (95% CI, 10.18 minutes lower–26.20 minutes
higher), respectively, for the in-person one-on-one method at
posttreatment (Figure S24). These results did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold. One study61 comparing in-
person one-on-one delivery with self-help delivery reported a
mean difference of 4.00 minutes lower (95% CI, 26.54 minutes
lower–18.54 minutes higher) for the in-person one-on-one
method (Figure S24). One study95 comparing in-person one-
on-one delivery with video delivery showed a mean difference
of 3.16 minutes lower (95% CI, 8.37 minutes lower–2.05
minutes higher) for the in-person one-on-one method (Figure
S24). Neither of the results met the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds.
For comparisons of delivery methods, 2 studies100,143 re-
ported actigraphy-assessed WASO. One study143 comparing in-
person one-on-one delivery with group delivery showed a mean
difference of 3.30 minutes lower for group delivery (95% CI,
3.10 minutes lower–9.70 minutes higher) (Table S8). Another
study100 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with Internet
delivery reported a mean posttreatment difference of 4.80
minutes lower (95% CI, 16.27 minutes lower–6.67 minutes
higher) for in-person one-on-one delivery (Table S9). Re-
sults did not show clinically signiﬁcance differences between
delivery methods.

Remission rate: Meta-analysis of 25 studies60,61,63,64,72,73,75,
77–80,85,87,89,90,94–97,99–101,106,107,119 reported a clinically signiﬁcant
33% higher (95% CI, 28–39% higher) remission rate for CBT-I
compared with control (Figure S25).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, meta-analysis of
7 studies64,78,85,87,90,99,107 consisting of patients with insomnia
and no comorbidities showed a clinically signiﬁcant 46% higher
(95% CI, 33–58% higher) remission rate in the CBT-I group
than in the control group (Figure S26). Similarly, clinically

31% higher (95% CI, 13–48% higher) and 35% higher (95% CI,
27–42% higher) favoring CBT-I were found in these com-
parisons, respectively (Figure S27 and Figure S28). The
quality of evidence for remission rate ranged from low to
moderate because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Direct comparisons of delivery methods

Fourteen studies68,81–84,88,102,104,105,116,118,126,129,131 comparing
CBT-I with control could not be included in the meta-analysis
because the deﬁnition of remission rate used in the studies was not
consistent with the TF deﬁnition of remission rate or because the
posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
included 3
studies61,95,145 that met the TF’s deﬁnition of remission rate
(Table 3). One study145 compared in-person one-on-one de-
livery with in-person group delivery and reported a clinically
signiﬁcant 18% higher remission rate (95% CI, 6% lower–43%
higher) for the group method (Figure S29). Similarly, 1 study61
compared in-person one-on-one delivery with self-help delivery and
1 study95 compared in-person one-on-one delivery with video
delivery. The results of both studies met the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold, with the in-person one-on-one method showing 17%
higher (95% CI, 14% lower–49% higher) and 10% higher (95%
CI, 5% lower–26% higher) remission rates than did the self-help
and video delivery methods, respectively (Figure S29).

Responder rate: Meta-analysis of 16 studies60,65,66,71,73,75,79,
80,82,84,91–94,118,144 showed a clinically signiﬁcant 45% greater
responder rate (95% CI, 39–50% higher) for CBT-I vs control
(Figure S30). In subgroup analyses of patient populations, all
subgroups met the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds favoring the
CBT-I group over control. Two studies66,144 including patients
with insomnia and no comorbidities reported a clinically sig-
niﬁcant 26% higher (95% CI, 2% lower to 55% higher) and 44%
higher (95% CI, 31–57% higher) responder rate for CBT-I
(Table S10). Three studies73,92,93 included patients with in-
somnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions, with a clinically
signiﬁcant result of a 49% higher responder rate in the CBT-I
group (95% CI, 36–63% higher) (Figure S31). Similarly,
clinically signiﬁcant differences were noted from a meta-
analysis of 3 studies65,79,91 in patients with insomnia and
comorbid medical conditions, with a 58% higher (95% CI, 42–
73% higher) responder rate for CBT-I group (Figure S32). The
quality of evidence for responder rate ranged from low to
moderate because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Fourteen studies64,67,81,83,85,89,92,96,104,105,118,126,131,133 compar-
ing CBT-I with control could not be included in the meta-
analysis because the responder rate deﬁnitions in the studies
were not consistent with the TF’s deﬁnition of responder rate or
because the posttreatment mean difference could not be cal-
culated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

For the direct comparison of delivery methods, only 1 study84
reported a responder rate that met the deﬁnition set by the TF.

The study84 showed a 33% higher (95% CI, 8% lower–57%
higher) responder rate favoring in-person one-on-one delivery
over Internet delivery (Table S11).

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time.

98,100,101,103,105,109,113,140,144

Beliefs and attitudes about sleep: Sixteen studies60,75,80,91–93,95,
reported data acquired from the
DBAS scale for CBT-I vs control. Studies used different ver-
sions of the DBAS, including the 30-, 28-, 20-, 16-, and 10-item
versions. Results met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold with an
effect size of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.38–1.24 lower), favoring CBT-I
compared with control (Figure S33).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, DBAS scale
results were reported in 3 studies98,101,144 in patients with in-
somnia and no comorbidities. A meta-analysis showed clini-
cally signiﬁcant improvements in the treatment group, with
effect sizes of 1.21 lower (95% CI, 0.65–1.76 lower) favoring
(Figure S34). Meta-analysis of 5
CBT-I over control
studies91–93,95,140 including patients with insomnia and comorbid
medical conditions showed an effect size of 1.20 favoring the
CBT-I group (95% CI, 0.74–1.67 lower) over control for
lowering DBAS scores (Figure S35). These results met the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold favoring CBT-I when compared
with control. The quality of evidence for beliefs and attitudes
about sleep ranged from very low to low because of impreci-
sion, inconsistency, and a risk of bias.
Four studies92,107,133,134 were not

included in the meta-
analysis because the posttreatment mean difference could not
be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical
signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

For the direct comparison of delivery methods, of the 3
studies95,100,145 comparing delivery methods that
reported
posttreatment DBAS comparisons, only 195 met the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold favoring in-person one-on-one delivery over
video delivery, with an effect size of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.53–1.17 lower;
Figure S36). The other 2 studies,100,145 which compared in-
person one-on-one delivery with group and Internet delivery,
did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S36).

Daytime fatigue: Ten studies60,62,85,90,101,105,111,114,120,122 re-
ported data on daytime fatigue. Results of various tools such as
the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue In-
ventory, the Proﬁle of Mood States Fatigue subscale,
the
Fatigue Symptom Index, and the Flinders Fatigue Scale were
pooled. A meta-analysis of 10 studies60,62,85,90,101,105,111,114,120,122
showed an effect size of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.25–0.87 lower), fa-
voring CBT-I over control and meeting the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold (Figure S37).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, ﬁndings for all
3 patient subgroups met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for
daytime fatigue improvements favoring the CBT-I treatment.

comorbidities showed an effect size of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.18–1.74
lower) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.19–1.06 lower), respectively, fa-
voring CBT-I over control (Table S12). Only 1 study122 re-
ported on patients with insomnia and comorbid psychiatric
conditions, with an effect size of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.19–1.42
lower), favoring CBT-I over control (Table S13). Meta-anal-
ysis of 4 studies62,89,114,120 that included patients with insomnia
and comorbid medical conditions showed a mean effect size of
0.53 (95% CI, 0.22–0.84 lower), favoring CBT-I over control
(Figure S38). The quality of evidence for daytime fatigue
ranged from moderate to low because of imprecision and a risk
of bias.

Nine studies77,80,95,118,125,129,134,136,138 could not be included in
the meta-analysis because the posttreatment mean difference
could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Only 1 study142 directly compared in-person one-on-one
delivery of CBT-I with Internet and telehealth methods, with no
clinically signiﬁcant differences observed among the delivery
methods for reducing daytime fatigue (Table S14).
Insomnia severity: Meta-analysis of 30 studies59,60,62,63,73–75,
79–81,84–86,90,94–97,99–102,105,108,110,117,118,120,121,144 reporting insom-
nia severity measured by the ISI showed a clinically signiﬁcant
result with an effect size of 0.95 favoring the CBT-I intervention
(95% CI, 0.78–1.13 lower) over control (Figure S39).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations of

ISI-
severity, 6 studies85,90,101,110,117,144
determined insomnia
reporting on patients with insomnia and no comorbidities,
4 studies73,81,99,102 reporting on patients with insomnia and
comorbid psychiatric conditions, and 6 studies62,79,95,97,108,120
reporting on patients with insomnia and comorbid medical
conditions resulted in ISI score differences that met the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold favoring CBT-I over control in all 3
groups, with effect sizes of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.95–1.55 lower),
1.61 (95% CI, 1.16–2.05 lower), and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.30–1.04
lower), respectively (Figures S40–S42).

Three studies64–66 reported insomnia severity measured by
the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire. No clinically signiﬁcant
differences between CBT-I and control were noted using this
questionnaire (Figure S43).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations for the Insomnia
Symptom Questionnaire that determined insomnia severity,
there were 264,66 studies that included patients with insomnia and
no comorbidities. Of those, 1 study66 met the clinical signiﬁ-
cance threshold, with an effect size of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.15–1.57
lower; Table S15) favoring CBT-I over control. One study65
reported on patients with insomnia and comorbid medical con-
ditions and did not show clinically signiﬁcant differences between
CBT-I and control at posttreatment (Table S16). The quality of
evidence for insomnia severity ranged from low to moderate
because of imprecision, inconsistency, and a risk of bias.

Eight studies68,93,123,127,130,131,135,139 reporting insomnia se-
verity measured by the ISI and 1 study67 measured by the In-
somnia Symptom Questionnaire could not be included in the
meta-analysis because the posttreatment mean difference could
not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

In studies including direct comparisons of delivery methods
using the ISI to measure insomnia severity, a meta-analysis of
3 studies84,100,142 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with
Internet delivery showed a clinically signiﬁcant effect size of
0.61 (95% CI, 0.10–1.11 lower) favoring the in-person one-on-
one delivery method over the Internet method (Figure S44).
One study141 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with
telephone delivery and another95 comparing in-person one-on-
one delivery with video-delivered CBT-I both met the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold, with effect sizes of 0.67 (95% CI, 1.42
lower–0.09 higher) and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.21–0.93 lower), re-
spectively, favoring the in-person one-on-one delivery method
(Figure S44). Clinical signiﬁcance thresholds were not met in 2
studies59,141 that compared in-person one-on-one delivery with
group delivery and in 1 study142 comparing in-person one-on-
one delivery with telehealth delivery (Figure S44).
Nights with hypnotic use: Our literature search identiﬁed 5
studies83,91,92,103,109 reporting diary-determined nights per week
of hypnotic use; results of the meta-analysis did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for CBT-I vs control compar-
isons (Figure S45).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, 1 study88 that
included patients with insomnia and no comorbidities and a
second92 that included patients with insomnia and comorbid
psychiatric conditions did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold that would favor CBT-I over control for reducing
hypnotic use (Table S17 and Table S18). The quality of evi-
dence for nights with hypnotic use ranged from low to moderate
because of imprecision, inconsistency, and a risk of bias.

Data from 6 studies72,84,92,98,114,136 reporting hypnotic use
could not be included in the meta-analysis because the post-
treatment mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the
ﬁndings. No studies were found for direct comparisons of in-
person one-on-one delivery with the other delivery methods.

Number of nighttime awakenings: A total of 19

clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S46) for comparisons of
CBT-I and control.

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, 4 studies85,90,98,101
that included patients with insomnia and no comorbidities re-
ported no clinically signiﬁcant differences in the treatment
group when compared with control
(Figure S47). Two
studies61,81 included patients with insomnia and comorbid
psychiatric conditions; 161 was clinically signiﬁcant with 0.86
fewer awakenings favoring CBT-I (95% CI, 1.73–0.01 higher)
when compared with control (Table S19). Two studies89,119
reported patients with insomnia and comorbid medical condi-
tions; 1119 study met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold of 0.70
fewer awakenings favoring CBT-I (95% CI, 1.86 lower–0.46
higher) when compared with control (Table S20). The quality
of evidence for nighttime awakenings ranged from low to
moderate because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 4 studies118,134,137,138 reporting the diary-determined
number of nighttime awakenings could not be included in the

the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

In direct comparisons of delivery methods using diary-
determined data for the number of nighttime awakenings, a
meta-analysis of 3 studies84,100,142 comparing in-person one-on-
one delivery with Internet delivery, 1 study145 comparing in-
person one-on-one delivery with in-person group delivery and 1
study142 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with tele-
health delivery did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
for treatment group differences (Figure S48). One study61
comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with self-help de-
livery showed a clinically signiﬁcant result of 0.70 fewer
awakenings (95% CI, 0.06–1.34 lower), favoring the in-person
one-on-one delivery method (Figure S48).

when comparing CBT-I with control (Figure S49).

Similarly, in subgroup analyses of patient populations, no
clinically signiﬁcant CBT-I vs control differences were seen in a
meta-analysis of 11 studies64,66,78,85,87,88,90,98,101,107,144 reporting
diary-determined efﬁciency in patients with insomnia and no

Similarly, in subgroup analyses of patient populations, no
clinically signiﬁcant differences were seen in 2 studies64,66
reporting actigraphy-determined sleep efﬁciency in patients with
insomnia and no comorbidities, 1 study91 reporting actigraphy-
determined sleep efﬁciency in patients with insomnia and
comorbid psychiatric conditions, and 4 studies65,69,97,140 reporting
actigraphy-determined sleep efﬁciency among patients with
insomnia and comorbid medical conditions when comparing
CBT-I with control (Table S21 and Table S22, Figure S54).
Eight studies77,87,88,96,97,107,116,140 employing PSG also did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S55) in the
CBT-I vs control comparisons. In subgroup analyses, no
clinically signiﬁcant differences between CBT-I and control
were observed in a meta-analysis of 3 studies87,88,107 reporting
PSG-determined sleep efﬁciency in patients with insomnia and
no comorbidities (Figure S56). In addition, meta-analysis of 3
studies96,97,140 measuring sleep efﬁciency by PSG among pa-
tients with insomnia and comorbid medical conditions did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold when comparing CBT-I
with control (Figure S57). The quality of evidence for sleep

efﬁciency ranged from low to moderate because of imprecision
and a risk of bias.

Data from 9 studies67,92,118,124,126,133,134,137,139 measuring sleep
efﬁciency by diary, 2 studies135,139 by actigraphy, and 1 study67
by PSG could not be included in the meta-analysis because the
posttreatment mean differences could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Direct comparisons of delivery methods included a meta-
analysis of 3 studies59,141,145 reporting diary-determined sleep
efﬁciency that compared in-person one-on-one delivery with
group delivery and another 3 studies84,100,142 that compared in-
person one-on-one delivery with Internet delivery. None of
these studies met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for dif-
ferences among the delivery methods (Figure S58). Similarly, 1
study61 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with self-help
delivery, another141 comparing in-person one-on-one delivery
with telephone delivery, and 1 study95 comparing in-person
one-on-one delivery with video delivery did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S58) for differences
among the delivery methods. Two studies59,143 compared in-
person one-on-one delivery with group delivery and 1 study100
compared in-person one-on-one delivery with Internet delivery
measuring sleep efﬁciency by actigraphy (Figure S59). None of
these studies met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for com-
parisons among the delivery methods (Figure S59).
Total wake time: Meta-analysis of 15 studies59,65,66,71,73,79,84,
reported a clinically signiﬁcant 39.60
86,88,95,96,98,101,116,120
minutes lower (95% CI, 26.07–53.12 minutes lower) post-
treatment value of diary-determined total wake time for CBT-I
compared with control (Figure S60).

In subgroup analysis in patients with insomnia and no
comorbidities, meta-analysis of 4 studies66,88,98,101 reporting
total wake time measured by diary did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S61) for CBT-I vs control
comparisons. Similarly, 1 study73 reporting total wake time
measured by diary in patients with insomnia and comorbid
psychiatric conditions did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold for group differences (Table S23). Meta-analysis of 5
studies65,79,95,96,120 reporting diary-determined total wake time
in patients with insomnia and comorbid medical conditions
showed a clinically signiﬁcant 39.51 minutes lower (95% CI,
20.18–58.84 minutes lower) posttreatment total wake time for
the CBT-I group (Figure S62).

Meta-analysis of 3 studies65,66,101 measuring total wake time
by actigraphy did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for
CBT-I vs control comparisons (Figure S63). In subgroup
analysis in patients with insomnia and no comorbidities, 2

patients with insomnia and no comorbidities, 1 study88 mea-
sured total wake time by PSG showed a clinically signiﬁcant
37.92 minutes lower (95% CI, 6.57–69.27 minutes lower) total
wake time for CBT-I (95% CI, 6.57–69.27 minutes lower) when
compared with control (Table S26). The quality of evidence for
total wake time was low because of imprecision, inconsistency,
and risk of bias.

In comparisons of delivery methods, 2 studies59,141 compared
diary-determined total wake time of the in-person one-on-one
and group delivery methods, 1 study141 compared in-person one-
on-one delivery with telephone delivery, and 1 study95 compared in-
person one-on-one delivery with video delivery; none of these
comparisons met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure
S65) for group differences. One study84 comparing in-person
one-on-one delivery with Internet delivery showed a clinically
signiﬁcant greater posttreatment difference in total wake time of
29.90 minutes (95% CI, 7.28–52.52 minutes lower), favoring
the in-person one-on-one delivery method (Figure S65).
Total sleep time: A meta-analysis of 49 studies60,61,63–66,68–75,
77–105,107,116,119,120,140,144 comparing CBT-I with control for
diary-determined total sleep time did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold at posttreatment for CBT-I as com-
pared with control (Figure S66).

In subgroup analyses of patient populations, meta-analysis of
11 studies64,66,78,85,87,88,90,98,101,107,144 that included patients with
insomnia and no comorbidities reported total sleep time mea-
sured by diary showed results that did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold for CBT-I vs control (Figure S67). Meta-
analysis of 5 studies61,73,81,99,102 that considered diary-based
total sleep time among patients with insomnia and comorbid
psychiatric conditions showed a clinically 40.12 minutes
higher (95% CI, 19.05–61.19 minutes higher) total sleep time
in the CBT-I group (Figure S68). Meta-analysis of 13
studies65,69,79,89,91–93,95–97,119,120,140
reported diary-determined
total sleep time in patients with insomnia and comorbid med-
ical conditions; the results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold (Figure S69).

Meta-analysis of 12 studies64–66,70,72,85,91,97,99–101,140 reporting
total sleep time measured by actigraphy reported a clinical sig-
niﬁcant reduction of total sleep time of 19.15 minutes lower (95%
CI: 7.00–31.29 minutes lower) favoring control at the post-
treatment time for CBT-I as compared to control (Figure S70).
In subgroup analyses of patient populations, meta-analysis of
4 studies64,66,85,101 that used actigraphy in patients with insomnia
and no comorbidities found a clinically signiﬁcant 23 minutes
lower (95% CI, 51.11 minutes lower–5.11 minutes higher) total
sleep time for CBT-I as compared with control (Figure S71).
One study99 estimated total sleep time using actigraphy in
patients with insomnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions did
not reach the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for CBT-I at the
posttreatment comparison (Table S27). Meta-analysis of 5
studies65,69,91,97,140 reported actigraphy-determined total sleep
time in patients with insomnia and comorbid medical condi-
tions; the results also did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold (Figure S72) for group differences.

Nine studies77,87,88,96,97,99,107,116 measured by PSG did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold at posttreatment

for CBT-I as compared with control (Figure S73). In sub-
group analyses of patient populations, meta-analysis of 3
studies87,88,107 reporting total sleep time measured by PSG
among patients with insomnia and no comorbidities showed a
clinically signiﬁcant mean difference of 23.38 minutes higher
(95% CI, 20.18 minutes lower–66.93 higher) total sleep time,
(Figure S74). One study99
favoring CBT-I over control
reporting total sleep time measured by PSG in patients with
insomnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions reported a clinically
signiﬁcant 33.60 minutes higher (95% CI, 17.27 minutes lower–84.47
minutes higher) total sleep time for CBT-I at posttreatment
compared with control (Table S28). In patients with insomnia
and comorbid medical conditions, meta-analysis of 3 studies96,97,140
reporting PSG-determined total sleep time96,97 did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S75). The quality of
evidence for total sleep time ranged from very low to moderate
because of imprecision, inconsistency, and a risk of bias.

Data from 9 studies67,92,118,126,127,133,134,137,138 measuring total
sleep time by diary, 1 study126 by actigraphy, and 1 study67 by
PSG could not be included in the meta-analysis because the
posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.

Direct comparisons of

in-person one-on-one delivery
methods with self-help, group, Internet, video, telephone, and
telehealth delivery methods for CBT-I measuring diary-determined
total sleep time consisted of 8 studies61,84,95,100,141–143,145 (Figure
S76). Out of these, 1 study141 showed a clinically signiﬁcant
18.69 minutes higher (95% CI, 22.33 minutes lower–59.71
minutes higher) total sleep time for in-person one-on-one de-
livery when compared with telephone delivery of CBT-I
(Figure S76). The rest of the results, including 1 study61
comparing in-person one-on-one delivery with self-help de-
livery, 3 studies141,143,145 comparing in-person one-on-one with
group delivery, and 1 study95 comparing in-person one-on-one
delivery with video delivery, did not meet the clinical signiﬁ-
cance threshold for treatment group differences (Figure S76).
Meta-analysis of 3 studies84,100,142 comparing in-person one-on-
one delivery with Internet delivery showed clinically greater
total sleep time at posttreatment, favoring Internet delivery by
18.28 minutes higher (95% CI, 66.17 minutes lower–29.61
minutes higher) total sleep time (Figure S76).

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of CBT-I in patients
with chronic insomnia was rated as moderate for the critical
outcomes because of imprecision and a risk of bias (Table S29).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The overall beneﬁts of CBT-I for the treatment of insomnia were
determined to be moderate based on improvements in WASO,
remission rates, and responder rates that met the clinical sig-
niﬁcance thresholds established by the TF. Improvements in
these critical patient outcomes were evident for insomnia pa-
tients without comorbidities in addition to patients with
comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, which represent
the majority of patients seen for treatment. In addition, sub-
stantial evidence exists that treatment gains are durable over the

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

long-term without additional intervention. These beneﬁts, how-
ever, need to be considered in the context of potential harms.

Based on available evidence and the TF’s experience, the
principal harms associated with CBT-I may include symptoms
of daytime fatigue and sleepiness, mood impairment (eg, irri-
tability), and cognitive difﬁculties (eg, attention problems),
primarily restricted to the early stages of treatment when be-
havioral therapies are introduced. Studies146 have speciﬁcally
shown that daytime sleepiness is increased, and psychomotor
performance is impaired during the initial phase of sleep re-
striction therapy. At posttreatment, actigraphy TST was shorter
in CBT-I vs controls; however, this is sometimes expected as
part of sleep restriction therapy, and long-term follow-up data
and task force experience suggest that there is a subsequent
increase in total sleep time from the end of acute treatment to
long term follow up time points. Thus, patients should be
routinely warned about the possible dangers associated with
daytime sleepiness, such as drowsy driving, when undergoing
treatment. There is also the potential risk of nighttime falls when
patients are out of bed at night in some patient populations such
as older adults, those using sleep medications, or patients with
physical disabilities who are following stimulus control in-
structions. This is likely due to an anticipated reduction in total
sleep time in the early weeks of treatment if the patient adheres to
the recommendation to reduce time in bed. However, the TF
assessed that these harms are generally temporary, resolve as
treatment continues, are small in magnitude, and tolerable to most
patients. The TF noted that most RCTs of CBT-I did not include
assessments of side effects associated with treatment, so adequate
data on the direct harms associated with CBT-I are lacking. Based
on the available literature and their clinical experience, the TF
determined that the overall beneﬁts of CBT-I strongly outweighed
the harms for adults with chronic insomnia.

Resource use

Cost effectiveness was considered to favor CBT-I based on ad
hoc analysis which suggests signiﬁcant cost advantage with
CBT-I vs estimated costs of untreated chronic insomnia.147
Multiple formats are available for delivering CBT-I, with re-
source requirements ranging from moderate (eg, in person
one-on-one treatment) to minimal (eg, internet-delivered). In-
person one-on-one or group CBT-I carries substantial costs, owing
to the resources needed to train therapists to deliver the treatment
and space required for patients to be seen, but the emergence of
other formats for delivering CBT-I, such as via the internet,
represents a signiﬁcant cost savings in terms of resource use. Two
cost analysis studies148,149 showed that internet-delivered CBT-I
has a high probability of being more cost effective than both
treatment as usual and in-person group therapy. Cost-beneﬁt
estimates projected a net beneﬁt to the employer of $512 per
internet-delivered CBT-I participant and a return on investment
of 208%, stemming mostly from the effects on presenteeism.149
Available data are limited by small sample sizes and therefore
more systematic work is needed in this area.

Patient values and preferences

Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined that
the majority of patients with chronic insomnia would choose

CBT-I given its established efﬁcacy and safety. The limited
available data indicate that CBT-I is preferred to pharmaco-
logical treatment because it is perceived to have better long-term
efﬁcacy,150 to beneﬁt daytime symptoms more, and to have
fewer side effects.150,151 Furthermore, patients may prefer CBT-
I over other single-component therapy options,152 however the
relative preference for CBT-I compared to other available
treatments may differ by insomnia subgroup.126,153

Brief Therapies for Insomnia (BTIs)
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 8 RCTs154–161 that ex-
amined the effect of BTIs vs control treatment on adult patients
with chronic insomnia that were included in the meta-analyses.
In addition, 3 RCTs162–164 were identiﬁed that could not be
pooled with other studies but were reviewed as supporting
evidence. The delivery format of BTIs in the studies included
only in-person one-on-one delivery. One study was conducted
in the general adult population,161 3 studies154,155,159 were
conducted in older adults, 2 studies156,157 were conducted in
military veterans, and 1 study156 was conducted in patients
with insomnia not related to comorbid conditions. One
study155 delivered BTIs over the course of 2 sessions. Four
studies154,157,159,161 delivered BTIs over the course of 4 sessions.
One study156 also incorporated imagery rehearsal therapy for
nightmares into the BTI program, and the combined program
was delivered over the course of 8 sessions.

The related ﬁgures and tables are Figures S77–S84 and
Tables S33–S42. A summary of the ﬁndings is provided in
Table S43. A summary of the evidence, the results of the
statistical analysis, and whether the results met the clinical
signiﬁcance thresholds for each outcome (Table 3) are provided
beginning below. There were insufﬁcient data present for
subgroup analyses and delivery method analyses.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (the PSQI, actig-
raphy, PSG) are also reported in this section.

Sleep quality: Meta-analysis of 3 studies154,158,161 reporting
diary-determined sleep quality showed a clinically signiﬁcant
effect size of 1.73 (95% CI, 0.16 lower–3.62 points higher)
favoring BTI when compared with control (Figure S77). Meta-
analysis of 4 studies154–157 reporting PSQI-determined sleep
quality also showed a clinically signiﬁcant treatment group
difference with an effect size of 2.10 (95% CI, 4.24 lower–0.04
higher) favoring BTI over control (Figure S78). The quality of
the evidence for sleep quality was low because of imprecision,
inconsistency, and a risk of bias.

Data from 2 studies162,164 measuring sleep quality by diary
and from 1 study164 measuring sleep quality measured by the
included because the posttreatment mean
PSQI were not

difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Sleep latency: Meta-analysis of 7 studies154–156,158–161 reporting
diary-determined sleep latency showed a reduction of 10.54
minutes (95% CI, 9.25–11.83 minutes lower); these results did
not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for the treatment vs
control comparisons (Figure S79). Two studies154,156 reported
PSG-determined sleep latency. Neither of them met the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold (Table S33) for group differences. The
quality of the evidence for sleep latency was moderate because
of imprecision.

Data from 3 studies162–164 measuring sleep latency by diary
and from 2 studies163,164 of sleep latency measured by PSG could
not be included because the posttreatment mean differences
could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings.
WASO: Meta-analysis of 7 studies154–156,158–161 reporting diary-
determined WASO showed a 16.16-minutes-lower (95% CI,
8.83–23.48 minutes lower) mean value of WASO in the BTI
group at posttreatment compared with control; these results did
not meet the clinically signiﬁcant threshold (Figure S80). Two
studies154,158 assessing WASO by actigraphy and 2 studies154,156
employing PSG comparing BTI vs control did not meet
the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for treatment vs control
comparisons (Table S34 and Table S35). The quality of
the evidence for WASO was low because of imprecision
and inconsistency.

Three studies162–164 measuring WASO by diary and 2
studies163,164 measured by actigraphy and PSG were not in-
cluded in the meta-analysis because the posttreatment mean
difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Remission rate: Meta-analysis of 5 studies154,155,157–159 re-
ported a clinically signiﬁcant 34% (95% CI, 22–45% higher)
higher remission rate in the BTI group vs the control group
(Figure S81). The quality of the evidence for remission rate
was moderate because of imprecision.

Data from 2 studies162,163 measuring remission rate were not
included in the analysis because the remission rate deﬁnition in
the studies did not meet the TF deﬁnition of remission rate or
because the posttreatment mean difference could not be cal-
culated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Responder rate: Results of 2 studies157,160 reporting responder
rates met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for responder rate
for BTIs compared with control. Results were 26% higher (95%
CI, 5% lower–58% higher) and 21% higher (95% CI, 14%
lower–56% higher) for BTI, respectively (Table S36). The
quality of the evidence for responder rate was moderate because
of imprecision.

Data from 3 studies155,162,163 measuring responder rate were
not included in the analysis because the deﬁnition in the studies
did not meet the TF deﬁnition of responder rate or because the
posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance
of the ﬁndings.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for daytime
fatigue, nights with hypnotic use, and total wake time.

Beliefs and attitudes about sleep: Results of 1 study161
reporting beliefs and attitudes about sleep on the DBAS scale
did not show any clinically signiﬁcant BTI vs control differences
(Table S37). The quality of the evidence for beliefs and attitudes
about sleep was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Insomnia severity: Meta-analysis of 4 studies156,157,160,161
reporting insomnia severity on the ISI showed a clinically
signiﬁcant result with an effect size of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.18–1.43
lower) favoring BTI compared with control (Figure S82). The
quality of the evidence for insomnia severity was low because
of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 1 study162 were not included in the analysis because
the posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Number of nighttime awakenings: Two studies159,160 reported
the diary-determined number of nighttime awakenings, only 1
of which160 met the clinical signiﬁcance threshold of 0.50 fewer
nighttime awakenings (95% CI, 1.33 lower–0.33 higher) for
BTI than for control (Table S38). The other study159 did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold. The quality of the
evidence for number of nighttime awakenings was moderate
because of imprecision.
Sleep efﬁciency: Meta-analysis of 7 studies154,155,158–162
reporting diary-determined sleep efﬁciency showed no clini-
cally signiﬁcant group differences (Figure S83). Results of 2
studies154,158 reporting actigraphy-determined sleep efﬁciency
and 2 studies154,156 reporting PSG-determined sleep efﬁciency
also did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold when BTI
was compared with control (Table S39 and Table S40). The
quality of the evidence for sleep efﬁciency was moderate be-
cause of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 2 studies162,164 were not included in the analysis
because the posttreatment mean difference could not be cal-
culated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Total sleep time: Meta-analysis of 6 studies154,155,158–161 reporting
diary-determined total sleep time comparing BTI with con-
trol reported clinically signiﬁcant results favoring control over
BTI with a 23.89-minutes-lower (95% CI, 9.89–37.88 minutes
lower) total sleep time for BTI at posttreatment (Figure
S84). Two studies154,158 reported actigraphy-assessed total sleep
time, of which 1 study154 reported a clinically signiﬁcant
32.28-minutes lower (95% CI, 28.72–35.84 minutes lower)
total sleep time at posttreatment for BTI (Table S41) compared
with control. Of the 2 studies154,156 reporting PSG-determined

total sleep time, 1 study156 showed a clinically signiﬁcant
difference favoring control over BTI with a 34.10-minutes-
lower (95% CI, 77.23 minutes lower–9.03 minutes higher)
total sleep time at posttreatment (Table S42). The quality of
the evidence for total sleep time was moderate because
of imprecision.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of BTI in patients
with chronic insomnia was moderate for the critical outcomes
because of imprecision and a risk of bias (Table S43).

Beneﬁts vs harms

Based on clinically signiﬁcant differences in sleep quality and
insomnia remission rates compared with control, the TF de-
termined that the efﬁcacy was moderate. In addition, BTI also
improved sleep latency and WASO when compared with
control, although not at a level that exceeded clinical signiﬁ-
cance thresholds. At posttreatment, diary-reported total sleep
time was shorter for BTI vs control; however, this is sometimes
expected as part of sleep restriction therapy, and long-term
follow-up data and TF experience suggest that there is a sub-
sequent increase in total sleep time from the end of acute
treatment
to long-term follow-up timepoints. Notably, our
meta-analysis was based only on posttreatment differences.
Studies146 have speciﬁcally shown that daytime sleepiness is
increased and psychomotor performance is impaired during the
initial phase of sleep restriction therapy. Thus, patients should
be routinely warned about the possible dangers associated with
daytime sleepiness, such as drowsy driving, when undergoing
treatment. There is also the potential risk of nighttime falls in
speciﬁc populations such as older adults, those using sleep
medications, or patients with disabilities (eg, frail older adults)
following stimulus control instructions. Based on their clinical
experience, the members of the TF determined that the un-
desirable effects are minimal and that the balance of beneﬁts vs
harms strongly favors the use of BTI.

Resource use

No prior analysis has examined the resource use of BTI. It would
stand to reason that BTI requires fewer resources than CBT-I
and greater resources than single-component therapies such as
sleep restriction therapy or stimulus control.

Patient values and preferences

Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined that most
patients would choose BTI treatment given the beneﬁts of
treatment and the amount of time that this treatment requires (ie,
attending fewer treatment sessions).

Stimulus control
Our review identiﬁed 8 RCTs126,165–171 that compared stimulus
control to a control condition among adult patients with chronic
insomnia. Three studies165,168,169 focused on sleep onset in-
somnia, and 2 studies enrolled only older adults.126,170 Four
studies delivered stimulus control in a group format,126,168–170

and 2 studies165,166 delivered stimulus control in person, using a
one-on-one format.

The related ﬁgures and tables are Figures S85–S87 and
Tables S44–S52. A summary of ﬁndings is provided in Table
S53. A summary of the evidence, the results of the statistical
analysis, and whether the results met the clinical signiﬁcance
thresholds for each outcome (Table 3) are provided begin-
ning below.

There were insufﬁcient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of this
treatment among patients with psychiatric or medical comor-
bidities or to determine the relative efﬁcacy of different delivery
methods for this therapy.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate
and responder rate were considered the most important. The TF
also determined that only diary-reported outcomes were con-
sidered critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI,
actigraphy, PSG) are also reported in this section. None of
the studies identiﬁed in our literature review reported data
for responder rate.

Sleep quality: One study171 reported sleep quality measured by
diary. The results reported an effect size of 0.15 favoring
stimulus control treatment compared with control (95% CI, 0.15
lower–0.45 higher; Table S44). Results did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold.

One study166 reported sleep quality as measured by the PSQI.
The results reported an effect size of 0.86 favoring stimulus
control treatment compared with control (95% CI, 0.17–1.54
lower; Table S45). These results met the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold. The quality of evidence for sleep quality was low
because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 4 studies126,165,167,171 reporting diary-determined
sleep quality were not included in the analysis because post-
treatment mean differences could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the
ﬁndings. The studies reported postintervention differences in
sleep quality.

Sleep latency: Meta-analysis of 4 studies reporting sleep la-
tency measured by diary166,168,170,171 comparing stimulus control
treatment with control showed a posttreatment difference of
10.48 minutes lower (95% CI, 24.68 minutes lower–3.72
minutes higher) between treatment conditions. Results did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S85). The
quality of evidence for sleep latency was low because of im-
precision and risk of bias.

Data from 3 studies126,165,169 reporting diary-determined
sleep latency were not included in the analysis because the
posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings. All 3 studies126,165,169 reported improvements in
sleep latency with stimulus control compared with control. One
of these studies169 also reported a greater improvement in sleep
latency compared with the use of a sleep education comparator.

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

However, another study165 found no difference between stim-
ulus control and an imagery relief placebo for improving
sleep latency.

WASO: Meta-analysis of 3 studies166,170,171 reported that
WASO measured by diary comparing stimulus control with
control showed a posttreatment difference of 18.98 minutes
lower (95% CI, 41.78 minutes lower–3.83 minutes higher)
between treatment conditions. Results did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S86). One study166 also reported
WASO measured by actigraphy, and results did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold for posttreatment comparisons
(Table S46). The quality of evidence for WASO was low be-
cause of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data could not be included for 1 study126 reporting WASO
measured by diary and actigraphy because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Remission rate: One study171 reporting remission rate mea-
sured by ISI showed a clinically signiﬁcant 19% (95% CI,
6–31% higher) higher remission rate for stimulus control
compared with control (Table S47). The quality of evidence for
remission rate was moderate because of imprecision.

Two studies126,171 reported data on remission rate favoring
stimulus control; however, a posttreatment mean difference
could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and the quality of evidence
was not assessed.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitude about sleep, daytime fatigue, nights with hypnotic use,
and total wake time.

Insomnia severity: One study171 reporting insomnia severity
on the ISI showed a clinically signiﬁcant result with an effect
size of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.26–0.88 lower) favoring stimulus
control compared with control (Table S48).

Data from 2 studies126,171 reporting insomnia severity mea-
sured by the ISI were not included because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and
the quality of evidence was not assessed.

Number of nighttime awakenings: Two studies170,171 assessed
number of nighttime awakenings and reported a clinically
signiﬁcant difference between treatment and control of 0.69
fewer awakenings (95% CI, 1.72 lower–0.34 higher) and 0.70
fewer awakenings (95% CI, 0.13–1.27 lower), respectively,
favoring stimulus control (Table S49). The quality of evidence
for number of nighttime awakenings was low because of im-
precision and risk of bias.

Sleep efﬁciency: Two studies166,171 measured sleep efﬁciency
using a diary, of which only 1166 showed a clinically signiﬁcant
13.33% higher (95% CI, 6.08–20.58% higher) sleep efﬁ-
ciency for stimulus control group compared with control. The
other study171 did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance thresh-
old (Table S50).

One study166 reported sleep efﬁciency measured by actig-
the clinical signiﬁcance
raphy, and results did not meet
threshold (Table S51). The quality of evidence for sleep efﬁ-
ciency was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 1 study126 could not be included because the
posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Total sleep time: Meta-analysis of 3 studies166,170,171 examined
the efﬁcacy of stimulus control on total sleep time measured by
diary, results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
(Figure S87). One study166 also measured total sleep time by
the clinical signiﬁcance
actigraphy; results did not meet
threshold (Table S52). The quality of evidence for total sleep
time was low because of imprecision and risk of bias.

Data from 2 studies126,165 reporting total sleep time could not
be included because the posttreatment mean difference could
not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of stimulus control in
patients with chronic insomnia was rated as low for the critical
outcomes because of imprecision and a risk of bias (Table S53).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The beneﬁt of stimulus control is that it may produce clinically
signiﬁcant improvements in some of the critical and important
sleep outcomes vs control conditions. Although the data were
limited by small sample sizes and few studies, at least 1 study126
suggested that stimulus control produced a higher insomnia
remission rate than control, although note that only 44 partic-
ipants were randomized to stimulus control in this study. In
regard to harms, studies did not report adverse events. Potential
risks of this treatment include nighttime falls in speciﬁc pop-
ulations such as older adults, those using sleep medications, or
patients with disabilities. Based on their clinical experience, the
members of the TF determined that the undesirable effects are
minimal and that the balance of beneﬁts vs harms strongly
favors the use of stimulus control.

Resource use

Formal cost-effectiveness studies have not been conducted with
stimulus control. However, the literature review and TF expertise
suggest that the resource use and costs of stimulus control relative
to other behavioral and psychological therapies vary but seem to
be in line with other single-component therapies.

Patient values and preferences

Based on their clinical experience, the members of the TF
determined that most patients would use stimulus control

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

because of the sleep improvements it produces relative to
minimal harms because it requires few resources.

Sleep restriction therapy
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 4 RCTs63,171–173 that
examined the effect of sleep restriction therapy vs control
treatment on adult patients with chronic insomnia. Two addi-
tional RCTs126,174 were identiﬁed that could not be pooled with
other studies but were included as supporting evidence. The
control treatments included wait list control and minimal in-
tervention (ie, sleep hygiene). One of these studies174 enrolled a
general adult sample of insomnia patients, whereas 3 of these
studies126,172,173 included samples of older adults with insomnia.
The remaining study63 exclusively enrolled women with
menopause-associated insomnia. Four studies126,172–174
in-
cluded participants with insomnia without comorbid condi-
tions. There were insufﬁcient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
this treatment among patients with psychiatric or medical
comorbidities or to determine the relative efﬁcacy of different
delivery methods for this therapy.

The related ﬁgures and tables are Figures S88–S92 and
Tables S54–S63. A summary of ﬁndings is provided in Table
S64. A summary of the evidence, the results of the statistical
analysis, and whether the results met the clinical signiﬁ-
cance thresholds for each outcome (Table 3) is provided
beginning below.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section. None of the stud-
ies identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for
responder rate.

Sleep quality: Meta-analysis of 3 studies63,171,173 reporting
sleep quality measured by diary did not show clinically sig-
niﬁcant posttreatment differences, with an effect size of 0.49
(95% CI, 0.07–0.92 higher), favoring sleep restriction therapy
over control (Figure S88). The quality of evidence for sleep
quality was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 3 studies126,171,174 measuring sleep quality by diary
could not be included because the posttreatment mean differ-
ence could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Sleep latency: Meta-analysis of 4 studies63,171–173 reporting
sleep latency measured by diary comparing sleep restriction
therapy with control treatment showed a posttreatment differ-
ence of 6.42 minutes lower (95% CI, 2.87–9.96 minutes lower).
Results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure
S89). Similarly, 1 study172 reported sleep latency measured by
PSG. Results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
when sleep restriction therapy was compared with control

treatment (Table S54). The quality of evidence for sleep latency
was moderate because of a risk of bias.

Data from 1 study126 measuring sleep latency by diary could
not be included because the posttreatment mean difference
could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
WASO: Four studies63,171–173 included in a meta-analysis
reported that WASO measured by diary comparing sleep
restriction therapy with control showed a posttreatment dif-
ference of 11.67 minutes lower (95% CI, 6.47–16.86 minutes
lower). Results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
(Figure S90). Similarly, 1 study172 reported that WASO
measured by both actigraphy and PSG did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold when sleep restriction therapy was
compared with control conditions (Table S55 and Table S56).
The quality of evidence for WASO was moderate because of a
risk of bias.

Data from 1 study126 measuring WASO by diary and 1
study126 measuring WASO by actigraphy could not be included
because the posttreatment mean difference could not be cal-
culated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Remission rate: Two studies63,171 reporting remission rate
measured by diary showed clinically signiﬁcant 24% (95% CI,
5–43% higher) and 13% (95% CI, 0–26% higher) remission
rates, respectively, for sleep restriction therapy compared with
control (Table S57). The quality of evidence for remission rate
was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 2 studies126,171 measuring remission rate were not
included because the posttreatment mean difference could not
be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical
signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitude about sleep, daytime fatigue, nights with hypnotic use,
and total wake time.
Insomnia severity: Two studies63,171 reported a clinically
signiﬁcant lower posttreatment difference in insomnia severity
measured by the ISI, with an effect size of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.85–
1.71 lower) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.33–0.97 lower), respectively,
favoring sleep restriction therapy over control (Table S58). The
quality of evidence for insomnia severity was low because of
imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 1 study126 reporting insomnia severity measured
by the ISI could not be included because the posttreatment mean
difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Number of nighttime awakenings: Data from 1 study171 re-
ported a clinically signiﬁcant reduction of 0.60 fewer awakenings

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

(95% CI, 0.01–1.19 lower), favoring sleep restriction therapy
over control (Table S59). The quality of evidence for number of
nighttime awakenings was low because of imprecision and a
risk of bias.
Sleep efﬁciency: Meta-analysis of 4 studies63,171–173 reporting
sleep efﬁciency measured by diary and 1 study172 reporting
sleep efﬁciency measured by actigraphy and PSG did not meet
the clinical signiﬁcance threshold when sleep restriction therapy
was compared with control (Figure S91, Table S60, and Table
S61). The quality of evidence for sleep efﬁciency was low
because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 1 study126 reporting sleep efﬁciency measured by
diary and actigraphy were not included because the posttreat-
ment mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Total sleep time: Meta-analysis of 4 studies63,171–173 compar-
ing diary-determined total sleep time reported a clinically
signiﬁcant posttreatment difference favoring control with a
21.34-minutes-lower (95% CI, 9.56–33.13 minutes lower) total
sleep time in the sleep restriction treatment group (Figure S92).
One study172 reporting total sleep time measured by actigraphy
and PSG also reported clinically signiﬁcant group differ-
ences favoring control with the sleep restriction group showing
40.26 minutes lower (95% CI, 4.36–76.16 minutes lower) and
43.91 minutes lower (95% CI, 90.52 minutes lower–2.70
minutes higher) total sleep time in these comparisons (Table
S62 and Table S63). The quality of evidence for total sleep time
was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Data from 1 study126 reporting total sleep time measured by
diary and actigraphy could not be included because the post-
treatment mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the
TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of sleep restriction
therapy in patients with chronic insomnia was rated as low for
the critical outcomes because of imprecision and a risk of bias
(Table S64).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The beneﬁts of sleep restriction therapy are that of producing
clinically signiﬁcant improvements in several of the critical and
important sleep outcomes compared with control conditions.
Regarding harms, 1 study146 found that sleep restriction therapy
produced an increase in daytime sleepiness and cognitive im-
pairment as compared with a control condition. This ﬁnding was
likely because of the reduction in total sleep time in the early
weeks of treatment if a patient adhered to the recommendation to
reduce time in bed. Such daytime effects could translate into an
increased risk for drowsy driving and impairment at work as a
result of this treatment. In the experience of TF members, these
effects are usually transient and dissipate as treatment prog-
resses and the time-in-bed restriction is eased as sleep improves.
Hence the potential harms may occur in the early phases of
treatment but decline as treatment progresses. At posttreatment,
actigraphy- and PSG-measured total sleep time were shorter
for sleep restriction vs control; however, these results are

sometimes expected as part of sleep restriction therapy, and
long-term follow-up data and TF experience suggest that there
is a subsequent increase in total sleep time from the end of
acute treatment to long-term follow-up timepoints. Based
on their clinical experience, the members of the TF deter-
mined that the undesirable effects are minimal and that the
balance of beneﬁts vs harms strongly favors the use of sleep
restriction therapy.

Resource use

Formal cost-effectiveness studies have not been conducted with
sleep restriction therapy. However, the literature review and TF
expertise suggest that the resource use and costs of sleep re-
striction therapy relative to other psychological and behavioral
therapies varies but falls in line with other single-component
therapies. The use of sleep restriction therapy may result in
moderate cost and resource use savings compared to multi-
component therapies such as CBT-I, but such savings would be
negligible compared with those stemming from the use of other
single-component therapies.

Patient values and preferences

Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined that most
patients would use sleep restriction therapy as a treatment for
insomnia. However, because restricting time in bed may lead to
an average reduction in total sleep time and an increase in
daytime sleepiness and reduction in alertness, many patients
ﬁnd it challenging to adhere to initial sleep restriction therapy
schedules and are not inclined to choose this treatment.151 Those
who tolerate the initial increase in daytime sleepiness and re-
duced alertness and who can increase their time in bed and
gradually increase their sleep time over the treatment period
are likely to ﬁnd this treatment acceptable and be willing to
engage in it.

Relaxation therapy
Ourreviewoftheliteratureidentiﬁed12 RCTs67,91,165,167,168,170,175–180
that examined the efﬁcacy of relaxation therapy vs control
(wait list, quasi-desensitization, or behavioral placebo) on
adult patients with chronic insomnia. Of
these studies,
767,165,167,176–179 utilized an in-person one-on-one delivery for-
mat of the relaxation therapy, 3168,170,180 utilized group therapy,
and 2 utilized91,175 audio delivery.

The related ﬁgures and tables are Figures S93–S97 and
Tables S65–S72. A summary of ﬁndings is provided in Table
S73. A summary of the evidence, the results of the statistical
analysis, and whether the results met the clinical signiﬁcance
thresholds for each outcome (Table 3) are provided beginning
below. There were insufﬁcient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
this treatment among prespeciﬁed patient subgroups or to de-
termine the relative efﬁcacy of differing delivery methods.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also

determined that only diary-reported outcomes were consid-
ered critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actig-
raphy, PSG) are also reported in this section. None of the
studies identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for
remission rate.
Sleep quality: Two studies175,177 reported sleep quality mea-
sured by diary, of which 1177 showed a clinically signiﬁcant
posttreatment difference, with an effect size of 0.99 (95% CI,
0.43–1.54 higher), favoring relaxation therapy compared with
control (Table S65). One study91 reporting sleep quality
measured by the PSQI also reported clinically signiﬁcant re-
sults, with an effect size of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.15–1.76 lower),
favoring relaxation therapy compared with control (Table S66).
The quality of evidence for sleep quality ranged from low to
very low because of imprecision, inconsistency, and a risk
of bias.

Four studies165,167,176,178 reported sleep quality measured by
diary that could not be added in the meta-analysis because the
posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Sleep latency: Meta-analysis of 6 studies91,168,170,175,177,179
reporting diary-determined sleep latency compared with con-
trol showed a posttreatment difference of 7.21 minutes (95% CI,
0.60–13.83 minutes lower). These results did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Figure S93). The quality of
evidence for sleep latency was low because of imprecision and a
risk of bias.

Three studies165,178,180 also examined the effects of relaxation
therapy compared with control treatment on sleep latency but
could not be added in the meta-analysis because the post-
treatment mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
WASO: Meta-analysis of 4 studies91,170,175,177 reporting diary-
determined WASO showed a posttreatment difference of 15.67
minutes (95% CI, 39.15 minutes lower–7.81 minutes higher)
between relaxation therapy and control. These results did not
the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for posttreatment
meet
comparisons (Figure S94). One study91 reporting WASO
assessed by actigraphy showed a clinically signiﬁcant post-
treatment difference of 25.00 minutes (95% CI, 62.89 minutes
lower–12.89 minutes higher) favoring relaxation therapy over
control treatment (Table S67). The quality of evidence for
WASO was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

One study67 reporting WASO assessed by diary and PSG
reported data that could not be included because the post-
treatment mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Responder rate: Meta-analysis of 3 studies67,91,165 reported
clinically signiﬁcant 16% higher responder rates (95% CI, 11%
lower–43% higher) favoring relaxation therapy compared with
control treatment (Figure S95). The quality of evidence for
responder rate was very low because of imprecision, incon-
sistency, and a risk of bias.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for daytime
fatigue and total wake time.

Beliefs and attitudes about sleep: Two studies91,177 reported
DBAS scale results in older adults and college students, re-
spectively. Of these, only 1 study met the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold in DBAS scores, with an effect size of 1.01 (95% CI,
0.20–1.82 lower) favoring relaxation therapy over control
therapy (Table S68).91 The quality of evidence for beliefs and
attitudes about sleep was low because of imprecision and a risk
of bias.
Insomnia severity: One study67 examined insomnia severity
measured by the Insomnia Severity Questionnaire in response to
relaxation therapy vs control. The data were not included be-
cause the posttreatment mean difference could not be calcu-
lated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical
signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and the quality of evidence was
not assessed.

Nights with hypnotic use: One study91 examined the effect of
relaxation therapy vs control on hypnotic medication use; re-
sults did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Table
S69). The quality of evidence for nights with hypnotic use was
low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.
Number of nighttime awakenings: One study170 examined the
effect of relaxation therapy vs control on number of nighttime
awakenings. Results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold (Table S70). The quality of evidence for number of
nighttime awakenings was low because of imprecision and a
risk of bias.
Sleep efﬁciency: Meta-analysis of 3 studies91,175,177 of diary-
determined sleep efﬁciency (Figure S96) and 1 study91
reporting actigraphy-determined sleep efﬁciency did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold between relaxation
therapy and control conditions (Table S71). The quality of
evidence for sleep efﬁciency was low because of imprecision
and a risk of bias.

One study67 reporting sleep efﬁciency measured by diary
reported data that could not be included because the post-
treatment mean difference could not be calculated. There-
fore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Total sleep time: Meta-analysis of 3 studies91,170,175 did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold for total sleep time at
posttreatment for relaxation therapy compared with control
(Figure S97). One study91 reporting total sleep time assessed by
actigraphy reported a clinically signiﬁcant result favoring
control, with the relaxation condition showing a 27.50-minutes-
lower (95% CI. 95.27 minutes lower–40.27 minutes higher)
total sleep time at posttreatment (Table S72). The quality of

evidence for total sleep time was low because of imprecision
and a risk of bias.

Two studies67,165 reporting total sleep time measured by diary
and one study67 assessing total sleep time measured by PSG
reported data that could not be included because the post-
treatment mean difference could not be calculated. There-
fore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of relaxation therapy
in patients with chronic insomnia was rated as very low for the
critical outcomes because of imprecision and a risk of bias
(Table S73).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The TF concluded that for adult patients with insomnia disorder,
the modest beneﬁts of relaxation therapy compared to no
therapy likely outweigh the potential minimal harms and bur-
dens. This conclusion was based on expert consensus. There
were no data available on harm, but the potential harms were
considered minimal. Furthermore, the potential beneﬁts of
relaxation therapy that go beyond sleep improvement, such as
pain reduction or stress management, were also considered and
deemed to add further evidence that the beneﬁts outweigh the
potential minimal harms or burden.

Resource use

There were no studies on cost-effectiveness identiﬁed. How-
ever, relaxation therapy can be delivered at relatively low cost
and with few resources, particularly given that many therapists
and clinical providers have training in relaxation therapies.

Patient values and preferences

A study of 18 combat veterans with traumatic brain injury and
their care providers126 found that relaxation therapy was the
intervention, perhaps
most acceptable form of behavioral
underscoring the need to recognize that treatment preference
may vary according to speciﬁc patient characteristics. Based on
their clinical experience, the members of the TF determined that
the undesirable effects are trivial and that the balance of beneﬁts
vs harms strongly favors the use of relaxation therapy.

Sleep hygiene
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 3 RCTs65,181,182 that ex-
amined the effect of sleep hygiene therapy vs control therapy on
adult patients with chronic insomnia. Delivery of sleep hygiene
varied widely and included general education by a therapist in
person supplemented with audiocassette and pamphlet educa-
tional materials,65 individual
therapist weekly educational
sessions,181 and 6 sessions of therapist-provided sleep hy-
giene advice with or without supportive therapy.182 One study
included patients with insomnia and comorbid medical
conditions,65 and another included older adults.181

The related tables are Tables S74–S83. A summary of
ﬁndings is provided in Table S84. A summary of the evidence,
the results of the statistical analysis, and whether the results
the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for each outcome
met

(Table 3) are provided beginning below. There were insufﬁ-
cient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of this treatment among
varying patient types or the relative efﬁcacy of differing de-
livery methods.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for remis-
sion rate.

Sleep quality: One study that compared sleep hygiene with
control for diary-determined sleep quality182 reported data that
could not be included because the posttreatment mean differ-
ence could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and the quality
of evidence was not assessed.
Sleep latency: One study65 reported sleep latency measured by
diary with a mean difference of 0.80 minutes lower (95% CI,
12.98 minutes lower–11.38 minutes higher) in the sleep hygiene
group; these results did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance
threshold (Table S74). The quality of evidence for sleep latency
was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Two studies181,182 reported data on diary-determined sleep
latency that could not be included because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
WASO: One study65 comparing sleep hygiene with wait list
control measuring WASO by diary showed a 15.20-minutes-
lower sleep WASO in the sleep hygiene group (95% CI, 39.65
minutes lower–9.25 minutes higher). Results did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Table S75). The same study
measured WASO by actigraphy and also did not meet the
clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Table S76). The quality of
evidence for WASO was low because of imprecision and a risk
of bias.

One study182 reported data that could not be included because
the posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Responder rate: One study65 comparing sleep hygiene with
control reported clinically signiﬁcant 17% higher responder
rates (95% CI, 9% lower to 43% higher) favoring sleep hygiene
over control (Table S77). The quality of evidence for responder
rate was low because of imprecision and risk of bias.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with

hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitude about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, and
nights with hypnotic use.

Number of nighttime awakenings: Two studies181,182 com-
paring sleep hygiene with control reported number of nighttime
awakenings measured by diary, and 1 study182 reported such
comparisons measured by actigraphy. Both studies181,182 pro-
vided data that could not be included because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and
the quality of evidence was not assessed for these studies.
Sleep efﬁciency: One study65 compared sleep hygiene with
control measured by diary and actigraphy, but posttreatment
comparisons did not meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold
(Table S78 and Table S79). The quality of evidence for sleep
efﬁciency was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.
One study182 reported data that could not be included because
the posttreatment mean difference could not be calculated.
Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
Total wake time: One study65 comparing sleep hygiene
with control reported total wake time measured by diary and
actigraphy and did not show clinically signiﬁcant results
(Table S80 and Table S81). The quality of evidence for total
wake time was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Total sleep time: One study65 comparing sleep hygiene with
control reported total sleep time measured by diary and
actigraphy and did not show clinically signiﬁcant differences
between treatment conditions (Table S82 and Table S83). The
quality of evidence for total sleep time was low because of
imprecision and a risk of bias.

Two studies181,182 reported data that could not be included
because the posttreatment mean differences could not be cal-
culated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of sleep hygiene in
patients with chronic insomnia was rated as low for the critical
outcomes because of imprecision and a risk of bias (Table S84).

Beneﬁts vs harms

Based on the meta-analyses and other available evidence, the
potential beneﬁts of sleep hygiene were considered by the TF to
be minimal compared with control. In the 1 study65 that showed
improvement in the sleep hygiene group, patients receiving this
treatment made additional behavioral changes such as stan-
dardizing their sleep schedules without being told to do so. The
same study also showed CBT-I to be superior to sleep hygiene
treatment alone. In a second study171 comparing active treat-
ments, sleep hygiene alone was less effective than sleep re-
striction therapy, stimulus control, or a combined treatment
including all 3 of these therapies. The potential harms of uti-
lizing a sleep hygiene intervention as a stand-alone therapy for

insomnia disorder may include delayed implementation of
effective therapies with continued or worsening insomnia
symptoms. Patients with chronic insomnia could potentially
elect not to undergo other treatments based on their experience
using an ineffective intervention. As such, the TF did not favor
the use of sleep hygiene as a stand-alone therapy for
chronic insomnia.

Resource use

Cost analyses of sleep hygiene have not been systematically
conducted. A systematic review of 6 electronic databases found
no data regarding the cost-effectiveness of sleep hygiene
interventions.183 Sleep hygiene education is generally consid-
ered inexpensive; however, the included studies involved fairly
high-intensity sleep hygiene interventions, sometimes deliv-
ered by trained clinicians, making the use of resources similar to
that of other single-component treatments. The TF judged that
any resources utilized for an ineffective intervention may be
considered excessive.

Patient values and preferences

Although previous studies have reported that patients prefer
sleep hygiene to other elements of CBT-I,151 our analysis shows
that it does not produce clinically signiﬁcant improvements in
insomnia symptoms when used as a single-component therapy.
Therefore, based on their clinical experience, the members of
the TF determined that the majority of informed adults with
chronic insomnia would not choose sleep hygiene as stand-
alone therapy given its lack of efﬁcacy.

Biofeedback
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 4 RCTs reporting on the
use of biofeedback as a treatment for chronic insomnia in
adults.167,179,184,185 Only 1 of these studies179 provided sufﬁcient
data to calculate the mean difference at posttreatment.

The related table is Table S85. A summary of ﬁndings is
provided in Table S86. A summary of the evidence, the results
of the statistical analysis, and whether the results met the clinical
signiﬁcance thresholds for each outcome (Table 3) are provided
beginning below. There were insufﬁcient data to evaluate the
efﬁcacy of this treatment among varying patient types or the
relative efﬁcacy of differing delivery methods.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for sleep quality,
responder rate, or remission rate.
Sleep latency: One study179 reporting diary-determined sleep
latency showed a clinically signiﬁcant posttreatment difference
of 52.58 minutes (95% CI, 22.42–82.74 minutes lower),

favoring biofeedback over control treatment (Table S85). The
quality of evidence for sleep latency was low because of im-
precision and a risk of bias.

Three studies167,184,185 reporting sleep latency measured by
diary were not suitable for meta-analysis because of post-
treatment mean differences could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁndings.
WASO: One study185 reporting WASO, measured by diary,
could not be included because the posttreatment mean differ-
ence could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and the quality
of evidence was not assessed.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitudes about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights
with hypnotic use, and total wake time.

Number of nighttime awakenings: One study184 reporting
number of nighttime awakenings measured by diary could not
be included because the posttreatment mean difference could
not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and the quality of evidence
was not assessed.
Sleep efﬁciency: One study184reporting sleep efﬁciency mea-
sured by diary could not be included because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and
the quality of evidence was not assessed.

Total sleep time: Two studies reporting total sleep time184,185
measured by diary could not be included because the post-
treatment mean differences could not be calculated. Therefore,
the TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings
and the quality of evidence was not assessed.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of biofeedback
in patients with chronic insomnia was rated very low for the
critical outcomes because of imprecision and a risk of bias
(Table S86).

Beneﬁts vs harms

There were no harms evaluated or reported in the included
studies. Based on their clinical experience, the members of the
TF determined that the balance between desirable and unde-
sirable effects likely favors the use of biofeedback.

Resource use

Biofeedback treatment requires expensive psychophysiological
monitoring equipment and advanced training, so the costs of

prescribing/providing this service would be considered mod-
erate to high and may render this option less appealing or ac-
cessible than the other therapies. There were no studies that
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

Patient values and preferences

Biofeedback does not require behavior change, which may
make it more appealing to some patients. However, the ex-
pensive nature of biofeedback and the need to use monitoring
equipment may factor negatively in the decision to use it.
Because biofeedback is not widely available, and the TF could
not identify any published evaluations of patient preferences,
the TF determined that patients’ values and preferences for this
intervention were uncertain.

Paradoxical intention
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 5 RCTs168,169,186–188 that
examined the effect of paradoxical intention vs control for adult
patients with chronic insomnia. Determination of clinical sig-
niﬁcance was possible for only 2 of these studies. All the studies
were conducted in the adult population. Three studies168,187,188
excluded patients with medical comorbidities, and 1168 also
excluded patients with psychiatric comorbidities. One study
delivered paradoxical intention over the course of 2 sessions,188
3 studies168,169,186 delivered treatment over 4 sessions, and the
ﬁnal study187 delivered therapy over the course of 8 sessions.
Four studies169,186–188conducted their last follow-up at post-
intervention, and the remaining study168 conducted the last
assessment at 12 weeks posttreatment.

The related tables are Table S87 and Table S88. A summary
of ﬁndings is provided in Table S89. A summary of the evi-
dence, the results of the statistical analysis, and whether the
results met the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for each outcome
(Table 3) are provided beginning below. There were insufﬁ-
cient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of this treatment among
types or the relative efﬁcacy of differ-
varying patient
ing delivery methods.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of
this intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data on WASO,
remission rate, or responder rate.

Sleep quality: Two studies187,188reporting diary-determined
sleep quality could not be included because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and
the quality of evidence was not assessed.

tion to placebo control using diary-measured sleep latency

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

study186 showed a clinically signiﬁcant 28.25-minutes-lower
sleep latency for paradoxical intention (95% CI, 8.37–48.13
minutes) compared with control (Table S87). The other study168
reported a posttreatment difference of 1.38 minutes lower (95%
CI, 19.50 minutes lower–16.74 minutes higher), between
paradoxical intention and control that did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold (Table S87). The quality of evidence for
sleep latency was very low because of imprecision, inconsis-
tency, and risk of bias.

Two studies169,187 reporting diary-determined sleep latency
could not be included because the posttreatment mean differ-
ences could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not
evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention: beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitudes about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights
with hypnotic use, sleep efﬁciency, total wake time, and total
sleep time.

Number of nighttime awakenings: One study186 compared
paradoxical
intention to placebo control for reducing the
number of nighttime awakenings reported in sleep diaries.
Results of that study showed a clinically signiﬁcant difference
of 0.75 fewer awakenings (95% CI, 0.15–1.35 fewer awak-
enings) for patients receiving paradoxical intention treatment
compared with control treatment (Table S88). The quality of
evidence for number of nighttime awakenings was low because
of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Total sleep time: One study187 reporting diary-determined total
sleep time could not be included because the posttreatment
mean difference could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF
could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings and
the quality of evidence was not assessed.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of paradoxical in-
tention in patients with chronic insomnia was rated very low for
the critical outcomes because of imprecision, inconsistency,
and risk of bias (Table S89).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The potential beneﬁts of paradoxical intention could include a
modest reduction in sleep latency. The results suggest that this
treatment did produce a clinically signiﬁcant reduction in the
number of awakenings during the night, an outcome designated
as important but not critical by the TF. The harms of this
treatment, for the most part, remain unstudied. However, 1
report showed that paradoxical
intention combined with
feedback about a patient’s accuracy in self-reported sleep la-
tency estimates can lead to an increase rather than a decrease in
self-reported sleep latency.168 Given the nature of paradoxical

intention, wherein patients are given the instruction to try to stay
awake in bed, this intervention could increase anxiety about
sleep in some patients.

Resource use

Formal cost-effectiveness studies have not been conducted with
paradoxical intention. However, the literature review and TF
expertise suggest that there would be negligible costs or savings
inherent in this treatment compared with other behavioral and
psychological insomnia therapies.

Patient values and preferences

This approach may raise anxiety levels in some patients and may
make sleep more difﬁcult. Because our meta-analyses did not
show beneﬁts of this treatment vs control treatment for reducing
sleep latency, it may not be viewed as a desirable treatment
choice for patients with insomnia. Based on their clinical ex-
perience, the members of the TF determined that some patients
would choose paradoxical intention but that it may be less
appealing to patients who already have difﬁculty falling asleep.

Intensive Sleep Retraining (ISR)
One study166 reported on ISR using an in-person one-on-one
delivery method compared with sleep hygiene. Participants
consisted of patients with insomnia and no comorbidities.

The related tables are Tables S90–S96. A summary of
ﬁndings is provided in Table S97. A summary of the evidence,
the results of the statistical analysis, and whether the results met
the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for each outcome (Table 3)
are provided beginning below. There were insufﬁcient data to
evaluate the efﬁcacy of reducing sleep latency using this
treatment among varying patient types or the relative efﬁcacy
of differing delivery methods.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for remission
rate or responder rate.

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

(Table S91). The quality of evidence for sleep latency was low
because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

WASO: One study166 comparing ISR to control measured
WASO by diary; results showed a posttreatment difference of
19.60 minutes (95% CI, 58.35 minutes lower–19.15 minutes
higher; Table S92) favoring ISR, which did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold. The quality of evidence for WASO was
low because of imprecision and risk of bias.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention; beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitude about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights
with hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, and total
wake time.
Sleep efﬁciency: One study166 reported a clinically signiﬁcant
posttreatment difference of 11.61% (95% CI, 3.77%–19.45%)
for diary-determined sleep efﬁciency when compared with
control (Table S93). The same study166 also reported sleep
efﬁciency measured by actigraphy, and the results did not meet
the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Table S94). The quality of
evidence for sleep efﬁciency was low because of imprecision
and a risk of bias.
Total sleep time: One study166 reported clinically signiﬁcant
posttreatment differences for total sleep time measured by diary
of 52.97 minutes higher (95% CI, 8.32–97.62 minutes higher)
and differences measured by actigraphy of 23.78 minutes
higher (95% CI, 21.70 minutes lower–69.26 minutes higher),
favoring the ISR intervention (Table S95 and Table S96). The
quality of evidence for total sleep time was low because of
imprecision and a risk of bias.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of ISR in patients
with chronic insomnia was rated low for the critical outcomes
because of imprecision and a risk of bias (Table S97).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The potential beneﬁts of ISR were based on 1 study166 that
revealed clinically signiﬁcant improvement in critical out-
comes, including self-reported sleep latency, sleep quality, and
response rate. These desirable effects were judged by the TF
to be moderate. ISR was delivered in a brief 25-hour sleep
deprivation period, so treatment resulted in rapid sleep
improvements.166 These potential beneﬁts need to be consid-
ered in relation to possible harms, which may include cognitive
impairment, fatigue, and increased sleepiness resulting from the
procedure. The TF assessed these undesirable effects as minor.
Based on their clinical experience, the members of the TF
determined that the undesirable effects are minimal and that the
balance of beneﬁts vs harms favors the use of ISR.

Resource use

Formal cost-effectiveness studies have not been conducted
with ISR.This intervention, as conducted by Harris, Lack,
Kemp, and colleagues,166 would require a PSG laboratory with
intensive monitoring by a trained technologist
throughout
the treatment and would be conducted during periods that may
not be typically staffed by laboratory personnel. The resource
use and costs related to ISR would likely surpass other forms of
chronic insomnia treatments. Future research investigating
the utilization of a self-administered version of ISR at home
could potentially result in substantial resource reductions for
ISR treatment.

Patient values and preferences

Based on their clinical experience, the members of the TF
determined that some adults with chronic insomnia would
choose ISR therapy. The short-term nature of this intervention
could be appealing to some adults with chronic insomnia.
to engage in ISR
However, some patients may not want
treatment because of its demanding procedure.

Mindfulness
Our review of the literature identiﬁed 3 RCTs189–191 that ex-
amined the effect of mindfulness vs control on adult patients
with chronic insomnia. All 3 studies utilized group therapy. One
study191focused on older adults.

The related tables are Tables S98–S111. A summary of
ﬁndings is provided in Table S112. A summary of the evidence,
the results of the statistical analysis, and whether the results
met the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds for each outcome
(Table 3) are provided beginning below. There were insufﬁ-
cient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of this treatment among
varying patient types or the relative efﬁcacy of differing
delivery methods.

Critical outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
critical for decision-making when recommending the use of this
intervention: sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, remission
rate, and responder rate; of these outcomes, remission rate and
responder rate were considered the most important. The TF also
determined that only diary-reported outcomes were considered
critical, but data reported using other tools (PSQI, actigraphy,
PSG) are also reported in this section.

Sleep quality: Only 1 study191 reported sleep quality measured
by the PSQI with a clinically signiﬁcant effect size of 1.04 (95%
CI, 0.50–1.50 points lower) at posttreatment, favoring mind-
fulness over control (Table S98). The quality of evidence for
sleep quality was low because of a low sample size and a risk
of bias.

Sleep latency: One study190 reporting sleep latency measured
by sleep diary showed a posttreatment difference of 3.80
minutes lower (95% CI, 15.52 minutes lower–7.92 minutes
higher) between treatment and control, results that were not
clinically signiﬁcant (Table S99). The quality of evidence for
sleep latency was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

WASO: Similarly, 1 study190 reporting WASO measured by
sleep diary showed a posttreatment difference of 10.00 minutes
lower (95% CI, 26.35 minutes lower–6.35 minutes higher)
between treatment and control, which did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold established by the TF (Table S100). The
quality of evidence for WASO was low because of imprecision
and risk of bias.

Remission rate: One study reported remission rate based on the
ISI.189 Remission rate differences were clinically signiﬁcant,
with the mindfulness group having a 36% higher rate (95% CI,
11%–61% higher) than the placebo group (Table S101). The
quality of evidence for remission rate was low because of a small
sample size and risk of bias.

Data from 1 study190 reporting remission rate measured by the
ISI was not included because the posttreatment mean difference
could not be calculated. Therefore, the TF could not evaluate the
clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.
Responder rate: Two studies189,190 reporting responder rate
measured by the ISI were not included because the posttreat-
ment mean differences could not be calculated. Therefore, the
TF could not evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings
and the quality of evidence was not assessed.

Important outcomes

The following outcomes were determined by the TF to be
important outcomes but not critical for decision-making when
recommending the use of this intervention; beliefs and attitudes
about sleep, daytime fatigue, insomnia severity, nights with
hypnotic use, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efﬁ-
ciency, total wake time, and total sleep time. None of the studies
identiﬁed in our literature review reported data for beliefs and
attitudes on sleep, daytime fatigue, nights with hypnotic use,
and number of nighttime awakenings.

Insomnia severity: Two studies189,190 reported insomnia se-
verity measured by the ISI. Only 1 study189 met the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold, with an effect size of 1.01 (95% CI,
0.30–1.72 lower), favoring the mindfulness treatment (Table
S102). The quality of evidence for insomnia severity was low
because of imprecision and a risk of bias.
Sleep efﬁciency: Two studies189,190 reported sleep efﬁciency as
measured by sleep diary. The results did not meet the clinical
signiﬁcance threshold (Table S103). One study189 also reported
PSG and actigraphy data, and with both methods, results did not
meet the clinical signiﬁcance threshold (Table S104 and Table
S105). The quality of evidence for sleep efﬁciency was low
because of a low sample size, imprecision, and a risk of bias.

Total wake time: One study189 reported total wake time re-
ported by sleep diary, actigraphy, and PSG. None of the
measures met the clinical signiﬁcance thresholds established by
the TF (Tables S106–S108). The quality of evidence for total
wake time was low because of imprecision and a risk of bias.

Total sleep time: Two studies reported total sleep time mea-
sured by diary and actigraphy.189,190 Neither reported clinically
signiﬁcant results (Table S109 and Table S110). The same
study189 also reported PSG data that showed a clinically

signiﬁcant posttreatment difference favoring control, with the
mindfulness treatment having 22.82 minutes lower (95% CI,
53.40 minutes lower–7.76 minutes higher) total sleep time at
posttreatment (Table S111). The quality of evidence for total
sleep time was very low because of a low sample size, con-
siderable imprecision, and risk of bias.

Overall quality of evidence

The overall quality of evidence for the use of mindfulness in
patients with chronic insomnia was rated low for the critical
outcomes because of imprecision and risk of bias (Table S112).

Beneﬁts vs harms

The TF determined that undesirable effects were no different
from any that occurred with control treatment. On balance, the
beneﬁts of mindfulness likely favor treatment over control.

Resource use

Resource use does not favor mindfulness or control, but con-
sideration should be given to the considerable time investment
needed to become an accomplished mindfulness provider, the
greater length of treatment sessions and home practice com-
pared with typical CBT-I, and the absence of data indicating that
mindfulness is amenable to cost-efﬁcient delivery formats such
as online or application-based delivery.

Patient values and preferences

Based on their clinical experience, the members of the TF
determined that the majority of patients with chronic insomnia
would favor mindfulness given the beneﬁts. However, the time
investment required for mindfulness therapy may reduce patient
adherence to this treatment. The limited data and the 1 study
favoring control suggest that patient’s preferences for this
treatment are unclear.189

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Chronic insomnia disorder is a common sleep disorder among
adults. It is known to cause and exacerbate physical and psy-
chological morbidity for patients and is associated with sig-
niﬁcant ﬁnancial costs at the societal level. There have been
decades of research studying behavioral and psychological
treatments for insomnia disorder in adults, and several recent
international guidelines have recommended CBT-I as ﬁrst-line
therapy for patients with insomnia.34,36,38 This evaluation of
behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia in adults
is a comprehensive summary of the evidence to date and is
intended to provide clinicians and researchers with a resource to
guide their treatment of insomnia and to guide future research.
Note that the conclusions drawn by this review are limited to the
published data emerging from research on this subject and are
inherently limited by issues with the study design of trials re-
ported within those publications. Limitations observed across
the body of available literature are outlined below, noting that
individual studies may have had other limitations as well.

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

Limitations
Several
issues were noted that spanned multiple studies
reviewed by the TF, across treatment modalities, that limited the
TF’s ability to draw deﬁnitive conclusions about subgroups of
patients, various methods of treatment delivery, or the relative
strengths and weaknesses of different behavioral and psycho-
logical treatments.

1. Variability in the control conditions: Numerous

different control conditions were used across studies,
including wait list or no treatment, minimal
interventions, and sham interventions. Sleep hygiene
was used as the control condition in a number of trials,
especially in studies testing CBT-I; however, there was
limited discussion of the actual content of the sleep
hygiene condition and how it was delivered to
participants, making it difﬁcult to understand the
potential potency of the different control conditions
used. These circumstances limited the ability of the TF to
interpret variability across studies in terms of the
beneﬁts of some treatments for some outcomes.

2. Variability of the intervention content and

intervention delivery method across studies: Although
studies generally described the components of
treatment, there was not a sufﬁcient number of studies
to compare outcomes based on variations in content. For
example, studies of CBT-I varied; for example, some
included relaxation therapy as a component of the
treatment package and some did not. In addition, the
cognitive therapy strategies used across studies varied.
Likewise, multiple biofeedback methods were used
across studies, but there was not a sufﬁcient number of
studies to evaluate each speciﬁc biofeedback method
relative to control. The TF therefore could not make
speciﬁc recommendations about intervention content.
Variability in delivery method was considered by the
TF, and it generally seemed that behavioral and
psychological treatments are effective across delivery
methods; however, there was not a sufﬁcient number of
comparative effectiveness trials to make statements
about the relative beneﬁts across delivery methods. The
TF considered conducting a network meta-analysis to
compare the various delivery methods, but because of
the heterogeneity of samples included in the various
studies considered, the TF decided against conducting
such an analysis.

3. Small number of studies evaluating single-component

therapies, with key missing data in some published trials:
Many of the single-component therapy studies were
conducted more than 10 years ago, and there was not
always sufﬁcient information about the study methods or
outcomes of interest. For example, in the scant literature
on paradoxical intention, most studies only reported
changes in sleep onset latency; however, the TF was
interested in other critical outcomes. In addition, there
were few studies of relaxation therapy to conduct meta-
analyses for most outcomes, limiting the TF’s ability to
evaluate some potential beneﬁts.

4. Small sample sizes in studies of some single-

component therapies (stimulus control, sleep restriction
therapy, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, and
relaxation therapy): The quality of evidence for a
number of studies was downgraded because of small
sample size. As noted in number 3 above, this primarily
was a concern for studies that were conducted more
than 10 years ago.

5. Dropout rates not considered: The analyses conducted
did not consider treatment dropout rates and whether
these rates differed between treatment and
control conditions.

6. Lack of data concerning adverse effects of treatments:
In general, adverse events/effects from the treatments
were not assessed or reported in the majority of studies
included in this systematic review. Thus, such effects
remain in question.

Some of the limitations of the available literature can be
explained by when certain treatment approaches were devel-
oped and when the treatment was of interest to researchers. For
example, the ﬁrst ISR trial192 was published in 2007, the ﬁrst
BTI trial was published in 2011,154 and the ﬁrst mindfulness trial
was published in 2014.189 Because of the relatively recent
development of these treatments, there are few studies on their
efﬁcacy and much of the research has been conducted by a small
number of research groups. Thus, even with promising data,
more studies conducted by different centers/researchers are
needed to ensure replicability and generalizability. In contrast to
these emerging treatments, some treatments (eg, biofeedback,
relaxation therapy) emerged decades ago and thus reﬂect
clinical conventions of those times, such as a focus on sleep-
onset insomnia and conceptualization of most insomnia as a
symptom of another disorder; therefore, they do not reﬂect
current diagnostic or assessment standards. Thus, the data
informing the efﬁcacy of treatment modalities would beneﬁt
from evaluation in the context of current diagnostic criteria and
current measurement, reporting, and statistical approaches. To
date, there are no formal evaluations of cost-effectiveness to
compare different behavioral and psychological treatments for
insomnia in adults. Some of the modalities vary greatly in the
resources they require.

Generalizability of ﬁndings
Across the treatment modalities, study samples tended to be
relatively homogeneous demographically, and the delivery of
most interventions was conducted in-person, with 1 trained
sleep interventionist treating 1 participant at a time. We know
less about the efﬁcacy of the behavioral and psychological
treatments for insomnia among key patient subgroups, such as
ethnic/racial minorities, those living in rural areas, and older
adults. Because of the variation across studies, such as different
comparator arms and different patient populations, we were not
able to compare effect sizes across delivery modalities (eg, in-
person vs use of technology/Internet). We also did not have
sufﬁcient data to compare outcomes across various settings (eg,
in-clinic vs the community) or across different types of inter-
ventionists (eg, CBT-I specialists vs nonsleep specialists).

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

Recently, there has been a focus on insomnia “phenotypes,”
such as insomnia with and without short objective sleep du-
ration. These different types of insomnia have not been sys-
tematically evaluated in intervention trials.

Future research directions
Additional research would inform the ﬁeld of behavioral and
psychological treatments for insomnia in adults in several
key areas:

1. Across behavioral and psychological treatments,

there is a need for noninferiority and other comparative
effectiveness studies evaluating patient outcomes.
Implementation studies that examine different
delivery methods and settings and different types of
clinical providers with a range of backgrounds/
professional experiences are needed. More studies
that evaluate the utility of objective sleep monitoring,
including PSG, actigraphy, and consumer sleep
technologies, are needed. Although objective
monitoring is not required for the diagnosis of insomnia
disorder, technological advances and the increasing
number of consumer-facing devices create a need for
systematic research in this area to identify
novel phenotypes.

2. Future trials of CBT-I should more consistently

incorporate assessment of daytime symptoms and
daytime functional impairments associated with
insomnia along with quality of life and other
important sleep-related outcomes (eg, hypnotic use).

3. Studies to better understand the risks of behavioral
and psychological interventions, including daytime
sleepiness and other potential adverse effects (eg,
cognitive effects and gait/balance issues) typically
associated with pharmacotherapy for insomnia, which
has been reported in observation studies, are needed.
Methods to mitigate the potential risks associated
with treatment also need to be systematically evaluated,
such as using alternatives to sleep restriction therapy or
using other methods to attenuate sleepiness.

4. Studies of the relative efﬁcacy of treatments in patient
subgroups, including those with early morning
awakenings, different insomnia phenotypes, racial/
ethnic minority groups, patients with low health
literacy or cognitive impairment, patients who require
assistance with activities of daily living, and patients
living in institutional settings (eg, nursing homes),
along with the impact among different cultural groups,
are needed.

5. Studies are also needed to improve our understanding

of the moderators and mediators of treatment response
and methods to target CBT-I components based on
patient presentation and insomnia characteristics.
6. BTIs represent a potential method to increase access

to care, and studies that directly compare BTIs to CBT-I,
particularly among patients with complex comorbid
conditions, are needed.

7. Although there is evidence of the long-term sustained

beneﬁts of CBT-I, similar data are not widely available

for single-component treatments. There is limited
research evaluating the long-term beneﬁts of single-
component treatments. Further, there is limited research
examining any follow-up treatments after the delivery
of a single-component therapy. Sleep hygiene is one
of the oldest treatment approaches for insomnia in
adults; however, recent evidence shows that it is no
longer supported as a single-component therapy.
Given that sleep hygiene is commonly delivered as
single-component therapy in current practice, often
without systematic follow-up, studies to develop and
evaluate dissemination strategies for educating patients
and providers about more effective approaches
are needed.

8. ISR may represent an alternative to longer-term

treatments and could be appealing to some patients (eg,
those who require quick treatment and/or cannot
tolerate the temporary increase in sleepiness that can
occur during CBT-I). More research is needed to
determine optimal patient selection for ISR compared
with other insomnia therapies (eg, CBT-I) and to
balance cost/resource utilization for this approach.
Future studies should also test whether alternative
forms of ISR implementation (eg, utilizing self-
monitoring devices at home) or variations of the therapy
are efﬁcacious.

9. Mindfulness-based approaches represent a recent

addition to the insomnia treatment literature. Future
studies should incorporate standard measures used to
evaluate insomnia treatments, such as sleep diaries,
actigraphy, and/or PSG. In addition, studies should
explore whether briefer mindfulness-based
approaches preserve therapeutic beneﬁts and whether
mindfulness-based concepts can be incorporated with
other approaches (eg, sleep restriction therapy and
stimulus control) to enhance treatment beneﬁts.
10. Cognitive therapy approaches (without behavioral
treatment) could not be evaluated because of
insufﬁcient evidence; however, studies of the potential
beneﬁts of cognitive therapy alone may be
informative. Understanding which patient groups are
most likely to beneﬁt from cognitive approaches is also
worthy of future consideration.

11. Incorporating patient-centered approaches and

engaging key stakeholders in the design of intervention
trials to determine patient uptake and preferences for
available treatments would also be useful.

12. To date, no speciﬁc guidelines have addressed the

superiority of 1 psychological or behavioral treatment
over another based on direct comparisons, and this
remains a limitation of the current guidelines as well
because there are few comparative effectiveness studies
upon which to base such recommendations.

13. The TF noted that most randomized clinical trials do

not include assessments of adverse effects associated
with these psychological/behavioral therapies, so
adequate data on the direct harms associated with
them are lacking.

Review: behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

Other considerations
When considering the various behavioral and psychological treat-
ments evaluated herein, it is important to consider a number of
factors that may represent barriers or facilitators to their ongoing use
in clinical venues. One of those is patient acceptance of these
therapies. The limited available evidence does suggest that patients’
acceptance of behavioral and psychological therapies is greater
than their acceptance of pharmacological therapies150,193,194;
however, not all patients will be interested in these approaches.
Among the available psychological treatments themselves, it
seems that patients may initially believe sleep restriction
therapy to be undesirable; however, those who improve with
this treatment rate it positively.151,195 There remains a problem
with the accessibility/scalability of these treatments. In fact,
data would suggest that patients may have limited access to
CBT-I, which has a strong evidence base of support. This
limited access may result from patients’ lack of knowledge of
this treatment, providers’ perceptions that such treatment is not
acceptable or accessible for their patients, and issues related to
the stigma of using mental health treatments overall.196,197
Because the behavioral and psychological treatments for in-
somnia have proven to be cost-effective relative to care as usual
(ie, treatment in primary care mainly with medications) in terms
of improving quality of life and presenteeism at worksites,198
improving communication between patients and providers
about CBT-I and other behavioral and psychological treatments
is an important priority. Although effective Internet-based in-
terventions designed to disseminate CBT-I more broadly to
patients who may not have access to a trained provider are
available,
these interventions have
achieved their broadest use at this juncture, and it is not yet clear
which patients can beneﬁt from these self-directed approaches
and which patients require the support of a skilled provider.

it does not seem that

When considering the ﬁndings of this systematic review, a
number of limitations should be noted. The TF accepted a larger
number of studies in the systematic review than were eventually
included in our meta-analyses, primarily because of how data
were reported (ie, investigators not reporting means and stan-
dard deviations, or reporting “adjusted” means and standard
deviations or standard errors at posttreatment time points). It
also should be noted that the GRADE process we used to
evaluate available evidence required the TF to establish a
threshold for “clinical signiﬁcance,” representing a meaningful
difference between active treatment and control conditions for
the critical and important outcomes. These thresholds were
established by consensus of the TF based on their expertise and
experience because there are no commonly accepted or em-
pirically based thresholds of this nature in the literature. In
consensus, the TF deﬁned thresholds that were considered
reasonable, given what is known about insomnia treatment at
this time and their clinical expertise. We recognize that these
thresholds may evolve with information from future research on
patient-centered outcomes of insomnia treatment.

Summary
In summary, there is a large evidence base to support the use of
behavioral and psychological treatments, particularly CBT-I,

for patients with insomnia disorder. Although there are chal-
lenges to the delivery of these interventions and a need for
additional research to understand the optimal delivery modal-
ities and beneﬁts achieved by patient subgroups, clinicians
should provide a recommended treatment to patients with
chronic insomnia disorder, and programs to train providers
in the delivery of these approaches should be continued
and expanded.
