ABSTRACT
Emotions significantly impact decision‐making, teamwork, stress management, and resilience in high‐pressure occupations
such as the military, emergency services and competitive sports, making effective emotion regulation (ER) essential to per-
formance and mental health. However, there are considerable knowledge gaps about ER in active‐service military populations,
particularly regarding the measures used to quantify ER, the variables studied, and identified relationships. Synthesising this
literature is critical to progressing the ER research toward realistic solutions to enhancing performance and mental health in
this population. This systematic review aimed to explore measurement tools, the variables examined alongside ER, and the
relationship between ER and performance and military variables in active‐service military personnel. Preregistered (PROS-
PERO; CRD42023358657) and adhering to PRISMA guidelines, this review focused on English peer‐reviewed publications on
ER or coping strategies in active‐service military populations without date restrictions. Scopus, Web of Science, Military
database, Medline and PsycINFO were last searched on 12/10/2022. Two reviewers screened studies, conducted data extraction
and risk of bias assessment. A tabular synthesis method was used to systematically organise study details, ER measures,
strategies, performance and military variables, outcomes, and quality. The literature search yielded 5780 studies, 46 of which
were deemed relevant. The review identified 17 measurement tools, with the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced
Inventory (COPE) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire being the most used. Psychological factors such as personality,
resilience, and stress were most frequently examined (54%), while performance variables were studied in 3 (6.5%) and military
variables in 6 (13%) of the source studies. Of the 10 performance and military variables examined, 50% were identified as being
at high risk of bias, 30% moderate risk and 20% low risk. This review highlights a scarcity of published research on ER and
performance and military variables in active‐service military members. Overall, studies suggest that ER may be associated with
performance and military variables in varying contexts and capacity. The review examines the implications of these

ER, making synthesis challenging. The high risk of bias identified suggests that the relationships with ER should be interpreted
with caution. This review suggests a link between ER and performance and military outcomes, however further research is
needed to understand this nuanced relationship in the military context.

Introduction

Emotions, integral to our daily lives, influence our actions,
cognition, decision‐making, teamwork, stress management, and
resilience. Defined as a neurophysiological state consciously
accessible as a simple, nonreflective feeling (Russell 2003, 148),
emotions sit along two continuums; valence (pleasure) and
arousal (intensity) (Russell 1980). Emotions of varying valence
and intensity influence cognition (Citron et al. 2014; Mitchell
and Phillips 2007), physiology (J. G. Jones and Hardy 1990;
Mendes 2016), and social dynamics (Furley et al. 2015; Seiler
et al. 2018) and can thereby significantly impact behaviour and
job performance. For those in high‐pressure occupations like
military personnel, first responders, and athletes, these effects
may be particularly important due to the high‐stakes nature of
their work.

To manage emotions, individuals employ coping and emotion
regulation (ER) strategies. Coping refers to the process of
thoughts and behaviours used to manage the demands of situ-
ations that are appraised as stressful (Folkman and Mosko-
witz 2004; S. E. Taylor and Stanton 2007) including responding
with coping and ER strategies (Figure 1; S. E. Taylor 2018). ER
specifically includes both conscious and unconscious strategies
to modify emotional responses (Gross 2001). ER is goal‐directed,
seeks to upregulate or downregulate positive and negative
emotions (Sheppes and Gross 2011), and can occur with or
without the presence of a stressor. For instance,
in high‐
pressure roles, ER may be used to manage anxiety due to
stress during time‐sensitive tasks or to suppress humour or
excitement during formal ceremonies. This review focuses on

conscious ER strategies that can exist within coping models and
operate in reaction to stressors or to emotions as shown in
Figure 1. This can occur in a cyclical manner, whereby out-
comes from ER can provoke the recommencement of the pro-
cess, and whereby ER is influenced by various external and
internal resources and contexts (Figure 1).

High‐pressure occupations often have job demands involving
heightened stress, uncertainty, and decision‐making under time
in an adaptive state of
constraints. Thus, keeping oneself
cognitive (such as situational awareness, lethal force decision‐
making), physiological (such as HR recovery) and affective
functioning enables the individual to maintain performance
(Andersen et al. 2024). While what is denoted as acceptable
‘performance’ is highly context and task specific, the literature
has focused on a range of outcomes that are implicated by high‐
stakes job demands, such as decision‐making. It is widely
accepted that these demands exist for military personnel (Nindl
et al. 2018; Tuppin et al. 2017) and are reflected in a plethora of
research examining methods for enhancing personnel perfor-
mance and mitigating deleterious outcomes such as attrition or
injury (Dismukes et al. 2015; United States Marine Corps 2016).
While much of the knowledge of these effects are contained
within military organisations, similar occupations, demonstrate
comparable effects. In medical teams, the high stakes and
unpredictability of emergency care can amplify emotional re-
sponses, contributing to cognitive errors (Ali et al. 2017). Simi-
larly, paramedics frequently face scenarios where managing
their emotional responses is critical
for effective decision‐
making (Duffee and Willis 2023). Beyond the task at hand,
prolonged exposure to such challenging environments can

result in emotional exhaustion (Kunzelmann and Rigotti 2021),
a key factor in burnout (Maslach et al. 1997). Effective ER is
therefore crucial for maintaining an emotional equilibrium in
these contexts for both momentary performance and resilience
for sustained performance.

Effective ER strategies are essential for achieving peak perfor-
mance in high‐pressure occupations (M. V. Jones 2003; Ruiz
and Robazza 2021) such as the military. It has been suggested
that ER is a key determinant of successful adaptation and
mission outcomes, with evidence indicating that certain strate-
gies like active problem‐solving enhance resilience and adjust-
ment (Palinkas and Suedfeld 2021; Smith et al. 2021). In the
military, studies suggest that ineffective ER in active‐service
personnel increases the risk of developing mental health dis-
orders such as psychological distress during military training
(Dell et al. 2019) and worsening mental health outcomes,
particularly among early career members (Dell et al. 2022).
Using maladaptive coping has also shown a link with PTSD
symptom severity (Short et al. 2018). These studies propose that
ER could play a key role in performance in the moment, and in
performance and mental health long‐term.

Research on specific ER strategies employed by active‐service
military populations is important for several reasons. Firstly,
the outcomes from this research may identify particular ER
profiles that are more susceptible to poor performance or mental
illness. For example, certain personality traits, coping factors
and a range of other outcomes are related to adaptation in
isolated, confined and extreme contexts (Bartone et al. 2018)
and could be applied to military populations specifically. Simi-
larly in athletes, research on coaching mental skills including
ER has long been a focus to improve performance (Beatty and
Janelle 2020; Birrer and Morgan 2010; Tamminen et al. 2021).
Understanding these factors can help in selection and role
identification, and in identifying where personalised training
may be useful. Furthermore, these factors may assist in recog-
nising concerns before they increase to injurious levels and
provoke service leave. In this manner, personnel could be sup-
ported to sustain their role through role refinement, rather than
leave the service. This is particularly key, considering the
recruitment and retention difficulties defense forces face inter-
nationally, where attrition of military personnel is an extensive,
and expensive challenge (Knapik et al. 2004; Leuprecht 2020).
This research may thus be able to increase the resilience and
capacity of
their challenging work
without compromising their or others' safety.

individuals to conduct

The extent of research on ER in active‐service military pop-
ulations remains unclear with three notable gaps. Firstly,
numerous ER measurement tools exist, but no review has
documented the range of tools used and whether the multitude
of possible ER strategies have been comprehensively researched
in active‐service military or gaps remain. Secondly, it is essential
to understand which variables have been studied in conjunction
with ER in this population, yet no review has identified the
frequency and focus of variables examined alongside ER.
Thirdly, while research in other occupations suggests a link
between ER and performance, no synthesis of the relationships
between ER strategies and performance in active‐service mili-
tary exists.

This systematic review aims to address all three gaps by syn-
thesising the literature to date to identify key findings and gaps
in the ER literature in active‐service military personnel that
require further research.

More specifically, this review aims to:

1. Establish the self‐report measurement tools that are used
to assess ER strategies in studies with active‐service
members in the military.

2. Identify the variables that are examined alongside ER in
studies with active‐service members in the military as
either predictors, outcomes or covariates.

3. Explore the relationships between ER strategies and per-
formance and military variables within active‐service
members in the military.

Inclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria were peer‐reviewed, English publications in
active‐service military population that examined ER or coping
strategies, globally, in quantitative or qualitative formats. ER
and coping strategy self‐report measurement tools had to assess
what individuals do to influence their stress or emotions, such
as ‘how you control (i.e., regulate and manage) your emotions’
(ERQ; Gross and John 2003). For example, we did not include
measurement tools asking about affective states such as the
PANAS (Watson et al. 1988) or generally about the outcomes
associated with ER or emotion dysregulation, such as the Dif-
ficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and
Roemer 2003). No restrictions were placed on the publication
period. Studies with a mixed population of active‐service mili-
tary and another group in a single sample without differentia-
tion were excluded.

2.3 | Literature Search

A computerised literature search was conducted, searching the
following databases on 12/10/2022; Scopus, Web of Science,
Military database, Medline and PsychInfo.

The search query for the titles, abstracts, and keywords con-
sisted of two sets of terms. The first set included ER‐related
terms such as emotion regulation, emotional suppression,
emotional control, emotion coping, and others, with appropriate

3 of 25

boolean operators separated by OR. The second set included
military‐related terms such as armed force, military, army ma-
rine corp, navy, air force and others with appropriate boolean
operators separated by OR. The first and second sets of terms
were combined with AND. A detailed search query is in Sup-
porting Information S2.

The search results from each database were exported to Covi-
dence systematic review software (Veritas Health Information),
which removed duplicates. R.K. and T.W.
independently
screened all abstracts and then full texts for inclusion criteria.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion between R.K.,
T.W., and the senior author, L.A.

2.4 | Data Extraction

R.K. extracted data from all studies. A random 25% of studies
had blind data extraction by C.L. to ensure rater reliability.
Consistency was > 90% and deemed sufficient for a single
reviewer to extract the remaining data. Data was extracted by
manually reviewing each manuscript and data items were
recorded in a tabular format using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft
Corp). The following data were extracted: publication informa-
tion (authors/year), sample size, sample demographics, country
of sample, sampling method, groups and demographics (if
applicable), military‐related experience, study design, ER mea-
sure, ER strategies measured, raw results from the ER measure,
military and performance variables' relationship with ER
(including statistical analyses and correlations).

2.5 | Strategy Synthesis

Strategies examined in each paper were listed and duplicates
consolidated (see Supporting Information S4 for full
list).
Similar terms for a common strategy—for example, reappraisal
and cognitive reappraisal—were grouped under a common
heading to avoid inflation of the reported number of strategies
analysed across all included papers. Due to a lack of theoretical
consensus in the literature (Naragon‐Gainey et al. 2017), stra-
tegies were not processed further.

2.6 | Quality Assessment

et

al.

(Higgins

The risk of bias tool was adapted from Cochrane Risk of Bias
Assessment Tool
2011), Viswanathan
et al. (2008), and Effective Practice and Organisation of Care
(EPOC) (2009). R.K. conducted a risk of bias assessment for all
studies and a random 25% were blind assessed by C.L. for reli-
ability. Consistency between bias assessments was > 90% and
deemed sufficient for a single reviewer to rate all studies. For
each criterion, studies were rated as: Yes, No, Unclear, or NA.
Notably, questions were added regarding the reliability and
validity of the ER measure and outcome measures. Further,
questions were added regarding the reported internal consis-
tency for the sample in the paper for both ER measures and the
other outcome measures. Example questions include ‘Were
military/performance measures used to assess outcomes reliable

(e.g., internal consistency > 0.70) for a general population?’,
‘Were military/performance measures used to assess outcomes
(e.g., construct validity) valid for a general population?’. All
questions and ratings are in Supporting Information S3.

Qualitative studies were also assessed for risk of bias. Risk of
bias questions about the validation of measures were replaced
by questions adapted from CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme (2018)) that assessed method and rigour. Questions
that could apply to quantitative studies but that were not asked
of quantitative studies in the risk of bias were not included to
prevent unequal assessment between methodologies. The
selected questions are in Supporting Information S3.

Areas that were relevant to bias were categorised and uniquely
rated as being low, moderate or high risk. Across categories,
studies were scored such that high risk was allocated 0, mod-
erate 1, and low 2. Scores were added and divided by the rele-
vant categories (e.g., only one study additionally included a
qualitative analysis and thus was also evaluated based on the
bias in this additional category). Cut‐offs were ascribed and an
overall risk of bias was established. Details are in Supporting
Information S3.

3 | Results

A total of 5780 papers were identified and 3134 unique articles
screened, resulting in 46 articles meeting inclusion criteria (for
details see Figure 2).

3.1 | Study and Participant Characteristics

See Table 1 for study and participant characteristics, including
ER measures, and the compared variables.

3.2 | Measurement Tools for Emotion Regulation

A total of 17 measurement tools were used across the 46
included studies. The most common measure used was the
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross and John 2003)
(n = 12, 26%), followed by the COPE (Carver 1997; Carver
et al. 1989) (n = 8, 17%) (brief version n = 6, 13% and full version
n = 2, 4%) and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (Folkman
et al. 1986) (n = 5, 11%).

Across the 46 included studies, six (13%) abbreviated the ques-
tion set, such that a partial subscale or partial full scale was
included that was not validated. Nine (20%) studies defined
categories of ER strategies that were not originally recom-
mended in the measure. Regarding categories, 32 studies
detailed the strategies included in the analysis and 14 studies
offered only categorical descriptions, such as ‘positive coping
style’, without delineating their components. Studies examined
74 different strategy terms, which were consolidated into 32
standardised strategies (refer to Supporting Information S4) to
facilitate clearer interpretation.

FIGURE 2 | Systematic review process and results from literature searches in Scopus, Web of Science, Military database, Medline and PsycINFO
databases.

Across studies, 32 strategies were examined and each study
investigated an average of 5.7 strategies (median of 4.5). Reap-
praisal and active coping appeared in 36 (77%) and 24 (51%)
studies, respectively. Avoidance, acceptance, and expressive
suppression were each examined in 10–14 (21%–30%) studies.
The remaining 28 strategies were explored in only one to eight
(2%–17%) studies.

3.3 | Variables Examined Alongside Emotion
Regulation

The variables examined alongside ER were categorised according
to the following groupings: Performance, Military, Physical/
Health, Clinical mental health, Psychological, Social, Behav-
ioural and Other (refer to Supporting Information S5). Perfor-
mance variables included measures assessing specific job
outcomes, such as training course completion, promotions, and
mission success, while excluding variables related to job perfor-
mance but not direct outcomes, like leadership style. Military
variables included variables pertinent to the military context,

illness

influencing various aspects of
individual experiences and
organisational dynamics within military settings. Physical/
Health variables included variables pertaining to individuals'
physical wellbeing and physiological
functioning. Clinical
mental health included assessing and understanding various
aspects of clinical mental health functioning, including sub-
clinical mental
symptoms. Psychological variables
included variables related to individuals' psychological func-
tioning, encompassing various aspects of cognition, emotion,
traits, and early life adversity. Social variables included various
dimensions of social relationships, interactions, and support
systems that influence individuals' wellbeing and functioning
within social contexts. In this review, social variables also
encompassed measures assessing significant others. Behavioural
variables encompassed observable actions and responses
exhibited by individuals, representing outward manifestations of
their choices, decisions, and interactions with the environment,
rather than internal psychological processes. ‘Other’ variables
included those that did not align with the previous categories. As
per Figure 1, these variables could be predictors (e.g., the event or
stimulus), the internal and external resources or contexts that
influence ER or the outcome.

Green = Social Factor; Orange = Military Variable; Yellow = Health; Purple = Behavioural, Pink = Performance; Grey = Other.
Abbreviations: Fe = female, M = mean, Ma = male, n = number, ND = not detailed, SD = standard deviation.

Psychological variables were the most common, with 39 unique
variables examined by 26 (57%) unique studies, including per-
sonality, resilience, stress and burnout. This was followed by
Clinical mental health which contained 11 unique variables and
was examined by 14 (30%) unique studies. Clinical mental
health contained variables such as PTSD symptoms, psycho-
logical health, depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms.
Table 1 details the full list of variables, uncategorised.

3.4 | Relationship Between Emotion Regulation
Strategies and Performance and Military Variables

Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the studies that examined performance
and military variables alongside ER, respectively. ER measures,
outcomes measures, analysis, results and risk of bias rating are
detailed.

There were three performance variables examined by three
(6%) unique studies with one variable, performance evaluation
(self‐report), examined by more than one study (Gilbar
et al. 2010; Wagstaff and Weston 2014). Performance evalua-
tion, measured by self‐report was negatively correlated with
emotion‐focused coping and avoidance‐focused coping but was
not
significantly associated with problem‐focused coping.
When controlling for gender, age and education, however,
these results were no longer significant. In contrast, Wagstaff
and Weston (2014) found that participants perceived their ER

strategy selection to have a high impact on their performance.
it was found that expressive
Regarding team performance,
suppression and acceptance were perceived as effective stra-
tegies, based on the assumption that expressing negative
emotions would be detrimental to team morale. However, this
result was nuanced, in that it was also found that the regular
use of expressive suppression was found to have negative team
consequences, affecting team morale and performance. In this
way, perceptions of ER effectiveness were significantly corre-
lated with team performance. There was no difference in fre-
quency of using adaptive and maladaptive ER strategies, and
both were used to manage team cohesion to support team
performance.

There were six unique military variables examined by six (13%)
unique studies. Combat exposure (Britt et al. 2017; Marini
et al. 2017) and unit cohesion (Britt et al. 2017; Gilbar
et al. 2010) were examined by more than one study. Britt
et al. (2017) found a correlation between combat exposure and
self‐blame, and showed that higher levels of self‐blame coping
magnified the relationship between combat exposure and PTSD
symptoms. Additionally,
found that positive
emotion‐focused coping buffered personnel from the effect of
combat exposure on PTSD symptoms (after controlling for rank
and unit cohesion, combat exposure and positive emotion‐
focused coping). Marini et al. (2017) however, did not find an
interaction between service‐member avoidance or emotional
expression, combat exposure or psychological health.

The remaining studies explored career stage, organisational
commitment and unit cohesion. Schall and Schütz (2019)
investigated career stage, finding that ER knowledge was a
significant predictor of perceived stress among those in early
career, but not late career stages and that this relationship was
partly explained by a greater tendency to use reappraisal instead
of suppression. Talić et al. (2022) study reported that there was
no significant relationship between organisational commitment
and ER strategies. Finally, two studies investigated unit cohe-
sion, Britt et al. (2017) found that unit cohesion was signifi-
cantly positively correlated with emotion‐focused coping and
negatively correlated with self‐blame.
In contrast, Gilbar
et al. (2010) found that unit cohesion was significantly nega-
tively correlated with emotion‐focused coping, avoidance‐
focused coping, and positively correlated with problem‐
focused coping.

4 | Discussion

4.1 | Overview

This systematic review sought to investigate ER in an active‐
service military population. Specifically, this review identified
the variables examined
the measures used across studies,
alongside ER and the relationships between ER and perfor-
mance and military variables as currently outlined in the liter-
ature. Synthesis suggests that ER research in active‐service
military personnel is highly varied in terms of the variables
examined, measures used and that there are limited studies
examining ER and performance and military variables. The few
studies that have examined performance and military variables
with ER strategies in this review suggest that ER strategies may
have an impact on the short‐ and long‐term performance of
individuals and teams, which can ultimately affect mission
success. However, without replicated research of high risk of
bias studies and the consistent use of measurement tools, these
claims remain to be confirmed. Below, we discuss some of the
key gaps in research to help guide future research.

4.2 | Measurement of ER

Various measures were used, however several of these measures
were not psychometrically evaluated, raising uncertainty about
their validity and reliability and, consequently, the integrity of
their ER results. Some studies used bespoke ER or coping
strategy inventories required for their study (e.g., Kulenović and
Buško 2006; Wagstaff and Weston 2014) and these were variably
validated, with some providing reliability estimates but limited
evidence of validity, others relying on previous research using
the same measure to suggest psychometric integrity, or using an
abbreviated version of a full psychometrically valid scale (Ayoko
et al. 2022). That is, while measures that have been well vali-
dated were used in several studies (such as the ERQ (Gross and
John 2003), the COPE (Carver 1997) and Ways of Coping
Questionnaire (Folkman et al. 1986)),
they were adapted,
translated and at times not tested for reliability within the study
sample. In this review, unclear psychometric properties were a
major contributor to increased risk of bias scores. While

research in active‐service military personnel and similar occu-
pations may require brief measures suited for quick assessment
in the field, the integrity of results depend on the measure's
ability to assess the target construct as intended. Therefore,
reporting on psychometric properties in studies that use adapted
measures will be integral to progressing knowledge in the field.

and strategy

categorisations

Strategies were frequently amalgamated in diverse ways to
construct higher‐level strategies, resulting in variations in the
constituents of strategy categories. While such amalgamation
can be encouraged, as Carver (1997) suggests, the disparate
combinations of strategies across studies lead to discrepancies in
groupings. For
higher‐level
instance, Alarcon et al. (2012) and Britt et al. (2017) utilised
different strategy questions from the COPE inventory to assess
similar higher‐level categorisations (emotion‐focused coping)
and self‐selected categorised constituents. Gilbar et al. (2010),
also employing the COPE, conducted a principal component
analysis (PCA) to determine the higher‐level categorisations of a
set of strategies. Thus, even within a single measure, higher‐
level categorisation can substantially differ in strategy constit-
uents, as well as the methods employed to determine such
categorisation. This makes the interpretation and comparability
of results challenging as a seemingly similar category may be
comprised of different strategy questions, even in the same
measure. This issue extends to the diverse theoretical perspec-
tives in the ER literature, which may not reflect the diverse
range of strategies used in everyday life (Naragon‐Gainey
et al. 2017).

strategies

rendering

comparisons

A broad spectrum of strategies were assessed across the mea-
sures used, however, the frequency of each strategy varied
significantly,
challenging. Several
studies did not detail the strategies included in their analysis of
the specific strategies
the ER category, and consequently,
encompassed within these categories
remain ambiguous,
impeding the synthesis of findings across studies. However, the
diversity of
studied is noteworthy, particularly
considering the increasing recognition of the significance of ER
flexibility (the ability to dynamically switch between ER stra-
tegies to adapt to changing situational demands). Despite this, it
is pertinent to acknowledge the considerable variability in the
terminology employed for each strategy, necessitating their ag-
gregation for synthesis purposes in this review. For instance, 10
distinct terms for reappraisal were consolidated into a single
category, highlighting the challenge of effectively categorising
measures that likely capture reappraisal in disparate ways. This
complexity is compounded by the wide array of variables
examined alongside these strategies, further complicating the
synthesis of results within the limited existing literature.

4.3 | Variables Examined Alongside ER

Performance variables were scarcely examined alongside ER,
with only three studies examining this relationship. Of those
outcomes examined, performance evaluation was measured via
daily self‐report, team performance via daily self‐report and
retrospective interview and job performance via an objective
measure, pass or fail score on a training course. Two studies

examined performance evaluation. The lack of research on ER
and performance in active‐service military personnel is notable,
given its recognised importance in achieving mission outcomes
in high‐pressure environments in other fields (Tamminen
et al. 2021). This may be due to a variety of reasons. For
example, organisational priorities and funding availability can
change the extent to which research is supported. Notwith-
standing, publications in academic spaces may not reflect the
research and practices occurring within the organisation, and
there may be a preference to reduce open‐access knowledge
from which other organisations can benefit, and favour secrecy
(Arora et al. 2018).

Only six studies in this review examined the relationship be-
tween ER and military variables, such as unit cohesion, combat
exposure and number of deployments. Unit cohesion and
combat exposure were both examined by more than one study
(Britt et al. 2017; Gilbar et al. 2010 and Britt et al. 2017; Marini
et al. 2017, respectively). While results were mixed, these factors
likely play a mediating or moderating role in the relationship
between ER and outcomes such as performance and should
therefore be integrated in studies with active‐service military
personnel more widely. In this sample, understanding military
specific components provides context to the stressors faced by
personnel and could thus provide insight into the ER factors
that are key for both maintaining mental health and task per-
formance. For example, the relationship between ER and PTSD
is moderated by trauma exposure, whereby the severity of PTSD
differs according to the ER strategy used and the level of trauma
exposure (Britt et al. 2017). Specifically, using self‐blame
magnified the relationship between combat exposure and
PTSD. Thus,
incorporating combat
exposure may be key to understanding this nuanced relation-
ship and gaining deeper insights into how contextual factors
and ER strategies align to inform targeted interventions.

in the military sample,

Furthermore, ER serves as a pivotal transdisciplinary factor
within the mental health literature (Aldao et al. 2016),
contributing significantly to the understanding of various dis-
orders. Among these, PTSD stands out as one of the most
extensively discussed and prevalent mental health conditions
among military personnel. In this review, clinical mental health
was looked at by 30% of studies, however, only six papers
focused on ER and PTSD symptoms. This is a notable scarcity
given the high prevalence of PTSD research within the veteran
population. This research has found that ER strategy use can
differentiate between those with and without PTSD diagnosis
(Khan et al. 2023), difficulties with ER are related to PTSD
severity (Spies et al. 2020) (for further details, see meta‐analysis
(Seligowski et al. 2015)), and initial PTSD severity (Rooney
et al. 2022). Difficulties in ER with PTSD have wide‐reaching
impacts on other factors such as social functioning, leading to
family dysfunction (Janssen et al. 2022). However, the causal
and directional
links between PTSD and ER are unclear
(McLean and Foa 2017; Price et al. 2006; Tull et al. 2020). That
is, are certain ER strategies used more likely to lead to the
development of PTSD symptoms or does developing PTSD
symptoms change the way one uses ER strategies? Part of this
lack of clarity is because few studies are examining ER in active‐
service military populations, and few of those are longitudinal

longitudinal analysis to delineate this relationship, and while
some have begun to elucidate this in other samples (Pencea
et al. 2020; Rooney et al. 2022), further work in the active‐
service military population is required to understand its appli-
cation to the military field.

4.4 | Relationship Between Performance and
Military‐Related Variables

Although research is limited, studies examining the relationship
between ER, performance, and military variables reveal some
notable findings. Uniformly, studies found that ER strategy se-
lection and efficacy impacted self‐rated and objective perfor-
mance. Specifically, ER may influence performance through
other mediating variables, such as mental fatigue. This, amongst
other findings, reveals and underscores the necessity of applying
ER strategies flexibly according to context, demonstrating their
utility in various contexts. Additionally, ER strategies, such as
self‐blame, may act as mediators that can impact long‐term
mental health and performance. Despite the importance of
these themes, research on these relationships in military
personnel remains sparse. While three studies have investigated
performance outcomes—focusing on course completion, team
performance, and performance evaluation—the findings are
limited, quality varied, and should be interpreted with caution.
Nonetheless, their demonstrated connection with ER indicates
potentially promising areas for future research.

The relationship between ER strategies and performance may
also be better explained through their effect on other factors. For
example, Wagstaff and Weston (2014) showed that short‐term
use of suppression can manage immediate reactions, but
fatigue and reduce
continuous use may increase mental
emotional tolerance, impacting interpersonal relationships and
team dynamics. Broadly, acceptance is generally considered
adaptive (Schäfer et al. 2017), while expressive suppression has
mixed results (Schäfer et al. 2017; Schraub et al. 2011). This
complexity is evident in various contexts, such as sports, where
suppression has negatively affected performance on a cycling
time trial (Wagstaff 2014). Thus, factors such as the purpose of
using a strategy, duration of use, and context likely influence its
impact on performance. Given the modifiable nature of ER,
further research is needed to explore how optimising these
strategies can alleviate the toll on individuals in demanding
environments.

As demonstrated, ER strategies may be miscategorised ac-
cording to categories such as adaptive and maladaptive, sug-
gesting that the context and temporal quality of their use is
key to their efficacy. In the military context, the controlla-
bility of the stressor has been well identified as a contextual
key to whether a strategy may be adaptive or maladaptive.
Park et al. (2004) identified that problem‐focused strategies
are better suited for controllable stressors, while emotion‐
focused strategies
suited for uncontrollable
stressors. For military personnel, job demands and stressors
are often uncontrollable (Britt et al. 2017; Dell et al. 2019),
however, emotion‐focused strategies as a category can vary.

are better

One key example of this is demonstrated in the relationship
between ER strategies and unit cohesion in this review. Self‐
reported unit cohesion was shown to be related to ER,
however, results differed according to the unique strategies.
Specifically, Gilbar et al. (2010) demonstrated that emotion‐
focused coping which comprised instrumental
support,
emotional support and ventilation, was negatively correlated
with unit cohesion. In contrast, Britt et al. (2017) showed that
emotion‐focused coping was significantly positively correlated
with unit cohesion where emotion‐focused coping comprised
reappraisal, acceptance and humour. While these contrasting
results make sense on the strategy level, the group level is
leaving it ambiguous as to which strategy was
unhelpful,
in these contexts. Thus, as in other
helpful and unhelpful
areas of
these categories
makes it difficult to truly understand the complex relation-
ships that may exist between various strategies and their
contextual application.

the instability of

the literature,

The few studies that included military variables suggest a key
link to ER. Britt et al. (2017) demonstrated that combat exposure
greatly impacts ER and mental health outcomes. Assessing
emotion‐focused coping as a combination of questions on
reappraisal, acceptance and humour, Britt et al. (2017) found
that high compared to low use of emotion‐focused coping
differentially impacted PTSD symptoms in individuals exposed
to high combat exposure, but not low combat exposure. Here,
high emotion‐focused coping was related to higher PTSD
symptoms. That is, emotion‐focused coping buffered soldiers
from the adverse effects of combat exposure. Similarly, high self‐
blame was related to higher PTSD symptoms in high but not low
combat exposure participants, or in other words, self‐blame use
magnified the combat exposure–PTSD symptom relationship.
These findings are in line with the broader literature where
combat exposure is often correlated with PTSD, and detail that
avoidance and suppression are typically over‐used, and reap-
praisal is underused (Boden et al. 2013). Career stage may be an
additional variable of importance as Schall and Schütz (2019) in
this review demonstrated that higher ER knowledge was asso-
ciated with lower perceived stress among soldiers, which was
partially explained by a greater tendency to use reappraisal
instead of suppression. This suggests that training in reappraisal
may bolster early career members against stress, who are the
most at risk for mental health concerns (Dell et al. 2019).
However, Marini et al. (2017) did not find an interaction be-
tween coping and combat exposure and psychological health.
While the variables of interest and their measurement tools
differ, suggesting multiple possible reasons for this discrepancy,
more comprehensive research is needed to account for these
variables in the population. This would help identify key re-
lationships that might be overlooked and highlight potential
points for intervention.

The generalisability of the findings on the relationship between
ER and performance in military contexts from this review must
be considered within the limitations of the existing research,
which is variable and of mixed quality. The studies reviewed
show significant heterogeneity in outcomes and measurement
methodologies, underscoring the need for more empirical in-
vestigations to clarify these relationships. The risk of bias

ratings were most affected by psychometric issues with the
measurement of performance or military variables, and ER. In
some cases, measures were shortened for practicality, such as in
field research which presents unique challenges (e.g., Wagstaff
and Weston 2014). In other cases, single‐item measures were
used to fit the research context (e.g., Gilbar et al. 2010). Despite
the methodological restrictions, their psychometric properties
remain unevaluated and therefore impact the interpretation and
generalisability of results. Notwithstanding, two studies with a
low risk of bias still demonstrated a relationship between ER
and performance variables (deSouza and Feitosa 2015; Schall
and Schütz 2019). Future research should focus on selecting and
operationalising measures for each variable and outcome to
ensure methodological coherence, thereby facilitating mean-
ingful comparisons across studies.

Implications and Recommendations

ER remains a possible contributing factor in maintaining the
wellness and performance of individuals entering and working
in the military. As mental health becomes a greater priority for
defense forces, with recruitment and attrition being ever‐
pressing issues, ER assessment and possibly intervention are
unexplored avenues that comparative occupations have more
fully addressed, with promising results. Therefore, this review
gives substance to recommending further research focused on
the contextual factors at play, and to the relevance of ER stra-
tegies to active‐service military personnel.

training and support

Research in this area will help articulate the contexts in which
ER is challenging, and bolster
for
personnel to manage these situations. In cross‐sectional first‐
responder research, it has been suggested that ER strategies are
incorporated into occupational training for psychological safety,
particularly in early career stages (Tan et al. 2023). Aligned with
this, military personnel in their first five years of service are the
most likely to develop a mental health concern (Dell et al. 2019),
and the emergence of this occurs in their first three to four
years, sometimes without deployments (Dell et al. 2019). This is
also the time that personnel are most likely to leave the orga-
nisation, leading to significant attrition rates soon after a sig-
nificant investment in training and associated costs. Therefore,
it is in the organisation's best interest to invest in psychological
skills, or early assessment to identify and intervene with those
who may be at particular risk and understand the contexts in
which their personnel may need increased support. Indeed, Dell
et al. (2019) report that maladaptive coping strategies are a
modifiable factor that could be targeted to reduce the psycho-
logical distress experienced in the early career stage.

4.6 | Limitations

This review aimed to conduct a comprehensive literature search,
covering both ER and coping strategies. To avoid retrieving
irrelevant studies, keywords used in isolation, such as ‘cope’ or
‘coping’ were not included. This may mean that a select few
studies that only used these terms in combination with our

military search terms (refer to Supporting Information S2) may
have been missed.

4.7 | Conclusion

This review revealed that while there has been research on ER
in active‐duty military contexts for some years, it has varied
methodological quality and findings. The most
frequently
studied variables were related to clinical mental health, such as
PTSD, aligning with research on military veterans, while very
few studies explored performance and military‐specific vari-
ables. Military variables will be important to include in future
research to understand the impact of ER in the unique active‐
military population. Studies showed a potential link between
ER and performance and suggested that mediating variables
may help to explain the relationship. Notwithstanding, there
was significant variation in the ER measures used, the range of
variables examined, and the overall quality of studies, meaning
that the current results need to be interpreted with caution and
warrant further research. This review suggests that ER is a
promising area for further research to understand its impact on
the performance and mental health of individuals and teams.
