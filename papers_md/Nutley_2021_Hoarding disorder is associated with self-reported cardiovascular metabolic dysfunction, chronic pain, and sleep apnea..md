Abstract

Hoarding behaviors are positively associated with medical morbidity, however, current prevalence 
estimates and types of medical conditions associated with hoarding vary. This analysis aims to 
quantify the medical morbidity of hoarding disorder (HD). Cross-sectional data were collected 
online using the Brain Health Registry (BHR). Among 20,745 participants who completed the 
Hoarding and Clutter and Medical History thematic modules, 1,348 had HD (6.5%), 1,268 had 
subclinical HD (6.1%), and 18,829 did not meet hoarding criteria (87.4%). Individuals with HD 
were more likely to report a lifetime history of cardiovascular/metabolic conditions: diabetes (HD 
adjusted odds ratio (AOR):1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI):[1.20, 1.91]; subclinical HD 
AOR:1.24, 95% CI:[0.95, 1.61]), and hypercholesterolemia (HD AOR:1.24, 95% CI:[1.06, 1.46];

subclinical HD AOR:1.11, 95% CI:[0.94, 1.31]). Those with HD and subclinical HD were also 
more to report chronic pain (HD AOR: 1.69, 95% CI:[1.44, 1.98]; subclinical HD AOR: 1.44, 95% 
CI:[1.22, 1.69]), and sleep apnea (HD AOR: 1.58, 95% CI:[1.31, 1.89]; subclinical HD AOR:1.30, 
95% CI:[1.07, 1.58]) than non-HD participants. For most conditions, likelihood of diagnosis did 
not differ between HD and subclinical HD. Structural equation modeling revealed that more severe 
hoarding symptomatology was independently associated with increased cardiovascular/metabolic 
vulnerability. The assessment and management of medical complications in individuals with HD is 
a fundamental component in improving quality of life, longevity, and overall physical health 
outcomes.

Introduction

Hoarding Disorder (HD) is characterized by a persistent difficulty discarding possessions, 
resulting in a debilitating accumulation of clutter in active living and/or work spaces 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Ayers et al., 2010). Although hoarding behaviors 
can occur in the context of medical or psychiatric disorders such as dementia or 
schizophrenia, hoarding disorder is a chronic psychiatric condition independent of these 
illnesses. Clinically relevant hoarding behavior has a substantial negative impact on 
individuals, their caregivers, and the community (Ayers et al., 2010). Unlike hoarding due to 
organic causes, hoarding behaviors in the context of HD are generally purposeful in nature 
(i.e. there are specific motivation or value attached to possessions; (Frost & Steketee, 2014; 
Pertusa, Gaston, & Choudry, 2019), and contribute to substantial functional impairment as a 
result of limited activity involvement, low financial satisfaction, difficulty managing 
household and family demands, poor treatment outcomes and a higher frequency of suicide 
attempts (Chakraborty et al., 2012; Matsunaga et al., 2010; Vorstenbosch et al., 2012; Rosa 
et al., 2012). Furthermore, hoarding-related clutter in the home significantly increases fall 
risk, health code violations, and difficulty with self-care (San Francisco Task Force on 
Compulsive Hoarding, 2009). As such, HD poses a significant public health burden.

Although only a few studies have been published to date, current evidence suggests that 
individuals with hoarding disorder may have poorer physical health and increased 
susceptibility to medical comorbidity (Ayers et al., 2010; Tolin et al., 2008; Nordsletten et 
al., 2013; Diefenbach et al., 2013; Ayers, Iqbal & Strickland, 2014; Ayers & Dozier, 2015). 
Commonly reported conditions include cardiovascular and arthritic conditions, diabetes or 
high blood sugar, lung problems, and sleep apnea. In an internet survey of self-identified 
hoarding participants and family informants, nearly two-thirds of individuals with HD 
reported at least one chronic and severe medical condition, compared to only half (of 
individuals without HD (Tolin et al., 2008). Additionally, participants with HD were more 
likely to report being overweight or obese than family members without HD, possibly 
exacerbating their risk for metabolic-related comorbidities. Other studies have found that 
older individuals with HD report higher rates of arthritic and lung conditions, diabetes, and

functional impairment than their non-psychiatric peers (Ayers et al., 2014). Moreover, a 
small investigation of geriatric patients with HD found that approximately 84% endorsed 
one or more co-occurring medical problems and, on average, reported approximately three 
medical comorbidities (Ayers & Dozier, 2015).

Estimates of the prevalence and types of medical problems associated with HD vary widely 
between studies, and previous studies have been limited by incomplete categorization of 
medical comorbidities and, for older adults with HD, relatively small sample sizes, 
warranting further investigation. In addition, studies investigating the health status of 
individuals with subclinical hoarding symptoms are lacking. Such investigation is necessary 
to better understand whether a dimensional relationship between hoarding behaviors and 
physical health exists.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the medical burden of adults with hoarding disorder 
and subclinical hoarding disorder using a large, online research registry sample of adult 
participants. We hypothesized that individuals with hoarding symptoms would have a greater 
medical burden than those without hoarding and that the medical burden would increase 
such that rates of medical comorbidities for those with subclinical hoarding symptoms 
would be intermediate between individuals without HD and those with HD. This 
investigation furthers our understanding of the relationship between hoarding symptoms and 
physical health and may aid in improving quality of life and longevity in individuals who 
suffer from hoarding disorder.

Methods

Participants and Assessments

Participants were members of the Brain Health Registry (BHR), a web-based research 
registry that aims to evaluate and longitudinally track medical and psychiatric health and 
increase participation in clinical trials (Weiner et al., 2018). Details describing BHR 
participants and thematic modules can be found elsewhere (Nutley et al., 2020). This 
analysis was conducted in 20,745 BHR participants who completed the Hoarding and 
Clutter and Medical History modules between February 2017 and December 2019. As BHR 
participants complete the online cognitive tests and questionnaires at multiple time points, a 
participant’s most recent data from the Hoarding module was collected and used in the 
present analysis. At the time of Hoarding and Clutter module completion, the majority of 
participants (89.4%) simultaneously completed the Medical History module. Participants 
with hoarding data who did not simultaneously provide medical data were excluded from 
this analysis (n=2469). This investigation was reviewed and approved by appropriate ethical 
committees and informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained 
from all study participants.

Demographics

The socio-demographic variables analyzed in this study included age (18–90), gender (male/
female), race (white/non-white), education (3 factor variable with levels less than college, 
college or graduate/professional), BMI (underweight or normal weight/overweight/obese),

current use of neuroleptic medications (including risperidone, paliperidone, olanzapine, 
quetiapine, aripiprazole; coded numerically as the total number of these medications used), 
and lifetime tobacco use (yes/no). A detailed overview of demographic characteristics and 
BMI calculation is included in the Supplement.

Hoarding Symptoms

The core assessment is an online adaptation of the Hoarding Rating Scale, Self-Report 
(HRS-SR), a 5-item measure of hoarding symptoms and severity (Tolin, Frost, & Steketee, 
2010). This well-validated assessment evaluates the following hoarding symptoms: difficulty 
discarding, clutter, excessive acquisition, hoarding-related stress, and impairment to daily 
functioning. Individual items are scored using a 9-point Likert scale ranging from no 
difficulty (0) to extreme difficulty (8). Items are summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 
40.

In order to better understand the medical burden associated with a range of hoarding 
symptoms, we classified total HRS-SR score into three categories: no HD, subclinical HD, 
and HD. Participants with a total score <10 were classified as no HD, based on the prior 
literature (Tolin et al., 2010). Participants with a total score greater than 14 were classified as 
HD. This cutoff score has been previously used in genetic, clinical, and epidemiological 
studies and has been shown to successfully differentiate individuals with HD from 
individuals with OCD (sensitivity = 0.97, specificity = 0.97) [15] and community controls 
(Cath et al., 2017; Iervolino et al., 2009; Monzani et al., 2014; Iervolino et al., 2011; Ivanov 
et al., 2013; Perroud et al., 2011; Frost, Steketee, & Tolin, 2011; Frost & Hristova, 2011). 
Participants with a total score between 10 and 14 were classified as subclinical HD. 
Validation analyses comparing self-reported hoarding symptoms, as measured by the HRS-
SR, to clinical diagnoses of hoarding disorder as determined by clinical interview and best 
estimate/consensus diagnosis in a sub-sample of participants from this study (N=233), 
suggests that these cutoffs are conservative for this sample, and effectively identify 
individuals with clinically meaningful hoarding symptoms (Nutley et al., 2020).

Medical Conditions

Medical data were obtained from the BHR Medical History module, which assessed the 
lifetime history of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, 
asthma, arthritis, cancer, concussion, traumatic brain injury, hearing loss, or lung disease in a 
yes/no fashion. Participants were further asked about chronic pain, sleep apnea, and allergies 
using the following questions (yes/no): “Is chronic pain a problem for you,” “Have you ever 
been diagnosed with sleep apnea,” and “Do you have allergies?”

We subsequently classified the reported medical conditions into cardiovascular/metabolic 
([CV/Met], stroke, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes), 
autoimmune (asthma/lung disease, arthritis, allergies), acquired (cancer, concussion, 
traumatic brain injury, hearing loss), and other medical conditions (chronic pain, sleep 
apnea).

Participants were also asked to report lifetime history (yes/no) of anxiety disorders 
(including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific or social phobia, and post-
traumatic stress disorder); major depressive disorder; severe mental illness (including 
psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder); psychiatric disorders of childhood 
(including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Tourette and chronic or vocal tic 
disorder); obsessive compulsive or eating disorders; and substance use disorders (including 
alcohol abuse and drug abuse).

Statistical Analysis

We assessed normality and missing values for all relevant variables. We then used Pearson’s 
chi-square and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests, as well as pairwise 
independent sample t-tests, to describe the population characteristics of individuals with HD 
and subclinical HD. We next compared the prevalence of self-reported medical conditions, 
stratified by HD classification, using the chi-square test for independence. For all Pearson’s 
chi-square, ANOVA, and independent sample t-tests, Bonferroni adjustment for multiple 
testing was applied (three hoarding groups considered, α=0.016).

We assessed the relationship between HD status and medical comorbidity using separate 
multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for gender, age, race, education, BMI, use of 
psychiatric medication, lifetime tobacco use, and comorbid psychiatric conditions (logistic 
regression effective sample size: N=11,854 after excluding those with missing data). We 
next reduced the sample to only individuals who positively endorsed HD or subclinical HD 
and used separate multivariate logistic regression models to compare medical morbidity 
patterns between these groups (logistic regression effective sample size: N=1,644). For all 
regression models, Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing was applied (12 medical 
conditions considered, α=0.004).

In a secondary analysis, we used chi-square tests and independent sample t-tests to assess 
the prevalence of hoarding behaviors of participants excluded from regression analyses due 
to missing data and found no significant differences from those included. Analyses were 
conducted using SAS version 9.4

Structural Equation Modeling

In the present analysis, we observed elevation of CV/Met morbidity among individuals with 
hoarding behaviors, as has been reported previously (Ayers et al., 2010; Tolin et al., 2008; 
Ayers et al., 2014; Ayers et al., 2015). We thus used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) 
(MPlus, Version 8; Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2017) to examine the pathways from hoarding 
behavior, mental health, and lifestyle factors to CV/Met health conditions and to determine 
the direct association between hoarding behaviors and CV/Met vulnerability. The 
Supplement outlines the hypothesized model, as well as latent constructs, estimation, and 
model fit criteria for the SEM. After fitting the original model, numerous modifications were 
suggested by the program output to improve model fit. In order to ensure simplicity and 
maximize model interpretability, only modification indices that greatly decreased the model

maximum modification index=394).

Results

Of the 20,745 BHR participants who completed the Hoarding and Clutter Module (mean 
age=60.6), 6.5% (n=1,348) met criteria for HD, 6.1% (n=1,268) met criteria for subclinical 
HD, and 87.4% (n=18,129) did not meet criteria for HD. In a comparison to BHR 
participants who did not complete the Hoarding module, a higher proportion of individuals 
included in this analysis were female, white, college educated, and of older age. 
Additionally, individuals included in this analysis were slightly less likely to be overweight 
or obese than BHR participants who did not complete the Hoarding module. A detailed 
comparison between the study sample and the total BHR population is outlined in 
Supplemental Table 1.

Compared to those without HD, a higher proportion of individuals with HD were female 
(81.6% vs. 74.4%), non-white (15.4% vs. 10.8%), and had not received a college degree 
(25.3% vs. 17.8%) (Table 1). Further, the percentage of individuals with HD who reported 
being obese was nearly double that of those without HD (40.4% vs. 20.5%); on average 
individuals with HD reported being approximately 17 pounds heavier than participants 
without HD (178 vs. 161 lbs.). Individuals with subclinical HD were more similar to those 
with HD than those without in terms of race, tobacco use, and age. Obesity rates for 
participants with subclinical HD (30.7%) were intermediate between those with (40.4%) and 
without (20.5%) HD.

With the exception of cancer and heart disease, individuals with HD reported significantly 
higher rates of all medical conditions compared than those without HD (Table 2); individuals 
with HD reported over twice the rates of diabetes (16.4% vs. 7.1%, p<0.001), chronic pain 
(48.9% vs. 26.2%, p<0.001), and sleep apnea (32.7% vs. 16.4%, p<0.001) than those 
without. After adjusting for gender, age, race, education, BMI, use of psychiatric 
medication, lifetime tobacco use, and psychiatric illness (e.g. anxiety disorders, depressive 
disorders, severe mental illness, psychiatric disorders of childhood, obsessive compulsive 
and eating disorders, and substance use disorders), the odds of CV/Met dysfunction, pain, 
and sleep related conditions remained significantly higher for those with HD than for those 
without (Figure 1; Supplemental Table 2). For nearly all medical conditions, individuals 
with subclinical HD had significantly-higher odds of most medical conditions compared to 
those without HD; and reported rates of diagnosis intermediate to those reported by 
individuals with HD and those without HD. However, differences in both adjusted and 
unadjusted comorbidity rates between HD and subclinical HD were significant only for 
chronic pain and sleep apnea (Supplemental Table 3).

Given that obesity has been associated with many of the medical outcomes of interest, we 
next added an interaction term between BMI and HD to the logistic regression model to 
assess the role of BMI as a moderator between hoarding behavior and medical morbidity. 
This interaction term was not significant, indicating that BMI does not serve as a moderator 
in this relationship. Similarly, the addition of covariates such as marriage, employment, and

analysis.

Paths to Cardiovascular and Metabolic Vulnerability

Finally, we used SEM to examine the direct and indirect relationships between hoarding 
symptoms and CV/Met vulnerability. We devised a path model with hoarding behaviors, 
demographic characteristics, mental health, and lifestyle factors as independent variables 
and CV/Met vulnerability as a dependent variable. Estimated direct and indirect 
standardized path coefficients for the final structural equation model (SEM) can be seen in 
Figure 2. Independent of demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and mental health, all 
hoarding symptoms were positively associated with increased cardiovascular/metabolic 
morbidity (β=0.22, SE=0.021, p<0.0001).

Modifications added to the final model include the union of the latent construct for 
demographic characteristics and the latent construct for lifestyle factors, a path from 
CV/Met vulnerability to obesity, and a path from mental health status to tobacco use. The 
final model demonstrated acceptable model fit [RMSEA=0.040 (0.039, 0.042); CFI=0.97; 
TLI=0.96].

Discussion

The results of this study confirm previous findings indicating that individuals with hoarding 
disorder have significantly higher rates of medical comorbidity than do individuals without 
hoarding behavior (Ayers et al., 2010; Tolin et al., 2008; Nordsletten et al., 2013; Diefenbach 
et al., 2013; Ayers et al., 2014; Ayers et al., 2015), and, as importantly, indicate that those 
with subclinical hoarding also experience substantially increased medical comorbidity.

Although we found elevated rates of most medical comorbidities in HD and subclinical HD, 
of particular interest are the findings that, after adjusting for demographic and behavioral 
characteristics and comorbid psychiatric conditions, the odds of cardiovascular/metabolic 
dysfunction, pain-, and sleep-related medical conditions were higher for individuals with 
HD compared to those without. Importantly, results of the SEM suggest that hoarding 
symptoms were directly associated with increased CV/Met morbidity, independent of 
weight, demographic and lifestyle factors, and psychiatric burden. Our findings confirm 
previous work suggesting substantial medical comorbidity among HD individuals compared 
to non-psychiatric peers (i.e. 90% vs. 44%; Ayers & Dozier, 2015), and in particular, 
reiterate concern regarding heightened prevalence of cardiovascular, metabolic, and sleep-
related medical conditions that have been reported as highly prevalent among older 
individuals with HD (e.g. hypertension, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, diabetes, and heart 
disease; Ayers et al., 2014; Ayers & Dozier, 2015).

While the nature and directionality of the observed associations remains unclear, there are 
several potential explanations for our findings. First, it is possible that profound functional 
impairment and low levels of health care utilization contribute to the progression of medical 
comorbidity among individuals with HD. Previous studies suggest that hoarding behaviors 
are associated with limited activity involvement, an increased risk of falls, and difficulties

with self-care, all of which likely contribute to substantial functional impairment and 
reduced physical well-being (Vorstenbosch et al., 2012; San Francisco Task Force on 
Compulsive Hoarding, 2009). Additionally, older adults with HD show reduced rates of 
health care service utilization compared to those without, which may have a negative 
influence on the management of medical conditions and health outcomes (Ayers et al., 
2014).

Second, it is possible that individuals with existing medical conditions experience increased 
impairment in daily self-care activities that lead to the build-up of clutter, artificially 
inflating measures of hoarding behavior (i.e. physical difficulties when removing clutter 
from the home). However, our data do not support this hypothesis. The majority of BHR 
participants reported minimal or mild clutter in the home, regardless of HD classification, 
suggesting that the clutter question may not be valid in this population. In addition, the 
determination of HD in the present study is based on multiple symptoms, rather than solely 
on the presence of clutter in the home, consistent with the DSM-5 criteria, and it is unlikely 
that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions would be misclassified as having HD 
or subclinical HD without endorsing other symptoms characteristic of hoarding disorder. 
Regardless, it is possible that medical conditions may worsen hoarding behavior and the 
underlying causes of hoarding behavior may be a risk factor for both HD and medical 
morbidity.

Previous work examining the association between metabolic conditions, pain, and 
psychiatric conditions including depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and 
schizophrenia, suggests a probable bidirectional relationship influenced by a variety of 
biological, psychological, and social factors (Nousen, Franco, & Sullivan, 2013; Pereira et 
al., 2017; Bondesson et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2012). We have now expanded these findings to 
hoarding disorder, a psychiatric disorder that has a high prevalence in older adults, who also, 
independent of hoarding or other psychiatric illnesses, experience increased medical 
morbidity and mortality. Though hoarding behavior may occur as a secondary symptom of 
other medical or psychiatric conditions, the majority of hoarding symptoms in the general 
population are accounted for by HD, which, paradoxically, may also be comorbid with 
psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, OCD, and depression (Frost & Steketee, 2014; 
Pertusa, Gaston, & Choudry, 2019). Though schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive and mood 
disorders are historically associated with elevated rates of medical morbidity, including 
conditions of the circulatory and endocrine systems (Momen et al., 2020; Aguglia et al., 
2018), our findings indicate elevated medical morbidity among individuals with HD, after 
accounting for any co-occurring psychiatric conditions. However, additional work is needed 
to explore the temporality of the relationship between hoarding disorder and physical health, 
as well as underlying etiologies.

Limitations

To our knowledge, the present study is the largest investigation of the medical burden of 
hoarding behavior to date and the first to consider the influence of demographic, psychiatric, 
and lifestyle characteristics on the relationship between hoarding symptoms and medical 
conditions. While this study furthers our understanding of the medical burden associated

with hoarding behavior, there are limitations. First, all diagnoses used in this study were 
derived from self-report, introducing the potential for misclassification. Despite our use of 
well-validated measures of hoarding symptoms, we only have confirmed clinical diagnoses 
of HD or subclinical HD in a small subset of our participants. However, our findings indicate 
increased odds cardiovascular/metabolic dysfunction, pain-, and sleep-related medical 
conditions among those with clinical diagnoses of HD compared to those without HD (data 
not shown). Additionally, use of self-reported medical history may introduce recall bias. In 
this context, and given the dearth of literature assessing medical morbidity among 
individuals with hoarding behaviors, future epidemiological investigations will be necessary 
to validate estimates of the prevalence of these disorders among individuals with hoarding 
symptoms. Next, the BHR is not a nationally representative sample, but rather oversamples 
white females of older age living in US coastal regions (Nutley et al., 2020). Despite our 
efforts to investigate the role of demographic, psychiatric, and lifestyle factors on the 
relationship between hoarding behaviors and medical morbidity, additional factors, such as 
physical activity and lifetime history of a personality disorder, were not evaluated. Finally, as 
this is a cross-sectional study, we are unable to evaluate causality and temporality of the 
observed associations.

The medical burden of HD is higher than in the general population, and increases with 
increased severity, particularly in the case of cardiovascular/metabolic dysfunction, 
autoimmune, sleep and pain-related medical conditions. Psychiatric conditions including HD 
cause significant societal burden socially and economically, which is likely only increased 
by elevated medical morbidity (Tolin et al., 2008; Christensen et al., 2020). Accordingly, the 
assessment and management of medical comorbidity in individuals with HD and subclinical 
HD is likely a fundamental component in improving compliance with treatment, quality of 
life and longevity, and overall physical and psychiatric health outcomes. In addition, future 
study of the medical status of individuals with HD is essential. Such studies should include a 
longitudinal investigation of medical morbidity among individuals with HD and the 
influence of HD treatment programs on medical comorbidity.
